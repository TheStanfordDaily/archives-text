## Video game profits save Warner from others' recession worries 
### Washington Post 
New York — In the fun and
games empire of Warner Com
munications, there's no re
cession and no prospect of any,
because the company owns the
surest antidote to economic
hard times: a money machine.
Its name is Atari.
Three years after former tex
tile executive Raymond Kassar
was installed as chairman of
Warner's Atari division, the
computer games factory that
began with Pong a decade ago
is turning in spectacular earn
ings reports and gobbling up a
growing share of the consumer
electronics market.
With its game business domi
nant in both the home tele
vision and arcade coin-play
markets, Atari is branching out
into a new electronic com
modity, the home computer.
The long-range strategy is to be
out in front of a new gener
ation of young people raised
and educated on the com
puter, and to create the in

structional materials, games,
and cable television programs
that they will demand.
"When I came in," Kassar
said in an interview, "the prod
uct was perceived as a fad, a
Christmas item. What we did
was try to convince the trade
and the consumer it was an ev
eryday product with a long
life."
In the three-month period
that ended Sept. 30, Warner's
consumer electronics and toys
division, which includes Atari
and Knickerbocker Toys, re
ported operating income of
$77.9 million, nearly four times
the figure for the comparable
period in 1980. Its operating in
come for 1981 is expected to
approach $250 million, more
than the entire Warner empire
— including Atari, films, books
and records — earned last year.
The inflow of cash is ex
pected to increase Atari's ad
vantage over its competitors,
industry analysts say, because it
allows Atari to spend heavily

on the development of new
games and products. Atari
budgets a high 8 percent of its
sales for research and develop
ment, but it has been making
money so fast it cannot spend
all it has budgeted.
"Our R&D expense is ex
traordinary," said Kassar, "but
we can't spend it fast enough,
especially because of the short
age of engineers." He said the
engineers who dream up Atari
games and design the ma
chines at its Sunnyvale, Calif.,
headquarters "are like rock
stars. We pay them well to keep
them and they have a lot of
fun."
Wall Street analysts who
have studied Atari operations
say its success is built on a solid,
appealing product, a good dis
tribution network and an ex
panding market. Any
storeowner can buy a coin-op
erated game machine and in
stall it, they said, which gives
Atari the potential to develop
the kind of übiquitous pres

ence nationwide that the slot
machine has in Nevada.
"One of the secrets of the
success of our games," another
company official said, "is that
the most gnomish kid can play
and become a champion. You
don't havetobea bigathleteor
a good dancer. And every kid
knows he can beat his pa
rents."
In video games, its biggest
business, Atari sales are re
portedly more than three times
those of its nearest competitor.
"They should have revenues
of $1.4 billion next year," said
Richard Simon of Goldman,
Sachs & Co. "They are making
so much money it gives them a
significant advantage over the
competition in developing
new products." He said the
personal computer business
"should be profitable by 1982,
and it's a key to the future
growth of the company, which
will continue."
