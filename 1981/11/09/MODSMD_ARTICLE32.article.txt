# Love Canal resettlement unsafe
## 
### Washington Post 
Niagara Falls, N.Y. â€” A little over a year
ago, former President Jimmy Carter de
clared a national emergency in the Love
Canal area here, making its barricaded
streets and abandoned houses a stark, si
lent symbol of lives ruined by toxic
chemical wastes.
Today, $80 million in local, state and fed
eral money later, the city of Niagara Falls
says the emergency is over and that people
should move back into the neighborhood
around the old canal.
This has stunned former residents, who
are still outraged over health tests that
have not yet happened, bills that were
never paid and government promises that
were not kept.
Most people have been excluded since
1979 from these 235 small, one-story
houses that make up the "inner ring" and
"second ring" of homes next to and across
the street from the old canal. Only state of
ficials come and go to a squat brick build
ing near the school, where machines hum
around the clock, percolating
groundwater through charcoal filters to
got the chemicals out.
The current problems lie just outside the
fence, where more boarded-up houses are
interspersed with homes where ordinary
families continue their lives. This is the so
called "third ring," the 558 homes and
housing-project buildings two or more
streets away from the canal.
It is a wrecked community, and along its
looping suburban avenues there is only
one issue: how much leakage from Love
Canal c rossed under the fence?
Washington and New York state spent
$15 million to buy the homes of about 400
families who were convinced their ill
nesses and smelly basements proved that a

lot of chemi( als made the trip. The families
moved out.
But Richard Morris moved in. After
doing some convincing on his wife and
two teen-age daughters, he moved the
family July 1 to a three-bedroom bungalow
on Greenwald Avenue, half a block from
the compound.
Morris is director of the Love Canal Re
vitalization Agency, which runs the state
federal program that has bought 398 of the
houses in the third ring. His goal is to move
other people back in, and he moved here
to set an example, he said.
"We took a house with two-foot grass in
front and boarded-up windows and
brought it back to where it's a perfectly liv
able and salable property," Morris said. "If
someone will say finally that it's safe to
market these homes, it's in our interest to
get them back on the tax rolls."
Morris and many others are hoping that
the verdict will come from an Environmen
tal Protection Agency study, overduesince
June, of the current chemical levels in
these homes. It will come with an explana
tion from the Department of Health and
Human Services on whether the levels are
bad for people, and another from the Na
tional Bureau of Standards as to whether
the study is any good.
EPA is clearly taking no chances of re
peating what one employee called "the
Picciano fiasco" of last year.
A study by Dr. Dante Picciano of
Biogeni s Corp. in Houston triggered pan
ic at Love Canal and nationwide attention
when it found damaged chromosomes in
some of 36 people he studied from the
third ring. Carter then declared the na
tional emergency.
Later, some critics said the study was se

verely flawed in its technique and, al
though equally reputable scientists de
fended it, the results have been under a
cloud ever since.
Until the report is released, Morris and
Niagara Falls will not be able to market the
houses, but they are pretty confident the
study will find that little danger exists.
"They said they'd tell us as soon as they
found anything dangerous to our health,
so apparently they didn't find anything,"
Morris said.
"It's sick," said |o Ann Kott, who used to
live three blocks away. She now runs the
Love Canal Homeowners Association in
absentia, having moved to a Niagara Falls
suburb.
)ust as Love Canal raised the nation's
consciousness about chemical waste, it
galvanized local people as well. A recent
report by the New York Public Interest Re
search Group, a Ralph Nader offshoot,
found after three years of checking that
the Niagara River receives half a million
gallons of poorly treated chemical waste
every day from the "chemical row" of
companies in Niagara Falls, sewage plants
and old buried waste dumps in the region
other than Love Canal.
The scholars are also trying to under
stand how the public and the media per
ceive risk, since Love Canal was probably
the high-water mark of public attention to
the problem. Everywhere, work on toxic
waste control, risk assessment and public
information is justified as helping "to
avoid another Love Canal."
"We surely have collected a lot of in
formation on Love Canal that we want to
share with the world," said Deegan of EPA,
"but I don't think we'll ever put Love Canal
behind us."
