# Savings certificates aid banks
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
The nation's savings and loans got some
much-needed aid in October as the sale of a
new tax-exempt savings certificate helped
pump $2.1 billion into the anemic institu
tions, the U.S. League of Savings Associations
said Friday.
It was the first time in seven months that
American savers deposited more money in
the nation's 4400 S&Ls than they withdrew.
After crediting interest to all accounts, the
S&Ls experienced a $4.3 billion cash inflow.
The bulk of the money deposited in the
new accounts has come from existing de
posits at the same S&Ls, with an average of no
more than one-fourth of the All Savers
certificates representing new cash.
Thus, analysts have been scaling back their
projections of how much S&Ls will gain in re
duced costs and increased flow of money
from the new certificates. And Rollin
Barnard, president of the S&L league, said
help for the battered housing industry in the
form of lower-rate mortgages is not likely to
begin in a significant way before next sum
mer at best.
Sales of All Savers certificates by savings as
sociations nationwide totaled $18.7 billion,
Barnard said at a press conference in New
York as the trade group prepared to open its
annual convention there on Sunday. That was
enough to offset net withdrawals from other
S&L accounts.
Nonetheless, some top industry officials

have termed the response to the tax-exempt
All Savers certificate "disappointing," and
several stock market analysts, who had
boosted their earnings estimates for S&Ls
based on projected sales, are trimming them
back again.
Additionally, experts in and out of the in
dustry said the October sales may well prove
to be a peak never repeated over the 15-
month life of the savings instrument, author
ized by Congress last summer.
"The first month could well be the big
gest," said james Montgomery, president of
Great Western Savings & Loan Association,
the nation's largest federal S&L. "I think it was
a little bit oversold."
The All Savers certificate was created by
Congress this year primarily to aid the savings
and loan industry. An estimated 70 percent of
the industry currently is losing money, chiefly
because the institutions must pay record
high interest rates to attract money while they
continue to receive low rates on their
portfolios of old, fixed-rate home mortgages.
The All Savers certificate represents rela
tively cheap money for savings institutions.
Pegged to 70 percent of the average yield on
one-year U.S. Treasury bills, the accounts
currently are paying 10.77 percent in annual
interest. The rate is considered attractive to
savers because up to $1000 of the interest is
tax-exempt for single taxpayers and up to
$2000 is tax-free for taxpayers filing joint re
turns.
