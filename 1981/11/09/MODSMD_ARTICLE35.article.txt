## Nelson runs wild for five TDs Finally! Cards ram Beavers with awesome offense 
### Steve Odell 
Corvallis, Ore. — The Stanford football team,
mired in a sea of frustration in this season called
1981, did something about it Saturday in Cor
vallis. The Cardinals did their own version of a
primal scream, taking out their anger on a hap
less Oregon State team, obliterating the Beavers
63-9.
It was the stuff Stanford football highlight
films are made of. The stars, again, were Darrin
Nelson and John Elway. But there was a strong
supporting cast and Nelson definitely had the
leading role in this one. The senior halfback who
has been brilliant the last four weeks in defeat,
was even better in victory, one which improved
the Cards' overall record to 2-7.
Nelson gained a total of 304 all-purpose yards,
just 91 short of the NCAA record, rushing for 190
yards on 19 carries, and catching seven passes for
107 yards. All in just two and a half quarters of
work. Nelson retreated to the sidelines after his
final score of the day had put Stanford ahead
49-2 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter.
"The guy left me in my shoes," said OSU de
fensive tackle Tyrone Howard. "I'd see him com
ing, get ready to make the tackle, look up and he
was gone. And I didn't know where."
He should have checked the end zone.
Nelson scored five touchdowns, four of them on
the ground, to set a new Stanford record for
most touchdowns scored in a single game.
"At some point in the season, we made an
absolute decision to get the ball into Darrin
Nelson's hands as much as we could," said Stan
ford head coach Paul Wiggin. "He's an Ail-
American. He's the best player for a given team
as there is in America. The guy at USC (Marcus
Allen) will probably win the Heisman but Dar
rin's just as important to us. If USC lost their
tailback they wouldn't miss him as much as we'd
miss Darrin. In all honesty, he's the finest foot
ball player in America."
After Saturday's performance, Nelson is zero
ing in on the NCAA career all-purpose record,
held by Tony Dorsett. He is currently third on
the ladder, just eight yards behind Charles
White and 78 behind Dorsett's record of 6615.
Neither Nelson, nor Stanford, took long to
warm up. The Cardinals scored on a 53-yard
bomb from john Elway to Nelson on their fourth
offensive play from* scrimmage, marking the
third straight week they have scored on their
first posession. This time, they never let up, rack
ing up 316 yards and a 28-0 lead after one period.
The Cards made it look ridiculously easy, scoring
the first four times they touched the ball, rolling
up 684 yards of offense for the game.
The first fifteen minutes went something like
this: after the initial bomb to Nelson, Elway let
loose with another one on Stanford's very next
posession. Facing a third-and-22 on his own 45
and eight OSU defensive backs, Elway hooked
up with Mike Tolliver on a 55-yard rainmaker, a
pass which traveled about 75 yards in the air. It
was the first of Tolliver's two TD grabs on the

day.
After another Beaver drive had stalled (a com
mon occurence on this Saturday), Elway guided
the Cards to a seven-play, 72-yard drive, 34 yards
coming on a quarterback scramble, with Nelson
finally walking in on a pitch left from three yards
out. The final score of the period came on an 80-
yard drive which took all of 8 plays, Nelson going
10 yards around right end for the score.
Nelson's most spectacular stunt, however,
came on Stanford's first play from scrimmage in
the second half. On a sweep left Nelson found a
seam, cut back inside and outran the OSU sec
ondary 80 yards to the end zone. "That was fun,"
Nelson grinned, as he talked of his career's long
est run from scrimmage. "I got good blocking,
cut to the inside and it was just me against a cou
ple of defensive backs."
Elway was certainly in top form too, going 15-
for-20 and throwing for 245 yards and three
touchdowns before leaving the laugher midway
through the third period.
"I'm not one for using superlatives like
phenomenal and awesome," said an over
whelmed Oregon State coach Joe Avezzano af
ter the debacle had been completed, "but who
else have you seen that can throw the ball like
Elway?"
Oregon State finally got on the board too, al
though the offense didn't have anything to do
with it. On third down at the Stanford five, Elway
bobbled the snap from center, and was downed
in the end zone by a blitzing J J Graciofor a safety
to make it 28-2.
The Beavers finally put together an 80-yard
drive for a touchdown of their own with 7:24 re
maining in the game. It was a shame that there
were only about one-third of the estimated
22,000 OSU fans left to see it.
In the final analysis, maybe being at 2-7, beat
ing a team that has problems conquering itself,
and having no chance for a Bowl bid, doesn't
make it "Alright Now." But it sure seemed so for
a short while on Saturday afternoon.
NOTFS — Nelson's name is moving higher and
higher on a number of other record lists. Hissev
en receptions in the game put him in third place
in NCAA career receptions (202), behind Tulsa's
Howard Twilley (261) and Florida State's Ron
Sellers (212). His 107 receiving yards give him
2243 for his career, placing him number two on
the Stanford list behind Ken Margerum (2430).
He now has 12 TD's (nine in the last two games,
11 in the last three) to tie him with James Lofton
for the Stanford single season record for touch
downs in a season. . .Stanford's 63 points was the
most scored by a Stanford team since 1975, a
67-14 win over Army. . .It was the greatest win by
a margin for the Cards since 1949, when they
blitzed Hawaii, 74-20. . .Surprisingly, the 63
points Stanford scored was the most ever
yielded by an Oregon State team. . .The Beavers
have now lost 31 of their last 33 games, and their
last Pac-10 win was against Stanford in 1979,
33-31.

Nelson gained a total of 304 all-purpose yards,
just 91 short of the NCAA record, rushing for 190

held by Tony Dorsett. He is currently third on
the ladder, just eight yards behind Charles
White and 78 behind Dorsett's record of 6615.
Neither Nelson, nor Stanford, took long to

third straight week they have scored on their
first posession. This time, they never let up, rack

The Cards made it look ridiculously easy, scoring

pass which traveled about 75 yards in the air. It
was the first of Tolliver's two TD grabs on the

finally walking in on a pitch left from three yards

Nelson's most spectacular stunt, however,
came on Stanford's first play from scrimmage in
the second half. On a sweep left Nelson found a
seam, cut back inside and outran the OSU sec
ondary 80 yards to the end zone. "That was fun,"
Nelson grinned, as he talked of his career's long
est run from scrimmage. "I got good blocking,
cut to the inside and it was just me against a cou
ple of defensive backs."
Elway was certainly in top form too, going 15-
for-20 and throwing for 245 yards and three
touchdowns before leaving the laugher midway
through the third period.
"I'm not one for using superlatives like
phenomenal and awesome," said an over
whelmed Oregon State coach Joe Avezzano af
ter the debacle had been completed, "but who
else have you seen that can throw the ball like
Elway?"
Oregon State finally got on the board too, al
though the offense didn't have anything to do
with it. On third down at the Stanford five, Elway
bobbled the snap from center, and was downed
in the end zone by a blitzing J J Graciofor a safety
to make it 28-2.
The Beavers finally put together an 80-yard
drive for a touchdown of their own with 7:24 re
maining in the game. It was a shame that there
were only about one-third of the estimated
22,000 OSU fans left to see it.
In the final analysis, maybe being at 2-7, beat
ing a team that has problems conquering itself,
and having no chance for a Bowl bid, doesn't
make it "Alright Now." But it sure seemed so for
a short while on Saturday afternoon.
NOTFS — Nelson's name is moving higher and
higher on a number of other record lists. Hissev
en receptions in the game put him in third place
in NCAA career receptions (202), behind Tulsa's
Howard Twilley (261) and Florida State's Ron
Sellers (212). His 107 receiving yards give him
2243 for his career, placing him number two on
the Stanford list behind Ken Margerum (2430).
He now has 12 TD's (nine in the last two games,
11 in the last three) to tie him with James Lofton
for the Stanford single season record for touch
downs in a season. . .Stanford's 63 points was the
most scored by a Stanford team since 1975, a

THF JUKIN'FST JUNIOR ON THE BLOCK — Halfback Dar
rin Nelson, shown here in action against Washington last
week, put on another hlazing show at Corvallis Saturday,
Corvallis, Ore. — The Stanford football team,
mired in a sea of frustration in this season called
1981, did something about it Saturday in Cor
vallis. The Cardinals did their own version of a
primal scream, taking out their anger on a hap
less Oregon State team, obliterating the Beavers
63-9.
It was the stuff Stanford football highlight
films are made of. The stars, again, were Darrin
Nelson and John Elway. But there was a strong
supporting cast and Nelson definitely had the
leading role in this one. The senior halfback who
has been brilliant the last four weeks in defeat,
was even better in victory, one which improved
the Cards' overall record to 2-7.
Nelson gained a total of 304 all-purpose yards,
just 91 short of the NCAA record, rushing for 190
yards on 19 carries, and catching seven passes for
107 yards. All in just two and a half quarters of
work. Nelson retreated to the sidelines after his
final score of the day had put Stanford ahead
49-2 with 9:17 remaining in the third quarter.
"The guy left me in my shoes," said OSU de
fensive tackle Tyrone Howard. "I'd see him com
ing, get ready to make the tackle, look up and he
was gone. And I didn't know where."
He should have checked the end zone.
Nelson scored five touchdowns, four of them on
the ground, to set a new Stanford record for
most touchdowns scored in a single game.
"At some point in the season, we made an
absolute decision to get the ball into Darrin
Nelson's hands as much as we could," said Stan
ford head coach Paul Wiggin. "He's an Ail-
American. He's the best player for a given team
as there is in America. The guy at USC (Marcus
Allen) will probably win the Heisman but Dar
rin's just as important to us. If USC lost their
tailback they wouldn't miss him as much as we'd
miss Darrin. In all honesty, he's the finest foot
ball player in America."
After Saturday's performance, Nelson is zero
ing in on the NCAA career all-purpose record,
held by Tony Dorsett. He is currently third on
the ladder, just eight yards behind Charles
White and 78 behind Dorsett's record of 6615.
Neither Nelson, nor Stanford, took long to
warm up. The Cardinals scored on a 53-yard
bomb from john Elway to Nelson on their fourth
offensive play from* scrimmage, marking the
third straight week they have scored on their
first posession. This time, they never let up, rack
ing up 316 yards and a 28-0 lead after one period.
The Cards made it look ridiculously easy, scoring
the first four times they touched the ball, rolling
up 684 yards of offense for the game.
The first fifteen minutes went something like
this: after the initial bomb to Nelson, Elway let
loose with another one on Stanford's very next
posession. Facing a third-and-22 on his own 45
and eight OSU defensive backs, Elway hooked
up with Mike Tolliver on a 55-yard rainmaker, a
pass which traveled about 75 yards in the air. It
was the first of Tolliver's two TD grabs on the

day.
After another Beaver drive had stalled (a com
mon occurence on this Saturday), Elway guided
the Cards to a seven-play, 72-yard drive, 34 yards
coming on a quarterback scramble, with Nelson
finally walking in on a pitch left from three yards
out. The final score of the period came on an 80-
yard drive which took all of 8 plays, Nelson going
10 yards around right end for the score.
