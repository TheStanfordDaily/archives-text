The Stanford women's volleyball team may finally
be poised to win a national championship.
Posting an excellent season so far, the Card spikers
travelled to the prestigous UCLA-NIVT Tournament
this weekend and came away with a fourth place fin
ish, which is pretty impressive when you consider that
many regard this tournament as a finer test of team
strength than the nationals.
The annual gathering features 24 teams which are
usually among the most accomplished in the United
States. This year was no different as 19 of the nation's
Top-20 teams competed Friday and Saturday.
Hawaii, the nation's No.l team going in, lived up to
its billing by winning the tourney but that was about
all that happened as expected. The tournament

proved there is a lot of room at the top.
"This is an incredible tournament and this was our
best finish ever," Stanford head coach Fred Sturm
said. "We did some things very well and everybody
played great.
"The tournament proved that there are at least 10
teams in the country right now that can win the na
tional championship."
Stanford, ranked ninth nationally before the tour
nament, is definitely one of those teams.
The UCLA-NIVT is set up so that each team starts
out in a group of six for the first day. The top two
teams in each group, after they have all played each
other, advance into regular bracket play starting with
a quarter-final round.
Stanford, led by Jan Linden — one of six players

picked to the All-Tournament team — won its
division despite losing its first two-of-three match toa
Cal-State Fullerton team the Cards simply under
estimated.
Stanford pulled it together, though, and went on to
beat Kentucky, UCLA, Oregon and Cal-Poly SLO to
advance to the quarter-finals.
Sturm felt the victory over UCLA, which was ranked
N0.2 nationally at the time, was the highlight of the
tournament for his team. The Cards walked away with
that match in two games, 16-14,15-11.
The Cards beat Utah State 15-8,15-4 in the quarters
but lost to third ranked San Diego State 15-12, 15-12
their semi-final round. They then played Arizona in a
one game consolation for third place but again fell
15-12.
