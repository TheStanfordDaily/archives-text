# Card harriers host NCAA regional race
## 
### Dick Hodge 
The Stanford women's cross
country team, undefeated for
the year, will finally get a long
awaited test today when the
squad hosts the NCAA Region
8 Championships at 11 a.m. at
the Stanford Golf Course.
If the Cards are one of the
top three teams to finish, they
will go to the NCAA Cham
pionships held Nov. 21 at
Wichita St. in Wichita, Kan.
To say that the team — de
spite being young with four

freshman, two sophomores
and one junior — is handling
the pressures of collegiate
competition well is an under
statement. The Cards have
posted a perfect score twice
this year, including their recent
showing at the NorCal Cham
pionships, and placed at least
five runners in the top-10 in
each race so far.
Freshman Cici Hopp has won
three races, setting course rec
ords at the Stanford Invita
tional (16:43 for 5000 meters)

and the Fresno Invitational
(16:28). She has been defeated
only once, and that was by
teammate Kim Schnurpfeil, a
junior, who set a course record
(17:21 at the Cal Invite) in
doing so.
Strong performances by
freshmen Sloan Burton,
Michelle Mason, Ann Locke
an.d sophomore Patti Sue
Plumer have provided depth to
establish Stanford as the domi
nant squad in the Bay Area,
dethroning ex-powerhouse
UC-Berkeley. Yet coach
Brooks Johnson is not especial
ly optimistic about today's
race. The potential problems
he anticipates are academic,
not athletic in nature.
"All the runners are here pri
marily for academic reasons,"
explained Johnson. "Some of
them have just gotten their
midterm grades back. Maybe
they got 66 percent on a calcu
lus midterm, which is a good
grade, but they've never
worked that hard at school and
scored the median. They've
been the top two or three per
cent all their life. Their point of
reference has changed and
they ask themselves how they
fit in."

To help answer this question,
Johnson has remained very
supportive, reassuring the
freshman team members that
they'll pull through.
"They'll get good grades,
graduate and get out of it. Peo
ple who have been through it
know. But the girls don't know
yet," Johnson added.
Stanford should be one of
the teams to reach the NCAA's
but the competition will bestif
fer than at any time this year.
Of the 11 other teams compet
ing, the toughest will be the
University of Arizona, San Die
go State and the University if
Oregon.
The favorite to win the indi
vidual title is Oregon's Leann
Warren, described by Johnson
as the best woman middle dis
tance runner in the United
States.
"There are too many in
tangibles right now," Johnson
said. "Everyone will be shoot
ing for us because of our rec
ord. They'll be ready to capital
ize on any breakdown. The big
problem is that we might be flat
— it's 90 percent psychological
right now. It'll be an uphill bat
tle."
