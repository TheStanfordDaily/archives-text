# Stanford's No.1 poloists beat USC, whip NO.2 Long Beach
## 
### Chris Addington 
What do you call a team
that is 26-0, ranked No.l in
the nation, and defeats the
N0.2 team in the nation by
more than a 2-to-1 goal
margin?
Here on the Farm we call
it the water polo team.
The Cardinals handily dis
posed of the USC Trojans
Friday, and then swept the
N0.2 ranked Long Beach
State 49ers Saturday to in
crease their unbeaten streak
and advance one step closer
to the NCAA finals.
"It would take a miracle
for us to win this game," said
USC coach John Williams
before Friday's matchup.
But whoever was in charge
of miracles that day was on
vacation. Stanford rocketed
to an 8-2 halftime lead and
despite some sloppy second
half play, won the match by
a tidy margin of 13-7.
Cardinal head coach
Dante Dettamanti had a few
comments after the game.
"I thought we played real
well in the first half," he
said. "Since the team was re
ally pointing to the Long
Beach game, they let up in
the second half. Still, there's
no excuse for any team to
score seven goals against
us."
Dettamanti also praised

the play of his freshman
goalkeeper Steve Moyer,
who was given his first start
ing opportunity against the
Trojans. "It's the best I've
seen him play since I've
been watching him," Det
tamanti commented. Moyer
and the Cardinal defense
stopped almost 70-percent
of USC's shots.
However, some credit
must be given to the Tro
jans. USC started four
freshmen, two sophomores,
and only one junior. The
youngsters still managed to
hold their own and finish
the game with a respectable
score. The Trojans, recog
nizing the power of this
year's Stanford squad, have
red-shirted five players in
hopes of being in the run
ning for next year's cham
pionship.
Jody Campbell led the
Stanford scoring attack with
five goals, followed by
lames Bergeson and Alan
Mouchawar with two each,
and Greg Lambert, Chris
Kelsey, Tom Lampert, and
Bill Taylor with one apiece.
Saturday's match wassup
posed to be the real show
down. If anyone was going
to stop Stanford from reach
ing 26-0 it was going to be
the 49ers.
The Cardinals started off

the game with a bang. Goals
by John Tanner, Taylor and
Bergeson put Stanford up
by three before the 49ers
could bat ah eye. However,
Long Beach's James Birdsell
found the spot on a man-up
situation and put 49ers were
on the scoreboard.
Stanford scored early in
the second quarter but
quick goals from Long
Beach's Doug Kimbell and
Bob Ratkovic brought the
score to 4-3. It looked like it
could be a hard battle. But,
as Stanford fans know,
something always happens
when other teams begin to
get close. The Cardinals got
ferocious on defense and
explosive on offense.
During the next ten
minutes of play, Stanford
reeled off six unanswered
goals to put the game on ice.
Furthermore, Stanford's de
fensive play was so intense
that Long Beach ran out
their 35-second clock five
times. To put it lightly, the
49ers' morale just about
equaled the number of
goals they scored.
Late in the fourth quarter
the 49ers managed to score
two more, and a tally by
Lambert of Stanford made
the final score 11-5 in favor
of the Cardinals.

SINK OR WIN — The Stanford water polo team can't seem
to do anything wrong these days. Senior Chris Kelsey,
shown here, helped the Cards to two more wins this week-

end. Stanford rolled over USC and Long Beach State, ex
tending its unbeaten record to 26-0 with only two more
regular season games left, both against UC-Berkeley.
"When we are really
ready, no one is going to
tome close to beating us,"
commented Dettamanti af
ter the game. "We totally
dominated all phases of the
game, especially the de
fense," fie added.
Hie Cardinal defense was
truly amazing, allowing only
1-of-6 Long Beach man-up
situations to score. The last
time the two teams met the
49ers scored on 4-5.
The score might have
been even more lopsided
were it not for an incredible
number of missed shots on
Stanford's pait. It took the
Cardinals 36 attempts to
score their 11 uoals, as com

pared to the USC game
when Stanford went 13-24.
Scoring for Stanford was
Mouchawar with 3,
Bergeson and Campbell
with 2, and Kelsey, Lambert,
Tanner and Taylor with one
apiece.
Stanford's explosive of
fense has now out-scored its
opponents 344-136 for an
average of 13.2 goals per
game to their opponents'
5.2. 1 he Cardinals also have
seven players with more
than 20 goals to their credit.
Leading the pack is
Bergeson with 60, followed
by Campbell with 59,
Mouchawar with 44, Kelsey
with 38, Taylor with 28, Tan
ner with 26, and Lambert

with 23.
The Cardinals have two
regular season games left,
both of which are against
their rivals from across the
Bay. Next Friday Stanford
travels to Berkeley's Har
mon pool for an afternoon
matchup. The morning of
Big Game the Bears will
come to Stanford to do bat
tle at the Cardinals' own de-
Guerre pool.
From there it's on to the
Nationals, to be held at the

it the water polo team.
The Cardinals handily dis
posed of the USC Trojans
Friday, and then swept the
N0.2 ranked Long Beach
State 49ers Saturday to in
crease their unbeaten streak
and advance one step closer
to the NCAA finals.
"It would take a miracle
for us to win this game," said
USC coach John Williams
before Friday's matchup.
But whoever was in charge
of miracles that day was on
vacation. Stanford rocketed
to an 8-2 halftime lead and
despite some sloppy second
half play, won the match by
a tidy margin of 13-7.
Cardinal head coach
Dante Dettamanti had a few
comments after the game.
"I thought we played real
well in the first half," he
said. "Since the team was re
ally pointing to the Long
Beach game, they let up in
the second half. Still, there's
no excuse for any team to
score seven goals against
us."
Dettamanti also praised

the play of his freshman
goalkeeper Steve Moyer,
who was given his first start
ing opportunity against the
Trojans. "It's the best I've
seen him play since I've
been watching him," Det
tamanti commented. Moyer
and the Cardinal defense
stopped almost 70-percent
of USC's shots.
However, some credit
must be given to the Tro
jans. USC started four
freshmen, two sophomores,
and only one junior. The
youngsters still managed to
hold their own and finish
the game with a respectable
score. The Trojans, recog
nizing the power of this
year's Stanford squad, have
red-shirted five players in
hopes of being in the run
ning for next year's cham
pionship.
Jody Campbell led the
Stanford scoring attack with
five goals, followed by
lames Bergeson and Alan
Mouchawar with two each,
and Greg Lambert, Chris
Kelsey, Tom Lampert, and
Bill Taylor with one apiece.
Saturday's match wassup
posed to be the real show
down. If anyone was going
to stop Stanford from reach
ing 26-0 it was going to be
the 49ers.
The Cardinals started off

the game with a bang. Goals
by John Tanner, Taylor and
Bergeson put Stanford up
by three before the 49ers
could bat ah eye. However,
Long Beach's James Birdsell
found the spot on a man-up
situation and put 49ers were
on the scoreboard.
Stanford scored early in
the second quarter but
quick goals from Long
Beach's Doug Kimbell and
Bob Ratkovic brought the
score to 4-3. It looked like it
could be a hard battle. But,
as Stanford fans know,
something always happens
when other teams begin to
get close. The Cardinals got
ferocious on defense and
explosive on offense.
During the next ten
minutes of play, Stanford
reeled off six unanswered
goals to put the game on ice.
Furthermore, Stanford's de
fensive play was so intense
that Long Beach ran out
their 35-second clock five
times. To put it lightly, the
49ers' morale just about
equaled the number of
goals they scored.
Late in the fourth quarter
the 49ers managed to score
two more, and a tally by
Lambert of Stanford made
the final score 11-5 in favor
of the Cardinals.

SINK OR WIN — The Stanford water polo team can't seem
to do anything wrong these days. Senior Chris Kelsey,
shown here, helped the Cards to two more wins this week-

end. Stanford rolled over USC and Long Beach State, ex
tending its unbeaten record to 26-0 with only two more
regular season games left, both against UC-Berkeley.
"When we are really
ready, no one is going to
tome close to beating us,"
commented Dettamanti af
ter the game. "We totally
dominated all phases of the
game, especially the de
fense," fie added.
Hie Cardinal defense was
truly amazing, allowing only
1-of-6 Long Beach man-up
situations to score. The last
time the two teams met the
49ers scored on 4-5.
The score might have
been even more lopsided
were it not for an incredible
number of missed shots on
Stanford's pait. It took the
Cardinals 36 attempts to
score their 11 uoals, as com

pared to the USC game
when Stanford went 13-24.
Scoring for Stanford was
Mouchawar with 3,
Bergeson and Campbell
with 2, and Kelsey, Lambert,
Tanner and Taylor with one
apiece.
Stanford's explosive of
fense has now out-scored its
opponents 344-136 for an
average of 13.2 goals per
game to their opponents'
5.2. 1 he Cardinals also have
seven players with more
than 20 goals to their credit.
Leading the pack is
Bergeson with 60, followed
by Campbell with 59,
Mouchawar with 44, Kelsey
with 38, Taylor with 28, Tan
ner with 26, and Lambert

with 23.
The Cardinals have two
regular season games left,
both of which are against
their rivals from across the
Bay. Next Friday Stanford
travels to Berkeley's Har
mon pool for an afternoon
matchup. The morning of
Big Game the Bears will
come to Stanford to do bat
tle at the Cardinals' own de-
Guerre pool.
From there it's on to the
Nationals, to be held at the
Belmont Plaza in Long
Beach Nov. 28 and 29, where
the Cardinals will try to win
their fourth national cham
pionship in six years, and be
the first team in 13 years to
finish a season undefeated.
