San Francisco (AP) — Joe
Montana threw a pair of touch
down passes for San Francisco,
but the 49ers needed an in
terception by safety Dwight
Hicks with one minute left in
the game to post their seventh
straight victory, 17-14 over the
Atlanta Falcons yesterday.
The victory gave the 49ers,
8-2, a commanding three
game lead over defending
champion Atlanta and the Los
Angeles Rams, both 5-5, in the
National Football Conference
West. Their winning streak is
the longest by a National Foot
ball League team this year.
Steve Bartkowski of Atlanta
threw his 22nd touchdown pass
of the season with 1:43 remain
ing in the game, hitting Alfred
Jackson on a 25-yard toss into
the end zone. The Falcons re
tained possession of the ball
when Kenny Johnson re
covered an onside kickoff.
A 25-yard pass from
Bartkowski to Alfred Jenkins
gave the Falcons a first down at
the San Francisco 17. But the
next pass, aimed at tight end
Junior Miller, was picked off by
Hicks at the five.
It was Hicks' second in

terception ot the game and his
seventh of the season.
Montana, the leading passer
in the NFC, hit Freddie
Solomon on a 14-yard touch
down pass late in the second
period. A 24-yard completion
to Solomon two seconds
before halftime set up a 48-
yard field goal by Ray
Wersching, giving the 49ers a
10-0 lead.
Atlanta drove 75 yards to
score in the third period, with
William Andrews plunging one
vard for the touchdown. But
Montana's 14th touchdown
pass of the season, a three
varder to tight end Charle
Young in a crowded end zone,
sent the 49ers into a 17-7 lead
midway in the final period.
Saladin Martin intercepted a
pass by Bartkowski and re
turned the ball 30 yards to At
lanta's 27 a tew minutes later.
But 49ers cornerback Ronnie
Lott slugged Jackson just after
the interception, drawing a
penalty which got him ejected
from the game and took away
the return yardage.
That penalty, in the favor of
Atlanta, was offset by one
which went against the Falcons

in the first half.
Bartkowski threw deep to
Jackson in the second period,
and pass interference was
called on the 49ers' Martin in
side the San Francisco 10 But
Atlanta had 12 men on the
field, an official ruled, and the
ball returned to the Falcons' 30.
The 49ers' offense mounted
no scoring threat after Mon
tana's second touchdown pass
and showed 287 net yards for
the game which basically was a
defensive struggle. Atlanta,
averaging 353 yards per game,
settled for 292.
Bartkowski did not complete
a pass until the second period
and the Falcons had only one
first down, on a penalty, in the
opening quarter.
The 49ers drove 72 yards for
their first touchdown, with a
Montana pass to Dwight Clark
covering 44 yards. Hicks' first
interception, which he re
turned 20 yards, gave the 49ers
the ball at their 45 with nine
seconds left in the first half, and
Montana passed them into
position for the field goal.
Houston (AP) — Houston
quarterback John Reaves, who
missed the 1980 football season

while overcoming drug and al
cohol problems, got his foot
hall lite hack together vester
dav with a 25-vard touchdown
pass to tight end Mike Barber
in a 17-16 comeback victory
over Oakland.
"I've gone from the pits, I
was on the bottom, but . . . to
day was the greatest thrill of my
professional life," Reaves said
gleefully in the Oiler dressing
room after starting his first
game since 1978.
Reaves, plagued bv bad luck
through most of his nine-year
career, called in all his chips
with 7:20 left in the game as he
dropped back on fourth down
and calmly tossed the winning
touchdown pass to Barber in
the endzone.
"The touchdown play came
from the bench," said Reaves.
"Barber's my first and only
choice on that play. There was
a hole in there between the
corner and safety, and I put it
right between them."
Barber, who lost his starting
job this season to Dave Casper,
gathered in the touchdown
catch over the waving arms of
Raider cornerback Lester
Hayes.

Reaves, who sa\s he turned
to religion to overcome his
personal problems, said he did
not feel pressure in the game.
"The pressure came on me Fri
day, but I just talked it ott in the
name ot Jesus," Reaves said.
Reaves outperformed Oak
land quarterback Marc Wilson,
who had led a second-half
surge to a 16-10 lead.
"We expected them to come
out looking awful, but they did
a lot of things differently than
they had done on film," Wilson
said. "Thev mixed up their cov
erages real well. This was a
crucial loss for us as far as the
playoff hopes go, but so is any
other loss."
Trailing 10-3 at halftime,

Wilson hit five of six third
quarter passes to set up field
goals of 42 and 43 yards by
C hrisßahranda 12-yard touch
down run by Arthur Whit
tington.
But Reaves, starting in place
ot injured quarterback Ken
Stabler, refused to quit. Reaves
drove the Oilers 79 yards for
the winning touchdown with
key passes ot 11 and 7 yards to
rookie Mike Flolston, 13 yards
to Ken Burrough and 14 yards
to Mike Renfrow.
Tony Fritsch's 23-yard field
goal and a 1-yard touchdown
run by Earl Campbell gave the
Oilers a 10-3 halftime lead.
Bahr's 29-yard field goal ac

counted for Oakland's first
half scoring.
The victory evened Hous
ton's record at 5-5, snapping a
three-game losing streak,
while the Raiders dropped to a
4-6 standard.
Campbell finished the game
with 97 yards on 31 carries and
now hav 1011 yards for the sea
son The three-time National
Football League rushing leader
now has surpassed 1000 yards
in each of his four years in the
league.
Wilson completed 16 of 32
passes in the game for 175 yards
and two interceptions. Reaves
made the most of his rare start
ing assignment, completing 17
of 31 passes for 197 yards.

while overcoming drug and al
cohol problems, got his foot
hall lite hack together vester
dav with a 25-vard touchdown
pass to tight end Mike Barber
in a 17-16 comeback victory
over Oakland.
"I've gone from the pits, I
was on the bottom, but . . . to
day was the greatest thrill of my
professional life," Reaves said

touchdown pass to Barber in
the endzone.
"The touchdown play came
from the bench," said Reaves.
"Barber's my first and only
choice on that play. There was
a hole in there between the
corner and safety, and I put it
right between them."
Barber, who lost his starting
job this season to Dave Casper,
gathered in the touchdown
catch over the waving arms of
Raider cornerback Lester
Hayes.

Reaves, who sa\s he turned
to religion to overcome his
personal problems, said he did
not feel pressure in the game.
"The pressure came on me Fri
day, but I just talked it ott in the
name ot Jesus," Reaves said.
Reaves outperformed Oak
land quarterback Marc Wilson,
who had led a second-half
surge to a 16-10 lead.
"We expected them to come
out looking awful, but they did
a lot of things differently than
they had done on film," Wilson
said. "Thev mixed up their cov
erages real well. This was a
crucial loss for us as far as the
playoff hopes go, but so is any
other loss."

Wilson hit five of six third
quarter passes to set up field
goals of 42 and 43 yards by

drove the Oilers 79 yards for
the winning touchdown with
key passes ot 11 and 7 yards to
rookie Mike Flolston, 13 yards
to Ken Burrough and 14 yards
to Mike Renfrow.
Tony Fritsch's 23-yard field
goal and a 1-yard touchdown
run by Earl Campbell gave the
Oilers a 10-3 halftime lead.
Bahr's 29-yard field goal ac

counted for Oakland's first
half scoring.
The victory evened Hous
ton's record at 5-5, snapping a
three-game losing streak,
while the Raiders dropped to a
4-6 standard.
Campbell finished the game
with 97 yards on 31 carries and
