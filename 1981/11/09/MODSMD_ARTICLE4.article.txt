# Seminars study future of Peace Corps
## 
### Dan McMillan 
The Peace Corps is an important
instructive, apolitical tool both at
home and abroad, according to
speakers at a conference here Satur
day commemorating the 20th an
niversary of the founding of the
Peace Corps.
More than 300 returned volunteers
attended the conference. Three
themes dominated the conference:
the role of returned volunteers, the
future of the Peace Corps, and the
Global 2000 Report to former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. The all-day con
ference featured speeches and a vari
ety of seminars and workshops.
Anne Ehrlich, a Stanford research
associate in Biological Sciences, de
voted her keynote address to the
Global 2000 Report. The 1980 report
examines current trends in popu
lation, environment and resources
and gives a picture of how the world
will look in 20 years if these trends
continue.
"That picture," said Ehrlich, who
helped prepare the report, "is grim."

She stated that development of the
Third World is essential to preventing
an ecological disaster in the future.
"The Peace Corps," Ehrlich said, "is
needed now more than it ever was."
Gary Wishniewsky, who was a vol
unteer in Turkey, opened the morn
ing session and spoke about the
"third mandate" of the Peace Corps:
to educate the American people
about the Third World.
"On international issues," said
Wishniewsky, "we as a people are
terribly ignorant." He pointed out
that only one percent of American
college students study international
issues in their courses, and said that
only two percent of our high school
graduates are fluent in a foreign lan
guage.
"In a UNESCO (United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization) study which ranked
100 nations according to quality of
foreign studies," he continued, "the
U.S. placed near the bottom of the
list."

Because the world is increasingly
interdependent, concluded Wish
niewsky, the need for returned vol
unteers to educate Americans is
greater than ever.
Peace Corps Deputy Director Ev
erett Alvarez spoke about the future
of the program. "The Peace Corps
personifies the Reagan Adminis
tration approach to Third World de
velopment," he said, because it is rel
atively cheap and relies on volun
tarism.
Alvarez and others, however,
voiced concern about Peace Corps
funding. Despite inflation, the $105
million Peace Corps budget has not
increased for several years, and Con
gress is now considering a $10 million
cut.
The possible role of the Peace
Corps in intelligence gathering dis
turbed many of those present. "Dur
ing the past year, there has been
more political controversy about the
Peace Corps than at any time in my.
memory," said William Josephson,

president of the Peace Corps In
stitute.
Josephson is now fighting to sepa
rate the Peace Corps from ACTION,
the umbrella agency for volunteer
programs, including VISTA and the
Young Adult Conservation Corps.
The new director of ACTION is
Thomas Pauken, who served asa mili
tary intelligence officer in Vietnam.
