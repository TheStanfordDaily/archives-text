# Third overtime game in a row
## Card booters lose to Fresno St. 
### Adam Berns 
The last three soccer
games Stanford has played
have been decided in over
time. Saturday the chips
didn't fall in the Cardinals'
favor as they lost a tough 2-1
overtime game to Fresno
State.
The game set Stanford's
season record at 11-6-2, 2-4
in Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation play and, at this
point, the Cards have no
chance for post-season play
despite a sometimes
brilliant regular season. The
booters beat the University
of Connecticut and Seattle-
Pacific, both ranked No.l
nationally in their divisions,
but failed to play consistent
ly enough on the season to
qualify for the NCAA na
tional tournament which
Stanford hosts in Decem
ber.
Even though the Cards
lost Staturday, it wasn't a
match to be ashamed of.
The game was close the
whole way and both teams
were evenly matched. The
game pitted strenth against
strength as Stanford's high
powered offense went
against Fresno State's ex
cellent defense. Both the
Cards and the Bulldogs had
their share of excellent
plays, missed opportunities
and even a little bit of luck.
It was a game where neither
side could make excuses.

One side had to win, and
Saturday, Fresno State was
that team.
After the match, Lodge
said that he thought his
team played pretty well. "It
v\as an even match today
and I thought our players
did a good job," he said.
"This is our third overtime
match in a row and this time
things just didn't go our
way."
Cardinal midfielder
Angel Vasquez said that he
was impressed by Fresno
State's defense. "Their de
fense is strong and they pass
really well," Vasquez said.
Even though Lodge
wasn't displeased with the
performance, he did feel'
that their was ample room
for improvement. "In the
second halt, we should have
used the long pass more to
take the pressure off
ourselves," Lodge said.
"Our problem today was
that we were using only
short passes and weren't
opening our offense up
enough."
In the first few minutes of
the game, Fresno State took
control and gave Stanford a
scare. They took three quick
shots on the Stanford goal
and it took some excellent
saves by goalkeeper David
Mann to prevent the Bull
dogs from scoring.
Throughout the rest of
the first half the general

tempo of the game fluc
tuated back and forth. Even
though the Bulldogs pene
trated into Cardinal territo
ry quite often, they were
bringing in their defenders,
making them vulnerable to
Stanford's quick counters.
\fter the initial Fresno
State surge, Stanford re
minded the Bulldogs that
they have scoring threats of
their own as senior striker
Willie Guicci brokeaway on
a quick counter only to have
his shot blocked by Fresno
State goalie Kirk Shermer.
Early in the first half, Stan
ford wasted several scoring
opportunities off of their
counters because of offsides
penalties. However, Fresno
State was not about to take
any handouts either. After
looking extremely sharp
against the Cardinal de
fense, the Bulldogs missed
several scoring op
portunities.
Later in the half, Stanford
scored its first and only goal
of the day as Guicci broke
dov\nfield and made an ex
cellent pass to sophomore
)orge Titinger. Titinger then
passed back to Guicci who
booted the ball past the
Bulldog goalie. The half
ended with Stanford main
taing a 1-0 lead.
In the second half, Stan
ford seemed to let up, con
tent to sit on its lead. For a
period of fifteen to twenty

minutes, the Cardinals real
ly put themselves in a hole
and were quite lucky that
the Bulldogs didn't score.
On two separate occassions,
Fresno State had great op
portunities to score but
missed shots on a virtually
open goal. On the sidelines,
Stanford coach Nelson
Lodge was visibly upset, yell
ing to his players to take the
pressure off themselves and
open the game up.
Eventually, the Cardinals
did open it up a little bit and
started to reassert them
selves in the midfield. But,
with less than four minutes
to play, Bulldog striker Mark
Magdeleno shot the ball
past a charging David Mann
to tie the game at 1-1.
The game ended with the
score tied and went into ov
ertime. Throughout the ov
ertime period, the momen
tum shifted back and forth
with both sides having legit
imate opportunities to
score. In the first half of the
period, though, Magdeleno
broke loose and shot the
ball into the Stanford goal.
After the goal, the
Cardinals tried to battle
back, but to no avail. The
Bulldogs have one of the
best defenses in the con
ference and although Stan
ford came close, they
weren't able to score again.

team played pretty well. "It
v\as an even match today
and I thought our players
did a good job," he said.
"This is our third overtime
match in a row and this time
things just didn't go our
way."
Cardinal midfielder
Angel Vasquez said that he
was impressed by Fresno
State's defense. "Their de
fense is strong and they pass
really well," Vasquez said.
Even though Lodge
wasn't displeased with the
performance, he did feel'
that their was ample room
for improvement. "In the
second halt, we should have
used the long pass more to
take the pressure off
ourselves," Lodge said.
"Our problem today was
that we were using only
short passes and weren't
opening our offense up
enough."
In the first few minutes of
the game, Fresno State took
control and gave Stanford a
scare. They took three quick
shots on the Stanford goal
and it took some excellent
saves by goalkeeper David
Mann to prevent the Bull
dogs from scoring.
Throughout the rest of
the first half the general

tempo of the game fluc
tuated back and forth. Even
though the Bulldogs pene
trated into Cardinal territo
ry quite often, they were
bringing in their defenders,
making them vulnerable to
Stanford's quick counters.
\fter the initial Fresno
State surge, Stanford re
minded the Bulldogs that
they have scoring threats of
their own as senior striker
Willie Guicci brokeaway on
a quick counter only to have
his shot blocked by Fresno
State goalie Kirk Shermer.
Early in the first half, Stan
ford wasted several scoring
opportunities off of their
counters because of offsides
penalties. However, Fresno
State was not about to take
any handouts either. After
looking extremely sharp
against the Cardinal de
fense, the Bulldogs missed
several scoring op
portunities.
Later in the half, Stanford
scored its first and only goal
of the day as Guicci broke
dov\nfield and made an ex
cellent pass to sophomore
)orge Titinger. Titinger then
passed back to Guicci who
booted the ball past the
Bulldog goalie. The half
ended with Stanford main
taing a 1-0 lead.
In the second half, Stan
ford seemed to let up, con
tent to sit on its lead. For a
period of fifteen to twenty

minutes, the Cardinals real
ly put themselves in a hole
and were quite lucky that
the Bulldogs didn't score.
On two separate occassions,
Fresno State had great op
portunities to score but
missed shots on a virtually
open goal. On the sidelines,
Stanford coach Nelson
Lodge was visibly upset, yell
ing to his players to take the
pressure off themselves and
open the game up.
Eventually, the Cardinals
did open it up a little bit and
started to reassert them
selves in the midfield. But,
with less than four minutes
to play, Bulldog striker Mark
Magdeleno shot the ball
past a charging David Mann
to tie the game at 1-1.
The game ended with the
score tied and went into ov
ertime. Throughout the ov
ertime period, the momen
tum shifted back and forth
with both sides having legit
imate opportunities to
score. In the first half of the
period, though, Magdeleno
broke loose and shot the
ball into the Stanford goal.
After the goal, the
Cardinals tried to battle
back, but to no avail. The
Bulldogs have one of the
best defenses in the con
ference and although Stan
ford came close, they
weren't able to score again.
The last three soccer
games Stanford has played
have been decided in over
time. Saturday the chips
didn't fall in the Cardinals'
favor as they lost a tough 2-1
overtime game to Fresno
State.
The game set Stanford's
season record at 11-6-2, 2-4
in Pacific Coast Athletic As
sociation play and, at this
point, the Cards have no
chance for post-season play
despite a sometimes
brilliant regular season. The
booters beat the University
of Connecticut and Seattle-
Pacific, both ranked No.l
nationally in their divisions,
but failed to play consistent
ly enough on the season to
qualify for the NCAA na
tional tournament which
Stanford hosts in Decem
ber.
Even though the Cards
lost Staturday, it wasn't a
match to be ashamed of.
The game was close the
whole way and both teams
were evenly matched. The
game pitted strenth against
strength as Stanford's high
powered offense went
against Fresno State's ex
cellent defense. Both the
Cards and the Bulldogs had
their share of excellent
plays, missed opportunities
and even a little bit of luck.
It was a game where neither
side could make excuses.

One side had to win, and
Saturday, Fresno State was
that team.
