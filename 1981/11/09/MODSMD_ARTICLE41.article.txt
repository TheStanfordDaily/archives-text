I Losing is never quite the
mine as winning. But some
lines how you play the game
Ilakes all the difference.
I I he Stanford Women's Field
|fo(key team travelled south
laturday morning to fate San
lose State, the best hockey
Iquad on the West £oast.
I They returned Saturday af
ternoon with tired smilesofsat-
Isfaction on their faces, the
Inoral victors in the 2-1 defeat
lo the NCAA Western Regional
I hampions.
The mateh was actually even
| loser than the final <•( oie sug
gests.
[ I he Spartans opened the
k ontest in spectacular fashion,
[l aking advantage of the Cards'
newest strategic additions, San
Jose players threaded the Stan

ford man-to-man defense to
drive two goals past second
game goalie Hillary Werhane
within the first three minutes.
112 rout th.it point on it was all
(. at (final and White. I he Stan
foid players gathered them
selves up and played field
hoc key for the next 67 minutes,
giving San lose one scare after
another.
Senior Andrea Welch
summed up the team's at
titude, saying, "It was anexcit
ing game to play in — every
play we went for broke."
1 he Cardinals launched a re
lentless attack on the San Jose
State goalie, finally resulting in
a score midway through the
first half.
Sophomore link Teri Boyle
brought the ball up the right
side of the field, stic king to the

team's strategy of attacking the
weaker Spartan outside
players. She quickly centered
the ball to Patsy Huntington,
who was cutting over t he
middle from the left side. Hunt
ington, another sophomore
among the Stanford "Youth
Corps," fired the ball past the
San Jose State goalie for her
16th goal of the season, and tfie
Cards were back in it.
For the rest of the game the
Stanford team continued to at
tack, but t fie shots just
wouldn't hit.
Said Welch:"We kept poun
ding at the goalie. We had end
less shots on goal and there
were so many near-miss
es. . .the ball would miss by just
inches."
Although the Cardinal of

fense never quite found its
range in the s< •< ond half, 11 it*
Stanford defense shut San Jose
State down completely. Using
an aggressive man-to man de
fense for the first time this year,
Card defenders < ut in front of
the Spartan forwaids time and
time again to intercept the ball
and thwart the San Jose Stale
attack.
Ihe Stanford players felt
good about the outcome of
both the game and their first
season under coat h Onnie
Killefer, finishing league play
with a winning record of 3-2-1.
The Cards will head for
Hei l< eley on I hursday and try
to improve their f>-S-3 overall
record in a Hig Game against
