# Denny Green's Northwestern Wildcats: the losingest team in collegiate history

### 
Fvanston, 111. (AT) — Nor th
\\ estrm's Wildcats, responding
t.j (hants of "We're the? worst;
we're the,worst," absorbed
their 29t11 straight football loss
Saturday, setting an NCAA rec
ord for major college teams.
They did it in the style of a
loser, getting blasted by Mit hi
gan State 61-14 in a game in
which the Spartans led 41-0 at
halftirne.
When it was over, the fans
did what any other fans would
do for a team setting a letord
— they tore down the south
goal post, carried it to the east
bleac hers and tossed it over the
|( >p.
"I don't feel very good," said

first-year Coach Dennis Green.
"We v\ere outmatched the en
tire game."
Green, insisting that the
Wildcats should remain in the
Big Ten Conference, said,
"There are three parts to a
football game.
"Emotional — I thought we
were ready despite all the dis
tractions and the national cov
erage; mental — It's hard to be
perfect and there were a few
letdowns; physical — they
were just stronger than us."
T he 29 straight losses since a
27-22 victory over Wyoming in
the second game of the 1979
season erased the record of 28
set by Kansas State in 1940 and

equalled by Virginia in 1960.
Northwestern has also lost 33
straight in the Big Ten. The
Wildcats finish the season
against Ohio State and Illinois,
and there appears little hope
they will break the streak this
year.
"Every now and then some
thing mystical happens," said
Green, obviously wishing for
an upset. "But it didn't happen
today."
With representatives from
the three major television
networks covering the game in
addition to a number of news
papers and Time Magazine and
Sports Illustrated, North
western was well prepared

with hoopla.
The cry was "Stop State at
28," and the message was
printed on 25,000 buttons and
20,000 helium-filled balloons
which were to be released as
soon as Northwestern s< ored.
Northwestern scored in the
third quarter on a 14-yard pass
from Mike Kerrigan to Dave
Bahoric. But that was long after
Bryan (."lark had thrown three
touchdown passes and Morten
Andersen had kicked field
goals of 46 and 43 yards for
Michigan State.
One sign on the sidelines
read, "I ley Mom, keep the
money, send a team."
"I knew how tough the job
was when I took it," said
Green. ' I'm ready to stick in
there and light it out. I know
Northwestern is going to be a
lot belter next year."
