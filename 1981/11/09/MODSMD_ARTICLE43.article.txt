# Daily gridders slam hapless ASSU, 20-6
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
The ASSU football squad
members were so sure they
would defeat the Daily Satur
day at Roble Field they cordial
ly agreed to the Daily's request
to bring a kpg of beer to the
game.
As it turned out, they drank
to forget. A levampcd Stanford
Daily team shocked the cocky
ASSU squad 20-6, with the only
ASSU touchdown coming late
in the game after the outcome
was assured.
By winning, the Daily squad
avenged the drubbing they re
ceived last spring at the hands
of the ASSU Softball squad. By
the end of the first half, ASSU
team members were shaking

their heads in bewilderment at
the 20-0 score. Reportedly a
task force created by the ASSU
to iiwestigate the possible out
come of the game had pre
dicted a different lesult.
The Daily, led by quarter
back Mike Thurman, took over
after halting Tom Kohn and his
ASSU offense and proceeded
to make a mockery of their de
fense. Blockers Vic Goetz and
Bob Hellman kept the ASSU
out of the backfield to give
Thurman plenty of time to
throw to his receivers. The first
Daily touchdown came when
Adam Berns hauled in a 35-
yard tou< hdown pass between
two ASSU defenders. James
Higa scored the point-after

touchdown to make the score
7-0.
The Daily scored again later
when Thurman hit Matt
L'Heureux, who had burned
ASSU defensive back C litis
Greene, for a 50 yard bomb
The next time, 7 bur man took
the ball in himself on a
scramble around the left end,
and then hit "Slingin"' Sam
Howe on the next play for the
extra point Howe was ecstatic
— he thought he had scored a
touchdown. His teammates
gave him another beer.
Shocked ASSU team mem
bers offered plenty of excuses
at half time. Some blamed
Kohn's lack of protection on
the fad that the offensive line

(COP member Fred Buhl) nev
er showed up. ASSU senator
Jordan Bender said that the
women on the team were nev
er in position and he didn't
know how to handle that.
Kohn said that the ASSU just
didn't have enough athletes. "I
never said I was an athlete,"
Mark Fpstein protested.
Only in the last minutes did
the ASSU generate an offense.
After a Dave Phelps intercep
tion of a Thurman pass, Kohn
drove ASSU down the field
with a string of completions to
Phelps and Bender. Phelps
took a quick pass across the
middle for the ASSU's only
points of the day.
