Militia leader resumes post
lerusalem — Just 48 hours after the resigna
tion of Maj. Saad Haddad, the commander of
the Israeli-supported Christian militia in south
ern Lebanon, he withdrew it yesterday and re
sumed direction of the small portion of Leba
nese border territory that his forces control.
In a broadcast over the Voice of Hope radio in
southern Lebanon, Haddad also said he had
fired some officers in theeastern, predominant
ly Christian, sector of the enclave, and that he
was reorganizing the military command there.
During the previous two days, Israeli Army
liaison officers had been urging Haddad to re
consider his resignation, and Haddad said he
had also come under intense pressure from
Lebanese civilians.
On Friday, when he resigned and named an
aide, Ist Lt. Sharbal Baraqat, as his successor,
Haddad cited exhaustion and internal problems
in the enclave as contributing to his decision.
He was hospitalized in Haifa last April for ner
vous exhaustion.
The Israeli cabinet formally adopted two con
ditions yesterday for any country's participation
in a Sinai peace-keeping force.
In one condition, the cabinet declared that
the force, which will patrol the Sinai after Israeli
withdrawal April 25, will not supervise the
pullback of Israeli forces. The British foreign
secretary, Lord Carrington, has said Britain de
cided to contribute troops to the force because
it wanted to ensure the return of Arab lands to
the Arabs.
The cabinet also voted to bar participation in
the force by any nation that referred in public
statements to the European Community's Ven
ice Declaration, which spelled out the terms of
a European Middle East peace initiative.
Mubarak warns on terrorism
Cairo, Fijvpt — President Hosni Mubarak told
the nation yesterday that the assassination of
Anwar Sadat was God's warning that Egypt
should rid itself of religious terrorism. He said
the opposition's views must not be ignored, but
reminded opponents that the majority still
rules.
"It was the wisdom of heaven to make that
horrible crime a warning to Egypt to cleanse
itself of the plague" of religious terrorism,
Mubarak said of the Oct. 6 assassination of
Sadat, blamed on Moslem extremists.
The newspaper Al-Akhbar said yesterday that
70 members of underground Moslem fun
damentalist groups linked to Sadat's assassina
tion have been charged with "acts of sabotage
to overthrow the regime and possession and
use of explosives."
The latest published figures say 750 people
have been arrested in the wake of Sadat's as
sassination and ensuing clashes between fun
damentalists and police in several major cities.
Al-Akhbar also said the four men who al
legedly shot Sadat as he reviewed a military pa
rade will be indicted Wednesday.
It also r aid the supreme military court on Sat
urday started trials of "those responsible for the
military unit that the first defendant Khaled el-
Islambouly was part of."
The paper gave no indication of how many
were being tried, but said they were charged
with "not fully carrying out their duties" by al
lowing three outsiders to infiltrate the parade
with weapons and ammunition.
Official statements have said that el-lslam
bouly was backed in the charge of Sadat's stand
by three non-military men he had managed to
place on the truck under his command during
the parade.
Mubarak's statement was made in a 45-
minute policy speech to the Egyptian Par
liament. The address, which touched on a range
of domestic issues, includingthe huge subsidies
programs of Sadat, was nationally televised.

UFW lund return sought
Washington — Two federal agencies have
asked the United Farm Workers union to return
$589,000 in federal funds the agencies believe
was improperly spent, a spokesman for an Illi
nois congressman confirmed Saturday night.
Donna Harper, an aide to Rep. Henry Hyde
IR-Ill.) said the Labor and Health and Human
Services departments told Hyde earlier in the
week they had asked the union to give back the
money.
Telephones listed tor the union and for de
partment representatives were not answered
Saturday night. \ union spokesman said in Jan
uary 1980 the union welcomed any investiga
tion of its handling of the questioned 1978
grants, totaling $2 million, to union affiliates. He
said the union's performance in the matter had
been cleared by previousfederal investigations.
Harper said she was unable to say immediate
ly which parts of which grants had been dis
allowed.
According to an article in Sunday's editions of
the Chicago Tribune, the Labor Department
disallowed $259,000 of an $803,000 grant to
teach English to migrant workersand the Health
and Human Services Department disallowed
$330,000 ot a $601,692 grant to establish a micro
v\ave communications system linking union
medical clinics and service centers.
A 1979 article in the magazine Reason, pub
lished in Santa Barbara, said the union had been
able to reduce its own telephone bills because
of the microwave system, which was supposed
to serve the affiliate operating the centers.
Harper said Hyde asked for an investigation
after someone mailed him a copy of the article.
Strike talks continue
Warsaw, Poland — Despite pessimistic
statements earlier, strike leaders in Zielona
Gora province said yesterday they were hopeful
a new round of talks with the government
"could solve everything" and end Poland's
most extensive strike since the independent
union movement emerged last year.
The Roman Catholic church and Solidarity
union leaders of coal miners on strike in
Sosnowiec advanced some proposals yesterday
on the miners' demands for national television
time in hopes that stalemate could be broken.
Polish Radio reported that Solidarity had dis
patched a national official to Zielona Gora,
where about 160,000 unionists would enter
their 20th strike dav todav if no settlement was
reached.
The state-run press on Saturday quoted the
government as saying it was "futile" to attempt
to talk to the local union chapter leaders, and a
Solidarity spokesman in the southwest province
said he did not know how much longer he
could restrain tempers. The strikes erupted
over demands that the government fire state
farm managers, despite a Solidarity leadership
call for an end tothe local strikes. About 100,000
other workers on various wildcat strikes around
the country ended their work stoppages last
week. »
"We have some unofficial chances for the
talks that could solve everything." said
Stanislaw Szvmkowiak, a member of the Soli
darity strike committee in Zielona Gora. He did
not elaborate.
Polish Radio said the union headquarters in
Gdansk had sent Jozef Patyna to the scene to
help bring the sides together.
In Sosnowiec, where strikers have been pro
testing a chemical-throwing incident at a min
eshaft late last month, the miners elaborated on
their demand for a televised news conference.
The church last week boosted its involvement
in the search foranendtothenational econom
ic crisis when Archbishop Jozef Glemp met with
Solidarity national chairman Lech Walesa and
Communist Party chief and Polish Premier,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.

Winter hazards predicted
Washington — If this winter is typical of re
cent vears, more than 450 Americans could lose
their lives to the cold, weather experts warned
yesterday.
"Winter, in spite of its stark beauty, is an ex
tremely hazardous time of year,'' observed
Richard Hallgren, director of the National
Weather Service.
Winter-related deaths have jumped sharply
in recent years, according to the National Cen
ter for Health Statistics, prompting the new
warning.
Between 1949 and 1978 the cold claimed an
a\erage of 355 lives each year, but in the last 10
years that has jumped to 454 fatalities annually.
And those are only deaths directly blamed on
winter weather; the figure does not include
heart attacks while shoveling snow, asphyxia
tion in stranded autos and other indirect causes.
At least part of the increase has been blamed
bv medical analysts on the aging of the popu
lation. The median age of the country recently
passed 30 years, meaning that there are more
and more older persons, who are more sensi
tive to extreme temperatures.
In the severe winters of 1977 and 1978 the
cold claimed 652 and 634 lives respectively,
among the worst winters the nation has ever
seen.
Hallgren urged Americans to pay particular
attention to weather forecasts and warnings in
order to be prepared for storms, cold spells or
other hazards.
The record temperature decline occurred
jan. 23-24, 1916 at Browning, Montana. The
drop covered 100 degrees Fahrenheit, from 44
degrees one day to minus 56 degrees the next.
And it doesn't always take that long. On Jan.
22, 1943, for example, it was a moderate 54
degrees at 9 a.m. in Spearfish, South Dakota. But
27 minutes later the temperature had plum
meted to minus 4 degrees — a 58 degree drop.
The nation's record low is minus 79.8 degrees
set in Alaska in 1971, and in the 48 contiguous
states the record is minus 69.7 degrees at Rogers
Pass, Montana.
Indeed, Hawaii is the only state where there
has never been a minus temperature recorded.
Its low is 14, set in 1961.
Historian Durant dies
I os Angeles — Funeral services were pending
yesterday for Pulitzer Prize historian Will
Durant, who died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, just two days after his 96th
birthday.
Durant, who attributed the rise of civilization
to the religious faith of beings he regarded as no
better than "trousered apes," died without hav
ing been informed of the death of his wife and
collaborator, Ariel.
Ariel Durant, 83, died two weeks ago at the
Durants' Hollywood Hills home after a long ill
ness.
Durant was best known for the 11-volume
Sfory of Civilization, written partly with his wife.
The 10th book of that series, Rousseau and Rev
olution, won the Pulitizer Prize for literature in
1968.
The views of Durant, a former Roman Catho
lic seminarian who once claimed he was ex
communicated by the church for lecturing on
the phallic origins of religious symbols, were
often paradoxical.
Durant said he lost his Catholic faith when a
young man after reading Darwin's Origin of
Species and The Descent of Man and Marx's
Das Kapital and Communist Manifesto.

Militia leader resumes post
lerusalem — Just 48 hours after the resigna
tion of Maj. Saad Haddad, the commander of
the Israeli-supported Christian militia in south
ern Lebanon, he withdrew it yesterday and re
sumed direction of the small portion of Leba
nese border territory that his forces control.
In a broadcast over the Voice of Hope radio in
southern Lebanon, Haddad also said he had
fired some officers in theeastern, predominant
ly Christian, sector of the enclave, and that he
was reorganizing the military command there.
During the previous two days, Israeli Army
liaison officers had been urging Haddad to re
consider his resignation, and Haddad said he
had also come under intense pressure from
Lebanese civilians.
On Friday, when he resigned and named an
aide, Ist Lt. Sharbal Baraqat, as his successor,
Haddad cited exhaustion and internal problems
in the enclave as contributing to his decision.
He was hospitalized in Haifa last April for ner
vous exhaustion.
The Israeli cabinet formally adopted two con
ditions yesterday for any country's participation
in a Sinai peace-keeping force.
In one condition, the cabinet declared that
the force, which will patrol the Sinai after Israeli
withdrawal April 25, will not supervise the
pullback of Israeli forces. The British foreign
secretary, Lord Carrington, has said Britain de
cided to contribute troops to the force because
it wanted to ensure the return of Arab lands to
the Arabs.
The cabinet also voted to bar participation in
the force by any nation that referred in public
statements to the European Community's Ven
ice Declaration, which spelled out the terms of
a European Middle East peace initiative.
Mubarak warns on terrorism
Cairo, Fijvpt — President Hosni Mubarak told
the nation yesterday that the assassination of
Anwar Sadat was God's warning that Egypt
should rid itself of religious terrorism. He said
the opposition's views must not be ignored, but
reminded opponents that the majority still
rules.
"It was the wisdom of heaven to make that
horrible crime a warning to Egypt to cleanse
itself of the plague" of religious terrorism,
Mubarak said of the Oct. 6 assassination of
Sadat, blamed on Moslem extremists.
The newspaper Al-Akhbar said yesterday that
70 members of underground Moslem fun
damentalist groups linked to Sadat's assassina
tion have been charged with "acts of sabotage
to overthrow the regime and possession and
use of explosives."
The latest published figures say 750 people
have been arrested in the wake of Sadat's as
sassination and ensuing clashes between fun
damentalists and police in several major cities.
Al-Akhbar also said the four men who al
legedly shot Sadat as he reviewed a military pa
rade will be indicted Wednesday.
It also r aid the supreme military court on Sat
urday started trials of "those responsible for the
military unit that the first defendant Khaled el-
Islambouly was part of."
The paper gave no indication of how many
were being tried, but said they were charged
with "not fully carrying out their duties" by al
lowing three outsiders to infiltrate the parade
with weapons and ammunition.
Official statements have said that el-lslam
bouly was backed in the charge of Sadat's stand
by three non-military men he had managed to
place on the truck under his command during
the parade.
Mubarak's statement was made in a 45-
minute policy speech to the Egyptian Par
liament. The address, which touched on a range
of domestic issues, includingthe huge subsidies
programs of Sadat, was nationally televised.

UFW lund return sought
Washington — Two federal agencies have
asked the United Farm Workers union to return
$589,000 in federal funds the agencies believe
was improperly spent, a spokesman for an Illi
nois congressman confirmed Saturday night.
Donna Harper, an aide to Rep. Henry Hyde
IR-Ill.) said the Labor and Health and Human
Services departments told Hyde earlier in the
week they had asked the union to give back the
money.
Telephones listed tor the union and for de
partment representatives were not answered
Saturday night. \ union spokesman said in Jan
uary 1980 the union welcomed any investiga
tion of its handling of the questioned 1978
grants, totaling $2 million, to union affiliates. He
said the union's performance in the matter had
been cleared by previousfederal investigations.
Harper said she was unable to say immediate
ly which parts of which grants had been dis
allowed.
According to an article in Sunday's editions of
the Chicago Tribune, the Labor Department
disallowed $259,000 of an $803,000 grant to
teach English to migrant workersand the Health
and Human Services Department disallowed
$330,000 ot a $601,692 grant to establish a micro
v\ave communications system linking union
medical clinics and service centers.
A 1979 article in the magazine Reason, pub
lished in Santa Barbara, said the union had been
able to reduce its own telephone bills because
of the microwave system, which was supposed
to serve the affiliate operating the centers.
Harper said Hyde asked for an investigation
after someone mailed him a copy of the article.
Strike talks continue
Warsaw, Poland — Despite pessimistic
statements earlier, strike leaders in Zielona
Gora province said yesterday they were hopeful
a new round of talks with the government
"could solve everything" and end Poland's
most extensive strike since the independent
union movement emerged last year.
The Roman Catholic church and Solidarity
union leaders of coal miners on strike in
Sosnowiec advanced some proposals yesterday
on the miners' demands for national television
time in hopes that stalemate could be broken.
Polish Radio reported that Solidarity had dis
patched a national official to Zielona Gora,
where about 160,000 unionists would enter
their 20th strike dav todav if no settlement was
reached.
The state-run press on Saturday quoted the
government as saying it was "futile" to attempt
to talk to the local union chapter leaders, and a
Solidarity spokesman in the southwest province
said he did not know how much longer he
could restrain tempers. The strikes erupted
over demands that the government fire state
farm managers, despite a Solidarity leadership
call for an end tothe local strikes. About 100,000
other workers on various wildcat strikes around
the country ended their work stoppages last
week. »
"We have some unofficial chances for the
talks that could solve everything." said
Stanislaw Szvmkowiak, a member of the Soli
darity strike committee in Zielona Gora. He did
not elaborate.
Polish Radio said the union headquarters in
Gdansk had sent Jozef Patyna to the scene to
help bring the sides together.
In Sosnowiec, where strikers have been pro
testing a chemical-throwing incident at a min
eshaft late last month, the miners elaborated on
their demand for a televised news conference.
The church last week boosted its involvement
in the search foranendtothenational econom
ic crisis when Archbishop Jozef Glemp met with
Solidarity national chairman Lech Walesa and
Communist Party chief and Polish Premier,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.

Winter hazards predicted
Washington — If this winter is typical of re
cent vears, more than 450 Americans could lose
their lives to the cold, weather experts warned
yesterday.
"Winter, in spite of its stark beauty, is an ex
tremely hazardous time of year,'' observed
Richard Hallgren, director of the National
Weather Service.
Winter-related deaths have jumped sharply
in recent years, according to the National Cen
ter for Health Statistics, prompting the new
warning.
Between 1949 and 1978 the cold claimed an
a\erage of 355 lives each year, but in the last 10
years that has jumped to 454 fatalities annually.
And those are only deaths directly blamed on
winter weather; the figure does not include
heart attacks while shoveling snow, asphyxia
tion in stranded autos and other indirect causes.
At least part of the increase has been blamed
bv medical analysts on the aging of the popu
lation. The median age of the country recently
passed 30 years, meaning that there are more
and more older persons, who are more sensi
tive to extreme temperatures.
In the severe winters of 1977 and 1978 the
cold claimed 652 and 634 lives respectively,
among the worst winters the nation has ever
seen.
Hallgren urged Americans to pay particular
attention to weather forecasts and warnings in
order to be prepared for storms, cold spells or
other hazards.
The record temperature decline occurred
jan. 23-24, 1916 at Browning, Montana. The
drop covered 100 degrees Fahrenheit, from 44
degrees one day to minus 56 degrees the next.
And it doesn't always take that long. On Jan.
22, 1943, for example, it was a moderate 54
degrees at 9 a.m. in Spearfish, South Dakota. But
27 minutes later the temperature had plum
meted to minus 4 degrees — a 58 degree drop.
The nation's record low is minus 79.8 degrees
set in Alaska in 1971, and in the 48 contiguous
states the record is minus 69.7 degrees at Rogers
Pass, Montana.
Indeed, Hawaii is the only state where there
has never been a minus temperature recorded.
Its low is 14, set in 1961.
Historian Durant dies
I os Angeles — Funeral services were pending
yesterday for Pulitzer Prize historian Will
Durant, who died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, just two days after his 96th
birthday.
Durant, who attributed the rise of civilization
to the religious faith of beings he regarded as no
better than "trousered apes," died without hav
ing been informed of the death of his wife and
collaborator, Ariel.
Ariel Durant, 83, died two weeks ago at the
Durants' Hollywood Hills home after a long ill
ness.
Durant was best known for the 11-volume
Sfory of Civilization, written partly with his wife.
The 10th book of that series, Rousseau and Rev
olution, won the Pulitizer Prize for literature in
1968.
The views of Durant, a former Roman Catho
lic seminarian who once claimed he was ex
communicated by the church for lecturing on

Durant, who died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, just two days after his 96th
birthday.
Durant, who attributed the rise of civilization
to the religious faith of beings he regarded as no
better than "trousered apes," died without hav
ing been informed of the death of his wife and
collaborator, Ariel.
Ariel Durant, 83, died two weeks ago at the
Durants' Hollywood Hills home after a long ill
ness.
Durant was best known for the 11-volume
Sfory of Civilization, written partly with his wife.
The 10th book of that series, Rousseau and Rev
olution, won the Pulitizer Prize for literature in
1968.
The views of Durant, a former Roman Catho
lic seminarian who once claimed he was ex
communicated by the church for lecturing on
the phallic origins of religious symbols, were
often paradoxical.
Durant said he lost his Catholic faith when a
young man after reading Darwin's Origin of
Species and The Descent of Man and Marx's
Das Kapital and Communist Manifesto.

Militia leader resumes post
lerusalem — Just 48 hours after the resigna
tion of Maj. Saad Haddad, the commander of
the Israeli-supported Christian militia in south
ern Lebanon, he withdrew it yesterday and re
sumed direction of the small portion of Leba
nese border territory that his forces control.
In a broadcast over the Voice of Hope radio in
southern Lebanon, Haddad also said he had
fired some officers in theeastern, predominant
ly Christian, sector of the enclave, and that he
was reorganizing the military command there.
During the previous two days, Israeli Army
liaison officers had been urging Haddad to re
consider his resignation, and Haddad said he
had also come under intense pressure from
Lebanese civilians.
On Friday, when he resigned and named an
aide, Ist Lt. Sharbal Baraqat, as his successor,
Haddad cited exhaustion and internal problems
in the enclave as contributing to his decision.
He was hospitalized in Haifa last April for ner
vous exhaustion.
The Israeli cabinet formally adopted two con
ditions yesterday for any country's participation
in a Sinai peace-keeping force.
In one condition, the cabinet declared that
the force, which will patrol the Sinai after Israeli
withdrawal April 25, will not supervise the
pullback of Israeli forces. The British foreign
secretary, Lord Carrington, has said Britain de
cided to contribute troops to the force because
it wanted to ensure the return of Arab lands to
the Arabs.
The cabinet also voted to bar participation in
the force by any nation that referred in public
statements to the European Community's Ven
ice Declaration, which spelled out the terms of
a European Middle East peace initiative.
Mubarak warns on terrorism
Cairo, Fijvpt — President Hosni Mubarak told
the nation yesterday that the assassination of
Anwar Sadat was God's warning that Egypt
should rid itself of religious terrorism. He said
the opposition's views must not be ignored, but
reminded opponents that the majority still
rules.
"It was the wisdom of heaven to make that
horrible crime a warning to Egypt to cleanse
itself of the plague" of religious terrorism,
Mubarak said of the Oct. 6 assassination of
Sadat, blamed on Moslem extremists.
The newspaper Al-Akhbar said yesterday that
70 members of underground Moslem fun
damentalist groups linked to Sadat's assassina
tion have been charged with "acts of sabotage
to overthrow the regime and possession and
use of explosives."
The latest published figures say 750 people
have been arrested in the wake of Sadat's as
sassination and ensuing clashes between fun
damentalists and police in several major cities.
Al-Akhbar also said the four men who al
legedly shot Sadat as he reviewed a military pa
rade will be indicted Wednesday.
It also r aid the supreme military court on Sat
urday started trials of "those responsible for the
military unit that the first defendant Khaled el-
Islambouly was part of."
The paper gave no indication of how many
were being tried, but said they were charged
with "not fully carrying out their duties" by al
lowing three outsiders to infiltrate the parade
with weapons and ammunition.
Official statements have said that el-lslam
bouly was backed in the charge of Sadat's stand
by three non-military men he had managed to
place on the truck under his command during
the parade.
Mubarak's statement was made in a 45-
minute policy speech to the Egyptian Par
liament. The address, which touched on a range
of domestic issues, includingthe huge subsidies
programs of Sadat, was nationally televised.

UFW lund return sought
Washington — Two federal agencies have
asked the United Farm Workers union to return
$589,000 in federal funds the agencies believe
was improperly spent, a spokesman for an Illi
nois congressman confirmed Saturday night.
Donna Harper, an aide to Rep. Henry Hyde
IR-Ill.) said the Labor and Health and Human
Services departments told Hyde earlier in the
week they had asked the union to give back the
money.
Telephones listed tor the union and for de
partment representatives were not answered
Saturday night. \ union spokesman said in Jan
uary 1980 the union welcomed any investiga
tion of its handling of the questioned 1978
grants, totaling $2 million, to union affiliates. He
said the union's performance in the matter had
been cleared by previousfederal investigations.
Harper said she was unable to say immediate
ly which parts of which grants had been dis
allowed.
According to an article in Sunday's editions of
the Chicago Tribune, the Labor Department
disallowed $259,000 of an $803,000 grant to
teach English to migrant workersand the Health
and Human Services Department disallowed
$330,000 ot a $601,692 grant to establish a micro
v\ave communications system linking union
medical clinics and service centers.
A 1979 article in the magazine Reason, pub
lished in Santa Barbara, said the union had been
able to reduce its own telephone bills because
of the microwave system, which was supposed
to serve the affiliate operating the centers.
Harper said Hyde asked for an investigation
after someone mailed him a copy of the article.
Strike talks continue
Warsaw, Poland — Despite pessimistic
statements earlier, strike leaders in Zielona
Gora province said yesterday they were hopeful
a new round of talks with the government
"could solve everything" and end Poland's
most extensive strike since the independent
union movement emerged last year.
The Roman Catholic church and Solidarity
union leaders of coal miners on strike in
Sosnowiec advanced some proposals yesterday
on the miners' demands for national television
time in hopes that stalemate could be broken.
Polish Radio reported that Solidarity had dis
patched a national official to Zielona Gora,
where about 160,000 unionists would enter
their 20th strike dav todav if no settlement was
reached.
The state-run press on Saturday quoted the
government as saying it was "futile" to attempt
to talk to the local union chapter leaders, and a
Solidarity spokesman in the southwest province
said he did not know how much longer he
could restrain tempers. The strikes erupted
over demands that the government fire state
farm managers, despite a Solidarity leadership
call for an end tothe local strikes. About 100,000
other workers on various wildcat strikes around
the country ended their work stoppages last
week. »
"We have some unofficial chances for the
talks that could solve everything." said
Stanislaw Szvmkowiak, a member of the Soli
darity strike committee in Zielona Gora. He did
not elaborate.
Polish Radio said the union headquarters in
Gdansk had sent Jozef Patyna to the scene to
help bring the sides together.
In Sosnowiec, where strikers have been pro
testing a chemical-throwing incident at a min
eshaft late last month, the miners elaborated on
their demand for a televised news conference.
The church last week boosted its involvement
in the search foranendtothenational econom
ic crisis when Archbishop Jozef Glemp met with
Solidarity national chairman Lech Walesa and
Communist Party chief and Polish Premier,
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.

Winter hazards predicted
Washington — If this winter is typical of re
cent vears, more than 450 Americans could lose
their lives to the cold, weather experts warned
yesterday.
"Winter, in spite of its stark beauty, is an ex
tremely hazardous time of year,'' observed
Richard Hallgren, director of the National
Weather Service.
Winter-related deaths have jumped sharply
in recent years, according to the National Cen
ter for Health Statistics, prompting the new
warning.
Between 1949 and 1978 the cold claimed an
a\erage of 355 lives each year, but in the last 10
years that has jumped to 454 fatalities annually.
And those are only deaths directly blamed on
winter weather; the figure does not include
heart attacks while shoveling snow, asphyxia
tion in stranded autos and other indirect causes.
At least part of the increase has been blamed
bv medical analysts on the aging of the popu
lation. The median age of the country recently
passed 30 years, meaning that there are more
and more older persons, who are more sensi
tive to extreme temperatures.
In the severe winters of 1977 and 1978 the
cold claimed 652 and 634 lives respectively,
among the worst winters the nation has ever
seen.
Hallgren urged Americans to pay particular
attention to weather forecasts and warnings in
order to be prepared for storms, cold spells or
other hazards.
The record temperature decline occurred
jan. 23-24, 1916 at Browning, Montana. The
drop covered 100 degrees Fahrenheit, from 44
degrees one day to minus 56 degrees the next.
And it doesn't always take that long. On Jan.
22, 1943, for example, it was a moderate 54
degrees at 9 a.m. in Spearfish, South Dakota. But
27 minutes later the temperature had plum
meted to minus 4 degrees — a 58 degree drop.
The nation's record low is minus 79.8 degrees
set in Alaska in 1971, and in the 48 contiguous
states the record is minus 69.7 degrees at Rogers
Pass, Montana.
Indeed, Hawaii is the only state where there
has never been a minus temperature recorded.
Its low is 14, set in 1961.

22, 1943, for example, it was a moderate 54
degrees at 9 a.m. in Spearfish, South Dakota. But
27 minutes later the temperature had plum
meted to minus 4 degrees — a 58 degree drop.
The nation's record low is minus 79.8 degrees
set in Alaska in 1971, and in the 48 contiguous
states the record is minus 69.7 degrees at Rogers
Pass, Montana.
Indeed, Hawaii is the only state where there
has never been a minus temperature recorded.
Its low is 14, set in 1961.
Historian Durant dies
I os Angeles — Funeral services were pending
yesterday for Pulitzer Prize historian Will
Durant, who died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, just two days after his 96th
birthday.
Durant, who attributed the rise of civilization
to the religious faith of beings he regarded as no
better than "trousered apes," died without hav
ing been informed of the death of his wife and
collaborator, Ariel.
Ariel Durant, 83, died two weeks ago at the
Durants' Hollywood Hills home after a long ill
ness.
Durant was best known for the 11-volume
Sfory of Civilization, written partly with his wife.
The 10th book of that series, Rousseau and Rev
olution, won the Pulitizer Prize for literature in
1968.
The views of Durant, a former Roman Catho
lic seminarian who once claimed he was ex
communicated by the church for lecturing on
the phallic origins of religious symbols, were
often paradoxical.
Durant said he lost his Catholic faith when a
young man after reading Darwin's Origin of
Species and The Descent of Man and Marx's
Das Kapital and Communist Manifesto.
