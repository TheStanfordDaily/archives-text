VDT training
Today at 2:30, the technology super
indent will share with all Dai/y staffers
who would like to learn more about
the typesetting system some basic
lessons in operating the terminals.
Today's session is only for regular
staffers who have not yet been
trained on the system but do have ex
perience working on the paper. Top
ics to be covered include, "How nev

er to do this:
*$$$???BBBBBBBBBBB,"
"Crashing the sytem for fun and prof
it" and "Marx's theory of exploita
tion as developed by a core group of
journalistic comrades late one night
when the means of production over
threw the ends." Seriously, though,
new writers are cordially invited to
get the training so that they may be
gin inputing stories more efficiently.
