# Simon is charged
## 
### 
Senior Robert Simon, driver of the
automobile which crashed Oct. 30,
killing two other students, was ar
raigned Friday and charged with two
counts of felony vehicular man
slaughter and with one count of felo
ny drunk driving.
Simon, 21, is scheduled to enter a
plea on Dec. 18 to the charges filed
against him.
Palo Alto Municipal Court Judge
Edward Scoyen released Simon on
his own recognizance, despite the
request of the Santa Clara County
district attorney that bail be set at
$35,000. According to the affadavit,
the high bail request was prompted
by the fact that Simon is a Canadian
citizen, and it was feared that he
might try to leave the country. How
ever, the judge said he had no reason
to believe that Sjmon would flee. In
addition, Scoyen acknowledged that
if he jailed Simon, the county would
be responsible for his medical bills.
The University senior was injured
in the accident which took the lives
of Michael Becker, 20, and Kevin
MacMillan, 20, after the Datsun
280ZX which Simon was driving
crashed into a tree at the intersection
of Campus Drive and Lomita Drive at
1:15 a.m. on Oct. 30.
Simon could face more than four
years in prison if convicted of the
charges.
