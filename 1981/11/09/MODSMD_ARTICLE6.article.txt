# Delays prompt Aid Office changes
## 
### Katherine Brown 
Month and a half time lags in the
delivery of financial aid have
prompted a major restructuring of
the Office of Financial Aids, accord
ing to its director Robert Huff.
The three new operating divisions
are: awards and counseling, process
ing and dispersement, and resource
utilization and employment. Vincent
De Anda has been appointed acting
associate director and is responsible
for overall management with Huff.
In addition to the problem of time
lags, the lack of space and staff neces
sitated the hiring of 30 temporary
employees last summer to process
Guaranteed Student Loans, Huff said.
Besides delivering aid to students
more efficiently, Huff said another
long-term goal is to update the pres
ent computer system (Oasis IBM

-135). According to Huff this would
change the 'batch' or key punch sys
tem to an 'on-line' system which
would automatically credit loans,
grants and scholarships to the stu
dent's account.
"Ultimately, converting to an on
line system would eliminate a lot of
paperwork â€” that is, credit cards or
'chits' for aid, and the extra deferr
ment charges that are sometimes er
roneously applied to an aid portion
of a bill," Huff said.
The awards and counseling
division, directed by Roberta John
son, does packaging, need analysis,
award adjustment, loan interviewing,
emergency loan authorization, pub
lication and most importantly, advis
ing students who come to the walk
up window. The resource utilization
and employment unit, directed by

Mary Roberts, assigns and authorizes
scholarships and grants, reports back
to donors, and is the liaison for the
federally funded Basic Education
Opportunity Grant, California State
Grants, and private funding sources.
This division of financial aids also
processes the work-study (federally
funded) payroll.
The processing and disbursement
unit prepares, distributes, collects
and tracks applications for aid. It also
maintains student files, disburses
awards and communicates directly
with student accounting. (It is hoped
that the nrw computer system will
reduce the work load in this depart
ment.)
Although none of these duties is
new, the internal office structure dif
fers substantially from the original Fi
nancial Aids Office. In 1958, the Dean
of Students' office opened up a new
department: the Financial Aids Of
fice. The focus for the first five years
was primarily on gift aid scholarships,
grants and fellowships. Jobs and
loans wee considered as sup
plementary forms of student as
sistance. The combining of aid forms
into 'packages' as known today had
barely begun.
When the federal government
began appropriating millions of
dollars for loans, grants and jobs, the
situation changed. In 1966 a National
Direct Student Loan Program and a

new Federally Insured Loan Program
increased the processing work load.
By 1966 there were nine people in the
department. In 1967 a full-time coun
selor was hired to help students un
derstand and effectively coordinate
the various aid options in their pack
ages. In the 70s a programmer ana
lyst was appointed to work with the
new automated data processing sys
tem.
In the fall of 1979, discussion and
analysis for the reorganization of the
financial aids office began. The con
sensus was to change from a pro
grammatic to a more functional
scheme.
