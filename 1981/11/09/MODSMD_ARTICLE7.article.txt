# 'War radical' Franklin teaching at Rutgers
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
It has been almost 10 years since
H. Bruce Franklin was fired from
the University.
The tenured English professor
was the cause of University tur
moil before his suspension on
February 12, 1971 until his dis
missal in January 1972. Stanford
contended that three anti-Viet
nam War speeches Franklin de
livered were inflammatory and in
cited students to violence.
Today, Franklin, 47, lives in New
Jersey. He Isa tenured English pro
fessor at Rutgers University. He
teaches "Literature of the Third
World," "Forces of Modern Liter
ature," and a science fiction
course and a honors course. This
year, however, Franklin has taken
a leave of absence.
Franklin's firing is still in the
news. His dismissal has been the
subject of a court battle for 10
years. Franklin wants the courts to
overturn the University's decision
and Stanford continues to abide
by its 1972 action, which has been
upheld so far.
A 1955 magna cum laude gradu
ate of Amherst College, Franklin
came here in 1961 to earn his
Ph.D. and was soon made an assis
tant professor of English, special
izing in Herman Melville's liter
ature.
In March 1966, Franklin and
about 70 others opposed to the
Vietnam War, took part in a pro
test over the construction of a
proposed napalm plant near
Redwood City. Franklin spoke
before the crowd against the pro
posal. The proposal was ap
proved.
The same year, Franklin went
overseas to teach at the University
campus in France. There, he and
his wife Jane set up a Marxist-

Leninist study group. He came
back the next year proclaiming
himself a Marxist-Leninist.
Then came the events which led
to Franklin's dismissal.
On January 11, 1971, 50 people,
including Franklin, demonstrated
outside Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
protesting a scheduled speech by
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge.
The disruption forced the speech
to be cancelled.
Richard Lyman, University pres
ident at the time, promptly an
nounced Franklin would be sus
pended the following quarter for
deliberately contributing to the
disruption. Franklin said he partic
ipated because he wanted Lodge
to answer to the "massacre of the
men, women and children of My
Lai, the fire bomb and herbicide
raids on the countryside of Viet
nam, Laos and Cambodia."
On February 10, Franklin spoke
in a rally outside the Stanford
Computation Center. Franklin
said the center was making print
outs of planned air attacks on
Vietnam. In his speech he said
people should "shut down the
most obvious machinery of war,
such as. . . that Computation Cen
ter." He referred to the center as
"a good target."
Shortlv after the rally the center
was occupied, and the police
were called in to disperse the oc
cupation. Several pfople were ar
rested.
Later that night, Franklin de
livered two speeches at the court
yard in front of the Old Union.
Shortlv thereafter, two incidents
of violence took place.
"The Board of Trustees im
mediately suspended Franklin
saying "His speeches sought to
generate further hostility .... His
