## Thorny Nambia talks nearing resolution 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — After
two years of stalemate, there is
guarded optimism among
Western diplomats that a solu
tion to the Namibia problem —
Africa's last and longest inde
pendence struggle — may be
achieved next year.
Western diplomats who have
long followed attempts to
achieve independence for the
South African-controlled terri
tory say the atmosphere for a
settlement is more positive
than at any time during years of
tortuous negotiations.
The remarks, however, are

hedged with caution and warn
ings that many pitfalls still lie
ahead.
A Zimbabwean official said,
"I think South Africa still has
several tricks up its sleeve."
Potential obstacles
Talks could break down over
opposition in both South
Africa and Namibia over
Western-proposed guidelines
for an independence Constitu
tion. The details of a cease-fire
and deployment of a U.N.
peace-keeping force, which
South Africa opposes, are also
potential hazards to hopes for
implementing an agreement

next year.
Nevertheless, there has been
an unmistakable mood of op
timism among the represent
atives of five Western nations
— the United States, Britain,
France, West Germany and
Canada — during their current
10-nation, 11-day negotiating
tour of Africa.
The diplomats were in a
chipper mood at a press con
ference in Salisbury, and in
Maputo, Mozambique, they
reportedly had a friendly meet
ing ■ with President Samora
Machel. Machel particularly
asked to meet the head of the
U.S. delegation, Assistant Sec
retary of State Chester
Crocker, whom he snubbed in
April.
A Western diplomat in
volved in the talks said, "I think
we are closer to reality (in a set
tlement) than ever before,"
adding that remarks last week
by South African Foreign Min
ister Roelof Botha were "the
most positive" he had heard in
years.
South Atrican hopes
Botha said there was a real
chance of a settlement coming
from the latest initiative and
that a failure could strain South
Africa's relations with Wash
ington. He added that if the

Southwest Africa People's Or
ganization (SWAPO), the guer
rilla group fighting for inde
pendence, won free and fair
elections, that result would
have to be accepted.
Just a few months ago he said
South Africa would never allow
an independent Namibia to be
ruled by Soviet-backed
SWAPO.
Botha's latest remarks, and
the fact that South Africa ap
parently did not raise any ma
jor objections to the proposed
constitutional guidelines pre
sented by the Western five,

!ond credibility to the private
claims of some South African
officials that Pretoria has de
cided to reach an international
settlement in Namibia.
Under Crocker's leadership,
the Western nations have em
barked on a new negotiating
method for Namibia with
South Africa and the"internal"
parties it supports, on the one
hand, SVVAPO and its African
backers on the other.
Separate topics
The talks have been broken
up into separate phases on the
constitution and the cease-fire,
reminiscent of the successful
method used by British Foreign
Secretary Lord Carrington two
years ago in ending the 15-
year-long Zimbabwe inde
pendence struggle.
Crocker, who said this week
that "the negotiating process is
back on the road," has limited
this phase of the talks to the
constitutional guidelines. "It is
quite possible in a matter of
weeks or a couple months that
we would have this phase of
the process near to con
clusion," he said in Salisbury.
The second phase is likely to
be more difficult, but success
in the first phase could build
momentum and make it harder

for any of the parties to back
out.
The African states and
SWAPO are expected to re
main publicly noncommittal
and wait for some tangible sign
from Pretoria that its coopera
tion is sincere.
If serious right-wing opposi
tion emerges, Prime Minister
P.VV. Botha can always pull the
rug out from under tfie talks by
having the internal parties ob
ject to the terms. One hundred
thousand whites are presently
living in the Namibian territo
