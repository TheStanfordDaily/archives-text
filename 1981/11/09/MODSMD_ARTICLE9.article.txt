# Pact with Czechs to end war claims
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Czechoslo
vakia agreed late last week to
accept U.S. terms for com
pensation claims for American
property seized by Communist
authorities, apparently clear
ing the way for the return to
Prague of 18 tons of gold held
by the Allies since the end of
World War 11, now worth $250
million.
Negotiators for the two gov
ernments initialed an agree
ment in Prague providing for
an $81.5 million Czechoslovak
settlement of the U.S. claims,
four times the amount Czecho
slovakia offered to pay in a 1974
agreement that was rejected by
Congress, according to sources
here.
The agreement, which
would end a decades-old dis
pute between the two coun
tries, is contingent on U.S. con
gressional approval and also on
the successful outcome of simi
lar British negotiations with
Czechoslovakia.
British settlement
U.S. officials, however, were
optimistic about getting con
gressional approval and said
Britain, which is to begin new
negotiations with Prague next
week, has "made a lot of
progress" toward its agree
ment.
Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D-
N.Y.) is the chief congressional
sponsor of the bill, which
would allow the United States

to sell the Czechoslovak gold
and use interest from the pro
ceeds to compensate the clai
mants.
A U.S. official in Washington
said the agreement signaled no
particular improvement in the
long-chilly relations between
the two governments but re
moved a major obstacle. "Our
motivation was getting money
for aging claimants," he said.
Previous rejections
Senate rejections of nego
tiated agreements in 1964 and
1974 were followed by chills in
relations between the two
countries, including U.S. de
nial of most-favored-nation
tariff treatment for Czechoslo
vakia and a slowdown in trade
and cultural exchanges.
The gold was part of a vast
store seized by the Nazis from
Czechoslovakia and other
countries in the late 1930s and
early 19405. After World War II
the Allies captured it and a
tripartite commission of the
United States, Britain and
France was formed to handle
its return.
The return was complicated
when communist governments
gained control in the countries
that formerly owned the gold
and confiscated property, in
cluding homes and factories,
owned by U.S. citizens. Over
the years, agreements were
reached with Hungary, Roma
nia and other countries.
