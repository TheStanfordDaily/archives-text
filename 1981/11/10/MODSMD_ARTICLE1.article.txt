## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Michael Becker and Kevin Mac-
Millan left Encina Station on campus
at approximately 1:05 a.m. Oct. 30,10
minutes before paramedicsarrived at
the accident scene where they died
in a car crash near the intersection of
Campus and Lomita drives.
They died while heading north
away from University Drive.
They were accompanied by an un
identified third man, according to a
report of the events at the Station by
Amy Junge, one of Encina's night
managers.
Becker and MacMillan, both 20, ar
rived at Encina Station at approx
imately 12:55, attempting to
purchase beer.
After being told Encina Station
closed at 12:30, they insisted they
came to the Station "every Thursday
night for beer and sour cream potato
chips," Junge said in the report. They
then pushed their way in through the
doorway, according to the report.
Junge said all customers and the
guitarist had left at approximately
12:35, leaving only lunge and Station
employees Peter Simonson and Steve
Wall.
After knocking on the front door,
which was locked, MacMillan asked
if Haley Firestone, another assistant
night manager of the Station, was
there. Junge opened the door "a lit
tle" and told him Firestone was not
there, Junge's report read. Mac-
Millan then asked if the three of
them could get some beer.
An argument and physical contact
between MacMillan and Wall
ensued. "Then I tried pleading with
the third male to persuade Kevin and
Michael to go home, but he replied
that he 'didn't know them,' " Junge
said in her report.
Simonson told the Daily last night
that Becker and MacMillan were
slurring their words. The third guy
helped us to get them out of there.
He was rational and wasn't obnox

ious at all. There was no doubt in my
mind 'Hat he was the most coherent
and rational and reasonable of the
three," Simonson said.
According to Junge's report, the
scuffle between MacMillan and Wall
resulted in Wall's threatening to call
the police. "Michael (Becker) and
the third male walked out in re
sponse to Steve (Wall)'s remark
about calling the police." MacMillan
lingered "another minute" and then
followed the others.
Junge closed and locked the door
and told Simonson to tell Wall that
the three men had left and that he
could cancel the report to the police,
according to Junge's report.
The car in which the two died was
driven by Robert Simon, 21, another
student here. Simon was arraigned
Friday and charged with two counts
of vehicular manslaughter and one
count of felony drunk driving. A
fourth passenger in the car, Gary
Shumway, left it before the accident.
Shumway has declined to comment
on the night's events, and Simon
could not be reached by the Daily.
None of the Encina employees has
identified the third person.
Jung's report was no made avail
able to the Daily until 9:45 p.m. yes
terday.
The police record stated that
Becker and MacMillan were "verbal
ly abusive and combative" and that a
pushing and shoving match ensued
when they were refused entrance.
Regarding Becker's and Mac-
Millan's claim to have previously
bought alcohol from Encina after
closing hours, which was reported in
the Peninsula Times Tribune on Sat
urday, Simonson said, "The im
pression I got was that they were only
telling us that because they wanted
to come in."
Junge said she could not comment
on the possibility of Becker and Mac-
Millan having previously bought al
cohol after closing hours.
In response to questions about

why MacMillan and Becker were
looking for her, Firestone said, "I was
the manager. I knew them from out
side. They were just friends of mine
and whenever they came into Encina
they would talk to me.
"They came in about three times
since the beginning of school. I never
drank with them," Firestone said,
adding that she worked behind the
bar, but never served them.
"If they got served, they got
served," she said, referring to the
previous times they came to Encina.
"I don't remember clearly."
Regarding Encina's actual carding
procedures, Firestone said, "No, we
don't card everybody. We card at our
discretion. It used to be a lot looser
around here, but since the summer
