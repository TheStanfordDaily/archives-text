Who could love a scrawny little guy
like Dupie? His creator and his manager
do, not to mention thousands of col
lege students and others all across the
( nuntry.
Gil Morales, a 1981 Stanford graduate
and creator of the cartoon strip Dupie,
and Brett Kingstone, former Stanford
student and Dupie's manager, together
run the Dupie Press. Their book Dupie
is presently being sold in college and
major bookstores across the country,
has grossed more than $30,000 worth of
sales in just the first month and is now
going into its third printing.
This just the beginning, according to
Morales and Kingstone. They see them
selves and the Dupie Press as growing
into a more "creative force," influential
over the next few years.
Morales said he hopes to syndicate
the comic strip Dupie and views his
bookasa launching pad not only for the
cartoon strip, but for his own career.
Kingstone, the aggressiv'e marketer
and financer of the Dupie Press, wants
to build it into "the publishing com
pany on the vanguard." He said he is
willing to take risks on new, young and
"good" talent presently overlooked by
the big publishing companies.
In the past month and a half, the
Dupie Press has received more than two

dozen manuscripts, and is presently ne
gotiating two possible deals, including
publishing a collection of cartoons
from colleges all over the country.
By working with a network of inde
pendent printers and graphics special
ists, Morales and King'stone believe
they are tapping "the most talented

people." Leon Seltzer, president of the
Stanford University Press, handlesall le
gal matters and "does more in five
minutes than most attorneys do in a
day," they said.
What made Morales turn down a lu
crative position with Caterpillar Trac
tors and Kingstone defer admission into
the Stanford MBA program to start the
Dupie Press? The pair admit they took a
big risk, but felt that the time was right
for the Dupie sensation to hit the col
lege markets. Not enamored with the
idea of a 9-to-5 day, they could now "be
wild for a little while" and "have some
fun" with their new company.
Despite support from friends, faculty,
the National Association of College
Bookstores and the Stanford Bookstore,
the pair has had to face some problems.
Attempts to "buy them out" and slow
cash flows from some distributors have
been major obstacles.- Morales especial
ly fears coming across with a "make
money off of everything image," he
said.
But the Dupie Press rolls on.
The 300 hand-drawn original car
toons done for The Stanford Daily and
Dupie will be available exclusively at
the Stanford Bookstore.
Morales will be on hand to autograph
Dupie at the Stanford Bookstore later
this week.
