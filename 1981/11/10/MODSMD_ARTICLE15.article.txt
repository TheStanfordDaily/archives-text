## Editorial Create rules for groups 
### 
The recent suspension of the Zeta Psi (Zete)
fraternity has brought to light a potentially
dangerous lack of consistent policy in University
disciplinary action against student groups.
Regardless of the merits of the decision in the
Zete case, the Daily agrees with last week's ASSU
Senate resolution declaring the process by
which the Zete sanctions were imposed in
violation of individual student rights.
Student groups, just as individual students
always have been, should be informed of the
standards by which their conduct isjudged and,
when brought to question, how disciplinary
decisions will be made. Naturally, some
correlation between group and individual rights
must be maintained.
The Student Conduct Legislative Council, an
11-member student -faculty panel charged
with forming policies for University/student
interaction, wisely has agreed to meet today to
try to set such standards.
A written policy on the procedure for
disciplinary action against student groups would
benefit both students and administration in
three main ways: clarity, legitimacy, and finality.
The importance of clear understanding by
both sides how such matters will be handled

cannot be underestimated. The Honor Code
and Fundamental Standard have long provided
a clearoutlineof what individual student
conduct is considered an infraction and of what
steps are taken in due process to resolve the
matter. It seems only logical that similar
published proceduresshould exist for groups,
for the sakeof both fairnessand efficiency.
Once such a consistent approach is taken all
accusations of arbitrary sanctions stand moot.
Left in each new case to the "best judgment" of
the University official(s) bringing charges,
however, procedures leading up to sanctions
cannot help but seem arbitrary.
And most importantly, this new policy should
clearly outline the avenues of appeal available
once sanctions have been imposed. This will
prevent the nearly endless appeal-to-any
outlet-that-will-listen approach often taken in
the absence of specific responsibility for such
hearings.
For these reasons, we urge the SCLC today to
responsibly consider the guidelines necessary
for dealing with group discipline in the future
and to introduce these guidelines in line with
the Fundamental Standard as quickly as
possible.
