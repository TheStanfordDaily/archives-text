## Voting rights must remain protected by our civil liberties 
### 
"The right to vote is the crown jewel of
American liberties . . ." The line seems to
echo from the pages of history. One can
almost envision Abraham Lincoln as he
stares from a White House window, looking
out upon a strife-torn land. Suddenly, as the
fires in Richmond rage, the great Eman
cipator trembles with anger. He vows to fight
until peace and equality are enjoyed by all.
Or perhaps Martin Luther King Jr. included
this telling statement in his "I have a dream
.. speech, declaring to hundreds of
thousands of supporters that civil rights can
not be denied to any person.
Surprisingly enough, it was no great pon
tificator of civil liberties, but only mild-man
nered Ronald Reagan who mouthed those
fiery words. Reagan was speaking in regards
to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 which comes
up for review this August. He stated that he
will support an extension of the act either
"through a direct extension of the act or
through a modified version of the new bill
recently passed by the House of Represent
atives."

The bill the House of Representatives has
passed would allow a "bail-out" provision to
the "pre-clearance" requirement of the Act.
The pre-clearance section of the act requires
certain states and countries to clear any
charges in their voting rights provisions with
the Justice Department before enacting
these changes. The requirement is directed
against states with a more enlightened his
tory of minority rights, such as Alabama and
Mississippi. These states had a history of
abuse of voting rights, employing devices
like the poll tax to exclude minority voters.
The House bill says that states and counties
may be released from the pre-clearance re
quirement if they can prove they have com
plied with the act for 10 years. In addition,
they must prove that they have made "con
structive efforts" to encourage the political
participation by minority groups.
The president heartily endorses this
change, but he feels it does not go far
enough. When a discrimination suit alleging
a violation of voting rights is filed presently,
only the effects of the discrimination must

be proved. That is, the plaintiff must prove
that voting rights were actually denied. The
president, with support in the Senate, de
sires to change the test to one of intention —
the intent to discriminate must be proved. If
this test is ever made law, it will make the
prosecution of voting discrimination next to
impossible.

In a democracy such as exists in the United States, the
majority rules — that is, it usually does. It does not rule
when it becomes exclusionary, when individual rights are
threatened by popular opinion.

If the House bill becomes law, which it
most likely will, it may be passed only with
the inclusion of Reagan's "intent to dis
criminate" test. There is a widespread en
thusiasm among Southern senators to revise
the bill and make it less stringent on their
own states. No doubt they see the "pre-

clearance" requirement as a violation of
states' rights and an insult to their states'
character.
Unfortunately, the Justice Department's
power to oversee these states' voting laws
stems from actual abuses. If the bail-out pro
vision becomes law, individuals will have no
recourse but through local courts, which,

because they are elected, reflect the biases
of the surrounding population. If this should
happen, we will have a tyranny of the majori
ty-
In a democracy such as exists in the United
States, the majority vote rules — that is, it
usually does. It does not rule when it be

comes exclusionary, when individual rights
are threatened by the overwhelming flow of
popular opinion. That is the reason for judi
cial review. That is the reason why adoption
of the bail-out rule is dangerous. It is too easy
to smother civil liberties under the weight of
the great public beast.
Civil liberties are meant to keep the public
from harming itself. You see, the public can
be wrong. Witness the Salem witch hunts,
slavery, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Japanese-
American incarceration in World War 11, the
McCarthy anti-communist hysteria, the Cold
War, and every lynch mob that ever took the
law into its own hands. As Justice Thomas
Clark, former justice of the United States Su
preme Court, said, "Nothing can destroy a
government more quickly than its failure to
observe its own laws." That is the people's
government — not some of the people, nor
most of the people, but all of the people.
Let's keep voting rights the "crown jewel of
American liberties."
