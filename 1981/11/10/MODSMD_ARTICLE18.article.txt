## Protection of life through anti-abortion statutes necessary 
### 
And the abortion debate con
tinues. What is interesting is that
most of the rhetoric is for naught.
The problem is that so many people
are failing to address the real issue
behind this so-called "rights" argu
ment. I'll begin my clarification at
tempt with two statements:
1.) Pro-abortionists are basically
misguided in their perceptions of the
issue.
2.) Pro-lifers are in the right.
Let me first explain that I am defi

nitely not a Bible-toting fascist Moral
Majority zombie. Those guys weren't
even around when the pro-life pro
grams got underway. In fact, groups
like the Catholic Church are spend
ing a good deal of time just trying to
disassociate themselves from
pseudo-religious political organiza
tions like the Moral Majority. Neither
do I propose to crush "libertarians"
with a self-righteous iron fist.
Without social and political rights,
we would not even have a forum for

debate and life would approach
meaninglessness. But to put it simply,
our "convenient" rights don't mean
a thing when a human life is at stake.
We must never dehumanize the hu
man aspect of abortion in the name
of libertarianism.
What has always amazed me is the
lengths that scientists and non-scien
tists alike have spent in the develop
mental and physiological aspects of
the fetus, while not being able to an
swer any questions that would really
sway the abortion controversy. Very
few are willing to define the "point of
humanity" save for rather wide de
velopmental stages. Personally, the
developmental issue has always been
solvable on the basis that life is a con
tinuum. In other words, an adult is to
an adolescent is to a child is to an in
fant is to a fetus is to an embryo is to a
zygote. Pro-abortionists are trying to

sway us with their "Male plus female
equals a lump of meat, add a little
time and you get a human" formula.
That's a pretty weak argument as well
as a very cynical outlook on the hu
man life-cycle.
All of my low-level biology aside,
I've got to jump onto a broader ideal
ogical plane and state that the real
abortion issue is the amount of re
spect we as humans have for human
life. All we have to do is look around
at our world to see the missiles point
ing down our throats, the people
dying in Central America and Lt. Gov.
Mike Curb in hysterics because of
astonishing California crime rates.
How can we really address these is
sues when we allow the deaths of our
fellow children? How can we attempt
to solve .the problems of humanity
without protecting that very human
ity?

It is safe to say that our society is
capable of accepting large doses of
inhumanity and suffering without
much more than a cringe. Re
member the Haitian refugees? Re
member Cambodia? The Holocaust
was not that long ago. It would be
crazy to say that making abortions il
legal would guarantee a safe world
for all.
What 'we need, however, is a broad
new consideration of what humanity
actually is, and what it should be. We
must reaffirm ourselves as members
of the human family. The halting of
abortions is an important step in that
reaffirmation.
I must say that I do admire the pro
abortionists for standing up for what
they believe in. Yet I am concerned
with the irony of their arguments â€”
their defense of certain liberties
coinciding with their ignorance of

the greatest liberty that we possess.
To cherish life is to protect life.' To
protect life is to solve the problems of
mankind.
One last thought. The problems
spoken of earlier are intermingled
with the beauty of the earth. This
beauty is the stimuli for the optimism
which is a prerequisite to a pro-life
stance. Life is intrinsically valuable,
and is our only true possession. What
is left when it is taken away? You get
the idea? I don't know of any other
way to say it except that I am having a
great time here in the old biosphere,
and no one has (or had) any
semblance of a "right" to deny me
my human experience.
How about some closing poetics?
Think of those smiles that never
were, and those that could be.
