# Band to revise music, format
## 
### Cici Oremland 
Continuing in its accustomed path of independ
ence, the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) will institute music and format
changes internally that will be revealed to the public
after Jan. 1, said Adjunct Music Prof. Arthur Barnes,
LSJUMB director, in a previously taped interview that
aired last night on KZSU's "Campus Conference."
Barnes would give no precise information as to spe
cific changes, but said the Band will play "different
music, that's the clue or the key."
Barnes said he believes change occurs differently
here and that administrative supervision of the Band
is unnecessary. He said Band changes will occur
without forced surveillance and censorship by the
University administration.
This past year administrators at several East Coast
universities, whose bands' reputations are similar to
that of the LSJUMB, have instituted such supervisory
measures. Barnes said the success of what is being
called "the ban on the bands" at universities such as
Harvard, Yale and Columbia, has yet to be seen.
Barnes, who has been with the Band since its radical
transformation in 1963 from the traditional, staid, mili
tary marching unit that still typifies many university
marching bands, to the now familiar zany "scatter
ing" formation, rock'n' roll playing group, said he has
not been pleased with the last three years of the
Band's performance.
And, he said, loyal student and alumni followers of
the Band have not been too pleased with this year's
performances either. In discussing the Band's half
time show at the University of Southern California,
Oct. 17, where Stanford students themselves booed
the Band, Barnes said, "That's your most obvious
feedback. Now, were we to ignore that, then we
would be in hotter water."
Barnes attributed part of this lack of quality per
formance to a dearth of good music. He said the Stan

ford Band was the first university band on the West
Coast to play the music of its generation but today's
Top 40 songs do not fit the Band's character. As a re
sult, he said, the Band has had to resort to playing
many of the older tunes.
"We're dredging up tunes that were familiar with
the Beach Boys days. That's also a commentary on
contemporary music," he said.
Barnes said that after 18 years of portraying the off
beat and nonconformist mode, the unusual has be
come mundane. He said the Band must find new
forms and ideas and has been forced to take "a sec
ond hard look at what we're doing."
The Band has overdrawn on its past successes, he
said, and "perhaps the perception of what made it a
success has been lost."
In discussing the Band's future, Barnes spoke of the
past. He said, "The Band is my doing. I'm the keeper
of the flame ... I brought the music of the day."
But, he said that as much as the University would
like to think of its band as an original and unique
phenomenon, the zaniness and ideas for messages of
social comment were first developed at Harvard. The
LSJUMB was the first West Coast band to give up its
traditional marching lines for the "scatter" tech
niques and was the first university band to install an
exclusively rock 'n roll format, however, said Barnes.
He said it has now become part of the myth of the
Band, that after the Band strike in 1963 over the firing
of Band Director Julius Shucat the previous spring,
the Band emerged one day intact in its present form.
Barnes said that in actuality, the Band was already
known by its red jackets and was already a completely
student-run organization.
The new Band image was not immediately accepted
by anyone in the University community. "The Band
began as a four letter word . . . but became a slice of
the campus. . . musically representative of the under
graduate student body," he said.

Barnes said that in actuality, the Band was already
known by its red jackets and was already a completely
student-run organization.
The new Band image was not immediately accepted
by anyone in the University community. "The Band
began as a four letter word . . . but became a slice of
the campus. . . musically representative of the under
graduate student body," he said.

BAND IMPROVEMENTS ON THE WAY — Band director Arthur Barnes says changes in the LSjtJMß's
music and format will be implemented alter Jan. 1, affecting the Red Vest Band (which plays at home
basketball games) first. Last year's Red Vest Band is shown here with leader Ray Gruenwald.
Continuing in its accustomed path of independ
ence, the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band (LSJUMB) will institute music and format
changes internally that will be revealed to the public
after Jan. 1, said Adjunct Music Prof. Arthur Barnes,
LSJUMB director, in a previously taped interview that
aired last night on KZSU's "Campus Conference."
Barnes would give no precise information as to spe
cific changes, but said the Band will play "different
music, that's the clue or the key."
Barnes said he believes change occurs differently
here and that administrative supervision of the Band
is unnecessary. He said Band changes will occur
without forced surveillance and censorship by the
University administration.
This past year administrators at several East Coast
universities, whose bands' reputations are similar to
that of the LSJUMB, have instituted such supervisory
measures. Barnes said the success of what is being
called "the ban on the bands" at universities such as
Harvard, Yale and Columbia, has yet to be seen.
Barnes, who has been with the Band since its radical
transformation in 1963 from the traditional, staid, mili
tary marching unit that still typifies many university
marching bands, to the now familiar zany "scatter
ing" formation, rock'n' roll playing group, said he has
not been pleased with the last three years of the
Band's performance.
And, he said, loyal student and alumni followers of
the Band have not been too pleased with this year's
performances either. In discussing the Band's half
time show at the University of Southern California,
Oct. 17, where Stanford students themselves booed
the Band, Barnes said, "That's your most obvious
feedback. Now, were we to ignore that, then we
would be in hotter water."
Barnes attributed part of this lack of quality per
formance to a dearth of good music. He said the Stan

ford Band was the first university band on the West
Coast to play the music of its generation but today's
Top 40 songs do not fit the Band's character. As a re
sult, he said, the Band has had to resort to playing
many of the older tunes.
"We're dredging up tunes that were familiar with
the Beach Boys days. That's also a commentary on
contemporary music," he said.
Barnes said that after 18 years of portraying the off
beat and nonconformist mode, the unusual has be
come mundane. He said the Band must find new
forms and ideas and has been forced to take "a sec
ond hard look at what we're doing."
The Band has overdrawn on its past successes, he
said, and "perhaps the perception of what made it a
success has been lost."
In discussing the Band's future, Barnes spoke of the
past. He said, "The Band is my doing. I'm the keeper
of the flame ... I brought the music of the day."
But, he said that as much as the University would
like to think of its band as an original and unique
phenomenon, the zaniness and ideas for messages of
social comment were first developed at Harvard. The
LSJUMB was the first West Coast band to give up its
traditional marching lines for the "scatter" tech
niques and was the first university band to install an
exclusively rock 'n roll format, however, said Barnes.
He said it has now become part of the myth of the
Band, that after the Band strike in 1963 over the firing
of Band Director Julius Shucat the previous spring,
the Band emerged one day intact in its present form.
Barnes said that in actuality, the Band was already
known by its red jackets and was already a completely
student-run organization.
The new Band image was not immediately accepted
by anyone in the University community. "The Band
began as a four letter word . . . but became a slice of
the campus. . . musically representative of the under
graduate student body," he said.
