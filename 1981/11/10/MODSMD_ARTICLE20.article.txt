## Cowell pregnancy counseling offers all options 
### 
As a staff member at Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, and as a con
traceptive peer counselor, I wish to
address some of the issues brought
out in the recent article on pregnan
cy (Daily, Nov. 2). Some of my objec
tions might seem merely a matter of
semantics, but I am concerned that
the wording of the article has sensa
tionalized the issues rather than
being consistent with the Peer Coun
seling Center's policies. These objec
tions would include the statement
that "they are alarmed by the in
crease (in unplanned pregnancies)
and that they may have to find new
ways to educate students. . ." We are
concerned rather than alarmed; the
rate of unplanned pregnancies at
Stanford has not suddenly escalated
as the article implies. Further, the
rate of unplanned pregnancies is not
due to "lack of knowledge on proper
diaphragm use," as Hernandez
states; rather, it is possible that lack of
motivation on the part of the user
contributes to an increased number
of unplanned pregnancies.
However, our major objection is
with the statement, "While CowelPs
emphasis is on preventing un
planned pregnancies, it also offers
counseling for pregnant women who
are unsure whether or not to have an

abortion." We are concerned that
thisstatement impliesthat pregnancy
and abortion counseling are syno
nymous. In contrast, pregnancy
counseling is a consideration of all
options available to a pregnant wom
an, including pre-natal referral
(Cowell does not have obstetrics ser
vices) for women who want to con
tinue their pregnancy, as well as
abortion referral. Our role is to pro
vide information in a confidential
setting; we do not promote abortion
as the only option as implied.
Again, it may seem that these ob
jections are merely semantics, but if
the article will be interpreted as con
sistent with the policies of the Con
traceptive Peer Counseling Center,
and indirectly of the Cowell Student

Health Center, we wished to clarify
the aforementioned issues.

Since the Oct. 30 automobile acci
dent, in which two Stanford students
were killed, several people have
asked what effect these tragic deaths
will have on altohol use on campus.
Unfortunately, probably not much.
Drinking is part of the social life here;
people drink to relax and have a
good time. But the accident provides
the occasion to remember a few
basic common sense ideas about al
cohol use:
• Don't drink if you don't want to.

If you're pressed ("Come on, don't
you want to have a good time?") sim
ply say, "I'd prefer a Coke." If you do
drink, pace yourself; it takes one
hour for the body to absorb the alco
hol in a beer, a glass of wine or a mix
ed drink.
• When you plan an event off
campus — the rally for Big Game, for
example — take public transporta
tion, charter a bus or arrange ahead
of time who will stay sober and drive
home. Passengers concerned about
the driver's sobriety should not get in
the car.
• Every event needs a host who ac
cepts responsibility for seeing that
the occasion goes well. House of
ficers and class officers, for example,
can discuss how they want to take re
sponsibly for parties on campus and
at off-campus locations. The hosts
can help people have a good time,
see to it that people don't overdo it,
and make sure that those who've
been drinking don't drive.
• Find a focus for parties and get
togethers so that the activity isn't
drinking. Organize parties around
scavenger hunts in San Francisco,
movies and ball games rather than
around kegs.

Alcohol advice
Since the Oct. 30 automobile acci
dent, in which two Stanford students
were killed, several people have
asked what effect these tragic deaths
will have on altohol use on campus.
Unfortunately, probably not much.
Drinking is part of the social life here;
people drink to relax and have a
good time. But the accident provides
the occasion to remember a few
basic common sense ideas about al
cohol use:
• Don't drink if you don't want to.

If you're pressed ("Come on, don't
you want to have a good time?") sim
ply say, "I'd prefer a Coke." If you do
drink, pace yourself; it takes one
hour for the body to absorb the alco
hol in a beer, a glass of wine or a mix
ed drink.
• When you plan an event off
campus — the rally for Big Game, for
example — take public transporta
tion, charter a bus or arrange ahead
of time who will stay sober and drive
home. Passengers concerned about
the driver's sobriety should not get in
the car.
• Every event needs a host who ac
cepts responsibility for seeing that
the occasion goes well. House of
ficers and class officers, for example,
can discuss how they want to take re
sponsibly for parties on campus and
at off-campus locations. The hosts
can help people have a good time,
see to it that people don't overdo it,
and make sure that those who've
been drinking don't drive.
• Find a focus for parties and get
togethers so that the activity isn't
drinking. Organize parties around
scavenger hunts in San Francisco,
movies and ball games rather than
around kegs.
