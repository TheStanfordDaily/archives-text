## Drama Dept. adds a jewel to a cardboard crown 
### Bryan Trevor 
The Recruiting Officer, on view Wednesday
through Saturday nights in the Little Theatre, is one of
the most highly polished, well staged and intelligently
conceived Stanford productions in recent memory
Restoration comedy is traditionally a killer for college
drama departments, demanding a precision of lan
guage and style that usually exhausts the resources of
undergraduate actors.
But director Geoffrey Reeves, who brings with him
from England a most impressive set of professional
credentials, has managed to make George Farquhar's
1704 text accessible to his young actors and to give his
production an astonishing degree of stylistic dis
cipline. The actors are not only at ease with the pos
tural formalities of the Restoration style but, more im
portantly, speak Farquhar's text clearly and precisely,
as if understanding every word. One hears the text of
this difficult play as one rarely does at a Stanford pro
duction.
Still, understanding the text and bringing it to life
are two decidedly different things. In the final
analysis, Reeves' emphasis on the externals of style is
something of a mixed blessing for, if it lends his pro
duction a polished look, it leaves his actors with noth
ing substantial on which to build characterizations.
Lacking a firm grounding in authentic thought and
feeling, the characters never really take hold of our
interest as human beings. All the posturing and ver
balizing, however impressive they may appear as feats
of technical production, are therefore essentially
empty.
To put it another way, if Reeves has succeeded mas
terfully in meeting one of the most formidable
challenges in staging a Restoration comedy, he has
neglected to solve an equally imposing problem: how
to humanize stock characters and animate dramatic
formulae. As with most Restoration comedy, The Re
cruiting Officer offers an array of readily familiar

character types: the cynical rake, the love-besotted
friend, the affected dandy, the disdainful young lady,
all of whom may nevertheless be brought to life
through sensitivity to the inner mechanisms of motive
and need. »
In Reeves' production, however, the actors rieveY
get past the stereotype, and those who do — like
Parthenia Rath and Fritz Brun — manage through
sheer force of personality and theatrical panache
rather than any true depth or subtlety of character
ization. The acting is mostly monotonously one
dimensional. 1 here are no surprises, colors, variations
or nuances. My guess is that Reeves wanted the acting
broad and uninflected, in allegiance to the Brechtian
notion of theatre-as-exhibition. If so, he surely suc
ceeded; his production looks more like an external
demonstration of Farquhar's script than a dramatic re
alization of it.

his failure to sculpt the show, to give it pace and shape

by pointing up certain moments through changes in
rhythm and focus. Instead, everything seems to be
given equal weight. Potentially rich moments are lost
amid a relentless torrent of words which becomes
quite exasperating, proving that a swiftly paced show
can be as monotonous as a slowly paced one. The Re
cruiting Officer is utterly lacking in dynamics. It is
downright boring in some sections and not nearly as
furmy as it might be, since humor depends largely
upon the sort of surprise and spontaneity that are im
possible in a production with such regularity of
rhythm and behavior.
Another problem with this production, it seems to
me, is Reeves' apparent lack of interest in developing
the love intrigues at the heart of the play. The Recruit
ing Officer is largely built upon the tantalizing par
allels between love and war, in which all things are in
deed fair. Soldiers and lovers are recruited in much
the same fashion. In both cases, disguises are
adopted, stratagems deployed, and obstacles over

come. The two realms intersect as Sylvia wins over her
Captain Plume by posing as a recruit the haughty
Melinda capitulates to country gentleman Worthy af
ter being duped, right along with the recruits, by the
disguised Sergeant Kite.
Farquhar thus places love and war in poetic al
liance, so that what mightbecalledthe"politicalcon
tent" — the exposure of recruiting chicaneries —
must not, I think, be taken too seriously. Yet the polit
ical content is precisely what appears to have at
tracted Reeves; witnessthemartial musicandtheself
conscious Brechtian finale, in which the cast adds
ironic anti-war verses to "Over the Hills and Far
Away" and begins removing wigs and costumes as all
the scenery flies out to reveal a back wall plastered
with a huge Marine recruiting poster. No one could
fail to miss the meaning of this gimmick, but since it
isn't really anticipated by any pointed satiric gestures
earlier in the play, it becomes not much more than an
exercise in giggle-making. Maybe that is all that
Reeves intended.
In any case, this embryonic political commentary
assumes such a significance because the central love
interest is so indifferently treated. We hear Plume
(Brad Carpenter) and Sylvia (Deanna Carlyle) speak of
their love for each other, and we watch them go
through the motions of betrothal at play's end; but in
their scenes together, not a single spark flies. After
Sylvia has assumed her masculine disguise her meet
ings with Plume ought to be charged with erotic ten
sion, as she struggles to suppress her feminine in
stincts and he responds in bewilderment to own at
traction to the pretty young fellow. But none of the
rich comic possibilities offered by Sylvia's disguise are
mined. Part of the problem is that Carlyle, for all her
engaging cockiness, plays Jack Willful in virtually the
same manner she plays Sylvia, so that much of the
