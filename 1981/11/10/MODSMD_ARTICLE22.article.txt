Dexter Gordon
The Gold Rush/San Jose
2 November 1981
There was certainly a wealth of talent at
The Gold Rush, a brand new jazz club in
San tenor saxophonist Dexter
Gordon and his trio perfromed last Mon
day night.
Gordon, making his San jose debut, and
his three backups, including Dave Eubanks
on acoustic bass, proved that high class
contemporary jazz is no longer exclusively
for those with fat wallets or 50 mpg Hon
das. Gone are the days of driving to Santa
Cruz or the Keystone korner to experience
the relaxing sound of good jazz.
The Gold Rush is a low ceilinged,
bucolic dinner/nightclub tastefully deco

rated in the style of a California mining
shaft.
The walls are covered with beams and
replicas of building fronts. And, the
seating arrangement is quitegenerous, un
like many sardine cans which will go un
named. The Gold Rush seems to strive for
quality, not quantity.
Speakers are located everywhere, filling
all the nooks and crannies of the club with
fine sound. Bars exist on either side of the
stage, but are noisy, the clinking of glass
often detracting one's attention from
stage.
But the Gold Rush is clean and classy in
its own informal, come-as-you-are way.
The only discrepancy might be that an im
perfect, rustic setting is not always con
ducive to the precise art of contemporary
jazz.
Gordon et al. played an hour and 45

minute set which consisted of just four
basic tunes. Beginning at 9 o'clock, nearly
30 minutes behind schedule, Gordon told
a few jokes with his patented, deliberate
drawl and then jumped into the group's
opening number, "Whales."
In all four songs, the tall, balding
Gordon had first honors at soloing. Al
though not quite as fast as he once was,
Gordon has not lost an ounce of touch
implied by the name Dexter Gordon.
But perhaps the biggest discovery all
evening was a pure gold nugget named
Kirk Litsig. All four of his solos (one in each
song) were unbelievably quick and
molded into the songs perfectly.
Litsig glided over the piano keys as
smoothly as a hand would slide over his
shaved head. During all this, his eyes were
shut, only opening them to acknowledge
the wild cheeis and ovations at the con

elusion of each masterful solo.
The quartet's second song, entitled
"Hanky Panky," was nearly 30 minutes
long, highlighted by a complex, though
unemotional, Eubanks bass solo. The next
piece was the group's first of the slow na
ture, played brilliantly by Gordon with
feeling and abandonment of superfluous
precision.
Then, after Litsig, dexterous Dexter
soloed for five minutes without the as
sistance of the trio behind him. His notes
echoed through the Gold Rush as if they
were being played on a deserted street
corner at 2 a.m., illuminating every dark al
ley with wonderful sound.
For their final piece, the quartet per
formed "Jumping Back," a tune com
posed, among other, by Charlie Parker.
Midway through the song, Eubanks, Litsig,
and Gordon departed from the stage, leav
ing Gladden alone behind his drums and
symbols. And that is no way to spell relief!
What ensued had to be the world's long
est drum solo. Even though the agony

lasted 15 minutes, it seemed like years.
Finally, the torture session having
ended, the rest of the group returned to
stage. Cordon introduced to the band and
bid all a good night. In doing this, Gordon
described himself as "a young man (some
thing he isn't, unfortunately) and as "a be
liever in spreading a little joy in the neigh
borhood" (something he did quite sue
cessfully).
But before he could leave the stage, up
popped San Jose Mayor Janet Gray-Hays.
She made a truly spontaneous and original
presentation to Dexter: "So you'll re
member your way to San Jose, I'd like to
present you with the key to our city." Im
mediately shouts rang out: "Dexter for
Mayor!"
Nevertheless, it was a nice gesture, one
that Gordon candidly acknowledged by
saying, "Miss Gray to you, but baby to
me."
Do you know something we don't, Dex
ter?
