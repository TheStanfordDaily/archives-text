Israelis violate Saudi airspace
Riyadh — Saudi Arabia claimed yesterday that Is
raeli warplanes invaded Saudi airspace over the king
dom's northwest regions and were driven back by
Saudi jet fighters.
Israel refused comment.
The location of the purported violation, about 105
miles from the kingdom's Red Sea coast, is in the vi
cinity of the Tabuk military air base.
In Washington, President Ronald Reagan was in
formed about 9:30 a.m. EST that Israeli jets had en
tered Saudi airspace and left "on their own accord,"
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes
said. Speakes would not comment further.
The first headline broadcast by state radio called
the incident an attack, but the later report said only
that the jets had violated Saudi air space.
In Washington, U.S. government sources said Is
raeli military planes twice flew into Saudi Arabian air
space but there was no report of any gunfire.
The Pentagon refused comment on the Saudi claim
of an Israeli violation, but U.S. government sources
confirmed this had happened.
B-1 cost estimate hits $40 billion
Washington — The Congressional Budget Office
estimated yesterday that it would cost $39.8 billion,
well beyond what the Pentagon has claimed, to build
and equip the 100 B-1 bombers President Ronald Rea
gan is seeking as part of his plan to rearm America.
CBO's new estimate, which includes some equip
ment that the Pentagon does not count, works out to
almost $400 million for each bomber, or more than 40
percent above the Pentagon's advertised price of $280
million.
"There is deep division over the need and the cost
of this strategic bomber," conceded Chairman Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) as his Senate Appropriations sub
committee on defense began marking up the Pen
tagon's $208 billion money bill yesterday. The full
committee is slated to vote today on whether the B-1
is worth the money. Sen. Patrick Leahy (R-Vt.), in re
leasing the CBO study, said, "I do not believe we can
afford a $40 billion flying Edsel. The B-1 bomber will
be obsolete before it is deployed."
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has handed
lethal ammunition to Leahy and other congressional
critics of the B-1 by testifying that the new bomber
would not be able to survive against Soviet defenses
any later than 1990. Since the first B-1 will not be ready
until 1986, this has raised the question of whether it is
worthwhile pouring billions into the B-1 rather than
waiting a little longer for the radar-evading Stealth
bomber now under development.
Israelis warn PLO on violations
Tel Aviv — Israel Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ac
cused Palestinian guerrillas yesterday of repeated vio

lations of the south Lebanon cease-fire, and warned
that Israel was prepared to take military retaliation if
the incidents continued.
The former general strongly implied that Israel's re
straint would end if the United States were to endorse
Saudi Arabia's eight-point peace plan.
He said Israel's political line was to seek peaceful
solutions but "when the Americans are suggesting
other plans than Camp David, we are afraid that we
may not be able to stick to this line."
Sharon said that the PLO had violated the south
Lebanon cease-fire 21 times since it went into effect
July 24. The truce ended two weeks of bitter artillery,
rocket and aerial assaults between Israel and the
guerrilla forces.
He also accused the PLO of breaking the cease-fire
by adding tanks, artillery, multiple rocket launchers
and other heavy weaponry to its forces along the Is
rael border and by supporting terrorist attacks on Jew -
ish and Israeli targets in Europe.
A list of alleged violations distributed to reporters
after the press conference showed that all of them
were directed against U.N. positions in Lebanon or
against targets in the southern Lebanese enclave con
trolled by the Israeli-backed militia of Maj. Saad Had
dad. No attacks on Israel itself were reported.
Nevertheless, Sharon emphasized that Israel was
prepared to retaliate if policial means were unable to
prevent future violations.
Joint exercise begins in Egypt
Cairo — A shipload of U.S. Army M-60 tanks and ar
mored personnel carriers anchored off Alexandria
yesterday as thousands of American troops began
landing near Cairo to begin an ambitious test of the
new U.S. Rapid Deployment Force.
The shipload of heavy equipment and planeloads
of Americans landing at Cairo West air base are the
main elements of Exercise Bright Star 82, a series of
tactical joint maneuvers involving Egypt, Sudan,
Somalia and Oman.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig had indicated in
Cairo last month that the exercise had been beefed
up in the wake of the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat order to emphasize American determination to
protect the region. Military officials involved in Bright
Star stressed, however, that nothing had been added
to the months-old plans for the joint maneuver since
the Egyptian leader was killed.
Brady visits White House
Washington — Press secretary James Brady re
turned to the White House in a wheelchair yesterday,
but his indomitable wit was intact as he helped Presi
dent Ronald Reagan open the refurbished White
House press room.
"You know, of course, this press room is still built
over a swimming pool," Reagan said. "Now, it isn't

true, however, that the floor has been hinged."
"Yes it is," quipped Brady.
The president and a roomful of reporters erupted
in laughter — perhaps not a little relieved to hear
Brady sounding so much like his old self in his first of
ficial appearance since being shot March 30.
The press secretary, whose left side is partially para
lyzed as a result of the bullet that shattered in his brain
during the attack on Reagan, appeared remarkably
like his old self.
But the impish grin that once seemed permanently
affixed to his face has been replaced by an odd melan
choly look that belies his actual good cheer.
And although Brady chooses his words carefully,
they come out in a voice that starts as a monotone,
then rises toward the end of his sentences as if he
unable to continue without laughing or crying.
Doctors have said controlling the range of his emo
tional expression is one of the many things Brady is re
learning.
After upstaging the president with his retort about
the press room really having a trap door, Brady sat
quietly as Reagan set the tone for the ribbon-cutting
ceremony.
"As happy as we are about reopening today, we're
even more elated by the presence of a man who truly
belongs in this room, a man whose courage has been
an inspiration to all of us," the president added. "And
I'm proud that Jim Brady is my press secretary."
Turning to Brady, Reagan said, "We're all waiting
for the day that you come back for good."
"I am too, Mr. President," Brady said through the
din.
"I'll come back," Brady vowed as his wheelchair
was being rolled out of the briefing room after the
dedication.
Salvador guerrillas gaining ground
San Salvador, Fl Salvador — The Salvadoran Army
has lost control of approximately one-fourth of El
Salvador's territory to guerrilla forces and is in immi
nent danger of losing land access to nearly half the
country if the rebels continue a spectacular bridge
demolition campaign.
Although the State Department has voiced increas
ing concern over the development of a military
"stalemate" between the guerrillas and the govern
ment, tours outside the capital into the countryside
indicate that the stalemate was broken some time ago
and that the guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Lib
eration Front (FMLN) now is gaining ground faster
than government troops can hold it.
The FMLN forces have destroyed 32 bridges this
year, including two on major transport routes during
the past several weeks, significantly limiting the ac
cess of government troops to certain regions of the
country except by air. In large portions of several
provinces the guerrillas now reportedly have free
reign and have set up local governments with little

tear of government incursion.
The rebel expansion follows the failure of a much
heralded guerrilla offensive launched last January,
when the FMLN announced over a captured radiosta
tion that "the time for final struggle" had arrived. The
offensive quickly fizzled into a few sporadic battles
and a resonant propaganda victory for the govern
ment, and guerrilla commanders interviewed at the
time acknowledged that their forces had been poorly
trained, underequipped and severely lacking in com
munications and logistical infrastructure.
Through early spring, the estimated 17,000 men of
the combined Army, Air Force and four police bodies
(National Guard, National Police, Treasury Police and
Customs Police) seemed able to handle what most
observers agreed were about 5,000 armed and
mobilized guerrillas. Yet there were early signs of
trouble as two successive attacks in 1980 on the guer
rilla stronghold of northeastern Morazan Province
created thousands of refugees and civillian casualties
but left the guerrillas' fighting force untouched.
Economic outlook 'depressing'
Washington — The economy may suffer "a real
downer" the rest of this year, Secretary of Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday. He acknowledged that
the federal deficit would soar to $60 billion, which is
$16.9 billion more than the administration had pre
dicted just six weeks ago.
"Literally what no one knows at this point is just
how deep a recession we are going to be in," Regan
told reporters. He added that "by the first part of next
year" the nation may be coming out of the recession.
A slumping economy reduces federal revenues be
cause fewer people are working and paying taxes, Re
gan noted. At the same time, federal spending in
creases because of higher payments for such things as
unemployment compensation.
Despite those developments, the White House is
standing fast in its opposition to tax increases for the
next three years.
Stock market jittery
New York — The stock market closed a bit higher
yesterday after a hectic last hour of trading in which
prices slumped and then recovered following a false
report that Israeli jets had raided Saudi Arabia.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
nearly 3 points at 3 p.m. EST when reports reached the
market that Saudi Arabia radio had broadcast news of
an Israeli attack.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow morning with
increasing clouds tomorrow afternoon. Hazy after
noons with locally dense fog. Low temperatures in the
upper 40s to mid 50s; high temperatures in the upper
60s to 70s. Variable winds to 15 mph.

Washington — The Congressional Budget Office
estimated yesterday that it would cost $39.8 billion,
well beyond what the Pentagon has claimed, to build
and equip the 100 B-1 bombers President Ronald Rea
gan is seeking as part of his plan to rearm America.
CBO's new estimate, which includes some equip
ment that the Pentagon does not count, works out to
almost $400 million for each bomber, or more than 40
percent above the Pentagon's advertised price of $280
million.
"There is deep division over the need and the cost
of this strategic bomber," conceded Chairman Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) as his Senate Appropriations sub
committee on defense began marking up the Pen
tagon's $208 billion money bill yesterday. The full
committee is slated to vote today on whether the B-1
is worth the money. Sen. Patrick Leahy (R-Vt.), in re
leasing the CBO study, said, "I do not believe we can
afford a $40 billion flying Edsel. The B-1 bomber will
be obsolete before it is deployed."
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has handed
lethal ammunition to Leahy and other congressional
critics of the B-1 by testifying that the new bomber
would not be able to survive against Soviet defenses
any later than 1990. Since the first B-1 will not be ready
until 1986, this has raised the question of whether it is
worthwhile pouring billions into the B-1 rather than
waiting a little longer for the radar-evading Stealth
bomber now under development.
Israelis warn PLO on violations
Tel Aviv — Israel Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ac
cused Palestinian guerrillas yesterday of repeated vio

lations of the south Lebanon cease-fire, and warned
that Israel was prepared to take military retaliation if
the incidents continued.
The former general strongly implied that Israel's re
straint would end if the United States were to endorse
Saudi Arabia's eight-point peace plan.
He said Israel's political line was to seek peaceful
solutions but "when the Americans are suggesting
other plans than Camp David, we are afraid that we
may not be able to stick to this line."
Sharon said that the PLO had violated the south
Lebanon cease-fire 21 times since it went into effect
July 24. The truce ended two weeks of bitter artillery,
rocket and aerial assaults between Israel and the
guerrilla forces.
He also accused the PLO of breaking the cease-fire
by adding tanks, artillery, multiple rocket launchers
and other heavy weaponry to its forces along the Is
rael border and by supporting terrorist attacks on Jew -
ish and Israeli targets in Europe.
A list of alleged violations distributed to reporters
after the press conference showed that all of them
were directed against U.N. positions in Lebanon or
against targets in the southern Lebanese enclave con
trolled by the Israeli-backed militia of Maj. Saad Had
dad. No attacks on Israel itself were reported.
Nevertheless, Sharon emphasized that Israel was
prepared to retaliate if policial means were unable to
prevent future violations.
Joint exercise begins in Egypt
Cairo — A shipload of U.S. Army M-60 tanks and ar
mored personnel carriers anchored off Alexandria
yesterday as thousands of American troops began
landing near Cairo to begin an ambitious test of the
new U.S. Rapid Deployment Force.
The shipload of heavy equipment and planeloads
of Americans landing at Cairo West air base are the
main elements of Exercise Bright Star 82, a series of
tactical joint maneuvers involving Egypt, Sudan,
Somalia and Oman.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig had indicated in
Cairo last month that the exercise had been beefed
up in the wake of the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat order to emphasize American determination to
protect the region. Military officials involved in Bright
Star stressed, however, that nothing had been added
to the months-old plans for the joint maneuver since
the Egyptian leader was killed.
Brady visits White House
Washington — Press secretary James Brady re
turned to the White House in a wheelchair yesterday,
but his indomitable wit was intact as he helped Presi
dent Ronald Reagan open the refurbished White
House press room.
"You know, of course, this press room is still built
over a swimming pool," Reagan said. "Now, it isn't

true, however, that the floor has been hinged."
"Yes it is," quipped Brady.
The president and a roomful of reporters erupted
in laughter — perhaps not a little relieved to hear
Brady sounding so much like his old self in his first of
ficial appearance since being shot March 30.
The press secretary, whose left side is partially para
lyzed as a result of the bullet that shattered in his brain
during the attack on Reagan, appeared remarkably
like his old self.
But the impish grin that once seemed permanently
affixed to his face has been replaced by an odd melan
choly look that belies his actual good cheer.
And although Brady chooses his words carefully,
they come out in a voice that starts as a monotone,
then rises toward the end of his sentences as if he
unable to continue without laughing or crying.
Doctors have said controlling the range of his emo
tional expression is one of the many things Brady is re
learning.
After upstaging the president with his retort about
the press room really having a trap door, Brady sat
quietly as Reagan set the tone for the ribbon-cutting
ceremony.
"As happy as we are about reopening today, we're
even more elated by the presence of a man who truly
belongs in this room, a man whose courage has been
an inspiration to all of us," the president added. "And
I'm proud that Jim Brady is my press secretary."
Turning to Brady, Reagan said, "We're all waiting
for the day that you come back for good."
"I am too, Mr. President," Brady said through the
din.
"I'll come back," Brady vowed as his wheelchair
was being rolled out of the briefing room after the
dedication.
Salvador guerrillas gaining ground
San Salvador, Fl Salvador — The Salvadoran Army
has lost control of approximately one-fourth of El
Salvador's territory to guerrilla forces and is in immi
nent danger of losing land access to nearly half the
country if the rebels continue a spectacular bridge
demolition campaign.
Although the State Department has voiced increas
ing concern over the development of a military
"stalemate" between the guerrillas and the govern
ment, tours outside the capital into the countryside
indicate that the stalemate was broken some time ago
and that the guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Lib
eration Front (FMLN) now is gaining ground faster
than government troops can hold it.
The FMLN forces have destroyed 32 bridges this
year, including two on major transport routes during
the past several weeks, significantly limiting the ac
cess of government troops to certain regions of the
country except by air. In large portions of several
provinces the guerrillas now reportedly have free
reign and have set up local governments with little

tear of government incursion.
The rebel expansion follows the failure of a much
heralded guerrilla offensive launched last January,
when the FMLN announced over a captured radiosta
tion that "the time for final struggle" had arrived. The
offensive quickly fizzled into a few sporadic battles
and a resonant propaganda victory for the govern
ment, and guerrilla commanders interviewed at the
time acknowledged that their forces had been poorly
trained, underequipped and severely lacking in com
munications and logistical infrastructure.
Through early spring, the estimated 17,000 men of
the combined Army, Air Force and four police bodies
(National Guard, National Police, Treasury Police and
Customs Police) seemed able to handle what most
observers agreed were about 5,000 armed and
mobilized guerrillas. Yet there were early signs of
trouble as two successive attacks in 1980 on the guer
rilla stronghold of northeastern Morazan Province
created thousands of refugees and civillian casualties
but left the guerrillas' fighting force untouched.
Economic outlook 'depressing'
Washington — The economy may suffer "a real
downer" the rest of this year, Secretary of Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday. He acknowledged that
the federal deficit would soar to $60 billion, which is
$16.9 billion more than the administration had pre
dicted just six weeks ago.
"Literally what no one knows at this point is just
how deep a recession we are going to be in," Regan
told reporters. He added that "by the first part of next
year" the nation may be coming out of the recession.
A slumping economy reduces federal revenues be
cause fewer people are working and paying taxes, Re
gan noted. At the same time, federal spending in
creases because of higher payments for such things as
unemployment compensation.
Despite those developments, the White House is
standing fast in its opposition to tax increases for the
next three years.
Stock market jittery
New York — The stock market closed a bit higher
yesterday after a hectic last hour of trading in which
prices slumped and then recovered following a false
report that Israeli jets had raided Saudi Arabia.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
nearly 3 points at 3 p.m. EST when reports reached the
market that Saudi Arabia radio had broadcast news of
an Israeli attack.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow morning with
increasing clouds tomorrow afternoon. Hazy after
noons with locally dense fog. Low temperatures in the
upper 40s to mid 50s; high temperatures in the upper
60s to 70s. Variable winds to 15 mph.

Israelis violate Saudi airspace
Riyadh — Saudi Arabia claimed yesterday that Is
raeli warplanes invaded Saudi airspace over the king
dom's northwest regions and were driven back by
Saudi jet fighters.
Israel refused comment.
The location of the purported violation, about 105
miles from the kingdom's Red Sea coast, is in the vi
cinity of the Tabuk military air base.
In Washington, President Ronald Reagan was in
formed about 9:30 a.m. EST that Israeli jets had en
tered Saudi airspace and left "on their own accord,"
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes
said. Speakes would not comment further.
The first headline broadcast by state radio called
the incident an attack, but the later report said only
that the jets had violated Saudi air space.
In Washington, U.S. government sources said Is
raeli military planes twice flew into Saudi Arabian air
space but there was no report of any gunfire.
The Pentagon refused comment on the Saudi claim
of an Israeli violation, but U.S. government sources
confirmed this had happened.

critics of the B-1 by testifying that the new bomber
would not be able to survive against Soviet defenses
any later than 1990. Since the first B-1 will not be ready
until 1986, this has raised the question of whether it is
worthwhile pouring billions into the B-1 rather than
waiting a little longer for the radar-evading Stealth
bomber now under development.
Israelis warn PLO on violations
Tel Aviv — Israel Defense Minister Ariel Sharon ac
cused Palestinian guerrillas yesterday of repeated vio

lations of the south Lebanon cease-fire, and warned
that Israel was prepared to take military retaliation if
the incidents continued.
The former general strongly implied that Israel's re
straint would end if the United States were to endorse
Saudi Arabia's eight-point peace plan.
He said Israel's political line was to seek peaceful
solutions but "when the Americans are suggesting
other plans than Camp David, we are afraid that we
may not be able to stick to this line."
Sharon said that the PLO had violated the south
Lebanon cease-fire 21 times since it went into effect
July 24. The truce ended two weeks of bitter artillery,
rocket and aerial assaults between Israel and the
guerrilla forces.
He also accused the PLO of breaking the cease-fire
by adding tanks, artillery, multiple rocket launchers
and other heavy weaponry to its forces along the Is
rael border and by supporting terrorist attacks on Jew -
ish and Israeli targets in Europe.
A list of alleged violations distributed to reporters
after the press conference showed that all of them
were directed against U.N. positions in Lebanon or
against targets in the southern Lebanese enclave con
trolled by the Israeli-backed militia of Maj. Saad Had
dad. No attacks on Israel itself were reported.
Nevertheless, Sharon emphasized that Israel was
prepared to retaliate if policial means were unable to
prevent future violations.
Joint exercise begins in Egypt
Cairo — A shipload of U.S. Army M-60 tanks and ar
mored personnel carriers anchored off Alexandria
yesterday as thousands of American troops began
landing near Cairo to begin an ambitious test of the
new U.S. Rapid Deployment Force.
The shipload of heavy equipment and planeloads
of Americans landing at Cairo West air base are the
main elements of Exercise Bright Star 82, a series of
tactical joint maneuvers involving Egypt, Sudan,
Somalia and Oman.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig had indicated in
Cairo last month that the exercise had been beefed
up in the wake of the assassination of President Anwar
Sadat order to emphasize American determination to
protect the region. Military officials involved in Bright
Star stressed, however, that nothing had been added
to the months-old plans for the joint maneuver since
the Egyptian leader was killed.
Brady visits White House
Washington — Press secretary James Brady re
turned to the White House in a wheelchair yesterday,
but his indomitable wit was intact as he helped Presi
dent Ronald Reagan open the refurbished White
House press room.
"You know, of course, this press room is still built
over a swimming pool," Reagan said. "Now, it isn't

true, however, that the floor has been hinged."
"Yes it is," quipped Brady.
The president and a roomful of reporters erupted
in laughter — perhaps not a little relieved to hear
Brady sounding so much like his old self in his first of
ficial appearance since being shot March 30.
The press secretary, whose left side is partially para
lyzed as a result of the bullet that shattered in his brain
during the attack on Reagan, appeared remarkably
like his old self.
But the impish grin that once seemed permanently
affixed to his face has been replaced by an odd melan
choly look that belies his actual good cheer.
And although Brady chooses his words carefully,
they come out in a voice that starts as a monotone,
then rises toward the end of his sentences as if he
unable to continue without laughing or crying.
Doctors have said controlling the range of his emo
tional expression is one of the many things Brady is re
learning.
After upstaging the president with his retort about
the press room really having a trap door, Brady sat
quietly as Reagan set the tone for the ribbon-cutting
ceremony.
"As happy as we are about reopening today, we're
even more elated by the presence of a man who truly
belongs in this room, a man whose courage has been
an inspiration to all of us," the president added. "And
I'm proud that Jim Brady is my press secretary."
Turning to Brady, Reagan said, "We're all waiting
for the day that you come back for good."
"I am too, Mr. President," Brady said through the
din.
"I'll come back," Brady vowed as his wheelchair
was being rolled out of the briefing room after the
dedication.
Salvador guerrillas gaining ground
San Salvador, Fl Salvador — The Salvadoran Army
has lost control of approximately one-fourth of El
Salvador's territory to guerrilla forces and is in immi
nent danger of losing land access to nearly half the
country if the rebels continue a spectacular bridge
demolition campaign.
Although the State Department has voiced increas
ing concern over the development of a military
"stalemate" between the guerrillas and the govern
ment, tours outside the capital into the countryside
indicate that the stalemate was broken some time ago
and that the guerrilla Farabundo Marti National Lib
eration Front (FMLN) now is gaining ground faster
than government troops can hold it.
The FMLN forces have destroyed 32 bridges this
year, including two on major transport routes during
the past several weeks, significantly limiting the ac
cess of government troops to certain regions of the
country except by air. In large portions of several
provinces the guerrillas now reportedly have free
reign and have set up local governments with little

tear of government incursion.
The rebel expansion follows the failure of a much
heralded guerrilla offensive launched last January,
when the FMLN announced over a captured radiosta
tion that "the time for final struggle" had arrived. The
offensive quickly fizzled into a few sporadic battles
and a resonant propaganda victory for the govern
ment, and guerrilla commanders interviewed at the
time acknowledged that their forces had been poorly
trained, underequipped and severely lacking in com
munications and logistical infrastructure.
Through early spring, the estimated 17,000 men of
the combined Army, Air Force and four police bodies
(National Guard, National Police, Treasury Police and
Customs Police) seemed able to handle what most
observers agreed were about 5,000 armed and
mobilized guerrillas. Yet there were early signs of
trouble as two successive attacks in 1980 on the guer
rilla stronghold of northeastern Morazan Province
created thousands of refugees and civillian casualties
but left the guerrillas' fighting force untouched.
Economic outlook 'depressing'
Washington — The economy may suffer "a real
downer" the rest of this year, Secretary of Treasury
Donald Regan said yesterday. He acknowledged that
the federal deficit would soar to $60 billion, which is
$16.9 billion more than the administration had pre
dicted just six weeks ago.
"Literally what no one knows at this point is just
how deep a recession we are going to be in," Regan
told reporters. He added that "by the first part of next
year" the nation may be coming out of the recession.
A slumping economy reduces federal revenues be
cause fewer people are working and paying taxes, Re
gan noted. At the same time, federal spending in
creases because of higher payments for such things as
unemployment compensation.
Despite those developments, the White House is
standing fast in its opposition to tax increases for the
next three years.
Stock market jittery
New York — The stock market closed a bit higher
yesterday after a hectic last hour of trading in which
prices slumped and then recovered following a false
report that Israeli jets had raided Saudi Arabia.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up
nearly 3 points at 3 p.m. EST when reports reached the
market that Saudi Arabia radio had broadcast news of
an Israeli attack.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow morning with
increasing clouds tomorrow afternoon. Hazy after
noons with locally dense fog. Low temperatures in the
upper 40s to mid 50s; high temperatures in the upper
60s to 70s. Variable winds to 15 mph.

Israelis violate Saudi airspace
Riyadh — Saudi Arabia claimed yesterday that Is
raeli warplanes invaded Saudi airspace over the king
dom's northwest regions and were driven back by
Saudi jet fighters.
Israel refused comment.
The location of the purported violation, about 105
miles from the kingdom's Red Sea coast, is in the vi
cinity of the Tabuk military air base.
In Washington, President Ronald Reagan was in
formed about 9:30 a.m. EST that Israeli jets had en
tered Saudi airspace and left "on their own accord,"
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes
said. Speakes would not comment further.
The first headline broadcast by state radio called
the incident an attack, but the later report said only
that the jets had violated Saudi air space.
In Washington, U.S. government sources said Is
raeli military planes twice flew into Saudi Arabian air
space but there was no report of any gunfire.
The Pentagon refused comment on the Saudi claim
of an Israeli violation, but U.S. government sources
confirmed this had happened.
B-1 cost estimate hits $40 billion
Washington — The Congressional Budget Office
estimated yesterday that it would cost $39.8 billion,
well beyond what the Pentagon has claimed, to build
and equip the 100 B-1 bombers President Ronald Rea
gan is seeking as part of his plan to rearm America.
CBO's new estimate, which includes some equip
ment that the Pentagon does not count, works out to
almost $400 million for each bomber, or more than 40
percent above the Pentagon's advertised price of $280
million.
"There is deep division over the need and the cost
of this strategic bomber," conceded Chairman Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) as his Senate Appropriations sub
committee on defense began marking up the Pen
tagon's $208 billion money bill yesterday. The full
committee is slated to vote today on whether the B-1
is worth the money. Sen. Patrick Leahy (R-Vt.), in re
leasing the CBO study, said, "I do not believe we can
afford a $40 billion flying Edsel. The B-1 bomber will
be obsolete before it is deployed."
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has handed
lethal ammunition to Leahy and other congressional
critics of the B-1 by testifying that the new bomber
would not be able to survive against Soviet defenses
any later than 1990. Since the first B-1 will not be ready
