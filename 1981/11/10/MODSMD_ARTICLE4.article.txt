# Guidelines regulate treatment of lab animals
## 
### Kathy Christie 
As a leader in current psy
chological and medical research, the
University routinely uses animals for
experimentation. Although there has
been recent debate over the ethics of
this procedure, those involved in re
search here say they believe the ex
periments are both necessary and
worthwhile.
Because of this controversy and
due to the wide range of experiments
performed, there are outlined pro
cedures which must be followed
before working with animals. First,
the experimenter must fill out a form
explaining the type of research, the
reason for the need for animals, and
the care that the animals will receive.
This form is then sent to the
Division of Laboratory Animal Medi
cine (D-LAM), which reviews it and
decides whether to grant the animals
to the applicant.
D-LAM, which is required and ov
erseen by the federal government,
has the ultimate authority for animal
usage here. According to Dr. James

Dewson, head of D-LAM, its purpose
is manifold. Besides procuring
animals for research and teaching, D
LAM is responsible for their care.
Monitoring actual experiments in
sures that they are humane and in ac
cordance with University and federal
guidelines. Finally, D-LAM strives to
carry these experiments out in the
"most cost-effective manner which is
consistent with animal welfare," ac
cording to Dewson.
Dewson added that infractions of
these guidelines rarely occur. Before
using animals, a researcher must sign
a statement saying that he under
stands and will comply with the regu
lations. Besides, he said, most re
searchers care enough for the
animals to treat them properly any
way. Dewson pointed out that there

is a definite attempt made here to use
alternative methods to animal usage
whenever possible.
The Psychology Department fre
quently uses animals for experi
ments. A typical experiment might
involve determining what sectors of
the brain are used in a specific motor
response: A monkey sits in a box
which has a tic-tac-toe-like light
board on it. When the board lights
up, an Apple computer randomly as
signs a green square to one of the
sectors. The monkey is trained to
press the green square, and elec
trodes attached to his head relay
brain activity to the computer.
Dr. Karl Pribram, who runssomeof
the experiments, emphasized that
the experiments are based on the
philosophy of positive reinforce

ment. The animals are trained much
like a pet, using food as a reward for
proper actions. The animals' social
well-being is also considered as stu
dents begin to care for the animals
regulary, according to Pribram.
Much effort is put into making the
animals comfortable, and if an ex
periment causes pain, it is revised, he
said.
According to Dr. Steve Cutcomb,
also of the department, perhaps the
best thing that could happen to an
animal is that it be chosen to partici
pate in these experiments.
Dr. Pat Jones of the Biology De
partment also uses animals in her im
munology research. She uses rabbits,
among other animals, to study post
immunization antibodies, and
hamstersand micetostudy lymphoid
tissues. Although the rodents must
be sacrificed for the experiments,
Jones emphasized that "you can't do
biomedical research without using
animals. Computer simulation and
tissue cultures can't do the same
things actual animals can."
Grant Hoyt, a lab technician in the
Cardiovascular Surgery Department
said his department uses animals,
mainly dogs, rats, monkeys and
calves, for heart transplantation re
search. "The purpose is twofold " he
said, "to improve the surgical skills of
the residents, and to study the new
methods of immunosuppression."
He said these invaluable results
would not be possible without using
animals.
In the Urology Department,
Animal Health Technician Sheri
Turner stated that although she
started her job with qualms about us
ing certain animals for experimenta
tion, her perspective has changed.
Her work deals primarily with
monitoring the bladder and kidney
functions of rabbits and pigs. The
pigs, in particular, are studied be
cause their multiple calyxes and
papillae are much like those in the
human body, she said.
Besides knowing first-hand what
precautions are taken to insure that
the animals do not experience pain,
Turner said she is able to see how
much this research is helping to raise
the quality of human life.
"The fact that they're being used as
experimental animals allows people
to live," agreed Hoyt. "That's where
some people draw the line — they
just can't accept that; they say it's not
worth it."
"It guess I think it's worth it,"he
said.

ANIMALS AID IN RESEARCH — This research worker is perlorming
a laparotomy (the opening ot the abdominal cavity to expose the
urinary bladder) on a rabbit as part ol Medical School research in the
Urology Department. The rabbit breathes Flnothane during the op
eration, ancl is killed afterwards.
