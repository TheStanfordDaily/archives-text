# Workers still protest dismissal of Tresidder maintenance employee
## 
### Nathan Selden 
The elimination of a maintenance
position at Tresidder Union and the
subsequent dismissal of a Stanford
employee have continued to receive
protests from fellow workers of the
employee, and have set off a debate
about whether the move will cost the
University more money.
Cruz (Rick) Hernandez was laid off
last summer as a result of a decision
made by Larry Davidson, assistant di
rector of Tresidder, to eliminate a
maintenance worker position.
Davidson said he and Tresidder Di
rector Ellie Oppenheim decided to
assign major and preventative main
tenance work to the University's
Plant Services Division on a job-to
job basis, leaving the other main
tenance work for the two remaining
workers.
Stanford employees at Tresidder
are under Davidson's jurisdiction,
while the workers of Plant Services'

specialized shops work in all areas of
the University and cost a great deal
more per man-hour than employees
at Tresidder.
According to Bob Elmore, lead
worker of the Plant Services electric
shop, "Simple economics tell you
that Stanford employees are going to
cost the University a lot less money
(than Plant Services)."
Davidson, however, said the move
was a cost-effective one for the
Union because Elmore's figures do
not include the benefits and time for
vacations and breaks which Tres
idder had to cover, and because of
the extra time Tresidder main
tenance people need to do a job for
which they did not havetheexpertise
that some at Plant Services have.
Elmore said there is more than
enough maintenance work at Tres
idder to "keep him (Hernandez)
busy for a substantial amount of
time."

Elmore said that, with a couple of
afternoons of training from someone
in the electric shop, Hernandez
could have handled about 20 hours
of work in Tresidder each week, and
that most of this work will now be
given to the electric shop the sub
stantially higher cost.
The problems surrounding
Hernandez's layoff, however, con
cern more than economics.
Hernandez lost his job after working
with the Tresidder custodial/
maintenance crew for five years.
Hernandez and his fellow workers
said the decision proved especially
frustrating because he had agreed to
the move from his custodial position
into the maintenance job (at a higher
rate of pay) April 1, a few months
before that position's termination.
Hernandez said he was riot informed
that the position might be termi
nated, and Davidson said Tresidder
administration was not thinking of
such an option at the time.
Davidson said the decision to lay
Hernandez off was not based on dis
satisfaction with his work, and added
there are no formal letters of com
plaint in Hernandez's file.
Two students who worked at Tres
idder last summer while Hernandez
was there commented, however, that
he was not an efficient or diligent
worker.
Since his dismissal, Hernandez has
been offered two other jobs, equal to

or greater in pay than his previous
one, but said he has chosen to turn
them down and maintain his priority,
under union contract, to fill a spot on
the crew at Tresidder, should one
open up. "I know the people over
there at Tresidder," said
Hernandez," and I'd hate to leave
just like that."
Hernandez said he is also reluctant
to accept another job in the Univer
sity because he feels that it would be
a concession to unfair practices by
Tresidder management. Davidson,
however, said he felt the decision
was a fair one.
