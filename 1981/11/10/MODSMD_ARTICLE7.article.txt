# Tribal wars run deep on Chinese island
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Like America s Hatfields and
McCoys, the feuding clans of Hainan Is
land off the southern Chinese coast have
been enemies for generations, and over
the summer they resumed their warring
ways, fighting five pitched battles and raid
ing each other's villages.
Scores of people were injured and at
least three were killed in the fighting.
Dozens of houses were burned to the
ground; cattle, pigs and other livestock
were carried away; rice and other crops
were destroyed in the fields.
The rival villages in Hainan's Changliu
prefecture near Haikou City, the island's
main population center, were turned into
armed fortresses, surrounded by turreted
ramparts and defended by machine guns
and rockets as well as militiamen armed
with rifles.
Fields and ancestors
The object of the clan war, according to
the official Chinese press, appears to have

been control of the fertile fields around
Haikou. But there were probably deeper
roots as well. A radio report from Haikou
noted that each of the feuding clans had
refurbished its own special temples and
halls forancestor worship, usually an asser
tion of political authority by right of in
heritance.
Reporting that "large-scale armed clan
fighting occurred in Changliu" from June
through August, the radio commentary
said that order had been restored by a
"work team" of more than 600 policemen,
soldiers, militiamen and local officials un
der Communist Party leadership.
"Twenty-two ringleaders who had or
ganized armed clashes and those who had
led in (the restoration of) feudal super
stition, along with murderers, rapists,
looters and assailants, were arrested" by
late September, the radio report said, in
dicating that the roundup was continuing
and that some weapons had been con
fiscated.

This account, which has also appeared in
Guangdong provincial newspapers in dif
ferent forms recently, is the latest of a
series of reports of such feuds over the last
three years on Hainan, which is regarded
by most Chinese as inhabited by wild
tribes.
Much larger clashes were reported by
the dissident political journal Exploration
in 1979 — clashes said to involve tens of
thousands of combatants and more than
300 casualties. But these were never con
firmed officially. The main goal was to re
claim top political posts for local leaders,
ousted 25 years before on orders from Bei
jing.
Seize radio station
Later in 1979, protesters took over a local
radio station, broadcasting denunciations
of the government and the party before
police and troops ousted them.
Late in 1980, policeman in the area were
jailed for selling government arms to the
feuding families.
