## Vietnam, with few jobs, sends labor glut to E. Europe, USSR 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bangkok, Thailand — In a
program to help pay its huge
debts to the Soviet bloc, Viet
nam is sending thousands of
unskilled and semi-skilled
workers to the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, according
to Western diplomatic sources
and the Vietnamese Embassy
here.
One diplomatic source esti
mated that 50,000 workers are
being sent to the Soviet Union,
East Germany and Bulgaria. A
Vietnamese Embassy spokes
man said the number might
reach 100,000 before the end of
Vietnam's current five-year
plan in 1986.
Both Western and Vietnam
ese sources rejected the char
acterization by some Vietnam
ese refugees that the exported
workers are "slave labor."
Wages split
Some accounts of the ar
rangement indicate that the in
dividual Vietnamese workers
receive 40 percent of their
wages, with the other 60 per
cent being credited against
Vietnam's debt to its socialist
partners.
There is nothing to indicate
that the workers are being
forced to go, diplomatic
sources reported.
"The program makes a lot of
sense for all concerned," one
diplomat said. He noted that
Vietnam's economy is in dread
ful condition, with hundredsof
thousands unemployed. At the
same time, Soviet and Eastern
European factories can use
hard-working Vietnamese.
"There's a little something in
it for the worker, who has
enough money to send home
to his family," one diplomat
said. "And there's a good deal
in it for the Hanoi govern
ment."
"Actually, there's nothing
new about this program," a
Western diploma: who recent
ly visited Vietnam said. "What
is new is the numbers. There's
been a marked increase in the
number of flights leaving Viet
nam for Eastern Europe."
Flij>hl increase
Meanwhile, the Los Angeles
Times' Moscow correspon

dent, Robert Gillette, reported
that extra flights between Ha
noi and Moscow had been in
stituted since a reported July
agreer+ient covering travel. In
addition, the Czechoslovak air
line began weekly flights in Au
gust between Hanoi and
Prague with connections to
East Berlin, and the Bulgarian
airline inaugurated weekly ser
vice between Sofia and Ho Chi
Minh City (formerly Saigon),
with a stop in Mosc v.
Vietnam's foreign debt is es
timated at more than S3 billion,
and the annual interest of $240
million apparently added ur
gency to the worker export
program. Moreover, Moscow
is sending an estimated $1.1
billion a year in economic and
military aid, in part to sustain

Hanoi's occupation of Cam
bodia.
Vietnam can do little to re
pay this aid except to export its
unskilled and semi-skilled
workers.
Soviets need labor
Manpower is one of the So
viet Union's most urgent eco
nomic needs, especially in the
harsh reaches of Siberia where
accelerated development of
oil, gas and mineral resources,
along with industry, is essential
to Soviet economic vitality.
Last june, the Soviet State
Committee for Labor said 2 mil
lion jobs were vacant. Already,
several thousand Bulgarians,
mostly technicians and engi
neers, are working on projects
in the Soviet Union.
