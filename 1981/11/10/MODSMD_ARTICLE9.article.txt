Tehran â€” The Kurdish prob
lem, together with the prob
lems of security in Iran and ac
tions of the left-wing People's
Mujahedeen, continue to rank
foremost in the concerns of
Iranian authorities.
The seriousness of last
week's fighting at Bukan in
western Azerbaijan and the
presence of People's Mujahe
deen alongside the Kurdish
and Marxist Komuleh Party
guerrillas testify to persistent
armed opposition, observers
here say.
The incidents, it was noted,
came at a time when govern
ment spokesmen seem to be
stressing a general calm on the
domestic front after some 2230
executions announced by the
press since the ouster last June
20 of President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr.
Executions common
According to the prose
cutor-general, Hojatoleslam
Musavi Tabrizi, these execu
tions represent 5 percent of all
cases.
The hojetoleslam said of the
People's Mujahedeen opposi

tion, "Oh you men who have
the imam Khomeini confront
ing you, you who defile young
women in your hideouts, your
blood is defiled and if you are
killed, you will not be martyrs,"
he said.
The Saturday announcement
of the fighting in Bukan came
one day after the Iranian Dem
ocratic Party of Kurdistan an
nounced in Paris its intention
to join the National Council of
Iranian Resistance, which is led
by ex-president Bani-Sadr and
People's Mujahedeen leader
Masud Rajavi.
Shootings in north
Iranian television an
nounced Sunday that 19 per
sons belonging to or support
ing the Mujahedeen opposi
tion had been shot in Mashhad
and Khorassan in northeastern
Iran.
Three teachers, accused of
weapons possession and mem
bership in the People's Mu
jahedeen, were executed and
another 107 Mujahedeen were
arrested in Tehran during the
past month, the newspaper
Kayhan reported Sunday.
