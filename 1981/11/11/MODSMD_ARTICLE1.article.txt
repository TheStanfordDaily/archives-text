# Kennedy says no reversal likely for Zete suspension
## 
### Heather Millar 
University President Donald Kennedy said yesterday
that the administration will not reverse its decision re
garding the suspension of the Zeta Psi fraternity.
"I think the facts of the case clearly require a penalty at
least that strong," he told KZSU radio and residents of
Donner and Serra Halls who gathered in the Donner
lounge for one of the president's regular "sherry hour"
discussion sessions.
In response to questions regarding the legitimacy of
Associate Dean for Residential Education Norm Rob
inson's decision to suspend the Zetes, Kennedy said that
a review of the due process procedures as they relate to
individuals within a group would be a "reasonable un
dertaking."
"One of the great purposes of a university is to point
out the complexity of values," said Kennedy. In addition
to dealing with the Zetes, during more than an hour of
discussion, Kennedy touched on ihe lole of the Hoover
Institution and other issues.
Regarding whether the Hoover Institution's links to
the Reagan administration lends a partisan air to the Uni
versity, Kennedy said, "I think it is the danger of letting
politics influence the pursuit of knowledge, something
that every yniversity needs to worry about. I also think
that the Hoover Institution is substantially more ideol
ogically balanced than it was 10 or 15 years ago."
Kennedy also said that if the Hoover Institution sup
ported beliefs that he disagreed with, he felt free to
criticize them on their merit, but that he could not think
of any way in which the University should act to make it
more difficult for Hoover scholars to express their views.
Discussing the country's conservative trend in politics
led students to question Kennedy about the University's

support of affirmative action. An increased yield of
female and minority professors have been hired here re
cently, said Kennedy, but he admitted that the Univer
sity's efforts to recruit female and minority senior staff
needed to be improved.
He also said he was worried by the declining number
of minorities and women in graduate programs, which
he said have recently undergone the greatest losses here
since the middle '70s.
"If I had an extra dollar to spend, I think I would spend
it on affirmative action based on ethincity," said Ken
nedy, adding that he had found that affirmative action
based on economics was not as useful.
Responding to student concern about planned tuition
increases, which will make next year's tuition, room and
board bills close to $12,000, Kennedy voiced his support
for financial aid programs, saying that no student is of
fered or denied admission on the basis of his ability to
poay the full tuition.
With regard to the rape last Thursday morning of a
woman running near Stanford Stadium, Kennedy said
that the University is "definitely thinking about stepping
up security." Having a large campus is often an advan
tage, said the president, but in this case he said it was def
initely a disadvantage. He said steps were being taken to
improve the lighting on campus, but pointed out, "Bet
ter lighting doesn't help when the rape occurs at 10:30 in
the morning."
Toward the end of the discussion, the president
* (i ed various questions about academic requirements,
housing, and the University food service.
However, with regard to each issue, Kennedy stressed
that he possessed no "magic" to settle controversies.
