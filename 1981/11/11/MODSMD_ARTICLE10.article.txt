# Stanford improves energy efficiency to combat rate hikes

(PG&E) planstotripleitsenergy
rates in the near future, which
will challenge the University to
combat increasingly high elec
tricity costs.
Each year hearings are con
ducted to justify these in
creases, and according to
Energy Program Mar ger Lyn
da Weisberg, Stanford has par
ticipated in these hearings for
the past seven years. In the
latest rate decision the Univer
sity failed to keep PG&E from
tripling its costs.
In an effort to deal with these
raising prfces the University's
Energy Program has designed a
Facilities Services Action
Plan.
The Action Plan only affects
central campus buildings. Paul
Brewer, an energy office em
ployee, said the plan includes
energy efficiency improve
ments that will cut electricity
use.
The projects in the plan are

divided into three basic units
based on their expected com
pletion date. The first part are
those which can be finished
within one year of work. This
includes changes in the light
ing system.
The second part includes
those projects which will take
two to four years to complete.
It deals with the heating, ven
tilation, and air conditioning
systems.
The third part considers the
possibility of the University
building a congeneration
plant. It .would produce elec
tricity and steam simultane
ously, Brewer said.
The Plan was proposed by
Weisberg and is still being eval
uated. Several of the projects
are already being executed,
Brewer said.
Studentsare now required to
compensate the University for
energy costs of high energy use
items, such as refrigerators and
water beds, by paying annual
surcharges.
