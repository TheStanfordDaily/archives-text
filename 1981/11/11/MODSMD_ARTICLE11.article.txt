## Olympic speedskater slides into pre-med studies 
### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
What do you do after
you've won five Olympic
Gold Medals and three
world speedskating cham
pionships? If you're Eric
Heiden you begin a new
athletic career (cycling) and
a new academic career as a
Stanford pre-rned.
Heiden, a junior transfer
from the University of Wis
consin by way of UC-San Di
ego, is enjoying his
anonymity in his first quar
ter here.
"Here at Stanford, hardly
anybody knows who I am. I
love it,"he said."ln Madison
it got hard because ev
erybody knew who I
was,"he added.
Heiden was not well
known in the United States
before the 1980 Olympics,
(even though he had won
the world speedskating
champion hips in each of the
three previous years), be
cause speedskating is such a
minor sport here.
In Europe, where speed
skating is more popular,
Heiden was a hero."l could
handle being a celebrity
then because I could always
come back home and do the
things I wanted to do and no
one woutd recognize

me," he said.
All this changed during
the 1980 Olympics, when
every household in the
United States followed the
progress of the young man
from Wisconsin who kept
racking up gold medals with
huge margins of victory. Af
ter this, Heiden was recog
nized wherever he went in
the United States, which at
■first created problems for
him.
"In the beginning I was
always worried about trying
to impress everyone and
trying to live up tothe image
they had of me. Fora while I
started to go crazy until I
finally decided that I had to
do the things I wanted to do
and if that upsets people,
that's too bad," he ex
plained.
Right after the Olympics,
Heiden hired an attorney to
screen all interviews and to
take care of endorse
ments." That really helped
because I'm not very good
at saying no,"he said.
In choosing endorse
ments and advertisements,
Heiden has been highly
selective. Unlike several
past Olympic stars who have
completely exploited their
fame, Heiden has only done
endorsements for products
which he uses and about
which he is knowledgeable.

Heiden is presently work
ing fora sports clothing
company and a bicycle
company. "I don't want to
do things like a camera
commercial. Sure I use a
camera...But what type of
pictures does Eric Heiden
take?"he said.
"When you start to do a
lot of interviews and en
dorsements, people start to
own you," he added. Even
with the few endorsements
he has made, Heiden feels
the demands on his time are
great. In three to four years
his contracts run out and
Heiden is not certain
whether they will be re
newed.
Last year Heiden trans
ferred to UC San Diego
from the University of Wis
consin so that he could train
for cycling. During winter
quarter he and a friend took
a motorcycle trip to Stan
ford and Heiden decided to
transfer."l just loved the
area and I thought damn,
I'm going to try and get in
here,"he said, adding that
he was surprised he was ac
cepted.
Heiden said he enjoys
Stanford more than UC San
Diego because he feels stu
dents are friendlier here
and there are more activities
taking place. Compared to
the UniversUy of Wisconsin,

Heiden likes Stanford's
small size and the avail
ability of its faculty."lt may
be harder here, but you
have a more personal rela
tionship with the professors.
If you have a problem you
can sit down and figure out
what's going on,"he said.
Eventually Heiden would
like to enter the field of or
thopedics so that he would
be able to treat sports in
juries and to do research in
sports medicine. "Research
in sports medicine is really
lacking in America. Eastern
bloc countries have doctors
that travel with athletes all
the time doing tests. In
America it's just 'take a stab
in the dark and hope it
works.' If it works, pass it
on," he said.
In minor sports like speed
skating and cycling, Olym
pic hopefuls are on their
own until the Olympic year
when the U.S. Committee
sends a coach to help train
the athlete. Fortunately
Heiden and his sister, Beth,
crossed paths with former
Olympian speedskater
Diane Holum at an early age
and Holum was able to pro
vide steady guidance to
them for seven years prior
to the 1980 Olympics.
Besides coaching and
training the two Olympians,
Holum provided them with
inspiration."l don't think I
could have trained myself
harder than she
did," Heiden said.
Holum's inspirational let
ter two days before the 1977
world speedskating cham
pionships provided Heiden
with confidence for his first
major victory there. Until
that time, Heiden was rela
tively unknown in interna
tional speedskating."That's
when I realized that the
guys I was skating against
weren't 10 feet taller than I
was, and that I had trained
just as hard as they had," he
recalled.
After that, Heiden rarely
lostamajorcompetition. In
stead of racing against the
others, he raced against
himself. Heiden summed up
his racing philosophy then
and now: "It doesn't matter
whether I win or lose as long
as I do the best I can."
He i den's philosophy
enables him to laugh off his
last place finish in the 1981
5000 meter world cycling
championships, while it
makes him chastise himself
for not skating up to par in
the fourth race of the 1978
world skating cham
pionships — a competition
which he won. His attitude
is far different than the win
ning-is-the-only-goal at
titude of many world class
athletes.
The five victories at Lake
Placid were, according to
Heiden," five of the best
races I've ever skated."
Heiden prepared for those
as he prepares for all
races." The might before a
big race I'd sit down and pic
ture skating a perfect race in
my head,"he said.
"The next day before the
rate, the biggest thing for
me was just to realize that it
was going to hurt a lot —
and when it started to hurt
to be sure I had enough guts
to get through it. Ire

member a lot of times if I
didn't think about that, as
soon as it started to hurt I'd
just shine it,"he explained.
Immediately after the
Olympics, Heiden did
something he was planning
to do all along — give up
skating. "For seven years
skating owned me. I didn't
do anything else. It was like
a business, but one that I en
joyed."
Currently, Heiden is rac
ing as a pro fora bike team
sponsored by 7-11 and
Schwinn. Although he is
presently on a two-week
vacation, he will soon begin
an intense three to seven
hour daily schedule of train
ing. After that he will com
pete in cycling races all over
the country.
To Heiden, cycling is
more of a recreational ac
tivity."! only train when I
want to. But so far I've
always wanted to," he said.
How does Heiden bal
ance the long hours of train
ing required to be a pro
fessional cyclist with the
hours of studying required
of a Stanford student?
Part of the answer lies in
Heiden's well-developed
ability to work under pres
sure."l think it's good to
have two different things
that you concentrate hard
on. If you just have one, you
get kind of stagnant. You do
it but you don't allot your
time very well," he said.
Heiden has had years of
experience in balancing his
academic career with his
athletic career. At Wiscon
sin, Heiden attended school
in the summer and fall and
trained the rest of the year.
The year of the 1980 Olym
pics Heiden "blew ev
erything off" to concentrate
on skating.
With Heiden's family
background, it's not surpris
ing that he became a great
athlete. Hisfatheriscurrent
ly a national cycling cham
pion and his sister Beth,
besides being an Olympic
medal winner, is also a na
tional cycling champion.
According to Heiden,
Beth has given up cycling
fora new career in cross
country skiing. She is now
attending the University of
Vermont and is majoring in
applied math and physics.
Because of years of train
ing together, Heiden came
to view his Beth more as a
teammate than a sister."She
and I, I hate to say it, don't
get along so well. We've
gone our own directions.
Maybe now that we're not
training together we'll start
a normal brother-sister rela
tionship," he said.
Training for cycling and
speedskating, as well as stu
dying hard enough to get
into medical school re
quires a tremendous
amount of motivation.
Heiden has demonstrated
an abundance of motiva
tion. "I enjoy pushing my
self to the limit and the feel
ing that every day I've ac
complished something,"
Heiden said.
If the past is any indica
tion of the future, Heiden
should have no trouble in
achieving his specified
goals.

camera...But what type of
pictures does Eric Heiden
take?"he said.
"When you start to do a
lot of interviews and en
dorsements, people start to
own you," he added. Even
with the few endorsements
he has made, Heiden feels
the demands on his time are
great. In three to four years
his contracts run out and
Heiden is not certain
whether they will be re
newed.
Last year Heiden trans
ferred to UC San Diego
from the University of Wis
consin so that he could train
for cycling. During winter
quarter he and a friend took
a motorcycle trip to Stan
ford and Heiden decided to
transfer."l just loved the
area and I thought damn,
I'm going to try and get in
here,"he said, adding that
he was surprised he was ac
cepted.
Heiden said he enjoys
Stanford more than UC San
Diego because he feels stu
dents are friendlier here
and there are more activities
taking place. Compared to
the UniversUy of Wisconsin,

Heiden likes Stanford's
small size and the avail
ability of its faculty."lt may
be harder here, but you
have a more personal rela
tionship with the professors.
If you have a problem you
can sit down and figure out
what's going on,"he said.
Eventually Heiden would
like to enter the field of or
thopedics so that he would
be able to treat sports in
juries and to do research in
sports medicine. "Research
in sports medicine is really
lacking in America. Eastern
bloc countries have doctors
that travel with athletes all
the time doing tests. In
America it's just 'take a stab
in the dark and hope it
works.' If it works, pass it
on," he said.
In minor sports like speed
skating and cycling, Olym
pic hopefuls are on their
own until the Olympic year
when the U.S. Committee
sends a coach to help train
the athlete. Fortunately
Heiden and his sister, Beth,
crossed paths with former
Olympian speedskater
Diane Holum at an early age
and Holum was able to pro
vide steady guidance to
them for seven years prior
to the 1980 Olympics.
Besides coaching and
training the two Olympians,
Holum provided them with
inspiration."l don't think I
could have trained myself
harder than she
did," Heiden said.
Holum's inspirational let
ter two days before the 1977
world speedskating cham
pionships provided Heiden
with confidence for his first
major victory there. Until
that time, Heiden was rela
tively unknown in interna
tional speedskating."That's
when I realized that the
guys I was skating against
weren't 10 feet taller than I
was, and that I had trained
just as hard as they had," he
recalled.
After that, Heiden rarely
lostamajorcompetition. In
stead of racing against the
others, he raced against
himself. Heiden summed up
his racing philosophy then
and now: "It doesn't matter
whether I win or lose as long
as I do the best I can."
He i den's philosophy
enables him to laugh off his
last place finish in the 1981
5000 meter world cycling
championships, while it
makes him chastise himself
for not skating up to par in
the fourth race of the 1978
world skating cham
pionships — a competition
which he won. His attitude
is far different than the win
ning-is-the-only-goal at
titude of many world class
athletes.
The five victories at Lake
Placid were, according to
Heiden," five of the best
races I've ever skated."
Heiden prepared for those
as he prepares for all
races." The might before a
big race I'd sit down and pic
ture skating a perfect race in
my head,"he said.
"The next day before the
rate, the biggest thing for
me was just to realize that it
was going to hurt a lot —
and when it started to hurt
to be sure I had enough guts
to get through it. Ire

member a lot of times if I
didn't think about that, as
soon as it started to hurt I'd
just shine it,"he explained.
Immediately after the
Olympics, Heiden did
something he was planning
to do all along — give up
skating. "For seven years
skating owned me. I didn't
do anything else. It was like
a business, but one that I en
joyed."
Currently, Heiden is rac
ing as a pro fora bike team
sponsored by 7-11 and
Schwinn. Although he is
presently on a two-week
vacation, he will soon begin
an intense three to seven
hour daily schedule of train
ing. After that he will com
pete in cycling races all over
the country.
To Heiden, cycling is
more of a recreational ac
tivity."! only train when I
want to. But so far I've
always wanted to," he said.
How does Heiden bal
ance the long hours of train
ing required to be a pro
fessional cyclist with the
hours of studying required
of a Stanford student?
Part of the answer lies in
Heiden's well-developed
ability to work under pres
sure."l think it's good to
have two different things
that you concentrate hard
on. If you just have one, you
get kind of stagnant. You do
it but you don't allot your
time very well," he said.
Heiden has had years of
experience in balancing his
academic career with his
athletic career. At Wiscon
sin, Heiden attended school
in the summer and fall and
trained the rest of the year.
The year of the 1980 Olym
pics Heiden "blew ev
erything off" to concentrate
on skating.
With Heiden's family
background, it's not surpris
ing that he became a great
athlete. Hisfatheriscurrent
ly a national cycling cham
pion and his sister Beth,
besides being an Olympic
medal winner, is also a na
tional cycling champion.
According to Heiden,
Beth has given up cycling
fora new career in cross
country skiing. She is now
attending the University of
Vermont and is majoring in
applied math and physics.
Because of years of train
ing together, Heiden came
to view his Beth more as a
teammate than a sister."She
and I, I hate to say it, don't
get along so well. We've
gone our own directions.
Maybe now that we're not
training together we'll start
a normal brother-sister rela
tionship," he said.
Training for cycling and
speedskating, as well as stu
dying hard enough to get
into medical school re
quires a tremendous
amount of motivation.
Heiden has demonstrated
an abundance of motiva
tion. "I enjoy pushing my
self to the limit and the feel
ing that every day I've ac
complished something,"
Heiden said.
If the past is any indica
tion of the future, Heiden
should have no trouble in
achieving his specified
goals.

What do you do after
you've won five Olympic
Gold Medals and three
world speedskating cham
pionships? If you're Eric
Heiden you begin a new
athletic career (cycling) and
a new academic career as a
Stanford pre-rned.
Heiden, a junior transfer
from the University of Wis
consin by way of UC-San Di
ego, is enjoying his
anonymity in his first quar
ter here.
"Here at Stanford, hardly
anybody knows who I am. I
love it,"he said."ln Madison
it got hard because ev
erybody knew who I
was,"he added.
Heiden was not well
known in the United States
before the 1980 Olympics,
(even though he had won
the world speedskating
champion hips in each of the
three previous years), be
cause speedskating is such a
minor sport here.
In Europe, where speed
skating is more popular,
Heiden was a hero."l could
handle being a celebrity
then because I could always
come back home and do the
things I wanted to do and no
one woutd recognize

me," he said.
All this changed during
the 1980 Olympics, when
every household in the
United States followed the
progress of the young man
from Wisconsin who kept
racking up gold medals with
huge margins of victory. Af
ter this, Heiden was recog
nized wherever he went in
the United States, which at
■first created problems for
him.
"In the beginning I was
always worried about trying
to impress everyone and
trying to live up tothe image
they had of me. Fora while I
started to go crazy until I
finally decided that I had to
do the things I wanted to do
and if that upsets people,
that's too bad," he ex
plained.
Right after the Olympics,
Heiden hired an attorney to
screen all interviews and to
take care of endorse
ments." That really helped
because I'm not very good
at saying no,"he said.
In choosing endorse
ments and advertisements,
Heiden has been highly
selective. Unlike several
past Olympic stars who have
completely exploited their
fame, Heiden has only done
endorsements for products
which he uses and about
which he is knowledgeable.

Heiden is presently work
ing fora sports clothing
company and a bicycle
company. "I don't want to
do things like a camera
commercial. Sure I use a
camera...But what type of
pictures does Eric Heiden
take?"he said.

pionships provided Heiden
with confidence for his first
major victory there. Until
that time, Heiden was rela
tively unknown in interna
tional speedskating."That's
when I realized that the
guys I was skating against
weren't 10 feet taller than I
was, and that I had trained
just as hard as they had," he
recalled.
After that, Heiden rarely
lostamajorcompetition. In
stead of racing against the
others, he raced against
himself. Heiden summed up
his racing philosophy then
and now: "It doesn't matter
whether I win or lose as long
as I do the best I can."
He i den's philosophy
enables him to laugh off his
last place finish in the 1981
5000 meter world cycling
championships, while it
makes him chastise himself
for not skating up to par in
the fourth race of the 1978
world skating cham
pionships — a competition
which he won. His attitude
is far different than the win
ning-is-the-only-goal at
titude of many world class
athletes.
The five victories at Lake
Placid were, according to
Heiden," five of the best
races I've ever skated."
Heiden prepared for those
as he prepares for all
races." The might before a
big race I'd sit down and pic
ture skating a perfect race in
my head,"he said.
"The next day before the
rate, the biggest thing for
me was just to realize that it
was going to hurt a lot —
and when it started to hurt
to be sure I had enough guts
to get through it. Ire

member a lot of times if I
didn't think about that, as
soon as it started to hurt I'd
just shine it,"he explained.
Immediately after the
Olympics, Heiden did
something he was planning
to do all along — give up
skating. "For seven years
skating owned me. I didn't
do anything else. It was like
a business, but one that I en
joyed."
Currently, Heiden is rac
ing as a pro fora bike team
sponsored by 7-11 and
Schwinn. Although he is
presently on a two-week
vacation, he will soon begin
an intense three to seven
hour daily schedule of train
ing. After that he will com
pete in cycling races all over
the country.
To Heiden, cycling is
more of a recreational ac
tivity."! only train when I
want to. But so far I've
always wanted to," he said.
How does Heiden bal
ance the long hours of train
ing required to be a pro
fessional cyclist with the
hours of studying required
of a Stanford student?
Part of the answer lies in
Heiden's well-developed
ability to work under pres
sure."l think it's good to
have two different things
that you concentrate hard
on. If you just have one, you
get kind of stagnant. You do
it but you don't allot your
time very well," he said.
Heiden has had years of
experience in balancing his
academic career with his
athletic career. At Wiscon
sin, Heiden attended school
in the summer and fall and
trained the rest of the year.
The year of the 1980 Olym
pics Heiden "blew ev
erything off" to concentrate
on skating.
With Heiden's family
background, it's not surpris
ing that he became a great
athlete. Hisfatheriscurrent
ly a national cycling cham
pion and his sister Beth,
besides being an Olympic
medal winner, is also a na
tional cycling champion.
According to Heiden,
Beth has given up cycling
fora new career in cross
country skiing. She is now
attending the University of
Vermont and is majoring in
applied math and physics.
Because of years of train
ing together, Heiden came
to view his Beth more as a
teammate than a sister."She
and I, I hate to say it, don't
get along so well. We've
gone our own directions.
Maybe now that we're not
training together we'll start
a normal brother-sister rela
tionship," he said.
Training for cycling and
speedskating, as well as stu
dying hard enough to get
into medical school re
quires a tremendous
amount of motivation.
Heiden has demonstrated
an abundance of motiva
tion. "I enjoy pushing my
self to the limit and the feel
ing that every day I've ac
complished something,"
Heiden said.
If the past is any indica
tion of the future, Heiden
should have no trouble in
achieving his specified
goals.

What do you do after
you've won five Olympic
Gold Medals and three
world speedskating cham
pionships? If you're Eric
Heiden you begin a new
athletic career (cycling) and
a new academic career as a
Stanford pre-rned.
Heiden, a junior transfer
from the University of Wis
consin by way of UC-San Di
ego, is enjoying his
anonymity in his first quar
ter here.
"Here at Stanford, hardly
anybody knows who I am. I
love it,"he said."ln Madison
it got hard because ev
erybody knew who I
was,"he added.
Heiden was not well
known in the United States
before the 1980 Olympics,
(even though he had won
the world speedskating
champion hips in each of the
three previous years), be
cause speedskating is such a
minor sport here.
In Europe, where speed
skating is more popular,
Heiden was a hero."l could
handle being a celebrity
then because I could always
come back home and do the
things I wanted to do and no
one woutd recognize

me," he said.
All this changed during
the 1980 Olympics, when
every household in the
United States followed the
progress of the young man
from Wisconsin who kept
racking up gold medals with
huge margins of victory. Af
ter this, Heiden was recog
nized wherever he went in
the United States, which at
■first created problems for
him.
"In the beginning I was
always worried about trying
to impress everyone and
trying to live up tothe image
they had of me. Fora while I
started to go crazy until I
finally decided that I had to
do the things I wanted to do
and if that upsets people,
that's too bad," he ex
plained.
Right after the Olympics,
Heiden hired an attorney to
screen all interviews and to
take care of endorse
ments." That really helped
because I'm not very good
at saying no,"he said.
In choosing endorse
ments and advertisements,
Heiden has been highly
selective. Unlike several
past Olympic stars who have
completely exploited their
fame, Heiden has only done
endorsements for products
which he uses and about
which he is knowledgeable.

Heiden is presently work
ing fora sports clothing
company and a bicycle
company. "I don't want to
do things like a camera
commercial. Sure I use a
camera...But what type of
pictures does Eric Heiden
take?"he said.
"When you start to do a
lot of interviews and en
dorsements, people start to
own you," he added. Even
with the few endorsements
he has made, Heiden feels
the demands on his time are
great. In three to four years
his contracts run out and
Heiden is not certain
whether they will be re
newed.
Last year Heiden trans
ferred to UC San Diego
from the University of Wis
consin so that he could train
for cycling. During winter
quarter he and a friend took
a motorcycle trip to Stan
ford and Heiden decided to
transfer."l just loved the
area and I thought damn,
I'm going to try and get in
here,"he said, adding that
he was surprised he was ac
cepted.
Heiden said he enjoys
Stanford more than UC San
Diego because he feels stu
dents are friendlier here
and there are more activities
taking place. Compared to
the UniversUy of Wisconsin,

Heiden likes Stanford's
small size and the avail
ability of its faculty."lt may
be harder here, but you
have a more personal rela
tionship with the professors.
If you have a problem you
can sit down and figure out
what's going on,"he said.
Eventually Heiden would
like to enter the field of or
thopedics so that he would
be able to treat sports in
juries and to do research in
sports medicine. "Research
in sports medicine is really
lacking in America. Eastern
bloc countries have doctors
that travel with athletes all
the time doing tests. In
America it's just 'take a stab
in the dark and hope it
works.' If it works, pass it
on," he said.
In minor sports like speed
skating and cycling, Olym
pic hopefuls are on their
own until the Olympic year
when the U.S. Committee
sends a coach to help train
the athlete. Fortunately
Heiden and his sister, Beth,
crossed paths with former
Olympian speedskater
Diane Holum at an early age
and Holum was able to pro
vide steady guidance to
them for seven years prior
to the 1980 Olympics.
Besides coaching and
training the two Olympians,
Holum provided them with
inspiration."l don't think I
could have trained myself
harder than she
did," Heiden said.
Holum's inspirational let
ter two days before the 1977
world speedskating cham
pionships provided Heiden
with confidence for his first
major victory there. Until
that time, Heiden was rela
tively unknown in interna
tional speedskating."That's
