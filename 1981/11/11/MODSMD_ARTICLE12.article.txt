For the past three
years Theta Xi had
struggled to meet
the housing quota
and failed. But last
spring, Theta Xi f s
only problem was
finding space for
all the new
pledges.

all the new pledges — 23 new
members joined the house.
Thissummer the 32 members
of Theta Xi arrived weeks
before other students in order
to "fix up" the fraternity.
Their work not only at
tended to maintenance, but
signaled a time to regroup and
assimilate the many new faces
into a fraternity that nearly
sank as a result of not meeting
the university housing quota.
According to Andy Fisher,
Theta Xi pledge, there was a
group of male freshmen living
in Branner who belonged to
the exclusive "4000 Club"
(those that drew over 4000 in
the Spring housing draw).
With no hope of living in 558
Mayfield, Alpha Sig, or even
the trailers, many of them dove
head first into the pool of
fraternity spring rush parties,
but emerged with dampened
hopes about fraternity living.
To solve the dilemma, a list
was put up in Branner for all
those interested in living in
Theta Xi, a fraternity eager for
members. Much to everyone's
surprise, 45 Branner residents
signed the list.
At an organizational meeting
held in Branner for these in
terested in pledging the
fraternity, Fisher recalled a
general opinion that was

voiced: Theta Xi had great
potential. Moreover, its poten
tial would set it apart from most
other fraternities.
"We agreed that we did not
want to pattern ourselves after
someone else. We did not want
to do activities just because
other fraternities did them,"
said Fisher.
Ideas began to fly at the
meeting about future plans for
the house: relandscaping, re
building the downstairs and re
juvenating the house in gener
al were all proposed for the fol
lowing summer. Furthermore,
each person donated $50 to
go toward house repairs.
The Theta Xi actives had the
Branner group up for dinner at
the end of rush to informally
discuss bringing them into the
house. But there was nothing
to discuss. The actives slapped
bids on the table and the soon
to be pledges (24 in all) signed
them without hesitation.
Many house members had
fears about the house turning
into "old Branner," said house
President Tom Hempel. Ac
cording to Fisher, some of the
pledges foresaw an "us/them"
living situation.
But both Fisher and Hemp< I
said that it was not a question of
a big takeover, but rather a new
and positive transition. From
the perspective of Theta Xi
House Associate (R.A.) Mike
Trainor, "The biggest
challenge of bringing the
groups together did not mate
rialize. After the first work day
it was apparent everybody was
working as one group, not
two."
Theta Xi is now running
smoothly, said Hempel. "A few
years ago people were in
terested in themselves, but
now people are interested in
the house."
Members have been
brought closer together
through a number of house ac
tivities this quarter. Since
playing broom ball in an ice
rink and caravanning to the
Rolling Stones concert, house
members agree that the Friday
dinner series — where one
house member cooks dinner
for the entire house as well as
invited guests, has been espe
cially sucessful in promoting
unity.
And, Theta Xi has many plans
for the future, said Hempel.
Not only has "The Taxi" ar
rived, it is speeding ahead.
