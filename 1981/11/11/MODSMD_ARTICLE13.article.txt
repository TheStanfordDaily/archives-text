## Don't rehire air controllers 
### 
You know you're in trouble when the maxims of the
late President Calvin Coolidge can be brought out,
dusted off and invoked successfully against you. Such
was the recent plight of the Professional Air Traffic Con
trollers Organization (PATCO).
While serving as governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge
became a national hero overnight by refusing to arbi
trate the 1919 Boston police strike. His words to Samuel
Gompers more than 60 years ago haunted PATCO
throughout this summer's walkout: "There is no right to
strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere,
anytime."
With the October 22 decertification ruling by the Fed
eral Labor Relations Authority, it would seem that the
last nail has been driven into the battered PATCO coffin.
Don't bet on it.
The U.S. Court of Appeals has yet to pass judgement.
Talk is flying about that a new air controllers' union is
soon to be formed and that President Ronald Reagan is
planning as a Christmas present the rehiring of many of
the fired controllers. Now is a good time to rethink the
PATCO problem.
The president moved quickly to condemn the August
3 walkout. He enacted emergency air safety measures,
fined the union, fired the strikers and moved for de
certification of PATCO.
Reagan correctly saw that public opinion and the rule
of law were solidly behind his actions. Should hetakethe
next logical step — to allow the controllers who re
mained on the job to reorganize, but to reject the temp
tation to rehire some of the strikers — it will become ap
parent that the earlier mandates fora tough stand have
not evaporated.
Independent of any presidential action, the higher
courts must affirm the FRLA ruling. By calling an illegal
strike, PATCO has forfeited its status under Nixon's Ex
ecutive Order 11491 as the air controllers' exclusive
bargaining agent. Union President Richard Poli and his
colleagues have additionally surrendered their right to
collect dues from the 2000 PATCO members who dis
obeyed union orders and remained on the job.
Reagan should encourage these remaining controllers
to form another collective bargaining unit. Public em
ployee unions are not inevitably antithetical to "the pub
lic safety." They can and do serve valuable purposes, in
cluding serving as a mechanism for the synthesis of a di
verse membership's needs and wants, and representing
these aggregate goals in negotiations with supervisors.
Reagan need not fear that a reorganization will com
promise the sanctity of the federal employees' oath not
to strike; since the core of a new union will be those con

trollers who did not leave their posts, there should be no
problem obtaining renewed adherence to the no-strike
clause.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland urged Reagan to re
hire the controllers, arguing that "any continued ven
detta against these workers and their families would not
be justice, but revenge." Kirkland's view is limited and
predictable. It is also wrong. There are compelling rea
sons why the striking controllers should not be rehired
en masse.
Kirkland fails to appreciate the fundamental dif
ferences between private employee strikes and those in
the public sector. Workers in private industry have a
right to withhold their labor in order to increase or main
tain their share in the gains produced through their
work. Public employees are not part of a profit-making
enterprise; a public employee strike is therefore the
withholding of services in order to inflict injury 011 and
extort concessions from the taxpaying public.
As Robert Wesson, Hoover Institution senior fellow,
noted, "the legitimate right to strike should be kept sep
arate from the illegitimate claim of public servants to
promote their self-interest at the public expense."
According to Public Opinion the American people
have traditionally recognized the right of public employ
ees to join unions, "but havejustasconsistentlyopposed
the right to strike." An August Lewis Harris and As
sociates poll showed that by 69 to 27 percent, Americans
agreed with this statement - "Since every air traffic con
troller took an oath not to strike. Reagan was right to fire
them."
This consensus may have de lined somewhat, since a
recent Callup/Newsweek poll showed that by 44 to 42
percent, Americans disapproved of thegovernment's re
fusing "to rehire striking air controllers because they
broke the law even if it takes more than a year to bring air
traffic back to normal."
Yet, since the latter poll failed to define what con
stitutes "normal" air traffic, to collect public opinion on
"acceptable" levels of air traffic, or to examine public
awareness of the public/private distinctions, its results
are inconclusive. If Reagan is swayed by this poll, he will
make a tragicand self-defeating mistake. Therecurrently
exists no popular mandate for an end to a tough stand
against the striking controllers.
If Reagan is at all convinced of the need to send the
correct signal to other public unions, he will not rehire
the striking controllers. Any large-scale rehiring would
send a message to those unions that the administration
was merely posturing in its recent tough approach to the
illegal walkout.

ployee unions are not inevitably antithetical to "the pub
lic safety." They can and do serve valuable purposes, in
cluding serving as a mechanism for the synthesis of a di
verse membership's needs and wants, and representing
these aggregate goals in negotiations with supervisors.
Reagan need not fear that a reorganization will com
promise the sanctity of the federal employees' oath not
to strike; since the core of a new union will be those con

trollers who did not leave their posts, there should be no
problem obtaining renewed adherence to the no-strike
clause.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland urged Reagan to re
hire the controllers, arguing that "any continued ven
detta against these workers and their families would not
be justice, but revenge." Kirkland's view is limited and
predictable. It is also wrong. There are compelling rea
sons why the striking controllers should not be rehired
en masse.
Kirkland fails to appreciate the fundamental dif
ferences between private employee strikes and those in
the public sector. Workers in private industry have a
right to withhold their labor in order to increase or main
tain their share in the gains produced through their
work. Public employees are not part of a profit-making
enterprise; a public employee strike is therefore the
withholding of services in order to inflict injury 011 and
extort concessions from the taxpaying public.
As Robert Wesson, Hoover Institution senior fellow,
noted, "the legitimate right to strike should be kept sep
arate from the illegitimate claim of public servants to
promote their self-interest at the public expense."
According to Public Opinion the American people
have traditionally recognized the right of public employ
ees to join unions, "but havejustasconsistentlyopposed
the right to strike." An August Lewis Harris and As
sociates poll showed that by 69 to 27 percent, Americans
agreed with this statement - "Since every air traffic con
troller took an oath not to strike. Reagan was right to fire
them."
This consensus may have de lined somewhat, since a
recent Callup/Newsweek poll showed that by 44 to 42
percent, Americans disapproved of thegovernment's re
fusing "to rehire striking air controllers because they
broke the law even if it takes more than a year to bring air
traffic back to normal."
Yet, since the latter poll failed to define what con
stitutes "normal" air traffic, to collect public opinion on
"acceptable" levels of air traffic, or to examine public
awareness of the public/private distinctions, its results
are inconclusive. If Reagan is swayed by this poll, he will
make a tragicand self-defeating mistake. Therecurrently
exists no popular mandate for an end to a tough stand
against the striking controllers.
If Reagan is at all convinced of the need to send the
correct signal to other public unions, he will not rehire
the striking controllers. Any large-scale rehiring would
send a message to those unions that the administration
was merely posturing in its recent tough approach to the
illegal walkout.

You know you're in trouble when the maxims of the
late President Calvin Coolidge can be brought out,
dusted off and invoked successfully against you. Such
was the recent plight of the Professional Air Traffic Con
trollers Organization (PATCO).
While serving as governor of Massachusetts, Coolidge
became a national hero overnight by refusing to arbi
trate the 1919 Boston police strike. His words to Samuel
Gompers more than 60 years ago haunted PATCO
throughout this summer's walkout: "There is no right to
strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere,
anytime."
With the October 22 decertification ruling by the Fed
eral Labor Relations Authority, it would seem that the
last nail has been driven into the battered PATCO coffin.
Don't bet on it.
The U.S. Court of Appeals has yet to pass judgement.
Talk is flying about that a new air controllers' union is
soon to be formed and that President Ronald Reagan is
planning as a Christmas present the rehiring of many of
the fired controllers. Now is a good time to rethink the
PATCO problem.
The president moved quickly to condemn the August
3 walkout. He enacted emergency air safety measures,
fined the union, fired the strikers and moved for de
certification of PATCO.
Reagan correctly saw that public opinion and the rule
of law were solidly behind his actions. Should hetakethe
next logical step — to allow the controllers who re
mained on the job to reorganize, but to reject the temp
tation to rehire some of the strikers — it will become ap
parent that the earlier mandates fora tough stand have
not evaporated.
Independent of any presidential action, the higher
courts must affirm the FRLA ruling. By calling an illegal
strike, PATCO has forfeited its status under Nixon's Ex
ecutive Order 11491 as the air controllers' exclusive
bargaining agent. Union President Richard Poli and his
colleagues have additionally surrendered their right to
collect dues from the 2000 PATCO members who dis
obeyed union orders and remained on the job.
