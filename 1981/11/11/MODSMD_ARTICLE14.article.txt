## Time to freeze nuclear arms 
### 
There are currently more than
50,000 nuclear warheads on this
planet. The United States possess
30,000; the Soviets possess 20,000.
Most of these weapons have a radio
active content hundreds of times
larger than the weapons which
brought immense suffering upon
Hiroshima.
Incredibly, men in high positions
in this country argue that our nuclear
arsenal should be expanded. I be
lieve that the rationale for this argu
ment should be subject to public
scrutiny. A concern often expressed
is "The Soviets could launch a first
strike nuclear attack which would
leave us unable or unwilling to re
taliate."
The United States has 5000 weap
ons aboard submarines. Three
thousand of these weapons are con
stantly at sea and thus invulnerable to
a first-strike attack. We have 1052
land-based missiles. The Soviets
could destroy 80 percent of these

(perhaps 90 percent by 1985) with a
first strike.
This leaves more than 100 missiles,
each with approximately three inde
pendent warheads. These alone
could severely damage each of the
218 Soviet cities with a population of
100,000 or more. We also have 450
bombers equipped with nuclear
weapons. One-third of these are
always on a five minute alert. This
amounts to another 1000 nuclear
weapons available to strike the Soviet
Union.
This is a retaliatory force of more
than 5000 weapons â€” quite enough
to utterly destroy Soviet civilization,
not withstanding any conceivable
civil defense. A first-strike attack by
the Soviets against our ground-based
missiles and bombers would leave 20
million Americans dead. This is 20
times the combined American
deaths during the Civil War, the two
world wars, Korea, and Vietnam. I
have no doubt that a first-strike at

tack would provoke our government
to employ its retaliatory force.
Our government plans to build
20,000 nuclear weapons over the next
decade, replacing 10,000 old ones.
This net increase of 10,000 is, at best,
unnecessary. The military advantage
of thisexpanded arsenal doesnot jus
tify the increased likelihood of full
scale nuclear war that it creates.
Our continued arms build-up will
justify a continued Soviet build-up.
The United States began the nuclear
arms race. The Soviets have been
striving since 1945 to catch up, dupli
cating each of our technological in
novations within five years. It is by no
means certain, but by no means im
possible that the Soviet Union will
also follow us in a bilateral freeze of
testing, production, and deployment
of nuclear weapons.
