ASSU contested process, not final Zete ouster

The front-page article "ASSU con
tests Zete decision," (Daily, Nov. 9),
requires immediate clarification. The
ASSU senate seeks to rectify arbi
trariness of the decision-making
process, and not necessarily to indict
the decision itself.
At present, senators can find no
written statement describing the pol
icies used by the University to sanc
tion student groups.
Last Tuesday, the senate passed a
resolution requesting that the Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
convene to establish guidelines out
lining:
•acceptable conduct for student
groups on campus, and;
the procedure by which the Univer

sity can enforce such rules of con
duct.
Calling fora modification of the
decision-making procedure, thesen
ate strives to ensure the fair and
equal treatment of every student
group on campus.
The headline, "ASSU contests Zete
decision," misinterprets the inten
tion of the senate. Dave Phelps, sen
ate chairperson, made clear the aim
of the resolution in a letter accompa
nying that resolution.
He said, "The ASSU does not con
done any past actions of the Zeta Psi
Fraternity." He added, "The ASSU is
not passing judgement on either the
findings of the Office of Residential
Education, or on the final sanctions

that the Ad Hoc Committee on Zeta
Psi levied against the whole group."
We call for regulations to govern
the decision-making process (for ex
ample, guidelines to determine how
Ad Hoc Committee members are
chosen) and not necessarily fora new
decision.
For my part, the behavior of the
Zetes merits nothing less than the
punishment meted out to the entire
Zete fraternity. Although numerous
acts of destruction and violence (in
cluding, most recently, the tossing of
a Mills College woman into a pond as
if she were a football) were com
mitted by individuals, they can be
taken to reflect on the group as a
whole. It is an attitudinal problem
within the Zete house itself which al
lows individuals within it to commit
acts of desttuction toward property
and, more importantly, violence
toward women.

Alcohol policy lacking
Sometimes it takes a tragedy ... or
several tragedies ... to awaken peo
ple to the reality around them. Ihe
events of the last two weeks should
have shaken all of us at Stanford out
of our slumber. Yet, 10 days after a fa
tal car accident, the disbanding of
Zeta Psi, and the trashing ol the Res
Ed office, I see little inclination on the
part of anyone to address the real
problem — alcohol abuse on the

campus.
The consumption of alcohol here
has reached the level of institutional
disgrace, and in far too many cases, of
personal tragedy.
What happens on this campus is
but a reflection of society in general,
you may say. Does that make it right?
Must we continue to mimic the per
sonal degradation and the killing
which society has come to accept as
inevitable?
The roots of this problem lie in the
University's liquor policy, which,
simply stated, makes each person
"responsible for his own actions."
Unfortunately, many persons under
21 and over 21 do not possess suffi
cient maturity to accept this
challenge.
Lacking in Stanford's policy is the
call for collective responsibility to
show caring and love for one another
. . . the kind I saw, heard and felt at
the memorial service for Kevin
McMillan and Michael Becker last
week.
Hasn't the time come to place alco
hol in perspective, to force it off of
center stage? We can be creative
about this effort, like promoting
evpnts and activities which build
quality relationships between peo
ple. And placing alcohol in the back
ground at such events or leaving it
out altogether at times. And caring
enough for problem drinkers to con
front and help them.
