## AWACS sale significance inaccurately downplayed 
### 
I would like to respond to Alec
Rawls' column (Daily, Nov. 5). The
comments and statements made
concerning the AWACS vote and Is
rael's tole in the peace process are
both inaccurate and insulting, and
need correction.
Rawls lightly disclaims the military
significance of the sale, stating that it
is "stupid but pale beside the politi
cal significance." He fails, however,
to recognize the fact that the United
States declined to sell AWACS to
Sweden dueto a "highsecurity risk."
In addition, the United States
doesn't allow NATO to run the few
AWACS it has; they are all strictly
guarded and run only by U.S. per
sonnel. Thus, with such closely
guarded and restricted military
equipment being sold to Saudi Ara
bia, which lies disturbingly close to
Moarnar Khadafy's Soviet-backed
Lybia, the military importance of
these weapons cannot be lightly
treated.
Second, Rawls fails to note that the
sale includes more than just planes.
Included in the total package are
multiple ejection racks and Side
winder missiles, which have been
consistently deemed by both the
Pentagon and the State Department
as "disastrous if in the wrong hand."
Thus, the United States stands to
lose what military edge it does main
tain over t,he Soviets if these weapons
end up in Soviet hands. Those who
feel this unlikely need only to be re
minded of the revolution in Iran —
supposedly a stable country — two
years ago and of the amount of weap
ons and intelligence material lost.
Therefore, the military significance
of this sale is anything but "pale."
Rawls states that "Israeli in
transigence and foot dragging (in the
peace progress) have been aimed
largely at consolidating their land
grabbing on the West Bank." First, Is
rael rloes not practice a policy of
"foot dragging" towards peace.

Though emphasis has been placed
011 how much the late President
Anwar Sadat conceded in the Camp
David accords, the fact is Israel has al
ready given up numerous oil wells
which it developed itself, and is giv
ing up the entire Sinai Peninsula, re
locating its defense line, dismantling
the military government in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, withdrawing its
troops, and is working towards
Pealestinian autonomy. Entire towns
and military installations will be
abandoned next April. Egypt con
ceded nothing on this scale.
Secondly, concerning Israel's
"land grabbing," a short recap of the
history of the area will show how
much "land grabbing" has been, and
is, going on. The West Bank is a
brand-new term for the areas his
torically known as Samaria and
Judea. In 1948, Trans-Jordan, a coun
try formed by the British in 1922, at
tacked the newly-formed country of
Israel. Led by English General Glubb,
theareanow knownas the West Bank,
as well as the eastern half of Jerusa
lem, was seized.
In 1967, Israel was again attacked
by Egypt, Syria, and the re-named
Jordan. War broke out and Israel cap
tured the West Bank up to the Jordan
River. It is interesting to note that in
the 19 years before the 1967 war,
when the West Bank was under Arab
rule, no thought had been given to
forming a Palestinian state, which
Rawls feels is the key to solving the
Mideast situation.
Indeed, the idea of such a state was
rejected by the Arabs themselves
when the U.N. proposed the idea; Is
rael accepted and supported such a
state. Thus, it is ironic that the Arabs
demand now that Israel do for the
West Bank what they were unwilling
to do at a time when Israel had no say
in the matter.
Rawls claims that "land grabbing

and subjugation are not the way to
security for Israel." As stated, Israeli
policies do not include any such
"land grabbing." Also, the plan for
the West Bank according to the
Camp David accords, provides for
Egypt, Isreal, and any Palestinians and
Jordanians willing to participate, to
negotiate the formation of a self-gov
erning authority for the areas that
will sit for five years. By the end of the
first three years of this interim peri
od, the negotiators are to work out a
permanent solution to both the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. This is hardly
"subjugation."
Finally, Rawls says that "I don't
doubt that, if they could, the Begin
government, and probably a majority
of Israelis, would wish the Palesti
nians out of ever having existed." I
question whether Rawls has ever
been to Israel, or whether he has
talked to a "majority of Israelis" in or
der to qualify such a statement.
I was in Israel this summer, and a
majority of the Israelis I talked to do
not want to "wish the Palestinians out
of existence." Rather they are tired of
war and hostility and wish a settle
ment of this issue, as well as peace in
the Middle East. Rawls is right when
lie himself says in his article that,
"The Jews have also been a displaced
people." Why, then, would they
want to displace others?
The issues which Rawls raises must
be dealt with on a rational, objective
basis, and every effort must be made
to try and find a solution acceptable
to all parties involved. Just as Rawls
himself says that Israel is dragging its
feet, insulting words such as "land
grabbing," "intransigence," and
"subjugation" don't help to resolve
issues either. Not only is resorting to
name calling bad politics, it's bad
journalism as well.

River. It is interesting to note that in
the 19 years before the 1967 war,
when the West Bank was under Arab
rule, no thought had been given to
forming a Palestinian state, which
Rawls feels is the key to solving the
Mideast situation.
Indeed, the idea of such a state was
rejected by the Arabs themselves
when the U.N. proposed the idea; Is
rael accepted and supported such a
state. Thus, it is ironic that the Arabs
demand now that Israel do for the
West Bank what they were unwilling
to do at a time when Israel had no say
in the matter.
Rawls claims that "land grabbing

and subjugation are not the way to
security for Israel." As stated, Israeli
policies do not include any such
"land grabbing." Also, the plan for
the West Bank according to the
Camp David accords, provides for
Egypt, Isreal, and any Palestinians and
Jordanians willing to participate, to
negotiate the formation of a self-gov
erning authority for the areas that
will sit for five years. By the end of the
first three years of this interim peri
od, the negotiators are to work out a
permanent solution to both the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. This is hardly
"subjugation."
Finally, Rawls says that "I don't
doubt that, if they could, the Begin
government, and probably a majority
of Israelis, would wish the Palesti
nians out of ever having existed." I
question whether Rawls has ever
been to Israel, or whether he has
talked to a "majority of Israelis" in or
der to qualify such a statement.
I was in Israel this summer, and a
majority of the Israelis I talked to do
not want to "wish the Palestinians out
of existence." Rather they are tired of
war and hostility and wish a settle
ment of this issue, as well as peace in
the Middle East. Rawls is right when
lie himself says in his article that,
"The Jews have also been a displaced
people." Why, then, would they
want to displace others?
The issues which Rawls raises must
be dealt with on a rational, objective
basis, and every effort must be made
to try and find a solution acceptable
to all parties involved. Just as Rawls
himself says that Israel is dragging its
feet, insulting words such as "land
grabbing," "intransigence," and
"subjugation" don't help to resolve
issues either. Not only is resorting to
name calling bad politics, it's bad
journalism as well.

I would like to respond to Alec
Rawls' column (Daily, Nov. 5). The
comments and statements made
concerning the AWACS vote and Is
rael's tole in the peace process are
both inaccurate and insulting, and
need correction.
Rawls lightly disclaims the military
significance of the sale, stating that it
is "stupid but pale beside the politi
cal significance." He fails, however,
to recognize the fact that the United
States declined to sell AWACS to
Sweden dueto a "highsecurity risk."
In addition, the United States
doesn't allow NATO to run the few
AWACS it has; they are all strictly
guarded and run only by U.S. per
sonnel. Thus, with such closely
guarded and restricted military
equipment being sold to Saudi Ara
bia, which lies disturbingly close to
Moarnar Khadafy's Soviet-backed
Lybia, the military importance of
these weapons cannot be lightly
treated.
Second, Rawls fails to note that the
sale includes more than just planes.
Included in the total package are
multiple ejection racks and Side
winder missiles, which have been
consistently deemed by both the
Pentagon and the State Department
as "disastrous if in the wrong hand."
Thus, the United States stands to
lose what military edge it does main
tain over t,he Soviets if these weapons
end up in Soviet hands. Those who
feel this unlikely need only to be re
minded of the revolution in Iran —
supposedly a stable country — two
years ago and of the amount of weap
ons and intelligence material lost.
Therefore, the military significance
of this sale is anything but "pale."
Rawls states that "Israeli in
transigence and foot dragging (in the
peace progress) have been aimed
largely at consolidating their land
grabbing on the West Bank." First, Is
rael rloes not practice a policy of
"foot dragging" towards peace.

Though emphasis has been placed
011 how much the late President
Anwar Sadat conceded in the Camp
David accords, the fact is Israel has al
ready given up numerous oil wells
which it developed itself, and is giv
ing up the entire Sinai Peninsula, re
locating its defense line, dismantling
the military government in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, withdrawing its
troops, and is working towards
Pealestinian autonomy. Entire towns
and military installations will be
abandoned next April. Egypt con
ceded nothing on this scale.
Secondly, concerning Israel's
"land grabbing," a short recap of the
history of the area will show how
much "land grabbing" has been, and
is, going on. The West Bank is a
brand-new term for the areas his
torically known as Samaria and
Judea. In 1948, Trans-Jordan, a coun
try formed by the British in 1922, at
tacked the newly-formed country of
Israel. Led by English General Glubb,
theareanow knownas the West Bank,
as well as the eastern half of Jerusa
lem, was seized.
In 1967, Israel was again attacked
by Egypt, Syria, and the re-named
Jordan. War broke out and Israel cap
tured the West Bank up to the Jordan
River. It is interesting to note that in
the 19 years before the 1967 war,
when the West Bank was under Arab
rule, no thought had been given to
forming a Palestinian state, which
