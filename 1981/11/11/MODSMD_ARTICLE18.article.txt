# Rockclimbers getting high with Alpine Club

Ihere's a dirty wind hlowin'
through the sky,
Autumn leaves cut loose and
fly,
Leave me standing here,
Wishing I could follow. . .

"On belay?" I shouted at the
rock wall that rose from the
trail where I stood in the mid
day sun.
"Belay on!" cried a distant
voice above me.
"Climbing!" I called out,
starting towards the face of the
outcropping.
"Climb on!" said the rock
voice, clearing me to begin my
ascent.
I reached out to the grey
white barrier that stretched
from my feet to the top, some
100 feet above. For the first
time, I seriously questioned
what I was about to do.
"As an athlete," I silently told
myself, "I have challenged my
body to respond to difficult
and sometimes even danger
ous actions plenty of times
before. Past performances
have demonstrated my physi
cal capabilities time and time

again: regardless of my initial
fears, I have generally suc
ceeded in the face of adversity
and I will succeed again this in
stance."
Encouraged by this line of
reasoning, I took hold of a
prominent rock before me and
began to climb.
"But," my self responded,
"was the danger ever so im
mediate, those times you faced
it in the past? Did it increase
proportionately as you con
tinued, as safety moved farther
and farther below until even
tually returning as you ap
proached the top, the end of
the challenge? And did those
previous challenges demand
the same degree of steady
meditation upon the danger,
filling each moment with im
mediacy, yet somehow, life."
"Chuck the philosophy and
get on with it,"a voice said
within me.

Greg Larson stood on the
summit of Goat Rock and de
scribed rockclimbing and the
Alpine Club to a group of six
neophyte climbers, sitting
around him on the mid-morn
ing of their first climb.

Acting as club coordinator,
Larson told us that the Alpine
C.luh is one of the oldest clubs
on campus, with activities dat
ing back nearly 50 years. Or
ganized in order to bring to
gether members of the Stan
ford community who ap
preciate natural playgrounds
such as Goat Rock, the club is
experiencing a great deal of
popularity this year.
The group attracts a special
breed of people who believe in
enjoying themselves outside,
doing things that many non
members don't quite under
stand.
Like climbing on rocks.
"I think a lot of it is the de
lirium of being down safely,"
said junior Steve D'Hondt
when asked to describe his en
joyment of rockclimbing.
D'Hondt is the director of
Stanford Tresidder Outdoor
Programs (STOPS), which of
fers financial and organiza

tional support to campus out
door groups such as the Alpine
Club and the Outing Club.
However, In? and Larson, who
is assistant director of Tresidder
Union, are out climbing rocks
on Saturday afternoons as a
matter of choice rather than
duty.
As instructors, Larson and
D'Hondt led the attentive
group through several basic
knot-tying lessons, followed by
20 frustrating minutes of trying
to successfully tie one's climb
ing harness to one's self. My
personal conclusion was that
tying a water knot, the knot re
quired to complete the har
ness, was not easy as it looked.
Once strapped into the har
nesses, the group next became
familiar with the safety features
used by rockclimbers.
Each climber takes a turn at
tying the belay rope to his har
ness and making a practice as
cent up an easy ledgp, rising

perhaps 10 feet from the
ground. On the top side of the
ledge another member fastens
his harness to a secure rock so
that he cannot be pulled down
by the weight of the climber
below.
As the person below makes
his way up the side of the
ledge, the person above
"belays" the climber, steadily
reeling in the rope around his
body with both hands so that
the climber cannot fall if a slip
occurs.
As the climbers approached
the top, each was directed to
let go of the rock in order to
simulate a fall. Although it was
difficult to intentionally violate
the instinct to hang on for dear
life, an important sense of se
curity developed in each of us
as a result of being successfully
caught.
And it's important to under
stand that any sense of security
developed in a new rock

climber is critical.
As Larson put it,"In rock
climb'ng there are a lot of
things that are coun
terintuitive. . .that just don't
seem natural. You have to learn
to overcome that fear of fa 11 -
ing."

About 40 teet off the ground
I realized that in my initial burst
of exhilaration I was climbing
too fast.
"It's not a race," I warned
myself; yet finding ways to re
lax at that altitude was not easy.
Soon I began to accept the
reality that rockclimbing is an
inch-by-inch endeavor, It be
came a process of exploration
and selection: searching out
the next foothold or handhold,
then evaluating the risk in
volved in actually attempting
to reach it. Combing the
mountain with newly sensi
tized hands, feeling for hidden
cracks, ledges, ruts and holes.
Then the question: will it hold
me?
Moments of panic arose
quickly with sharp intensity.
There's no place to go! What if
I can't hold on long enough to

find a new route?
Then the fear would gradu
ally pass as I calmed myself, ra
tionally assessing the alter
natives, relying on the pres
ence of the belay rope for con
fidence.
Hugging the mountain like a
bear on a tree, the sense of vis
ual and aural clarity was
heightened by the regular flow
of adrenaline; yet there was no
time to listen to the bitds or
gaze out upon the panoramic
view: the safety of reaching the
top was still up there!
As I continued up the last
quarter of the climb, I knew I
would make it. The final mo
ments of the climb were
capricious, fun-filled ones.
When I reached the top, I
was suddenly overcome with
the greatest sense of en
thusiasm and accomplishment,
despite the fact that my mouth
was dry and my muscles were
aching.
Looking down upon the
mountain I had climbed, star
ing out at the forested valley
beyond, I couldn't help but
feel like I was standing on top
of the world.

the instinct to hang on for dear
life, an important sense of se
curity developed in each of us
as a result of being successfully
caught.
And it's important to under
stand that any sense of security
developed in a new rock

climber is critical.
As Larson put it,"In rock
climb'ng there are a lot of
things that are coun
terintuitive. . .that just don't
seem natural. You have to learn
to overcome that fear of fa 11 -
ing."

About 40 teet off the ground
I realized that in my initial burst
of exhilaration I was climbing
too fast.
"It's not a race," I warned
myself; yet finding ways to re
lax at that altitude was not easy.
Soon I began to accept the
reality that rockclimbing is an
inch-by-inch endeavor, It be
came a process of exploration
and selection: searching out
the next foothold or handhold,
then evaluating the risk in
volved in actually attempting
to reach it. Combing the
mountain with newly sensi
tized hands, feeling for hidden
cracks, ledges, ruts and holes.
Then the question: will it hold
me?
Moments of panic arose
quickly with sharp intensity.
There's no place to go! What if
I can't hold on long enough to

find a new route?
Then the fear would gradu
ally pass as I calmed myself, ra
tionally assessing the alter
natives, relying on the pres
ence of the belay rope for con
fidence.
Hugging the mountain like a
bear on a tree, the sense of vis
ual and aural clarity was
heightened by the regular flow
of adrenaline; yet there was no
time to listen to the bitds or
gaze out upon the panoramic
view: the safety of reaching the
top was still up there!
As I continued up the last
quarter of the climb, I knew I
would make it. The final mo
ments of the climb were
capricious, fun-filled ones.
When I reached the top, I
was suddenly overcome with
the greatest sense of en
thusiasm and accomplishment,
despite the fact that my mouth
was dry and my muscles were
aching.
Looking down upon the
mountain I had climbed, star
ing out at the forested valley
beyond, I couldn't help but
feel like I was standing on top
of the world.

"On belay?" I shouted at the
rock wall that rose from the
trail where I stood in the mid
day sun.
"Belay on!" cried a distant
voice above me.
"Climbing!" I called out,
starting towards the face of the
outcropping.
"Climb on!" said the rock
voice, clearing me to begin my
ascent.
I reached out to the grey
white barrier that stretched
from my feet to the top, some
100 feet above. For the first
time, I seriously questioned
what I was about to do.
"As an athlete," I silently told
myself, "I have challenged my
body to respond to difficult
and sometimes even danger
ous actions plenty of times
before. Past performances
have demonstrated my physi
cal capabilities time and time

again: regardless of my initial
fears, I have generally suc
ceeded in the face of adversity
and I will succeed again this in
stance."
Encouraged by this line of
reasoning, I took hold of a
prominent rock before me and
began to climb.
"But," my self responded,
"was the danger ever so im
mediate, those times you faced
it in the past? Did it increase
proportionately as you con
tinued, as safety moved farther
and farther below until even
tually returning as you ap
proached the top, the end of
the challenge? And did those
previous challenges demand
the same degree of steady
meditation upon the danger,
filling each moment with im
mediacy, yet somehow, life."
"Chuck the philosophy and
get on with it,"a voice said
within me.

Greg Larson stood on the
summit of Goat Rock and de
scribed rockclimbing and the
Alpine Club to a group of six
neophyte climbers, sitting
around him on the mid-morn
ing of their first climb.

Acting as club coordinator,
Larson told us that the Alpine
C.luh is one of the oldest clubs
on campus, with activities dat
ing back nearly 50 years. Or
ganized in order to bring to
gether members of the Stan
ford community who ap
preciate natural playgrounds
such as Goat Rock, the club is
experiencing a great deal of
popularity this year.
The group attracts a special
breed of people who believe in
enjoying themselves outside,
doing things that many non
members don't quite under
stand.
Like climbing on rocks.
"I think a lot of it is the de
lirium of being down safely,"
said junior Steve D'Hondt
when asked to describe his en
joyment of rockclimbing.
D'Hondt is the director of
Stanford Tresidder Outdoor
Programs (STOPS), which of
fers financial and organiza

tional support to campus out
door groups such as the Alpine
Club and the Outing Club.
However, In? and Larson, who
is assistant director of Tresidder
Union, are out climbing rocks
on Saturday afternoons as a
matter of choice rather than
duty.
As instructors, Larson and
D'Hondt led the attentive
group through several basic
knot-tying lessons, followed by
20 frustrating minutes of trying
to successfully tie one's climb
ing harness to one's self. My
personal conclusion was that
tying a water knot, the knot re
quired to complete the har
ness, was not easy as it looked.
Once strapped into the har
nesses, the group next became
familiar with the safety features
used by rockclimbers.
Each climber takes a turn at
tying the belay rope to his har
ness and making a practice as
cent up an easy ledgp, rising

perhaps 10 feet from the
ground. On the top side of the
ledge another member fastens
his harness to a secure rock so
that he cannot be pulled down
by the weight of the climber
below.
As the person below makes
his way up the side of the
ledge, the person above
"belays" the climber, steadily
reeling in the rope around his
body with both hands so that
the climber cannot fall if a slip
occurs.
As the climbers approached
the top, each was directed to
let go of the rock in order to
simulate a fall. Although it was
difficult to intentionally violate
the instinct to hang on for dear
life, an important sense of se
curity developed in each of us
as a result of being successfully
caught.
