# Student conduct committee reviews group conduct code
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Prompted by the University's han
dling of the Zeta Psi fraternity sus
pension, the Student Conduct Legis
lative Council (SCLC) met yesterday
for the first time in three years to dis
cuss University policies for dealing
with student groups.
The meeting was requested by
members of the ASSU and other stu
dent groups, who were concerned
over the lack and/or incomplete na
ture of such policies.
The five students and six faculty
members of the SCLC decided yes
terday that the question of group
rights warranted further investiga
tion, but they could not yet say if writ
ten policies would actually be de
veloped. They will examine the prob
lem from a "broad perspective,"
keeping in mind that any action they
might take will set guidelines for the
University in dealing with individuals
and groups.
Christopher Greene, an ex-officio
member of the SCLC and a member
of the ASSU Council of Presidents,
expressed concern that the SCLC
should not focus on the Zeta Psi
fraternity case, except as an example
of where group rights may be in con
flict with individual rights. Other
members of the Council appeared to
be in agreement with him.
Greene said he believed the proc
ess for addressing individual conduct
violations was fair, but that "there are

no specific rules" for adressing mat
ters which pertain to groups. Greene
added that he hoped the SCLC could
probe the matter of group rights, in
an "academic" context.
"There are no rights specifically
granted to groups, although groups
can be charged," said Roc Blumen
thal, deputy senate chair and an ex
officio member of the committee.
The SCLC has jurisdiction over
University legislation which deals
with disciplinary sanctions against in
dividual students or organized
groups of students. "Legislation pro
mulgated by the SCLC shall prevail
over inconsistent reguations de
veloped by other groups or individ
uals in the University," the SCLC
charter reads.
Greene and others noted that any
guidelines developed by the SCLC
would not be retroactive, and thus
would not specifically affect the de
cision to suspend the Zetes.
Michael Wald,a law professor here
and the Council's chair, began the
meeting by outlining the courses of
action open to the Council. He said
that after investigating the matter the
Council might determine one of the
following: that existing policies are
sufficient; that existing policies are
insufficent, but that new rules should
not be drafted; that existing policies
are insufficent and new rules should
be drafted.
Wald said he was unable to com
ment on what course of action the
SCLC would take until after the

members had reviewed the existing
policies and reconvened in three
weeks.
Student organizations are grouped
in four categories: voluntary or
ganizations, religious groups, resi
dentially related and selective
groups, and residentialy related but
