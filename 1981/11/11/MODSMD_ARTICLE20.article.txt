Power unit breakdown
Shown in the diagram is the auxiliary power unit (APU) subsystem in the space shut
tle which caused the delay in last week's scrubbed launch of the Columbia. Filters in
the auxiliary power units had to be removed and cleaned, along with cleaning the
entire system. These APUa are located in the rear of the craft.
