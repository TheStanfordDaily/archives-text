# Economist takes a gloomy look back

New York (AP) — Supply
siders are discovering the dan
ger of having promised so
much, and in order to defend
themselves they may have to
remind Americans just how
bad a mess it was that they in
herited.
The patient, they are learn
ing, may be unable to tolerate a
sudden, huge dose of their life
saving medicine, a
phenomenon that seems to be
as true in economics as some
times it is in the world of medi
cine.
Even the most optimistic de
fenders of the new economics
now concede that the job of
resurrecting the economy on a
new, stronger foundation may
take longer than was antici
pated a few months ago.
Therefore, the need to de
fend themselves with a review
of how bad things were, an en
deavor in which they could use
the perception of John Wright,
an investor, investment adviser
and portfolio manager of many
hundreds of millions of dollars
for Wright Investors' Service.
Wright recently spoke at the
fifth anual symposium on
American capitalism at Fair
field University, Fairfield,
Conn., observing that almost
all major economic develop
ments of recent years have
been been "unfortunately, ov

erhwelmingly negative."
To begin with, he said, na
tional production has shrunk
to 79 percent of capacity and is
still declining, versus a
1950-1969 average of 84 per
cent.
"Competitive free-en
terprise innovation and price
cutting of small and medium
businesses is being crushed un
der the weight of unsup
portable debt service and
swept up to feed the 'growth'
of corporate giants — domestic
and foreign," said Wright.
National productivity, or real
output per hour of all workers,
which improved at an average
of 3 percent a year from the
1950s to the 19605, slowed to a
2.2 percent rate during the past
decade, and has declined over
the latest three years, Wright
observed.
Unemployment, meanwhile,
has grown to about 8 percent,
"with a near-term prospect of
one out of every 10 able-bod
ied and willing workers unable
to find productive em
ployment," he said.
The same negative story, said
Wright, pertains to inflation.
The latest figures show it de
clining from its double-digit
rates "as a result of interim sta
bilization of imported oil
prices."
