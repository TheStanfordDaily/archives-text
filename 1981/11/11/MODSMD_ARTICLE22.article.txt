Washington — These may be days of aus
terity for cities, symphonies and schoolkids,
but the pinch hasn't come yet for veterans
who look to Washington fora helping hand.
Without any ceremony, President Ronald
Reagan put aside his deficit-fighting efforts a
few weeks ago to sign a bill that added nearly
$1 billion to federal outlays. He issued a brief
statement of satisfaction and congratulations,
then went back to work. The event caused
barely a ripple.
That's because the extra spending involved
veterans and, even in austerity, money for
veterans is pretty much inviolable. Abraham
Lincoln laid down the premise that still gov
erns. He said the government had an obliga
tion "to care for him who shall have borne
the battle, and for his widow and hisorphan."
As a result, while asking other agencies to
take a new cut of 12 percent in their budgets,
Reagan proposed and signed an 11.2 percent
increase in disability payments for 2.3 million
service-disabled veterans and their survivors.
Even though Reagan did suggest modest
reductions in some areas, the overall budget
of the Veterans Administration keeps grow
ing. It has doubled since 1972 and now totals
more than $23 billion.
A day of recalculation may be coming;
costs are soaring as an aging population of
veterans makes more demands. The 12.4 mil
lion veterans of World War II now average 61
years of age. In fouryearsmostwill be eligible
for free VA medical care — a demand that
could force reconsideration of what is of
fered veterans.
In the meantime, the VA sees its consti
tuency as a growing one: 30 million veterans,

59 million family members of living veterans,
nearly 4 million survivors of deceased veter
ans. The VA calculates that 41 percent of the
people in America are "potential recipients
of veterans benefits provided by the federal
government."
The American Legion which, along with
other veterans groups, lobbies mightily to
maintain and increase these programs, fore
sees a potential tightening up.
Said Robert Lynch, the Legion's director of
rehabilitation: "The main problem in these
days of fiscal austerity is the provision of ade
quate funding to keep all veterans programs
functioning in the manner intended by Con
gress. The American Legion believes that in
the nation's priorities, veterans, representing
the men and women who have defended the
nation in time of war and active hostilities,
should rank second only to national de
fense."
The VA's reach is enormous. On an average
day, there are about 67,000 patients in the
VA's 172 hospitals, which make it the nation's
biggest health delivery system.
All told, the VA employs more than 200,000
people to dispense its services and payments.
What the government offers them is
enough to fill a book, and in fact does: "Fed
eral Benefits for Veterans and Dependents,"
spelling out the fine-print details, is a 78-page
pamphlet available for $2.50 from the Super
intendent of Documents, Government Print
ing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
The book details the programs available to
veterans who qualify — medical care, disabili
ty compensation, pensions, home loans,
educational benefits, counseling, insurance
among others.
