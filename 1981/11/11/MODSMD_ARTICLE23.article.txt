# Californians wanting more tax cuts
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
los Angeles— Although Californians are
convinced there is post-Proposition 13 fat
in state and local governments, they are fa
talistic about the chances of the Legislature
doing anything about it and appear re
signed to future tax increases, the Los An
geles Times poll has found.
Nevertheless, they remain overwhelm
ingly supportive of Proposition 13, which
sharply reduced local property taxes, and
feel little affected by it. Indeed, they want
even deeper budget cuts — particularly in
government employee wages — if state
and local governments have problems
making ends meet next year.
On the other hand, they do not want
cuts in such things as schools, garbage col
lection, public transportation, highways,
parks, libraries and hospitals.
But if tax increases become inevitable to
sustain those services, they want the
burden to fall heaviest on business proper
ty and on consumers of beer, liquor and
cigarettes.
Generally, according to the poll's find
ings, such an outlook cuts across party and
philosophical lines and is shared by Re
publicans, Democrats and independents.
The Legislature convened Monday in
Sacramento in a special session called by
Gov. Jerry Brown to deal with the state's
deepening financial crisis in the aftermath
of a faltering state economy that sent rev
enues spiraling below forecasts by more
than $300 million in the last three months.
State and local governments also stand
to lose almost a billion dollars in 1982 be
cause of federal spending cuts. And the

statesurplus used to bail out local govern
ments after Proposition 13 passed in 1978
has been exhausted.
But a substantial number of people (57
percent) doubt that legislators "are mak
ing an honest effort to carry out the will of
the people" and many of the number are
convinced that higher taxes will be the
"final, lasting result" of Proposition 13.
Only one in five of those polled thought
government would respond to fiscal prob
lems by "cutting out waste and inefficien
cy."
In large part, most people remain un
convinced that the government fiscal cup
board is bare and, predictably, oppose any
form of tax increase, especially instate in
come taxes or local taxes.
There is virtually no sentiment for in
crease in the gasoline tax or increases des
ignated for single purposes, such as high
way construction or schools. Neither is
there support for increases in student fees
at state universities and colleges nor for an
increase in the state income tax.
The Times poll, directed by I.A. Lewis,
surveyed 1473 California adults — includ
ing 518 registered Democrats and 452 reg
istered Republicans — by telephone be
tween Nov. 1 and 5. Such a survey general
ly is considered to have a 4 percent margin
of error.
By an overwhelmingly majority (70 per
cent), those who were polled said there is
"still a lot of fat" in government at both the
state and local levels and believe further
cuts are possible, and 66 percent said their
impression of Proposition 13 remains as fa
vorable today as it did 3V'2 years ago when

it won massive voter approval.
A major reason appears to be that most
people have not felt any pinch from Prop
osition 13 cutbacks, despite warning from
government officials that its passage would
result in drastically curtailed services.
In general, the public is in a gloomy
mood both about the current state of the
economy and about the future.
Only 19 percent said in response to
questions concerning their current finan
cial situation that they are better off than

they were "about the sanie" or worse off.
Only 1 percent said they were unsure.
By the same token, 57 percent said they
expected to be about the same or worse

los Angeles— Although Californians are
convinced there is post-Proposition 13 fat
in state and local governments, they are fa
talistic about the chances of the Legislature
doing anything about it and appear re
signed to future tax increases, the Los An
geles Times poll has found.
Nevertheless, they remain overwhelm
ingly supportive of Proposition 13, which
sharply reduced local property taxes, and
feel little affected by it. Indeed, they want
even deeper budget cuts — particularly in
government employee wages — if state
and local governments have problems
making ends meet next year.
On the other hand, they do not want
cuts in such things as schools, garbage col
lection, public transportation, highways,
parks, libraries and hospitals.
But if tax increases become inevitable to
sustain those services, they want the
burden to fall heaviest on business proper
ty and on consumers of beer, liquor and
cigarettes.
Generally, according to the poll's find
ings, such an outlook cuts across party and
philosophical lines and is shared by Re
publicans, Democrats and independents.
The Legislature convened Monday in
Sacramento in a special session called by
Gov. Jerry Brown to deal with the state's
deepening financial crisis in the aftermath
of a faltering state economy that sent rev
enues spiraling below forecasts by more
than $300 million in the last three months.
State and local governments also stand
to lose almost a billion dollars in 1982 be
cause of federal spending cuts. And the

statesurplus used to bail out local govern
ments after Proposition 13 passed in 1978
has been exhausted.
