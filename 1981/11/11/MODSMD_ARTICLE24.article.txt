# China copier deal?
## 
### 
Chicago — Otto Clark says
he and his 14 hired hands took
on Xerox and the rest of the
world's industrial giants and
captured the China market for
small copying machines.
A deal to be signed with the
People's Republic of China this
week, Clark said, will net at
least $60 million in profits for
his small suburban firm, Clark
Copy International Corp.,
which most of the industry had
never heard of before.
"This all sounds very strange
to me," said one market ana
lyst, Eugene Glazer of Dean
Witter Reynolds, who like oth
ers wondered how Clark nego
tiated the deal when com
panies like Xerox Corp. have
been unable to cut into the
Chinese market.
However, Clark, whose firm
last year made $58,000 on sales
of $1.5 million, says it's simple.
He said in a telephone in
terview Monday that the words
"Made In Japan" don't sell too
well in China, and the small
copy machines of the interna
tional giants, including Xerox
and International Business Ma
chines Corp., are made wholly
or partly in Japan.
A U.S. Commerce Depart
ment official said he has seen

no confirmation of the deal,
but that Clark is to bring the
contract to the government of
fice this week as a first step in
the export licensing pro
cedure.
"I don't think he's made it
up," said Al Davis, a senior in
ternational tradespecialist with
the Commerce Department.
Clark's CMC 2000 copier —
named after his daughter,
Catherine Marie Clark — will
be American made, in sub
urban Morton Grove.
Clark, a Czech immigrant
who says hecame tothe United
States because of "opportuni
ty," said he undercut Xerox
and IBM on size and price. The
Chinese wanted a small, inex
pensive copier to use in their
government offices, he said.
His copier, which weighs 68
pounds, will sell for $1995, with
a discount on the first to go to
China.
Under the terms of the China
deal, Clark's firm will make
6000 copiers for $5.5 million.
Then the Chinese will make an
other 200,000 of the machines
in the next three years, with
Clark and the Chinese splitting
the profits. Clark said his com
pany stands to make a profit of
between $300 and $400 on each
machine in that deal.
