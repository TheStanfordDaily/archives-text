Inflation still under control
Washington — Inflation at the wholesale level bumped
upward at a moderate 6.8 percent annual rate in October,
with auto prices speeding ahead but food and energy prices
falling, the government reported yesterday.
October's 0.6 percent increase in the Producer Price Index
(PPI) for finished goods was the biggest since April's 0.8 per
cent. But it was still far short of the big monthly increases
common in the middle of last year and in the first three
months of 1981.
Economists saw the new report as more good news on in
flation in general. Private analyst Donald Ratajczak summed
it up with the comment, "the numbers are all good except
for the autos."
Analysts are confidently predicting inflation at the whole
sale level will be well below 10 percent for 1981 as a whole,
down substantially from last year's 11.8 percent.
In fact, Ratajczak, who keeps close watch on the PPI as di
rector of Georgia State University's Economic Forecasting
Project, said wholesale inflation for the year probably will be
in the 7.5 percent range, down more than one-third from last
year.
He said 1982 also "should be a fairly decent inflation year,"
with overall price increases no worse than this year.
Jack Carlson, chief economist for the National Realtors As
sociation, called yesterday's report "further evidence that
the underlying inflation rate is subsiding."
"This is good news for the badly depressed real estate in
dustry," he said, noting that lesser price increases "are hav
ing a beneficial effect on interest rates" which have hurt con
struction and sales.
Budget problems frustrate Stockman
Washington — Budget director David Stockman admitted
last April that the Reagan economic program was not work
ing out as intended, and by last summer was dejected be
cause prospects for balancing the budget had all but disap
peared, according to an article published in The Atlantic
Monthly.
According to the article, based on periodic interviews with
Stockman over the past year, the budget director acknowl
edged that "supply-side" economics was just a new name for
"trickle-down" policies that favored the well-to-do. "Naive
supply siders" did not realize how hard it would be to fulfill
the president's economic program, he said.
Stockman told the author of the article, William Greider,
an assistant managing editor of The Washington Post, that
the administration's initial economic projections were large
ly guesswork. "None of us really understands what s going
on with all these numbers," Stockman said.
Capitol Hill Democrats immediately seized on the Atlantic
article yesterday. Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) an early, informal
entrant in the 1984 presidential sweepstakes, said that Stock
man's role in events of the last year, as depicted in the article,
represented "one of the most cynical pieces of performance
by a public official perhaps since the Vietnam era."
Court rules on GOP, benefits
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday upheld the
legality of a technique devised by the Republican National
Senatorial Campaign Committee to get around the fact that
it can't legally spend money on its own for Senate campaigns.
The court ruled unanimously that such a national commit
tee can spend on behalf of state parties — which designate
the national committee as the state parties' surrogates. This
enables a well-endowed national campaign committee to
rescue an underfinanced Senate campaign.
In 1980, the Republican senatorial committee gave $2.7
million to various Senate races after it got a favorable ruling
by the Federal Election Commission. This surrogate arrange
ment, known as an "agency agreement" between the na
tional senatorial campaign committee and the state parties,
was challenged by the Democrats and was ruled illegal by the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
The opinion reversing the appeals court was written by
Justice Byron White. He said the appeals court should have
deferred to the FEC's conclusion, which he said was correct

in stating that nothing in the law prevented agency agree
ments.
In another ruling yesterday, called "uniquely unjust" by
dissenters, the court said federal law's supremacy over state
law requires it to strip the children of a deceased serviceman
of their father's insurance benefits.
In a 5-to-3 decision (Justice Sandra O'Connor did not par
ticipate), the court overturned a Maine Supreme Court de
cision and ruled that the second wife of Army Sgt. Richard
Ridgeway of Maine was entitled to the money because that
was the way he wanted it.
West Bank strikes continue
Jerusalem — Commercial strikes and anti-Israel demon
strations inEast Jerusalem and the Occupied West Bank yes
terday marked the second week of disturbances over the
forced closing of Bir Zeit University, the largest Arab univer
sity in the West Bank, as security forces rounded up sus
pected organizers of protests.
Israeli army troops and border policemen maintained an
unusually heavy presence in all the principal towns in the
West Bank, but some schools joined the strike and students
demonstrated in the streets anyway, some of them stoning
passing Israeli vehicles. A bus driver and woman passenger
were injured slightly when a rock crashed through the win
dow of a bus in Atarot, near Jerusalem.
In East Jerusalem, virtually every shop was closed, and a
demonstration by schoolgirls in Saladin Street, the main
thoroughfare was dispersed by border police. Two Arab
youths were arrested for flying a Palestinian flag, and in sev
eral West Bank towns tires were burned, a common Palesti
nian form of protest.
There was a partial strike in Ramallah, near Bir Zeit, but
most shops opened after the army parked a mobile welding
unit in the town square. The welding devices are usually used
to seal shut the steel doors of Arab merchants who partici
pate in strikes, preventing them from reopening.
Mondale criticizes budget cuts
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale
said yesterday that it is urgent foi President Ronald Reagan to
"admit the mistake" and ask Congress to undo some of the
"unwise tax cuts" it voted last summer.
In a speech at Columbia University business school pre
pared and delivered before Reagan reaffirmed his present
policies at a press conference, Mondale said that eliminating
"expensive and egregious (tax) loopholes" and postponing
"a portion of the later installments of the personal tax cut"
would reduce deficits and allow the Federal Reserve Board
to ease monetary policy and bring down interest rates.
In a briefing Monday afternoon, the prospective 1984
Democratic presidential contender said "I see no hope of a
sustainable recovery (from the current recession) unless we
take the pressure off the Fed" for tight-money policies. "To
wait much longer before reversing course would be to take
extreme risks."
Discounting administration claims that the Reagan eco
nomic plan has not been in place long enough to be judged
fairly, Mondale said "it is a radical policy, and it has failed."
Egypt still cagey on peace plan
Cairo — On the eve of resuming Palestinian autonomy ne
gotiations with Israel here today Egypt took pains to put dis
tance between itself and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Fahd's
controversial eight-point peace plan.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's view of the Fahd plan,
which Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin has dismissed
as a formula for the destruction of Israel, was spelled out in
detail for the first time by his chief foreign policy adviser,
Foreign Affairs First Undersecretary Osama Baz.
In an interview with The Los Angeles Times and two other
U.S. newspapers, Baz dismissed the Saudi crown prince's
eight points as neither a peace plan nor an initiative, but as
only an idea that has no chance of advancing the Middle East
peace process at this time.
"President Mubarak believes the only viable formula for
solving the Middle East problem remains the Camp David ac

cords," Baz emphasized. "This is the only formula accepted
by Israel and as such (it) has a chance of being implemented.
The Saudi formula is confined to a restatement of some gen
eral principles laid down in (U.N. Security Council Resolu
tion) 242 and several (U.N.) General Assembly resolutions. It
is not a comprehensive plan."
U.S. won't abandon FAO
Rome — The United States reaffirmed its support yester
day for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
and said it would not walk out of the organization in the like
ly event that American appeals for budget austerity are ig
nored.
Richard Lyng, deputy secretary of agriculture, brought the
message to the biennial conference of the FAO, speaking for
Secretary of Agriculture John Block. The secretary was de
tained in Washington by the prolonged negotiations in Con
gress over the farm bill.
"At this point, we have no intention of withdrawing, and I
do not want to leave any implication of that," Lyng told re
porters. "In no way do I want to imply a threat that we might
withdraw."
His statements in the FAO session and in a press con
ference stilled speculation that the new U.S. administration
might cut back or terminate support for the FAO.
Lyng acknowledged differences with the newly re-elected
FAO director general, Edouard Saouma, on the organiza
tion's budget but said the American delegation had voted for
Saouma's reelection Monday.
Second shot for Shuttle tomorrow
Cape Canaveral — With their second-chance countdown
moving easily toward tomorrow's launch target, astronauts
Joe Engle and Richard Truly arrived on site yesterday and
said, firmly and hopefully, "this is the real thing."
Countdown began at 8 o'clock yesterday morning and on
launch pad 39A, work was going so well that spokesman
Hugh Harris said: "They're making it look easy." Crews pow
ered up Columbia's electrical system fuel cells and prepared
to roll back the main servicing structure.
The undercurrent to the rosy progress and optimistic fore
cast was the knowledge that everything was glass-smooth,
too, until the final minutes of last Wednesday's countdown.
Engle said he was "thoroughly convinced that we were just
about ready to lift off" when the countdown clock stopped
cold at 31 seconds befo.e ignition. No one was more sur
prised "than Richard and I when we heard we had to call a
scrub," he said.
Technicians found dirty oil and clogged filters in two of
Columbia's hydraulic units and made weekend repairs to
ready tomorrow's second try.
Reagan speech sours market
The stock market relinquished a broad advance yesterday
and closed mixed in heavy trading as President Ronald Rea
gan predicted economic "hard times" in the next few
months.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen
nearly 5 points earlier in the session, fell 1.23 to 853.98, but
the Dow Jones transportation and utilities measures edged
higher.
Gainers held an 8 to 7 lead over losers on the New York
Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaling 53.94 million shares compared
with 48.31 million Monday. Nationwide turnover in NYSE
listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional ex
changes and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 62.82
million shares.
