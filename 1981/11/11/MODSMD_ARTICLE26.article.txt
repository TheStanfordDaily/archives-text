# Qualify for Nationals, first time ever
## Cross countriers race to No.2 in Region-8's 
### Dick Hodge 
Despite ailments, a depleted roster and a controversial
eligibility ruling, the Stanford women's cross country
team struggled to a second place finish in the NCAA Re
gion-8 Championships Monday at the Stai. ord Golf
Course.
That finish qualified the team fora trip to the NCAA
National Championships Nov. 23 at Wichita St.in
Wichita, Ka. and marks the first time a Stanford women's
squad has had the chance to go to the Nationals.
Freshman sensation Cici Hopp was one of four runners
to break her old course record as she crossed the finish
line at 16:34.1 in third place to lead Card finishers. Junior
Kim Schnurpfeil, who had the flu just two days before
the race, finished ninth in 17:01.5 over the 5000 meters;
sophomore Patti Sue Plumer followed closely in 10th
with a 17:02.7; frosh Ann Locke placed 17th in 17:25.1
and freshman Michelle Mason took 34th with 18:15.1.
The finished behind the University of Oregon in a sec
ond place tie with San Diego State University. All three
iearns will advance to Nationals.
A rash of untimely misfortunes almost cost Stanford,
ranked N0.2 nationally, its chance at the NCAA's.
■ Sloan Burton, the Cards' N0.3 runner, has a leg injury
and did not run. Coach Brooks Johnson had planned to
run Ellen Lyons, a star runner last year who has not com
peted this season due to a slowly healing injury, in
Burton's place. Lyons has practiced with the team and
was fit to run Monday.
Under NCAA rules, which state that a participant in
post-season competition need only have practiced with
the team during the season, she was eligible. But John
son was informed by Athletic Director Andy Geiger
Monday morning that Stanford had to abide by AIAW

rules, despite the meet being an NCAA — not AIAW —
sponsored event.
The AIAW rule states that an athlete must have com
peted in the majority of contests during the season to be
eligible for post-season play and consequently, Stanford
ran one woman short.
"The rule interpretation was a kind of Catch-22 thing,"
Johnson said. "We were lucky to advance to Nationals. If
the meet were held Saturday (when Schnurpfeil had the
flu) we wouldn't even have entered. It would have been
a nice season, but it would be over now,"
The individual winner of the meet was Monica Joyce
of San Diego State, who set a blazing course record of
16:28.9. She was followed by Joan Hanson of the Univer
sity of Arizona in second at 16:31 and directly in front of
Hopp.
Although Monday's race marks the first time this year
Hopp has been defeated by someone other than a team
mate, she was pleased with her performance.
"I ran the first mile faster than usual, but I still felt
strong at the end," she said. "I probably could have
caught the leaders if I had kicked a little earlier. But our
real goal was to make Nationals as a team."
Johnson's strategy depended on Hopp — known as
"The Kid" — holding back early so that the Cards could
run as a pack, spurring on the slower runners.
"Our goal today was to beat teams — Oregon, San Di
ego State, Arizona — not their top runners, and that's
what happened," explained Johnson. "People say that
cross country isn't a team sport. Well, we race as a team.
When one of the team hurts, all of them hurt.
"If we hadn't qualified as a team, I wouldn't have sent
individuals who did,"he added.
