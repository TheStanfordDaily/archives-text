# Football rankings: Pitt No. 1 Hawaii on poll for first time
## 
### Associated Press 
A measure of stability has settled at
the top of the college football rank
ings, at least for now, but something
new took place down near the tail
end of the poll.
Pitt, Clernson, Southern California
and Georgia held onto the top four
spots in the Associated Press college
football poll Monday and the Uni
versity of Hawaii, in its sixth year in
Division I, made the major rollege
rankings for the first time.
"We're very pleased about it," said
Dick Toney, coach of the 7-0 Rain
bows. "It's real recognition fora lot
of people who have worked very
hard, the coaches, the players, mem
bers of their families. We're real
grateful."
Pitt, one of four unbeaten-untied
teams among the 137 in Division I, re
ceived 53 of 68 first-place votes and
1343 of a possible 1360 points from a
nationwide panel of sports writers
and sportscasters. The Panthers, the
latest of six teams to occupy the No.l
position this season, boosted their
record to 8-0 by trouncing Rutgers
47-3.
Clemson also remained unbeaten
— the Tigers are 9-0 for the first time
in 33 years — by edging North Caroli
na 10-8, a setback that dropped the
Tar Heels from eighth place to 13th.
Clemson received seven first-place
votes and 1272 points.
Southern Cal, which defeated Cali

fornia 21-3, received the other eight
first-place ballots and 1232 points.
Last week, Pitt led Clemson and USC
in first-place votes 49-9-7 and 1283-1,
201-1,178 in points with 65 of the 68
voters participating.
Georgia's defending national
champions defeated Florida 26-21
and received 1129 points to remain in
fourth place. However, Texas was
held to a 14-14 tie by Houston and
slipped from fifth to lOth.
That cleared the way for Penn State
and Alabama, which meet this Satur
day in State College, Pa., to move up
one position each to fifth and sixth
place, respectively. Penn State de
feated North Carolina State 22-15 and
received 1043 points, while Alabama
had a week off. The Crimson Tide to
taled 935 points.
Nebraska jumped from 11th tosev
enth with 793 points following a 54-7
rout of Oklahoma State and South
ern Methodist, a 33-12 winner over
Rice, climbed from 10th to eighth
with 791 points.
Arizona State defeated San Jose
State 31-24 and remained in ninth
place with 783 points, followed by
Texas with 754.
The Second Ten consists of Michi
gan, Miami of Florida, North Caroli
na, Southern Mississippi, Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Washington State, UCLA,
Hawaii and Florida State.
Toney, obviously, was pleased with
the recognition but admitted it won't

do his team much good next week
when Hawaii hosts Brigham Young.
"We'll just have to play hard," he
said. "This weekend's game is very
important to us, whether we were
ranked or not. I don't think being
ranked will add to the pressure that
was already there.
"We've never been close to beat
ing these guys. We've played them
three times. They're a tough team
with a pjrcat quarterback t)< rr >
