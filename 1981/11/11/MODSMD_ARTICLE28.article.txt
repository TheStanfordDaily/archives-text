# Dodgers' Lasorda named Manager of the Year

### 
New York (AP) — Tommy Lasorda, the good-hu
mor man who managed the Cinderella Los Angel
es Dodgers to their first world championship in 16
years, was named National League Manager of the
Year by The Associated Press yesterday.
Lasorda, the spirited leader of the huggingest
team in baseball, was an easy winner in nationwide
balloting by sports writers and broadcasters who
watched him rally the Dodgers from the edge of
elimination three times during postseason play.
He received 215 votes, outdistancing Whitey
Herzog of the St.Louis Cardinals, who finished sec
ond with 163 votes.
A consummate company man who continuously
sings the praises of "Dodger Blue," Lasorda has
been part of the organization as player, scout,
coach and manager for 32 years.
He faced his most difficult challenge in 1981 with
an aging team that some baseball people thought
had passed its peak. But he cajoled the Dodgers to

their first world championship since 1965, and he
did it in two languages.
Lasorda started the season boldly, turning over
the Opening Day pitching assignment to a rookie
left-hander who couldn't speak English. But the
manager had picked up enough Spanish in his
vagabond baseball career to communicate with
Fernando Valenzuela and he nursed the young
Mexican southpaw through a brilliant start.
The Dodgers, sparked by Valenzuela, led the Na
tional League West when a strike halted baseball
for seven weeks in mid-summer. When play re
sumed and the split season concept was adopted,
Los Angeles was one of four teams assured of a
postseason playoff spot.
The plan appeared to rob the Dodgers of incen
tive in the second half and they were flat when
they opened the divisional playoffs with two con
secutive losses in Houston. Then, only one loss
from elimination, the team came home and won

three straight games to wipe out the Astros.
That moved the Dodgers into the NL Cham
pionship Series against East champion Montreal.
When the Expos won two of the first three games,
the Dodgers were on the brink of extinction again.
But again, Lasorda rallied his team to two straight
victories, this time on the road, sending Los Angel
es into the World Series.
It seemed unlikely that the Dodgers could
bounce back a third time, but they did. After losing
the first two games in New York, Los Angeles won
three straight at home, then finished off the Yan
kees in Game Six at New York.
The world championship came in the Dodgers'
third World Series since Lasorda took over as man
ager Sept. 29,1976, replacing the esteemed Walter
Alston, who had guided the club for 23 years in
Brooklyn and Los Angeles. Alston, named AP Man
ager of the Year in 1955,1959,1965,1966 and 1974,
is the only man to win the honor five times.
