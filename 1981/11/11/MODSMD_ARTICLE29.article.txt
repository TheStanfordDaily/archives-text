## What is it about college football? The Big Games 
### 
When you have devoted what
seems to be the better part of your
last 11 autumns to this wonderful
beast known as college football;
when you find your sleep inter
rupted by visions of Keith Jackson
going over the top and Frank
Broyles mumbling something to
the effect of, "Those ELLessYOU
BaYOU Bengals are somethin'
else!"; when you know it's No
vember because you have willing
ly traded in your ROSE BOWL BE
LIEVER button fora OUST FAUST
bumper sticker; when you can ac
tually remember the days when
Chuck Fairbanks could coach and
Pat Haden was not a Rhodes
scholar and was an effective quar
terback — when you have
reached this pitiful point, as I cer
tainly have, there comes a time
when you must explain yourself to
the more sensible among us.
And that time is now.
What is it about college foot
ball? Why all the fuss? Is it the
Bowl games? Is it the Bear? The
wishbone? The USC tailbacks?
The rivalries? The upsets? 1 he
cheerleaders? The Fireman's Fund
Flashbacks? The latest NCAA re
cruiting "violations?" What is it?
For me (and I suppose for the
rest of Americans as well), the Big
Games are it. And not Stanford-
Cal, mind you. The really Big
Games. The kind of games that
you long for days, and even

weeks, in advance. The kind of
games thJt convert you into your
own personal marching band. The
kind of games that play every bit as
well on the field as they do in the
papers.
During the '70s, I ran across
three especially great games —
the identities of which I will keep
secret fora moment. These may
not be the absolutely, positively
best games of the past decade, but
to me they remain something
quite special. Their combined
nine hours represent the very best
of sport — the promise that is
fulfilled.
And so for the fun of it, here is a
look back . . .

Thanksgiving Day, 1971: NE
BRASKA 35 OKLAHOMA 31
Site: Owen Stadium in Norman,
Oklahoma before a crowd of
63,385.
"OH MAN, WOMAN, AND
CHILD!", bellowed Lyle Bremser,
the sainted Voice of the Corn
huskers. "I never thought I would
live this long to see this kind of
football game!" Amen. The
"Game of the Decade" was in
deed perfection in pigskin. Ne
braska (10-0, ranked No. 1) versus
Oklahoma (9-0, No. 2). The Corn
huskers' murderous defense

pitted against the Sooners' wither
ing Whooshbone T offense.
Though Nebraska was slightly
favored, the Sooners came into
the contest having played — and
waylayed — tougher opponents.
In one memorable three-game
stretch in October, Oklahoma —
fired by Greg Pruitt's 50 rushes for
611 yards, an astounding 12.2 yard
average per carry — had clob
bered USC, Texas, and Colorado
by a combined count of 126-64.
Considering all the game hype,
it's possible that the two schools
actually accorded each other too
much respect. Nebraska so con
cerned itself with cutting off the
Sooners' outside running game,
that OU quarterback John
Mildren (who passed for two
touchdowns and ran for two
more) was just about free to do as
he pleased.
Oklahoma, by the same token,
was so conscious of the Husker
passing attack (namely Jerry Tagge
to the fleet Johnny Rodgers) that it
got ripped up inside by Jeff Kin
ney (172 yards rushing and four
TD's).
These defensive oversights
seemed to even out however.
While Nebraska was twice able to
forge 11-point leads (14-3 in the
second quarter and 28-17 in the
third), Mildren was also twice able
to squire his team back in front.
The difference in the game was

Johnny Rodgers, whose clutch
catches and 72-yard punt return
TD early in the first quarter gave
the Huskers their separating
points. Rodgers, who punctuated
his dramatic return by throwing
up, might well have retched
some more had he been able to
hear Bremser'saccount of the play
. . . "HOLY MOLY! MAN, WOM
AN, AND CHILD — DID THAT
PUT 'EM IN THE AISLES!! JOHN
NY "THE JET" RODGERS JUST
TORE 'EM LOOSE FROM THEIR
SHOES!!" Yessir.

Sugar Bowl (New Year's Eve)
NOTRF DAMF 24 ALABAMA 23.
Site: Tulane Stadium in New Or
leans before 81,161.
The last Sugar Bowl held in
Tulane Stadium was perhaps the
best football game ever played
there. Notre Dame — a de
termined, poised, and imaginative
outfit — came from behind three
times (first on Al Hunter's 93-yard
kickoff return and finally on Bob
Thomas' 26-yard field goal) to de
feat one of the deepest and most
explosive teams in college foot
ball history.
Bear Bryant's 16th Alabama
team ran 70-deep and the top

ranked Crimson Tide needed only
to squeeze by No. 3 Notre Dame
(in a match of unbeatens) to seize
the national championship. At
midnight, however, the Irish were
the ones with the champagne.
Notre Dame quarterback Tom
Clements made the play of the
game when — on third-and-nine
from his own two with the Irish up
but 24-23 — he retreated into his
own end zone, stood on his
ground, and hit tight end Robin
Weber for 35 yards, the first down,
the game, and the national crown.
The Irish would get their's the
following year.

N0v.30, 1974: USC 55 NOTRE
DAMP 24
Site: Los Angeles Coliseum
before 83,552
It started out so fine for the
Fighting Irish. With fullback
Wayne Bullock rumbling through
the Trojans and signal-caller Tom
Clements passing over and
around them, Notre Dame blew
out to a 24-0 lead in the second
period. . .and then the lights went
out.
Just before the half, SC quarter
back Pat Haden hit tailback An
thony Davis for seven yards to put

the Trojans on the board. Score at
the intermission: Notre Dame 24,
USC 6.
The Irish kicked off to open the
third period and that was the last
time they were in the game. Davis
•returned the boot 102 yards (his
sixth kick-return touchdown, an
NCAA record) and just like that
the Trojans were only down 12.
USC got the ball back promptly
and Haden wasted no time. He
connected with J.K. McKay for 31
yards to set up Davis' six-yard TD
run. Kick good. Notre Dame 24,
USC 19. Back on the attack, Haden
bombed the Irish twice and then
watched gleefully as as Davis
blasted in from the four. A.D.'s
two-pointer put the Trojans up by
a field-goal.
And it got worse. Following
Marvin Cobb's 56-yard punt-re
turn, Haden fired an 18-yard strike
to McKay and suddenly USC was
up by 10. That margin became 17
when Haden-to-McKay covered
44 yards and still more paydirt.
The fourth quarter was frosting.
Haden to Shelton Diggs (16 yards)
made it 48-24, and Clements to
SC's Charles Phillips (58 yards)
brought the final spread to 31.
USC had scored 55 points in 17
minutes! MAN, WOMAN, AND
CHILD. . .

When you have devoted what
seems to be the better part of your
last 11 autumns to this wonderful
beast known as college football;
when you find your sleep inter
rupted by visions of Keith Jackson
going over the top and Frank
Broyles mumbling something to
the effect of, "Those ELLessYOU

tually remember the days when
Chuck Fairbanks could coach and
Pat Haden was not a Rhodes
scholar and was an effective quar
terback — when you have
reached this pitiful point, as I cer
tainly have, there comes a time
when you must explain yourself to
the more sensible among us.
And that time is now.
What is it about college foot
ball? Why all the fuss? Is it the
Bowl games? Is it the Bear? The
wishbone? The USC tailbacks?
The rivalries? The upsets? 1 he
cheerleaders? The Fireman's Fund
Flashbacks? The latest NCAA re
cruiting "violations?" What is it?
For me (and I suppose for the
rest of Americans as well), the Big
Games are it. And not Stanford-
Cal, mind you. The really Big
Games. The kind of games that
you long for days, and even

weeks, in advance. The kind of
games thJt convert you into your
own personal marching band. The
kind of games that play every bit as
well on the field as they do in the
papers.
During the '70s, I ran across
three especially great games —
the identities of which I will keep
secret fora moment. These may
not be the absolutely, positively
best games of the past decade, but
to me they remain something
quite special. Their combined
nine hours represent the very best
of sport — the promise that is
fulfilled.
And so for the fun of it, here is a
look back . . .

Thanksgiving Day, 1971: NE

Site: Owen Stadium in Norman,
Oklahoma before a crowd of
63,385.
"OH MAN, WOMAN, AND
CHILD!", bellowed Lyle Bremser,
the sainted Voice of the Corn
huskers. "I never thought I would
live this long to see this kind of
football game!" Amen. The
"Game of the Decade" was in
deed perfection in pigskin. Ne
braska (10-0, ranked No. 1) versus
Oklahoma (9-0, No. 2). The Corn
huskers' murderous defense

pitted against the Sooners' wither
ing Whooshbone T offense.
Though Nebraska was slightly
favored, the Sooners came into
the contest having played — and
waylayed — tougher opponents.
In one memorable three-game
stretch in October, Oklahoma —
fired by Greg Pruitt's 50 rushes for
611 yards, an astounding 12.2 yard
average per carry — had clob
bered USC, Texas, and Colorado
by a combined count of 126-64.
Considering all the game hype,
it's possible that the two schools
actually accorded each other too
much respect. Nebraska so con
cerned itself with cutting off the
Sooners' outside running game,
that OU quarterback John
Mildren (who passed for two
touchdowns and ran for two
more) was just about free to do as
he pleased.
Oklahoma, by the same token,
was so conscious of the Husker
passing attack (namely Jerry Tagge
to the fleet Johnny Rodgers) that it
got ripped up inside by Jeff Kin
ney (172 yards rushing and four
TD's).
These defensive oversights
seemed to even out however.
While Nebraska was twice able to
forge 11-point leads (14-3 in the
second quarter and 28-17 in the
third), Mildren was also twice able
to squire his team back in front.
The difference in the game was

Johnny Rodgers, whose clutch
catches and 72-yard punt return
TD early in the first quarter gave
the Huskers their separating
points. Rodgers, who punctuated
his dramatic return by throwing
up, might well have retched
some more had he been able to

The last Sugar Bowl held in
Tulane Stadium was perhaps the
best football game ever played
there. Notre Dame — a de

outfit — came from behind three
times (first on Al Hunter's 93-yard
kickoff return and finally on Bob
Thomas' 26-yard field goal) to de
feat one of the deepest and most
explosive teams in college foot
ball history.
Bear Bryant's 16th Alabama

ranked Crimson Tide needed only
to squeeze by No. 3 Notre Dame
(in a match of unbeatens) to seize
the national championship. At
midnight, however, the Irish were
the ones with the champagne.
Notre Dame quarterback Tom
Clements made the play of the
game when — on third-and-nine
from his own two with the Irish up
but 24-23 — he retreated into his
own end zone, stood on his
ground, and hit tight end Robin
Weber for 35 yards, the first down,
the game, and the national crown.
The Irish would get their's the

out to a 24-0 lead in the second
period. . .and then the lights went

Just before the half, SC quarter

the Trojans on the board. Score at

The Irish kicked off to open the

USC got the ball back promptly
and Haden wasted no time. He
connected with J.K. McKay for 31
yards to set up Davis' six-yard TD
run. Kick good. Notre Dame 24,

bombed the Irish twice and then
watched gleefully as as Davis

And it got worse. Following

When you have devoted what
seems to be the better part of your
last 11 autumns to this wonderful
beast known as college football;
when you find your sleep inter
rupted by visions of Keith Jackson
going over the top and Frank
Broyles mumbling something to
the effect of, "Those ELLessYOU
BaYOU Bengals are somethin'
else!"; when you know it's No
vember because you have willing
ly traded in your ROSE BOWL BE
LIEVER button fora OUST FAUST
bumper sticker; when you can ac
tually remember the days when
Chuck Fairbanks could coach and
Pat Haden was not a Rhodes
scholar and was an effective quar
terback — when you have
reached this pitiful point, as I cer
tainly have, there comes a time
when you must explain yourself to
the more sensible among us.
And that time is now.
What is it about college foot
ball? Why all the fuss? Is it the
Bowl games? Is it the Bear? The
wishbone? The USC tailbacks?
The rivalries? The upsets? 1 he
cheerleaders? The Fireman's Fund
Flashbacks? The latest NCAA re
cruiting "violations?" What is it?
For me (and I suppose for the
rest of Americans as well), the Big
Games are it. And not Stanford-
Cal, mind you. The really Big
Games. The kind of games that
you long for days, and even

weeks, in advance. The kind of
games thJt convert you into your
own personal marching band. The
kind of games that play every bit as
well on the field as they do in the
papers.
During the '70s, I ran across
three especially great games —
the identities of which I will keep
secret fora moment. These may
not be the absolutely, positively
best games of the past decade, but
to me they remain something
quite special. Their combined
nine hours represent the very best
of sport — the promise that is
fulfilled.
And so for the fun of it, here is a
look back . . .

Thanksgiving Day, 1971: NE
BRASKA 35 OKLAHOMA 31
Site: Owen Stadium in Norman,
Oklahoma before a crowd of
63,385.
"OH MAN, WOMAN, AND
CHILD!", bellowed Lyle Bremser,
the sainted Voice of the Corn
huskers. "I never thought I would
live this long to see this kind of
football game!" Amen. The
"Game of the Decade" was in
deed perfection in pigskin. Ne
braska (10-0, ranked No. 1) versus
Oklahoma (9-0, No. 2). The Corn
huskers' murderous defense

pitted against the Sooners' wither
ing Whooshbone T offense.
Though Nebraska was slightly
favored, the Sooners came into
the contest having played — and
waylayed — tougher opponents.
In one memorable three-game
stretch in October, Oklahoma —
fired by Greg Pruitt's 50 rushes for
611 yards, an astounding 12.2 yard
average per carry — had clob
bered USC, Texas, and Colorado
by a combined count of 126-64.
Considering all the game hype,
it's possible that the two schools
actually accorded each other too
much respect. Nebraska so con
cerned itself with cutting off the
Sooners' outside running game,
that OU quarterback John
Mildren (who passed for two
touchdowns and ran for two
more) was just about free to do as
he pleased.
Oklahoma, by the same token,
was so conscious of the Husker
passing attack (namely Jerry Tagge
to the fleet Johnny Rodgers) that it
got ripped up inside by Jeff Kin
ney (172 yards rushing and four
TD's).
These defensive oversights
seemed to even out however.
While Nebraska was twice able to
forge 11-point leads (14-3 in the
second quarter and 28-17 in the
third), Mildren was also twice able
to squire his team back in front.
The difference in the game was

Johnny Rodgers, whose clutch
catches and 72-yard punt return
TD early in the first quarter gave
the Huskers their separating
points. Rodgers, who punctuated
his dramatic return by throwing
up, might well have retched
some more had he been able to
hear Bremser'saccount of the play
. . . "HOLY MOLY! MAN, WOM
AN, AND CHILD — DID THAT
PUT 'EM IN THE AISLES!! JOHN
NY "THE JET" RODGERS JUST
TORE 'EM LOOSE FROM THEIR
SHOES!!" Yessir.

Sugar Bowl (New Year's Eve)
NOTRF DAMF 24 ALABAMA 23.
Site: Tulane Stadium in New Or
leans before 81,161.
The last Sugar Bowl held in
Tulane Stadium was perhaps the
best football game ever played
there. Notre Dame — a de
termined, poised, and imaginative
outfit — came from behind three
times (first on Al Hunter's 93-yard
kickoff return and finally on Bob
Thomas' 26-yard field goal) to de
feat one of the deepest and most
explosive teams in college foot
ball history.
Bear Bryant's 16th Alabama
team ran 70-deep and the top

ranked Crimson Tide needed only
to squeeze by No. 3 Notre Dame
(in a match of unbeatens) to seize
the national championship. At
midnight, however, the Irish were
the ones with the champagne.
Notre Dame quarterback Tom
Clements made the play of the
game when — on third-and-nine
from his own two with the Irish up
but 24-23 — he retreated into his
own end zone, stood on his
ground, and hit tight end Robin
Weber for 35 yards, the first down,
the game, and the national crown.
The Irish would get their's the
following year.

N0v.30, 1974: USC 55 NOTRE
DAMP 24
Site: Los Angeles Coliseum
before 83,552
It started out so fine for the
Fighting Irish. With fullback
Wayne Bullock rumbling through
the Trojans and signal-caller Tom
Clements passing over and
around them, Notre Dame blew
out to a 24-0 lead in the second
period. . .and then the lights went
out.
Just before the half, SC quarter
back Pat Haden hit tailback An
thony Davis for seven yards to put

the Trojans on the board. Score at
the intermission: Notre Dame 24,
USC 6.
The Irish kicked off to open the
third period and that was the last
time they were in the game. Davis
•returned the boot 102 yards (his
sixth kick-return touchdown, an
NCAA record) and just like that
the Trojans were only down 12.
USC got the ball back promptly
and Haden wasted no time. He
connected with J.K. McKay for 31
yards to set up Davis' six-yard TD
run. Kick good. Notre Dame 24,
USC 19. Back on the attack, Haden
bombed the Irish twice and then
watched gleefully as as Davis
blasted in from the four. A.D.'s
two-pointer put the Trojans up by
a field-goal.
And it got worse. Following
Marvin Cobb's 56-yard punt-re
turn, Haden fired an 18-yard strike
to McKay and suddenly USC was
up by 10. That margin became 17
when Haden-to-McKay covered
44 yards and still more paydirt.
The fourth quarter was frosting.
Haden to Shelton Diggs (16 yards)
made it 48-24, and Clements to
SC's Charles Phillips (58 yards)
brought the final spread to 31.
USC had scored 55 points in 17
minutes! MAN, WOMAN, AND
CHILD. . .
