## Booters face rival USF 
### Adam Berns 
"We love to play giant
killer," says Stanford soccer
coach Nelson Lodge. The
Cardinals will get a chance to
do just that when they take on
the University of San Francisco
Dons today, in San Francisco.
Gametime is at 3 p.m.
Even though Stanford has no
chance for postseason action,
this game is still important for
the Cardinals. USF is one of
their traditional rivals, as well as
one of the best teams in the na
tion. It isa"must win"gamefor
USF in order to assure them
selves of a playoff spot.
This game has special signifi
cance for Stanford assistant
coach Tony Igwe. Igwe is a
former USF soccer player
himself and welcomed the op
portunity to go back and play
against his old team and former

coach.
"It's fun to go back and see
my former school," Igwe said
about today's match. "The only
thing lacking is that I won't be
able to get in there and play
myself. You know, it's a totally
different perspective from a
coach's point of view. I think
that in many ways it is more
frustrating being a coach be
cause when things don't go
right, you can't go in there and
do something about it your
self."
The Dons take a 13-2-2 rec
ord into the game. They boast a
strong, well-rounded team and
one of the best scorers in the
nation in striker Fidelis
Atueghu.
In most of the games that
they have played this year, the
Don defense has not really
been tested because oppo

nents have fallen back and
have tried to play a defensive
game against them. However,
Lodge said that he plans to at
tack USF by unleashing senior
striker Willie Guicci and the
rest of Stanford's powerful of
fense.
"We have to attack their de
fense," Lodge explains. "We
can't sit back and try to defend
USF. We have to test the USF
defense. If we let their full
backs start coming in and mak
ing plays on us, it's going to be
a long game."
One weapon that the
Cardinals have to balance Dons
tendency to bring in their full
backs, is their ability to counter
quickly. Earlier in the year,
counters played a major role in
Stanford's victory over No.1
ranked Connecticut, and they
should also play a major role
today.
Another key today will be
how well Stanford can contain
Atueghu. Although the Cards
would prefer not to mark him,
they definitely are planning on
making sure someone is always
around him. "We can't leave
Atueghu alone," Lodge said.
"He has a tendency to wander
off and we can't let him do that.

He's the type of player who
scores winners."
Igwe is also worried about
Atueghu and noted that the
Don's midfield is also quite
strong. However, Igwe added,
"even though they have solid
midfielders, I feel that we
match up favorably with
them."
One sore spot for Stanford
this year has been the number
of injuries. However, everyone

but senior striker Ted
Rafalovich should be able to
play a full game today.
Rafalovich is still hurt but
should get some playing time.
Last year Stanford lost to USF
5-1, after coming back from a
tough eastern road trip. How
ever, that game was the only
one in recent years that hadn't
been a close one.
Even though the Cardinals
will be the definite underdogs

tomorrow, don't count them
out of the game. Stanford has a
way of playing up to the level of
its competition. Remember,
the Cards have already had sev
eral tuneup matches for their
role as the "giant killer." With
solid victories over Connecti
cut and Seattle-Pacific, Stan
ford is not a newcomer to the
business of big upsets. Today,
the Cards will try to make USF
"giant" N0.3.
