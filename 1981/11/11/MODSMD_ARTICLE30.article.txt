## Booters face rival USF 
### Adam Berns 
"We love to play giant
killer," says Stanford soccer
coach Nelson Lodge. The
Cardinals will get a chance to
do just that when they take on
the University of San Francisco
Dons today, in San Francisco.
Gametime is at 3 p.m.
Even though Stanford has no
chance for postseason action,
this game is still important for
the Cardinals. USF is one of
their traditional rivals, as well as
one of the best teams in the na
tion. It isa"must win"gamefor
USF in order to assure them
selves of a playoff spot.
This game has special signifi
cance for Stanford assistant
coach Tony Igwe. Igwe is a
former USF soccer player
himself and welcomed the op
portunity to go back and play
against his old team and former

coach.
"It's fun to go back and see
my former school," Igwe said
about today's match. "The only
thing lacking is that I won't be
able to get in there and play
myself. You know, it's a totally
different perspective from a
coach's point of view. I think
that in many ways it is more
frustrating being a coach be
cause when things don't go
right, you can't go in there and
do something about it your
self."
The Dons take a 13-2-2 rec
ord into the game. They boast a
strong, well-rounded team and
one of the best scorers in the
nation in striker Fidelis
Atueghu.
In most of the games that
they have played this year, the
Don defense has not really
been tested because oppo

nents have fallen back and
have tried to play a defensive
game against them. However,
Lodge said that he plans to at
tack USF by unleashing senior
striker Willie Guicci and the
rest of Stanford's powerful of
fense.
"We have to attack their de
fense," Lodge explains. "We
can't sit back and try to defend
USF. We have to test the USF
defense. If we let their full
backs start coming in and mak
ing plays on us, it's going to be
a long game."
One weapon that the
Cardinals have to balance Dons
tendency to bring in their full
backs, is their ability to counter
quickly. Earlier in the year,
counters played a major role in
Stanford's victory over No.1
ranked Connecticut, and they
