## Oregon State retrospective 
### 
The Stanford football team has surely had
its share of troubles this year, but compared
to the problems plaguing Oregon State, they
seem miniscule. The Cards demolished the
Beavers 63-9 last Saturday in Corvallis, toying
with their opponents the way older brothers
do in pick-up games against their younger
brethren.
National attention this weekend focused
on the Wildcats of Northwestern University,
who on Saturday lost their 29th straight game
to establish an NCAA record. But surveying
the Card-Beavers game from high above the
field at Parker Stadium, it seemed that the
Beavers were really the best at being the
worst.
For sheer ineptness, the Beavers' record
speaks for itself. If they had failed to over
come a 28-point deficit in their 1981 opener
against Fresno State, they would now have
lost 23 in a row. And if it wasn't for the
freakish play in Corvallis two years ago when
Card Rick Gervais stepped back into the end
zone fora safety on a kick-off return to hand
the Beavers a 33-31 victory, the streak would
now be 33. As it is, Oregon State has managed
to lose 31 out of its last 33 games.
The really sad thing is that fans and sup
porters in the Willamette Valley were actually
pleased with OSU's performance over the
weekend.
"As riHioijlo*js a*, it lounds," said OSU head
coach Joe Avezzano, "our defense was better
today. The defense definitely made more
things happen." This was after his team had
just yielded 684 yards of total offense and 63
points, the most ever by a Beaver team.
"Our team has brighter days ahead," the
second-year OSU coach concluded. Oh
yeah?
There is a weird feeling in the air at Oregon

State these days. Everyone seems to be ob
livious to the travesty before them. It is as
though they were at a movie theatre,
scrunching down in their seats so as to not to
see the horrors on the screen. But the cold re
ality is that the horrors are there. And that
they are not going to go away fora long time.
Cardinal linebacker Dave Morze put the
Beavers' future in perspective. "It's so hard
for them, they haven't had a winning record
in, how many years? Especially the location of
this place. If they had to recruit 10 guys who
would take a chance and come here. . . .until
they get a winning season, I don't see how
they can do it. I'd say it's pretty much an im
possible situation right now."
No one feels this more than OSU athletic
director Dee Andros, who I had the pleasure
of sitting by during Saturday's debacle. As he
puffed on a stogie, I thought to myself that he
hadn't changed much from the days when he
used to coach the Beavers himself. In fact, he
hadn't changed at all, save fora few more
wrinkles, since the days when I was a kid and
would see him at the "Civil War" game be
tween Oregon and Oregon State every year.
Being an avid Duck fan, I used to have con
tempt in my heart for this man with the huge
jowls they call the "Great Pumpkin." But as I
sat in the press box, watching the massacre
unravel, I actually had to feel pity for him. His
football team was looking like a joke. He sat
there watching too, drawing In on his over
sized cigar a little bit more for every touch
down the Cards rolled up.
Surprisingly, I saw a gleam in his eye as the
final gun sounded. He got up from his seat
with much effort, put his Dutch Masters out,
and looked beyond the football field over to
Gill Coliseum with a grin. You see, the game
had ended and now basketball season had
moved one week closer.

now be 33. As it is, Oregon State has managed
to lose 31 out of its last 33 games.
The really sad thing is that fans and sup
porters in the Willamette Valley were actually
pleased with OSU's performance over the
weekend.
"As riHioijlo*js a*, it lounds," said OSU head
coach Joe Avezzano, "our defense was better
today. The defense definitely made more
things happen." This was after his team had
just yielded 684 yards of total offense and 63
points, the most ever by a Beaver team.
"Our team has brighter days ahead," the
second-year OSU coach concluded. Oh
yeah?
There is a weird feeling in the air at Oregon

State these days. Everyone seems to be ob
livious to the travesty before them. It is as
though they were at a movie theatre,
scrunching down in their seats so as to not to
see the horrors on the screen. But the cold re
ality is that the horrors are there. And that
they are not going to go away fora long time.
Cardinal linebacker Dave Morze put the
Beavers' future in perspective. "It's so hard
for them, they haven't had a winning record
in, how many years? Especially the location of
this place. If they had to recruit 10 guys who
would take a chance and come here. . . .until
they get a winning season, I don't see how
they can do it. I'd say it's pretty much an im
possible situation right now."
No one feels this more than OSU athletic
director Dee Andros, who I had the pleasure
of sitting by during Saturday's debacle. As he
puffed on a stogie, I thought to myself that he
hadn't changed much from the days when he
used to coach the Beavers himself. In fact, he
hadn't changed at all, save fora few more
wrinkles, since the days when I was a kid and
would see him at the "Civil War" game be
tween Oregon and Oregon State every year.
Being an avid Duck fan, I used to have con
tempt in my heart for this man with the huge
jowls they call the "Great Pumpkin." But as I
sat in the press box, watching the massacre
unravel, I actually had to feel pity for him. His
football team was looking like a joke. He sat
there watching too, drawing In on his over
sized cigar a little bit more for every touch
down the Cards rolled up.
Surprisingly, I saw a gleam in his eye as the
final gun sounded. He got up from his seat
with much effort, put his Dutch Masters out,
and looked beyond the football field over to
Gill Coliseum with a grin. You see, the game
had ended and now basketball season had
moved one week closer.
