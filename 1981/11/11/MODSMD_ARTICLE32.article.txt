Stockholm, Sweden (AP) — Gene
Mayer, wearing down his big brother with
stinging serves and a tenacious forehand,
trounced Sandy Mayer 6-4, 6-2 Monday
night to win the singles title in the $200,000
Stockholm Open Tennis Championships
for the first time.
It was the first-ever final between two
brothers in a Grand Prix Super Series
event. But several brothers played major
championship finals before the game's
open era.
Gene Mayer, who has one of the most
varied attacks in thegame, never really was
challenged. It almost was as one-sided as
the 1977 final, when Sandy Mayer whipped
Ray Moore in straight sets here.
"His forehand was impeccable and I've
never seen him serve so well," Sandy said
afterward.
"I didn't serve bad myself. I hit four first
serves in one game, but I was still broken.

That tells something of his returns too."
Gene, who didn't even drop a set to
Sandy in their two previous matches as
pros, scored the only service break in the
first set fora 1-0 lead. He wrapped up the
set with a pair of aces and another bullet
which Sandy hardly got his racket on.
The first set lasted only 25 minutes.
Gene, who was seeded third in this in
door event, broke through again fora 2-1
edge in the second set. He then held to
love, again acing his brother twice. Anoth
er break gave him a commanding 4-1 lead.
"It was a question of which would be
most effective - his agressive style or my
change of rhythm," Gene said afterward.
"I think he got a little bit flustered. It's
more important for him to serve weil than
me."
Sandy's baseline game — which keyed
his 6-3, 6-3 upset of top-seeded Jimmy
Connors in the semifinals Saturday — also

was disappointing.
Gene said he probably would take a long
break until late January because his
chances to qualify for the Grand Prix Mas
ters in New York are slim.
Several fluke type injuries kept Gene
sidelined during the most important peri
od of the European summerseason and his
ranking dropped from fourth at the end of
1980 to eighth.
Gene, the ninth American since 1970 to
win the coveted tourney — the only of
ficial indoor championship recognized by
the International Tennis Federation —
picked up $28,000 for his first Grand Prix
triumph since last August. Sandy won
$16,000.
Bjorn Borg, the 1980 champion, did not
defend the l\t\e \r\ h\s V\om«\ovvn \out -
nament. John McEnroe, the 1978 and 1979
champ whom Borg whipped in last year's
final, also skipped the event.
