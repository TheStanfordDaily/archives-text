## 
### Lisa Stern 
"It wasn't our best effort of
the year, but we were unspec
tacularly steady," stated Stan
ford head coach Fred Sturm in
assessing the performance of
the women's volleyball team
against Santa Clara.
The Stanford spikers domi
nated all aspects of the match
as they coralled the Broncos in
three consecutive games last
night, 15-3,15-7,15-4 at Maples
Pavilion.
The win gives the Cardinals,
now ranked third in the nation
according to the NCAA coach's
poll, a 29-12 overall season rec
ord and reestablishes their
hold on second place in the
NorCal Athletic Conference
with an 8-1 league mark. The
team remains one game be
hind the University of Pacific,
the Cards' next "opponent
tomorrow night.
In game one the teams alter
nated points as Stanford took

the early advantage 2-1.
Sophomore setter Kari Rush
blew the game wide open,
however, by serving for six
straight points to give the Cards
an 8-1 lead. The Santa Clara
squad could only manage two
more points as the Cardinal
spikers routed their opponents
15-3, and the onslaught began.
In the second game, Sturm
substituted for all of his starting
players except senior Jan
Linden. With the Cards behind
2-3 freshman Susan Compton
served for six points to put
Stanford ahead 8-3. Santa Clara
scored two before the Cards
sided out and pulled into an
11-5 advantage. Again the
Broncos attempted a come
back by scoring two points, but
it wasn't enough as sophomore
Julie Baker contributed two
key spikes at her outside hitter
position, and Stanford went on
to win game two, 15-7.
Santa Clara pulled out to an

early 3-1 lead in the third game
before Stanford evened up and
pulled ahead 4-3. Freshman
Deidra Dvorak then served for
four points, and the Cards
broke open the game 8-3. The
Broncos could only manage to
post one additional point as the
Spikers took the third game
15-4 to win the match.
Sturm was especially im
pressed with the play of de
fensive specialist Kisi Haine in
the Cardinal win. Healso noted
the effectiveness of the Stan
ford setters as a key to the vic
tory.
Assistant coach Don Shaw
said that he believes his squad
successfully took advantage of
the ailing Broncos, who are
now 2-7 in conference play.
"We did a good job in that
we kept the quality of play high
on our side of the net," Shaw
explained. "Santa Clara was
not playing well, obviously."
The Stanford spikers now

prepare for what might be their
most important game of the
season as they travel to Stock
ton tomorrow afternoon to
face the undefeated UOP
Tigers at 7:30 p.m.
UOP, now rated seventh in
the nation, beat Stanford on
0ct.16 in four games on the
Cards' home court. The
Cardinals represent the only
threat to interrupt UOP's Nor-
Cal league championship
reign.
Sturm looks for his squad to
put together its most consistent
effort of the season when it
takes the floor against Pacific.
He will stress defense in match
preparation as the Tigers have
powerful serving and show
strength in blocking.
"We have to prevent them
from scoring points," he ex
plained. "We have to play con
sistently well for as long as pos
sible."

SPIKERS SLAM SANTA CLARA — The Stanford women's volleyball team roped and tied
the UC-Santa Clara spikers in three straight games last night at Maples Pavilion, 15-3,
15-7, 15-4. The victory gives the Cards, now ranked N0.3 in the nation, a 79-12 overall
record and a 8-1 NorCal conference mark.
"It wasn't our best effort of
the year, but we were unspec
tacularly steady," stated Stan
ford head coach Fred Sturm in
assessing the performance of
the women's volleyball team
against Santa Clara.
The Stanford spikers domi
nated all aspects of the match
as they coralled the Broncos in
three consecutive games last
night, 15-3,15-7,15-4 at Maples
Pavilion.
The win gives the Cardinals,
now ranked third in the nation
according to the NCAA coach's
poll, a 29-12 overall season rec
ord and reestablishes their
hold on second place in the
NorCal Athletic Conference
with an 8-1 league mark. The
team remains one game be
hind the University of Pacific,
the Cards' next "opponent
tomorrow night.
In game one the teams alter
nated points as Stanford took

the early advantage 2-1.
Sophomore setter Kari Rush
blew the game wide open,
however, by serving for six
straight points to give the Cards
an 8-1 lead. The Santa Clara
squad could only manage two
more points as the Cardinal
spikers routed their opponents
15-3, and the onslaught began.
In the second game, Sturm
substituted for all of his starting
players except senior Jan
Linden. With the Cards behind
2-3 freshman Susan Compton
served for six points to put
Stanford ahead 8-3. Santa Clara
scored two before the Cards
sided out and pulled into an
11-5 advantage. Again the
Broncos attempted a come
back by scoring two points, but
it wasn't enough as sophomore
Julie Baker contributed two
key spikes at her outside hitter
position, and Stanford went on
to win game two, 15-7.
Santa Clara pulled out to an

early 3-1 lead in the third game
before Stanford evened up and
pulled ahead 4-3. Freshman
Deidra Dvorak then served for
four points, and the Cards
broke open the game 8-3. The
Broncos could only manage to
post one additional point as the
Spikers took the third game
15-4 to win the match.
Sturm was especially im
pressed with the play of de
fensive specialist Kisi Haine in
the Cardinal win. Healso noted
the effectiveness of the Stan
ford setters as a key to the vic
tory.
Assistant coach Don Shaw
said that he believes his squad
successfully took advantage of
the ailing Broncos, who are
now 2-7 in conference play.
"We did a good job in that
we kept the quality of play high
on our side of the net," Shaw
explained. "Santa Clara was
not playing well, obviously."
The Stanford spikers now

prepare for what might be their
most important game of the
season as they travel to Stock
ton tomorrow afternoon to
face the undefeated UOP
Tigers at 7:30 p.m.
UOP, now rated seventh in
the nation, beat Stanford on
0ct.16 in four games on the
Cards' home court. The
Cardinals represent the only
threat to interrupt UOP's Nor-
Cal league championship
reign.
Sturm looks for his squad to
put together its most consistent
effort of the season when it
takes the floor against Pacific.
He will stress defense in match
preparation as the Tigers have
powerful serving and show
strength in blocking.
"We have to prevent them
from scoring points," he ex
plained. "We have to play con
sistently well for as long as pos
sible."
