# Huntington picked hockey All-America
## 
### Mike Thurman 
Patsy Huntington, Stanford's
high-scoring sophomore for
ward, learned yesterday that
she has been named to the 1981
NCAA Field Hockey All-Amer
ica team.
The two-time U.S. Field
Hockey Association "A" squad
member will travel to Orlando,
Florida along with 25 other Ail-
Americans to participate in the
National Hockey Festival dur
ing the week of Nov. 22-29.
Huntington led the
Cardinals to a winning season
(3-2-1 in league, 6-5-3 overall)
with 16 goals, only one shy of
the single-season scoring rec

ord she co-holds with former
Stanford All-American Nancy
White.
A member of the Card's so
called "Youth Corps," made
up of the 11 underclasswomen
who saw extensive playing time
this year, Huntington is also
part of the "Philadelphia Con
nection." Hailing from Lafa
yette Hill, she is one of four
team members who came to
Stanford from Pennsylvania.
Only three other West Coast
players were selected for All-
America honors: Robin Porter
and Toni Cody of Long Beach
State and Sue Walker of the
NCAA Western Regional

champion San Jose State team.
The National Hockey Festival
will be a major U.S. hockey
event, composed of separate
tournaments for the U.S. High
School All-America team, the
U.S. College All-America team
and a national club cham
pionship tournament.
Among those attending the
national club tournament will
be Stanford Women's Field
Hockey coach Onnie Killefer
and White, both former All-
Americans and Olympic team
members.
Huntington and her team
mates were happy at the news
of her selection, which came as

the team prepares to close out
the season with two non
league games against Califor
nia tomorrow and the Stanford
Alumnae a week from today.
Despite the fact that neither
match matters to the final rec
ord of the team, it is evident
that much pride and emotion
will be at stake in both
matches.
Berkeley faces the Stanford
team as a warm-up match in
preparation for the AIAW Na
tional Championship which
will be held at Cal in two
weeks.
