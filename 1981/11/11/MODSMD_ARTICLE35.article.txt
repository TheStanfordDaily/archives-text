The Stanford sailing team
established itself as a force
to be reckoned with over
the weekend by winning
the Fall Dinghy Cham
pionships held Saturday and
Sunday at Lake Lopez in San
Luis Obispo.
The 20-race series, hosted
by Cal-Poly SLO, featured
some of the best teams in
the country including na
tionally No.l ranked Long
Beach State which boasts
three All-America skippers.
Stanford, which is now
ranked N0.6 nationally, was
led this weekend by its two
veteran stalwarts Paul Yost
and Scott Merrill who took
topscoring honors in the re
gatta. Freshman Jeanne
Mowry crewed for Yost,
who captains the team and
was an All-America nomi

nee last season. Senior Deb
bie Bloomberg, Yost's crew
last year, crewed for Merrill.
Trailing Long Beach by 18
points after the first day of
sailing, Yost and Merrill
went to work in the last nine
races and pulled ahead by
two points goinß into the
10th race Sunday.
Yost flew off the start in
the all-important last race
and by the half mark ap
parently had the race won.
But he was called for jump
ing the gun by about four
feet and as a result auto
matically finished last.
At that point, it looked
like Long Beach would win
the race and take the regat
ta, but Yost filed a protest
saying he was team sailed by
the Long Beach squad (team
sailing means a group of
boats from Team A obstruct

a boat from Team B so that
another boat from Team A
can take advantage).
The protest was upheld
and the lead Long Beach
boat was disqualified giving
Stanford the victory. Had
Yost won the race he would
have taken top point honors
in the regatta but instead
finished second to Merrill.
"We've been knocking
on the door for about a
year," Stanford coach Joe
Petrucci said. "This year I
feel like we're finally there. I
think we can win the North
Americans (held in June).
Last year I set a goal of finish
ing in the Top-10 nationally
and we finished 10th. My
goal this year is to finish in
the Top-Five. We're sixth
now and this regatta really
showed something about
our program."
