# Journalist blames Poland's problems on mismanagement

The key to Poland's current economic
crisis is mismanagement and not striking
workers, according to Jacek Kalabinski, pres
ident of the Warsaw chapter of the journalist
Association and foreign affairs commentator
for Polish radio.
Kalabinski, speaking yesterday before a
Bechtel International Center luncheon, ad
dressed himself briefly to several questions
most frequently asked on his lecture
tour/vacation that has taken him all over the
United States.
Contrary to a popular misconception, one
which is helped by reports in the Western
press, Poles are not constantly on strike, he
said. Statistics compiled in August 1980 show

that in the previous 15 months, only five
hours were lost per worker as a result of a
strike, according to Kalabinski. "One hun
dred and fifty work hours in the same period
were lost to mismanagement," he said.
Mismanagement is pervasive, Kalabinski
said. Walking by a construction site, it is not
uncommon to see every second window
broken. This is not because workers are in
herently vandals, he said, but because they
are paid on the basis of the total cost of the
building and cannot resist temptation to in
crease its cost.
Mismanagement is also behind the cur
rent food shortage, according to Kalabinski.
The history of mismanagement of agricul
ture goes back to 1956 when the government

began promoting state collectivised farms.
Most fertilizer and machinery is allocated to
state farms, he said, though 87 percent of
Polish farms remain in individual hands.
How, Kalabinski asked, can farmers produce
more if they cannot buy any capital equip
ment?
"The harvest this year has been good,'
Kalabinski said, but farmers have so far sold
only 7 percent of their grain to the govern
ment. "They are hoarding the grain waiting
for the government to pay more."
Still, the shortage of foods is critical: the
ration of meat is 3 1 /2 pounds per person each
month —"one Big Mac a person each week"
— and there are no substitutes. "I wonder all
the time if I should buy sugar or soap to take

with me on the plane back," Kalabinski
joked.
Strikers, said Kalabinski, do not demand
higher pay, only that the government live up
the agreements it made Aug. 23, 1980, after
lengthy talks with Solidarity, the independ
ent Polish labor union.
But the Polish government believes it
committed the "original sin" of yielding too
many far-reaching concessions in those
talks, he said. The government is divided into
two groups, and those most opposed to
change have the upper hand at the moment,
he said.
Those most ardently resisting change are
the 300,000 managers of Poland's ailing
economy. They have been appointed by the

party on the basis of politics ratherthen mer
it, Kalabinski said. "They have a vested in
terest in making things appear to change
while changing nothing."
Demands on the government have not
stopped because there has been little con
cession to popular demands, he said. One of
Solidarity's unsatisfied demands is access to
the media. Solidarity has been limited so far
to one weekly paper for its 10 million mem
bers, he said.
Although Poland's revised censorship
laws, which became effective Oct.l, limit
censorship to defense, foreign affairs and
fundamental changes in the constitution,
the government retains control over such
basics as newsprint for publica
tions, according to Kalabinski. No
newsprint is allocated to Solidarity,
he said, and it is impossible to
purchase on the free market.
Censors have been eliminated, he
said, but effective censorship re
mains through party-appointed edi
tors. Editors "are brighter than the
censors," he said. Half of my time is
devoted to research and writing, the
other half to wrangling with my edi
tor."
The reason the Soviet Union hasn't
invaded Poland yet, Kalabinski said,
lies in the desire of the Warsaw pact
for stability. It is for this reason that
the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in
1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968.
But in Poland the situation is dif
ferent. There are already Warsaw
pact troops on Polish soil and prag
matic leadership has prevailed. "If
we proceed slowly, they (the Warsaw
pact) will accept the changes and see
that stability in Poland can only be
achieved through democratic lines,"
Kalabinski said.
"What do Poles want?" Kalabinski
asked. "We want more say about our
own fate rather then being puppets
to bureaucracy."
