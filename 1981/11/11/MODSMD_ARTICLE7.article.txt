# Reagan defends limited war statement
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yester
day defended his foreign policy against charges of
disarray and belligerence, but at the same time re
peated earlier stands on limited nuclear war in Eu
rope and the Saudi Arabia Mideast peace plan that
have generated trouble overseas.
Reagan also said that "so far I've had no answer"
to the disagreement last week between Secretary
of State Alexander Haig and Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger over whether a nuclear weap
ons "demonstration shot" is part of North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) strategy. Later, the
White House said Reagan actually had the answer
but chose not to disclose it.
In words that may reverberate abroad, Reagan
repeated his stand that battlefield nuclear warfare
in Europe would not necessarily bring on an ex
change of strategic nuclear attacks by the United
States and the Soviet Union. His statement along
these lines in an Oct. 16 interview with out-of
town editors stirred a storm in Western Europe,
where U.S. strategy for nuclear war is at issue in po
litical debate and street demonstrations.
"There's high risk, there's no question of that,"
said Reagan, referring to the use of battlefield nu
clear weapons. He said his Oct. 16 statement had

been offered only as a possibility "and I think
you'd still have to say that that possibility could
take place."
Haig touched off the controversy about a dem
onstration nuclear shot in Europe with testimony
last Wednesday that "there are contingency plans
in the NATO doctrine" for such a blast. The follow
ing day Weinberger testified that "there is
absolutely nothing in any of the plans with which I
am familiar that contains anything remotely re
sembling this, nor should it."
Late Thursday the administration sought to re
solve the contradiction by saying that such a dem
onstration is "a possible option" but that there is
"no precise NATO military plan." Reagan's remark
that "confusion" exists on the issue and "so far I've
had no answer" seemed to resurrect the dispute.
White House deputy press secretary Larry
Speakes told reporters after the news conference
that Reagan actually does not expect an answer.
The president knows what is in contingency plans,
said Speakes, but "he wasn't going into contingen
cies."
In his fifth news conference at the White House,
Reagan said, "We are not in disarray with regard to
foreign policy. I think our accomplishments have
been rather astounding."

As evidence, he cited 70 meetings he has had
with foreign leaders in various areas, claimed that
U.S. relationships with Canada and Mexico are
better than ever and that those with European al
lies have never bten stronger, and said "we've
progressed" in the Middle East.
His language was very general and his references
sometimes unclear. He gave no details on his
claims of success or most other points he ad
dressed in the foreign field.
The president, who summoned Haig and White
House national security adviser Richard Allen —
formerly of the Hoover Institution here — to an
hour-long discussion of foreign policy operations
last Thursday, said his aim had been to insure "that
we're a little more careful." The meeting followed
Haig's charge that a top White House official,
whom he did not name, has been waging an ex
tended "guerrilla campaign" against him.
Reagan drew laughter from reporters when he
said, "There is no animus, personal animus and
there is no bickering or backstabbing going on.
We're a very happy group."
Reagan did not address reports that Egypt was
promised a U.S. military umbrella last month in
case of an attack on Libya, despite two questions
referring to the reports.
