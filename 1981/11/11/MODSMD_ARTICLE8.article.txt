## Amnioscentesis gives 'sneak preview' 
### Ken Mertzel 
It is now possible to know
all about your unborn child,
thanks to the latest advances
in the field of obstetrics.
Prenatal diagnosis
through amnioscentesis, a
field clinically 10 years old, is
commonly used to detect
chromosomal abnormalities

such as trisomies (for exam
ple, Down's syndrome) and
abnormal sex
chromosomes.
According to Dr. Paul
Hensleigh, associate pro
fessor of gynecology and
obstetrics, "The effects of an
extra chromosome are pro

found-congenital heart
disease and mental retarda
tion. Therapies to date for
mental retardation have
been unsuccessful."
In the second lecture of
the Progress in Medicine
Series on "The Science of
Birth," Hensleigh told the
Medical Center audience,

"The incidence of
chromosomal abnormality
increases with women's age.
At birth (specifically, the
fifth month of gestation) the
female has all the ova that
she will ever possess,"
hence the woman's aging
process affects the division

of the ova.
"Women are now coun
seled at an earlier age than
they were in the past; pre
viously, women underwent
prenatal diagnosis begin
ning at ages 37-40," he
said,"Today that age has de
creased to 35, although no
strict minimum actually ex
ists."
In preparation for am
nioscentesis, the doctor
performs an ultrasound
scan which produces a pic
ture of the fetus. By measur
ing the diameter of the fetal
head with this instrument,
the doctor can determine
the gestation period (fetal
age), which is optimally 15
weeks for amnioscentesis to
be performed. The ul
trasound scan also helps lo
cate the placenta (in order
to avoid puncture during
amnioscentesis) as well as
the amniotic fluid sites, and
determines if twinsare pres
ent.
The actual procedure in
volves inserting a needle
through the uterine wall
and extracting one ounce of
amniotic fluid. Five to six
ounces of amniotic fluid are
present at the 15th week of
gestation, and the ounce
lost during amnioscentesis
is instantly replaced. No
anesthetic is administered
to the patient since the pro
cedure is relatively painless,
except for an occasional
sharp pain in the uterus, he
said.
"The anticipation and the

five-week waiting period
for results is the worst part,
not the long needle," Hen
sleigh said.
The amniotic fluid sample
is then sent to the lab where
the cells are cultivated for
three weeks to obtain an ac
tive culture, and a chemical
is added to the culture to
stop cell growth. The
chromosomes are then
photographed, cut out, and
put in rows to facilitate the
diagnosis of chromosomal
abnormalities. Mendelian
mutations and m u 11 i -
factorial conditions (for ex
ample,. neurotube defects
and anatomical birth de
fects) are not diagnosable
via amniocentesis.
Amniocentesis is not rec
ommended for women
much younger than 35 (un
less there is a history of birth
defects), since this pro
cedure is not without risks.
About a 1 percent chance of
fetal loss exists. There is also
a possibility of fluid leakage
or vaginal bleeding which
"causes anxiety, but not
much else," Hensleigh said.
It is presently believed that
the risk of Rh sensitization,
caused by leakage of fetal
cells which are Rh positive
when the mother is Rh
negative, is negligible, he
added.
Amnioscentesis is very
successful in establishing
genetic diagnosis. Slightly
less than 95 percent of those
women considered to be
high risk candidates were
found to have a normal

fetus through this pro
cedure and 4 percent were
found to have an abnormal
fetus, with an approximate 1
percent failure to reach a
diagnosis. The accuracy of
prenatal diagnosis through
amnioscentesis is 99.4 per
cent, he said.
"Errors still occur, and
even 0.6 percent error is too
much," Hensleigh said.
Another method of pre
natal diagnosis is presently
being researched at the
Medical Center is the so
called Fetal Cell Project.
Such a procedure would al
low the doctor to draw a
sample of the mother's
blood (which contains fetal
cells) and subsequently
analyze the fetal
chromosomes.
The Fetal Cell Project
would allow for detection of
chromosomal abnormalities
before the 15th week of
gestation, without the anx
iety caused by the long nee
dle involved in amnioscen
tesis. This method of pre
natal diagnosis is still at least
10 years off since better
techniques are needed to
separate the fetal cells from
the mother's blood.
Hensleigh suggested that
the concerned mother
always obtain a "second
opinion" and seek lots of
advice. Although the field
of prenatal diagnosis has
greatly advanced, "we still
have not even scratched the
surface of all the problems
that will arise."

they were in the past; pre
viously, women underwent
prenatal diagnosis begin
ning at ages 37-40," he
said,"Today that age has de
creased to 35, although no
strict minimum actually ex
ists."
In preparation for am
nioscentesis, the doctor
performs an ultrasound
scan which produces a pic
ture of the fetus. By measur
ing the diameter of the fetal
head with this instrument,
the doctor can determine
the gestation period (fetal
age), which is optimally 15
weeks for amnioscentesis to
be performed. The ul
trasound scan also helps lo
cate the placenta (in order
to avoid puncture during
amnioscentesis) as well as
the amniotic fluid sites, and
determines if twinsare pres
ent.
The actual procedure in
volves inserting a needle
through the uterine wall
and extracting one ounce of
amniotic fluid. Five to six
ounces of amniotic fluid are
present at the 15th week of
gestation, and the ounce
lost during amnioscentesis
is instantly replaced. No
anesthetic is administered
to the patient since the pro
cedure is relatively painless,
except for an occasional
sharp pain in the uterus, he
said.
"The anticipation and the

five-week waiting period
for results is the worst part,
not the long needle," Hen
sleigh said.
The amniotic fluid sample
is then sent to the lab where
the cells are cultivated for
three weeks to obtain an ac
tive culture, and a chemical
is added to the culture to
stop cell growth. The
chromosomes are then
photographed, cut out, and
put in rows to facilitate the
diagnosis of chromosomal
abnormalities. Mendelian
mutations and m u 11 i -
factorial conditions (for ex
ample,. neurotube defects
and anatomical birth de
fects) are not diagnosable
via amniocentesis.
Amniocentesis is not rec
ommended for women
much younger than 35 (un
less there is a history of birth
defects), since this pro
cedure is not without risks.
About a 1 percent chance of
fetal loss exists. There is also
a possibility of fluid leakage
or vaginal bleeding which
"causes anxiety, but not
much else," Hensleigh said.
It is presently believed that
the risk of Rh sensitization,
caused by leakage of fetal
cells which are Rh positive
when the mother is Rh
negative, is negligible, he
added.
Amnioscentesis is very
successful in establishing
genetic diagnosis. Slightly
less than 95 percent of those
women considered to be
high risk candidates were
found to have a normal

fetus through this pro
cedure and 4 percent were
found to have an abnormal
fetus, with an approximate 1
percent failure to reach a
diagnosis. The accuracy of
prenatal diagnosis through
amnioscentesis is 99.4 per
cent, he said.
"Errors still occur, and
even 0.6 percent error is too
much," Hensleigh said.
Another method of pre
natal diagnosis is presently
being researched at the
Medical Center is the so
called Fetal Cell Project.
Such a procedure would al
low the doctor to draw a
sample of the mother's
blood (which contains fetal
cells) and subsequently
analyze the fetal
chromosomes.
The Fetal Cell Project
would allow for detection of
chromosomal abnormalities
before the 15th week of
gestation, without the anx
iety caused by the long nee
dle involved in amnioscen
tesis. This method of pre
natal diagnosis is still at least
10 years off since better
techniques are needed to
separate the fetal cells from
the mother's blood.
Hensleigh suggested that
the concerned mother
always obtain a "second
opinion" and seek lots of
advice. Although the field
of prenatal diagnosis has
greatly advanced, "we still
have not even scratched the
surface of all the problems
that will arise."

It is now possible to know
all about your unborn child,
thanks to the latest advances
in the field of obstetrics.
Prenatal diagnosis
through amnioscentesis, a
field clinically 10 years old, is
commonly used to detect
chromosomal abnormalities

such as trisomies (for exam
ple, Down's syndrome) and
abnormal sex
chromosomes.
According to Dr. Paul
Hensleigh, associate pro
fessor of gynecology and
obstetrics, "The effects of an
extra chromosome are pro

found-congenital heart
disease and mental retarda
tion. Therapies to date for
mental retardation have
been unsuccessful."
In the second lecture of
the Progress in Medicine
Series on "The Science of
Birth," Hensleigh told the
Medical Center audience,

"The incidence of
chromosomal abnormality
increases with women's age.
At birth (specifically, the
fifth month of gestation) the
female has all the ova that
she will ever possess,"
hence the woman's aging
process affects the division

of the ova.

seled at an earlier age than
