# DES victims uninformed

More than half the Americans who have been
exposed to the hormone diethylstilbestrol (DES)
are unaware of it, according to Pat Cody, a foun
ding member of DES Action.
DES is a synthetic hormone that was given to
three to six million pregnant women from 1941
to 1971 to prevent miscarriage. It is now known,
however, that the hormone can cause cancer
and reproductive problems in daughters of
women who took DES and genital anomalies and
sterility in their sons.
DES Action, a nationwide organization, has
begun a special campaign in California to
educate the public about the eventual effects of
DES and to locate those who may be affected.
"We are a consumer group of DES daughters,
mothers, sons, and also health workers who are
interested in informing the public about the
dangerous consequences of DES," Cody said.
While DES is no longer administered to preg
nant women, it is still used to halt lactation in
women who decide against breastfeeding, to
counteract emotional problems in menopausal
women, and as a "morning after pill".
Cody said she is shocked by the "stupidity and
callousness'* of the medical profession because
there is no research being done on the
Hormone's effects on non-pregnant women.
"Doctors say, 'We can't prove it is harmful,'
but we say, 'You haven't proven it is safe'," she

said.
"DES Awareness Week", which took place
from October 13-20, opened the campaign, but
"it will last through January at least," Cody said.
"With the daughters, the cancer risk is rare,
but one out of two have pregnancy problems,"
Cody said. These problems include miscarriage,
premature delivery, and infertility.
In addition, sons of DES takers may be af
fected, but a lack of research has left most peo
ple unaware of this fact, according to Cody.
"In medical circles, to get a risk figure, you
need to get a study of 1000 people and we
haven't been able to do that," Cody said.
She did cite one study that was done with 380
DES sons and 307 controls, which found that 21
percent of the sons had a sperm count low
enough to cause serious fertility problems.
DES Action hopes to conduct a new study us
ing a new test which measures fertility through a
factor other than sperm count, she said. "In the
new test, the infertility problem may be larger,"
Cody said.
Cody said she is concerned that many
gynecologists may be "Pill pushers." According
to Cody, DES daughters should not take birth
control pills because like DES, it contains
estrogen which has been linked to the develop
ment of breast cancer if present in high doses.
She said that doctors, therefore, need to be
educated about DES along with the rest of the
public, so that they can be helpful in locating
those who may be affected by the hormone.
