SIGMA XI LECTURE
Earthquake Prediction
— an Elusive Goal?
Seventy five years ago San Francisco was struck by a great earthquake on the
San Andreas fault. Even though earthquakes have occurred in California since
that time, in terms of great earthquakes California has been relatively inactive
over a time interval in which it has become the most populous state in the USA.
Some earthquake predictions in other parts of the world have been successful,
but what are the characteristics of earthquakes, where do they occur in Califor
nia, and what are the prospects for their successful prediciton?
