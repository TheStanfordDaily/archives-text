ELECTRONICS
So, you want to follow your academic
career with challenging real world
problems but you are wary of Big
Company Politics —and you've developed
a healthy loathing of neckties and regi

and EPRQMS than anybody else's We in
troduced the world's first commercially
available Magnetic Bubble Memory Test
System. That's not all —we've attained
this standing in the industry while remain

We are now developing new testers for
the astoundingly complex chips of the
future. Tester design for anticipated
semiconductor technology poses system
design problems more varied and complex
than today's largest computer systems.
Apart from the obvious hardware chal
lenges, these new testers require a very
sophisticated software environment This
includes special purpose language pioces
sors, powerful interactive development
tools and special operating system features.
If you'd like to work in an environment
where effort and creativity, not politicking,
are rewarded then one of the following
jobs might be for you:
