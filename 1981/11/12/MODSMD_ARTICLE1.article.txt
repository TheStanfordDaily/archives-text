# Latest rape demands campus awareness
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Following Tuesday evening's rape
of a Stanford student near Memorial
Church — the second attack in one
week — campus police are issuing
serious warnings and advice to wom
en on campus, as well as pursuing a
full-scale investigation aided by a
possible description of the rapist.
However disturbing, "a little fear is
good right now," one of the police
officers heading the investigation
said yesterday, "at least until we
catch this kook."
Tuesday's victim, a Stanford stu
dent living on campus, was attacked
from behind and dragged into
nearby bushes between 6:30 and 7
p.m. She was walking alone near the
south side of Memorial Church. Be
cause her eyes were covered, the
young woman was unable to de
scribe her attacker, although she told

police she thought there may have
been more than one.
Meanwhile, police think two at
tempted rapes reported in the past
few days may be linked to last Thurs
day's rape of a jogger in the vicinity of
Stanford stadium.
The assailant in Thursday's rape is
described as a black male adult, be
tween 18 and 20 years old, with a
muscular build. He stands about five
foot ten inches tall and has a short,
afro-style haircut.
After learning of last Thursday's
rape, a bicyclist reported to police
that she had been accosted about 20
minutes before the incident by
someone fitting the above descrip
tion. Friday night, a woman with an
injured foot sitting on a bench in the
library area was approached by
someone also roughly fitting the as
sailant's description, the police re-

port said. He offered to accompany
her as she walked toward Tresidder
Union and she agreed. When they
got to Building 610, he shoved her
against a wall and said he was going
to rape her — she pushed him away
and threatened to scream and then
he ran off.
"We're running special foot pa
trols in plain clothes in an attempt to
catch this attacker," Herrington said.
"It's very important to report an at
tack right away," said Detective
Kathy Miller who is working on the
investigation.
"The sooner it's reported, the

sooner we can get officers to the
scene to help the victim. When you
call the emergency (911) number, the
dispatchers know the questions to
ask and get a description," ma'king it
easier for the police to be on the
lookout for the assailant.
Miller said that callers are some
times dismayed by the fact that they
are asked a lot of questions by dis
patchers. "What people don't under
stand is that dispatchers get police
cars rolling into the area immediately
and they are talking to police while
they are talking to you," she said.
Immediate notification also helps

in the prosecution of suspects later
on. Miller advised victims, despite
the possible unpleasantness, to call
the police immediately after the at
tack and not wait to go home. She
also said that rape victims should not
change their clothes immediately af
ter the attack because the rapist's
body secretions and body hair are
often still present in the clothing and
are very important pieces of evi
dence to be used later.
"Go right to a phone and call the
police, that would be my first
thought," Miller said. "I know that if I
had not had the rape awareness train

ing I might go home, too, but it's very
important that you call the police
right away."
Miller acknowledged that the
trauma of the rape and the per
ceptions about the way rape victims
are treated by the police often dis
suade victims from making this im
mediate contact. However, Miller
further explained that recent
changes in rape laws regarding the
way victims are treated should re
duce the fear associated with report
ing a rape and testifying against an at
tacker.
"(The victim) is not under police
custody, we are there to help her"
she said.
The usual process following
notification of the police that one has
been raped usually proceeds in this
way: The woman is taken to the hos
pital for medical treatment and an
examination if she agrees. Miller said
that physicians are well-trained as to
how to deal with rape victims. Police
officers no longer stand by during
the medical treatment or examina
tion, said Miller, "unlike the old days
when the victim had to go through
this humiliating experience only to
have to go through an examination in
front of police officers — and in the
days when they were all men." Fol
lowing the examination, the victim is
questioned by police, then the wom
an is usually advised to see a counsel
or, such as those available at the
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices Center (CAPS).
"Our main concern is to get her to
a doctor," Miller said.
Miller stressed the need to ex
ercise caution. "It is just not safe out

side right now," she said. "That's the
cold, hard truth.
"This morning I was driving to
work and I saw a woman walking up
Calvez Street in a business suit, carry
ing a briefcase and hitchiking. ! felt
like saying, don't you realize that a
woman was raped just across the
street?'"
. toipswts,
ever, wora of trie fnis second rape
seemed to affect students more seri
ously than usual.
"It was the topicof conversation all
day," said Junior Lisa Adler. "I think
people are really making a concerted
effort to be more aware, they're trav
elling and jogging in groups. It's a
pervasive fear."
"I didn't even want to ride my bike
tonight because it was dark and I
didn't have a light," she added.
At the Daily late Tuesday night, af
ter news of the rape came in, concern

for the safety of women staffers ap
peared to foreshadow the concern
across campus yesterday.
"I don't feel bad about making
sure that people I care about get
home or out to their cars safely," said
one male staffer. "I feel bad because I
have to."
A meeting is planned for noon to
day at the Women's Center for all
persons interested in formulating a
response to this series of attacks — all
interested faculty, staff and students
are invited to attend.
Meanwhile Miller urged anyone
with information on the suspect or
any information on the attacks to call
the police at 497-3444 during the day,
or at 911 in the evening.

A meeting is planned for noon to

persons interested in formulating a

interested faculty, staff and students

any information on the attacks to call
the police at 497-3444 during the day,

Following Tuesday evening's rape
of a Stanford student near Memorial
Church — the second attack in one
week — campus police are issuing
serious warnings and advice to wom
en on campus, as well as pursuing a
full-scale investigation aided by a
possible description of the rapist.
However disturbing, "a little fear is
good right now," one of the police
officers heading the investigation
said yesterday, "at least until we
catch this kook."
Tuesday's victim, a Stanford stu
dent living on campus, was attacked
from behind and dragged into
nearby bushes between 6:30 and 7
p.m. She was walking alone near the
south side of Memorial Church. Be
cause her eyes were covered, the
young woman was unable to de
scribe her attacker, although she told

police she thought there may have
been more than one.
Meanwhile, police think two at
tempted rapes reported in the past
few days may be linked to last Thurs
day's rape of a jogger in the vicinity of
Stanford stadium.
The assailant in Thursday's rape is
described as a black male adult, be
tween 18 and 20 years old, with a
muscular build. He stands about five
foot ten inches tall and has a short,
afro-style haircut.
After learning of last Thursday's
rape, a bicyclist reported to police
that she had been accosted about 20
minutes before the incident by
someone fitting the above descrip
tion. Friday night, a woman with an
injured foot sitting on a bench in the
library area was approached by
someone also roughly fitting the as
sailant's description, the police re-

'A little fear is good right now'

port said. He offered to accompany
her as she walked toward Tresidder
Union and she agreed. When they
got to Building 610, he shoved her
against a wall and said he was going
to rape her — she pushed him away
and threatened to scream and then
he ran off.
"We're running special foot pa
trols in plain clothes in an attempt to
catch this attacker," Herrington said.
"It's very important to report an at
tack right away," said Detective
Kathy Miller who is working on the
investigation.
"The sooner it's reported, the

sooner we can get officers to the
scene to help the victim. When you
call the emergency (911) number, the
dispatchers know the questions to
ask and get a description," ma'king it
easier for the police to be on the
lookout for the assailant.
Miller said that callers are some
times dismayed by the fact that they
are asked a lot of questions by dis
patchers. "What people don't under
stand is that dispatchers get police
cars rolling into the area immediately
and they are talking to police while
they are talking to you," she said.
Immediate notification also helps

in the prosecution of suspects later
on. Miller advised victims, despite
the possible unpleasantness, to call
the police immediately after the at
tack and not wait to go home. She
also said that rape victims should not
change their clothes immediately af
ter the attack because the rapist's
body secretions and body hair are
often still present in the clothing and
are very important pieces of evi
dence to be used later.
"Go right to a phone and call the
police, that would be my first
thought," Miller said. "I know that if I
had not had the rape awareness train

ing I might go home, too, but it's very
important that you call the police
right away."
Miller acknowledged that the
trauma of the rape and the per
ceptions about the way rape victims
are treated by the police often dis
suade victims from making this im
mediate contact. However, Miller
further explained that recent
changes in rape laws regarding the
way victims are treated should re
duce the fear associated with report
ing a rape and testifying against an at
tacker.
"(The victim) is not under police
custody, we are there to help her"
she said.
The usual process following
notification of the police that one has
been raped usually proceeds in this
way: The woman is taken to the hos
pital for medical treatment and an
examination if she agrees. Miller said
that physicians are well-trained as to
how to deal with rape victims. Police
officers no longer stand by during
the medical treatment or examina
tion, said Miller, "unlike the old days
when the victim had to go through
this humiliating experience only to
have to go through an examination in
front of police officers — and in the
days when they were all men." Fol
lowing the examination, the victim is
questioned by police, then the wom
an is usually advised to see a counsel
or, such as those available at the
Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices Center (CAPS).
