# Mobutu in Zaire
## 
### Washington Post 
Kinshasa, Zaire — Spreading signs of
resistance and popular anger directed
at the autocratic rule of President
Mobutu Sese Seko are increasing ap
prehension within the Western diplo
matic community about the future of
U.S. influence in this strategic and min
eral-rich central African country.
The American government's close
identification with the apparently shaky
one-man rule of Mobutu has made U.S.
interests hostage to his fate, American
diplomats grudgingly concede.
They have been obliged to report
back to Washington that in the past five
weeks Mobutu's troops have rounded
up several thousand unemployed
youths in Kinshasa's slums in a wide
ranging security operation that reflecfs
Mobutu's mounting insecurity.
But the sweep of the youths, who are
seen as the potential shock troops of
any civilian uprising against Mobutu,
quickly degenerated "into a
shakedown operation by the soldiers,"
said one diplomatic source in Washing
ton with access to the reports.
This apparently self-defeating opera
tion, which has increased rather than
reduced tensions, illustrates perhaps
the most serious problem facing
Mobutu — he is dependent on the mili
tary to stay in power, but that military,
despite extensive support from outside
powers, is an uncertain base of support.

In the face of this situation, Belgium,
the former colonial power here, and
France have indicated they want to put
more distance between Mobutu and
themselves. But the Reagan adminis
tration is asking congressional approval
of "a substantial increase" in what had
been declining U.S. military assistance
for Zaire.
In Washington one State Department
official who has been intimately in
volved in U.S. policy toward Zaire con
firmed the Reagan administration's de
sire "to significantly increase military
aid" to Mobutu.
Mobutu called on the army to put
down rumblings of discontent in Au
gust as well, ordering the major govern
ment buildings in downtown Kinshasa
surrounded by the French-trained
Zairean paratroops. American
diplomats here saw this as an ex
travagent display of force. It went on for
several weeks.
These actions have come against a
background of economic troubles for
this potentially prosperous country. In
june, a 67 percent devaluation of the
country's currency boosted inflation
temporarily from 55 percent annually to
85 percent, while wages remained
static. 1 he vast majority of Zaire's 28 mil
lion citirens already exist on a bare sub
sistence level.
A disconcerting event for Mobutu

earlier this year was the flight to exile in
Belgium of former Zairian prime min
ister Nguza Karl-i-Bond. Before leaving
in April, Nguza had been the Western
governments' hope for Zaire develop
ing a democratic government with less
corruption. Since publicly calling for
Mobutu's overthrow in Brussels and
Washington, Nguza has lost the open
support he once received from U.S. and
Western European governments.
Western analysts and even one of
Mobutu's advisors believe that an up
heaval is a daily possibility here. "It
would only take a spark, I agree," the
advisor said.
"It is one of the few tools we have to
exercise any leverage with the Zairians
to get them to reform their govern
ment," lie said.
The administration's recent request
for $10.5 million in military aid to Zaiie
for fiscal 1982 passed the Senate intact.
But it has been cut to $4 million by a
House subcommittee on Africa.
The United States has been seen as
Mobutu's major supporter since he
came to power in a Nov. 24, 1965, army
coup that was partly planned and fully
sponsored by the Central Intelligence
Agency.
The Reagan administration considers
Zaire of "central strategic importance"
to U.S. foreign policy objectives in
Africa, U.S. officials say.
