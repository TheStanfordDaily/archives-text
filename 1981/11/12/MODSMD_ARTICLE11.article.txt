## Wallace Stegner speaks this evening in Palo Alto 
### Gale Warner 
"What a young American just coming of age
confronts now is not a limitless potential, but de
veloped power attended by destruction and
depletion. Though we should have recognized
the land as a living organism demanding care
and stewardship, we have treated it as a ware
house, and now it is a warehouse half-emptied,"
wrote Wallace Stegner, emeritus professor of
English and former creative writing director it
Stanford.
Stegner and his son Page, professor u 1
at UC-Santa Cruz, will give a public reading fr<,.n
their latest book, American Places, tonight at
Gunn High School in Palo Alto.
To those who know the senior Stegner chiefly
by his short stories and novels, such as the
Pulitzer Prize-winning Angle of Repose and The
Spectator Bird, winner of the 1977 National Book
Award, the tone of this book may come as some
thing of a shock.
"I didn't intend it to sound hopeless, but I did
mean it to be critical," said Stegner during a re
cent interview in his hilltop home behind Stan
ford, where he has lived for 32 years.
"The book is a kind of celebration of the good
natural life, the good earth. It is also a lament for
what we've done to that," he said. "It is critical of
the industrial nation uncontrolled by humane
values."
A product of 12 years of collaboration with his
son and photographer Eliot Porter, the book
treats selected areas of the United States on a
personal level, with most chapters written as
narrative essays.
Though a diversity of "places" are covered, in
cluding Utah, Vermont, Nebraska, the Mississip
pi Valley, and the California coast, western
scenes predominate. No attempt was made to
record geographical areas equally, and no large
cities were included.
How Americans have interacted with each of
these places is a recurring theme. "The record is
very clear — there has never been so wasteful
and careless a civilization as ours, particularly in
our relationship to the land. We are still in a pat
tern of spoil, of carelessness of consequence,''
explained Stegner.

He described the present treatment of the en
vironment as "a form of fouling your own nest
that's hard to understand."
But it's not too late for change, he said. "There
have been some very strong, sincere people
here at Stanford working to raise our environ
mental consciousness. That kind of person
didn't exist 25 years ago. All you had then were
some members of mountain clubs, who by and
large didn't have the philosophical backing of
Thoreau or an awareness of how the web fits to
gether.
"That awareness has been here at Stanford,
and now it's coming on at other places," he said.
Education about the environment, particular
ly of people in influential business positions
"where the power to destroy and to save exists"
will be the key, according to Stegner.
"It could be this is the time of hope rather than
a time of gloom. But it took a lot of changes of
mind. When I was your age, nobody ever
thought about the environment — we took it for
granted," he said.
"It isn't going to be easy for your generation.
Vou have lined up against you a lot of money and
power. But if you don't fight, you're not going to
save anything," he warned.
How does Stegner view his own role in bring
ing about this change?
"It never hurts to put things in print," he said
with a smile. "If you didn't think you could have
an impact, you wouldn't try.
"A certain indignation is behind all of it,"he
continued. "I grew up on the frontier, where we
were just killing things all the time. It took me a
while to realize how obnoxious that was. We
tend to outrageously destroy other forms of life,
and I got sick of that. I guess that's why I started
writing environmental pieces."
Such writing has sometimes conflicted with
other obligations and projects, he admitted. "It
was always something I did with some resent
ment, because I was so busy doing other things.
But I obviously couldn't stay out of it, and I'm
very glad I didn't."
He laughed, "I'm supposed to be writing a
novel this year, but thanks to Mr. Watt, I've been
writing environmental pieces instead."
"What a young American just coming of age

our relationship to the land. We are still in a pat
tern of spoil, of carelessness of consequence,''
explained Stegner.

He described the present treatment of the en
vironment as "a form of fouling your own nest
that's hard to understand."
But it's not too late for change, he said. "There
have been some very strong, sincere people
here at Stanford working to raise our environ
mental consciousness. That kind of person
didn't exist 25 years ago. All you had then were
some members of mountain clubs, who by and
large didn't have the philosophical backing of
Thoreau or an awareness of how the web fits to
gether.
"That awareness has been here at Stanford,
and now it's coming on at other places," he said.
Education about the environment, particular
ly of people in influential business positions
"where the power to destroy and to save exists"
will be the key, according to Stegner.
"It could be this is the time of hope rather than
a time of gloom. But it took a lot of changes of
mind. When I was your age, nobody ever
thought about the environment — we took it for
granted," he said.
"It isn't going to be easy for your generation.
Vou have lined up against you a lot of money and
power. But if you don't fight, you're not going to
save anything," he warned.
How does Stegner view his own role in bring
ing about this change?
"It never hurts to put things in print," he said
with a smile. "If you didn't think you could have
an impact, you wouldn't try.
"A certain indignation is behind all of it,"he
continued. "I grew up on the frontier, where we
were just killing things all the time. It took me a
while to realize how obnoxious that was. We
tend to outrageously destroy other forms of life,
and I got sick of that. I guess that's why I started
writing environmental pieces."
Such writing has sometimes conflicted with
other obligations and projects, he admitted. "It
was always something I did with some resent
ment, because I was so busy doing other things.
But I obviously couldn't stay out of it, and I'm
very glad I didn't."
He laughed, "I'm supposed to be writing a
novel this year, but thanks to Mr. Watt, I've been
writing environmental pieces instead."
"What a young American just coming of age
confronts now is not a limitless potential, but de
veloped power attended by destruction and
depletion. Though we should have recognized
the land as a living organism demanding care
and stewardship, we have treated it as a ware
house, and now it is a warehouse half-emptied,"
wrote Wallace Stegner, emeritus professor of
English and former creative writing director it
Stanford.
Stegner and his son Page, professor u 1
at UC-Santa Cruz, will give a public reading fr<,.n
their latest book, American Places, tonight at
Gunn High School in Palo Alto.
To those who know the senior Stegner chiefly
by his short stories and novels, such as the
Pulitzer Prize-winning Angle of Repose and The
Spectator Bird, winner of the 1977 National Book
Award, the tone of this book may come as some
thing of a shock.
"I didn't intend it to sound hopeless, but I did
mean it to be critical," said Stegner during a re
cent interview in his hilltop home behind Stan
ford, where he has lived for 32 years.
"The book is a kind of celebration of the good
natural life, the good earth. It is also a lament for
what we've done to that," he said. "It is critical of
the industrial nation uncontrolled by humane
values."
A product of 12 years of collaboration with his
son and photographer Eliot Porter, the book
treats selected areas of the United States on a
personal level, with most chapters written as
narrative essays.
Though a diversity of "places" are covered, in
cluding Utah, Vermont, Nebraska, the Mississip
pi Valley, and the California coast, western
scenes predominate. No attempt was made to
record geographical areas equally, and no large
cities were included.
How Americans have interacted with each of
these places is a recurring theme. "The record is
very clear — there has never been so wasteful
and careless a civilization as ours, particularly in
our relationship to the land. We are still in a pat
tern of spoil, of carelessness of consequence,''
explained Stegner.

He described the present treatment of the en
vironment as "a form of fouling your own nest
that's hard to understand."
