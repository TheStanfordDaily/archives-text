# Vietnam POW directing Peace Corps
## 
### Brad Crystal 
TFie Peace Corps was just about four
years old whenEverett Alvarez'saircraft
went down over Noith Vietnam on Au
gust 5, 1964.
Alvarez was not to know freedom for
another eight-and-a-half years, making
him the longest held prisoner of war
during the Vietnam conflict.
Today, Alvarez, 44, is deputy director
of the Peace Corps, an organization
which has matured almost as much as
he has in the 20 years since it was
founded. Alvaiez was on campus last
week to speak at a conference of re
turned Peace Corps volunteers.
Though memories of the war have
left an indelible mark on Alvarez'sout
look, he refuses to preoccupy himself
with the past.
"You could look at that experience
and be very bitter about losing a large
portion of your life . . . you could walk
around for the rest of your life with a
real chip on your shoulder, but re
alistically what good would you be to
yourself, to your family or to your com
munity . . . you've got to press on," he
said.
And so he does. As if his work at the
Peace Corps and the family duties of a
wife and two children aren't enough to
keep him occupied, Alvarez is working
toward his law degree at George Wash
ington University night school.
Though he acknowledges the read
justment problems encountered by
some Vietnam veterans upon their re
turn to American society, Alvarez
criticizes the news media for exaggerat
ing the image of the troubled veteran.
"The vast majority (of veterans) got
right back into everyday life, returning
to school or jobs, but you don't hear
about that, you hear about the drug ad
dict and the derelict," he said. "The
Vietnam veteran has been portrayed in
this manner, and I think it's unfair."
In his new post at the Peace Corps, a
volunteer government agency com
prised of some 5400 volunteers in 58 pr i
marily Third World countries, Alvarez
appears just as concerned about com
municating a positive perception.
"What the Peace Corps has failed to
do is to tell the Peace Corps story. . .the
success story of what's happened . . .
and I think that'sone thing that has to be
done," he said.
And just what is that success story?
Alvarez speaks highly of the Peace
Corps' role in "promoting friendship
and helping people to work on a per-

son-to-person level." The agency em
phasizes the "helping hand" rather
than the "handout" approach, he ex
plained, and in so doing helps the peo
ple of the Third World help themselves.
"It's the old problem ... if you give a
man a fish today, he' II be hungry
tomorrow . . . teach a man how to fish
today and he won't be hungry," said
Alvarez, echoing the words of President
Ronald Reagan.
The philosophy of the Peace Corps is
very much in keeping with the views ex
pressed by President Reagan at the
North-South summit meeting in Can
cun last month, says Alvarez.
"We are reaching out to the private
sector," he said, in an effort to teach
management and marketing skills.

But Reagan's emphasis on the private
sector may be a double edged sword;
the paring down of government agen
cies could lead to cutbacks in the Peace
Corps.
Depite the trend of fiscal austerity,
Alvarez remains hopeful. "At this point
we don't know where we are going to
wind up, but we are prepared to carry
out the programs either way," he said.
He conceded, however, that if next
year's appropriation is less than the $105
million spent last year, some cutbacks
would have to be made. "The big prob
lem we have to face today is how to ap
proach these things using the most cost
effective means and achieving per
manent results."
Turning to individual Peace Corps
volunteers themselves, Alvarez said a
candidate should be someone who is
"really motivated," who is prepared to
live in relative isolation often in poor,

remote villages. Volunteers usually
serve a two-and-a-half year term.
"The two key requirements are good
health and if not previous knowledge of
a foreign language then the willingness
and ability to learn a new language," he
said.
Age is certainly no barrier; in fact,
more than 350 Peace Corps volunteers
are over 60. Alvarez citcd the example
of the oldest volunteer, a 79-year-old
man who has been working for the
Peace Corps in Africa for the past 15
years.
"In many cases the response of the
host countries has been very positive
when we have had older volunteers
in many of those cultures there is a great
deal of respect for the older person,"
Alvarez said.
A basic rule is that volunteers refrain
from participating in local politics. "In
the past, Peace Corps volunteers have
gotten involved in local political ac
tivites and this has damaged their ef
forts, and in some cases they were asked
to leave."
Politics can also create problems for
volunteers when a developing country
is experiencing revolution or guerilla
warfare. "The safety of the volunteer is
paramount," says Alvarez, noting that
volunteers sometimes have to be pulled
out of a country when political up
heaval jeopardizes their lives. Such was
the case recently in El Salvador and
Nicaragua; agency officials are closely
monitoring the situation in Guatemala.
The Peace Corps has had what
Alvarez calls "some rough times" dur
ing the past 20 years, and the number of
volunteers is greatly down from the
15,000 who served at its peak in 1966
But the forces of poverty and need
which inspired the creation of the
Peace Corps have not diminished.
"The needs of the Third World are
greater today than ever before," said
Alvarez. "For many people every day is
a matter of survival. Half a billion peo
ple in the world today are starving."
Alvarez cites the interdependence
which characterizes world relations as
one of the key reasons to keep the
Peace Corps strong.
"We're linked a lot more closely to
the Third World Countries today than
20 years ago both economically and po
litically. Our need for their raw materi
als and their need for our technology
and manufacturing processes has
helped to bring us together."

another eight-and-a-half years, making
him the longest held prisoner of war
during the Vietnam conflict.
Today, Alvarez, 44, is deputy director
of the Peace Corps, an organization
which has matured almost as much as
he has in the 20 years since it was
founded. Alvaiez was on campus last
week to speak at a conference of re
turned Peace Corps volunteers.
Though memories of the war have
left an indelible mark on Alvarez'sout
look, he refuses to preoccupy himself
with the past.
"You could look at that experience
and be very bitter about losing a large
portion of your life . . . you could walk
around for the rest of your life with a
real chip on your shoulder, but re
alistically what good would you be to
yourself, to your family or to your com
munity . . . you've got to press on," he
said.
And so he does. As if his work at the
Peace Corps and the family duties of a
wife and two children aren't enough to
keep him occupied, Alvarez is working
toward his law degree at George Wash
ington University night school.
Though he acknowledges the read
justment problems encountered by
some Vietnam veterans upon their re
turn to American society, Alvarez
criticizes the news media for exaggerat
ing the image of the troubled veteran.
"The vast majority (of veterans) got
right back into everyday life, returning
to school or jobs, but you don't hear
about that, you hear about the drug ad
dict and the derelict," he said. "The
Vietnam veteran has been portrayed in
this manner, and I think it's unfair."
In his new post at the Peace Corps, a
volunteer government agency com
prised of some 5400 volunteers in 58 pr i
marily Third World countries, Alvarez
appears just as concerned about com
municating a positive perception.
"What the Peace Corps has failed to
do is to tell the Peace Corps story. . .the
success story of what's happened . . .
and I think that'sone thing that has to be
done," he said.
And just what is that success story?
Alvarez speaks highly of the Peace
Corps' role in "promoting friendship
and helping people to work on a per-

son-to-person level." The agency em
phasizes the "helping hand" rather
than the "handout" approach, he ex
plained, and in so doing helps the peo
ple of the Third World help themselves.
"It's the old problem ... if you give a
man a fish today, he' II be hungry
tomorrow . . . teach a man how to fish
today and he won't be hungry," said
Alvarez, echoing the words of President
Ronald Reagan.
The philosophy of the Peace Corps is
very much in keeping with the views ex
pressed by President Reagan at the
North-South summit meeting in Can
cun last month, says Alvarez.
"We are reaching out to the private
sector," he said, in an effort to teach
management and marketing skills.

But Reagan's emphasis on the private
sector may be a double edged sword;
the paring down of government agen
cies could lead to cutbacks in the Peace
Corps.
Depite the trend of fiscal austerity,
Alvarez remains hopeful. "At this point
we don't know where we are going to
wind up, but we are prepared to carry
out the programs either way," he said.
He conceded, however, that if next
year's appropriation is less than the $105
million spent last year, some cutbacks
would have to be made. "The big prob
lem we have to face today is how to ap
proach these things using the most cost
effective means and achieving per
manent results."
Turning to individual Peace Corps
volunteers themselves, Alvarez said a
candidate should be someone who is
"really motivated," who is prepared to
live in relative isolation often in poor,

remote villages. Volunteers usually
serve a two-and-a-half year term.
"The two key requirements are good
health and if not previous knowledge of
a foreign language then the willingness
and ability to learn a new language," he
said.
Age is certainly no barrier; in fact,
more than 350 Peace Corps volunteers
are over 60. Alvarez citcd the example
of the oldest volunteer, a 79-year-old
man who has been working for the
Peace Corps in Africa for the past 15
years.
"In many cases the response of the
host countries has been very positive
when we have had older volunteers
in many of those cultures there is a great
deal of respect for the older person,"
Alvarez said.
A basic rule is that volunteers refrain
from participating in local politics. "In
the past, Peace Corps volunteers have
gotten involved in local political ac
tivites and this has damaged their ef
forts, and in some cases they were asked
to leave."
Politics can also create problems for
volunteers when a developing country
is experiencing revolution or guerilla
warfare. "The safety of the volunteer is
paramount," says Alvarez, noting that
volunteers sometimes have to be pulled
out of a country when political up
heaval jeopardizes their lives. Such was
the case recently in El Salvador and
Nicaragua; agency officials are closely
monitoring the situation in Guatemala.
The Peace Corps has had what
Alvarez calls "some rough times" dur
ing the past 20 years, and the number of
volunteers is greatly down from the
15,000 who served at its peak in 1966
But the forces of poverty and need
which inspired the creation of the
Peace Corps have not diminished.
"The needs of the Third World are
greater today than ever before," said
Alvarez. "For many people every day is
a matter of survival. Half a billion peo
ple in the world today are starving."
Alvarez cites the interdependence
which characterizes world relations as
one of the key reasons to keep the
Peace Corps strong.
"We're linked a lot more closely to
the Third World Countries today than
20 years ago both economically and po
litically. Our need for their raw materi
als and their need for our technology
and manufacturing processes has
helped to bring us together."
