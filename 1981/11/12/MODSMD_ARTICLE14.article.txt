## Viewpoint/Joe Walder Military research on the rise 
### 
The sub-basement of the Mitchell
Earth Sciences Building seems an odd
place for research funded by the
Navy's anti-submarine warfare pro
gram It probably is not obvious to
most people here that the National
Security Agency, the cream of this
country's electronic spy network,
funds researchers in the Electrical En
gineering department.
In fact, Stanford has hardly been
reticent about queueing up at the
Penatagon's door. In fiscal year 1980,
the University received over $18 mil
lion in military research funds, a fig
ure exceeded by only four other
schools, according to the Depart
ment of Defense (DOD). Two of
those institutions (Johns Hopkins and
Mil) each received more thai) $150
million.
Military funding of academics rose
noticeably during the Carter years,
and the Reagan administration has
accelerated this trend. According to
an analysis by the Office of Man
agement and Budget, the DOD's
share of academic research expen
ditures in fiscal year 1982 will be 13
percent. Science reports that "data in
the mid-1970's showed that DOD
provided about 60 percent of the
funds for academic research in elec
tronics, 33 percent in aeronautics,
and 30 percent in computers."
It is obvious that the military has a
considerable influence on the direc
tion of academic research, amount
ing to near-control in some fields.
With federal funding of research
through the National Science Foun
dation and other agencies on the de
cline, this influence will undoubtedly
grow.
During the Vietnam War era, vig
orous protests by students and facul
tvalikeledtoa decline in the military
presence on campuses. Many uni
versities forbade classified research
or contracts that prohibited publica

tion of findings. The response tosut It
policies was cynical in the extreme;
as detailed in the June issue of 7/ie
Progressive, those researchers af
fected simply moved their classified
work off-campus, becoming private
consultants to the Pentagon.
Another subterfuge used by aca
demic researchers to avoid the ap
pearance of doing weapons research
is purely semantic: they cloak re
search proposals in technical jargon.
The Progressive gives an example of
an Air Force contract involving ICBM
nose-cone improvements; the
Princeton University scientists writ
ing the proposal described the work
as an investigation into "high-speed
airflow at three times the speed of
sound over the tip of an ogive
cylinder."
The Pentagon does its utmost to
calm researchers concerned
about the ethical aspects of weapons
research and development. Scientists
and engineers are urged to view their
work as pure research. \ DOD Office
of Research brochure maintains that
"it is theresponsibility of the scientific
program managers, not the re
searchers, to decide on the ap
plicability of a particular research
project. The foremost criterion in
selecting a proposal is the quality of
its scientific content."
T he Pentagon's goal of assuring the
political payability of its research
funding is achieved in other ways,
too. Projects mav be divided into bits,
with scholars from many institutions
participating. This scheme tends to
mask the overall military goal. Co
sponsorship with civilian agencies,
such as the National Science Founda
tion, also hides weapons reseaich
and development.
The necessity for scientists and en
gineers to recognize the ethical im
plications of military research is ur
gent. The arms race has certainly

been accelerated by scholars blinded
by their fascination with technical
problems and oblivious to laiger, so
cial issues, a self-propelling state of
affairs described by SLAC director
Wolfgang Panofsky as the "techno
logical imperative." Writing in 7/ie
tiulletiii of the Atomic Scientists, Pan
ofskv maintains that "the strategically
destabilizing influence of high ac
curacy of ballistic" missiles is a case in
point."
Frank Barnaby, director of the
Stockholm International Peace Re
search Institute, comments in the
same magazine that anti-submarine
warfare developments have also
been destabilizing. These technolog
ical 'marvels' have drastically in
creased the vulnerability of strategic
weapons, thereby striking at the
heart of policies of nuclear de
terrence. When nuclear weapons be
come vulnerable, the temptation to
use them in a crisis, lest the other side
attack first, is drastically increased.
Is it likely that we will see a moral
awakening in the technical com
munity to the dangers of doing mili
tary research? Probably not. Econom
ic hard times have caused re
searchers to turn inward more than
ever; maintaining the flow of dollars,
from whatever source, seems to be
the paramount objective of adminis
trators at department and university
levels.
Industrial recruiters tempt engi
neering students with "exciting new
piojects" such as the "advanced at
tack helicopter," to quote a Hughes
Helicopter advertisement that ap
peared in the Daily at the time of this
year's Job Faire. Those aspiring engi
neers may find jobs in which "ability,
initiative and enthusiasm is recog
nized and rewarded" . . . but they
w ill never see the blood flowing.
