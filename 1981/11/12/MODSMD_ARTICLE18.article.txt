## EPA chief: reckless operator 
### 
Washington — "Calling all cars: Anne Gorsuch has
taken a wrong turn. 1 he 39 year-old chief of the Environ
mental Protection Agency (EPA), who possesses the keys
to the nation's ecological patrol car, is believed to be
heading fora cliff. Keep >our eyes peeled."
While no such bulletin has been flashed to state high
way patrols, Anne Gorsuch may soon be charged with
reckless operation of the Ef'A here.
Only six months after taking office, the Colorado law
yer has helped execute paitner James Watt's environ
mental counter-revolution with the singlemindedness
of a robot. She's virtually immobilized EPA's work force
of 12,000 and wants to c ut agency staff and funding more
severely than her idol, budget director Dave Stockman,
has proposed.
With oideis fiom Watt to slow down the nation's en
vironmental legulatory machinery, Goisuch will need all
the grease, charm and savvy she can muster.
It hasn't taken long for Gotsuch to alienate many peo
ple who matter in this town. I ler arrogant performances
before congressional panels have fueled speculation
about what she's trying to prove. Already, she's one of
two Reagan appointees who's been told by a U.S. senator
to consider resignation.
What's wrong with the No. 2 woman in the male-dom
inated Reagan administration? Anne Goisuch, un
fortunately, seems more obsessed with administrative
perfection than environmental advocacy. Like many am
bitious people, she's won praise from her superiors but
lost sight of her real responsibilities.
Of course, Anne Gorsuch is no dummy. After gradu
ating from the University of Colorado Law School in
1964, she passed the bar exam at age 21. I he daughter of
a physician, she used a hard-to get Fulbright Scholarship
to teach English in India fora year.
Once back in Denver, Gorsuch moved through vari
ous jobs honing her administrative skills and ability to
carry out orders. It appears an indiscretion fueled by zeal
cost her a job at the Derwer district attorney's office in
1971. But in 1975, she accepted a legal position with
Mountain Bell Telephone that she knew would not in
terfere with her plans to run for the state legislature. She
was elected the following year.
In the meantime, she married into an old Colorado
family. The marriage produced three children (ages
eight, 10 and 13 anil trot mentioned in her resume)
before it ended in separation.
Although she earned legislative credentials on en
vironmental matters in Denver, Gorsuch arrived in
Washington with little L>jc kground in the tec hnical de
tails of environmental management. She boned up on
acronyms, clean-up costs and local emission standards
for weeks befoie her Senate confirmation. But environ
mental expertise has never been her passion.
Instead of skillfully protecting and preserving Ameri

ca's air and water, Gorsuch has jeopardized the agency's
future by revealing a contempt for her fellow bureau
crats within EPA.
Gotsuch lules EPA today with a sextet of former in
dustry lawyers and public relations types. Two top«EPA
officials President Ronald Reagan appointed have al
ready resigned and morale is at an all-time low. But
Gorsuch doesn't seem to fear the distant charges of ir
responsibility.
Sadly enough, she only becomes defensive in in
teiviews and congressional hearings when questioned
about agency specifics and direction. She often resorts to
condescension, evasion and cold stares — obviously no
way to make friends here or anywhere else. And now
she's demanding three weeks' notice before any future
Capitol Hill appearances.

Only six months after taking
office, the Colorado lawyer has
helped execute partner fames
Watt's environmental
counterrevolution with the
singlemindedness of a robot.

Even that household name, James Watt, has avoided
appearing blatantly uncooperative. Public criticism and
one million signatures calling for his resignation have
not stopped him from being straightforward and con
genial, as a matter ot survival.
But Gorsuch has undermined her effectiveness with a
less conciliatory tack.
"Sometimes it's important to give a new person like
Gorsuch a chance," moaned a senior Republican aide to
the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.
"They might be in trouble because they don't have the
time or are just overwhelmed. But our abysmal rela
tionship with EPA today has created a moral, legal and
economic nightmare."
It's too early to say whether EPA or Gorsuch will sur
vive each other. After all, turning one's back on rules and
regulations is certainly in vogue here these days.
But as long as Americans of varying ideological stripes
show strong support fora cleaner environment, Gorsuch
remains accountable for upholding the law of the land —
something she so far has neglected to do.
