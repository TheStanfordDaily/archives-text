Disease carriers need abortion option

The slab-mindedness of anti-abor
tionists like Michael Olvera frightens
me, (Daily, Nov. 10). Wouldn't it be
nice if the world was really as simple
as he thinks it is?
I would suggest that Olvera con
sider the following:
There is a genetic disease called
Tay-Sachs that usually, but not
always, strikes Jews of European an
cestry. Children affected by Tay-
Sachs rarely live beyond the age of
five. They are severely retarded and
eventually die in unrelieved agony.
Familes that bore Tay-Sachs babies, if
they survived the experience asfarni
lies, larely dared to have inoie chil
dren.
Thiee things changed that picture.
First, carriers of the genes-for Tay-
Sachs can now be identified by a
simple blood test. Second, fetuses af
fected by the disease can be spotted
through amniocentesis. Third, the
population group involved does not
share Olvera's strange idea of molal
ity.
According to a recent study at
UCLA (Science News, Oct. 31, 1981)
400,000 Americans have been
screened for Tay-Sachs since 1970.
Five thousand carriers have been
identified, 350 families have been
found to be at risk (it takes two car
riers to produce a Tay-Sachs baby).
More than 1000 pregnancies have
been monitored, and 250 fetuses
abot led.
The study found that 800 healthy
children have been born to those at
risk families. In almost every case the
pregnancies have been carried to
term without the Tay-Sachs detec

tion system and the security of the
abortion option. That means a total
net gain for-the human race of 550.
Is it Overa's opinion that those 250
aborted fetuses were deprived of
some God-given right when they
were denied a short terrible life? And
those 800 new souls among us who
aie alive and healthy in, loving
homes, do they have tights? When a
family is confronted with an
avoidable risk of calamity, who is to
decide if they are to take that risk, the
family or the government?
If the Match Amendment passes, if
Congress (lies in the face of over
whelming scientific opinion and
passes the Helms act, if the moral
busybodies like Olvera succeed in
imposing their standards on ev
erybody else, families facing lay-
Sachs or a score of other genetic dis
eases will be forced to choose be
tween risking tragedy, avoiding chil
dren altogether, or seeking illrg.il
abortions.
Now who is pro-life? Note quite so
simple, is it?

Story 'sensationalistic'
We weie disturbed by the sensal
- nature of the lead .illi< Ie
on Tuesday (Daily, Nov. 10), which
refened to the events preceding the
fatal car accident of October 30.
First, while we question the bear
ing the events had on the accident at
all, their being reported 11 days later
underscores their insignificance. 1 lie

article does nothing to establish or
diminish possible culpability for the
accident.
Second, the incident at Encina is
used to introduce the subject of card
ing procedures on campus. As Encina
was closed at the time, the ages of the
students did not become an issue.
While the accident has caused
heightened consideration of campus
drinking regulations, the important
points discussed in the second half of
the article do not follow from the
events reported in the first.
Finally, on a strictly personal note,
we find it sad that the memories of
these young men have been ex
ploited in older to piovide a more
sensational story.

Strange analysis
It seems as if everything Joe Walder
has written lately is American
diatribe or excuses and sympathy for
Soviet ideas and actions.
lake Walder's letter (Daily, Nov. 6)
about George Duca's commentary
(Daily, Nov. 2) for instance. I read a
commentary recounting a meeting
with five Rumanians who rather
emotionally talkecJ about life in a So
viet puppet state. Walder, however,
saw a "model fora trite morality
play" offering "precious little in
sight" into Rumanian or Eastern Eu
ropean problems. Strange analysis,
especially the last part, as the repres
sion discussed in the commentary is

their main problem! But then, he
often uses sarcasm to make the ob
ject of his attack appear ridiculously
misguided or foolishly simplistic.
Walder also ascribes statements to
writers who did not ever make them,
Walder then amazes us by saying
that the words Communist and Marx
ist-Leninist are "convenient little
buzz-words guaranteed to start a
true-blue American frothing at the
mouth." Those are totally valid words
to describe countries which are polit
ically the former, and ideologically
the latter. Rumania, indeed all of
Eastern Europe, fit both categories,
and should never be confused with
the concepts of democracy and per
sonal fieedom.
No, Communists don't eat babies,
but they do send nuclear armed subs
into neutral countries' top security
areas, commit genocide in several
countries alone or with surrogates,
openly support terrorist organiza
tions, dabble in chemical warfare,
and actively attempt to cut off min
eral and oil supplies to the western al
liance.
I don't think even Walder can
stretch his imagination so far as to
equate the insatiable appetite the So
viets have for world subjugation with
the policies of the U.S. toward other
countries. Come on, in a Communist
country one can't even write a letter
to the editor, much less one which
criticizes national policy. Only in
America can one so smugly bite the
hand that feeds him.

The study found that 800 healthy
children have been born to those at

pregnancies have been carried to

abortion option. That means a total
net gain for-the human race of 550.
Is it Overa's opinion that those 250
aborted fetuses were deprived of
some God-given right when they
were denied a short terrible life? And
those 800 new souls among us who
aie alive and healthy in, loving
homes, do they have tights? When a
family is confronted with an
avoidable risk of calamity, who is to
decide if they are to take that risk, the
family or the government?
If the Match Amendment passes, if
Congress (lies in the face of over
whelming scientific opinion and
passes the Helms act, if the moral
busybodies like Olvera succeed in
imposing their standards on ev
erybody else, families facing lay-
Sachs or a score of other genetic dis
eases will be forced to choose be
tween risking tragedy, avoiding chil
dren altogether, or seeking illrg.il
abortions.
Now who is pro-life? Note quite so
simple, is it?

Strange analysis
It seems as if everything Joe Walder
has written lately is American
diatribe or excuses and sympathy for
Soviet ideas and actions.
lake Walder's letter (Daily, Nov. 6)
about George Duca's commentary
(Daily, Nov. 2) for instance. I read a
commentary recounting a meeting
with five Rumanians who rather
emotionally talkecJ about life in a So
viet puppet state. Walder, however,
saw a "model fora trite morality
play" offering "precious little in
sight" into Rumanian or Eastern Eu
ropean problems. Strange analysis,
especially the last part, as the repres
sion discussed in the commentary is

their main problem! But then, he
often uses sarcasm to make the ob
ject of his attack appear ridiculously
misguided or foolishly simplistic.
Walder also ascribes statements to
writers who did not ever make them,
Walder then amazes us by saying
that the words Communist and Marx
ist-Leninist are "convenient little
buzz-words guaranteed to start a
true-blue American frothing at the
mouth." Those are totally valid words
to describe countries which are polit
ically the former, and ideologically
the latter. Rumania, indeed all of
Eastern Europe, fit both categories,
and should never be confused with
the concepts of democracy and per
sonal fieedom.
No, Communists don't eat babies,
but they do send nuclear armed subs
into neutral countries' top security
areas, commit genocide in several
countries alone or with surrogates,
openly support terrorist organiza
tions, dabble in chemical warfare,
and actively attempt to cut off min
eral and oil supplies to the western al
liance.
I don't think even Walder can
stretch his imagination so far as to
equate the insatiable appetite the So
viets have for world subjugation with
the policies of the U.S. toward other
countries. Come on, in a Communist
country one can't even write a letter
to the editor, much less one which
criticizes national policy. Only in
America can one so smugly bite the
hand that feeds him.

Disease carriers need abortion option

The slab-mindedness of anti-abor
tionists like Michael Olvera frightens
me, (Daily, Nov. 10). Wouldn't it be
nice if the world was really as simple
as he thinks it is?
I would suggest that Olvera con
sider the following:
There is a genetic disease called
Tay-Sachs that usually, but not
always, strikes Jews of European an
cestry. Children affected by Tay-
Sachs rarely live beyond the age of
five. They are severely retarded and
eventually die in unrelieved agony.
Familes that bore Tay-Sachs babies, if
they survived the experience asfarni
lies, larely dared to have inoie chil
dren.
Thiee things changed that picture.
First, carriers of the genes-for Tay-
Sachs can now be identified by a
simple blood test. Second, fetuses af
fected by the disease can be spotted
through amniocentesis. Third, the
population group involved does not
share Olvera's strange idea of molal
ity.
According to a recent study at
UCLA (Science News, Oct. 31, 1981)
400,000 Americans have been
screened for Tay-Sachs since 1970.
Five thousand carriers have been
identified, 350 families have been
found to be at risk (it takes two car
riers to produce a Tay-Sachs baby).
More than 1000 pregnancies have
been monitored, and 250 fetuses
abot led.
The study found that 800 healthy
children have been born to those at
risk families. In almost every case the
pregnancies have been carried to
term without the Tay-Sachs detec

tion system and the security of the
abortion option. That means a total
net gain for-the human race of 550.
