# Art theft linked to tight security funds

The theft of two prints from the
Stanford Art Museum last week was a
result of ihe museum's severe lack of
funds for better security, according
to Museum Director Lorenz Eitner.
Though the Whistler etching and
Gaugin woodcut were recovered
and a suspect arrested less than 24
hours after the crime, the museum
would like to do everything it can af
ford to see that a similar incident
does not happen again.
But highly sophisticated, "burglar
proof" security systems "literally cost
millions of dollars," said Eitner. So if
art thefts at the museum ever got out
of hand, "We'd simply have to shut
down," he said.
The museum receives no special
funds from the University, relying in
stead on funds from the art depart
ment and donations from private
citizens. "The University is as sup
portive as it can be but it just does
not have the money," said Eitner.
However, he would not disclose
either the museum's total budget or
the amount of money it had set aside
specifically for security. "I'm embar
rassed" to disclose the figures, he
said.
Robert Beth, director of risk man
agement here agreed that the
museum needs better security, but
said that many other departments
need more funds too. "There are
$300 million worth of suggestions" to
improve this university, whether for
"more security or for the compliance
of codes â€” museum security is just
one of them," he said. And when
asked whether, in the wake of this re
cent theft attempt, the University
would improve museum security
soon, Beth said, "I doubt it."
As for private donations to help
beef up security, the prospect looks

bleak. "The least likely gift to a
museum is security," said Eitner.
Donor's "want to give money to
something they can actually see," he
said. Rarely do they give to a
museum's support system. As he ex
plained, "No one donates to a
'Charlie Jones Janitorial Fund'."
Though this was the first attempted
theft from the museum since 1975,
Eitner insisted, "we simply have to
have more guards." But with each
guard costing the museum approx
imately $20,000 the addition of new
guards is unlikely.
And in this recent attempt where
the two prints were removed from
the walls they were bolted to, the
museum is now devising ways to
fasten more securely paintings and
prints to the walls.
The museum is also in the process
of creating a standard routing of
steps to be taken in case of another
then, this standardized procedure
should help quicken the time be
tween realization that a crime has
been committed and notification of
the police, "possibly even catching
the criminal before he leaves the
building," said Eitner.
In this recent case, the missing
paintings were discovered 10-15
minutes after the crime was believed
to have been committed and police
arrived five minutes after being
called.
Still, Eitner admitted that it is
"almost impossible to totally pre
vent" art thefts when, as in the two
previous cases, professional art
thieves are involved.
But in spite of the museum's secur
ity problems, Raoul Niemeyer of the
Stanford police said that such prob
lems are not unique to the Stanford
Art Museum. Eitner agreed, citing
