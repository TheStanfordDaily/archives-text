## To return or not to return: the California bottle bill question 
### Claire van Schaik 
A statewide signature-gathering
campaign is currently underway in an
effort to put a "can and bottle bill"
on California's November 1982
ballot.
If the necessary 346,119 signatures
are gathered before March and the
bill is subsequently passed, a 5-cent
minimum refundable deposit will be
required on all of California's beer
and carbonated drink containers.
Californians Against Waste (CAW),
a citizens group sponsoring the bill,
claims that the bill will conserve
energy, natural resources, and water,
greatly cut down on litter and in
dustrial pollution, create jobs, and
save the consumer money.
Opponents of the bill, which in
clude some bottling companies and
major supermarket chains, claim that
the bill will greatly add to their ex
penses.
According to Felicia del Campo,
manager of corporate public rela
tions for Safeway, Inc., bottle bills
have created a lot of problems in the
states where they operate. Safeway
officials claim they have had to al
locate extra space for the returned
containers in those states which have
already passed bottle bills.
According to C.J. Keys, director of
marketing vice-president of Coca-
Cola, most stores don't have that
kind of space. "It's a ludicrous use of
valuable Californian space," he said.
Del Campo said that bottle bills
add to Safeway's costs in terms of
time, inconvenience and paperwork.

In del Campo's opinion the handling
fee will not be sufficient to cover
these additional costs.
Coca-Cola claims they will have in
creased sorting costs and will need
more trucks. According to Keys, the
bill is ecologically unsound because
the additional trucks will use more
gas. Spokesmen for both Coca-Cola
and Safeway say the costs are going to
have to be passed on to the con
sumer.
In contrast to this point of view,
however, a recently published study
by the California Public Interest Re
search Group (CaIPIRG) and the
Stanford Environmental Law Society
shows that with the exception of
Michigan, the average soft drink
price has gone down in all the states
which have bottle bills.
This study, as well as one by CAW,
is cited in support of the bill by a wide
variety of businesses and organiza
tions. These include The Los Angeles
Times, the Environmental Protection
Agency, Alcoa Aluminum Company,
Adolph, Coors, and major environ
mental groups.
CalPIRG's study is based on
statistics compiled from each of the
seven states that have already im
plemented a can and bottle bill. They
found that in each state, beverage
container litter has declined by ap
proximately 80 percent, 92 to 96 per
cent of all can and bottles are re
cycled, and because recycling and
re-use is labor intensive, jobs have
been created.
CAW's study shows a savings of tax

dollars that have been budgeted for
the pick-up and disposal of beverage
container litter in landfills. In Califor
nia savings could be considerable
since trash disposal is this state's sec
ond most costly municipal service,
according to CAW.
Industries have been able to save
money and energy by manufacturing
fewer new bottles. CaIPIRG also
claims that recycling aluminum leads
to a reduction in demand for im
ported bauxite needed to make vir
gin aluminum.
A reduction of both air and water
pollution could be anticipated. CAW
estimates that the beverage in
dustries' contribution to air pollution
would diminish by as much as 70 per
cent. Along the same lines, its con
tribution to water pollution would be
cut by 44 to 69 percent.
Water is also saved in a returnable
system, according to the study. A re
fillable bottle making 10 trips uses
less than half as much water as a
throwaway bottle.
The Los Angeles Times speaks for
all those in favor of the bill in saying
in a recent editorial, "The best reason
for deposit legislation is that it works
in the states that already have it on
the books. There has been a substan
tial decrease in litter and also a sub
stantial decrease in tax dollars spent
to clean it up."
The bill's opponents recognize
some of its benefits. Many of them,
however, feel the beverage industry
is being unfairly singled out. Del
Campo claimed that the bottle bill

puts the burden on only one section
of the solid waste contributors.
"It's a direct design against our
business," said Keys.
As an alternative to the bottle bill,
Safeway supports Comprehensive
Litter Laws. These laws, which ac
cording to del Campo already exist in

California, tax all contributors to lit
ter. The tax money is then used to
prevent littering and to encourage
recycling. Del Campo feels this is
more fair because it distributes the
cost of litter prevention to all in
volved.
At this point the bill's opponents
are not doing anything to prevent it

from getting on the November
ballot. However, should CAW gain
the necessary signatures, they will
put up a fight.
Del Campo said that Safeway has
no formulated plans but will act in
conjunction with the grocery in
dustry. Kevs said that Coca-Cola will

join with opponents in the beer and
soft drink industry to put up a major
front. "The industry will put up a
fight. We think it is wrong, dis
criminatory legislation," said Keys.
CAW also had nothing specific to
say about their plans should the bill
get on the ballot. According to Col
leen Beamish, CAW's San Mateo and

Santa Clara County coordinator,
right now they are concentrating
solely on gathering the necessary sig
natures.
Beamish foresees no major ob
stacles to getting the bill on the
ballot. "The bottle bill is an environ
mentally sound cause. We are confi
dent the people will put us on the
ballot," said Beamish.
Stanford senior Steve Lautze is co
ordinating CAW's efforts on the Stan
ford campus. Since Monday, Novem
ber 9, Lautze and other Stanford vol
unteers have been manning a table in
White Plaza. They will be there Mon
day through Friday from 9 a.m. to 2
p.m. for the next two weeks.
Beamish and Lautze had a trial run
for the table last week which was very
successful. As Beamish said, "It's a
good feeling when you get such
positive feedback from people."
There is evidence that widespread
public support of the bill exists. Re
cent studies show that approximately
83 percent of California's registered
voters are in favor of the can and bot
tle bill.
However, this sentiment has not
carried over to the California legisla
ture. Similar bills have been pro
posed every year since 1965. But spe
cial interest lobbying has prevented
the bill from making it outof commit
tee.
CAW thus decided to attempt the
bill through referendum. "We can
not keep up with the throwaway eth
ic," said Beamish. "This finally allows
the citizens to have a voice."
