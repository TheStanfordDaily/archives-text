# Water, water everywhere? Peripheral Canal debate goeson
## 
### Melanie Julian 
This June, a referendum will appear on the
statewide ballot containing one of the most
complex and drawn-out issues in California's
water history: the Peripheral Canal.
SB2OO, which passed the State Legislature
in 1980, will come before the voters as a mix
ed-package. It contains a 43-mile long, 400-
ft. wide canal; a passel of associated canals,
small dams, and pumping stations; and some
legal environmental safeguards such as
Proposition 8 (protecting north coast rivers)
and Delta water quality guarantees.
It also carries, although the ballot will not
mention it, a $7 to $20 billion price tag — the
variation depending on either assumed in
terest rates, cost time horizons, inclusion or
exclusion of energy costs, or who is making
the estimate.
The complexity of the Canal issue is only
surpassed by the controversy over it. Be
cause of the diverse values and interests
which are waging this battle, there is virtually
no "fact or figure" which is not bitterly dis
puted. Besides being a political scientists'
nightmare, this jumble of arguments is high
ly confusing to the public.
California's perennial water problems be
gin with the fact that its people and farms are
where the water isn't. For years the Federal
Bureau of Reclamation took it upon itself to
remedy this situation with a long series of
dams and diversions culminating in the Cen
tral Valley Project, completed in 1951. Its
Delta-Mendota Canal provides cheap water
to many San Joaquin Valley farms —
on a contingency, however, that receiving
farms be smaller than 160 acres.
This acre limitation was never well en
forced, but the large farming operations,
-fearing that it might, pushed fora stat/e run
project in the 19505. The result was the State
Water Project (SWP), which today delivers
three million acre-feet not only to the valley

but over the Tehachipi Mountains to Los An
geles.
The Peripheral Canal is a finishing touch of
the SWP. It would carry water from the
mouth of the Sacramento around the Delta
to the present SWP intake near Tracy. This
will increase total water flow southward, be

cause the present intake is limited when salt
water from the Bay flows backwards through
the Delta into the pumps.
The implications of the Peripheral Canal
are staggering. As planned, it would be the
largest, most expensive publics works
project in history, far outdoing the Alaska

Pipelineat $9 billion. It would bebiggerthan
the Suez Canal and could be seen from the
moon, according to the California League of
Voters (CLCV).
The key questions about its viability re
volve around econorrvc and environmental
considerations, with legal and technical
aspects playing a large role as well.
Fconomic Questions
The costs of the Peripheral Canal were de
leted from the current legislation. 58346 was
an earlier canal bill which failed to pass be
cause the financing clauses required a two
thirds vote.
Financing for SB2OO will be by state obligar
tion bonds, with approximately 70 percent of
the costs paid for by rate hikes to southern
California domestic users. The remainder
will be borne by taxpayers throughout the
state, according to the CLCV.
The benefits of the canal are controversial
both in their size and distribution. "There
are many powerful people who benefit from
having excess water sloshing around the sys
tem," Carl Pope of the Sierra Club said.
Since agriculture uses 85 percent of the
state's water, and since Los Angeles Metro
politan Water District virtually gives away its
surplus water to valley agri-business, agricul
ture will reap much of the benefit at least in
itially, he said.
This raises huge equity issues. Domestic
users and taxpayers are paying for agri-busi
ness profits, say opponents of the canal. But
subsidizing agriculture benefits citizens
through lower food prices, counter canal ad
vocates.
A representative from the Westlands Wa
ter District stated that "only $8 billion have
been spent so far on reclamation projects. It
was the best investment the government,
could make, increasing production and pro
viding food, clothing, and jobs."

Economic efficiency is also an issue in that
the present legal and political structure does
not allow farmers to consider real costs of
water delivery into their crop and irrigation
decisions, according to Dick Walker, assis
tant professor of geography at UC-Berkeley.
"They may grow rice in the desert yielding
$20 per acre ft. of water, having paid only $9
for it — a seemingly rational decision except
that the water cost the state over $100 per
acre," he said.
Fnvironmental Considerations
The environmental questions center
around the Delta, a network of waterways
that stretches from near Sacramento to east
San Francisco Bay. About 40 percent of the
state's natural runoff flows from the Sacia
mento and San Joaquin rivers into the Delta
and the Bay.
The Delta is heavily used for farming, fish
ing, and recreation, and is generally agreed
to have been damaged by water diversions
into existing state and federal water projects.
Striped bass populations (a popular sports
fish), have declined by 80 percent in the past
15 years, according to Delta fishermen.
The mere fact that the Canal willdivert
more water per year is enough to convince
most Delta lovers to hate the canal. There is
evidence, however, according to the State
Department of Water Resources (DWR) 1974
Environmental Impact Report, that the
canal, by releasing some of its water into the
Delta at several points on its way south, will
stop the reverse flows and saline intrusion,
thus actually improving Delta water quality.
SB2oo's legal clauses protecting the Delta
and the North Coast Rivers (Prop. 8) are de
signed to appease environmental concerns.
However, most environmental groups feel
that once the plumbing is in, no laws will
save the ecosystems affected.
"Legal requirements are actually small
