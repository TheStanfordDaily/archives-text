### 
FOR SB2OO
• Kern County Water Agency — an agen
cy influenced by agri-corporations, in
cluding Tenneco, the Tejon Ranch, and
Shell Oil. Want canal-water to put new
land into agricultural production.
• Los Angeles Metropolitan Water District
— an agency that supplies water to 11 mil
lion southern Californians. They project a
demand for water that mandates a canal
and have contracted for most of this wa
ter. Sell theirsurplusto Kern County Agri
culture at pumping cost only.
• Southern California developers — do
not want water to limit growth in south
ern California.
• State Department of Water Resources —
an agency set up to administer the State
Water Project. Feel the canal will improve
the Delta environment. Also feel that
their contracts with users are binding and
the canal is the only way to deliver on
these.
• Various Chambers of Commerce and lo
cal Water Districts — Support growth
generally, or have received political fa
vors for supporting the bill.
• Some environmental groups — feel that
bill is a decent compromise or the best
they can expect to get, as it contains Prop
osition Band Deltaenvironmental protec
tions.

OPPOSED TO SB2OO
• Farm Bureau Federation — a one
farm/one-vote statewide organization.
Not homogenous, but generally want a
canal but not the environmental protec
tions in the bill (Prop. 8 and Delta water
quality laws).
• Sports fishermen and recreational Delta
users — concerned about declining
striped bass and dying waterways which
they feel a canal would worsen.
• Southern California taxpayers and
ratepayers — particularly the Working Al
liance To Equalize Rates (WATER). Op
pose paying for water project that will
benefit Central Valley agri-business.
• Delta Farmers — have been getting wa
ter virtually free, but canal may cut it off.
Canal may also increase salt intrusion on
to their land.
• Environmental Groups — Sierra Club,
Friends of the Earth, League of Conserva
tion Voters, and others. Concern for flora
and fauna in Delta and Bay because the
canal would reduce flushing. Also fear
development of north coast rivers, which
requires a canal.
• Bay Area public — generally views
southern California as "greedy for their
water."
