## Entertainment Wouldn't you know it, the best one has subtitles! 'Pixote' offers no tender moment 'Looker' not for real 
### 
Hector Babenco's powerful
Pixote relates the story of a ten
year-old slum child from Sao
Paulo. We never doubt its
authenticity fora moment; we
know, for example (Babenco
tells us in a prologue), that
Fernando Ramas, who plays
the title character, is himself
one of nine siblings in a Sao
Paulo ghetto family. Babenco
grinds a heavy political axe: by
law minors are immune from
prison sentences in Brazil, but
resentful police officials who
are under the gun (of politi-

Pixote

cians who want to be re
elected) to appear effective in
controlling city crime round up
street gangs as a matter of
course when a murder is com
mitted (particularly, as in this
case, when the victim is a
citizen of some distinction).
The kids are beaten and
thrown into detention centers
that are as horrible as prisons;
when some die, the blame is of
ficially laid on other kids so that
the muckraking press can be
led away from the truth. The
cops are thus caught between
the bosses and the do-gooders.
Nobody wins, and the kids,
with no political clout except a
useless law that everyone
naively believes is in their fa
vor, are doomed; if they sur
vive the institution, they will
resurface as thieves and
murderers, pimps and dope
dealers.
The youth crime statistics in
this and other countries are
horrifying; Pixote is the first
movie that attempts to under
stand the conditions that trig
ger the mechanism of the re
cent rampant juvenile delin
quency. The children in this
film are not the faceless, numb
punks of the Time cover
stories; they are baby-faced
nomads wearing grown-up
clothes, trying to play by
grown-up rules — which
means internalizing their hor
ror and disgust at situations
that they are much too young
to have a right to comprehend.
They're innocents in hell —
like the 12-year-old whore
Jodie Foster played in Taxi
Driver — clinging to each other
or to whatever adults they feel
can give them direction — like
the alcoholic whore Sueli
(Marilia Pera, in a wild per
formance), who is more
adolescent and less capable of

coping than they are. They are
innocents even when they kill.
"Lord save little children!
They abide and they endure,"
says the benevolent god
mother figure at the end of The
Night of the Hunter, and we
are so inured to the fiction that
a special providence watches
over youngsters that the
brutality of the world Pixote
and his friends inhabit delivers
a more severe shock than we're
likely to receive from any other
of this year's movies. It's the
shock of Shoeshine, the great

Vittorio De Sica picture about
two boys who are led by the al
leged rehabilitative arm of so
ciety to turn against each other
— except that Pixote is sour
and hard-edged rather than
bittersweet, like Shoeshine.
Babenco isn't an artist, really:
he doesn't refine his observa
tions or keep the narrative line
clear (he and Jorge Duran
wrote the screenplay), and he's
not above staging a big scene
for sensationalism. In fact, in
the second half of the film, af
ter Pixote and three of hiscom
panions have escaped from the
detention center, the
c laustrophobic, concentration
camp atmosphere and the un
ending string of beatings and
framings give way to the more
leisurely world of the streets,
and the film dissipates some
what; Babenco shoots it up
with aborted fetuses in garbage
pails and close-ups of vomiting
and bleeding. There's some
thing of the yellow journalist in
Babenco, but if his methods are
occasionally suspect, his
motives are not.
In one way, the plot con
fusion in the detention center
scenes works to the film's ad
vantage: when we don't know
who is responsible for the
murder of some of the chil
dren, we feel as trapped and
disoriented as their friends
must. Thissection of the movie,
in which the boys play-act rob
beries and police interroga
tions with frightening seri
ousness, has extraordinary
energy, and it culminates in a
scene of operatic intensity: the
homosexual Lilica (Jorge
Juliano) cradles his lover, who
lias been bea'ten to death, in his
arms. Lilica is the only one of
the kids who conveys real pas
sion in this movie; his chosen
role — drag queen — allow:

him to be flamboyant; but his
mourning cries are a sort of an
them for all the children who
remain mute in the face of vio
lence and terror.
Pixote is so grim and relent
less in its representation of a
dead-ended life style that one
may have difficulty resolving
one's feelings about it. Baben
co leaves us with no hope for
this boy's salvation, and — de
spite the fact that tne film is an
SOS clearly dedicated to il
luminating thestateof affairs in
Sao Paulo — without any ex
pectation that conditions there
can be improved for children.
Babenco manipulates our re
sponses enough to make us
want to fight back, and yet Pix
ote is the damnedest movie: it
doesn't leave you alone — days
after seeing it, you can't get it
out of your head. In the most
amazing series of scenes in the
picture, Pixote shoots one of
his friends, the gently com
manding Dito (Gilberto
Maura), by accident, and then

one of Sueli's johns who was
his intended target; it is the
second time he has killed, and
once more his lack of im
mediate emotional reaction
disturbs us and alienates us
from him: he seems to turn
from a child, the object of our
love, into a dwarf monster.
Then our perceptions are
scrambled again: Sueli begins
to suckle Pixote, and we think,
My God, he's just a baby —
how can he be a killer when
he's too young to even be a
fully formed human being?
But Babenco doesn't permit
us the indulgence of a tender
moment: Sueli pulls Pixote off
her breast and throws him out
into the street. The director's
determination to deny us a sin
gle moment of beauty isolates
him from other filmmakers
who have created portraits of a
harrowing childhood — Julien
Duvivier in Poil de Carotte, De
Sica in Shoeshine, Truffaut in
The 400 Blows. Pixote enrages
us even as it breaks our hearts.

You can be sure that prac
tically everything in Looker is
deliberate — the sterility of the
interiors, the flatness of the
performances, the hollowness
of the tone in the early scenes.
Michael Crichton, who wrote
and directed it, has travelled a
long way from Westworld; he
learned in his second feature,
Coma, how to pace and edit —
no scene in Looker, including
the extended climax, feels ov
erlong. The plot is constructed
on a clever idea that pays off:
models with "perfect" features
are being replaced by holo
grams that hypnotize viewers
into buying the products they
advertise. It's the logical end of
Subliminal Seduction, played
for laughs: the models already
seem plastic before they've
been computer-cloned, and
the TV watchers already oper
ate like zombies.
Looker has a satirical slant,
but it's not a serious indictment
of American society, like Blow-
Out; its politics, like the
surgery performed on these

women by the hero, Dr. Larry
Roberts (Albert Finney), is
purely cosmetic. But the real
problem with Michael
Crichton isn't that he doesn't
think deeply — it's that, how
ever adept a technician he has
become, he doesn't think likea
director. That's the difference
between Looker and a movie
like Philip Kaufman's 1978 In
vasion of the Body Snatchers,
which embraced the same
theme: the final elimination of
individuality in a society that in
a thousand insidious ways has
been manipulating individuals
for years. Kaufman, like Brian
De Palma, knows how to
double edge a picture with wit
and horror: you laugh at the
blissed-out San Franciscans in
Body Snatchers, but the image
of the pod growing into Jeff
Goldblum as he sleeps may re
turn in nightmares. Body
Snatchers plays against a land
scape that De Chirico might
have mapped out — but
Crichton doesn't have enough
style to make a real nightmare
movie, so he settles for some
thing much tamer: a movie that
looks like what it's satirizing.
And it's hard to work up much
enthusiasm over a film that
feels as if it had been directed
by a machine.
Or much terror. Crichton
has assembled a few highly en
tertaining sequences: the com
puter scanning of a nude
model, Cindy (Susan Dey), a
car chase in which Finney and a
silent moustachioed villain
(Tim Rossovich) try to zap each
other with light guns that
numb and disorient their vic
tims, and an uproarious show
down in which the two men
and the evil corporation presi
dent, Reston (James Coburn),
stalk each other amid the holo
grams. But we're not fright
ened for an instant — just
amused. And since the movie
never catches us up, we have
ample opportunity to notice all
the narrative absurdities that a
more exciting filmmaker could
have got away with.(There'«( no
convincing reason for the kill
ing off of these "perfect" wom
en, except that Roberts must
be alerted or the plot won't
work at all.)
Crichton's greatest ally in
Looker is his production de
signer; the best thing about
this movie definitely the sets.
That was true of last summer's
<Jutland, too. Movies like
these don't take us very far,
even on the level of sheer en
tertainment; we leavethethea
ter hungry fora real movie.

are under the gun (of politi-

Pixote

cians who want to be re
elected) to appear effective in
controlling city crime round up
street gangs as a matter of
course when a murder is com
mitted (particularly, as in this
case, when the victim is a
citizen of some distinction).
The kids are beaten and
thrown into detention centers
that are as horrible as prisons;
when some die, the blame is of
ficially laid on other kids so that
the muckraking press can be
led away from the truth. The
cops are thus caught between
the bosses and the do-gooders.
Nobody wins, and the kids,
with no political clout except a
useless law that everyone
naively believes is in their fa
vor, are doomed; if they sur
vive the institution, they will
resurface as thieves and
murderers, pimps and dope
dealers.
The youth crime statistics in
this and other countries are
horrifying; Pixote is the first
movie that attempts to under
stand the conditions that trig
ger the mechanism of the re
cent rampant juvenile delin
quency. The children in this
film are not the faceless, numb
punks of the Time cover
stories; they are baby-faced
nomads wearing grown-up
clothes, trying to play by
grown-up rules — which
means internalizing their hor
ror and disgust at situations
that they are much too young
to have a right to comprehend.
They're innocents in hell —
like the 12-year-old whore
Jodie Foster played in Taxi
Driver — clinging to each other
or to whatever adults they feel
can give them direction — like
the alcoholic whore Sueli
(Marilia Pera, in a wild per
formance), who is more
adolescent and less capable of

coping than they are. They are
innocents even when they kill.
"Lord save little children!
They abide and they endure,"
says the benevolent god
mother figure at the end of The
Night of the Hunter, and we
are so inured to the fiction that
a special providence watches
over youngsters that the
brutality of the world Pixote
and his friends inhabit delivers
a more severe shock than we're
likely to receive from any other
of this year's movies. It's the
shock of Shoeshine, the great

Vittorio De Sica picture about
two boys who are led by the al
leged rehabilitative arm of so
ciety to turn against each other
— except that Pixote is sour
and hard-edged rather than
bittersweet, like Shoeshine.
Babenco isn't an artist, really:
he doesn't refine his observa
tions or keep the narrative line
clear (he and Jorge Duran
wrote the screenplay), and he's
not above staging a big scene
for sensationalism. In fact, in
the second half of the film, af
ter Pixote and three of hiscom
panions have escaped from the
detention center, the
c laustrophobic, concentration
camp atmosphere and the un
ending string of beatings and
framings give way to the more
leisurely world of the streets,
and the film dissipates some
what; Babenco shoots it up
with aborted fetuses in garbage
pails and close-ups of vomiting
and bleeding. There's some
thing of the yellow journalist in
Babenco, but if his methods are
occasionally suspect, his
motives are not.
In one way, the plot con
fusion in the detention center
scenes works to the film's ad
vantage: when we don't know
who is responsible for the
murder of some of the chil
dren, we feel as trapped and
disoriented as their friends
must. Thissection of the movie,
in which the boys play-act rob
beries and police interroga
tions with frightening seri
ousness, has extraordinary
energy, and it culminates in a
scene of operatic intensity: the
homosexual Lilica (Jorge
Juliano) cradles his lover, who
lias been bea'ten to death, in his
arms. Lilica is the only one of
the kids who conveys real pas
sion in this movie; his chosen
role — drag queen — allow:

him to be flamboyant; but his
mourning cries are a sort of an
them for all the children who
remain mute in the face of vio
lence and terror.
Pixote is so grim and relent
less in its representation of a
dead-ended life style that one
may have difficulty resolving
one's feelings about it. Baben
co leaves us with no hope for
this boy's salvation, and — de
spite the fact that tne film is an
SOS clearly dedicated to il
luminating thestateof affairs in
Sao Paulo — without any ex
pectation that conditions there
can be improved for children.
Babenco manipulates our re
sponses enough to make us
want to fight back, and yet Pix
ote is the damnedest movie: it
doesn't leave you alone — days
after seeing it, you can't get it
out of your head. In the most
amazing series of scenes in the
picture, Pixote shoots one of
his friends, the gently com
manding Dito (Gilberto
Maura), by accident, and then

one of Sueli's johns who was
his intended target; it is the
second time he has killed, and
once more his lack of im
mediate emotional reaction
disturbs us and alienates us
from him: he seems to turn
from a child, the object of our
love, into a dwarf monster.
Then our perceptions are
scrambled again: Sueli begins
to suckle Pixote, and we think,
My God, he's just a baby —
how can he be a killer when
he's too young to even be a
fully formed human being?
But Babenco doesn't permit
us the indulgence of a tender
moment: Sueli pulls Pixote off
her breast and throws him out
into the street. The director's
determination to deny us a sin
gle moment of beauty isolates
him from other filmmakers
who have created portraits of a
harrowing childhood — Julien
Duvivier in Poil de Carotte, De
Sica in Shoeshine, Truffaut in
The 400 Blows. Pixote enrages
us even as it breaks our hearts.

You can be sure that prac
tically everything in Looker is
deliberate — the sterility of the
interiors, the flatness of the
performances, the hollowness
of the tone in the early scenes.
Michael Crichton, who wrote
and directed it, has travelled a
long way from Westworld; he
learned in his second feature,
Coma, how to pace and edit —
no scene in Looker, including
the extended climax, feels ov
erlong. The plot is constructed
on a clever idea that pays off:
models with "perfect" features
are being replaced by holo
grams that hypnotize viewers
into buying the products they
advertise. It's the logical end of
Subliminal Seduction, played
for laughs: the models already
seem plastic before they've
been computer-cloned, and
the TV watchers already oper
ate like zombies.
Looker has a satirical slant,
but it's not a serious indictment
of American society, like Blow-
Out; its politics, like the
surgery performed on these

women by the hero, Dr. Larry
Roberts (Albert Finney), is
purely cosmetic. But the real
problem with Michael
Crichton isn't that he doesn't
think deeply — it's that, how
ever adept a technician he has
become, he doesn't think likea
director. That's the difference
between Looker and a movie
like Philip Kaufman's 1978 In
vasion of the Body Snatchers,
which embraced the same
theme: the final elimination of
individuality in a society that in
a thousand insidious ways has
been manipulating individuals
for years. Kaufman, like Brian
De Palma, knows how to
double edge a picture with wit
and horror: you laugh at the
blissed-out San Franciscans in
Body Snatchers, but the image
of the pod growing into Jeff
Goldblum as he sleeps may re
turn in nightmares. Body
Snatchers plays against a land
scape that De Chirico might
have mapped out — but
Crichton doesn't have enough
style to make a real nightmare
movie, so he settles for some
thing much tamer: a movie that
looks like what it's satirizing.
And it's hard to work up much
enthusiasm over a film that
feels as if it had been directed
by a machine.
Or much terror. Crichton
has assembled a few highly en
tertaining sequences: the com
puter scanning of a nude
model, Cindy (Susan Dey), a
car chase in which Finney and a
silent moustachioed villain
(Tim Rossovich) try to zap each
other with light guns that
numb and disorient their vic
tims, and an uproarious show
down in which the two men
and the evil corporation presi
dent, Reston (James Coburn),
stalk each other amid the holo
grams. But we're not fright
ened for an instant — just
amused. And since the movie
never catches us up, we have
ample opportunity to notice all
the narrative absurdities that a
more exciting filmmaker could
have got away with.(There'«( no
convincing reason for the kill
ing off of these "perfect" wom
en, except that Roberts must
be alerted or the plot won't
work at all.)
Crichton's greatest ally in
Looker is his production de
signer; the best thing about
this movie definitely the sets.
That was true of last summer's
<Jutland, too. Movies like
these don't take us very far,
even on the level of sheer en
tertainment; we leavethethea
ter hungry fora real movie.

Hector Babenco's powerful
Pixote relates the story of a ten
year-old slum child from Sao
Paulo. We never doubt its
authenticity fora moment; we
know, for example (Babenco
tells us in a prologue), that
Fernando Ramas, who plays
the title character, is himself
one of nine siblings in a Sao
Paulo ghetto family. Babenco
grinds a heavy political axe: by
law minors are immune from
prison sentences in Brazil, but
resentful police officials who
are under the gun (of politi-

Nobody wins, and the kids,
with no political clout except a
useless law that everyone
naively believes is in their fa
vor, are doomed; if they sur
vive the institution, they will
resurface as thieves and
murderers, pimps and dope
dealers.
The youth crime statistics in
this and other countries are
horrifying; Pixote is the first
movie that attempts to under
stand the conditions that trig
ger the mechanism of the re
cent rampant juvenile delin
quency. The children in this
film are not the faceless, numb
punks of the Time cover
stories; they are baby-faced
nomads wearing grown-up
clothes, trying to play by
grown-up rules — which
means internalizing their hor
ror and disgust at situations
that they are much too young
to have a right to comprehend.
They're innocents in hell —
like the 12-year-old whore
Jodie Foster played in Taxi
Driver — clinging to each other
or to whatever adults they feel
can give them direction — like
the alcoholic whore Sueli
(Marilia Pera, in a wild per
formance), who is more
adolescent and less capable of

coping than they are. They are
innocents even when they kill.
"Lord save little children!
They abide and they endure,"
says the benevolent god
mother figure at the end of The
Night of the Hunter, and we
are so inured to the fiction that
a special providence watches
over youngsters that the
brutality of the world Pixote
and his friends inhabit delivers
a more severe shock than we're
likely to receive from any other
of this year's movies. It's the
shock of Shoeshine, the great

Vittorio De Sica picture about
two boys who are led by the al
leged rehabilitative arm of so
ciety to turn against each other
— except that Pixote is sour
and hard-edged rather than
bittersweet, like Shoeshine.
Babenco isn't an artist, really:
he doesn't refine his observa
tions or keep the narrative line
clear (he and Jorge Duran
wrote the screenplay), and he's
not above staging a big scene
for sensationalism. In fact, in
the second half of the film, af
ter Pixote and three of hiscom
panions have escaped from the
detention center, the
c laustrophobic, concentration
camp atmosphere and the un
ending string of beatings and
framings give way to the more
leisurely world of the streets,
and the film dissipates some
what; Babenco shoots it up
with aborted fetuses in garbage
pails and close-ups of vomiting
and bleeding. There's some
thing of the yellow journalist in
Babenco, but if his methods are
occasionally suspect, his
motives are not.
In one way, the plot con
fusion in the detention center
scenes works to the film's ad
vantage: when we don't know
who is responsible for the
murder of some of the chil
dren, we feel as trapped and
disoriented as their friends
must. Thissection of the movie,
in which the boys play-act rob
beries and police interroga
tions with frightening seri
ousness, has extraordinary
energy, and it culminates in a
scene of operatic intensity: the
homosexual Lilica (Jorge
Juliano) cradles his lover, who
lias been bea'ten to death, in his
arms. Lilica is the only one of
the kids who conveys real pas
sion in this movie; his chosen
role — drag queen — allow:

him to be flamboyant; but his
mourning cries are a sort of an
them for all the children who
remain mute in the face of vio
lence and terror.
Pixote is so grim and relent
less in its representation of a
dead-ended life style that one
may have difficulty resolving
one's feelings about it. Baben
co leaves us with no hope for
this boy's salvation, and — de
spite the fact that tne film is an
SOS clearly dedicated to il
luminating thestateof affairs in
Sao Paulo — without any ex
pectation that conditions there
can be improved for children.
Babenco manipulates our re
sponses enough to make us
want to fight back, and yet Pix
ote is the damnedest movie: it
doesn't leave you alone — days
after seeing it, you can't get it
out of your head. In the most
amazing series of scenes in the
picture, Pixote shoots one of
his friends, the gently com
manding Dito (Gilberto
Maura), by accident, and then

one of Sueli's johns who was
his intended target; it is the
second time he has killed, and
once more his lack of im
mediate emotional reaction
disturbs us and alienates us
from him: he seems to turn
from a child, the object of our
love, into a dwarf monster.
Then our perceptions are
scrambled again: Sueli begins
to suckle Pixote, and we think,
My God, he's just a baby —
how can he be a killer when
he's too young to even be a
fully formed human being?
But Babenco doesn't permit
us the indulgence of a tender
moment: Sueli pulls Pixote off
her breast and throws him out
into the street. The director's
determination to deny us a sin
gle moment of beauty isolates
him from other filmmakers
who have created portraits of a
harrowing childhood — Julien
Duvivier in Poil de Carotte, De
Sica in Shoeshine, Truffaut in
The 400 Blows. Pixote enrages
us even as it breaks our hearts.

You can be sure that prac
tically everything in Looker is
deliberate — the sterility of the
interiors, the flatness of the
performances, the hollowness
of the tone in the early scenes.
Michael Crichton, who wrote
and directed it, has travelled a
long way from Westworld; he
learned in his second feature,
Coma, how to pace and edit —
no scene in Looker, including
the extended climax, feels ov
erlong. The plot is constructed
on a clever idea that pays off:
models with "perfect" features
are being replaced by holo
grams that hypnotize viewers
into buying the products they
advertise. It's the logical end of
Subliminal Seduction, played
for laughs: the models already
seem plastic before they've
been computer-cloned, and
the TV watchers already oper
ate like zombies.
Looker has a satirical slant,
but it's not a serious indictment
of American society, like Blow-
Out; its politics, like the
surgery performed on these

women by the hero, Dr. Larry
Roberts (Albert Finney), is
purely cosmetic. But the real
problem with Michael
Crichton isn't that he doesn't
think deeply — it's that, how
ever adept a technician he has
become, he doesn't think likea
director. That's the difference
between Looker and a movie
like Philip Kaufman's 1978 In
vasion of the Body Snatchers,
which embraced the same
theme: the final elimination of
individuality in a society that in
a thousand insidious ways has
been manipulating individuals
for years. Kaufman, like Brian
De Palma, knows how to
double edge a picture with wit
and horror: you laugh at the
blissed-out San Franciscans in
Body Snatchers, but the image
of the pod growing into Jeff
Goldblum as he sleeps may re
turn in nightmares. Body
Snatchers plays against a land
scape that De Chirico might
have mapped out — but
Crichton doesn't have enough
style to make a real nightmare
movie, so he settles for some
thing much tamer: a movie that
looks like what it's satirizing.
And it's hard to work up much
enthusiasm over a film that
feels as if it had been directed
by a machine.
Or much terror. Crichton
has assembled a few highly en
tertaining sequences: the com
puter scanning of a nude
model, Cindy (Susan Dey), a
car chase in which Finney and a
silent moustachioed villain
(Tim Rossovich) try to zap each
other with light guns that
numb and disorient their vic
tims, and an uproarious show
down in which the two men
and the evil corporation presi
dent, Reston (James Coburn),
stalk each other amid the holo
grams. But we're not fright
ened for an instant — just
amused. And since the movie
never catches us up, we have
ample opportunity to notice all
the narrative absurdities that a
more exciting filmmaker could
have got away with.(There'«( no
convincing reason for the kill
ing off of these "perfect" wom
en, except that Roberts must
be alerted or the plot won't
work at all.)
Crichton's greatest ally in
Looker is his production de
signer; the best thing about
this movie definitely the sets.
That was true of last summer's
<Jutland, too. Movies like
these don't take us very far,
even on the level of sheer en
tertainment; we leavethethea
ter hungry fora real movie.

Hector Babenco's powerful
Pixote relates the story of a ten
year-old slum child from Sao
Paulo. We never doubt its
authenticity fora moment; we
know, for example (Babenco
tells us in a prologue), that
Fernando Ramas, who plays
the title character, is himself
one of nine siblings in a Sao
Paulo ghetto family. Babenco
grinds a heavy political axe: by
law minors are immune from
prison sentences in Brazil, but
resentful police officials who
are under the gun (of politi-

Pixote

cians who want to be re
elected) to appear effective in
controlling city crime round up
street gangs as a matter of
course when a murder is com
mitted (particularly, as in this
case, when the victim is a
citizen of some distinction).
The kids are beaten and
thrown into detention centers
that are as horrible as prisons;
when some die, the blame is of
ficially laid on other kids so that
the muckraking press can be
led away from the truth. The
cops are thus caught between
the bosses and the do-gooders.
Nobody wins, and the kids,
with no political clout except a
useless law that everyone
naively believes is in their fa
