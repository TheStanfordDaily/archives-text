# 'Quartet' does Rhys little justice
## 
### 
Jean Rhys's novels are like impressionist
tone poems; though the psychology of the
characters is intricately drawn, their per
sonalities are less important than the mood
of hypnotic gloom that sucks them in and
from which there is no chance of escape.
The people in her books live in a world that
we visit in our worst depressions, a world
that Rhys seems to conjure up, like Virginia
VVoolf does, entirely out of shrewdly ob
served details. I'm not sure who could put
Rhys's early (1928) Quartet on screen — it
asks fora combination of the Max Ophuls
of Letter from an Unknown Woman and
the Truffaut of The Story of Adele H. — but
the last people who ought to have been set
loose on it are the irrepressible team of
James Ivory (director) and Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala (screenwriter), whose last col
laboration was Henry James's The Europe
ans.
' Ivory and Jhabvala seem to feel that they
have a mission to film the most idiosyn
cratic books in the modern British canon
— books that are a triumph of tempera
ment and style and absolutely resist the
camera — and though they have great
taste, they approach the task like high
school lit students who have fallen in love
with the idea of a novel but don't under
stand what makes it good. (The Europeans
was a movie utterly devoid of humor, de
rived from a book that makes one laugh
out loud.) I can't wait to find out what
they'll decimate next — To the Light
house? The Golden Notebook?
In Quartet Rhys introduced some of the
themes that she would develop six years
later in her masterful Voyage in the Dark:

the seductiveness of despair, the help
lessness of women bred to dependence on
men and deserted by them, the careless
cruelty of those who have the sexual upper
hand. Marya, nicknamed Mado, is married
to a shady, unreliable man, Stephen; when
illegal art sales put him in prison, she is left
without money or easy means of support,
so she allows herself to be "adopted" by a
decadent older couple, H.J. and Lois
Heidler. She is swept into an affair with H.J.
of which Lois is fully conscious and even
encourages as a means of holding on to
him herself; Lois hates them both but can
not free herself from H.J. Marya and Lois
are two faces of the same woman Rhys sees
over and over again — the sensualist
trapped both by her own sexual needs and
the predatory nature of the men she at
tracts.
Bad as the movie is, it has two strong per
formances from actresses who display a
greater understanding of these women
than either Ivory or Jhabvala. Isabelle Ad
jani won the Best Actress prize at Cannes
for both her portrayal of Marya and her
work in the gruesome, exploitative
Possession, but she only really acts in
Quartet. Her performance here hasa phys
ical Tightness that clarifies a number of en
counters that the filmmakers have left
opaque: we can feel her discomfort when
she visits Stephen in jail while suffocating
under the burden of a cold — Marya is so
easily defeated — and her singing in a
flashback about her days as an aspiring
show girl is touchingly incompetent. If it
weren't for these instinctive flourishes of
Adjani's, we wouldn't know why we are

supposed to be watching these scenes, and
sometimes even she is powerless to keep
us from asking that question, because Ad
jani works independently of the film,
which fights her performance at every turn
by giving her almost nothing to play.
Lois is Maggie Smith, who gives us a
glimpse — rare in the movies she has been
in — of the technical virtuosity and emo
tional range that mark her as one of the
great contemporary stage actresses. Her
finest moment here is a speech in which
Lois describes cleaning out the room
where H.j.'s last mistress, who ended as a
suicide, lived; Smith shows us both Lois's
fatal attraction to Heidler's weakness and
the callousness that enables her to deal
with his victims. She is bettercast than Alan
Bates, who doesn't provide any evidence
of Heidler's sexual dominance. I saw Bates
play Trigorin in The Sea Cull once, and my
major objection to him in that role pre
figured my objection to him in this one: I
don't believe that this character is capable
of destroying a young woman.
Jhabvala's approach to adapting Rhys's
novel is a sort of literary Pin the Tail on the
Donkey: some scenes are sparse, some are
explicit, but we see no indication of any
motive behind her choices, and luck is not
on her side. There is no real sense of place
or style in this film — the actors, except for
Adjani, wear Judy Moorcroft's over
designed Roaring '20s costumes like strait
jackets. Jean Rhys wrote about the kind of
aching aimlessness that overpowers; un
derlie overly fastidious, Quartet on screen
comes closer to conveying the pain of a
mouth sore.
