# Theatre Rhino season opens
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Last week, I wrote about the
tureka Theatre having to re
locate after its home was de
stroyed by a fire. This week
1 heatre Rhinoceros opened its
season at a new location in the
Mission. They used to perform
at the Goodman Building at
Geary and Van Ness, but the
city decided to make that
neighborhood more respect
able. So the artists and theatre
people were evicted, probably
to make room for con
dominiums.
Theatre Rhino has settled at
the Redstone Building at 16th
arid South Van Ness, and they
seem to have done well out of
the move. They now have a
bigger theatre, a second stage,
and generally a lot more space.
Theatre Rhino is now in its fifth
season, doubling or tripling its
ticket sales every year, and is
achieving recognition from
such groups as the National En
dowment for the Arts.
The first play this season is
Fugue in a Nursery by Harvey
Fierstein. This play is part two
of his Torch Song Trilogy; part
one, The International Stud,
was produced at Theatre
Rhinoceros last winter. The
trilogy is autobiographical,
with Fierstein being trans
formed into Arnold, a middle
aged drag star.

In The International Stud.
Arnold meets Ed, the great love
of his life, in a sleazy Green
wich Village bar. They have a
passionate affair, but even
tually Ed decides that he isn't
gay after all. Ed wants to be re
spectable, so he takes up with a
woman named Laurel, who is at
someone Ed can take
home to his parents. In the
meantime, he continues to
make it with guys when no
body's looking.
Fugue in a Nursery takes
place a year later, and begins
with Laurel and Ed inviting
Arnold and his new boyfriend
Alan to a weekend in the coun
try. Most of the action occurs
during this weekend, with

Laurel and Alan sizing up their
predecessors, and with Ed and
Arnold sizing up each other.
Fierstein is a romantic, but a
street-wise romantic, and the
various seductions, reminis
cences, arguments, and recon
ciliations are all seen from his
cynical but sensitive point of
view.
I first saw this play last spring
at a staged reading with Fiers
tein himself playing Arnold; so
Martin Xero, who is now in this
role, has some quite for
midable competition. Xero's
delivery often seems forced,
without the pauses and the de
tachment which can work well
with cynical humor, and which
the author seemed to have in

mind for the part.
Both Sheila Lichirie (Laurel)
and Robert Wendell (Alan) are
marvelous. Their naturalness
and excellent comic timing are
a pleasure to watch.
The character of Ed is prob
lematic. Ed is the naive villain of
both plays, and has no sense of
humor. Neither Joel lason in
The International Stud nor
Curt Crider in this play have
been able to do much with the
role.
The performance is well
paced, thanks to the direction
of Kevin Hanlon. The im
aginative set, with oversized
building-blocks used re
sourcefully as props, is by Tom
Williams.
