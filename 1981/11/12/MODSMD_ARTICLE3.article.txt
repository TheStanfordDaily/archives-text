### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
The decision to limit the number of
Zeta Psi fraternity members whd can
live together in future housing as
signments has been reversed, said
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Residential Education, at an informal
discussion in Florence Moore Hall
yesterday.
Originally, the decision to disband
the Zeta Psi fraternity stipulated that
no more than two Zetes could live to
gether in campus residence houses.
"There is no limit except the limit
of the draw,"said Robinson, who
added that Zetes will be allowed to
draw together and that they will all
beguaranteed housing fornext quar
ter.
Robinson explained earlier in the
day that although he does not want
the fraternity to be re-created on
campus, he does not want to treat the
Zetes differently from any other indi
viduals in the housing system. If
those issues came into conflict, he

said he would "watch to see what is
happening," talk to the people in
volved, and not hesitate to take
measures which would break up the
group.
Robinson told about 20 students
on hand in Mirlo House that the de
cision to kick the Zetes off campus
was an administrative decision for
which he was responsible.
However, before making the de
cision Robinson said that he strongly
considered the recommendation of a
faculty-student advisory committee
which looked into the incident and
recommended the three-year sus
pension.
The incident which led to the sus
pension involved members of Zeta
Psi who threw a visiting female stu
dent from Mills College into a pond.
The committee judged the inci
dent to be part of a fraternity tradi
tion of "ponding" women who did
not respond to member's advances,,
according to Robinson."lt was clear

ly in disregard to the women's
rights,"he said.
In answer to a hypothetical ques
tion posed by a member of the au
dience, Robinson said a residence
house could also be disbanded if it
could be shown that it was "sanc
tioning irresponsible behavior."
In addition to taking away the
Zete's house, the office of Residen
tial Education has also taken away the
University's recognition of the Zetes
as an organization, according to Rob
inson. This means that for the next
three years the Zetes will not be able
to use any University facilities as a
group.
The number of years of the Zete
suspension was chosen because Rob
inson wants to have a whole new
generation of Zete members should
the house be returned tothefraterni
ty, Robinson said.
"We wanted to get a whole new
group of people in the house who
didn't know what life in the house
was like previously,"Robinson said.
One audience member ques
tioned the severe effects the pun
ishment would have on the fraterni
ty. Robinson responded that this was
the point of the sanction."Our whole
purpose is to stop business as usu
al,"he said.
