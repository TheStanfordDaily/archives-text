|rll Lorber Fusion
The Old Waldorf San Fran
cisco
November 1981
It's in their name: Jeff
Lorber Fusion. The word
fusion implies the joining
together of two entities, in
this case the sounds of jazz
and rock music. And that is
exactly what JLF did last
Tuesday night at the Old
Waldorf. So well did they
perform, it prompted mem
bers of the audience to label
them "the hottest thing in
the city" — a statement not
that far from the truth.
Making JLF sound even
better was opening act
Shawn Phillips, an acoustic
guitarist. His first words on
stage were in reference to
the length of his per
formance: "This is going to
be short and compact." He
didn't lie, thank Cod. He
could have aptly described
his show as "Six Variations
of 'Stairway to Heaven,' "
since every tune had strik
ing similarities to the Led
Zeppelin song.
His lyrics were even less
original, and his voice
wouldn't have only broken
the glass in a Memorex
commercial, but the
cassette deck as well. When
Phillips hit a high note dur
ing a song written about the
recent earthquake in Italy,
he nearly started one
himself. Enough about him.
Almost as bad was the

Waldort, perhaps the only
nightclub where it is physi
cally painful to view a show.
My neck still aches from
having turned it 179 degrees
tor two hours.
But once the Waldorf had
crammed in as many people
at as many different angles
as possible, JLF arrived on
stage. Keyboard specialist
Jeff Lorber, Kenny Gorlick
on saxophone, flute, clar
i net, and Iy r i c on,
guitarist/vocalist Marlon
McClain, drummer Dennis
Bradford, and bassist Danny
Wilson make up what ha>» to
be one of America's pre
mier fusion groups today.
The only flaw in JLF's de
livery of their music was the
"head-wagging" to a song's
beat by Lorber, McClain,
and Gorlick. Smiling and si
multaneously wagging
one's head to the rhythm is
strictly reserved fot preten
tious rock bands and has no
place in jazz/fusion.
Flowever, one member of
the quintet who didn't
partake in this ostentatious
behavior was bassist Wilson,
who stole the show.
Wilson exhibited the abil
ity to play his bass with ver
satility, perfection, and
emotion. Using the entire
i nst ru ment, his solo
pumped the crowd up so
high that the adrenalin
never stopped flowing for
the duration of the night.
The five minute solo had the
audience on its feet clap
ping in unison to help

Wilson keep the beat.
Watch out, Stanley Clarke.
Also in the show was a
version of the famous Ron
nie Laws song, "Always
There." Although Laws'
rendition is a bit better, JLF
does an adequate job with
the catchy tune. But more
important, by redoing an
other group's song, JLF
proved that they indeed
possess their "own" sound.
The group has been
plagued with criticism that
they are copy-cats, a mere
combination of everybody
else's sounds. But, JLF is
legitimate and"for real," as
they now have shown the
power to "Lorberize" a
tune, not just Xerox it.
What makes |LF so fan
tastic in concert is that they
perform as a well-balanced
team, with few weak spots.
But if one member of the
band would have to go, it
would be McClain. Al
though he pretended to be
playing difficult rifts by lean
ing back with closed eyes
during solos, McClain's
guitar playing leaves some
thing to be desired. Still, his
heavy metal sound con
tributes positively to JLF's
near-perfect fusion.
The group's next album
Will be a big test, as JLF's stu
dio work so far hasn't ri
valed their live per
formances. Even if the LP to
be released in early 1982 is
not up to par, JLF is not to be
missed in concert under any
circumstances. Period.

Waldort, perhaps the only
nightclub where it is physi
cally painful to view a show.
My neck still aches from
having turned it 179 degrees
tor two hours.
But once the Waldorf had
crammed in as many people
at as many different angles
as possible, JLF arrived on
stage. Keyboard specialist
Jeff Lorber, Kenny Gorlick
on saxophone, flute, clar
i net, and Iy r i c on,
guitarist/vocalist Marlon
McClain, drummer Dennis
Bradford, and bassist Danny
Wilson make up what ha>» to
be one of America's pre
mier fusion groups today.
The only flaw in JLF's de
livery of their music was the
"head-wagging" to a song's
beat by Lorber, McClain,
and Gorlick. Smiling and si
multaneously wagging
one's head to the rhythm is
strictly reserved fot preten
tious rock bands and has no
place in jazz/fusion.
Flowever, one member of
the quintet who didn't
partake in this ostentatious
behavior was bassist Wilson,
who stole the show.
Wilson exhibited the abil
ity to play his bass with ver
satility, perfection, and
emotion. Using the entire
i nst ru ment, his solo
pumped the crowd up so
high that the adrenalin
never stopped flowing for
the duration of the night.
The five minute solo had the
audience on its feet clap
ping in unison to help

Wilson keep the beat.
Watch out, Stanley Clarke.
Also in the show was a
version of the famous Ron
nie Laws song, "Always
There." Although Laws'
rendition is a bit better, JLF
does an adequate job with
the catchy tune. But more
important, by redoing an
other group's song, JLF
proved that they indeed
possess their "own" sound.
The group has been
plagued with criticism that
they are copy-cats, a mere
combination of everybody
else's sounds. But, JLF is
legitimate and"for real," as
they now have shown the
power to "Lorberize" a
tune, not just Xerox it.
What makes |LF so fan
tastic in concert is that they
perform as a well-balanced
team, with few weak spots.
But if one member of the
band would have to go, it
would be McClain. Al
though he pretended to be
playing difficult rifts by lean
ing back with closed eyes
during solos, McClain's
guitar playing leaves some
thing to be desired. Still, his
heavy metal sound con
tributes positively to JLF's
near-perfect fusion.
The group's next album
Will be a big test, as JLF's stu
dio work so far hasn't ri
valed their live per
formances. Even if the LP to
be released in early 1982 is
not up to par, JLF is not to be
missed in concert under any
circumstances. Period.
|rll Lorber Fusion
The Old Waldorf San Fran
cisco
November 1981
It's in their name: Jeff
Lorber Fusion. The word
fusion implies the joining
together of two entities, in
this case the sounds of jazz
and rock music. And that is
exactly what JLF did last
Tuesday night at the Old
Waldorf. So well did they
perform, it prompted mem
bers of the audience to label
them "the hottest thing in
the city" — a statement not
that far from the truth.
Making JLF sound even
better was opening act
Shawn Phillips, an acoustic
guitarist. His first words on
stage were in reference to
the length of his per
formance: "This is going to
be short and compact." He
didn't lie, thank Cod. He
could have aptly described
his show as "Six Variations
of 'Stairway to Heaven,' "
since every tune had strik
ing similarities to the Led
Zeppelin song.
His lyrics were even less
original, and his voice
wouldn't have only broken
the glass in a Memorex
commercial, but the
cassette deck as well. When
Phillips hit a high note dur
ing a song written about the
recent earthquake in Italy,
he nearly started one
himself. Enough about him.
Almost as bad was the

Waldort, perhaps the only
nightclub where it is physi
cally painful to view a show.
