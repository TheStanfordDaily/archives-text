# The 						Who break out, Entwistle breaks away
## 
### Stefan Malmoli 
When greatest hits packages are re
leased, I'm always a little wary. There
have been just too many greatest hits
fiascos that have been ill advised, poor
ly packaged, and artistically weak (e.g.
Sucking in the '70s by the Rolling
Stones, or Abba's Greatest Hits Vol. I, let
alone Vol II). However, these pack
ages, in spite of their flaws, have
grossed their record companies mega
bucks. It comes, therefore, as a pleasant
surprise to see a greatest hits package
that matches its music. The Who's
greatest hits, Hooligans, released on
MCA Records, is a well-planned and
thought out double album. It contains
the Who's greatest c uts in the 1970s and
is nicely packageci with some mod pic
tures. As a bonus, all the words to the
songs are included.
To begin with, though, one has the
song selection itself. The album is
basically a post-1970 greatest hits collec
tion that should appeal to both the TM
radio listener and the ardent Who fan.
Only three songs are from the '60s era in
which the Who was just known for the
big-nosed guitarist and sloppy drum
mer who would perform self-destructo
on their respective guitars and drum
sets. Therefore, this album is not rec
ommended for anyone seeking those
classic '60s Who numbers dealing with
angry adolescence and pubescent fan
tasies (one should seek out Meaty, Mea
ty, Big and Bouncy for those songs). I he
three songs that are dated from the '60s
all capture a period of the Who: for ear
ly maximum-rhythm-and-blues Who,
we have "I Can't Explain"; for feedback
Who, we have "I Can See for Miles"
(still, by the way, the only top ten single
by the Who); and for rock-opera Who,
p we have "Pinball Wizard."
Now somebody out there is asking
P why "My Generation" arid "See Me,
I Feel Me" aren't on this album. Well, in
; my opinion, MCA did us a favor by leav
-1 ing out those two songs. After all, if they
? were here, it would have been the fifth
£ appearance of "My Generation" on an
I album, and the seventh appearance for
1 "See Me, Feel Me." Therefore, by sav

ing us from these already easily ac
cessible songs, MC A could throw in
some latter day rarities.
From there we are immediately as
saulted with the prime cuts from the
Who's post-1970 mature period. In
cluded are classics from Who's Next,
/./ve at Leeds, Quadrophenia, Who By
Numbers, and Who Are You. Without a
doubt, many more songs could have
been added to this already incredible
set. We can run the gamut of the best of
I ownshend's masterpieces, and we can
see how his lyrics have progressed and
matured through the years. The naive
innocent rocker in "Bargain," who was
"looking for that free ride," has
changed into the experienced fighter
of "Slip Kid," who has come to the re
alization that "there's no easy way to be
free. . .It's a hard, hard world." The kid
who believed that the '60s could exist
into the '70s (the plea in
O'Riley": "Don't look past my shoul
der, the exodus is here, the happy ones
are near") has now changed his views in
relation to the confused events of the
'70s (the giving up attitude of "Why
should I care?" in "5:15").
The maturity of Townshend's lyrics is
equally apparent in the melodies of the
songs as well. There have never been
songs so beautiful and melodic, yet so
vengeful and angered, as "Behind Blue
Eyes." There have never been songs so
destructive, yet so hopeful for the
future, as "Drowned" (". . .I ain't seen a
sign of my heio, but I'm still diving
down for pearls"). Flowever, it is
noteworthy that in the end of all this
wide range of material, it it only love (in
whatever form) that is of true worldly
importance. For Townshend, who had
taken the blame for the tragedy at Cin
cinnati and who had a part of himself
die when Keith Moon died, it is all the
more poignant that love can still prevail
over the hardships in life. For
Townshend, love is found through mu
sic, so when one hears him sing, "Now I
go where the music fits my soul, and I
will never let go," it isn't bull. It's really
from the heart of a survivor of love.
But enough of the maturity. The lis
tener who caies enough, will decipher
all this for himself. After all, it is the mu
sic that is the t[iing. And there's a
whallop of it. In addition, three rare sin
gles and B-sides — "Let's See Action,"
"The Relay," and "Join Together" —
are thrown in for the collector, and they
too hold up well on their own (they all
are leftovers from the aborted
Townshend rock opera Lifehouse, and
all are thematic songs dealing with the
'60s ending and where does rock, as
well as life, go from there.
Overall, of course, the musicianship
is unmatchable. Not enough praise
could be said, so I won't try. Therefore,
I'll end by saying that if one had to de
fine rock and roll, I would say the Who.
The Beatles went too far beyond the
basics and made it open to all modes of
style and people (which attests to their
greatness). The Stones just went too
commercial. But for defining straight
rock, the Who wins, hands down.

I was talking to a friend of mine who
had recently become a Who fan. My
friend was really getting into all of their
music, and so I asked him what were
some of his favorite Who songs. He
mentioned of course their popular hits,
but fie also mentioned "My Wife,"
"Had Enough," "Boris, the Spider," and
"You." I then proceeded to ask him
who had written those last few songs.
He instantly answered, "Pete
Townshend, of course. Who else?" I
told him that John Entwistle had written
all of them. To which he replied, "John
who?" I guess he has a lot to learn (and
so do a lot of people) about John
Entwistle, the Who's bassist.
Therefore, Too Late the Hero, John
Entwistle's new solo album, is aptly
titled. It contains an abundance of well
done songs that occasionally approach
Who proportions. The musicians them
selves are of excellent quality as well.
Entwistle, who wrote all of the material,
shows off his already rumbling bass
along with adding a unique touch on
synthesizers and keyboards. To carry
the guitar work in the absence of Pete
Townshend, we are given Joe Walsh,
who ably fills in. Entwistle and Walsh
have been great friends ever since
Walsh's own James Gang used to open
for the Who in the early '70s, and their
compatability is fused finely. To round
out the group, Joe Vitale, the veteran
drummer, does tight drum work on all
of the songs.
Now Who fans who buy this album
might not be satisfied if they are looking
fora Who-formula album. Instead, we
are given a truly solo John Entwistle
who differs from the context of the
Who. On only one song, "I'm Coming
Back," does one get the feeling that the
Who is playing behind Entwistle, and
this is due to the Townshend-like
power chcfrding by Walsh. However,
this doesn't mean that the songs them
selves are weak in any respect. In fact,
they are quite good and they show a
more serious side to the usually lewd

and dastardly lyricist with the Who. Of
course, some of the old morbid and sin
ister persona comes through on such
songs as "Talk Dirty" and "Love Is a
FHeart Attack."
In contrast, though, many of the cuts
show a mature, reflective character
dwelling on questions of music, love,
and life. Entwistle questions his own
musical perspectives ("You talk about
music/Chopin — too square/Heavy
metal — too loud/Top Twenty — who
cares!") and puts down the darker busi
ness side inherent in the recording in
dustry ("I'm gonna spin ya round, screw
you into the ground, till I make a star
outa you").
On even more meaningful matters,
Entwistle leaves his typical rocker
stance and sings two sorrowful ballads
concerning the pains of losing love. On
"Lovebird," he sings of losing his only
love ("As the door closed behind her, I
opened my eyes/The pillow was emp
ty. . .Fly away lovebird. . .Now winter is
over/So am I — so am I"), and on "Love
Is a Heart Attack," he relates the throes
of love to other personal problems
("Drugs I can handle/Booze I can
quit/But giving up love, I can't take it").
This maturity is also evident in his ex
aminations of himself. On "Fallen
Angel," Entwistle sings about life's in
herent dangers in the "rock" world, giv
ing a passing nod at Keith Moon's own
death, and on the autobiographical title
track, he sums up his own life ("Too late
the hero/It all comes to zero and I — I
wish I could stop and start it again").
The only real flaw in this otherwise
excellent album is Entwistle's voice. Al
though it fits on some of the songs, it's
just too harsh and razor-edged. His
range is limited and one wishes Roger
Daltrey had been sitting in on some of
the sessions. Over all, though, with
Entwistle's bass runs and Walsh's Eagles
style guitar picking, the sound is solid
and full. It's Entwistle's finest moment
as a* solo performer. But alas, he will
have to go back to his set role with the
Who — just too late the hero, I guess.

big-nosed guitarist and sloppy drum
mer who would perform self-destructo
on their respective guitars and drum
sets. Therefore, this album is not rec
ommended for anyone seeking those
classic '60s Who numbers dealing with
angry adolescence and pubescent fan
tasies (one should seek out Meaty, Mea
ty, Big and Bouncy for those songs). I he
three songs that are dated from the '60s
all capture a period of the Who: for ear
ly maximum-rhythm-and-blues Who,
we have "I Can't Explain"; for feedback
Who, we have "I Can See for Miles"
(still, by the way, the only top ten single
by the Who); and for rock-opera Who,
p we have "Pinball Wizard."
Now somebody out there is asking
P why "My Generation" arid "See Me,
I Feel Me" aren't on this album. Well, in
; my opinion, MCA did us a favor by leav
-1 ing out those two songs. After all, if they
? were here, it would have been the fifth
£ appearance of "My Generation" on an
I album, and the seventh appearance for
1 "See Me, Feel Me." Therefore, by sav

ing us from these already easily ac
cessible songs, MC A could throw in
some latter day rarities.
From there we are immediately as
saulted with the prime cuts from the
Who's post-1970 mature period. In
cluded are classics from Who's Next,
/./ve at Leeds, Quadrophenia, Who By
Numbers, and Who Are You. Without a
doubt, many more songs could have
been added to this already incredible
set. We can run the gamut of the best of
I ownshend's masterpieces, and we can
see how his lyrics have progressed and
matured through the years. The naive
innocent rocker in "Bargain," who was
"looking for that free ride," has
changed into the experienced fighter
of "Slip Kid," who has come to the re
alization that "there's no easy way to be
free. . .It's a hard, hard world." The kid
who believed that the '60s could exist
into the '70s (the plea in
O'Riley": "Don't look past my shoul
der, the exodus is here, the happy ones
are near") has now changed his views in
relation to the confused events of the
'70s (the giving up attitude of "Why
should I care?" in "5:15").
The maturity of Townshend's lyrics is
equally apparent in the melodies of the
songs as well. There have never been
songs so beautiful and melodic, yet so
vengeful and angered, as "Behind Blue
Eyes." There have never been songs so
destructive, yet so hopeful for the
future, as "Drowned" (". . .I ain't seen a
sign of my heio, but I'm still diving
down for pearls"). Flowever, it is
noteworthy that in the end of all this
wide range of material, it it only love (in
whatever form) that is of true worldly
importance. For Townshend, who had
taken the blame for the tragedy at Cin
cinnati and who had a part of himself
die when Keith Moon died, it is all the
more poignant that love can still prevail
over the hardships in life. For
Townshend, love is found through mu
sic, so when one hears him sing, "Now I
go where the music fits my soul, and I
will never let go," it isn't bull. It's really
from the heart of a survivor of love.
But enough of the maturity. The lis
tener who caies enough, will decipher
all this for himself. After all, it is the mu
sic that is the t[iing. And there's a
whallop of it. In addition, three rare sin
gles and B-sides — "Let's See Action,"
"The Relay," and "Join Together" —
are thrown in for the collector, and they
too hold up well on their own (they all
are leftovers from the aborted
Townshend rock opera Lifehouse, and
all are thematic songs dealing with the
'60s ending and where does rock, as
well as life, go from there.
Overall, of course, the musicianship
is unmatchable. Not enough praise
could be said, so I won't try. Therefore,
I'll end by saying that if one had to de
fine rock and roll, I would say the Who.
The Beatles went too far beyond the
basics and made it open to all modes of
style and people (which attests to their
greatness). The Stones just went too
commercial. But for defining straight
rock, the Who wins, hands down.

I was talking to a friend of mine who
had recently become a Who fan. My
friend was really getting into all of their
music, and so I asked him what were
some of his favorite Who songs. He
mentioned of course their popular hits,
but fie also mentioned "My Wife,"
"Had Enough," "Boris, the Spider," and
"You." I then proceeded to ask him
who had written those last few songs.
He instantly answered, "Pete
Townshend, of course. Who else?" I
told him that John Entwistle had written
all of them. To which he replied, "John
who?" I guess he has a lot to learn (and
so do a lot of people) about John
Entwistle, the Who's bassist.
Therefore, Too Late the Hero, John
Entwistle's new solo album, is aptly
titled. It contains an abundance of well
done songs that occasionally approach
Who proportions. The musicians them
selves are of excellent quality as well.
Entwistle, who wrote all of the material,
shows off his already rumbling bass
along with adding a unique touch on
synthesizers and keyboards. To carry
the guitar work in the absence of Pete
Townshend, we are given Joe Walsh,
who ably fills in. Entwistle and Walsh
have been great friends ever since
Walsh's own James Gang used to open
for the Who in the early '70s, and their
compatability is fused finely. To round
out the group, Joe Vitale, the veteran
drummer, does tight drum work on all
of the songs.
Now Who fans who buy this album
might not be satisfied if they are looking
fora Who-formula album. Instead, we
are given a truly solo John Entwistle
who differs from the context of the
Who. On only one song, "I'm Coming
Back," does one get the feeling that the
Who is playing behind Entwistle, and
this is due to the Townshend-like
power chcfrding by Walsh. However,
this doesn't mean that the songs them
selves are weak in any respect. In fact,
they are quite good and they show a
more serious side to the usually lewd

and dastardly lyricist with the Who. Of
course, some of the old morbid and sin
ister persona comes through on such
songs as "Talk Dirty" and "Love Is a
FHeart Attack."
In contrast, though, many of the cuts
show a mature, reflective character
dwelling on questions of music, love,
and life. Entwistle questions his own
musical perspectives ("You talk about
music/Chopin — too square/Heavy
metal — too loud/Top Twenty — who
cares!") and puts down the darker busi
ness side inherent in the recording in
dustry ("I'm gonna spin ya round, screw
you into the ground, till I make a star
outa you").
On even more meaningful matters,
Entwistle leaves his typical rocker
stance and sings two sorrowful ballads
concerning the pains of losing love. On
"Lovebird," he sings of losing his only
love ("As the door closed behind her, I
opened my eyes/The pillow was emp
ty. . .Fly away lovebird. . .Now winter is
over/So am I — so am I"), and on "Love
Is a Heart Attack," he relates the throes
of love to other personal problems
("Drugs I can handle/Booze I can
quit/But giving up love, I can't take it").
This maturity is also evident in his ex
aminations of himself. On "Fallen
Angel," Entwistle sings about life's in
herent dangers in the "rock" world, giv
ing a passing nod at Keith Moon's own
death, and on the autobiographical title
track, he sums up his own life ("Too late
the hero/It all comes to zero and I — I
wish I could stop and start it again").
The only real flaw in this otherwise
excellent album is Entwistle's voice. Al
though it fits on some of the songs, it's
just too harsh and razor-edged. His
range is limited and one wishes Roger
Daltrey had been sitting in on some of
the sessions. Over all, though, with
Entwistle's bass runs and Walsh's Eagles
style guitar picking, the sound is solid
and full. It's Entwistle's finest moment
as a* solo performer. But alas, he will
have to go back to his set role with the
Who — just too late the hero, I guess.


When greatest hits packages are re
leased, I'm always a little wary. There
have been just too many greatest hits
fiascos that have been ill advised, poor
ly packaged, and artistically weak (e.g.
Sucking in the '70s by the Rolling
Stones, or Abba's Greatest Hits Vol. I, let
alone Vol II). However, these pack
ages, in spite of their flaws, have
grossed their record companies mega
bucks. It comes, therefore, as a pleasant
surprise to see a greatest hits package
that matches its music. The Who's
greatest hits, Hooligans, released on
MCA Records, is a well-planned and
thought out double album. It contains
the Who's greatest c uts in the 1970s and
is nicely packageci with some mod pic
tures. As a bonus, all the words to the
songs are included.
To begin with, though, one has the
song selection itself. The album is
basically a post-1970 greatest hits collec
tion that should appeal to both the TM
radio listener and the ardent Who fan.
Only three songs are from the '60s era in
which the Who was just known for the

ing us from these already easily ac
cessible songs, MC A could throw in
some latter day rarities.
From there we are immediately as
saulted with the prime cuts from the
Who's post-1970 mature period. In
cluded are classics from Who's Next,
/./ve at Leeds, Quadrophenia, Who By
Numbers, and Who Are You. Without a
doubt, many more songs could have
been added to this already incredible
set. We can run the gamut of the best of
I ownshend's masterpieces, and we can
see how his lyrics have progressed and
matured through the years. The naive
innocent rocker in "Bargain," who was
"looking for that free ride," has
changed into the experienced fighter
of "Slip Kid," who has come to the re
alization that "there's no easy way to be
free. . .It's a hard, hard world." The kid
who believed that the '60s could exist
into the '70s (the plea in
O'Riley": "Don't look past my shoul
der, the exodus is here, the happy ones
are near") has now changed his views in
relation to the confused events of the
'70s (the giving up attitude of "Why
should I care?" in "5:15").
The maturity of Townshend's lyrics is
equally apparent in the melodies of the
songs as well. There have never been
songs so beautiful and melodic, yet so
vengeful and angered, as "Behind Blue
Eyes." There have never been songs so
destructive, yet so hopeful for the
future, as "Drowned" (". . .I ain't seen a
sign of my heio, but I'm still diving
down for pearls"). Flowever, it is
noteworthy that in the end of all this
wide range of material, it it only love (in
whatever form) that is of true worldly
importance. For Townshend, who had
taken the blame for the tragedy at Cin
cinnati and who had a part of himself
die when Keith Moon died, it is all the
more poignant that love can still prevail
over the hardships in life. For
Townshend, love is found through mu
sic, so when one hears him sing, "Now I
go where the music fits my soul, and I
will never let go," it isn't bull. It's really
from the heart of a survivor of love.
But enough of the maturity. The lis
tener who caies enough, will decipher
all this for himself. After all, it is the mu
sic that is the t[iing. And there's a
whallop of it. In addition, three rare sin
gles and B-sides — "Let's See Action,"
"The Relay," and "Join Together" —
are thrown in for the collector, and they
too hold up well on their own (they all
are leftovers from the aborted
Townshend rock opera Lifehouse, and
all are thematic songs dealing with the
'60s ending and where does rock, as
well as life, go from there.
Overall, of course, the musicianship
is unmatchable. Not enough praise
could be said, so I won't try. Therefore,
I'll end by saying that if one had to de
fine rock and roll, I would say the Who.
The Beatles went too far beyond the
basics and made it open to all modes of
style and people (which attests to their
greatness). The Stones just went too
commercial. But for defining straight
rock, the Who wins, hands down.

I was talking to a friend of mine who
had recently become a Who fan. My
friend was really getting into all of their
music, and so I asked him what were
some of his favorite Who songs. He
mentioned of course their popular hits,
but fie also mentioned "My Wife,"
"Had Enough," "Boris, the Spider," and
"You." I then proceeded to ask him
who had written those last few songs.
He instantly answered, "Pete
Townshend, of course. Who else?" I
told him that John Entwistle had written
all of them. To which he replied, "John
who?" I guess he has a lot to learn (and
so do a lot of people) about John
Entwistle, the Who's bassist.
Therefore, Too Late the Hero, John
Entwistle's new solo album, is aptly
titled. It contains an abundance of well
done songs that occasionally approach
Who proportions. The musicians them
selves are of excellent quality as well.
Entwistle, who wrote all of the material,
shows off his already rumbling bass
along with adding a unique touch on
synthesizers and keyboards. To carry
the guitar work in the absence of Pete
Townshend, we are given Joe Walsh,
who ably fills in. Entwistle and Walsh
have been great friends ever since
Walsh's own James Gang used to open
for the Who in the early '70s, and their
compatability is fused finely. To round
out the group, Joe Vitale, the veteran
drummer, does tight drum work on all
of the songs.
Now Who fans who buy this album
might not be satisfied if they are looking
fora Who-formula album. Instead, we
are given a truly solo John Entwistle
who differs from the context of the
Who. On only one song, "I'm Coming
Back," does one get the feeling that the
Who is playing behind Entwistle, and
this is due to the Townshend-like
power chcfrding by Walsh. However,
this doesn't mean that the songs them
selves are weak in any respect. In fact,
they are quite good and they show a
more serious side to the usually lewd

and dastardly lyricist with the Who. Of
course, some of the old morbid and sin
ister persona comes through on such
songs as "Talk Dirty" and "Love Is a
FHeart Attack."
In contrast, though, many of the cuts
show a mature, reflective character
dwelling on questions of music, love,
and life. Entwistle questions his own
musical perspectives ("You talk about
music/Chopin — too square/Heavy
metal — too loud/Top Twenty — who
cares!") and puts down the darker busi
ness side inherent in the recording in
dustry ("I'm gonna spin ya round, screw
you into the ground, till I make a star
outa you").
On even more meaningful matters,
Entwistle leaves his typical rocker
stance and sings two sorrowful ballads
concerning the pains of losing love. On
"Lovebird," he sings of losing his only
love ("As the door closed behind her, I
opened my eyes/The pillow was emp
ty. . .Fly away lovebird. . .Now winter is
over/So am I — so am I"), and on "Love
Is a Heart Attack," he relates the throes
of love to other personal problems
("Drugs I can handle/Booze I can
quit/But giving up love, I can't take it").
This maturity is also evident in his ex
aminations of himself. On "Fallen
Angel," Entwistle sings about life's in
herent dangers in the "rock" world, giv
ing a passing nod at Keith Moon's own
death, and on the autobiographical title
track, he sums up his own life ("Too late
the hero/It all comes to zero and I — I
wish I could stop and start it again").
The only real flaw in this otherwise
excellent album is Entwistle's voice. Al
though it fits on some of the songs, it's
just too harsh and razor-edged. His
range is limited and one wishes Roger
Daltrey had been sitting in on some of
the sessions. Over all, though, with
Entwistle's bass runs and Walsh's Eagles
style guitar picking, the sound is solid
and full. It's Entwistle's finest moment
as a* solo performer. But alas, he will
have to go back to his set role with the
Who — just too late the hero, I guess.


When greatest hits packages are re
leased, I'm always a little wary. There
have been just too many greatest hits
fiascos that have been ill advised, poor
ly packaged, and artistically weak (e.g.
Sucking in the '70s by the Rolling
Stones, or Abba's Greatest Hits Vol. I, let
alone Vol II). However, these pack
ages, in spite of their flaws, have
grossed their record companies mega
bucks. It comes, therefore, as a pleasant
surprise to see a greatest hits package
that matches its music. The Who's
greatest hits, Hooligans, released on
MCA Records, is a well-planned and
thought out double album. It contains
the Who's greatest c uts in the 1970s and
is nicely packageci with some mod pic
tures. As a bonus, all the words to the
songs are included.
To begin with, though, one has the
song selection itself. The album is
basically a post-1970 greatest hits collec
tion that should appeal to both the TM
radio listener and the ardent Who fan.
Only three songs are from the '60s era in
which the Who was just known for the
big-nosed guitarist and sloppy drum
mer who would perform self-destructo
on their respective guitars and drum
sets. Therefore, this album is not rec
ommended for anyone seeking those
classic '60s Who numbers dealing with
angry adolescence and pubescent fan
tasies (one should seek out Meaty, Mea
ty, Big and Bouncy for those songs). I he
three songs that are dated from the '60s
all capture a period of the Who: for ear
ly maximum-rhythm-and-blues Who,
we have "I Can't Explain"; for feedback
Who, we have "I Can See for Miles"
(still, by the way, the only top ten single
by the Who); and for rock-opera Who,
p we have "Pinball Wizard."
Now somebody out there is asking
P why "My Generation" arid "See Me,
I Feel Me" aren't on this album. Well, in
; my opinion, MCA did us a favor by leav
-1 ing out those two songs. After all, if they
? were here, it would have been the fifth
£ appearance of "My Generation" on an
I album, and the seventh appearance for
1 "See Me, Feel Me." Therefore, by sav

ing us from these already easily ac
cessible songs, MC A could throw in
some latter day rarities.
