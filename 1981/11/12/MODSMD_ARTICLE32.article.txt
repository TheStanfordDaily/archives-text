# Here a Beat, there a Beat...

It's a shame that copyright
laws got in the way, for as
they demonstrated last
Wednesday night, the F.ng
lish Beat are lhe Beat as far
as everyone present was
concerned. Combining the
best from their two albums,
The Beat (as we shall call
them) performed an in
spired show where dancing
and energy were the key
elements. Their show can be
best described by the lead
singer's demand that the au
dience "keep moving, keep
moving, keep dancing!"
And indeed, dance they
did. Throughout the 90
minute show, the members
of the audience had no
choice but to move their
feet to the tantalizing ska
beat of The Beat.
After such an outstanding
performance, the opening
act, Joe "King" Carrasco
and the Crowns, are really
left in the wake of the head
liners. But although over
shadowed, Carrasco was ac
tually quite good, and dem
onstrated an excellent stage
presence as he ran through
the audience trailing his
guitar cord behind him for
everyone to trip over.
But clearly, the audience
was here for The Beat, and
Joe "King" served merely as
a warmup. The best way to
describe T he Beat is to label
them as a British two-tone
ska dance band with West
Indian influences. Now that
we've comfortably stuffed
them into a box, we can
continue. Actually, it is
more accurate to describe
their sound as reggae minus
the political blatancy and
speeded up to an irresistible
dance pace. The show
opened with the West Indi
an saxophone player Saxa
screaming out a jazz solo
backstage and then mys
teriously appearing in the
spotlight dressed in a very
African-looking outfit. The
entire band then appeared
and kicked off with a song
from their latest album,
Wha'ppen?
Easily as charismatic as

Sax a was lead singer Rank
ing Roger, who spoke in a
West Indian accent too hard
to decipher hut com
municated quite ably when
it came to his dancing. Me
shanked all over the stage
throughout the show and
would unexpectedly freeze
his position fora second ev
ery so often — just to keep
the audience on its toes.
When not singing or danc
ing, Roger would lend a
hand as a percussionist or go
out to greet the audience.
In terms of material, high
lights include "Mirror in the
Bathroom," "Two Sec
onds," "Twist and Crawl,"
and "Ranking Full Stop" off
their first alburn, I lust Can't
Stop It, in addition to two of
their few political songs, "I
am Your Flag" and "Get a
Job" off Wha'ppenf
Had they merely per
formed their songs by rote
off the records, Ihe Beat's
show would admittedly
have been boring. But that
was never the case. It was
the band's brilliant in
terspersion of sax solos, per
cussion, reverberation ef
fects, and Ranking Roger s
various catcalls and tongue
rolls that kept everyone
awake and intrigued. Addi
tionally, all these little vari
ations added an overriding
Jamaican touch to the per
formance.
What could be a better
cap to The Beat's show than
a couple of encore songs?
Well, would you believe six?
The audience simply
wanted more and more, and
The Beat were happy to
oblige. Among the six were
"Click Click," easily their
fastest song, and a climactic
"She's Too Nice to Talk To."
The latter song, found only
on a hard-to-get single, was
clearly the highlight of the
encore segment and the
performance as a whole.
During "She's Too Nice,"
Saxa's solos became surpris
ingly intense, as did Ranking
Roger's dancing.
The Cinema show ended
The Beat's entire U.S. tour,
and they ended it suitably.
But it's certainly not over for
The Beat, and when they re
turn we can only hope that
those who missed them last
Wednesday don't make the
same mistake twice.

The Fnglish Beaf
Market Street Cinema/San
Francisco
4 November 1981
It's a shame that copyright
laws got in the way, for as
they demonstrated last
Wednesday night, the F.ng
lish Beat are lhe Beat as far
as everyone present was
concerned. Combining the
best from their two albums,
The Beat (as we shall call
them) performed an in
spired show where dancing
and energy were the key
elements. Their show can be
best described by the lead
singer's demand that the au
dience "keep moving, keep
moving, keep dancing!"
And indeed, dance they
did. Throughout the 90
minute show, the members
of the audience had no
choice but to move their
feet to the tantalizing ska
beat of The Beat.
After such an outstanding
performance, the opening
act, Joe "King" Carrasco
and the Crowns, are really
left in the wake of the head
liners. But although over
shadowed, Carrasco was ac
tually quite good, and dem
onstrated an excellent stage
presence as he ran through
the audience trailing his
guitar cord behind him for
everyone to trip over.
But clearly, the audience
was here for The Beat, and
Joe "King" served merely as
a warmup. The best way to
describe T he Beat is to label
them as a British two-tone
ska dance band with West
Indian influences. Now that
we've comfortably stuffed
them into a box, we can
continue. Actually, it is
more accurate to describe
their sound as reggae minus
the political blatancy and
speeded up to an irresistible
dance pace. The show
opened with the West Indi
an saxophone player Saxa
screaming out a jazz solo
backstage and then mys
teriously appearing in the
spotlight dressed in a very
African-looking outfit. The
entire band then appeared
and kicked off with a song
from their latest album,
Wha'ppen?
