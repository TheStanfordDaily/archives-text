Shuttle launch delayed again
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Liftoff of the shuttle Colum
bia, bedeviled by technological growing pains, was
delayed until at least midmorning as launch eve work
crows grappled last night to repair an errant data relay
system.
Sunrise liftoff was impossible; the new target is 10
a.m. EST.
Countdown :o liftoff was likely to be a cliffhanger,
and there remained a strong possibility of a second
scrubbed launch in as many weeks. At nightfall, space
center spokesman Hugh Harris said "they 're working
on a fairly tight schedule — but they think it's do
able."
Replacement parts for the data relay system were
cannibalized from Challenger, a second shuttle now
being built by Rockwell International in Palmdale,
Calif., and were flown to the Kennedy Space Center
in a dramatic relay.
The parts, called "multiplexer demultiplexers," ar
rived by jet at the space shuttle's own emergency
landing strip at 9 p.m. EST, and were loaded into a
green NASA van, which then sped off tor launch pad
39A, blue light flashing and siren blaring.
Astronauts |oe Engle and Richard Truly stayed up a
little past their 5 p.m. EST bedtime to monitor the
problem and went to bed not knowing if they would
fly Thursday. "They roli with the punch pretty good,"
said their trainer, Bill Jones. "They're waiting and
ready — it's not their decision."
Launch could come anytime before 12 noon — the
final moment in Columbia's "launch window."
Palestine sell-rule talks begin
Cairo, Fgvpt — Egyptian, Israeli and U.S. nego
tiators discussed self-rule for Palestinians in Israeli
occupied lands yesterday against a backdrop of dif
ferences over the future ot Middle East peace talks.
The meeting began behind closed doors at the
Mena House Hotel near the Great Pyramids.
Earlier, Foreign minister Kamal Aly greeted the Is
raeli delegation at Cairo airport saying he hoped for
as "much progress as possible."
Israeli Interior Minister Vosef Burg replied that his
delegation was making "a serious visit to move for
ward towards success."
But neither side offered new ideas, and an Israeli of
ficial said privatelv Israel would not make any more
concessions :n the deadlocked negotiations. The talks
already are a year and a half behind schedule.
Egypt and Israel are trying to agree on the juris
diction and structure of an autonomous council to
govern the Gaza and West Bank of the Jordan River,
which Israel captured from Egypt and Jordan in the
1967 Mideast War.
Israel now is pressing Egypt to accept the much
more modest goal of signing a "memorandum of
agreement" on an autonomous council for the West

Bank and Gaza, before Israel withdraws from the Sinai
next April.

on union business, labor officials disclosed Tuesday.

Workers, are being joined by consumer activist Ralph
Nader in the suit that is to be filed today in U.S. District

Stockman criticizes Reagan
Washington — David Stockman ducked reporters
and closeted himself with his aides yesterday as both
he and President Ronald Reagan remained silent
about a magazine article in which the budget director
confided major doubts about the administration's ec
onomic program.
The December issue of Atlantic Monthly also
quotes Stockman as criticizing "supply-side" eco
nomics, complaining about "greed" and waste at the
Defense Department, confessing that Reagan could
not balance the budget, and assailing the tax-cut bill
approved by Congress.
Democrats jumped on the article as an adminis
tration admission that its economic policies are
flawed. Republicans shrugged it off as nothing more
than some honest and candid political observations.
