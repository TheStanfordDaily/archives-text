# Occupancy policy defines group responsibility

The recent decision by Norm Rob
inson, associate dean for residential
education, to suspend the Zeta Psi
(Zete) fraternity from its on-campus
residence, has sparked controversy
over the nature of collective respon
sibility â€” a justification the Univer
sity uses to take action against an en
tire house because of the actions of
some of its members.
According to Zeta Psi Vice Presi
dent Thomas Allen, "A lot of thestuff
that happens is not group-in
fluenced." Allen said he doesn't feel
the Zetes should be judged as a
house because, "nobody's barred

from joining this house."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons maintains that a fraternity must
assume collective responsibility in re
turn for its "exclusive privilege of de
ciding without cause" who may join
the group.
The codification of collective re
sponsibility, said Lyons, became in
cluded in the document Terms and
Provisions of Fraternity Occupancy,
following the 1976 suspension of the
Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity. In
the document, "House," with re
spect to persons, is defined as "all
Members of the Fraternity as a
group." The document says that any

violation of University policies, stan
dards and/or procedures shall be
cause for termination of fraternity
occupancy. "What people don't un
derstand is that we followed (that
document) to the letter," in regard to
the Zete suspension, Lyons said.
The Delt suspension stemmed
from an incident when members
damaged two other fraternity houses
following a party at the Delt House.
Charges were later filed against 12
Delts for Fundamental Standard vio
lations, but were dropped.
The Delts had been suspended in
1973-74 and were on probation in
1974-75. In his letter to the president

of the fraternity, then-Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Hortonsaid Del
ta Tau Delta had been a "chronic of
fender" and had been warned about
possible University action. Horton
wrote, "After studying all the docu
ments, present and past, and consult
ing widely, I have concluded that the
unsatisfactory nature of the present
undergraduate chapter of Delta Tau
Delta is irremediable. . . .It is un
fortunate that past members of Delta
Tau Delta and some innocent current
members or pledges may be hurt by
the collective action of the current
house, but that consequence is in
