# Occupancy policy defines group responsibility
## 
### Fran Miller 
The recent decision by Norm Rob
inson, associate dean for residential
education, to suspend the Zeta Psi
(Zete) fraternity from its on-campus
residence, has sparked controversy
over the nature of collective respon
sibility — a justification the Univer
sity uses to take action against an en
tire house because of the actions of
some of its members.
According to Zeta Psi Vice Presi
dent Thomas Allen, "A lot of thestuff
that happens is not group-in
fluenced." Allen said he doesn't feel
the Zetes should be judged as a
house because, "nobody's barred

from joining this house."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons maintains that a fraternity must
assume collective responsibility in re
turn for its "exclusive privilege of de
ciding without cause" who may join
the group.
The codification of collective re
sponsibility, said Lyons, became in
cluded in the document Terms and
Provisions of Fraternity Occupancy,
following the 1976 suspension of the
Delta Tau Delta (Delt) fraternity. In
the document, "House," with re
spect to persons, is defined as "all
Members of the Fraternity as a
group." The document says that any

violation of University policies, stan
dards and/or procedures shall be
cause for termination of fraternity
occupancy. "What people don't un
derstand is that we followed (that
document) to the letter," in regard to
the Zete suspension, Lyons said.
The Delt suspension stemmed
from an incident when members
damaged two other fraternity houses
following a party at the Delt House.
Charges were later filed against 12
Delts for Fundamental Standard vio
lations, but were dropped.
The Delts had been suspended in
1973-74 and were on probation in
1974-75. In his letter to the president

of the fraternity, then-Assoc. Dean of
Student Affairs Larry Hortonsaid Del
ta Tau Delta had been a "chronic of
fender" and had been warned about
possible University action. Horton
wrote, "After studying all the docu
ments, present and past, and consult
ing widely, I have concluded that the
unsatisfactory nature of the present
undergraduate chapter of Delta Tau
Delta is irremediable. . . .It is un
fortunate that past members of Delta
Tau Delta and some innocent current
members or pledges may be hurt by
the collective action of the current
house, but that consequence is in
herent in the notion of collective re
sponsibility."
In retrospect the facts surrounding
this controversy seem like a case of
deja vu.
At the time of the Delt suspension,
the ASSU expressed "grave concern
over the absence of a judicial pro
ceeding to determine whether the
group should be held responsible."
Robinson said there is an impor
tant distinction between judicial and
administrative decisions and be
tween rights and privileges. He said
the recent decision to take away the
Zetes' house was an administrative
one. "I'm responsible for making the
decision about the allocation of resi
dences," he said. "And I happen to
think the treatment was fair."
Referring to the ad hoc committee
which Robinson appointed to review
the Zete matter — the main bone of
contention in the controversy —
Robinson -said that he didn't know
"where the term ad hoc committee
came from. I was just looking for
people to consult who understand
residence's roles, whom I respect,
and who wouldn't have to be
educated about the goals of residen
tial education."
He said instead of consulting them
individually, he asked them to meet
collectively. Lyons noted, "the ad
hoc committee is not a real issue.
(Robinson) was not obligated to con
sult anyone."
Allen said the fraternity is upset

over the ad hoc committee set up by
Robinson because, "It was a rigged
decision. (Robinson) was trying to
appear to be fair. They can't justify
three years. I could see a two-quarter
suspension. We're not the same
house that we were in 1977."
With regard to the Student Con
duct Legislative Council (SCLC)
which met Tuesday at the request of
the ASSU and other student groups
who were concered over the lack
and/or incomplete nature of Univer
sity policies for dealing with student
groups, Lyons said, "There's a ten
dency to act without looking into it
(the issue). If the committee (SCLC) is
trying to find a policy to set down the
responsibilities of groups and the
University, there already is one."
He said that the University has
what he called "common sense fair
procedure." This means, he said,
communicating with the fraternity
that you don't approve of a certain
type of behavior, establishing that
the behavior is wrong and warning it
that its privileges as a group will be
revoked unless it lives up to its re
sponsibilities to the University.
Lyons said the fraternity is aware of
the appeals process. Since the de
cision was administrative, he said,
there is an administrative chain of re
view, namely Lyons and then Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy. Both
Lyons and Kennedy have said that
they are unlikely to reverse Rob
inson's decision.
