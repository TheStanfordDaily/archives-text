# Universities, graduate schools fight for prime applicants
## Graduate positions within reach for students here

Though ex-Stanford under
graduates tend to be represented
in relatively large numbers in
Stanford professional schools (i.e.
law, business, medicine and
education), graduate school
spokespersons deny that this
phenomenon indicates preferen
tial treatment.
The Medical School, for exam
ple, admits a significantly higher
proportion of Stanford and
Harvard students than students
from other schools, according to
Cheryl LoMaglio, administrative
assistant to the Committee on Ad
missions. But, it should be remem
bered that undergraduates from
Stanford and Harvard comprise a
larger share of the applicant pool,
said LoMaglio.
The Med School denies having
any special criteria for Stanford
undergraduates. Admissions de
cisions are made on the basis of
Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT) scores, a student's grade
point average (GPA), a letter of
recommendation and evidence of
research.
This year about 12 percent of
the accepted applicants (169 total
offers) were Stanford under
graduates, said LoMaglio. She said
the number is usually between 10
and 15 percent.

Stanford students who actually
matriculated accounted for 14
percent of the 86 places, a higher
than usual figure, said LoMaglio.
"Over the past few years many
went elsewhere." She said Stan
ford matriculates made up seven
percent of each entering class for
the past two years and 10 percent
three years ago.
The various professional
schools, education, law, business
and medicine, do not have under
graduate programs, and thus their
admissions policies generally do
not differentiate between Stan
ford and non-Stanford under
graduates, as is the case in some
departments. These schools rely
on GPAs, test scores, and letters of
recommendation.
"(Whether an applicant was a
Stanford undergraduate) makes
no difference whatsoever," said
Gary Williams, assistant dean of
the Graduate School of Business
and director of the MBA program.
The typical student in the
School of Education has been
working five to 10 years, said
Myron Atkin, dean of the School
of Education. The school enrolls
450 students, 30 percent of whom
are foreign. Atkin said that few
undergraduates go directly to the
education school, except those
