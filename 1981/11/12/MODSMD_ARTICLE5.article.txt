# Universities, graduate schools fight for prime applicants
## Graduate positions within reach for students here 
### Cathy Janus 
Though ex-Stanford under
graduates tend to be represented
in relatively large numbers in
Stanford professional schools (i.e.
law, business, medicine and
education), graduate school
spokespersons deny that this
phenomenon indicates preferen
tial treatment.
The Medical School, for exam
ple, admits a significantly higher
proportion of Stanford and
Harvard students than students
from other schools, according to
Cheryl LoMaglio, administrative
assistant to the Committee on Ad
missions. But, it should be remem
bered that undergraduates from
Stanford and Harvard comprise a
larger share of the applicant pool,
said LoMaglio.
The Med School denies having
any special criteria for Stanford
undergraduates. Admissions de
cisions are made on the basis of
Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT) scores, a student's grade
point average (GPA), a letter of
recommendation and evidence of
research.
This year about 12 percent of
the accepted applicants (169 total
offers) were Stanford under
graduates, said LoMaglio. She said
the number is usually between 10
and 15 percent.

Stanford students who actually
matriculated accounted for 14
percent of the 86 places, a higher
than usual figure, said LoMaglio.
"Over the past few years many
went elsewhere." She said Stan
ford matriculates made up seven
percent of each entering class for
the past two years and 10 percent
three years ago.
The various professional
schools, education, law, business
and medicine, do not have under
graduate programs, and thus their
admissions policies generally do
not differentiate between Stan
ford and non-Stanford under
graduates, as is the case in some
departments. These schools rely
on GPAs, test scores, and letters of
recommendation.
"(Whether an applicant was a
Stanford undergraduate) makes
no difference whatsoever," said
Gary Williams, assistant dean of
the Graduate School of Business
and director of the MBA program.
The typical student in the
School of Education has been
working five to 10 years, said
Myron Atkin, dean of the School
of Education. The school enrolls
450 students, 30 percent of whom
are foreign. Atkin said that few
undergraduates go directly to the
education school, except those

who participate in the Stanford
Teacher Education Program. STEP
leads to it California teaching license,
which, under reciprocity arrange
ments, is accepted by other states.
"We encourage undergraduates to
apply, including Stanford under
graduates," said Atkin. FHe said that
Stanford students with strong rec
ords are especially sought after. The
program, which begins in June and
ends the following june, is com
prised of 50 percent Stanford under
graduates, said Atkin.
The Law School treats Stanford ap
plicants like everyone else. Professor
Jack Friedenthal, Law School pro
fessor. said about 10 percent of the
students in the program were Stan
ford undergraduates. "We take in
the best qualified students," he said,
and"in a given year the percentage

could rise or fall — it varies."
Friedenthal said Stanford under
graduates represent some of the best
students in the world, so naturally
some will be admitted to the Law
School. However, grade inflation
hurts Stanford students to some ex
tent, he said. "The GPA at Stanford is
the highest of any school inthecoun
try as far as I know, and no school suf
fers from grade inflation as we do,"
said Friedenthal. In his view, most
people here earn roughly a 3.4 or
better. Thus, when a Stanford stu
dent applies to graduate schools, he
may rank in the 70th percentile and
have a 3.7 GPA, while a student from
another school with a lower GPA may
get a break because he is in the 80th
percentile.
While Friedenthal said the Law
School tries to adjust for this grade in
flation, other schools don't, thus
hurting our students.

The Medical School, for exam
ple, admits a significantly higher
proportion of Stanford and
Harvard students than students
from other schools, according to
Cheryl LoMaglio, administrative
assistant to the Committee on Ad
missions. But, it should be remem
bered that undergraduates from
Stanford and Harvard comprise a
larger share of the applicant pool,
said LoMaglio.
The Med School denies having
any special criteria for Stanford
undergraduates. Admissions de
cisions are made on the basis of
Medical College Admissions Test
(MCAT) scores, a student's grade
point average (GPA), a letter of
recommendation and evidence of
research.
This year about 12 percent of
the accepted applicants (169 total
offers) were Stanford under
graduates, said LoMaglio. She said
the number is usually between 10
and 15 percent.

Stanford students who actually
matriculated accounted for 14
percent of the 86 places, a higher
than usual figure, said LoMaglio.
"Over the past few years many
went elsewhere." She said Stan
ford matriculates made up seven
percent of each entering class for
the past two years and 10 percent
three years ago.
The various professional
schools, education, law, business
and medicine, do not have under
graduate programs, and thus their
admissions policies generally do
not differentiate between Stan
ford and non-Stanford under
graduates, as is the case in some
departments. These schools rely
on GPAs, test scores, and letters of
recommendation.
"(Whether an applicant was a
Stanford undergraduate) makes
no difference whatsoever," said
Gary Williams, assistant dean of
the Graduate School of Business
and director of the MBA program.
The typical student in the
School of Education has been
working five to 10 years, said
Myron Atkin, dean of the School
of Education. The school enrolls
450 students, 30 percent of whom
are foreign. Atkin said that few
undergraduates go directly to the
education school, except those

who participate in the Stanford
Teacher Education Program. STEP
leads to it California teaching license,
which, under reciprocity arrange
ments, is accepted by other states.
"We encourage undergraduates to
apply, including Stanford under
graduates," said Atkin. FHe said that
Stanford students with strong rec
ords are especially sought after. The
program, which begins in June and
ends the following june, is com
prised of 50 percent Stanford under
graduates, said Atkin.
The Law School treats Stanford ap
plicants like everyone else. Professor
Jack Friedenthal, Law School pro
fessor. said about 10 percent of the
students in the program were Stan
ford undergraduates. "We take in
the best qualified students," he said,
and"in a given year the percentage

could rise or fall — it varies."
Friedenthal said Stanford under
graduates represent some of the best
students in the world, so naturally
some will be admitted to the Law
School. However, grade inflation
hurts Stanford students to some ex
tent, he said. "The GPA at Stanford is
the highest of any school inthecoun
try as far as I know, and no school suf
fers from grade inflation as we do,"
said Friedenthal. In his view, most
people here earn roughly a 3.4 or
better. Thus, when a Stanford stu
dent applies to graduate schools, he
may rank in the 70th percentile and
have a 3.7 GPA, while a student from
another school with a lower GPA may
get a break because he is in the 80th
percentile.
While Friedenthal said the Law
School tries to adjust for this grade in
flation, other schools don't, thus
hurting our students.
