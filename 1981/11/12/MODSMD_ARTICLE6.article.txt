# Competition still high for undergraduates

Stanford and other top universities may be compet
ing with each other more than ever for the same stu
dents despite the record or near-record numbers of
applicants they have been receiving in recent years,
according to John Bunnell, acting dean of admissions
in Dean Fred Hargadon's absence.
"I was struck when I was traveling back East by
counselors' comments that students seem to be ap
plying to more schools. That raises our numbers, the
number of students applying to Harvard, and the
numbers to other schools like that. But the number of
students applying to these schools is the same," he
said.
Studies prepared each year by the Admissions Of
fice and the Office of Management and Budget here
have shown that three out of four students declining
the University's offer of admission opt for private
schools of similar cost.
Harvard-Radcliffe, Yale and Princeton are the Uni
versity's principal competitors, according to the stud
ies.
Both Stanford and Harvard, for example, are receiv
ing more applications from the other coast in recent
years. More than 2030 students from the New England
and Middle Atlantic states applied to Stanford last
year. Similarly, Harvard received more applications
from California (1400) than in any other year in its his
tory.
Stanford's admissions office was deluged with a
record-breaking 14,029 applicants last year. This fig
ure is just the last of a series of record numbers of ap
plicants which have jumped by about 1000 every year
since 1978. Starting from the 9900 that had applied for
1977-78, the figures have risen in successive years
from 10,920, then to 11,787, and finally to 12,731 the
year before last.
Other prestigious schools have been experiencing
comparably large numbers of applicants lately de
spite a projected national decline of more than 20

percent in the number of high school graduates over
the next decade.
Despite what may be increased competitiveness
between top universities, consistently 62-65 percent
of Stanford's accepted applicants have chosen to
come here. This ratio is second only to Harvard's 75
percent annual enrollment.
Yale, by comparison last year enrolled 59 percent of
its accepted applicants, while at Princeton 55 percent
of the applicants offered admission enrolled.
However, Hargadon has cautioned before against
using the so-called "yield rate" as an indication of a
school's quality.
"We could have a yield of 100 percent if we ad
mitted the bottom 1500 candidates. Anyone who tries
to rank the top universities is foolish," he has said.
Probably the most popular method used for com
paring the top universities is the national yardstick —
the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) — because it can be
most easily summarized. Hargadon said that "because
of repeated claims by critics of tests that tests play the
greatest role in college admission," he releases a
breakdown of SAT scores of the incoming class each
year.
The SAT distribution of this year's freshman class
was as follows: on the verbal, 91 percent scored above
500, 57 percent above 600, 16 percent above 700; on
the math, 96 percent scored above 500, 79 percent
above 600, and 35 percent above 700.
Vale's freshman class, by comparison, had on the
verbal 95 percent above 500, 79 percent above 600,
and 36 percent above 700; on the math, 97 percent
were above 500, 84 percent above 600, and 45 percent
above 700.
Princeton's averages were similar to Yale's: 94 per
cent above 500, 71 percent above 600, and 29 percent
above 700 on the verbal; and 98 percent above 500, 83
percent above 600, and 46 percent above 700 on the
math.
