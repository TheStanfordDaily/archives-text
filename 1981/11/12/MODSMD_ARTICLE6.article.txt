# Competition still high for undergraduates

Stanford and other top universities may be compet
ing with each other more than ever for the same stu
dents despite the record or near-record numbers of
applicants they have been receiving in recent years,
according to John Bunnell, acting dean of admissions
in Dean Fred Hargadon's absence.
"I was struck when I was traveling back East by
counselors' comments that students seem to be ap
plying to more schools. That raises our numbers, the
number of students applying to Harvard, and the
numbers to other schools like that. But the number of
students applying to these schools is the same," he
said.
Studies prepared each year by the Admissions Of
fice and the Office of Management and Budget here
have shown that three out of four students declining
the University's offer of admission opt for private
schools of similar cost.
Harvard-Radcliffe, Yale and Princeton are the Uni
versity's principal competitors, according to the stud
ies.
Both Stanford and Harvard, for example, are receiv
ing more applications from the other coast in recent
years. More than 2030 students from the New England
and Middle Atlantic states applied to Stanford last
year. Similarly, Harvard received more applications
from California (1400) than in any other year in its his
tory.
Stanford's admissions office was deluged with a
record-breaking 14,029 applicants last year. This fig
ure is just the last of a series of record numbers of ap
plicants which have jumped by about 1000 every year
since 1978. Starting from the 9900 that had applied for
1977-78, the figures have risen in successive years
from 10,920, then to 11,787, and finally to 12,731 the
year before last.
Other prestigious schools have been experiencing
comparably large numbers of applicants lately de
spite a projected national decline of more than 20

percent in the number of high school graduates over
the next decade.
Despite what may be increased competitiveness
between top universities, consistently 62-65 percent
of Stanford's accepted applicants have chosen to
come here. This ratio is second only to Harvard's 75
percent annual enrollment.
Yale, by comparison last year enrolled 59 percent of
its accepted applicants, while at Princeton 55 percent
of the applicants offered admission enrolled.
However, Hargadon has cautioned before against
using the so-called "yield rate" as an indication of a
school's quality.
"We could have a yield of 100 percent if we ad
mitted the bottom 1500 candidates. Anyone who tries
to rank the top universities is foolish," he has said.
Probably the most popular method used for com
paring the top universities is the national yardstick —
the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) — because it can be
most easily summarized. Hargadon said that "because
of repeated claims by critics of tests that tests play the
greatest role in college admission," he releases a
breakdown of SAT scores of the incoming class each
year.
The SAT distribution of this year's freshman class
was as follows: on the verbal, 91 percent scored above
500, 57 percent above 600, 16 percent above 700; on
the math, 96 percent scored above 500, 79 percent
above 600, and 35 percent above 700.
Vale's freshman class, by comparison, had on the
verbal 95 percent above 500, 79 percent above 600,
and 36 percent above 700; on the math, 97 percent
were above 500, 84 percent above 600, and 45 percent
above 700.
Princeton's averages were similar to Yale's: 94 per
cent above 500, 71 percent above 600, and 29 percent
above 700 on the verbal; and 98 percent above 500, 83
percent above 600, and 46 percent above 700 on the
math.
The source for the figures on Yale
and Princeton is the 1981 edition of
ComparativeCuide to American Col
leges.
Stanford's average SAT verbal
scores are somewhat lower than
either Princeton's or Yale's, while the
math averages remain close.
Bunnell, however, doesn't con
sider the difference between the av
erage scores for the three schools as
significant. "Once you get up in
those ranges, a spread of ten or so
points isn't that distinguishing."
In 1979 a report by Alexander Astin
and Lewis Solomon of the Higher
'Education Research Institute showed
a drop in rank for Stanford over a 16
year period with respect to average
SAT's. This was a cause for concern
for some faculty members, according
to Bunnell, but for he and others it

seemed limiting "to try to equate
selectivity or overall quality of a
school with average test scores
alone."
As to the use of SAT's in ad
missions, Bunnell commented that
"SAT's purport to measure aptitude
and have some relationship to 'IQ,'
but we are also concerned with 'I
will,' that is, the motivation of the in
dividual applicant. It is hard to quan
tify one's intellectual curiosity, drive,
or determination."
"The test was administered last Sat
urday morning, and I heard a news
caster state that for many 17 and 18
years olds, 'their college futures were
being decided today," said Bunnell.
"We have to get away from the no
tion that one's performance on a sin
gle test will be the sole determinant
of where that student will spend the
next four years of his or her life."
