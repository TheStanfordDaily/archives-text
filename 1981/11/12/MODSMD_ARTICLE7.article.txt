## Castro denies troop reports 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Cuban Presi
dent Fidel Castro denied in an
unusual letter to The Washing
ton Post reports of the pres.
ence of Cuban troops in
Nicaragua.
The letter stated that these
reports are part of a "campaign
of falsehood and lies" by the
U.S. government "aimed at set
ting the stage" for aggressive
U.S. actions against Cuba.
In a two-page letter to the
editor received by the Post
Tuesday, Castro denounced a
report of Oct. 19 by syndicated
columnists Rowland Evans and
Robert Novak reporting that
some 500 to 600 elite Cuban
troops were flown secretly to
Nicaragua in mid-September.
Castro also said that the United
States had informed "third
countries" that it had proof of
Cuban troop activities in
Nicaragua without responding
to Cuban demands that it re
lease evidence to support the
charge.
The column, published in
The Post and other news
papers, speculated that the
Cubans were aimed at setting
up a revolutionary Marxist gov
ernment in eastern El Salvador

and have been involved in sab
otage activity.
The Cuban leader's letter re
flected Cuban resentment at
statements made by Secretary
of State 'Vlexander Haig that

the Reagan administration is
considering military action
againt Cuba or Nicaragua be
cause of those countries' al
leged support of leftist guer
rillas in El Salvador.
