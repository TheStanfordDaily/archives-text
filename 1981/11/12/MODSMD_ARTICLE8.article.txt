# Pakistanis see US F-16s as key to stronger role in region
## 
### Washington Post 
Islamabad, Pakistan — The
sale of F-16 fighter-bombers
has grown here into a major
test of the Reagan adminis
tration's commitment to Paki
stan in the same way that the
AWACS sale took on special
significance for Saudi Arabia,
according to a wide spectrum
of Pakistani and diplomatic
sources.
If Congress does not ap
prove the sale, diplomatic
sources and Pakistani officials
are certain that the newly re
juvenated strategic link be
tween the United States and
Pakistan will fall apart, almost
before it takes root.
The $3.2 billion economic
aid and military sales package,
along with a separate $1.1
billion sale of 40 F-T6s, have
been approved by the Senate
and await a vote in the House,
where there is some opposi
tion to the fighter sale.
Anti-Soviet
The Reagan administration

has made Pakistan the eastern
anchor of what Secretary of
State Alexander Haig has c ailed
"a strategic consensus" to con
front the Soviet Union. The
swath stretches in an arc from
Pakistan, through the oil-rich
Arab nations of the Persian
Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, to
Israel, Egypt and lurkey in the
west.
Pakistan's president, Gen.
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, re
fused in September to agree to
the deal with the United States
unless there was an accelerated
delivery schedule for at least
some of the F-16s.
The Reagan administration
has agreed to have six of the
fighters delivered within 12
months, although due to a lack
of ground support equipment,
their use will be limitecJ to six to
eight hours' flight time a
month.
Possible deterrent
Besides symbolizing their
new relationship with Wash

ington, Pakistanis see the F-16
as a deterrent to what have be
come frequent violations of
their airspace by Soviet jets
from neighboring Afghanistan
that cannot now be stopped by
the antiquated planes of Paki
stan's Air Force.
Neighboring India has
vehemently opposed the sale,
saying it will alter the regional
balance of power. However,
India has the fourth-largest mil
itary force in the world and is
continuing expenditures, in
cluding a Si .63 billion deal with
the Soviets last year and one in
progress with France for 150
Mirage 2000 warplanes.
Originally, Pakistan said the
$1.1 billion cost of the two
squadrons of 40 F-16s would be
borne by their "Islamic
friends" — widely believed to
be Saudi Arabia. Now Ameri
can officials acknowledge that
at least some of the money will
have to come from the U.S. mil
itary sales credits.
