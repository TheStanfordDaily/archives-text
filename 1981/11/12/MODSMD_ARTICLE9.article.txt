# Reagan-backed African autocrats face mounting unrest, economic problems
## Nimeiri in Sudan 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Sudan's Pres
ident Gaafar Nimeiri has fired his entire
Cabinet, devalued the Sudanese pound
and sharply reduced food subsidies,
thus submitting to harsh economic
measures such as those prescribed for
Third World countries by the Reagan
administration.
The economic changes, announced
early this week, could lead to political
unrest in this East African country,
which has become an increasingly im
portant element in U.S. global strategy
since the assassination of Egyptian lead
er Anwar Sadat. The measures are part
of the terms set by the International
Monetary Eund for Sudan to receive
about $230 million in IMF assistance.
The United States, however, is ex
pected to heed the politics of the situ
ation and bend some of its self-reliance
rhetoric to keep the shaky Sudanese
economy afloat with increased bilateral
aid to Khartoum.
"Aid is a great shell game," a Western

iliplm.it said during an interview recent
ly in Khartoum. "The IMF is taking with
one hand under a U.S. policy while the
United States is giving with the other."
President Ronald Reagan lias urged
Third World nations to lessen their re
liance on aid progtarns and instead use
"the magic of the marketplace" to
boost free-enterprise economies.
Sudan already receives more U.S. as :
sistance ttuii any other nation in black
Africa — $215 million in economic and
military aid — but diplomats and private
finaru ial sources expect the amount to
increase.
Nimeiri's military government lias
been the taiget of countless coup at
tempts since it took power in 1969.1 wo
years ago there were serious riots in
Khartoum after food price increases.
Nimeiri's announcement that sub
sidies on petroleum and c ooking oil will
be ended immediately and that those
on sugar and wheat will be phased out
could bp just that spark.
Sugar, consumed in vast quantities by

Sudanese, now costs less than 10 cents a
pound. Without the subsidy it will be JO
cents a pound.
The impact of the devaluation on the
price of wheat, the food of the urban
middle class, will be even greater since
most grain is imported.
Nimeiri has ordered his ministers to
remain in their positions until a new
government can be formed, so the ef
fect of the shake-up may take some
time to determine.
"I he IMF plan will help the Sudanese
in the long run if they can survive the
cure," said Joe Gunn, a Washington
based economist whose work in Khar
toum involves foreign aid programs.
The purpose of cutting subsidies and
devaluation is to reduce the country's
40 percent inflation rate and huge bal
ance-of-payments deficit.
"With the increased political interest
in Sudan, it would be a reasonable line
of speculation to expect increased U.S.
aid" to Khartoum, a U.S. source said.
