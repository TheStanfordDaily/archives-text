RESPONSE TO
RECENT CAMPUS RAPES
November 13,1981
FACTS:
Since October 1, 1981, five members of the Stanford community have been the
victims of sexual assaults ranging from molesting to forceable rape. Four of the five
assaults have occurred within the last eight days. Two assaults occurred in isolated
areas near the Stanford stadium and adjacent eucalyptus groves; the remaining
three took place in the academic areas in and around White Plaza and the Main
Quad. The attacks happened during the late morning and early evening hours. In
two instances, perfectly ordinary non-threatening conversation took place between
the assailant and the victim before the attack occurred.
TIPS:
DON'T PANIC. CONTINUE TO LIVE YOUR LIFE AND USE COMMON SENSE.
Keep jogging and find others to run with. Keep going to the library at night; when
you leave call SURE (497-3217), use dorm escort sen/ices, or ask friends to walk
with you. Go to and from night meetings or classes with others, following the
"Suggested Walk Routes," a map distributed in registration packets and available
from the Department of Public Safety. Avoid isolated places, day or night. Reread
the safety brochure that was in registration packets (extra copies also available
from the Department of Public Safety). Buy a loud and sturdy whistle and carry it
with you. Keep room and building doors locked at all times.
CALL 911 OR PULL A FIRE ALARM BOX IF YOU SUSPECT DANGER.
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS. If you are afraid, run, yell, or create a commotion. Don't
worry about being rude. Experience has shown that assault victims who fight back
increase their chances of avoiding rape. Use your own good judgment, however
— sometimes it's best to give in.
EMERGENCY NUMBERS:
Report all incidents to the Police. For police or Medical Response dial 911. Women
officers or counselors are available.
In four of the cases the assailant is described as a young (18-22) Black male,
approximately 5'10", 150 lbs., muscular build. In the fifth case, there were two
assailants of unknown descriptions.
The Department of Public Safety has increased plainsclothes police patrols on
campus in an effort to catch the assailants and increase campus safety.
REMEMBER THE DESCRIPTION OF THE RAPIST. Realize that the description of
the Black assailant is a general one; don't generalize or stereotype, but do
exercise caution. Also realize that we don't have physical descriptions for the two
assailants responsible for the most recent rape.
REPORT ALL RAPES AND RAPE ATTEMPTS. Even if you want to remain
anonymous, the Police need information in order to protect others. Pass on any
information you may have to the Police (911) or to Sylvia Castillo in the Dean of
Student Affairs Office (497-2733).
TAKE THIS COMMUNITY PROBLEM SERIOUSLY. Discuss with your fellow
students how best to help and support each other without reinforcing stereotypes
of weak and helpless women. Volunteer to be a SURE escort. Be alert to helping
others as well as being personally sensible and cautious.
