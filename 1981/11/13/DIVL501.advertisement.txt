It is hard to talk about rape. Although those of us working on the recent program tried
to approach the subject with high energy and hope for the future, organizers and
participants found ourselves dealing with a lot of fear, anger and grief.
During hard times the support of the community can give much comfort.
The broad range of financial support was often mentioned during the week as an
outward sign of this community's concern. The organizers and participants ask that
the following individuals and departments accept our gratitude.
