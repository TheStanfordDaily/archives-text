Overconung the
Crises of Adult Life

Vour Own Path
to VM-Being
Over four years in the research and writing,
Pathfinders, is the new landmark work that goes
beyond the author's phenomenal bestseller, Pas
sages. It poses and answers the crucial question:
Why do some of us successfully overcome life's
crises while others do not? To find the answers, Ms.
Sheehy reached sixty thousand men and women
who completed her extensive life history question
naire. She crossed thirty-eight states, interviewed
hundreds of people of all ages and backgrounds, to
winnow out the true Pathfinders, people whose
lives reflect a high degree of well-being who come
through an adult passage or crisis in a creative and
expanding way, who are willing to take risks and
who do not fear change. Through interviews,
analysis, case histories, and example, the author
shows that the qualities of personality that fortify
Pathfinders in seeking uncommon solutions to
common life crises are qualities all of us have. And
she explains, too, how each of us can become
Pathfinders in our own lives.
Gail Sheehy lives in New York.
