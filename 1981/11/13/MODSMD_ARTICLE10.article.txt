## A
						party inside a human body 
### Dan Turner 
Last Saturday night the white fraternity house
at 550 Lausen vanished and in its place was a hu
man body. This was the result of several weeks
the Sigma Chi pledges spent planning and build
ing for the annual Sigma Chi Pledge Party.
The party represents the culmination of Sigma
Chi social activities for the fall quarter. Each year,
the pledges spend over $1000 of the fraternity's
dues to decorate the house in accordance with
some specific theme. This year, the theme was
"the human body."
By 7 p.m. on Nov. 6, every active member of
the fraternity had left the house, asked by the
pledges not to return for another 26 hours. At
the end of that time, the residence was to be
come "an entity."
The engineer of the project was sophomore
pledge Phil Chalk, who came up with the idea of
the human body and coordinated the efforts to
accomplish it.
"We don't do much else this quarter, so ev
erybody in the frat thirstily awaits the big pledge
party," said Chalk.
The party was open only to fraternity mem
bers and their dates, and the Sigma Chi "Little
Sisters" — a group of female students who help
coordinate house activities. Guests were asked
to come dressed as objects that pass through or
have to do with the human body, and the cos
tumes turned out to be as varied and bizarre as
the party itself, with such disguises as white
blood cells, bacteria, Q-tips, tape worms,
hypodermic needles, toothpaste, One-a-Day
capsules and gangrene.
At the front door guests were asked to remove
their shoes and climb up the fire escape to the
house's third floor, where they found them
selves confronted by an enormous papier
rnache ear surrounding the entranceway. From
then on, it was like a scene out of Fantastic Voy
age. The sounds of a heartbeat echoed through
out, and at every turn wasa different sight, smell
or texture.
Hallways throughout the house were covered
with paper that was draped over ropes to form
rounded tunnels. The floors of these tunnels
were covered with "mucus," a mixture of flour
and water just slimy enough to make one hope
that the pledges hadn't gone too far in their
quest for realism.
The house's entire third floor was designed to
represent the inside of a human head. After pass
ing two television sets representing eye lenses as

seen from the inside, one arrived at the nose.
This was a small room with "cilia" (grey string)
hanging from the ceiling, inside of which were
bowls of tortilla chips and guacamole dip.
After entering the mouth, guests were "swal
lowed" by falling down an 18-foot slide to the
floor below. This floor represented the upper
body, and contained such parts as an armpit,
lungs and an enormous mammary gland where
kahlua and milk was being served.
Lee Gregg, a Sigma Chi active, observed: "The
pledges this year did a great job . . . it's very
creative and slimy," said Gregg. "I went in my
room (the nose) and didn't even know where I
was."
At last, the guests reached the ultimate goal on
the ground floor — the stomach. The floor of the
room was coated entirely with popcorn, and a
few oversized vegetables leaned against the
walls. Here they spent the remainder of the eve
ning dancing to a band.
Parties in the past have been equally
elaborate. Two years ago, the theme was
'Pirates." The pledges built a lagoon in their
lounge, fed by a waterfall from above.
Last year's theme was "Space," with each
room representing a different planet. Other
themes have been: a "Medieval Castle" party, in
which various barnyard animals were left to
roam the upper floors, a "Sewer" party, and a
"Heaven and Hell" party.
In order to accomplish the body party, the
pledges had to hold several weekly meetings
and brainstorming sessions.
Initially, the pledges had hoped to get their
party televised. Frat members contacted the
ABC-TV series That's Incredible several days
before the party but were informed that the
series simply didn't have enough time to cover
it.
Chalk commented on some of the technical
problems: "In the past they've had flat strctures
made of wood and nails. Our constructions were
tubular, which posed all kinds of problems."
"I think the party was a great success . . . any
thing would be if yftu gave a bunch of college
students a thousand bucks to play around with,"
said Chalk.
But money is far from the only thing that made
the body party a success. The house's
metamorphosis involved a great deal of creative
thinking, along with dozens of isolated feats of
artistic genius.
