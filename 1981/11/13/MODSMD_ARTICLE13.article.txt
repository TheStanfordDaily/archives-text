The unique opportunity to experience various dance
styles through many different teachers is being offered this
quarter by the Stanford Dance Division's Open-Gate series
— a series of dance master classes with guest artists who
teach many different techniques.
The program started this quarter, offering a master class
every Friday afternoon in Roble Gym Dance Studio. Inga
Weiss, director of the Stanford Dance Division, described it
as. .an exchange with the outer world of dance." So far,
it has successfully hosted several different artists.
The Open-Gate series has received enthusiastic response
from students, faculty, off-campus participants and the
teachers themselves. Each Friday afternoon, some of the
finest dancers in the Bay Area are brought to Stanford.
"Roble studio is alive with new blood, ai'id it also gives us
the opportunity to experience the work of artists who are
graduates of theStanford dance program. With Daniel
Nagrin coming this month, New York — which seems so far
away — is even coming to us!" said Kim Morris, an M.A.
student in dance here.
The purpose of the program is "to give dance students a
breadth of experience with different teachers and different
styles," said Jancy Limpert of the Stanford dance faculty.
The remainder of this quarter holds much in store. Today,
Aaron Osborne, originally from the Jose Limone Company,
will be here. Jim Coleman from the Bill Evans studio in
Seattle will arrive nextg Friday, Nov. 20. Finally, Daniel
Nagrin will becoming Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 to teach a master
class and a lecture-demonstration.
Nagrin is one of the pioneers of modern dance, having
studied with Martha Graham and Hanya Holm. He was the
co-director of the Tamiris-Nagrin Dance Company with his
wife Helen Tamiris, and was a featured dancer on Broadway
in the 1950s who received the Donaldson award for Best
Male Dancer in the season of 1954-55. Today, he continues
to dance actively in both company and solo recitals in the
United States and abroad.
Other upcoming activities sponsored by the Stanford
Dance Quorum will include two improvisation workshops
with cellist Gwendolyn Watson. Watson's main interest is
combining music with dance so as to inspire artists in both
of these disciplines.
