## Viewpoint/Alex Dragnich Yugoslavs face crossroads 
### 
Yugoslavs are grumbling and are
convinced that their country is ap
proaching a critical crossroad. Since
Tito's death, several problem areas
have gotten worse, adding to the
frustrations of the populace.
"Tito should have lived another 10
years, so that he could have seen the
real consequence of his policies!" So
said a former highly-placed Yugoslav
Communist Party member during a
recent conversation with me in Bel
grade.
After Tito's death, the Yugoslav
leadership assured the people that all
was well, that the old marshal had left
the country in good shape. The real
situation today is a far cry from op
timistic assessment. The political
structure is fragile. None of the col
lective presidency's members has
any significant number of supporters
behind him. The eight geographic
units that they represent are domi
nated by oligarchic bureacracies.
The economy is deteriorating. The
inflation rate is 52 percent now and
many predict it will be as high as 80
percent by the end of 1981.
In the foreign policy field, many
Yugoslavs are wondering whether
Tito's nonalignment policy will pro
tect them from outside in
terferences, particularly Soviet,
either direct or more likely through a
surrogate. Most Yugoslavs that I
spoke with believed the Soviets had
"their fingers" in the recent dis
turbances in Kosovo.
Tito's nationality policy for Yugo
slavia, formulated in his Comintern
years, envisioned a multiple-unit
country. The main objective of this
policy was to weaken the Serbs, the
largest ethnic component in the
state. When Tito came to power at
the end of World War 11, Yugoslavia
was divided intosix republics (Serbia,
Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-
Hercegovins, Montenegro,
Macedonia), with a significant

number of Serbs in each of the other
republics except Slovenia. The main
cause of the present troubles in
Kosovo is the systematic forcing of
Serbs out of the province of Kosovo,
which is the cradle of the old Serbian
empire of the middle ages.
Evidence abounds that the econo
my is in trouble. In addition to the
high inflation rate, there are per
sistent shortages. Newspapers re
ported that power shortages were
occurring for the first time in the
summertime, and asserted that limi
tations on electrical use will be in ef
fect by fall.
Many factories are operating less
than full time, resulting in smaller
paychecks for the workers. A friend
of mine explained it this way: "We
thought that we could be a little

Japan, importing raw materials and
exporting manufactured goods. But
we discovered that we could not
compete successfully with Western
European countries. Moreover, our
currency is not convertible, so
without hard currency earnings from
abroad, we cannot import the things
we need."
Adding to Yugoslavia's economic
woes is the high cost of imported oil,
as well as its loans to Third World
countries, many of which are in de
fault. There is no hiding the fact that
the standard of living has fallen in the
past two or three years by some 7 to
10 percent.
Thus far the regime has not come

forth with any concrete program for
dealing with the country's economic
difficulties, except to issue general
proclamations on the need to fight
inflation, to produce more and to
consume less. The only concrete step
suggested while I was there — one
which Slovenia and Croatia had not
yet agreed — was to stem the outflow
of hard currency by Yugoslavs trav
elling abroad. This was to be done by
imposing a tax on every trip taken
abroad.
The press abounds with reports of
corruption and the misuse of state
funds. One example was the use of
state funds by heads of an enterprise
to travel to Switzerland to have their
teeth fixed, to buy TV sets, etc. Short
ly after a commission was set up to
look into the affair, its chairman re-

signed because of pressure being put
upon him. No names were printed.
One of the first questions put to
me by a fearless dissident was: "Why
does America support Titoism so
much?" When in turn I asked if he re
ally thought that to be so, he re
torted: "More than ever." When I in
quired what the United States should
do, he did not hesitate: "First of all, it
is necessary to speak the truth.
Titoism has ruined this country."
Moreover, he continued, "you must
realize that Tito was a 'Shah.' And you
can be assured that when some colo
nels seize power here, they will not
be pro-American."

Japan, importing raw materials and
exporting manufactured goods. But
we discovered that we could not
compete successfully with Western
European countries. Moreover, our
currency is not convertible, so
without hard currency earnings from
abroad, we cannot import the things
we need."
Adding to Yugoslavia's economic
woes is the high cost of imported oil,
as well as its loans to Third World
countries, many of which are in de
fault. There is no hiding the fact that
the standard of living has fallen in the
past two or three years by some 7 to
10 percent.
Thus far the regime has not come

forth with any concrete program for
dealing with the country's economic
difficulties, except to issue general
proclamations on the need to fight
inflation, to produce more and to
consume less. The only concrete step
suggested while I was there — one
which Slovenia and Croatia had not
yet agreed — was to stem the outflow
of hard currency by Yugoslavs trav
elling abroad. This was to be done by
imposing a tax on every trip taken
abroad.
The press abounds with reports of
corruption and the misuse of state
funds. One example was the use of
state funds by heads of an enterprise
to travel to Switzerland to have their
teeth fixed, to buy TV sets, etc. Short
ly after a commission was set up to
look into the affair, its chairman re-

signed because of pressure being put
upon him. No names were printed.
One of the first questions put to
me by a fearless dissident was: "Why
does America support Titoism so
much?" When in turn I asked if he re
ally thought that to be so, he re
torted: "More than ever." When I in
quired what the United States should
do, he did not hesitate: "First of all, it
is necessary to speak the truth.
Titoism has ruined this country."
Moreover, he continued, "you must
realize that Tito was a 'Shah.' And you
can be assured that when some colo
nels seize power here, they will not
be pro-American."

Yugoslavs are grumbling and are
convinced that their country is ap
proaching a critical crossroad. Since
Tito's death, several problem areas
have gotten worse, adding to the
frustrations of the populace.
"Tito should have lived another 10
years, so that he could have seen the
real consequence of his policies!" So
said a former highly-placed Yugoslav
Communist Party member during a
recent conversation with me in Bel
grade.
After Tito's death, the Yugoslav
leadership assured the people that all
was well, that the old marshal had left
the country in good shape. The real
situation today is a far cry from op
timistic assessment. The political
structure is fragile. None of the col
lective presidency's members has
any significant number of supporters
behind him. The eight geographic
units that they represent are domi
nated by oligarchic bureacracies.
The economy is deteriorating. The
inflation rate is 52 percent now and
many predict it will be as high as 80
percent by the end of 1981.
In the foreign policy field, many
Yugoslavs are wondering whether
Tito's nonalignment policy will pro
tect them from outside in
terferences, particularly Soviet,
either direct or more likely through a
surrogate. Most Yugoslavs that I
spoke with believed the Soviets had
"their fingers" in the recent dis
turbances in Kosovo.
Tito's nationality policy for Yugo
slavia, formulated in his Comintern
years, envisioned a multiple-unit
country. The main objective of this
policy was to weaken the Serbs, the
largest ethnic component in the
state. When Tito came to power at
the end of World War 11, Yugoslavia
was divided intosix republics (Serbia,
Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia-
Hercegovins, Montenegro,
Macedonia), with a significant

number of Serbs in each of the other
republics except Slovenia. The main
cause of the present troubles in
Kosovo is the systematic forcing of
Serbs out of the province of Kosovo,
which is the cradle of the old Serbian
empire of the middle ages.
Evidence abounds that the econo
my is in trouble. In addition to the
high inflation rate, there are per
sistent shortages. Newspapers re
ported that power shortages were
occurring for the first time in the
summertime, and asserted that limi
tations on electrical use will be in ef
fect by fall.
Many factories are operating less
than full time, resulting in smaller
paychecks for the workers. A friend
of mine explained it this way: "We
