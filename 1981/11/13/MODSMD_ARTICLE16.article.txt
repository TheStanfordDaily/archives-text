## Discussions on nuclear war improved nation's awareness 
### 
Boston — Our nation doesn't make much
of Veterans Day anymore. Flags fly at half
mast and fresh wreaths grace local war me
morials. Since most American veterans work,
only a fraction take to the streets to honor
those who aren't around.
And for Americans born after 1945, Veter
ans Day was once a school holiday but little
more.
Vet this year, college students and science
professors on 140 campuses around the na
tion put their Veterans Day to good use. As
part of a national teach-in, they tried to
cometogripswith the possibility of a nuclear
war.
Armageddon is not a pleasant thought.
Since Hiroshima, most Americans have
either exorcised it from their thoughts en
tirely or reduced it to sick jokes. According
to a recent Newsweek poll, only 18 percent
of all Americans "frequently" think about
nuclear war. Most say they are "concerned"
but go into punt formation when the topic
arises.
Lately, however, we've been hard-pressed

to maintain this "out of sight, out of mind"
attitude.
President Ronald Reagan last summer au
thorized the Defense Department to pro
ceed with production of the neutron war
head. He subsequently endorsed the pro
duction of 100 MX missiles and 100 B-1
bombers. Moreover, Reagan has said a nu
clear war can be limited to Europe, displays
little interest in arms control and leaves the
impression that a nuclear war can be fought
— and won.
These conditions, coupled with the de
mise of SALT II last year, led the Union of
Concerned Scientists based here to organize
a 12-college consortium to help young peo
ple "think about the unthinkable." Since La
bor Day, more than 130 additional schools
have joined.
"Our national memory is quite short," said
Eric Van Loon, executive director of the
100,000-member Union. "Today's students
don't have a clear understanding of the
bomb."
On most campuses, the national teach-in

included a brief introductory course on the
logistics, dimensions and the likely outcome
of a nuclear war. There were slide shows of
missile systems, diagrams about the effects of
nuclear blast radiation, and, hopefully, plen
ty of questions from the audience.
One lesson many undergraduates may
have learned is that neither the United States
nor the Soviet Union can truly "contain" a
nuclear war. Leonid Brezhnev even ad
mitted this to a German newsmagazine last
week. Meanwhile, the well-respected In
ternational Institute for Strategic Studies in
London published a paper last month stat
ing, "Once it begins there can really be no
possibility of controlling nuclear war."
For most schools, the teach-in was a one
speaker, ope-night affair. On other cam
puses, however, favorites such as scientist
Carl Sagan, economist Paul Samuelson and
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) spoke, as well as a
handful'of Nobel Prize-winning physicists.
UCLA sponsored a five-day film festival to
boost interest in its teach-in.
Sponsdrs said that their Veterans Day

events weren't necessarily aimed at defusing
the MX, cruise missile or the neutron war
head. They simply wanted to jolt younger
Americans into thinking realistically about
nuclear war.
They know, moreover, that Ronald Rea
gan won't be able to dismiss their efforts as
easily £ls he has brushed aside the dozen dis
armament rallies held recently in Western
Europe.
"The teach-ins were conducted by doc
tors, economists and presidential science ad
visers," Van Loon told our associate, Michael
Dutfy. It wasn't exactly a group of left-wing
students marching around under banners.
This reached citizens and voters in our coun
try." '
The scientists have their work cut out for
them. On one hand, only one American in 10
believes he or she would live through a sup
posed "limited exchange" of nuclear mis
siles. At the same time, the nation has
"pathologically denied" the possibility of
real nuclear years, according to the
former president of the American Psy

chiatric Association. It's a tough paradox to
crack.
Vet, unless the nation begins confronting
the growing possibility of nuclear war, the
arms race will continue unchecked. In addi
tion, till the public takes a stand, our leaders
won't see much political gain in seeking the
afms reductions that could lessen our fears
and preserve our future. We hope dis
cussions like these on campuses this week
will help the Reagan administration take the
late-November Theater Nuclear Force arms
*alks with the Soviets in Geneva seriously.
Of course, some people might suggest
that it's disrespectful or unpatriotic to
scrutinize the nation's strategic defenses on
Veterans Day.
But Nov. 11 may have been a natural time
to take note of the full effects of a worldwide
war. In recalling the past, it seems intructive
to look ahead to the possibility of World War
111.

100,000-member Union. "Today's students
don't have a clear understanding of the
bomb."
On most campuses, the national teach-in

included a brief introductory course on the
logistics, dimensions and the likely outcome
of a nuclear war. There were slide shows of
missile systems, diagrams about the effects of
nuclear blast radiation, and, hopefully, plen
ty of questions from the audience.
One lesson many undergraduates may
have learned is that neither the United States
nor the Soviet Union can truly "contain" a
nuclear war. Leonid Brezhnev even ad
mitted this to a German newsmagazine last
week. Meanwhile, the well-respected In
ternational Institute for Strategic Studies in
London published a paper last month stat
ing, "Once it begins there can really be no
possibility of controlling nuclear war."
For most schools, the teach-in was a one
speaker, ope-night affair. On other cam
puses, however, favorites such as scientist
Carl Sagan, economist Paul Samuelson and
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) spoke, as well as a
handful'of Nobel Prize-winning physicists.
UCLA sponsored a five-day film festival to
boost interest in its teach-in.
Sponsdrs said that their Veterans Day

events weren't necessarily aimed at defusing
the MX, cruise missile or the neutron war
head. They simply wanted to jolt younger
Americans into thinking realistically about
nuclear war.
They know, moreover, that Ronald Rea
gan won't be able to dismiss their efforts as
easily £ls he has brushed aside the dozen dis
armament rallies held recently in Western
Europe.
"The teach-ins were conducted by doc
tors, economists and presidential science ad
visers," Van Loon told our associate, Michael
Dutfy. It wasn't exactly a group of left-wing
students marching around under banners.
This reached citizens and voters in our coun
try." '
The scientists have their work cut out for
them. On one hand, only one American in 10
believes he or she would live through a sup
posed "limited exchange" of nuclear mis
siles. At the same time, the nation has
"pathologically denied" the possibility of
real nuclear years, according to the
former president of the American Psy

chiatric Association. It's a tough paradox to
crack.
Vet, unless the nation begins confronting
the growing possibility of nuclear war, the
arms race will continue unchecked. In addi
tion, till the public takes a stand, our leaders
won't see much political gain in seeking the
afms reductions that could lessen our fears
and preserve our future. We hope dis
cussions like these on campuses this week
will help the Reagan administration take the
late-November Theater Nuclear Force arms
*alks with the Soviets in Geneva seriously.
Of course, some people might suggest
that it's disrespectful or unpatriotic to
scrutinize the nation's strategic defenses on
Veterans Day.
But Nov. 11 may have been a natural time
to take note of the full effects of a worldwide
war. In recalling the past, it seems intructive
to look ahead to the possibility of World War
111.

Boston — Our nation doesn't make much
of Veterans Day anymore. Flags fly at half
mast and fresh wreaths grace local war me
morials. Since most American veterans work,
only a fraction take to the streets to honor
those who aren't around.
And for Americans born after 1945, Veter
ans Day was once a school holiday but little
more.
Vet this year, college students and science
professors on 140 campuses around the na
tion put their Veterans Day to good use. As
part of a national teach-in, they tried to
cometogripswith the possibility of a nuclear
war.
Armageddon is not a pleasant thought.
Since Hiroshima, most Americans have
either exorcised it from their thoughts en
tirely or reduced it to sick jokes. According
to a recent Newsweek poll, only 18 percent
of all Americans "frequently" think about
nuclear war. Most say they are "concerned"
but go into punt formation when the topic
arises.
Lately, however, we've been hard-pressed

to maintain this "out of sight, out of mind"
attitude.
President Ronald Reagan last summer au
thorized the Defense Department to pro
ceed with production of the neutron war
head. He subsequently endorsed the pro
duction of 100 MX missiles and 100 B-1
bombers. Moreover, Reagan has said a nu
clear war can be limited to Europe, displays
little interest in arms control and leaves the
impression that a nuclear war can be fought
— and won.
These conditions, coupled with the de
mise of SALT II last year, led the Union of
Concerned Scientists based here to organize
a 12-college consortium to help young peo
ple "think about the unthinkable." Since La
bor Day, more than 130 additional schools
have joined.
