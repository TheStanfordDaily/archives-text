Campus escort service for men needed

The two recent rapes on campus
again pointtotheneedtodevelopan
effective strategy for protecting the
safety of women who live, work, or
visit here. In the past, most anti-rape
efforts have been directed at women
(e.g. self-defense classes, avoiding
"rape situations") — the escort ser
vice is probably the most ambitious
project to date.
We would like to propose that
what is needed i* not an escort ser
vice for women, however, but an es
cort service for men, to ensjre that
they do not use their freedom to walk
unharmed around campus to ter
rorize women. No man should be al
lowed anywhere on campus be
tween dusk and dawn unaccom
panied by a certified, anti-rape es
cort; and certain lonely places (e.g.
the Dish) should always be off limits
to them if they do not have an escort.
Women would then be able to go out
alone wherever they pleased.

This is not a facetious suggestion.
All women, rape victims or not, are
forced to deal with the conse
quences of this crime through a loss
of personal freedom. It's about time
that all men, rapists or not, began to
take some serious responsibility for
the violence against women.

Recycling program
ASSU Recycling is a non-profit,
student-run organization concerned
with reducing waste of resources by
the Stanford community. Over the
past four years our operation has ex
panded to serve more than 200 loca
tions on campus and recycle more
than one-eighth of the University's
garbage.
We heartily endorse the California

Can and Bottle Recycling initiative,
which would require a 5-cent deposit
on all beer and soft drink containers
sold in the state. Seven other states
have already demonstrated the effec
tiveness of "bottle bills" in saving
energy and resources, reducing litter
and lowering state litter clean-up
costs.
Deposit legislation will not weaken
the financial position of ASSU Recycl
ing since glass and aluminum are
costly for us to process. We believe
moreover that a 5-cent deposit
would reduce waste more effectively
than voluntary recycling. We hope
that the petition drive to place the
' bottle bill" on the California ballot
in November 1982 succeeds.

Durant's death
The report on the death of
philosopher-historian Will Durant (
Daily, Nov. 9) was incomplete and
misleading in its portrayal of Durant's
life.
The article depicts Durant as a man
who lamented the rise of civilization
as the work of men who were "no
better than 'trousered apes' " and
who loathed the Catholic Church.
In fact, Durant's writings reveal a
deep respect fortheChurch. Though
he criticized the teachings of the
Church in his lifetime, he hailed the
Church as the main intellectual bas
tion of democratic ideals throughout
its existence.
His 11-volume Story of Civilization
was, above all, a celebration of his
tory and the evolution of civilized so
ciety. In the last volume Durant offers

a view on the destiny of civilization
which is both practical and thought
ful.
"Truth is seldom simple; . . . The
best we may hope for is to persuade
more and more men and women to
require their governments to submit
. . . their disputes to an international
court. . but we must not expect any
nation to submit to arbitration of
what it considers a matter of life and
death. Self-preservation remains the
basic law of life."
This appreciation of the potential
of civilization and the popular appeal
to which he brought the study of his
tory in this century are the most im
portant and enduring contributions
of Durant's life.

I recently came across The Stan
ford Daily. I was appalled by the let
ters printed in your Mideast forum
page (Daily, Oct. 27).
While I comprehend the one
sided opinions by Arab students, I
was disturbed by a letter from
Rachelle Marshall, who uses many
newspapers in this area to voice her
admiration for the PLO. Pretending
to be for peace in the Middle East,
she blames only Israel and the United
States for the crisis in that area. In
very intelligent fashion, she com
bines facts and fiction to substantiate
her concoctions.
In any case it is good to know that
in America, even foreigners can
voice their opinion without being
censured or punished,

While I comprehend the one
sided opinions by Arab students, I
was disturbed by a letter from
Rachelle Marshall, who uses many
newspapers in this area to voice her
admiration for the PLO. Pretending
to be for peace in the Middle East,
she blames only Israel and the United
States for the crisis in that area. In
very intelligent fashion, she com
bines facts and fiction to substantiate
her concoctions.
In any case it is good to know that
in America, even foreigners can
voice their opinion without being
censured or punished,

Campus escort service for men needed

The two recent rapes on campus
again pointtotheneedtodevelopan
effective strategy for protecting the
safety of women who live, work, or
visit here. In the past, most anti-rape
efforts have been directed at women
(e.g. self-defense classes, avoiding
"rape situations") — the escort ser
vice is probably the most ambitious
project to date.
We would like to propose that
what is needed i* not an escort ser
vice for women, however, but an es
cort service for men, to ensjre that
they do not use their freedom to walk
unharmed around campus to ter
rorize women. No man should be al
lowed anywhere on campus be
tween dusk and dawn unaccom
panied by a certified, anti-rape es
cort; and certain lonely places (e.g.
the Dish) should always be off limits
to them if they do not have an escort.
Women would then be able to go out
alone wherever they pleased.

This is not a facetious suggestion.
All women, rape victims or not, are
forced to deal with the conse
quences of this crime through a loss
of personal freedom. It's about time
that all men, rapists or not, began to
take some serious responsibility for
the violence against women.

Recycling program
ASSU Recycling is a non-profit,
student-run organization concerned
with reducing waste of resources by
the Stanford community. Over the
past four years our operation has ex
panded to serve more than 200 loca
tions on campus and recycle more
than one-eighth of the University's
garbage.
We heartily endorse the California

Can and Bottle Recycling initiative,
which would require a 5-cent deposit
on all beer and soft drink containers
sold in the state. Seven other states
have already demonstrated the effec
tiveness of "bottle bills" in saving
energy and resources, reducing litter
and lowering state litter clean-up
costs.
Deposit legislation will not weaken
the financial position of ASSU Recycl
ing since glass and aluminum are
costly for us to process. We believe
moreover that a 5-cent deposit
would reduce waste more effectively
than voluntary recycling. We hope
that the petition drive to place the
' bottle bill" on the California ballot
in November 1982 succeeds.

Durant's death
The report on the death of
philosopher-historian Will Durant (
Daily, Nov. 9) was incomplete and
misleading in its portrayal of Durant's
life.
The article depicts Durant as a man
who lamented the rise of civilization
as the work of men who were "no
better than 'trousered apes' " and
who loathed the Catholic Church.
In fact, Durant's writings reveal a
deep respect fortheChurch. Though
he criticized the teachings of the
Church in his lifetime, he hailed the
Church as the main intellectual bas
tion of democratic ideals throughout
its existence.
His 11-volume Story of Civilization
was, above all, a celebration of his
tory and the evolution of civilized so
ciety. In the last volume Durant offers

a view on the destiny of civilization
which is both practical and thought
ful.
"Truth is seldom simple; . . . The
best we may hope for is to persuade
more and more men and women to
require their governments to submit
. . . their disputes to an international
court. . but we must not expect any
nation to submit to arbitration of
what it considers a matter of life and
death. Self-preservation remains the
basic law of life."
This appreciation of the potential
of civilization and the popular appeal
to which he brought the study of his
tory in this century are the most im
portant and enduring contributions
of Durant's life.
