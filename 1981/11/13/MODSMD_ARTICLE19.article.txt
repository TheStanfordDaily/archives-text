## Stockman quoted despairing 
### 
from the Daily wire services

Washington — Con
troversy stirred by a maga
zine article swirled about
the Reagan administration's
economic programs
Wednesday, and the head
of the nation's central bank
said continued federal belt
tightening is needed to cool
inflation.
Opponents of the Reagan
program pounced on the
Atlantic Monthly article,
written from a series of in
terviews with the presi
dent's budget director.,
David Stockman, as evi
dence the administration is
managing the economy
poorly.

The article quotes Stock
man criticizing "supply-side
economics," complaining
about greed and waste at
the Defense Department,
confessing that President
Ronald Reagan could not
balance the budget and as
sailing the final tax-cut bill
approved by Congress.
Stockman ducked re
porters who wanted to ask
him about the report.
But House Speaker Tip
O'Neill (D-Mass.) called the
Stockman quotations "dev
astating admissions."
Meanwhile, Federal Re
serve Chairman Paul
Volcker said the fight

against inflation required
additional federal budget
cuts, continued tight con
trol on the supply of credit
in the economy and possi
bly higher taxes to offset a
mounting federal deficit
and halt the growth in fed
eral borrowing to finance
ever-growing deficits.
Volcker said in a speech
prepared for delivery at the
University of Nebraska that
no one expects a balanced
budget when the nation's
economy is slumping as at
present. But he also said the
government must eliminate
if "structural deficit at the
earliest opportunity" after
the economy picks up

again.
Raising the possibility of
new taxes — or less tax re
duction than Congress
voted last summer — he
said, "If spending trends
cannot be brought into line
with our prospective capaci
ty to generate revenues with
present taxes, then we can
not shrink from considering
new revenue sources."
At the same time, re
bellious Republicans on the
Senate Budget Committee,
ignoring Reagan, continued
their push for action on a
three-year budget-balanc
ing plan that includes large
tax increases and major cuts
in benefit programs.
