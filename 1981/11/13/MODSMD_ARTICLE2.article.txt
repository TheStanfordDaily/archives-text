# Architecture and Near Eastern studies exchange
## Students not using program 
### Katherine Hutt 
Despite the fact that the University
has no departments of architecture
or Middle Eastern studies, op
portunity still exists for study in those
areas. Graduate students here may
take advantage of a free exchange
with the University of California at
Berkeley to take courses in those
areas.
According to Mary Ann Daly, an
administrative assistant in the Gradu
ate Division at Berkeley, in the past
four quarters no Stanford students
have enrolled in any classes in either
architecture or Middle Eastern stud
ies.
The purpose of the exchange pro
gram is to avoid a "proliferation of
courses" at both universities, said
Robert Houghton, associate registrar
here. All graduate students can par
ticipate free of charge. For under
graduates to receive credit for classes
taken at Berkeley, however, they
must enroll there directly and then
transfer the credits here.
Fora graduate student to take
courses on exchange, his petition
must be approved by both univer
sities. A Stanford student must get
the signatures of a representative

from his major department, the dean
of Graduate Studies and the regis
trar's office certifying that he has paid
his fees on his home campus. At
Berkeley he must then obtain the ap
proval of both a departmental ad
visor, and the dean of the Graduate
Division, before submitting his ap
plication to the registrar there.
The exchange is not widely used.
In the past three quarters only 21
Stanford students enrolled in courses
in departments Berkeley And,
none of those students took classes in
either architecture or Middle Eastern
studies.
In fact, no student has taken a
course in architecture at Berkeley in
the past five years, according to
Lillian Otsuka, who works in the reg
istrar's office there. Otsuka, who
handles all exchange applications,
added that only a few Stanford stu
dents enrolled in classes in Middle
Eastern studies during that time
Students from other universities
which bave an exchange with
Berkeley take advantage of these two
departments, according to Daly. She
speculated that the popularity of
architecture and of Middle Eastern
studies could make it difficult for ex

change students to get into courses
in those areas. She said, however,
that "99 percent" of those who peti
tion to take classes on exchange are
successful.
The University had an architecture
department at one time. However,
according to Norman Wessells, as
sociate dean of humanities and sci
ences, "All universities have to make
choices. We don't want to do any
thing if we can't do it in top-notch
fashion."
What is now the Art Department
was the Department of Art and
Architecture, according to Albert
Hastorf, vice president and provost.
The architecture section consisted of
only one man, Prof. Victor Thomp
son. Hastorf said around 1960
Thompson moved the base of his
teaching to the Civil Engineering De
partment. When Thompson retired
around i972 'he School of Engineer
ing dropped architecture altogether
because of the budget-cutting pro
grams here.
The University was never formally
accredited in architecture, according
to Boyd Paulson, associate chairman
of civil engineering. However, he
