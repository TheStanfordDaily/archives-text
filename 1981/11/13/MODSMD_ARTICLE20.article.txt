# Uncertainty plaguing economy

New York — Implicit in the president's
news conference remarks Tuesday was an
admission that he and his economic crew
hadn't foreseen the onset of a severe re
cession just 10 months into his adminis
tration.
Because of the recession, it was con-

Nobody knows the economic future, especially
nowadays, and if you need further confirmation of that
you can take a look at the forecasts making the rounds
these days.

ceded, budget deficits would be larger
than anticipated, and the possibility of
budget balance, should it still be d goal, has
been pushed into the unforeseeable
future.
How could President Ronald Reagan
have been so wrong? Well, how could
Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Carter and
Ford have been so wrong?
Lyndon Johnson promised that the
country could afford guns and butter sim
ultaenously without inflating the currency.

Richard Nixon expressed his
philosophical disdain for wage-price con
trols and then, without forewarning,
found it necessary to impose a wage-price
freeze.
Jimmy Carter, by one count, launched
seven distinct economic programs, which

meant that for one reason or another he
found six weren't working out the way he
had hoped.
The corporate ranks provide similar mis
calculations in numbers too great to list.
Just two will provide the idea:
1) Montgomery Ward retrenched after
World War II because a return to econom
ic bad times seemed inevitable. 2) Walter
Wriston, Citibank chairman, assured an
audience some time ago that the prime
rate would fall, a statement followed short

ly by his own bank raising the rate.
What does it demonstrate? That nobody
knows the economic future, especially
nowadays, and if you need further con
firmation of that you can take a look at the
forecasts making the rounds these days.
Forecasting is big business, a multi
billion-dollar business when you total up
the receipts of the econometric outfits
such as Data Resources and Chase Econo
metrics, the academics, the $150-a-year
newsletter writers, the stock market fore
casters, the professors, the bank vice presi
dents, the commodities speculators, the
clerks in government offices and the con
ventions, seminars, articles, books,
speeches and scholarly papers.
More effort may be exerted in probing
the future than in understanding the pres
ent or the past. The Great Depression of
nearly half a century ago is still not fully un
derstood, nor is the extent of the rise in last
month's unemployment. "Facts" about
each are still revised.
When the past is revised, of course,
many of the forecasts of the future must
also be changed, or updated, as they say,
because the base has changed. It will be
changed again, and so will the forecasts.
