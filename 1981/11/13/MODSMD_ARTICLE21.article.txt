# Liquor woes in Oklahoma
## 
### Washington Post 
Norman, Okla. â€” George Jansing, the cashier,
recalls with great clarity the run on Ole John's
Liquor Store out on West l.indsey Street.
The customers, he said, "went nuts. It was
mayhem in here. It was like things were going
dry again. One old boy I've been selling to for
years went down to the bank and took out $1400,
and spent it all on booze."
That was in September, after several major dis
tributors, including Joseph Seagram & Sons Inc.,
abruptly stopped selling their brands in Oklaho
ma. Missing from the shelves are such well
known labels as Chivas Regal, Hiram Walker,
Crown Royal and Canadian Club, plus a number
of wines and liqueurs.
"Six of the top 10 brands are gone," Assistant
State Attorney General Mike Conaway said.
"Sales are down, liquor dealers are hurting and
we're losing tax revenue."
Ole John's and George Jansing are still in busi
ness selling liquor, but a lot of what people want
to buy is no longer available. So Oklahomans
have simply brushed off skills developed over
years of having to set bv without a local suddlv.
It has been 22 years since bootlegging was a
way of life in Oklahoma, one of the last states to
repeal prohibition.
It isn't as bad now as it was before repeal in
1959. To get a bottle then, one had to drive two
miles on a rutted, one-way cowpath to a house
trailer on the South Canadian River bottom,
which is usually dry. The river serves as a bound
ary for two counties, and the sheriffs from each
claiif.ed that the trailer was in the other's juris
diction. So neither could find justification to
close it down.
Oklahomans, in explaining this state of affairs,
quote Will Rogers as having said, "Oklahoma
will remain dry as long as the last Baptist can stag
ger to the polls." There is no record that Rogers
ever said that, but Oklahoma has been referred
to, usually by unsympathetic Eastern critics, as
the buckle of the Bible Beit.
When Oklahomans repealed prohibition,
they did so largely because an ambitious young

commissioner of public safety, Joe Cannon, had
made it hard to find a drink of any kind, legal or
illegal. Cannon and his raiders, nicknamed the
Crewcuts, roamed the state on Saturday nights,
raiding joints and confiscating stock,
Oklahomans were faced with a Hobson's
choice: stop the hypocrisy and legalize drinking,
or quit drinking. Six times previously Sooners
had voted to keep Demon Rum on the banned
list. But this time they caved in and authorized

in Oklahoma are leading to a
return of bootlegging.

sale of hard liquor at individually owned pack
age stores.
(Hypocrisy, sad to say, remains. Liquor by the
drink is still illegal, but it's almost impossible to
sit down at a decent restaurant without being of
fered a drink. Frosty Troy, the state's conscience
who holds forth in a newspaper called TheOkla
homa Observer, calls it Liquor by the Wink.)
But why did Seagram and others leave the
state? Well, state law requires distillers to sell to
all Oklahoma wholesalers at the lowest price
they sell anywhere else.
That was fine for awhile, but in the past two or
three years, Oklahoma wholesalers began sell
ing out of state, particularly in California. Now
that was costing Seagram some money, because
it has franchised dealers in California.
"About half the liquor sold to wholesalers in
Oklahoma was being sold out of state," Kent
Meyers, attorney for Seagram, said. "The dis
tillers took the position that was unconstitu
tional." The state attorney general's office
agreed.
When the case came to trial, whoshould be on
the bench but Joe Cannon, now a jii'dge, no
longer crewcut? Cannon, over objections of
both the distillers and the attorney general's of
fice, ruled out-of-state sales perfectly proper.
