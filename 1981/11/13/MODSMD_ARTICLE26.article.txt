Stockman angers Reagan
' Washington — An angry President Ronald
Reagan took budget director David Stockman
"to the woodshed" of the Oval Office yesterday
and bawled him out for publicly criticizing the
administration's economic program. But the
president decided not to accept his resignation.
Stockman apologized for "poor judgment
and loose talk" and "careless rambling to a re
porter," who wrote the critical article quoting
Stockman in The Atlantic magazine.
But while the White House moved quickly to
control the short-term damage caused by
Stockman's quotes, it was clear that there was
an inestimable, long-range impact on the presi
dent's relations with Congress that his advisers
still will have to deal with in the months ahead.
Stockman was not just an ordinary White
House adviser criticizing Reagan's economic
program and theories, but the president's chief
spokesman in selling them to Congress.
"It's destroyed Stockman's credibility," one
White House aide told the Los Angeles Times.
"Can you imagine him going up to the Hill
(Congress) and talking about budget figures?
They would laugh at him."
One of Stockman's most damaging quotes in
the lengthy article was that the Kemp-Roth tax
plan, upon which the Reagan tax cut was based,
was a "Trojan horse" designed to lower the
maximum income tax rate for wealthy Ameri
cans.
"I can only say that it was a rotten, horrible,
unfortunate metaphor," Stockman told a
packed press conference yesterday afternoon
at the White House.
The article appears in the December issue of
the magazine. The president read the full article
Wednesday night and became "pretty upset,"
one close aide said, making clear his description
of the president's reaction was an under
statement.
Shuttle flight shortened
Cape Canaveral, Florida — Space shuttle Co
lumbia, its flight only 10 hours old, was told yes
terday its planned five-day mission would be
cut to slightly more that two days because of a
malfunctioning fuel cell.
After ordering the cell shut down, Mission
Control said "when a fuel cell is taken per
manently off the line, it brings about a mission
rule that calls fora minimal mission — 54 hours.
The problem was in one of the three cells that
provide the spaceship with electrical power.
The cell showed too much alkalinity and was
shut down.
Their journey is official designated by the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration as
STS-2 (for Space Transportation System, mission
two). It was to end next Tuesday afternoon with
a wheels-down landing on Rogers Dry Lake at
Edwards Air Force in California. That will now
take place late tomorrow afternoon.
Following its brilliant launch, the shuttle set
tled easily into orbit 137 miles high, and as Truly
tinkered with problems, he dropped his busi
ness-like manner and told Mission Control:
"You won't believe this, but this is fun."
U.S. diplomat fired upon
Paris — A black-bearded youth wielding a
pistol fired a half-dozen shots at the top-rank
ing U.S. diplomat in France yesterday in a
botched assassination attempt outside the
diplomat's apartment near the Eiffel Tower.
Charge d'Affaires Christian Chapman said he
escaped injury by ducking behind his chauf
feur-driven embassy sedan after seeing a man
reach into his black leather jacket, move swiftly
toward tfie diplomat and fire away in full view of
several passers-by.

Chaprhan described the gunman as "a
Middle Eastern type."Theassailant — apparent
ly acting alone — fled the scene on foot, and
Paris police reported no arrests.
The French Foreign Ministry said Chapman
had informed the government recently of a
threat against U.S. diplomats in Paris. The fears,
diplomatic sources added, grew from U.S. in
telligence reports that Libyan agents were plan
ning attacks on American diplomats in several
European capitals to avenge the shooting down
of two Libyan warplanes last August by U.S.
Navy pilots on maneuvers in the Gulf of Sidra
off Libya.
(In Washington, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig referred to those reports and suggested
that the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Khadafy,
could be behind the attack on Chapman.)
No one claimed responsibility for the attack,
and police reported no leads to the where
abouts of the assailant.
Blockade still possible
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig intensified the administration's war of
nerves with Cuba yesterday, pointedly refusing
to assure Congress that the United States will
not blockade or support a campaign to
destabilize the Cuban-backed Sandinista re
gime in Nicaragua.
In recent days, Haig has been quoted as
saying that he believes the military situation is in
a stalemate because of continuing supplies of
arms from Cuba to Nicaraguan guerrillas
through intermediaries in Nicaragua. He has
told one interviewer that a blockade of
Nicaragua might be necessary.
In testimony yesterday before the House For
eign Affairs Committee, Haig twice rejected de
mands by Democratic congressmen to reassure
Nicaragua.
"I would not give you such an assurance," he
replied when asked by Rep. Gerry Studds (D-
Mass.) to declare that the administration would
not press for the overthrow of the Sandinista re
gime, which Haig denounced as totalitarian.
"I am not prepared to say anything of the
kind," Haig said.
More tension in Poland
Warsaw — More than 100,000 Polish univer
sity students boycotted classes yesterday but
the majoi regional strike by 150,000 workers in
Zielona Gora province appeared near an end.
During a day of widespread labor unrest, the
independent union Solidarity announced it
would meet with government officials next
week to start negotiations on the Polish crisis.
Although new strikes by bus drivers and
newspaper started yesterday, Polish Radio an
nounced that more than 150,000 striking work
ers in Zielona Gora province had heeded an ap
peal from Solidarity to end a regional strike that
started Oct. 22.
In another development, Stefan Olszowski, a
hardline member of the Communist Party's
Politburo, told a party conference in Legnica
the party "will never agree" to giving Solidarity
a role in government, according to the official
news agency PAP.
Polish Radio said the talks were to have
started today, but that the tense labor situation
around the country had forced postponement
of the talks until next week.
Poland's strikes have persisted despite Soli
darity's leadership call that they stop while gov
ernment-union.talks are on.
Unrest over budget
Washington — Republicans on the Senate
Budget Committee moved to the brink of open
revolt against President Ronald Reagan's

budget plan yesterday, criticizing his call to wait
until next year before considering tax increases
or cuts in benefit programs.
But as the panel opened debate on a binding
spending plan for 1982, Republican and Demo
crat sources cautioned that there was no clear
majority either for Reagan's position or an
altenative designed to balance the budget in
1984.
Seven of the committee's 12 Republicans
members expressed preference for the alter
native, developed by committee chairman Sen.
Pete Domenici. It calls for $48 billion in higher
taxes, $40 billion in cuts in programs such as
food stamps and Medicaid and doubling the
$13 billion Reagan wants trimmed from the de
fense buildup.
"The notion that this can be put off until after
the holidays I think is an insult to the nation,''
Sen. Donald Riegle of Michigan said in a table
thumping speech.
Domenici ordered aides to distribute copies
of the plan to committee members, but he did
not formally propose its adoption.
In the House, meanwhile, the Budget Com
mittee was scheduled to begin work on its own
budget plan.
And the Appropriations Committee gave
voice-vote approval to an omnibus spending
bill designed to keep the government function
ing through the end of the fiscal year. 1 he bill
would take effect on Nov. 20. when'an existing
stopgap measure expires.
Clausen states Bank policy
Washington — In one of his first major ad
dresses as president of the World Bank, A. W.
Clausen said yesterday that "as a matter of poli
cy" the bank will refuse to finance projects in
developing nations that "seriously compromise
health or safety" or cause severe environmental
problems.
The statement by Clausen, who is only four
months into a five-year term as head of the in
ternational lending agency, sent a signal to de
veloping countries that the bank will be con
cerned about environmental and safety matters
even though President Ronald Reagan's admin
istration is cutting back on such regulations on
industries in this country, bank sources said.
Clausen said Third World countries will gain
long-term economic benefits from paying at
tention to the environment as they begin de
velopingjnstead of paying for cleaning up in
distrial wastes in the future.
"We're convinced that it's almost always less
expensive to incorporate the environmental
dimensions into a project planning than to ig
nore them and pay the penalties at some future
time," Clausen said.
