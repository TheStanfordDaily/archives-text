Winding up their campaign to
block the newstate reapportionment
plan, the Stanford College Re
publicans sponsored a talk by two lo
cal party officials last night in Cedro
lounge of Wilbur Hall. Jim Bourgart,
administrative assistant in Redwood
City for Assemblyman Bob Naylor (R-
Menlo Park) and David Sturrock,
chairman of the Santa Clara County
Republican Party Election and Reap
portionment Committee, charged
Democrats with gerrymandering
state and congressional districts.
They warned that the new reappor
tionment plan will mean less effec
tive government.
Every 10 years the California legis
lature is required by law to redraw
state senate and assembly and con
gressional district lines to accom
modate population changes. The re
sults of the 1980 Census showed that
the state was entitled to two more
House representatives fora total of
45. The State Legislature recently
passed a Democratic-backed re
districting plan.
Bourgart called the reapportion
ment plan "one of the worst in Cali
fornia history." He said the intent of
the plan is to strengthen the Demo
crats' weaker districts by replacing
neighborhoods with heavy Re
publican registration with Democrat
ic neighborhoods.

The effect, he said, will be to create
"super-Democratic" and "super-Re
publican" districts in which one party
will have total control. Since more
"super-Democratic" districts than
"super-Republican" districts will ex
ist, Bourgart said the Democrats will
ensure themselves a majority in the
state legislature "for the next -10
years."
Bourgart stressed, however, that
more than party superiority is in
volved in the issue. "We are all better
off with as many competitive seats as
possible," he said, because " if peo
ple are dissatisfied with an incum
bent they have a realistic chance of
replacing him" in a competitive dis
trict.
According to Sturrock, the Califor
nia Democrats are trying to offset a
"demographic handicap." He said
that areas gaining the most popu
lation under the new redistricting
plan, such as the Los Angeles area,
tend to be Republican, whereas areas
such as San Francisco, which are not
gaining inhabitants quickly, tend to
be Democratic.
In light of the slim majority Demo
crats hold in the House of Represent
atives, the issue takes on national sig
nificance, said Sturrock. "It would
not take much," he said, "to get a Re
publican majority in the House next
year."
