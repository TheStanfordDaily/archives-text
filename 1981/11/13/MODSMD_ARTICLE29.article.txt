## Cards try to foil Ducks as Nelson approaches NCAA throne 
### Sally Jenkins 
When the Cardinals saunter down
that gentle slope into Stanford Stadi
um tomorrow, they will do it with the
assurance that they have slammed
the door on disappointment.
Coming off a 63-9 napalming of
Oregon State last week in Corvallis,
the Stanford football team takes on
the University of Oregon Ducks, who
are tied with their brethren Beavers
as the worst team in the Pacific-10
conference.
How do you like it? Barbecued,
broiled, or a I'Orange?
Oregon comes reeling to Stanford
after a 39-7 thrashing at the hands of
Washington State last week. Trailing
only 12-7 at halftime, the defense
caved in for 27 points in the second
half.
At 1-8 overall and 0-5 in the con
ference, the Ducks are virtually
skewered already,' they go into the
game against a Cardinal team that has
found the groove offensively after a
trying season of high scores that
weren't nearly enough. With young
receivers who have finally come to
feel somewhat seasoned — giving
quarterback John Elway the con
fidence he needs to complete his av
erage 285 yards worth — the Cards
aren't about to backslide.
If only for Darrin's sake.
All-America halfback Nelson is
only a quarter away away from be
coming the greatest all-purpose back
in collegiate history. After heart
stopping performances in his last
three games (Arizona State, Wash
ington, OSU) that yeilded 11 touch
downs and 915 all-purpose yards, he
is only 78 yards short of Tony
Dorsett's record on the NCAA all
time, all-purpose rushing list.
"He's one of the classiest, most un
selfish players I've ever seen around
and he deserves this kind of record,"
said Stanford head coach Paul Wig
gin. "I also want him to set the record
for the people who know him and re
spect him for being such a fine per
son. No one carries his laurels any
better than Darrin does."

The Card offense has scored an av
erage of 43 points per game and piled
up 1938 yards in the last three out
ings, testimony that the running and
passing threats have finally become
balanced.
Defensively, the Cards expect
tackle John Bergren (53 tackles) and
linebacker Dave Morze (team-lead
ing 72 tackles) to return. Bergreri suf
fered from a pinched neck nerve and
Morze has been out with a sprained
knee. Even without those stalwarts,
the Cards held OSU to only nine
points last week, a vast improvement
fora team that has yeilded an average
of 27 points per game.
The Ducks should prove a more
formidable opponent than the
Beavers in spite of their similar rec
ord. With quarterback problems like
OSU, Oregon has managed to turn it
into something of an advantage. Jun
ior Kevin Lusk and freshman Mike
Jorgensen split duties, lending ver
satility to an otherwise lukewarm
squad.
"They are a good passing team,
they get the ball to their halfback
(Reggie Brown, senior) a lot," ob
served Wiggin. "They are fairly ac
curate to certain people, so they will
pass, and do a good job of it. And
they do it with a number of quarter
backs. With one quarterback you'll
see some option football, then they
will turn around and look a little like
USC."
Oregon does have one major
threat in tailback Brown. Another all
purpose back, he has a season total of
618 yards on the ground (3.8 average
on 162 carries). He ranks second on
the team in receptions with 29 for 179
yards behind split end Greg Moser
(33 receptions, 501 yards, 2 TD'S.)
At bottom the Ducks are a de
fensive team, not a good thing to be
on what has been designated D-Day
at Stanford in honor of Nelson's
potential record. Called one of the
Pac-10's best in preseason, they run a
four-man front instead of three, a
tactic that could stifle Neison's effort
on the ground.

better than Darrin does."

The Card offense has scored an av
erage of 43 points per game and piled
up 1938 yards in the last three out
ings, testimony that the running and
passing threats have finally become
balanced.
Defensively, the Cards expect
tackle John Bergren (53 tackles) and
linebacker Dave Morze (team-lead
ing 72 tackles) to return. Bergreri suf
fered from a pinched neck nerve and
Morze has been out with a sprained
knee. Even without those stalwarts,
the Cards held OSU to only nine
points last week, a vast improvement
fora team that has yeilded an average
of 27 points per game.
The Ducks should prove a more
formidable opponent than the
Beavers in spite of their similar rec
ord. With quarterback problems like
OSU, Oregon has managed to turn it
into something of an advantage. Jun
ior Kevin Lusk and freshman Mike
Jorgensen split duties, lending ver
satility to an otherwise lukewarm
squad.
"They are a good passing team,
they get the ball to their halfback
(Reggie Brown, senior) a lot," ob
served Wiggin. "They are fairly ac
curate to certain people, so they will
pass, and do a good job of it. And
they do it with a number of quarter
backs. With one quarterback you'll
see some option football, then they
will turn around and look a little like
USC."
Oregon does have one major
threat in tailback Brown. Another all
purpose back, he has a season total of
618 yards on the ground (3.8 average
on 162 carries). He ranks second on
the team in receptions with 29 for 179
yards behind split end Greg Moser
(33 receptions, 501 yards, 2 TD'S.)
At bottom the Ducks are a de
fensive team, not a good thing to be
on what has been designated D-Day
at Stanford in honor of Nelson's
potential record. Called one of the
Pac-10's best in preseason, they run a
four-man front instead of three, a
tactic that could stifle Neison's effort
on the ground.

When the Cardinals saunter down
that gentle slope into Stanford Stadi
um tomorrow, they will do it with the
assurance that they have slammed
the door on disappointment.
Coming off a 63-9 napalming of
Oregon State last week in Corvallis,
the Stanford football team takes on
the University of Oregon Ducks, who
are tied with their brethren Beavers
as the worst team in the Pacific-10
conference.
How do you like it? Barbecued,
broiled, or a I'Orange?
Oregon comes reeling to Stanford
after a 39-7 thrashing at the hands of
Washington State last week. Trailing
only 12-7 at halftime, the defense
caved in for 27 points in the second
half.
At 1-8 overall and 0-5 in the con
ference, the Ducks are virtually
skewered already,' they go into the
game against a Cardinal team that has
found the groove offensively after a
trying season of high scores that
weren't nearly enough. With young
receivers who have finally come to
feel somewhat seasoned — giving
quarterback John Elway the con
fidence he needs to complete his av
erage 285 yards worth — the Cards
aren't about to backslide.
If only for Darrin's sake.
All-America halfback Nelson is
only a quarter away away from be
coming the greatest all-purpose back
in collegiate history. After heart
stopping performances in his last
three games (Arizona State, Wash
ington, OSU) that yeilded 11 touch
downs and 915 all-purpose yards, he
is only 78 yards short of Tony
Dorsett's record on the NCAA all
time, all-purpose rushing list.
"He's one of the classiest, most un
selfish players I've ever seen around
and he deserves this kind of record,"
said Stanford head coach Paul Wig
gin. "I also want him to set the record
for the people who know him and re
spect him for being such a fine per
son. No one carries his laurels any
better than Darrin does."
