# Two women raped in Menlo Park
## 
### 
Two Menlo Park women, one 74
years old, were raped Wednesday
night in separate incidents of com
bined burglary and rape.
Police are unsure whether the
rapes are linked to the campus rapes
of Tuesday night and last Thursday
but, based on initial reports, said they
think the rapes were committed by
different men. "We're looking at that
(connection between the rapes), but
at this time we don't see any," said
Dominick Peloso, director of opera
tions at the Menlo Park police force.
The rape of the 74-year-old woman
occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m.
in the 400 block of Laurel Road near
Willow Road. The rapist entered the
woman's house and stole $50 before
committing the rape. Police are
searching fora black male in his late
20s who was wearing a "blue or green
jump-suit," according to Pelosso.

At 4 a.m., a rapist broke into a
house at Oak Creek near Woodland
Ave., took "an undetermined
amount of cash," and raped the 20-
year-old resident. The rapist is de
scribed as a 20-25 year-old black
male, over 6 feet tall, with a medium
length afro. Neither victim was hospi
talized.
The campus rapist is described as a
black male, between 18 and 20 years
old, with a muscular build and ashort
afro. He is approximately 5 foot 10 in
ches tall.
There has been no progress in ap
prehending the campus rapist, ac
cording to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington. He said the de
scriptions of the rapists are too vague
to tell with much certainty whether
the rapes are connected, but present
ly "we don't think it's the same one
(rapist)."

Herrington said that for the two
campus rapes, "we think it is the
same person." Two people com
mitted the rape Tuesday night, he
said.
President Donald Kennedy said in
response to the campus rapes, "I am
deeply concerned about this situ
ation, as we all should be. But Stan
ford brings considerable strenths to
this challenge, and these have been
much in evidence in the various
meetings held today (Thursday)."
.Harrington said he has received
full support from the administration.
He said he had spoken to Kennedy
and that "I have authorization to use
more (resources) — whatever I feel is
necessary."
While Herrington said media cov
erage — including attention from
four television stations — means
"chances are, the rapist will see it and
change his area or his method of op
eration." He also said "one of our
best weapons is to get peoples
awareness up."
Herrington said the rapist "is
strange in the chances he has taken,"
but thinks the rapist will either go to
another place or be caught.
Kennedy said "there is little we can
do security-wise" and that "students
helping one another will probably be
more important "

One community response was a
noon meeting at the Women's Cen
ter yesterday attended by 40-50 male
and female administrators, students
and staff members. The group started
organizing a "speak out against
rape" White Plaza rally scheduled for
Monday noon.
Discussing ASSU responses to the
rapes, Council of Presidents member
Fred Buhl said, "We're discussing a
lot of things, but as an organization
we haven't acted yet."
