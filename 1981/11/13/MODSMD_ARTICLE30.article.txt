"The girls wanted it so badly. We
just got tight," explained Stanford as
sistant volleyball coach Don Shaw, as
he shook his head and looked
towards the sky in search of a better
answer.
The University of Pacific Tigers
scratched, clawed, and finally over
took the spirited Stanford spikers in
five games, 6-15, 15-11, 15-13, 9-15
15-9 to extend their NorCal reign to
39 straight wins last night in Stockton.
The vyin assured UOP of another
league championship with an 11-0

conference record. Stanford drops to
0-2, 29-13 overall. Before the match,
the ("aids were ranked third in the
national poll. Pacific, rated 7th by the
NCAA, should move up after its win
ning performance.
Game one began with Stanford to
tally dominating the Tigers in front of
UOP's home crowd at A.G. Spanos
Center. The Cards spikers scored
quickly, taking Pacific by surprise
15-6.
In the second game, Stanford
fought back from an early 1-6 deficit
as sophomore Kari Rush served for

four points to bring the team to
within one. UOP scored on the next
play before the Cards sided out and
Kisi Maine served two aces to tie the
game at 7. The squads alternated
points untilt with Stanford leading
12-11, Pacific's Jayne Gibson served
for'four straight points to give the
Tigers the game and deadlocked the
match at 1-1.
The Cardinals came out fighting in
game three however, and led the
scoring quickly at 6-0. UOP freshman
Lisa Franko brought her team right
back as she served for seven con

secutive winners, and the Tigers led
7-6. The squads battled back and
forth until Stanford's Jan Linden
served to give her team a 12-9 advan
tage. Pacific came back to tie the

back but Stanford prevailed to
send the match into a fifth
game tiebreaker.
The fifth pyriod belonged to
UOP as the Tigers opened up a

dominate play but couldn't
hold out long enough, and Pa
cific took the game 15-9 to beat
the Cardinals for the second
time this season.
Shaw said he believes that his
team should have walked away
with a three game win
"We were totally in control
of the of the match, but in
games two and three we just
tried too hard. VVe made some
mistakes, and we let them of
the hook," he said.
Shaw pointed to the fine play
and leadership of senior
Linden and Chris Anderson in
the Card effort, adding how
ever, that the match was a team
effort whether the squad won
or lost.
"You have to realize that
UOP is a gqod team," he
stated, "and they play wel
more than they play poorly.
We played badly in streaks, and
that was the difference."

Wednesday, and against
Fresno State Friday night
before meeting N0.9 ranked
UC-Santa Barbara in a final
home match N0v.22.

Shaw said he believes that his
team should have walked away
with a three game win
"We were totally in control
of the of the match, but in
games two and three we just
tried too hard. VVe made some
mistakes, and we let them of
the hook," he said.
Shaw pointed to the fine play
and leadership of senior
Linden and Chris Anderson in
the Card effort, adding how
ever, that the match was a team
effort whether the squad won
or lost.
"You have to realize that
UOP is a gqod team," he
stated, "and they play wel
more than they play poorly.
We played badly in streaks, and
that was the difference."
Stanford will close out its
conference schedule on the
road against San Jose State next
Wednesday, and against
Fresno State Friday night
before meeting N0.9 ranked
UC-Santa Barbara in a final
home match N0v.22.
