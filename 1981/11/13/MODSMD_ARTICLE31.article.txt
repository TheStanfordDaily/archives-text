### Adam Berns 
The Stanford soccer team sharp
ened its axe Wednesday and pre
pared to chop down its third giant of
the season. After beating two of the
best teams in the nation earlier in the
year, Air Force and the University of
Cennecticut, the Cardinals knew
they could play with anybody.
Although they put out a valiant ef
fort Wednesday, Stanford came up
just short, losing to the University of
san Francisco Dons 1-0.
Except for the first ten minutes,
Stanford dominated the action. Be
cause USf had a tendency to bring in
their fullbacks, Stanford used quick
counters with great success all after
noon and came close to scoring on
several occassions.
The effort by the Cardinals was one
of their best of the season. Again
Stanford showed that it has the ability

to play with any team in the nation.
After the game, USF coach Steve
Neguesto said to Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge, "We just got by." He
was obviously very impressed with
Stanford's team, especially its ability
to neutralize Don striker Fidelis
Atuegbu and the rest of USF's potent
offense.
The Cards started out slowly. USF
controlledthe game for the first ten
minutes, dominating the action and
finally scoring when freshman mid
fielder Thierry Blanson booted in a
ball with an assist from Atuegbu. At
this point in the game, it didn't look
like the Cards would be able to han
dle Atuegbu or the rest of the Don's
attack.
However, after the goat, Stanford
started to get its own offense moving.
The Cardinals noticed that USF was
vulnerable to quick counters,
and finally started to execute
their gameplan. Although
Stanford had several quick
breaks on the Don goal, it
wasn't able to acore and the
half ended with the Dons
ahead by a score of 1-0.
Stanford came out fired up in
the second half and continued
where they left off. By controll
ing the terrYpo of the game with
their counters they were able
to keep the ball away from
Atuegbu and effectively neu
tralized USF's offense.
Stanford had several good
opportunities to score but un
fortunately wasn't able to con
vert any of them into points.

Probably their best op
portunity came midway
through the half when the
Cardinals had a corner kick.
The ball was nicely centered on
the ground a couple of feet in
front of the Don goal.
By keeping the ball on the
ground, Stanford took ev
eryone by surprise including, it
seemed, themselves. For what
seemed like hours, no one on
either team moved for the ball.
Finally the USF goalie pounced
on the ball, ending the great
opportunity.
USF also had a couple of op
portunities to score in the sec
ond half, hlowever, freshman
goalie Willie Burkhart did an
excellent job, making several

nice saves, and the defense in
general played very well.
With time running out in the
second half, Stanford made a
couple of last ditch efforts to
score. During the closing
minutes the referee gave three
USF players yellow cards as the
Dons were obviously worried
about Stanford's offense. Un
fortunately, the Cardinals were
unable to score and USF came
out ahead.
After the game, Lodge said
that he was quite pleased with
the way his team played. "Our
lads played very well," he said.
"We controlled the second
half and had two unbelievably
good opportunities to score,

but couldn't quite put it away."
Tomorrow the Cardinals
take on UC-Santa Barbara in
their final game of the season.
This matchup is especially in
teresting because of the large
number of local products on
Santa Barbara's team.
Santa Barbara is a very physi
cal team which also has a lot of
talent. "They are kind of across
between the physical stye of
Berkeley and the finesse of
Fresno," Lodge said.
One of their best assets is
their ability to utilize the long
ball out of their defense. They
are also an incredibly energetic
team and do not hesitate to
play physical ball.

minutes the referee gave three
USF players yellow cards as the
Dons were obviously worried
about Stanford's offense. Un
fortunately, the Cardinals were
unable to score and USF came
out ahead.
After the game, Lodge said
that he was quite pleased with
the way his team played. "Our
lads played very well," he said.
"We controlled the second
half and had two unbelievably
good opportunities to score,

but couldn't quite put it away."
Tomorrow the Cardinals
take on UC-Santa Barbara in
their final game of the season.
This matchup is especially in
teresting because of the large
number of local products on
Santa Barbara's team.
Santa Barbara is a very physi
cal team which also has a lot of
talent. "They are kind of across
between the physical stye of
Berkeley and the finesse of
Fresno," Lodge said.
One of their best assets is
their ability to utilize the long
ball out of their defense. They
are also an incredibly energetic
team and do not hesitate to
play physical ball.
The Stanford soccer team sharp
ened its axe Wednesday and pre
pared to chop down its third giant of
the season. After beating two of the
best teams in the nation earlier in the
year, Air Force and the University of
Cennecticut, the Cardinals knew
they could play with anybody.
Although they put out a valiant ef
fort Wednesday, Stanford came up
just short, losing to the University of
san Francisco Dons 1-0.
Except for the first ten minutes,
Stanford dominated the action. Be
cause USf had a tendency to bring in
their fullbacks, Stanford used quick
counters with great success all after
noon and came close to scoring on
several occassions.
The effort by the Cardinals was one
of their best of the season. Again
Stanford showed that it has the ability

to play with any team in the nation.
After the game, USF coach Steve
Neguesto said to Stanford coach
Nelson Lodge, "We just got by." He
was obviously very impressed with
Stanford's team, especially its ability
to neutralize Don striker Fidelis
Atuegbu and the rest of USF's potent
offense.
The Cards started out slowly. USF
controlledthe game for the first ten
minutes, dominating the action and
finally scoring when freshman mid
fielder Thierry Blanson booted in a
ball with an assist from Atuegbu. At
this point in the game, it didn't look
like the Cards would be able to han
dle Atuegbu or the rest of the Don's
attack.
However, after the goat, Stanford
started to get its own offense moving.
The Cardinals noticed that USF was
vulnerable to quick counters,
and finally started to execute
their gameplan. Although
Stanford had several quick
breaks on the Don goal, it
wasn't able to acore and the
half ended with the Dons
ahead by a score of 1-0.
Stanford came out fired up in
the second half and continued
where they left off. By controll
ing the terrYpo of the game with
their counters they were able
to keep the ball away from
Atuegbu and effectively neu
tralized USF's offense.
Stanford had several good
opportunities to score but un
fortunately wasn't able to con
vert any of them into points.

Probably their best op
portunity came midway
through the half when the
Cardinals had a corner kick.
The ball was nicely centered on
the ground a couple of feet in
front of the Don goal.
By keeping the ball on the
ground, Stanford took ev
eryone by surprise including, it
seemed, themselves. For what
seemed like hours, no one on
either team moved for the ball.
Finally the USF goalie pounced
on the ball, ending the great
opportunity.
USF also had a couple of op
portunities to score in the sec
ond half, hlowever, freshman
goalie Willie Burkhart did an
excellent job, making several

nice saves, and the defense in
general played very well.
With time running out in the
second half, Stanford made a
couple of last ditch efforts to
score. During the closing
minutes the referee gave three
USF players yellow cards as the
Dons were obviously worried
about Stanford's offense. Un
fortunately, the Cardinals were
unable to score and USF came
out ahead.
After the game, Lodge said
