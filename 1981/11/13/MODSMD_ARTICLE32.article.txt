# Cardinal water poloists travel to wily Bears' Harmon Pool
## 
### Chris Addington 
Harmon Pool, located on the
UC-Berkeley campus, is a phrase
thatstrikesfear in the heartsofwa
ter polo teams up and down the
State of California. In this pool
winning streaks are snapped,
rankings shift and losses by the vis
itors are more than frequent.
Built in the 19305, Harmon Pool,
home of the Cal water polo team,
is not the typical water polo facil
ity to which most teams are ac
customed. The pool is only five
feet deep, and the Berkeley
poloists know how to use all of its
oddities to their full advantage.
This afternoon, the Stanford
Cardinals travel across the bay for
their first game against Berkeley
since early in the season. How
ever, there is no way the No.l
ranked, 26-0 Cardinals are taking a
defeatist attitude into the match.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti had a few comments.
"In a small pool," Dettamanti
said, "you have many more scor
ing opportunities and we have the
best offense in the nation (Stan
ford outscores its opponents
2.5-1). We've practiced in the
small pool here this week and

we're going up there 'and make
them play defense."
Why should No 1 Stanford be
taking precautions against N0.6
California, a team it defeated 13-4
earlier in the season? For one
thing, Stanford has won only one
game at Berkeley in the last 10
years. That was theye f ar Cal was so
bad it didn't even qualify for the
NCAA's.
Furthermore, even though the
Bears are not highly ranked, they
have only lost once at home this
season â€” against UC-lrvine. Cal
has knocked off such national
powers as N0.2 CS-Long Beach,
N0.5 UCLA and N0.7 USC.
The young Berkeley Bears are
paced by two 6-foot-7 giants
named Jay Krether and Calvin
Lowell. The Cal bench also in
cludes several freshmen recruits
who play for the U.S. Junior Na
tional Team. The young squad had
a poor start this season but its
playing in the last few weeks has
been much more cohesive.
The Cardinals are lead by Olym
pian Jody Campbell and Ail-
Americans Alan Mouchawar,
Chris Kelsey and James Betgeson.
