# Men harriers host all- important District-8 race tomorrow

The Stanford golf course, sight of the
women's NCAA Regional Cross Cnun
trychampionships Monday, will be the
focus of attention again tomorrow morn
ing when the men's Pacific-10 District-8
Championships take place.
The Stanford women's team qualified
for the Nationals Monday, but the men's
squad has its work cut out to match that
feat. The Cards will be fighting 21 squads
from the Pac-10 and PCAA schools for only
two qualifying berths to the NCAA Cham
pionships.
According to Stanford assistant coach
Tom Pagani, three teams have advanced to
Nationals from each regional competition
in the past, but the NCAA has decided that
Regionals should be more selective.
"The whole NCAA field has been re
duced so that the number of runners in the
national meet can be back," Pagani said.
"Therefore, it's going to be even more
competitive. It's been traditional that the

Pac-10 has several strong cross country
teams — usually Washington State, Oie
gon, and the University of Washington —
not just two."
Head coach Mike Tomasello sees the
race developing as a struggle between five
teams: the 1980 Pac-10 champion UCLA,
the University of Arizona, the University of
Oregon, UC-Berkeley and Stanford.
"Only Arizona has five runners who are
strong," Tomasello explained. "The other
four contenders are four (solid) runners
deep. We're looking fora good effort from
Brian Pettingill to help pull us thiough. It's
going to be a very close race; incredibly
tight in the scoring."
Stanford will rely on >outh, Tomasello
added. Of the top five Card runners, only
one is a senior, and only one a junior. Sen
ior Rod Berry, who took ninth in last year's
Pac-10 race, is the team captain and top
runner. Other key runners are junior Bill
Graham, sophomores Eric Sappenfield,
Jim Smith and David Frank, and Pettingill, a

freshman.
1 lie team has had an up and down year,
winning the Fresno and Cal Poly Invita
tional* in impiesive style, but finishing a
disappointing fourth at the Stanford Invite.
Pagani attributed the disparity to an in
ability to get solid performances fiom all its
runners in the same race.
"It's been a case of somebody getting
sick at the wrong time or just having a bad
day. You can't do that in cross country and
win. If the first five don't run fast you can
get blown away," he said.
Nonetheless Tomasello is optimistic
iibout the race, and observed that his
: unners have been doing well lately.
"We've just been trying to stay healthy
these last four or five days," he said. "Our
fiist three runners will have to stay togeth
er — I think that's the key. Being at home
helps a lot too; we usually do well here.
There's no reason why we can't run our
very best."
The race begins at 11 a.m. and will be the
last home appearance of the 1981 season.

IT'S REGIONALS IIMF AGAIN — The Stanford men's cross country team will host the
Pacilic-10 Conference/NCAA District 8 Championships tomorrow. Junior Bill Graham,
shown here in action last year, is indicative of the young runners coach Mike Tomasello
has had to rely on this year during the harriers' up and down campaign.
