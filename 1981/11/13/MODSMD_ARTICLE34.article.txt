### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Mc-
Clatchy Newspapers asked yes
terday fora federal restraining
order to prevent the San Fran
cisco 49ers from excluding a
woman sportswriter from the
locker room.
The U.S. District Court com
plaint said Sacramento Bee re
porter Michele Himmelberg
suffered sex discrimination and
violation of constitutional
rights when the National Foot
ball League team barred her
from the post-game locker
room for interviews.
The newspaper complained

that while Ms. Himmelberg is
excluded, "male news media
representatives" have free ac
cess to the locker room after
games.
"The denial of such access to
plaintiff... is predicated solely
on the basis of sex and deprives
all plaintiffs of their right to
gather. . . news under the Fiist
Amendment of the Constitu
tion. . ."
The complaint specifically
asked that the 49ers be re
strained from keeping
Himmelberg out of the locker
loom at next Sunday's game

against the Cleveland Browns.
Unless issued, said the com
plaint, "plaintiffs shall he de
nied equal access to the 49er
team members and its
coaches."
The complaint asked fora
temporary restraining order
guaranteeing Himmelberg
equal access to the locker
room "in the same manner and
extent as male news media rep
resentatives."
The suit did not ask for dam
ages, but asked the court to or
der the 49ers to pay court costs.
George Heddleston, public

relations director, said the
team was aware of the suit and
and it was in the hands of 44er
attorneys.
He pointed out that the NFL
has no policy on permitting
women into locker rooms,
leaving the matter up to indi
vidual teams.
Heddleston said the team's
decision was made by coach
and general manager Bill
Walsh.
"We just feel the players
should have some sort of
privacy," Heddleston said.
