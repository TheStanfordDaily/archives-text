# It's a matter of intensity
## V. Williams bolsters secondary 
### Nick Gault 
What can you say about
Stanford's defensive secon
dary this year?
For the first few games it
looked as if they de
velop into the first solid
group of backs Stanford has
had in years. Then, a series
of injuries forced the team
to go with largely inex
perienced freshmen and
the result has been devas
tating.
After the Arizona State
massacre, when the secon
dary was victimized for sev
en touchdowns and 466
passing yards, defensive co
ordinator Jack Harbaugh
was asked if it was fair to
characterize Stanford's sec
ondary as one that doesn't
hit hard.
"It's fair," he answered.
"We just aren't good back
there. We seem to drag re
ceivers down after a catch,
whereas our opponents
knock them down."
There is, however, one
Cardinal defensive back for

whom that description does
not hold. Any of the Stan
ford coaches will tell you
the same. He is sophomore
strong safety Vaughn Wil
liams and he has come to be
known, in less than two sea
sons, as one of the most
capable and intimidating
DBs in the Pacific-10 Con
ference.
Williams surprised a lot of
people when he landed a
starting berth in the
Cardinal defensive
backfield at the outset of his
freshman year. It didn't take
long, though, before all un
derstood why: his abilities
and intensity were
enormous and his poise was
that of a senior. Nobody was
surprised, then, when he
was selected to Football
News' Freshman All-Ameri
ca First Team.
Williams has established
himself as the cornerstone
of the Stanford secondary
and a most valuable part of
the defensive team. Head

coach Paul Wiggin said,
"Vaughn was probably our
most productive defensive
player last year. Now, when
we talk about attack in our
defensive system, the first
person we talk about is
Vaughn Williams."
Experience has made Wil
liams better as a sophomore
than he was as a freshman.
He now impresses you as an
extremely intelligent, de
fender.
"As a defensive back in
college football you do im
prove with time," the 6-
foot-3, 190-pounder said.
"You need exposure to of
fenses to find out exactly
what they can do to you,
which is a lot. Being more
familiar has helped me a
great deal to understand
and read all the complex of
fenses we face."
The ruggedness in
Vaughn Williams hasn't
changed one iota since last
year, though. He has con
sistently punished any of
fensive player to come into

his range this season. His
safety blitz on Arizona quar
terback Tom Tunnicliffe still
has people talking. Star
UCLA wide receiver Cor
mack Carney said he fears
Williams as much as any de
fensive back he has faced.
"It's intensity, that's all,"
Williams remarked in what
has to be somewhat of an
understatement.
Williams shies away from
the suggestion he is in a class
by himself amongst Stan
ford defensive backs. "I just
have a few more games un
der my belt," he said.
Softspoken always, all he
will tell you is this: "I'm ex
cited to be playing with a
secondary that's young, and
that's going to be together
fora few years (referring to
freshmen Eric Price and
Darry I Grissum and
sophomore Charles
Hutchings). I feel I'm part of
something that's improving
— we're going to get much
better,"

HE'S VAUNTED AND UNDAUNTED — Vaughn Williams,
the Cardinals' blue-chip sophomore strong safety,
showed his potential the minute he arrived on the Farm. A
bright light this year within a frequently shadowy secon
dary, Williams has butressed his team with contagious in
tensity.
What can you say about
Stanford's defensive secon
dary this year?
For the first few games it
looked as if they de
velop into the first solid
group of backs Stanford has
had in years. Then, a series
of injuries forced the team
to go with largely inex
perienced freshmen and
the result has been devas
tating.
After the Arizona State
massacre, when the secon
dary was victimized for sev
en touchdowns and 466
passing yards, defensive co
ordinator Jack Harbaugh
was asked if it was fair to
characterize Stanford's sec
ondary as one that doesn't
hit hard.
"It's fair," he answered.
"We just aren't good back
there. We seem to drag re
ceivers down after a catch,
whereas our opponents
knock them down."
There is, however, one
Cardinal defensive back for

whom that description does
not hold. Any of the Stan
ford coaches will tell you
the same. He is sophomore
strong safety Vaughn Wil
liams and he has come to be
known, in less than two sea
sons, as one of the most
capable and intimidating
DBs in the Pacific-10 Con
ference.
Williams surprised a lot of
people when he landed a
starting berth in the
Cardinal defensive
backfield at the outset of his
freshman year. It didn't take
long, though, before all un
derstood why: his abilities
and intensity were
enormous and his poise was
that of a senior. Nobody was
surprised, then, when he
was selected to Football
News' Freshman All-Ameri
ca First Team.
Williams has established
himself as the cornerstone
of the Stanford secondary
and a most valuable part of
the defensive team. Head

coach Paul Wiggin said,
"Vaughn was probably our
most productive defensive
player last year. Now, when
we talk about attack in our
defensive system, the first
person we talk about is
Vaughn Williams."
Experience has made Wil
liams better as a sophomore
than he was as a freshman.
He now impresses you as an
extremely intelligent, de
fender.
"As a defensive back in
college football you do im
prove with time," the 6-
foot-3, 190-pounder said.
"You need exposure to of
fenses to find out exactly
what they can do to you,
which is a lot. Being more
familiar has helped me a
great deal to understand
and read all the complex of
fenses we face."
The ruggedness in
Vaughn Williams hasn't
changed one iota since last
year, though. He has con
sistently punished any of
fensive player to come into

his range this season. His
safety blitz on Arizona quar
terback Tom Tunnicliffe still
has people talking. Star
UCLA wide receiver Cor
mack Carney said he fears
Williams as much as any de
fensive back he has faced.
"It's intensity, that's all,"
Williams remarked in what
has to be somewhat of an
understatement.
Williams shies away from
the suggestion he is in a class
by himself amongst Stan
ford defensive backs. "I just
have a few more games un
der my belt," he said.
Softspoken always, all he
will tell you is this: "I'm ex
cited to be playing with a
secondary that's young, and
that's going to be together
fora few years (referring to
freshmen Eric Price and
Darry I Grissum and
sophomore Charles
Hutchings). I feel I'm part of
something that's improving
— we're going to get much
better,"
