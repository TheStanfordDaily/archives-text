# Boys Town center lawsuit still pending
## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
Stanford's Boys Town Center for the Study of
Youth Development suffered drastic cuts in re
search and staff last year when its $500,000 annual
funding was abruptly cut off by Father Flanagan's
Boys Home.
Officials at the Nebraska-based Home said that
they had discovered that their charter did not pro
vide the authority necessary to enter into the 25-
year contract with the University that took effect
beginning in 1974.
Last March, the University, supported by Catho
lic University in Washington, D.C. which houses a
similar project, filed a breach of contract suit
against the FJome, a non-profit charitable corpo
ration.
In May, the University lost the opening round of
the court battle when a Santa Clara County Court
judge ruled that California was not an appropriate
forum for the contest.
The University filed again in the U.S. District
Court in Nebraska. The federal judge died this
summer, and Stanford is now waiting fora new
judge to be assigned.
University Counsel )ohn Schwartz said he un
derstood that the appointment of a judge to the
case is "imminent."
The first motion to be considered when the case
reconvenes is Boys Town's request to move the
proceedings to a Nebraska State Court. "Right
now we're just engaged in procedural jockeying to
determine where it's going to be held," said J.
Merrill Carlsmith, director of the Boys Town Cen

ter.
The University provided some funding last year
so the center could meet its obligations. "We re
ceived a good deal of support from the Univer
sity," said Carlsmith. "To keep the core of the cen
ter alive, they agreed to keep us going on a bare
bones budget."
With regard to this funding, Carlsmith said he
could not give a precise figure. "It's difficult to say
exactly — a lot less than we were receiving from
Omaha," he said. "They (the University) provide
us with the bare minimum to keep the place func
tioning at a viable intellectual level. How long we'll
be able to continue no one knows at this point."
However, Carlsmith said he feels the Boys Town
money will eventually be restored. "We are
hopeful about the outcome of the lawsuit," he
said. "We think our position is a strong one."
Some of the research projects sponsored by the
center were shortened due to the funding cuts.
Current projects include studies on the impact of
early and late sexual maturation on adolescents,
studies on infants born at risk, and studies on the
effects of foster care on abused and neglected chil
dren. A pioneering study on the impact of day
care on young children is being written now.'
"The attraction and strength of the tenter was
the guarantee of continuous funding over lengthy
periods of time, a very rare situation in the United
States," said Carlsmith. "There's much less longitu
dinal research being conducted lately — it's scary
to embark On a five-year project with two years of
funding."

Oneofthemain projects currently sponsored by
the Boys Town Center is the Bay Area Foster Care
Study, headed by Carlsmith, Law Prof. Michael
Wald and Psychiatry Prof. P. Herbert Liedermann.
According to Wald, the purpose of the study is to
"come up with standards to be used by courts and
social service agencies in deciding whether to
leave neglected or abused children" in their
homes.
Wald said the loss of the Boys Town money
created "substantial problems" for the project, but
that the investigators were able to continue on
donations from private sources and $50,000 from
the University.
Sueann Ambron, research assistant at the center,
headed the day-care study. Calling the study
"without a doubt the best project (of its kind) that's
ever been done," she said that the loss of funding
prevented the researchers from pursuing their re
search.
Carlsmith said the biggest cuts in the program
were in the number of affiliated graduate students,
which has gone from 25 to one, and in the number
of secretarial and administrative staff members. All
of the regular faculty members and research fel
lows have retained their positions.
Father Flanagan's Boys Home houses 400 or
phans, delinquents and underprivileged children.
Charges by the Omaha Star in 1972 that the net
worth of the Home was increasing at four times the
amount needed to run it, led to the devotion of $15
million of the Home's budget for the funding of
youth development research centers such as the
$1.5 million facility here.

reconvenes is Boys Town's request to move the
proceedings to a Nebraska State Court. "Right
now we're just engaged in procedural jockeying to
determine where it's going to be held," said J.
Merrill Carlsmith, director of the Boys Town Cen

ter.
The University provided some funding last year
so the center could meet its obligations. "We re
ceived a good deal of support from the Univer
sity," said Carlsmith. "To keep the core of the cen
ter alive, they agreed to keep us going on a bare
bones budget."
With regard to this funding, Carlsmith said he
could not give a precise figure. "It's difficult to say
exactly — a lot less than we were receiving from
Omaha," he said. "They (the University) provide
us with the bare minimum to keep the place func
tioning at a viable intellectual level. How long we'll
be able to continue no one knows at this point."
However, Carlsmith said he feels the Boys Town
money will eventually be restored. "We are
hopeful about the outcome of the lawsuit," he
said. "We think our position is a strong one."
Some of the research projects sponsored by the
center were shortened due to the funding cuts.
Current projects include studies on the impact of
early and late sexual maturation on adolescents,
studies on infants born at risk, and studies on the
effects of foster care on abused and neglected chil
dren. A pioneering study on the impact of day
care on young children is being written now.'
"The attraction and strength of the tenter was
the guarantee of continuous funding over lengthy
periods of time, a very rare situation in the United
States," said Carlsmith. "There's much less longitu
dinal research being conducted lately — it's scary
to embark On a five-year project with two years of
funding."

Oneofthemain projects currently sponsored by
the Boys Town Center is the Bay Area Foster Care
Study, headed by Carlsmith, Law Prof. Michael
Wald and Psychiatry Prof. P. Herbert Liedermann.
According to Wald, the purpose of the study is to
"come up with standards to be used by courts and
social service agencies in deciding whether to
leave neglected or abused children" in their
homes.
Wald said the loss of the Boys Town money
created "substantial problems" for the project, but
that the investigators were able to continue on
donations from private sources and $50,000 from
the University.
Sueann Ambron, research assistant at the center,
headed the day-care study. Calling the study
"without a doubt the best project (of its kind) that's
ever been done," she said that the loss of funding
prevented the researchers from pursuing their re
search.
Carlsmith said the biggest cuts in the program
were in the number of affiliated graduate students,
which has gone from 25 to one, and in the number
of secretarial and administrative staff members. All
of the regular faculty members and research fel
lows have retained their positions.
Father Flanagan's Boys Home houses 400 or
phans, delinquents and underprivileged children.
Charges by the Omaha Star in 1972 that the net
worth of the Home was increasing at four times the
amount needed to run it, led to the devotion of $15
million of the Home's budget for the funding of
youth development research centers such as the
$1.5 million facility here.
Stanford's Boys Town Center for the Study of
Youth Development suffered drastic cuts in re
search and staff last year when its $500,000 annual
funding was abruptly cut off by Father Flanagan's
Boys Home.
Officials at the Nebraska-based Home said that
they had discovered that their charter did not pro
vide the authority necessary to enter into the 25-
year contract with the University that took effect
beginning in 1974.
Last March, the University, supported by Catho
lic University in Washington, D.C. which houses a
similar project, filed a breach of contract suit
against the FJome, a non-profit charitable corpo
ration.
In May, the University lost the opening round of
the court battle when a Santa Clara County Court
judge ruled that California was not an appropriate
forum for the contest.
The University filed again in the U.S. District
Court in Nebraska. The federal judge died this
summer, and Stanford is now waiting fora new
judge to be assigned.
University Counsel )ohn Schwartz said he un
derstood that the appointment of a judge to the
case is "imminent."
The first motion to be considered when the case
reconvenes is Boys Town's request to move the
proceedings to a Nebraska State Court. "Right
