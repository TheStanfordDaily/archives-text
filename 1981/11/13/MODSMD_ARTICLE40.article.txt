Jack Dejohnette's Special Edi
tion
The Cold Rush/San Jose
9 November 1981
The readers of Downbeat
magazine did no injustice to
the jazz world last year by vot
ing Jack De Johnette as their fa
vorite drummer. Playing with
his Special Edition last Monday
night at San Jose's Gold Rush,
De Johnette showdd he defi
nitely deserves such a recogni
tion.
In arranging his hour and 15
minute set, De Johnette chose
four diverse songs, with ample
time in them to display his tal
ents and let the three others to
do a little showing off as well.
De Johnette's Special Edition is
an extremely versatile band,
their music ranging from
avant-garde to contemporary
jazz to even straight blues.
Adding to their diversity is an
array of saxophones and flutes,
expertly played by Chico Free
man and John Purcell. Acoustic
bassist Peter Warren possesses
the ability to keep a good
rhythm no matter what type of
song the group is performing.
And besides his magnificent
drumming skills, De Johnette is
no slouch at the piano.
The quartet opened with a
song entitled "Tin Can Alley,"
from their latest album. Free
man began with a lucid tenor

saxophonesoloand Purcellfol
lowed with one of equal quali
ty on the baritone sax. Warren
soloed next, showing that he
could play all parts of the bass
fairly well, although not as pre
cisely as other good contem
porary jazz bassists. In a word,
Warren was adequate.
Throughout the tune, there
were intermittent blasts of
awesome talent from De John
ette. As his eyes were closed
during most solos, De Johnette
demonstrated that his drums
are his best friend and vice ver
sa.
The only flaw in their per
formance of the first number
was in the ending. Instead of
simply finishing the song, the
quartet opted fora hectic con
clusion, their version of re
verberating guitars at the end
of a "heavy metal" roGk tune.
For the group's next song,
De Johnette moved over to the
piano. With Freeman and
Purcell both playing flutes, and
without the aid of Warren's
bass, this soft piano flute com
bination sounded like a very
graceful beginning to a song.
However, the flute summit
lasted for upwards of five
minutes, at which point in time
I realized that I was incorrect in
my assumption.
Finally, that song having
ended, De JohrVette started the
next number alone on the pi
ano. He played a bluesy,
Crusaders-like introduction, a

drastic change from the two
previous songs, which drifted
between avant-garde and con
temporary jazz. De Johnette's
keyboard solo was the best of
the evening, as he transformed
the emotion present on his
face onto the keys, ultimately
producing a wonderful sound.
When the rest of the band
joined in, De Johnette re
turned to his drums to exhibit
his amazing fusion of finesse,
quickness and accuracy during
breaks in the music. Perhaps
the key to his fantastic per
formance was that he did not
solo for longer than 10 or 15
seconds at any one time, so the
listener did not lose the basic
tune of the song.
After a fast, emotional sax
solo by Freeman, the quartet
jumped into its final number,
"I Know,"a slow blues tune.
The song was by far the eve
ning's best. De Johnette pro
vided the vocals, which con
sisted of telling a humorous
story and singing "I Know"a
hundred or so times. Although
there were no outstanding
solos in"I Know" (the song
didn't require any), De John
ette could have done no more
at that point to convince the
audience that as a drummer he
is not good, not even great, but
the best. After the per
formance, if a member of the
audience were told that Jack
De Johnette is the world's
greatest drummer, he would
simply reply, "I know. ..

his amazing fusion of finesse,

the key to his fantastic per

seconds at any one time, so the
listener did not lose the basic
tune of the song.

didn't require any), De John

Jack Dejohnette's Special Edi
tion
The Cold Rush/San Jose
9 November 1981
The readers of Downbeat
magazine did no injustice to
the jazz world last year by vot
ing Jack De Johnette as their fa
vorite drummer. Playing with
his Special Edition last Monday
night at San Jose's Gold Rush,
De Johnette showdd he defi
nitely deserves such a recogni
tion.
In arranging his hour and 15
minute set, De Johnette chose
four diverse songs, with ample
time in them to display his tal
ents and let the three others to
do a little showing off as well.
De Johnette's Special Edition is
an extremely versatile band,
their music ranging from
avant-garde to contemporary
jazz to even straight blues.
Adding to their diversity is an
array of saxophones and flutes,
expertly played by Chico Free
man and John Purcell. Acoustic
bassist Peter Warren possesses
the ability to keep a good
rhythm no matter what type of
song the group is performing.
And besides his magnificent
drumming skills, De Johnette is
no slouch at the piano.
The quartet opened with a
song entitled "Tin Can Alley,"
from their latest album. Free
man began with a lucid tenor

saxophonesoloand Purcellfol
lowed with one of equal quali
ty on the baritone sax. Warren
soloed next, showing that he
could play all parts of the bass
fairly well, although not as pre
cisely as other good contem
porary jazz bassists. In a word,
Warren was adequate.
Throughout the tune, there
were intermittent blasts of
awesome talent from De John
ette. As his eyes were closed
during most solos, De Johnette
demonstrated that his drums
are his best friend and vice ver
sa.
The only flaw in their per
formance of the first number
was in the ending. Instead of
simply finishing the song, the
quartet opted fora hectic con
clusion, their version of re
verberating guitars at the end
of a "heavy metal" roGk tune.
For the group's next song,
De Johnette moved over to the
piano. With Freeman and
Purcell both playing flutes, and
without the aid of Warren's
bass, this soft piano flute com
bination sounded like a very
graceful beginning to a song.
However, the flute summit
lasted for upwards of five
minutes, at which point in time
I realized that I was incorrect in
my assumption.
Finally, that song having
ended, De JohrVette started the
next number alone on the pi
ano. He played a bluesy,
Crusaders-like introduction, a

drastic change from the two
previous songs, which drifted
between avant-garde and con
temporary jazz. De Johnette's
keyboard solo was the best of
the evening, as he transformed
the emotion present on his
face onto the keys, ultimately
producing a wonderful sound.
When the rest of the band
joined in, De Johnette re
turned to his drums to exhibit
his amazing fusion of finesse,
quickness and accuracy during
breaks in the music. Perhaps
the key to his fantastic per
formance was that he did not
