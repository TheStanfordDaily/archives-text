# Grace Jones is in town? Quick! Hide the kids!

Grace Jones
Market Street Cinema/San Francisco
5 November 1981
The curtains opened last Thursday night at
the Cinema to reveal a gorilla standing atop a
20-foot podium writhing at the hips pound
ing a drum to the throbbing sounds of a wired
rhythm section. Suddenly the ape's head flew
off, revealing a stunning, angular, black face
that could have been on the cover of Cos
mopolitan except that, well. . . she had a flat
top crew cut and a decidedly unfeminine de
meanor. Grace Jones was back in town.
Neither the face — more precisely, the im
age — nor her indomitable, clarion voice dis
appointed the essentially well-mannered and
square crowd that came to see her "One Man
Show" that headlined at the Market Street
Cinema last week.
The crowd was, strangely enough, middle
aged, conservatively dressed, inordinately
decorous, showing that Jones has reached
beyond the disco crowd that followed her
through the 70s. Since she lopped off her
locks to create a new image, Jones now ap
peals to a more, asthetically sensitive, even
avant-garde audience. But mainstream ap
peal is not totall/out of character. She is, after
all a Jamaican minister's daughter.
Grace Jones does not merely sing. She
presents a stunning visual display that when
combined with her hard, urban blight voice
and detached l-am-in-control demeanor,
produce one of the most unique acts around.
It's not easy to describe Jones. However, if
one wanted to come up with the antithesis of
Julie Andrews, Jones would be it. Tall, well
proportioned, slim and wearing distinctly
masculine attire (her shoulder pads would
put Darrin Nelson's in the shade)she moved
deliberately across the stage, breathing anger
and distance, demanding total submission
from the audience.
But it is her face that is so striking. With a
complexion so black it actually has a purple
blush to it and her finely chisled features and
cheekbones, she is definitely not — un
fortunately — the girl next door. Her hair, a
combination pillbox hat and 1950s "flattop"
serves to crown this unique personage. The
Jordache look she ain't.

The musical selections that night came
almost entirely from her recent album Night
clubbing. Under the tutelage of her new pro
ducer Chris Blackwell, Grace Jones has lept
from the world of disco to the harder, driving
sounds of new wave-influenced music. This
better compliments her image, which with a
new musical style, disproves the oft-leveled
charge by critics of "musical/visual
schizophrenia".
The evening began with the title cut from
"Nightclubbing" a song with an intense
monotone quality, moving to her rendition
of "Warm Leatherette" whose recording sig
nalled her stylistic move away from disco to
more of a New Wave influence. Her powerful
delivery and command of "Let's make love
before we die" would make Al Haig twitch
with fea r and excitement.
Other highlights of the evening included
what might be considered the Grace Jones
theme song,"Demolition Man." The song,
the best cut on her latest album, was per
formed with the requisite charismatic horror
one would expect from what the song calls "a
walking nightmare."
The pinnacle of the evening, clearly from
ihe audience's viewpoint, was her rendition
of "Pull Up to the Bumper." The portion of
the crowd not already on their feet suc
cumbed to its quick and easy dance rhythm.
The relative success in the charts and wide
airplay of this song may have given Grace the
breakthrough needed to achieve a larger fol
lowing among more mainstream music lis
teners.
One tiling was evident during the entire
evening: Grace Jones' voice was at its best.
The crystal clarity, excellent phrasing and
strong delivery left no doubt as to her musical
ability. The back-up rhythm section played
well, providing a solid moving vibrancy to
compliment Jones' vocal delivery. The only
flaw apparent during the performance was
the use of taped music.
Perhaps it was the acoustics in the hall, but
the taped music lacked real strength, playing
too much of a background role in the per
formance. None of the striking instrumental
plays apparent on the Nightclubbing album
came through (especially on "Demolition
Man"). Grace Jones needs and deserves a
complete, live backup band.
