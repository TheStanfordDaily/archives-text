## Thomas' brillant 'White Hotel' reincarnates Freud 
### Liz Rosner 
Jhe White Hotel
By D.M. Thomas
Viking Press
$12.95, 274 pp.
There is a masterful architect responsible
for The White I lotel; it is a brilliantly crafted
novel that weaves an intricate web of his
torical fact and erotic fantasy. Layered like a
montage is the story (based on a reconstruc
tion of one of Sigmund Freud's cases, "Frau
Anna G.") of one woman's hysteric neurosis,
with each sequenceof the book presenting a
unique dimension of depth and color.
We become intimate witnesses to the dra
matic unraveling of this woman's psyche —
exploring her present and her past, (even
glimpsing her future by means of her own
clairvoyance), probing into her sexual fan
tasies and childhood memories, until finally,
horrifyingly, we find ourselves witnessing
her execution in the ravines at Babi Yar.
Thus Thomas achieves a remarkable nex
us: an intertwining of psychoanalytical liter
ature with that of the Holocaust — with the
life of Lisa Erdman (Frau Anna G.) at their
conjunction. For it is through the character
of Lisa that we see reflections of the violent
spasms shaking Europe in the 1930'5.

The novel's recurrent theine follows Lisa
along a train journey to the White Hotel (lit
erally Bad Gastein, a health resort in the Aus
trian Alps). We see this episode through sev
eral lenses: Lisa's own distorted perceptions
— poetic, fantastical and violently erotic.
Then we study her through Freud's spec
tacles — intense, revealing, yet somehow
mysterious. Only by the middle of the book
does Thomas begin the conventional nar
rative tale, drawing us more and more deep
ly into the complex terrain of libido and the
terrifying scenario of Hitler's Europe.
Interplay between the two foci of sex and
death serves as the book's foundation; ac
cording to Thomas, they are the only two
subjects worth addressing. It is during
Freud's analysis of Frau Anna that he begins
to view her illness as representing a paradox
of human nature.
The train journey, reflecting Lisa's dreams
of death, draws her inexorably toward the
White Hotel, a symbol of the womb, and an
"auto-erotic paradise" for Lisa. But her ex
periences at the White Hotel reveal the in
tensity of this constant rivalry — "Eros in
combat with Thanatos" — as violent storms,
a fire and a flood cast "shadows of destruc
tiveness" over Lisa and her lover. The chaos

is at its fiercest during the moments of their
greatest pleasure, portraying Lisa's "im
perious demand to poison the well of her
pleasure at its source."
Later in the book, as we follow Lisa
through her married life in Russia during the

1930'5, we see how Freud's theories begin to
commingle with Hitler's realities. The train
journey as a symbol of death takes on very
literal significance. Lisa has said to Freud, "I
have always found it difficult to enjoy myself
properly, knowing there were people suffer
ing 'just the other side of the hill.' And there
always are." We can't help being struck by
the timeliness of her insight.
One is reminded of another character in
Holocaust literature from Elie Wiesel's Night
— the mad woman on the deportation train
whose terrible visions of a furnace devour
ing Jews are believed only when the train ac
tually arrives at Auschwitz. Similarly, when
Lisa stands at the edge of the ravine at Babi
Var, we experiece a painful deja vu, for we
have already seen Lisa's psychic vision of this
execution long ago. "Those whom Medusa
petrifies have glimpsed her face before, at a
time when they could not name her."
Thomas' occasional footnotes often serve
to remind us of particular historical facts;
e.g. one note refers to the burning of Freud's
works on a bonfire in Berlin, 1933, and an
other comment by Thomas interjects his sug
gestion that Freud's "unusual emphasis on
the mother's role" during his analysis of Frau
Anna may be related to the recent death of

Freud's own mother.
It is during the scene at Babi Yar, however,
that Thomas' voice takes on its most pow
erful resonance, and the rendering of this
event is particularly overwhelming. "But ev
er, one of them had dreamed dreams, seen
visions and had amazing experiences, even
the babes in arms (perhaps especially the
babes in arms) . . If a Sigmund Freud had
been listening and taking notes from the
time of Adam, he would still not fully have
explored even a single group, even a single
person."
Although it is difficult to follow this scene
with anything resembling a "happy ending,"
Thomas does not close on a note of despair.
The final sequence of the book returns us to
the White Hotel, placing a beautiful, trans
lucent layer over the entire story One critic
has suggested that rhis place resembles
Palestine in 1941, and in fact the characters
are described as "immigrants, .. . listless. . .
skeletal . . . and patient " Thomas seems to
be reminding us of the fine line between the
Holocaust's victims and its survivors, while at
the same time offering an optimistic vision of
those reaching the final stop of the chaotic,
nightmarish journey.

unique dimension of depth and color.
We become intimate witnesses to the dra
matic unraveling of this woman's psyche —
exploring her present and her past, (even
glimpsing her future by means of her own
clairvoyance), probing into her sexual fan
tasies and childhood memories, until finally,
horrifyingly, we find ourselves witnessing
her execution in the ravines at Babi Yar.
Thus Thomas achieves a remarkable nex
us: an intertwining of psychoanalytical liter
ature with that of the Holocaust — with the
life of Lisa Erdman (Frau Anna G.) at their
conjunction. For it is through the character
of Lisa that we see reflections of the violent
spasms shaking Europe in the 1930'5.

The novel's recurrent theine follows Lisa
along a train journey to the White Hotel (lit
erally Bad Gastein, a health resort in the Aus
trian Alps). We see this episode through sev
eral lenses: Lisa's own distorted perceptions
— poetic, fantastical and violently erotic.
Then we study her through Freud's spec
tacles — intense, revealing, yet somehow
mysterious. Only by the middle of the book
does Thomas begin the conventional nar
rative tale, drawing us more and more deep
ly into the complex terrain of libido and the
terrifying scenario of Hitler's Europe.
Interplay between the two foci of sex and
death serves as the book's foundation; ac
cording to Thomas, they are the only two
subjects worth addressing. It is during
Freud's analysis of Frau Anna that he begins
to view her illness as representing a paradox
of human nature.
The train journey, reflecting Lisa's dreams
of death, draws her inexorably toward the
White Hotel, a symbol of the womb, and an
"auto-erotic paradise" for Lisa. But her ex
periences at the White Hotel reveal the in
tensity of this constant rivalry — "Eros in
combat with Thanatos" — as violent storms,
a fire and a flood cast "shadows of destruc
tiveness" over Lisa and her lover. The chaos

is at its fiercest during the moments of their
greatest pleasure, portraying Lisa's "im
perious demand to poison the well of her
pleasure at its source."
Later in the book, as we follow Lisa
through her married life in Russia during the

1930'5, we see how Freud's theories begin to
commingle with Hitler's realities. The train
journey as a symbol of death takes on very
literal significance. Lisa has said to Freud, "I
have always found it difficult to enjoy myself
properly, knowing there were people suffer
ing 'just the other side of the hill.' And there
always are." We can't help being struck by
the timeliness of her insight.
One is reminded of another character in
Holocaust literature from Elie Wiesel's Night
— the mad woman on the deportation train
whose terrible visions of a furnace devour
ing Jews are believed only when the train ac
tually arrives at Auschwitz. Similarly, when
Lisa stands at the edge of the ravine at Babi
Var, we experiece a painful deja vu, for we
have already seen Lisa's psychic vision of this
execution long ago. "Those whom Medusa
petrifies have glimpsed her face before, at a
time when they could not name her."
Thomas' occasional footnotes often serve
to remind us of particular historical facts;
e.g. one note refers to the burning of Freud's
works on a bonfire in Berlin, 1933, and an
other comment by Thomas interjects his sug
gestion that Freud's "unusual emphasis on
the mother's role" during his analysis of Frau
Anna may be related to the recent death of

Freud's own mother.
It is during the scene at Babi Yar, however,
that Thomas' voice takes on its most pow
erful resonance, and the rendering of this
event is particularly overwhelming. "But ev
er, one of them had dreamed dreams, seen
visions and had amazing experiences, even
the babes in arms (perhaps especially the
babes in arms) . . If a Sigmund Freud had
been listening and taking notes from the
time of Adam, he would still not fully have
explored even a single group, even a single
person."
Although it is difficult to follow this scene
with anything resembling a "happy ending,"
Thomas does not close on a note of despair.
The final sequence of the book returns us to
the White Hotel, placing a beautiful, trans
lucent layer over the entire story One critic
has suggested that rhis place resembles
Palestine in 1941, and in fact the characters
are described as "immigrants, .. . listless. . .
skeletal . . . and patient " Thomas seems to
be reminding us of the fine line between the
Holocaust's victims and its survivors, while at
the same time offering an optimistic vision of
those reaching the final stop of the chaotic,
nightmarish journey.
