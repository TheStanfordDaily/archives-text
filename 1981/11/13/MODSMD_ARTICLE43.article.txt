In an excerpt from "Conrad's
Darkness," the last essay in The Return of
Eva Peron, V.S. Naipaul, describing Joseph
Conrad's "The Lagoon," comments on the
writer's nonresidence in his fiction. When
searching for the story behind the story
(and thus the writer behind the story), one
must look to sources that supplement fic
tion - sources in which the writer is
stripped of his protective anonymity, his
distance from the story.
Rarely is the rough, unpolished journal
istic legwork supporting the story made
available. This is due in part to the fiction
writers' inability to move from the indirect
circuity of prose to the forceful directness
of journalism.
Few authors (and more pertinent to the
publication of a work, publishers) are will
ing to risk marketing the man behind the
pen or the journalism behind the fiction.
V.S. Naipaul is a notable exception; The
Middle Passage, An Area of Darkness, In
dia: A Wounded Civilization, The Return
of Eva Peron and now Among the Be
lievers: An Islamic journey epitomize
Naipaul's uniqueness.
In The Middle Passage Naipaul con
fronts his fear of Trinidad, his home for 18
years and the setting of his early sardonic
fiction. An Area of Darkness and India: A
Wounded Civilization (especially the lat
ter) have allowed Naipaul to come to terms
with the South Asian subcontinent - his an
cestral homeland. In The Return of Eva
Peron Naipaul analyzesthedarkcomersof
Africa and South America and acknowl
edges the influence of Joseph Conrad, lit
erature's previous Third World voyager.
During his recent Islamic journey,
chronicled in Among the Believers,
Naipaul visited Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia and

Indonesia: four "half-made societies" re
lying on theocratic rule to consummate
the marriage of old values and new skills.
Pervading Naipaul's work of the past two
decades has been a perceptive foreboding
of the wide-spreading schisms of Third
World countries adapting their traditional
civilization to the dominant, "encircling
civilization" of the former colonialists.
Among the Believers portrays the Islam
ic response to the threat of absorption im
plicit in that "encircling civilization." Two
corollaries of Naipaul's general theory of
developmental dead end are the focal
points: (1) the hypocrisy of using yet abus
ing the West, and (2) the rage/calm
dichotomy of people complicated and
confused by layers of education, religion,
and politics.
The material is ripe for dry scholarly dis
section; but Naipaul's incisive knife cuts
through Islamic dogma and dialectic in a
personal manner. The reader looking for
ethnographic field work or political
analysis may be disappointed. Although
Naipaul does have an eye for ethnography
and political science, his Islamic journey is
just that: his Islamic journey. The journey
is as much an introspection as it is an ex
amination of neo-lslam. Naipaul's purpose
as a truth seeker is implied through his en
counters with Behzad, his Iranian guide,
and Shirazi, an Ayatollah at a religious
foundation in Qum.
Naipaul's honesty saturates Among the
Believers. He is not a researcher working in
a musty, static library; he is a traveler, a
journalist/novelist toiling through ex
plorations of Third World outposts. The
book is a response to the spoken words of
men servile to the Koran's writen word. If
the reader is to get an accurate picture of
these men's Islamic way of life, the writer
must be explicitly truthful. This is where
Naipaul is strongest: the truth — not
absolute truth, but rather Naipaul's truth
— is evident throughout his journey.

A secondary theme that Naipaul un
covers concerns the developing world's
hypocrital parasitism of the developed
world. The West, "emotionally rejected"
for its corrupt materialism, is shown the
welcome mat when seen as the salesman
of goods valued in the "great world
bazaar."
The contempt for parasitism is well
founded. But the parasitism and hypocrisy,
which throughout Naipaul's journey pi
qued his moralism, do not constitute the
essence of the work; they are but a small
part of a conscientious historian's grand vi
sion of The Third World.
Iranians were between "twin revolu
tions." Pakistanis looked backward to a
non-existant Islamic Utopia to move for
ward, anti-West in intent, anti-historical in
substance. Malays, using Islamic fun
damentalism to purify their oil-rich nation,
and Indonesians, also afflicted by the fun
damentalist "Malaysian disease," cor
rupted the Islam of Arabia to make extinct
the remnants of Hinduism and Buddhism.
The consequence of these divisions
which constantly destroyed and re
created societies was both rage and sereni
ty. There was no continuity; only
ephemeral moments were possible fora
people who had fractured their ancestral
continuity of descent.
But denying the "encircling civilization"
a place in the Muslim civilization is both in
tellectually unsatisfactory and economical
ly infeasible in a world of increasing in
terdependence. Unless Islam can in
corporate the outside world without be
coming subordinate to it, its sphere of in
fluence will eventually diminish.
Among The Believers combines
Naipaul's unique approach to fiction with
an insightful look at the Asian continent.
The modern reader cannot help but ap
preciate this unprecedented revelation of
the Islamic world today.

Among the Believers
By V.S. Naipaul
Alfred A. Knopf
$15.00, 430 pp.
In an excerpt from "Conrad's
Darkness," the last essay in The Return of
Eva Peron, V.S. Naipaul, describing Joseph
Conrad's "The Lagoon," comments on the
writer's nonresidence in his fiction. When
searching for the story behind the story
(and thus the writer behind the story), one
must look to sources that supplement fic
tion - sources in which the writer is
stripped of his protective anonymity, his
distance from the story.
Rarely is the rough, unpolished journal
istic legwork supporting the story made
available. This is due in part to the fiction
writers' inability to move from the indirect
circuity of prose to the forceful directness
of journalism.
Few authors (and more pertinent to the
publication of a work, publishers) are will
ing to risk marketing the man behind the
pen or the journalism behind the fiction.
V.S. Naipaul is a notable exception; The
Middle Passage, An Area of Darkness, In
dia: A Wounded Civilization, The Return
of Eva Peron and now Among the Be
lievers: An Islamic journey epitomize
Naipaul's uniqueness.
In The Middle Passage Naipaul con
fronts his fear of Trinidad, his home for 18
years and the setting of his early sardonic
fiction. An Area of Darkness and India: A
Wounded Civilization (especially the lat
ter) have allowed Naipaul to come to terms
with the South Asian subcontinent - his an
cestral homeland. In The Return of Eva
Peron Naipaul analyzesthedarkcomersof
Africa and South America and acknowl
edges the influence of Joseph Conrad, lit
erature's previous Third World voyager.
During his recent Islamic journey,
chronicled in Among the Believers,
Naipaul visited Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia and

Indonesia: four "half-made societies" re
lying on theocratic rule to consummate
the marriage of old values and new skills.
Pervading Naipaul's work of the past two
decades has been a perceptive foreboding
of the wide-spreading schisms of Third
World countries adapting their traditional
civilization to the dominant, "encircling
civilization" of the former colonialists.
Among the Believers portrays the Islam
ic response to the threat of absorption im
plicit in that "encircling civilization." Two
corollaries of Naipaul's general theory of
developmental dead end are the focal
points: (1) the hypocrisy of using yet abus
ing the West, and (2) the rage/calm
dichotomy of people complicated and
confused by layers of education, religion,
and politics.
The material is ripe for dry scholarly dis
section; but Naipaul's incisive knife cuts
through Islamic dogma and dialectic in a
personal manner. The reader looking for
ethnographic field work or political
analysis may be disappointed. Although
Naipaul does have an eye for ethnography
and political science, his Islamic journey is
just that: his Islamic journey. The journey
is as much an introspection as it is an ex
amination of neo-lslam. Naipaul's purpose
as a truth seeker is implied through his en
counters with Behzad, his Iranian guide,
and Shirazi, an Ayatollah at a religious
foundation in Qum.
Naipaul's honesty saturates Among the
Believers. He is not a researcher working in
a musty, static library; he is a traveler, a
journalist/novelist toiling through ex
plorations of Third World outposts. The
book is a response to the spoken words of
men servile to the Koran's writen word. If
the reader is to get an accurate picture of
these men's Islamic way of life, the writer
must be explicitly truthful. This is where
Naipaul is strongest: the truth — not
absolute truth, but rather Naipaul's truth
— is evident throughout his journey.

A secondary theme that Naipaul un
covers concerns the developing world's
hypocrital parasitism of the developed
world. The West, "emotionally rejected"
for its corrupt materialism, is shown the
welcome mat when seen as the salesman
of goods valued in the "great world
bazaar."
The contempt for parasitism is well
founded. But the parasitism and hypocrisy,
which throughout Naipaul's journey pi
qued his moralism, do not constitute the
essence of the work; they are but a small
part of a conscientious historian's grand vi
sion of The Third World.
