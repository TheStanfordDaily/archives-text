A Flag for Sunrise
By Robert Stone
Alfred A. Knopf
$13.95, 493 pp.
Robert Stone's latest novel,
A Flag for Sunrise, comes at a
time when the current admin
istration in Washington is
trying zealously to give new re
spectability to the kind of dis
credited foreign policy as
sumptions that led, among oth
er things, to Vietnam. Al
though it is not a political novel
in the strictest sense, A Flag for
Sunrise deals with United
States involvement in Latin
America. The parallel that its
principal character observes
between Vietnam and the two
fictional countries he visits
make it clear that there may be
another Vietnam, right on the
South American continent.
Furthermore, Stone makes a
good case for the view that the
cause of this situation lies in the
heart of America.
A professor of anthropology
named Holliwell, on the eve of
his sabbatical departure from
Connecticut, is approached by
a CIA spy to perform a minor
favor for the agency, "for old
times sake," as it were.
Holliwell, who had done some
work for the CIA in Vietnam,
refuses; but later on, reflecting
on the encounter, realizes that
he did so beceuse he is "really
without beliefs, without
hope."
Once he is down in Central
America, though, hedecidesto
see what he was asked to spy
on. It is not so much curiosity
or circumstances that take him

to the country where violence,
poverty and corruption, with
America's blessing, are so
deeply ingrained but his lack of
resolve and character.
"Holliwell's confidence rose
and fell irrationally. He became
drunker ... If at sunrise, he
thought, he had summoned
the presence of mind to go
straight to the airport he could
probably have bought some
one's seat from under them."

Stuck in a country where he
is not wanted because of his in
sulting behavior, he derides to
move on to the republic the
CIA had asked him to visit. Ul
timately, he assesses' the in
volvement of an American nun
with the local revolutionaries
and betrays her.
The trip to the republic,
whose president is like
Nicaragua's Somoza, brings
Holliwell "Vietnam flashes"
like "the smells, the sight of the
sentry box in its well of light

under the jacaranda, the
brown sawed-off soliders in
MP's helmets. The empty
stares, the demented traffic —
even the newly built bus sta
tion had about it something of
the curving hand-me-down art
deco of downtown Saigon.
There were beggars clustered
about its doors with little paper
cartons full of cigarettes or
chewing gum and fruit or
sometime only brown out
stretched open palms." All this,
in an American framework.
Nested in"mile upon mile of
banana plantations. . is a pe
nal colony, at its gate a Coca-
Cola sign with its center board
replaceable for the inclusion of
the name of the establishment
on whose behalf Coca-Cola
was prepared to extend its wel
coming logo. The sign read,
'Coca-Cola — Bienvenidos a la
Colonia Penal.'
Stone studied under Stan
ford Prof. Wallace Stegner in
the '60s and his first literary ex
posure was in a Stanford an
thology. Hall of Mirrors, his
first novel, which focused on
American right wing politics
and evalgelicalism, won a
Faulkner Award. Dog Soldiers,
which followed, dealt with the
effects of Vietnam on America,
and won a National Book
Award when that prize still car
ried prestige.
Though meagre, Stone'sout
put has been of high quality. A
Flag for Sunrise maintains his
status as a serious literary con
tender.

Holliwell, who had done some
work for the CIA in Vietnam,
refuses; but later on, reflecting
on the encounter, realizes that
he did so beceuse he is "really
without beliefs, without
hope."
Once he is down in Central
America, though, hedecidesto
see what he was asked to spy
on. It is not so much curiosity
or circumstances that take him

to the country where violence,
poverty and corruption, with
America's blessing, are so
deeply ingrained but his lack of
resolve and character.
"Holliwell's confidence rose
and fell irrationally. He became
drunker ... If at sunrise, he
thought, he had summoned
the presence of mind to go
straight to the airport he could
probably have bought some
one's seat from under them."

Stuck in a country where he
is not wanted because of his in
sulting behavior, he derides to
move on to the republic the
CIA had asked him to visit. Ul
timately, he assesses' the in
volvement of an American nun
with the local revolutionaries
and betrays her.
The trip to the republic,
whose president is like
Nicaragua's Somoza, brings
Holliwell "Vietnam flashes"
like "the smells, the sight of the
sentry box in its well of light

under the jacaranda, the
brown sawed-off soliders in
MP's helmets. The empty
stares, the demented traffic —
even the newly built bus sta
tion had about it something of
the curving hand-me-down art
deco of downtown Saigon.
There were beggars clustered
about its doors with little paper
cartons full of cigarettes or
chewing gum and fruit or
sometime only brown out
stretched open palms." All this,
in an American framework.
Nested in"mile upon mile of
banana plantations. . is a pe
nal colony, at its gate a Coca-
Cola sign with its center board
replaceable for the inclusion of
the name of the establishment
on whose behalf Coca-Cola
was prepared to extend its wel
coming logo. The sign read,
'Coca-Cola — Bienvenidos a la
Colonia Penal.'
Stone studied under Stan
ford Prof. Wallace Stegner in
the '60s and his first literary ex
posure was in a Stanford an
thology. Hall of Mirrors, his
first novel, which focused on
American right wing politics
and evalgelicalism, won a
Faulkner Award. Dog Soldiers,
which followed, dealt with the
effects of Vietnam on America,
and won a National Book
Award when that prize still car
ried prestige.
Though meagre, Stone'sout
put has been of high quality. A
Flag for Sunrise maintains his
status as a serious literary con
tender.
