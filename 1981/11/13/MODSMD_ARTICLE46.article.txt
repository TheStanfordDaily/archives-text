Dr. Strangelove ++++
Tonight, Cubberley
The greatest comedy ever
made about the end of the world
by nuclear holocaust (it's even
funnier than Panic in the Year
Zero, and that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Sterling
Hayden) and finished by high
government officials, most of
whom are played by Peter Sellers.
We watch mankind's hopes for
survival being sealed off, one by
one; director Stanley Kubrick
wipes out the human race with
manic glee. Dr. Strangelove is a
wonderfully sustained exercise in
misanthropy — the threat of nu
clear war is so frightening that the
only way to deal with it is with de
risive laughter.
Double-billed with Monty
Python's And Now for Something
Completely Different.

The Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie ****
Wednesday, Tresidder
Lount»e
Luis Bunuel directed this very
funny, very strange satire of up
per-class morality. The story
travels by way of dreams and
anecdotes — one character's
nightmare becomes another
character's life. Bunuel allows no
border to go untested: he directs
his satire at much as us as at the
inhabitants of his movie. They're
not certain how they fit into their
society, and we're never really
certain how we fit intothis movie.
Just when we've figured out what
isiftrue" and another not, Bunuel
turns the movie inside out and
we're forced to start all over
again. And because we're never
lulled into thinking we're watch
ing a mirror of reality, The Dis
creet Charm acquires an odd, af
fecting quality of integrity.
Double-billed with Un Chien
Andalou.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. Thecharac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

All That Jazz ★**
New Varsitv, Palo Alto
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled ex
amination of his own life and
near-death is the kind of self-in
dulgent mistake that seems
doomed to fail. But Fosse's too
damned talented for that result;
frustratingly, the movie fluc
tuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant. It's hard to think of
something more self-conscious
than a huge dance number about
your own open-heart surgery,
and the show-biz schmaltziness
that Fosse stuffs the sequence
with borders on self-parody.
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the
start with this movie — but he
took it to the limit anyway.
Roy Scheider stars. Tonight
only.

Young Frankenstein *★★★
Salurn.iv, Cuhberley
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
God. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars the the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal version, and the black
and-white photography con
tribute much toward the movie's
success.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made i n an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Heaven Can Wait ****
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Very wry — like a Thurber
story without the bite. Depen
dent for its success upon machin
ations that come totally out of the
blue — if the movie is to work it
must continually outwit its au
dience. And it does, for the most
part. Warren Beatty has more
than a little Walter Mitty in him —
he moves through the picture
with obstinlnt persistence and a
•stubborn sense that he's been
cheated. (Strange as it sounds,
he's good at this, and his efforts
are supported by those of a well
addled supporting cast.)
Heaven isn't so much a remake
as it is an effort to exhume a kind
of movie that I'd thought was
dead and gone. It doesn't just
stick old lines into new faces and
play off its inferiority to the ori
ginal — this is a thoughtful rein
troduction to a far more in
telligent kind of comedy than
that which is currently the norm.
Never again will I confuse
Warren Beatty with Clint East
wood.
— John Nielsen
Superman II **
Fox Redwood City
This sequel may disappoint
those who admired the myth-es
tablishing prologue of the ori
ginal; it will usually delight those
who found the original's smart
alecky second half more appeal
ing. Richard Lester (A Hard Day's
Night, The Three Musketeers)
directed, and he's lent the movie
a comic-book punch that moves
it along as speedily as a morning
spent with the funnies. Christ
opher Reeve repeats his role as
the man of steel; Margot Kidder
is, once again, a sassy, sexy Lois
Lane.
Double billed with The Day
the Earth Stood Still
on Sunday.

Un Chien Andalou ****
Wednesday, Tresidder Large
Lounge
Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali
co-directed this silent, surrealist
masterpiece. Bunuel maintains
that the movie has no meaning;
that the images are just images,
placing Un Chien Andalou closer
to music than to the novel. Some
of its scenes, such as the infamous
slitting of an eyeball with a razor,
still shock — they may recurr in
nightmares.
— J.M.
Mommie Dearest *
Old Mill, Mountain View
Mommie Dearest seems to
have been conceived in a time
warp: it isn't a picture about Joan
Crawford as much as a Joan
Crawford picture. It offers us a
fan magazine's view of Holly
wood life. Since Director Frank
Perry doesn't direct Joan's
notorious attacks on her daugh
ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in
dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem to have
consequences. Neither Faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobel,
betrays any tension between real
life and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepily like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.

Gdllipoli
Fine Arts, Palo AHo
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy s ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.
— S.V.
The Lavender Hill Mob
★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alec Guinness stars as a mild
mannered bank examiner who
comes up with a brilliant scheme
to steal from the Bank of
England: he'll recast it into hun
dreds of tiny souvenir replicas of
the Eiffel tower, which can then
easily be shipped out of country.
As you might guess, his plan is
only partially successful. Guin
ness is nothing short of brilliant
— never before (or since) have
the talents required to be a low
level bureaucrat seemed so close
ly allied to sheer criminal genius.
Double-billed with The Lady
killers, a comedy in which Guin
ness, wearing enormous buck
teeth (which somehow seem to
suit him), plays an archcriminal
who is undone by a sweet old
lady. Both play Thursday only.

True Confessions ***
Old Mill, Mountainview
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Crosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.
— S.V.
The Stunt Man ★***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It's the old theme of reality
versus illusion, but in an
astonishingly witty new setting.
The director, Richard Rush, re
verses every audience expecta
tion in this audacious, kinetic
comedy about making movies.
Peter O'Toole gives an im
aginative, self delighted per
formance as Eli Cross, a film
maker who revels in risks, and
Steve Railsback plays the stunt
man. The cast also includes Allen
Goorwitz (who used to be called
Allen Garfield) and Barbara
Hershey (who used to be called
Barbara Hershey Seagull).
Starts next Thursday with All
That lazz.
— S.V.
Arthur **★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza

Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.
— J.M.
Priest of Love **
Aquarius, Palo Alto
In striving to avoid the traps of
biographical movies, this film
about D.H. Lawrence and his
wife, Frieda Van Rlchthofen,
bungles the material in surprising
ways: it is a bewilderingly struc
tured set of flashbacks that inter
rupt an endless travelogu'e. The
Lawrences take in New Mexico,
old Mexico, France and Italy, but
we keep losing track of where
they are and who they're talking
to. Lan McKellen, ideally cast as
Lawrence, has some strong mo
ments, but it's just a sketch; Janet
Suzman, as Frieda, comes off
much better.
- S.V
The Day the Earth Stood Still
★ ★★ i,
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Even with the past decade's
renaissance of the science fiction
film, this tightly constructed mov
ie from the '50s holds its own as
one of the masterpieces of the
genre. A man from another
planet (Michael Rennie) brings a
chance for peace on earth, he *
met with only misunderstanding
and fear. The Day the Earth Stood
Still can be viewed as a condem
nation of McCarthyism or, equal
ly intriguingly, as a movie that
fulfills our desire to create a sci
entific religion. Whatever you
read into it, it remains consistent
ly entertaining. Julian Blaustein,
now a Stanford faculty member,
produced; Robett Wise directed.
Plays Sunday only with Super
man 11.
