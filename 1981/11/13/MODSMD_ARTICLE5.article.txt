# Faculty Senate talks about federal funds, new computer
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
The waning federal support for re
search and education continues to
have somber implications here, ac
cording to University President
Donald Kennedy's report to the Fac
ulty Senate yesterday.
Congress is currentlyconsideringa
bill designed to help small businesses
at the expense of research projects,
Kennedy sajd. The bill requires that 1
percent of all federal research
budgets over $100 million be set
aside into a special fund to promote
small business innovation, he said.
"We're attempting to remind
some congressmen that research and
small businesses aren't the same
thing. One must not be taxed over
the other without more careful con
sideration," he said.
Kennedy also said the "talk around
town" in Washington is of a growing
effort to remove the tax-exempt sta
tus of education and hospital bonds,
along with industrial development
bonds.
According to Bob Beyers, director
of University News and Publications,
the new cut is part of President
Ronald Reagan's attempt to reduce
the role of government and to make
it more pi of itable for Americans to
save. The loss of lax-exempt bonds
would hurt the University most in
possibly denying the Stanford Hospi

tal the extensive renovation it needs,
he said.
The senate was also brought up to
date on the new CONTEXT computer
project underway here. Reporting
for the Academic Council Commit
tee on Information Technology (C
-CIT), Business School Prof. James
Miller said the initial appeal of the
CONTEXT project had been to "ex
periment with having professors deal
directly with the computer, and not
through an intermediary like a secre
tary."
CONTEXT is a text-processing sys
tem that has been operating for three
months. It is available to all faculty,
but functions on a subscription basis.
By requiring users to pay for the ser
vice, the system is designed to be
self-supporting.
Senate members responded with
both praise and criticism for the sys
tem. English Prof. Herbert Linden
berger lauded the system as a whole,
but cited its limited availability, due
to a terminal shortage, and its inabili
ty to print foreign accents, as hin
drances to his efforts.
Edmundo Fuenzalida, associate
professor of education, said that in
his three months of use he has had
continual problems and is "worse
with CONTEXT than I was without it."
C-CIT has two major tasks before it
this year, Miller said. The first is con
tinued investigation of a University

wide networking of computers so
"computers and people can talk to
each other." Miller said that in the
technology community this network,
whereby computer users can com
municate with each other via com
puter, "is all the rage." He added that
it "seems like a real natural fora uni
versity."
The committee's other project will
be to review the mechanism by
which computer technology re
sources are allocated on campus.
Presenting the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries' report, Clas
sics Prof. Michael Jameson said that
after "basking in the glory of the new
east wing of Green Library" for the
past year, the committee isturning its
attention to the branch libraries.
Of immediate concern are the
temperature problem in the
mathematics library, security prob
lems resulting in book losses and the
delay in cataloguing.
David Weber, director of Univer
sity libraries, reported a backlog of
uncatalogued books numbering
roughly 80,000 volumes. He said the
backlog has gotten worse in the past
three months because of changes in
the computer system the libraries
use. "Even if we didn't acquire any
more (books) today, it would take us
at least 14 months to work off that ar
rearage," he said.

professor of education, said that in
his three months of use he has had
continual problems and is "worse
with CONTEXT than I was without it."
C-CIT has two major tasks before it
this year, Miller said. The first is con
tinued investigation of a University

wide networking of computers so
"computers and people can talk to
each other." Miller said that in the
technology community this network,
whereby computer users can com
municate with each other via com
puter, "is all the rage." He added that
it "seems like a real natural fora uni
versity."
The committee's other project will
be to review the mechanism by
which computer technology re
sources are allocated on campus.
Presenting the Academic Council
Committee on Libraries' report, Clas
sics Prof. Michael Jameson said that
after "basking in the glory of the new
east wing of Green Library" for the
past year, the committee isturning its
attention to the branch libraries.
Of immediate concern are the
temperature problem in the
mathematics library, security prob
lems resulting in book losses and the
delay in cataloguing.
David Weber, director of Univer
sity libraries, reported a backlog of
uncatalogued books numbering
roughly 80,000 volumes. He said the
backlog has gotten worse in the past
three months because of changes in
the computer system the libraries
use. "Even if we didn't acquire any
more (books) today, it would take us
at least 14 months to work off that ar
rearage," he said.
