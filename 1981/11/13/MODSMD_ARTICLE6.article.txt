# Housing hinders prof recruitment
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
As the height of the recruiting sea
son for new professors starts at the
Business School here, faculty mem
bers say it is becoming increasingly
difficult to attract quality instructors
at what most experts consider the
best business school in the United
States.
Several problems —• some q( them,
national trends and some of them
unique to the University — are
threatening the reputation of the
school.
An increasingly dire housing situ
ation, a general decline in the
number of prospective teachers and
a rise in the number of people want
ing to obtain MBAs are causing Uni
versity officials and recruiters at the
business school to work harder to at
tract top professors — and keep them
here.
"It's getting tougher to attract the
best instructors," said Prof, and
former acting Dean Robert Jaedicke.
"And as a result, we have to work
harder."
Recruiters are raising salaries and
increasing research opportunities for
junior faculty members, and Univer
sity housing officials are trying to pass
the Housing Allowance Program
(HAL), a housing payment subsidy
plan, as a part of this drive.
Two programs now in effect offer
on-campus housing and a special
mortgage co-investment program,
which offers loans to professors at 5
percent, in exchange fora portion of
the appreciation of the house. The
University Administrative Council
will decide Monday whether to in
clude HAL among its plans.
The housing situation is a dire

problem for every department of the
University because of astronomical
real estate prices in the area. Even the
lowest-priced University housing
starts at $160,000, and, with interest
rates at 16 percent, few professors
can afford the area.
Compounding this problem are a
continuing increase in student ap
plications :md a '.narked decrease ir
the number of potential professors.
More than 5000 students applied for
315 spots at the business school last
year, compared with 2000 applicants
in 1970. This growth occurred despite
the fact that there are now three
times as many schools offering MBA
programs as in 1970.
This means that there are fewer
potential professors and an increas
ingly selective and demanding stu
dent body.
The result has been an increase of
visiting and part-time professors and
a lot of concentrated effort to attract
top quality instructors.
Visiting professorscomprisean un
usually large portion of the faculty
this year; there are 15, compared to a
norm of 10. There are also 19 part
time professors, who generally teach
specialized courses. There are 84 full
professors here.
"There is a definite increase in the
number of professors who are not
full-time professors, and part of it is
the difficulty of recruiting top pro
fessors — there is no question of
that," said Charles Holloway, as
sociate dean for academic affairs.
This year Holloway is responsible
for recruiting next year's instructors.

He stresses that the problems,
though great, are riot insurmoun
table. There have been very favor
able responses to Holloway's offers
of increased benefits for new faculty
members, which include both ex
tensive opportunities for research
and increased salaries, he said.
New professors are offered salaries
ranging 4 rem j-40 v OGO. At -
cording to proiessors here, though
this is a significant raise from past
years, professors must make a major
financial sacrifice in coming here.
"It was a very hard decision for me
to come here," said Prof john Rob
erts, who came here two years ago
from Northwestern Business School.
Roberts' new house was $100,000
more expensive than the one he
owned in the Chicago area, and "of
lesser quality," he said.
Roberts said, however, that he
made the decision because he had
always wanted to live in the Bay Area,
and because he thought the quality
of teaching was, on the average,
higher here.
Roberts had been at Northwestern
for 13 years before he came to the
University.
Jaedicke, who has been here for 20
years, said he likes to look at people
such as Roberts as examples of the
University's success in recruiting.
"Recruiting is always difficult, and
it's getting tougher. But, if more ef
fort is put into it, the quality of the
University will never be significantly
impaired," he said.

sity housing officials are trying to pass
the Housing Allowance Program
(HAL), a housing payment subsidy
plan, as a part of this drive.
Two programs now in effect offer
on-campus housing and a special
mortgage co-investment program,
which offers loans to professors at 5
percent, in exchange fora portion of
the appreciation of the house. The
University Administrative Council
will decide Monday whether to in
clude HAL among its plans.
The housing situation is a dire

problem for every department of the
University because of astronomical
real estate prices in the area. Even the
lowest-priced University housing
starts at $160,000, and, with interest
rates at 16 percent, few professors
can afford the area.
Compounding this problem are a
continuing increase in student ap
plications :md a '.narked decrease ir
the number of potential professors.
More than 5000 students applied for
315 spots at the business school last
year, compared with 2000 applicants
in 1970. This growth occurred despite
the fact that there are now three
times as many schools offering MBA
programs as in 1970.
This means that there are fewer
potential professors and an increas
ingly selective and demanding stu
dent body.
The result has been an increase of
visiting and part-time professors and
a lot of concentrated effort to attract
top quality instructors.
Visiting professorscomprisean un
usually large portion of the faculty
this year; there are 15, compared to a
norm of 10. There are also 19 part
time professors, who generally teach
specialized courses. There are 84 full
professors here.
"There is a definite increase in the
number of professors who are not
full-time professors, and part of it is
the difficulty of recruiting top pro
fessors — there is no question of
that," said Charles Holloway, as
sociate dean for academic affairs.
This year Holloway is responsible
for recruiting next year's instructors.

He stresses that the problems,
though great, are riot insurmoun
table. There have been very favor
able responses to Holloway's offers
of increased benefits for new faculty
members, which include both ex
tensive opportunities for research
and increased salaries, he said.
New professors are offered salaries
ranging 4 rem j-40 v OGO. At -
cording to proiessors here, though
this is a significant raise from past
years, professors must make a major
financial sacrifice in coming here.
"It was a very hard decision for me
to come here," said Prof john Rob
erts, who came here two years ago
from Northwestern Business School.
Roberts' new house was $100,000
more expensive than the one he
owned in the Chicago area, and "of
lesser quality," he said.
Roberts said, however, that he
made the decision because he had
always wanted to live in the Bay Area,
and because he thought the quality
of teaching was, on the average,
higher here.
Roberts had been at Northwestern
for 13 years before he came to the
University.
Jaedicke, who has been here for 20
years, said he likes to look at people
such as Roberts as examples of the
University's success in recruiting.
"Recruiting is always difficult, and
it's getting tougher. But, if more ef
fort is put into it, the quality of the
University will never be significantly
impaired," he said.
As the height of the recruiting sea
son for new professors starts at the
Business School here, faculty mem
bers say it is becoming increasingly
difficult to attract quality instructors
at what most experts consider the
best business school in the United
States.
Several problems —• some q( them,
national trends and some of them
unique to the University — are
threatening the reputation of the
school.
An increasingly dire housing situ
ation, a general decline in the
number of prospective teachers and
a rise in the number of people want
ing to obtain MBAs are causing Uni
versity officials and recruiters at the
business school to work harder to at
tract top professors — and keep them
here.
"It's getting tougher to attract the
best instructors," said Prof, and
former acting Dean Robert Jaedicke.
"And as a result, we have to work
harder."
Recruiters are raising salaries and
increasing research opportunities for
junior faculty members, and Univer
sity housing officials are trying to pass
the Housing Allowance Program
(HAL), a housing payment subsidy
plan, as a part of this drive.
