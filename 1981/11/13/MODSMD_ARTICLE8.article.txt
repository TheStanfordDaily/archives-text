Paris (AP) — World War I flying aces
from both the Allied and German sides
reunited in Paris fora Veteran's Day
ceremony Wednesday under the Arc
de I riomphe.
Their eyes had dimmed, their stride
had slowed and their hair had thinned.
But their memories remained strong as
they recalled flying into battle in the
days when the life expectancy fora pilot
on the Western Front was as little as 21
days in 1917
I hey were given prominent places
under the arch to view the traditional
wreath-laying on the grave of the un
known soldier and fanning of the
eternal flame.
Only 40 of the world's surviving 85
aces were well enough to accept Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand's invitation to
attend celebrations marking the bird
anniversary of the armistice that ended
"the war to end all wars" on the 11th
hour oj the 11th day of the 11th month.
The Pan>> reunion will undoubtedly
be the last one of its size for the men
who earned the title "ace" by shooting
down at least five enemy planes in the

first air war.
"The most frightening experiences
came when the war was over and you
were back home and had time to think
about what happened up there,"
George Vaughn, of Staten Island, N.V.,
said during a recent interview at a Paris
hotel where the aces are staying.
At age 84, Vaughn is one of the
youngest survivors. With only 90 hours

of flight training, he downed 12 of the
Kaiser's aircraft and one balloon in
World War I — more than any other liv
ing American.
"Don't ask meabout the dreams. The
nightmares went on for years," recalled
86-year-old Raymond Brooks, of Sum
mit, New Jersey, who shot down six
German planes.

Vaughn and Brooks are among nine
American aces who made the trip to
Paris. Among the others are nine Cana
dians, seven Britons, six Frenchmen,
three Germans, three Hungarians and
one ace each from Italy, Austria and
Belgium.
They flew in the flamboyant, infant
days of the airplane in frail Camels and
Spads and Fokkers that averaged about

90 miles per hour and carried fuel for
two hours or less of flying time.
"The Spad was a flying brick," Brooks
recalled, touching his walking cane.
They flew without radios, instrument
panels, wheelbrakes or parachutes,
when planes had no armor a, id many pi
lots sat on the lids of cast-iron pans for
protection against the bullets that
pierced the underbelly of their craft.
