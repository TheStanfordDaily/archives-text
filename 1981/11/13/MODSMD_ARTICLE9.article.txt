# Poles celebrate anniversary of post-WWI reunification
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Official
celebrations were held in Po
land for the first time in more
than 40 years earlier this week
to mark the anniversary of the
country's regaining independ
ence after World War I.
Until now Poland's com
munist regime refused to com
memorate Nov. 11 as the tradi
tional independence day since
it was associated with the rule
of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the
hero of the 1920 war against the
Soviet Union. The change of
heart reflects changes that
have taken place here over the
past year and new attempts by
the authorities to build a na
tional consensus.
Diversion attempt?
The official celebrations also
appeared to be an attempt to
divert attention from the anti-
Soviet character of unofficial
marches in Warsaw and other
Polish cities.
Two years ago, % right-wing
nationalist groups organized a
huge torchlight procession
through the streets of Warsaw.
Several prominent dissidents
were arrested and the event
was seen as a-challenge to the
regime then headed by Edward
Gierek.
Last year, after the birth of

the independent Solidarity
trade union, smaller but still il
legal demonstrations were
held.
Ottici.il approval
Wednesday's celebrations
were given the official stampof
approval with formal wreath
laying ceremonies and reports
in the press. Red and white
Polish flags were hung from
public buildings throughout
the country.
Later big crowds marched
through Warsaw from the old
royal castle to the tomb of the
unknown soldier who was
himself killed fighting the Rus
sians.
Leaflets handed to the crowd
recalled the history of Poland's
three-fold partition between
Russia, Prussia and Austria dur
ing the late 18th and 19th cen
turies and its re-establishment
as an independent nation in
November 1918.
Exhibition
The celebrations also
marked a partial rehabilitation
of Marshal Pilsudski, whose
name has long been anathema
to Communist officials. An ex
hibition devoted to his career
has opened in the southern
town of Crakow and a shipyard
in Gdansk has also been named
after him.

The sudden rediscovery of
pre-war national holidays has
helped create a bewildering
plethora of anniversaries here.
They range from Communist
events like the Bolshevik Revo
lution in Soviet Russia to Chris
tian festivals like Easter and the
anniversaries of post-war
workers' upheavals in 1956,
1970, 1976 and 1980.
More talks
Meanwhile, Solidarity union
leader Lech Walesa said he
hopes to meet again soon with
Prime Minister Wojciech
Jaruzelski and Roman Catholic
Archbishop Jozef Glemp. He
told workers in Crakow that he
expects relations with the
Communist authorities to im
prove following last week's
summit which he described as
only "an initial contact" be
tween the two sides.
Despite an appeal for an end
to strikes from parliament, scat
tered unrest still continues in
several parts of the country.
East of Warsaw, at Siedlce,
farmers have been occupying
the offices of the socialist youth
organization to demand a new
law guaranteeing permanent
land ownership.
The protest has now re
ceived the formal backing of
the rural branch of Solidarity.
