# Rape here 'unusual' but on upswing

The recent rash of sexual assaults
committed on campus is highly un
usual, according to police statistics.
The last time that three rapes were
reported on campus in one year was
in1971 .Only one rape was reported in
I980, and from1976-1979 there were
two lape reports per year.
"Over the past seven or eight
years, we've averaged roughly two
rapes and two to four attempted
rapes per year," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington.
Herrington attributed the recent
increase to the concentrated activity
of one rapist.
"The reason for it (the increase) is
that we have one individual working,
and he keeps coming back," he said.
"If he concentrates on one area, one
person can cause a crime wave all by
himself."
Herrington said the police think
the same rapist might be involved in
more than one of the recent assaults
because the "descriptions (of the
rapist) are fairly close."
However, Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer said that the de
scriptions "aren't very unique" and
"could fit half of the young black
male population."
According to Herrington, the po
lice are "about 90 percent sure" that
there were two men involved in last
Tuesday's rape, in which a Stanford
student was attacked near Memorial
Church between 6:30 and 7 p.m.
Herrington said the police believe
that one of those rapists might have
been the assailant in the Nov. 5 rape
near Stanford Stadium.
Herrington said there are no
statistics available which deal specifi
cally with attempted rape. The police
keep records of aggravated assaults,
which include both muggings and
sexual assaults.
There were four aggravated as
saults reported on campus in I980,
tive in I979, two in I978, and one in
I977. Herrington estimated that
"roughly half" of the aggravated as
saults recorded are attempted rapes.
Herrington emphasized that these
figures reflect only reported sexual
assaults.
"It's hard to get a feeling for how
many others go unreported," he
said. He added that he felt Stanford
women are "liberated and en
lightened" and therefore more will
ing to report rapes than many wom
en in the outside community. Her
rington estimated that 10 percent of
attempted rapes are generally re
ported, but said he thought that the
police are informed of 50 to 75 per
cent of the assaults at the University.
