# Refugees glut area near bleak Uganda

### Washington Post 
Kinshasa, Zaire — Al
though Uganda's former lead
er Idi Amin has been in exile
for more than two years, the af
ter-effects of his rise and fall
have left areas of three nations
— Uganda, Zaire and Sudan —
in turmoil.
Thousands of soldiers of
Amin's defeated army now
roam the vast, trackless forests
where these three countries
converge. Reportedly still well
armed, the guerrillas ambush
security forces and terrorize
the local population as well as
the hundreds of thousands of
refugees who fled Uganda dur
ing and after Amin's repressive
rule.
Religious, tribal and political
enmities among the refugees,
as well as food shortages and
disease, only make matters
worse.
The governments of Sudan
and Zaire watch with growing
apprehension as the refugees
continue to flood into their
countries. They fear for their
already severely strapped
economies and social and po
litical stability.
Between April 1979, when
Amin was ousted, until the end
of September 1981, 140,000
Ugandan refugees arrived in
the region around the Zairian
border town of Aru, according
to officials with the Office of
the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees.
A total of 632,800 refugees,
by official counts, are in Zaire,
including refugees from past
upheavals in the neighboring
countries of Rwanda, Burundi
and Angola.
Over 250,000 more Ugan
dans have fled to the southern
Sudan, a country that is already
inundated in the north with
about as many refugees from
the Eritrean region of Ethiopia.
Amin's army and his Libyan
allies were defeated by Tanza

nian soldiers leading a column
of Ugandan exiles called the
National l iberation Army.
The majority of the Ugandan
refugees fled the anarchy of
West Nile Province, home of
Amin himself. The Liberation
army allied with other un
paid soldiers is the force that
has exacted a bloody ven
geance on the people of that
province. Wide areas of the
West Nile are reported to have
been virtually depopulated
during the past two-and-a-half
years. Arua, just inside Uganda,
has been completely de
stroyed, they said.
The Zairian troops patrolling
the border seem to be unable
to stop continuing border at
tacks. When Ugandan National
Liberation Army forces clashed
with guerrillas in October 1980
near the Zairian town of Isro,
the garrison commander
gathered his troops and fled
west.
The delicate situation is not
expected to improve as long as
refugees remain massed in the
border area. They prefer tostay
close to the border in order to
slip across to their Ugandan
farms at night and collect pro
duce.
But since Ugandan President
Milton Obote visited his
Zairian counterpart, Mobutu
Sese Seko, in Kinshasa in April
to discuss the mounting in
stability on their border, the
Zairian gendarmes have been
driving the refugees toward
four interior refugee camps es
tablished by the U.N. refugee
commission earlier this year.
Within the camps, refugees
identified with Amin's terror
filled rule have fought with
anti-Amin refugees.
Since the most recent dis
turbances beginning in June,
severe malnutrition has be
come a general phenomenon
among the newly arriving refu
gees, one foreign doctor re
ported.
