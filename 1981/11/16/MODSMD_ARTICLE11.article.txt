### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — A Soviet court
in Kharkov has sentenced
Alexander Paritsky, a lead
ing Ukranian Jewish activist,
to three years in a labor
camp for allegedly slander
ing the Soviet Union,
friends of Paritsky said Sat
urday.
The 43-year-old elec
tronics engineer was ar
rested Aug. 28, apparently
as part of a continuing
crackdown by the Soviet se
cret police on virtually all
organized activities by Sovi
et Jews.
Paritsky, who was barred
from his profession and
stripped of his academic
degree after applying to
emigrate to Israel with his
wife and two daughters in
1977, was widely known for
organizing an informal
"university" in Kharkov for
the children of Jewish dissi
dents prevented from atten
ding state universities after
their parents applied for
permission to emigrate.
In a trial that began
Wednesday and ended Fri

day, they said, Paritsky de
fended himself after an at
torney refused to take the
case.
As evidence of slander,
the prosecutor accused
Paritsky of denying — in a
telephone call to his brother
in Israel — charges in a local
newspaper that Paritsky was
a "Zionist agent" and a
black market speculator,
the sources said.
The prosecutor was also
said to have cited as evi
dence of slander a composi
tion Paritsky's 15-year-old
daughter wrote two years
ago in which she said she
had "two motherlands: Is
rael and the Soviet Union."
Paritsky was further ac
cused of supplying informa
tion to "Western radio sta
tions" and of making slan
derous statements in two
separate letters to the Ukra
nian Central Committee of
the Communist Party and to
his brother in Israel in 1978.
His wife, Polina, was al
lowed to appear as Paritsky's
witness at the trial.
