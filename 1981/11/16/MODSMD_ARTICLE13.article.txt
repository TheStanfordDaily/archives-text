## TRASHED. . . Who cleans up that post-game mess? 
### Diane johnson 
Ever thrown down an empty
'•in during the middle of a
Stanford football game? Ever
wondered who picks it up?
If the football fan "free
tosser" was to hang around un
til the following morning
the mysterious sanitation crew
would be revealed.
This "crew" couldn't be
more appropriately termed —

the post-game stadium atten
dants are all members of the
men's and women's crew
teams. Each team alternates be
tween the six home football
games and share the Big Game.
The 30-50 member
squadrons labor for approx
imately 300 hours (500 for Big
Game), loading trash into
almost 900 trash bags and then

into giant dumpsters. These 10-
by 30- by 6-foot bins are then
left for collection.
Why would anyone agree to
work a 7-12 garbage shift on an
early Sunday morning? Be
cause $1600 are at stake! This
money is applied toward trans
portation for meets, equip
ment and coaches' salaries.
Ann Cuthbertson, captain of

tne women s crew, com
mented on her "part-time
job." "I have two feelings.
We're all pretty grateful to be
able to cio it. Since women's
crew is by far the most ex
tensive club sport, fundraising
is always difficult. But it's a dis
gusting job when you get right
down to it, It raises the defini
tion of dedication to your sport
to a new level!"

'It makes you unwilling to go to the
game the day before because you can't
stand to see all the people dumping
trash. I haven't been to a game in two
years!'
— Karl Frykman
7 never thought there could be that
much garbage at a football stadium!'
