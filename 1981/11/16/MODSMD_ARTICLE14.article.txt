## Editorial Support rape deterrents 
### 
Yes, there are rapes on campus. As damning as
the statement is, the University community can
react in one of two ways: either let its members
live in fear, unwilling to trust anyone, or give
support and the knowledge that no one is alone
and that rape will not be tolerated in any degree.
That support has been given through
spontaneous dorm escort services and
discussions occurring throughout campus, but
now the entire campus community has a chance
to gather together to show we care that people
feel unsafe walking across campus. We hope
you show your concern by attending the Speak
out concerning rape" rally at White Plaza today
at noon.
Attend the rally, show that you care,
demonstrate that rape is a crucial issue
intolerable in any just community, but
remember that attending the rally is only an
initial effort in dealing with rape.
The rally itself will not prevent any woman
from being raped, but the awareness generated
may be a preliminary effort. Let the impulse of
rage and frustration expressed through the rally
motivate self-defense courses, running in pairs
rather than alone, petitioning the
administration for more resources devoted to
improving security or any other measures that
reduce the chance ortolerance of rape.
We hope that those people organizing the
rally see this effort as a means for the community
to rally together at a time of crisis and as an
opportunity to express mutual support. While it
may be tempting to use the rally — and the issue
of rape — as a forum for expressing divisive

ideological and political views, that expression
should not be the principal focus of a rally
designed to command the support of the entire
community.
It would also be too easy for the rally, and the
general discussion of rape, to center about
social problems solved only in a Utopia far in
years and distance from Stanford today.
However, individuals are attacked and made
fearful, and it is individuals rather than societies
who choose to rape and must be apprehended.
Social attitudes must of course change, which is
onefunction the rally may serve, but the
problem at hand and the people immediately
affected should be of paramount concern.
When there are rapes on campus, community
members must respond largely by relying upon
each other rather than upon different
institutional efforts. President Donald Kennedy
has said that whatever actions the University or
police take, "students helping one another will
probably be more important." While we
depend upon the police to capture rapists and
the University to improve campus security,
attending the rally is part — and only part — of
that crucial mutual support.
Stanford is a very special place, but we cannot
let our occasional image of the campus as an
idyllic oasis keep us from confronting the very
real and dangerous threat every woman faces
when she is alone outdoors. Recognition that
rape is a present danger and an intolerable
situation is a first step to eliminating that danger,
and your presence at today's noon rally at White
Plaza will show you do give a damn.
