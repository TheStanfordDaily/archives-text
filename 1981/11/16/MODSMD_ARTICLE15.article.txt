## Attend Daily open meeting 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon from 4 on until 6, the
Daily will hostan open forum for our readers
both to meet some of us who are responsible for
producing the Daily and to express their views
on the newspaper.
The obligation to serve this campus and the
local community is one which we take seriously,
and thus I am extending to all an earnest
invitation to attend the meeting, and to come
with comments — specific and general — about
the Daily. The meeting will be in Room 282 of
Tresidder Union.
Most of us who work on the Da/Vy would
probably admit, if pressed, that it would be a sad
day that the Daily failed to receive criticism from
some segment of the University community, for
that would most likely indicate that we were not
doing our jobs with the necessary vigor.
Any place with as broad a spectrum of people
and ideas as the this school necessarily will
generate a great amount of debate and even
disagreement, and the Daily ideally should
reflect this fact. We need feedback — both
positive and negative — to do our jobs.
Having said this, however, it is important to
point out that many of the complaints we
receive are ones which we do do our best not to
have repeated, a n d we have an obligation to
listen to people within this community who
believe, even within theframework mentioned
above, that we are not doing our jobs the way
we should.
The Daily makes mistakes — we are painfully
aware of many of them anyway. Some can be
explained — although not justified — by the
inherent limitations on most newspapers,
especially those of the college variety. The ideal
Daily, which continually would provide the

community with an insightful reflection of the
day-to-day life of Stanford University and the
world beyond, would require resources in the
form of time, people and experience which are
not consistently available to us.
The Daily also maintains an obligation to serve
as an educational laboratory for beginning
journalists, which as well places certain
limitations on the quality of our product.
Still, there are always ways in which we can
improve, and it is my hope that many of you will
come tomorrow with your suggestions for us.
The meeting will be a time for people to tell us
what we are doing right, and what we are doing
wrong — and, most of all, for telling us what we
could be doing better.
A secondary purpose of the meeting will be a
discussion and explanation of how the Daily
handles publicity from campus groups, and
makes decisions about which stories and
photographs we run in the paper. Many people
have been interested in learning about our
policies in order to receive coverage of their
own organization or cause. By explaining our
policies in the context of this meeting, I hope we
will make things easier on all of us.
Again, I strongly encourage any of you who
have something to say about the Daily to attend
the meeting. I don't mean to suggest that this
meeting will mark the only time we have tried to
listen to voices within thiscommunity, but I do
believe it is a good idea to provide you with a
clearand formal means of so doing. Even with
the criticism which we expect and often
deserve, I look forward to meeting with you and
thank you in advance for your participation.
