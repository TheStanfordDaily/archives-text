## Khadafy reflects Libyan views,desires 
### 
In recent months it has become
clear that the Reagan administration
has singled out Libya's leader, Col.
Moammar Khadafy, as the archvillain
in its media fictionalization of cur
rent Mideast politics. Because the
absurd characterization that Khadafy
is "the most dangerous man on
earth" seems undisputed by the
American media, and even is echoed
by jingoistic writers like Glen and
Shearer (Daily, Nov. 9), I feel it is nec
essary to set the record straight.
To begin with, most Americans
know nothing of Libya's painful 20th
century history, which provides the
background for the popularity of
Khadafy's anti-imperialist Islamic
fundamentalism in Libya. The Libyan
people probably suffered as much at
the hands of Western imperialism as
any people in the 20th century. In
1911 Italy attacked the Ottoman Em
pire, which nominally ruled Libya,
solely to further its imperial ambi
tions in the Mediterranean. While
the other Western powers watched,
the Italians invaded Libya and at
tempted to conquer its independent
population of peasants and nomads.
The Italians did not try to conquer
Libya again until the 19205. Benito
Mussolini envisioned the creation in
Libya of an agricultural colony for
much of Italy's surplus population si
multaneously assuring Italy s
strategic control of the central Medi
terranean. But to achieve this goal,
the native population had to be sub
dued, ,
The result was a bitter war waged

by a huge army of occupation, made
up in large part by Italian colonial
troops from Eritrea, against a few
thousand Libyan guerrillas in the
mountains of Cyrenaica. One of the
few accounts of the war written by an
outsider is to be found in Knud
Holmboe's Desert Encounter, which
depicts all the horrors of a Third
World liberation struggle to which
we have become callous today: the
bombing of villages, mass execu
tions, concentration camps and even
poison gas. By 1932 the Libyan re
sistance was crushed and thousands
of Italian peasants were transported
to the now-vacant land.
These peasants were never to see
the fruits of their labor, however, as
Libya became the battleground of
the armies of Europe in 1940. The Axis
and Allied armies fought back and
forth across Libya three times, and by
1943 little of what the Italians had
built remained standing. A British
military government administered
the country while the victors in the
war wrangled over the future of the
former colony. Meanwhile, the Unit
ed States had built its largest Mideast
air base near Tripoli and the British es
tablished a large naval base at Tobruk
in anticipation of their loss of control
over Egypt.
Anglo-American imperialism saw
in Libya an alternative strategic base
to increasingly nationalistic Egypt,
and supported Libya's bid for inde
pendence in the U.N. knowing that
pro-British Idriss al-Senoussi would
become Libya's king. Libya thus be

came the first European colony in
Africa to attain its independence. Al-
Senoussi, the head of the Senoussi re
ligious sect which had led Libyan re
sistance to the Italians, remained a
valuable Western ally throughout the
Nasser years.
The discovery of vast oil reserves
during the 1950s in Libya's empty
Sirtica desert further tied Libya to the
West, but also created the wealth and
consequent class divisions which led
to the monarchy's overthrow by radi
cal army officers in 1969. Much of this
oil wealth had been siphoned off by
the corrupt royal family, which grew
increasingly unpopular in propor
tion to its wealth, particularly after
the death of al-Senoussi.
Khadafy's revolution was thus very
popular in Libya, and it has led to the
redistribution of Libya's oil wealth to
all levels of the population, while his
anti-imperialism and religious
puritanism only reflect the popular
sentiments produced by Libya's
brutal conquest and the asceticism of
Senoussi Islam.
There is, of course, a Europeanized
bourgeoisie in the cities which re
sents Khadafy's redistribution of the
national wealth, but the majority of
Libyans are peasants or nomads, fol
lowers of the Senoussi teachings
(which are based on a philosophy of
love which draws much from the
teachings of Jesus), who have a well
developed sense of justice. And in a
part of the world rent by the hypocri
sy of competing imperialist powers, it
is perhaps this sense of justice that

makes Libya so "dangerous" to the
Reagan administration.

Article infuriating
I have never been so infuriated
with an article, a paper, and a journal
ist as I am with the article "Accident
victims attempted alcohol purchase
at Encina" (Daily, Nov. 10). The de
tails of the tragic accident have been
reported in the news since the day af
ter it happened so there was no need
to restate them. The article was
pointless and showed very little class,
and certainly was not a well written
piece of journalism.
What was the point of the article?
To find out Encina Station'spolicies
for checking ID, or to try and stain
the memory of two of the greatest
people I have ever known? If it is al
cohol abuse you wish to control on
campus then perhaps you should
take some positive steps toward that
goal, and not use the accident victims
as an "eye-catcher" just to try to get a
"good story."
What gives you the right to attack
the actions of two people who are no
longer around to defend them
selves? If it is Kevin and Michael that
you wish to write about, then per
haps you should talk to some of the
people who really knew them.
