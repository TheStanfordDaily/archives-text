## Liberals should adopt right tactics 
### 
I like Jerry Falwell; or rather, I like
the way he runs a political organiza
tion (which is what the Moral Majori
ty should rightly be called). Falwell
passionately plays political hardball:
he collects hordes of dollars, sends
thousands of mailers to people all
over America and articulates his
opinions in plain and forceful
speech.
Falwell and the New Right as a
whole waged a blitzkrieg that as
tounded many bv toppling liberal
monoliths like Senators Birch Bayh
and Frank Church. These defeats, less
a move to the right by the body poli
tic than a move to power by a conser
vative minority, prove the effective
ness of Falwell's methods when ap
plied with large amounts of money.
Still, instead of learning from the
likes of Falwell and Richard Viguerie,
the far-right "form letter king," we
"liberals" bemoan their rise to power
as if they emasculated us with their
success. We seem unable to differen
tiate the New Right's noxious policies
and its brilliant political organization.
American liberals have strayed far
afield over the last 20 years. While the
New Right assembled a powerful po
litical structure the Old Left made at
tempts at social engineering and
learned to squander money in the
wrong places. By 1980 anyone as
sociated strongly with liberal causes
in general and the Democratic party
in particular was labeled free
spending and frivolous. The labels,
though largely unfair, pointed to a
real problem.
By 1980, the Democratic Party had
become a money-loaded suggestion
box for liberal special interest
groups. In the eyes of liberal groups,
their pet issues are all-important and
demand center stage. While each
group, be it feminist, black, Jewish or
Chicano, tried to lobby only particu
lar issues, the Democratic Party
kowtowed to each, a donkey that
came to please. That kowtowing
would be fine, but as the Democrats
stared starry-eyed at special interest
groups, those groups, like the
feminists in the Phi Delt saga, wan

dered farther and farther from the
mainstream of American sentiment.
The Left's political methods, vestigial
from the 60s, diluted Democratic
unity and, with high-pitched vitriol,
divided the progressive vote from
the moderate.
So the party found itself derailed in
1980; those same groups who used to
have an inside track to Washington
saw Jesse Helms, Orrin Hatch and
Jeremiah Denton come to dominate
Capitol Hill. The conservative front
had played the game right, hitting
hard at social issues while blasting
Democratic fiscal ineptitude.

By 1980 the Democratic Party had become

Because of the conservative rise,
the time has come, to borrow a Marx
ist phrase, for a new liberal man
ifesto. Reagan now plans to cut $40
billion more from entitlement pro
grams while projecting budget defi
cits that would make a Great Society
bureaucrat burst out in song. With
the deficit, Reagan shows his true
stripes; he is as wasteful as Carter but
squanders his money in different
places.
That is the key to new liberal ideol
ogy, because nobody benefits from
waste, deficits and ponderous agen
cies. The purpose of "liberalism" is
the promotion of equality of op
portunity; to maintain a place as the
main progressive voice, the Demo
cratic Party must shake their wasteful
image. They must also learn to kill
previously sacred programs if they do
not do their job.
A truly progressivethinker, wheth
er Democrat, Republican or inde

pendent abhors waste in social pro
grams for it robs from the program's
patients. The hodge-podge of liberal
special interest groups, ethnic or
ganizations and unions that tradi
tionally compose Democratic sup
port should heed the new philoso
phy by shedding their blinders and
practicing some united pragmatism.
This all might sound rather dis
tasteful, but for too long American
liberals have distracted themselves
with a steady stream of studies and
inane proposals for sweeping social
change; meanwhile, the Right blew
by us and into positions of power.

That in itself is wrong. One might
question the taking up of Falwell's
tactics as immoral, and it would be
wrong to smear opposition as Falwell
does, but politics calls for balance. As
long as the Right marches on un
checked, they are able to distort a po
litical system based on dialogue and
compromise.
To effect change, the liberal must
possess some power. To make those
changes real, we must learn to man
age money and restrain bureaucracy.
To regain power, we must learn to
play like Jerry Falwell, with strong
fundraising and unified, grassroots
support. Perhaps then, with big mon
ey conservatism thwarted, more bal
anced and intelligent decisions will
come from Washington than come
from there now.

New Right assembled a powerful po
litical structure the Old Left made at
tempts at social engineering and
learned to squander money in the
wrong places. By 1980 anyone as
sociated strongly with liberal causes
in general and the Democratic party
in particular was labeled free
spending and frivolous. The labels,
though largely unfair, pointed to a
real problem.
By 1980, the Democratic Party had
become a money-loaded suggestion
box for liberal special interest
groups. In the eyes of liberal groups,
their pet issues are all-important and
demand center stage. While each
group, be it feminist, black, Jewish or
Chicano, tried to lobby only particu
lar issues, the Democratic Party
kowtowed to each, a donkey that
came to please. That kowtowing
would be fine, but as the Democrats
stared starry-eyed at special interest
groups, those groups, like the
feminists in the Phi Delt saga, wan

dered farther and farther from the
mainstream of American sentiment.
The Left's political methods, vestigial
from the 60s, diluted Democratic
unity and, with high-pitched vitriol,
divided the progressive vote from
the moderate.
So the party found itself derailed in
1980; those same groups who used to
have an inside track to Washington
saw Jesse Helms, Orrin Hatch and
Jeremiah Denton come to dominate
Capitol Hill. The conservative front
had played the game right, hitting
hard at social issues while blasting
Democratic fiscal ineptitude.

Because of the conservative rise,
the time has come, to borrow a Marx
ist phrase, for a new liberal man
ifesto. Reagan now plans to cut $40
billion more from entitlement pro
grams while projecting budget defi
cits that would make a Great Society
bureaucrat burst out in song. With
the deficit, Reagan shows his true
stripes; he is as wasteful as Carter but
squanders his money in different
places.
That is the key to new liberal ideol
ogy, because nobody benefits from
waste, deficits and ponderous agen
cies. The purpose of "liberalism" is
the promotion of equality of op
portunity; to maintain a place as the
main progressive voice, the Demo
cratic Party must shake their wasteful
image. They must also learn to kill
previously sacred programs if they do
not do their job.
A truly progressivethinker, wheth
er Democrat, Republican or inde

pendent abhors waste in social pro
grams for it robs from the program's
patients. The hodge-podge of liberal
special interest groups, ethnic or
ganizations and unions that tradi
tionally compose Democratic sup
port should heed the new philoso
phy by shedding their blinders and
practicing some united pragmatism.
This all might sound rather dis
tasteful, but for too long American
liberals have distracted themselves
with a steady stream of studies and
inane proposals for sweeping social
change; meanwhile, the Right blew
by us and into positions of power.

That in itself is wrong. One might
question the taking up of Falwell's
tactics as immoral, and it would be
wrong to smear opposition as Falwell
does, but politics calls for balance. As
long as the Right marches on un
checked, they are able to distort a po
litical system based on dialogue and
compromise.
To effect change, the liberal must
possess some power. To make those
changes real, we must learn to man
age money and restrain bureaucracy.
To regain power, we must learn to
play like Jerry Falwell, with strong
fundraising and unified, grassroots
support. Perhaps then, with big mon
ey conservatism thwarted, more bal
anced and intelligent decisions will
come from Washington than come
from there now.

I like Jerry Falwell; or rather, I like
the way he runs a political organiza
tion (which is what the Moral Majori
ty should rightly be called). Falwell
passionately plays political hardball:
he collects hordes of dollars, sends
thousands of mailers to people all
over America and articulates his
opinions in plain and forceful
speech.
Falwell and the New Right as a
whole waged a blitzkrieg that as
tounded many bv toppling liberal
monoliths like Senators Birch Bayh
and Frank Church. These defeats, less
a move to the right by the body poli
tic than a move to power by a conser
vative minority, prove the effective
ness of Falwell's methods when ap
plied with large amounts of money.
Still, instead of learning from the
likes of Falwell and Richard Viguerie,
the far-right "form letter king," we
"liberals" bemoan their rise to power
as if they emasculated us with their
success. We seem unable to differen
tiate the New Right's noxious policies
and its brilliant political organization.
