## Tracey Minkin Creativity: a double-edged sword 
### 
I stand in the center of the Quad,
and I feel attacked. Teeming masses
of numbers and figures, means and
grade point averages ooze from un
derneath the Stanford red tile roofs,
plundering my sense of individuality.
Daily assaulted by the predictability
and blandness of this technocratic
world, I am becoming increasingly
aware that there is one defense —
one way to preserve my humanity —
and that is through insisting on flex
ing my imagination, using my innate
creativity.
I am a writer. My creative mind is
my tool, as the lathe is to the
carpenter and the anvil to the black
smith. My gift is to show the world,
that big round world, to itself
through my art, my language, and in
doing so hope that my vision can in
spire others to strike out on their
own, get their act together, and start
flexing those creative muscles. So do
as I say, and as I do — and do read on!
Let us first examine the nature of
the creative mind. A creative mind
may hide like a wolf in sheep's
clothing, so don't be fooled. If you
don't judge a book by its cover, then
you won't be surprised to see that the
engineering graduate student next
door writes violin concerti. Likewise,
you won't be alarmed when you dis
cover that most four-year-olds are
more artistic than 90 percent of
adults. But good things do come in
small packages, so that should be

easy to take (with a grain of salt). The
point here, if you haven't read the
hand writing on the wall, is that the
first step toward creativity is to look
for and grant kudos to it in others.
Keep in mind, however, that not
every mind is a creative one, and ef
forts to make a silk purse out of a
sow's ear may go over like a lead
balloon. Not only are the minds hard
to change, but should just plain be
avoided. An idle mind is the devil's
playground, and still water runs
deep. Nature abhors a vacuum, and
you should too.
But let your conscience be your
guide.
Sometimes creative minds en
counter opposition by unyielding
dogmatic brains. Well, that's a horse
of a different color. If the philistenes
try and rain on your parade, any
method to overcome is allowed, but
it is best to look before you leap. Play
along. Walk softly, but carry a big
stick. Work quietly against the force
from the inside. It's worthless to bite
the hand that feeds you or cut off
your nose to spite your face, for it's
not always the squeaky wheel that
gets the grease. You can lead that
stubborn horse to water, but you
can't make him drink right off the
bat.
So be patient. A watched pot never
boils, and progress may be slow as
molasses, but your time will come,
and you better be ready. Time flies;

opportunity only knocks once, and if
you haven't put all your eggs in one
basket, then theoretically, when the
cat's away, the mice will play, and vic
tory will be yours. If this sounds a bit
revolutionary to you and you can't
stand the heat, well then by all means
get out of the kitchen.
Am I making myself perfectly
clear?
Remember, the opera isn't over
until the fat lady sings. I see my
creative mind growing like a weed
but I never get off the treadmill. We
must all constantly strive to improve,
so mental discipline is important. I
never put off 'till tomorrow what I
can do today, for a stitch in time saves
nine. A rolling stone gathers no moss,
so my mind is early to bed, early to
rise, and rolling in between! Let's
face it, it's too easy to become ac
customed to one's gift, so don't ever
look that gift-horse in the mouth!
A creative mind is a prized
possession. It should be handled with
kid gloves, lest it grow dry as a bone.
You don't need to read between the
lines to know that creativity brought
you these lines, that without creativi
ty civilization would fall flat as a pan
cake, and make no bones about that!
Oh, and beware of Greeks bearing
gifts.

cover that most four-year-olds are
more artistic than 90 percent of

small packages, so that should be

you should too.

it is best to look before you leap. Play
along. Walk softly, but carry a big
stick. Work quietly against the force
from the inside. It's worthless to bite

stand the heat, well then by all means
get out of the kitchen.

I stand in the center of the Quad,
and I feel attacked. Teeming masses
of numbers and figures, means and
grade point averages ooze from un
derneath the Stanford red tile roofs,
plundering my sense of individuality.
Daily assaulted by the predictability
and blandness of this technocratic
world, I am becoming increasingly
aware that there is one defense —
one way to preserve my humanity —
and that is through insisting on flex
ing my imagination, using my innate
creativity.
I am a writer. My creative mind is
my tool, as the lathe is to the
carpenter and the anvil to the black
smith. My gift is to show the world,
that big round world, to itself
through my art, my language, and in
doing so hope that my vision can in
spire others to strike out on their
own, get their act together, and start
flexing those creative muscles. So do
as I say, and as I do — and do read on!
Let us first examine the nature of
the creative mind. A creative mind
may hide like a wolf in sheep's
clothing, so don't be fooled. If you
don't judge a book by its cover, then
you won't be surprised to see that the
engineering graduate student next
door writes violin concerti. Likewise,
you won't be alarmed when you dis
cover that most four-year-olds are
more artistic than 90 percent of
adults. But good things do come in
small packages, so that should be

easy to take (with a grain of salt). The
point here, if you haven't read the
hand writing on the wall, is that the
first step toward creativity is to look

Keep in mind, however, that not
every mind is a creative one, and ef
