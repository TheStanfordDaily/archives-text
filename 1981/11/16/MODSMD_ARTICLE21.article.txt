## Marijuana debate simplistic 
### 
Washington — Comedians John
Belushi and Bill Murray should have
been there. A recent Senate hearing
on the effects of marijuana on youth
was the real-life comedy these "Sat
urday Night Live" veterans only
dream of.
Perched near several amateurish
graphs, Sen. Gordon Humphrey (R-
N.H.) appeared to be single-hand
edly safeguarding the future of the
American family. The former Delta
Air Lines pilot told those in the
sparsely-attended hearing room that
the public deserved the most up-to
date information on the "evil weed."
But instead of offering fresh in
formation to a long-confused public,
Humphrey and nine carefully chosen
witnesses only succeeded in pres
enting the same old story: anyone
who smokes marijuana, they sug
gested, will become a zombie, earn
poor grades and be unable to estab
lish lasting relationships.
William Pollin, director of the Na
tional Institute on Drug Abuse, even
rehashed the old "stepping-stone
hypothesis." Smoking marijuana, he
peeped, may lead to snorting co
caine and shooting heroin.
When a representative from the
National Association of Secondary
School Principals said dope leads to
"repeated instances of inappropriate
behavior," Humphrey nodded his
head slowly, and six committee aides
did likewise. Though Humphrey was
the only senator attending, the hear
ing had sitcom possibilities.
Regardless of their intentions,
Humphrey and his crew didn't ad
vance the continuing marijuana de
bate.
To date, no one has escaped the
two schools of thought on marijuana.
One group says it's very harmful; the
other contends it's harmless. No
wonder we're confused about its side
effects.
Go back through any government
report on marijuana during the 1970s
and you'll discover there are "no un
healthy effects from the moderate
use of marijuana." Accepting the
government's word as gospel, many
friends in high school and college
began smoking dope and still do.
Medical reports today, however,
suggest that marijuana may not be as
safe as previously estimated. The Oct.

18 issue of the Journal of the Ameri
can Medical Association reveals that
heavy marijuana use may cause
"flashbacks," emotional dis
turbances, plus lung and reproduc
tive problems.
Though reversals like these are the
nature of scientific inquiry, they've
been largely ignored by our friends.
Most know the medical jury is still
out on marijuana and don't expect it
to come back soon with a verdict.
For many of our friends, the ap
parent absence of balanced drug in
formation isa real tragedy. Questions
of legalization and dangers relative
to alcohol cloud the issue of mari
juana safety.
Perhaps the fairest analysis was
published last year in the Harvard
Medical School Health Letter, which
reported the following:
• "While high, marijuana users may
become somewhat clumsy; they
react more slowly than normal, per
ceive the passage of time less ac
curately; pay attention less well, and
do arithmetic less well; they also
show defects in short-term memory
during the high. A serious threat to
health from this condition is im
paired driving . . .
• "There is no solid evidence that
other, more serious or lasting psy
chological effects are likely to result
from marijuana use . . . ." And there
are no reports to show "that mari
juana permanently damages the
brain."
• "Sufficiently heavy, long-term
marijuana smoking probably leads to

chronic bronchitis, just as tobacco
smoking does."
• "During the high, marijuana
causes the heart to beat faster and
work harder. Although this effect is
insignificant in healthy people, it may
be a hazard for anyone with heart
disease."
• "Production of the male
hormone testosterone and of sperm
can be reduced by marijuana, al
though the effects appear to be tem
porary and reversible; the signifi
cance of these changes is unclear. Ef
fects on females are even less well
studied, but it appears that marijuana
is capable of disturbing the
menstrual cycle .... Whether mari
juana can cause genetic damage is
simply not known .. .
Whether you smoke or rail against
marijuana, the current medical evi
dence is neither so benign nor so
deadly that it deserves exploitation.
Unfortunately, balanced medical
reports seem to be too complicated
and time consuming for Capitol Hill.
Folks like New Hampshire's Hum
phrey turn to the drug issue because
it guarantees a large harvest of politi
cal hay.
Humphrey is kidding himself if he
thinks he has a public health menace
by the horns. He seems scared to face
the real dragon: the large majority of
marijuana users are over 18 and
would find his performance good
movie material.
