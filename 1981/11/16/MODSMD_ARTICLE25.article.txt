## Why students bum (stop) out 
### 
Remember the days when students completed college
in four years? Those days of old when most people
thought that an M.B.A. was something you hung out a
car window. Now, many Stanford students decide to take
one or more quarters off from school, an occurrence
called "stopping out." More recently, the phenomenon
is being referred to as "bumming out." Bumming out is
another way of explaining why students leave school for
an extended period of time.
There are many reasons why students take time off
from school, but bumming out seems most common.
The first type of student who"bums out" is the 20th cen
tury hobo, a person searching for life, liberty, and a sum
mer internship. The second type of student who bums
out is depressed or bored, usually suffering from one too
many helpings of Stern Hall's "Cream of Chipped Beef
Surprise."
The 20th century hobo is the most inaccessible of all
Stanford students. He usually has no phone, a girlfriend
at UC-Santa Cruz, and watches Batman everyday at 5:00.
What's more, the guy seldom showers, claiming it's bad
for his karma. Well it sure doesn't do much for my karma,
let alone my asthma.
The female hobos are even more bizarre. I met one
who insisted I call her "Starshine." As a joke I told her I
was from Los Angeles and "couldn't really relate to her
name on account of the smog." Well, this girl wouldn't
leave me alone. "Hey, are you a Gemini? You could be a
Leo with those brown eyes. Do you want to go to Nep
tune with me? Reno? How about the Coffee House?
I finally tracked down one of those inaccessible hobos
at Antonio's Nut House, a respectable dive on California
Avenue. I understand why these hobos decide to take
time off from school, but I could never figure out what
they did:
lordan: What do you do when you're bumming out?
Hobo: A lot of things, man. I try to make money. I just
get high a lot.
lordan: Do you mean on drugs?
Hobo: No man, heights, mountains. You know, the
Sierras, long trails, clean air, sweaty feet. I just reek after
one of those trips.
Jordan: You didn't have to tell me that.
Hobo: It feels good, man.
The other type of bum, the Stanford depressive, differs
greatly from the 20th century hobo. These Stanford de
pressives are usually sophomore girls in the trailers, or
guys who know Norm Robinson personally. The Stan
ford depressive never admits to bumming out, but is
always equipped with a good defense:
"Where were you last quarter?" I asked curiously,
"Your friend, Sheila, told me you decided to stop out."

"Who me?" she responded. "No, I was just taking all
night classes."
"Sheila told me you were seeing a psychoanalyst," I
stated firmly.
"Well, during the day, yeah. But I never really wanted
to stop out. I just came down with a little anorexia, that's
all," she finally decided.
Other reasons do exist which explain why students in
terrupt their college agenda. Some explanations are vol
untary, others are involuntary. By investigating these,
one can better understand why students stop out, and
possibly understand just what happened to that room
mate who never studied.
When one voluntarily decides to take one quarter off
from school, an agonizing thought process is usually in
volved. The most difficult part of this thought process is
convincing your parents that your life has not officially
ended when youtakeaquarter off. I always thought that
the University could help out students on this touchy
matter by.sending a short advising letter to parents:
Dear Parents,
While your son has decided to take time off from
school, according to our records, he is still very much
alive. We can assure you that his status at this university is
secure, although his Student ID card has been placed on
the "injured-reserve" list. We suggest you continue to
love your child, just stop sending money.
Sincerely yours,
Stanford University
Indeed for many students, money is the primary
motivation behind stopping out. By making money in
stead of going to school, Stanford students get an early
jump on the American Dream â€” a chance to live in Los
Angeles. It's the domino principle of money: first, a
good internship, then an M.8.A., a high-paying job,
move to Los Angeles, build a jacuzzi, and die.
Students who involuntarily stop out defy the law that:
once you're in Stanford, you're in for good. Un
fortunately, these are the people you like to have
around. They keep the medians low, write lousy papers,
and party a lot. They're normal. In fact, these students
have in many ways benefitted Academic life on campus.
They initiated the. Pass/No Credit option, gave credibility
to taking a class incomplete, and keep Stanford football
competitive. Well, almost.
For those who have stopped out and wonder why
nothing in this commentary truthfully explains why stu
dents take time off, I will confess that I have never
stopped out. Like most students, I would like to, but my
parents won't let me.
