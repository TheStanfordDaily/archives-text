## Anything wrong? Blame the Zetes 
### 
As Stanford students we applaud
Norm Robinson's stance concerning
the Zetes. We're behind you, Norm.
We just thought it would happen a
lot sooner. The "Mills woman inci
dent" is nothing compared to what
the Zetes have done in the past. We
wonder why no action was taken in
these instances.
For example, we bet no one knows
that the Zetes are responsible for all
the graffiti on Meyer bathroom walls.
Not only that, but do you know why
ourfootball teamis3-7? It's the Zetes.
It's all their fault. We hate their guts.
Norm'saction has really brought to
light some other problems the Zetes
have caused. Lousy food service?
Blame it on the Zetes. And how about
the housing shortage? It's all Zete

propaganda. There are actually three
empty dorms on the Knoll. This one
will surprise you: the Zetes are the
ones who are really behind the wom
en's groups condemning the Phi Delt
calendar. And these examples will in
terest every Stanford student: the
Zetes are responsible both for poor
teachers in the math department and
the rising cost of tuition.
But these drunken Zetes haven't
even confined their meddling to the
campus. That's right, they are re
sponsible for both the presence of
the medfly in the area and Governor
Brown's plan to eradicate them. Also,
sources in Washington today con
firmed that it was the Zete lobby that
pushed through the postal rate hike.
The Zete wrongdoing isn't just a

new development. The Stanford Dai
ly recently did some articles on the
mysterious death of Mrs. Stanford.
Hell, it ain't no mystery. The Zetes did
it. History shows that the Zetes were
also responsible for the stock market
crash of 1929, the Spanish Inquisition,
and the Norman Invasion of 1066.
Pontius Pilate was a Zete. This is the
crowning blow — the snake in the
Garden of Eden was really just a Zete
pledge.
We just want you to know Norm
that we are with you one hundred
percent. Fight! Fight! Fight! Oh by
the way, Crothers was getting a little
noisy last Friday night.
