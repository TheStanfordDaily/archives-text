# Lantos: hard times helped AWACS sale
## 
### Pat Carroll 
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) said that "a
most profound combination of oil, banking and
general business interests, all operating in the
Saudi Arabians' favor," has created an American
attitude of insistence on giving the Saudis what
they want.
Lantos spoke yesterday before a near-capacity
crowd in Bishop Auditorium and addressed the
topic of "United States-Israel Relations."
Lantos called the Middle East situation "gloomy,
somber, serious and extremely pessimistic in the
short run." The congressman, one of a handful
who led the unsuccessful fight to oppose the sale

of Airborne Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) to the Saudis, said that the margin of de
feat indicates the critical value of the individual
vote.
"If three of my friends — Warren Magnuson
from Washington, Birch Bayh of Indiana, Frank
Church of Idaho — had survived the 'massacre of
1980,' the Senate also would have turned down the
bill," Lantos said.
A bill prohibiting President Ronald Reagan's
proposed AWACS sale to the Saudis was rejected
by the Senate in a 52-48 vote.
Referring to the sale, Lantos said,"You must un
derstand that we are not dealing with a sinister

scheme. But as a country slipping into what is likely
to be the most severe recession since World War 11,
the business interests of millions of Americans are
dependent on giving the Saudis what they want."
Lantos said that Americans must recognize the
extent of the Saudis' wealth and its ties to the econ
omy of this country. "Only then will (the American
public) understand why is it that fairy tales are told
about the AWACS package, why chambers of
commerce across the country have argued that the
sales must go ahead."
"A growing web of general economic interests
— tens of billions of dollars in American financial
institutions, American government
securities, companies, farms and es
tablishments of all types — are
purchased (by the Saudis)," he said.
"And the people who work for them
are becoming part and parcel of a
pro-Arab lobby which is gaining in
strength in this country."
Lantos said there was a remarkable
game going on of portraying the
Saudis as something they are not, that
"it is merely the tip of the iceberg
that (permits) a lobby capable of
buying the most expensive legal and
public relations advice." He spoke of
a public relations pamphlet com
pliled by "an old friend, now work
ing for Saudi Arabia at a salary of
$350,000." Lantos said the pamphlet
shows a mutually beneficial rela
tionship between two great powers,
working hand in hand to foster good
will and features pictures of Franklin
Roosevelt and a former king of Saudi
Arabia. According to Lantos, the
pamphlet carries the implied
message: "We (the Saudis) just have
to have these AWACS to protect the
oil.
"There is nobody above the age of
a child who can seriously believe that
the U.S. feels more secure in turning
over to Saudi Arabia this ultra-sophis
ticated weaponry, rather than con
tinue the present practice of flying
and maintaining our own planes,"
Lantos said. He said that the Saudis'
desire to control their AWACS, rath
er than submit to U.S.-controlled and
operated AWACS surveillance of that
country, was a desire expressive of a

"macho image, and little else."
In addition to the economic pres
sures of a Saudi lobby, Lantos cited
political pressures which contributed
to the swell of public approval of the
sale. "There are those who feel that
the Camp David Accords are passed,
that it is time to move on,"he said.
Lantos called the Camp David Ac
cords "one of history's most non
symmetrical agreements.
"Israel gave up oil, air bases on the
Sinai, the cushion of security that
having some space can provide,"
Lantos said. "Egypt gave up an at
titude of hostility." Of the late Egyp
tian President Anwar Sadat, Lantos
said, "He was a prince of peace who
at long last recognized that it makes
sense to search for mutual goals."
"But Camp David represented the
giving up of tangible goods on the
one side (Israel's), for good will on
the other (Egypt's)," Lantos said. "But
the hand of friendship has been of
fered for 31 years by Israel."
Lantos, who is the only survivor of
the holocaust to have ever been
elected to Congress, called the ap
parent abandonment of the Camp
David Accords "one of the shoddiest,
most vicious cop-outs in 20th century
history." He said that after April 1982,
Israel will have fulfilled its commit
ment to the Camp David Accords.
"Now we are being told that since
Camp David is not moving too well,
(we should abandon it for the Saudi
peace plan).
"The Saudi peace plan represents
the liquidation of the entire state of
Israel, " Lantos said.
