Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) said that "a
most profound combination of oil, banking and
general business interests, all operating in the
Saudi Arabians' favor," has created an American
attitude of insistence on giving the Saudis what
they want.
Lantos spoke yesterday before a near-capacity
crowd in Bishop Auditorium and addressed the

public) understand why is it that fairy tales are told
about the AWACS package, why chambers of
commerce across the country have argued that the
sales must go ahead."
