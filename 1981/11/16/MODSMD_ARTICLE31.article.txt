# Allen denies taking bribe
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — National Se
curity Adviser Richard Allen
denied Saturday he ever
sought or expected a $1000
payment for an exclusive in
terview with Nancy Reagan by
a Japanese magazine.
Allen admitted that he did
receive the initial request for
the interview through the wife
of a long-time friend from
Japan, but said he simply
passed the request on to others
in the White House to arrange.
Mrs. Reagan gave an in
terview to a reporter for the
Japanese magazine
Shufunotomo on Jan. 21 — the
day after her husband's in
auguration.
According to the magazine,
the $1000 payment was an
"honorarium" offered at the
end of the session to thank
Mrs. Reagan for granting the
interview.
Allen's denial was issued in a
brief statement released by the
White House, which said it
would have no additional com
ments on Allen's handling of
the funds while the matter is
being reviewed by the Justice
Department.
In Texas, where he was on his
first wild turkey shoot, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan also told
reporters: "I can't comment on
that while it's under review."
The incident surfaced here
Friday after a Japanese news
paper reported that officials in
Tokyo had completed a top se
cret investigation of bribery al
legations involving a senior
White House official.
Allen told reporters Friday
that he accepted the money
because he did not want to em

barrass Mrs. Reagan or offend
the Japanese reporter and her
country's journalistic customs.
He said the money had been
put into an office safe where it
was forgotten for about eight
months and then only dis
covered after an office move.
The FBI, and subsequently the
Justice Department, have con
ducted investigations.
"As to whether I asked for or
ever expected to receive any
honorarium, gratuity or fee,
the answer is categorically no,"
Allen said in his statement.
"Nor was such a matter ever
raised with me by anyone at
any time."
And he insisted that he had
no active role in setting up the
interview with Mrs. Reagan
and Japanese reporter Fuyuko
Kamisaka.
"As to whether I actually ar
ranged the meeting, the an
swer is likewise 'no,'" Allen
said. "I did receive the initial
request that there be a meeting
for the purpose of an in
terview, which I passed on to
others for evaluation, handling
and decision."
Who exactly set up the meet
ing is not clear at this point. In
Los Angeles, where she accom
panied Mrs. Reagan for the
weekend, the First Lady's press
secretary Sheila Tate said she
did not arrange the interview.
According to the White House,
Mrs. Reagan did not learn
about the $1000 payment until
Friday.
As National Security Advisor,
it is not normally within the
scope of Allen's duties to ar
range interviews with the
press, lending credence to his
story that he did not seek the
honorarium.
The reporter for the

Japanese magazine was re
portedly accompanied during
the White House interview by
an interpreter Chizuko Takase,
who first approached Allen
with the idea for an interview.
In his statement, Allen de
scribed her as "the wife of a
friend of many years' stand
ing."
"Her husband and I had
been academic colleagues, and
later we had individually
served as business consultants
to several organizations and
companies," Allen said, add
ing, "There lias been no finan
cial relationship between us."
The controversy over Allen's
actions have teamed up with
the controversy surrounding
budget director David Stock
man to make this past week
one of the most trying of Rea
gan's term in office.
Reached by reporters at the
turkey shoot, Reagan made it
very clear he did not want to
talk about his difficulties.
Asked whether he planned
to keep his national secuity ad
viser, Richard Allen, on at the
White House despite the al
legations, the president again
declined comment.
The other embarrassment of
the week came when Stock
man publicly questioned the
soundness of the president's
economic program and
likened it to previous "trickle
down" programs of other ad
ministrations.
For such criticism to come
from someone so integral to
the budget plan hurts Reagan's
chances of getting his plan ac
cepted by not only the Con
gress, but also by the American
people, whose groundswell
support has been recognized
as vital to any economic plan.
