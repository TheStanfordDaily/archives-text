## Labor spurning Reagan to woo Dems 
### 
New York — Former Vice
President Walter Mondale and
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) will re new ties with big
labor this week at an AFL-CIO
convention where top Reagan
administration officials and Re
publican luminaries will be
conspicuous by their absence.
The AFL-CIO, this year cele
brating the 100 th anniversary
of the American trade union
movement, will roll out the red
carpet for Mondale and Ken
nedy, prospective rivals for the
1984 Democratic Party presi
dential nomination.
Leaders of the 15 million
member labor federation will

mix union business with presi
dential politics as they gird for
an all-out fight in 1982 to re
trieve some of the con
gressional seats union allies lost
in Ronald Reagan's presiden
tial landslide
Although federation Presi
dent Lane Kirkland insists that
unions "will not be the cap
tive" of any political party, the
AFL-CIO is playing an increas
ing role in the Democratic Par
ty. It has broadened its mem
bership on the Democratic Na
tional Committee and is lifting
its profile in party policy de
bates.
The biennial convention
opens today. Labor leaders will

be marking the centennial of a
movement which grew out of
formation of a confederation
of trade unions in Pittsburgh in
1881.
Kirkland, who seems certain
to win re-election to another
term without opposition,
broke from the AFI -ClO's trad
ition of routinely inviting the
president of the United States
to this parley.
Kirkland's position, backed
by the policy-making ex
ecutive council, was that Rea
gan forfeited an invitation by
firing some 11,500 illegally
striking air traffic controllers.
Both Mondale and Kennedy

have formed political action
committees and are con
sidered by most political ob
servers as sure-fire White
House aspirants in 1984. Each
has been wooing union leaders
and both supported the Sept.
19 "Solidarity Day" protest rally
in the nation's capital, in which
more than a quarter of a mil
lion people marched to vent
their anger over Reagan's
budget and tax policies.
Mondale will address the
convention today and Ken
nedy will follow two days later.
House Speaker Tip O'Neill
also will address the conven
tion, but no GOP office
holders will be there.
