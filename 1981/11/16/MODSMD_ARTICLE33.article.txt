# Auto makers at design crossroad

### Washington Post 
Washington — Detroit's large cars, the
ugly ducklings of the U.S. auto fleet, are
selling surprisingly well in this fall's de
pressed economy despite their size, gaso
line appetite and old-style, rear-wheel
drive engines.
According to the script adopted by most
of the industry, large cars like the Chrysler
New Yorkers, Olds 88s and Ford Cranadas
were doomed, headed for sure re
placement over the next few years by
waves of smaller, newly designed cars with
modern, front-wheel-drive technology.
Instead, they have won a reprieve.
Chrysler Corp.'s compacts remain its
best selling models by far, but its hottest
car is the intermediate-sized New Yorker,
with a waiting list of would-be buyers.
Sales of General Motors Corp.'s mid-sized
cars in September reached their highest
levels of the year, partially offsetting de
clines in smaller models. And demand for
many full-sized CM and Ford models is
substantially higher now than at the begin
ning of the year.
At the same time, GM has had to cut pro
duction of its front-wheel-drive J-cars, in
troduced last May, because of disappoint
ing sales.
The switch is even more apparent in the
used-car market, perhaps the purest
barometer of auto demand because of the
absence of rebates and strategic pricing. In
October, the average auction price of
large cars nationwide was up 5 percent
from September, while the small-car aver
age price dropped 1 percent. Since Octo
ber 1980, large used-car prices have risen
28 percent, compared to 16 percent for
small cars.
The question tor Detroit now is whether
it has oversold the appeal of the smaller
front-wheel-drive cars, to itself and the
public?
Solid conclusions about car buyers'
tastes may be impossible to draw these
days, with auto sales at their lowest point in
23 years. But auto experts and industry of
ficials make these points about the recent
coolness toward smaller front-wheel-drive
cars and the revival of interest in the old

gas guzzlers:
— Believing that the public had fallen in
love with front-wheel-drive cars, Detroit
pushed prices on these models to the limit
while holding back increases on larger,
rear-wheel-drive cars. GM's new front
wheel-drive Cavalier CL4 station wagon
has a base sticker price of $8492. For $200
less, a motorist can buy the substantially
larger Caprice wagon.
"Fully loaded big cars don't cost any
more than the new fully loaded little cars,"
said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst with
Paine, Webber, Mitchell, Hutchins. "Con
sumers are deciding there is more value in
the larger cars."
— Many buyers have apparently con
cluded that front-wheel drive isn't essen
tial in a new car.
This design, which got its big push in
1979 with the introduction of General Mo
tors' X-cars, transmits engine power direct
ly to the front wheels by a complex trans
mission-axle combination, rather than to
the rear wheels through a long drive shaft
— the customary way for most of this cen
tury.
Detroit has spent millions of advertising
dollars to persuade the public that front
wheel drive is much more than a better
way of powering a car. The Chevrolet Cita
tion and Cavalier, Ford Escort, the Dodge
Aries and their front-powered cousins
were Detroit's answer to the small, fuel-ef
ficient Japanense imports, and front
wheel-drive was a key factor, reducing ve
hicle weight without cramping occupants,
the industry said.
And beyond that, the front-wheel cars
represented the restoration of American
auto technology after a painful battering
by the Japanese, the industry told con
sumers.
The transition to this technology still
continues, but not as fast as GM and many
industry analysts had figured initially.
In today's economy, consumers are
checking prices much more closely than
the rniles-per-gallon ratings. GM's X-cars
were introduced in 1979 in the midst of the
Iranian revolution and gasoline lines that
assured their initial success, said Kehrl. I he
stable gasoline prices of the past year have

apparently eased that concern on the part
of consumers.
Although GM won't confirm it, industry
analysts believe it has given up plans to re
place full-sized Olds and Buick models
with front-wheel-drive models, once
scheduled for 1983.
"We've stretched out some of our pro
grams," says GM's Kehrl. "Maybe we were
pushing the throttle too hard.
"We aren't exactly loaded with money,"
he adds.
Is the industry rethinking its commit
ment to front-wheel-drive cars? The an
swer is no, Kehrl insists, despite the an
nouncements of plant closings and con
struction delays.
"Clearly, front-wheel-drive has been
oversold," a spokesman for Ford said.
Ford, with less money to spend than GM,
had not plunged as deeply into front
wheel-drive conversion for its mid- and
large-sized cars. And the recent revival of
interest in the larger, rear-drive cars is
something of a vindication.
Ford notes that major front-wheel-drive
components are more expensive to build
than comparable rear-wheel-drive units.
Other critics warn that the precise engi
neering required in the front-wheel-drive
components make these cars more ex
pensive to repair, and Detroit will have to
make good on its quality campaign to
avoid a consumer backlash on service
charges in the years ahead.
Ford feels more comfortable today
about sticking with its older, rear-wheel
drive designs and "isn't going to throw
away perfectly good engines or trans
missions just because of a fad," the spokes
man said.
Kehrl of GM emphasizes that Detroit
isn't going to make the same mistake it
made in 1975, when the memory of gaso
line lines and escalating fuel prices faded
and consumers began to demand large
cars again. At that point, the U.S. auto
makers turned their backs on small, fuel
efficient compacts, leaving the door open
to the Japanese — and they streamed
through it when gasoline prices took off
again in 1979.
