## Junior breaks Tony Dorsett's all- purpose record Cards skewer Ducks as Nelson becomes best NCAA back 
### Sally Jenkins 
The sky had a funny lead color to it, the foot
ball was sloppy and the game would have been
more interesting had it rained. But as the Stan
ford Cardinals glided to a predictable 42-3 vic
tory over the University of Oregon Ducks Satur
day, a rarity occurred.
It was just about the time that the space shuttle
Columbia slid to a halt on Planet Earth that Stan
ford halfback Darrin Nelson became the leading
all-purpose runner in collegiate history, eclips
ing the record of former University of Pittsburgh
All-America Tony Dorsett.
Nelson, who needed only 78 yards going into
the contest, ran for 122 yards and two touch
downs, caught six passes for 60 yards and re
turned two punts for 15 yards to make his total
carreer yardage 6735 by the time he left the
game early in the fourth quarter. Dorsett's
former record was 6615.
The senior picked up 8 yards the first time he
touched the ball but the gain wascalled back be
cause of a clipping penalty on Stanford, an in
dication of the way the game would go. Officials
slapped both teams with penalties all day, but
Nelson sparked the Cards early with his record
and two TD scampers. His efforts gave them val
uable breathing room that would come in handy
later during an ineffectual third quarter.
Nelson already had his record and one touch
down before the end of the first quarter. The
record-breaker came on a 7-yard punt return
with 15 seconds left in the period.
"I could have just said 'Darrin Nelson' and
walked away for my halftime speech," said Stan
lord head coach Paul Wiggin. Nelson received a
(Standing ovation in the stands and from his
■teammates in the locker room at halftime.
Before the game, Stanford's offensive line
[coaches had written Dorsett's record and
Nelson's needed yardage in neat figures on the
blackboard in a pre-game meeting room.
Stanford lost no time in trying to establish the
record for everyone's favorite scatback. On their
first possesion, the Cards went 77 yards in 10
plays, of which 41 yards and 6 plays were
Nelson's. Flanker Mike Tolliver gained 12 on a
reverse on Stanford's first play of the game,
Nelson gained nine around the left end and
caught a 20-yard pass from quarterback john
Elway moments later.
Gains of 6 and 3 yards from halfback Vincent
White and fullback Greg Hooper, and a 15-yard
completion from Elway to split-end Marty
Martinez gave the Cards a first down on the four.
The next three downs had Nelson's name writ
ten on them. He went around the left end for 3,
up the middle for no gain, and scored around
end on his third try.
Stanford scored in the air next, when Elway
capped a 10-play 69-yard drive with a 9 yard TD

pass to Martinez in a crowd. Completions to
freshman flanker Emile Harry for 17, Nelson for
six and 11 and Tolliver for 21 — plus Nelson runs
of 6 and two yards — took the Cards to the 6 yard
line. White was caught behind the line for a loss
of three on first down and an Elway-White pass
fell incomplete. On third and nine Elway threw
under pressure to a double-covered Mariinez in
the front right corner of the end zone for the
Cards second score of the quarter.
The Cards scored twice more before the half
ran out, and the Ducks opened the door for the
deluge with two costly fumbles, the first on their
own 10 yardline on the third play of the second
quarter.
Nelson gained five and four yards on the first
two plays as Stanford took over, but illegal pro
cedure put the Cards back at the seven. On
third-and-six, however, Tolliver scored when he
snagged Elway's pass in the corner of the end
zone.
Oregon mounted its first sustained drive of
the day next with 12:04 remaining in the quarter.
The Ducks manuevered to the Stanford 25 yard
line, but on fourth-and-one Price caused hissec
ond turnover of the day when he knocked the
ball out of Oregon tailback Ron Billup's hands,
nearly knocking Billups out.
The Cardinals capitalized again, going 80 yards
in only seven plays. Elway connected with
Martinez for 17, White went around the left end
for seven, head-faked his way for 21 more on the
next play, and and went around the right end for
12 to put the Cards at the Oregon 35. Elway hit
fullback Rob Moore for four yards to the 19,
Nelson went over the right tackle for 12 to make
it first-and-goal on the eight, and skipped in mo
ments later for the final score of the half.
Oregon mounted its only scoring drive at the
end of the sloppy, back-and-forth third quarter.
Aided by two Stanford facemask penalties, the
Ducks marched 67 yards in nine plays before
placekicker Doug jollymour booted a 40-yard
field goal from the Card 23 yardline.
Stanford, plagued by penalties during the
third period, was unable to score again until
midway through the fourth. The Cards went 44
yards in six plays on a drive nursed along by a 16-
yard pass to Moore, and a face mask penalty on
Oregon. On first down at the eight, Nelson car
ried for two — his last call of the game — and
Hooper scampered six yards on a draw play to
the end zone.
The final score of the game came from thesec
ond unit when defensive back Garin Veris re
covered an Oregon fumble at the Ducks' 37
yardline. Fullback Mike Dotterer scored single
handedly, gaining three yards at right tackle,
then breaking loose on second down for 34 sui
cidal yards and a TD.


HE'S THE BEST — Darrin Nelson will be finishing up his ca
reer at Stanford this Saturday after rewriting the Stanford,
Pacific-10 Conference and NCAA record books. Crown
ing himself the best hack in Stanford history his freshman

Mike Boennighausen/Dail'
year, Nelson has never stopped breaking records or hav
ing fun. On his way to breaking the NCAA all-purpose
rushing record Saturday, he compiled 546 yards rushing
and 410 yards receiving in the three previous games.
