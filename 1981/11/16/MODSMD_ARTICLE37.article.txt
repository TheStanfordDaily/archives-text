The youthful Stanford men's
cross country team saw its sea
son end abruptly Saturday
when it failed to qualify for Na
tionals in the NCAA Region
8/Pacific-10 Conference
Championship meet held on
the Stanford Golf Course.
The Stanford squad took fifth
place overall, placing behind
UCLA, which won its second
consecutive Pac-10 Cham
pionship, the University of Ari
zona, the University of Oregon
and California. FresnoStatefin
ished sixth, winning the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association title

in doing so.
Stanford, which started
quickly as a team and then
slowly faded, was hurt by the
failure of all top-five runners to
run true to form in competition
— a behavior that has plagued
the Card runners all season.
In Saturday's meet, Stan
ford's top two runners were
unable to generate good per
formances. Team captain Rod
Berry, a senior running his last
race as a Cardinal, fell to 32nd
after placing ninth last year.
N0.2 man Jim Smith finished far
back in the pack as Stanford's
seventh tape-breaker after tak

ing a fall in the mud early in the
race.
"We got out really quick at
the start and ran the first four
miles brilliantly," Stanford
coach Mike Tommasello said.
"In a meet like this, you've got
to be aggressive and get posi
tion early. We did that. But the
finish line isn't at four miles, it's
at 6.2 miles. We're still a bit in
consistent; we've got to com
pete in that last third of the
race."
In reference to Smith's fall,
which hindered his running,
Tommasello said: "Sometimes
you have to overcome breaks
during the race. You have to
continue to compete after a fall
and Jim didn't do that. This isn't
to knock Jim, because he has
been our most consistent
runner during the season."
Fifth-year-senior Tom
O'Neil, who also ran as a Card
for the last time Saturday, led
Stanford by finishing 20th in
32:04.6 over the 10,000 meters
edging teammate Bill Graham,
a junior, who was 21st with
32:06. Berry's 32nd was in a
time of 32:26.4, freshman Brian
Pettingill took 38th in 32:42.2,
sophomore Mike Sokolewicz
captured 40th with a 32:48.2

and freshman Jeff Atkinson
placed 80th in 34:22.8 followed
by Smith in 84th place with a
34:39. Over 120 runners com
peted in all.
The performance of O'Neil,
who had run a special time trial
even to make the Card's squad
for the race, was a pleasant sur
prise.
"I was really psyched before
the race because I knew how
much it meant to the team,"
O'Neil said. "I'm really happy
because I've had such a bad
season up until now. The team
is pretty bummed though.
We're still trying to figure it
out."
A classic battle developed

between the leaders when the
top-five runners staged an all
out sprint over the last half
mile, finishing in a group so
tight that only 12 seconds
seperated first from fifth place.
Richard Twuei, one of a long
line of excellent Kenyan
runners from Washington State
University, broke the tape at
30:56.01, followed by Bill Mc-
Chesney of Oregon in second
place at 30:58.4. Dave Daniels
of UCLA was third with a
31:04.1, Tom Downs of UC-
Berkeley was fourth in 31:05.7
and Donald Janicki of Arizona
was fifth with a 31:08.1. UCLA
nudged Arizona by one point
to capture the Pac-10 title but

both teams will make the trip to
Wichita State University in
Wichita, Kan. for the N( AA
finals held Nov. 23.
Tomasello analyzed these.i •
son as a time of learning arid
growth for his runners.
"I'd say we had a success: jl
year," the coach said. "We
gained a lot of strength and we
learned a great deal off the
course as well as on. We've still
got a long way to go. I came to
Stanford two years ago to re
store the Stanford cross coun
try team as a contender in the
Pac-10. It's a two or three year
project. We've got a really
good nucleus to work with."

HARRIERS FALL SHORT — The Stanford men's cross country team, after an up-and
down season, failed to qualify Saturday for the NCAA Championships to be held late in
November at Wichita State. In the Pacific-lONCAA District 8 Championships held at the
Stanford Golf Course, Stanford placed fifth after running well for the first four miles but
faltering after that. A young team, Stanford has a good future in the Pac-10 but couldn't
put it all together this year. UCLA won the race Saturday.
