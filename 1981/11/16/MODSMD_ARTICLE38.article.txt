# Darrin Nelson: the most prolific yard-gainer ever
## 
### Mike Oneal 
It was like a birthday.
You think about it all week and you think about
all that precedes it — all that builds up to it — and
then it comes and goes so quickly you hardly know
it happened at all. It'salmost anticlimactic. But you
do know that it marks the culmination of many
great things and after a while the day doesn't mat
ter anymore. All that does matter is the achieve
ment.
When Stanford halfback Darrin Nelson took the
NCAA all-purpose rushing record away from
former Pittsburgh (now Dallas Cowboy) halfback
Tony Dorsett Saturday, the moment touched on
irony. ,
Here, the most valuable back in NCAA history,
the man who juked, spun, sprinted and smiled his
way into the heart of every Stanford fan, broke one
of the most impressive records there are to break
on an unflashy (if functional) 7-yard punt return. It
was a lackluster game on a lackluster day in the

middle of a lackluster season, but the most
lusterous running back in Stanford history had just
become a national treasure.
And everybody loved it.
"You should have seen it at halftime," Nelson's
head coach Paul Wiggin said, "all the natural emo
tion. There were things I wanted to say, but I
couldn't. They were all clapping for him and there
was too much noise."
"When a guy like Darrin does what he does,"
Wiggin added, "it's a team thing. The team feels a
part of what's going on. I think they really wanted
it, the whole community wanted it. To anybody as
sociated with Darrin, he's a popular little guy."
The fireworks started early for Darrin Nelson on
the Farm. In his first year here he achieved what
nobody else ever had in college football. He
caught 50 passes and rushed for 1000 yards. He did
it again the next year and was picked All-America.
Then, just as the national recognition began to
flow in, Nelson ripped the hamstring tendon from

his light knee while longjumpingand had tositout
his junior year.
Last year, Nelson was back but he wasn't quite
the same. It wasn't until the end of the season that
the Stanford community became reassured the
magic was still there. This season, Darrin has
eclipsed himself. He and quarterback John Elway
have quite literally carried the team and Darrin has
looked more powerful, confident and magical
than ever. He has looked like the Heisman Trophy
winners he surpassed in the record books and like
the Heisman Trophy winner he will never be.
Upon achieving the status of the best all
purpose rusher in history, Nelson was pure
Nelson.
"When they were clapping for me at halftime, it
felt good but it was kinda embarassing." he said. "I
was just sitting in the middle of the room thinking
'God, I wish they would stop.' I don't really like
getting a lot of attention. I get pretty embarassed.
I'm just glad I don't turn red."
