# Second win at Berkeley in 10 years
## Water poloists drown Cal Bears 
### Chris Addington 
The rain poured in buckets.
It was a perfectly miserable day
for anyone in the sports world
except for those in the world of
water polo. The Stanford team
traveled to UC-Berkeley's Har
mon Pool Friday and won 11-7,
raising their record to 27-0 for
the year with one game left in

regular season play.
"It's the best we've played
over there since I've been a
coach," commented Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti after
the game. "We maintained a
four or five goal lead through
out most of the entire match,"
he added.
And certainly anything is

better than the way the
Cardinals usually play when
they travel to Cal. This was only
the second time in 10 years
Stanford has won at Berkeley
and the first time under Det
tamanti's coaching.
The No.l ranked Cardinals
started off the game in true
Stanford fashion, jumping to a
quick 3-0 lead by the end if the
first quarter.
The Bears made their only
threatening advance when
they scored two goals early in
the second period to bring the
score to within one but once
again the Cards exploded and
lead at the half by a score of 6-3.
Throughout the second half,
the teams exchanged goals but
Cal never came close again and
Stanford coasted to a com
fortable win.
It was certainly not as im
pressive or dominating a win as
many of the Stanford matches
have been this year. However,
considering the facilities, the
weather and the general air of
fatalism that typically sur
rounds teams that journey to
Harmon Pool, it was a definite
moral victory for the Cards.
Even though Stanford's ex

plosive countering offense was
severely hampered by Cal's 25-
yard pool, the Cards managed
to squeeze out a few goals on
the c ounter-attack. Add to that
a stellar five-goal performance
from James Bergeson, who
leads the team with 65 goals on
the season, and the Stanford
offense was almost up-to-par.
The big story of the game,
however, was the play of the
Cardinal defense. The Stan
ford-7 held the Bears to only
two natural goals — Berkeley
had to rely on man-up situ
ations for their other five.
Nevertheless, Dettamanti
was a little critical of his teams'
man-down defense.
"We know we're going to
score goals, and when the oth
er team has the ball with a man
up situation we sometimes get
a little lax," he said.
Dettamanti praised the play
of senior Bill Taylor, who
wound up playing a spot — the
hole' — that he is unfamiliar
with.
"Taylor set hole for almost a
third of the game," Dettamanti
said, "and he did an excellent
job whenever Jody (Campbell,
the Cards regular hole set)
wasn't in there."
Besides Bergeson's five
goals, the rest of Stanford's
tallies came from, Campbell
with two, Taylor with two, and
Chris Kelsey and Alan
Mouchawar with one-apeice.
It was evident that the young
Berkeley squad had improved
immensely since early in the
season when Stanford de
feated them 13-4 at the NorCal
tourney. They will be particu
larly tough next year when two
redshirts, Mike Grier and Alan
Gresham, return tn thp team.

But the true test of the Bears'
improved play will be seen
next Saturday when they come
to deGuerre Pool to face Stan
ford in the last regular season
match of the year.
Playing a regulation-sized
tank may make the Bears less of
threat than they are on their
home turf.
"We should be able to beat
them by more than a few goals
when we play them here," said
Dettamanti.
Stanford boasts its own im
pressive home winning streak,
the Cardinals have not lost at

deGuerre since 1979 when
UCLA bumped them off.
Before that loss, Stanford had a
50-game streak at home.
Next weekend's match will
also be the last home ap
pearance of several stars who
have brought two National
Championships to the Farm.
Seniors Campbell,
Mouchawar, Kelsey, Vince
Vanelli, Taylor and Brian Felix
will all be making their final ap
pearances for Stanford as the
team tries to make it 28-0 and
enter the NCAA championship
with an unblemished No.l
ranking.
