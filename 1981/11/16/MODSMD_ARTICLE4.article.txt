# Campus spraying to halt if skies clear
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Tonight, weather permitting, will
mark the last application of the
malathion sprayings in Corridor Six
â€” for awhile, anyway.
According to Rodger Blake of the
press relations office of the Medfly
Eradication Project in Los Gatos,
aerial spraying will be discontinued
in 630 square miles after this week,
including Palo Alto, Menlo Park and
Stanford. Only one part of Corridor
Six, bounded by U.S. Highway 101
and the Bay, will continue to be
sprayed due to a recent find of two
fertile Medflies near Moffett Field.
Spraying will also continue in other
areas where Medflies were found in
September and October.
Asked if the sprayings had been
determined to be successful in
eradicating the Medfly, Blake said,
"The fact that we're phasing out the
spraying should indicate that we've
been successful."
But the saga of aerial spraying in
this area is far from over.
"Overall, the winter weather has
affected the project," said Blake.
"But our experience isthat the Medf
ly has adapted to this area with a
much longer life span. We probably
will find new flies during the winter
and spring. If we do find more, we'll
jump on it right away by resuming
spraying in the spring."
Residents in this area have ex
perienced the extension of the
sprayings time after time. When
aerial spraying began in July, it was
predicted by project officials that
only six applications were required.
In September the spraying was ex
tended to 12 and then 14 applica
tions, and finally project officials are
stopping after 16 applications.
"The areas that were aerially
sprayed have been extended
piecemeal, and that's why spraying
has continued," said Blake. "With
cooler temperatures, the life span of
the Medfly is longer. Thus, if we do

spray in the spring, there will proba
bly be another eight applications,
since the warmer weather should
make the life span of the fly shorter."
Blake said that while all the "clas
sic" information on Medflies stipu
lated that the life span of the fly is 22
to 35 days long, "we found out last
winter that our winters aren't too
cold for the fly, and the life span of
the Medfly in this area is somewhat
longer." He said the primary re
search the project has been using is
done by Dr. Richard Tassan of the
University of California at Berkeley.
"Tassan has found that the life span
of the fly can go up to 76 days in this
area, which is much longer than we
had originally thought," Blake said.
Aside from washing away the
malathion and thereby reducing the
effectiveness of each application, the
winter rains increase the number of
"fish kills" which occur in the Bay,
according to Blake.
"We've been monitoring water
samples in the creeks which run into
the Bay," he said. "When there's
been a rain 24 hours after an aerial
application, malathion is washed into
the Bay, killing some of the smaller
fish." He said this has happened "a
couple of times."
Blake said that a number of dam
age claims against the project have
been filed with a Board of Control set
up by the Eradication Project. "These
claims have primarily been con
cerned with auto paint damage," he
said. Claims must be filed within 100
days of damage in order to be valid.
None of the claims have been re
viewed yet, according to Blake, be
cause board members wanted to wait
until the aerial spraying stopped.
"There haven't been any
documented cases of health damage
that I know of," said Blake. "It's a
more nebulous area. It is definitely
true that some people are sensitive to
malathion."
He said that a health advisory com
mittee has been established, and that
the state and federal governments
plan an ongoing project to study the
long-term effects of the aerial
spraying of malathion.
"Doctors in the hospitals in the
area are supposed to report cases
that they feel are related to
malathion," said Blake. "But out of

an area of 1.5 million people, only
eight or nine have been reported to
date."
According to Blake, aerial spraying
has distributed 2.6 onces of
malathion per acre. The chemical
takes nine to 10 days to decompose
totally, he said, and the more diluted
the malathion (such as in swimming
pools), the faster it disintegrates.
