San Francisco (AP) — Matt
Bahr, a fill-in kicker for the San
Francisco 49ers early this sea
son, sounded almost
apologetic after beating them
yesterday.
"I can't say enough good
thingsabout the49ers. I madea
lot of friends in my short stay
here. It's good to come back
and say hello," said Bahr,
whose last-minute, 24-yard
field goal gave the Cleveland
Browns a 15-12 victory and
snapped the 49ers' seven-game
winning streak.
Bahr was kicking for the
49ers when that winning streak
began. He was traded to Cleve
land after a four-week stay in
San Francisco.
"We figured the most impor
tant factor would be the kick
ing game," said Browns Coach
Sam Rutigliano, who called on
Bahr with 43 seconds left in the
National Football League game
played on a soggy and treach
erous Candlestick Park field.
Rutigliano noted that the
wet field "made it difficult to
accelerate a pass rush," and the
49ers' detense in the last period

was without star rusher Fred
Dean, sidelined by a bruised
chest.
"The playing field didn't hurt
us any more than it hurt them.
It hurt them in the first three
quarters but it caught up with
us in the end," said 49ers
Coach Bill Walsh.
"We're not disheartened by
the defeat nor terribly de
jected," he added.
The Browns, now 5-6, tied
the score with 6:46 remaining
when Brian Sipe hit Reggie
Rucker on a 21-yard touch
down pass and Bahr added the
extra point. Sipe had com
pleted only nine of 25 passes
before getting hot on the 43-
yard touchdown drive.
A 40-yard punt return by
Dino Hall placed the Browns in
good field position for the start
of the drive leading to Rucker's
touchdown. Before that, the
Cleveland offense had been
past midfield only twice.
A 38-yard pass from Sipe to
Rucker helped set up the win
ning field goal by Bahr, who
handled the 49ers' placekick
ing in four games as a fill-in for

Ray Wersching, who was in
jured. Wersching kicked four
field goals yesterday, three
from 28 yards and one from 29.
The 49ers, who had the long
est winning streak in the NFL
this season, dropped to 8-3 but
remained three games ahead
in the National Conference
West standings.

Miami (AP) — Quarterback
Marc Wilson completed 16 of
39 passes for 180 yards and
three touchdowns yesterday to
lead the struggling Oakland
Raiders to a 33-17 National
Football League upset of the
AFC East-leading Miami
Dolphins.
All three of Wilson's scoring
aerials came as the defending
Super Bowl champions built a
21-3 halftime lead.
But the 4-6 Raiders had to
withstand a rally keyed by vet
eran Dolphin backup quarter
back Don Strock, w ho drew the
Dolphins to within 24-17 with
5:36 remaining, to claim only
their third victory in the past
eight games.

Oakland sealed the victory
w hen nose tackle Johnny Rob
inson chased Strock out of the
end zone for a safety and Ches
ter Willis sprinted 15 yards for a
touchdown after Miami unsuc
cessfully tried an "on-side
punt" after the safety.
The Dolphins fell to 7-3-1,
with the lets, whom they face at
New York next week, vaulting
into second place in the
Eastern Division at 6-4-1 with a
17-6 win over New England.
Buffalo, a 24-0 loser at St. Louis,
fell into third at 6-5.
Oakland took a 7-0 lead less
than two minutes into the
game when Wilson, a second
year pro from Brigham Young
making his fifth start, fired a 13-
yard scoring pass to Todd
Christensen, four plays after
Christensen recovered when
Miami's Fulton Walker
fumbled the opening kickoff at
the Dolphin 27.
The Raiders hiked their lead
to 14-0 when Wilson con
nected with Bob Chandler on a
37-yard pass play with 9:56 re
maining in the second quarter

and made it 21-0 when Wilson
completed an 11-play, 74-yard
drive with a 1-yard toss to tight
end Derrick Ramsey.
Miami got on the scoreboard
with Uwe von Schamann's 36-
yard field goal just before half
time, but the Dolphin offense
didn't come alive until Strock
replaced David Woodley with
8:28 to go in the third period of

a 24-3 lead.
Eddie Hill ran 5 yards to cap
an 80-yard drive and Strock
threw a 14-yard touchdown
pass to halfback Tony Nathan.
Strock hit four of his first six
passes for 42 yards as the
Dolphins drove from their own
20 in nine plays after Chris
Bahi's 32-yard field goal had
given Oakland a 24-3 lead.

Strock, a ninth-year pro,
then cut the deficit to seven
points with his pass to Nathan,
capping an eight-play, 54-yard
march.
Strock, who hadn't quarter
backed since starting in the
Dolphins' 31-21 loss at Buffalo
Oct. 12, finished the game with
16 completions in 25 attempts
and 169 yards.

Miami (AP) — Quarterback
Marc Wilson completed 16 of
39 passes for 180 yards and
three touchdowns yesterday to
lead the struggling Oakland
Raiders to a 33-17 National
Football League upset of the
AFC East-leading Miami
Dolphins.
All three of Wilson's scoring
aerials came as the defending
Super Bowl champions built a
21-3 halftime lead.
But the 4-6 Raiders had to
withstand a rally keyed by vet
eran Dolphin backup quarter
back Don Strock, w ho drew the
Dolphins to within 24-17 with
5:36 remaining, to claim only
their third victory in the past
eight games.

Oakland sealed the victory
w hen nose tackle Johnny Rob
inson chased Strock out of the
end zone for a safety and Ches
ter Willis sprinted 15 yards for a
touchdown after Miami unsuc
cessfully tried an "on-side
punt" after the safety.
The Dolphins fell to 7-3-1,
with the lets, whom they face at
New York next week, vaulting
into second place in the
Eastern Division at 6-4-1 with a
17-6 win over New England.
Buffalo, a 24-0 loser at St. Louis,
fell into third at 6-5.
Oakland took a 7-0 lead less
than two minutes into the
game when Wilson, a second
year pro from Brigham Young
making his fifth start, fired a 13-
yard scoring pass to Todd
Christensen, four plays after
Christensen recovered when
Miami's Fulton Walker
fumbled the opening kickoff at
the Dolphin 27.
The Raiders hiked their lead
to 14-0 when Wilson con
nected with Bob Chandler on a
37-yard pass play with 9:56 re
maining in the second quarter

and made it 21-0 when Wilson
completed an 11-play, 74-yard
drive with a 1-yard toss to tight
end Derrick Ramsey.
Miami got on the scoreboard
with Uwe von Schamann's 36-
yard field goal just before half
time, but the Dolphin offense
didn't come alive until Strock
replaced David Woodley with
8:28 to go in the third period of

a 24-3 lead.
Eddie Hill ran 5 yards to cap
an 80-yard drive and Strock
threw a 14-yard touchdown
pass to halfback Tony Nathan.
Strock hit four of his first six
passes for 42 yards as the
Dolphins drove from their own
20 in nine plays after Chris
Bahi's 32-yard field goal had
given Oakland a 24-3 lead.

Strock, a ninth-year pro,
then cut the deficit to seven
points with his pass to Nathan,
capping an eight-play, 54-yard
march.
Strock, who hadn't quarter
backed since starting in the
Dolphins' 31-21 loss at Buffalo
Oct. 12, finished the game with
16 completions in 25 attempts
and 169 yards.
San Francisco (AP) — Matt
Bahr, a fill-in kicker for the San
Francisco 49ers early this sea
son, sounded almost
apologetic after beating them
yesterday.
"I can't say enough good
thingsabout the49ers. I madea
lot of friends in my short stay
here. It's good to come back
and say hello," said Bahr,
whose last-minute, 24-yard
field goal gave the Cleveland
Browns a 15-12 victory and
snapped the 49ers' seven-game
winning streak.
Bahr was kicking for the
49ers when that winning streak
began. He was traded to Cleve
land after a four-week stay in
San Francisco.
"We figured the most impor
tant factor would be the kick
ing game," said Browns Coach
Sam Rutigliano, who called on
Bahr with 43 seconds left in the
National Football League game
played on a soggy and treach
erous Candlestick Park field.
Rutigliano noted that the
wet field "made it difficult to
accelerate a pass rush," and the
49ers' detense in the last period

was without star rusher Fred
Dean, sidelined by a bruised
chest.
"The playing field didn't hurt
us any more than it hurt them.
It hurt them in the first three
quarters but it caught up with
us in the end," said 49ers
Coach Bill Walsh.
"We're not disheartened by
the defeat nor terribly de
jected," he added.
The Browns, now 5-6, tied
the score with 6:46 remaining
when Brian Sipe hit Reggie
Rucker on a 21-yard touch
down pass and Bahr added the
extra point. Sipe had com
pleted only nine of 25 passes
before getting hot on the 43-
yard touchdown drive.
A 40-yard punt return by
Dino Hall placed the Browns in
good field position for the start
of the drive leading to Rucker's
touchdown. Before that, the
Cleveland offense had been
past midfield only twice.
A 38-yard pass from Sipe to
Rucker helped set up the win
ning field goal by Bahr, who
handled the 49ers' placekick
ing in four games as a fill-in for

Ray Wersching, who was in

field goals yesterday, three
from 28 yards and one from 29.
