# Cardinal booters blast UCSB, 4-0
## 
### Adam Berns 
Considering all the close soccer games
Stanford has been in lately, it was only fit
ting that the Cardinals end their season
with a bang. Saturday, the Stanford did just
that by exploding offensively in a well
played 4-0 victory over the Santa Barbara
Gauchos.
In this game, credit had to be given to
the Cardinal midfield. It not only domi
nated play in general, but was also key to
the scoring. Freshman Angel Vasquez
spearheaded the midfield attack, scoring a
career high two goals.
From the outset of the game, the
Cardinals consistently put pressureonSan
ta Barbara. In fact, Stanford had several
good scoring opportunities in just the first
few minutes of play.
However, after the initial surge, the
Gauchos started to play their kind of game,
which involves solid defense and a very
physical style of play. Santa Barbara was
also marking Stanford's strikers quite
closely, not givingthem any room in which
to maneuver.
But Vasquez proved that the Cardinal
strikers aren't the only players on the field
who can score. On a fast break, lie drib
bled through two defenders and booted
the ball in the lefthand corner of the goal
for Stanford's first goal.
Following the score, the Cardinals had a
couple of other fast breaks but weren't
able to take advantage of them.
Midway through the fist half, it became
obvious that Stanford was starting to get
bothered by Santa Barbara's physical style
of, play. Stanford felt the referee had
miised several pushing calls on the
Gauchos and that only seemed to get a
couple of Cardinal players hotter. After

Cardinal striker Jorge Titinger received a
yellow card, it looked as if the momentum
of the game was starting to turn in Santa
Barbara's favor.
However, before the Gauchos could
take advantage of the opportunity, Vas
quez quickly broke downfield and shot at
the Santa Barbara goal. The goalie blocked
Vasquez's initial shot, but the midfielder
followed it up to score seconds later. That
goal clearly shifted the game in Stanford's
favor and the half ended with the
Cardinals holding on to a 2-0 lead.
In the second half, Stanford kept up the
pressure. Titinger had two fast breaks
toward the Gaucho goal which came up
just short, and in general, the Cardinals
were setting the pace of the game.
The Gauchos made one of their last legit
it mate rallies following a hand-ball call on
a Stanford defender right outside of the
penalty area. For the next couple of
minutes, Santa Barbara kept the ball deep
in Cardianal territory and came close to
the goal several times. However, the
Gauchos were unable to capitalize on the
opportunity and Stanford soon re-estab
lished its dominance.
A couple of minutes later, Cardinal mid
fielder Walter Kingston took a pass on the
right side of the field, about 20 yards away
from the Santa Barbara goal. He quickly
dribbled towards the middle of the field,
faking-out two defenders, and then
scored, giving Stanford a comfortable 3-0
lead.
Even with the cusion, Stanford was not
content to sit back and take any chances.
Following an excellent save of a Santa
Barbara shot by freshman goalie David
Mann, senior Jim Witham got the ball
downfield and, missing one shot, took an
other to score on his second try. That gave

the Cardinalsa 4-0 lead which they held for
the rest of the afternoon. Witham's goal
was indicative of the great midfield sup
port the Stanford offense received all day
long.
After the match, Cardianal coach Nelson
Lodge was extremely enthused about his
team's performance.
"Everyone really wanted to win this
one," he said. "There is a big difference
between being 12-7 as opposed to 11-8."
Vasquez felt that one of the keys Satur
day was the midfield's ability to score.
"They were marking our striker," Vas
quez explained after the game. "They
weren't really expecting me or the other
midfielders to come through, which we
did effectively today."
Senior striker Willie Guicci, who had an
outstanding season scoring 22 goals, felt
that this win was very important to the
team.
"The players were really psyched up to
day," Guicci said following the victory.
"It's been a great season and we've lost
several close games. I can't think of a more
fitting way to end the season and my col
legiate career."
All in all, the season has been a good one
fortheCardinals. Although they lost sever
al games against lesser teams, they also
pulled off several upsets, including a vic
tory over then No.l ranked Connecticut.
Lodge summed up his impressions of the
year following Saturday's game.
"We had an unbelievably demanding
schedule and we played all of the best
teams close. I think that our team has got to
be recognized as one of the better squads
in the nation. I'm really proud of the way
we played this year and with our youth, I
expect even better things in the years to
come."

take advantage of the opportunity, Vas
quez quickly broke downfield and shot at
the Santa Barbara goal. The goalie blocked
Vasquez's initial shot, but the midfielder
followed it up to score seconds later. That
goal clearly shifted the game in Stanford's
favor and the half ended with the
Cardinals holding on to a 2-0 lead.
In the second half, Stanford kept up the
pressure. Titinger had two fast breaks
toward the Gaucho goal which came up
just short, and in general, the Cardinals
were setting the pace of the game.
The Gauchos made one of their last legit
it mate rallies following a hand-ball call on
a Stanford defender right outside of the
penalty area. For the next couple of
minutes, Santa Barbara kept the ball deep
in Cardianal territory and came close to
the goal several times. However, the
Gauchos were unable to capitalize on the
opportunity and Stanford soon re-estab
lished its dominance.
A couple of minutes later, Cardinal mid
fielder Walter Kingston took a pass on the
right side of the field, about 20 yards away
from the Santa Barbara goal. He quickly
dribbled towards the middle of the field,
faking-out two defenders, and then
scored, giving Stanford a comfortable 3-0
lead.
Even with the cusion, Stanford was not
content to sit back and take any chances.
Following an excellent save of a Santa
Barbara shot by freshman goalie David
Mann, senior Jim Witham got the ball
downfield and, missing one shot, took an
other to score on his second try. That gave

the Cardinalsa 4-0 lead which they held for
the rest of the afternoon. Witham's goal
was indicative of the great midfield sup
port the Stanford offense received all day
long.
After the match, Cardianal coach Nelson
Lodge was extremely enthused about his
team's performance.
"Everyone really wanted to win this
one," he said. "There is a big difference
between being 12-7 as opposed to 11-8."
Vasquez felt that one of the keys Satur
day was the midfield's ability to score.
"They were marking our striker," Vas
quez explained after the game. "They
weren't really expecting me or the other
midfielders to come through, which we
did effectively today."
Senior striker Willie Guicci, who had an
outstanding season scoring 22 goals, felt
that this win was very important to the
team.
"The players were really psyched up to
day," Guicci said following the victory.
"It's been a great season and we've lost
several close games. I can't think of a more
fitting way to end the season and my col
legiate career."
All in all, the season has been a good one
fortheCardinals. Although they lost sever
al games against lesser teams, they also
pulled off several upsets, including a vic
tory over then No.l ranked Connecticut.
Lodge summed up his impressions of the
year following Saturday's game.
"We had an unbelievably demanding
schedule and we played all of the best
teams close. I think that our team has got to
be recognized as one of the better squads
in the nation. I'm really proud of the way
we played this year and with our youth, I
expect even better things in the years to
come."
Considering all the close soccer games
Stanford has been in lately, it was only fit
ting that the Cardinals end their season
with a bang. Saturday, the Stanford did just
that by exploding offensively in a well
played 4-0 victory over the Santa Barbara
Gauchos.
In this game, credit had to be given to
the Cardinal midfield. It not only domi
nated play in general, but was also key to
the scoring. Freshman Angel Vasquez
spearheaded the midfield attack, scoring a
career high two goals.
From the outset of the game, the
Cardinals consistently put pressureonSan
ta Barbara. In fact, Stanford had several
good scoring opportunities in just the first
few minutes of play.
However, after the initial surge, the
Gauchos started to play their kind of game,
which involves solid defense and a very
physical style of play. Santa Barbara was
also marking Stanford's strikers quite
closely, not givingthem any room in which
to maneuver.
But Vasquez proved that the Cardinal
strikers aren't the only players on the field
who can score. On a fast break, lie drib
bled through two defenders and booted
the ball in the lefthand corner of the goal
for Stanford's first goal.
Following the score, the Cardinals had a
couple of other fast breaks but weren't
able to take advantage of them.
Midway through the fist half, it became
obvious that Stanford was starting to get
bothered by Santa Barbara's physical style
of, play. Stanford felt the referee had
miised several pushing calls on the
Gauchos and that only seemed to get a
couple of Cardinal players hotter. After

Cardinal striker Jorge Titinger received a
yellow card, it looked as if the momentum
of the game was starting to turn in Santa
Barbara's favor.
