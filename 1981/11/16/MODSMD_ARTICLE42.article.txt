Irish Protestant MP murdered
Belfast, Northern Ireland — Britain's Secre
tary for Northern Ireland appealed to angry-
Protestants yesterday not to avenge the Irish
Republican Army's assassination of a Protestant
member of Parliament.
The plea by James Prior, top official in the
British-ruled province, came hours after a Cath
olic youth was fatally shot in the head near his
home, in what relatives called a Protestant ven
detta for the Saturday shooting death of Par
liament member Robert Bradford.
"Keep calm," Prior said after conferring with
security chiefs at Stormont Castle, the British
headquarters here. "I beg the people of
Northern Ireland to leave it to the police and
army. Don't take things into your hands."
Bradford, 40, was shot to death by three
masked Irish Republican Army gunmen who
pushed past teen-age dancers at a community
center used by Bradford for meeting his consti
tuents. The gunmen also killed a caretaker. The
IRA later claimed responsibility.
The killings came 12 hours after guerrillas
blew up the unoccupied London home of Brit
ish Attorney General Sir Michael Havers.
Legislator Harold McCusker, another of the
12 members of Parliament from the province,
called yesterday for a provincewide, one-hour
work stoppage during Bradford's funeral
tomorrow.
McCusker blamed the latest wave of IRA at
tacks on London's recent announcement to set
up a council with the Irish Republic for solving
the strife in Northern Ireland.
"Far from wooing the terrorists, it is motivat
ing them," he said in a radio interview. "They
think they are winning."
Hinckley attempts suicide
Washington — john Hinckley jr., awaiting
trial on charges of attempting to assassinate
President Ronald Reagan, tried to hang himself
in a military prison yesterday but was cut down
by U.S. marshals, the Justice Department an
nounced.
Department spokesman Tom DeCair said the
26-year-old Hinckley was taken to the hospital
at Fort Meade, Maryland, where he had been
confined, and was described last night in satis
factory condition. DeCair said Hinckley would
be held at the base hospital overnight for ob
servation.

It was the second time since Hinckley's arrest
March 30 at the site of the attack on the presi
dent in Washington that he has made an ap
parent attempt to harm himself.
On May 27, while jailed in Butner, North Car
olina, Hinckley took an overdose of an aspirin
substituteandwastaken totheprison infirmary.
Unemployment may rise
Washinqton — U.S. unemployment may re
turn to a post-World War II peak of 9 percent
before President Ronald Reagan's policies start
working to produce vigorous economic
growth, the chairman of the President's Council
of Economic Advisers said yesterday.
The official, Murray Weidenbaum, also in
dicated the administration may have to con
sider new tax increases for 1983 and 1984 to limit
swelling budget deficits.
Weidenbaum declared his total confidence
in the Reagan economic program when asked
about the skepticism expressed by budget di
rector David Stockman in a magazine article re
leased last week.
Stockman submitted his resignation to the
president because of those remarks, but Rea
gan decided to keep him on the job after Stock
man expressed total faith in Reagan's program.
Weidenbaum acknowledged yesterday he
held some of the same reservations that Stock
man expressed in the magazine article, which
was based on a series of interviews over the past
11 months.
Weidenbaum, who was interviewed on CBS
network's "Face the Nation," said Reagan's
program "is already working," an apparent ref
erence to a falling inflation rate. But the short
term tradeoff is the current recession and rising
unemployment, he said.
Saudis seek Chinese ties
Beijing — Arch-conservative Saudi Arabia,
which has no diplomatic ties with any com
munist regime, has begun negotiationstoestab
lish formal relations with China, according to
informed Arab diplomats here. But the Saudis'
strong links with Taiwan remain an obstacle.
Although Saudi Arabia only two months ago
reassured Taiwan that it would not break rela
tions to recognize Beijing, Arab diplomats be
lieve that the decision to do so may be made
shortly to secure Chinese support for the
Saudis' Middle East peace plan and to strength

en its overall leadership in the Arab world.
Similar negotiations are reportedly under
way with the Soviet Union, two London news
papers said yesterday, predicting that formal
ties between Moscow and Riyadh would be es
tablished shortly. Arab diplomats here said,
however, that the Saudi royal family has "some
ideological problems" with the Soviet Union
that it does not have with China.
Beijing, uhicn has sought to establish rela
tions with Riyadh over the past fouryears, will, if
it succeeds, have finally persuaded the last Arab
state to switch recognition from the Chinese
Nationalists on Taiwan to the Communist re
gime here.
For Taiwan, the loss of Saudi recognition
vsould be a serious diplomatic blow, leaving the
Nationalist regime with the recognition of only
two major countries, South Korea and South
Africa. Only two months ago, the Saudi am
bassador in Taipei and visiting Saudi officials as
sured the Nationalists that their country would
never recognize any Communist regime.
Farm policy debate continues
Washington — Congressional negotiators are
moving toward a resolution of House-Senate
differences over the nation's farm and food pol
icy for the next four years.
But the compromise they're headed toward
could well be objectionable not only to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, who is trying to keep
farm-support costs down, but also to the full
House, which has formally rejected several of
the programs the conferees have agreed on.
"We're not going in with a tremendous sur
plus of votes," says Rep. Kika de la Garza ID-
Texas) chairman of the House Agriculture Com
mittee and chief House negotiator on the 1981
farm bill.
The House-Senate conference committee is
optimistic that this week will produce a final
compromise between the $16.6 billion House
farm bill and the $10.6 billion Senate version the
president has endorsed.
