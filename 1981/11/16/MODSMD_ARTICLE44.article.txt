ing, according to San Mateo County
police officers,

ty Keith Julien, one of the officers in
vestigating the case, said, "We have
nothing in our investigation to link
the rapes."
Stanford Police Deputy Ron Levine
said, "There does not seem to be any
connection . . . the methods of oper
ation are completely different." San
Mateo police were unwilling to re
lease a description of the alleged

rapist or details of their investigation
until this morning. Police described
the rape only by saying they received
the report at 4:09 a.m. and that it was
associated with the other charges
brought against Sturns.
.Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said the campus police force
was investigating the case but that
"there aren't many similarities" be
tween yesterday's rape and the cam
pus rapes.
He said that campus police "don't
have complete information" but
would continue to search for any
connection between the different
rapes. Police plan a "photo line-up
tomorrow" as part of their ongoing
investigation of the campus rapes.
