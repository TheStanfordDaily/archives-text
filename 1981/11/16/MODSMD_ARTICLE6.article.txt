The space shuttle Columbia landed Saturday at Ed
wards Air Force Base near Mojave, California, after
the shuttle's five-day mission was shortened to two
days and six hours because of the failure of one of the
craft's three fuel cells.
The National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) estimated that more than 200,000 peo
ple watched as Columbia, commanded by Air Force
Col. Joseph Engle and piloted by Navy Captain Rich
ard Truly, glided onto the sandy dry lakebed of the
Dryden Flight Research Center.
Cloudy weather Saturday morning kept the crowd
well below the half-million figure NASA had ori
ginally expected. Only scattered light clouds re
mained when the shuttle touched down that after
noon.
Orange-vested NASA workers directed VIPs, mem
bers of the press and NASA workers' families and
guests to prime viewing spots within the chain link
fence surrounding Dryden's complex of hangars and
offices. In the morning many guests wandered be

tween the gift shop and the restaurant, while most
had not yet arrived.
On the hill behind the center, more NASA workers
directed spectators to other observation points. Park
ing lots were arranged with military precision, with
spaces evenly chalked in the sand. Orange portable
toilets were stationed at regular intervals behind the
parking lots, while 30-foot poles with loudspeakers
on top stood in front 100 yards apart.
At 11:10 a.m., the desert air was cool and windy.
Mission Control in Houston reported the shuttle was
over the Pacific Ocean approaching Hawaii.
From the hill, half a mile from Dryden, the vehicles
comprising the recovery convoy were dimly visible
two miles away through the dust kicked up by winds
gusting between 18 and 24 miles per hour. The vehi
cles included a mobile wind generator. It was not
needed, however.
At 12:15 p.m., a two-man ABC camera crew arrived
on the hill in a yellow vehicle that looked like an over
sized golf cart. A small crowd gathered around the
crew which began filming crowd shots.

The people gathered to see the world's first re
usable spacecraft make its second flight included two
elderly ladies who covered the front of their car with
small American flags, and a teenager from Orange
County wearing an orange cap with yellow horns pro
truding from it who said she had been waiting there
since 2 a.m.
Other spectators were still arriving shortly before 1
p.m. Some sat in lawnchairs trying to get a tari, or at
least a windburn. People set up cameras on tripods in
front of their cars or on top of their campers. Two re
tired couples in a mobile home that had been con
verted from a Greyhound bus watched the shuttle
coverage on TV.
A few people tried to catch up on lost sleep by
crawling into their vehicles and attempting to block
out the sounds of helicopters circling overhead, an
nouncements from the loudspeakers and rock music
from neighboring cars.
At about 12:50 p.m. Mission Control announced
that the shuttle was leaving orbit. The ABC crew got
into its cart and drove off.

The shuttle was then over the Pacific, entering the
atmosphere at 24.6 times the speed of sound. It would
descend over the Pacific from an altitude of 413,000
feet, travel at a velocity of 12,300 feet per second at an
altitude of 173,000 feet when it was 500 miles away,
and cross the California coast near Big Sur, slowing to
6400 feet per second, Mission Control announced.
The shuttle would fly over the viewing area, turn
over the town of Boron on the other side of Edwards,
and head back toward Dryden, landing on the
lakebed.
Spectators began to leave their tailgating parties
and to adjust their cameras.
Updates on the shuttle's position came every
minute. The shuttle was6so miles away, then 542 miles
away and 153,000 feet high.
Onlookers began moving t*. their preferred view
ing positions while Columbia began a long S curve
over Monterrey, gradually dropping in speed from
6 V 2 to four times the speed of sound near Bak^rsfield.
