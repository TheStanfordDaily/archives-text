The space shuttle Columbia landed Saturday at Ed
wards Air Force Base near Mojave, California, after
the shuttle's five-day mission was shortened to two
days and six hours because of the failure of one of the
craft's three fuel cells.
The National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) estimated that more than 200,000 peo
ple watched as Columbia, commanded by Air Force
Col. Joseph Engle and piloted by Navy Captain Rich
ard Truly, glided onto the sandy dry lakebed of the
Dryden Flight Research Center.
Cloudy weather Saturday morning kept the crowd
well below the half-million figure NASA had ori
ginally expected. Only scattered light clouds re
mained when the shuttle touched down that after
noon.
Orange-vested NASA workers directed VIPs, mem
bers of the press and NASA workers' families and
guests to prime viewing spots within the chain link
fence surrounding Dryden's complex of hangars and
offices. In the morning many guests wandered be

tween the gift shop and the restaurant, while most
had not yet arrived.
On the hill behind the center, more NASA workers
directed spectators to other observation points. Park
ing lots were arranged with military precision, with
spaces evenly chalked in the sand. Orange portable
toilets were stationed at regular intervals behind the
parking lots, while 30-foot poles with loudspeakers
on top stood in front 100 yards apart.
At 11:10 a.m., the desert air was cool and windy.
Mission Control in Houston reported the shuttle was
over the Pacific Ocean approaching Hawaii.
From the hill, half a mile from Dryden, the vehicles
comprising the recovery convoy were dimly visible
two miles away through the dust kicked up by winds
gusting between 18 and 24 miles per hour. The vehi
cles included a mobile wind generator. It was not
needed, however.
At 12:15 p.m., a two-man ABC camera crew arrived
on the hill in a yellow vehicle that looked like an over
sized golf cart. A small crowd gathered around the
crew which began filming crowd shots.

The people gathered to see the world's first re
usable spacecraft make its second flight included two
elderly ladies who covered the front of their car with
small American flags, and a teenager from Orange
County wearing an orange cap with yellow horns pro
truding from it who said she had been waiting there
since 2 a.m.
Other spectators were still arriving shortly before 1
p.m. Some sat in lawnchairs trying to get a tari, or at
least a windburn. People set up cameras on tripods in
front of their cars or on top of their campers. Two re
tired couples in a mobile home that had been con
verted from a Greyhound bus watched the shuttle
coverage on TV.
A few people tried to catch up on lost sleep by
crawling into their vehicles and attempting to block
out the sounds of helicopters circling overhead, an
nouncements from the loudspeakers and rock music
from neighboring cars.
At about 12:50 p.m. Mission Control announced
that the shuttle was leaving orbit. The ABC crew got
into its cart and drove off.

The shuttle was then over the Pacific, entering the
atmosphere at 24.6 times the speed of sound. It would
descend over the Pacific from an altitude of 413,000
feet, travel at a velocity of 12,300 feet per second at an
altitude of 173,000 feet when it was 500 miles away,
and cross the California coast near Big Sur, slowing to
6400 feet per second, Mission Control announced.
The shuttle would fly over the viewing area, turn
over the town of Boron on the other side of Edwards,
and head back toward Dryden, landing on the
lakebed.
Spectators began to leave their tailgating parties
and to adjust their cameras.
Updates on the shuttle's position came every
minute. The shuttle was6so miles away, then 542 miles
away and 153,000 feet high.
Onlookers began moving t*. their preferred view
ing positions while Columbia began a long S curve
over Monterrey, gradually dropping in speed from
6 V 2 to four times the speed of sound near Bak^rsfield.

Joseph Engle and Richard Truly sleered the craft to a perfect landing at
Edwards Air Force Base near Mojave after its plannen five-day mission
was shortened to slightly more than two.

Mission Control said the shuttle was nine minutes
from landing, 148 miles away.
Then it was 125 miles awav, then 74 miles and at an
altitude of 90,000 feet.
People scanned the horizon, debating where it would
appear.
Columbia made its appearance not on the horizon,
but directly overhead at 40,000 feet. One could see its
broken white trail, streaks that looked like tracer bullets
in a World War II movie as they crossed the sky. The shut
tle disappeared in a cloud as it turned around Boron,
leaving its trail looking like the dotted white passing lane
markers on a highway.
As Columbia passed overhead at 1.2 times the speed of
sound, it emitted two sonic booms in rapid succession
which sounded like fireworks. The crowd applauded.
A few seconds passed; the shuttle reappeared at 18,000
feet. It was black from burning in re-entry. It glided
toward the lakebed at 200 miles per hour as Mission Con

trol counted down the seconds until touchdown.
The shuttle landed smoothly and stopped more than a
mile away from Dryden. The recovery convoy sped
across the lakebed as the crowd applauded. The mission
had lasted two days, six hours, 13 minutes and 10 sec
onds.
The three T-38 chase planes which escorted the shuttle
on its last maneuver flew past in close formation.
People on the hill described the landing as "very im
pressive." Some rushed immediately to their cars to beat
the traffic they expected to meet on the way back to Los
Angeles. Others walked down to the Dryden complex.
At Dryden, there were more veteran observers. Mary
anne Wymore, from neighboring Lancaster, saw the
shuttle land the first time and said the crowd this time
was not as vocal as it was then. She also said the view was
not as good this time.
Many spectators left Dryden while others waited for
Engle and Truly to leave the shuttle. At that time, re
covery crews were still working around the outside of
the shuttle.

anne Wymore, from neighboring Lancaster, saw the
shuttle land the first time and said the crowd this time
was not as vocal as it was then. She also said the view was
not as good this time.
Many spectators left Dryden while others waited for
Engle and Truly to leave the shuttle. At that time, re
covery crews were still working around the outside of
the shuttle.
The space shuttle Columbia landed Saturday at Ed
wards Air Force Base near Mojave, California, after
the shuttle's five-day mission was shortened to two
days and six hours because of the failure of one of the
craft's three fuel cells.
The National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) estimated that more than 200,000 peo
ple watched as Columbia, commanded by Air Force
Col. Joseph Engle and piloted by Navy Captain Rich
ard Truly, glided onto the sandy dry lakebed of the
Dryden Flight Research Center.
Cloudy weather Saturday morning kept the crowd
well below the half-million figure NASA had ori
ginally expected. Only scattered light clouds re
mained when the shuttle touched down that after
noon.
Orange-vested NASA workers directed VIPs, mem
bers of the press and NASA workers' families and
guests to prime viewing spots within the chain link
fence surrounding Dryden's complex of hangars and
offices. In the morning many guests wandered be

tween the gift shop and the restaurant, while most
had not yet arrived.
On the hill behind the center, more NASA workers
directed spectators to other observation points. Park
ing lots were arranged with military precision, with
spaces evenly chalked in the sand. Orange portable
toilets were stationed at regular intervals behind the
parking lots, while 30-foot poles with loudspeakers
on top stood in front 100 yards apart.
At 11:10 a.m., the desert air was cool and windy.
Mission Control in Houston reported the shuttle was
over the Pacific Ocean approaching Hawaii.
From the hill, half a mile from Dryden, the vehicles
comprising the recovery convoy were dimly visible
two miles away through the dust kicked up by winds
gusting between 18 and 24 miles per hour. The vehi
cles included a mobile wind generator. It was not
needed, however.
At 12:15 p.m., a two-man ABC camera crew arrived
on the hill in a yellow vehicle that looked like an over
sized golf cart. A small crowd gathered around the
crew which began filming crowd shots.

The people gathered to see the world's first re
usable spacecraft make its second flight included two
elderly ladies who covered the front of their car with
small American flags, and a teenager from Orange
County wearing an orange cap with yellow horns pro
truding from it who said she had been waiting there
since 2 a.m.
Other spectators were still arriving shortly before 1
p.m. Some sat in lawnchairs trying to get a tari, or at
least a windburn. People set up cameras on tripods in
front of their cars or on top of their campers. Two re
tired couples in a mobile home that had been con
verted from a Greyhound bus watched the shuttle
coverage on TV.
A few people tried to catch up on lost sleep by
crawling into their vehicles and attempting to block
out the sounds of helicopters circling overhead, an
nouncements from the loudspeakers and rock music
from neighboring cars.
At about 12:50 p.m. Mission Control announced
that the shuttle was leaving orbit. The ABC crew got
into its cart and drove off.

The shuttle was then over the Pacific, entering the
atmosphere at 24.6 times the speed of sound. It would
descend over the Pacific from an altitude of 413,000
feet, travel at a velocity of 12,300 feet per second at an
altitude of 173,000 feet when it was 500 miles away,
and cross the California coast near Big Sur, slowing to
6400 feet per second, Mission Control announced.
The shuttle would fly over the viewing area, turn
over the town of Boron on the other side of Edwards,
and head back toward Dryden, landing on the
lakebed.
Spectators began to leave their tailgating parties
and to adjust their cameras.
Updates on the shuttle's position came every
minute. The shuttle was6so miles away, then 542 miles
away and 153,000 feet high.
Onlookers began moving t*. their preferred view
ing positions while Columbia began a long S curve
over Monterrey, gradually dropping in speed from
6 V 2 to four times the speed of sound near Bak^rsfield.

Joseph Engle and Richard Truly sleered the craft to a perfect landing at
Edwards Air Force Base near Mojave after its plannen five-day mission
was shortened to slightly more than two.

Mission Control said the shuttle was nine minutes
from landing, 148 miles away.
Then it was 125 miles awav, then 74 miles and at an
altitude of 90,000 feet.
People scanned the horizon, debating where it would
appear.
Columbia made its appearance not on the horizon,
but directly overhead at 40,000 feet. One could see its
broken white trail, streaks that looked like tracer bullets
in a World War II movie as they crossed the sky. The shut
tle disappeared in a cloud as it turned around Boron,
leaving its trail looking like the dotted white passing lane
markers on a highway.
As Columbia passed overhead at 1.2 times the speed of
sound, it emitted two sonic booms in rapid succession
which sounded like fireworks. The crowd applauded.
A few seconds passed; the shuttle reappeared at 18,000
feet. It was black from burning in re-entry. It glided
toward the lakebed at 200 miles per hour as Mission Con

trol counted down the seconds until touchdown.
The shuttle landed smoothly and stopped more than a
mile away from Dryden. The recovery convoy sped
across the lakebed as the crowd applauded. The mission
had lasted two days, six hours, 13 minutes and 10 sec
onds.
The three T-38 chase planes which escorted the shuttle
on its last maneuver flew past in close formation.
People on the hill described the landing as "very im
pressive." Some rushed immediately to their cars to beat
the traffic they expected to meet on the way back to Los
Angeles. Others walked down to the Dryden complex.
