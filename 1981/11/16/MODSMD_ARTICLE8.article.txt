# Brazil moving into world of arms sellers, rapidly

Sao )ose dos Campos, Rrazil
— In more than 50 countries of
the world, on nearly every con
tinent, soldiers are riding,
tlying or firing weapons bear
ing the legend "Made in Bra
zil."
Over the past 10 years, Brazil
has become the world's fifth
largest manufacturer of weap
ons.
Brazil is no challenger to the
United States and the Soviet
Union — who sold a combined
total of $32 billion in arms in
1980 — but it is moving fast.
It is projected that Brazil's
arms sales will total about $1.5
billion this year, and some of
ficials expect to more than tri
ple that figure by 1986. This is
no small sum for a country with
a trade deficit of nearly $3
billion and a desperate need
for hard currency.
Brazil's entry into the arms
market was motivated by two
intertwined factors. Until 10
years ago, the country's mili
tary was totally dependent on
the United States for weapons
and training.
Leaders of the military gov
ernment decided that this was
unhealthy, particularly be
cause Washington seemed in
creasingly to use the arms sup
ply line to pressure Brazil on in
ternational political and mili

tary issues.
The Brazilians' uneasiness in
creased during the adminis
tration of former President Jim
my Carter, who reduced arms
supplies as part of his drive to
force Brazil to improve its hu
man rights record.
Fnded U.S. contracts
Threeyearsago, Brazil termi
nated its U.S. arms supply con
tracts and has been on its own
ever since. Now, all but the air
force is equipped wholly with
Brazilian weapons, and the air
force is 60 percent Brazilian.
Brazilian arms factories pour
out a great variety of weapons
— planes, rockets, bombs,
flame throwers — but it is the
armored car, manufactured by
the Engesa company, that is the
showpiece.
This and other Engesa vehi
cles come with a five-year —
sometimes a 10-year — supply
of spare parts, an important
factor because some manufac
turing nations have been
known to cut off spare parts for
political reasons.
Libya used Engesa armored
cars in its 1977 border war with
Egypt and claimed great suc
cess against Soviet-built vehi
cles. Libya also used them with
success last year in its invasion
of neighboring Chad.
Selling for about $500,000
each, these armored cars have

made Engesa the world's larg
est maker of wheeled combat
vehicles.
Government regulations
prohibit Engesa officials from
disclosing their clients, but it is
known that the company sold
$150 million worth of vehicles
last year to 38 countries.
U.S. now buying
Even the United States is
buying from Engesa. The U.S.
Rapid Deployment Force will
be equipped with a special ver
sion of the Urutu. Engesa also is
selling technology to the Unit
ed States. And an Engesa team
just returned from China.
Although Engesa's cus
tomers include such advanced
nations as the United States,
the firm's main market is the
Third World, those nations
without the money and tech
nological base to build weap
ons.
Already the sixth-largest
maker of general aircraft in the
world, the Brazilian firm Em
braer turns out more than 400
planes a year, ranging from jet
warplanes to cropdusters.
Embraer sells $100 million
worth of planes a year, an in
crease of 2000 percent since
1976. Besides the 19-passenger
Bandeirante, it makes the
Xingu jet trainer and the
Xavante jet fighter. France re
cently ordered 41 Xingus.
A Brazilian company called
Avibras, working for 20 years
with the Brazilian space pro
gram, has developed a series of
rockets with enormous military
potential, ranging from anti
tank weapons to the space
flying Sonda-4.
Avibras also produces:
napalm bombs, 500-pound
bombs designed to dig craters
in airfields and anti-personnel
rockets. The last of these, an
advanced version of an Ameri
can-designed rocket used in
Vietnam, is a two-foot-long
missile crammed with 1700
steel darts.

Over the past 10 years, Brazil
has become the world's fifth
largest manufacturer of weap
ons.
Brazil is no challenger to the
United States and the Soviet
Union — who sold a combined
total of $32 billion in arms in
1980 — but it is moving fast.
It is projected that Brazil's
arms sales will total about $1.5
billion this year, and some of
ficials expect to more than tri
ple that figure by 1986. This is
no small sum for a country with
a trade deficit of nearly $3
billion and a desperate need
for hard currency.
Brazil's entry into the arms
market was motivated by two
intertwined factors. Until 10
years ago, the country's mili
tary was totally dependent on
the United States for weapons
and training.
Leaders of the military gov
ernment decided that this was
unhealthy, particularly be
cause Washington seemed in
creasingly to use the arms sup
ply line to pressure Brazil on in
ternational political and mili

tary issues.
The Brazilians' uneasiness in
creased during the adminis
tration of former President Jim
my Carter, who reduced arms
supplies as part of his drive to
force Brazil to improve its hu
man rights record.
Fnded U.S. contracts
Threeyearsago, Brazil termi
nated its U.S. arms supply con
tracts and has been on its own
ever since. Now, all but the air
force is equipped wholly with
Brazilian weapons, and the air
force is 60 percent Brazilian.
Brazilian arms factories pour
out a great variety of weapons
— planes, rockets, bombs,
flame throwers — but it is the
armored car, manufactured by
the Engesa company, that is the
showpiece.
This and other Engesa vehi
cles come with a five-year —
sometimes a 10-year — supply
of spare parts, an important
factor because some manufac
turing nations have been
known to cut off spare parts for
political reasons.
Libya used Engesa armored
cars in its 1977 border war with
Egypt and claimed great suc
cess against Soviet-built vehi
cles. Libya also used them with
success last year in its invasion
of neighboring Chad.
Selling for about $500,000
each, these armored cars have

made Engesa the world's larg
est maker of wheeled combat
vehicles.
Government regulations
prohibit Engesa officials from
disclosing their clients, but it is
known that the company sold
$150 million worth of vehicles
last year to 38 countries.
U.S. now buying
Even the United States is
buying from Engesa. The U.S.
Rapid Deployment Force will
be equipped with a special ver
sion of the Urutu. Engesa also is
selling technology to the Unit
ed States. And an Engesa team
just returned from China.
Although Engesa's cus
tomers include such advanced
nations as the United States,
the firm's main market is the
Third World, those nations
without the money and tech
nological base to build weap
ons.
Already the sixth-largest
maker of general aircraft in the
world, the Brazilian firm Em
braer turns out more than 400
planes a year, ranging from jet
warplanes to cropdusters.
Embraer sells $100 million
worth of planes a year, an in
crease of 2000 percent since
1976. Besides the 19-passenger
Bandeirante, it makes the
Xingu jet trainer and the
Xavante jet fighter. France re
cently ordered 41 Xingus.
A Brazilian company called
Avibras, working for 20 years
with the Brazilian space pro
gram, has developed a series of
rockets with enormous military
potential, ranging from anti
tank weapons to the space
flying Sonda-4.
Avibras also produces:
napalm bombs, 500-pound
bombs designed to dig craters
in airfields and anti-personnel
rockets. The last of these, an
advanced version of an Ameri
can-designed rocket used in
Vietnam, is a two-foot-long
missile crammed with 1700
steel darts.
