## Poland and Hungary, in debt to West, join IMF, marking shift in Soviet policy 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — The decision of Poland and Hun
gary to seek membership in the Interna
tonal Monetary Fund (IMF) —with all that
this implies in terms of Western economic
orientation and capitalist desciplines —is
seen in Western Europe as something of a
turning point in East-West economic rela
tions.
"They are having to bow to the econom
ic realities of their own situation, and how
the world operates, and they can only have
made this decision with the consent of the
Soviet Union," a high official of the Or
ganization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said.
The Soviet go-ahead has been a reluc
tant one, reversing a policy that dates back
to the Soviet refusal to allow the Eastern
bloc nation to accept the Marshall Plan.
The goal was to keep the countries of
Eastern Europe as economically isolated as
possible from the West. "But it simply isn't
working any longer, and much worse lies
immediately ahead in Eastern Europe, as
far as we can see," the OECD official said.
Western bankers, who have been wrestl
ing for nearly two years with the problem
of rescheduling about $16 billion in com
mercial loans to Poland, are breathing a
collective sigh of relief over the long
awaited decision.
Membership rules
As members of the IMF, Poland and
Hungary will have to accept certain rules
and disciplines and make available basic

economic data that neither banks nor gov
ernments were given in the free-lending,
easy-credit heyday of the 19705.
Now there will be something of an IMF
"credit rating" on Poland and Hungary on
v\ hich banks and governments will be able
to base decisions.
Moreover, the IMF itself will be a poten
tial source of additional credit for Poland
— but only with fairly stiff rulesof econom
ic behavior that neither Western banks nor
governments could hitherto impose.
Under IMF rules, when a country joins it
must pay a kind of membership fee in
dollars or some other hard currency. It is
then qualified to apply for an IMF loan of
up to four times that amount. Although in
terest rates on these loans are usually min
imal, the IMF customarily attaches fairly
stringent conditions, requiring the bor
rowing countries to pursue certain eco
nomic policies.
These conditions restrict what the bor
rower can do in terms of taxing, public
spending, importing and the like — dis
ciplines that often run counter to Com
munist aims or planning. It also means that
the borrower has to submit practically the
entire national economy to a kind of audit
by experienced IMF officials.
Join Romania
Romania has been up to now the only
Eastern bloc member of the IMF, being the
most independent of the Eastern bloc
countries in terms of foreign policy. But,

now sliding into deep economic dif
ficulties along with the rest of the bloc, Ro
mania recently negotiated a $1 billion loan
from the IMF on conditions that it adopt an
economic stabilization program worked
out in conjunction with an IMF team of ex
perts.
Yugoslavia joined the IMF back in the
19505, after President josip Broz Tito's
break with Josef Stalin, and has been a reg
ular recipient of IMF funding and loans
from the IMF's sister organization, the
World Bank.
With Hungary and Poland joining, this
will leave only East Germany, Czechoslo
vakia and Bulgaria outside the IMF, along
with the Soviet Union itself. OECD officials
forecast that the other countries of the
Eastern bloc will soon encounter the same
credit problems as Poland and Romania,
and that sooner or later they too will seek
IMF membership.
According to the latest OECD compila
tion, the total Eastern European indebted
ness to the West, including the Soviet
Union, stands at slightly more than $76
billion, broken down as follows: Poland,
$26 billion; the Soviet Union, $10.7 billion;
East Germany, $9.6 billion; Romania, $8.4
billion; Hungary, $8.2 billion; Bulgaria,
$3.9 billion, Czechoslovakia, $3.8 billion;
plus an additional $5.5 billion in multi-na
tional borrowings in Eastern Europe.
OECD officials said that, actually, these
figures are already out of date and the total
is now probably around $80 billion.

East Germany, $9.6 billion; Romania, $8.4
billion; Hungary, $8.2 billion; Bulgaria,
$3.9 billion, Czechoslovakia, $3.8 billion;

Paris — The decision of Poland and Hun
gary to seek membership in the Interna
tonal Monetary Fund (IMF) —with all that
this implies in terms of Western economic
orientation and capitalist desciplines —is
seen in Western Europe as something of a
turning point in East-West economic rela
tions.
"They are having to bow to the econom
ic realities of their own situation, and how
the world operates, and they can only have
made this decision with the consent of the
Soviet Union," a high official of the Or
ganization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said.
The Soviet go-ahead has been a reluc
tant one, reversing a policy that dates back
to the Soviet refusal to allow the Eastern
bloc nation to accept the Marshall Plan.
The goal was to keep the countries of
Eastern Europe as economically isolated as
possible from the West. "But it simply isn't
working any longer, and much worse lies
immediately ahead in Eastern Europe, as
far as we can see," the OECD official said.
Western bankers, who have been wrestl
ing for nearly two years with the problem
of rescheduling about $16 billion in com
mercial loans to Poland, are breathing a
collective sigh of relief over the long
awaited decision.
Membership rules
As members of the IMF, Poland and
Hungary will have to accept certain rules
and disciplines and make available basic

economic data that neither banks nor gov
ernments were given in the free-lending,
easy-credit heyday of the 19705.
Now there will be something of an IMF
"credit rating" on Poland and Hungary on
v\ hich banks and governments will be able
to base decisions.
Moreover, the IMF itself will be a poten
tial source of additional credit for Poland
— but only with fairly stiff rulesof econom
ic behavior that neither Western banks nor
governments could hitherto impose.
Under IMF rules, when a country joins it
must pay a kind of membership fee in
dollars or some other hard currency. It is
then qualified to apply for an IMF loan of
up to four times that amount. Although in
terest rates on these loans are usually min
imal, the IMF customarily attaches fairly
stringent conditions, requiring the bor
rowing countries to pursue certain eco
nomic policies.
These conditions restrict what the bor
rower can do in terms of taxing, public
spending, importing and the like — dis
ciplines that often run counter to Com
munist aims or planning. It also means that
the borrower has to submit practically the
entire national economy to a kind of audit
by experienced IMF officials.
Join Romania
Romania has been up to now the only
Eastern bloc member of the IMF, being the
most independent of the Eastern bloc
countries in terms of foreign policy. But,

now sliding into deep economic dif
ficulties along with the rest of the bloc, Ro
mania recently negotiated a $1 billion loan
from the IMF on conditions that it adopt an
economic stabilization program worked
out in conjunction with an IMF team of ex
perts.
