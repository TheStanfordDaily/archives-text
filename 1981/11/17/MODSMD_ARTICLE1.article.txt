## Police call misplaced one hour before rape 
### Julie Kaufmann 
The Stanford police failed to re
spond to a student's report that
she had been accosted by a man
fitting the description of the man
believed to be the "campus
rapist" an hour before another
woman jogging by the stadium
was raped Nov. 5, the Daily has
learned. k
The Stanford junior was bicy
cling along Galvez on her way
back from Town and Country
Shopping Center at about 9:15
a.m. a man wearing only
light or blue jogging shorts
exposed himself to her, chased
her briefly, and ran away, she said.
"I got home about 9:30 and
called the police. A woman an
swered, she got a description and
my name and phone number. She
said, 'We'll check it out.' After I
was done, she read it back to me,"
the student told the Daily last
night.
The police said that they have
no record of the call to their busi
ness office.
"I'm not saying that she didn't

call," Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said yesterday. However,
he added "as far as we can tell the
message never got to the officers
. . . the only thing I can guess is
that the message was lost or some
thing."
Although another cyclist re
ported the next day an attack
which occurred 20 minutes before
the rape, Herrington said that the
police knew nothing of the earlier
attack. "I'd like to talk to her,"
Herrington said. "She may really
be able to help us."
Stanford police yesterday re
leased composite drawings of the
"campus rapist" based on in
terviewswith twoof thesixvictims
of attacks since October. The two
drawings are similar, and may be
of the same person. "It looks like
the same guy," a police officer
told reporters yesterday, "but we
try not to contaminate the
sketches" by combining victims'
descriptions.
"It could be him," said the jun
ior last night as she examined the
drawings in her campus resi
dence. "His face was scraggly, he
might've had more of a square jaw
and he looked older than 18, like
he was in his 205," she said.
The "campus rapist" is believed
to be a black male, 18 to 20 years
old, muscular, about 5 feet 10 in
ches tall with a short, afro-style
haircut.
"I didn't want to call at first, but
my roommate said call, so I did.
After I called I felt much better,"
the junior said- "Then the next day
when I read about the rape I felt
nauseous because I thought, 'It
could've happened to me.' I knew
it was the same person."
The junior said she was disap
pointed that the police had no
record of her call. "Knowing that
the police lost my message makes
