# New law aimed to thwart moped theft
## 
### Cedric Harris 
A new mode of transportation is
sweeping the campus, leaving walkers
with yet another vehicle from which to
dodge. The phantom: motorized bi
cycles (mopeds).
Mopeds have become increasingly
popular over the last two years, primari
ly because they are often more conve
nient than a bicycle, less expensive than
a motorcycle, and get outstanding
mileage.
According to local moped stores,
moped sales have been steadily increas
ing, with the average cost of a new
moped presently around $600. Mopeds
Only Inc. in Mountain View said it sells

an average of 600 mopeds a year and at
tributed 15 percent of its sales to Stan
ford students.
With sales rising, moped theft is also
rising. For this reason, a law aimed at
protecting the vehicle owner from the
possibility of theft was recently passed
in the state Senate, taking effect July 1 of
this year.
The bill requires that all mopeds sold
on or after that date be issued and dis
play a license plate. It also requires that
the owner carry an I.D. card issued by
the Department of Motor Vehicles
(DMV) in order to operate the vehicle
on a highway.
The owner has five days to register his

vehicle from the date of sale. He may
register it at a local DMV for a fee of $5
upon presentation of a California
learner's permit or driver's license. A
citation is issued for failure to register.
The bill also requires that mopeds
sold before July 1 be licensed by Jan. 1,
1982. Those already licensed on July 1,
1981, are permitted to operate until July
1, 1982.
Transferring, but not renewing, of
identification, is permitted under the
new bill.
As an added service, the DMV will es
tablish a record system that provides for
identification of stolen mopeds.
