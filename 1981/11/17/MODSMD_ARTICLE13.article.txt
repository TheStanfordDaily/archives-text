## Editorial Retain alcohol policy 
### 
Concern about alcohol abuse on campus has
increased dramatically in recent weeks — and
not without cause. The tragic death of two
students in an automobile accident, and other
alcohol-related incidents here, have provoked
many in the Stanford community to question
the attitudesand policiesthat govern the
student use of alcohol.
It isclearthatthereisa problem. But its
solution is not so obvious.
Many have suggested that the University
ought to implement stricter policies governing
alcohol use in an effort to reduce its abuse.
Director of Housing and Food Services
Edward Scoles, in a letter to the Daily last week,
commented that the roots of the problem "lie in
the University's liquor policy, which . . . makes
each person 'responsible for his own actions.' "
He went on to say that a "call for collective
responsibility to show caring and love for one
another" is lacking in Stanford's policy.
Others have also criticized University policy
and have implied that Stanford could institute
such "collective responsibility" by instituting
restrictions on alcohol.
While the intent of such ideas is good, the
consequences of their realization would hinder
one of the most important educational ideals of
the university; more, it really would not do what
Scoles suggests it could — teach responsibility.
Stanford students are supposed to be learning
how to become adults and the University, acting
too much as in loco parentis, could only delay
the painful lessons of responsibility. We can
hardly learn responsibility, though, when we are

not given the freedom to regulate our own
behavior.
Alcohol is available to virtually anybody on
campus, and strong social pressure to use it will
continue. Restrictions on alcohol beyond those
already in place will only serve to delay this
maturing process, and in any event run contrary
to the adult environment which Stanford tries to
promote in other aspects of campus life.
This is not to say that nothing can be done
about a serious problem.
What the University can do, and what many
here strive to do already, is to allow the ways in
which we learn about alcohol use — and other
kindsof behavior — to occur in safe
environments. This is certainly a goal of the
residence system. Education about alcohol has
been part of the resident adviser (R. A.) training
program in recent years, and we strongly
encourage that this be continued. The
University should continue to educate students
on the dangers of alcohol overuse and to
promote alternatives to it in thesocial
environment. Anything that can be done to
encourage students not to mix drinking and
driving, and to discourage their fellow students
from doing the same, is worthwhile.
We again do not mean to suggest that alcohol
is an evil monster which cannot be controlled,
or that constructive ways of dealing with it
should be discouraged. Unfortunately,
however, human qualities such as responsibility
and self-control cannot always be taught by
regulation, and in dealing with the alcohol
problem, we must face up to that fact.
