## Mothers-to-be need protection too 
### 
Michael Olvera (Daily, Nov. 10), as
is typical of right-to-lifers, attempts
to simplify a complex issue by ignor
ing a glaring contradiction in the
logic behind proposed anti-abortion
laws. Stated simply, the laws, and all
reasonable human beings, make ex
ceptions and allow some abortion
under some circumstances, belying
their insistence that the underlying
principle of their laws is the constitu
tional right of the fetus to life.
The exceptions usually start with
cases in which the mother's life is se
riously endangered. What I would
like to know is: what underlying
principle do these people use to de
cide which life to save, if they are en
titled to equal protection under the
law? Is it perchance the principle that
a person who is already born is solely
responsible for their own life, and
therefore can make a choice to save
it, while an unborn is inherently in
capable of such a choice? Doesn't it
then followthat the life of a born per
son is different in its inalienable
rights than an unborn one?
The exceptions continue. I cannot
imagine Olvera forcing his raped and
battered wife to bear the child that
resulted from her ordeal while issu
ing "poetics" (his term) on the beau
ty of life. Would carrying the child of
a rapist to term be a beautiful ex
perience? Yet, under the basic prin
ciple of right-to-life, that child is no
less entitled to protection. It didn't
commit rape. Anothercase in point is
one mentioned in a recent Ann

Landers' column, i.e., the case of a
12-year-old girl who was gang-raped,
contracted venereal disease and be
came pregnant. Her right-to-lifer
mother tried to forbid her abortion
because of her religious beliefs.
However, the judge allowed the
abortion. Will you have a 12-year-old
daughter someday? Will you prolong
a hideous nightmare of hers for a
minimum of nine months? But, your
grandchild, who might be unadop
table depending on the type of per
son the father is, would be innocent.
Would you also force a child of 12 to
give birth if the pregnancy resulted
from incest or naive experimenta
tion? Giving birth at 12 is not only un
healthy, but traumatic beyond
words.
Would you make an exception for
a woman who already has more chil
dren than she can care for or sup
port? Consider her decision. She
loves the children that she has; giving
birth to another one at least makes
their lives more difficult, and risks
making them orphans. It taxes her
strength, damages her health and
risks her life. I say it is her decision.
The alternative is unpleasant and
painful, but not so permanent and
detrimental to her life â€” and I'm
afraid one's own life does come first.
There are those who characterize
women that have abortions as uncar
ing, unfeeling, cold-blooded
murderers. Yet, I have never met a
woman who had an abortion who
didn't find it an extremely emotional

ly painful experience. And, if one did
take abortion lightly, would you real
ly want that woman to be a parent?
Aren't there already too many bat
tered, abused and neglected chil
dren around? You want to compel
unfeeling, uncaring, cold-blooded
murderers to bear more children?
Your argument is full of holes.

Changes incorrect
There are two typographical errors
in my letter (Daily, Nov. 12). One is
insignificant, the other simply ren
ders the entire letter useless.
In the sixth paragraph I said that
the 800 children "would not have
been born without the Tay-Sachs de
tection system and the abortion op
tion." It was changed to read "the
pregnancies would not have been
carried to term without the Tay-Sachs
detection system and the security of
the abortion option." Not the same
thing at all. Besides being completely
incorrect, it destroys the whole point
of the letter.
In the fourth paragraph I referred
to Olvera's "idea of morality." Some
one changed it to "mortality." Not
the same thing either.
