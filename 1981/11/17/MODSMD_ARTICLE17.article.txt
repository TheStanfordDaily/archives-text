## Politics doesn't value candor 
### 
The uproar last week over Budget
Director David Stockman's com
ments in The Atlantic Monthly on
President Ronald Reagan's economic
program raises once again the classic
question: can honesty and politics
mix? I don't mean to imply that there
is any blatant dishonesty in the cur
rent administration, nor that Reagan
has deliberately tried to mislead
Congress or the American people, as
has been claimed.
Stockman's comments relate most
ly to his personal qualms and hesita
tions over the budget, not Reagan's
own. The issue, rather, is Stockman's
right/duty/indiscretion in making
these reservations publicly known.
The nature of politics is such that in
order to rally Congress to his cause,
the president must project an image
of himself as an all-knowing visionary
who will lead us all to Utopia. He and
his advisers must act as a unified team
with no internal dissent and must
profess total unqualified confidence
in the efficacy of their programs.
Critics will do a more than adequate
job of pointing out any weaknesses.
Any admissions of fallibility tend to
be exploited by opponents, with the
press more than willing to help.
Probably the most politically em
barrassing aspect of the Stockman af
fair is the fact that his comments are a
candid admission of the uncertainty
and guesswork underlying the budg
etary process. He is quoted as saying
that "we didn't know where we were
ending up for sure" regarding the
deficit, and that "the whole thing
(the theory of supply-side econom
ics) is premised on faith."
Yet uncertainty is nothing new in
economics. No one understands the
workings of the economy nor the ef
fects of a given strategy â€” if we did,
we would have the problems of infla
tion, unemployment and high in
terest rates solved by now.

Furthermore, to date there has been
no large scale application of supply
side economics to public policy.
Consequently, there is no historical
evidence on which to base claims of
its validity. Any new approach de
mands a measure of "faith." This is
neither an argument for nor against
the use of new theories. The problem
lies in the over-optimistic projections
of success which are needed to sell a
new approach, especially when this
success is assumed in the construc
tion of the program itself.
One must keep in mind that Stock
man did not suddenly decide to
voice his opinions on the subject.
The quotes published were taken
from a series of "off the record" in
terviews over a period of more than a
year with William Greider, the author

of the article and an editor of The
Washington Post. When taken to
gether out of context, they probably
sound much more extreme than they
did at the time. Stockman, has, how
ever, publicly voiced several of his
disagreements with the rest of the
White House staff over questions of
military spending, tax cuts and the
budget deficit, though not in such
strong terms.
Though I agree with Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kansas) that Stockman's ad
missions are "refreshing," they are
undoubtedly politically unwise. Rea
gan's anger was due to the ironic
truth that such honesty probably will

damage to some extent the credibili
ty of the White House economic pro
gram. When naive followers find
their leaders' broad claims to be un
justified, fundamental doubts are
raised about the positive aspects a
program may contain as well. Given
this inescapable reality, a president
has some basis to his demands for
loyalty. Reagan showed unusual to
lerance in not succumbing to bad
press by firing an "extraordinarily
capable public servant."
Yet what about the public's "right
to know"? More importantly, when
the budget director himself has seri
ous problems with the government's
budget proposals, Congress has a
very strong interest in knowing this
before putting these proposals into
effect.

Unfortunately, candidness and
open discussion are not rewarded in
contemporary politics. Ironically, the
public may actually gain more by hav
ing an opposing and critical yet pub
licly silent voice inside the White
House, where it has a chance of affec
ting the government's programs,
than in the ranks of political oppo
nents whose criticisms must always
be taken with a grain of salt. These
are all aspects of the game of politics.
To succeed, one must play by the
rules.
