## Sufficient food: birthright, not privilege 
### 
America has never suffered a national famine.
Despite intermittent droughts, poor harvests, dev
astating recessions and shameful inequities in in
come, few, if any, Americans have involuntarily
perished due to hunger.
Even during the Great Depression bread lines
provided meager rations to the unemployed
masses. Even in contemporary inner cities, govern
ment transfer payments guarantee the poverty
stricken income necessary to purchase subsistence
meals.
Among the billion Third World inhabitants who
struggle daily with empty stomachs, malnutrition
and hunger-related diseases, the situation is
drastically different. There were no bread lines for
the 20 million people who starved to death last
year. There are no welfare checks to help feed
Cambodian children with bloated bellies, brittle
limbs, emaciated visages, and hopeless eyes.
Americans have assured themselves of the
highest standard of living in the world. The "land
of plenty" has incessantly showered its benefits
upon all its citizens. This attitude of bounty has
been central in shaping our national conscious
ness. However, it has also led Americans to be
wasteful, myopic and, above all, selfish.
It has led a short-sighted and cowardly president
to shirk moral duty and utter such specious
statements as, "Unless a nation puts its own finan
cial and economic house in order no amount of aid
will produce progress." A compelling ration
alization, revealing the inner decay of the Ameri
can spirit. For President Ronald Reagan, the "spirit
of Cancun" was a grin masking an empty heart, a
slap on the back and a cheery "Good luck, fellas."
Not very heartening. One could invoke Hobbes,
Malthus or Heilbroner, project dwindling food
supplies for an ever-burgeoning global popu
lation, and cruelly theorize that starvation is hu
manity's demographic "safety valve." Or one
could point to the deterioration of the environ

ment and the depletion of the soil due to danger
ous pesticides, fertilizers and monoculture. Or
one could note that preschool mortality rates out
side the United States are three to 40 times as high
as for American youngsters, and that the differen
tial is primarily due to famine-induced disease.
Food should be a birthright, not a privilege. It
should be sufficient, accessible and of high quality.
The fact remains that hunger is a day-to-day reality
for many of the world's indigent, and it is a univer
sal problem for which we are all responsible. We
can "switch off" the NBC Nightly News when it
gets depressing; we cannot ethically do the same
with starvation.
The tragic and ironic fact is that the world al
ready produces enough food for every human to
be adequately nourished. The "green revolution,"
with its high-yield seeds and other technological
advances in agriculture, has reaped tremendous
gains in wheat, oat and barley cultivation. Un
fortunately, the advance of tractors and agribusi
ness has often meant the displacement and un
employment of millions of former farmers. It has
also nearly halted the practice of crop rotation (or
growing different crops in succession on the same
field), and intercropping (planting complemen
tary crops in the same field simultaneously), with
adverse effects on productivity, and distribution of
labor, and the organic and nitrogen content of soil.
Furthermore, the world food system relies heav
ily on fossil fuels. Nitrogen fertilizer, for example,
is converted from ammonia using oil. Heavy ma
chinery, of course, depends upon petroleum as
well for its operation. In short, farming uses more
gas than any other industry! When fossil fuels were
inexpensive, readily available, and cost-efficient,
these agricultural strategies may have made sense.
Today, however, with skyrocketing prices and the
uncertain supply of oil, it becomes necessary to in
vestigate alternative, non-depleting fuels such as
hydrogen, methane and alcohol, as well as energy

conservation measures.
In America today alterations in diet could ease
fossil fuel consumption, but more importantly, re
lease grain for shipment to other nations. In 1974,
U.S. meat consumption was 250 pounds per per
son, six times the amount recommended by the
United Nations Food and Agricultural Organiza
tion; consumption of fat is over three times the
recommended amount! Reducing consumption
of cattle meat by one-half would notonly allow the
United States to double its food exports, but it
would represent a nutritional gain for the nation.
Evidently, the critical problem in the world food
system is equitable distribution. Enough is pro
duced, but it does not get to those who most need
it. Reducing foreign aid to starving nations ex
acerbates the problem. However, despite record
harvests in Bangladesh due to imported technolo
gy, famine might still plague its inhabitants due to
the withdrawal and reduction of shipments of food
from donor countries such as the United States. As
Reagan would have it, let free enterprise feed the
people of Bangladesh.
In order to efficaciously address the needs of the
world's hungry, perhaps a system as radical as the
"New International Economics Order" proposed
by Tanzania's President Nyerere would be re
quired. Wholesale increases in food aid from the
North to the South, financed by an international
tax system and easier Third WnrlH v-ss to
Western credit would be the direi. icsult ./'such
a policy. Unfortunately, Reagan may be unable to
divert his attention long enough from hi p <;siden
tial pablumserved in his new White Housechinato
give serious thought to the disadvantaged in other
parts of the globe.
