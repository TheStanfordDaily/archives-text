## Holding down the fortissimo: the world of finer arts The 						Stanford Symphony mixes standards and a standout

The Stanford Symphony
Dinkelspiel Auditorium
13 November 1981
After the final chord of the opening movement of
Brahms' second piano concerto had filtered through the
crumpled programs and crushed hats held in 700 pairs of
tense hands, we remembered why we came, and all
breathed for what seemed the first time in ten minutes.
With the Brahms, the first concert this year by the Stan
ford Symphony under the direction of Andor Toth came
to a climax.
The concert drew a capacity crowd to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Friday night to hear this program of sym
phonic works ending with the piano concerto. Toth, in
his fourth year conducting the student orchestras here,
chose to begin the program with An Outdoor Overtuie
by the American composer Aaron Copland. The work,
written for a high school orchestra, is simple but attrac
tive, and offered little challenge for the group.
In composing the work, Copland was excited both
about "creating audiences" for contemporary American
music and about serving the needs of gifted young ar
tists, yet not frustrating the attempts of other enthusiastic
but less-gifted players. The piece, then, vacillates from
large-scale tutti's to more reserved solos, which Copland
meshes together with the subtlety of a master weaver.
Copland's conservative compositional style lends itself
very well to the needs of the student orchestra, and Toth
led the Symphony in a very musical interpretation which
suffered only from slight problems with brass articula
tion and wind intonation.
For the second work on the program, Toth chose an

orchestral standard: the Symphony No. 2 in D Major,
opus 36 of Ludwig van Beethoven. Composed in 1802,
the Symphony reflects the stylistic changes of
Beethoven's music at the time, rejecting staid classical
mores for a more experimental melodic, thematic, and
tonal structure.
The work begins with an Adagio Molto, an introduc
tion three times as long as its counterpart in Beethoven's
first symphony, straying far from the four-bar introduc
tions so favored by composers from Vivaldi through
Mozart. The Allegro cor) brio which follows develops
themes stated in the Adagio.
The second, third, and final movements progress in
what is known affectionately as the "classical 'keep-em
interested' " form. Acknowledging the attention span of
the audience, compositions will generally decrease in
complexity as they progress. Beethoven (who did not fol
low this maxim in his later symphonies) develops materi
al from the initial introduction throughout the work, in
various degrees of simplicity.
The Symphony performed the work with a remarkable
musical sense for interpretation, following principles
Toth expressed at the beginning of his tenure here. The
Symphony is designed to allow students to rehearse and
perform great music, to understand the difficulties and
the rewards of performing the classics of the orchestral
repertoire.
The first two works on the program demonstrated
both of these principles, and despite a few technical
flaws, produced an excellent result.
But this principle does not apply to the Piano Concerto
No. 2 in B-flat Major, opus 83 by Johannes Brahms, a
devlishly difficult and physically demanding work rarely
performed by amateur groups. When David Ng-Quinn,
the student soloist performing the work, walked on stage
to the piano, iny apprehension increased. Slight of build,

he looked far too frail to approach this energetic con
certo, and as he sat down I gazed in wonder and
squirmed a bit in anticipation at the pending duel be
tween man and piano, of which the outcome seemed al
ready assured.
The opening bars, however — a beautifully stately
horn solo answered by sweeping arpeggiated runs in the
piano — sent the audience into exactly the disposition
that Brahms intended. We were floating in a quiet sea,
rising and falling in ornately-structured waves of feeling.
In other words, we were fooled, lulled into forgetting
the storms to come.
And they came, hammered out by Ng-Quinn with un
canny precision and understanding. We were in for it, as
Toth and the young pianist led us through the enchant
ing jungle that is the Concerto's first movement. The ten
sion did not abate until after the final chord had hung in
the air to be mercilessly plucked away by the opening
chords of the second movement.
Nowhere else in the symphonic literature, with the ex
ception of Beethoven's ninth symphony, is there such a
combination of first and second movements so demand
ing on the players and the audience, creating a pro
longed sense of tense, nervous energy. The first move
ment was performed beautifully by pianist and orchestra
alike, bringing out all of the depth, the passion, and the
maturity that Brahms struggled to produce.
The second movement, a Scherzo, Allegro ap
passionato, is, if possible, even more physically exacting
than the first. Its form resembles that of a theme and vari
ations in its quick development of the primary and sec
ondary themes. Ng-Quinn gave to this movement a feel
ing of energy and substance that made it work despite
minor problems in the orchestra, whose fingers and em
bouchures were not quite equal to their passion.

The third movement is a masterpiece of orchestral
scoring, matching the cello with the piano with a sense
for chamber music that is reminiscent of Brahms' cello
sonatas and piano quartets. An echoing figure between
cello and oboe presents the height of romantic beauty
even in it r simplicity. The cellist and oboist played ex
tremely well together and alone, matching feeling and
movement perfectly with the pianist.
The movement, tremendously moving at points, suf
fered from intonation problems in the winds, a problem
created in part by the structure of the stage and the
sound shell in back of the orchestra.
The final movement is a quick two-beat dance, with
melodies characteristic of Germany, Austria, and Hunga
ry. Toth ledan inspired group, who were suffering slight
ly, I think, from the length of the work. It was an en
thusiastic rendition smacking almost imperceptibly of
the Hungarian influence of the conductor.
The physical demands of the piece almost caught up
with Ng-Quinn, but he carried the whole, including a
dropped bar, with the aplomb of a veteran seasoned by
years of touring. His sense of rhythm and movement did
not suffer at all from these minor lapses, and he finished
the Concerto with the same amount of feeling which he
showed at the beginning of the work.
The final chords sent the audience into cheers of rec
ognition, of thanks, and of praise for this young pianist
who shared this wonderful performance with them. The
performance of the piano concerto was the work that at
tracted most of the audience to this program, and rightly
so. But in the future, I think, they may come just for the
Symphony, who demonstrated their own ability to mas
ter a program of difficult pieces, and present a delightful
concert well worth attending.
