# Crowd speaks out against rape in White Plaza
## 
### Heather Millar 
As many as 700 members of the
Stanford community — students,
professors, clerical workers, alum
ni and staff — filled White Plaza
yesterday at noon to participate in
a "Speak out against rape" rally
organized by a coalition of various
campus groups in response to the
recent rash of reported rapes in
Stanford and the surrounding
area.
"There are a lot of people that
are concerned about rape, angry
about rape, and frustrated about
rape," said junior Robin Cooper, a
coordinator of the event. "We
want to express that frustration . . .
and do something about it." Co
oper emphasized that rape is a
community problem which
should be confronted by the Uni
versity, and by society as a whole.
Red arm bands were distributed
before and during the rally to af

firm this solidarity, and symbolize,
according to one of the coordi
nators, "the blood, the violence
and the anger" which both men
and women feel about rape.
"The current awareness of rape
reminds us that we are a com
munity," said English Prof. and Ac
ting Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Diane Middlebrook said. How
ever, she added that anger be
tween the sexes and racial
polarization threaten to divide the
community. Middlebrook also
emphasized the far-reaching na
ture of the current problem.
"The enemy that we address to
day is real," Middlebrook said.
"But it's not a black man and it's
not men in gene;al, it's the prob
lem of the violence of rape in gen
eral."
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
residential education, said, "I
want to assure the women that the

Stanford administration is con
cerned about rape."
Supton encouraged students to
contact a list of faculty women
who are qualified to counsel rape
victims.
Speakers also pointed out that
although rape is currently receiv
ing a "flurry of publicity" evi
denced by television and radio
coverage of the rally, it is a prob
lem that is always present. "The
Stanford police tell us that 'A little
fear is good right now,'" said
Helen Neally, a graduate student
in political science. "(Fear) begins
when we are born. Fear has been
used to keep us imprisoned and
we're bound to it and by it."
Neally added that I his fear is
used to perpetuate the "myth"
that the victim will be white and
the rapist will be a black stranger.
This, she said, denies the reality
that rape is pervasive.

Law Prof. Catherine MacKin
non further pursued this issue by
pointing out that the media has
emphasized the race of the al
leged attacker, while the race of
the victims has gone unreported.
Thus, according to MacKinnon, it
is assumed that the victims were
white. MacKinnon contended,
however, that two of the recent
rape victims were "women of col
or." She added that the number of
black rape victims is 10 to 12 times
that of white rape victims. "Rapes
by strangers and rapes by men of
another race are the most un
usual," she said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Harrington declined comment on
the race of recent rape victims.
"Don't look for a maniac," said
Neally. "Look for the guy next
door."
