# Crowd speaks out against rape in White Plaza
## 
### Heather Millar 
As many as 700 members of the
Stanford community — students,
professors, clerical workers, alum
ni and staff — filled White Plaza
yesterday at noon to participate in
a "Speak out against rape" rally
organized by a coalition of various
campus groups in response to the
recent rash of reported rapes in
Stanford and the surrounding
area.
"There are a lot of people that
are concerned about rape, angry
about rape, and frustrated about
rape," said junior Robin Cooper, a
coordinator of the event. "We
want to express that frustration . . .
and do something about it." Co
oper emphasized that rape is a
community problem which
should be confronted by the Uni
versity, and by society as a whole.
Red arm bands were distributed
before and during the rally to af

firm this solidarity, and symbolize,
according to one of the coordi
nators, "the blood, the violence
and the anger" which both men
and women feel about rape.
"The current awareness of rape
reminds us that we are a com
munity," said English Prof. and Ac
ting Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Diane Middlebrook said. How
ever, she added that anger be
tween the sexes and racial
polarization threaten to divide the
community. Middlebrook also
emphasized the far-reaching na
ture of the current problem.
"The enemy that we address to
day is real," Middlebrook said.
"But it's not a black man and it's
not men in gene;al, it's the prob
lem of the violence of rape in gen
eral."
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
residential education, said, "I
want to assure the women that the

Stanford administration is con
cerned about rape."
Supton encouraged students to
contact a list of faculty women
who are qualified to counsel rape
victims.
Speakers also pointed out that
although rape is currently receiv
ing a "flurry of publicity" evi
denced by television and radio
coverage of the rally, it is a prob
lem that is always present. "The
Stanford police tell us that 'A little
fear is good right now,'" said
Helen Neally, a graduate student
in political science. "(Fear) begins
when we are born. Fear has been
used to keep us imprisoned and
we're bound to it and by it."
Neally added that I his fear is
used to perpetuate the "myth"
that the victim will be white and
the rapist will be a black stranger.
This, she said, denies the reality
that rape is pervasive.

Law Prof. Catherine MacKin
non further pursued this issue by
pointing out that the media has
emphasized the race of the al
leged attacker, while the race of
the victims has gone unreported.
Thus, according to MacKinnon, it
is assumed that the victims were
white. MacKinnon contended,
however, that two of the recent
rape victims were "women of col
or." She added that the number of
black rape victims is 10 to 12 times
that of white rape victims. "Rapes
by strangers and rapes by men of
another race are the most un
usual," she said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Harrington declined comment on
the race of recent rape victims.
"Don't look for a maniac," said
Neally. "Look for the guy next
door."

"Speak out against rape" rally in response to the recent rash of

pus. Red arm bands were worn by many to symbolize the "blood,

it even worse because the rape
might have been prevented."
Although the victims of the oth
er five attacks were alone when
the incidents occurred, the junior
said that because there were other
people on the Galvez bike path
when she was accosted, she didn't
feel unsafe. "I would've been real
ly scared if I had been alone," she
said, but "I was almost touching
fenders with another girl" cycling
just ahead and "there were two or
three other people around."
"I don't think the other girl
even saw him flash," she added.
In other developments, Stan
ford police reiterated yesterday
that, despite local radio and
telivision reports, they believe
that Melvin Sturns, 19, an East Palo
Alto man arrested Sunday in con
nprtion with a rape in East Palo

Alto early Sunday morning, is not
the "campus rapist."
"It's doubtful that it's our man,"
Herrington said. "I think the guy
sounds like (he might be con
nected with) the two cases that oc
curred in Menlo Park (last week),"
he added.
"The whole mode of operation
is entirely different," said Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, the Stanford po
lice officer heading the investiga
tion of the campus attacks. "This
guy is primarily a burglar, they got
him as he was stealing the victim's
vehicle."
Although Sturns is a 19-year-old
black male and 5 foot 11 inches
tall, he has a 4-inch afro haircut
and "looks like he's 30,"
Niemeyer said. "If you saw the
photos, you'd agree (that he's not
the same man)," he added.

sounds like (he might be con
nected with) the two cases that oc
curred in Menlo Park (last week),"
he added.
"The whole mode of operation
is entirely different," said Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer, the Stanford po
lice officer heading the investiga
tion of the campus attacks. "This
guy is primarily a burglar, they got
him as he was stealing the victim's
vehicle."
Although Sturns is a 19-year-old
black male and 5 foot 11 inches
tall, he has a 4-inch afro haircut
and "looks like he's 30,"
Niemeyer said. "If you saw the
photos, you'd agree (that he's not
the same man)," he added.
As many as 700 members of the
Stanford community — students,
professors, clerical workers, alum
ni and staff — filled White Plaza
yesterday at noon to participate in
a "Speak out against rape" rally
organized by a coalition of various
campus groups in response to the
recent rash of reported rapes in
Stanford and the surrounding
area.
"There are a lot of people that
are concerned about rape, angry
about rape, and frustrated about
rape," said junior Robin Cooper, a
coordinator of the event. "We
want to express that frustration . . .
and do something about it." Co
oper emphasized that rape is a
community problem which
should be confronted by the Uni
versity, and by society as a whole.
Red arm bands were distributed
before and during the rally to af

firm this solidarity, and symbolize,
according to one of the coordi
nators, "the blood, the violence
and the anger" which both men
and women feel about rape.
"The current awareness of rape
reminds us that we are a com
munity," said English Prof. and Ac
ting Dean of Undergraduate Stud
ies Diane Middlebrook said. How
ever, she added that anger be
tween the sexes and racial
polarization threaten to divide the
community. Middlebrook also
emphasized the far-reaching na
ture of the current problem.
"The enemy that we address to
day is real," Middlebrook said.
"But it's not a black man and it's
not men in gene;al, it's the prob
lem of the violence of rape in gen
eral."
Alice Supton, assistant dean of
residential education, said, "I
want to assure the women that the

Stanford administration is con
cerned about rape."
Supton encouraged students to
contact a list of faculty women
who are qualified to counsel rape
victims.
Speakers also pointed out that
although rape is currently receiv
ing a "flurry of publicity" evi
denced by television and radio
coverage of the rally, it is a prob
lem that is always present. "The
Stanford police tell us that 'A little
fear is good right now,'" said
Helen Neally, a graduate student
in political science. "(Fear) begins
when we are born. Fear has been
used to keep us imprisoned and
we're bound to it and by it."
Neally added that I his fear is
used to perpetuate the "myth"
that the victim will be white and
the rapist will be a black stranger.
This, she said, denies the reality
that rape is pervasive.

Law Prof. Catherine MacKin
non further pursued this issue by
pointing out that the media has
emphasized the race of the al
leged attacker, while the race of
the victims has gone unreported.
Thus, according to MacKinnon, it
is assumed that the victims were
white. MacKinnon contended,
however, that two of the recent
rape victims were "women of col
or." She added that the number of
black rape victims is 10 to 12 times
that of white rape victims. "Rapes
by strangers and rapes by men of
another race are the most un
usual," she said.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin
Harrington declined comment on
the race of recent rape victims.
"Don't look for a maniac," said
Neally. "Look for the guy next
door."

it even worse because the rape
might have been prevented."
Although the victims of the oth
er five attacks were alone when
the incidents occurred, the junior
said that because there were other
people on the Galvez bike path
when she was accosted, she didn't
feel unsafe. "I would've been real
ly scared if I had been alone," she
said, but "I was almost touching
fenders with another girl" cycling
just ahead and "there were two or
three other people around."
"I don't think the other girl
even saw him flash," she added.
In other developments, Stan
ford police reiterated yesterday
that, despite local radio and
telivision reports, they believe
that Melvin Sturns, 19, an East Palo
Alto man arrested Sunday in con
nprtion with a rape in East Palo

Alto early Sunday morning, is not
the "campus rapist."
