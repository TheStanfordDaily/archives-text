# SF Opera: uninspired excellence
## 
### Andrew Clarke 
The line to buy standing
room at last Thursday's
opening o"f the San Francis
co Opera's new Aida began
forming at 9:00 Wednesday
night. By 5:00 Thursday,
when tickets finally went on
sale, the assembled crowd
had packed the box office
lobby of the Opera house
and was collecting outside
in the rain. The "feet seats"
sold out in a flash, and the
three hundred lucky stand
ees camped out at the en
trances in Big Game fashion
in preparation for the stam
pede to the rails. Finally the
doors opened and several
women screamed as the
anxious crowd began shov
ing. "This is not Mick Jagger,
ladies," exclaimed one of
the ticket takers.
No indeed. This was Lu
ciano Pavarotti, making his
long-awaited debut as
Rhadames. And from the in
stant Pavarotti opened his
mouth it wasclear why he is
a superstar. His strong tenor
had an ambrosial clarity plus
a flawless attack, and the
perfect intonation that so
many opera singers sacrifice
in striving for pear-shaped
tones. Even in an uninspired
performance such as he
gave Thursday evening,
Pavarotti'sextraordinary vo
cal instrumentation never
fails to cause gooseflesh.
Rhadames, however, is
not Pavarotti's role. Perhaps
he simply needs to become
more familiar with the char
acter, or maybe his usual
opening-night nervousness
affected him, but his heart
was clearly not in the music.
His "Celeste Aida" was par
ticularly disappointing. He
just strolled on stage, faced

front, sang, and left. Al
though Pavarotti's voice was
heavenly, his interpretation
of the opera's famous open
ing aria was mediocre at
best.
Margaret Price, on the
other hand, threw ev
erything she had into her
Aida. Just before the curtain
rose, Kurt Herbert Adler an
nounced that Miss Price
would perform in spite of
having been "affected by
the weather". Fler soprano,
however, suffered little
audible damage. She gave
the most satisfying per
formance of all the princi
pals â€” convincing both dra
matically and musically. Per
haps the audience came to
see Pavarotti, but they left
talking about Margaret
Price.
Of the other principals,
Stefania Toczsyska as Am
neris stood out because of
her brilliant performance in
the temple/tomb scene of
the third act. Simon Estes
(Amonasro), Kurt Rydl
(Ramfis) and Kevin Langan
(Pharoah) all gave solid if
not particularly memorable
performances.
The sets by Douglas
Schmidt and the costumes
by Lawrence Casey were
both splendid. Majestic and
colorful, they reflected
authentically the grandeur
of ancient Egypt without
seeming too ornate or clut
tered. The lighting design,
too, was most sensitive.
Thomas Munn created a
broad spectrum of moods
from the oriental blue mys
tique of the Nile scene and
the temple's eerie golden
glow to the energetic
brilliance of the triumphal
scene. This excellence in the
lighting effects - is
noteworthy since Munn was

constrained by the demands
of the television cameras
which carry the per
formances to Europe by sat
ellite.
Unfortunately, Margo
Sappington's choreography
was not even worthy of the
polite applause it received.
In their appearances both in
Amneris' bedroom and the
triumphal scene, the dan
cers were out of sync with
both the music and each
other. Sappington seemed
to be trying to blend me
chanical movements with
postures reminiscent of
Egyptian art. Although the
idea had merit, the final
product was a disaster. In
stead of appearing properly
mechanical, the dancers
seemed more uncom
fortable and awkward with a
style whose motivation they
didn't understand. Christian
Holder, the solo dancer in
the triumphal scene, was a
great disappointment. He
too seemed restrained by
Sappington's poorly con
stucted movements.
The orchestra also had its
problems under the direc
tion of Garcia Navarro.
Tempos tended to drag ev
erywhere, particularly in the
triumphal scene. Navarro
also seemed incapable of
coordinating the principals
and the orchestra in the
faster recitative sections.
Still, San Francisco's new
Aida is a magnificent specta
cle, assui ing that Grand Op
era is not an anachronism in
1981. Seats for all per
formances of Aida are sold
out, of course, but one can
still enjoy an excellent view
and superior sound from
the "feet seats". Better call
the box office first for a sug
gestion on when to start lin
ing up. . .
