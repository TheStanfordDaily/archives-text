# The 						Savoyards' theatre-as-usual
## 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
Accompanied by the usual
display of long-lost loves, vil
lains, heroes, heroines, and
stupid aristocracy, the Stanford
Savoyards began their per
formance of The Sorcerer by
that pair of Victorian satyrists,
or rather satirists, W.S. Gilbert
and Sir Arthur Sullivan. In the
following two hours, I got my
fix of turn-of-the-century
melodrama, in what proved to
be a thoroughly enjoyable eve
ning.
The operetta is an enchant
ing poke into the respectability
of love, marriage, and the
aristocracy, in that order. It in
volves a pair of lovers, who
through their belief that "In
marriage alone is to be found a
panacea for any ill," decide to
hire a sorcerer to distribute a
love-potion throughout the
town that will induce everyone
to fall in love with the person of
the opposite sex upon whom
he/she first sets eyes.
Of course, everyone falls in
love with the wrong person,
creating much confusion,
and. . . well, I can't say how it
resolves, although I think I
know. I mean, I think I under
stood.
As is so common in Gilbert
and Sullivan operettas, the plot
and characters are constructed
to poke fun at contemporary
situations. The high ideals of
the youth of the day — to cross
all barriers of class, rank, and
occupation, not to mention
beauty — are dashed by their
own doing. After distributing
the love potion, the Sorcerer
separates the lovers' parents,
representing the aristocracy,
from the masses, in a segrega
tion the younger generation
finds appropriate.
In the end, of course, all class
barriers are restored to their
former state, appeasing not
only the aristocracy in the cast,
but in the audience too. The

operettas were originally per
formed before an audience
consisting mainly of upper
class patrons of the arts, who
could laugh at themselves up
to a certain point after which
the status quo must be re
stored.
Seen in this light, the operet
ta gains a new significance to
day. Even if we do not under
stand some of the jokes, we can
laugh at the ideas that are far
more antiquated now than
they were 90 years ago. We can
laugh at the audience of that
period being satisfied only
upon reintroduction of the
proper order.
As far as we are concerned, it
is appropriate to laugh at the
social segregation represented
on stage because we frown
upon it in daily life. But most of
the practices and procedures
depicted were an established
part of the society of the time,
before the first stages of throw

ing off the burden,of Victorian
morality.
The performance was very
professional, as usual, with
only one weak voice among
the soloists. The orchestra, un
der the strong direction of
Nina Gilbert, was superb, pro
ducing a marvelous sound,
well-tuned and almost per
fectly balanced. They per
formed the overture and all the
orchestral accompaniments
with flair, emphasizing the
Wagnerian statements that
sneak into the composition at
points. Only a slight problem
of overbalance in the brass
tarnished their otherwise flaw
less support of the cast.
The chorus also shone
throughout, providing a solid
backing for the soloists and a
marvelous sound in their own
right, with very good volume
for the size. Their costumes
were also wonderful, with each
"right" couple wearing

matching fabric patternstc fa
cilitate recognition, so the au
dience knows when something
is wrong in the castle of Sir
Marmaduke Pointdexter.
The choreography was
simple, and at points, bare. But
throughout, one had the feel
ing that taste was the necessi
tating impulse and guide for in
spiration.
Outstanding individual per
formances came from Ed Fire
stone as Sir Marmaduke, Kyle
Ridout as his son Alexis, David
Friburg as J.W. Wells,
the sorrerei, Jennifer Sullivan
as Aline, and Gayle Groff as
Constance. Also noteworthy in
their comic roles were Mimi
Hazleton as Lady Sangazure,
and David Gilman as Hercules
— at three feet, the shortest
Hercules I have ever seen.
A fine evening of entertain
ment for all, The Sorcerer con
tinues this weekend in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
