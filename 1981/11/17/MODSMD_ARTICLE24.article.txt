Court to review sex ruling •
Washington — The Supreme Courj, agreed
yesterday to decide how far states may go in re
stricting the use of children in sex scenes in
movies, plays, books or photographs.
The justices announced that they would rule
on the constitutionality of a New York law that
imposes criminal penaltieson persons who pro
duce, direct or promote sexual performances
by children under 16. The law does not require:
prosecutors to prove that the materials in ques
tion are legally obscene.
The case shapes up as a significant test ofthe
extent to which authorities may take special ac l
tion to combat child pornography or any other
use of children and young teen-agers in sex
scenes.
Lawyers challenging the New York law claim
that it is so restrictive it could be interpreted as
outlawing scenes in many popular movies * —
such as performances by Linda Blair in "The Ex
orcist," Brooke Shields in "Pretty Baby" or Jodie
Foster in "Taxi Driver."
New York officials, however, say movie direc
tors and producers could use adult stand-ins or
sophisticated cutting techniques to depict
those sex scenes without actually requiring
child actresses or actors to participate in the
them.
Kirkland blasts Reagan
New York — AFL-CIO President bane
Kirkland, who started burning his bridges to the
Reagan administration many months ago, yes
terday almost finished the job with a fiery at
tacking speech that brought a standing ovation
from delegates attending the federation's 14th
constitutional convention here.
He said among many other things that the ad
ministration "promised us a boom but brought
us a bust"; has "drained the public purse to
■ lavish welfare on the greedy rich"; has left our
allies in "dismay and division" while indulging
in "the appeasement of the Saudi, financial-in
dustrial complex with gifts of costly and exotic
weapons, paid for in higher oil prices by the
American consumer."
But the administration sent in an emergency
brigade to dampen, if not extinguish, the
rhetorical flames. The Reagan aides, a team of
three led by White House chief of labor liaison
Robert Bonitati, carried copies of a presidential
memorandum "to headsof alldepartmentsand
agencies" instructing them to "seek the advice
and counsel of organized laboron public policy
issues." The memorandum was signed by Rea
gan yesterday. The aides also brought a letter
from White House aide Elizabeth Dole, dated
Nov. 13, inviting Kirkland, AFL-CIO Secretary
Treasurer Thomas Donahue and the feder
ation's 33 member executive council to a White
House meeting with Reagan on Dec. 2.
Neither Reagan, Labor Secretary Raymond
Donovan nor any other member of the adminis
tration was invited to address the convention.
U.S. to punish Soviet airline
Washington — The government yesterday
suspended flights into the United States by the
Soviet airline, Aeroflot, for a week as a penalty
for overflying "sensitive areas" in New England.
The Civil Aeronautics Board said it would bar
Aeroflot flights from Nov. 21 to Nov. 28 at the
request of the State Department, which had
complained that two Soviet flights, one in
bound and one outbound, strayed from their
agreed paths on Nov. 8.
Aeroflot has two roundtrip flights a week be
tween Washington and Moscow, with arrival
and departures on Tuesday and Sunday. The as
signed route calls for the planes to keep over
the Atlantic between New York City and Maine.
The State Department complained that the

two flights "overflew sensitive areas of southern
New England" instead. Officials at both the
State and Defense Departments were reluctant
to discuss which sites they consider sensitive.
However, it was noted that the U.S. Mr Force
has two B-52 bomber bases in New England,
Loring and Pease in New Hampshire, as well as a
sophisticated new radar complex at Otis Air
Force Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts which
scans the Atlantic on guard against possible mis
sile attack from Soviet submarines.
An obvious focus of Soviet interest is the
Groton, Connecticut, area where all of this
country's Trident missile-firing submarines are
being built and where many nuclear-powered
attack submarines have been sent to sea.
There was no suggestion in the official U.S.
announcement that the Soviet jetliners were
carrying reconnaisance gear, and officials
would not elaborate about their concern.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that
under a U S -Soviet agreement the Aeroflot jet
liners must keep to a specific route over U.S.
territory.
Japanese surprised by uproar
Tokvo — A Japanese magazine editor ex
pressed astonishment yesterday over the con
troversy about a $1000 gratuity given to White
House aide Richard Allen. He said it was the
magazine's own idea to make the payment.
"It (the controversy) is a bolt out of the blue
to us," Tsugio Takamori, editor-in-chief of the
women's magazine Shufu-no-Tomo (House
wives' Friend) told The Associated Press.
"We had no idea that government officials in
the United States are not allowed to receive
more than $100. We did everything Japanese
style."
"I am very surprised and puzzled at the up
roar over this interview. We paid the $1000 ac
cording to Japanese custom.
"The idea of paying $1000 for this particular
interview naturally originated from the maga
zine," Takamori said. "When the interview with
Mrs. Reagan was arranged in late December, I
discussed the question of giving an honorarium
— as we always do in such cases — and decided
that $1,000 would be appropriate."
Allen, President Ronald Reagan's chief na
tional security adviser, denied any impropriety,
but acknowledged he received the money. He
said he "intercepted" it to avoid causing em
barrassment to Mrs. Reagan and the journalists,
then put it in a safe and forgot about it until oth
ers discovered it during an office move.
Ulster MPs 'cry havoc'
London — Protestant Ulster Unionist politi
cians yesterday disrupted the British Par
liament, vowed to bring local government in
British-ruled Northern Ireland to a standstill
and threatened to set up their own security
force there following Saturday's assassination of
a hard-line Unionist member of Parliament, the
Rev. Robert Bradford, by Irish nationalist ter
rorists.
At the same time, police in Britain launched a
massive around-the-clock search of hundreds
of thousands of garages, businesses and aban
doned homes for up to 500 pounds of ex
plosives they believe have been hidden by pro
visional Irish Republican Army terrorists re
sponsbile for four bombings in the past five
weeks in the London area. The bombings have
killed three people, injured 40 and destroyed
the surburban London home of Britain's at
torney general while he was out of the country.
The search in the London area alone, involv
ing 16,000 police officers with all leaves can
celed for the week it is expected to take, was de
scribed by officials as the biggest ever mounted
here. Large quantities of explosives were found
by police in hiding places here during IRA bom

bing campaigns in London in 1972 and 1976.
In yesterdav's extraordinary disruption of Par
liament, three hard-line Unionist members led
by the Rev lan Paisley were ordered out of the
House of Commons and suspended for the next
five business days after they repeatedly inter
rupted go\eminent statements on Bradford's
killing with shouted accusations blaming Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Northern
Ireland secretary, James Prior, for the sharp rise
in attacks by the Provisional IRA in Northern
Ireland, where four more Protestants, including
Bradford, were killed last week alone.
Paisley and two other members of Parliament
from the Democratic Unionist Party in Belfast,
Peter Robinson and John McQuade, sitting in a
gallery overlooking the Commons chamber,
shouted "rubbish" in response to Prior's call for
calm in Northern Ireland. "You have given us
nothing but the IRA — you are guilty of it," Mc-
Quade shouted at Prior, whom hard-line Prot
estant Unionists have accused with Thatcher of
giving Irish nationalist terrorists encourage
ment by improving British relations with the Re
public of Ireland.
The speaker of the House, George Thomas,
won a voice vote suspending the three
Unionists from Parliament for five days for
"grossly disorderly conduct and ignoring the
authority of the chair."
Actor William Holden dies
Santa Mnnira — William Holden, one of the
movies' most popular leading men for more
than 40 years and an Oscar winner as the cynical
prisoner of war in "Stalag 17," was found dead
yesterday at his apartment, police said.
The 63-year-old actor apparently died of nat
ural causes, police said. There was "no indica
tion" of foul play.
The coroner's examination showed Holden
had been dead for some time; probably as long
as one week.
The manager at Holden's apartment building
— which overlooks the Pacific Ocean — found
the body after he became concerned because
he had not seen or heard from Holden in two or
three weeks, Tapia said.
Holden had not been reported in poor
health, but in the last year there had been re
ports he was going to West Germany to consult
with Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer expert. Nieper
said at the time he did not think Holden was se
riously ill.
Holden was a close friend of President and
former actor Ronald Reagan. Their friendship
went back to the days in the 1950s when both
were officers in the Screen Actors Guild. Rea
gan went on to become president of SAG.
President Ronald Reagan was "shocked"
when informed of his old friend's death yester
day, said White House spokesman Larry
Speakes in Washington. "What do say
about a longtime friend?" Speakes quoted Rea
gan as saying. "A great sense of personal loss, a
fine man. Our friendship never wa*ied."
Holden and his former wife, Ardis ("Brenda")
Holden, were best man and matron of honor at
the wedding of Ronald Reagan and First Lady
Nancy Reagan.

New York officials, however, say movie direc

sophisticated cutting techniques to depict
those sex scenes without actually requiring
child actresses or actors to participate in the
them.
Kirkland blasts Reagan
New York — AFL-CIO President bane
Kirkland, who started burning his bridges to the
Reagan administration many months ago, yes
terday almost finished the job with a fiery at
tacking speech that brought a standing ovation
from delegates attending the federation's 14th
constitutional convention here.
He said among many other things that the ad
ministration "promised us a boom but brought
us a bust"; has "drained the public purse to
■ lavish welfare on the greedy rich"; has left our
allies in "dismay and division" while indulging
in "the appeasement of the Saudi, financial-in
dustrial complex with gifts of costly and exotic
weapons, paid for in higher oil prices by the
American consumer."
But the administration sent in an emergency
brigade to dampen, if not extinguish, the
rhetorical flames. The Reagan aides, a team of
three led by White House chief of labor liaison
Robert Bonitati, carried copies of a presidential
memorandum "to headsof alldepartmentsand
agencies" instructing them to "seek the advice
and counsel of organized laboron public policy
issues." The memorandum was signed by Rea
gan yesterday. The aides also brought a letter
from White House aide Elizabeth Dole, dated
Nov. 13, inviting Kirkland, AFL-CIO Secretary
Treasurer Thomas Donahue and the feder
ation's 33 member executive council to a White
House meeting with Reagan on Dec. 2.
Neither Reagan, Labor Secretary Raymond
Donovan nor any other member of the adminis
tration was invited to address the convention.
U.S. to punish Soviet airline
Washington — The government yesterday
suspended flights into the United States by the
Soviet airline, Aeroflot, for a week as a penalty
for overflying "sensitive areas" in New England.
The Civil Aeronautics Board said it would bar
Aeroflot flights from Nov. 21 to Nov. 28 at the
request of the State Department, which had
complained that two Soviet flights, one in
bound and one outbound, strayed from their
agreed paths on Nov. 8.
Aeroflot has two roundtrip flights a week be
tween Washington and Moscow, with arrival
and departures on Tuesday and Sunday. The as
signed route calls for the planes to keep over
the Atlantic between New York City and Maine.
The State Department complained that the

two flights "overflew sensitive areas of southern
New England" instead. Officials at both the
State and Defense Departments were reluctant
to discuss which sites they consider sensitive.
However, it was noted that the U.S. Mr Force
has two B-52 bomber bases in New England,
Loring and Pease in New Hampshire, as well as a
sophisticated new radar complex at Otis Air
Force Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts which
scans the Atlantic on guard against possible mis
sile attack from Soviet submarines.
An obvious focus of Soviet interest is the
Groton, Connecticut, area where all of this
country's Trident missile-firing submarines are
being built and where many nuclear-powered
attack submarines have been sent to sea.
There was no suggestion in the official U.S.
announcement that the Soviet jetliners were
carrying reconnaisance gear, and officials
would not elaborate about their concern.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that
under a U S -Soviet agreement the Aeroflot jet
liners must keep to a specific route over U.S.
territory.
Japanese surprised by uproar
Tokvo — A Japanese magazine editor ex
pressed astonishment yesterday over the con
troversy about a $1000 gratuity given to White
House aide Richard Allen. He said it was the
magazine's own idea to make the payment.
"It (the controversy) is a bolt out of the blue
to us," Tsugio Takamori, editor-in-chief of the
women's magazine Shufu-no-Tomo (House
wives' Friend) told The Associated Press.
"We had no idea that government officials in
the United States are not allowed to receive
more than $100. We did everything Japanese
style."
"I am very surprised and puzzled at the up
roar over this interview. We paid the $1000 ac
cording to Japanese custom.
"The idea of paying $1000 for this particular
interview naturally originated from the maga
zine," Takamori said. "When the interview with
Mrs. Reagan was arranged in late December, I
discussed the question of giving an honorarium
— as we always do in such cases — and decided
that $1,000 would be appropriate."
Allen, President Ronald Reagan's chief na
tional security adviser, denied any impropriety,
but acknowledged he received the money. He
said he "intercepted" it to avoid causing em
barrassment to Mrs. Reagan and the journalists,
then put it in a safe and forgot about it until oth
ers discovered it during an office move.
Ulster MPs 'cry havoc'
London — Protestant Ulster Unionist politi
cians yesterday disrupted the British Par
liament, vowed to bring local government in
British-ruled Northern Ireland to a standstill
and threatened to set up their own security
force there following Saturday's assassination of
a hard-line Unionist member of Parliament, the
Rev. Robert Bradford, by Irish nationalist ter
rorists.
At the same time, police in Britain launched a
massive around-the-clock search of hundreds
of thousands of garages, businesses and aban
doned homes for up to 500 pounds of ex
plosives they believe have been hidden by pro
visional Irish Republican Army terrorists re
sponsbile for four bombings in the past five
weeks in the London area. The bombings have
killed three people, injured 40 and destroyed
the surburban London home of Britain's at
torney general while he was out of the country.
The search in the London area alone, involv
ing 16,000 police officers with all leaves can
celed for the week it is expected to take, was de
scribed by officials as the biggest ever mounted
here. Large quantities of explosives were found
by police in hiding places here during IRA bom

bing campaigns in London in 1972 and 1976.
In yesterdav's extraordinary disruption of Par
liament, three hard-line Unionist members led
by the Rev lan Paisley were ordered out of the
House of Commons and suspended for the next
five business days after they repeatedly inter
rupted go\eminent statements on Bradford's
killing with shouted accusations blaming Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Northern
Ireland secretary, James Prior, for the sharp rise
in attacks by the Provisional IRA in Northern
Ireland, where four more Protestants, including
Bradford, were killed last week alone.
Paisley and two other members of Parliament
from the Democratic Unionist Party in Belfast,
Peter Robinson and John McQuade, sitting in a
gallery overlooking the Commons chamber,
shouted "rubbish" in response to Prior's call for
calm in Northern Ireland. "You have given us
nothing but the IRA — you are guilty of it," Mc-
Quade shouted at Prior, whom hard-line Prot
estant Unionists have accused with Thatcher of
giving Irish nationalist terrorists encourage
ment by improving British relations with the Re
public of Ireland.
The speaker of the House, George Thomas,
won a voice vote suspending the three
Unionists from Parliament for five days for
"grossly disorderly conduct and ignoring the
authority of the chair."
Actor William Holden dies
Santa Mnnira — William Holden, one of the
movies' most popular leading men for more
than 40 years and an Oscar winner as the cynical
prisoner of war in "Stalag 17," was found dead
yesterday at his apartment, police said.
The 63-year-old actor apparently died of nat
ural causes, police said. There was "no indica
tion" of foul play.
The coroner's examination showed Holden
had been dead for some time; probably as long
as one week.
The manager at Holden's apartment building
— which overlooks the Pacific Ocean — found
the body after he became concerned because
he had not seen or heard from Holden in two or
three weeks, Tapia said.
Holden had not been reported in poor
health, but in the last year there had been re
ports he was going to West Germany to consult
with Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer expert. Nieper
said at the time he did not think Holden was se
riously ill.
Holden was a close friend of President and
former actor Ronald Reagan. Their friendship
went back to the days in the 1950s when both
were officers in the Screen Actors Guild. Rea
gan went on to become president of SAG.
President Ronald Reagan was "shocked"
when informed of his old friend's death yester
day, said White House spokesman Larry
Speakes in Washington. "What do say
about a longtime friend?" Speakes quoted Rea
gan as saying. "A great sense of personal loss, a
fine man. Our friendship never wa*ied."
Holden and his former wife, Ardis ("Brenda")
Holden, were best man and matron of honor at
the wedding of Ronald Reagan and First Lady
Nancy Reagan.

Court to review sex ruling •
Washington — The Supreme Courj, agreed
yesterday to decide how far states may go in re
stricting the use of children in sex scenes in
movies, plays, books or photographs.
The justices announced that they would rule
on the constitutionality of a New York law that
imposes criminal penaltieson persons who pro
duce, direct or promote sexual performances
by children under 16. The law does not require:
prosecutors to prove that the materials in ques
tion are legally obscene.
The case shapes up as a significant test ofthe
extent to which authorities may take special ac l
tion to combat child pornography or any other
use of children and young teen-agers in sex
scenes.
Lawyers challenging the New York law claim
that it is so restrictive it could be interpreted as
outlawing scenes in many popular movies * —
such as performances by Linda Blair in "The Ex
orcist," Brooke Shields in "Pretty Baby" or Jodie
Foster in "Taxi Driver."
New York officials, however, say movie direc
tors and producers could use adult stand-ins or

But the administration sent in an emergency
brigade to dampen, if not extinguish, the
rhetorical flames. The Reagan aides, a team of
three led by White House chief of labor liaison
Robert Bonitati, carried copies of a presidential
memorandum "to headsof alldepartmentsand
agencies" instructing them to "seek the advice
and counsel of organized laboron public policy
issues." The memorandum was signed by Rea
gan yesterday. The aides also brought a letter
from White House aide Elizabeth Dole, dated
Nov. 13, inviting Kirkland, AFL-CIO Secretary
Treasurer Thomas Donahue and the feder

House meeting with Reagan on Dec. 2.
Neither Reagan, Labor Secretary Raymond
Donovan nor any other member of the adminis

U.S. to punish Soviet airline
Washington — The government yesterday
suspended flights into the United States by the
Soviet airline, Aeroflot, for a week as a penalty
for overflying "sensitive areas" in New England.
The Civil Aeronautics Board said it would bar
Aeroflot flights from Nov. 21 to Nov. 28 at the
request of the State Department, which had
complained that two Soviet flights, one in
bound and one outbound, strayed from their
agreed paths on Nov. 8.
Aeroflot has two roundtrip flights a week be
tween Washington and Moscow, with arrival
and departures on Tuesday and Sunday. The as
signed route calls for the planes to keep over
the Atlantic between New York City and Maine.
The State Department complained that the

two flights "overflew sensitive areas of southern
New England" instead. Officials at both the
State and Defense Departments were reluctant
to discuss which sites they consider sensitive.
However, it was noted that the U.S. Mr Force
has two B-52 bomber bases in New England,
Loring and Pease in New Hampshire, as well as a
sophisticated new radar complex at Otis Air
Force Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts which
scans the Atlantic on guard against possible mis
sile attack from Soviet submarines.
An obvious focus of Soviet interest is the
Groton, Connecticut, area where all of this
country's Trident missile-firing submarines are
being built and where many nuclear-powered
attack submarines have been sent to sea.
There was no suggestion in the official U.S.
announcement that the Soviet jetliners were
carrying reconnaisance gear, and officials
would not elaborate about their concern.
The Federal Aviation Administration said that
under a U S -Soviet agreement the Aeroflot jet
liners must keep to a specific route over U.S.
territory.
Japanese surprised by uproar
Tokvo — A Japanese magazine editor ex
pressed astonishment yesterday over the con
troversy about a $1000 gratuity given to White
House aide Richard Allen. He said it was the
magazine's own idea to make the payment.
"It (the controversy) is a bolt out of the blue
to us," Tsugio Takamori, editor-in-chief of the
women's magazine Shufu-no-Tomo (House
wives' Friend) told The Associated Press.
"We had no idea that government officials in
the United States are not allowed to receive
more than $100. We did everything Japanese
style."
"I am very surprised and puzzled at the up
roar over this interview. We paid the $1000 ac
cording to Japanese custom.
"The idea of paying $1000 for this particular
interview naturally originated from the maga
zine," Takamori said. "When the interview with
Mrs. Reagan was arranged in late December, I
discussed the question of giving an honorarium
— as we always do in such cases — and decided
that $1,000 would be appropriate."
Allen, President Ronald Reagan's chief na
tional security adviser, denied any impropriety,
but acknowledged he received the money. He
said he "intercepted" it to avoid causing em
barrassment to Mrs. Reagan and the journalists,
then put it in a safe and forgot about it until oth
ers discovered it during an office move.
Ulster MPs 'cry havoc'
London — Protestant Ulster Unionist politi
cians yesterday disrupted the British Par
liament, vowed to bring local government in
British-ruled Northern Ireland to a standstill
and threatened to set up their own security
force there following Saturday's assassination of
a hard-line Unionist member of Parliament, the
Rev. Robert Bradford, by Irish nationalist ter
rorists.
At the same time, police in Britain launched a
massive around-the-clock search of hundreds
of thousands of garages, businesses and aban
doned homes for up to 500 pounds of ex
plosives they believe have been hidden by pro
visional Irish Republican Army terrorists re
sponsbile for four bombings in the past five
weeks in the London area. The bombings have
killed three people, injured 40 and destroyed
the surburban London home of Britain's at
torney general while he was out of the country.
The search in the London area alone, involv
ing 16,000 police officers with all leaves can
celed for the week it is expected to take, was de
scribed by officials as the biggest ever mounted
here. Large quantities of explosives were found
by police in hiding places here during IRA bom

bing campaigns in London in 1972 and 1976.
In yesterdav's extraordinary disruption of Par
liament, three hard-line Unionist members led
by the Rev lan Paisley were ordered out of the
House of Commons and suspended for the next
five business days after they repeatedly inter
rupted go\eminent statements on Bradford's
killing with shouted accusations blaming Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Northern
Ireland secretary, James Prior, for the sharp rise
in attacks by the Provisional IRA in Northern
Ireland, where four more Protestants, including
Bradford, were killed last week alone.
Paisley and two other members of Parliament
from the Democratic Unionist Party in Belfast,
Peter Robinson and John McQuade, sitting in a
gallery overlooking the Commons chamber,
shouted "rubbish" in response to Prior's call for
calm in Northern Ireland. "You have given us
nothing but the IRA — you are guilty of it," Mc-
Quade shouted at Prior, whom hard-line Prot
estant Unionists have accused with Thatcher of
giving Irish nationalist terrorists encourage
ment by improving British relations with the Re
public of Ireland.
The speaker of the House, George Thomas,
won a voice vote suspending the three
Unionists from Parliament for five days for
"grossly disorderly conduct and ignoring the
authority of the chair."
Actor William Holden dies
Santa Mnnira — William Holden, one of the
movies' most popular leading men for more
than 40 years and an Oscar winner as the cynical
prisoner of war in "Stalag 17," was found dead
yesterday at his apartment, police said.
The 63-year-old actor apparently died of nat
ural causes, police said. There was "no indica
tion" of foul play.
The coroner's examination showed Holden
had been dead for some time; probably as long
as one week.
The manager at Holden's apartment building
— which overlooks the Pacific Ocean — found
the body after he became concerned because
he had not seen or heard from Holden in two or
three weeks, Tapia said.
Holden had not been reported in poor
health, but in the last year there had been re
ports he was going to West Germany to consult
with Dr. Hans Nieper, a cancer expert. Nieper
said at the time he did not think Holden was se
riously ill.
Holden was a close friend of President and
former actor Ronald Reagan. Their friendship
went back to the days in the 1950s when both
were officers in the Screen Actors Guild. Rea
gan went on to become president of SAG.
President Ronald Reagan was "shocked"
when informed of his old friend's death yester
day, said White House spokesman Larry
Speakes in Washington. "What do say
about a longtime friend?" Speakes quoted Rea
gan as saying. "A great sense of personal loss, a
fine man. Our friendship never wa*ied."
Holden and his former wife, Ardis ("Brenda")
Holden, were best man and matron of honor at
the wedding of Ronald Reagan and First Lady
Nancy Reagan.

Court to review sex ruling •
Washington — The Supreme Courj, agreed
yesterday to decide how far states may go in re
stricting the use of children in sex scenes in
movies, plays, books or photographs.
The justices announced that they would rule
on the constitutionality of a New York law that
imposes criminal penaltieson persons who pro
duce, direct or promote sexual performances
by children under 16. The law does not require:
prosecutors to prove that the materials in ques
tion are legally obscene.
The case shapes up as a significant test ofthe
extent to which authorities may take special ac l
tion to combat child pornography or any other
use of children and young teen-agers in sex
scenes.
Lawyers challenging the New York law claim
that it is so restrictive it could be interpreted as
outlawing scenes in many popular movies * —
such as performances by Linda Blair in "The Ex
orcist," Brooke Shields in "Pretty Baby" or Jodie
Foster in "Taxi Driver."
New York officials, however, say movie direc
tors and producers could use adult stand-ins or
sophisticated cutting techniques to depict
those sex scenes without actually requiring
child actresses or actors to participate in the
them.
Kirkland blasts Reagan
New York — AFL-CIO President bane
Kirkland, who started burning his bridges to the
Reagan administration many months ago, yes
terday almost finished the job with a fiery at
tacking speech that brought a standing ovation
from delegates attending the federation's 14th
constitutional convention here.
He said among many other things that the ad
ministration "promised us a boom but brought
us a bust"; has "drained the public purse to
■ lavish welfare on the greedy rich"; has left our
allies in "dismay and division" while indulging
in "the appeasement of the Saudi, financial-in
dustrial complex with gifts of costly and exotic
weapons, paid for in higher oil prices by the
American consumer."
But the administration sent in an emergency
brigade to dampen, if not extinguish, the
rhetorical flames. The Reagan aides, a team of
