# Housing aid to attract faculty
## 
### Jeff Biddulph Adam Goodman 
In what housing officials hope will be a major step for
ward for faculty recruitment here, the University Admin
istrative Council last night passed the Housing Allow
ance Program, will provide supplementary income to
professors to be used towards monthly mortgage
payments on housing.
The program will take effect in the 1982-83 school year.
Despite questions from members of the council about
the program's lack of consideration for financial need,
the measure passed unanimously, according to William
Massy, vice president for business and finance, who is a
member of the council. The Administrative Council is
made up of the vice presidents of each department of
the university.
HAP was initiated to mitigate the effects of housing
prices in the area, which are among the highest in the
country.
HAP will cost the university an extra $2.25 million next
year, according to Robin Hamill, director of housing.
Funds may come from the staff benefits pool, which is
supported by government grants. An alternative source
is revenues from the sale of the Peter Coutts con
dominiums, a faculty housing project sponsored by the
Housing Department, which will be opened next year,
Hamill said.
Housing officials expected, and received, little opposi
tion to the program, which has been in thedevelopment
stages since May.
A few members of the Administrative Council ob
jected, however, that the program fails to fully consider a
professors' financial situation when making them
eligible for HAP. The program will provide funds to fac
ulty members wholly on the basis of tenure and salary;

financial assets and spouse's salaries will not be taken
into account.
"When you consider other assets you are opening a
whole new can of worms," said Hamill. "We wanted to
avoid this problem."
The fund was originally suggested to encourage new
professors to come to the university, and money will be
allotted in an attempt to make salaries here equal to, or
higher than, salaries of professors in other areas of the
country where housing prices are lower.
Money will be appropriated according to next year's
salaries, and must be used to pay for monthly mortgage
payments on new houses. Amounts run from $3,565 for
faculty members earning $22,400, to $8,379 for those
earning $70,000 and above.
"We have figured it so that a professor who is making
$70,000 in another area of the country will not be dis
couraged to move to Stanford'/' said Hamill. "He will be
making, in effect, $78,379 here."
The amount of money given will decrease by one-sev
enth each year that a faculty member participates in the
program, so that at the end of seven years he will no
longer receive funds.
Faculty members involved in the program must own
the home to receive the money, and each member is al
lowed three years to begin buying a home.
Hamill notes that the program is "targeted for re
cruits," and that new professors will benefit most from
the program. Any assistant, associate or full professor,
and certain senior staff members, who came to Stanford
after the beginning of the 1979 school year are eligible.
"I am very happy that the program has passed," said
Hamill. "I think tha* this will make recruiting professors
easier for every department of the university."

The University's mascot advisory
panel yesterday agreed with an ASSU
recommendation and voted by con
sensus to recommend to President
Donald Kennedy that the color
Cardinal be permanently adopted as
the University symbol.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, who heads the 16-member
mascot committee, said he would
send the panel's recommendation to
Kennedy and said he hoped Ken
nedy would announce a decision
sometime this week before Big
Game.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to
the president, confirmed that Ken
nedy had already drafted a letter an

eligible for HAP. The program will provide funds to fac
ulty members wholly on the basis of tenure and salary;

financial assets and spouse's salaries will not be taken
into account.
"When you consider other assets you are opening a
whole new can of worms," said Hamill. "We wanted to
avoid this problem."
The fund was originally suggested to encourage new
professors to come to the university, and money will be
allotted in an attempt to make salaries here equal to, or
higher than, salaries of professors in other areas of the
country where housing prices are lower.
Money will be appropriated according to next year's
salaries, and must be used to pay for monthly mortgage
payments on new houses. Amounts run from $3,565 for
faculty members earning $22,400, to $8,379 for those
earning $70,000 and above.
"We have figured it so that a professor who is making
$70,000 in another area of the country will not be dis
couraged to move to Stanford'/' said Hamill. "He will be
making, in effect, $78,379 here."
The amount of money given will decrease by one-sev
enth each year that a faculty member participates in the
program, so that at the end of seven years he will no
longer receive funds.
Faculty members involved in the program must own
the home to receive the money, and each member is al
lowed three years to begin buying a home.
Hamill notes that the program is "targeted for re
cruits," and that new professors will benefit most from
the program. Any assistant, associate or full professor,
and certain senior staff members, who came to Stanford
after the beginning of the 1979 school year are eligible.
"I am very happy that the program has passed," said
Hamill. "I think tha* this will make recruiting professors
easier for every department of the university."
