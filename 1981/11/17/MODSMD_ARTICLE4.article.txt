meeting. However, she said Kennedy
had not yet approved a final copy of
the letter and was waiting for the
committee's recommendation. Ken
nedy is currently out of town and will
not return until tomorrow.
According to Andy Geiger, athletic
director and committee member,
"the students have expressed them
selves and have placed the ball in
Donald Kennedy's court."
At the meeting the committee did
not discuss any other mascot choice
except for the Cardinal symbol.
Lyons defended the group's actions
in only considering the ASSU's rec
ommendation at the meeting, and
said, "(The LJniversity mascot com
mittee) is not a committee to gener
ate ideas but to receive them.
"No other serious proposals used
the mechanism the Association
created," Lyons said. "Throughout
these (elections) the Cardinal has
persisted."
The ASSU's recommendation of
the color Cardinal followed a nine
year effort to find a mascot for the
University after the use of "Indians"
was abolished by Stanford President
Richard Lyman in 1972.

Last year the ASSU attempted to
get various mascot choices onto the
spring election bailot but failed be
cause there was not enough student
interest and no mascot group
gathered enough signatures to quali
fy. Lyons called the mascot "the
greatest non-issue of all time."
In the fall election last month stu
dents selected Cardinal as their top
choice with 970 votes. Other mascot
selections included Tree with 826
votes, Gryphon with 655 votes and
Robber Baron with 310 write-in
votes. Indians received 82 write-in
votes.
In a closer vote, an additional ques
tion on the fall ballot,"Would you be
satisfied with the color Cardinal as
the University symbol," received
1763 "yes" and 1718 "no" votes. Fol
lowing the election, ASSU members
said they believed the vote gave
them enough of a student consensus
of opinion to recommend Cardinal.
Lyons said the University commit
tee was necessary because the "As
sociation by itself could not claim
University consensus" on the issue.
