# Indictments for registration resistance claimed

The first indictments against a select groupof
108 men who failed to register with the Selec
tive Service System are expected within the
next several weeks, according to Matt Nico
demus of Stanford Against Conscription (SAC).
Other sources indicated that the various lo
cal offices may wait to issue indictments until
the Military Man Power Task Force makes its
recommendations to President Ronald Rea
gan The task force is examining several aspects
of the all-volunteer army, including regis
tration, said Doug Bandow, special assistant to
the president for policy development.
The names of 108 non-registrants were sent
by the U.S. Justice Department to local U.S. at
torneys in September with instructions to in
vestigate the individuals within their area and
determine whether or not they actually regis
tered, according to Bill Smith of the National
Laywer's Guild's Selective Service Panel and a
draft law specialist from Los Angeles.

Ffowever, Nicodemus said that because the
individual cases are being handled by local U.S.
attorney offices across the country — each of
which has its own autonomy — no single date
can be specified.
Smith said that three-quarters of the 108 had
written the Justice Department of their failure
to register, and the other names had been sent
to the Justice Department by informants who
knew of the non-registrants. Smith confirmed
Nicodemus' contention that indictments may
be out in December or January.
Bandow said the task force had no specific
deadlines, but would probably be making its
recommendations to the president by the end
of December. He said he hoped that the local
attorneys offices would wait until after the rec
ommendations were made before going ahead
with the indictments, but added that he had
"no control over it."
"My guess is that if a decision to end regis
tration was made there wouldn t be any reason
to enforce it," Bandow said.

According to Nicodemus, unless a bill which
allows the Justice Department to cross-check
names of registrants wtih social security and In
ternal Revenue Service lists is passed in Con
gress, the Justice Department will have no way
of finding the remaining thousands of non-reg
istrants.
Smith said that two letters warning the indi
viduals under investigation to register im
mediately have already been recieved by non
registrants. He said the first indictments could
be expected in the the Midwest, rather than in
California, where the second warning letters
have most recently been mailed out.
"If they do prosecute, they'll probably use
the prosecutions as a means of scaring those
who have not registered into registering,"
Smith said.
"The key idea is that there are over 800,000
non-registrants by selective service estimates.
They can not possibly prosecute that many,"
said Fred Moore, who works for the National

Resistance Committee out of Berkeley.
"The point is these selective service cases are
highly political," Moore said. "The whole
process of this is to try arid intimidate draft re
sisters. We're trying to say we we're not in
timidated," Moore said.
According to Nicodemus, SAC plans to have
a rally in White Plaza the day after the first in
dictment comes down, regardless of what state
the indictment is in, or what day.
He said the purpose of such a rally would be
to show support andtoshow Stanford non-reg
istrants the concrete ways in which SAC can
help them. Nicodemus mentioned helping an
individual to get the information he might
need, personal and legal cousel, and economic
help as among the services which SAC could
provide for non-registrants.
Nicodemus and Sushma Govindarajulu of
SAC both said they had no way of knowing
how many Stanford students failed to reg
ister."They're usually pretty quiet about it,"
Govindarajulu said.
