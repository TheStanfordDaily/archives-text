## Sino-Soviet border remains tense after years of feuding 
### Washington Post 
Beijing — The soldiers who
patrol both sides of the Sino-
Soviet border are bracing for
another frigid Siberian winter
of watching each other across
the world's most heavily milita
rized boundary line.
Their lonely vigil along the
icy, 4500-mile frontier aptly
symbolizes the cool relations
between their two communist
capitals whose friendshipin the
1950s set the capitalist West on
edge.
Despite occasional feelers by
both sides to resume border
talks — the most recent pro
posal was made by the Kremlin
in September — Sino-Soviet re
lations today remain badly
snagged by memories of be
trayal, competition for interna
tional influence and a common
sense of danger dramatized by
the standoff of morethana mil
lion Chinese and Soviet troops
on the frontier.
Although Beijing claims it is
"studying" the latest Soviet ov
erture, foreign and Chinese
analysts give the proposal no
more chance of untangling the
17-year-old dispute than Bei
jing's last offer in June, which
only restated old demands.
Protest troops
Beijing called off general
normalization talks with Mos
cow after Soviet troops in
vaded Afghanistan in Decem

ber 1979 and has warned that it
will continue to snub the
Kremlin as long as Moscow's
80,000 troops continue to oc
cupy China's southwestern
neighbor.
More specific border nego
tiations held separately from
the broad normalization talks
have been stalemated for years
on the Chinese demand that
both sides first withdraw their
forces from the disputed areas
— a condition the Soviets re
ject because they hold most of
the land in question.
Moscow's conclusion of a
boundary treaty with Afghan
istan in June angered the Chi
nese, who claim the territory
covered by the agreement was
stolen from China by czarist
Russia in the 19th century.
Haig visit
Moscow in turn became ir
ritated after U.S. Secretary of
State Alexander Haig visited
Beijing in June and unveiled
plans to consider arms sales to
China that could strengthen
greatly its border defenses.
An influential Chinese ana
lyst views the latest Soviet over
ture as an effort to "drive a
wedge between the Americans
and Chinese" to head off the
growing military relationship
between the two Soviet ad
versaries.
Although the border clearly
remains the flash point of Sino-

Soviet relations, Beijing seems
far less preoccupied with the
Soviet threat from the north to
day than in the 19605, when
Chinese citizens were ex
horted to dig underground
tunnels as a precaution against
Soviet attack.
Cold War view
However, Chinese officials
often seem to be reciting old
cold war speeches of John
Foster Dulles in describing the
Soviet threat and the need to
contain it. They even espouse a
Chinese domino theory, warn
ing that failure to "pin down"
the Soviets in Afghanistan and
the Vietnamese in Cambodia
will just whet the Soviet ap
petite for Thailand, Pakistan,
Iran, the Persian Gulf states and
the Strait of Malacca.
The Chinese have been ac
tive in trying to strenghten
japan's commitment to military
spending, feeling that greater
strength against the Soviets
outweighs any potential dan
ger to China.
Western diplomats believe
that there are some Chinese of
ficials who want instead to im
prove relations with Moscow.
It is their hope to increase Bei
jing's leverage in dealing with
the United States on issues of
vital concern, such as Washing
ton's policy toward Taiwan.
