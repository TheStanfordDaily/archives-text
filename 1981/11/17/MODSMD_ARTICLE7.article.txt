N'Djamena, Chad (AP) — Zairian para
troopers, the first group of a pan-African peace
keeping force, arrived here Sunday, as Libyan
soldiers who invaded under orders of Col.
Moammar Khadafy departed this war-torn cen
tral African nation.
The Libyan news agency JANA did not report
the Zairians' arrival but said that rebel insurgents
and their Sudanese allies took the eastern Cha
dian towns of Karida, Adri and Ariba and were
advancing on the town of Umsweir as Libyans
withdrew.
About 300 Zairians wearing green jungle
fatigues and shouldering M-16 rifles marched
across a dusty runway at the airport of the Cha
d/an capital. They passed a ragtag line of about
200 Libyan soldiers who clutched plastic bags
stuffed with belongings, waiting to board home

bound planes.
Later, in a Tripoli-dated dispatch, JANA
quoted government officials assaying all the Lib
yans withdrew except for one contingent in
eastern Chad, slated for withdraw yesterday.
JANA said preparations were being made in
the southern Libyan city of Sebha to welcome
home the troops who performed an "historic
and humanitarian role by ending the Chadian
civil war."
The last group of troops was to be withdrawn
by truck convoy.
The Zaireans flew in on two planes from
Kinshasa, Zaire, and were met by Co I.

more than a year with rebel forces of former De
