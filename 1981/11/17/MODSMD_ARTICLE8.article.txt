# Soldier describes life in Afghan army

### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi, India — A rare glimpse of life
inside the beleaguered Afghan army, con
tained in a diplomatic report received
here, reveals growing strength among re
sistance fighters in central Afghanistan but
also hints that the army's recent recall of
military veterans may have been more suc
cessful than previously thought.
The account of the Afghan army's strug
gle against the countrywide insurgency is
considered especially significant because
it was obtained during an unusual direct
meeting with an Afghan soldier, the
diplomat's report said.
The soldier, a reservist caught in the
sweeping call-up announced by the Sovi
et-backed Marxist regime on Sept. 7, told
diplomats that his unit was ambushed
twice while on an extended patrol into the
central province of Oruzgan. At one point
he said his unit was besieged for 10 days by
resistance fighters in the provincial capital.
The siege was lifted only when rein
forcements arrived from Kabul, thesoldier
said. Three Afghan soldiers were killed and
five or six wounded in the battle to break
the encirclement, according to the ac
count.
The Afghan soldier's convoy was am

bushed while returning to Kabul, but the
unit was unable to counterattack because
the guerrilla fighters were hidden in sur
rounding trees, according to the account.
The soldier reported that most of
Oruzgan town's civilian population had
fled to Pakistan and that economic activity
there had virtually ceased.
The unit had conducted one other pa
trol, to Gardez, 70 miles south of Kabul,
during the two-month period, diplomats
said.
Contrary to previous reports, the soldier
indicated that a large number of men were
successfully reinducted into the army dur
ing the September military call-up, aimed
at replenishing the ranks of the army,
which has been weakened by casualties,
desertion and repeated purges during the
last three years.
Afghan army strength, roughly 80,000
when the Marxists seized power in April
1978, is estimated b Western military ana
lysts to be about 30,000 now.
The soldier described how many young
men who fled urban areas to avoid the re
call found life in the mountains too dif
ficult and eventually returned to give
themselves up.

Government authorities, needing men,
were said to have accepted the excuse of
the draft dodgers that they had "been out
of touch" and quickly assigned them to
units.
While government authorities told him
he would have to serve only three months,
the soldier said he had resigned himself to
a tour of at least one year.
Rebuilding the battered Afghan army
into a force that by itself can defend the
unpopular Soviet-backed regime of Presi
dent Babrak Karmal is considered a prere
quisite for any substantial withdrawal of
the estimated 85,000 Soviet troops in Af
ghanistan.
While attempting to strengthen the low
er ranks with the recent draft recall, the
army reportedly has sent some top officers
to Moscow for a six-month military staff
training course.
The Afghan defense minister, Gen.
Mohammed Rafi, and three other senior
military leaders, including a deputy de
fense minister and the air force com
mander, have all been in Moscow since
September receiving training, according
to a separate Western diplomatic report.
