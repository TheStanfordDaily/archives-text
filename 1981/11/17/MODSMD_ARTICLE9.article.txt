## The 						PATCH project promotes energy conservation attitudes

Did you know that a one
eighth inch crack around the
perimeter of one door repre
sents an air passage the size of a ,
basketball?
Or that fluorescent lights use
two to three times less energy
than incandescent bulbs for
the same amount of light and
last 12 times as long?
Or that California tax laws al
low an income tax credit equal
to 40 percent of the purchav
and installation costs of energy
conservation measures?

The PATCH goals
were to provide
consumer
information and
promote the sale of
low-cost
conservation
devices, such as
faucet aerators and
water-saving
showerheads,
through food
cooperatives.

These facts are among
dozens of simple energy-sav
ing tips compiled in a pamphlet
written by the PATCH project.
PATCH (Practical Applications
of Teaching Conservation in
the Household) was designed
by Stanford students Teresa
Bertsch and Nancy Lindborg,
both liberal arts graduates,
along with Karl Johnson and
john Eaton. All four were em
ployees at the Stanford Hous
ing Energy Conservation Cen
ter in May 1980 when they ap
plied for and were awarded a
federal grant to promote
energy conservation in the
community.
Energy pamphlet
Their pamphlet, entitled "It
May Not Be Your House, But
. . . It's Your Utility Bill" in
cludes simple suggestions for
energy savings and instructions
for performing a home energy
audit.
Lindborg and Bertsch out

lined the double focus of the
project. The PATCH goals were
to provide consumer informa
tion and promote the sale of
low-cost conservation devices,
such as faucet aerators and wa
ter-saving showerheads,
through food cooperatives.
The group works through
food cooperatives because co
ops are already organized to
lower living costs and provide
consumer information un
available at franchise markets.
"In the face of inflationary
energy costs and diminishing
resources, co-ops are becom
ing interested in stocking low
cost conservation devices,"
said Lindborg.
Co-operative focus
Throughout 1980, PATCH
operated within a single store
— the Menlo Park Briarpatch
cooperative. They staffed a
"resource center" for cus
tomer counseling, designed a
series of "shelf talker fact
sheets," and conducted work
shops in members' homes.
The California Energy Ex
tension Service projected a to
tal dollar savings of $90,000 per
year through conservation,
more than twice the federal in
vestment in the grant. More
than 1500 of the larger, low
cost energy conservation de
vices were sold by the store,
while the store itself reduced
its energy use by 16 percent
through simple conservation
measures.
In 1981, the group received a
second grant to expand the
PATCH strategy to reach other
cooperatives throughout the
state. This included stores in
Berkeley, Palo Alto, Davis and
Areata.
The key goal of the 1981
project team was to convince
the Associated Co-ops Ware
house, the distributor of Co-op
label products, to stock the
conservation devices. Smaller
stores with limited buying
power and staff time could
then carry these devices. Other
larger cooperatives, including
the California Ave. Co-op in
Palo Alto, have already stocked
many of these devices.

Fnthusiasm
Stephen Avis, community re
lations coordinator for the Palo
Alto store, complimented the
PATCH members on their en
thusiasm and knowledge:
"They provided the back
ground in research and materi-

als needed to get the concept
off the ground. Our own
earlier attempt failed — now
our store is profiting from the
energy management strategies
PATCH recommended."
PATCH expects an end to
federal funding by December
1981. In an attempt to keep the
program alive, Bertsch and
Lindborg ae compiling a
"Manual for Co-op Conserva
tion," including sample news
letter articles, shelf labeling in
formation, and a catalogue of
the energy conservation de
vices and suppliers.
Lindborg, who still works at
the Stanford Housing Energy
Conservation Center, said that
students are less likely than
homeowners or renters to con
sider conservation. "Since they
never see a utility bill, many as
sume that their efforts don't
matter," she said. Never
theless, students have saved
nearly $600,000 in five years by
reducing energy use in re
sponse to HECC programs.
