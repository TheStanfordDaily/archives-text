# Dean Lyons speaks on Zeta Psi decision
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons told members of the ASSU
Senate last night that he felt "com
fortable" with the University's posi
tion in their dealings with Zeta Psi
Fraternity, "if it prevents recurrence
of the pattern of behavior that got
people into trouble."
Lyons spoke on the subject of indi
vidual and group rights at Stanford
during the meeting and also fielded
questions from senators. Some of the
questions referred specifically to the
University's suspension of Zeta Psi
Oct. 29 when Zeta Psi members were
told by Norm Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, that
they wduld have to vacate their
house by Dec. 19.
In response to pointed question
ing by several senators, Lyons said he
believed the University had the
power and the reason to carry out the
procedures used in the Zeta Psi sus
pension. "I can't say any Zete could
look at the evidence and feel they
were not treated fairly. They had
fairness to the point of ad nauseum."
According to Lyons, >n I y
fraternities (and sororities) are al
lowed the privilege of "subjectively"
selecting their own members for
their residences.

112 President Donald Kennedy yes
terday released the statement,
mentioned m yesterday's Daily,
formally reaffirming that Stanford
athletic teams "will be repre
sented and symbolized exclusive
ly by the color Cardinal."
"While various other mascots
have been suggested and then al
lowed to wither, the color has
continued to serve us well, as it
has for 90 years. .

"In exchange for that privilege the
group assumes responsibility for the
individuals within that group," for
activities "intrinsic to the group,"
Lyons said. Fraternity members can
lose their group rights for actions un
der "collective responsibility" but
still retain their individual student
rights as guaranteed by the Fun
damental Standard.
However, Lyons admitted that the
University "goofed" by including in
their decision the requirement that
no two Zetes live in the same Univer
sity residence. "We shouldn't have
done that," he said. "We were trying
to illustrate that we didn't want them
to move out of one place and into an
other."
The University currently has no
guidelines for University/group rela
tions but must rely on contractual
agreements and "unwritten assump
tions," Lyons said.
Also at the meeting, senators ap
propriated $400 from the senate dis
cretionary fund to add to a $400
Council of Presidents appropriation
and a $200 contribution from the
ASSU financial manager's discre
tionary fund to purchase whistles in
response to the recent rash of rapes
occurring on campus. More than
3000 whistles have been purchased in
a first shipment. ASSU members
hope student groups will help to pay
the cost of the whistles which will be
distributed without charge.
The ASSU will begin distributing
the whistles at their "Personal Safety
on Campus" forum, 8 p.m. tonight in
Kresge Auditorium. Speakers will be
from the Department of Public Safe
ty, the Rape Education Project, Stan
ford Women's Center, the ASSU
Safety Commission which was
created last night, Students United
for Rape Elimination (S.U.R.E.), and
Cowell Health Center.
