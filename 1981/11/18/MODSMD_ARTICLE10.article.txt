## Bill Peatman Get hungry, not apathetic 
### 
As this year's Fast Day approaches,
I find myself moved once again by
some vague compassion for the hun
gry people of the world. As informa
tion comes my way telling of the
earth's human travesties ocurring
from East Africa to East Palo Alto, my
ears are propped and my interest
peaked for a week of awareness and a
day of action in the interest of al
leviating large-scale human suffer
ing.
This will, then, be my annual peri
od of corn ':tion that there is some
thing v\ rong with the world.
While rougM; 500 people are starv
ing, more than 40 percent of the peo
ple in the United Statesarechronical
ly overweight. Also, the United States
imports I') of the world's tuna supp
ly; and 1 3 of our tuna is used to make
cat food.
Statistics aside, I see error in my
own attitude towards the world. I
find it much easier to acknoweldge
the problem of world hunger than to
participate in the solution. It is
strange that, in a country where we
clamor for justice, there is such
apathy towards worldwide injustice.
It seems that, if we are to insist on
justice, we should be definition be
intolerant of injustice. But we do to
lerate injustice,xwe eat, drink, and
spend in abundance while fellow hu
mans expire from lack of food. Yes,
there is something very wrong with
this world.
Personally, I find that my concern
for justice rarely extends beyond my
own life. At Stanford, I've become
very goal-oriented and I refuse to al
low anything to interrupt the pursuit
of mv self-interest. Certainly I get up
set when I feel I've been treated un
fairly. But what, then, of others'
dignity? And how do I respond when
others cannot fulfill their most basic
desires, like the desire to eat?
In terms of human dignity, I con
sider myself to be intrinsically valu
able. Again, it would follow that all
people are equally as valuable, and
thus deserve the same standard of liv
ing that I think that I deserve. I be
leve that this is true, but such equal
ity does not seem to exist.
In the United States, each citizen
cor.iumes at least five times the grain
tha T a person in a developing country
eats. There is wide-spread depriva
tion oi human needs on this planet.
Something must be wrong with our
v>orld.
Each November, the Stanford

Committee on Hunger suggests that
we consider being concerned about
a suffering humanity rather than be
mesmerized in writing our own suc
cess stories. I don't have problems
with being concerned. It's easy for
me to convince myself that all hu
mans are inherently valuable. I be
lieve in a God who creates each per
son uniquely and loves each person
supremely.
I live in a nation formed on the
principle that all men are created
equal — allowing every individual
the right to take part in the for
mulation of government practices
and policies. But I do not regard ev
ery person as supremely valuable,
and I am uninformed and uninvolved
in matters of government. What is it
that's wrong with this world?

Certainly I get upset when I feel I've been
treated unfairly. But what, then, of others'
dignity? And how do I respond when others
cannot fulfill their most basic desires, like the
desire to eat?

There is the basis and there are the
resources for responding to the
large-scale injustices that cripple
much of the world. We can become
aware of congressional decisionsthat
affect U.S. policy towards developing
countries: then we can urge our rep
resentatives to vote in favor of hu
mane policy decisions. We can pray
for God's help and mercy for unjustly
oppressed peoples. Perhaps we can
even become aware of and change
our own wasteful consumption pat
terns.
When I began this article, I saw my
self as a voice in the wilderness call
ing an infidel humanity back to
brotherly benevolence. But as I
write, I see how hypocritical that
would be. So I am using this column
to persuade myself and others that
world hunger is a matter worth of our
time, energy and money.
The November 24 Fast could easily
become an exercise in collective
guilt eradication. After acknowledg
ing that starving people are worthy of
our concern, the logical next step
would be to express that concern in
some tangible way. Changes in at
titude are important, but are not
ends in themselves. Attitudinal shifts

are, I hope, the foundation for con
sistent change in lifestyle.
The jump from a passive to an ac
tive concern for the world is a hard
one. I think that I have yet to make
that move. But I am becoming in
creasingly convinced of the necessity
of such a change. The Fast Day's Sur
rounding activities provide a fairly le
nient chance to become better in
formed on the issue of world hunger.
The Fast itself is a way that we can act
on what we learn.
In a way, the structure of the Fast
Day is very contrived: there are many
programs designed to heighten
awareness of world suffering, and the
painless process of turning a meal
card lets us display our compassion
for the needy of our community,
country and world.

The Fast Day is indeed a chance to
be concerned for the world in a con
crete way, and it is an opportunity
handed to us on a silver platter. But if
we do not take the opportunity now,
under the best of circumstances,
when will we take it? Starving people
cannot very much afford to wait until
it is convenient for us to recognize
the injustice of our indulgences.
Something is seriously wrong with
the world. At Stanford we have the
extraordinary freedom to choose
how we will be educated. To a large
extent, what we learn will determine
what kind of people we will become.
So far, I have chosen to learn about
books and their authors, and have
sought very little information on is
sues addressing life outside of Stan
ford.
As a result, I'm generally apathetic
to the suffering peoples of the world.
Yes, there is something very wrong
with the world. I am what's wrong
with the world, and until I decide that
there's any reason to act differently,
the world will be slow to change.

Yes, there is something very wrong
with the world. I am what's wrong
with the world, and until I decide that
there's any reason to act differently,
the world will be slow to change.

As this year's Fast Day approaches,
I find myself moved once again by
some vague compassion for the hun
gry people of the world. As informa
tion comes my way telling of the
earth's human travesties ocurring
from East Africa to East Palo Alto, my
ears are propped and my interest
peaked for a week of awareness and a
day of action in the interest of al
leviating large-scale human suffer
ing.
This will, then, be my annual peri
od of corn ':tion that there is some
thing v\ rong with the world.
While rougM; 500 people are starv
ing, more than 40 percent of the peo
ple in the United Statesarechronical
ly overweight. Also, the United States
imports I') of the world's tuna supp
ly; and 1 3 of our tuna is used to make
cat food.
Statistics aside, I see error in my
own attitude towards the world. I
find it much easier to acknoweldge
the problem of world hunger than to
participate in the solution. It is
strange that, in a country where we
clamor for justice, there is such
apathy towards worldwide injustice.
It seems that, if we are to insist on
justice, we should be definition be
intolerant of injustice. But we do to
lerate injustice,xwe eat, drink, and
spend in abundance while fellow hu
mans expire from lack of food. Yes,
there is something very wrong with
this world.
Personally, I find that my concern
for justice rarely extends beyond my
own life. At Stanford, I've become
very goal-oriented and I refuse to al
low anything to interrupt the pursuit
of mv self-interest. Certainly I get up
set when I feel I've been treated un
fairly. But what, then, of others'
dignity? And how do I respond when
others cannot fulfill their most basic
desires, like the desire to eat?
In terms of human dignity, I con
sider myself to be intrinsically valu
able. Again, it would follow that all
people are equally as valuable, and
thus deserve the same standard of liv
ing that I think that I deserve. I be
leve that this is true, but such equal
ity does not seem to exist.
In the United States, each citizen
cor.iumes at least five times the grain
tha T a person in a developing country
eats. There is wide-spread depriva
tion oi human needs on this planet.
Something must be wrong with our
v>orld.
Each November, the Stanford

Committee on Hunger suggests that
we consider being concerned about
a suffering humanity rather than be
mesmerized in writing our own suc
cess stories. I don't have problems
with being concerned. It's easy for
me to convince myself that all hu
mans are inherently valuable. I be
lieve in a God who creates each per
son uniquely and loves each person
supremely.
I live in a nation formed on the
principle that all men are created
equal — allowing every individual
the right to take part in the for
mulation of government practices
and policies. But I do not regard ev
ery person as supremely valuable,
and I am uninformed and uninvolved
in matters of government. What is it
that's wrong with this world?

Certainly I get upset when I feel I've been
treated unfairly. But what, then, of others'
dignity? And how do I respond when others
cannot fulfill their most basic desires, like the
desire to eat?

There is the basis and there are the
resources for responding to the
large-scale injustices that cripple
much of the world. We can become
aware of congressional decisionsthat
affect U.S. policy towards developing
countries: then we can urge our rep
resentatives to vote in favor of hu
mane policy decisions. We can pray
for God's help and mercy for unjustly
oppressed peoples. Perhaps we can
even become aware of and change
our own wasteful consumption pat
terns.
When I began this article, I saw my
self as a voice in the wilderness call
ing an infidel humanity back to
brotherly benevolence. But as I
write, I see how hypocritical that
would be. So I am using this column
to persuade myself and others that
world hunger is a matter worth of our
time, energy and money.
The November 24 Fast could easily
become an exercise in collective
guilt eradication. After acknowledg
ing that starving people are worthy of
our concern, the logical next step
would be to express that concern in
some tangible way. Changes in at
titude are important, but are not
ends in themselves. Attitudinal shifts

are, I hope, the foundation for con
sistent change in lifestyle.
The jump from a passive to an ac
tive concern for the world is a hard
one. I think that I have yet to make
that move. But I am becoming in
creasingly convinced of the necessity
of such a change. The Fast Day's Sur
rounding activities provide a fairly le
nient chance to become better in
formed on the issue of world hunger.
The Fast itself is a way that we can act
on what we learn.
In a way, the structure of the Fast
Day is very contrived: there are many
programs designed to heighten
awareness of world suffering, and the
painless process of turning a meal
card lets us display our compassion
for the needy of our community,
country and world.

The Fast Day is indeed a chance to
be concerned for the world in a con
crete way, and it is an opportunity
handed to us on a silver platter. But if
we do not take the opportunity now,
under the best of circumstances,
when will we take it? Starving people
cannot very much afford to wait until
it is convenient for us to recognize
the injustice of our indulgences.
Something is seriously wrong with
the world. At Stanford we have the
extraordinary freedom to choose
how we will be educated. To a large
extent, what we learn will determine
what kind of people we will become.
So far, I have chosen to learn about
books and their authors, and have
sought very little information on is
sues addressing life outside of Stan
ford.
As a result, I'm generally apathetic
to the suffering peoples of the world.
Yes, there is something very wrong
with the world. I am what's wrong
with the world, and until I decide that
there's any reason to act differently,
