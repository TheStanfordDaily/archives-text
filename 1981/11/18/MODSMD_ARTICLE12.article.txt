## Pro-lifers should condemn all deaths 
### 
In his column on abortion (Daily, Nov. 10), Michael
Olvera castigates pro-choice advocates for "failing to ad
dress the real issue." He then, correctly I believe, rejects
the calculus by which life's beginning point is de
termined and the notion that abortion is not really the
taking of human life. To his credit he also sees the con
nection between the right to life of an unborn child and
the rights to life we should respect in Guatemalan
peasants and other victims of our militarism and the lack
of respect for life evident in our acceptance of poverty.
But I think he gets things backwards when he asks,
"How can we really address these issues when we allow
the death of our fellow children?" The real question is,
rather, why should women be singled out as the only
group whose killings are condemned by a society which
considers other killing necessary as a matter of policy
and even indifference? And, what is he willing to do and
to convince society to do that would allow a woman satis
factory choices other than abortion? The law which fails
to be consistent in its concern for the "right" to life, will
discriminate against women because they do not have
the political clout of the Pentagon. A law passed by a so
ciety which is unwilling to recognize or assume its re
sponsibilities for the reception of life, and for the future
of the woman who bears that new life, will only com
pound human misery.
I believe that abortion is a major issue for us because
our hands are red with blood. We know that the Cold
War kills the innocent, including a disproportionate
number of women, children and babies. We know that
poverty and economic injustice has destroyed lives and

twisted souls. We know that both military violence and
economic oppression have been employed foe tawdry
and indefensible reasons. But to face these issues we
must look deeply at ourselves and the very structures of
our existence.
It is so much easier to sentimentalize this guilt into an
obsession with abortion. Mind you, I am glad that we
have not been allowed to pass off this taking of life as
though it were not killing, only a clinical procedure. We,
and the women who face the question of aborting a
fetus, should know that the taking of life is involved. I
would hope that no one would do that for mere "conve
nience." But it is also very easy to regard someone else's
hopes and dreams, fears and anxieties and conscience as
unimportant, and until we are prepared to care about
both the fetus and the mother, we have no right to ask
her to suffer for us.
Prohibiting killing done by women in abortion cannot
be seen as a first step in the eliminating of all killing. In
terms of the "right to life," fetuses have better advocates
in their executioners than any of the other victims of so
cietally sanctioned killing. If, as is possible, abortion is a
sign of some essential sickness in modern society, it is the
least sign of its type. Any cure must start elsewhere and
work back, not take advantage of sexist prejudices and
sentimentality to make women suffer for our sins. A soci
ety which has decided that missiles are more important
than school lunches has no right to deny women the
right to choose abortions or even to lament that choice.
