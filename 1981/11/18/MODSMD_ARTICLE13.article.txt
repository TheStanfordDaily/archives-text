## Anti-American marches might produce disarmed Europe 
### 
in Rome last week ! unknowingly
stumbled upon 300,000 demonstrat
ors marching against the proposed
placement of U.S. missiles in Western
Europe. Posters and buttons pro
claimed many different slogans,
however, the message was the same
— the missiles are adamantly op
posed by a large sector of the Italian
populas. And the segment is not
unique to ltal> as finds while
traveling through and as was
indicated by si' l ' ar r« .sin England,

Belguim, France, and West Germany.
Being an American amongst
300,000 anti-Americans was not only
uncomfortable but it allowed me to
gain an insight into the fears and
hopes of the Europeans. Although
many objections were voiced, the
most prominent fear was undoubted
ly that of Europe becoming a play
ground for the United States and
Russia. Moreover, what became
clear was that for Americans it is vir
tually impossible to understand the

situation and the anxiety of currently
engulfing Europe, for we live not
'only in a different continent but a dif
ferent world.
After being lambasted in a lan
guage I only half-understood by a
woman who repeatedly stressed that
we would not want the missiles in our
backyards, my intitial response was
"Go ahead, protect yourself."
But as the defensive anger sub
sided and I began to think about her
words, the questions arose: are the
missiles really necessary, when will
there be enough, and most im
portantly, will they ever be used?
The latter question possesses only
a paradoxical answer. If indeed we
plan to use them, the fears surfacing
in Europe are well-founded and must
be attended. On the other hands, if
we do not plan to use them, which

seems to be the consensus, what is
the real value of the missiles?
Obviously one can argue their de
terrance value, but in a world loaded
with time-bombs when does one
have enough deterrance? And as the
marchers so loudly asked, when does
the senseless buildup cease? Will
there ever be enough, or will there
just always be too much?
One reads the words of Presidents
Ronald Reagan and Leonid Brezhnev
both proclaiming no intention of
provoking or being involved in a nu
clear war, and the absurdity of the
present arms race, and the need for
more missiles, becomes enough to
make F i nnegan's Wake com
prehensible.
Standing amidst a sea of red flags
and numerous posters denouncing
1 'my country, intense anger raged un

til I realized the opinion expressed in
Rome is one what we in American do
not, and perhaps cannot, under
stand. America rests safely thousands
of miles away, separated by an ocean,
and most importantly, with the
power vested in its hands. Instead,
the European countries lie helpless in
the middle of the power conflict vir
tually waiting to be deployed as
pawns in a game of winner loses all.
Although Reagan states that in a
nuclear war there would be no win
ners, he fails to realize the European
countries would not only be losers
but losers without a say — powerless
to dictate their own future. Is it any
wonder the U.S. missiles are not wel
come in Europe?
At what point do we stop creating
European land mines "just in case?"
Granted, the United States is not en

gaged in a game of solitaire, but
neither are we playing follow-the
leader. There must always be a first
move and perhaps now is the proper
time for the United States to make a
bold and historically courageous
move.
As the students marched through
Rome the parallels with the Vietnam
marches a decade ago were evident.
And as one thinks about the produc
tive results of those demonstrations,
one wonders if the current marches
might produce similar results. One
wonders and one hopes that maybe
we can live to see a disarmed and
neutral Europe rather than wonder
ing when there will be enough mis
siles in the world.
