## Men must take cultural responsibility for rape 
### 
I was very disturbed by the letter in
Friday's Daily advocating that men be
barred from campusafter dark unless
personally policed by "a certified,
anti-rape escort." The authors
(Jeanne Fleming and Susan Ham
mond) seemed sincere in advocating
that all men be punished for the ex
istence of rape. This is sexism. It is
certainly unfair that women are not
free to move about as they please; it
would also be unfair to so restrict
men. If we become criminals in order
to prevent crime, have we gained or
lost?
The letter's overzealousness, how
ever, should not serve as an excuse
for ignoring its legitimate points. The
authors are justifiably outraged by
women's loss of freedom and by
men's apathy toward the situation.
Men who feel that their only obliga
tion is to refrain from raping must be
challenged to rethink their com
fortable acceptance of a culture that
produces so many rapists — and so
much violence, generally. It is time
for all men to take serious responsi
bility for violence against women.
We must cease to tolerate, in
ourselves and in others, the attitudes
that lead to rape and other violence.
We should respect Fleming's and
Hammond's anger, even if we cannot
respect the way that they expressed

Dangerous planning
I must constantly wonder at the
motivations underlying facilities
planning here on campus. As a mem
ber of the Stanford community for
the past six years, I have watched this
university add many new buildings
and new landscaped malls. It is in
credible to me that in the midst of all
this planning and construction, the
University has not considered and
acted upon the need to increase the
availability of central, well-lighted
parking lots.
The recent rapes on campus once

again remind us that it is unsafe to
walk alone, especially in non-traffic
areas, unlit areas, and areas with
shrubs and bushes. Yet those of us
(and there are many) who drive to
campus have no choice but to park in
such areas. Recent University actions
convince me there is no intention to
deal with this problem.
For example, after Green Library
was completed, the street between it
and Encina wasconverted into a mall.
Would it not have been better to
have a parking lot there for all of us to
use when we go the library at night?
Where are we supposed to park?
I am not arguing against land
scaping — this is a beautiful campus
and I hope it stays that way — but cer
tainly there should be some con

sideration give to practical necessi
ties.

Rowdy Sunday Flicks
Each time this quarter that I have
attended the Sunday Flicks and have
seen a serious or emotional movie I
have come away angry because of
the lack of consideration shown by
members of the audience. People
feel compelled to cheer when they
hear Highland Park, 111., and yell
bitch" when Mary Tyler Moore is
not being very motherly. Fortunately
I had seen Ordinary People before so
I knew how the story went without
having to hear every word. For peo
ple who hadn't seen it before, other
people made "witty" and "charm
ing" comments during the film
which wrecked the mood and ruined
the film. People seem to be going to
the Flicks for a study break
and not'to see the great films that are
being shown this quarter. I hope
people will learn to be more con
siderate of those who go to movies to
be entertained by them, and not by
the people who feel obligated to
voice their opinions during the mov
ies.

Where are we supposed to park?
I am not arguing against land
scaping — this is a beautiful campus
and I hope it stays that way — but cer
tainly there should be some con

sideration give to practical necessi

Rowdy Sunday Flicks
Each time this quarter that I have
attended the Sunday Flicks and have
seen a serious or emotional movie I
have come away angry because of
the lack of consideration shown by
members of the audience. People
feel compelled to cheer when they
hear Highland Park, 111., and yell
bitch" when Mary Tyler Moore is
not being very motherly. Fortunately
I had seen Ordinary People before so
I knew how the story went without
having to hear every word. For peo
ple who hadn't seen it before, other
people made "witty" and "charm
ing" comments during the film
which wrecked the mood and ruined
the film. People seem to be going to
the Flicks for a study break
and not'to see the great films that are
being shown this quarter. I hope
people will learn to be more con
siderate of those who go to movies to
be entertained by them, and not by
the people who feel obligated to
voice their opinions during the mov
ies.
