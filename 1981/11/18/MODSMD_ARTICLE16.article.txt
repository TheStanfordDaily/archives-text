## Elderly align against Reagan 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles— As usual, Maggie Kuhn
was outraged.
What the mother superior of the Gray
Panther movement was incensed about
this time was the forthcoming White
House Conference on Aging, a gathering
Kuhn said "could be a very, very important
event in America — and it could be a com
plete non-event."
Kuhn, along with many of fellow
Panthers and a growing number of re
gional delegates to the Nov. 29-Dec. 3 con
ference, was fuming about what she
termed "the 11th-hour attempt by the
White House to sabotage this conference;
to pack it, rig it if you will, to preserve the
image of the oldest president in history, to
make him look like a good guy, like the
guy wearing the white hat in the White
House."
She was angry about what she views as
efforts by the White House to "dim down
any criticism of this administration and its
policies — criticism that may swell to out
rage."
And she was furious about "what we
older Americans consider to be cruel and
inhuman budget transfers away from the
human side of appropriations, the side of
human needs, to a bloated war machine, a
military budget that's totally out of control
and that only serves to isolate and alienate
America from the rest of the world com
munity."
Six years older than America's oldest
president, Kuhn snorted at the notion that
Ronald Reagan might represent a
laudatory role model for older citizens.
"This 'older president,' " she said, "il
lustrates perfectly the class differences in
America. He's rich, and he's 70 years old, in
that order."
Trying to educate the president on the
needs of a demographic group where "70

percent to 80 percent of the people over 65
have as their only income their monthly
Social Security checks," she said, "is hardly
worth the effort," because, in the end,
"Reagan certainly does not identify with
us, and never will."
With social services to the elderly among
the casualties of the pared-down 1982 fed
eral budget, Kuhn and others involved in
this year's White House Conference on
Aging express concerns that the impact of
the gathering may be minimized in order
to reduce criticism of the White House and
its policies toward aging Americans. At the
White House, meanwhile, the official posi
tion is simply that budget restrictions have
forced certain curtailments of the scope of
the conference. The changes in staff and
procedural rules are presented as givens,
perquisites of any new administration.
But Maggie Kuhn, for one, fears that the
cutbacks will dull the effectiveness of this
year's conference. "By reducing the possi
bility for analysis," she said, "they're re
ducing potential criticism and conflict.
They to keep it benign, to make sure
that discussion is limited. I think the idea is
that when you knock out the op
portunities for people to be heard, then
there's less likelihood of dissent.
"It started out as a White House effort to
sanitize the conference, but now it has
turned to sabotage."
The Panthers first grew suspicious, then
heated, over the cancellation of a series of
regional miniconferences that were to
have preceded the winter conference.
Two weeks before the main assembly, they
say they have yet to receive informational
material from their counterparts
elsewhere in the country. They worry that
that they have not yet been assigned to
committee sessions for this once-a-decade

conference.
They say the so-called "small groups of
200-300 people in the conference will in
timidate some of the older delegates who
feel uncomfortable speaking before
crowds. They argue that the conference's
new policy of calling for a single vote from
delegates on a complete package of rec
ommendations will obviate the expression
of opinions on individual issues.
"It's a crass political maneuver, Kuhn
said.
Fierce about her status as a survivor,
Kuhn is an equally tenacious optimist.
"From a positive point of view," she said
after offering this gloomy assessment ot
the conflict-riddled conference, "there
will certainly be an increase in outrage and
disagreement." Out of that anger, Kuhn
said, "I would hope there might be some
protests, some counter-activities."
What they want, Kuhn said, is to
strengthen the Social Security system and
to restore cuts to programs benefiting the
elderly. But Kuhn and company want
more: They want, for example, "to recom
mend intergenerational policies for the
future." They want no less than "to correct
age segregation and to deal with the per
vasive ageism in this country," citing as an
immediate concern "the fact that the old
and the young ought not to be enemies.
But as Kuhn is the first to point out,
ageism has its stereotypical toll. "If we
don't watch ourselves, if we get too emo
tional, they'll say, 'Oh, they've gotten a bit
daffy, haven't they?' "
But Kuhn intends to bypass such in
nuendoes: "We are hoping that the
cogency of our arguments and our under
standing of what is really happening will
eliminate anything like that."
