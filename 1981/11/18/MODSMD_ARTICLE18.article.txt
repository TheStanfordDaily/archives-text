# Prime rate dip signals recession
## 
### Associated Press 
The prime lending rate,
which passed the 16 percent
mark a year ago today on its
way to record peaks, has re
turned to 16 percent, but this
time on a downward slide as
the nation settles into re
cession.
Crocker National Bank in
San Francisco, the nation's
12th-largest bank, undercut
the rest of the industry Monday
and dropped its prime lending
rate to 16 percent from 17 per
cent. At the same time, other

major banks followed a trend
that began last week by reduc
ing the prime rate to 16.5 per
cent.
Thomas Thomson, chief
economist at Crocker, pre
dicted the key business-bor
rowing rate would fall to 15
percent by the end of the year.
Edward Vardeni, chief econ
omist at the investment firm of
E.F. Hutton 3 Co. Inc., was
more optimistic, predicting a
13 percent prime rate by the
end of the year and a 10 per
cent prime rate by February.
The prime rate has been de

clining steadily since Septem
ber, when it stood at 20.5 per
cent, and the decline has ac
celerated in the past month.
"It's just another piece of ev
idence that demonstrates the
recession is beginning to un
fold dramatically," said Yard
eni.
Many economists predict
that as the economy continues
to slump, the Federal Reserve
Board will make credit more
readily available to prevent the
economy from being choked
off.
