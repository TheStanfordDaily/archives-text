Big Game Week schedule is this?
It's a fake one, according to incon
venienced and slightly amused of
ficials at the Office of Student Affairs.
Small black and white flyers dis
tributed last weekend that mis
represented Big Game Week events

created much confusion among
Stanford students about the actual
activity schedule.
Speculation abounded that either
UC-Berkeley or the Chaparral was
responsible for the bogus flyers.
Steve Hoffman, assistant manager
of the Band, said he believed the
Chappie might be the culprit "be
cause of their past antics." But he
added that it was equally possible
that Cal was responsible, especially
since Berkeley students cut the
Band's 25 foot observation tower in
half earlier this week.
Sherri Cauz, member of the Big
Game Committee, said the inferior
quality of the bogus flyers indicated
that Cal was the guilty party.
"It just looks like a Xerox," she
said. "It doesn't look very pro
fessional. Jim Mattson (of the Office
of Student Affairs) was telling me that
if Chappie had done it they would
have done a better job."
In addition, the flyers included
several misspellings. Coach Wiggin
was referred to as "Wiggins," Tres
idder Union was referred to as

"Tressider" and Angell Field was re
ferred to as "Angel Field."
Mary Ann Rothberg, Chaparral
business manager, indignantly re
futed the charges that the Chappie
had produced the flyers. "Every time
something happens, the Chaparral
gets blamed," she said. "There are a
lot of other groups around campus
that pull pranks. I know we had noth
ing to do with this."
Hoffman said the prank was rather
innocent. "It didn't ruin my day,"he
said. But he was worried that the
posters may have confused many stu
dents. For instance, the bogus flyer

listed Union Square as the meeting
place for a Thursday rally, while the
actual rally isscheduled to leave from
the Mark Hopkins Hotel Friday.
Cauz said she was "personally
amused" by the fake posters but she
was also concerned that people
would show up for the nonexistent
bonfire.
The Big Game Committee has is
sued a legitimate large yellow sched
ulethat gives the correct time for
such activities as the Gaities per
formances and the Big Game March.
