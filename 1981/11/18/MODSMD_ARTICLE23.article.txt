## Sally Jenkins Those Vow Boys of 1933 
### 
In the immortal words of Spud Hamilton,
"Any man who would give odds on a Big
Game is just plumb utterly foolish."
There probably aren't too many people
who remember good old Spud these days, but
he was really big in 1933. His writing was less
than-memorable perhaps, although his name
had a nice look to it in the bold print of a
byline.
But one thing will always distinguish old
Spud: he had the uncommon good luck to be
sports editor at a respectable old institution
called The Stanford Daily thai vintage year.
As such, he got to do some hanging around
with a rather grand set of fellows. They had
names like Tiny Thorn hi 11, Bones Hamilton,
Bobby Grayson and Bill Corbus. A dark horse
football team of sophomores led by first-year
head coach Thornhill, they parted their hair in
the middle and called themselves "The Vow
Boys."
Thornhill was a thick-necked, hook-nosed
man with dimples — Spud called him "the
genial and jovial. . He spent 11 years at
Stanford as a line coach under football
mastermind Pop Warner before he was
suddenly thrust into the position of head
coach of what was then affectionately referred
to as "The Big Red Machine." That was in the
days when Stanford football inspired bigger
headlines than a presidential election.
It all started when the new quarterback,
Frank "The Bounding Basque" Alustiza,
gathered his young team around him to make
a pledge when they graduated from the
freshman squad to the varsity. Angered by six
losses in as many years to USC, they vowed
that in the three years they were to play varsity
football for Stanford, they would never let the
Trojans beat them. The Boys made good all
three years, and saw three Rose Bowls as a
result.
But that first season was a touch-and-go
affair. They barely nosed out what Spud called

"El Trojan." The final was 13-7, thanks to field
goals by All-America Corbus, whoalso played
at right guard on both offense and defense.
And Spud was in heaven. "Sophomores that
vowed they would never be beaten by
Southern California completed the first leg of
their three year vigil Saturday, but it took the
toe of all-American Bill Corbus toclinch this
'new deal' for Stanford," was his lead
paragraph.
Stanford rolled oversomething called
Montana the next week, and the victory set up
a confrontation between the Indians and Cal
with everything imaginable at stake. It wasn't
just the axe, although that game marked the
first time the axe was to change hands
according to who won the game, rather than
who had the best thieves. It was a Rose Bowl
bid and all kinds of pride, pitting Stanford's
speed and youth versus Cal's strength and
experience.
The Indians went into the game with what
some later called the most versatile backfield
ever. Besides quick-kick specialist Alustiza, a
former fullback, there were the shifty
halfbacks Bones Hamilton and Buck Van
Dellen, and fullback Grayson, whose ability to
throw the football defined versatility. End Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, called the fastest man in the
conference at the time, made a good target.
But this isn't my story, it belongs to Spud.
"If not the Battle of the Century it looks at
least like the battle of a decade when the
heavy, hard-boiled Golden Bear and the
heavy iightening-fast Indian meet in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow," he wrote. "At 2 o'clock
the kickoff occurs, and a terrific struggle will
begin, unless the dope proves to be very
dopey."
His dope was right on. It was one of the most
bitterly fought Big Games ever, and the
Indians prevailed 7-3 with a last minute
touchdown after Cal led 3-ofor almost three
quarters.
Take it from there, Spud.

headlines than a presidential election.
It all started when the new quarterback,
Frank "The Bounding Basque" Alustiza,
gathered his young team around him to make
a pledge when they graduated from the
freshman squad to the varsity. Angered by six
losses in as many years to USC, they vowed
that in the three years they were to play varsity
football for Stanford, they would never let the
Trojans beat them. The Boys made good all
three years, and saw three Rose Bowls as a
result.
But that first season was a touch-and-go
affair. They barely nosed out what Spud called

"El Trojan." The final was 13-7, thanks to field
goals by All-America Corbus, whoalso played
at right guard on both offense and defense.
And Spud was in heaven. "Sophomores that
vowed they would never be beaten by
Southern California completed the first leg of
their three year vigil Saturday, but it took the
toe of all-American Bill Corbus toclinch this
'new deal' for Stanford," was his lead
paragraph.
Stanford rolled oversomething called
Montana the next week, and the victory set up
a confrontation between the Indians and Cal
with everything imaginable at stake. It wasn't
just the axe, although that game marked the
first time the axe was to change hands
according to who won the game, rather than
who had the best thieves. It was a Rose Bowl
bid and all kinds of pride, pitting Stanford's
speed and youth versus Cal's strength and
experience.
The Indians went into the game with what
some later called the most versatile backfield
ever. Besides quick-kick specialist Alustiza, a
former fullback, there were the shifty
halfbacks Bones Hamilton and Buck Van
Dellen, and fullback Grayson, whose ability to
throw the football defined versatility. End Jim
"Monk" Moscrip, called the fastest man in the
conference at the time, made a good target.
But this isn't my story, it belongs to Spud.
"If not the Battle of the Century it looks at
least like the battle of a decade when the
heavy, hard-boiled Golden Bear and the
heavy iightening-fast Indian meet in Stanford
Stadium tomorrow," he wrote. "At 2 o'clock
the kickoff occurs, and a terrific struggle will
begin, unless the dope proves to be very
dopey."
His dope was right on. It was one of the most
bitterly fought Big Games ever, and the
Indians prevailed 7-3 with a last minute
touchdown after Cal led 3-ofor almost three
quarters.
Take it from there, Spud.
