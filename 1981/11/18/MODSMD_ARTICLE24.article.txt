When Bobby Collins took
over as Southern Mississippi's
coach in 1975, he didn't even
have a football field to call his
own. Roberts Stadium was
being renovated, and the team
had to play all its games on the
road.
Things have changed con
siderably since then for the
Golden Eagles, who broke into
the Top Ten in The Associated
Press college football poll yes
terday.
For the third week in a row,
Pittsburgh and Clemson were
ranked 1-2.with two South
eastern Conference rivals,
Georgia and Alabama, moving
into the third and fourth spots.
Skidding were Southern Cal
ifornia, from third place to 10th
by losing to Washington 13-3;
Penn State, from fifth to 13th by
losing to Alabama 31-16, and
Arizona State, from ninth to
20th by losing to UCLA 34-24.
It was Southern Mississippi
which made the biggest jump,
from 14th a week ago to N0.9 in

the balloting by a nationwide
panel of sports writers and
sportscasters. The Golden
Eagles beat Florida State last
Saturday 58-14.
"We felt we deserved more
national attention," said Col
lins, who led the Golden Eagles
to a 9-3 mark including a vic
tory in the Independence Bowl
last season. "We have to be re
alistic — this kind of recogni
tion is slow coming."
Pitt, a 48-0 winner over
Army, received 63 of 68 first
place votes and 1 354 of a pos
sible 1 360 points. Clemson,
which defeated Maryland 21-7
to capture the Atlantic Coast
Conference crown, received
the other five first-place ballots
and 1 290 points.
Georgia, which clinched at
least a share of the SEC cham
pionship by beating Auburn
24-13, moved up from fourth to
third with 1 169 points, replac
ing Southern Cal.
Alabama, with Bear Bryant
posting a record-tying 314 th
coaching triumph, jumped
from sixth to fourth with 1 128
points.

Nebraska climbed from sev
enth to fifth with 972 points af
ter clinching the Big Eight title
with a 31-7 victory over lowa
State. Southern Methodist's
30-6 triumph over Texas Tech
pushed the Mustangs from
eighth place to sixth with 924
points.
Michigan moved from 11th
to seventh with 875 points after
a 28-10 victory over Purdue.
Texas climbed from 10th to
eighth with 873 points by de
feating Texas Christian 31-15.
Southern Cal, No.lo, had 678
points.
The Second Ten consists of
Miami, Fla., North Carolina,
Penn State, Washington State,
UCLA, Arkansas, Washington,
Brigham Young, lowa and Ari
zona State.
Dropping out of the Top
Twenty were Oklahoma, a
19-14 loser to Missouri; pre
viously unbeaten Hawaii,
which lost 13-3 to BYU, and
Florida State.
Trojans to Tempe?
Phoenix, Ariz. (AP) — South

ern California appeared likely
to be invited to the New Year's
Day Fiesta Bowl, with Penn
State the leading candidate to
be the Trojans' opponent, the
Phoenix Gazette said yester
day.
The Gazette also said that
"sources close to the bowl pic
ture indicate that USC will ac
cept the Fiesta bid as quickly as
it gets it."
Regulations forbid dis
closure of bowl bids until after
next Saturday's games.
The Southern Cal-Penn State
match at Arizona State in sub
urban Tempe, the home of the
Fiesta Bowl, rests on several as
ssumptions, the Gazette said,
among them that Alabama has
promised to accept a bid to the
Cotton Bowl and the Georgia
will be going to the Sugar Bowl.
Another assumption is that
Southern Cal is unlikely to go
to the Rose Bowl as the Pacif
ic-10 Conference champ, since
to do so the Trojans would
have to beat UCLA on Saturday
while Washington and Wash
ington State fought to a tie, the

newspaper said.
A Penn State victory over
Notre Dame on Saturday
would clinch the Nittany Lions'
Fiesta candidacy, the paper
added.
Dogs to taste Sugar
New Orleans (AP) — The
Sugar Bowl picked third
ranked Georgia as host for its
New Year's night football clas
sic, opting for the defending
national champion over
fourth-ranked Alabama, the
Associated Press has learned.
Mickey Holmes, executive
director of the Sugar Bowl,
would neither confirm nor
deny that Georgia was the
choice.
It's an open secret that top
ranked Pittsburgh is set as the
visiting team for the Sugar
Bowl, but Holmes would not
comment on that, either.
This is the first year the com
mittee has had the chance to
choose between probable
Southeastern Conference co
champions. Only an upset of
Alabama by Auburn Nov. 28

could prevent a tie for the title
between Georgia and Ala
bama.
"We know how we want to
proceed on Saturday, and we
will proceed accordingly," was
all Holmes would say after the
decision was made Monday.
"We cannot make any an
nouncement until Saturday,
and we will not," he said.
A six-year-old agreement
with the SEC provides that the
conference champion will be
the Sugar Bowl host, and gives
the Bowl committee the right
to make the choice in the event
of a tie for the title.
That agreement was re
newed this year, but the Sugar
Bowl fought for — and won —
abolishment of the most-re
cent-appearance rule. That
rule said that in event of a tie
for the title, the team which
had been longest away from
the bowl would get the New
Year's Day bid.
Ironically, Alabama Coach
Bear Bryant played a key role in
lining up the SEC-Sugar Bowl
agreement. Bryant last week

tied Amos Alonzo Stagg for the
most college football victories
ever at 314, beating Penn State
31-16, and Alabama had hoped
that victory would get it a Sugar
Bowl invitation.
The Cotton Bowl said it is
considering Alabama and
Southern California for the vis
iting team berth against the
Southwest Conference cham
pion.
Georgia, with All-American
running back Herschel Walker,
nailed down the national
championship last Jan 1. with a
victory over Notre Dame in the
Sugar Bowl.
Pittsburgh Coach Jackie
Sherrill, an Alabama alumnus,
said no decision had been
made on where his team would
celebrate the new year.
He said the decision would
be based on the gate share, sta
tus of the opponent, exposure
and the opportunity for his
players to have a good time.
Any personal desire to go
against his former coach was
not mentioned.
