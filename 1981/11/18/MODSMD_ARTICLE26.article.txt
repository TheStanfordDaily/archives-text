# IM grid playoffs start today, Zetes and Theta Delts top As

### Drew Edwards 
As a dreary autumn quarter draws to a close,
the playoffs for intramural football are set to
gear up for action today. With more than 100
teams competing in all the leagues, only the
cream of the crop wil be invited to participate in
playoff competition.
In the "A" league, some familiar names stand
atop the IM rankings. Alone at the summit are
the Zetes, who have fared quite a bit better with
their opponents than they have with the housing
authorities.
The Zetes are the only undefeated team in the
"A" league but they are followed closely by the
Theta Delts whom they narrowly defeated in a
hard fought battle.
Following these two squads are a couple of
teams who, if they put it all together for the
playoffs, could easily capture the title. Both the
Sigma Chi team and the defending champion
Biz School squad boast strong contingents de
spite their 2-3 records. All in all it appears that a
dogfight of epic proportions will determine who
wears the crown in this division.
In "B" league action, two teams appear to
stand head and shoulders above the rest. Either
the Phi Delts or the Soto team could easily be
considered as odds-on favorites to win the

league title.
The Phi Delts have won all of their games by an
average victory margin of 28 points, while the
Soto squad has a victory margin of 27 points in
compiling a 5-0 record. Bothteams should be es
pecially tough in playoff competition.
Despite the fact that those two teams appear
to be the strongest, some other teams deserve
mention in the hunt for the "B" title. Although
not as strong as last year's championship team,
the SAE squad has coasted to a 5-0 record while
whipping opponents by an averge of three
touchdowns.
Summery Justice is another perennial favorite
that appears to have a good shot at the crown. A
group with the curious name of "The Guys who
talk like the Zetes" could easily join their
namesakes in the victory circle come cham
pionship time.
Finally, a team that could be the real dark
horse of the picture is The Fellas. They could be
the most physical of all teams in the "B" league,
and they appear to have jelled as they rolled up
big victories in the only two legitimate games
they played.
With a playoff draw of close to 40 teams in this
division, clearly almost any team could find a hot
streak and win the title. All that remains o be
seen is which of the 40 teams it will be.
