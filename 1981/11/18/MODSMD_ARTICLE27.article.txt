Reagan to seek arms cut
Washington — President Ronald Reagan is ready to
propose to the Soviet Union that both superpowers
virtually eliminate nuclear missiles from the European
theater, State Department officials said yesterday.
The president, it was said, will use a foreign policy
speech today at the National Press Club to embrace
the so-called "zero-option" approach as the goal for
Soviet-American negotiations on restraining nuclear
forces in Europe. Those talks open Nov. 30 in Geneva.
The option consists of an expected U.S. offer not to
undertake? the planned deployment of new U.S. me
dium-range missiles in Europe it the Soviet Union
agrees to disassemble its own missiles, stationed in
western Russia, aimed at European targets.
However, there is deep skepticism in U.S. arms con
trol circles that such an approach will prove accep
table to the Soviet Union, which is believed highly re
luctant to destroy new weapons such as the SS-20,
capable of carrying three nuclear warheads.
A more limited, fall-back position is said to include
an attempt to win Soviet acceptance of the planned
deployment of 572 American rtuclear warheads on
Pershing II missiles in exchange for the removal of
more than 900 Soviet warheads now in place on SS-20,
SS-5 and SS-4 missiles. That would be a shift in force
levels aimed at producing a relative nuclear balance
in Europe.
Reagan praises volunteer army
Washington — President Ronald Reagan declared
success yesterday in recruiting and maintaining a
quality all-volunteer force during the past year and
said this "represents the best way to meet our man
power requirements in times of peace."
Reagan's statement obviously was intended to rein
force his position that a return to the draft would be
unnecessary in peacetime.
Simultaneously, the Defense Department held an
extensive briefing to underscore the president's
statement that the 1981 fiscal year "was an important
milestone in the history of America's all-volunteer
armed forces."
Pentagon manpower chief Lawrence Korb told re
porters that fiscal 1981, which ended Sept. 30, marked
the first time the Defense Department has fully met its
authorized strength since the draft ended in
mid-1973.
According to Pentagon figures, the number of men
and women on active duty totaled 2,082,000 at the end
of fiscal 1981, or 2000 above the department's objec
tive.
B-1, MX plans progress
Washington — The Senate Appropriations Com
mittee yesterday handed President Ronald Reagan his
second major victory on defense in as many days by
voting 21-7 to build the B-1 bomber.
The House Appropriations Committee on Monday
also approved the land-based MX missile.
Reagan proposed both weapons systems in Octo
ber as part of his plan to beef up U.S. strategic fire
power. Both proposals have been controversial, with
approval by Congress much in doubt.
The House committee has approved $196.5 billion
in spending authority for the Pentagon for fiscal 1982,
about $4 billion less than Reagan sought, while the
Senate unit, by voice vote yesterday, approved $203.8

billion.
Economic pessimism continues
Washongtnn — The admin ist rat ion's chief econom
ic adviser issued new and even gloomier forecasts for
the economy yesterday, casting doubt on President
Ronald Reagan's prediction last month that the cur
rent recession will be only "slight."
The nation's output will slump by between 3 per
cent and 5 percent at an annual rate in the final three
months of this year and will probably grow by only 1
percent in 1982, Murray Weidenbaum, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters yes
terday. He also repeated his recent warning that un
employment could climb as high as 9 percent by next
March, matching the previous postwar peak. Mean
while, he predicted inflation will come down to an
annual rate of 7 to 8 percent in 1982.
Watt criticizes construction aid
Washington — Armed with a memo from President
Ronald Reagan, Secretary of the Interior James Watt
opposed legislation yesterday that would provide
federal aid in the construction of coal slurry pipelines.
In laying down the administration position, Watt
told the House Interior Committee that a bill giving
the federal government authority to allocate land for
pipelines would "torpedo" states' rights.
Supporters of the proposed legislation, sponsored
by Rep. Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) have argued that the
pipelines are needed to provide cheaper transporta
tion for coal in Western states.
USSR production falls short
Moscow — Production fell short of goals this year in
agriculture, coal, iron and steel, the Soviet Union's
chief economic planner reported yesterday. He in
dicated the Soviet Union would aim forthe low end of
its overall targets in the current five-year plan, which
ends in 1985.
Nikolai Baibakov told delegates to the Soviet Par
liament that "it was not possible to fulfill the (1981)
plan" in those areas, but did not specify how wide the
gap was in any of the four areas.
President Leonid Brezhnevtold the Supreme Soviet
on Monday that the economic planners were to
blame for a "poor crop year," and food remained the
nation's central problem.
Of particular note in Baibakov's speech, Western
experts said, was the announcement that capital in
vestment during the five-year period was projected to
grow by 10.4 percent during the five-year plan. Last
March, it was projected at 12 to 15 percent.
Stocks rally slightly
New York — The stock market staged a modest rally
yesterday, recouping some of its losses in Monday's
selloff.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 10.85
Monday, rebounded 5.14 to 850.17. The daily tally on
the New York Stock Exchange showed about five
gainers for every four stocks that lost ground.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow, with some patchy dense
fog developing today and clearing by tomorrow.
Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph. Low temperatures in the
high 40s, highs in the low 60s.
