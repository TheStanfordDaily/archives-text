# Report of assault not in police files

### Julie Kaufmann 
Stanford police again can provide
no record of an attack by a man fit
ting the "campus rapist's" descrip
tion which was reported Nov. 12 â€”
the same day he may have accosted
two other women and raped"a third.
This time, the woman told the Dai
ly, a young police officer arrived
promptly at her College Terrace
home after she alerted the police that
evening. He interviewed her, telling
her a jogger had been raped that
morning, and left.
However, neither Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington nor Stan
ford Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who is
heading the investigation of the re
cent campus attacks, had any knowl
edge of the incident until the Daily
informed them yesterday.
The woman was cycling on the
bike path between Palm and Campus
Drives at 7:50 a.m. on her way to
work at the Stanford Hospital when a
man jogging towards her on the path
veered off his course, grabbed her
around the waist and attempted to
pull her off her bike, she said.
"He had a pretty good grip around
my waist and then he sort of backed
off or something," she said, "I was
going fast enough (to ride away)."
Herrington speculated that the dis
patcher who received the hospital

employee's call at about 7 p.m. on
Nov. 12 may have dispatched Palo
Alto police instead of Stanford po
lice, since she called from College
Terrace, which is under Palo Alto po
lice jurisdiction.
"I didn't see anything on our log,'
Herrington said, "but (Niemeyer)
went to Palo Alto to see if they have a
report on it."
But Palo Alto Police Sgt. Larry Pe
terson told the Daily yesterday after
noon that he could find no record of
a Palo Alto police officer's visit to her
home. He said Stanford Police may
have been dispatched because the
incident occurred on campus.
The Daily reported yesterday that
Stanford police failed to respond to a
student's report that she had been
accosted N 0v.12 at 9:15 a.m. by a man
fitting the "campus rapist" descrip
tion.
Herrington yesterday confirmed
that although the junior reported the
incident within 15 minutes, the clerk
who answered the station's business
phone lost the message. "It (the call)
did come in that day and the clerk
who took (the message) misplaced
it,"he said. The clerk "is not taking
phone messages any more," he
added.
Neimeyer told the Daily "there's a
