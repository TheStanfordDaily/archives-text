# Report of assault not in police files
## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
Stanford police again can provide
no record of an attack by a man fit
ting the "campus rapist's" descrip
tion which was reported Nov. 12 â€”
the same day he may have accosted
two other women and raped"a third.
This time, the woman told the Dai
ly, a young police officer arrived
promptly at her College Terrace
home after she alerted the police that
evening. He interviewed her, telling
her a jogger had been raped that
morning, and left.
However, neither Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington nor Stan
ford Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, who is
heading the investigation of the re
cent campus attacks, had any knowl
edge of the incident until the Daily
informed them yesterday.
The woman was cycling on the
bike path between Palm and Campus
Drives at 7:50 a.m. on her way to
work at the Stanford Hospital when a
man jogging towards her on the path
veered off his course, grabbed her
around the waist and attempted to
pull her off her bike, she said.
"He had a pretty good grip around
my waist and then he sort of backed
off or something," she said, "I was
going fast enough (to ride away)."
Herrington speculated that the dis
patcher who received the hospital

employee's call at about 7 p.m. on
Nov. 12 may have dispatched Palo
Alto police instead of Stanford po
lice, since she called from College
Terrace, which is under Palo Alto po
lice jurisdiction.
"I didn't see anything on our log,'
Herrington said, "but (Niemeyer)
went to Palo Alto to see if they have a
report on it."
But Palo Alto Police Sgt. Larry Pe
terson told the Daily yesterday after
noon that he could find no record of
a Palo Alto police officer's visit to her
home. He said Stanford Police may
have been dispatched because the
incident occurred on campus.
The Daily reported yesterday that
Stanford police failed to respond to a
student's report that she had been
accosted N 0v.12 at 9:15 a.m. by a man
fitting the "campus rapist" descrip
tion.
Herrington yesterday confirmed
that although the junior reported the
incident within 15 minutes, the clerk
who answered the station's business
phone lost the message. "It (the call)
did come in that day and the clerk
who took (the message) misplaced
it,"he said. The clerk "is not taking
phone messages any more," he
added.
Neimeyer told the Daily "there's a
good possibility" that the man who
exposed himself and chased the jun
ior as she bicycled along Galvez on
her way back from the Town and
Country Shopping Center is the
"campus rapist." "Judging from her
description and everything it's likely
that it's the same assailant," he said.
The student last night said
Niemeyer contacted her yesterday
morning and asked her to file a for
mal report with the police today. "He
said I should have called 911 because
that way the squad car would re
spond," she said.
Herrington agreed that people
should call 911 to report criminal ac
tivity, even if emergency action is not
required. "It's an emergency if
you're reporting a crime, even if it
happened a while ago," he said. "I
think people thirvk, 'Well, this isn't an
emergency,' but if><Su really want to
talk to a police officer,"then it's an
emergency."
The 911 number reaches a dis

patcher in Palo Alto, he said, who
handles calls for Stanford, Mountain
View and Palo Alto police. The dis
patcher listens to the caller's descrip
tion of the incident, decides which
squad to notify, and dispatches of
ficers to the scene.
The police business office, reached
by dialing 497-3444, deals primarily
with parking questions or calls for
specific police officers, he said.
But, a di:<|>cj' r ' er told a medical
student who called 911 yesterday
morning to report suspicious activity
Saturday by a man matching the
"campus description to call
the business number. "The (dis
patcher) said, 'You think he's still
gonna be sitting there now? Why
didn't you call Saturday,' " Mirabel
Hernandez told the Daily yesterday.
"Then he told me to call 497-3444 and
hung up on me," Hernandez said.
The second year med student said
she wanted to notify the police that
she had seen the man crouching be
hind bushes in the parking lot of the
Saks Fifth Avenue store in the Stan

ford Shopping Center Saturday at
1:30 p.m. while she was walking from
the Med Center to the Shopping
Center.
"The impression I got was that I
shouldn't call back, that it was useless
to call," she said, "But I looked him
(the man matching the "campus
rapist" description) straight in the
eye. I saw him clearly and I may be
able to help identify him. I was really
upset because I had called and felt
bad for calling."
"It will be fixed," responded Her
rington yesterday."He (the dis
patcher) should have dispatched an
officer to talk to her. A lot of times
what happens is that the communica
tions people get frustrated and they
begin conveying that frustra
tion...but that doesn't excuse it."
The man believed responsible for
as many as seven recent attacks here
is described as a black adult male,
18-20 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall, of
a muscular build and wearing a short
afro-style haircut.
