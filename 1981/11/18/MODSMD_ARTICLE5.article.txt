# Lt. Governor Mike Curb left to 'run the show'
## Brown's aide Collins skips fundraiser 
### Peggy Hernandez 
The most notable presence lacking at last night's
Palo Alto fund raiser for Assemblyman Ernie Kon
nyu (R-Cupertino) was B.T. Collins, Gov. Jerry
Brown's No.l aide. Thus, Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, a
1982 Republican gubernatorial candidate, was left
to carry the show.
Collins, a Republican, ridiculed Brown recenfly
in articles appearing in People magazine and in
The Los Angeles Times. In an interview with the
Times, Collins called Brown a "lecher" whose hair
is so greasy that "not even dandruff could get
through." His comments were made prior to his
appointment to Brown's office last month.
Collins was scheduled to be the master of cere
monies at Konnyu's fund raiser, joining Curb on
the podium at the $250 a ticket event held at
Rickey's Hyatt House. No explanation was given
for Collins' absence, though Republican party
members at the event said Collins failed to appear
because Brown was unhappy over Collins' sched
uled appearance.
Curb took the opportunity to criticize Brown to
the 140 people present. In the process, Curb mud
dled his position on the Peripheral Canal (Senate

Bill 200) issue during a question and answer period.
Curb, who is known to oppose building the Per
ipheral Canal, told the audience he did not sup
port SB 200. The bill, however, is a referendum call
ing to overturn the canal proposal.
"The California economy could not afford this
bill," Curb said. He said he believes the canal
project cost would escalate from its present
budget of $4.4 billion by the time of its estimated
completion in 1992.
The audience did not acknowledge they were
aware of Curb's mistake.
Curb, who appeared in Palo Alto last month, re
iterated his campaign philosophy of supporting a
return to basics through four tenets: freedom frorrl
violent crime, return to basic education, increas
ing jobs and "getting the government off the backs
of business."
Curb said Brown is responsible for the vfolations
of those basics. Regarding violentcrime, Curb said
Brown is responsible for crime increase due to his
appointment of what the lieutenant governor calls
liberal judges.
"We used to have the most respected judiciary
before Gov. Brown," Curb said. "Now we have lib
eral decisions, with people like (Chief Justice) Rose

Bird, which have contributed to an increase in
crime."
Curb also said Brown's tailure to understand the
mechanics of business operations has created ex
cessive bureaucracy.
"Jerry Brown doesn't have respect for the tax
payer's money because he doesn't know what it's
like to have a staff pavioll," Curb said. He pointed
out that, as former president ot MGM records, he
is familiar with business operations. -
"California will have a $1 billion deficit for this
year," Curb said. "Proposition 13 (passed by vqters
in 1978) is not to blame.
"California has been spending when California
should have been cutting, squeezing and saving Its
budget,"he said. "We are in a fiscal crisis."
Curb attributed the deficit to California's expen
ditures exceeding intake.
Nonetheless, Curb supports tax cuts. He is a
strong supporter of eliminating the California in
heritence tax, which is due for vote in 1982. He also
supports President Ronald Reagan's budget cuts
which, he said, will work if given time.
"We have to give Reagan's budget more than six
weeks to succeed, despite what critics inside and
out (of Reagan's office) say," Curb said.
