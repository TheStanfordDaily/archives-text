# Hoover's publicity spurs discussion of academic quality
## 
### Jettrey Golden 
Since its construction in 1919, Hoover
Tower has laid first claim to the attention
of those observing Stanford from two or
three miles. Since last year's presidential
election, its tenant, the Hoover Institu
tion on War, Revolution, and Peace, has
laid first claim to the attention of those
who observe the University from two or
three thousand miles.
President Ronald Reagan, who became
Hoover's first honorary fellow in 1975, has
appointed more than 30 past and present
Hoover members to executive boards,
commissions, and advisory positions in
his administration.
And these numbers alone may under
state the influence of the Hoover-af

filiated voice in Washington, for it in
cludes some of the men generally recog
nized to be at the very center of policy de
liberation.
Former Senior Fellow Richard Allen is
the president's Assistant for National Se
curity Affairs. Senior Fellow Martin An
derson is Assistant for Policy Develop
ment. Special Presidential Envoy Philip
Habib, a Hoover senior research fellow,
was the principal agent of the most recent
round of peace negotiations in the
Middle East.
This remarkable new prominence has
reheated disputes about the Hoover In
stitution that were first heard well before
Reagan's political arrival.
Many see the controversy that has sur
rounded Hoover as a straightforward ide
ological conflict played out along predic
table lines: left-of-center Stanford pro
fessors take pot shots at the Institution be
cause they don't like the right-of-center
political theory generated there.
But some Hoover critics feel complete
ly misrepresented by that simple for
mulation. They make a distinction be
tween the Hoover Library, which they
generally consider an invaluable resource
("pure gold," in the words of a critical ec
onomics professor), and the Institution's
research operations.
This is the dimension of Hoover that
draws critical fire — the "think tank" of
media parlance, domain of the visiting
and permanent research fellows who syn
thesize political theory, analysis, and poli
cy statements from archival materials and
shared dialogue.
It is this side of Hoover, the "rhetoric
factory" in the confidential words of one
Hoover fellow, that lead some to question
whether the Institution hasa proper place
on the Stanford campus at all. And those
who ask that question say it is Hoover's
function, not its ideological bent, that
bothers them.
The nature of the criticism might be
misunderstood partly because Hoover
ideology is more readily identified than

Hoover function. "I am against Com
munism," Associate Director Richard
Staar has said. "It's an evil system. An in
human system. So I am against it."
Peter Duignan, head of the Hoover's
Africa program and university curator of
the African collection, has said that anti
communism is "in the nature of being a
good person."
These sentiments are rooted in official
tradition. Founder Herbert Hoover
spelled it out in a 1959 statement pre
pared for the University: "The purpose of
this Institution must be," he wrote, "by its
research and publications, to demon
strate the evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx — whether communism, socialism,
or economic materialism — thus to pro
tect the American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies, and to reaf
firm the validity of the American system."
And the explicit power of Hoover's
statement may have contributed to the
assumption that criticism of the Institu
tion has been purely ideological.
No one would argue that Hoover's
mandate is uniformly followed today at
the Institution. The views of a number of
past and present fellows, from Sidney
Hook to Robert Hall to Barton Bernstien,
are generally recognized as falling to the
left of political center. Few would dis
agree with University President Donald
Kennedy's recent comment that "The
Hoover Institution is substantially more
ideologically balanced than it was 10 or 15
years ago."
For some of Hoover's critics, however,
this evolutionary change, as well as claims
that Hoover's conservatism usefully
counter-balances University-wide liber
alism, is beside the point. History Prof.
Alexander Dallin, who gave up his Hoo
ver fellowship four years ago, is particu
larly disturbed that his objections are in
terpreted as ideological prejudice.
"The argument must not be reduced to
which views should be represented on
campus," he said. Dallin's position on
Hoover ideology sounds like a page from

Voltaire: he supports its right to voice
opinions that "differ rather sharply" from
his own.
"What is improper," Dallin said, "is for
any organization with a specific political
orientation — be it left, right, or sideways
— to be institutionally represented on a
university campus."
The emphasis is Dallin's, and it be
comes clearer in the context of a remark
made last week by Kennedy. Kennedy ad
mitted some concern about Hoover's ex
tremely high profile, but said he would be
equally bothered if any single segment of
the University — an economic depart
ment or a particular science project, for
example — began to attract a prepon
derance of national attention while other
areas were ignored.
"The fact is," Dallin said, "that even if
my colleagues and I work very hard to
promote our ideas in the media — and we
are not salesmen — we are still speaking
as individual professors, not as a Stanford
institution."
According to Dallin, Hoover's public
affairs office, which sends daily opinions
columns to 120 newspapers across the
country and generates a steady flow of in
formation about Hoover personnel and
their research, makes the critical dif
ference. In Dallin's opinion, the resulting
exposure gives Hoover a c/e facto role as
Stanford's political voice. It is the role, not
the specific tone of the voice, to which he
objects.
Dalli n's critique has drawn a variety of
reactions. One issimpleskepticism. "That
argument doesn't impress me at all," said
Heinz Eulau, chairman of Stanford's polit
ical science department and a Hoover
Senior Fellow by courtesy. "If the people
who talk about Hoover's inappropriate
ness could take control of the place them
selves, they would in a minute. I would if I
could. So would anyone else around
here. In a political argument like this,
people use whatever Machiavellian argu
ments they can think of."
Others rebuff Dallin's theory by point

ing out that Hoover makes no claim to 1
speak for Stanford, and is in fact a sepa
rate organization. Even the actual degree
of that separation has been grounds for
debate. According to paragraph three of
its 1959 charter, Hoover is "an independ
ent institution within the frame of Stan
ford University. Its relation to the Univer
sity is that the president of the University
will propose all appointments, promo
tions, and the budget of the Institution to
the University Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any faculty com
mittees between the president and the
trustees."
That formal description has sustained
varying interpretations. A Hoover admin
istrator has called the self-funding charac
ter of the Institution "the bottom line. We

We are independent."
Eulau agreed. "Hoover speaks for
no one but Hoover," he said. "It has
no responsibility to clear up con
fusion in the public mind on that
point. If any clarification is needed, it
should be done by the University."
But if clarification means em
phasizing the lines dividing Stanford
from Hoover, the University is not
ready to clarify. University Vice Presi
dent for Public Affairs Robert Rosen
zweig notes that Hoover's buildings
belong to Stanford, that its library is a
fully integrated part of the University
library system, that its appointment
procedure mirrors that of other Uni
versity departments except for the
absence of faculty review, and that
Stanford's financial support of the
Hoover is considerable. (According
to the Institution's Annual Report,
University funds provided 29 percent
of the Hoover's projected $6.6 mil
lion budget in 1980-81.)
Rosenzweig said Hoover functions
"pretty much like any other depart
ment." He compared the joint ap
pointment procedure, which allows
individuals to serve concurrently as
faculty members and Hoover fellows,
to appointments shared between to
different University departments.
Rosenzweig responded to the ob
servation that the Stanford/Hoover
distinction has little importance in
the public mind by noting "it doesn't
have much importance in reality,
either." But that does not mean he
shares Dallin's concerns.
"I have no problem at all with the
perception of Hoover as a Stanford
voice as long as two conditions

hold," he said. "First, that the quality
of its work is reputable. And second,
that there are no political or ideol
ogical requirements in their hiring
practices."
It is nearly impossible to grade the
Hoover on this two-point test with
any precision. Opinions about the
quality of Hoover work vary widely.
"The thinking of the people at the
Hoover is second rate," said a visiting
fellow two years ago, "and most
Hoover people are third rate."
On the other hand, Hoover Public
Affairs Coordinator George Marotta
said Hoover fellows are undeniably
responsible for some of the finest re
cent work to be found anywhere on
political issues and theory. Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall ex
pressed qualified agreement. He said
Hoover fellows use "very, very con
siderable skill in turning out stuff that
is in some cases really good scholar
ship."
Still, Marshall faulted specific
works, such as Reagan adviser Martin
Anderson's recent book, for using
"false assumptions."
Eulau has some reservations about
Hoover work that tie together Ro
senzweig's two conditions. "If I were
the University," Eulau said, "I'd
worry about the academic quality at
Hoover. You get very uneven work
when you hire more for reasons of
politics than merit, and that's what
has been happening over there."
W. Glenn Campbell, the Institu
tion's director since he was ap
pointed by Herbert Hoover in 1959,
would be the tyrant in that for
mulation. He has said "there is no
ideological saliva test" in Hoover's

recruitment processes, and invites
anyone who thinks otherwise to sur
vey the political outlooks of different
fellows.
The results of such a survey would
establish at least one fact: the Hoover
is not an unblemished gallery of
right-wing clones, reproducing itself
with high ideological fidelity. "The
political screening is much moresub
tle than that," said a doctoral student
who assists research at the Hoover.
"There is, first of all, a reinforcing ef
fect: the conservatives here en
courage their conservative col
leagues to come as fellows, and they
all create an environment that makes
other conservatives want to come
here. The question of whether a real
Marxist could be appointed here is
very hypothetical, because I don't
think that any Marxist would want to
come."
And if one did? He or she would be
the victim, this assistant said, of politi
cal screening that is not entirely con
scious. "Campbell would never re
ject for political reasons a candidate
whose work he respected; it's more
that he could never respect work that
has a left-wing perspective. That
means that from Campbell's point of
view, the rejection is based on aca
demic merit, not politics."
Hoover officials show little interest
in such reasoning; their roster of fel
lows, they say, speaks for itself. "I
think our hiring decisions have
brought a wider range of views here
than you'll find at most political sci
ence departments across the coun
try," said Marotta.
