# Hoover's publicity spurs discussion of academic quality

Since its construction in 1919, Hoover
Tower has laid first claim to the attention
of those observing Stanford from two or
three miles. Since last year's presidential
election, its tenant, the Hoover Institu
tion on War, Revolution, and Peace, has
laid first claim to the attention of those
who observe the University from two or
three thousand miles.
President Ronald Reagan, who became
Hoover's first honorary fellow in 1975, has
appointed more than 30 past and present
Hoover members to executive boards,
commissions, and advisory positions in
his administration.
And these numbers alone may under
state the influence of the Hoover-af

filiated voice in Washington, for it in
cludes some of the men generally recog
nized to be at the very center of policy de
liberation.
Former Senior Fellow Richard Allen is
the president's Assistant for National Se
curity Affairs. Senior Fellow Martin An
derson is Assistant for Policy Develop
ment. Special Presidential Envoy Philip
Habib, a Hoover senior research fellow,
was the principal agent of the most recent
round of peace negotiations in the
Middle East.
This remarkable new prominence has
reheated disputes about the Hoover In
stitution that were first heard well before
Reagan's political arrival.
Many see the controversy that has sur
rounded Hoover as a straightforward ide
ological conflict played out along predic
table lines: left-of-center Stanford pro
fessors take pot shots at the Institution be
cause they don't like the right-of-center
political theory generated there.
But some Hoover critics feel complete
ly misrepresented by that simple for
mulation. They make a distinction be
tween the Hoover Library, which they
generally consider an invaluable resource
("pure gold," in the words of a critical ec
onomics professor), and the Institution's
research operations.
This is the dimension of Hoover that
draws critical fire — the "think tank" of
media parlance, domain of the visiting
and permanent research fellows who syn
thesize political theory, analysis, and poli
cy statements from archival materials and
shared dialogue.
It is this side of Hoover, the "rhetoric
factory" in the confidential words of one
Hoover fellow, that lead some to question
whether the Institution hasa proper place
on the Stanford campus at all. And those
who ask that question say it is Hoover's
function, not its ideological bent, that
bothers them.
The nature of the criticism might be
misunderstood partly because Hoover
ideology is more readily identified than

Hoover function. "I am against Com
munism," Associate Director Richard
Staar has said. "It's an evil system. An in
human system. So I am against it."
Peter Duignan, head of the Hoover's
Africa program and university curator of
the African collection, has said that anti
communism is "in the nature of being a
good person."
These sentiments are rooted in official
tradition. Founder Herbert Hoover
spelled it out in a 1959 statement pre
pared for the University: "The purpose of
this Institution must be," he wrote, "by its
research and publications, to demon
strate the evils of the doctrines of Karl
Marx — whether communism, socialism,
or economic materialism — thus to pro
tect the American way of life from such
ideologies, their conspiracies, and to reaf
firm the validity of the American system."
And the explicit power of Hoover's
statement may have contributed to the
assumption that criticism of the Institu
tion has been purely ideological.
No one would argue that Hoover's
mandate is uniformly followed today at
the Institution. The views of a number of
past and present fellows, from Sidney
Hook to Robert Hall to Barton Bernstien,
are generally recognized as falling to the
left of political center. Few would dis
agree with University President Donald
Kennedy's recent comment that "The
Hoover Institution is substantially more
ideologically balanced than it was 10 or 15
years ago."
For some of Hoover's critics, however,
this evolutionary change, as well as claims
that Hoover's conservatism usefully
counter-balances University-wide liber
alism, is beside the point. History Prof.
Alexander Dallin, who gave up his Hoo
ver fellowship four years ago, is particu
larly disturbed that his objections are in
terpreted as ideological prejudice.
"The argument must not be reduced to
which views should be represented on
campus," he said. Dallin's position on
Hoover ideology sounds like a page from

Voltaire: he supports its right to voice
opinions that "differ rather sharply" from
his own.
"What is improper," Dallin said, "is for
any organization with a specific political
orientation — be it left, right, or sideways
— to be institutionally represented on a
university campus."
The emphasis is Dallin's, and it be
comes clearer in the context of a remark
made last week by Kennedy. Kennedy ad
mitted some concern about Hoover's ex
tremely high profile, but said he would be
equally bothered if any single segment of
the University — an economic depart
ment or a particular science project, for
example — began to attract a prepon
derance of national attention while other
areas were ignored.
"The fact is," Dallin said, "that even if
my colleagues and I work very hard to
promote our ideas in the media — and we
are not salesmen — we are still speaking
as individual professors, not as a Stanford
institution."
According to Dallin, Hoover's public
affairs office, which sends daily opinions
columns to 120 newspapers across the
country and generates a steady flow of in
formation about Hoover personnel and
their research, makes the critical dif
ference. In Dallin's opinion, the resulting
exposure gives Hoover a c/e facto role as
Stanford's political voice. It is the role, not
the specific tone of the voice, to which he
objects.
Dalli n's critique has drawn a variety of
reactions. One issimpleskepticism. "That
argument doesn't impress me at all," said
Heinz Eulau, chairman of Stanford's polit
ical science department and a Hoover
Senior Fellow by courtesy. "If the people
who talk about Hoover's inappropriate
ness could take control of the place them
selves, they would in a minute. I would if I
could. So would anyone else around
here. In a political argument like this,
people use whatever Machiavellian argu
ments they can think of."
Others rebuff Dallin's theory by point

ing out that Hoover makes no claim to 1
speak for Stanford, and is in fact a sepa
rate organization. Even the actual degree
of that separation has been grounds for
debate. According to paragraph three of
its 1959 charter, Hoover is "an independ
ent institution within the frame of Stan
ford University. Its relation to the Univer
sity is that the president of the University
will propose all appointments, promo
tions, and the budget of the Institution to
the University Board of Trustees. There
will be no reference to any faculty com
mittees between the president and the
trustees."
That formal description has sustained
varying interpretations. A Hoover admin
istrator has called the self-funding charac
ter of the Institution "the bottom line. We
