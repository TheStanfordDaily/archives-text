## First spacecraft ever to land twice Columbia lands 
### Tim Lundergan 
The landing Saturday of the
United States SpaceShuttleCo
lumbia drew less than half the
crowd of 500,000 which the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) esti
mated would attend.

Perspective

One of the reasons for the
"small" crowd of 200,000 un
doubtedly was the hurried
rescheduling of the landing af
ter one of the shuttle's three
fuel cells malfunctioned. Cut
ting the length of the mission
from five days to two days and
six hours forced organizations
such as Stanford's chapter of
the American Institute of
Astronautics and Aeronautics
to cancel plans for trips to
watch the landing.
But another major reason
was the apparent lack of novel
ty. Columbia had already gone
into space once before.

Despite the visions of its proponents, the
shuttle's opponents question whether this
expensive creation will ever become the >
efficient, practical, economical vehicle it
was envisioned to become. The failure of
a fuel cell in last week's flight brought
forth questions about its reliability.

To NASA, however, this is
precisely the importance of the
space shuttle. Columbia is the
world's first reusable space
craft. Unlike previous manned
craft which were designed with
one specific mission in mind,
such as landing on the moon,
the shuttle was designed as a
multi-purpose vehicle capable
of performing a variety of ser
vices for a variety of customers.
The shuttle will eventually
launch satellites for both the
military and private industry.
The 32 flights scheduled for the
next four years are already
booked up with customers in
telecommunications and earth
resources exploration.
Although last week's flight
was intended primarily to test

the vehicle itself, according to
a spokesperson at NASA's
Ames Center in Sunnyvale, Co
lumbia carried with it five ex
periments involving remote
sensing of land resources, en
vironmental quality, ocean
conditions, and
meteorological phenomena.
The shortening of the flight
prevented some of these tests
from being fully carried out.
The military also has plans for
the shuttle â€” much of the
money for the development of
the shuttle has come from the
military budget. The armed
services may eventually launch
their own flights from Van
denherg Air Forcp Base in Cali
fornia. The shuttle is not
armed, but will allow the
armed forces to launch and
service their own satellites.
The shuttle allows organiza
tions to put larger satellites in
space than with unmanned
rockets. Its payload capacity is
65,000 pounds, and it has a 15

foot wide and 60 foot long
cargo bay.
In addition, the shuttle has a
robot arm capable of grabbing
objects in space. The shuttle
will allow NASA to repair satel
lites while they are in orbit, or
bring them back to Earth to be
repaired. Proponents of the
shuttle believe this will reduce
considerably the need for
building new satellites.
A subtler but potentially
more dramatic effect of the
shuttle's design is the increased
size of its crew compartment.
Until now, manned flights
were made only by trained
astronauts, most of them highly
specialized test pilots. But al
though the shuttle requires
only two crewmen, it can ac

comodate five other occu
pants. These mission specialists
can be scientists who will not
need to undergo extensive
pre-flight training. Potentially,
space will be opened up for a

wide variety of uses.
The European Space Agency
plans to use the shuttle to carry
a complete scientific labora
tory into space. The European
lab will be staffed by scientific

experts and return to Earth
with the shuttle.
NASA is moving away from
its early "macho test pilot space
travel mystique" because of
the emphasis on the shuttle as a

routine workhorse in space.
NASA plans to send its first
female crewmember into
space soon.
Despite the visions of its pro

ponents, the shuttle's oppo
nents question whether this
expensive creation will ever
become the efficient, practical,
economical vehicle it was en
visioned to become.
