## Pres. Kennedy's on the run! 
### Daniel Labov 
Up for a healthy dish? Presi
dent Donald Kennedy is. . . ev
ery Tuesday and Friday morn
ing, when he invites all stu
dents and faculty to join him on
the four-mile run to "the dish."
Joggers assemble at 6:30 a.m.
in front of the Hoover house to
begin the trek.
Kennedy said he fears that
some students are hesitant
about joining him because
they believe the run is too far
and the group too fast. But he
emphasized that these fears are
unfounded since "we try to
find a comfortable group pace.
If the group is large we might
even split up. It's certainly not
competitive and no one feels
awkward."
Kennedy began his running
career long ago. "I was a lousy
middle distance runner in col
lege," he said. Although he ran
both the mile and two-mile run
in track, he said his primary

sport was skiing.
After school, he took a hiatus
from running, which lasted
about 14-15 years. He then
picked it up again around '65 or
'66 — well before running
came into vogue in the current
physical fitness craze.
At that time, lie said his goal
was to break a five-minute mile
by the age of 40. But this goal
changed when he began to
lengthen his runs.
He decided, in the interests
of more fun and less strain, to
concentrate on cross country
running. He found running
amongst the hills and clean air
more enjoyable than around
the track.
Kennedy said he runs more
for sheer pleasure than for
health or exercise. "I'd like to
say that I'm one of those
careful people running with an
eye towards medical future,
but that really is not the case,"
he said.
The idea of running with stu

dents "just carne to me" during
an interview with KZSU, said
Kennedy. "It looked like a val
uable opportunity and fun way
to meet people." By giving
people something to identify
with, he believed it could serve
to harmonize his relations with
the student population.
"Over the past year I made
some really good and interest
ing friends, especially among
the faculty," he noted. "Some
students do show up a lot and I
get to recognize and know
them. Others come once or
twice for fun and that's fine
too."
The average group is usually
six to 10 people,he said, but
sometimes a whole dorm, team
or oganization decide to run
together.
For the most part, reaction to
his program of jogging with
students has been positive.
Though Kennedy admitted
that "some people feei it's a lit
tle undignified," he sees no

justification for this attitude.
"Ours is a community in
which exercise and running is
valued — especially at Stan
ford," he said, "I have this in
terest, as others do, so why
can't we share it?"
Stanford is "a place with a lot
of informality and friend
liness," said Kennedy. He be
lieves his running program is
congruent with these attitudes
in all respects.
There have been a few
charges of insincerity, with
some people feeling that the
run is merely a publicity stunt
to project a favorable, healthy
sort of image. When con
fronted with this, Kennedy
said, "I don't know how to re
spond to it. I know it sounds a
little like that ... I honestly
didn't do it for any kind of pub
lic image thing."
But he said, most important
ly, "people by and large have
enjoyed it."

RUNNING WITH PRFSIDFNT DONALD KENNEDY — A run with the president high
lighted the Maderathon, a 10-kilometer run held last Sunday and sponsored by Madera
dorm. Students and laruity are also invited to join Kennedy lor a "dish run"each Tuesday
and Friday morninc; at 6:30.

Up for a healthy dish? Presi
dent Donald Kennedy is. . . ev
ery Tuesday and Friday morn
ing, when he invites all stu
dents and faculty to join him on
the four-mile run to "the dish."
Joggers assemble at 6:30 a.m.
in front of the Hoover house to
begin the trek.
Kennedy said he fears that
some students are hesitant
about joining him because
they believe the run is too far
and the group too fast. But he
emphasized that these fears are
unfounded since "we try to
find a comfortable group pace.
If the group is large we might
even split up. It's certainly not
competitive and no one feels
awkward."
Kennedy began his running
career long ago. "I was a lousy
middle distance runner in col
lege," he said. Although he ran
both the mile and two-mile run
in track, he said his primary

sport was skiing.
After school, he took a hiatus
from running, which lasted
about 14-15 years. He then
picked it up again around '65 or
'66 — well before running
came into vogue in the current
physical fitness craze.
At that time, lie said his goal
was to break a five-minute mile
by the age of 40. But this goal
changed when he began to
lengthen his runs.
He decided, in the interests
of more fun and less strain, to
concentrate on cross country
running. He found running
amongst the hills and clean air
more enjoyable than around
the track.
Kennedy said he runs more
for sheer pleasure than for
health or exercise. "I'd like to
say that I'm one of those
careful people running with an
eye towards medical future,
but that really is not the case,"
he said.
The idea of running with stu

dents "just carne to me" during
an interview with KZSU, said
Kennedy. "It looked like a val
uable opportunity and fun way
to meet people." By giving
people something to identify
with, he believed it could serve
to harmonize his relations with
the student population.
"Over the past year I made
some really good and interest
ing friends, especially among
the faculty," he noted. "Some
students do show up a lot and I
get to recognize and know
them. Others come once or
twice for fun and that's fine
too."
The average group is usually
six to 10 people,he said, but
sometimes a whole dorm, team
or oganization decide to run
together.
For the most part, reaction to
his program of jogging with
students has been positive.
Though Kennedy admitted
that "some people feei it's a lit
tle undignified," he sees no

justification for this attitude.
"Ours is a community in
which exercise and running is
valued — especially at Stan
ford," he said, "I have this in
terest, as others do, so why
can't we share it?"
Stanford is "a place with a lot
of informality and friend
liness," said Kennedy. He be
lieves his running program is
congruent with these attitudes
in all respects.
There have been a few
charges of insincerity, with
some people feeling that the
run is merely a publicity stunt
to project a favorable, healthy
sort of image. When con
fronted with this, Kennedy
said, "I don't know how to re
spond to it. I know it sounds a
little like that ... I honestly
didn't do it for any kind of pub
lic image thing."
But he said, most important
ly, "people by and large have
enjoyed it."
