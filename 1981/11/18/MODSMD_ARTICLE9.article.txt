# Ultimate frisbee flies high in popularity
## 
### Boh Cohn 
In the 19205, students at Yale and
Harvard used to buy Frisbee pies, eat
them, and then play catch with the
empty tins. Thus, the sport of Frisbee
was invented.
Sixty years later, Frisbee is enjoying
an all-time high in popularity, and is still
growing. According to Tom Mcßann,
Stanford's "local world champion,"
"more Frisbees are sold each year than
baseballs, basketballs and footballs
combined."
A majority of these discs go toward
the practice and playing of America's
newest team sport — Ultimate Frisbee.
When Mcßann came to The Farm
nine years ago, at the age of 22, people
were already playing Ultimate. For the
past decade, he has coordinated a cam
pus Frisbee program that has grown
from Bridge sponsorship to ASSU to in
tramurals to a club sport and finally to a
credit course.
Mcßann carries with him an im
pressive Frisbee background. In 1975
while playing on Stanford's Ultimate
team, he was named a Western Ul
timate Champion. Last year, in San
Francisco's Golden Gate Park, he set a
Guinness World Record for "longest
throw of any object in the history of
man."
Mcßann hurled a Skyro, a "high tech
nology distance" type frisbee (a plastic
disc with a hole in the middle) 286 yards,
easily eclipsing the old mark set by a
man wielding a boomerang.
Mcßann presently serves as advisor to

Stanford's Ultimate team. The team, un
der the leadership of co-presidents
Brett Foy and Bob Bhisitkul, meets three
times a weeek and usually plays a
league game or in a tournament on the
weekend.
Unlike many Stanford sports, this is a
year-round activity, and thus represents
a serious committment for the approx
imately 20 team members. "That's no
problem," one member said, "it's so
much fun, it's addictive."
According to the International
Frisbee Association's Official Rules, Ul
timate is a fast moving, competitive,
non-contact sport played by two teams
of seven people each.
Although any regular player would
refute the "non-contact" clause, there
is no doubt that this is a sport requiring
a combination of speed, strength, and
perhaps most important, endurance.
The game starts with a throw-off, and
the receiving team advances the Frisbee
by tossing to team members toward an
end zone, much like in football. If the
Frisbee is caught in the end zone, a
point is scored and the team throws off.
If the Frisbee is ever dropped or
knocked down, the opposing team
gains control. No steps are allowed for
the player with the disc. And there is no
referee — a code of honor is employed
and almost always upheld.
"Ultimate Frisbee takes the best part
of football," Foy insisted. "It's like a
football game without any breaks."
"Every player is a quarterback and re
ceiver," Mcßann added. "Each player

has to contribute these qualities for the
team to succeed."
And success is what the Stanford
Synapse (the team name) is striving
for. They are presently ranked number
three on the West Coast, behind teams
from Santa Barbara and Berkeley re
spectively.
They recently returned from the
Western Regionals, the biggest tour
nament of the year. Seeded fourth, they
easily disposed of the number three
Eugene, Oregon team but lost to Berke
ly in the semi-finals.
"One of the things that makes us a
real good team," said Foy, "is that we
have a lot of athletes who recently
picked up the game." Whereas some of
their opponents — Berkeley Flying
Circus, Santa Cruz Chaos, San Jose Disc
Magicians, and the Medflies — rely on
"Frisbee players," Stanford team is
mostly composed of athletes; "it's an
athletic game, and we're a strong and
fast team," said Foy.
Although Ultimate is gaining popu
larity, not many students realize that
"we (Stanford) were one of the first col
leges tooffer Ultimate Frisbee,"accord
ing to Mcßann. He added, "It's an excit
ing, refreshing, different kind of sport
that you can get credit for."
One of the reasons he loves Frisbee
so much is that is can be played either
"superficially or seriously. That's the
beauty of Frisbee — it can be taken on a
recreational or professional level."
Ffis calling card? A four-inch frisbee.

so much is that is can be played either
"superficially or seriously. That's the
beauty of Frisbee — it can be taken on a
recreational or professional level."
Ffis calling card? A four-inch frisbee.

In the 19205, students at Yale and
Harvard used to buy Frisbee pies, eat
them, and then play catch with the
empty tins. Thus, the sport of Frisbee
was invented.
Sixty years later, Frisbee is enjoying
an all-time high in popularity, and is still
growing. According to Tom Mcßann,
Stanford's "local world champion,"
"more Frisbees are sold each year than
baseballs, basketballs and footballs
combined."
A majority of these discs go toward
the practice and playing of America's
newest team sport — Ultimate Frisbee.
When Mcßann came to The Farm
nine years ago, at the age of 22, people
were already playing Ultimate. For the
past decade, he has coordinated a cam
pus Frisbee program that has grown
from Bridge sponsorship to ASSU to in
tramurals to a club sport and finally to a
credit course.
Mcßann carries with him an im
pressive Frisbee background. In 1975
while playing on Stanford's Ultimate
team, he was named a Western Ul
timate Champion. Last year, in San
Francisco's Golden Gate Park, he set a
Guinness World Record for "longest
throw of any object in the history of
man."
Mcßann hurled a Skyro, a "high tech
nology distance" type frisbee (a plastic
disc with a hole in the middle) 286 yards,
easily eclipsing the old mark set by a
man wielding a boomerang.
Mcßann presently serves as advisor to

Stanford's Ultimate team. The team, un
der the leadership of co-presidents
Brett Foy and Bob Bhisitkul, meets three
times a weeek and usually plays a
league game or in a tournament on the
weekend.
Unlike many Stanford sports, this is a
year-round activity, and thus represents
a serious committment for the approx
imately 20 team members. "That's no
problem," one member said, "it's so
much fun, it's addictive."
According to the International
Frisbee Association's Official Rules, Ul
timate is a fast moving, competitive,
non-contact sport played by two teams
of seven people each.
Although any regular player would
refute the "non-contact" clause, there
is no doubt that this is a sport requiring
a combination of speed, strength, and
perhaps most important, endurance.
The game starts with a throw-off, and
the receiving team advances the Frisbee
by tossing to team members toward an
end zone, much like in football. If the
Frisbee is caught in the end zone, a
point is scored and the team throws off.
If the Frisbee is ever dropped or
knocked down, the opposing team
gains control. No steps are allowed for
the player with the disc. And there is no
referee — a code of honor is employed
and almost always upheld.
"Ultimate Frisbee takes the best part
of football," Foy insisted. "It's like a
football game without any breaks."
"Every player is a quarterback and re
ceiver," Mcßann added. "Each player

has to contribute these qualities for the
team to succeed."
And success is what the Stanford
Synapse (the team name) is striving
for. They are presently ranked number
three on the West Coast, behind teams
from Santa Barbara and Berkeley re
spectively.
They recently returned from the
Western Regionals, the biggest tour
nament of the year. Seeded fourth, they
easily disposed of the number three
Eugene, Oregon team but lost to Berke
ly in the semi-finals.
"One of the things that makes us a
real good team," said Foy, "is that we
have a lot of athletes who recently
picked up the game." Whereas some of
their opponents — Berkeley Flying
Circus, Santa Cruz Chaos, San Jose Disc
Magicians, and the Medflies — rely on
"Frisbee players," Stanford team is
mostly composed of athletes; "it's an
athletic game, and we're a strong and
fast team," said Foy.
Although Ultimate is gaining popu
larity, not many students realize that
"we (Stanford) were one of the first col
leges tooffer Ultimate Frisbee,"accord
ing to Mcßann. He added, "It's an excit
ing, refreshing, different kind of sport
that you can get credit for."
One of the reasons he loves Frisbee
so much is that is can be played either
"superficially or seriously. That's the
beauty of Frisbee — it can be taken on a
recreational or professional level."
