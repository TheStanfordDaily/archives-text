# Forum urges rape education
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Rape is neither a new problem nor
one whirh will disappear from Stan
ford should the rapist responsible for
the recent rash of assaults be caught,
speakers at an ASSU forum stressed
last evening.
"It's important that the evidence
fx l collected, and be collected
privately and properly," Dr. Jim Mc-
Clenahan, director of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, said. "Collection
of evidence is better done right away.
But of course that depends on the
woman's feelings," he said.
McClenahan was one of five pan
elists who spoke briefly and then
fielded questions from about 40 peo
ple on hand in Kresge Auditorium.
Mso addressing the group were
Chief Marvin Herrington of the Stan
ford Police, Helen Neally from the
Rape Education Project, Pat Berge
from the Women's Center and Andy
Cargile from SURE.
The forum was sponsored by the
ASSIJ and was open to the cornmuni
tv, but was not publicized until yes
terday morning, due to a mix-up with
the flyers.
McClenahan explained that both
Cowell and the Medical Center are
able to help rape victims and know
how to collect the evidence neces
sary. He said that Cowell has new fa

cilities and has recently trained its
staff to deal better with the problem
of rape. Victims should not hesitate
to seek help because of embarass
ment or fear, tie stressed.
"According to FBI statistics, 30-50
percent of all women will be raped
sometime in their lifetime. Rape con
cerns everyone on this campus," said
Berge.
Neally maintained that the majori
ty of rapes go unreported and are
often committed by somebody the
victim knows. She said that it is only
the rare instance in which the rapist is
lurking "behind a bush with a knife
in his hand."
Herrington concurred, estimating
that 90 percent of all rapes go un
reported, and that 50 percent of the
rapes on the Stanford campus go un
reported.
"When I say rape, I'm saying in
tercourse when the woman doesn't
want it," Neally said. "It can happen
in her own house, in her own apart
ment , in her own dormitory."
"Sometimes a victim wonders
'why?' The problem is convincing her
that her sense of violation is real, is
valid, and will be paid attention to,"
Neallv said.
Neally said the problem of rape is
sociological and cannot be thor
oughly dealt with until men and
women begin to become educated

to the sociological and cultural
"mythology" behind rape.
Herrington said he thinks one or
perhaps two people are responsible
for the recent attacks on campus,
adding that campus police have in
creased security to deal with the situ
ation.
Generally, there are three to four
officers on at any given time, but
within the last week there have been
as many as 20 officers patrolling the
campus, according to Herrington.
"We've instituted plainclothes po
lice with the hope we might prevent
a rape or even get a suspect," he said.
He praised the level of campus
awareness about the problem, but
said that even if the rapist is caught,
"the problem doesn't go away."
Herrington said he thought stu
dent patrol groups were a good idea
if they were on the "look-out" for
suspicicous activity, but he said he
hoped that "vigilante-like groups"
would not develop.
Cargile, student director of SURE,
said that they've been averaging
about 18 calls a night.
Following the meeting, whistles
were distributed to the women on
hand. Purchased by the ASSU with
the help of several other campus
groups, they will be distributed today
and tomorrow in White Pla/a and the
Quad.
