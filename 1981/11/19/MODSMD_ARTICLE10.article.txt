Belfast, Northern Ireland (AP) â€” Britain's top
nffic ial in Northern Ireland was punched in the
head Tuesday when hundreds of mourners
shouting "murderer" anil "traitor" surged
through police lines and besieged him at the fu
net.tl of a Protestant member of Parliament slain
'In the IRA.
Meanwhile, gunmen believed to be Protes
tant extremists shot and killed a Catholic, while
the Irish Republican Army shot and seriously
wounded a police reservist. Another reservist
shot last week bv the IRA died in a hospital, of
ficials said.
lames Prior, Britain's Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland, was mobbed when he arrived
at the tin\ Presbyterian church in the Fast Belfast
suburb of Dundonald to attend services for the
Re\ Robert Bradford, a member of the British
Parliament gunned down in Belfast last Saturday.
Visibly shaken, Prior was hustled into the
church bv security officers. Later, as he left the
church, several reporters close to Prior said he
was pinned against a wall and hit on the head by
someone's fist as a howling mob of 300 surged
toward him. A bodyguard put his hands over

Prior's head to fond off more blows, the re
porters said.
A wedge of armod policemen charged into
the crowd and put Prior into a bulletproof lim
ousine. The car was surrounded and kicked and
several people were hurt in the five-minute
melee. \ spokesman said Prior was unhurt.
The angry Protestant crowd was protesting
Britain's failure to crack down on the IRA.
Tens of thousands of Protestants throughout
the province stopped work to attend rallies and
memorial services for Bradford. Many Protes
tant-owned pubs closed and some Belfast taxi
drivers blocked off roads. As Bradford's coffin
was driven to the cemetery, scores of men lining
the route gave clenched-fist salutes.
After Bradford was buried in Donaghadee
Cemetery on Belfast's outskirts, the Rev. Lan
Paisley, Ulster's firebrand Protestant leader, de
clared, "The British government has decided
that the war on the IRA is not to be won. But they
can't govern Northern Ireland without our con
sent."
Paisley said he is planning a large rally for
Monday.
