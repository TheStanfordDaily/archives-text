## Does the LSJUMB need revamping? Opinions vary widely 
### Debbie Appel 
The Leland Stanford junior
University Marching Band is
under close scrutiny these
days, and a feeling of change is
in the air Controversy over the
quality of the band's per
formance and the level of its
musical integrity has become a
popular subject among Stan
ford students and adminis
trators.-This has caused Band
members to do some serious
re-thinking about their or
ganization.
On October 26, 7he Stanford
Daily advised students to vote
against giving the Band the
two-quarter fee assessment it
requested. The Daily claimed
that the Band's shows "simply
haven't been good" and that
band members are unwilling to
reciprocate student support.
TheDai/yasserted that withold
ing the fee assessment would
be a "clear message" that stu
dents "expect higher quality
performances."
Many students apparently
agreed with the Daily's
charges, evidenced by the
large number of "no" votes the
Band actually received in the
Oct. 29-30 elections.
Sophomore Bryan Frazier
summed up many of students
complaints about the Band."
They're old. They need new
stuff — a new twist. They don't
surprise you any more."
Freshman Rodney Robinson
added, "They're obnoxious
and crude. I'd rather have a
marching band."
Another freshman, Jim
Kosciolek believes the band is
overrated, saying that "I don't
think they are what they claim
to be. They also seem like
they're performing for them
selves."
A large majority of students
questioned said that although
they liked the energy of the
Band, they did not feel their
musical performance was very
professional.
Freshmen who expressed
dislike of the Band were far
more eager to vocalize their
opinions than other students.
Many upperclassmen, while
, admitting they didn't like the
band objected vehemently to
being quoted in the Daily.
Some feared that a public dec

laration of their disfavor might
bring about reprisal from angry
band members.
Community members and
Stanford alumni have also ex
pressed criticism of the Band.
President Donald Kennedy ad
mitted he has received "a lot of
angry mail."
But some of the letters con
tain thoughtful criticism. "It
isn't just people objecting to
the Band's political statements
or obscenity. People offer valid
comments on style and in
genuity," said Kennedy.
Kennedy said he considered
himself a big fan of the band. "I
was one of the its enthusiasts
when it first broke from tradi
tion."
However, he feels that the
Band is not as good musically as
it was a decade ago, and that
the decline has been a gradual
process. Kennedy senses the
need for some new creative
energy.
"The Band found the niche
they had carved out for them
\

selves, they're not so unique
anymore. They're trying old
things raised to a new power
and they're having trouble
bringing it off," he said.
Kennedy believes the Band
could easily "win back old fans
and get some new ones if they
tried to combine a little more
tradition with more creative
stuff. Vou don't give away indi
viduality by being traditional."
He said the Band has had some
"clearly great moments" this
year, and said he sympathized
with them because "it's awfully
hard to be funny week after
week."
President Kennedy em
phasized that the Band is will
ing to change. "I have not
found the Band reluctant to lis
ten to advice or review its own
performances. I appreciate all
the things the Band does for
the community that it doesn't

have to do," he said.
Gary Cava 11 i, the athletic de
partment's liason with the
band, stated that the critical let
ters the school receives "are
not a reflection of this year's
band. A negative attitude has
built up over the past five to
seven years. Shows were not
quite as funny as they used to
be. The Band stooped to sensa
tionalism to get reactions. They
couldn't be funny so they tried
to be gross."
According to Cavalli, this
year's Band is not the culprit. "I
think this year's band is better
than past few years. I he leader
ship is exceptional."
Cavalli emphasized that
change "is a gradual thing. The
declineof thepastyearsisslow

ly being reversed."
Band manager "Disco" Ray
Gruenewald, believes that
much of the criticism of the
Band is justified. "We're learn
ing from what's been happen
ing. Band members are willing
to make changes that have
good reason behind them.
We're willing to put in a little
work, which is quite different
from the band of, say, three to
four years ago. They didn't per
ceive the need to change, nor
to justify their actions."
Gruenwald was critical of the
Daily's Oct. 26 editorial, and
believes it probably con
tributed to the myth that the

Band fee assessment funds go
toward beer. FHe feels that had
the fee assessment been voted
down, "the effort toward im
provement would have been
destroyed."
According to john Howard,
assistant manager of the Band,
"people think we're unaware
of what's happening. People
assume we're not trying to stop
negative attitudes. Sure we like
to go out and have fun, but we
do care a lot about our public
image. Band members are in
credibly bummed that the stu

dents have turned against
them."
Gruenwald says that one of
the most legitimate criticisms
concerns halftime per
formances at football games.
"The band member that shows
up only on Saturday morning
doesn't know the music and
doesn't really care about any
thing but going out and having
a good time."
These members don't show
up for weekly rehearsals, and
often include senior "ringers"
who feel they have the right to
march with the Band at least
once before they graduate, he
said.
"People tend to focus on the
individuals — "the person
playing the garbage lid, or in
the gorilla suit. People start for
getting about the music. The
audience eventually gets tired
of it. It starts to look shabby,"
said Gruenwald.
Gruenwald and Howard de
nied that the quality of musical
performance has gone down,
but agree that the Band needs
some new creative forces and
more input from Band mem
bers.
Steps are being taken to deal
with the "Saturday morning"
band members, as part of the
music and format changes that
will be instituted next year.
"The Band had considerable
input into the new program,"
according to Howard, "no one
can tell the Band what to do.
The Band wants to improve. Ev
eryone is willing to change."
Of course, a great number of
Stanford students are still true
devotees of the old Stanford
Band, and quite willing to de
fend it against current
criticism. Sophomore Heidi
Almquist believes the band is
"colorful, original and un
inhibited." Sometimes they do
get obnoxious, but they're def
initely not old or boring."
Freshman Joe Sinner ad
mitted, "they're kind of obnox
ious, but I like the obnoxious
ness."
And senior Brian Boorstein
spoke for many when he said,
"The band is not boring,
they're very entertaining!
Their music is great. I go to
football games just for the half
time show."
