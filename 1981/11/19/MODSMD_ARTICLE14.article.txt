# Bringing hunger to Stanford for a day
## 
### Katie Smith 
In 1975 a group of students met to dis
cuss their concern for the Sahel famine dis
aste. ?v decided to organize a campus
fast in response to the issue and, through
University Food Service Cooperation,
raised $1500 for food relief in the Sahel.
Thus the Stanford Committee on Hun
ger (SCOH) was born.
Steve Hansch, one of the committee's
first members, recalled "we were not ide
ological ... we were just basically con
cerned about all the starving children in
the whole damn world."
Today, SCOH members are still con
cerned about the world's hunger problem
and are organizing programs to address
the issue. Arranging for the annual Fast
Day coordinated with Food Service con
tinues to be the largest single endeavor of
SCOH members.
This year's fast will take place November
24, and organizer Gerry Scallon reported
that already there have been record sign
ups for participation.
Over 1200 students have signed up for
meal card turn-in, and Scallon predicted
from past experience that one and a half
times that many people will actually partic
ipate. Also, a number of co-ops,
fraternities and self-ops have made inde
pendent arrangements to participate in
the fast.
"I think it's important that people see
the fast as an educational event in the
broad sense â€” not only intellectually, but
also experientiallv. It's important that peo
ple know what it's like to feel even a bit
hungry," said Scallon.
SCOH has organized a series of educa
tional events surrounding the fast. High

lights will be a reggae band concert in
White Plaza at noon, on Monday and a
speech bv Cesar Chavez, president of the
United Farm Workers, on "The Hungry
People Who Feed Us" at 7:30 in Cubberley
Auditorium that night.
Fast Day itself will feature a noon-hour
"Foodless Faire" in White Plaza with
speakers and entertainment, an ecu
menical Hunger Service at 4:15 in Memori
al Church, and a 7 p.m. panel discussion in
Term.in Auditorium on East African hun
ger relief. The Panelists will be Prof. David
Abernathy of the University's Political Sci
ence Department, Nick Allen from the In
stitute for Food and Development Policy in
San Francisco, and Michael Watts, a pro
fessor of Geography at U.C. Berkeley.
Last year's fast raised $5672.48, which
went to Third World food aid organiza
tions such as Oxfam and CROP, Fast Palo
Alto hunger relief through the Ecumenical
Hunger Project (EHP) and Barrio As
sista nee.
Bvron Bland, minister of staff for United
Campus Christian Ministries, has worked
with SCOH since its formation and person
ally ensures that a committee is organized
each year.
He said the committee has "had dif
ferent foci throughout its existence" and
"had always kept abreast of world issues,"
mentioning the Sahel, domestic hunger,
Camobida and agricultural reform as ex
amples.
Bland said that the committee's present
focus had become broader, partially be
cause with forty members this year the
group is larger than ever before.
Sea I lon said there was no real political or
religious orientation to the committee,
though "anyone who gets involved with

SCOH has a strong sense of right and
wrong." He said he thought that people
might view the l committee as a "safe way to
be radical," but noted that as people get
more involved they seem to want to make
more changes.
"Hunger becomes a prism for looking at
the way our world is organized," said
Scallan.
Bland said he found the Stanford group
unique because of its enthusiasm and di
versity. Membership includes both under
grates and graduate students, majoring in
anything from English to Food Research.
Committee members cited different
reasons for joining. Linda Gonzelez, a sen
ior in Fnglish who said "I had always been
involved in CROP (hunger)walks in high
school, and felt that there was a rela
tionship between the rich and the poor in
our society which was not adequately ad
dressed."
Other members said they just came to a
meeting out of general interest and gradu
ally became more involved.
One spin-off of SCOH is a SWOPSI class
entitled "International Hunger and U.S.
Aid," which was initiated by Hansch and
some fellow SCOH members in the spring
of 1977. It continues to be offered at least
one quarter per year.
Another annual SCOH effort is a spon
sored "Hunger Walk "organized each win
ter quarter, with the proceeds going to a
selected Food Aid Program.
Members of the committee have also
been active in the EHP which provides
emergency food relief for East Palo Alto
families.
Scallan hopes to arrange an "Urban
Plunge" weekend this winter, to give Stan
ford community members an opportunity
to study and experience the life of the un
derprivileged in an inner city environ
ment.
