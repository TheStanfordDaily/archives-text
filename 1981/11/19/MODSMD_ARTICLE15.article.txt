# Israeli prof met wife of Sadat
## 
### Sheri Colberg 
Imagine working in a flourishing medical
center in Israel and finding out that the wife
of an important leader from an opposing
country is coming to visit your unit.
For Dr. Matitiau Zelter, while working at
the Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel,
this was a reality. Jihan el-Sadat, wife of Egyp
tian President Mohammed Anwar el-Sadat,
visited his medical unit during one of Sadat's
"permanent peace" visits made in the past
year. Sadat was not just a visiting dignitary,
but a symbol of peace. "She was a real lady
who was, in looks and behavior, like a
queen," says Zeltzer.
In the luncheon in Haifa, Dr. Zelter and
Mrs. Sadat discussed ideas that "peace may
have to come through the medical field."
"Medicine is a field sacrosanct from war,"
/(>lt/er explained. "Although one-fourth of
the patients who are at my medical center are
Arab, not one has ever been attacked by the
other patients because ot it. People are peo
ple, not nations, and medicine is a base com
mon to all."
It is for many of these same reasons that Dr.
Zeltzer has devoted his life to medicine. He
has come to Stanford for six months to spread
his knowledge and techniques in the field of
pediatrics, including work with premature
babies and reduction of their mortality rate.
"Mv work has not been simple. For the past
thirty years I have had to persevere against
the turmoil in mv world to triumph with new
medical facilities and medical colleges," said
Zelt/er.
"Peace is something Americans take for
granted. Mv concept of peace is totally dif

ferent. For Israelis, the struggle for peace is
incessant, and peace is fragile," said Zeltzer.
Zeltzer said that President Sadat was defi
nitely "pro-Arab," but this had no bearing on
his respect for the Egyptian leader. "Sadat was
,1 serious, strong, brave man who was also
committed to peace in the Middle East and
who was one of the few striving for it with ac
tions," he said.
Or. Zeltzer himself hopes for peace with
Egvpt as much now under new Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak as he did with Sadat.
When asked whether living in Israel is
analogous to existing in fear, Dr. Zeltzer re
sponded, "Living in New York is fear; living in
Israel is stress. One does not fear for his life
dailv, but no one can totally relax."
