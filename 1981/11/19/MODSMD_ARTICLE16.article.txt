## Alec Rawls Abortion is a legitimate plan 
### 
I airi not pro-abortion. I don't think
women should intentionally get
pregnant just so they can have abor
tions, or that women who want to
have children should abort them. But
I am pro-choice. In fact, I think that
parents should be allowed to bump
off their kids until they are one year
old. Not pro-bumping-kids, pro
choice.
I take this position because, on the
one hand it forcesexamination of the
meaning and relevance of the con
cept employed in the abortion de
bate. On the other hand it stresses

I am not pro
abortion....But I am
pro-choice. In fact, I
think that parents
should be allowed to
bump off their kids
until they are one year
old. Not pro-bumping
kids, pro-choice. .. .on
the one hand it forces
examination of the
meaning of the concept
employed in the
abortion debate. On
the other it stresses the
issue of choice.

the issue of choice. Of respecting pa
rents' efforts to deal competently
and sensitively with the difficult de
cisions they face. On the third hand,
which I don't expect everyone to
have, I am sincere in advocating this
position.
Every opponent of abortion con
siders abortion wrong because, from
one point of view or another, the
fetus is deprived of the life it could
have lived.
Suppose, following this reasoning,
we think abortion should be out
lawed. What then about the child
who would have been born if birth
control weren't allowed either? He is
deprived of his life just as much as the
child who is aborted. We'd have to
rule out birth control. And what
about the children who would be
born if we worked like mad to have
every fertile female constantly
knocked up? Thev are no less
deprived of life than the aborted
child. We'd have to do that too.
What distinction could stay these
conclusions? One only — that a
"toul" inhabits the fetus as concep
tion. Stopping the chain of events at
one point deprives a human life.
Stopping the same chain at a dif

ferent point does not. But that is a re
ligious idea. Separation of church
and state won't allow us to use it as a
criterion for legislating. We are stuck
with our conclusion that, to outlaw
abortion, the heaviest burden must
be horn.
That's untenable, and nearly ev
eryone agrees that parents should be
allowed to plan how many kids thev
want to have.
Let me emphasize that the case
where the number of offspring is fix
ed is not a peculiar case that happens
to fit my argument. On the contrary,
the ability to make and carry out a
plan is precisely the issue of choice.
The case of planning is thus the arena
in which pro and anti-choice argu
ments should center.
"Rights," as intoned by the stan
dard "right to life," is another popu
lar anti-abortion approach. Here we
are asked to make a distinction be
tween a potential human life and an
existing human life. The human life,
it is claimed, has a "right" not to have
that life taken away. Thus the ques
tion arises of when a fetus becomes a
human being.
But "rights" aren't something we
are innately endowed with. They are
something we accord to each other
as a basis for civil society. Rights typi
cally are laws, and the advocates of a
right are typically advocates of law. In
considering "rights" it is best just to
consider the reasons for such a law
and not mention the word "right" at
all. "Rights" is a banner of our politi
cal beliefs and should be flown. But
in argument we must turn to what the
word stands for, and not just pro
nounce the word itself.
According a "right to life" that be
gins at conception outlaws parental
choice at that point. But "human
ness" is presumably a scientific de
marcation, like the uniting of sperm
and egg. It need not, and typically
would not, have anything to do with
the reasons we would accord a right,
lust as before, the only view which
would urge this distinction is the re
ligious view. There is no compelling
reason to accord the right upon the
scientific distinction, and basing it
upon the religious distinction is ruled
out.
On what grounds, then, should we
decide when to accord the legal pro
tection of life? Clearly, we don't want
violent attack to be legal under any
circumstances. Whether a mugger
kills an adult, a child, or a fetus, we
want to call him a murderer. We also
wouldn't want to allow parents to
batter their children to death. The
onlv time we want to allow parents to
deprive a life is to enable them con
trol over their own lives, so let's just
consider that case.
Clearly, once a child has surpassed
his tutalage, he need no longer be a

lion of "human-ness" has, itself,
burden to his parents. Thev ran send
him awav. So we have an upper
hound. We ran also formulate a low
er hound. It is an unfortunate fact
tfi.it many perfectly mundane plans
could not he executed without the
possibility of abortion. The parents'
ability to plan weighs in favor of free
dom to abort. The scientific distinc
nothing to sav about rights. Only the
religious conception of rights weighs
against parental choice.
What we should ask ourselves, I
claim, is whether there are anv condi
tions under which we would con
sider such a choice reasonable, like if
the child suffers insurmountable de
formities that will make life short and
miserable. Even if we would never
make such a choice ourselves, it
should be available to others. If,
adopting the tolerant perspective of
liberalism, we can agree that there
might be situations in which we
would not begrudge a couple that
difficult decision should they make
it, then liberalism asks us to allow it.
I can conceive of such decisions,
though not in any situation that
could not be diagnosed and de
liberated upon within a year. Hence I
think that choice should be allowed
up to but not beyond the first year of
an infant's life.
More tricky is the view that the pa
rent should be allowed to make the
decision of suicide for the child, who,
if he is blighted, may never attain a
competence to make that decision
for himself. I think that euthanasia is
an instance when liberalism asks us to
leave some free reign to a guardian's
conscience.
There is always the danger that
making such allowances as liberalism
urges will lead to abuses. We can de
cide to respect the individual's
choice, but it is not possible to insure
thai his choice will indeed c/eserve
respect, that he will bring to bear the
sensitivity and deliberation that jus
tify placing the decision in his hands.
But legislating morality only in
sures moral incompetence. It leads to
rule-oriented society, where an is
sue's legality becomes equivalent to
moral sanctin. If we're in that
quagmire, we'd better start pulling
ourselves out now, though allowing
parents to bump off their infants
might not be the place to start.
Unlike religious beliefs, pater
nalism can in a very few cases provide
legitimate grounds for restricting
choice. But it can never justify infr
inging on parent's basic ability to
plan, which requires that abortion is
legal.

deprived of his life just as much as the
child who is aborted. We'd have to
rule out birth control. And what
about the children who would be
born if we worked like mad to have
every fertile female constantly
knocked up? Thev are no less
deprived of life than the aborted
child. We'd have to do that too.
What distinction could stay these
conclusions? One only — that a
"toul" inhabits the fetus as concep
tion. Stopping the chain of events at
one point deprives a human life.
Stopping the same chain at a dif

ferent point does not. But that is a re
ligious idea. Separation of church
and state won't allow us to use it as a
criterion for legislating. We are stuck
with our conclusion that, to outlaw
abortion, the heaviest burden must
be horn.
That's untenable, and nearly ev
eryone agrees that parents should be
allowed to plan how many kids thev
want to have.
Let me emphasize that the case
where the number of offspring is fix
ed is not a peculiar case that happens
to fit my argument. On the contrary,
the ability to make and carry out a
plan is precisely the issue of choice.
The case of planning is thus the arena
in which pro and anti-choice argu
ments should center.
"Rights," as intoned by the stan
dard "right to life," is another popu
lar anti-abortion approach. Here we
are asked to make a distinction be
tween a potential human life and an
existing human life. The human life,
it is claimed, has a "right" not to have
that life taken away. Thus the ques
tion arises of when a fetus becomes a
human being.
But "rights" aren't something we
are innately endowed with. They are
something we accord to each other
as a basis for civil society. Rights typi
cally are laws, and the advocates of a
right are typically advocates of law. In
considering "rights" it is best just to
consider the reasons for such a law
and not mention the word "right" at
all. "Rights" is a banner of our politi
cal beliefs and should be flown. But
in argument we must turn to what the
word stands for, and not just pro
nounce the word itself.
According a "right to life" that be
gins at conception outlaws parental
choice at that point. But "human
ness" is presumably a scientific de
marcation, like the uniting of sperm
and egg. It need not, and typically
would not, have anything to do with
the reasons we would accord a right,
lust as before, the only view which
would urge this distinction is the re
ligious view. There is no compelling
reason to accord the right upon the
scientific distinction, and basing it
upon the religious distinction is ruled
out.
On what grounds, then, should we
decide when to accord the legal pro
tection of life? Clearly, we don't want
violent attack to be legal under any
circumstances. Whether a mugger
kills an adult, a child, or a fetus, we
want to call him a murderer. We also
wouldn't want to allow parents to
batter their children to death. The
onlv time we want to allow parents to
deprive a life is to enable them con
trol over their own lives, so let's just
consider that case.
Clearly, once a child has surpassed
his tutalage, he need no longer be a

lion of "human-ness" has, itself,
burden to his parents. Thev ran send
him awav. So we have an upper
hound. We ran also formulate a low
er hound. It is an unfortunate fact
tfi.it many perfectly mundane plans
could not he executed without the
possibility of abortion. The parents'
ability to plan weighs in favor of free
dom to abort. The scientific distinc
nothing to sav about rights. Only the
religious conception of rights weighs
against parental choice.
What we should ask ourselves, I
claim, is whether there are anv condi
tions under which we would con
sider such a choice reasonable, like if
the child suffers insurmountable de
formities that will make life short and
miserable. Even if we would never
make such a choice ourselves, it
should be available to others. If,
adopting the tolerant perspective of
liberalism, we can agree that there
might be situations in which we
would not begrudge a couple that
difficult decision should they make
it, then liberalism asks us to allow it.
I can conceive of such decisions,
though not in any situation that
could not be diagnosed and de
liberated upon within a year. Hence I
think that choice should be allowed
up to but not beyond the first year of
an infant's life.
More tricky is the view that the pa
rent should be allowed to make the
decision of suicide for the child, who,
if he is blighted, may never attain a
competence to make that decision
for himself. I think that euthanasia is
an instance when liberalism asks us to
leave some free reign to a guardian's
conscience.
There is always the danger that
making such allowances as liberalism
urges will lead to abuses. We can de
cide to respect the individual's
choice, but it is not possible to insure
thai his choice will indeed c/eserve
respect, that he will bring to bear the
sensitivity and deliberation that jus
tify placing the decision in his hands.
But legislating morality only in
sures moral incompetence. It leads to
rule-oriented society, where an is
sue's legality becomes equivalent to
moral sanctin. If we're in that
quagmire, we'd better start pulling
ourselves out now, though allowing
parents to bump off their infants
might not be the place to start.
Unlike religious beliefs, pater
nalism can in a very few cases provide
legitimate grounds for restricting
choice. But it can never justify infr
inging on parent's basic ability to
plan, which requires that abortion is
legal.

that life taken away. Thus the ques
tion arises of when a fetus becomes a
human being.
But "rights" aren't something we
are innately endowed with. They are
something we accord to each other
as a basis for civil society. Rights typi
cally are laws, and the advocates of a
right are typically advocates of law. In
considering "rights" it is best just to
consider the reasons for such a law
and not mention the word "right" at
all. "Rights" is a banner of our politi
cal beliefs and should be flown. But
in argument we must turn to what the
word stands for, and not just pro
nounce the word itself.
According a "right to life" that be
gins at conception outlaws parental
choice at that point. But "human
ness" is presumably a scientific de
marcation, like the uniting of sperm
and egg. It need not, and typically
would not, have anything to do with
the reasons we would accord a right,
lust as before, the only view which
would urge this distinction is the re
ligious view. There is no compelling
reason to accord the right upon the
scientific distinction, and basing it
upon the religious distinction is ruled
out.
On what grounds, then, should we
decide when to accord the legal pro
tection of life? Clearly, we don't want
violent attack to be legal under any
circumstances. Whether a mugger
kills an adult, a child, or a fetus, we
want to call him a murderer. We also
wouldn't want to allow parents to
batter their children to death. The
onlv time we want to allow parents to
deprive a life is to enable them con
trol over their own lives, so let's just
consider that case.
Clearly, once a child has surpassed
his tutalage, he need no longer be a

lion of "human-ness" has, itself,
burden to his parents. Thev ran send
him awav. So we have an upper
hound. We ran also formulate a low
er hound. It is an unfortunate fact
tfi.it many perfectly mundane plans
could not he executed without the
possibility of abortion. The parents'
ability to plan weighs in favor of free
dom to abort. The scientific distinc
nothing to sav about rights. Only the
religious conception of rights weighs
against parental choice.
What we should ask ourselves, I
claim, is whether there are anv condi
tions under which we would con
sider such a choice reasonable, like if
the child suffers insurmountable de
formities that will make life short and
miserable. Even if we would never
make such a choice ourselves, it
should be available to others. If,
adopting the tolerant perspective of
liberalism, we can agree that there
might be situations in which we
would not begrudge a couple that
difficult decision should they make
it, then liberalism asks us to allow it.
I can conceive of such decisions,
though not in any situation that
could not be diagnosed and de
liberated upon within a year. Hence I
think that choice should be allowed
up to but not beyond the first year of
an infant's life.
More tricky is the view that the pa
rent should be allowed to make the
decision of suicide for the child, who,
if he is blighted, may never attain a
competence to make that decision
for himself. I think that euthanasia is
an instance when liberalism asks us to
leave some free reign to a guardian's
conscience.
There is always the danger that
making such allowances as liberalism
urges will lead to abuses. We can de
cide to respect the individual's
choice, but it is not possible to insure
thai his choice will indeed c/eserve
respect, that he will bring to bear the
sensitivity and deliberation that jus
tify placing the decision in his hands.
But legislating morality only in
sures moral incompetence. It leads to
rule-oriented society, where an is
sue's legality becomes equivalent to
moral sanctin. If we're in that
quagmire, we'd better start pulling
ourselves out now, though allowing
parents to bump off their infants
might not be the place to start.
Unlike religious beliefs, pater
nalism can in a very few cases provide
legitimate grounds for restricting
choice. But it can never justify infr
inging on parent's basic ability to
plan, which requires that abortion is
legal.
