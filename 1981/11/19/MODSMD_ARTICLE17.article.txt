## Male escort proposal 'blind, irrational' 
### 
' As I was reading the Daily opinions
page a letter from Jeanne Fleming
and Susan Hammon, (Daily, Nov. 13)
caught my attention. It made the lu
dicrous suggestion that there ought
to be an escort service to accompany
all males around campus after dark to
prevent future rapes. While I am also
very concerned and outraged by the
recent rapes on campus, I strenuous
ly resent Fleming and Hammond's
suggestion that all men are to blame
for the acts of a few, sick deviants.
Their proposal struck me, at first, as
effective devices to put the issue into
perspective for males, but then I read
on: "this is not a facetious sugges
tion." Picking up my jaw off the floor,
I immediately flew into a tirade.
Hammond's and Fleming's sugges
tions do nothing to prevent rape but
onlv serve to create an air of distrust
and fear of all men by women. I re
sent their accusation that I, as a male,
am a danger to women — a future
rapist. Furthermore, the male-escort
proposal and the ban on males in se
cluded areas are blind, irrational, and
vengeful proposals that unjustly
deprive innocent men of the free
dom that Fleming and Hammond so
rightly value
Are these extremist tactics the
solution to the serious problem of
rape? (jranted, today's society often
perpetuates an air of disrespect for
women, yet their "solutions" only
exarcerbate the problem by polariz
ing the sexes and creating a feeling of.
resentment by males against such
warranted and unjustified attacks.

I am somewhat troubled by the
opinions expressed by Joe Walder in
a recent (Daily, Nov. 12) column en
titled "Military research on the rise."
In his usual dramatic style, Walder
criticizes his fellow scientists for ac
cepting research money from mili
tary sources, without regard for the
nature of that research. The implica
tion is that if it's funded from the de
fense budget, it is evil.
For example, he cites a research
project in the School of Earth Sci
ences which is supported by the
Navv, but doesn't tell us that physical
properties of sand grains are the sub
ject of the research. One of the prin
cipal applications of the work is to
lietter understand the mechanics of
landslides and how to predict and
prevent them.
Such proposals smack of the govern
ment's policy of internment of
Japanese-Americans in concentra
tion camps during World War 11.
Surely as a sociologist, Fleming can
not fail to see the drastic conse
quences, the counter-productivity,
of her solutions to the problem.
Instead of declaring war on all
males, let's all — men and women —
declare war on rapists. Believe it or
not, many of us males are as outraged
and shocked as you are, but I person
ally do not think that locking myself
up in the Santa Clara County jail will

If I follow his line of reasoning, he
would halt electronic min
iaturization research because it
could make missiles more accurate.
Of course, it could also make pocket
calculators more powerful and
domestic air travel safer. Almost all
research in high speed aerodynamics
would have to stop to satisfy Walder
because nothing travels faster than
the speed of sound except ICBMs.
Forget about those weather and
communication satellites. They are
unnecessary luxuries anyway. And
what about recombinate DNA re
search? Should we lose the tremen
dous benefits available to us because
of the possibility of military misuse?
The truth is that every technolog
ical advance, from better plastics to
laser communication, has military
ramifications and it doesn't matter
who pays for it. Therefore individual
scientists should be aware of the ul
timate applications of their own work
and consciously decide if they want
to contribute to those goals. Censor
ingscientific research by not working
on anything of interest to the Pen
tagon is not likely to hasten world
peace or improve the lot of human
ity. It is likely however, to make it
hard for many good grad students to
ever get a Ph.D.

I found it amusing that on the same
day that Tracy Minkin's editorial
"Creativity: a double-edged sword"
mocked the overblown style of some
of her fellow writers (Daily, Nov. 16),
an article on the front page said of
the returning space shuttle Colum
bia: "One could see its broken white
trail, streaks that looked like tracer
bullets in a World War II movie as
thev crossed the sky. The shuttle dis
appeared in a cloud as it turned
around Boron, leaving its trail look
ing like the (lotted white passing lane

For the past 14 years I have been
walking to and from work at the
Bechtel International Center from
mv home in Menlo Park. My route is
from near the Alameda de Las Pulgas
to Searsville Road, crossing the
bridge over the San Francisquito
Creek on Willow Road, along the
Golf Course.
The bike path at Searsville con
nects the campus to Menlo Park and
Palo Alto. It is used by many students,
faculty, and staff, Oak Creek apart
ment residents, PRC Scholars, SLAC
personnel and joggers at different
times. Somehow, because of the
wide, open spaces and fields it looks
empty, lovely, lonely and now —
thre,itening most of the time. My
daughter, a junior here called me
many times and reported turning
back because of suspicious looking
men standing and blocking both
ends. I have reported exhibitionists
and suspicious characters along the
path.
I walk with an acute sense of suspi
cion and fear and my enjoyment and
relaxation are being substituted by a
feeling of humiliation and ever in
creasing rage. Incessant fear is not
good company.
At this time of the year the prob
lem is greatly compounded by the
fact that the Searsville Path is very
dark. There are no lights whatsoever.
Environmentalists and nature lov
ers constantly proclaim the rewards
of walking and I am sure that the pol
lution and [larking problems gener
ated by coming this short distance
could be minimized if the University
could install lights along Searsville
Road More lights are needed all
over the Campus. I hope this sugges
tion will be considered and more
people will feel encouraged to walk
instead of driving. Thank you for
bringing this issue to the attention of
the public.

' As I was reading the Daily opinions

caught my attention. It made the lu
dicrous suggestion that there ought
to be an escort service to accompany
all males around campus after dark to
prevent future rapes. While I am also
very concerned and outraged by the
recent rapes on campus, I strenuous
ly resent Fleming and Hammond's
suggestion that all men are to blame
for the acts of a few, sick deviants.
Their proposal struck me, at first, as
effective devices to put the issue into
perspective for males, but then I read
on: "this is not a facetious sugges
tion." Picking up my jaw off the floor,
I immediately flew into a tirade.
Hammond's and Fleming's sugges
tions do nothing to prevent rape but
onlv serve to create an air of distrust
and fear of all men by women. I re
sent their accusation that I, as a male,
am a danger to women — a future
rapist. Furthermore, the male-escort
proposal and the ban on males in se
cluded areas are blind, irrational, and
vengeful proposals that unjustly
deprive innocent men of the free

I am somewhat troubled by the
opinions expressed by Joe Walder in
a recent (Daily, Nov. 12) column en
titled "Military research on the rise."
In his usual dramatic style, Walder
criticizes his fellow scientists for ac
cepting research money from mili
tary sources, without regard for the
nature of that research. The implica
tion is that if it's funded from the de
fense budget, it is evil.
For example, he cites a research
project in the School of Earth Sci
ences which is supported by the
Navv, but doesn't tell us that physical
properties of sand grains are the sub
ject of the research. One of the prin
cipal applications of the work is to
lietter understand the mechanics of
landslides and how to predict and
prevent them.
Such proposals smack of the govern
ment's policy of internment of
Japanese-Americans in concentra
tion camps during World War 11.
Surely as a sociologist, Fleming can
not fail to see the drastic conse
quences, the counter-productivity,
of her solutions to the problem.
Instead of declaring war on all
males, let's all — men and women —
declare war on rapists. Believe it or
not, many of us males are as outraged
and shocked as you are, but I person
ally do not think that locking myself
up in the Santa Clara County jail will

If I follow his line of reasoning, he
would halt electronic min
iaturization research because it
could make missiles more accurate.
Of course, it could also make pocket
calculators more powerful and
domestic air travel safer. Almost all
research in high speed aerodynamics
would have to stop to satisfy Walder
because nothing travels faster than
the speed of sound except ICBMs.
Forget about those weather and
communication satellites. They are
unnecessary luxuries anyway. And
what about recombinate DNA re
search? Should we lose the tremen
dous benefits available to us because
of the possibility of military misuse?
The truth is that every technolog
ical advance, from better plastics to
laser communication, has military
ramifications and it doesn't matter
who pays for it. Therefore individual
scientists should be aware of the ul
timate applications of their own work
and consciously decide if they want
to contribute to those goals. Censor
ingscientific research by not working
on anything of interest to the Pen
tagon is not likely to hasten world
peace or improve the lot of human
ity. It is likely however, to make it
hard for many good grad students to
ever get a Ph.D.
