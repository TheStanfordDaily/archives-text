## Job market tight for baby boomers 
### 
Columbus, Ohio — On a recent
Sunday evening, five friends in their
mid-20s gathered around a kitchen
table to eat dinner and watch 60
Minutes.
They were some of the brightest
graduates of this state's public uni
versity system. Since college, how
ever, each one had been forced to
abandon his or her career plan and
take what jobs were available. It had
been a matter of survival.
• Howard, an English major, gave
up pursuing a master's degree to
work in a bookstore.
• Tammy, a would-be commercial
designer, is helping remodel a down
town department store.
• John, who has a bachelor's
degree in music, had to settle for
coaching young clarinetists one
night per week. '
• Mary, John's wife, now drives a
school bus part-time and waits for
political campaign work.
After years of school apd tuition
loan repayments, these young Amer
icans know that the economy has
been hard on them. None needed to
be told by President Ronald Reagan
that the country was in a "bit of re
cession." They've done their best to
find work near their fields, or change
vocations entirely.
Yet a bigger test of their flexibility
lies ahead. Children of the baby
boom generation are in for wh.at the
VVa// Street Journal calls a crunch in

white-collar "middle-management"
jobs.
According to the lournal, the next
10 years will see dark days for Ameri
cans between 18 and 35. The job pro
motions and salary increases they're
expecting won't be as plentiful as ev
eryone would like.
It's mathematical: Though the
population of Americans who would
normally compete for management
related jobs will rise more than 40
percent by 1990, the number of job
openings will only swell about 20
percent during that period. Our
friends should be prepared to handle
the crunch, but few are expecting it.
In popular terms, millions of baby
boomers won't reach the upper
rungs on the "ladder of success" that
they always assumed were within
their grasp. It's not uncommon today
to find 35-year-old supervisors who,
bored with their work, face another
10 years before a decent promotion
comes through.
Compensating for the loss of rou
tine advancement won't be a snap for
our friends. After all, our nation has
worshipped promotions and high
salaries for generations. Where do
you go and what do you do if you
can't "get ahead?"
"Our traditional notions of success
will have to change from both the
point of view of the employer and
employee," said Kenneth Brousseau,
a USC business professor and career
development researcher. "It won't
happen overnight. Horatio Alger is
still very strong in people's minds."
Brousseau told our reporter
Michael Duffy that baby-boomers
best not underestimate the odds
against them. "For the majority, it
would be a mistake to assume that
'I'll be one of the favored few,' " he

adds. "Everyone between 18 and 35 is
going to face unprecedented com
petition and will have to decide if
they want to deal with it."
Soon, younger Americans will be
gin to notice that their older brothers
and sisters in white-collar jobs aren't
going anywhere. And they'll even
tually seek new ways to avoid the un
rewarding rat race.
Rather than moving up what Dis
raeli called the "greasy pole of suc
cess," business professors advise
trying new occupations every five or
10 years.
Sacrificing a traditional career may
seem like a dead-end proposition,
but might be more rewarding in the
long run. New skills and knowledge
are arguably better for personal
growth than yearning for status, pres
tige and authority.
Indeed, surveys of today's business
students show that experience in a
variety of jobs can be preferable to
salary hikes and pressure-filled job
responsibilities. And ironically, re
cent surveys of chief executives also
shows that, once they make it, top
managers attach little value to the
trappings of their positions.
Such reports indicate the nation
may already be altering its notion of a
successful career. And that's good
news to us.
Of course, everyone will adapt to
the times. Many will instead take a
more pessimistic approach and do
anything to get ahead in the coming
crunch.
Like it or not, our flexible contem
poraries will have to become the sur
vivalists of the 1980s. We're counting
on them to be creative trailblazers.

petition and will have to decide if
they want to deal with it."
Soon, younger Americans will be
gin to notice that their older brothers
and sisters in white-collar jobs aren't
going anywhere. And they'll even
tually seek new ways to avoid the un
rewarding rat race.
Rather than moving up what Dis
raeli called the "greasy pole of suc
cess," business professors advise
trying new occupations every five or
10 years.
Sacrificing a traditional career may
seem like a dead-end proposition,
but might be more rewarding in the
long run. New skills and knowledge
are arguably better for personal
growth than yearning for status, pres
tige and authority.
Indeed, surveys of today's business
students show that experience in a
variety of jobs can be preferable to
salary hikes and pressure-filled job
responsibilities. And ironically, re
cent surveys of chief executives also
shows that, once they make it, top
managers attach little value to the
trappings of their positions.
Such reports indicate the nation
may already be altering its notion of a
successful career. And that's good
news to us.
Of course, everyone will adapt to
the times. Many will instead take a
more pessimistic approach and do
anything to get ahead in the coming
crunch.
Like it or not, our flexible contem
poraries will have to become the sur
vivalists of the 1980s. We're counting
on them to be creative trailblazers.

1981 Firlrl Enterprises, Inr
Columbus, Ohio — On a recent
Sunday evening, five friends in their
mid-20s gathered around a kitchen
table to eat dinner and watch 60
Minutes.
They were some of the brightest
graduates of this state's public uni
versity system. Since college, how
ever, each one had been forced to
abandon his or her career plan and
take what jobs were available. It had
been a matter of survival.
• Howard, an English major, gave
up pursuing a master's degree to
work in a bookstore.
• Tammy, a would-be commercial
designer, is helping remodel a down
town department store.
• John, who has a bachelor's
degree in music, had to settle for
coaching young clarinetists one
night per week. '
• Mary, John's wife, now drives a
school bus part-time and waits for
political campaign work.
After years of school apd tuition
loan repayments, these young Amer
icans know that the economy has
been hard on them. None needed to
be told by President Ronald Reagan
that the country was in a "bit of re
cession." They've done their best to
find work near their fields, or change
vocations entirely.
Yet a bigger test of their flexibility
lies ahead. Children of the baby
boom generation are in for wh.at the
VVa// Street Journal calls a crunch in

white-collar "middle-management"
jobs.
According to the lournal, the next
10 years will see dark days for Ameri
cans between 18 and 35. The job pro
motions and salary increases they're
expecting won't be as plentiful as ev
eryone would like.
It's mathematical: Though the
population of Americans who would
normally compete for management
related jobs will rise more than 40
percent by 1990, the number of job
openings will only swell about 20
percent during that period. Our
friends should be prepared to handle
the crunch, but few are expecting it.
In popular terms, millions of baby
boomers won't reach the upper
rungs on the "ladder of success" that
they always assumed were within
their grasp. It's not uncommon today
to find 35-year-old supervisors who,
bored with their work, face another
10 years before a decent promotion
comes through.
Compensating for the loss of rou
tine advancement won't be a snap for
our friends. After all, our nation has
worshipped promotions and high
salaries for generations. Where do
you go and what do you do if you
can't "get ahead?"
"Our traditional notions of success
will have to change from both the
point of view of the employer and
employee," said Kenneth Brousseau,
a USC business professor and career
development researcher. "It won't
happen overnight. Horatio Alger is
still very strong in people's minds."
Brousseau told our reporter
Michael Duffy that baby-boomers
best not underestimate the odds
against them. "For the majority, it
would be a mistake to assume that
'I'll be one of the favored few,' " he

adds. "Everyone between 18 and 35 is
going to face unprecedented com
petition and will have to decide if
they want to deal with it."
