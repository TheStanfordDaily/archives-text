Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
proposing a radical change in the Soviet-Amer
ican yesterday challenged Moscow
to turn <iw.iv from enlarging its military arsenal
and join in reducing nuclear and conventional
forces.
In his first major foreign policy speech, Rea
gan took a firm but conciliatory tone toward
Moscow and offered to cancel deployment of
a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles in Eu
rope if the Soviets would dismantle in
termediate-range missiles that they already
have deployed.
He also sought to reassure the European al
lies that the 1 Soviet Union, not the United
St.ites, stands in the way of reducing tensions.
In <111 extraordinary effort to reach Europe
ans who have been dismayed and alienated by
Reagan's bellicose earlier statements, includ
ing his insistence that a nuclear war limited to
Europe is a possibility, the United States paid
the costs of televising his speech by satellite to
Europe.
Reaction to the speech was guardedly op
timistic among members of the Stanford aca
demic community.
"I'd rather hear Reagan talking this way then
the way he's been talking in recent months,"
said political science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
"It's a step in the right direction."
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the Stanford
I inear Accelerator Center, agreed that the
speech was a positive development. "Any seri
ous negotiations that will lead to a lower level
of nuclear weapons in Europe will be a con-

structive step," he said.
But Marshall had doubts about the equity of
Reagan's proposal. "The proposal lacks a vital
element of symmetry," he said. "The Soviets
will never buy it."
But Drell said that "all negotiations start with
people in opposite corners" and that the
speech could he an attempt to "capture higher
ground" for the United States. He said that the
determination of whether the speech was a
gesture of good faith or a propaganda ploy
would depend on "how the speech translates
into specific instructions at the negotiating
table."
Reagan began on a personal note, recalling
his only meeting with Soviet President Leonid
Hre/hnev 10 years ago and Brezhnev 's pledge
then fo work for peace.
Then Reagan summarized a four-point ap
proach to U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, be
ginning with a proposal under which the Unit
ed States would drop its plans to deploy 572
new cruise and Pershing II missiles in Europe if
the Soviets dismantled the 600 SS-20. SS-4 and
SS-5 intermediate-range missiles deployed in
the western Soviet Union.
Reagan's proposal asks the Soviets to aban
don an existing asset in exchange for a promise
that the United States would forgo future
plans, but he explained that the Soviets must
do more because their recent missile buildup
has created an imbalance between the super
powers.
"The Soviets assert that a balance of in
termediate-range nuclear forces already exists.

I hat assertion is wrong," Reagan said.
The president said Soviet acceptance of his
proposal "would be a historic step. With Soviet
agreement, we could together substantially re
duce the dread threat of nuclear war which
hangs over the people of Europe."
Reagan's proposal, sent in a letter to
Brezhnev about 24 hours before the speech
was delivered, breaks the pattern of the last 20
years in which Washington and Moscow have
sought to limit nuclear weapons.
Arsenals of strategic, long-range missiles as
well as the intermediate-range weapons
should not only be limited, but "substantially
reduced," Reagan proposed.
Asked after his speech what reaction he ex
pects from the * ief Union, the president
shrugged and lifted his hands to indicate he
doesn't know.
Reagan's intermediate-range missile reduc
tion proposal will be put on the table Nov. 30
when U.S. and Soviet negotiators are sched
uled tf> sit down in Geneva for their first talks.
"We intend to negotiate in good faith and go
to Geneva willing to listen to and consider the
proposals of our Soviet counterparts," Reagan
said.
Reagan's second proposal to Brezhnev was
to resume strategic arms talks in January. A sen
ior administration official said Secretary of
State Alexander Haig and Soviet Foreign Min
ister Andrei Gromyko will hold their first
round of talks on strategic weaponry Jan. 26
and 27 in Geneva. To symbolize his new direc
tion, Reagan noted that these talks will be

called START — strategic arms reduction talks
— rather than SALT — strategic arms limitation
talks.
The president said he told Brezhnev "we will
seek to negotiate substantial
clear arms which would result in levels t/vat are
equal and verifiable. Our approach tp veri-/
fication will be to emphasize opennqss an/
creativity — rather than the secrecy
cion which have undermined confideny/nn
arms control in the past."

magazine indicating that the Soviet Union

"While we can hope to benefit from work
done over the past decade in strategic arms ne
gotiations, let us agree to do more than simply
begin where these efforts previously left off.
We can and should attempt major qualitative
and quantitative progress," Reagan said. "Only
such progress can fulfill the hopes of our own
people and the rest of the world."
The president's third proposal calls for a re
duction of non-nuclear forces in Europe. "The
Soviet Union could make no more convincing
contribution to peace than by agreeing to con
strain the potential for sudden agression."

Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
proposing a radical change in the Soviet-Amer
ican yesterday challenged Moscow
to turn <iw.iv from enlarging its military arsenal
and join in reducing nuclear and conventional
forces.
In his first major foreign policy speech, Rea
gan took a firm but conciliatory tone toward
Moscow and offered to cancel deployment of
a new generation of U.S. nuclear missiles in Eu
rope if the Soviets would dismantle in
termediate-range missiles that they already
have deployed.
He also sought to reassure the European al
lies that the 1 Soviet Union, not the United
St.ites, stands in the way of reducing tensions.
In <111 extraordinary effort to reach Europe
ans who have been dismayed and alienated by
Reagan's bellicose earlier statements, includ
ing his insistence that a nuclear war limited to
Europe is a possibility, the United States paid
the costs of televising his speech by satellite to
Europe.
Reaction to the speech was guardedly op
timistic among members of the Stanford aca
demic community.
"I'd rather hear Reagan talking this way then
the way he's been talking in recent months,"
said political science Prof. Hubert Marshall.
"It's a step in the right direction."
Sidney Drell, deputy director of the Stanford
I inear Accelerator Center, agreed that the
speech was a positive development. "Any seri
ous negotiations that will lead to a lower level
of nuclear weapons in Europe will be a con-

structive step," he said.
But Marshall had doubts about the equity of
Reagan's proposal. "The proposal lacks a vital
element of symmetry," he said. "The Soviets
will never buy it."
But Drell said that "all negotiations start with
people in opposite corners" and that the
speech could he an attempt to "capture higher
ground" for the United States. He said that the
determination of whether the speech was a
gesture of good faith or a propaganda ploy
would depend on "how the speech translates
into specific instructions at the negotiating
table."
Reagan began on a personal note, recalling
his only meeting with Soviet President Leonid
Hre/hnev 10 years ago and Brezhnev 's pledge
then fo work for peace.
Then Reagan summarized a four-point ap
proach to U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations, be
ginning with a proposal under which the Unit
ed States would drop its plans to deploy 572
new cruise and Pershing II missiles in Europe if
the Soviets dismantled the 600 SS-20. SS-4 and
SS-5 intermediate-range missiles deployed in
the western Soviet Union.
