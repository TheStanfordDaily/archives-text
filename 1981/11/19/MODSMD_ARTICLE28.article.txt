The people in Satyajit Ray's movies express
their most intense emotions in silence. Su
perb as his screenplays almost always are, it is
faces and not voices, not dialogue that we re
tain afterwards — the faces of men and wom
en in mute torment, rapture, despair. It is the
horror of the sexually insecure Sanjoy
(Shubhendu Chatterjee) in Days and Mights
in the Forest when the unhappy widow Jaya
(Kaberi Bose) makes an unspoken but un
mistakable advance to him. It is the disap
pointment of the bride Aparna (Sharmila
Tagore) in The World of Apu, brought from
the rural estate of wealthy parents to her
husband's dilapidated flat. It is the anxiety of
Apu's mother (Karuna Banerjee) in Aparajito
as she watt lies her teenage son leave their
village l for university life in Calcutta — know
ing that he is growing out of her life forever.
It is the betrayal the child Ratan (Chandana
Banerjee) feels in the first segment of Three
Daughters when the postmaster who has
shown her so much kindness resins his posi
tion — feels so deeply that, meeting him on
the road .is he is leaving, she holds her face
awav from his querying eyes and walks past

him without saving <1 word.
S.itv.ijit Ray — a complete retrospective of
whose films h.is filled much of the schedule
..it Berkeley's Pacific Film Archive over the
past month .tnd a half — is probdhiv the
world's greatest filmmaker (and the most
versatile: he not only writes his own movies,
hut scores them .is well), and vet shocking
few people are aware of him, even now, 26
vears after the release of his first feature,
P.itlwr P.nidhili {Sont> of tho Road). A myth
persists that because they are Indian, Ray's
movies must lie inaccessible to American au

diences, or at least to any but the most
erudite art lovers — those collectors of
esoterica who race to obtain tickets for the
Peking Opera and the touring kabuki thea
ter when they appear in the city. But you
don't have to know anything about Indian
so< ietv to respond to Ray's pictures, any
more than you have to read English history
before seeing Richard II: Rav tells you ev
erything you have to know. Mis movies re
quire onlv the equipment one should bring
to a plav by Chekhov: an eye for the beauty
of unforced details, a willingness to accept
for a couple of hours the unhurried rhythm
of another culture, and an ear sympathetic to
the follies and small tragedies of humanity.
No ureal film tradition exists in Indian film
(though India, along with China, produces
more movies a year than any other country),
so S.itv.ijit Ray, who proved himself a master
with his initial effort, might seem the sudden
gift of some benevolent visiting muse if it
weren't possible to trace the influence in his
work of two other directors, Vittorio De Sica
and lean Renoir, as well as of Rabindranath
Tagore, India's most beloved writer. (Three
Daughters and Charulata are based on
Tagore stories.) In Ray's documentary about
l"agore, who died when Ray was 20 (he is
now 60), we hear the words of a poet reach
ing the end of his life as a second world war
rages, who sees the threads of civilization
"strewn in a heap" but refuses to lose faith in
mankind. I he same faith lights Ray's films,
from The World of Apu, in which the in
describable despair of the widower who re
jects the child born as his mother died,
passes into the joy of father and son re
united; to the new children's fantasy The
Kingdom of Diamonds, a fable in which the
forces of freedom defeat the forces of op
pression by turning their own sorcery against
them. (The World of Apu is the third part of
the Apu trilogv — the first two parts are
Pat her Panchali and Aparajito, or The Un
vaiujuished — which describes the parallel
triumphs of education and love in the life of
a poor village priest's son. Order rises from
( h.ios in the final shot; this is Ray's Oresteia.)

The heritage of Renoir and De Sica is evi
dent in Ray's wide open style, in his treat
ment of character, in the economy of his
means and in the eloquence with which he
delineates emotion. Ray worked on Tho
River, the one picture Renoir shot in India,
and the scenes on the holy Ganga River in
\/),i r.ijitn, as well as the glimpses in Rahin
dr.m.ith fayore of the river in rural Bengal
where Tagore lived on a boat for a time, stem
directly from Renoir. The intimate connec
tion between man and nature, wh.ch Renoir
had explored much earlier than Tho Rivor, in

4 Day in the Country and Rules of the Came,
shows up again and again in Ray's films. Most
dramatically, in both Pat her Panchali and the
"Postmaster" episode of Three Daughters,
nature reflects the inner turmoil of hyman
beings: storms reign outside the hut< of the
si< k and feverish.
In l)e Sica's IJmberto I), a destitute old
man, too proud to beg himself, hides behind
a statue while his dog holds an upturned hat
between its teeth. To De Sica, to Renoir, to
Satvajit Rav, human beings retain some
shred of dignity even in the face of over
powering distress. The mother in Father Pan
chali cannot accept the coin her neighbor
offers her, even though she has no money
for food for her children; the old father in
The liig City is shamed bv the offer of a
former student, now an optometrist, of a
free pair of glasses; the doctor in Distant

Thunder won't permit his wife to buy rice in
.1 "low caste" house in the midst of a famine.
Another director might accentuate the
foolishness of these characters' pride, but for
Rav foolishness is nearly always charming
and often touching — like the wedding night
scenes in "Sampati" (the third episode in
Three Daughters) and The World of Apu —
.ind human*, failings are never ridiculous.
There are so few villains in these films — ex
cept for the children's stories (The Adven
tures of (loopy and B.igha, The Golden Fort,
The Fleph.mt do d. The Kingdom of

Diamonds) — that when we encounter one,
like the disfigured rapist in Distant Thunder,
we don't know how to read him: he throws
us right out of the world of the movie. Gen
erally speaking, even the most reprehensible
< harac ters, if their faults are not exonerated
by the depth of the examination through
which they are put, have at least a fatuous ap
peal the phony miracle worker in The Cow
.irdand the I loly \l,m, with the face of an ov
erfed, super-annuated baby, laughs with im
mense self-satisfaction after each gimmick
he carries off.
A considerable part of Rav's success in
c rearing such sympathetic characters results
from his sensitivity to actors, and his canny
use of the best ones — astonishingly delicate
Sharmila Tagore, Karuna Banerjee, who has
the substance to plav Creek tragedy, Anil

Chatterjee, the verv image of the distraught
intollortu.il who cannot measure up to the
standards he l would like to set for himself,
hilarious Robi Ghosh, and of course
Soumitra Chatterjee, whom Pauline Kael has
called Rav's one-man stock company. Chat
terjee made his first appearance for Rav as
the grown-up Apu in the last part of the
trilogy, giving one of the most painfully ac
< urate depictions on film of the destructive
process of grief: when he learns of his wife's
death, he strikes the messenger — an act
with roots in ancient times — and shuts
himself up in his room, refusing to be com
forted, denying the love due his new child.
Surely this frightening exploration of the
darkest corners of a man's soul would have
suffit cm) to exhibit Chatterjee's subtlety and
control, even if we hadn't had a gallery of
portraits from him: the renegade son in
Devi, the bashful bridegroom in "Sampati,"
the cabbie in Tho Fxpedition, the literary
scholar in Charulata, the young man re
discovering an old lover in The Coward and
the llolv Mm, the arrogant executive in
and Slights in lite Forest, the village
doctor in Distant Thunder.
Distant Thunder, about the man-made
famine of 1942-43, is Rav's most overtly polit
ic al movie — except maybe for the fairy tale
cry for freedom, The Kingdom of Diamonds
—- but all of his pictures observe the progress
of Indian society. If Rav can be said to have
embraced one theme throughout his career,
it is tho gap between the old India of his pa
rents' generation and the new, Westernized
India. Apu's father is a holy man, and as a
child he learns to perform the rituals, but he
longs to be educated — and education leads
him so far from his ancestors that he feels al
ienated when, asa university student, ho wit
nesses the same ritual in which he formerly
took part. (In Aparajito, there's a moment
reminiscent of Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man: Apu, carrying an idol for a re
ligious service, hears children playing and is
drawn to their shouts. We know that life in its
infinite variety will seduce him away from
the ascetic future the priests have mapped
out for him.) Ironically, it is Apu's entrap
ment in an antique custom that brings him
the greatest joy and pain, that really carries

him into the mainstream of life: when the
<ousin of a friend must withdraw from an ar
ranged marriage because the groom turns
out to be mad, Apu is persuaded to sub
stitute so that the family may circumvent dis
grace
As Rav's films come closer and closer to a
contemporary view of his country, the
division between these two worlds is
brought into sharper and sharper focus. Her
in-laws cannot comprehend the motives of a
young woman (Madhabi Vtukherjee) who
takes a job to help support her family in The
liiij Cjtv (1963); eight years later, in Company
l imited (sometimes called The Target), the
parents of a young businessman (Barun
C'handa) whose friends chat about golf and
Rolls Rovces, visit him in the middle of a din
ner party, causing him acute embarrassment.

\nglicization — the monotonous professor
in Aparajito lecturing on synecdoche, the
Britishisms with which the four vacationers
in I).ivs ,uul Nights in the Forest pepper their
speech — has been supplanted bv American
ization. And vet the old hierarchy hangs on:
the servants in Days and Nights are abused;
the rising young electric fan company ex
(•( utive in Company Limited threatens to cut
,1 subordinate's salary for turning on one of
the fans in the summer heat; Somnath
(Pradip Mukherjee), the hero of The Mid
dleman. is summarily told that he can't be
come ,) sales/nan because "peddling" would
be an affront to his Brahmin status.
The Middleman, the third in what has
been referred to as "the Calcutta trilogy"
(following The Adversary and Company Lim
ited). concerns one of the inevitable conse
quences of progress in India: corruption in
business. Somnath discovers that in his posi
tion as "middleman" for a number of firms
- the Bengali word is "dalaal" — he is ex
ported to pimp for clients. The conflict in the
movie is Somnath's inner struggle with his
ideals; when, in the final scene, he obtains a
whore who, he realizes, is the sister of his
hovhood best friend, the movement of the
film from the disillusionment of youthful
idealism to its corruption is complete.
And vet — and vet — nothing in Ray is as
simple as the cynical dismissal of modern so
ciety that The Middleman may appear to be.
Rav hasn't taken us from the instinctive long
ing of the children in Aparajito and "Post
master" and Rabindranath Tagore to be ad
mitted to the sacred society of the educated,
only to throw the rotten fruits of that educa
tion back in our faces. The one truly horri
fying moment in The Kingdom of Diamonds
is a shot of the students in this tvrant-domi
nated land, where the schoolteacher is the
most eagerly hunted rebel, bound and
gagged and about to be brainwashed by the
evil king's magic machine. Nothing could be
clearer in this film than Ray's equation of
education with freedom — and nothing
could be more satisfying than the turnabout
.it the end that obstructs the tyrant and liber
ates tho children. All of Satyajit Ray's movies
could be called Aparajito.

and lean Renoir, as well as of Rabindranath
Tagore, India's most beloved writer. (Three
Daughters and Charulata are based on
Tagore stories.) In Ray's documentary about
l"agore, who died when Ray was 20 (he is
now 60), we hear the words of a poet reach
ing the end of his life as a second world war
rages, who sees the threads of civilization
"strewn in a heap" but refuses to lose faith in
mankind. I he same faith lights Ray's films,
from The World of Apu, in which the in
describable despair of the widower who re
jects the child born as his mother died,
passes into the joy of father and son re
united; to the new children's fantasy The
Kingdom of Diamonds, a fable in which the
forces of freedom defeat the forces of op
pression by turning their own sorcery against
them. (The World of Apu is the third part of
the Apu trilogv — the first two parts are
Pat her Panchali and Aparajito, or The Un
vaiujuished — which describes the parallel
triumphs of education and love in the life of
a poor village priest's son. Order rises from

The heritage of Renoir and De Sica is evi
dent in Ray's wide open style, in his treat
ment of character, in the economy of his
means and in the eloquence with which he
delineates emotion. Ray worked on Tho
River, the one picture Renoir shot in India,
and the scenes on the holy Ganga River in
\/),i r.ijitn, as well as the glimpses in Rahin
dr.m.ith fayore of the river in rural Bengal
where Tagore lived on a boat for a time, stem
directly from Renoir. The intimate connec
tion between man and nature, wh.ch Renoir
had explored much earlier than Tho Rivor, in

4 Day in the Country and Rules of the Came,
shows up again and again in Ray's films. Most
dramatically, in both Pat her Panchali and the
"Postmaster" episode of Three Daughters,
nature reflects the inner turmoil of hyman
beings: storms reign outside the hut< of the
si< k and feverish.
In l)e Sica's IJmberto I), a destitute old
man, too proud to beg himself, hides behind
a statue while his dog holds an upturned hat
between its teeth. To De Sica, to Renoir, to
Satvajit Rav, human beings retain some
shred of dignity even in the face of over
powering distress. The mother in Father Pan
chali cannot accept the coin her neighbor
offers her, even though she has no money
for food for her children; the old father in
The liig City is shamed bv the offer of a
former student, now an optometrist, of a
free pair of glasses; the doctor in Distant

Thunder won't permit his wife to buy rice in
.1 "low caste" house in the midst of a famine.
Another director might accentuate the
foolishness of these characters' pride, but for
Rav foolishness is nearly always charming
and often touching — like the wedding night
scenes in "Sampati" (the third episode in
Three Daughters) and The World of Apu —
.ind human*, failings are never ridiculous.
There are so few villains in these films — ex
cept for the children's stories (The Adven
tures of (loopy and B.igha, The Golden Fort,
The Fleph.mt do d. The Kingdom of

Diamonds) — that when we encounter one,
like the disfigured rapist in Distant Thunder,
we don't know how to read him: he throws
us right out of the world of the movie. Gen
erally speaking, even the most reprehensible
< harac ters, if their faults are not exonerated
by the depth of the examination through
which they are put, have at least a fatuous ap
peal the phony miracle worker in The Cow
.irdand the I loly \l,m, with the face of an ov
erfed, super-annuated baby, laughs with im
mense self-satisfaction after each gimmick
he carries off.
A considerable part of Rav's success in
c rearing such sympathetic characters results
from his sensitivity to actors, and his canny
use of the best ones — astonishingly delicate
Sharmila Tagore, Karuna Banerjee, who has
the substance to plav Creek tragedy, Anil

Chatterjee, the verv image of the distraught
intollortu.il who cannot measure up to the
standards he l would like to set for himself,
hilarious Robi Ghosh, and of course
Soumitra Chatterjee, whom Pauline Kael has
called Rav's one-man stock company. Chat
terjee made his first appearance for Rav as
the grown-up Apu in the last part of the
trilogy, giving one of the most painfully ac
< urate depictions on film of the destructive
process of grief: when he learns of his wife's
death, he strikes the messenger — an act
with roots in ancient times — and shuts
himself up in his room, refusing to be com
forted, denying the love due his new child.
Surely this frightening exploration of the
darkest corners of a man's soul would have
suffit cm) to exhibit Chatterjee's subtlety and
control, even if we hadn't had a gallery of
portraits from him: the renegade son in
Devi, the bashful bridegroom in "Sampati,"
the cabbie in Tho Fxpedition, the literary
scholar in Charulata, the young man re
discovering an old lover in The Coward and
the llolv Mm, the arrogant executive in
and Slights in lite Forest, the village
doctor in Distant Thunder.
Distant Thunder, about the man-made
famine of 1942-43, is Rav's most overtly polit
ic al movie — except maybe for the fairy tale
cry for freedom, The Kingdom of Diamonds
—- but all of his pictures observe the progress
of Indian society. If Rav can be said to have
embraced one theme throughout his career,
it is tho gap between the old India of his pa
rents' generation and the new, Westernized
India. Apu's father is a holy man, and as a
child he learns to perform the rituals, but he
longs to be educated — and education leads
him so far from his ancestors that he feels al
ienated when, asa university student, ho wit
nesses the same ritual in which he formerly
took part. (In Aparajito, there's a moment
reminiscent of Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man: Apu, carrying an idol for a re
ligious service, hears children playing and is
drawn to their shouts. We know that life in its
infinite variety will seduce him away from
the ascetic future the priests have mapped
out for him.) Ironically, it is Apu's entrap
ment in an antique custom that brings him
the greatest joy and pain, that really carries

him into the mainstream of life: when the
<ousin of a friend must withdraw from an ar
ranged marriage because the groom turns
out to be mad, Apu is persuaded to sub
stitute so that the family may circumvent dis
grace
As Rav's films come closer and closer to a
contemporary view of his country, the
division between these two worlds is
brought into sharper and sharper focus. Her
in-laws cannot comprehend the motives of a
young woman (Madhabi Vtukherjee) who
takes a job to help support her family in The
liiij Cjtv (1963); eight years later, in Company
l imited (sometimes called The Target), the
parents of a young businessman (Barun
C'handa) whose friends chat about golf and
Rolls Rovces, visit him in the middle of a din
ner party, causing him acute embarrassment.

\nglicization — the monotonous professor
in Aparajito lecturing on synecdoche, the
Britishisms with which the four vacationers
in I).ivs ,uul Nights in the Forest pepper their
speech — has been supplanted bv American
ization. And vet the old hierarchy hangs on:
the servants in Days and Nights are abused;
the rising young electric fan company ex

the fans in the summer heat; Somnath
(Pradip Mukherjee), the hero of The Mid
dleman. is summarily told that he can't be
come ,) sales/nan because "peddling" would
be an affront to his Brahmin status.
The Middleman, the third in what has
been referred to as "the Calcutta trilogy"
(following The Adversary and Company Lim
ited). concerns one of the inevitable conse
quences of progress in India: corruption in
business. Somnath discovers that in his posi
tion as "middleman" for a number of firms
- the Bengali word is "dalaal" — he is ex
ported to pimp for clients. The conflict in the
movie is Somnath's inner struggle with his
ideals; when, in the final scene, he obtains a
whore who, he realizes, is the sister of his
hovhood best friend, the movement of the
film from the disillusionment of youthful
idealism to its corruption is complete.
And vet — and vet — nothing in Ray is as
simple as the cynical dismissal of modern so
ciety that The Middleman may appear to be.
Rav hasn't taken us from the instinctive long
ing of the children in Aparajito and "Post
master" and Rabindranath Tagore to be ad
mitted to the sacred society of the educated,
only to throw the rotten fruits of that educa
tion back in our faces. The one truly horri
fying moment in The Kingdom of Diamonds
is a shot of the students in this tvrant-domi
nated land, where the schoolteacher is the
most eagerly hunted rebel, bound and
gagged and about to be brainwashed by the
evil king's magic machine. Nothing could be
clearer in this film than Ray's equation of
education with freedom — and nothing
could be more satisfying than the turnabout
.it the end that obstructs the tyrant and liber
ates tho children. All of Satyajit Ray's movies
could be called Aparajito.

The people in Satyajit Ray's movies express
their most intense emotions in silence. Su
perb as his screenplays almost always are, it is
faces and not voices, not dialogue that we re
tain afterwards — the faces of men and wom

horror of the sexually insecure Sanjoy
(Shubhendu Chatterjee) in Days and Mights
in the Forest when the unhappy widow Jaya
(Kaberi Bose) makes an unspoken but un
mistakable advance to him. It is the disap
pointment of the bride Aparna (Sharmila
Tagore) in The World of Apu, brought from
the rural estate of wealthy parents to her
husband's dilapidated flat. It is the anxiety of
Apu's mother (Karuna Banerjee) in Aparajito
as she watt lies her teenage son leave their
village l for university life in Calcutta — know
ing that he is growing out of her life forever.
It is the betrayal the child Ratan (Chandana

few people are aware of him, even now, 26
vears after the release of his first feature,
P.itlwr P.nidhili {Sont> of tho Road). A myth
persists that because they are Indian, Ray's
movies must lie inaccessible to American au

erudite art lovers — those collectors of
esoterica who race to obtain tickets for the
Peking Opera and the touring kabuki thea

(though India, along with China, produces

A considerable part of Rav's success in
c rearing such sympathetic characters results
from his sensitivity to actors, and his canny
use of the best ones — astonishingly delicate
Sharmila Tagore, Karuna Banerjee, who has
the substance to plav Creek tragedy, Anil

Chatterjee, the verv image of the distraught
intollortu.il who cannot measure up to the
standards he l would like to set for himself,
hilarious Robi Ghosh, and of course
Soumitra Chatterjee, whom Pauline Kael has
called Rav's one-man stock company. Chat
terjee made his first appearance for Rav as
the grown-up Apu in the last part of the
trilogy, giving one of the most painfully ac
< urate depictions on film of the destructive
process of grief: when he learns of his wife's
death, he strikes the messenger — an act
with roots in ancient times — and shuts
himself up in his room, refusing to be com
forted, denying the love due his new child.
Surely this frightening exploration of the
darkest corners of a man's soul would have
suffit cm) to exhibit Chatterjee's subtlety and
control, even if we hadn't had a gallery of
portraits from him: the renegade son in
Devi, the bashful bridegroom in "Sampati,"
the cabbie in Tho Fxpedition, the literary
scholar in Charulata, the young man re
discovering an old lover in The Coward and
the llolv Mm, the arrogant executive in
and Slights in lite Forest, the village
doctor in Distant Thunder.
Distant Thunder, about the man-made
famine of 1942-43, is Rav's most overtly polit
ic al movie — except maybe for the fairy tale
cry for freedom, The Kingdom of Diamonds
—- but all of his pictures observe the progress
of Indian society. If Rav can be said to have
embraced one theme throughout his career,
it is tho gap between the old India of his pa
rents' generation and the new, Westernized
India. Apu's father is a holy man, and as a
child he learns to perform the rituals, but he
longs to be educated — and education leads
him so far from his ancestors that he feels al
ienated when, asa university student, ho wit
nesses the same ritual in which he formerly
took part. (In Aparajito, there's a moment
reminiscent of Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man: Apu, carrying an idol for a re
ligious service, hears children playing and is
drawn to their shouts. We know that life in its
infinite variety will seduce him away from
the ascetic future the priests have mapped
out for him.) Ironically, it is Apu's entrap
ment in an antique custom that brings him
the greatest joy and pain, that really carries

him into the mainstream of life: when the
<ousin of a friend must withdraw from an ar
ranged marriage because the groom turns
out to be mad, Apu is persuaded to sub
stitute so that the family may circumvent dis
grace
As Rav's films come closer and closer to a
contemporary view of his country, the
division between these two worlds is
brought into sharper and sharper focus. Her
in-laws cannot comprehend the motives of a
young woman (Madhabi Vtukherjee) who
takes a job to help support her family in The
liiij Cjtv (1963); eight years later, in Company
l imited (sometimes called The Target), the
parents of a young businessman (Barun
C'handa) whose friends chat about golf and
Rolls Rovces, visit him in the middle of a din
ner party, causing him acute embarrassment.

\nglicization — the monotonous professor
in Aparajito lecturing on synecdoche, the
Britishisms with which the four vacationers
in I).ivs ,uul Nights in the Forest pepper their
speech — has been supplanted bv American
ization. And vet the old hierarchy hangs on:
the servants in Days and Nights are abused;
the rising young electric fan company ex
(•( utive in Company Limited threatens to cut
,1 subordinate's salary for turning on one of
the fans in the summer heat; Somnath
(Pradip Mukherjee), the hero of The Mid
dleman. is summarily told that he can't be
come ,) sales/nan because "peddling" would
be an affront to his Brahmin status.
The Middleman, the third in what has
been referred to as "the Calcutta trilogy"
(following The Adversary and Company Lim
ited). concerns one of the inevitable conse
quences of progress in India: corruption in
business. Somnath discovers that in his posi
tion as "middleman" for a number of firms
- the Bengali word is "dalaal" — he is ex
ported to pimp for clients. The conflict in the
movie is Somnath's inner struggle with his
ideals; when, in the final scene, he obtains a
whore who, he realizes, is the sister of his
hovhood best friend, the movement of the
film from the disillusionment of youthful
idealism to its corruption is complete.
And vet — and vet — nothing in Ray is as
simple as the cynical dismissal of modern so
ciety that The Middleman may appear to be.
Rav hasn't taken us from the instinctive long
ing of the children in Aparajito and "Post
master" and Rabindranath Tagore to be ad
mitted to the sacred society of the educated,
only to throw the rotten fruits of that educa
tion back in our faces. The one truly horri
fying moment in The Kingdom of Diamonds
is a shot of the students in this tvrant-domi
nated land, where the schoolteacher is the
most eagerly hunted rebel, bound and
gagged and about to be brainwashed by the
evil king's magic machine. Nothing could be
clearer in this film than Ray's equation of
education with freedom — and nothing
could be more satisfying than the turnabout
.it the end that obstructs the tyrant and liber
ates tho children. All of Satyajit Ray's movies
could be called Aparajito.

The people in Satyajit Ray's movies express
their most intense emotions in silence. Su
perb as his screenplays almost always are, it is
faces and not voices, not dialogue that we re
tain afterwards — the faces of men and wom
en in mute torment, rapture, despair. It is the
horror of the sexually insecure Sanjoy
(Shubhendu Chatterjee) in Days and Mights
in the Forest when the unhappy widow Jaya
(Kaberi Bose) makes an unspoken but un
mistakable advance to him. It is the disap
pointment of the bride Aparna (Sharmila
Tagore) in The World of Apu, brought from
the rural estate of wealthy parents to her
husband's dilapidated flat. It is the anxiety of
Apu's mother (Karuna Banerjee) in Aparajito
as she watt lies her teenage son leave their
village l for university life in Calcutta — know
ing that he is growing out of her life forever.
It is the betrayal the child Ratan (Chandana
Banerjee) feels in the first segment of Three
Daughters when the postmaster who has
shown her so much kindness resins his posi
tion — feels so deeply that, meeting him on
the road .is he is leaving, she holds her face

S.itv.ijit Ray — a complete retrospective of
whose films h.is filled much of the schedule
..it Berkeley's Pacific Film Archive over the
past month .tnd a half — is probdhiv the
world's greatest filmmaker (and the most
versatile: he not only writes his own movies,
hut scores them .is well), and vet shocking
few people are aware of him, even now, 26
vears after the release of his first feature,
P.itlwr P.nidhili {Sont> of tho Road). A myth
persists that because they are Indian, Ray's
movies must lie inaccessible to American au

diences, or at least to any but the most
erudite art lovers — those collectors of
esoterica who race to obtain tickets for the
Peking Opera and the touring kabuki thea
ter when they appear in the city. But you
don't have to know anything about Indian
so< ietv to respond to Ray's pictures, any
more than you have to read English history
before seeing Richard II: Rav tells you ev
erything you have to know. Mis movies re
quire onlv the equipment one should bring
to a plav by Chekhov: an eye for the beauty
of unforced details, a willingness to accept
for a couple of hours the unhurried rhythm
of another culture, and an ear sympathetic to
the follies and small tragedies of humanity.
No ureal film tradition exists in Indian film
(though India, along with China, produces
more movies a year than any other country),
so S.itv.ijit Ray, who proved himself a master
with his initial effort, might seem the sudden
gift of some benevolent visiting muse if it
weren't possible to trace the influence in his
work of two other directors, Vittorio De Sica
and lean Renoir, as well as of Rabindranath
Tagore, India's most beloved writer. (Three
Daughters and Charulata are based on
Tagore stories.) In Ray's documentary about
l"agore, who died when Ray was 20 (he is
now 60), we hear the words of a poet reach
ing the end of his life as a second world war
rages, who sees the threads of civilization
"strewn in a heap" but refuses to lose faith in
mankind. I he same faith lights Ray's films,
from The World of Apu, in which the in
describable despair of the widower who re
jects the child born as his mother died,
passes into the joy of father and son re
united; to the new children's fantasy The
Kingdom of Diamonds, a fable in which the
forces of freedom defeat the forces of op
pression by turning their own sorcery against
them. (The World of Apu is the third part of
the Apu trilogv — the first two parts are
Pat her Panchali and Aparajito, or The Un
vaiujuished — which describes the parallel
triumphs of education and love in the life of
a poor village priest's son. Order rises from
( h.ios in the final shot; this is Ray's Oresteia.)

The heritage of Renoir and De Sica is evi
dent in Ray's wide open style, in his treat
ment of character, in the economy of his
means and in the eloquence with which he
delineates emotion. Ray worked on Tho
River, the one picture Renoir shot in India,
and the scenes on the holy Ganga River in
\/),i r.ijitn, as well as the glimpses in Rahin
dr.m.ith fayore of the river in rural Bengal
where Tagore lived on a boat for a time, stem
directly from Renoir. The intimate connec
tion between man and nature, wh.ch Renoir
had explored much earlier than Tho Rivor, in

4 Day in the Country and Rules of the Came,
shows up again and again in Ray's films. Most
dramatically, in both Pat her Panchali and the
"Postmaster" episode of Three Daughters,
nature reflects the inner turmoil of hyman
beings: storms reign outside the hut< of the
si< k and feverish.
In l)e Sica's IJmberto I), a destitute old
man, too proud to beg himself, hides behind
a statue while his dog holds an upturned hat
between its teeth. To De Sica, to Renoir, to
Satvajit Rav, human beings retain some
shred of dignity even in the face of over
powering distress. The mother in Father Pan
chali cannot accept the coin her neighbor
offers her, even though she has no money
for food for her children; the old father in
The liig City is shamed bv the offer of a
former student, now an optometrist, of a
free pair of glasses; the doctor in Distant

Thunder won't permit his wife to buy rice in
.1 "low caste" house in the midst of a famine.
Another director might accentuate the
foolishness of these characters' pride, but for
Rav foolishness is nearly always charming
and often touching — like the wedding night
scenes in "Sampati" (the third episode in
Three Daughters) and The World of Apu —
.ind human*, failings are never ridiculous.
There are so few villains in these films — ex
cept for the children's stories (The Adven
tures of (loopy and B.igha, The Golden Fort,
The Fleph.mt do d. The Kingdom of

Diamonds) — that when we encounter one,
like the disfigured rapist in Distant Thunder,
we don't know how to read him: he throws
us right out of the world of the movie. Gen

which they are put, have at least a fatuous ap

The people in Satyajit Ray's movies express
their most intense emotions in silence. Su
perb as his screenplays almost always are, it is
faces and not voices, not dialogue that we re
tain afterwards — the faces of men and wom
en in mute torment, rapture, despair. It is the
horror of the sexually insecure Sanjoy
(Shubhendu Chatterjee) in Days and Mights
in the Forest when the unhappy widow Jaya
(Kaberi Bose) makes an unspoken but un
mistakable advance to him. It is the disap
pointment of the bride Aparna (Sharmila
Tagore) in The World of Apu, brought from
the rural estate of wealthy parents to her
husband's dilapidated flat. It is the anxiety of
Apu's mother (Karuna Banerjee) in Aparajito
as she watt lies her teenage son leave their
village l for university life in Calcutta — know
ing that he is growing out of her life forever.
It is the betrayal the child Ratan (Chandana

shown her so much kindness resins his posi

S.itv.ijit Ray — a complete retrospective of

world's greatest filmmaker (and the most
versatile: he not only writes his own movies,
hut scores them .is well), and vet shocking
few people are aware of him, even now, 26
vears after the release of his first feature,
P.itlwr P.nidhili {Sont> of tho Road). A myth
persists that because they are Indian, Ray's
movies must lie inaccessible to American au

diences, or at least to any but the most
erudite art lovers — those collectors of
esoterica who race to obtain tickets for the
Peking Opera and the touring kabuki thea
ter when they appear in the city. But you
don't have to know anything about Indian
so< ietv to respond to Ray's pictures, any
more than you have to read English history
before seeing Richard II: Rav tells you ev
erything you have to know. Mis movies re
quire onlv the equipment one should bring
to a plav by Chekhov: an eye for the beauty
of unforced details, a willingness to accept
for a couple of hours the unhurried rhythm
of another culture, and an ear sympathetic to
the follies and small tragedies of humanity.
No ureal film tradition exists in Indian film
(though India, along with China, produces
more movies a year than any other country),
so S.itv.ijit Ray, who proved himself a master
with his initial effort, might seem the sudden
gift of some benevolent visiting muse if it
weren't possible to trace the influence in his
work of two other directors, Vittorio De Sica
and lean Renoir, as well as of Rabindranath
Tagore, India's most beloved writer. (Three
Daughters and Charulata are based on
Tagore stories.) In Ray's documentary about
l"agore, who died when Ray was 20 (he is
now 60), we hear the words of a poet reach
ing the end of his life as a second world war
rages, who sees the threads of civilization
"strewn in a heap" but refuses to lose faith in
mankind. I he same faith lights Ray's films,
from The World of Apu, in which the in
describable despair of the widower who re
jects the child born as his mother died,
passes into the joy of father and son re
united; to the new children's fantasy The
Kingdom of Diamonds, a fable in which the
forces of freedom defeat the forces of op
pression by turning their own sorcery against
them. (The World of Apu is the third part of
the Apu trilogv — the first two parts are
Pat her Panchali and Aparajito, or The Un
vaiujuished — which describes the parallel
triumphs of education and love in the life of
a poor village priest's son. Order rises from
( h.ios in the final shot; this is Ray's Oresteia.)

The heritage of Renoir and De Sica is evi
dent in Ray's wide open style, in his treat
ment of character, in the economy of his
means and in the eloquence with which he
delineates emotion. Ray worked on Tho
River, the one picture Renoir shot in India,
and the scenes on the holy Ganga River in
\/),i r.ijitn, as well as the glimpses in Rahin
dr.m.ith fayore of the river in rural Bengal
where Tagore lived on a boat for a time, stem
directly from Renoir. The intimate connec
tion between man and nature, wh.ch Renoir
had explored much earlier than Tho Rivor, in

4 Day in the Country and Rules of the Came,
shows up again and again in Ray's films. Most
dramatically, in both Pat her Panchali and the
"Postmaster" episode of Three Daughters,
nature reflects the inner turmoil of hyman
beings: storms reign outside the hut< of the
si< k and feverish.
In l)e Sica's IJmberto I), a destitute old
man, too proud to beg himself, hides behind
a statue while his dog holds an upturned hat
between its teeth. To De Sica, to Renoir, to
Satvajit Rav, human beings retain some
shred of dignity even in the face of over
powering distress. The mother in Father Pan
chali cannot accept the coin her neighbor
offers her, even though she has no money
for food for her children; the old father in
The liig City is shamed bv the offer of a
former student, now an optometrist, of a
free pair of glasses; the doctor in Distant

Thunder won't permit his wife to buy rice in
.1 "low caste" house in the midst of a famine.
Another director might accentuate the
foolishness of these characters' pride, but for
Rav foolishness is nearly always charming
and often touching — like the wedding night
scenes in "Sampati" (the third episode in
Three Daughters) and The World of Apu —
.ind human*, failings are never ridiculous.
There are so few villains in these films — ex
cept for the children's stories (The Adven
tures of (loopy and B.igha, The Golden Fort,
The Fleph.mt do d. The Kingdom of

Diamonds) — that when we encounter one,
like the disfigured rapist in Distant Thunder,
we don't know how to read him: he throws
us right out of the world of the movie. Gen
erally speaking, even the most reprehensible
< harac ters, if their faults are not exonerated
by the depth of the examination through
which they are put, have at least a fatuous ap
peal the phony miracle worker in The Cow
.irdand the I loly \l,m, with the face of an ov
erfed, super-annuated baby, laughs with im
mense self-satisfaction after each gimmick
he carries off.
A considerable part of Rav's success in
c rearing such sympathetic characters results
from his sensitivity to actors, and his canny
use of the best ones — astonishingly delicate
Sharmila Tagore, Karuna Banerjee, who has
the substance to plav Creek tragedy, Anil

Chatterjee, the verv image of the distraught
intollortu.il who cannot measure up to the
standards he l would like to set for himself,
hilarious Robi Ghosh, and of course
Soumitra Chatterjee, whom Pauline Kael has
called Rav's one-man stock company. Chat
terjee made his first appearance for Rav as
the grown-up Apu in the last part of the
trilogy, giving one of the most painfully ac
< urate depictions on film of the destructive
process of grief: when he learns of his wife's
death, he strikes the messenger — an act
with roots in ancient times — and shuts
himself up in his room, refusing to be com
forted, denying the love due his new child.
Surely this frightening exploration of the
darkest corners of a man's soul would have
suffit cm) to exhibit Chatterjee's subtlety and
control, even if we hadn't had a gallery of
portraits from him: the renegade son in
Devi, the bashful bridegroom in "Sampati,"
the cabbie in Tho Fxpedition, the literary
scholar in Charulata, the young man re
discovering an old lover in The Coward and
the llolv Mm, the arrogant executive in
and Slights in lite Forest, the village
doctor in Distant Thunder.
Distant Thunder, about the man-made
famine of 1942-43, is Rav's most overtly polit
ic al movie — except maybe for the fairy tale
cry for freedom, The Kingdom of Diamonds
—- but all of his pictures observe the progress
of Indian society. If Rav can be said to have
embraced one theme throughout his career,
it is tho gap between the old India of his pa
rents' generation and the new, Westernized
India. Apu's father is a holy man, and as a
child he learns to perform the rituals, but he
longs to be educated — and education leads
him so far from his ancestors that he feels al
ienated when, asa university student, ho wit
nesses the same ritual in which he formerly
took part. (In Aparajito, there's a moment
reminiscent of Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man: Apu, carrying an idol for a re
ligious service, hears children playing and is
drawn to their shouts. We know that life in its
infinite variety will seduce him away from
the ascetic future the priests have mapped
out for him.) Ironically, it is Apu's entrap
ment in an antique custom that brings him
the greatest joy and pain, that really carries

him into the mainstream of life: when the
<ousin of a friend must withdraw from an ar
ranged marriage because the groom turns
out to be mad, Apu is persuaded to sub
stitute so that the family may circumvent dis
grace
As Rav's films come closer and closer to a
contemporary view of his country, the
division between these two worlds is
brought into sharper and sharper focus. Her
in-laws cannot comprehend the motives of a
young woman (Madhabi Vtukherjee) who
takes a job to help support her family in The
liiij Cjtv (1963); eight years later, in Company
l imited (sometimes called The Target), the
parents of a young businessman (Barun
C'handa) whose friends chat about golf and
Rolls Rovces, visit him in the middle of a din
ner party, causing him acute embarrassment.

\nglicization — the monotonous professor
in Aparajito lecturing on synecdoche, the
Britishisms with which the four vacationers
in I).ivs ,uul Nights in the Forest pepper their
speech — has been supplanted bv American
ization. And vet the old hierarchy hangs on:
the servants in Days and Nights are abused;
