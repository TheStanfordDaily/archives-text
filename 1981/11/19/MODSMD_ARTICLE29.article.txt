JoAnne Brackeen
The Gold Rush, San lose
16 November 1981
Put simply, JoAnne Brackeen
ranks among the premier jazz
pianists in the world. She has
shown a remarkable ability to
synthesize the stylistic ad
vances in jazz piano of the '60s
and 70s, while stamping the
music with her own identity.
On Monday night, Brackeen
entranced a small but en
thusiastic audience at San
Jose's The Gold Rush with a
challenging mix of standards
and original compositions.
One could almost chart a ge
nealogy which traced the ori
gins of Brackeen's style; her
compositions are reminiscent
of the material Chick Corea
presented on early albums
such as Now He Sings. Now He
Sobs and Tones for Joan's
Rones, while her improvising is
definitely in the modal vein
popularized by McCoy Tyner.
Less pronounced but equally
present are strains of Herbie
Hancock, Bill Evans, and even
Errol Garner.
Because of this thorough as
similation of the jazz tradition,
manv claim that Brackeen has
nostvleof her own; ratherthan
being an innovator, it is argued,
her playing is simply a rehash of
what has been done already.
But those who have followed
Brackeen's career since her
early work with Art Blakey and
Stan Getz have seen her make
definite progress towards de
veloping her own voice. Now,
at the age of 41, Brackeen
seems on the verge of emer
ging as a significant figure on
the jazz scene.
It is the amazing rhythmic in
tricacy of her playing that sets

Brackeen apart from her con
temporaries; even when
plaving without a drummer, as
on her duet album New True Il
lusion, Brackeen's ability to
sustain a frantic rhythmic in
tensity is striking. One expects
the performance to fall apart at
any moment, but just when the
downbeat appears to disap
pear in a maze of syncopation,
the bassist and pianist click to
gether in a tight unison pas
sage.
Brackeen clearly demon
strated her rhythmic virtuosity
on her composition "Special
Identity," which closed her
first set on Monday night. The
piece is ostensibly in 6/8. but
Brackeen lost little time in tear
ing the rhythm into itsconstitu
cnt parts. While the bassist
maintained a solid 6/8,
Brackeen employed a different
harmonic rhythm in which bars
of 4 7 4 alternated with bars of
2/4. As if this were not complex
enough, she inserted two
measures of 3/4 after every
three groups of the previous
pattern. If this sounds complex
in print, it was dazzling in prac
tice, and it is to the credit of
bassist Ratso Harris (who sub
bed for originally scheduled
Clint Houston) that he wasable
to follow Brackeen through
this rhythmic labyrinth.
In addition to Harris,
Brackeen was joined by drum
mer Billy Higgins, who long
ago established his well-de
served reputation as one of the
finest drummers to grace the
California jazz scene. Higgins
seemed at ease with Brackeen's
complex compositions; yet
that should be no surprise, for
Higgins was Stan Getz's drum
mer during the same period
that Brackeen played in the
group, and he has played and
recorded with Brackeen a

number of times during the
past several vears.
As one might imagine,
Brackeen's playing has a ten
ilencv to sound overly busy.
Sho displays an almost un
precedented dislike of slow
tempos — on the one piece in
the sot that might be called a
ballad (her own "Evening in
Concert") Brackeen im
mediately doubled the tempo
as soon as the solos started.
Even on a fast piece such as
"Friday the Thirteenth," she in
cluded double time choruses
in which the tempo must have
exceeded a metronome mark
ing of 300.
Vet it is perhaps the very fact
that it is unrelenting, that
makes the intensity of her
playing so striking. Brackeen,
like Cecil Taylor or McCoy
Tvner, makes one wonder
whether her style won't
mellow bv necessity by the
time she reaches the age of 55
or 60.

Yet if Brackeen displayed the
strengths of her playing, she
it Iso provided an opportunity
of displaying the poor support
jazz finds in the area. A crowd
of at most 50 people attended
the opening set, perhaps sig
nalling again the sad fact that
mainstream jazz has found lit
tle support in the South Bav.
Six years ago the New Varsity
in Palo Alto experimented with
a jazz format; they booked Bill
Evans, a man who probably
ranks as the most important pi
anist of the last 25 vears, and
less than two dozen people
showed up. ASSU Special
Events, before its recent de
mise, also experienced re
peated losses in the jazz field
with artists that would have
packed concert halls in
Berkeley. Similar results have
attended attempts to promote
jazz at the Keystone Palo Alto.
Time will tell whether the same
scenario will be reenacted at
San Jose's The Gold Rush.

JoAnne Brackeen
JoAnne Brackeen
The Gold Rush, San lose
16 November 1981
Put simply, JoAnne Brackeen
ranks among the premier jazz
pianists in the world. She has
shown a remarkable ability to
synthesize the stylistic ad
vances in jazz piano of the '60s
and 70s, while stamping the
music with her own identity.
On Monday night, Brackeen
entranced a small but en
thusiastic audience at San
Jose's The Gold Rush with a
challenging mix of standards
and original compositions.
One could almost chart a ge
nealogy which traced the ori
gins of Brackeen's style; her
compositions are reminiscent
of the material Chick Corea
presented on early albums
such as Now He Sings. Now He
Sobs and Tones for Joan's
Rones, while her improvising is
definitely in the modal vein
popularized by McCoy Tyner.
Less pronounced but equally
present are strains of Herbie
Hancock, Bill Evans, and even
Errol Garner.
Because of this thorough as
similation of the jazz tradition,
manv claim that Brackeen has
nostvleof her own; ratherthan
being an innovator, it is argued,
her playing is simply a rehash of
what has been done already.
But those who have followed
Brackeen's career since her
early work with Art Blakey and
Stan Getz have seen her make
definite progress towards de
veloping her own voice. Now,
at the age of 41, Brackeen
seems on the verge of emer
ging as a significant figure on
the jazz scene.
It is the amazing rhythmic in
tricacy of her playing that sets

Brackeen apart from her con
temporaries; even when
plaving without a drummer, as
on her duet album New True Il
lusion, Brackeen's ability to
sustain a frantic rhythmic in
tensity is striking. One expects
the performance to fall apart at
any moment, but just when the
downbeat appears to disap
pear in a maze of syncopation,
the bassist and pianist click to
gether in a tight unison pas
sage.
Brackeen clearly demon
strated her rhythmic virtuosity
on her composition "Special
Identity," which closed her
first set on Monday night. The
piece is ostensibly in 6/8. but
Brackeen lost little time in tear
ing the rhythm into itsconstitu
cnt parts. While the bassist
maintained a solid 6/8,
Brackeen employed a different
harmonic rhythm in which bars
of 4 7 4 alternated with bars of
2/4. As if this were not complex
enough, she inserted two
measures of 3/4 after every
three groups of the previous
pattern. If this sounds complex
in print, it was dazzling in prac
tice, and it is to the credit of
bassist Ratso Harris (who sub
bed for originally scheduled
Clint Houston) that he wasable
to follow Brackeen through
this rhythmic labyrinth.
In addition to Harris,
Brackeen was joined by drum
mer Billy Higgins, who long
ago established his well-de
served reputation as one of the
finest drummers to grace the
California jazz scene. Higgins
seemed at ease with Brackeen's
complex compositions; yet
that should be no surprise, for
Higgins was Stan Getz's drum
mer during the same period
that Brackeen played in the
group, and he has played and
recorded with Brackeen a

number of times during the
past several vears.
As one might imagine,
Brackeen's playing has a ten
ilencv to sound overly busy.
Sho displays an almost un
precedented dislike of slow
tempos — on the one piece in
the sot that might be called a
ballad (her own "Evening in
Concert") Brackeen im
mediately doubled the tempo
as soon as the solos started.
Even on a fast piece such as
"Friday the Thirteenth," she in
cluded double time choruses
in which the tempo must have
exceeded a metronome mark
ing of 300.
Vet it is perhaps the very fact
that it is unrelenting, that
makes the intensity of her
playing so striking. Brackeen,
like Cecil Taylor or McCoy
Tvner, makes one wonder
whether her style won't
mellow bv necessity by the
time she reaches the age of 55
or 60.

Yet if Brackeen displayed the
strengths of her playing, she
it Iso provided an opportunity
of displaying the poor support
jazz finds in the area. A crowd
of at most 50 people attended
the opening set, perhaps sig
nalling again the sad fact that
mainstream jazz has found lit
tle support in the South Bav.
Six years ago the New Varsity
in Palo Alto experimented with
a jazz format; they booked Bill
Evans, a man who probably
ranks as the most important pi
anist of the last 25 vears, and
less than two dozen people
showed up. ASSU Special
Events, before its recent de
mise, also experienced re
