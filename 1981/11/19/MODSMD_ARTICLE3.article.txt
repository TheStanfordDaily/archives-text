# Police find assault call record
## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
Stanford police have now found
records of a Nov. 12 call to the police
bv a Stanford Hospital employee, re
porting an assault on her that day,
and of a Stanford police officer's sub
sequent visit to her home.
But police do not think that the
early-morning assault on the em
ployee is related to the two rapes and
four assaults here since late Septem
ber, Chief Marvin Herrington said
yesterday. Herrington told the Daily
yesterday he thought the man who
accosted her was probably "just be
ingplayful." Police are seeking the
same assailant in all six cases.
"It took us a while to dig back
through the reports," and find the of
ficer's record of his interview with
the employee, Herrington told the
Daily yesterday.
"We looked through the daily of
ficer reports over a two-day period,"
he said, "(and) we went back to the
radio dispatcher."

The officer filed his report as a
"suspicious circumstance," Her
rington said yesterday, and did not
notify Capt. Raoul Niemeyer, the of
ficer in charge of the investigation of
the recent campus attacks, because
the assault "didn't seem to fit the
(other) cases." Also, Herrington said
the woman's description of the man
who grabbed her around the waist as
she cvcled between Palm and Cam
pus Drives was not close enough to
the description of the man believed
to be the "campus rapist" to warrant
the incident's inclusion in the in
vestigation.
Although the hospital employee
described her assailant as a black
adult male, of muscular build and
with a short afro-style haircut, she
told police that she thought he was 6
feet to 6 feet 2 inches tall, while the
"campus rapist" is believed to be just
S feet 10 inches tall.
"It's too far off," Herrington said.
"She's 5 foot .3 inches and weiehs 11D

lbs. ,)nd he's 6 fpet whatever and
weighs 230. If he had wanted to pull
her off her bicycle he could have.
Not that ho should have done it, but I
think he was just being playful."
But the "campus rapist," Her
rington said, appears not to hesitate
to follow through on an attack if he
can. "Once he's convinced he's got
the victim in a location where he can
carrv it (the rape) out, he does it."
"She said she thought he looked
like a football player," Herrington
said. "We're going to . . . talk to the
football coaches."
Herrington also confirmed that the
attempted rape of a freshman here
on Sept 24 "fits the general descrip
tion of the guv we're looking for" in
connection with the other assaults,
fhe woman was attacked as she
walked between the Old Union and
Tresidder at about 8:30 p.m. while an
Orientation dance was in progress on
the Tresidder patio.
