# Oingo Boingo not as silly as it'sounds
## 
### David Breiner Oingo Boingo 
The Keystone Palo Alto
13 November 1981
With a name like Oingo Boingo,
vou don't know what to expect. But
last Friday night at the Keystone Palo
Alto, they put on a good, tight show
that, fortunately, fell just short of the
silliness their name implies.
On this particular Friday night,
however, the Keystone decided they
were going to put the audience to
work. That is, they decided to head
line a band known as Western Front,
just to see who was serious (crazy)
enough to stick it out through their
performance in order to see Oingo
Boingo. It is inconceivable that the

Keystone management listened to
this band before signing them up,
for Western Front looked and
sounded like thev were shell
shocked.
I>lli on to bigger and better things,
uamelv the next band, Chrome
Dinette. This three-piece band was
unpretentious to the point of being
downright casual, as they demon
strated bv helping the mixers adjust
their equipment before and during
the show. Nevertheless, they were
verv good. They kicked off with "The
Prisoner," a dedication to the I.R.A.
hunger strikers, which was probably
their best song. Additional high
lights included a synthesized violin
solo, sounding much like a heavily
distorted guitar, and a Rick James-in

spired, funkv bass solo.
Finally, as the Kevstone's clock
rounded the 12:45 mark, Oingo Bo
ingo ran onstage. At first glance, it
seemed as if Oingo Boingo might be
too funny to take; their trombone
player looked like a physics pro
fessor in his sixties, the keyboardist
was dressed like an airforce pilot,
complete with headset, and the lead
singer, with his bulgy budeyes,
looked more like insect than man.
But fortunately, once the music
started, we were reassured that
Oingo Boingo was, in fact, very
good. Their horn section, complete
with trombone, trumpet, and sax,
gave them a big deep sound border
ing on big band. Mso memorable
was the lead singer, who could make

his voice sound as if he were swal
lowing half of what he sans and spit
ting out the rest.
Oingo Boingo played a good share
of their somewhat limited reper
toire, which includes their only LP
(Onlv a I.>ul) and one FP. It seemed as
it thev might have lengthened their
songs a bit to stretch what they had
into an hour show, hut even if this
was the case, it certainly took noth
ing away from their performance.
In summary, Oingo Boingo was
good; that's plain and simple. My
onlv question is whether it was
worth spending three and a half
hours sipping on my 7-llp while
waiting for the head liners to appear.
Mv advice to Kevstone concert
goers â€” go late or don't go at all.
