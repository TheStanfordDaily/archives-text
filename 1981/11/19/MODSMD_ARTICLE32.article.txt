Soviets call speech 'propoganda'
The Soviet Union last night dismissed President
Ronald Reagan's proposal on reducing nuclear forces
in Europe as a "propaganda ploy designed to
stalemate" the forthcoming Geneva talks on medi
um-range missiles.
In a quick rejoinder to Reagan's address earlier yes
terday, the official news agency Tass described as
"absolutely fantastic" his figures on the East-West mil
itary balance in Europe. •
Tass also made clear that no positive results could
be expected from Geneva as long as the United States
insists on exclusion from the talks of its forward-based
systems and the British and French nuclear forces.
But the tone of Soviet comments was cautious, ap
parently reflecting Soviet intentions to cast doubts on
what is seen here as a U.S. attempt to rally wavering
West Europeans behind Reagan's defense policies.
In Western Europe, officials yesterday warmly wel
comed Reagan's proposals for nuclear arms reduc
tions as a fulfillment of European wishes and a solid
confirmation of the president's interest in arms con
trol.
But leaders of the European protest against the sta
tioning of new U.S. nuclear missiles in Western Eu
rope gave a mixed reaction to the president's speech,
with some tending to discount its importance and re
maining suspicious of U.S. negotiating intentions.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and Brit
ish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, meeting in
Bonn for bilateral consultations and each facing grow
ing domestic opposition to alliance nuclear weapon
modernization plans, used a joint press conference to
applaud the content and tone of Reagan's speech —
particularly his offer to cancel the new U.S. missile
deployment if the Soviet Union dismantles its new
SS-20s and older SS-4s and SS-ss.
Senate GOP leaders head off veto
Washington — The White House and Senate Re
publican leaders agreed yesterday on a strategy for
heading off a presidential veto of the catch-all spend
ing bill that Congress must adopt by the weekend to
keep the government from running out of money.
But a Senate leadership source insisted "We're not
out of the woods yet," and House Speaker "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) asserted that President Ronald Rea
gan really wants to veto the measure "to get a head
line" and to win a "personal victory."
Moreover, Senate leaders were still scrambling last
night to put together a bill that would be acceptable
to both Reagan and a majority of the Senate, and it
was not clear whether the end result will satisfy the
president
After a day of crosstown negotiations by telephone
with White House officials, Senate Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) agreed to push for a cut of
about $3.6 billion from the so-called "continuing res
olution" in exchange for administration acceptance
of a Sept. 30, 1982, termination date for the measure.

A number of senators want the resolution to run
through Sept. 30, the end of this fiscal year, to avoid
fights over further stopgap legislation.
Although Reagan had wanted a March 30 expira
tion date, the date never appeared to be a major issue
for the White House, and the Senate rejected the
March date yesterday by a vote of 51-46.
The initial agreement had been for a 5 percent cut,
but Senate staff members last night prepared a ten
tative draft that would impose a cut of only 3.5 per
cent. Sources said the goal was still to achieve cuts of
about $3.6 billion, possibly by including some areas of
spending, such as defense, that had not been in
cluded in the 5 percent proposal. Negotiations were
continuing last night and a final decision was not ex
pected until a Republican caucus this morning.
House passes secret CIA funding
Washington — The House passed overwhelmingly
yesterday a bill authorizing a secret amount of money
for the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies.
By a vote of 379 to 22, the House approved the fiscal
1982 measure, which now goes to the Senate for final
congressional action.
Nearly all the specific money figures in the bill were
classified. However, Rep. Edward Boland (D-Mass.)
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,
noted that the legislation includes $11.9 million for
FBI efforts to combat terrorism in the United States.
Rep. J. Kenneth Robinson (R-Va.) the committee's
ranking GOP member, said the bill "provides for real
growth in the intelligence programs over last year's
levels."
Robinson added: "I am particularly pleased that
this bill provides for acquisition of a new classified
technical collection capability which I believe will be
of great benefit to our country."
He did not disclose any details on the new in
telligence-gathering system.
Diablo might lose NRC license
Washington — The nuclear power industry faced a
new challenge yesterday as the government con
sidered yanking the license of a California power
plant yet to open because of myriad technical prob
lems.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was holding a
closed meeting on the Diablo Canyon plant amid re
ports it had tentatively decided at a closed session
Monday to suspend the troubled facility's license un
til an independent study confirmed completion of
new work.
NRC spokesman Joseph Fouchardsaid commission
rules would allow suspension of the license at the
closed session He would not discuss the commission
action Monday or speculate on yesterday's meeting,
however.
An independent review of problems at the $2.3
billion plant recently had been sought by California
Gov. Edmund Brown, who opposes the facility. NRC

Chairman Nunzio Palladino said at a commission
meeting last week that Brown's viewpoint should be
weighed.
Suspension of the Diablo Canyon license would be
the tirst such NRC action for any atomic power plant,
according to john Kopeck, another commission
spokesman.
It would come at a time when the Reagan adminis
tration is seeking to bolster a nuclear-power industry
besieged by questions about the safety of atomic re
actors, waning electric demand and rising interest
rates that make nuclear plants increasingly expensive.
Diablo Canyon has been one of the nation's most
controversial nuclear facilities since a nearby earth
quake fault was discovered during construction.
This fall, it was discovered that design work done in
1977 to shore up the plant against possible earthquake
damage was in error because the wrong figures had
been given a seismic consultant. As a result, pipe sup
ports were placed opposite where they should have
been.
Loading of nuclear fuel was suspended, and further
investigation revealed several other problems at the
facility.
Interest deregulation criticized
Washington — The head of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board urged Congress yesterday to restructure
the federal agency created last year to oversee a six
year phase out of government ceilings on interest
rates paid by banks, savings and loan associations and
credit unions.
Richard Pratt, chairman of the board that supervises
the nation's 4,000 federally insured savings and loan
associations, said that the deregulatory agency's cur
rent makeup and voting provisions unfairly diluted
the voice of the thrift industry.
At the hearing by a House Banking subcommittee,
Pratt reiterated his support for a ceiling on the interest
rates that banks and savings and loans can offer for In
dividual Retirement Accounts.
Such a ceiling, he said, would prevent "predatory
pricing" by financial institutionseagertoslice intothe
expanded market for the retirement accounts when
liberalized eligibility rules take effect in January.
Pratt was among a string of witnesses, dominated by
spokesmen for the savings and loan and banking in
dustries, who appeared before the Subcommittee on
General Oversight and Renegotiation.
The hearing wascalled in response to complaints by
the savings and loan industry that the Depository In
stitutions Deregulation Committee — the agency
created by Congress in 1980 to supervise the phasing
out of government ceilings on interest rates paid to
savers — was unfair to thrift institutions.
In its efforts to deregulate interest rates, the savings
and loan industry charges, the deregulation agency
has acted too hastily and is forcing thrift institutions to
compete against banks and credit unions at a time
when they can ill afford it.
The chief problem for savings and loans is that, un

like banks and credit unions, a substantial part of their
assets are tied up in old long-term, fixed-rate mort
gages returning interest payments well below their
current cost of funds.
New questions surround Allen
Washington — New discrepancies arose yesterday
in the story of how President Ronald Reagan's na
tional security adviser came to receive $1,000 in cash
from a lapanese woman's magazine that interviewed
Mrs. Reagan.
But Reagan, after first saying he was in no position
to comment while the matter was under review, told
reporters the incident "was investigated, and it was
reported that everything was fine."
It was not clear what the president meant, since a
Justice Department investigation still is under way —
as Reagan himself first indicated — and White House
spokesmen have said repeatedly there has been no
internal probe of the matter involving national secur
ity adviser Richard Allen.
Meanwhile, it was disclosed yesterday by a Tokyo
newspaper and confirmed by the White House that
the magazine journalists who interviewed Mrs. Rea
gan one day after her husband's inauguration had giv
en her a lacquered stationery box.
That gift was handled according to usual practice
and is now in storage at the National Archives, deputy
White House press secretary Larry Speakes said. He
said a private gallery that specializes in Asian art had
estimated its value at $75.
But Speakes could not explain why, if the box was
presented to Mrs. Reagan, there would also be an en
velope containing $1,000 in cash intended for her.
A spokeswoman for the National Archives, Jill Mer
rill, said that her agency provides storage for such un
official gifts but considers them the personal property
of the first family, unlike official gifts from foreign
leaders, which become the property of the govern
ment.
Market sinks to bad news
New York — Blue-chip and glamor issues retreated
yesterday as the stock market absorbed more bad ec
onomic news.
In their apparent preoccupation with the worsen
ing recession, stock traders showed little response to
further declines in interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down
more than 10 points on Monday and up 5 Tuesday, fell
back 6.09 to 844.08.
The daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange
showed losers and gainers about evenly balanced. But
the Big Board's composite index dropped 36 to 70.03.
Today's weather
Fair through today except for fog this morning
burning off by midday. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph in
the afternoon. Highs in the 60s, lows in the 40s to low
50s.
