Students United for Rape Elimina
tion (SURF) has decided not to accept
money from the sale of the Phi Delta
fheta "Women of Stanford" calen
dar on the grounds that such action
might have an adverse effect on
SIJRF's reputation
The fraternity, which had stated
previously that SURE would accept
monev, is going ahead with produc
tion of the calendar as planned, ac
cording to Phil Gyori, one of the Phi
Delts in charge.
Gvori said thr> proceeds would re
main "on campus," but he declined
to sav exactly where. "We have three
places in mind," he said. "If we bare
ly cover costs, the money will only go

to one place." He mentioned "chari
ties" and "memorials" as possible re
cipients.
The calendar, which is designed to
include pictures of Stanford under
graduate women taken at various
spots around campus, has sparked
opposition from feminist groups
here.
SURE student director Andy
Cargile said he thought it would not
be a "suitable" idea for SURE to be
associated with the calendar.
"Just in terms of the actual project
and the selection process, I didn't
feel that it was suitable for SURE to
accept the money," said Cargill. "I
just didn't want SURE's name to be

used to sell the calendar. I didn't
think it was wise for the reputation of
SURF."
Added Cargile, "There weren't any
hard feelings. I respect them for let
ting me decline the offer and they re
spected me for declining."
Gvori said the calendar is now at
the printers, and should be on sale
soon. He said he does not yet know
where it will be sold.
All the women invited to be in the
calendar accepted the offer, Gvori
said. The selection committee was
composed of four undergraduate
men, two undergraduate women
and one male graduate student, he
said.
