Recent concern regarding possible
bacterid and parasite infestations of
water in this area is probably un
founded, according to the latest
available evidence.
News groups have reported that
203 cases of g/ard/a reactions in the
San Francisco area were the result of
increased levels of the parasite in wa
ter in the area, which originates in
the Hetch-Hetchy water system in
Calaveras County. Hetch-Hetchv is
owned and operated bv the San Fran
cisco Water Department (SFWD).
Yet officials from the Health and
Water departments claim that 90 per
cent of these cases were the result of
anal-oral sexual contact, and not
from the water supply. The few other
reported cases of giardia symptoms

have been children who mav have
come in contact with the parasite in
other wavs, such as at day care cen

DiCaprio of the Santa Clara County
Health Department.
Ciardia is a parasite which lodges
itself in the intestines, causing diar
rhea and possibly fever. It can be car

Stanford contracts independently
with the SFWD for all its water. Ac
cording to Gerald Ostrander of Facil
ities and Services, Stanford is part of a
larger group of cities, the Bay Area
Water Users \ssociation, hut this
coalition "is only so that the smaller
communities will have a viable
mechanism for dealing with the
SFWD."
According to the secretary to Hal
Wilson, director of risk management

.it the office of health and safety here,
water is monitored here monthly and
there hasn't been any increase in
bacteria levels
"There hasn't been any increase in
cases within the Santa Clara county,"
said DiCaprio.
Or. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Student Health Services, also
said lhal while his office has been
aware of the reports, there hasn't
been anv abnormal incidence of
iliardia cases.
â– \ccording to Harry Tracy of the
SFVVf), however, the levels of giardia
within the water are difficult to de
tect.
"I irst of all, it's like finding a nee
dle in ,i haystack, since thegiardia are
hidden bv everything else in the wa
