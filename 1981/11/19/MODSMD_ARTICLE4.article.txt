# Water contamination fears allayed

### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Recent concern regarding possible
bacterid and parasite infestations of
water in this area is probably un
founded, according to the latest
available evidence.
News groups have reported that
203 cases of g/ard/a reactions in the
San Francisco area were the result of
increased levels of the parasite in wa
ter in the area, which originates in
the Hetch-Hetchy water system in
Calaveras County. Hetch-Hetchv is
owned and operated bv the San Fran
cisco Water Department (SFWD).
Yet officials from the Health and
Water departments claim that 90 per
cent of these cases were the result of
anal-oral sexual contact, and not
from the water supply. The few other
reported cases of giardia symptoms

have been children who mav have
come in contact with the parasite in
other wavs, such as at day care cen
ters, according to Dr. Joseph
DiCaprio of the Santa Clara County
Health Department.
Ciardia is a parasite which lodges
itself in the intestines, causing diar
rhea and possibly fever. It can be car
ried in water.
Stanford contracts independently
with the SFWD for all its water. Ac
cording to Gerald Ostrander of Facil
ities and Services, Stanford is part of a
larger group of cities, the Bay Area
Water Users \ssociation, hut this
coalition "is only so that the smaller
communities will have a viable
mechanism for dealing with the
SFWD."
According to the secretary to Hal
Wilson, director of risk management

.it the office of health and safety here,
water is monitored here monthly and
there hasn't been any increase in
bacteria levels
"There hasn't been any increase in
cases within the Santa Clara county,"
said DiCaprio.
Or. James McClenahan, director of
Cowell Student Health Services, also
said lhal while his office has been
aware of the reports, there hasn't
been anv abnormal incidence of
iliardia cases.
â– \ccording to Harry Tracy of the
SFVVf), however, the levels of giardia
within the water are difficult to de
tect.
"I irst of all, it's like finding a nee
dle in ,i haystack, since thegiardia are
hidden bv everything else in the wa
ter," he said. "Also, monitoring for
viruses and the like can only be done
in ,i high tech laboratory. It's difficult
lo analyze on a routine basis. There is
a definite need for more research in
this area."
"We've been worrying about the
giardia for several years, ever since
there was an outbreak in Leningrad,"
Tracvsaid. He said that one mountain
community in California, Gray Eagle,
did have an outbreak that was traced
to the water. "But even then, no test
that the community did on the water
could detect the giardia. The water
had to be sent out to a special lab."
But Tracy said that as far as he
knew, there was no giardia in the wa
ter which is supplied to this area.
"We're treating the water with
lime, which has a high pH, which
makes the killing of such parasites as

giardia difficult," said Tracy. "I
thought we wouldn't be able to con
trol it with chlorine." But now, Tracy
said, he has received new informa
tion which would indicate that the
levels of chlorine used by the SFVVD
are sufficient to control giardia.
SFVVD uses very high levels of
chlorine, at almost 1.5 parts per mil
lion. Other cities use an average of .1
parts per million, Tracy said.
"You can't get much higher than
the current levels, or people start to
complain that the byproducts of the
chlorine cause cancer," Tracy said.
DiCaprio said that individuals may
come in contact with giardia by
drinking water from the creeks in thi<
area. "That water isn't treated, and
there's no way to assure that such
bacteria and parasites are absent
from the water," he said.
