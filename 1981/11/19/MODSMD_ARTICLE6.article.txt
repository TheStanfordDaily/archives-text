# College Terrace suspect pleads 'no contest
## 
### 
Melvin Carter, the man police sus
pect to be the "Lollege Terrace
rapist" who terrorized 11 women liv
ing just south of campus between
1971 and 1979, pleaded "no contest"
this week in Santa Clara Countv Su
perior Court to three counts of rape,
one count of attempted rape and
four counts of burglary with intent to
commit rape.
Monday afternoon Carter, 36, and
his attorney Tom Nolan met with
Judge John Kennedy and Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Al Bender in a pre
liminary hearing in the judge's cham
bers. Following that meeting, he en
tered his plea, one which Bender said
had "no legal difference from a guilty
plea."
The former Pleasanton engineer
who has been held on $350,000 bail
since his arrest in September, 1980,
faces a maximum prison sentence of
20 years for the crimes. He will be
sentenced Dec. 21.
There had been some speculation
th.it Carter had made some kind of
deal in order to persuade prose
cutors in Alameda Countv — where
he faces nine counts of rape and 15
related felonies — to him a more
lenient sentence. He also has been
charged with one count of rape in
Davis.
\ccording to Bender, no deals
were made by his office.
Although Bender would not
speculate as to why Carter pleaded
"no contest" instead of guilty — in
fact lie objected to that plea but the
judge allowed it — it is believed to be
related to a suit being brought by one
of the women who was raped. The
woman has brought suit against
Carter for $200,000 in damages. A no
contest plea cannot be used as an ad
mission of guilt in civil cases while the
yuiltv plea can.
