# Anti-nuclear arms movement in Europe gains wide support
## 
### Washington Post 
Wildenrath, West Germany — A military
truck, passing through this \ illage late one night
a year ago, rounded a curve too quickly and
rolled its cargo — a U.S. Pershing rocket minus
its nuclear warhead — into a neat front-yard
flower bed.
The mishap was taken in stride bv the people
here who, surrounded bv a cluster of American,
British and West German military installations,
had come through three decades of the Cold
War, Peaceful Coexistence and finally Detente
to tolerate such minor aggravations in the name
of Western security and N ATO.
But today, something has changed. Wild
enrath, and manv other towns like it here in the
crowded heartland of Western Europe, are less
inclined to accept nuclear weapons as neigh
bors. Thev are questioning the ambiguous and
disjointed strategies that have grown up around
the weapons on their soil but are beyond their
control.
Several times in recent months there have
been street demonstrations in the area as some
citizens of this small town in Germany have sup
ported the more publicized hundreds of
thousands who have paraded in London, Bonn,
Paris, Amsterdam and other European capitals to
call for a moratorium on nuclear weapons
deployment bv the United States and Soviet
I Uiion in Europe.
As the European anti-nuclear movement has
gathered strength and definition, it has begun to
show a tendency to go beyond a simple rejec
tion of the 108 new U.S. Pershing 2 and 464
Tomahawk cruise missiles earmarked for Eu
rope, to attacks on America's overall security
policv and in some cases to a renunciation of the
West's whole "defense" concept. Alternatives
offered range from nuclear-free zones across
the continent to unilateral disarmament by Eu
rope.
Involved is nothing less than an awakening —
or perhaps reawakening since there had been a
similar debate in the 1950s — to bedrock matters
of peace and war, of deterrence and defense.
These European publics had not been consulted
bv, nor taken into the confidence of, their own
governments or that of the United States on the
issue of nuc'leaV weapons.
The doctrine of field nuclear weapons was
brought into sharp focus bv the NATO-wide de

cision in December 1979 to reintroduce on
Western European soil American missiles that
can hit the Soviet Union, and by the uncertain
enunciation of nuclear strategy by President
Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander
Haii> and Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger in recent weeks.
One American analyst in Europe said that the
European disarmament movement is not the
same asthe American anti-war movement. "This
movement is more like the one of the people in
I Itah and Nevada that did not want the MX mis
sile in their state." This assessment, he added,
was shared bv senior policy-makers in Bonn,
London and The Hague.
Many Europeans seem to support a withdraw
al of all 300,000 American troops from Europe
and a shift of the immediate defense burden to
Furopean shoulders, in a non-nuclear but still
NATO-allied Europe.
The anti-nuclear movement aims to "make a
calm space between the superpowers and per
mit smaller nations, East and West, to resume
their own initiatives," said British historian E. P.
Thompson, who says his Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament group is working to remove nu
(lear weapons from"the entire territory of Eu
rope, from Poland to Portugal."
Interviews with Western European political
and military leaders and with U.S. officials who
worked out the Tomahawk-Pershing program
provide evidence that the controversial missiles
will lie the latest addition to a nuclear stockpile
in Europe that was conceived for political rather
than military purposes, for which no realistic
plan of use exists, and which may have reached
the point of frightening America's allies more
than it frightens the Soviets.
Belgium and the Netherlands have particular
ly strong nuclear pacifist movement, and it is
likelv that thev will refuse cruise missiles, while
chances for refusal in Britain, Italy, and West
Germanv seem more doubtful.
National communist parties have also been ac
tive in organizing and encouraging anti-Ameri
can disarmament demonstrations. But American
officials, including Haig, have publicly said that
the most difficult challenge the alliance faces is
responding to the average European citizens
who is concerned about the nuclear threat their
region faces in the 1980s.

issue of nuc'leaV weapons.
The doctrine of field nuclear weapons was
brought into sharp focus bv the NATO-wide de

cision in December 1979 to reintroduce on
Western European soil American missiles that
can hit the Soviet Union, and by the uncertain
enunciation of nuclear strategy by President
Ronald Reagan, Secretary of State Alexander
Haii> and Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger in recent weeks.
One American analyst in Europe said that the
European disarmament movement is not the
same asthe American anti-war movement. "This
movement is more like the one of the people in
I Itah and Nevada that did not want the MX mis
sile in their state." This assessment, he added,
was shared bv senior policy-makers in Bonn,
London and The Hague.
Many Europeans seem to support a withdraw
al of all 300,000 American troops from Europe
and a shift of the immediate defense burden to
Furopean shoulders, in a non-nuclear but still
NATO-allied Europe.
The anti-nuclear movement aims to "make a
calm space between the superpowers and per
mit smaller nations, East and West, to resume
their own initiatives," said British historian E. P.
Thompson, who says his Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament group is working to remove nu
(lear weapons from"the entire territory of Eu
rope, from Poland to Portugal."
Interviews with Western European political
and military leaders and with U.S. officials who
worked out the Tomahawk-Pershing program
provide evidence that the controversial missiles
will lie the latest addition to a nuclear stockpile
in Europe that was conceived for political rather
than military purposes, for which no realistic
plan of use exists, and which may have reached
the point of frightening America's allies more
than it frightens the Soviets.
Belgium and the Netherlands have particular
ly strong nuclear pacifist movement, and it is
likelv that thev will refuse cruise missiles, while
chances for refusal in Britain, Italy, and West
Germanv seem more doubtful.
National communist parties have also been ac
tive in organizing and encouraging anti-Ameri
can disarmament demonstrations. But American
officials, including Haig, have publicly said that
the most difficult challenge the alliance faces is
responding to the average European citizens
who is concerned about the nuclear threat their
region faces in the 1980s.
Wildenrath, West Germany — A military
truck, passing through this \ illage late one night
a year ago, rounded a curve too quickly and
rolled its cargo — a U.S. Pershing rocket minus
its nuclear warhead — into a neat front-yard
flower bed.
The mishap was taken in stride bv the people
here who, surrounded bv a cluster of American,
British and West German military installations,
had come through three decades of the Cold
War, Peaceful Coexistence and finally Detente
to tolerate such minor aggravations in the name
of Western security and N ATO.
But today, something has changed. Wild
enrath, and manv other towns like it here in the
crowded heartland of Western Europe, are less
inclined to accept nuclear weapons as neigh
bors. Thev are questioning the ambiguous and
disjointed strategies that have grown up around
the weapons on their soil but are beyond their
control.
Several times in recent months there have
been street demonstrations in the area as some
citizens of this small town in Germany have sup
ported the more publicized hundreds of
thousands who have paraded in London, Bonn,
Paris, Amsterdam and other European capitals to
call for a moratorium on nuclear weapons
deployment bv the United States and Soviet
I Uiion in Europe.
As the European anti-nuclear movement has
gathered strength and definition, it has begun to
show a tendency to go beyond a simple rejec
tion of the 108 new U.S. Pershing 2 and 464
Tomahawk cruise missiles earmarked for Eu
rope, to attacks on America's overall security
policv and in some cases to a renunciation of the
West's whole "defense" concept. Alternatives
offered range from nuclear-free zones across
the continent to unilateral disarmament by Eu
rope.
Involved is nothing less than an awakening —
or perhaps reawakening since there had been a
similar debate in the 1950s — to bedrock matters
of peace and war, of deterrence and defense.
These European publics had not been consulted
bv, nor taken into the confidence of, their own
governments or that of the United States on the
issue of nuc'leaV weapons.
