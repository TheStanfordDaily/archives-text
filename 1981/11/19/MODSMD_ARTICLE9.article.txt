## Kennan blasts Reagan policy on Soviets calling for SALT, more informed outlook 
### Los Angeles Times 
Hanover, N.H. — George
Kennan, the I ,S ambassador
to the Soviet Union at the
height of the Cold War, has
charged that the Reagan ad
ministration's view of the Sovi
et Union is so far rhmoved from
reality it "is not onlv ineffective
but dangerous as a guide to po
litical action."
Kennan, in an address at
Dartmouth College, said that
government officials and manv
journalists engage in an "end
less series of distortions and ov -
ersimplifications" about the
Soviets, systematically de
humanizing Soviet leaders and
routinely exaggerating Mos
cow's military capabilities and
the iniquity of its intentions.
Such thinking, Kennan said,
misrepresents the nature and
attitude of the Russian people
and ignores their history. It fails
to recognize that the Soviet
Union and the United States
share many problems and
tends to view all aspects of the
relationship between the two
nations in the framework of ir
reconcilable conflicts.
These "childish distortions,"
Kennan charged, "are not the
m,irks of the maturity and re
alism one expects of the
diplomacy of a great power.
They are the marks of an in
tellectual primitivism and
naivete unpardonable in a
great government."
"I do not have, and have
never had, sympathy for the
ideology of the Soviet leader
ship," the Pulitzer Prize-win
ning historian and former
diplomat said. Kennan, 78,
spoke after receiving an award
from Dartmouth for dist
inguished private citizenship.
"I recognize that this is a re
gime with which it is not pos
sible for us to have a fully satis
factory relationship," Kennan
said of the Kremlin's leader
ship. "I know that there are
areas of interaction where no
collaboration between us is
possible, just as there are other
areas where one can col
laborate.
Kennan, the U.S. a m -
bassador to Moscow from May
to October, 1952, when then-
Soviet premier )osef Stalin de
manded his withdrawal, pro
posed that the United States
and the Soviet Union discuss
removing all nuclear weapons
from Central and Northern Eu
rope in scheduled arms-con
trol negotiations.
He called upon both nations
to explore a temporary freeze
on their nuclear arsenals and a
complete ban on nuclear tes
ting as further steps toward re
versing "the dreadful trend
toward a final nuclear confla
gration.
"None of this would under
mine anyone's security," he
said. "It is urgently important
that we get on with these
changes. Time is not waiting for
us. The fragile nuclear balance
that has prevailed in recent
years is being undermined."
"There are a number of Sovi
et habits and practices which I
deeply deplore, and which I

teel we should resist firmly
when thev impinge on our in
i erest s I recognize,
furthermore, that the Soviet
leadership does not a I ways act
in its own best interests — that

These 'childish distortions (present U.S.
Cold War rhetoric) are not the mark ot the
maturity and realism one expects ot the

ii is i apable of making mis
takes just as we are, and that
M'ghanistan is one of those
mist.ikes, and one which it will
come to regret, regardless of
anvthing we mav do to punish
it."
kennan warned that there

has been a "drastic and very se
rious deterioration" in Soviet
\merican relations, marked by
what he called "unhappy con
tributions" from both sides.
I le said the current discourse

about the Soviet Union has
been marked by "almost ex
clusive militarization of think
ing — a militarization which, it
seems to me, could not be dif
ferent if we knew for a fact that
we were unquestionably to be
at war within a matter of

months.
"This, in itself, is a dangerous
state of affairs, which is not
going to be easy to correct," he
continued. "I don't think I un
derestimate" the gravity of the
problem."
Kennan said the nuclear bal
ance is undermined not so
much bv the steady buildup of
atomic weapons, but by tech
nical advances that threaten to
break down the verification
capabilities of both sides. In
such a climate of uncertainty,
he cautioned, the temptation
of a "first-strike" mentality can
flourish.
"Our government will have
to recognize that there are a
great many people who would
accept the need for adequate
national defense but who
would emphatically deny that
the nuclear weapon, and par
ticularly the first use of that
weapon, is anything with
which a country could con
ceivably defend itself."
