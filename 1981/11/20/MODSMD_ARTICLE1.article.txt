Father lunipero Serra declares himself a Stanford fan
This huge football is the creation of an enterprising group of Stanford students known as 'the Newts/ who
hung their creation from the finger of the sculpture of Father Junipero Serra that points west out over the
Interstate 280 freeway. The football was handsewn by the group, and put up on the statue at about *
Friday morning. The giant football has a frame of concentric rings of metal, of varying sizes, covered with

Greg Lim/Daily
fabric, and was collapsed Hat when transported up to Father Serra's statue. Once attached to the tinker
and lifted, via pulleys, it billowed out to its present shape. The laces, which hang along the side of the
football facing the freeway, read the time-honored saying, "Beat Cal."
