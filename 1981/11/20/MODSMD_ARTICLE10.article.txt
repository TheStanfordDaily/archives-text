# Germans doubt Reagan plan's sincerity

### In The Los Angeles Times 
Bonn, West Germany —
President Ronald Reagan's call
for a ban on U.S. and Soviet in
termediate-range nuclear mis
siles in Europe appeared yes
terday to have failed to con
vince West Germany's pow
erful "peace movement" of
the president's commitment to
arms reduction.
Unlike Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt, who has e n -
thusiastically endorsed the
president's move, peace move
ment leaders viewed with
skepticism Reagan's offer to
scrap the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's plans to deploy
new missiles in Western Eu
rope in return for the dismantl
ing of Soviet intermediate
range missiles, including the
new SS-20.
"The prohibitive conditions
which the president has set can
hardly be fulfilled (by the Sovi
ets)," William Bonn, a veteran
member of the liberal Free
Democratic Party, the junior
partner in the government
coalition headed by Schmidt's
Social Democratic Party.
"I don't think this offer is a

coalition's Free Democratic Party

basis on which world powers
can negotiate with each oth
er," said Borm, who last month
was one of the speakers at a
huge anti-war rally in Bonn.
Several other persons promi
nent in the peace movement
here yesterday described the

president's call as a propagan
da plov designed to mask
American rearmament efforts
and stifle criticism of NATO's
decision in 1979 to deploy Per
shing 2 and cruise missiles to
counter the Soviet buildup of
SS-20s if the arms talks fail.
This "zero option" is ex
pected to lie Washington's
opening proposal in the arms
talks due to begin in Geneva on
Nov. 30. The talks will deal with
the Europe-based missiles
whose range is limited to the
European region.
Anti-arms sentiment
West Germany, a key NATO
allv of the United States, has
been a center of opposition to
the plan for deployment of a
modernized missile force in
Western Europe.
Manon Maren-Griesbach,
an official of the Green Party,
an ecological movement that
has been active in the peace
movement, declared that Rea
gan's proposal is unfair. She as
serted that it failed to include
French and British nuclear
weapons or so-called forward
based system — Western mis
sile-carrying warplanes based

in Europe and missile sub
marines operating off the Eu
ropean roasts.
The criticism was much the
same as that voiced by the Sovi
et media in a quick response to
the president's speech on the
subject before the National

Press Club in Washington on
Wednesday.
Administration officials have
complained that such criticism,
often voiced bv Moscow, fails
to mention the Soviet Union's
own forward-based systems,
such as its 150 backfire bomb
ers and 950 submarine
launched missiles.
Frhard Eppler, a prominent
member among left-wing re
bels in the Social Democratic
Partv opposed to the NATO
deployment decision, charged
in radio broadcasts before Rea
gan's speech that zero option
proposals by the West were not
meant to be taken seriously.
Schmidt-Brezhnev talks
However, Schmidt, who, af

tor initial skepticism, had urged
Washington to adopt the zepo
option, praised the president's
speech and said it would
strengthen his hand in his dis
cussion with Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev, whoisdueto
arrive in Bonn Sunday fora
four-day official visit.
Schmidt, in a joint statement
with visiting British Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher who
shared his views, said Reagan's
speech gave him "deep satis
faction."
The proposals also received a
generally favorable response in
the West German media. Sev
eral newspapers said the pro
posal has placed the Kremlin
on the defensive.
