Belfast, Northern Ireland
(AP) â€” Britain vowed to use the
"full force of its authority"
against the Rev. Lan Paisley's
Protestant vigilantes, and has
flown the army's 600-man
Spearhead Battalion to
Northern Ireland to bolster the
11,000 troops in the province.
Support for Paisley seemed to
be eroding.
At Crossmaglen, near the
border with the Irish Republic,
Irish Republican Army guer
rillas in a car fired submachine
guns at an army foot patrol,
critically wounding a soldier
and a Catholic farmer driving a
tractor nearby, police said.
Gunmen shot one man to
death and wounded his com
panion in the Protestant Wa
terside district of Londonderry

on Wednesday night, police
said, adding that the attackers
used a van stolen in a Catholic
area of the city. The dead man
was a former member of the
mainly Protestant Ulster De
fense Regiment, police said.
Dr. Edward Daly, the Roman
Catholic bishop of London
derry, said Catholic neighbors
of the slairf man "share the re
vulsion and anger generated
by this dreadful murder. There
is a campaign under way to
plunge the whole community
into despair."
Britain will "usethefull force
of its authority against those
who do not respect the rights
of others," Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's minister
for the province, James Prior,
said.
