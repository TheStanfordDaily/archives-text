Oh, those ridiculous
Weenies!

of the Dirty Golden Bears will

Stanford Axe as though it is
rightfully theirs.
They're so ignorant.

close a group of Stanford stu
dentsandalumni came tosteal

California officials turned the
event into the best Stanford
fish story this fall.
"A successful Stanford at
tempt to steal the Axe," said
heist organizer Mark Breier,
was marred by "a Berkeley
fumbling in trying to give it to
us."
The plot originated as Breier,
a Class of 1981 graduate,
searcher) for ideas to promote
Amazing Events Unlimited, a
good times company he as
sembled last spring together
with two Stanford classmates.
Offering a multitude of ser
vices catering to party and
event organizations, Breier's
company had performed
events ranging from an "in
credible date for two" to a
fully-catered dinner party
complete with a pair of bumbl
ing servants.
What event, Breier asked the
set of friends he called upon in
a brainstorming session several
weeks ago, could possibly be
more amazing than stealing the
Axe right out from under the
Weenies' noses?
The group responded im
mediately with a variety of
plots and scenarios which
ranged from the implausible to
the illegal to the downright
dangerous. Soon they agreed,
however, that the attempt be
governed by ground rules pro
hibiting as much violence and
criminal behavior as possible.
There were to be no casualties.
As Breier said later, "Our
abort condition was the words
'Stop or I'll shoot.' "
After several further meet
ings in which the plan was fine
ly honed and envisioned,
members of the group began
to lav the groundwork in the
University of California Sports
Information Department (SID).
Posing as a reporter from a
national sports magazine, jun
ior Doug Mitchell approached
the Berkeley athletic depart

ment with the story that he was
writing an article on Pac-Ten
sports rivalries, including the
traditional contest between
Stanford and the University of
California. His request to visit
the Berkeley campus was met
with enthusiasm from Cal of
ficials.
Mitchell called again several
days later to establish a time
and date for the interview and
photo session, coyly allowing
the official to suggest that per
haps the famous Stanford Axe,
symbol of Big Game suprem
acy, be included in the photo
graphs. Mitchell agreed that
including the Axe might be a
good idea.
Meanwhile, heist members
gathered forces and began an
intensive research project on
the credentials needed to pull
off the hoax. Locating the
name of a free-lance writer
from New York, the would-be
robbers obtained biographical
information and a set of busi
ness cards to establish credibili
ty with the Cal officials.
Eighteen characters were
selected to participate in the
theft attempt. Taking advan
tage of some of the finest men
tal and physical represent
ativesof the Stanford com
munity, the ring of theives in
cluded 14 students and four
alumni, several All-America
athletes, a couple of student
government leaders, a number
of dormitory R As, a former dol
ly and a salesman of "green
lipped mussels from New Zea
land."
Tuesday morning the staff as
sembled at the Airport Sher
idan hoteltocarryouttheplan.
Hours of practice and planning
went into action as the heist
members reviewed themselves
one last time. Five cars and two
motorcycles departed forarch
rival Berkeley.
At 10 a.m., an AP/UPI pho
tographer entered the athletic
department office at Cal. The
cameraman intoduced himself,
wondering if the free-lance
writer had arrived yet. Wel
comed by Cal officials, the
photographer was escorted to
several likely spots for the
photo session while awaiting
the arrival of the tardy journal
ist.

'Our abort
condition was the
words 4 Stop or \'\\
shoot/'
— Mark Breier,
heist organizer

Soon the office was filled
with photo session participants
as former Stanford dolly Terri
Oppelt entered, followed by a
Cal cheerleader and the jour
nalist. Each of the eighteen per
formers was in position to be
gin the plot; all that was
needed was the Axe.
In accordance to the plan,
the journalist would conduct
an interview with the Sports In
formation Director while the
photographer initiated the
photo session with the dollies
and Axe at a predetermined lo
cation.
During the session the pho
tographer would pose the
(jollies in a mock tug-of-war,
each struggling for the Axe be
tween them. Upon the signal of

the photographer, an ongoing
lovers' quarrel nearbv (carried
out bv two members of the
group) would become increas
ingly violent until the two char
acters would break out into a
noisy shouting match, hopeful
ly distracting any guards re
sponsible for the security of the
Axe.
In an instant, a six-foot five
inch jogger (portrayed by
freshman Shaun Pickering)
would rush the Axe at the same
moment the photographer had
taken hold of the Cal dolly's
side of the Axe. Making his es
cape towards the cleared back
ground area in the picture,
Pickering would bolt across a
wooded creek, emerging on a
street on the far side.
As he ran, the speedster
would pass four large men jog
ging in the opposite direction,

providing a group of seeming
ly-innocent obstacles to slow
whatever pursuit might have
gathered among the Cal peo
ple.
The Axe-bearer would hand
the trophy to the rear partner
of a waiting motorcycle team,
which would immediately
speed away from the scene.
Jumping on the back of a sec
ond waiting motorcycle, the
thief would make his getaway,
traveling in the opposite direc
tion of the first team and lend
ing to the confusion of the
chase.
The motorcycle team carry
ing the Axe was to make its way
into a local residential section
toward a parked car which was
waiting with an open trunk.
Once again the Axe would be
passed, and the second set of
motorcyclists would make

their way to the safety of a local
residence, occupied by a sup
portive group of Stanford
alumni.
When the car driver de
termined that the coast was
clear of pursuing Cal sup
porters, he would transport the
Axe to his home in San Rafael
and await the joyous arrival of
his partners in the heist.
The other characters would
each depart the scene by
means of carefully-planned es
cape routes, leaving behind
only an "astonished" photog
rapher, dolly, and crowd of
Dirty Golden Bear fans.
Unfortunately, the plan
failed to take into account the
ineptitude of the Weenies.
Back in the SID office, the Di
rector called upon his staff to
produce the Axe. It wasn't

there. <\s part of pre-game
preparations the \\e had been
sent to a local trophv shop to
undergo cleaning and re
furbishment.
Despite the fury vented on
his staff bv tho Sports Informa
tion Director for failing to co
ordinate the photo session
properly, the heist was effec
tively thwarted, and efforts at
rescheduling the event were
unsuccessful.
The Axe remained safely, if
ineptly, in the Weenie' hands.
•\s driver Eddie Poplawski
put it, "It's just like the old fish
ing story where all you can do is
talk about how it got away."
Perhaps the Stanford foot
ball team can still land the
trophv tomorrow with a grid
iron heist.

went into action as the heist
members reviewed themselves
one last time. Five cars and two
motorcycles departed forarch
rival Berkeley.
At 10 a.m., an AP/UPI pho
tographer entered the athletic
department office at Cal. The
cameraman intoduced himself,
wondering if the free-lance
writer had arrived yet. Wel
comed by Cal officials, the
photographer was escorted to
several likely spots for the
photo session while awaiting
the arrival of the tardy journal
ist.

'Our abort

words 4 Stop or \'\\

— Mark Breier,
heist organizer

Soon the office was filled
with photo session participants
as former Stanford dolly Terri
Oppelt entered, followed by a
Cal cheerleader and the jour
nalist. Each of the eighteen per
formers was in position to be
gin the plot; all that was
needed was the Axe.
In accordance to the plan,
the journalist would conduct
an interview with the Sports In
formation Director while the
photographer initiated the
photo session with the dollies
and Axe at a predetermined lo
cation.
During the session the pho
tographer would pose the
(jollies in a mock tug-of-war,
each struggling for the Axe be
tween them. Upon the signal of

the photographer, an ongoing
lovers' quarrel nearbv (carried
out bv two members of the
group) would become increas
ingly violent until the two char
acters would break out into a
noisy shouting match, hopeful
ly distracting any guards re
sponsible for the security of the
Axe.
In an instant, a six-foot five
inch jogger (portrayed by
freshman Shaun Pickering)
would rush the Axe at the same
moment the photographer had
taken hold of the Cal dolly's
side of the Axe. Making his es
cape towards the cleared back
ground area in the picture,
Pickering would bolt across a
wooded creek, emerging on a
street on the far side.
As he ran, the speedster
would pass four large men jog
ging in the opposite direction,

providing a group of seeming
ly-innocent obstacles to slow
whatever pursuit might have
gathered among the Cal peo
ple.
The Axe-bearer would hand
the trophy to the rear partner
of a waiting motorcycle team,
which would immediately
speed away from the scene.
Jumping on the back of a sec
ond waiting motorcycle, the
thief would make his getaway,
traveling in the opposite direc
tion of the first team and lend
ing to the confusion of the
chase.
The motorcycle team carry
ing the Axe was to make its way
into a local residential section
toward a parked car which was
waiting with an open trunk.
Once again the Axe would be
passed, and the second set of
motorcyclists would make

their way to the safety of a local
residence, occupied by a sup
portive group of Stanford
alumni.
When the car driver de
termined that the coast was
clear of pursuing Cal sup
porters, he would transport the
Axe to his home in San Rafael
and await the joyous arrival of
his partners in the heist.
The other characters would
each depart the scene by
means of carefully-planned es
cape routes, leaving behind
only an "astonished" photog
rapher, dolly, and crowd of
Dirty Golden Bear fans.
Unfortunately, the plan
failed to take into account the
ineptitude of the Weenies.
Back in the SID office, the Di

ELEMENTS OF THE PLOT —
In their efforts to steal the

Tomorrow representatives
of the Dirty Golden Bears will
make their military entrance
into Stanford Stadium, gleeful

Stanford Axe as though it is
rightfully theirs.
They're so ignorant.

California officials turned the
event into the best Stanford
fish story this fall.
"A successful Stanford at
tempt to steal the Axe," said
heist organizer Mark Breier,
was marred by "a Berkeley
fumbling in trying to give it to
us."
The plot originated as Breier,
a Class of 1981 graduate,
searcher) for ideas to promote
Amazing Events Unlimited, a
good times company he as
sembled last spring together
with two Stanford classmates.
Offering a multitude of ser
vices catering to party and
event organizations, Breier's
company had performed
events ranging from an "in
credible date for two" to a
fully-catered dinner party
complete with a pair of bumbl
ing servants.
What event, Breier asked the
set of friends he called upon in
a brainstorming session several
weeks ago, could possibly be
more amazing than stealing the
Axe right out from under the
Weenies' noses?
The group responded im
mediately with a variety of
plots and scenarios which
ranged from the implausible to
the illegal to the downright
dangerous. Soon they agreed,
however, that the attempt be
governed by ground rules pro
hibiting as much violence and
criminal behavior as possible.
There were to be no casualties.
As Breier said later, "Our
abort condition was the words
'Stop or I'll shoot.' "
After several further meet
ings in which the plan was fine
ly honed and envisioned,
members of the group began
to lav the groundwork in the
University of California Sports
Information Department (SID).
Posing as a reporter from a
national sports magazine, jun
ior Doug Mitchell approached
the Berkeley athletic depart

ment with the story that he was
writing an article on Pac-Ten
sports rivalries, including the
traditional contest between
Stanford and the University of
California. His request to visit
the Berkeley campus was met
with enthusiasm from Cal of
ficials.
Mitchell called again several
days later to establish a time
and date for the interview and
photo session, coyly allowing
the official to suggest that per
haps the famous Stanford Axe,
symbol of Big Game suprem
acy, be included in the photo
graphs. Mitchell agreed that
including the Axe might be a
good idea.
Meanwhile, heist members
gathered forces and began an
intensive research project on
the credentials needed to pull
off the hoax. Locating the
name of a free-lance writer
from New York, the would-be
robbers obtained biographical
information and a set of busi
ness cards to establish credibili
ty with the Cal officials.
Eighteen characters were
selected to participate in the
theft attempt. Taking advan
tage of some of the finest men
tal and physical represent
ativesof the Stanford com
munity, the ring of theives in
cluded 14 students and four
alumni, several All-America
athletes, a couple of student

land."

ELEMENTS OF THE PLOT —
In their efforts to steal the
Axe, the group of students
and alumni created a phony
business card (snown
above) which helped to
dupe University of Califor
nia Athletic Department of
ficials. A Cal cheerleader
named |udy (pictured at

who fell (or the scam, pos

Mark Breier, Terri Oppelt,

T.J. Heyman and an uniden

on the mix-up that pre
vented the successful tneft
of the Big Came Axe.
Oh, those ridiculous
Weenies!
Tomorrow representatives
of the Dirty Golden Bears will
make their military entrance
into Stanford Stadium, gleeful
ly parading the one and only
Stanford Axe as though it is
rightfully theirs.
They're so ignorant.
You wouldn't believe how
close a group of Stanford stu
dentsandalumni came tosteal

Their remarkable
plan, timed with
split-second

administrative slip

California officials
turned the event
into the best
Stanford fish story
this fall.

California officials turned the
event into the best Stanford
fish story this fall.
"A successful Stanford at
tempt to steal the Axe," said
heist organizer Mark Breier,
was marred by "a Berkeley
fumbling in trying to give it to
us."
The plot originated as Breier,
a Class of 1981 graduate,
searcher) for ideas to promote
Amazing Events Unlimited, a
good times company he as
sembled last spring together
with two Stanford classmates.
Offering a multitude of ser
vices catering to party and
event organizations, Breier's
company had performed
events ranging from an "in
credible date for two" to a
fully-catered dinner party
complete with a pair of bumbl
ing servants.
What event, Breier asked the
set of friends he called upon in
a brainstorming session several
weeks ago, could possibly be
more amazing than stealing the
Axe right out from under the
Weenies' noses?
The group responded im
mediately with a variety of
plots and scenarios which
ranged from the implausible to
the illegal to the downright
dangerous. Soon they agreed,
however, that the attempt be
governed by ground rules pro
hibiting as much violence and
criminal behavior as possible.
There were to be no casualties.
As Breier said later, "Our
abort condition was the words
'Stop or I'll shoot.' "
After several further meet
ings in which the plan was fine
ly honed and envisioned,
members of the group began
to lav the groundwork in the
University of California Sports
Information Department (SID).
Posing as a reporter from a
national sports magazine, jun
ior Doug Mitchell approached
the Berkeley athletic depart

ment with the story that he was
writing an article on Pac-Ten
sports rivalries, including the
traditional contest between
Stanford and the University of
California. His request to visit
the Berkeley campus was met
with enthusiasm from Cal of
ficials.
Mitchell called again several
days later to establish a time
and date for the interview and
photo session, coyly allowing
the official to suggest that per
haps the famous Stanford Axe,
symbol of Big Game suprem
acy, be included in the photo
graphs. Mitchell agreed that
including the Axe might be a
good idea.
Meanwhile, heist members
gathered forces and began an
intensive research project on
the credentials needed to pull
off the hoax. Locating the
name of a free-lance writer
from New York, the would-be
robbers obtained biographical
information and a set of busi
ness cards to establish credibili
ty with the Cal officials.
Eighteen characters were
selected to participate in the
theft attempt. Taking advan
tage of some of the finest men
tal and physical represent
ativesof the Stanford com
munity, the ring of theives in
cluded 14 students and four
alumni, several All-America
athletes, a couple of student
government leaders, a number
of dormitory R As, a former dol
ly and a salesman of "green
lipped mussels from New Zea
land."
Tuesday morning the staff as
sembled at the Airport Sher
idan hoteltocarryouttheplan.
Hours of practice and planning
went into action as the heist
members reviewed themselves
one last time. Five cars and two
motorcycles departed forarch
rival Berkeley.
At 10 a.m., an AP/UPI pho
tographer entered the athletic
department office at Cal. The
cameraman intoduced himself,
wondering if the free-lance
writer had arrived yet. Wel
comed by Cal officials, the
photographer was escorted to
several likely spots for the
photo session while awaiting
the arrival of the tardy journal
ist.

'Our abort
condition was the
words 4 Stop or \'\\
shoot/'
— Mark Breier,
heist organizer

Soon the office was filled
with photo session participants
as former Stanford dolly Terri
Oppelt entered, followed by a
Cal cheerleader and the jour
nalist. Each of the eighteen per
formers was in position to be
gin the plot; all that was
needed was the Axe.
In accordance to the plan,
the journalist would conduct
an interview with the Sports In
formation Director while the
photographer initiated the
photo session with the dollies
and Axe at a predetermined lo
cation.
During the session the pho
tographer would pose the
(jollies in a mock tug-of-war,
each struggling for the Axe be
tween them. Upon the signal of

the photographer, an ongoing
lovers' quarrel nearbv (carried
out bv two members of the
group) would become increas
ingly violent until the two char
acters would break out into a
noisy shouting match, hopeful
ly distracting any guards re
sponsible for the security of the
Axe.
In an instant, a six-foot five
inch jogger (portrayed by
freshman Shaun Pickering)
would rush the Axe at the same
moment the photographer had
taken hold of the Cal dolly's
side of the Axe. Making his es
cape towards the cleared back
ground area in the picture,
Pickering would bolt across a
wooded creek, emerging on a
street on the far side.
As he ran, the speedster
would pass four large men jog
ging in the opposite direction,

providing a group of seeming
ly-innocent obstacles to slow
whatever pursuit might have
gathered among the Cal peo
ple.
The Axe-bearer would hand
the trophy to the rear partner
of a waiting motorcycle team,
which would immediately
speed away from the scene.
Jumping on the back of a sec
ond waiting motorcycle, the
thief would make his getaway,
traveling in the opposite direc
tion of the first team and lend
ing to the confusion of the
chase.
The motorcycle team carry
ing the Axe was to make its way
into a local residential section
toward a parked car which was
waiting with an open trunk.
Once again the Axe would be
passed, and the second set of
motorcyclists would make

their way to the safety of a local
residence, occupied by a sup
portive group of Stanford
alumni.
When the car driver de
termined that the coast was
clear of pursuing Cal sup
porters, he would transport the
Axe to his home in San Rafael
and await the joyous arrival of
his partners in the heist.
The other characters would
each depart the scene by
means of carefully-planned es
cape routes, leaving behind
only an "astonished" photog
rapher, dolly, and crowd of
Dirty Golden Bear fans.
Unfortunately, the plan
failed to take into account the
ineptitude of the Weenies.
Back in the SID office, the Di
rector called upon his staff to
produce the Axe. It wasn't

there. <\s part of pre-game
preparations the \\e had been

Despite the fury vented on
his staff bv tho Sports Informa
tion Director for failing to co
ordinate the photo session
properly, the heist was effec
tively thwarted, and efforts at
rescheduling the event were
unsuccessful.
The Axe remained safely, if
ineptly, in the Weenie' hands.
