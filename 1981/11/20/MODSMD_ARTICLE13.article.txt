# Of bonfires, gaieties, axes and SF takeovers

### Debbie Appel 
rhe very first Big Game be
tween Stanford and University
of California at Berkeley (Cal)
got off to a late start. There
were no television cameras
stalling for commercial time in
1892, just a Stanford team man
ager named Herbert Hoover
who forgot to bring the foot
ball. Only after a local sporting
goods store owner rode his
horse into town to get a ball did
the game go on as scheduled.
Stanford won that first game,
14-10, and since then has com
piled a 19-34-10 record against
its rival university across the
Bay. With this classic football ri
valry has developed a colorful
tradition of parties, pranks,
rallies and intense school spirit,
rarely equalled by any other in
college history.
The axe
The most famous tradition
associated with the Stanford-
Cal rivalry is the axe, a han
dleless chunk of metal which
made its first public debut at an
1899 Stanford-Cal baseball
playoff game, as an inspiration
to the "Give'em the axe, the
axe, the axe," cheer.
Stanford yell leader Billy Erb
used the axe to chop Cal's
mascot bear to shreds at the
next pre-game rally. Berkeley
studentsthen stole the axe, and
it remained at Cal for the next
31 years despite numerous at
tempts of Stanford students to
retrieve it.
The axe was finally brought
back to Stanford in 1930,
through an ingenious plot by
several students who called
themselves the "Immortal 21."
Posing as photographers, they
pretended to take a picture of
the axe at a pep rally in
Berkeley. Just as the "cameras"
supposedly clicked, tear gas
and smoke bombs exploded
on the scene. The Immortal 21
managed to capture the axe in
the ensuing chaos, and re
turned home as heroes.
After the rescue, Stanford
decided to put the axe up as a
trophy to the winner of the Big
Game each year, starting with
the 1933 season.
There have been many at
tempts at axe-thievery since
the 1930 heist. The most re
nown effort was by the "In
famous Three," who lured Cal
students to Ming's Restaurant
in Palo Alto after a disappoint
ing Cal victory in 1972. They re
captured the axe by posing as
photographers in much the
same way as their Immortal 21
predecessors had done 40
years before.
Today the axe sits in a vault
on the Berkeley campus, the
result of their 28-23 victory
over Stanford last year. If Stan
ford wins tomorrow, the axe
will spend the next 364 days in a
specially designed bullet proof
case at Tresidder.
The bonfire
Stanford's Big Game Bonfire,
first ignited in 1904, was the
traditional main attraction of
Big Game week. The bonfire
itself was constructed by
fraternity members in the dry
bed of Lake Lagunita, and usu
ally towered over 200 feet tall.
On the Thursday night before
Big Game, the entire student
body converged there to
dance to the Band and watch
the blaze.
The tradition was terminated
in 1977 due to the University's
increased concern for safety.

In 1975 a group of bottle
throwing youths menaced i ■
lice anil spectatorsafterthe \ in
had been scaled down to a
third of its prior si/e.
In 1976, two Stanford stu
dents were injured trying ?o
put telephone poles in pi,ice
for the event. The Bay Area Po'
lution Control Board also ex
pressed concern about the
fire's environmental impact
Last year, "non-fire" festiv
ities at Lake Lagunita included
a Band rally and fireworks dis
play. These activities were re
peated last night following th>*
ann u a I performance of
"Gaieties" at Memorial
Auditorium.
Gaieties
The tradition of "Gaieties," <:
student-run musical produc
tion performed during Big
Game week, dates back to th<•
beginning of Ram's Head. I he
revue was performed in 1911 i
the group's first campus sh< w
and was called "Footbali
Follies," patterned after the
"Ziegfield Follies." A 19.38
handbill boasted, "All of the
important dramatic talent of
the Stanford campus will he
seen in original satiric.i!
sketches, songs and specialty
acts, augmented by a dancing
chorus of 24 specimens oi
feminine pulchritude." T 1
show has since developed ini
parodies and satires.
In 1971 "Gaieties" was a v
tual flop. It featured a numb' •
called "Transylvania" sung '
the tune of Oklahoma Th
show was not produced agai
until 1977.
According to produce
Heather McAvoy, the 19P
show "epitomizes who
'Gaieties' is supposed to be
traditional poke at Berkeley
Stanford, and everyone in Ren
eral."
Other Big Game events
Big Game events vary fro
year to year, and are as bizarre
and outrageous as Stanford
students who arrange them I.
1975, Stanford alumni and D.<
Iv staff members caused an u
roar at Berkeley bv printing
phoney edition of Tho Dai 1
California, the Cal studei
newspaper. A front page stoi y
read that Cal had been sir
pended by the NCAA, ar
would not be eligible for ai
post-season bowl games.
In 1977, the Band performed
from the top of Hoover Tower,
and there was a funeral proces
sion in which the Cal mascot
"Oskv Bear" was pitched int<
the Claw at White Plaza. Cal
students have traditionally re
ciprocated, finding their way t>>
the Stanford campus and paint
ing everything in their path
blue.
This year, as in the past, the
LSJUMB will continue its vital
role in Big Game festivities. The
Band will begin its traditional
parade from the Mark Hopkins
Hotel in San Francisco around
8:30 p.m. Friday evening, and
will end up in Aquatic Park.
According to Stanford Alum
ni Fred Glover, "the Band has
been rallying in San Francisco
for as long as anyone around
here can remember." He said
th.it n liv id Starr Jordan, Stan
lord president in the 1840s,
used to warn students going to
San Francisco not to drink.
"But if vou do drink," Jordan
would tell them, "sing U of Cal
songs."

Other Big Game events
Big Game events vary fro

and outrageous as Stanford
students who arrange them I.
1975, Stanford alumni and D.<

California, the Cal studei
newspaper. A front page stoi y
read that Cal had been sir
pended by the NCAA, ar
would not be eligible for ai
post-season bowl games.
In 1977, the Band performed
from the top of Hoover Tower,
and there was a funeral proces
sion in which the Cal mascot
"Oskv Bear" was pitched int<
the Claw at White Plaza. Cal
students have traditionally re
ciprocated, finding their way t>>
the Stanford campus and paint
ing everything in their path
blue.
This year, as in the past, the
LSJUMB will continue its vital
role in Big Game festivities. The
Band will begin its traditional
parade from the Mark Hopkins
Hotel in San Francisco around
8:30 p.m. Friday evening, and
will end up in Aquatic Park.
According to Stanford Alum
ni Fred Glover, "the Band has
been rallying in San Francisco
for as long as anyone around
here can remember." He said
th.it n liv id Starr Jordan, Stan
lord president in the 1840s,
used to warn students going to
San Francisco not to drink.
"But if vou do drink," Jordan
would tell them, "sing U of Cal
songs."
rhe very first Big Game be
tween Stanford and University
of California at Berkeley (Cal)
got off to a late start. There
were no television cameras
stalling for commercial time in
1892, just a Stanford team man
ager named Herbert Hoover
who forgot to bring the foot
ball. Only after a local sporting
goods store owner rode his
horse into town to get a ball did
the game go on as scheduled.
Stanford won that first game,
14-10, and since then has com
piled a 19-34-10 record against
its rival university across the
Bay. With this classic football ri
valry has developed a colorful
tradition of parties, pranks,
rallies and intense school spirit,
rarely equalled by any other in
college history.
The axe
The most famous tradition
associated with the Stanford-
Cal rivalry is the axe, a han
dleless chunk of metal which
made its first public debut at an
1899 Stanford-Cal baseball
playoff game, as an inspiration
to the "Give'em the axe, the
axe, the axe," cheer.
Stanford yell leader Billy Erb
used the axe to chop Cal's
mascot bear to shreds at the
next pre-game rally. Berkeley
studentsthen stole the axe, and
it remained at Cal for the next
31 years despite numerous at
tempts of Stanford students to
retrieve it.
The axe was finally brought
back to Stanford in 1930,
through an ingenious plot by
several students who called
themselves the "Immortal 21."
Posing as photographers, they
pretended to take a picture of
the axe at a pep rally in
Berkeley. Just as the "cameras"
supposedly clicked, tear gas
and smoke bombs exploded
on the scene. The Immortal 21
managed to capture the axe in
the ensuing chaos, and re
turned home as heroes.
After the rescue, Stanford
decided to put the axe up as a
trophy to the winner of the Big
Game each year, starting with
the 1933 season.
There have been many at
tempts at axe-thievery since
the 1930 heist. The most re
nown effort was by the "In
famous Three," who lured Cal
students to Ming's Restaurant
in Palo Alto after a disappoint
ing Cal victory in 1972. They re
captured the axe by posing as
photographers in much the
same way as their Immortal 21
predecessors had done 40
years before.
Today the axe sits in a vault
on the Berkeley campus, the
result of their 28-23 victory
over Stanford last year. If Stan
ford wins tomorrow, the axe
will spend the next 364 days in a
specially designed bullet proof
case at Tresidder.
The bonfire
Stanford's Big Game Bonfire,
first ignited in 1904, was the
traditional main attraction of
Big Game week. The bonfire
itself was constructed by
fraternity members in the dry
bed of Lake Lagunita, and usu
ally towered over 200 feet tall.
On the Thursday night before
Big Game, the entire student
body converged there to
dance to the Band and watch
the blaze.
The tradition was terminated
in 1977 due to the University's
increased concern for safety.

In 1975 a group of bottle
throwing youths menaced i ■
lice anil spectatorsafterthe \ in
had been scaled down to a
third of its prior si/e.
In 1976, two Stanford stu
dents were injured trying ?o
put telephone poles in pi,ice
for the event. The Bay Area Po'
lution Control Board also ex
pressed concern about the
fire's environmental impact
Last year, "non-fire" festiv
ities at Lake Lagunita included
a Band rally and fireworks dis
play. These activities were re
peated last night following th>*
ann u a I performance of
"Gaieties" at Memorial
Auditorium.
