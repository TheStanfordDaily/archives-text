## Phone shows society's ills 
### 
This was it, he realized, the crucial
life or death moment of their rela
tionship. Their past was now irrele
vant, their future, undefined. If he
didn't say the right thing to her, right
now, he knew that she'd be lost to
him forever. She opened the door.
He cleared his throat. Just then, the
phone rang, and the moment was
lost forever.
The telephone was invented when
some clumsy dolt spilled acid all over
himself and shouted, "Come here
Mr. Watson, I need you." Or so we
are asked to believe. Perhaps Bell had
a lot of self-restraint, but if I was

standing there with acid burning into
my pores, I would be screaming
something much more colorful. At
any rate, we might all have been bet
ter off if Watson had been engaged in
illicit congress with the cham
bermaid when Bell called out for
him.
Since Bell's time, the telephone
has become a powerful force in every
American's life. Most of us hardlv
give this a second thought; like
McDonald's, the telephone is always
there. Yet this is a relatively recent
development. Telephone poles were
not always a basic sign of civilization.
Notso longago movies featured lines
like, "If you want me, just whistle,"
not, "Well, hey, I'm in the book, you
know?"
The telephone has affected every
aspect of our lives. It has created
whole new occupations such as tele
phone solicitation and opinion poll
ing. It has spawned new meaning to
old ones, like call-girl. It has even
created new crimes, for example,
nuisance calls and wiretapping. Can
the designer telephone be far away?
The world awaits impatiently to hear
what comes between Brooke Shields
and her Trimline.
Our indoctrination in telephone
etiquette begins when we are very
voung. We learn from the first that
the telephone is the real master of
the house: "Don't interrupt Mommy
when she's on the phone!" Or,
"Don't touch that! The telephone is

not a tov!" If we didn't get the
message at home, we got it when we
entered school. The phone com
pany, through the goodness of its
heart, distributed educational films
like "Tommy Visits Phoneland." This
epic, rumored to have later inspired
Peckinpah, described graphically
what happens to bad children who
slam down the receiver.
Once we have developed a proper
sense of awe for the telephone, we
begin to use it. V anyone with
vounger siblings knows, the age at
which this occurs is getting lower all
the time. Others need only ask their
local druggist how many "Prince Al
bert in a can" calls he's gotten lately.
•\s we enter adolescence, the role of
the telephone increases dramati
cally Picture the stereotypical gabby
teenager and the long-suffering pa
rents. Who can forget stimulating
conversations like this:
He: Hello.
She: Hi! How are you?
He: Who is this?
She: Oh God, I can't believe you
don't know who this is! Well, if you
don't recognize my voice I guess I'll
hang up and never call you again.
CLICK!
Didn't vou just feel like a jerk?
From adolescence onward, the tele
phone has us hooked.

How is it that this unimpressive lump of plastic
and wire, a device meant to serve mankind,
has become our master? What unwritten law
says that a telephone must be answered? Is a
ringing telephone akin to a Gabriel's trumpet
for the living?

lump of plastic and wire, a device

The telephone is a manifestation of
manv of the changes our society is
undergoing: the depersonalization,
the accelerated pace of living and the
heightened reliance on technology.
Therefore, it should come as no sur
prise that the telephone also points
out many of the ills of our society.
The mere act of picking up the
phone seems to magically transform

some people into ogres. The faceless,
anonymous voice from God-knows
vvhere can say things to you that
would never he said in a face to face
encounter. For example, with no fear
of retribution, the wrong-number
caller has no reason to be polite, and
will often become abusive. One can
argue for days about absolute stan
dards for moral conduct, but the sad
fact is that consideration for others is
not instinctive behavior.
There are crucial differences be
tween telephone conversations and
other means of communication. A
personal visit, for example, involves
permission. One is either asked to
come over, or one asks to be let in. A
telephone, on the other hand, de
mands to be answered. The time
honored technique of letter writing
offers one the opportunity to put off
reading the letter until a convenient
time. A telephone conservation, in
contrast, is immediate and transitory.
The telephone, in its role as Gabriel's
trumpet, simply offers no choices. In
deed, perhaps a better analogy is
Pavlov's dog, who salivated at the
ringing of a bell.
While the telephone is a useful
tool for communication, one should
employ it with full knowledge of its
shortcomings. The next time we are
exhorted by Ma Bell to "reach out

and punch someone" on our push
button phones, perhaps we should
pick up a pen and write a letter in
stead. After all, which shows more ef
fort?
As our society continues to evolve,
undoubtedly, the telephone will
evolve with it. Sometime in the next
decade we can expect to see the
long-promised Picturephone, which
will further expand the frontiers of
interpersonal communication. ]ust
imagine the obscene calls you'll be
able to receive then!

The world awaits impatiently to hear
what comes between Brooke Shields

Our indoctrination in telephone
etiquette begins when we are very
voung. We learn from the first that
the telephone is the real master of
the house: "Don't interrupt Mommy
when she's on the phone!" Or,
"Don't touch that! The telephone is

not a tov!" If we didn't get the
message at home, we got it when we
entered school. The phone com
pany, through the goodness of its
heart, distributed educational films
like "Tommy Visits Phoneland." This
epic, rumored to have later inspired
Peckinpah, described graphically
what happens to bad children who
slam down the receiver.
Once we have developed a proper
sense of awe for the telephone, we
begin to use it. V anyone with
vounger siblings knows, the age at
which this occurs is getting lower all
the time. Others need only ask their
local druggist how many "Prince Al
bert in a can" calls he's gotten lately.
•\s we enter adolescence, the role of
the telephone increases dramati
cally Picture the stereotypical gabby
teenager and the long-suffering pa
rents. Who can forget stimulating
conversations like this:
He: Hello.
She: Hi! How are you?
He: Who is this?
She: Oh God, I can't believe you
don't know who this is! Well, if you
don't recognize my voice I guess I'll
hang up and never call you again.
CLICK!
Didn't vou just feel like a jerk?
From adolescence onward, the tele
phone has us hooked.

How is it that this unimpressive lump of plastic
and wire, a device meant to serve mankind,
has become our master? What unwritten law
says that a telephone must be answered? Is a
ringing telephone akin to a Gabriel's trumpet
for the living?

The telephone is a manifestation of
manv of the changes our society is
undergoing: the depersonalization,
the accelerated pace of living and the
heightened reliance on technology.
Therefore, it should come as no sur
prise that the telephone also points
out many of the ills of our society.
The mere act of picking up the
phone seems to magically transform

some people into ogres. The faceless,
anonymous voice from God-knows
vvhere can say things to you that
would never he said in a face to face
encounter. For example, with no fear
of retribution, the wrong-number
caller has no reason to be polite, and
will often become abusive. One can
argue for days about absolute stan
dards for moral conduct, but the sad
fact is that consideration for others is
not instinctive behavior.
There are crucial differences be
tween telephone conversations and
other means of communication. A
personal visit, for example, involves
permission. One is either asked to
come over, or one asks to be let in. A
telephone, on the other hand, de
mands to be answered. The time
honored technique of letter writing
offers one the opportunity to put off
reading the letter until a convenient
time. A telephone conservation, in
contrast, is immediate and transitory.
The telephone, in its role as Gabriel's
trumpet, simply offers no choices. In
deed, perhaps a better analogy is
Pavlov's dog, who salivated at the
ringing of a bell.
While the telephone is a useful
tool for communication, one should
employ it with full knowledge of its
shortcomings. The next time we are
exhorted by Ma Bell to "reach out

and punch someone" on our push
button phones, perhaps we should
pick up a pen and write a letter in
stead. After all, which shows more ef
fort?
As our society continues to evolve,
undoubtedly, the telephone will
evolve with it. Sometime in the next
decade we can expect to see the
long-promised Picturephone, which
will further expand the frontiers of
interpersonal communication. ]ust
imagine the obscene calls you'll be
able to receive then!

This was it, he realized, the crucial
life or death moment of their rela
tionship. Their past was now irrele
vant, their future, undefined. If he
didn't say the right thing to her, right
now, he knew that she'd be lost to
him forever. She opened the door.
He cleared his throat. Just then, the
phone rang, and the moment was
lost forever.
The telephone was invented when
some clumsy dolt spilled acid all over
himself and shouted, "Come here
Mr. Watson, I need you." Or so we
are asked to believe. Perhaps Bell had
a lot of self-restraint, but if I was

standing there with acid burning into
my pores, I would be screaming
something much more colorful. At
any rate, we might all have been bet
ter off if Watson had been engaged in
illicit congress with the cham
bermaid when Bell called out for
him.
Since Bell's time, the telephone
has become a powerful force in every
American's life. Most of us hardlv
give this a second thought; like
McDonald's, the telephone is always
there. Yet this is a relatively recent
development. Telephone poles were
not always a basic sign of civilization.
Notso longago movies featured lines
like, "If you want me, just whistle,"
not, "Well, hey, I'm in the book, you
know?"
