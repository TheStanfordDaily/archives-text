## Work together to fight rape 
### 
In regard to the noon rally against rape on Monday in
White Plaza, I would like to respond to some of the con
cerns that were brought up and to put forth some of my
own suggestions concerning rape awareness.
First, I want to praise Jim Steyer, a law student, who
gave an excellent speech from the male point of view.
One of his suggestions, which reiterated a Daily letter
that proposed men find a companion each time they go
out after dark for about a week, would be a good ex
ercise in general awareness. This exercise would give
men some sense of frustration a woman feels when she
wants or has to go somewhere after dark. What is a wom
an supposed to do if no one is around? Fortunately, she
can call SURE escort service, but isn't it unfortunate that
we even need a service like this which admits the ex
istence of unsafe conditions? In any case, I urge men to
trv this exercise and see how they feel about a situation
that everv woman faces daily. Paranoia is an unhealthy
feeling to have to live with, but society today doesn't al
low women to feel comfortable walking alone at night.
Second, if men have, in fact, been socialized to be so
powerful, dominating, and somewhat sex-oriented,
then why don't they show their power in an even
stronger way by restraining their urges rather than suc
cumbing to them?
Third, I believe that we, as women, whether or not we
believe rapists to be "kooks", must be careful not to ov
erstep and take this to another extreme by believing that
all men are bad in this way and that they are all out for
their own selfish satisfaction. This is obviously true for
some men, but in no way is it true for all males. Men can

bo just <is understanding and sensitive as women —
whether some of them easily express this sensitivity is an
other matter — and women can be strong and domi
nating just as men are.
In other words, women,, in our attempts to help our
counterparts better understand the problem of rape, we
must remember that men are not basically insensitive,
uncaring brutes who are unwilling to learn. And, men, in
vour attempts to understand rape and rape's effects on
women, don't be afraid to show that strong-yet-sensi
tive, "softer" side of yourselves. It does not disgrace your
manhood to do so; rather it enhances it, and you will
more than likelv find that women will respect you all the
more for revealing this often-hidden aspect of your
selves.
In order to combat rape and its effects, we must all re
alize that relationships between men and women should
be based on love, care, and understanding and that they
should be mutual agreements, never oppressive vio
lations. Too, we must realize that the problem of rape
needs solving by men and Women together in our natu
ral harmony, and not through bitterness and enemv tac
tics, so to speak.
Finallv, the unfortunate element in this whole situ
ation (besides the rapes themselves) is that so much had
to occur to bring about this heightened rape awareness.
Whv (lid they (the rapes, assaults, ensuing articlesand ral
ly) have to happen at all to open people's eyes? What
(foes it take to make people aware of, and most im
portantly, sensitive to a woman's right to say no?
