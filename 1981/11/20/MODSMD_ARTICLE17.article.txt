## PATCO had right to disobey after oath broken 
### 
Lima PATCO air traffic controller,
and have been on strike for 103 days.
I am compelled to respond to Joe
Rodota's article, "Don't Rehire Air
Controllers" (Daily, Nov. 11).
I a in appalled that the "en
lightened" academic community has
not seen this labor dispute for what it
really is. As a history-student, I feel
Rodota should have a clearer under
standing than he displays as to the
role of civil disobedience in the
progress and formation of our na
tion. Our country was in fact born
out of an act of civil disobedience by
the breaking of an oath to the King of
England. Where would civil rights or
the women's movement be today
without civil disobedience?
Rodota accepts the fact that public
employee unions serve a useful
purpose. True, we allow public
unions to organize; however we re
fuse to allow them to act as a union.
VVhv should federal employees be
treated as second-class citizens in
unions which are unable to collec
tively bargain for wages, hours, or re
tirement programs?
PATCO mistakenly believed Presi
dent Ronald Reagan when, in a letter
to PATCO president Robert Poli on
Oct. 20, 1980, Reagan pledged to
"work very closelv with (PATCO) to
bring about a spirit of cooperation
between the President and the air taf
fic controllers." He acknowledged
"the deplorable state of our nation's
air traffic control system . . . that too
few people working unreasonable
hours with obsolete equipment has
placed the nation's air travelers in
unwarranted danger." He broke his
oath to us.
PATCO has for 11 years to
right the problems of the air traffic
control system and the controller's
profession through legitimate chan
nels. While controller productivity
has increased dramatically and air
traffic has increased 44 percent from
1974-80, the controller workforce de
creased by 6 percent. By the govern
ment's own statistics, 89 percent of
the controllers in this country do not
reach normal retirement age. PAT
CO's contract with the FAA expired
in Marih 1981. Out of 37 negotiating
sessions, only four out of 99 contrac
tual articles were tentatively agreed
upon. After months of fruitless nego
tiations and bad-faith bargaining by
the FAA, 80 percent of the air traffic

control workforce could no longer
tolerate the frustration of working
under deplorable conditions and
withheld their labor in an effort to
achieve much-needed improve
ments.
This is a country that prides itself
on the belief of punishment befitting
the crime. We tolerate the pardoning
of a man who committed crimes from
the highest office in the land, yet can
not accept an act of civil disobe
dience by a group of employees
working fora branch of the govern
ment which, by its own admission,
has severe management problems.
Isn't it time for the administration to
admit that enough is enough, and
honor Reagan's commitments to
PATCO?
PATCO is people. Whether or not
we're recognized on paper as an or
ganization, we exist; and we'll con
tinue to fight for improvement of the
air traffic controller profession and
the safetv of the public's airways.

Militant reaction
The anger and frustration apparent
in Jeanne Fleming and Susan Ham
mond's letter (Daily, Nov. 13) on rape
convinced me of the serious nature
of the problem. At first, I could not
completely believe that their sugges
tion was serious. My second re
sponse wasa growing suspicion that I
would quite literally be shot down by
a militant feminist sniper during my
morning jog on the basis that I was
out "terrorizing women."
What I am left with is the convic
tion that rape, like other violent at
tacks, is an intolerable presence in
this society. The meat cleaver of capi
tal punishment seems to me to be an
unsatisfactory solution. Still, I won
der how many more of my friends
must be victims of violence before I
change my mind.

Redirect energies
When a group of women get at
tacked and a feeling of uneasiness
pervades the campus, what does the

Stanford community do? It holds a
rallv and breaks out the arm bands.
Terrific.
The recent outbreak of attacks on
women here unquestionably calls for
drastic measures. Furthermore, it is
certainly reassuring to see that so
many people, both men and women,
are willing to take action to remedy
the situation. However, rallies and
arm bands accomplish nothing. They
merely represent an outlet for the
outrage and helplessness that so
many, myself included, are feeling.
Rather than doing something to cor
rect the problem, people have only
been pretending to do so. By holding
rallies and wearing arm bands, peo
ple fool themselves into thinking that
they are actually helping to eliminate
rape. Seriously now, I doubt that the
next time an attack occurs here, the
rapist will pause, stricken by the fear
that his actions might cause another
rally or that people might begin to
wear two arm bands.
I don't pretend to have any an
swers to the rash of attacks. I wish that
certain others would do the same
and redirect their energies to more
effective activities.

Pedal your moped
Cedric Harris's informative article
on mopeds (Daily, Nov. 12) recog
nized a serious issue: walkers (and bi
cyclists) have "yet another vehicle
from which to dodge." He missed a
great opportunity to help solve this
problem: the article failed to men
tion a little-known University traffic
regulation which, if generally
obeyed, would do wonders for the
safety and sanity of non-motorized
users of the sidewalks.
Unlike some jurisdictions which
treat mopeds as bicycles, the Univer
sity wisely lumps mopeds together
with motorcycles. "No . . . gasoline
powered cycle shall be driven or op
erated within 100 feet of any
classroom or library building .. . mo
tor driven cycles must not be oper
ated within any area closed to auto
mobiles, including bike paths."
How about it, mopedalists? The
next time you leave the street and
ride between a pair of bollards, try
turning off the engine and actually

using the pedals on that thing. I think
you'll be gratified to see the frowns
and startled looks on the faces of pe
destrians around you change into
peaceful smiles.

It's only a buck
We have decided to make an issue
out of nothing: Nancy Anderson's
letter about the Sunday Flicks (Daily,
Nov. 18). Where is it written down
that theSunday Flicks are supposed
to be "great films" and not study
breaks for "rowdies?" And who says
"rowdies" can't appreciate a "great
film" now and then?
The Sunday Flicks crowd provides
an important insight into movie ap
preciation. Time and time again we
see examples of this fact. Last year,
for instance, the splendor of "Dr.
Zhivago" was, we felt, mostly en
hanced by a surprisingly large and di
verse band of virtuoso whistlers sup
plying us with their fluid rendition of
"Lara's Theme." And just how many
phallic symbols do you think you
could have picked up on if those
"rowdies" hadn't been so verbal at
"The Blue Lagoon?"
All right. So "Ordinary People"
isn't a film to get rowdy about. Fine.
But having seen the film once al
ready, why would one expect to ap
preciate its emotional fervor at Mem
Aud of all places? We're not dealing
with an audience of just ordinary
people here. This is the distraught,
overworked, pressured Stanford stu
dent body that needs that "rowdi
ness." Mem Aud on a Sunday night is
just no place for profound emotion.
And what do you want fora buck,
anyway?
