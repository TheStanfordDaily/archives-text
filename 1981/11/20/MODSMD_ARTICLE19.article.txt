Denver — Federal in
vestigators found "classic signs
of theft of oil" during their vis
its to the Teapot Dome oil re
servo in Wyoming, a source
close to the investigation of t he
facility has told The Denver
Post.
"There were no locksorseals
on any tank outlets. Heck,
there were no locks or seals on
the entire field anywhere,"
said the source, who saw
telltale splashes of oil running
down the side of tank batteries,
indicating oil was being re
moved from the thief (or top)
hatch.
"There was uncontrolled ve
hicular access through three or
four roads with no fences, no
guards, no nothing. We sus
pected they were taking it (oil)
any way they could. There was
a helluva gap right there. Noth
ing would have prevented any
one dishonest from loading

up," another source added.
Reports like those have
drawn the FBI and the Depart
ment of Justice into an in
vestigation of Naval Petroleum
Reserve No. 3 at Teapot Dome.
Already it has resulted in the
indictment of two men on a va
riety of felony charges, includ
ing fraud, offering or receiving
kickbacks, bribery and theft.
Knowledgeable sources have
estimated that losses of oil and
oil-field equipment from the
reserve could total "several
million dollars."
Frederick Williams, the
former local director of
purchasing for Fenix & Scisson
Inc., the company that man
aged Teapot Dome under con
tract for the federal govern
ment, was arrested over the
weekend in Los Angeles.
Douglas Rawson, vice presi
dent of an oil-field repair ser
vice that did business at Teapot
Dome, was served with a sum

mc>ns and has agreed to return
voluntarily to face charges in
Wyoming.
Sources indicated that about
25 cases of suspected criminal
actions at Teapot Dome had
been forwarded to the FBI for
investigation.
Located in the shadow of a
rock formation shaped like its
name about 50 miles north of
Casper, Teapot Dome was the
scene of a leasing scandal in the
1920s in which Albert Fall, in
terior secretary for President
Warren Harding, was sent to
prison for taking a $100,000
bribe.

One of The Post's sources
siid the field was an open
target for thieves. " The general
opportunity for theft was so
obvious, oh man the
source said.
Anderson discounted the
possibility that a thief would
drive through the guarded
main gate with a truckload of
stolen oil, because it would be
easier to take unguarded
routes out of the reserve.
Asked if his guards checked
tanker drivers for"run tickets,"
or oil receipts required by fed
eral law, Anderson said, "That,
I don't know."
