# Radioactive wastes disposal cleaning procedure questioned
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
University policy regarding radio
active wastes is not limited to re
search activities in the engineering
labs. Some patients at the hospital
and Medical Center here undergo
radioactive therapy, a process which
presents a problem in terms of dis
posing of wastes and cleaning the
hospital rooms used in this treat
ment.
Officials at the office of Health
Physics and Health Safety (HPHS), the

/Slews analysis

department responsible for dealing
with the administration of the thera
py and disposal of the wastes, argue
that Stanford takes "a more stringent
view of the matter than even state or
federal regulations require," and
that no room is opened even to
housekeeping staff before "levels of
radioactivity have been checked by
our technicians and determined to
be down to normal levels of back
ground radiation."
However, information from a
source within HPHS raises questions
of whether there are discrepancies in
this policy.
This summer a patient at the Uni
versity Medical Center undergoing
radioactive iodine treatment "se
verely contaminated his room to the
extent where it should have been
closed down," according to the
source. But the second floor room
received only normal decontamina
tion and, against the advice of this
person, was used by another patient
shortly thereafter.
"I would have replaced the tiles in
the floor at least," said the source. "I
took radiation courses, and I
wouldn't have let a member of my
family stay in the room due to the
level of radioactivity."
The source said this is actually the
only time he personally felt uneasy
about the final decision.
The hospital and Med Center treat
about one or two patients a month
with radioactive lodine 131, general
ly used for patients with thyroid ma
lignancies, according to John
Holmes, senior health physicist for
HPHS. The substance, which is in
gested by the patient, enters the
bloodstream, and fora certain period
all the patient's bodily fluids are radi
oactive. However, often such treat
ment induces nausea and vomiting.
The radioactivity from the iodine,
which is a beta-gamma emitter, can
permeate materials such as the sink,
toilet and floor.
According to a handbook dis

tributed by HPHS to all hospital staff
who are involved in the radioactive
therapy, half the dose of lodine 131 is
excreted in the first 48 hours. Since
the patient's perspiration is con
taminated, anything handled by the
patient is also contaminated.
Furthermore, the patient's radio
active urine is flushed into the public
sewer system.
"In the incident you're thinking of
this summer, the person got nau
seous directly after taking the
iodine," said Holmes. He said floors
and beds are covered with protective
materials, and that this specific room
was cleaned and monitored as nor
mal.
"The state and federal govern
ments are aware of the radioactive
urine, and we are well below the
maximum volume allowed," said
Holmes. "The radioactivity is also
diluted by all the sewage in the sys
tem."
Roland Finston, director of HPHS,
said no room has ever had to be
closed due to inordinate amounts of
radioactivity.
"Nausea and vomiting are known
side-effects of such therapy," he said.
"The rooms are cleaned with a
chlorinal-based kitchen cleanser,
which is quite effective in releasing
most of the bound iodine into clean
ing water."
Finston also said a couple patients
receiving radioactive therapy require
medical appliances around the
throat to aid breathing, and these ap
pliances facilitate a greater release of
radioactivity. "There is subsequently
a higher level of contamination,
which requires more extensive
cleanup," he said.
lodine 131 has a half-life of eight
days, he added, so after a relatively
short time the radioactivity decreases
dramatically.
But a certain amount of radio
activity is left in the sinks and toilets
of the rooms these patients occupy.
The University does not have a specif
ic ward for treatment of radioactive
therapy patients, since "it's a rare
type of patient and we can't reserve
rooms solely for that purpose," ac
cording to Finston.
"There's never been a case where
we can't get the room cleaned up,"
said Holmes. Normal background ra
diation, measured in m-rads per
hour, is .02, he said. Usually the level
will reach a "fixed" level of .2 within
the rooms used. He admitted that at
certain key points, such as around
the drain of the sinks, the level may
approach the maximum of 1.0 m-rads
per hour, but that radioactivity is usu
ally highly confined.

said Holmes. Normal background ra
diation, measured in m-rads per
hour, is .02, he said. Usually the level
will reach a "fixed" level of .2 within
the rooms used. He admitted that at
certain key points, such as around
the drain of the sinks, the level may
approach the maximum of 1.0 m-rads
per hour, but that radioactivity is usu
ally highly confined.
University policy regarding radio
active wastes is not limited to re
search activities in the engineering
labs. Some patients at the hospital
and Medical Center here undergo
radioactive therapy, a process which
presents a problem in terms of dis
posing of wastes and cleaning the
hospital rooms used in this treat
ment.
Officials at the office of Health
Physics and Health Safety (HPHS), the

/Slews analysis

department responsible for dealing
with the administration of the thera
py and disposal of the wastes, argue
that Stanford takes "a more stringent
view of the matter than even state or
federal regulations require," and
that no room is opened even to
housekeeping staff before "levels of
radioactivity have been checked by
our technicians and determined to
be down to normal levels of back
ground radiation."
However, information from a
source within HPHS raises questions
of whether there are discrepancies in
this policy.
This summer a patient at the Uni
versity Medical Center undergoing
radioactive iodine treatment "se
verely contaminated his room to the
extent where it should have been
closed down," according to the
source. But the second floor room
received only normal decontamina
tion and, against the advice of this
person, was used by another patient
shortly thereafter.
"I would have replaced the tiles in
the floor at least," said the source. "I
took radiation courses, and I
wouldn't have let a member of my
family stay in the room due to the
level of radioactivity."
The source said this is actually the
only time he personally felt uneasy
about the final decision.
The hospital and Med Center treat
about one or two patients a month
with radioactive lodine 131, general
ly used for patients with thyroid ma
lignancies, according to John
Holmes, senior health physicist for
HPHS. The substance, which is in
gested by the patient, enters the
bloodstream, and fora certain period
all the patient's bodily fluids are radi
oactive. However, often such treat
ment induces nausea and vomiting.
The radioactivity from the iodine,
which is a beta-gamma emitter, can
permeate materials such as the sink,
toilet and floor.
According to a handbook dis

tributed by HPHS to all hospital staff
who are involved in the radioactive
therapy, half the dose of lodine 131 is
excreted in the first 48 hours. Since
the patient's perspiration is con
taminated, anything handled by the
patient is also contaminated.
Furthermore, the patient's radio
active urine is flushed into the public
sewer system.
"In the incident you're thinking of
this summer, the person got nau
seous directly after taking the
iodine," said Holmes. He said floors
and beds are covered with protective
materials, and that this specific room
was cleaned and monitored as nor
mal.
"The state and federal govern
ments are aware of the radioactive
urine, and we are well below the
maximum volume allowed," said
Holmes. "The radioactivity is also
diluted by all the sewage in the sys
tem."
Roland Finston, director of HPHS,
said no room has ever had to be
closed due to inordinate amounts of
radioactivity.
"Nausea and vomiting are known
side-effects of such therapy," he said.
"The rooms are cleaned with a
chlorinal-based kitchen cleanser,
which is quite effective in releasing
most of the bound iodine into clean
ing water."
Finston also said a couple patients
receiving radioactive therapy require
medical appliances around the
throat to aid breathing, and these ap
pliances facilitate a greater release of
radioactivity. "There is subsequently
a higher level of contamination,
which requires more extensive
cleanup," he said.
lodine 131 has a half-life of eight
days, he added, so after a relatively
short time the radioactivity decreases
dramatically.
But a certain amount of radio
activity is left in the sinks and toilets
of the rooms these patients occupy.
The University does not have a specif
ic ward for treatment of radioactive
therapy patients, since "it's a rare
type of patient and we can't reserve
rooms solely for that purpose," ac
cording to Finston.
