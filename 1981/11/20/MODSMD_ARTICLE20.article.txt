# On tour with her new book
## Mormon 'heretic' fights for ERA passage 
### Los Angeles Times 
Irvine, Calif. — Sonia Johnson,
former Mormon and current heretic,
stands erect before the wooden
podium in the steep-sided lecture hall
at jhe University of California Irvine,
talking sacrifice.
Women, she says, gripping the
wooden stand with determined hands,
must be willing to sacrifice their lives,
their reputations, their fortunes, if the
Equal Rights Amendment is to achieve
ratification.
"So," she adds, in her best 'non-ag
gressive, Mormon-woman' voice, "let's
riot, shall we?"
Johnson first came to the public eye
in 1978, when, a theretofore devout
Mormon, she began sparring with her
church's leaders over the equal rights
amendment.
Her private agonies became public —
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints (Mormon) tried and convicted
her of sedition, excommunicating her
from the church to which her family
had belonged for five generations

Her brother publicly called for her
damnation, her husband — although
supporting her equal rights stance —
divorced tier to marry another.
But two years later, in the first week of
her first book tour, promoting the auto
biographical From Housewife to Here
tic across California, she is single-mind
edly happy.
She scrambles from book signing to
book signing, extolling the virtues of
the FRA and exhorting women to take
part in the final seven-month push
before the ratification deadline] une .30.
Bv her own account, her other life
was good, too, as far as it went, that life
that ended in 1978 when she became a
feminist.
it was in Virginia in April of 1978 that
she, her then-husband and a few
friends attended a church meeting
whore, ostensibly, they were to learn
the evils of the FRA. Mrs. Johnson was
not convinced.
A church leader began the anti-ERA
talk, she says, by admitting that he had
not prepared himself for the meeting —

an admission that Johnson considered
unspeakably insensitive.
His second mistake, she says looking
back, was reading the equal rights
amendment. At that moment, John
son's life changed.
"I was pro-ERA in a mild sort of way,"
she remembers. "But when he read it
that night, it took hold of my heart. And
it hasn't let go, for one second, waking
or sleeping, since."
She became one of the four founders
of Mormons for the ERA — current
membership 1200 — and later engaged
in a heated debate with Sen. Orrin
Hatch (R-Utah), a Mormon, during
hearings about the extension of the
FRA deadline.
She recalls it as a "delightfully brisk
interchange." Hatch, however, was not
amused; at one point he accused her of
insulting his Mormon wife.
But in late, 1979, after more than a
year of publicly supporting the ERA and
criticizing the Mormon church for its
efforts against the amendment, she was
ordered to stand trial before a church

tribunal.
Her church trial, conducted in De
cember 1979, was brief; the decision —
excommunication. A regional appeal
was turned down in March 1980, and
the international Mormon head
quarters upheld her excommunication
a month later.
That same month, she began writing
the book. It was, she says, a catharsis. "I
wept through a lot of it. I'd be sitting on
pianos writing and tears would be drip
ping off my nose."
In Salt Lake City, headquarters of the
Mormons, there is very little demand
for speeches by Johnson. Curiously,
however, bookstores in the area have
stocked up on her book, anticipating
that Mormons will buy it. "To reassure
themselves that I am truly evil," she sug
gests.
Today, ERA forces remain three states
shy of ratification, with time slipping
away. Nonetheless, Johnson feels op
timistic.
