Senators seek budget cut
Washington — Senate Republican leaders
agreed yesterday to seek $3.6 billion in new cuts
from domestic programs but spare defense in a
bid to avoid a veto of legislation needed to keep
the government from running out of money at
midnight tonight.
Without the additional spending cuts — an
average of 4 percent in hundreds of programs
— President Ronald Reagan "would undoub
tedly veto" the huge emergency bill, said Sen
ate Republican Leader Howard Baker.
He said a veto, in turn, probably would force
Congress into an around-the-clock weekend
session to produce a second measure that Rea
gan would approve.
But with the cuts, Baker added, Reagan
would put his signature on the measure needed
to keep virtually the entire federal government
in business.
Baker predicted the Senate would vote itsap
proval later in the day for the plan, which would
exempt the Pentagon, foreign aid and benefit
programs such as food stamps and Medicare
from the newest i uund ot spending reductions.
A final Senate vote on the $417.4 billion
spending legislation — still $2.3 billion more
than Reagan wants — was expected last night or
today. The bill would then return to the House,
which earlier this week rejected a similar plan
for new cuts.
White House spokesman David Gergen,
however, refused to tell reporters if Reagan
considers the $3.6 billion cut Baker is pushing
sufficient, even though Bakersaid it would satis
fy the president.
Soviets challenge proposals
Moscow — The Soviet Union launched a ma
jor new propaganda drive yesterday to counter
the impact of President Ronald Reagan's arms
control proposals by portraying them as an at
tempt to "deceive" public opinion and under
mine Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev's forth
coming visit to Bonn.
Initial Western reaction to Reagan's speech
Wednesday appears to have prompted concern
here that Moscow could lose propaganda
momentum it believes it has in encouraging
West European opposition to the stationing of
new Mnerican medium-range nuclear missiles.
A rash of commentaries yesterday appeared
designed to maintain that momentum by re
newed exploitation of Reagan's recent remarks
that "an exchange of tactical nuclear weapons"
in Europe was conceivable without escalating
into an all-out exchange between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
The government newspaper Izvestia last
night set the central theme of Soviet commen
taries by asserting that Wednesday's speech was
designed to "impress on uninformed persons"
the notion that the Reagan administration has
developed a peace initiative of its own.
Meanwhile, the White House said yesterday
it was "disappointed" by Moscow's initial pub
lic reaction to President Reagan's dramatic new
arms control proposals, administration officials
said privately they are "neither surprised nor
discouraged" by that response.
"Nobody expected that they (the Soviets)
would immediately embrace" the president's
call for elimination of planned and existing U.S.
and Soviet intermediate-range missile forces in
Europe, the official said.
NRC axes Diablo license
Washington — The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission yesterday suspended the operating
license of the Diablo Canyon atomic power
plant, saving it would require verification of
earthquake protection equipment at the trou
bled California facility.
The NRC decision came at a closed hearing
hours after a congressional subcommittee at
which new questions were raised about the
safety of nuclear power.
NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino said the
vote to suspend the license was unanimous.
"An order suspending the Diablo Canyon
license has been approved by the commission,"

he said.
He added that there was division as to how
the seismic verification would be ac
complished, a key point since the utility that
owns the plant wants to use its own consultant.
But California Gov. jerry Brown is insisting on a
study independent of the plant's owner.
Earlier, Palladino told a congressional sub
committee that his confidence in the nuclear
establishment's "quality assurance" — how it
guarantees atomic power plants are built safely
— had been "clouded" bv his experiences in
4' > months on the commission.
Justice doubts Allen crime
Washington — Justice Department attorneys
believe that despite "a lot of smoke," President
Ronald Reagan's national security adviser,
Richard Mien, did not act unlawfully when he
accepted $1000 after helping Japanese journal
ists obtain an interview with Mrs. Nancy Rea
gan, sources said yesterday.
The department sources, who asked not to be
named, said a preliminary investigation bv the
public integritv section has produced no evi
dence so far to warrant naming a special prose
cutor.
However, the sources added, the investiga
tion and review of the evidence has not been
completed. Thev said it would be "premature"
to announce whether a prosecutor would be
appointed.
Meantime, it was expected that the depart
ment make some official statement about the
case before the dav wasout, but probably not in
the way of announcing any final conclusions.
•\t the White House, Deputy Press Secretary
Larry Speakes told reporters that presidential
counselor Edwin Vteese received an oral report
on the Mien case on Nov. 6 from the FBI. Based
on that report, Meese decided there was no
need to take administrative action against Al
len, Speakes said.
CNP up despite recession
Washington — The economy grew rather
than shrank this summer, as first reported, the
government said yesterday. Nonetheless, econ
omists said thev are certain the nation is in a re
cession.
Revising preliminary figures that had in
dicated a downturn, the Commerce Depart
ment said in a new report that inflation-ad
justed gross national product rose at an annual
rate of 0.6 percent in the July-September quar
ter.
Commerce's preliminary report last month
said "real" GNP — the value of all the goods and
services the nation produces — had dropped at
an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the third quarter
after declining at a rate of 1.6 percent in the
spring quarter.
The transformation of a decline into a gain
was due almost entirely to a buildup in inven
tories, a clearly recessionary trend indicating
that manufacturers were having trouble selling
their goods.
In other words, U.S. businesses werestill turn
ing out new products and materials in the July-
September quarter, and all that production
counted in the GNP total. But sales were already
slipping and have now slipped much more, ac
cording to other government reports.
China/S. Africa deal denied
Washington — A State Department official
told senators today he does not agree with a
news report that China indirectly supplied en
riched uranium to South Africa.
The Washington Post said in yesterday's edi
tions that U.S. officials, who were not identified,
said the uranium was supplied through a Swiss
firm that served as a middleman to mask the
uranium's origin.
But James Malone, assistant secretary of state
for scientific affairs, said he does not agree with
the report, although he indicated his depart
ment is not sure of the source.
"We have no information the fuel being fab
ricated in France (for South Africa) came from
the Peoples Republic of China," Malone told

the Senate nuclear non-proliferation subcom
mittee at a hearing.
The uranium is expected to make it possible
for South Africa to start operating two 1000-
megawatt power plants without having to relv
on supplies from the United States, the news
paper said.
NLRB appointee dumped
Washington — In a deadlocked vote which
thwarted its own chairman and handed big la
bor a major political victory, a Senate commit
tee vesterday effectively dumped President
Ronald Reagan's nomination of John Van de
Water to head the National Labor Relations
Board.
Despite Chairman Orrin Hatch's declaration
that "the president. . . would feel very badly if I
am defeated on this nomination," the Senate
Labor Committee wound up in an 8-8 stalemate
on whether to recommend Van de Water, a 64-
\ ear-old Los Angeles lawver who has run a man
agement consulting firm for more than 30 vears.
The tie vote killed the motion.
A (litter Hatch pronounced the outcome
"purely political, inspired bv organized labor
and intended to embarrass the president."
In New York, AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland announced the result to cheering del
egates at the 'ederation's convention, saying he
now hopes Reagan "would have the good
sense" to ask Van de Water, already on board as
the interim chairman of the NLRB to step
down.
Reagan calms Jewish leaders
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, trying
to calm Jewish fears about his Mideast policy,
says he prefers to keep Jerusalem undivided un
der Israeli rule but also favors a "Vatican-like
solution" to preserve free access to the city's
holy sites.
The White House said, however, that Rea
lm's views about Israeli control did not reflect
official U.S. policy, which is for the future of Je
rusalem to be determined through nego
tiations.
The question came up during White House
meetings yesterday, when Reagan also prom
ise! J Jewish leaders to "do anything in this world
I can in this office to stamp out anti-Semitism
when it raises its head." The leaders were told
that only recently a White House staff member
was severely reprimanded fora bigoted remark.
A White House statement issued later ac
knowledged Reagan "said that he preferred for
Jerusalem to remain undivided under Israeli
sovereignty, but the president also said he fa
vored some type of a Vatican-like solution that
would continue to preserve the free access to
the holy sites that Israel has afforded since
1967."
That "does not reflect a change in United
States policy," the statement continued.
"American policy toward Jerusalem is that it
should remain undivided with free access to the
holy sites."
The State Department said only last week that
the status of the city "was a matter to be nego
tiated among the parties," and Reagan said
much the same thing as a candidate in Septem
ber 1980.
