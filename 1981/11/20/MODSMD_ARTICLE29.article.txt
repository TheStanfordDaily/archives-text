# BIG GAME! START ME UP & NEVER STOP!
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
In place of bowl game hopes sub
stitute season-long bitter frustration,
substitute low-down blues in place of
high-strung exuberance, in place of
fevered enthusiasm consider two
teams angrily defending their very
nice but very unsuccessful football
coaches.
When you throw in the axe, in all
its oak, bronze and tempered-steel
glory, what you have left tomorrow
afternoon is your basic fistfight and
perhaps one of the most intriguing
Big Games ever.
At Cal, the firing of a coach in mid
season, the anticipated firing of
much-loved and much-beleaguered

head coach Roger Theder, and an of
fensive attack that seems to be per
manantly undercover all combine to
make a 2-8 record and a group of very
mean athletes.
Two of the highest-scoring vic
tories in recent history for the
Cardinals in the last two games have
not quite taken away the hurt of near
misses against Purdue (19-27), Ohio
State (19-24) and USC (17-25), nor
have they wiped away the humil
iations of the San lose State (6-28) and
Arizona State games( 36-62).
Stanford's record-breaking half
back Damn Nelson, not one to get
caught-up in pre-game hysterics, no
ticed the danger signs developing as

early as Wednesday. "Some people
are beginning to get their game faces
on. They're starting to get irritable,"
he laughed.
Nelson's performance could be
the most intriguing thing to watch
tomorrow. It will be his final ap
pearance for the Cardinals, and he
still has some records to break. He
needs only 64 yards rushing to be
come the first player in NCAA history
to rush for 1000 yards and catch 60
passes in the sane season. His stats so
far are 936yardson 175carries,and61
pass re< eptions for 781 yards.
Stanford destroyed Oregon State
63-9 two weeks ago and Oregon 42-3
last weekend, scoring the most back
to-back points in 48 years, but right
next to the stats column is the season
record, which reads 3-7 overall and a
seventh place (3-4) Pacific-10 con
ference standing. It's the first losing
record for the Cardinals in 18 years
Stanford went 3-7 in 1963 under
coach John Ralston. On an optimistic
note, the Cards stunned Cal 25-3 that
year.
Ludicrous as it may seem, the
Cards' primary enemy at this point is
cockiness. Any assumption that their
offensive troubles are over and that
they are bound to score big points
probably won't wash. The big points
came against the two worst teams in
the conference, and though Cal is
right there with them record-wise
(2-8), the Bears rarely look like a

cellar-dwelling team at Big Game
time.
All things considered, coach Roger
Theder's Bears will probably come
into Stanford Stadium angrier; they
need a win over Stanford to avoid
their worst record in 19 years, the a
1-9 season in 1962. Eighth place in the
Pac-10 standings with a 2-5 con
ference record, they suffered a 19-0
shut-out at the hands of Washington
State last week, and have lost six of
their last seven contests. They have
only managed to generate three
points in their two games and picked
up only 178 yards of offense against
the Cougars on a very windy day.
Cal switched to new "Run and
Shoot" offense at the start of the sea
son under offensive coordinator
Mouse Davis. After a series of low
scoring losses, Davis was fired and
the Bears returned to their program
of last season just three short weeks
ago, all of which makes fora very
confused attack.
Junior quarterback ] Torchio leads
the blind. He's completed only 42.5
percent of his passes (136 of 320) for
1800 yards and seven TD's. Against
the Cougars last week he went 10-26
for 79 yards.
But Torchio is the man who rallied
Cal to a 21-28 victory in last year's Big
Game. After a 21-7 deficit at halftime
the Cards engineered a 21-21 tie with
7:14 remaining in the game. The
Cards were threatening to score

again at the Bears' three yardline but
a fumble by halfback Vincent White
gave Cal the ball with 4:14 left, and
Torchio scored the winning TD
himself on a bootleg run.
And Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin was careful not to under
estimate the Cal offensive potential.
"Last week wasn't an indication of
what they can do," he said. "A pass
oriented team can't execute what it
does best in 60 miles-per-hour winds.
They've combined the qualities of
the Run and Shoot and last year's of
fense, and proven it can be effective
against Arizona (14-13) and Oregon
State (45-3)."
Even with its maybe-maybe not

passing attack, Cal stands a good
chance of picking some healthy yard
age against the Cards. Torchio's fa
vorite receiver is slot-back Mariet
Ford, who has caught 42 passes for 2
TD's, and an average of 12.4 yards per
reception. Wide receivers Tyran
Wright and Floyd Eddings have great
names, but their stats don't measure
up. Both have 14 catches on the sea
son, Wright for 1 TD, Eddings for 3.
Running backs John Tuggle and
Carl Montgomery comprise a barely
respectable running attack. Tuggle
has 455 yards on 97 attempts for 4
TD's, and Montgomery has been fair
ly effective up close, with 386 yards
on 84 attempts for 5 TD's.

Darrin Nelson
In place of bowl game hopes sub
stitute season-long bitter frustration,
substitute low-down blues in place of
high-strung exuberance, in place of
fevered enthusiasm consider two
teams angrily defending their very
nice but very unsuccessful football
coaches.
When you throw in the axe, in all
its oak, bronze and tempered-steel
glory, what you have left tomorrow
afternoon is your basic fistfight and
perhaps one of the most intriguing
Big Games ever.
At Cal, the firing of a coach in mid
season, the anticipated firing of
much-loved and much-beleaguered

head coach Roger Theder, and an of
fensive attack that seems to be per
manantly undercover all combine to
make a 2-8 record and a group of very
mean athletes.
Two of the highest-scoring vic
tories in recent history for the
Cardinals in the last two games have
not quite taken away the hurt of near
misses against Purdue (19-27), Ohio
State (19-24) and USC (17-25), nor
have they wiped away the humil
iations of the San lose State (6-28) and
Arizona State games( 36-62).
Stanford's record-breaking half
back Damn Nelson, not one to get
caught-up in pre-game hysterics, no
ticed the danger signs developing as

early as Wednesday. "Some people
are beginning to get their game faces
on. They're starting to get irritable,"
he laughed.
Nelson's performance could be
the most intriguing thing to watch
tomorrow. It will be his final ap
pearance for the Cardinals, and he
still has some records to break. He
needs only 64 yards rushing to be
come the first player in NCAA history
to rush for 1000 yards and catch 60
passes in the sane season. His stats so
far are 936yardson 175carries,and61
pass re< eptions for 781 yards.
Stanford destroyed Oregon State
63-9 two weeks ago and Oregon 42-3
last weekend, scoring the most back
to-back points in 48 years, but right
next to the stats column is the season
record, which reads 3-7 overall and a
seventh place (3-4) Pacific-10 con
ference standing. It's the first losing
record for the Cardinals in 18 years
Stanford went 3-7 in 1963 under
coach John Ralston. On an optimistic
note, the Cards stunned Cal 25-3 that
year.
Ludicrous as it may seem, the
Cards' primary enemy at this point is
cockiness. Any assumption that their
offensive troubles are over and that
they are bound to score big points
probably won't wash. The big points
came against the two worst teams in
the conference, and though Cal is
right there with them record-wise
(2-8), the Bears rarely look like a

cellar-dwelling team at Big Game
time.
All things considered, coach Roger
Theder's Bears will probably come
into Stanford Stadium angrier; they
need a win over Stanford to avoid
their worst record in 19 years, the a
1-9 season in 1962. Eighth place in the
Pac-10 standings with a 2-5 con
ference record, they suffered a 19-0
shut-out at the hands of Washington
State last week, and have lost six of
their last seven contests. They have
only managed to generate three
points in their two games and picked
up only 178 yards of offense against
the Cougars on a very windy day.
Cal switched to new "Run and
Shoot" offense at the start of the sea
son under offensive coordinator
Mouse Davis. After a series of low
scoring losses, Davis was fired and
the Bears returned to their program
of last season just three short weeks
ago, all of which makes fora very
confused attack.
Junior quarterback ] Torchio leads
the blind. He's completed only 42.5
percent of his passes (136 of 320) for
1800 yards and seven TD's. Against
the Cougars last week he went 10-26
for 79 yards.
But Torchio is the man who rallied
Cal to a 21-28 victory in last year's Big
Game. After a 21-7 deficit at halftime
the Cards engineered a 21-21 tie with
7:14 remaining in the game. The
Cards were threatening to score

again at the Bears' three yardline but
a fumble by halfback Vincent White
gave Cal the ball with 4:14 left, and
Torchio scored the winning TD
himself on a bootleg run.
And Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin was careful not to under
estimate the Cal offensive potential.
"Last week wasn't an indication of
what they can do," he said. "A pass
oriented team can't execute what it
does best in 60 miles-per-hour winds.
They've combined the qualities of
the Run and Shoot and last year's of
fense, and proven it can be effective
against Arizona (14-13) and Oregon
State (45-3)."
Even with its maybe-maybe not

passing attack, Cal stands a good
chance of picking some healthy yard
age against the Cards. Torchio's fa
vorite receiver is slot-back Mariet
Ford, who has caught 42 passes for 2
TD's, and an average of 12.4 yards per
reception. Wide receivers Tyran
Wright and Floyd Eddings have great
names, but their stats don't measure
up. Both have 14 catches on the sea
son, Wright for 1 TD, Eddings for 3.
Running backs John Tuggle and
Carl Montgomery comprise a barely
respectable running attack. Tuggle
has 455 yards on 97 attempts for 4
TD's, and Montgomery has been fair
ly effective up close, with 386 yards
on 84 attempts for 5 TD's.
