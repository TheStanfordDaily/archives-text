## 
### 
Approximately 35 of the people
who signed lists to help with vari
ous projects concerning rape pre
vention met yesterday in the
Women's Center to discuss plan
ning and organization.
Proposals to be worked on in
clude: a martial arts club; a com
mittee to work with the University
administration; a plan to work
with the police and with Students
United for Rape Elimination
(SURE); a booklet on rape; a
poster on rascism and sexism; a
men's group on men and society;
a "dorm outreach" program; a
series on "Women and Vio
lence"; and an ad hoc committee
to discuss pornography in the Dai

The participants agreed that
one of their chief goals is to get as
many people involved as possible
and to get a larger segment of the
Stanford community to take re
sponsiblity for rape prevention.
