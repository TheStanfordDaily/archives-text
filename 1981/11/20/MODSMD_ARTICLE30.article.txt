## What's this Big Game nonsense? Cards, Bears no big deal 
### 
Stanford and the University of California have been
taking the symbolic "axe" to one another in football
since 1892 — tomorrow's 1 p.in. kickoff marking the 84th
meeting between the schools — and yet after 89 years,
the total point differential between the two teams is 10.
Stanford, which leads the series 39-34-10, has rolled up
1120 points on the Bears. Cal trails with 1110.
Maybe that is what possesed Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin to rise up before the unbelieving Bay Area media
at Monday's press luncheon and assure one and all that
"This IS the Big Game." This is, obliged his record setting
halfback Darrin Nelson, "Our bowl game."
This is also — for those of us deranged enough to be
sensible — 3-7 Stanford vs. 2-8 Cal. This is, a local wag
cracked a month back, one game "neither team can
win."
But that's not the point, argues my friend Roomie,
"the Big game," he says, "has nothing to do with foot
ball." Perhaps, but this is the same guy w ho's been insist
ing for weeks that "There IS precedence fora sub-.500
team (translation: a losing team like Stanford) to go to a
bowl game." WHAT precedence? "Texas A&M, a couple
of years ago." I wish I knew what he was talking about.

Once a Stanford fan, always. . .
Like all great rivalries, Stanford-Cal features the best in
big league breast-beating. Vou get the obligatory pre
game nonsense from all angles and often all at once.
Let's take the visitors' side first. If you talk to Cal
groupies about the game, they will tell you that not only
do the Bears always rise to the occasion against Stanford
(having put the Cards away the last two years), but also
that the plavers wil be especially ready tomorrow since
they know Roger Theder's job is on the line.
But the Bears have been down this track before. Last
year, Cal was also 2-8 coming into Big Game and Theder
was again just one game away from becoming a trivia an
swer. Though Cal's emotional 28-23 victory over the
Cards earned Theder one more autumn in Berkeley,
nothing can save the embattled coach now. Uneasy rests
the headset — especially when your career record is
17-27 and you have Glen Dickey, that most determined
of hatchetmen, after your hide.
Tomorrow's game will be Theder's last as a Bear coach;
and if his players are unaware of that, they may be the
only ones. Theder's job is, in short, not on the line. It's
gone. Cal officials are holding formal interviews for the

position and the new coach could be announced as soon
as next week. To recruit, after all, you must have a coach.
The logical successor to Theder? How about San Jose
State's Jack Elway (that's right, John's father) whose un
derrated Spartans smothered Stanford and Cal back-to
back in September.
Stanford supporters couldn't care less about the Bears'
state of mind. As far as they are concerned, the Cards are
peaking now and fully capable of flattening the most
fired-up Cal team. Over the past two weeks they will tell
you, they have scored 105 points to the Bears' three. The
Cardinals, furthermore, are strongest in the fourth quar
ter, where, coincidentally, Cal is weakest.
Stanford, they'll say, is a far better team than its 3-7 rec
ord indicates. If only the Cards had stopped making
those "costly mistakes" earlier . . . Cal, on the other
hand, is every bit as bad as its 2-8 mark. The party line says
that if Stanford marches down the field on its first
possession the Bears will look fora place to hibernate.
Glen Dickey, ever the circling vulture, is openly predict
ing a Stanford rout.
Don't be swayed by this gibberish either. Stanford has
played like a 3-7 club this season — no better, no worse.

Good teams don't make the kind of mistakes the Cards
have made incessantly this autumn. Stanford s pass de
fense (61 percent completions allowed, 2099 yards and 16
touchdowns) has been invisible, and the offensive line
spotty. While the loss of talented wide receiver Andre
Fvler (foot fracture) hurt, one injury does not turn a pre
season top-twenty pick into a 3-7 wreck.
Poo-poo Stanford's fourth quarter prowess. The
Cardinals .i' • garbage-time specialists, exploding their
cannons ,v: ' 'fie opposition has safely salted the game
away. Stanford s recent triple-digit scoring binge came at
the expense ot Oregon State and Oregon very possi
bly the two worst teams this side of Northwestern.
If Stanford does come through and mash Cal tomor
row, the Cards will finish the season on a deceiving
three-game tear (deceiving because it will have been
acheived against bad teams) and the athletic department
and local media will immediately start bragging about
next year. Be wary. Stanford did not show the character
of a winning team this fall and such character cannot be
gauged against also rans.

bowl game." WHAT precedence? "Texas A&M, a couple
of years ago." I wish I knew what he was talking about.

Once a Stanford fan, always. . .
Like all great rivalries, Stanford-Cal features the best in
big league breast-beating. Vou get the obligatory pre
game nonsense from all angles and often all at once.
Let's take the visitors' side first. If you talk to Cal
groupies about the game, they will tell you that not only
do the Bears always rise to the occasion against Stanford
(having put the Cards away the last two years), but also
that the plavers wil be especially ready tomorrow since
they know Roger Theder's job is on the line.
But the Bears have been down this track before. Last
year, Cal was also 2-8 coming into Big Game and Theder
was again just one game away from becoming a trivia an
swer. Though Cal's emotional 28-23 victory over the
Cards earned Theder one more autumn in Berkeley,
nothing can save the embattled coach now. Uneasy rests
the headset — especially when your career record is
17-27 and you have Glen Dickey, that most determined
of hatchetmen, after your hide.
Tomorrow's game will be Theder's last as a Bear coach;
and if his players are unaware of that, they may be the
only ones. Theder's job is, in short, not on the line. It's
gone. Cal officials are holding formal interviews for the

position and the new coach could be announced as soon
as next week. To recruit, after all, you must have a coach.
The logical successor to Theder? How about San Jose
State's Jack Elway (that's right, John's father) whose un
derrated Spartans smothered Stanford and Cal back-to
back in September.
Stanford supporters couldn't care less about the Bears'
state of mind. As far as they are concerned, the Cards are
peaking now and fully capable of flattening the most
fired-up Cal team. Over the past two weeks they will tell
you, they have scored 105 points to the Bears' three. The
Cardinals, furthermore, are strongest in the fourth quar
ter, where, coincidentally, Cal is weakest.
Stanford, they'll say, is a far better team than its 3-7 rec
ord indicates. If only the Cards had stopped making
those "costly mistakes" earlier . . . Cal, on the other
hand, is every bit as bad as its 2-8 mark. The party line says
that if Stanford marches down the field on its first
possession the Bears will look fora place to hibernate.
Glen Dickey, ever the circling vulture, is openly predict
ing a Stanford rout.
Don't be swayed by this gibberish either. Stanford has
played like a 3-7 club this season — no better, no worse.

Good teams don't make the kind of mistakes the Cards
have made incessantly this autumn. Stanford s pass de
fense (61 percent completions allowed, 2099 yards and 16
touchdowns) has been invisible, and the offensive line
spotty. While the loss of talented wide receiver Andre
Fvler (foot fracture) hurt, one injury does not turn a pre
season top-twenty pick into a 3-7 wreck.
Poo-poo Stanford's fourth quarter prowess. The
Cardinals .i' • garbage-time specialists, exploding their
cannons ,v: ' 'fie opposition has safely salted the game
away. Stanford s recent triple-digit scoring binge came at
the expense ot Oregon State and Oregon very possi
bly the two worst teams this side of Northwestern.
If Stanford does come through and mash Cal tomor
row, the Cards will finish the season on a deceiving
three-game tear (deceiving because it will have been
acheived against bad teams) and the athletic department
and local media will immediately start bragging about
next year. Be wary. Stanford did not show the character
of a winning team this fall and such character cannot be
gauged against also rans.
Stanford and the University of California have been
taking the symbolic "axe" to one another in football
since 1892 — tomorrow's 1 p.in. kickoff marking the 84th
meeting between the schools — and yet after 89 years,
the total point differential between the two teams is 10.
Stanford, which leads the series 39-34-10, has rolled up
1120 points on the Bears. Cal trails with 1110.
Maybe that is what possesed Stanford head coach Paul
Wiggin to rise up before the unbelieving Bay Area media
at Monday's press luncheon and assure one and all that
"This IS the Big Game." This is, obliged his record setting
halfback Darrin Nelson, "Our bowl game."
This is also — for those of us deranged enough to be
sensible — 3-7 Stanford vs. 2-8 Cal. This is, a local wag
cracked a month back, one game "neither team can
win."
But that's not the point, argues my friend Roomie,
"the Big game," he says, "has nothing to do with foot
ball." Perhaps, but this is the same guy w ho's been insist
ing for weeks that "There IS precedence fora sub-.500
team (translation: a losing team like Stanford) to go to a
bowl game." WHAT precedence? "Texas A&M, a couple
