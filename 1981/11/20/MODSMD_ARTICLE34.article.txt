# The 						Big Splash: Stanford tankers take on Bears
## 
### Chris Addington 
"Playing water polo at Stan
ford is a little like Fear and
Loathing. Vou hate the work
outs but you like winning
games."
So remarked Stanford senior
Bill Taylor about his four-year
career on the Farm. Whether
Hunter Thompson ever played
water polo is not known, but
one thing is for sure, Stanford
plays the sport and plays it well.
Tomorrow's match against
the UC-Berkeley Bears is Stan
ford's last regular season game
of the year. This game also
marks the last home ap
pearance of a squad of seniors
who have brought glory and
prestige to Stanford water
polo.
i Appearing for the last time at
deGuerre Pool in the "Big
Splash" will be Taylor, Brian
Felix, Vince Vanelli, All-Ameri
cas Chris Kelsey and Alan
Mouchawar and All-America,
Olympic Team member Jody
Campbell.
During these last four sea
sons, these six seniors have
guided the Stanford team to
some of the most impressive
statistics in the sport of water
polo and the entire NCAA.
Since 1978, Stanford has a
record of 104-8-3 fora 93 per
cent win ratio. The Cardinal has
captured two NCAA titles, one
third place finish and three Pa
cific-10 Conference crowns.
In addition to these stats,
Stanford has only lost one
game in the last 50 outings and
it is on the verge of breaking
the NCAA record for con

secutive wins at 30. A victory
against the Bears will give them
the magic total of 31.
And a Stanford victory
tomorrow seems highly proba
ble. Stanford has defeated Cal
twice this year by scores of 13-4
dnd 11-7, the last victory occur
ing where Berkeley is most
ferocious, in their own pool.
"Other teams have been
scoring almost 70 percent of
their goals when we are a man
down," head coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "We really need
to tighten up our man-down
defense. It's our only problem
area."
In last week's game against
Berkeley, the Bears scored five
of their seven goals on the
man-up.
Cal is currently ranked N0.6
in the nation with an overall
record of 17-10. The Bears are
only a shadow of their former
glory years in the 70s, but the
game still promises to be a
good one.
"This will be a good game, it
always is," said Dettamanti,
"and it's the last chance to see
our seniors play."
Stanford is currently 27-0 for
the year with a 5-0 record in the
Pac-10. The Cardinal Red holds
a scoring edge over its oppo
nents of 355-143, or almost
2.5-1. Despite the play of the
man-down defense, Stanford is
holding opponents to under
six goals per game.
After tomorrow's match,
Stanford will have a week
before it travels to the NCAA
Nationals Championships held
at Long Beach Nov. 28-29.
