# Spikers foil Spartans in 3 games
## 
### Lisa Stern 
The Stanford spikers took some re
taliatory action Wednesday night as the
squad frustrated and finally crushed a
bewildered San Jose State team on the
Spartans' home court, 15-6,15-12,15-4.
After last week's disappointing loss to
league rival University of the Pacific, the
victory marked Stanford's 13th match win
of the year. The Cardinals, who are ranked
fifth nationally this week, retain their sec
ond place standing in the Northern Cali
fornia Athletic Conference with a 9-2 rec
ord. They trail only UOP, which, after last
week's game with Stanford, clinched its
third conference championship in as many
years.
The Cards play their final regular season
match tonight against Fresno State Univer
sity.
In the first game of the SJS match, Stan
ford jumped off to a quick 6-1 lead. The
Spartans gained momentum in the next
serving series, however, by establishing a
five point scoring string to steady out the
game at 6-6. Then the Cards, led by the ser
vice of sophomore Margaret Grove, com
piled nine unanswered points to take a 1-0

advantage in games.
The second game became a demonstra
tion of Stanford's superiority in experience
and drive as the Cardinal spikers came
back from a 10-2 deficit to win the contest.
The Spartans match-plan fell apart at the
mid-way point in the game and the team
could score only two additional points in
the 15-12 loss.
The Cards then went on to dominate
their frustrated opponents in the third
game by allowing the Spartans only four
total points. Stanford prevailed 15-4 to
sweep the match in three straight games.
"We just took the wind out of their sails
in the second game," Cardinal head coach
Fred Sturm said.
Sturm added that he was concerned
before the match that his team might ex
perience a let down, but was pleased with
his spikers' performance as a whole in the
end.
"It was our most consistent effort in the
area of preventing points scored we have
had this season," he said, "and I think that
our quality of play was determined by San
Jose. They really came out hotter than a
firecracker and we knew that we needed

to play well as a result."
Seniors Jan Linden and Chris Anderson
provided the needed strength and ex
perience to lead Stanford's decisive come
back in the second game of the match.
Anderson, an outside hitter, was last
week's choice for NorCal player-of-the
week, an honor she has won twice this sea
son. She is currently rated second in the
league in hitting with a .361 percentage,
trailing only her leammate Deanna
Boyette.
"I think definitely that one of the most
important differences in the match was
that San Jose didn't have a player the
caliber of a Jan or Chris," Sturm said.
The Cardinals play Fresno St. tonight at
7:30 p.m. at Fresno in their their final con
ference game of the season. The Lady Bull
dogs, rated fifth in the league with a 5-6
rec>. H, show great strength on their home
court.
"Fresno St. is not nearly as successful on
the road," Sturin said. "However, they
have had big upsets at home. They really
react like a different team when they play
in Fresno, so the match should be a good
test for us.
