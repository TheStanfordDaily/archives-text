# Lakers' Westhead fired

Los Angeles (AP) â€” Los Angeles Lakers Coach
Paul Westhead, who was blasted Wednesday
night by star Earvin "Magic" Johnson, was fired
yesterday by team owner Jerry Buss.
Buss named former coach and star player Jerry
West to head the offense for the Lakers, with a
co-coach, Pat Riley, handling the defense in a
unique National Basketball Association situ
ation.
Buss claimed the outburst of the 22-year-old
Johnson had nothing to do with his decision.
"Obviously it was a difficult decision for us.
There is no way to criticize anybody. I was disap
pointed in not seeing an exciting team once
again. This started after the first or second
game."
Buss, whose team won the NBA title in 1980,
with Johnson the catalyst, said the latter's out
burst was unfortunate in its timing.
This summer, Buss signed Johnson to a $1 mil
lion per year contract, starting in the 1984-85 sea
son. After his playing days, he would become
part of the millionaire Buss' organization. Buss

also had signed Westhead to a four-year con
tract in 1980 and said he would live up to the
terms of the agreement.
"He and I separated on good terms," the
Lakers' owner said. "I will live up to all contracts
I have signed."
He also indicated that Westhead might have a
job in the various Buss enterprises.
The owner said that West, an All-Star guard
who coached the Lakers for three years starting
in 1976, would be in complete charge of the of
fense.
"I think Pat and Jerry have to sit down and de
cide what their relative responsibilities are,"
Buss said.
The owner said he talked to Johnson yester
day, but it had nothing to do with his outburst in
Salt Lake City, when the player said, "I can't play
here anymore. I want to leave. I want to be
traded." He was not specific on his differences
with Westhead, but the 6-foot-9 Johnson ob
viously was unhappy with the offense used by
the club this year.
