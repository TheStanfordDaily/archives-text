# Marenzi, Brandt add polish
## KZSU sports coverageimproved 
### Nick Gault 
Those who have tuned in
to KZSU's coverage of Stan
ford football over the years
know that the current
broadcasting tandem of
Gary Marenzi and Andy
Brandt is the best in some
time.
The broadcasts had suf
fered the past few seasons
from a lack of interest and
talent and hit rock bottom
in 1980. KZSU then asked
Marenzi, an MBA student
here, to assume the position
of Sports Director, a post he
held as an undergraduate in
1977 and '78, when he also
called the games for the
campus radio station. He ac
cepted, and an upgrade in
the calibre of broadcasts
quickly followed.
Coors Breweries and
McDonald's Hamburgers
offered to underwrite the
broadcasts and the station
no longer found themselves

having to cut corners in
critical areas. Together,
Marenzi and Brandt aimed
for — and achieved — a
more polished delivery than
their predecessors had been
known for.
Still, few listeners would
go so far as to say that the
broadcasters are of pro
fessional quality. Marenzi
and Brandt are, after all, stu
dents and they are not paid
for their efforts. Anyone
who has tried it will tell you
that sports broadcasting is
one of the hardest jobs in
the communications busi
ness. The "guys in the
booth" have to talk interest
ingly for three straight
hours, action or time outs
regardless. The fact that
KZSU has no commercial
breaks makes it all the more
difficult for Marenzi and
Brandt.
But the attraction of the
KZSU football broadcasts to

Stanford fans has little to do
with how professional the
commentators are. It is what
Marenzi calls "the student
voice"that makes us want to
listen — these are people
we know, who know the
players we know. The Stan
ford community has an in
timate relationship with
Cardinal football and
Marenzi and Brandt are one
of the reasons.
Marenzi is the stronger of
the two announcers. His
mellifluous voice, uncom
mon in college radio, and
easy elocution put him on
par with Jack Allen as two of
the finest native Stanford
broadcasters in recent
memory. Marenzi would
like to pursue announcing
as a weekend hobby when
he finishes business school,
or, if not, some other kind of
work in the broadcasting in
dustry. He had work ex
perience this summer with

the HBO cable network in
New York.
Brandt has become a most
capableannouncer also, but
he is not in the same class as
Marenzi. Though always
well-informed, and certain
ly never at a loss for words,
he lacks some of the ex
perience Marenzi has had,
which shows in a relative
lack of polish and savvy.
Brandt plans to pursue an
nouncing as a career.
Covering the Cardinals,
both home and away, has
been a great experience for
both announcers.
"I've been living out a
fantasy for years," Marenzi
said, "and I am really happy
to have had the opportuni
ty."
Brandt said, "The road
trips, especially, have been a
blast. Even the cheap hotels
and sleazy bars have been a
lot of fun."
