# Senators dodge aid request
## 
### Heather Millar 
Aides of U.S. Senators Alan
Cranston and S.I. Hayakawa said yes
terday it is too early to predict wheth
er they vvitl honor University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's formal op
position to proposed cuts in student
aid programs.
Kennedy last Wednesday sent both
senatorsa telegram opposing aid cuts
proposed in a Labor-Human Health
Services-Education bill recently re
ported by the Senate Appropriations
Committee.
If the bill passes, it would "zero
fund" the State Student Incentive
Grant (SSIG) and reduce the buying
power of the federal Supplemental
Educational Opportunity (SEOC)
program by an estimated 27 percent.
In California the SSIG provides 13.5
percent of the Cal Grant scholarship
funds, which aids thousands of Cali

fornia residents by supplementing
tuition costs by up to $3200 a year.
The SEOG is a federal program which
appropriates funds to students on the
basis of n*Â»ed. If the SSIG money were
cut off and the SEOG money re
duced, as many as 340 Stanford stu
dents would be affected, said Ken
nedy.
According toa spokesman for Hay
akawa, the bill should reach the Sen
ate floor by next week or the week af
ter Thanksgiving at the latest.
In his telegram, Kennedy's de
scribed the funding levels proposed
by the bill "grossly inadequate."
Kennedy expressed particular con
cern over the 1982 fiscal year fund
ing. University officers have already
called fora 2 percent budget con
servation effort in the face of a
projected deficit of $2.8 million in
general funds for the 1982-83 aca
demic year. If students lost the sup

port from SSIG and SEOG programs,
the University would have to in
crease its scholarship offers, which
would force the University to take
money from its already depleted
store of general funds.
"I urge vour support of any floor
amendment(s) restoring funds cut by
the Committee in these and other
student aid programs," said Kennedy
in conclusion.
According to an aide, Cranston has
"been supportive of proposals in the
past that add money to educational
funds."
A representative for Hayakawa said
the senator supported HR3982 which
included both the SSIG and SEOG
funds as part of the 1982-83 budget,
and also said Hayakawa believes that
lower income grant programs should
be among the federal government's
primary commitments to higher
education.
