THE BAY WINDOW RESTAURANT
1026 Alma
Menlo Park
326-6666
After a yearof waitressing in a local
restaurant, I vowed I'd never be on that side
of the table again. Imagine my amazement
when I discovered a restaurant where the
staff actually volunteer their time to work
sans the server's only recompense: the tip.
Vet, our service at the Bay Window
Restaurant was neither too stuffy nor too
familiar, but graciously tailored to the
informal atmosphere.
This atmosphere isthe diner's initial
invitation to the Bay Window. From the
street, the building resembles a cottage with
the bay window revealing a quaint and
warmly lit parlor within. The entrance is a
back dooropening intoa courtyard where
patrons may dine, weather permitting. Two
intimate dining areas, the Bay Window and
Shallett rooms, divide the inside and preserve
the home-like atmosphere with rustic
printed wallpaper hung with nondescript
paintings, a scattering of wall and parlor
lamps, a wooden sideboard for the coffee
pots, and many wooden booths and small
tables.
The restaurant is a study in the art of
compromise, forthere are no tableclothson
theformica tabletops,cloth napkinsarelaid
on paper placemats, and each petit vase holds
a sprig of baby's breath and a spray of cloth
flowers. The quaintness may be a little trite,
but the decor displays an artful combination
of practicality and charm, giving the Bay
Window a pleasant congeniality.
A versatile menu belies the limited capacity
of a small restaurant and offers a good
representation of dishes, including veal,
chicken, meat and fish. And though on the
expensive side, the food is well-prepared and
satisfying. Specials are featured every night
(we were offered Petrale Sole Almondine and
Veal Piccata), and innovations include a
"slimmer' plate and a vegetarian dish, both of
which vary nightly (Chicken Dijon and a
mushroom omelette were our options).
There are no appetizers, but dinner
includes soup or salad and a delicious demi
loaf of wonderfully soft, steaming bread. We
favored the minestrone soup, a nicely
seasoned broth full of' Vegetables and beans,
over the salad. Although neither of us cared
for the very sweet honey-poppyseed dressing
(one of three choices) on the uninspired
salad of lettuceand croutons, honey lovers
might be moreenthused.
My excellent Chicken Divan, a regular on
the menu, is highly recommended: chunks of

chicken breast in a creamy white wine and
cheese sauce, garnished with broccoli spears.
The sauce was exquisitely seasoned and both
the chicken and the broccoli were cooked to
perfection. My companion's Steak au Poivre
was less impressive; tender slices of lean steak
smothered in mushrooms and shallots in a
red wine sauce sounds delicious, but the
compromise between spicy hot bits of
peppercorn and bland sauce made the dish
rather disappointing. A savory rice pilaf and a
medley of cooked cabbage and carrots
accompanied the main courses. The portions
would neither stuff nor starve, and I was
actually pleased by the fact that the plates
were not pretentiously piled with food that
would only go to waste.
I had room for dessert (which I rarely do),
and I immensely enjoyed the pecan pie a la
mode. The pie filling was smooth and nutty
and not too sweet. My companion's
gorgeous Torte Almaretto was a dark, heavy
chocolate torte shell filled with thickly
whipped cream flavored with amaretto.
For such an unassuming restaurant, the
wine list was a delightful surprise, offering an
admirable selection of California wines at
reasonable prices. We began with a half
carafe of the house chablis by Summit, which
was light and innocuous — fine for those
wary of wines and house wines. Fora house
selection, I found it pleasant without that
"tarnished" taste so common to inexpensive
or bulk wines. With dinner came an iced
bottle of Kenwood Dry Chenin Blanc, which
complemented my chicken quite well. With a
full, aromatic bouquet, the distinct flavor was
dry and almost spicy, with a hint of a bite.
Although our evening meal at the Bay
Window was flawlessly pleasant, we thought
the bill was rather high at $37 (the wine came
to $11). Yes, tips are tax deductible. Except for
the kitchen personnel, an all-volunteer staff
donates all tips to the Bay Window Auxiliary
of the Family Service Association. This non
profit organization provides professional
counseling services in the local community
for family-related and personal problems.
They operatesuch programs as the Parental
Stress Hotline and the Foster Home.
So, if you're feelinga bit extravagant and
are looking for philanthropy and a cozy
restaurant near campus, the Bay Window is a
unique place todine. Much of theambience
may stem from the fact that only four parties
were in our company that night, fora full
house could conceivably dispel the quiet
atmosphere. However, it is wise to call for
reservations, since our first attempt had to be
postponed because they ran out of food!

was less impressive; tender slices of lean steak
smothered in mushrooms and shallots in a
red wine sauce sounds delicious, but the
compromise between spicy hot bits of
peppercorn and bland sauce made the dish
rather disappointing. A savory rice pilaf and a
medley of cooked cabbage and carrots
accompanied the main courses. The portions
would neither stuff nor starve, and I was
actually pleased by the fact that the plates
were not pretentiously piled with food that
would only go to waste.
I had room for dessert (which I rarely do),
and I immensely enjoyed the pecan pie a la
mode. The pie filling was smooth and nutty
and not too sweet. My companion's
gorgeous Torte Almaretto was a dark, heavy
chocolate torte shell filled with thickly
whipped cream flavored with amaretto.
For such an unassuming restaurant, the
wine list was a delightful surprise, offering an
admirable selection of California wines at
reasonable prices. We began with a half
carafe of the house chablis by Summit, which
was light and innocuous — fine for those
wary of wines and house wines. Fora house
selection, I found it pleasant without that
"tarnished" taste so common to inexpensive
or bulk wines. With dinner came an iced
bottle of Kenwood Dry Chenin Blanc, which
complemented my chicken quite well. With a
full, aromatic bouquet, the distinct flavor was
dry and almost spicy, with a hint of a bite.
Although our evening meal at the Bay
Window was flawlessly pleasant, we thought
the bill was rather high at $37 (the wine came
to $11). Yes, tips are tax deductible. Except for
the kitchen personnel, an all-volunteer staff
donates all tips to the Bay Window Auxiliary
of the Family Service Association. This non
profit organization provides professional
counseling services in the local community
for family-related and personal problems.
They operatesuch programs as the Parental
Stress Hotline and the Foster Home.
So, if you're feelinga bit extravagant and
are looking for philanthropy and a cozy
restaurant near campus, the Bay Window is a
unique place todine. Much of theambience
may stem from the fact that only four parties
were in our company that night, fora full
house could conceivably dispel the quiet
atmosphere. However, it is wise to call for
reservations, since our first attempt had to be
postponed because they ran out of food!

THE BAY WINDOW RESTAURANT
1026 Alma
Menlo Park
326-6666
After a yearof waitressing in a local
restaurant, I vowed I'd never be on that side
of the table again. Imagine my amazement
when I discovered a restaurant where the
staff actually volunteer their time to work
sans the server's only recompense: the tip.
Vet, our service at the Bay Window
Restaurant was neither too stuffy nor too
familiar, but graciously tailored to the
informal atmosphere.
This atmosphere isthe diner's initial
invitation to the Bay Window. From the
street, the building resembles a cottage with
the bay window revealing a quaint and
warmly lit parlor within. The entrance is a
back dooropening intoa courtyard where
patrons may dine, weather permitting. Two
intimate dining areas, the Bay Window and
Shallett rooms, divide the inside and preserve
the home-like atmosphere with rustic
printed wallpaper hung with nondescript
paintings, a scattering of wall and parlor
lamps, a wooden sideboard for the coffee
pots, and many wooden booths and small
tables.
The restaurant is a study in the art of
compromise, forthere are no tableclothson
theformica tabletops,cloth napkinsarelaid
on paper placemats, and each petit vase holds
a sprig of baby's breath and a spray of cloth
flowers. The quaintness may be a little trite,
but the decor displays an artful combination
of practicality and charm, giving the Bay
Window a pleasant congeniality.
A versatile menu belies the limited capacity
of a small restaurant and offers a good
representation of dishes, including veal,
chicken, meat and fish. And though on the
expensive side, the food is well-prepared and
satisfying. Specials are featured every night
(we were offered Petrale Sole Almondine and
Veal Piccata), and innovations include a
"slimmer' plate and a vegetarian dish, both of
which vary nightly (Chicken Dijon and a
mushroom omelette were our options).
There are no appetizers, but dinner
includes soup or salad and a delicious demi
loaf of wonderfully soft, steaming bread. We
favored the minestrone soup, a nicely
seasoned broth full of' Vegetables and beans,
over the salad. Although neither of us cared
for the very sweet honey-poppyseed dressing
(one of three choices) on the uninspired
salad of lettuceand croutons, honey lovers
might be moreenthused.
My excellent Chicken Divan, a regular on
the menu, is highly recommended: chunks of

chicken breast in a creamy white wine and
cheese sauce, garnished with broccoli spears.
The sauce was exquisitely seasoned and both
the chicken and the broccoli were cooked to
perfection. My companion's Steak au Poivre

red wine sauce sounds delicious, but the
