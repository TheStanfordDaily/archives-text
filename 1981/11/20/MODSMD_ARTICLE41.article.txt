Each year around St. Paddy's Day when
the green-tinted batch ot greetings hits the
card shop shelves, this little ditty always
seems to make the rounds: "What's the
definition of an Irish seven-course meal?"
"A six-pack and a baked potato." Now
with a name like O'Connell and freckles
which some say map out the shortest route
from fair Dublin to the shores of Galway
Bay, you can be sure I've heard that one a
few times. But with the help of an Atherton
restaurant offering the kind of food my
grannies, Kitty Fitzgerald and Gert Ryan,
used to make, I'm prepared to dispel that
bit o' blarney.
As Clivedenites and anyone who's ever
attempted culinary adventures in the grills
and pubs of Ireland will attest, Irish food is

not exactly haute cuisine. In fact, it gener
ally runs toward the bland and heavy side
with potatoes at every possible occasion.
However, Maloney's has succeeded in
presenting only the most traditional (and
probably the best) of Irish treats, as well as
a good selection of Italian dishes and some
very tasty chicken and steak combinations.
Right off the top you can treat yourself
to a cocktail from a bar sure to bring the
mist to any Irishman's eye, featuring some
of those proud whiskeys like Jameson's,
Paddy's and Tullamore Dew. Or you might
want to down a few jars of Harp Lager —
it's imported, needless to say. After a cou
ple of pints, the softball team trophies
which line the counters and the nau
gahvde high-backed booths will seem
more charming. It's a rather curious set
up, mind you, and not the place to go for
your pre-formal splurge or post-gradu
ation milk-the-folks bash, but it is ideal for
medium-sized dinner parties among very
good friends. And on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday nights, Maloney's features music

after 9 p.m.
The three main Irish dishes on the menu
are Irish stew, country corned beef and
cabbage, and Bunratty cottage pot roast.
All are in the $7.50 range, and include soup
or salad, Irish brown bread and coffee.
However, Maloney's also serves delicious
veal dishes, canneloni, chicken cordon
bleu, rack of lamb, seafood and steaks, to
name only a few non-Irish options, rang
ing from about $7.50 to $12.95.
Now, this may cause me problems
around the 17th of March, but I must admit
that I opted for the veal piccata — an ex
tremely tender offering sauteed in butter,

lemon, capers and parsley. The lemon was
a bit stronger than I can remember in veal
piccata, but I enjoyed that tartness.
My dinner partner — we'll call him
O'Toole (the O'Tooles are like the John
Smiths of Ireland. . On second thought,
though, we should probably call him
O'Toolewitz just so you don't think this is a
totally biased review) — went for the Irish
stew. He liked it, but my taste led me to be
lieve it was about the best Irish stew I'd
ever tried, and was served piping hot from
a little iron stewpot with the requisite ra
tion of boiled potatoes and carrots.
As it turned out, I was lucky to have
O'Toolewitz with me, for he claims to
make the best chicken liver pate in the
world. In a dubious decision which I doubt
would be deemed ducky in Donegal,
Maloney's serves a chicken liver pate ap
petizer with all dinners. To critique this, I
had to defer to my partner who said it was
"not bad at all"; and considering that this
comment came from the pate king of
South Bend,lndiana, it was quite a compl i -
ment.
My one disappointment with the meal
came with the Irish brown bread. Once
you've had true Irish bread,yourstandards
are pretty high, and I'm afraid that
Maloney's just didn't make it with me;

though warm, it was too doughy and
larked that Irish soda flavor.
Before I tell you about "Durty Nelly's
Irish Coffee — a tribute to the auld girl and
her pub in County Clare," let me provide
an explanation of the origins of Irish coffee
as told to me by a bus driver named Dan
Ryan from County Mayo. Although tour-

ists and even some of the natives like to
trace Irish coffee back to the Celtic days
when druids and leprechauns really did
have the right-of-way, Dan said the con
coction had its true beginnings in the
Shannon airport about 40 years ago.
It seems that travelers stopping off in
Shannon on their way to America, or
changing planes on their way to the conti
nent or England, would come bounding
into the airport pub demanding drinks to
knock down and warm them up before the
next plane left. One night when the bar
tender, likely an O'Toole, was confounded
with an array of orders ranging from
straight shots of whiskey to coffee with
cream to hot whiskey to black coffee and
so on, he decided to pour the whole mess
into a sherry glass and announced that for
the remainder of the evening he would
only be serving "Irish coffee."
So as you finish up your Irish coffee at
Maloney's and brace up "with a bit of the
Dunphy's to keep the chill off the night,"
you might think of old Dan Ryan and drink
a toast to him. After all, poor old Dan has to
put up with pub and grill grub and he isn't
lucky enough to have a place like
Maloney's to frequent or test its boast of
"hearty culinary inducements, warm hos
pitality and fine distilled spirits."
