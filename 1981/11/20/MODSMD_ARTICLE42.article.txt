ELU'S BASQUE RESTAURANT
787 Broadway (near Powell)
San Francisco
986-9646
Most people know about the Italian family
stvle restaurants in San Francisco's North
Beach, places like Capp's Corner and La Pan
tera where big meals are served at long
tables in an atmosphere of clamor. These are
classic tourist attractions, and everyone
should visit one sometime; but the crowds
and the frantic pace ("Eat, eat, we've got to
the taijle open for the next group!") can
sometimes make the experience more of a
duty (like climbing Coit Tower) than a pleas
ure.
The city's Basque family style restaurants
aren't as well known, which is a shame be
cause thev offer excellent meals at re
markablv low prices in a much more relaxed,
truly familial climate. That's not to say that
Flu's is unknown. The menu sports a New
York T/mes rave; R. B. Read, the city's lead

ing underground gourmet, has called Elu's
one of the best restaurants in the city, and
when I told a friend in the city that I had
eaten there the night before she sighed with
recognitive delight. But when we went on a
Saturday night the place was quiet, un
crowded, and thoroughly comfortable.
There are many small tables and the room is
large enough to muffle any excessive noise.
Each night of the week (except Monday)
Elu's offers a different full course meal. On
Saturday that meal starts with a shrimp
potato salad and two thin pieces of salami as
an appetizer, and follows with a big tureen of
pea soup, with sourdough bread on the side.
Then the first main course is brought in, an
excellent vol-au-vent with creamed sweet
breads, accompanied by sweet peas mixed
with greens. The second main course is roast
lamb with scalloped potatoes and a large
bowl of salad. Ice cream and coffee con
clude the meal.
All this costs on Iv S6, and the meal is served
with care and excellent presentation. The

first course will be brought as soon as you sit
down, and each succeeding course is
brought just as it is desired. Even the plates
areattractive (and matched); and they bring
individual butter dishes and knives so ev
eryone can butter their bread at the same
time. If you ask for water, a big pitcher will be
brought to the table and left.
The servings are not enormous, but cer
tainly more than adequate in size, especially
given the price. And the food, while simple,
is of very high quality. The vol-au-vent pastry
was flakier and tastier than I have eaten at
many haute cuisine establishments, and the
creamed sweetbreads filling was delicious.
The roast lamb was exceptionally good: very
tender and juicy on the inside with a crisp ex
terior — just the way you'd want your grand
mother to make it. 4
Other nights provide other delights. 'On
Tuesdays and Fridays Elu's serves its re
nowned steamed clams with rice — this is the
dish that sends critics into ecstasies, and is
probably the most identifiably Basque recipe

served.
Paella is also offered every night, at $6.75
per person for two or more; as good as the
sweetbreads and lamb were, I looked on en
viously as the group at the next table de
voured a paella that looked and smelled
absolutely delicious.
One peculiarity ofthe service: if you order
the house wine, wine glasses are not
brought. Instead you drink out of the same
glasses they use for water (which look like
large shot glasses). This becomes more un
derstandable when you taste the house red,
which is verv heavy and full of tannin. But a
full liter costs only $2.50, and I have been
served far worse wines at much higher
prices. The house wine is very rustic and
primitive, but it actually fits in well with the
robust, simple, and deeply satisfying food.
Flu's also has a modest wine list, with wines as
low as $3 — and they do bring wine glasses
for these.
The restaurant has been in the same place
since 1907 (just after the quake), under the

name Hotel d'Espana. For the last 23 years it
lias boon run by Lou and Marie Elu, Ameri
can-born first-generation Basques whose
ancestors came from the province of
Vi/cava. Thev both work very hard, and oth
er family members join in; there is probably
no other way they could keep the prices
down. Thev have developed a loyal and var
ied clientele. At the next table a trio of young
collegiate types devoured their paella; at an
other sat two men in black leather jackets.
After dinner we sat at the nicely-stocked bar
talking to the Flus and two lovely white
haired ladies, natives of San Francisco, who
sipped brandy alexanders and talked of the
changes they'd seen over the years. One said
she enjoyed the family-style restaurants and
was a regular at both Elu's and Capp's Cor
ner. I think thf> friendliness and quality of
Flu's shines through in that statement. At
Capp's you're only treated well if you've
been going there for years. At Elu's they
make you feel a little like family on the very
first visit. —Vince Waldman
