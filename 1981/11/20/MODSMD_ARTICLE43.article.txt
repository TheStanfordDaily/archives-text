AGADIR MOROCCAN
RESTAURANT
746 Broadway
San Francisco
397-6305
You're sauntering up
Broadway in the city, neon
and lewd billboards ev
erywhere, swerving cars and
swerving drunks — and
you're looking fora low un
assuming doorway on your
right marked "Agadir Mo
roccan Restaurant." In you
walk, and peace. An Arab
tent billows overhead and
you're struck by the fra
grance of rosewater and
cumin.
We visited Agadir on a
Sunday evening when it was
three-quarters empty, and
we were shown to a shad
owy, private table. The
waiter, who was resplen
dently surreal in the uni
form of King Hassan's Royal
Guard (scarlet and gold
brocade, from the plump
fez on his head to his vastly
baggy lit a sin
gle candle. Very romantic.
There's no silverware
here; all the food is to be
eaten with fingers, so for the
sake of hygiene and de
corum, the waiter washed
our hands. He bore in a
huge beaten silver urn from
which warm water was
poured.
The menu is a la carte, and
begins with three set ap
petizers. The first was
Charba, a thin vegetable
soup tasting of cumin —
perhaps a little bland, but
improved by a squeeze of
lemon. Then the waiter
brought in a conical baske;
of hot, fresh ryebread — de
licious if un-Moroccan.
With it came a dish of
marinated vegetables: egg
plant, cucumber, carrot and
pepper.
The technique goes
something like this: Grasp a
fragment of bread in the
socket of your palm and ro
tate your hand clockwise in
a scooping motion. Then
jerk the wrist up sharply and
flip the melange into your
mouth . . . It's great fun, but
be sure not to wear your
Sunday best.
Now if you were served
this kind of salad at Tres
idder Crossroads, it proba
blv wouldn't seem at all out
of the ordinary, but some
how eating hunched over
the veneered table with ar
abesque-pierced metal ware
overhead, it was transmuted
into an extremely exotic
dish.
And what followed was
really exotic. Imagine a pie
of fluffed chicken and

almonds, airy as a
marshmallow, wrapped in
millefeuille pastry. And im
agine, as a touch of sublime
implausibility, that this vi
sion is crisscrossed withcon
fectioner's sugar and cin
namon. We poured
ourselves another glass of
wine and indulged in the
fantasy.
The menu offers a choice
of 10 entrees. My compa
nion chose Kotban, a sort of
shish kebab; and I had
Chicken Mquali — Cornish
hen braised in lemon. The
Kotban was extraordinarily
tasty. Each chunk of lamb
was marinated in lemon and
flavored in cumin and
paprika. It was juicy and
chewy, and to quote the
menu, "quite unlike any
other shish kebab you've
ever had."
The chicken, on the other
hand, tasted like standard
production-line meat.
Though the coating of
lemon was refreshingly pi
quant, and was eagerly
mop p e d up on the
ryebread, eating the
chicken itself demanded a
fair amount of dexterity.
Dessert was a little disap
pointing — no honeyed
pastries or Turkish delights.
Instead, we were served or
ange slices sprinkled with
cinnamon. Then the waiter
tiptoed in, balancing on his
slippered feet, his tongue
flickering between his teeth
in concentration. He poised
a wrought metal tea urn
four feet above our glasses,
and gentlv tipped the spout.
Out gushed the sweet mint
tea, fizzing like champagne.
The meal costs $14.75 per
person, plus $10 fora bottle
of Sidi Brahim, a heavy, tan
nin-laden claret-type Alger
ian wine, which tore
through the spicy food with
gusto. Agadir is open every
evening except Monday,
and it's best to reserve a
table, especially on week
ends or fora large party.
From a strictly gustatory
point of view, the food here
is interesting rather than as
tounding. But from the mo
ment you bow vour head to
pass under the low cur
tained doorway, you're in a
magicallv inconsequential
world of make-believe, and
dinner is rather like taking
part in a game of charades
or a children's party. It's a lot
of fun. There's no better
wav of breaking the ice than
helping one another handle
the food, and few restau
rants are more romantically
exotic. Ideal fora special
date.

the veneered table with ar
abesque-pierced metal ware
overhead, it was transmuted
into an extremely exotic
dish.
And what followed was
really exotic. Imagine a pie
of fluffed chicken and

almonds, airy as a
marshmallow, wrapped in
millefeuille pastry. And im
agine, as a touch of sublime
implausibility, that this vi
sion is crisscrossed withcon
fectioner's sugar and cin
namon. We poured
ourselves another glass of
wine and indulged in the
fantasy.
The menu offers a choice
of 10 entrees. My compa
nion chose Kotban, a sort of
shish kebab; and I had
Chicken Mquali — Cornish
hen braised in lemon. The
Kotban was extraordinarily
tasty. Each chunk of lamb
was marinated in lemon and
flavored in cumin and
paprika. It was juicy and
chewy, and to quote the
menu, "quite unlike any
other shish kebab you've
ever had."
The chicken, on the other
hand, tasted like standard
production-line meat.
Though the coating of
lemon was refreshingly pi
quant, and was eagerly
mop p e d up on the
ryebread, eating the
chicken itself demanded a
fair amount of dexterity.
Dessert was a little disap
pointing — no honeyed
pastries or Turkish delights.
Instead, we were served or
ange slices sprinkled with
cinnamon. Then the waiter
tiptoed in, balancing on his
slippered feet, his tongue
flickering between his teeth
in concentration. He poised
a wrought metal tea urn
four feet above our glasses,
and gentlv tipped the spout.
Out gushed the sweet mint
tea, fizzing like champagne.
The meal costs $14.75 per
person, plus $10 fora bottle
of Sidi Brahim, a heavy, tan
nin-laden claret-type Alger
ian wine, which tore
through the spicy food with
gusto. Agadir is open every
evening except Monday,
and it's best to reserve a
table, especially on week
ends or fora large party.
From a strictly gustatory
point of view, the food here
is interesting rather than as
tounding. But from the mo
ment you bow vour head to
pass under the low cur
tained doorway, you're in a
magicallv inconsequential
world of make-believe, and
dinner is rather like taking
part in a game of charades
or a children's party. It's a lot
of fun. There's no better
wav of breaking the ice than
helping one another handle
the food, and few restau
rants are more romantically
exotic. Ideal fora special
date.

AGADIR MOROCCAN
RESTAURANT
746 Broadway
San Francisco
397-6305
You're sauntering up
Broadway in the city, neon
and lewd billboards ev
erywhere, swerving cars and
swerving drunks — and
you're looking fora low un
assuming doorway on your
right marked "Agadir Mo
roccan Restaurant." In you
walk, and peace. An Arab
tent billows overhead and
you're struck by the fra
grance of rosewater and
cumin.
We visited Agadir on a
Sunday evening when it was
three-quarters empty, and
we were shown to a shad
owy, private table. The
waiter, who was resplen
dently surreal in the uni
form of King Hassan's Royal
Guard (scarlet and gold
brocade, from the plump
fez on his head to his vastly
baggy lit a sin
gle candle. Very romantic.
There's no silverware
here; all the food is to be
eaten with fingers, so for the
sake of hygiene and de
corum, the waiter washed
our hands. He bore in a
huge beaten silver urn from
which warm water was
poured.
The menu is a la carte, and
begins with three set ap
petizers. The first was
Charba, a thin vegetable
soup tasting of cumin —
perhaps a little bland, but
improved by a squeeze of
lemon. Then the waiter
brought in a conical baske;
of hot, fresh ryebread — de
licious if un-Moroccan.
With it came a dish of
marinated vegetables: egg
plant, cucumber, carrot and
pepper.
The technique goes
something like this: Grasp a
fragment of bread in the
socket of your palm and ro
tate your hand clockwise in
a scooping motion. Then
jerk the wrist up sharply and
flip the melange into your
mouth . . . It's great fun, but
be sure not to wear your
Sunday best.
Now if you were served
this kind of salad at Tres
idder Crossroads, it proba
blv wouldn't seem at all out
of the ordinary, but some
how eating hunched over
the veneered table with ar
abesque-pierced metal ware
