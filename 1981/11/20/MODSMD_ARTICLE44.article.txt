PEAR WILLIAM'S
150 Middlefield Road
Menlo Park
323-8445
It was a stormy Friday night in Palo Alto; the radio
stations were advising people to stay off the road and
repeatedly updating reports of traffic jams. We were
hoping dinner would turn out to be worth venturing
out onto the slic k roads — and good news, folks, it was
even worth getting soaked on the mad dash from the
car to the front door.
Pear William's has a good bit of charm and a healthy
dose of spunk. It's quite evident that when the seven
owners (including the two chefs) put their heads to
gether, the result is a well-publicized restaurant with
great food to back up its reputation.
The L-shaped dining area is split into two main sec
tions, with quaint wooden booths all along one wall.
The graceful lighting manages to convey both a sense
of elegance as well as warmth, and we felt ourselves
happily sheltered from the storm. As early diners, we
might have enjoyed a nice quiet meal if not for the
couple across the room. You know the type: booming
voices discussing the latest in opera, symphony,
ballet, etc. etc. etc. Wisely, the management was
thoughtul enough to turn on some music to help
drown them out.
Turning our attention to the meal, we munched on
some delicious mini-loaves of fresh bread while
awaiting our appetizers. Our water glasses were
graced with a twist of lemon — a small, but pleasant
touch. We began with the "Saute of mushrooms with
Madeira" ($3.50), a disb of very fresh mushrooms
lightly sauteed in a rather thin sauce — not particular
ly exciting, but tasty. The "Fromage de Chevre en
Casserole" ($2.75) was a far better choice: a tiny
casserole of baked French goat cheese with a bread
crumb topping and served with several slices of hors
d'oevre-size toast — delightfully pungent and highly
recommended for cheese lovers.
Both soup and salad are included in the price of
your entree, as long as you stick to the house offer
ings. The soup du jour was a cabbage and vegetable
concoction; it was quite good, but seemed a bit
brothy and pale beside the French onion soup which
we also sampled. The latter, served in a crock and
generously topped with baked cheese and bread, was
thick, rich and savory, and well worth the additional
$2. The chef's dinner salad was a sizeable dish of Ro
maine lettuce tossed with walnuts and coated with a
delectable vinaigrette dressing. We also tried one of
the other three salads available; this turned out to be

a blue cheese variation of the house salad, offering
tomatoes and chunks of blue cheese in addition to
the walnuts, and tossed with a blue cheese
vinaigrette. Since the two salads were so comparable,
I'd recommend sticking with the included dinner
salad, and saving the $2 for dessert . ..

The menu displays entrees ranging in price from
$7.50 fora "Ramequin Florentin" (a cross between a
quiche and a souffle) to $14.95 for steak, veal or lamb
tiishes, with' liver and seafood options hovering
around the $9 to $12 range. Considering that these
prices include soup, salad, bread and vegetables on
the side, they seem quite reasonable for such high
quality food.

One of Pear William's advertising techniques
comes in handy for people who like to plan ahead:
thev have a monthly "newsletter" that describes their
upcoming weekend dinner specials. We decided to
try the Chef's special that night, Cassoulet ($11), lest
all that advertising effort go to waste. Although the
Chef also suggests a particular wine selection to ac
company the special (the Cassoulet's recommended
companion was Pomerol, Chateu le Gay, Bordeaux
1973), we had the house wine instead (and I must ad
mit, we didn't do the extensive wine list justice).
Back to the Cassoulet; this "classic regional favorite
of Languedoc" proved to be an extremely well-pre
pared casserole of lamb, duck, goose, sausages and
white beans. A delicious sauce unified the various
tastes while allowing each to retain its distinct flavor;
the serving was generous and would have been quite
filling even without the preceding appetizer, soup
and salad.
The other entree we chose, "Filet de Sole Alicante"
($10.95), was an elegant and savory dish: rolled sole
filets encased in a richly buttered puff pastry and cov
ered with an exquisite pinkish saffron sauce. Both of
these entrees were accompanied by a side dish of rice
and lightly baked and breaded tomatoes.
If clearing your plate means denying yourself des
sert, be sure to leave some food for your doggy bag:
dessert is not to be missed. We tried two of the house
favorites. The Pear William ($2.45) featured a fresh
poached pear served on a scoop of Bud's vanilla ice
cream and drenched in an outrageously good home
made caramel sauce. An even sweeter delicacy (if
such a thing is possible) was the Meringue a la mocha
($2.75): a scoop of mocha ice cream in a frozen baked
meringue covered with a creamy coffee sauce.
A good strong cup of coffee brought the meal to a
satisfying close. Our noisy neighbors had vanished
and were replaced by a room full of low-keyed diners.
Both dining areas were full by the time we left, so res
ervations are definitely in order. Service throughout
the meal was top notch — our waiter was consistently
prompt and friendly, and our dinner progressed at a
very comfortable pace.
Pear William's, whose name was inspired by a Swiss
liquor called William Pear Brandy, offers lunch as well
as dinner (with an abridged menu that features sand
wiches and salads as well as dinner-type entrees), and
also serves a Sunday champagne brunch that sounds
quite delightful. A basic dinner for two, not including
wine or "extras" like appetizers or desserts, is well
worth the $15 to $30, so save up some money, work up
an appetite, and take a friend to dinner.
