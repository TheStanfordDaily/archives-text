ENCINA STATION
NEW YORKER STEAK
DINNER
On campus
497-4321
On television, a "night out
with the boys" is portrayed as a
"steak and a Lowenbrau" with
vour good friends at the best
place in town. So I had to be
apprehensive when the boss
said we were going to the best
place on campus — F.ncina Sta
tion.
Could it be that the same
place that offers 25-cent hot
dogs and a wide screen color
TV for Monday Night Football
could be offering a full course
steak dinner, and for less than
$10?
Yes, it could be. Yes, we were
surprised. Very pleasantly so.
After all, when we heard about
this special event the number

of reviewers clamoring for the
opportunity was hardly over
whelming. How often do the
editor, managing editor and
advertising manager wind up
writing restaurant reviews?
How often does Bob Hellman
give up the pizza he just or
dered?
Indeed, it took a few mo
ments after we were seated at
one of the elegantly china-set
tables in the darkened room to
recognize the same old Encina
Station. The serving counter
and the TV were still there off
in the darkness, but introduc
ing a maitre d' somehow lent a
little unexpected atmosphere.
Waitresses seemed an oddity
also, but proved prompt and
friendly. We had barely taken
our seats before our waitress
came by for our wine order (in
cluded in the $9.50 pricetag,
$18 per couple).
As we ate our salads and

sipped the house white wine,
we speculated on how the
rather simple, almost hollow
interior of the high-ceilinged
center room could be fixed up.
But then again, with its long
string of recent identity
changes, was Encina planning
to be a pub or a restaurant? We
could ask the manager about
that, but either way the place
would be great with a loft, and
maybe even a dance floor.
Those who operate Encina Sta
tion do have some decisions to
make about what kind of place
it should be for this campus.
Easy for us to play interior
designers. The question at
hand was, how was the food?
No need for looks if the dinner
wasn't worth it. We still had our
doubts.
Not after the first bite. It
smelled good. It looked good,
right down to the tastefully
chosen vegetables. But it tasted

great. I had one of those $25-a
--«.hot steak dinners at Chicago's
finest once. Non, monsieur, no
difference!
Though the Encina Station
image might discourage me
just a bit, I wouldn't mind tak
ing a (late to one of these"New
Yorker's." You couldn't touch
that price in Palo Alto, much
less the city, and who needs to
hassle with driving (some of us
still don't have cars, re
member)?
But alas, that was it. No Big
Game dinner. NoThanksgiving
dinner. The management
doesn't plan to make this a reg
ular Saturday night affair.
There is good news, though.
Thev (Jo plan to make such spe
cial (finners a monthly offering.
The next, a French dinner
featuring chicken cordon bleu,
is scheduled for Dec. 8.
