Ninotchka ★**#
Fox, Redwood City
The ad line for Greta Garbo's
first sound film, Anna Christie,
was "Garbo laughs!" The ad line
for Ninotchka, her first comedy,
was "Garbo Laughs!" For once,
the publicity department knew
what it was talking about — the
addition of laughter to Garbo's
screen persona was nearly as
great a revelation as the addition
of sound. Her beauty is still as
great, and the presence of a smile
warms her. Ernst Lubitsch
directed this great comedy,
which finds Russian agent
Ninotchka seduced by the
charms of the city of Paris and by
the things it offers: champagne,
dancing, and romance. It's a fairy
tale where good spiritsand frivol
ity conquer all.
Plays next Tuesday and
Wednesday with another Garbo
film, Mata Hari.

Singin 4 in the Rain
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Singin' in the Rain is the
H.vvlot of musicals. It's a virtually
perfet t movie. The script, bv Bet
ty Coinifon and \ciolph Green, is
funny and tight — it's also his
torically accurate in its telling of
the troubles that beset the mov
ies when they learned to talk. The
music, by Arthur Freedand Nacio
Herb Brown, is wonderful — the
songs include "You are My Luckv
Star," "Broadway Rhythm,"
"Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Sup
poses" (a great nonsense fvric
which starts out "Mosessupposes
his toeses are roses but Moses
supposes erroneously"), and, of
course, the title tune And the
performers are splendid. Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor
dance and sing a lot; Debbie Rey
nold sings quite a bit and dances a
little; Cyd Ch.irisse just dances;
and Jean H|gen plays Lena La
mont, a screen star who can't
sing, can't dance and can't act.
Lena Lamont's awful, and
Hagen's marvelous
Double-billed through
Wednesday with "Lili," which
stars Leslie Caron.

Raggedy Man **
Old Mill, Mountain View
The first feature by jack Fisk,
who served as art director on
Badlands and Days of Heaven;
though he shows an impressive
grasp of film technique, it's an art
' director's movie: individual shots
' matter more than whole se
> quernes. William Witliff's script
> suggests traces of southern
' Gothic sensibility, but Fisk de
> fangs the menace and makes the
film homey and benign. Eric Roh

into her life, acts Sissv Spacek off
' the screen.

Gallipoli **"?
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture m the spirit of the old
Curie a I Jin, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of voung
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their vouth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the pnotgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie. §jj 1

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serinls and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas <Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
llodv Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed bv the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
,t cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to .ill those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hvpe about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Fscape from New York***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The year is 1997; Manhattan Is
land h.is been walled off to form a
maxima insecurity prison. Once a
person is sent in, there's no way
out — those who don't like the
idea of living out their lives in the
prison may opt for execution and
, immmediate cremation on the
premises Inside, the island has
turned into a nightmare Cvorld,
inhabited above and below bv
creatures out of bad dreams
From the time the title credits
fade to the roll of the end credits,
fscape from Vew York offers vir
tually unrelenting excitement.
Director )ohn Carpenter (who
directed Halloween, the first and
far and away the best of the cur
rent horror movie cycle) takes his
lightweight plot and fills it to the
bursting point with striking im
ages and setpieces of suspense. i
Plavs Wednesday with Arthur

Bijou, Palo Alto
Worse than Endless Love.
Worse than Xanadu.
Worse than Destroy All
Monsters.
Worse than G/dgef Goes Ha
waiian, which it in many ways re
sembles.
The combination of Bo Derek
in front of the camera and John
Derek, the Rasputin of the '80s,
behind it, produces a movie that
only a masochist could love.
Where is Johnny Weismuller
when we need him?
Double-billed with Body Heat.

True Confessions
Old Mill, Mountain View
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.

Breathless
Monday, Cubberley
In tho earlv '60s, the films of
the French New Wave shattered
every rule of classical filmmaking
in ,111 effort to make people look
,it movies in a different, more-ac
tive wav. Ironically, most New
Wave films now seem friendly
and familiar — audiences have
become a 1 - accustomed to the
new rules as they were to the old.
But Kreafh/ess, directed by the
New Wave's enfant terrible, |eari«|
I iir (iodard, instill electrifying. It'
is a storv of a French gangster
(plaved by jean-Paul Belmondo)
who worships Bogart; his moll is

technique,Hwith its outrageous
jump c iits and jagged editing pat

Eve of the Needle**
Fox, Redwood City
Richard Marquand directed
this adaptation of the Ken Follett
novel. Marquand isn't a very
good director — in fact, his han
dling of the "action" pieces
(these tending toward stabbing*
and hackings) makes him seem
borderline incompetent. Donald
Sutherland and Kate Nelligan
star Sutherland plays a Nazi spv
who could be a brother to the
Na/i the actor played in 7900; he
does it verv wHI, but no amount
of talent could make tne charac
ter particularly interesting. Kate
Nelligan plays the Englishwoman
who falls in love with him. Her
part is nearly as poorly written,
and she has to participate in all of
the hokier elements of the plot
(which attempts to one-up Wail
I 'nfil D.irk and fails); But Nelligan
manages to make her character
come alive; we actually like the
woman she portravs. SfTe may be
the only human being in the mov
-10. One can only hope that her
next film finds her am6ng some
others'*'?))

Arthur ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not .1 uro.it movie, but often
quirk enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
i omedies th.it were foisted upon
us I,ist summer. Dudley Moore, in
the titlf role, plavsa wealthy alco-
Imlii who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being .in actress. The movie's real
lo\e match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who •
plavs Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Prince of the Citv *
Palo Alto Square
Id short, deliberate takes, the
cast performs as though they'd
spent days in an overheated
steam room — we don't get any
rest from their bug-eyed, over
heated actorishness. Every scene
begins at its climax, so that we
never understand what drove
these people to such extreme
st.ites of hysteria. Sidney Lumet,
who directed and co-wrote the
script (with lay Presson Allen),
seems to think he has something
so important to say in this movie
about police corruption that they
don't have to bother structuring
it or modulating the tone or es
tablishing motivation for the
characters — but it's almost im
possible to figure out what he is
saying. Treat Williams stars, but
the onlv good performance is
given bv Jerry Orbach.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
|ohn Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
ihe screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (|eremy Irons) and Anna
(Mervl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of Tho Frpnch
I ii'dlrruint\ Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reis/, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
.1 splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Creep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

F<>r Your Eyes Only**
Fox, Redwood City
This Bond movie's limited am
-bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravagan/a (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
anv Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the producers plan to re
place him with a younger model
soon). He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — fora
terrific, cliche-reversing car
chase where Bond is forced to ex
change his Lotus fora Citroen. If
the moviemakers had been as
panful with the Bond formula
through the rest of the film, For
fVoi/r /yes On Iv might have
passed for entertainment instead
of an exercise in cinematic stasis.
Starts next Thursday with

This is a gooey situation comedy
wi|h a fake feminist gloss and a

won't please those who enjoyed
watching females get conquered.

Moore is an ingratiating
humbler, and Fdwards' gives the
