# Cardinal decision draws reactions
##

Stanford fans will officially be able to root for the Stan
ford Cardinal following President Donald Kennedy's an
nouncement Tuesday that athletic teams here will per
manently be represented and symbolized by the color.
The announcement followed a recommendation by
the ASSIJ after last month's election and Monday's rec
ommendation by the University's mascot advisory com
mittee.
"With this choice finally made, we find ourselves, as
usual, unique in our own conference, where one finds
six mammals (all carnivores save one), a bird, a Sun Devil
and a military figure of some kind but no other color,"
Kennedy's statement said. "Colors do serve, however, as
the sole symbol at some universities of distinction;
moreover, well-chosen colors often come to dominate
animal mascots when both are present.
"I hope this affirmation, in which various segments of
the Stanford commumnity have concurred, puts to rest
for once and for all the so-called 'mascot' issue. We have
something better; it is unique, historically correct, and
vivid. We should support it with enthusiasm."
Mariann Byerwalter, COP member and member of the
mascot advisory committee, was elated and relieved fol
lowing the decision. "One of the goals during the elec
tion was to arrive at a consensus and have it supported by

the administration," she said. "I realize there will be re
percussions at first since the issue has gone on for nine
years. But in the long run, as people understand and ac
cept the symbol it will cease to be an issue."
One group, Friends of the Stanford Indian, does dis
agree with Kennedy's reaffirmation of the color
Cardinal. Larry Ziebell, president of the group, called
Kennedy's decision a "farce," a "set-up," and a "sham."
"This is just another irresponsible action under this ad
ministration to confuse the issue," he said. "This issue
could have been solved a long time ago.
"As far as I'm concerned the alumni aren't going to go
along with it," Ziebell said. Ziebell, a Palo Alto insurance
agent and not an alumnus of Stanford, claims to have the
support of 4500 people, most of whom he says are alum
ni, and an estimated budget of $5,000 to $10,000.
Though he agrees Kennedy has the power to make the
decision, Ziebell accuses Kennedy of "railroading the
Cardinal right through," by "handpicking the people on
the (mascot advisory) committee.
Ziebell said his group will be spending a "considerable
amount" to distribute 20,000 feathers and balloonsat the
Big Game. He also said Timm Williams, who used to ap
pear at football games as Chief Lightfoot, Stanford's
mascot, will attend the game and four class reunions.
