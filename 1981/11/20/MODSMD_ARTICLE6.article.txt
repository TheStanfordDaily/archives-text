# Sororities working for recognition
## 
### Libby Chambers 
Although sorority rush is still sever
al months away, every sorority here
has representatives working with the
Row Office to gain University recog
nition.
So far, only Delta Gamma sorority
(the DCs) has been able to achieve
this goal.
According to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row office, "No other
group is on the verge of recogni
tion," hut Delta Sigma Theta is "very
close."
In order to be sanctioned, a long
list of University requirements must
be fulfilled First, the group must
demonstrate that it is attempting to
attract a diverse membership. Also,

selection processes may not in any
way involve outside letters of recom
mendation or the decision-making
input of anv non-University persons.
Second, a sorority must he able to
show freedom from outside juris
diction. This point has proved to be a
major stumbling block for University
chapters because they have been un
able to gain the desired degree of au
tonomy from their respective na
tional organizations.
To help the sororities meet these
regulations, the Row Office acts as a
sort of arbitrator. Conklin explained,
"First we sit down and go through the
constitution together. I point out any
areas of conflict, and then it's up to
them to contact their national or

ganizations.
From that point, a lengthy series of
negotiations begins as the national
organizations try to retain constitu
tional control over individual chap
ters and the Stanford sororities strive
to alter their constitutions to fit Uni
versity requirements.
"Basically, it comes down to a
question of priorities," said Conklin.
"Each national committee has to ask
themselves whether it's more impor
tant to maintain complete power, or
to be able to claim a recognized
chapter at Stanford University."
This goal of University recognition
can take vears to achieve. For exam
ple, the DGs first contacted the Row
Office in the fall of 1977 and were not
formally sanctioned until January of
this year.
Eventually, according to some of
ficials, most sororities will be recog
nized. Then the issue of housing will
undoubtedly crop up. Norm Rob
inson, associate dean of residential
education, said, "If it (sorority recog
nition) happens to be a year in which
we solicit housing proposals from
groups, they (sororities) are free to
ask about it. Next year there will be
some houses opening up, for exam
ple Storey House, but their particular
status isn't certain right now."
At the start of next year, the Zeta
Psi house will again be vacant. On
this subject, Robinson said, "I just
don't know whether or not the Zete
house will be made available for
group housing, or whether it will
turn into a regular Row House, and
therefore be included in the draw."
To qualify for group housing, any
recognized group would have to
demonstrate knowledge of the oper
ation of a house and food service.
Also, the group would have to de
velop financial plans and secure an
adviser.
"As we've seen in the past," said
Robinson, "a group must show a cer
tain level of responsibility. And, to
put it bluntly, they must build a case
as to why they need the house more
than any other group."
It was rumored that the DGs would
attempt to obtain the Zete house for
use as a sorority house next year, but
apparently that idea has not been
popular among members. According
to one DC, "The house is too far out
in the boonies fora group of girls to
live in and walk back and forth in the
dark . . ."
The history of the University's
sororities goes back to the school's
earliest vears. Then, sororities were
not only recognized by the adminis

tration, but occupied on-campus
houses. During World War 11, an ov
erabundance of female students led
to conflicts between sorority and
non-sorority women's organizations.
A mutual decision, involving repre
sentatives from the women's groups
and the administration, was made to
disband all sororities, and the system
lav dormant for 35 years.
Four vears ago, several junior and
senior women attempted to bring
sororities back to the University. A
Dec. 13,1977 resolution of the Board
of Trustees enabled them to proceed
with their plans. Chapters from UC-
Berkeley and other local colleges
were asked to colonize new groups
here and, with their support, rush
was held. The first rush yielded ap
proximately 25-30 members to each
newly formed chapter.
Since that time, the participation
level has nearly doubled; currently,
the University sorority system in
volves approximately 300 up
perclasswomen. The Inter-Sororitv
Council (ISC), a liaison between the
individual groups and the University
administration, is comprised of rep
resentatives from each sorority.
All sororities, except the DGs, must
now conduct meetings and social
functions off campus. Often, they are
forced to use church basements or
apartment house common rooms.
According to ISC president Ann
Bye, "We are much more than just a
club getting together for meetings
and parties. We spend the biggest
part of our time involved in philan
thropies." These philanthropies, she
said, include visiting nursing homes
and the Children's Hospital, along
with fundraising for the Heart and
Kidney Foundations.
Bye said upperclasswomen are be
ginning to be aware of the service (as
opposed to purely social) side of
sororities, and this could account for
the large turnout for the 1981 rush.
