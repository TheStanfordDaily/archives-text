# Sororities working for recognition

### Libby Chambers 
Although sorority rush is still sever
al months away, every sorority here
has representatives working with the
Row Office to gain University recog
nition.
So far, only Delta Gamma sorority
(the DCs) has been able to achieve
this goal.
According to Diana Conklin, direc
tor of the Row office, "No other
group is on the verge of recogni
tion," hut Delta Sigma Theta is "very
close."
In order to be sanctioned, a long
list of University requirements must
be fulfilled First, the group must
demonstrate that it is attempting to
attract a diverse membership. Also,

selection processes may not in any
way involve outside letters of recom
mendation or the decision-making
input of anv non-University persons.
Second, a sorority must he able to
show freedom from outside juris
diction. This point has proved to be a
major stumbling block for University
chapters because they have been un
able to gain the desired degree of au
tonomy from their respective na
tional organizations.
To help the sororities meet these
regulations, the Row Office acts as a
sort of arbitrator. Conklin explained,
"First we sit down and go through the
constitution together. I point out any
areas of conflict, and then it's up to
them to contact their national or

ganizations.
From that point, a lengthy series of
negotiations begins as the national
organizations try to retain constitu
tional control over individual chap
ters and the Stanford sororities strive
to alter their constitutions to fit Uni
versity requirements.
"Basically, it comes down to a
question of priorities," said Conklin.
"Each national committee has to ask
themselves whether it's more impor
tant to maintain complete power, or
to be able to claim a recognized
chapter at Stanford University."
This goal of University recognition
can take vears to achieve. For exam
ple, the DGs first contacted the Row
