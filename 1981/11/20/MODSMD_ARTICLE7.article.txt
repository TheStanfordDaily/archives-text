# Rebel tactics stymie junta in on-going war in El Salvador
## World 
### Los Angeles Times 
Perquin, El Salvador — The village of Perquin,
a collection of rocky streets and adobe houses,
hardly seems worth a fight.
Yet for more than a week in August Perquin
was the focus of a sharp battle between govern
ment troops and units of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, a classic guerrilla en
counter in a war that no one appears to be win
ning.
About 300 guerrillas entered the village just
before dawn and easily overwhelmed the defen
ders, 20 national guardsmen and an equal
number of civil guards. Then, on the rebel radio,
thev taunted the military with their embarrass
ing accomplishment.
Twenty-five miles away, in San Francisco
Gotera, the province capital, the army com
mander hesitated in sending help. He feared
that the capture of Perquin was a diversionary
tactic, an effort to lure him away from the guer
rillas' real objective, San Francisco Gotera.
Hit and retreat
By the time the gcverr.mpnt managed to put
together a force of 1500 soldiers for a coun
terattack, the rebels had slipped out of Perquin,
leaving the town half-destroyed.
That is the way it has been going in El Salvador.
"The guerrillas can't hold territory for too
long and the army can't wipe them out," an in
formed American diplomat said. "I think the
term stalemate is probably the best."
lose Napoleon Duarte, president of the ruling
junta, admitted that the guerrillas are inflicting
losses on the army but said that the army is mak
ing up its losses while the guerrillas are not.
A senior U.S. official said he believes that the
government can win the war under the current
circumstances but that it will take years.
He reasons that the guerrillas, while better
trained and more experienced than they were
earlier, have taken serious losses and are weaker
in both manpower and supplies.
But that does not take into account the nature
of the problem facing the army. As pieced to
gether from both American and Salvadoran
sources, the problem includesthe following ele
ments:
•The army is spread too thin. Bv one informed
American estimate, the army has 14,000 soldiers.
Of this number, 7000 are tied down defending
roads and bridges and the like and 2500 are in
support. That leaves 4500 to go after the rebels,
believed to number 3000 to 4000. Classic coun
terinsurgency doctrine holds that a conven
tional force must outnumber guerrillas by 10 to
one to successfully suppress them.
•The army lacks mobility. When the rebels at
tacked Perquin on Aug. 9, all 10 of the heli
copters supplied to the government by the Unit
ed States were grounded, damaged by ground

fire and short of spare parts. The United States
has sent four more helicopters.
•The army is short of officers. An estimate
used bv U.S. officials is that there are 100 men for
every officer. This ratio is considered inade
quate, though improving.
•There is a morale problem. An American re
searcher who recently studied the situation at
firsthand said he had heard reports of wide
spread demoralization. He described the mili
tary as "a peasant army — grievously deluded as
to what they will encounter on the battlefield."
Demoralized army
In testimony before Congress in September,
Robert Leiken, director of the Soviet-Latin
project of the Georgetown Center for Strategic
and International Studies attributed the de
moralization in part to continued atrocities be
lieved to involve the military and security forces.
Counterbalancing the army's weaknesses, the
guerrillas are taking casualties but probably not
as many as the government has said in its public
statements.
According to leftist sources and the rebel ra
dio, the army is taking advantage of its new
found friendliness with neighboring Honduras
to coordinate strategy in border areas where the
guerrillas are strong.
Leiken, who spent three weeks in Ei Salvador
and Nicaragua. He said he believes the rebels
have adopted a "bouncing-ball strategy" de
signed to wear out the army with a series of coor
dinated pinprick operations.
There is evidence to support such a view in the
military picture that emerged after the fighting
in Perquin.
Although the guerrillas are still safely dug into
their base areas in the mountains around Per
quin, they have not mounted any major attacks
recently.
They have concentrated on another province
capital, Suchitoto, near the Central Plateau, and
around the cotton-growing center of Usulutan
in the south. This has made it necessary for the
government to redeploy its troops.
Rebel stronghold
In the northeastern rebel stronghold of
Morazan province, a clergyman who spends
some of his time in rural villages said the rebels
were going door to door trying to win the vil
lagers over to their side.
"They know now that they launched their of
fensive (the so-called final offensive of last Janu
ary) too early, so they're going back to try to
broaden and strengthen their base among the
peasantry," he said.
Insurgent sources fear that there will be
greater involvement by Honduran and
Guatemalan "proxy" forces acting on behalf of
the United States.

formed American diplomat said. "I think the
term stalemate is probably the best."
lose Napoleon Duarte, president of the ruling
junta, admitted that the guerrillas are inflicting
losses on the army but said that the army is mak
ing up its losses while the guerrillas are not.
A senior U.S. official said he believes that the
government can win the war under the current
circumstances but that it will take years.
He reasons that the guerrillas, while better
trained and more experienced than they were
earlier, have taken serious losses and are weaker
in both manpower and supplies.
But that does not take into account the nature
of the problem facing the army. As pieced to
gether from both American and Salvadoran
sources, the problem includesthe following ele
ments:
•The army is spread too thin. Bv one informed
American estimate, the army has 14,000 soldiers.
Of this number, 7000 are tied down defending
roads and bridges and the like and 2500 are in
support. That leaves 4500 to go after the rebels,
believed to number 3000 to 4000. Classic coun
terinsurgency doctrine holds that a conven
tional force must outnumber guerrillas by 10 to
one to successfully suppress them.
•The army lacks mobility. When the rebels at
tacked Perquin on Aug. 9, all 10 of the heli
copters supplied to the government by the Unit
ed States were grounded, damaged by ground

fire and short of spare parts. The United States
has sent four more helicopters.
•The army is short of officers. An estimate
used bv U.S. officials is that there are 100 men for
every officer. This ratio is considered inade
quate, though improving.
•There is a morale problem. An American re
searcher who recently studied the situation at
firsthand said he had heard reports of wide
spread demoralization. He described the mili
tary as "a peasant army — grievously deluded as
to what they will encounter on the battlefield."
Demoralized army
In testimony before Congress in September,
Robert Leiken, director of the Soviet-Latin
project of the Georgetown Center for Strategic
and International Studies attributed the de
moralization in part to continued atrocities be
lieved to involve the military and security forces.
Counterbalancing the army's weaknesses, the
guerrillas are taking casualties but probably not
as many as the government has said in its public
statements.
According to leftist sources and the rebel ra
dio, the army is taking advantage of its new
found friendliness with neighboring Honduras
to coordinate strategy in border areas where the
guerrillas are strong.
Leiken, who spent three weeks in Ei Salvador
and Nicaragua. He said he believes the rebels
have adopted a "bouncing-ball strategy" de
signed to wear out the army with a series of coor
dinated pinprick operations.
There is evidence to support such a view in the
military picture that emerged after the fighting
in Perquin.
Although the guerrillas are still safely dug into
their base areas in the mountains around Per
quin, they have not mounted any major attacks
recently.
They have concentrated on another province
capital, Suchitoto, near the Central Plateau, and
around the cotton-growing center of Usulutan
in the south. This has made it necessary for the
government to redeploy its troops.
Rebel stronghold
In the northeastern rebel stronghold of
Morazan province, a clergyman who spends
some of his time in rural villages said the rebels
were going door to door trying to win the vil
lagers over to their side.
"They know now that they launched their of
fensive (the so-called final offensive of last Janu
ary) too early, so they're going back to try to
broaden and strengthen their base among the
peasantry," he said.
Insurgent sources fear that there will be
greater involvement by Honduran and
Guatemalan "proxy" forces acting on behalf of
the United States.
Perquin, El Salvador — The village of Perquin,
a collection of rocky streets and adobe houses,
hardly seems worth a fight.
Yet for more than a week in August Perquin
was the focus of a sharp battle between govern
ment troops and units of the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, a classic guerrilla en
counter in a war that no one appears to be win
ning.
About 300 guerrillas entered the village just
before dawn and easily overwhelmed the defen
ders, 20 national guardsmen and an equal
number of civil guards. Then, on the rebel radio,
thev taunted the military with their embarrass
ing accomplishment.
Twenty-five miles away, in San Francisco
Gotera, the province capital, the army com
mander hesitated in sending help. He feared
that the capture of Perquin was a diversionary
tactic, an effort to lure him away from the guer
rillas' real objective, San Francisco Gotera.
Hit and retreat
By the time the gcverr.mpnt managed to put
together a force of 1500 soldiers for a coun
terattack, the rebels had slipped out of Perquin,
leaving the town half-destroyed.
That is the way it has been going in El Salvador.
