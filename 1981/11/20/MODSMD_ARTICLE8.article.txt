Brasilia, Brazil (AP) â€” Former
U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger fled the University of
Brasilia in a police paddy wag
on Wednesday after 400 stu
dent protesters besieged an
administration building where
lie A'as lecturing.
Riot police rescued Kissinger
and about 300 other people af
ter the demonstrators
screamed anti-U.S. slogans,
burned an American flag,
lobbed eggs, tomatoes and
rocks at the building and bar
ricaded the doors for two
hours. One window was bro
ken but there was no other ap
parent damage. No injuries
were reported.
"He was remarkably calm
the entire time," said one U.S.
diplomat who was trapped
with Kissingerduringthe siege.
"The screaming and cursing
seemed to bother him a lot less

than it bothered me."
Many foreign diplomats as
signed to the Brazilian capital
attended the morning talk, in
cluding the deputy chief of the
U.S. Embassy, George High.
Kissinger's speech on in
ternational relations was at
times drowned out by students
who drummed on cans and
shouted "Kissinger go home!"
"We need food!" and other
protests against the United
States and Brazilian govern
ment.
Kissinger jokingly told his
audience the protests "make
me feel at home, but I've never
heard so much noise."
The university rector, Jose
Carlos Azevedo, apologized to
Kissinger in front of his au
dience, saying: "I have to con
fess my perplexity and to
apologize to Dr. Kissinger. We
have brought persons here

from various political lines and
something like this has never
occurred."
After Kissinger finished his
speech, he went into
Azevedo's adjoining office
along with several officials and
journalists, while most of the
audience stayed in the
auditorium.
Police with riot gear broke
through the student cordon
and rescued the dignitaries,
forming a human cordon
around Kissinger as he
emerged from the building.
High and Azevedo were
shoved into a police paddy
wagon by officers.
"I'm not going in there," Kis
singer said as he saw the police
vehicle and shouting demon
strators, but police forced him
to enter and the paddy wagon
left.
