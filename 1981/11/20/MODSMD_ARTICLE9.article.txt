Cairo â€” Laxatives played
,i key role in the assassina
tion of President Anwar
Sadat, according to the
Fgvptian authorities.
Khalid Islambolly, alleged
leader of the hit squad, is
said to have secretly admin
istered the laxatives to the
three soldiers assigned to
accompany him inthe mili
tary parade at which Sadat
was subsequently gunned
down.
The three soldiers had to
report sick, and Islainbolly
replaced them with three
accomplices.
With 24 persons going on
trial this weekend for the
Sadat assassination, the of
ficial case is that the killing
was the work of "pro
fessionals" masterminded
bv an Islamic ideologist.
He is named as Ab
dessalam Parag, an engineer
and religious pamphleteer.
I ie is said to have completed
preparations for the as
sassination last Sept. 28 and
to have supplied the weap
ons as well.
According to the prose
cution, the plotters en
visaged several venues for

the killing. One was Sadat's
native village of Mit Abul
Kom, where he went an
nually to meditate at his
brother's grave.
\nother was El Kanater,
where Sadat had a country
home, and a third was the
Sinai monastery of Saint
Catherine, where he was to
have tfone to pray on a
Moslem holiday.
The dress rehearsal for
the killing was on Oct. 6, a
few hours before the fatal
parade. The four-man com
mando group is said to have
met Parag, who gave them
their weapons and told
them the aim of the opera
tion: to kill Sadat and all the
other political leaders with
him on the reviewing stand,
ami then melt into the
crowd.
But only four persons
apart from Sadat were
killed. The then-vice presi
dent, Hosni Mubarak, owes
his life to his bodyguard,
who threw him to the
ground. Mubarak has since
been elected president of
Egypt.
