# The
						axe is back

It's all over now and what a trip it's
been.
Stanford, a team rated sixteenth
nationally at the beginnings of the
vear, has weathered a hellish 4-7 sea
son and come out with its nose clean.
The axe is bark on the Farm and it's
time to start over again.
The Card gridders were supposed
to have an offense capable of more
land destruction than James Watt but
instead found a defense for the first
time in years. John Elwav was sup
posed to challenge all comers for the
Ueisman Trophy but instead Darrin
Nelson crept into limelight and be
came history's No.l all-purpose
back. A lot of things were supposed
to happen this year but a lot of things
didn't, and in the end it became clear
that though Stanford had a lot of
potential, this was not the year of
Cardinal Red.
Which is not to say that the Stan
ford offense and John Elway haven't
come through this year. Vexed with
inexperience, they just waited too
long to draw. The Cardinal has
posted 187 points in the last four
names as the rest of the offense final
ly began to catch up to the
phenomenal Elway-Nelson connec
tion. Though Nelson, who carried
the team through the string with 13
touchdowns and an average of over
200 all-purpose-vards-per-game, is
leaving, the future looked bright af
ter Saturday's Big Game —even if the
season didn't.
A Big Game win can pick up any
one's spirits who understands the
aura, particularly a hie Big Game win.

But Stanford's 42-21 roll over the
Golden Bears did that and more. It
previewed and reviewed some of the
talent Stanford will have to rely on
next year.
•\t quarterback, John Elway went
18-27 for 245 vards and three TDs. At
halfback, Nelson's heir-apparent
Vincent White romped for 77 yards
and caught two touchdown passes.
Receivers Emile Harry and Mike
Tolliver looked infinetely more
capable than earlier in the season
and freshman defensive back Eric
Price intercepted one pass, broke up
another and quite literally knocked
out Cal wide receiverFloyd Eddings
with one of many savage hits.
Sophomore defensive back Vaughn
Williams had six tackles, junior line
backer Gary Wimmer had four and
sopohmore defensive back Charles
Hutchings pulled the game away
from Cal in the third quarter when he
turned an interception into a 14 yard
touchdown, making the score 28-7.
Stanford waited all season long for
things to jell and the last three games,
culminating with the big one,
showed that things finally have. The
offense was more diverse, the de
fense was more complete and the
team as a whole jumped on its oppo
nents' mistakes instead of commit
ting a plethora of its own. In many
wavs, the Cardinal has grown up.
" I want you to know I will probably
cry when I say goodbve to Darrin, but
we certainly have a capable back in
VVV," head coach Paul Wiggin said
Saturday. "Dot (junior halfback Mike
Dotterer) is coming along too and I


GIVF 'EM THE AXE! THE AXE! THE AXE! — The Cards gave Cal the axe
right in the neck, the neck, the neck; killing the Bears by a score of 42
—21 at last Saturday's "Big Game." Senior center John Macaulay, a

Artie Streiber/Ddily
tour year starter, his teammates, and band members carried the axe
back home to the Farm after a two year absence while the rain
drenched, but ecstatic crowd cheered on into the night.
