# The 						axe is back

It's all over now and what a trip it's
been.
Stanford, a team rated sixteenth
nationally at the beginnings of the
vear, has weathered a hellish 4-7 sea
son and come out with its nose clean.
The axe is bark on the Farm and it's
time to start over again.
The Card gridders were supposed
to have an offense capable of more
land destruction than James Watt but
instead found a defense for the first
time in years. John Elwav was sup
posed to challenge all comers for the
Ueisman Trophy but instead Darrin
Nelson crept into limelight and be
came history's No.l all-purpose
back. A lot of things were supposed
to happen this year but a lot of things
didn't, and in the end it became clear
that though Stanford had a lot of
potential, this was not the year of
Cardinal Red.
Which is not to say that the Stan
ford offense and John Elway haven't
come through this year. Vexed with
inexperience, they just waited too
long to draw. The Cardinal has
posted 187 points in the last four
names as the rest of the offense final
ly began to catch up to the
phenomenal Elway-Nelson connec
tion. Though Nelson, who carried
the team through the string with 13
touchdowns and an average of over
200 all-purpose-vards-per-game, is
leaving, the future looked bright af
ter Saturday's Big Game —even if the
season didn't.
A Big Game win can pick up any
one's spirits who understands the
aura, particularly a hie Big Game win.

But Stanford's 42-21 roll over the
Golden Bears did that and more. It
previewed and reviewed some of the
talent Stanford will have to rely on
next year.
•\t quarterback, John Elway went
18-27 for 245 vards and three TDs. At
halfback, Nelson's heir-apparent
Vincent White romped for 77 yards
and caught two touchdown passes.
Receivers Emile Harry and Mike
Tolliver looked infinetely more
capable than earlier in the season
and freshman defensive back Eric
Price intercepted one pass, broke up
another and quite literally knocked
out Cal wide receiverFloyd Eddings
with one of many savage hits.
Sophomore defensive back Vaughn
Williams had six tackles, junior line
backer Gary Wimmer had four and
sopohmore defensive back Charles
Hutchings pulled the game away
from Cal in the third quarter when he
turned an interception into a 14 yard
touchdown, making the score 28-7.
Stanford waited all season long for
things to jell and the last three games,
culminating with the big one,
showed that things finally have. The
offense was more diverse, the de
fense was more complete and the
team as a whole jumped on its oppo
nents' mistakes instead of commit
ting a plethora of its own. In many
wavs, the Cardinal has grown up.
" I want you to know I will probably
cry when I say goodbve to Darrin, but
we certainly have a capable back in
VVV," head coach Paul Wiggin said
Saturday. "Dot (junior halfback Mike
Dotterer) is coming along too and I


GIVF 'EM THE AXE! THE AXE! THE AXE! — The Cards gave Cal the axe
right in the neck, the neck, the neck; killing the Bears by a score of 42
—21 at last Saturday's "Big Game." Senior center John Macaulay, a

Artie Streiber/Ddily
tour year starter, his teammates, and band members carried the axe
back home to the Farm after a two year absence while the rain
drenched, but ecstatic crowd cheered on into the night.
don't think anyone at Stanford
would trade John Elway for any
quarterback in the country.
This year ended on a win streak
and that helps a lot. It helps our
coaches in recruiting. We're no
going to be losing that much at
all."
Nelson felt the three wins at
the end of the season were not
only valuable in that they give
the team momentum but also
that they let the team know
what Stanford's offensive ex
plosiveness really means.
"I think it'll do a lot of good,"
Nelson said. "It let our re
ceivers see what we are sup
posed to do. These guys are
going to be very good. I think
there will be four Andre Tylers
next year instead of none."
Stanford never lost control
of Saturday's game. The
Cardinal Red charged up the
field on its first possession to
s( ore on a drive highlighted by
a pair of long third down con
version passes from Elway to
Harry and Tolliver. Elway
scored on a quarterback sneak
from the one.
Cal stumbled in three downs
after the kickoff and punted to
Stanford, which mounted an
other threatening 51-vard
drive to the Cal three yard-line
whereupon White fumbled
and Bear inside linebacker
Chris Hampton recovered.
Berkeley then provided its
only threat of the day. After
scrambling out of the end zone
with two quick runs, quarter
hack J Torchio completed a 16-
vard pass to Tyrone Portee to
put the.Bears into Stanford ter
ritory at the 36 yard-line. A 15-
yard illegal receiver downfield
penalty put them back at the
Card 48. Torchio then wound
11p and lofted a 20-yarder over
Stanford defensive back Darryl

Grissum to wide receiver Ed
dings for the touchdown to
end the first quarter.
Nelson scored his two touch
downs in the second quarter,
one on a two vard run around
end and the other on a shoe
string catch of an Elway pass in
the end zone. That brought the
score up to 21-7 in favor of
Stanford going into the locker
room.
At the beginning of the third
quarter, the teams exchanged
possessions once before
Hutchings put the game out of
reach for Stanford. On second
and 20 from his own 22-yard
line, Torchio, under pressure
from four Stanford defenders,
allev-ooped a pass intended
for right back Mark Fun
derburk. Hutchings read the
plav exactly, jumped in front of
the ball and ran clear to the end
zone.
After Cal scored again on a
two-yard John Tuggle run,
Stanford could not move the
ball and had to punt. Slot back
Mariet Ford, deep for Cal, lost
the handle of the bouncing
punt however, and senior out
side linebacker Jay Summers
flopped on it at the Bear eight
yard-line.
On the first Stanford play,
Elway threw in the flat to White
who sprinted for the TD.
Cal scored again on an 18-
vard Torchio pass to Tyran
Wright in the fourth quarter
but failed to recover on the
ensuing onside kick, giving
Stanford the ball at the 50 yard
line.
A 17-yard pass to fullback
Rob Moore and two more
plays put Stanford at the Cal 22.
FI way hit White again in the flat
on the next play and the junior
flash broke three tackles as he
juked down the right sideline
to score the final points of the
game.

Head coach Paul Wiggin and
the Cardinal 11 did something
yesterday they might regret. A
42-21 victory over Cal means
only one thing — they started
messing with hig time football.
Saturday's game not only
tied the record for most total
points ever scored in a Stan
ford-Cal football game, it was
also the most pointsscored by a
Stanford team over Cal ever.
The last big victory was in 1930,
when the Indians destroyed
the Bears 41-0.
Once you start doing those
kinds of things, it's all over. It
means Wiggin gets to count
himself in with the likes of
Glenn "Pop" Warner, the
coach of that 1930 team.
But counting yourself in with
fellows like that means a few
small changes, which could
take all the fun out of it. For in
stance, from now on in
consistencies can't be toler
ated. The Cardinal can no long
er be the underdog. There
won't be any excuses for nar
row losses to Ohio State,
Purdue or USC. There can only
be annihilation.
This new image coincides
with a decision by the Univer
sity to define "Cardinal."
Cardinal, it turns out, is no silly
bird, it's a color. Which means
that the team can no longer be
the Cards, but must be singu
lar, "The Cardinal," the prov
erbial finely tuned and oiled
machine that steamrolls op
ponnets like "the Crimson
Tide" does, and is referred to as
an IT.
All the s'gns are there for the
Cardinal — there are indeed
strange goings on in the foot
ball program. In its last three
games of the season it rolled up
a point total that shatters all
Stanford scoring records — 147
points all told, the most back
to-back ever, against Oregon
State (63-9), Oregon (42-3), and
Cal. What that signals is a ten
dency towards balanced, con
sistent and powerful football.
Most important of all, what
we have here is a team that can
be.it the spread. But this team is
not yet so good that it can beat
the spread by much, a for
tunate thing for one happy
man who bet that Stanford
couldn't beat Cal by more than

26 points.
How much did he bet? "I
threw deep," he said, sweating.
At that point Stanford led
35-14. Moments later, how
ever, quarterback John Elwav
fumbled the ball away, ending
a consistent drive. "Anybody
who says there isn't a God is
gonna get killed by me," the
bettor announced. But Cal
punted in five plays. "Forget
what I said about God. I'm gon
na go see if Theder's bitten the
cyanide pill yet," he said.
If the offense continues to
roll next season — which it
almost assuredly will do with
Flway, who has already moved
to the top of the Pacific-10
touchdown passing list with 54,
and halfback Vincent White,
who has two full seasons be
hind him now — the Cardinal is
the sure bet. Flway ended up
with a handful of receivers who
made big points easy. The fact
is, they wore plain inex
perienced in the first half of the
season. Minus Andre Tyler,
thev were so intimidated that
14 points was all the offense
could hope for. But instead of
one Tyler next year, there will
be three in MikeTolliver, Emile
Marry (who turned out to be
frighteningly good after only a
few games) and Don Lons
inger.
Then there are the recruits, a
strange new breed unlike most
Stanford players of the past.
I hey are not the small, scrappy
guys who are great college ath
letes but rarely make it in the
pros, they are monster babies.
Freshmah Garin Veris is a prime
example. A defensive back this
season, he will probably play
tight end next year. At 6-foot-6,
240 pounds now, the coaching
staff thinks he can carry as
much as 270 pounds of weight
without losing any of his speed
and dexterity.
The Cardinal cannot be one
of those inexorable super
teams, a "Tide," until the de
fensive secondary catches up
with the offense; it can't out
score anybody if the secondary
gives up 21 points to a team that
needs a psychiatrist to figure
out its offense.
But in the meantime it can
beat those spreads and whip
those Bears, which makes some
people very very happy.

CFLFBRATION — Quarterback John Flway and halthark Darrin Nelson did this a lot Sat
urday on their way to Stanford's 42-21 victory over the Golden Bears. Haltback Vincent
White's antics, shown above on his way to the end zone, tell the story even better.
