# The 						Bridge initiates outreach program

Bridge staffers are out to
make themselves heard by
teaching students how to lis
ten. Through workshops in
communication skills, the in
itiators of the Dorm Outreach
Program hope to overcome the
obstacles which limit patron
age of the Bridge.
"We feel like we don't havea
very good reputation," said
program coordinator Bettina
Kurkjians. "People know about
us bv word of mouth. But it's
almost like we're in the shad
ows. They think we're earthy —
communal."
Another obstacle the Bridge
faces is the feeling among Stan
fort) students that " 'I am inde
pendent, and I should be able
to figure this out myself.' Peo
ple can solve their own prob
lems, but sometimes they just
need people to listen," said
Kurkjians. The increase in the
number of suicides last year
helped spur development of
the program, she said.
The workshops are fun-ori
ented, condensed versions of
the quarter-long counselor
training classes at the Bridge,
but the emphasis is on ex
change rather than advising.
The program was conceived of
Kurkjians and fellow staffers

Dan Merians and Paula
M< Nearney. They are now
training about ten Bridge vol
unteers who expressed interest
in leading workshops.
The coordinators hope that
the program will bring Bridge
volunteers together. "It could
potentially involve everyone,"
said Kurkjians. "One of the
highest sources of burn-out
among staffers is not having
enough to do."
Kurkjians estimates that the
Bridge receives seven to ten
counselling calls per week
among the large number of in
formation and referral calls.
"We would love to see our ser
vices used much more than
they are," she said. Resident as
sistants (R.A.s) have received
information about the pro
gram and more than half a
do/en dorms have requested
workshops.
About 15 freshmen in Rin
conada participated in the pro
gram's pilot workshop on Nov.
10. The participants alternately
ignored and listened to each
other as they played games de
sired to explore problems in
communication.
Body language, strong emo
tions, difficult situations and
getting someone to open up
were the main topics.
