## Editorial Help combat hunger 
### 
Every day, at least one-eighth of the world's
population goes hungry. That's a sobering
thought, and raisingthe issueatthe dinnertable
usually stymies complaints about Food Service
meals because the complainers feel too guilty to
gripe.
In the main, people do care about the
problem, and would like to help find a solution.
All too often, though, they do nothing because
they don't know how to get involved or decide
that the task is so huge that "one person can't
make a difference."
Fortunately, that is not so. There are several
effective ways to make concerns known, and
tomorrow's Davof Fasting activities feature a
number of practical options. Whether by
fasting, attending one or more of the discussions
and open meetings during the day, going to the
rally sponsored by the Stanford Committee on
Hunger, or even resolving to learn more about
the issueof world hungerthis yearthan lastyear,
participation is not an exercise in futility. It is a
valid — and meaningful — expression of
concern.
The individual does make a difference. While
a rebate of $1.30 a meal does not seem like much
when measured against the board rates here,

anyof the recipientsof the monev — Oxfam,
CROP, the Ecumenical Hunger Program,
SEARO, or Barrio Assistance (which aids
residents of East Palo Alto) — can make that
money go a long way. More important, these
groups can put contributions to work helping
people to become self-sufficient.
The decision of whether or not to fast
tomorrow is entirely personal: big, burlv men
won't guard serving linesand dorms shouldn't
ostracize residents who choose not to
participate. Whether people eat or not, though,
thev should be aware of the day's activities and
should make an effort to participate in some
wav.
Guilt should not be the motivating factor for
taking an active role in the fight against world
hunger; conversely, a "concern quotient"
cannot be filled in a single day. Morethan a little
concern is needed, forstarvation and
inadequate nutrition exist throughout the
world. But every single dollar and every single
blunt reminder count, and if the campus
community demonstrates its collective concern
tomorrowa great deal can be accomplished.
Maybe it's only a little bit. But every little bit
helps.
