## Unearth roots of Mideast problem to plant hopes for peace 
### 
Peace and stability have long been the
goals of the West's Mideast policy. Exactly
how these goals are to be achieved is now
the subject of heated debate as it has been
since the end of World War I. Most recently,
controversy over the AWACS question as
well as over the assassination of Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat seem to have
destabilized even more this region which is
of such great importance to the West. Still,
the roots of most problems in the Mideast lie
beneath this easily visible surface. In a search
for solutions, these roots must be unearthed
and analyzed before the specifics of any cur
rent developments can be examined.
The philosophy of the West as regards the
Mideast is a pragmatic one. Occidental
powers are little concerned with the issues of
Israel's continued existence, Palestinian
rights, Islamic tradition or industrial de
velopment except as these factors influence
the oil supplies of the West.
In stark contrast, nations of the Mideast
eye these problems with obvious concern

for the future of their cultures, their well
being and their strength. Their motives in
fact oppose our own. To the countries of the
Mideast, oil is a means of achieving growth,
stability and peace; to the West, these are
conditions only necessary if they keepthe oil
wells pumping.
One may well ask, "What is it then that is
responsible for the instability of the present
situation?" Anyone who answers that the
Arab-Israeli conflict is to blame is guilty of a
kind of over-simplification equaled only by
the 7th grade social science teacher who ex
plains that the assassination of Archduke
Ferdinand caused World War I.
The Mideast has catapulted out of the
Dark Ages into the 20th century in a matter
of a few decades. The transition has been
anything but smooth, and even now, it is far
from complete. Arab nations war among and
within themselves (e.g. North Yemen, South
Yemen, Iraq, Iranand Lebanon) asthey grap
ple for greater power much as the feudal
states of Europe did hundreds of years ago.

At the same time, industrialization, cul
tural Westernization and religious fun
damentalism add to the turmoil.
Further complicating the situation are So
viet moves into the area. Eyeing the
enormous oil reserves (basically Western
controlled), the Soviets have an interest in
anything which will destabilize the Mideast.
Their move into Afghanistan was clearly
more than defensive strategy just as their
continued support of "revolutionary peo
ple's movements" in nations across the horn
of Africa is far from altruistic.
It is necessary that the West balance these
threats by aiding its own allies. Nevertheless,
the importance of a subtle diplomatic ap
proach to the problem cannot be overem
phasized. The West does not want to co
lonize the Mideast any more than the Mid
east wants to be colonized. At no time must
the West's presence be allowed to become
the dominant force. As we saw in Iran, such a
strategy can only lead to disaster.
Early this month Jordan's King Hussein

met with President Ronald Reagan in Wash
ington. Their talks, although cordial, clearly
show the differences in Western and Mid
eastern thought. It was apparent, though,
that these differences are not irreconcilable.
While Western motives for the maintenance
of peace are not entirely altruistic, the fact
remains that peace in the Mideast is in the in
terest of both groups.
Regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict, many
things remain unresolved. The next few
months will see a crucial stage in the pursuit
of a final resolution. Israel is scheduled to
turn over the final third of the Sinai Peninsu
la to Egypt. It is expected that some progress
on the establishment of a Palestinian home
land will have to be made by that time. Al
though Israeli reaction to the recently for
mulated Saudi peace plan was heated, the
plan did include tacit recognition of Israel.
Rome was not built in a day and Rome was
certainly easier to build than a lasting Mid
east peace.
Both the Saudi plan and the latest Europe

an Economic Community plan call for recog
nition of the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization. This is clearly unacceptable. The
PI.O is a terrorist group which hds never
proven itself truly representative.
Another delicate task awaits presidential
advisor Philip Habib, who will most likely re
turn to Lebanon late this month to try to
strengthen the shaky cease-fire in effect
there. He will have to persuade the Syrians to
remove their surface-to-air missiles from the
Bekaa Valley. Otherwise, Israel has threat
ened to destroy them.
Essentially, yet another turning point has
been reached in the Mideast "crisis." The
events of the following months may lead to a
new era of instability and even catastrophe.
On the other hand, if the nations of the Mid
east and of the West co-operate to reach
greater levels of understanding, a new and
permanent peace may well appear on the
horizon.
