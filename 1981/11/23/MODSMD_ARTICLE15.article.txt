## Maintenance worker layoff hurts crew 
### 
We feel that the recent article (Dai
ly, Nov. 10) on the lay-off of a Tres
idder worker left out a major issue.
We members of the maintenance
crew at Tresidder feel that Rick
Hernandez's lay-off did an injustice
to more people than Rick.
Since Rick, Tresidder's only main
tenance helper, was laid off, we who
do the work at Tresidder feel that less
work is being done, and what work is
done costs more. We feel this is an in
justice to the students and communi
tv of people who support Tresidder
Union, and that it is a misuse of their
money.
Larry Davidson, assistant director
at Tresidder, says that he laid off Rick
because it is more cost-effective to
use Plant Services to do a lot of Rick's
work. First, we'd like to point out that
Plant Services isn't being used much
at all. The reason for this is that Plant
Services is not geared to handle the
dav-to-day "handyman" type work
that Rick handled as a maintenance
helper.
Before Rick was laid off, a group of
Plant Services journeymen (electri
cians, carpenters, locksmiths, etc.)
came to Davidson and explained that
they take care of the whole campus
on a priority basis. Because of back
logs and priorities they could not get

to Tresidder on a daily basis to fix
leaky faucets and change light bulbs
and fix the other "piddly" main
tenance problems of a heavily used
building like Tresidder.
An example of what they meant
happened two weeks ago. A pipe
broke at Tresidder Sunday night and
filled an elevatorshaft with sewer wa
ter. If Rick had been there he would
have pumped out the water by Mon
day morning. As it was, the foul
smelling water sat there till Plant Ser
vices came on Wednesday.
Since Plant Services isn't doing
most of the work that Rick handled,
how is it being done? First, some of
the work isn't being doneat all. Large
folding doors go unoiled, burnt out
lights go unreplaced and some pre
ventive maintenance isn't being
done. To us the place is clearly shab
bier than when Rick was around.
Second, some of the maintenance
helper work is being done by the
lead maintenance worker at a higher
cost. The lead man is paid about $12
per hour to do work Rick was paid
about $8 per hour to do.
Third, some of Rick's work is being
done by outside contractors. These
contractors charge about $100 per
hour for two electricians to do simple
maintenance work like fixing an out

let.
Finally, some of Rick's work is
being done by non-union people
such as managers. This violates our
union contract which says that man
agement cannot lay off a Stanford
union worker while her/his work is
done by non-union people. That
contract language is important to us
because without it management
could lay-off any of us to get rid of
the only protection we have: our
union.
So what we have here is that stu
dents are getting poorer main
tenance at Tresidder, it's costing
them more, and in effect their money
is being used to support a violation of
the contract.
What we also have here is an issue
which is an injustice to the minority
community. Before Rick's lay-off
there were three maintenance work
ers at Tresidder. One works only in
the bowling alley on a separate crew.
The other two, both minorities, cov
ered all of Tresidder. One of these is
the lead maintenance worker and
the other was Rick, his helper. The
lead maintenance worker, A.K. Lee,
won his lead position as a settlement
of an EFOC (Equal Employment Op
portunities Commission) discrimina
tion suit against Tresidder man

agement this year. Before Rick was
laid off Lee complained several times
to Davidson that the crew was short
handed. A few months later
Davidson, over Lee's protests, laid off
Rick. Now Davidson is blaming Lee
for work not getting done. So what
we have here is one minority worker
laid off and the remaining one heing
harrassed by a management with a
history of discrimination.
Finally, Rick's lay-off has hurt us,
the crew. We have been really short
handed. Last year the up-keep of
Tresidder improved "200 percent" as
the director of Tresidder put it. Since
Rick's lay-off it has been all downhill.
Because we are shorthanded,
Davidson has given some of us work
loads we can't begin to finish in eight
hours. We take pride in our work and
it sickens us to see Tresidder go this
way.
We have filed grievances on Rick's
lay-off, on the harrassment of Lee
and on the overloading of the crew
with work. All of these can take quite
awhile. In the meanwhile, we feel the
community should be aware of how
management operates at the Union,
and of the injustice it is doing.

crew at Tresidder feel that Rick
Hernandez's lay-off did an injustice
to more people than Rick.
Since Rick, Tresidder's only main
tenance helper, was laid off, we who
do the work at Tresidder feel that less
work is being done, and what work is
done costs more. We feel this is an in
justice to the students and communi
tv of people who support Tresidder
Union, and that it is a misuse of their
money.
Larry Davidson, assistant director
at Tresidder, says that he laid off Rick
because it is more cost-effective to
use Plant Services to do a lot of Rick's
work. First, we'd like to point out that
Plant Services isn't being used much
at all. The reason for this is that Plant
Services is not geared to handle the
dav-to-day "handyman" type work
that Rick handled as a maintenance
helper.
Before Rick was laid off, a group of
Plant Services journeymen (electri
cians, carpenters, locksmiths, etc.)
came to Davidson and explained that
they take care of the whole campus
on a priority basis. Because of back
logs and priorities they could not get

to Tresidder on a daily basis to fix
leaky faucets and change light bulbs
and fix the other "piddly" main
tenance problems of a heavily used
building like Tresidder.
An example of what they meant
happened two weeks ago. A pipe
broke at Tresidder Sunday night and
filled an elevatorshaft with sewer wa
ter. If Rick had been there he would
have pumped out the water by Mon
day morning. As it was, the foul
smelling water sat there till Plant Ser
vices came on Wednesday.
Since Plant Services isn't doing
most of the work that Rick handled,
how is it being done? First, some of
the work isn't being doneat all. Large
folding doors go unoiled, burnt out
lights go unreplaced and some pre
ventive maintenance isn't being
done. To us the place is clearly shab
bier than when Rick was around.
Second, some of the maintenance
helper work is being done by the
lead maintenance worker at a higher
cost. The lead man is paid about $12
per hour to do work Rick was paid
about $8 per hour to do.
Third, some of Rick's work is being
done by outside contractors. These
contractors charge about $100 per
hour for two electricians to do simple
maintenance work like fixing an out

let.
Finally, some of Rick's work is
being done by non-union people
such as managers. This violates our
union contract which says that man
agement cannot lay off a Stanford
union worker while her/his work is
done by non-union people. That
contract language is important to us
because without it management
could lay-off any of us to get rid of
the only protection we have: our
union.
So what we have here is that stu
dents are getting poorer main
tenance at Tresidder, it's costing
them more, and in effect their money
is being used to support a violation of
the contract.
What we also have here is an issue
which is an injustice to the minority
community. Before Rick's lay-off
there were three maintenance work
ers at Tresidder. One works only in
the bowling alley on a separate crew.
The other two, both minorities, cov
ered all of Tresidder. One of these is
the lead maintenance worker and
the other was Rick, his helper. The
lead maintenance worker, A.K. Lee,
won his lead position as a settlement
of an EFOC (Equal Employment Op
portunities Commission) discrimina
tion suit against Tresidder man

agement this year. Before Rick was
laid off Lee complained several times
to Davidson that the crew was short
handed. A few months later
Davidson, over Lee's protests, laid off
Rick. Now Davidson is blaming Lee
for work not getting done. So what
we have here is one minority worker
laid off and the remaining one heing
harrassed by a management with a
history of discrimination.
Finally, Rick's lay-off has hurt us,
the crew. We have been really short
handed. Last year the up-keep of
Tresidder improved "200 percent" as
the director of Tresidder put it. Since
Rick's lay-off it has been all downhill.
Because we are shorthanded,
Davidson has given some of us work
loads we can't begin to finish in eight
hours. We take pride in our work and
it sickens us to see Tresidder go this
way.
We have filed grievances on Rick's
lay-off, on the harrassment of Lee
and on the overloading of the crew
with work. All of these can take quite
awhile. In the meanwhile, we feel the
community should be aware of how
management operates at the Union,
and of the injustice it is doing.
