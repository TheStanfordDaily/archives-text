## Build workable architecture program 
### 
The article (Daily, Nov. 13) about
students not using the architecture
program at Berkeley creates the mis
taken impression that interest in this
subject is lacking at Stanford. Paul
Turner, who advises undergraduates
interested in this field, can speak of
the substantial interest there is in
architecture. There is no reason why
any graduate student at Stanford
shouldn't take graduate architecture
at Berkeley as we offer no advanced
degree in it here. Architecture was
separated from the Art Department
without the knowledge and consent
of this department. Architecture
died at Stanford for lack of budgeted
funds, not because the quality of the
instruction was poor.
Almost all of us live our lives in a
built environment, constructed for
the most part by contractors, not
architects. That is one reason why the
quality of our built environment is
generally so poor. At Stanford we

now offer only courses in architec
tural history which in part help our
students to understand why they are
being cheated in their environment.
We have all kinds of programs in en
gineering, urbanism and ecology,
but our students are not given the
chance to become architects and pull
toßether all of this knowledge
uniquely available in a university.
Stanford is the only great American
university without a program in
architecture.
There is money outside of the Uni
versity to draw upon for such a pro
gram, and there was when the pro
gram was cut. What was lacking in the
past was an administration that sin
cerely believed in architecture and
understood its importance. I con
tend that Stanford cannot financially
afford to he without a first-rate pro
gram in architecture. We spend hun
dreds of millions of dollars on what
for the most part is mediocre

architecture — architecture that too
often does not meet the standards of
the founders of Stanford. A modest
but top-notch program at Stanford
which advised on campus building
could pay its own way by saving the
University millions wasted on poor
planning and architectural design,
and help make what we get of more
consistent quality. I suspect that just
the legal fees we spend suing
architects who have built such things
as unstable hospital wings would pay
for the program.

Reference shocking
I find it shocking that Stanford Po
lice Chief Marvin Herrington refers
to the accosting of a woman as "play
ful" (Daily, Nov. 19).
However harmless the end result
of that "playfulness" may have been

in this particular case, I question a.)
the original intentions of the man;
and b.) the attitudes toward men and
women that make this type of action
evidently acceptable to Chief Her
rington. Considering this type of be
havior as merely "playful" implies
that women view such actions in a
lighthearted manner, and even that
they welcome such attentions.
In my opinion, there are not any
circumstances where this kind of
harassment of women is acceptable
— no matter how "harmless" it may
seem or how "unrelated to the other
cases (of rape on this campus)" it may
appear to be. If a woman feels threat
ened enough to file a report, the least
the police can do is give it serious
consideration and not dismiss it as
just another example of a woman ov
erreacting to a harmless and accep
table situation.
