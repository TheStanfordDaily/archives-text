## Andrew Bennett Ronnie: one big happy family 
### 
Our scene: Early evening at 1600
Pennsylvania. Nancy bustles from
room to room, dusting here, straight
ening there, a smile frozen on her
face as she mutters to herself. Ronald
sits at the Presidential desk, staring
vacantly out the window, lips moving
in a silent soliloquy. Is he rehearsing a
momentous speech, charting a new
course for modern civilization, af
firming the value of human life and
freedom? A word escapes him:
"Bonzo." He's reminiscing about his
movie days.
Nancy: "I've got to address the
convention for the terminally preppy
tonight and I haven't got a thing to
wear. And I'm afraid David's locked
himself in the bathroom again, just
when I need it. He says he's not com
ing out until you promise not to help
him with his homework any more."
Ron: "He can stay there for all I
care. It's as good a place as any for
him to learn the right way to trickle
down."
Nancy: "But Ronnie. .
Caspar and Alexander enter,
evidently in the middle of an argu
ment.
Alex: . . and I'm telling you that
if we eventualize a scenario such that
prioritization demands response
mode actions of an escalatory nature,
contingency predeterminations ne
cessitate a demonstrative nuclear
blast."
Caspar: "And I'm telling you that
NATO plans include no such op
tion."
Alex: "They do so."
Caspar: "Do not."
Alex: "Doso."
Caspar: "Do not, do not, DO
NOT!"
Ron: "Boys, boys, BOYS! There's

no need to argue. I think you're both
fundamentally correct, at least as far
as I know, though I'll have to ask
somebody who knows. Now I want
you to shake hands and make up."
Caspar: "Never!"
Alex: (chanting in tune) "Caspar,
the friendly ghost . . ."
Caspar: "Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!"
(Alex continues humming in tune.)
Caspar: "Do you want to know
what Alexander the Great was? I'll
tell you what he was, he was a raving
homo- . . ."
Ron: "BOYS! I won't have any
more of this. Shake hands and make
up right now or I'll . . ."
Richard Allen enters, rather
sheepishly.
Richie: "You wanted to see me,
sir?"
Ron, regaining some (but not all)
of his composure: "Yes, about this
Japanese thing . . ."
Richie: "I've already explained sir,
the Japanese have a custom of paying
gratuities for services by government
officials. What was I supposed to do,
explain that American law and cus
tom forbid such a practice?"
Alex: "You could have, but nooo,
you had to do the dirty thing, the un
derhanded thing, the guerilla war
fare thing. That's all anybody ever
wants to play any more, you, the
Salvadorans, the Vietnamese. I'm sick
and tired of these itsy bitsy guerilla
wars. Just once, I'd like to see a real
war, a man's war. I want to nuke
somebody! I wanna, I wanna, I WAN
NA!"
Ron: "Now, Alex . . ."
Nancy: "David's still in the bath
room and I have to wash my hair and
do my face and . . ."
Alex: "I'll get him out! Let me nuke

him out! Just a small nuke . . . Dicky
Have me the neatest exploding urani
um watch . . . teach that snotnose to
cut my defense budget. .
Ron: "That's enough! All of you,
go to your offices! I don't want to see
any of you come out until you've set
tled down. I'm going to get David out
myself!"
Alex, Richie, and Caspar depart
sullen, muttering to themselves.
Ronnie and Nancy gather at the
closed bathroom door.
Ron: "Listen here, young man, I
want you to come out of there right
now!"
David: "But I'm tired of playing
Trojan Horsie. And I'm tired of doing
all that homework. I don't under
stand all of those numbers flying
around. Speaking of the supply side,
you need more paper in here." (The
sound of a toilet flushing is heard
through the door.)
Ron: "David . .
David: "All right, all right, I'm com
ing." The door opens to reveal David,
eyes downcast. "I'm sorry."
Ron: "I'm afraid you and I are
going to have to go out to the wood
shed and talk things over, young
man."
In the background, the phone
rings. Nancy answers.
"Hello . . . yes, he's right here, just
a minute. Ronnie dearest, it's the
Washington Post. They want to know
about relationships in the executive
branch."
Ron: (sighing) "Just tell them we're
all one big happy family."
