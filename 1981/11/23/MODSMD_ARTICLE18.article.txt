## Of Berlin punks and subways 
### 
One big difference between East
and West Berlin: in East Berlin you
don't see punks on the subway. To
day the subway ticket woman on the
east side of the border asked me how
things in West Berlin were going. I
said, "Oh, fine."
She: "Nice and calm?"
Me: "Yeah, I think now it's pretty
quiet."
She: "All the punks still around?"
Somehow you wouldn't expect a
70-year-old woman in East Berlin to
ask you if the punks are still around
on the west side. But the fact is that
they are, especially on the subway at
night. I'm sure there are many levels
of "punkiness" ("punkity?"), and dif
ferent manifestations of these levels
in different cities. Nevertheless, a
short description of the "Berliner
punk in the subway" (BPS) is definite
ly in order.
I'm in a downtown subway at 11:30
p.m. To my left a 15-year-old person
in black leather pants and jacket.
She's got black high-top tennis shoes
that sav "The Dead Kennedies" on
them in white ink. A skinny type, her

face is almost skull-like; on her nose
white plastic cat-eye-rimmed glasses,
in her mouth really yellow teeth —
like she smokes a lot and drinks a lot
of urine. There's this thick, heavy
looking chain around her shoulder
and waist, a bandage around one of
her ankles. Short blonde hair,
greased up into the "porcupine
look." She takes out a cigarette and
lights up, underneath a sign that says
"No Smoking" in about 20 lan
guages. To her left, a man dressed in
opera attire; he looks snazzy in his
black tuxedo, and pretty drunk. Ber
lin. "A city of contrasts."
Back to the subject, though. BPS's
range from 13 to 40 years old, thin to
fat, hair color from pink to green,
clothing from jeans to hoop skirts.
They're usually not alone, and
they're always extremely intimidat
ing if they can at all help it; they usu
ally achieve this effect with relative
ease. I mean it can really be un
pleasant when this young punk's rat,
that he's been carrying in a neck bag,
jumps the sack and lands on your
shoulder. A regular zoo.

I look at myself in the opposite
window: hair back in a bun, glasses,
down jacket buttoned up all the way
(it started snowing today): I look like
some Literature student at the local
university; I feel like I must be a nerd,
but who could have ever guessed
that someday white cat-eye-rimmed
glasses, porcupine hair-dos, and in
jured limbs would be "in"?
By the way, why dwell on punks?
Because punks are an interesting re
sult (excrement?) of our Nuclear-
Neutron-H.Bomb-Society: Nihilism
at the intellectual level of a 2-year
old. And why concentrate on the
"Subway Experience?" Because the
subway is the place where punks get
a chance to confront all the squares
in the world and do their Spiel. I
mean what square in his/her right
mind would ever choose to confront
a punk? The subway as the ultimate
"vehicle" of the social scientist. I
wonder if the person who invented
the subway ever thought of that.
