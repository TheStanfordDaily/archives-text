# Native American enrollment down
## Neglect plagues recruitment 
### Richard Zimler 
Although the number of minority students enrolled
here has increased for the third straight year, significant
problems still exist in recruiting native Americans, a
group whirh ha* in fhn past suffered from ; recruitment
policy described by one University official as "benign
neglect."
Statistics from the registrar's office show a total of 62
native American graduate and undergraduate students
this year, a figure well below totals achieved in the
mid-70s, when as many as 77 native Americans were en
rolled. Furthermore, the only minority group to lose
ground in undergraduate enrollment this year was the
native Americans, whose numbers dropped from last
year's 38 to 37.
Comparison of other minority groups to native Ameri
cans in terms of enrollment reveals a significant prob
lem. In the last eight years, total black and Hispanic en
rollment has increased by approximately 10 and 35 per
cent. The number of native Americans has decreased
over the same period by approximately 20 percent.
George Clever, assistant dean of student affairs, who
serves as a liaison between American Indian students
and the Undergraduate Admissions Office, said the Uni
versity's traditional policy of "benign neglect" in the
area of native American recruitment was partly respon
sible for the low enrollment. "It's a matter of. . . not hav
ing a pulse on how it (recruitment) should be done," he
said.
Clever said the University graduated 14 native Ameri
cans last year and has only enrolled seven under
graduates this year. He said if this trend continues, native
American enrollment here would "soon be down to
zero."
He insisted that a more energetic recruitment cam
paign must be instituted to meet the particularities of
Americ an Indian culture. He said the University should
"beat the bushes to find candidates" and "get tuned-in
to the 'pow-wow' circuit." Active searching for can
didates should be done at "tribal conferences, major
rodeos . . . wherever Indians congregate," he said.
Clever said he is encouraged by the financial support
he will receive this year from the Undergraduate Ad
missions Office which will enable him to travel for two
weeks to centers of American Indian culture.
|ohn Bunnell, acting dean of undergraduate ad
missions st/essed the importance of this commitment:
"We've come a . . . ways, but we have to be really ag
gressive," he said.
Bunnell cited the scarcity of college-bound American
Indians and the poor preparation that such students re
ceive as the traditional reasons for low enrollment But
he said he sees increased competition in top universities

to attract college-bound native Americans as the most
recent obstacle to increasing enrollment.
In the past, the University has lost manv American In
dian, black, and Chicano students to Harvard, Yale and
t fii'u' »'f()n Univc*/sitir*s. Today, however, these* stucf&nt*
-ire also being lured away by the less prestigious univer
sities with enticements such as no-need scholarships.
'They're . . . pulled off by schools we've never over
lapped with," said Bunnell.
According to Bunnell, this competition has offset the
increased acceptance rate here for native Americans. He
expressed the hope that stepped-up recruitment would
give the University the edge in this competition.
Third year medical student Valden Johnson
Fodacheenie, who has served on the admissions com
mittee at the Medical School, S3id despite the fact that
the application pool has increased by 100 percent, the
enrollment — 7 students — has remained the same.
"We're doing as best we can," he said.
Fodacheenie said the increased application pool was a
result of work done by the admissions committee as well
.is the American Indian Physicians Association. He said
tin 1 biggest obstacles to enrollment are financial barriers
and the fact that "not many native American students
know about Stanford."
In regard to the higher enrollment of native Ameri
cans in the mid-70s, Bunnell maintained that many of
these students did not do well here. He said that Univer
sity policies in this area had to be evaluated. "We had to
ask ourselves if we were doing the school and the stu
dents a service by enrolling students who weren't mak
ing it,"he said.
He added that the poor preparation most native Amer
icans receive in their high schools puts them at a disad
vantage here, where remedial help is not emphasized.
Bui Bunnell said he does not believe that a more ex
tensive remedial program is the answer.
"I don't think that's Stanford's role," he said.
Clever said he would, however, like to see a more de
veloped remedial program. He said that poor prepara
tion would he less an obstacle to admission and success if
the I Jniversity maintained a wide-ranging developmen
tal skills program.
Native Americans "are a rural people with limited op
portunity," he said. "We're not talking about ability, but
opportunity."
Clever noted that most native Americans come from
the "lower echelons of economic strata" and have been
educated in "unstable" school districts. He pointed out
that such school districts are, in many cases, "budgeted
by the federal government, which has never been overly •
generous."
He said he felt inferior at first be
cause his high school education had
been different from most students
here. He said his "whole way of life
was totally disrupted" when he ar
rived, and that he had to overcome
the "first- initial shock" before he
could apply himself.
Kahn, who said he is doing fine
now, added that he thought the Uni
versity could do a "whole lot better
recruiting job." He said most native
American students don't know about
the Universitv and that information
isn't sent to reservation schools. He
said he found out about the Univer
sitv bv reading about Stanford sports.
Kahn said, "I think there are quali
fied students who are not actually re
cruited. If we did have more num
bers . . . everyone would feel a lot
better," he added.
According to Clever, such in
creased enrollment would not only
give a sense of community currently
lacking for native Americans here,
but also provide a pool of candidates
for further professional endeavors.
He maintained that graduating native
Americans is especially important
because of the need for qualified
doctors on reservations and lawyers
who can "hold their own in treaty
disputes."
Clever is not the only University of

ficial with an interest in the develop
ment of native American lawyers.
La Doris Cordell, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs at the Law School, also
expressed her concern:
"I've spent three years working on
this problem," she said. "I cannot
find American Indians." There is one
native American among the more
than 500 law students here, she said.
But Cordell is inspired by the suc
cess she has achieved in the en
rollment of other minorities, and is
beginning to bring her aggressive
and highly personal recruitment
practices to high schools where
American Indians are enrolled. She's
begun to spread the word toadrninis
trators that the Law School is looking
for American Indian students with
potential.
Cordell said, however, that finding
qualified native American students is
the "absolutely hardest" recruitment
task she faces. She, too, cited the rela
tive scarcity of native Americans and
the poor preparation they receive as
the major enrollment obstacles.
She said that although the Univer
sity is willing to "bend" on its eval
uation of standardized test results in
view of the deficient schooling, stan
dards could not be neglected. She
said there were very few native
American students who could meet
these rigorous admissions standards.

didates should be done at "tribal conferences, major
rodeos . . . wherever Indians congregate," he said.
Clever said he is encouraged by the financial support
he will receive this year from the Undergraduate Ad
missions Office which will enable him to travel for two
weeks to centers of American Indian culture.
|ohn Bunnell, acting dean of undergraduate ad
missions st/essed the importance of this commitment:
"We've come a . . . ways, but we have to be really ag
gressive," he said.
Bunnell cited the scarcity of college-bound American
Indians and the poor preparation that such students re
ceive as the traditional reasons for low enrollment But
he said he sees increased competition in top universities

to attract college-bound native Americans as the most
recent obstacle to increasing enrollment.
In the past, the University has lost manv American In
dian, black, and Chicano students to Harvard, Yale and
t fii'u' »'f()n Univc*/sitir*s. Today, however, these* stucf&nt*
-ire also being lured away by the less prestigious univer
sities with enticements such as no-need scholarships.
'They're . . . pulled off by schools we've never over
lapped with," said Bunnell.
According to Bunnell, this competition has offset the
increased acceptance rate here for native Americans. He
expressed the hope that stepped-up recruitment would
give the University the edge in this competition.
Third year medical student Valden Johnson
Fodacheenie, who has served on the admissions com
mittee at the Medical School, S3id despite the fact that
the application pool has increased by 100 percent, the
enrollment — 7 students — has remained the same.
"We're doing as best we can," he said.
Fodacheenie said the increased application pool was a
result of work done by the admissions committee as well
.is the American Indian Physicians Association. He said
tin 1 biggest obstacles to enrollment are financial barriers
and the fact that "not many native American students
know about Stanford."
In regard to the higher enrollment of native Ameri
cans in the mid-70s, Bunnell maintained that many of
these students did not do well here. He said that Univer
sity policies in this area had to be evaluated. "We had to
ask ourselves if we were doing the school and the stu
dents a service by enrolling students who weren't mak
ing it,"he said.
He added that the poor preparation most native Amer
icans receive in their high schools puts them at a disad
vantage here, where remedial help is not emphasized.
Bui Bunnell said he does not believe that a more ex
tensive remedial program is the answer.
"I don't think that's Stanford's role," he said.
Clever said he would, however, like to see a more de
veloped remedial program. He said that poor prepara
tion would he less an obstacle to admission and success if
the I Jniversity maintained a wide-ranging developmen
tal skills program.
Native Americans "are a rural people with limited op
portunity," he said. "We're not talking about ability, but
opportunity."
Clever noted that most native Americans come from
the "lower echelons of economic strata" and have been
educated in "unstable" school districts. He pointed out
that such school districts are, in many cases, "budgeted
by the federal government, which has never been overly •
generous."
He said he felt inferior at first be
cause his high school education had
been different from most students
here. He said his "whole way of life
was totally disrupted" when he ar
rived, and that he had to overcome
the "first- initial shock" before he
could apply himself.
Kahn, who said he is doing fine
now, added that he thought the Uni
versity could do a "whole lot better
recruiting job." He said most native
American students don't know about
the Universitv and that information
isn't sent to reservation schools. He
said he found out about the Univer
sitv bv reading about Stanford sports.
Kahn said, "I think there are quali
fied students who are not actually re
cruited. If we did have more num
bers . . . everyone would feel a lot
better," he added.
According to Clever, such in
creased enrollment would not only
give a sense of community currently
lacking for native Americans here,
but also provide a pool of candidates
for further professional endeavors.
He maintained that graduating native
Americans is especially important
because of the need for qualified
doctors on reservations and lawyers
who can "hold their own in treaty
disputes."
Clever is not the only University of

ficial with an interest in the develop
ment of native American lawyers.
La Doris Cordell, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs at the Law School, also
expressed her concern:
"I've spent three years working on
this problem," she said. "I cannot
find American Indians." There is one
native American among the more
than 500 law students here, she said.
But Cordell is inspired by the suc
cess she has achieved in the en
rollment of other minorities, and is
beginning to bring her aggressive
and highly personal recruitment
practices to high schools where
American Indians are enrolled. She's
begun to spread the word toadrninis
trators that the Law School is looking
for American Indian students with
potential.
Cordell said, however, that finding
qualified native American students is
the "absolutely hardest" recruitment
task she faces. She, too, cited the rela
tive scarcity of native Americans and
the poor preparation they receive as
the major enrollment obstacles.
She said that although the Univer
sity is willing to "bend" on its eval
uation of standardized test results in
view of the deficient schooling, stan
dards could not be neglected. She
said there were very few native
American students who could meet
these rigorous admissions standards.
Although the number of minority students enrolled
here has increased for the third straight year, significant
problems still exist in recruiting native Americans, a
group whirh ha* in fhn past suffered from ; recruitment
policy described by one University official as "benign
neglect."
Statistics from the registrar's office show a total of 62
native American graduate and undergraduate students
this year, a figure well below totals achieved in the
mid-70s, when as many as 77 native Americans were en
rolled. Furthermore, the only minority group to lose
ground in undergraduate enrollment this year was the
native Americans, whose numbers dropped from last
year's 38 to 37.
Comparison of other minority groups to native Ameri
cans in terms of enrollment reveals a significant prob
lem. In the last eight years, total black and Hispanic en
rollment has increased by approximately 10 and 35 per
cent. The number of native Americans has decreased
over the same period by approximately 20 percent.
George Clever, assistant dean of student affairs, who
serves as a liaison between American Indian students
and the Undergraduate Admissions Office, said the Uni
versity's traditional policy of "benign neglect" in the
area of native American recruitment was partly respon
sible for the low enrollment. "It's a matter of. . . not hav
ing a pulse on how it (recruitment) should be done," he
said.
Clever said the University graduated 14 native Ameri
cans last year and has only enrolled seven under
graduates this year. He said if this trend continues, native
American enrollment here would "soon be down to
zero."
He insisted that a more energetic recruitment cam
paign must be instituted to meet the particularities of
Americ an Indian culture. He said the University should
"beat the bushes to find candidates" and "get tuned-in
to the 'pow-wow' circuit." Active searching for can
didates should be done at "tribal conferences, major

.is the American Indian Physicians Association. He said
tin 1 biggest obstacles to enrollment are financial barriers
and the fact that "not many native American students
know about Stanford."
In regard to the higher enrollment of native Ameri
cans in the mid-70s, Bunnell maintained that many of
these students did not do well here. He said that Univer
sity policies in this area had to be evaluated. "We had to
ask ourselves if we were doing the school and the stu
dents a service by enrolling students who weren't mak
ing it,"he said.
He added that the poor preparation most native Amer
icans receive in their high schools puts them at a disad
vantage here, where remedial help is not emphasized.
Bui Bunnell said he does not believe that a more ex
tensive remedial program is the answer.
"I don't think that's Stanford's role," he said.
Clever said he would, however, like to see a more de
veloped remedial program. He said that poor prepara
tion would he less an obstacle to admission and success if
the I Jniversity maintained a wide-ranging developmen
tal skills program.
Native Americans "are a rural people with limited op
portunity," he said. "We're not talking about ability, but
opportunity."
Clever noted that most native Americans come from
the "lower echelons of economic strata" and have been
educated in "unstable" school districts. He pointed out
that such school districts are, in many cases, "budgeted
by the federal government, which has never been overly •
generous."
He said he felt inferior at first be
cause his high school education had
been different from most students
here. He said his "whole way of life
was totally disrupted" when he ar
rived, and that he had to overcome
the "first- initial shock" before he
could apply himself.
Kahn, who said he is doing fine
now, added that he thought the Uni
versity could do a "whole lot better
recruiting job." He said most native
American students don't know about
the Universitv and that information
isn't sent to reservation schools. He
said he found out about the Univer
sitv bv reading about Stanford sports.
Kahn said, "I think there are quali
fied students who are not actually re
cruited. If we did have more num
bers . . . everyone would feel a lot
better," he added.
According to Clever, such in
creased enrollment would not only
give a sense of community currently
lacking for native Americans here,
but also provide a pool of candidates
for further professional endeavors.
He maintained that graduating native
Americans is especially important
because of the need for qualified
doctors on reservations and lawyers
who can "hold their own in treaty
disputes."
Clever is not the only University of

ficial with an interest in the develop
ment of native American lawyers.
La Doris Cordell, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs at the Law School, also
expressed her concern:
"I've spent three years working on
this problem," she said. "I cannot
find American Indians." There is one
native American among the more
than 500 law students here, she said.
But Cordell is inspired by the suc
cess she has achieved in the en
rollment of other minorities, and is
beginning to bring her aggressive
and highly personal recruitment
practices to high schools where
American Indians are enrolled. She's
begun to spread the word toadrninis
trators that the Law School is looking
for American Indian students with
potential.
Cordell said, however, that finding
qualified native American students is
the "absolutely hardest" recruitment
task she faces. She, too, cited the rela
tive scarcity of native Americans and
the poor preparation they receive as
the major enrollment obstacles.
She said that although the Univer
sity is willing to "bend" on its eval
uation of standardized test results in
view of the deficient schooling, stan
dards could not be neglected. She
said there were very few native
American students who could meet
these rigorous admissions standards.
