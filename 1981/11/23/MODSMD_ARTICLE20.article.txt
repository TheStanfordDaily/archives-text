## Does Reagan administration exist? 
### 
"Wait just one minute — you're
trying to tell us that the Reagan ad
ministration doesn't exist?" we asked
with a great deal of hesitation.
"That's right, guys," our milkman
replied, "and what's more, using an
elementary philosophic pioof, I can
prove it to you."
Thus began a unique philosophic
experience last summer with our
milkman, Phred, a modern day self
styled Plato. The point Phred was
trying to show us was unbelievable —
or was it? Was it possible that the Rea
gan administration really did not ex
ist? Could it be that the entire admin
istration was no more than a night
mare, a hallucination, a creation of
Hollywood? We asked Phred to con
tinue, and to prove to us that James
Watt, Alexander Haig, David Stock
man, and even Ronald Reagan were
all completely fictitious.
"To prove something exists,"
Phred began, "we must set two pri
mary premises. First, to believe that
something exists it must first be per
ceived; second, it must be capable of
perception. By perception, I mean
factual information that comes via
your senses — sight, taste, sound,
smell and touch. Now, let's examine
our first premise with respect to the
Reagan administration."
One of us spoke up, " 'To believe
something exists it must first be per
ceived?' How does that relate to the
Reagan administration?"
"Well," Plired explained, "ask
yourself: what does the Reagan ad
ministration smell like?"
"I would suspect that it smells
foul," Tod offered, "but then again, I
have never really smelled it."
"Have you evei tasted the Reagan
administration?"
We shook our heads.
"And have you ever felt the cold
hands of the administration on the
back of your nec k, ready to choke
the life out of you if you can't find
work?"
"No," we repeated, with increas
ing disbelief over the logic that Phred
was employing.
"So," he replied, a certain degree
of triumph creeping into his voice,
"that's three senses down and two to
go. Sight and sound get a little tricky,
so try to stay with me. Now, have
either of you ever heard the White
House . . . speak, belt h, or cough?"
I spoke up, "No, I've never heard
them speak English, although there
are rumors that Alex Haig babbles in

tongues.
"But you've never heard the White
House engage in dialogue with any
one?"
Again we shook our heads.
Phred smiled and continued, "For
our final sense, have you seen the ad
ministration — out shopping for gro
ceries or getting a haircut? At the
ballet, or involved in an automobile
accident?"
"No again." We looked at each
other in disbelief, yet his logic was
believable. We never really had seen
the administration — even at the
beach.
"Thus, we have now proven the
first of our two premises. We have
never actually perceived the admin
istration through any of our senses."
"And that means that it doesn't ex
ist?!" Tod asked incredulously, smil
ing gleefully at the proposition.

"Not so fast, guys," Phred coun
tered, "We've only fulfilled the first
of our two premises for non-ex
istence; now we must determine
whether or not the administration is
capable of perception."
We were beginning to think this
was getting too easy: we could even
answer these questions. "Does the
administration perceive anything?"
we asked. "I would think that their
record in foreign policy completely
undermines any attempt to convince
us that the administration can per
ceive anything."
"But we still must go through with
the proof," Phred broke in, "Can the
Reagan administration actually hear,
smell, see, taste or feel anything?"
After a brief argument, we con
cluded that the administration had
none of the first four senses: it was
obvious from Nancy Reagan's ward
robe that the administration had no
taste, and we were sure that the ad
ministration could not see the effects
of rampant inflation and unemploy
ment. We were also sure that they

could not hear the pleas of the poor
and the elderly, although Tod re
marked, "there is a strong case that
the Nixon administration had ears in
the form of Sony cassette recorders."
"The Nixon administration is not
fair game in this proof," Phred re
sponded. "Regardless, you have just
told me that the present adminis
tration doesn't hear, smell, see, or
taste anything. So, it seems now that
the only thing holding the adminis
tration in the realm of reality is its
sense of touch, or feeling. I repeat:
does the Reagan administration feel
things?"
"I don't know," I pondered, as Tod
shook his head. "Can the adminis
tration feel pain?"
"I don't think so," Phred offered.
"At least not in the conventional
sense. If I were to surgically remove
your conscience, you would feel

pain. But the administration has no
conscience, thus I cannot remove it,
thus it cannot feel pain, thus it has no
feeling, thus it has no perception at
all. . ."
"My God!" we exclaimed, "You've
done it — you've just proven that the
Reagan administration does not ex
ist!
"Of course not," Phred said non
chalantly. "Do you seriously think
that the American people would
elect a washed up B-movie actor to
the Presidency — the most powerful
position in the world? Of course the
administration doesn't exist."
Still reeling, but with our faith in
our fellow Americans restored, we
queried, "Does this mean we don't
have to pay our taxes?"
"Not so fast, guys," Phred said, "All
I proved was that the Reagan admin
istration doesn't exist — the IRS is an
other story."
