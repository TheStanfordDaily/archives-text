## Exploitive environmental policies may make youth —vote 
### 
Washington — With his environmental
policies, President Ronald Reagan may ig
nite a fire that Democratic politicians haven't
been able to start: the powerful vote of the
baby-boom generation.
"It is my judgment that the one issue that
will bring them into the political fold,"
claimed pollster Louis Harris at a House sub
mcommittee hearingthe otherday, "and the
one issue they will respond to with a ven
geance, is the environmental issue."
Though they number a third of the popu
lation, young Americans have neither
aligned themselves with a political party nor
voted in large numbers. Fewerthan half of all
25- to 35-year-olds, for example, voted last
year compared to nearly 60 percent of all
other voters.
Having listened to the likes of Richard Nix
on and Jimmy Carter, it's no surprise that
many of our contemporaries act like voting

leads to leprosy. One need only mention any
well-known politicians and our friends' eyes
go glassy.
Reagan surely hasn't turned this trend
around. His administration specializes in
feuding and contradicting itself.
As a rule, most young Americans have fol
lowed the ragtime routine in Washington
simply for comic relief. But Reagan's en
vironmental policies haven't left them laugh
ing.
With a supporting cast of James Watt and
Ann Gorsuch, Reagan hopes to revise the
Clean Air Act to the satisfaction of business
and industry. Although the White House has
backed off from a radical rewrite of the 1970
law, it's quietly pushing some controversial
amendments.
Among other changes, the administration
wants to relax present emission standards for
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide from

automobiles. It also seeks to redefine "air
quality" to reflect the costs of attaining such
standards.
For the moment, the Reagan adminis
tration appears caught in a bind. On the one
hand it wants to help out its pals in private in
dustry; on the other it doesn't want to in
furiate environmentally sensitive voters.
But the public can't help but believe the
Reagan White House is more interested in
exploiting the environment than preserving
it.
In a recent measurement of James Watt's
popularity by the Rocky Mountain Poll, less
than half viewed him positively. In the West,
Reagan's Interior secretary isn't distrusted
merely by hard-core liberals; he breeds sus
picion among political conservatives, mod
erates and independents.
Certain energy issues, which affect the en
vironment as well, weaken Reagan's vote of

confidence. Western governors went on
record last week opposing any federal at
tempt to rescind tax credits for energy con
servation projects.
Already major corporations know the na
tion has even extended its concern for en
vironmental protection beyond clean air
and water.
"Pr ivate industry is being increasingly held
accountable for sustaining a level of health
fulness" at work, said Audrey Freedman, a
senior research associate at the Conference
Board, a business research organization.
While environmental awareness is on ev
eryone's mind, Harris warns that Americans
under 40 have the most at stake: .
" The group that clearly feels most strongly
about this are . . . people who . . . have not
come out to vote in as great numbers as the
eligible population," he said.
I uckily for Reagan, there will be no such

referendum on his environmental policies.
Young Americans won't get to vote yes or no
in 1982.
But if the Democrats can mobilize on the
president's weakness, they might hit political
pay dirt.
"The environment is, after Social Security
and the elderly, the best political issue the
Democrats have going for them in 1982,"
said Rep. Toby Moffett (D-Conn).
As much as baby-boomers need jobs and
promotions, they seem willing to sacrifice
some economic growth for healthy world
in which to raise families. Should they sense
that the president istampering with"mother
nature," they won't let the Republicans
forget it.
