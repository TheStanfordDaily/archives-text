## Poll says Haig's power struggle hurts US image 
### 
New York â€” A majority of
Americans who have heard or
read about Secretary of State
Alexander Haig's squabbles
with other Reagan cabinet
members think those disagree
ments have hurt American for
eign relations.
The latest Associated Press-
NBC News poll also said one in
three Americans believes Haig
is doing a good orexcellent job
as secretary of state, and one in
three think President Reagan is
doing a good or excellent job
handling disagreements
among his staff members.
Earlier this month, Reagan
called Haig and Richard Allen,
the president's national secur
ity adviser, into a private meet
ing after Haig announced that a
White House senior official
whom he did not name was
trying to undermine him as
secretary of state.
Also, the White House had to
issue a clarifying statement af
ter Haig said the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization had cont
ingency plans which included
the possibility of a nuclear
"warning shot," and Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger
said there were no such plans.
At a news conference where
he was asked about the dis
agreements, Reagan said:
"There seems to be too
much just loose talk going
around but it has been exag
gerated out of all reali
ty...There is no bickering or
hackstabbing going on. We're
a very happy group...The pic
ture that has been given of
chaos and disarray is a dis
service to the country and to
other countries and allies as

well."
In the poll, 30 percent said
they have not heard or read of
the disagreements between
Main and other members of
Reagan's staff.
Among those who had heard
or read of the disagreements
involving Haig, 56 percent said
they have hurt American for
eign relations, 40 percent said
they have made no difference
and 4 percent were unsure.
Thirty-three percent said
thoy think Haig is doing a good
or excellent job, 42 percent
said he is doing only a fair job,
16 percent said he is doing a
poor job and 9 percent were
not sure.
And 34 percent said they
think Reagan is doing a good or
excellent job in handling dis
agreements among his staff
members, while 35 percent
said fie is doing only a fair job,
23 percent said he is doing a
poor job and 8 percent were
not sure.
In comparison to the 34 per
cent approval rating for han
dling staff disagreements, Rea
gan's overall job approval rat
ing in the latest poll was 46 per
cent.
The results of AP-NBC News
[lolls can vary from the opin
ions of all Americans because
of chance variations in the sam
ple.
Of course, the results could
differ from other polls for a
number of reasons. Dif
ferences in the exact wording
of questions, differences in
when the interviews were con
ducted and different methods
of interviewing could also
cause variations.
