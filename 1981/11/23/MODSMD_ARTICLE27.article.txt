# Holidays look grim to Wall Street

### 
New York — No matter what the weather
brings, Wall Street is bracing for a long cold win
tor for the U.S. economy.
Though some of the official criteria for a "re
cession" have not yet been recorded in the
statisticians' books, almost every economist
agrees that prospects for the economy over the
next few months are poor at best.
"This recession has begun as we enter the all
important Christmas season, when 30 percent of
all consumer sales are transacted," Paul
Rothman, an analyst at Advest Inc., observed.
"With unemployment rising, this year's holi
day shopping season may be a bummer. Com
panies' cash flows to meet their bills and pay off
their high interest loans could fall short.
"If this is so, announcements of financial dis
tress may accelerate in coming months."
In the past week, the government revised its
figures for the gross national product to show
that the nation's output of goods and services,
after adjustment for inflation, rose at a 0.6 per
cent annual rate in the third quarter. Previously,
it had been estimated that GNP had fallen 0.6
percent in the July-September period.
F< onomists cautioned, however, that the
< hange should not be read as any sort of en
couraging news, since it mainly reflected an in
crease in estimates of inventory buildups,
Arid rising inventories right now are the sub
ject of a great deal of concern. As goods build up

in the pipelines of the economy, they tend to
discourage further production and encourage
layoffs.
Faced with such gloomy prospects, the stock
market turned in a mixed showing in the past
week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
dropped 2.95 to 852.93.
The pre-Christmas financial picture is by no
means all Scrooge and no Santa Claus. Open
market interest rates have fallen dramatically in
the past month, and the bond market, which re
sponds directly to interest rate changes, has
staged its strongest rally of the year.
Some actively traded bonds have, in a few
weeks' time, recouped roughly two-thirdsof the
losses they piled up earlier in the year.
The prime lending rate, which spent much of
the summer stuck at a near-record 20 ,/ i percent,
has since come down to the 16-Ipercent
range, and is considered likely to fall further
before long.
A few large lenders have even begun to lower
their mortgage rates, though rates on those
loans remain at steep levels.
A substantial drop in interest rates is normally
considered a potent plus for the stock market.
This time it hasn't worked out that way, ap
parently because stock traders have regarded
falling rates as a symptom of the rapid falloff of
economic activity.
