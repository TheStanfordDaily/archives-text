It seems every California-
Stanford water polo game is
destined for rainy weather
but Saturday morning's
drizzle couldn't drown the
Cardinal enthusiasm at de-
Guerre pool.
Before a packed crowd
and a sea of waving um
brellas, Stanford bulldozed
the hapless Golden Bears
18-5 to finish the regular
season with a flawless rec
ord of 28-0.
Furthermore, the game
marked the Cardinal's 31st
win in a row which breaks
the NCAA undefeated
streak record, snapping the
old mark of 30 set by UCLA
in 1969.
Beating Cal is always
sweet, but this victory was
especially so as six Stanford
seniors played their last
home match wearing the
Cardinal Red. All six seniors
— Jody Campbell, Brian
Felix, Chris Kelsey, Alan
Mouchawar, Bill Taylor and
Vince Vanelli — were in the
starting line-up showing
why Stanford has been the
dominate force in collegiate
water polo for the last four
years.
"Our seniors played real
ly well," head coach Dante

Dettamanti said after the
name. "This is the biggest
margin of victory we've ever
had over a Cal team and the
biggest this year over a
Top-10 team."
Stanford got off to a slow
start, but goals by
Mouchawar and James
Bergeson put the Cardinal
on the scoreboard midway
through the first period.
California then made its
only threatening advance of
the game when it scored a
penalty shot late in that pe
riod to bring the score to
2-1.
After that, Stanford
showed why it is well de
serving of its No.l ranking in
the national coach's poll.
During the next two quar
ters, the Cardinal blazed for
nine goals as opposed to
California's two.
Stanford scored from all
over the tank as the crowa
delighted to Campbell
razzle-dazzle shots, Taylor
backhands and the rocket
arm of Bergeson.
But with the Cardinal
leading 13-3 going into the
fourth period, the game
began to disintegrate into
something affectionately re
ferred to as "Jungle Ball."
The referees were forced to

callsevenejection foulsdur
ing the period to keep the
game in hand. Facing a 10-
goal deficit, the Bears could
do little but try to save their
pride, and the final score
read Stanford 18, California
5.
Dettamanti pulled his sen
iors out of the game one at a
time early in the fourth
quarter and each got a
hearty round of applause
from the partisan crowd.
When asked about the
area of Cardinal play he is
most concerned with at this
point, the man-down de
fense, Dettamanti said, "The
team played a lot better
than last game. We had
eight kick-outs called
against us and Cal only
scored on three."
When questioned about
the grossness of Cal play in
the fourth period the coach
added, "They were just frus
trated. There wasn't much
they could do considering
we had a 14 goal lead
through most of the fourth
period."
Final scoring for Stanford
was: Bergeson with five,
Campbell with three,
Mouchawar, Kelsey and Art
Strum with two apiece and
Taylor, Greg Lambert, Tom

Lampert and Mark Daly
each scoring once.
Bergeson now leads all
Stanford scorers with 70
goals. He is followed by
Campbell with 63,
Mouchawar with 47, Kelsey
with 41 and Taylor with 31.
Perhaps Stanford's most
amazing statistic this year
lies in first quarter scoring
where the Cardinal has pre
vailed by a whopping
106-19.
Stanford will carry all its
wins and lofty statistics to
the Belmont Plaza
Natatorium in Long Beach
next weekend fortheNCAA
Championship Tour
nament. Stanford has won
the tourney three times so
far — in 1976, '78 and '80 —
and is looking to be one of
the few teams ever to have
back-to-back cham
pionships.
The Cardinal will be
ranked No.l going into the
prestigious event. Other
teams represented will be
Long Beach State, UCLA,
UC-Santa Barbara, UC-
Irvine, UC-Berkeley. The
U.S. Air Force Academy and
Brown University.
Preliminary games will
take place Saturday, Nov. 28.
