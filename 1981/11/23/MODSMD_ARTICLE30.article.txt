# Big Game celebration tinted with nostalgia for Card seniors
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
One month ago, Stanford
was muddling through one of
the most agonizingly slow sea
sons it has ever experienced.
Now, after three straight wins,
it's over, and for some special
Stanford seniors, so are their
long careers as part of the Stan
ford Cardinal.
This special group, which
ended a disapointing season
almost magically with a 42-21
Big Game victory over Califor
nia, wouldn't have had it any
other way.
"There was no other way to
end it," explained senior de
fensive back Rodney Gilmore.
"Not only to beat Cal, but to
run them out ot the park. This
means so much to this class''
Along with Gilmore, Pete St.
Geme, Pete Taylor, Phil
Mahoney, Mark Mordell,
Craig Awbrey, Mike Taylor, Jeff
Haile, )ohn Macaulay, Craig
Zellmer, Mike Neill, Jay Sum
mers, Darrin Nelson, Tom Hall,
Doug Rogers, Phil Wilson, Jim
Dykstra, Andre Tyler and Dave
Morze suited up for the last
time as a Cardinal Saturday.
For these and others, the Big
Game win made the season all
worthwhile.
"It was a great win," said
quarterback Wilson, "This

game was really the only rea
son I came back this year. We
were young and awfully inex
perienced at the beginning of
the season, but it's rewarding
to see that we put it all togeth
er."
Defensive tackle Doug
Rogers , who will play in the
Senior and Blue-Gray Bowls on
his way to a probable pro
fessional football career,
echoed this sentiment.
"It's just a great feeling to
win this game. It would be nice
to be going somewhere after
the season, but you have to
look at what you've got and
make the best of it. This is the
happiest I've ever been about a
football game."
Darrin Nelson, who also
plans on extending his career
to include the National Foot
ball League, will be missed the
most by the Stanford com
munity.
"At our senior banquet in
February," Stanford head
coach Paul Wiggin said, "I'll
probably cry when I say good
bye to Darrin Nelson. I don't
know for sure, but I think (Pres
ident) Donald Kennedy may do
the same because of what Dar
rin means to this university."
Nelson picked his way
through the locker room slow

ly after the game. He was
hugged by players, fans and
coaches, including a teary
eyed offensive coordinator jim
Fassel who simply said, "I'm
gonna miss you Darrin."
Nelson then reflected on his
brilliant Stanford career.
"Looking back on what I've
done," he said, "I think Stan
ford was the perfect place for
me and my abilities."
For many of the seniors, the
end of the season and possibly
the end of a career, caused
mixed emotions.
"In a way, it's good to be
done with it," said Awbrey,
"but it's like losing a friend. I've
been around football all my life
and now I feel like I'm losing
my best friend. It wasespecially
nice to end it the way we did.
Before the game, Wiggin told
us that when we look back, the
one thing we'll remember is
beating Cal. We won't look
back and remember our 4-7
record, we'll look back and re
member beating Cal."
Linebacker Morze also had
mixed emotions. "I wish the
season would have gone bet
ter," he said, "but I'm happy
we finished so strong and that
the defense accomplished so
much. I guess it hasn't sunk in
that it's all over."

Cornerback Mike Taylor,
who was named to the Pacif
ic-! 0 Conference All-Academ
ic team, stressed the im
portance of ending his career
with a Big Game win.
"It's more than just 'nice' to
end the season with a victory
over Cal," he said. "We could
be 0-10 and the Big Game

would still be important."
Linebacker Tom Hall was
elated to end his career with a
Big Game win. "There is no
other feeling like it," Hall said.
"If pro football wants me, I'll
play, but I'm satisfied to end it
just like this."
For one player, it's simply

hard to leave. Center John
Macaulay led the offensive line
though a stage of great im
provement and that has meant
a lot to him.
"Any time you're depictedas
a leader," he said, "it makes
you feel a little bit better be
cause there is a lot of personal

pride involved. It was a great
way to end the season â€” we
buried the Bears. I just wish I
had two or three more years
here because I believe in the
system and I think this team is
going places. We ended the
season with three victories
which is a tribute to Paul Wig
gin and that's all."
