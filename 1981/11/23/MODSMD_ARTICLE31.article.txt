# Spikers end best-ever regular season
## 
### Lisa Stern 
The regular season is over.
And now the waiting begins for
the Stanford women spikers.
The Cardinal closed out its
regular fall schedule against
Fresno State on the road as the
squad battled the beleaguered
lady Bulldogs to a three-game
victory Friday night, 15-6,
15-12, 16-14.
The win, which advanced the
Card season record under
head coach Fred Sturm to 31-13
overall, gave the volleyball
team its best record ever. Stan
frod finished in second place in
the Northern California Athlet
ic Conference by posting a 9-2
league mark. The conference
title went to the undefeated
University of Pacific for the
third straight year.
But the Cardinal and Tigers

await the Dec. 1 announce
ment of the 20 teams chosen to
compete in post-season play
and vie for a chance at the na
tional title.
Stanford gained immediate
control of the play against
Fresno, taking advantage of the
Bulldog's weak pasing skills,
the Card was able to string
points together by capitalizing
on an effective service strategy.
"We just came out playing
well and took control of the
match early on," said Sturm
simply.
Fresno came back in game
two, however, by gaining more
regulation in passing to keep
the scoring totals close. Then,
with the teams tied at 12-12, the
Card came up with three good
defensive plays to take the con
test 15-12 and a two-game lead

in the match.
Still the Bulldogs tried to
bark back, and the squads al
ternated scoring throughout
much of the third game. The
Fresno team took the upper
hand 14-12 before the Cardinal
held off inatch point and
scored four unanswered shots
to squeeze by their opponents
16-14.
"What game three really
amounted to was a demonstra
tion by us that we could play
our best volleyball when we
needed to, " explained Sturm.
Freshman Deidra Dvorak
came off the Cardinal bench to
contribute heavily to the win
ning efort from her setter spot.
Sturm called her performance
"the best match she has ever

played for us in her young ca
reer." Senior outside hitter
Chris Anderson and setter Jan
Linden again played well and
demonstrated the skills and
leadership ability which have
made them such valuable as
sets for the squad.
The team now begins a one
wek hiatus before the an
nounced selection of the
squads rhosen to advance to
Regional competition. A sev
en-man national committee
composed of two athletic di
rectors and five coaches will
convene Nov. 30 to narrow
down the field of post-season
hopefuls to 20 contenders. The
criteria used to determine their
selections will include strength
of schedule, record, and na
tional ranking.
