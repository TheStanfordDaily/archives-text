Reagan prepares first veto
Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
locked in dispute over domestic budget cuts,
vowed to veto a compromise spending bill
passed yesterday by Congress and summoned
his Cabinet to an emergency meeting this
morning to begin shutting down nonessential
government functions.
The House, brushing aside Reagan's veto
threat, endorsed the compromise Sunday and
sent it to the Senate where approval came 46-
to-39. The bill then went to the White House.
The weekend maneuvering left the govern
ment without spending authority heading into
the work week.
Reagan was expected to wield his veto — the
first of his presidency — at about 7:30 a.m. EST,
and White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
he would tell his Cabinet at 8 a.m. to order em
ployes they don't absolutely need to "come to
work, cancel meetings, lock the safe, cutout the
lights and leave."
Speakes estimated that 400,000 of the 2.9-mil
lion federal employees could be furloughed
without pay by the end of the business day
tomorrow. However, Congress could forestall
such sweeping impact today by setting aside its
compromise and approving a simple extention
of lapsed spending legislation.
Reagan said he preferred the extention to the
congressional compromise.
Reagan said Congress' $428 billion spending
plan amounted to "lavish deficit spending,"
and he complained: "This is no way to run a rail
road."
Out of all those billions, Reagan and Con
gress were haggling about $2 billion. House
Democratic Leader ]im Wright said he didn't
know why Reagan would veto the measure,
"unless the president simply wants the theatrics
of bringing the government to a halt."
Brezhnev avoids protestors
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev arrived in Bonn yesterday for
talks with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt that are expected to have a major im
pact on East-West nuclear arms policies.
Touching down at the airport here in the ear
ly evening, Brezhnev came late enough to miss
tens of thousands of demonstrating West Ger
mans, Afghans and Soviet exiles who had
massed in downtown Bonn to protest Moscow's
arms- and development-aid policies and the in
vasion two years ago of Afghanistan.
The focal point of the four-day visit, during
which Schmidt and Brezhnev are scheduled to
meet formally three times, including once
without aides, will be how to curb European
based nuclear weapons. Schmidt and other
West European leaders face substantial public
opposition to North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion plans to station new Pershing II and cruise
medium-range nuclear missiles in their coun
tries.
The two leaders rode together from the air
port to Gvmnich Castle, 30 miles outside Bonn,
where Brezhnev is staying. West German tele
vision showed them, with West German For
eign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, sitting
down for drinks in the castle.
At the airport Sunday night to greet
Brezhnev, who will be 75 next month, were sev
eral thousand members of the West German
Communist Party and other leftist groups. They
carried banners declaring that Brezhnev had

come on a mission of peace and good will and
opposing nuclear weapons and nuclear bases,
meaning U.S. bases in West Germany.
This is Schmidt's sixth meeting with Brezhnev
— the most of any major Western leader. In pre
paring for the visit, Schmidt consulted with oth
er kev Western alliance officials, including Brit
ish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was
in Bonn last week, and President Ronald Rea
gan, with whom Schmidt spoke by phone Satur
day night.
With U.S.-Soviet negotiations on weapons set
to begin Nov. .30 in Geneva, Schmidt has said he
would explain the Western position to
Brezhnev and search for common East-West
ground. Reagan's offer last week to cancel the
U.S. deployment if the Soviets agreed to dis
mantle their new and old medium-range, land
based missiles has strengthened Schmidt's hand
in the talks here and will be the basis for his con
versations with Brezhnev. The Soviets have
termed Reagan's proposal a propaganda ploy.
The visit — Brezhnev's first to the West since
the invasion of Afghanistan and only his third
trip abroad since then — has obvious advan
tages for the Soviets, who are expected to use
West Germany as a platform to further their
campaign against the planned U.S. deploy
ment.
Several demonstrations against Brezhnev's
visit were held here over the weekend.
Ulster braces for protest
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The security
forces in the troubled province of Ulster braced
themselves last night for the widespread loyalist
demonstration scheduled for today.
All police leave was canceled and community
leaders appealed to the populace to remain
calm and to avoid violence.
After uncovering five pounds of explosives in
a Protestant area, the police said that they were
worried that some loyalists might plan to com
mit violent acts today.
Some 40 demonstrations were scheduled to
take place across Ulster with the major ones set
for Belfast in midafternoon.
A work stoppage was originally called for by
the Rev. Lan Paisley, a member of Parliament
and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, in
a protest against the death of fellow Member of
Parliament, the Rev. Robert Bradford, at the
hands of the Irish Republican Army eight days
ago.
But Paisley's protest was also directed against
the policies of the government of Margaret
Thatcher, who he charges has been too easy on
the IR A and has been "selling out" Ulster in her
talks with Republic of Ireland Prime Minister
Garret Fitzgerald.
Other Protestant groups at first decided not
to support the Paisley call for a day-long work
stoppage on the ground that it would serve no
useful purpose.
Yesterday, Archbishop John Armstrong, of
the Anglican Church of Ireland, declared that
he was against stopping work because it would
"plav into the hands of the IRA."
But after some days of consultation, other
Protestants have decided to hold their own
demonstration.
House downs salary hike
Washington — The House of Representatives
pay increase went down to defeat yesterday,
and along with it the hopes of some 46,000 fed
eral executives for a long-delayed salary boost.

Without debate, the House disagreed with a
conference committee report which had en
dorsed a 4.8 percent salary raise for House
members and government executives.
The two had been linked together during the
conference, but the House was reluctant to face
the issue of raising its own members' salaries
with an election vear coming up.
The pav increase for House members had
been unexpectedly rammed through a meeting
of House-Senate conferees at midnight Friday
just before the weary members headed for a
nightlv recess.
It was proposed by Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.) as
an amendment to the Senate version of a conti
nuing resolution that had included only the pay
raise for federal executives. Linking the two vir
tually assured their defeat, membersagreed lat
er.
Fazio argued that House members deserved a
pay increase, regardless of whether the senators
took one or not because the Senate had im
proved its compensation by lifting the ceiling
on honoraria they can receive for speeches and
other outside activities.
It would have raised House members' salaries
from $60,663 to $63,574 and created the unusual
situation of House members getting higher
salaries than senators.
Thousands remember Franco
Madrid — Almost 300,000 Spaniards, offering
the Fascist salute and cheering the leader of last
February's failed right-wing coup, packed a
square in front of the Royal Palace Sunday to
mark the sixth anniversary of the death of dic
tator Gen. Francisco Franco.
Rally organizers, emboldened by a spate of
rumors in recent days predicting another coup
attempt, called the turnout the biggest since
Franco, Spain's iron-fisted ruler for 36 years,
died on Nov. 20,1975.
The militant right-wingers defied a govern
ment order prohibiting the use of military uni
forms and the Spanish flag at political rallies.
Dressed in the blue shirts of the Fascist-style
Falange party and waving tens of thousands of
the red-and-yellow flags, they shouted for free
dom for Lt. Col. AntonioTejero, the Civil Guard
officer who led the storming of Parliament nine
months ago in a vain bid to overthrow the con
stitutional monarchy government.
Raimundo Fernandez Cuesta, chief of the
Falange party, said the rally was not a routine
commemoration, "but a national affirmation,
necessary because Spain is in danger of destruc
tion."
The civil governor's office put the crowd esti
mate at 275,000 in Orient Square in front of the
Roy.il Palace in downtown Madrid. But an of
ficial said thousands more were jammed out
side the square to hear calls for a return to Fran
coism
The crowd interrupted speakers several times
to chant Franco's name. They made no mention
of his successor, King )uan Carlos, who put
down the Feb. 23 coup attempt. The king was
outside Madrid in his Zarzuela Palace resi
dence. Sunday was the sixth anniversary of his
ascension to the throne.
Today's weather
Increasing cloudiness, highs to the upper 50s
and 60s, chances of rain increasing to 60 percent
tonight. Winds 10 to 20 mph.

mantle their new and old medium-range, land
based missiles has strengthened Schmidt's hand
in the talks here and will be the basis for his con
versations with Brezhnev. The Soviets have
termed Reagan's proposal a propaganda ploy.
The visit — Brezhnev's first to the West since
the invasion of Afghanistan and only his third
trip abroad since then — has obvious advan
tages for the Soviets, who are expected to use
West Germany as a platform to further their
campaign against the planned U.S. deploy
ment.
Several demonstrations against Brezhnev's
visit were held here over the weekend.
Ulster braces for protest
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The security
forces in the troubled province of Ulster braced
themselves last night for the widespread loyalist
demonstration scheduled for today.
All police leave was canceled and community
leaders appealed to the populace to remain
calm and to avoid violence.
After uncovering five pounds of explosives in
a Protestant area, the police said that they were
worried that some loyalists might plan to com
mit violent acts today.
Some 40 demonstrations were scheduled to
take place across Ulster with the major ones set
for Belfast in midafternoon.
A work stoppage was originally called for by
the Rev. Lan Paisley, a member of Parliament
and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, in
a protest against the death of fellow Member of
Parliament, the Rev. Robert Bradford, at the
hands of the Irish Republican Army eight days
ago.
But Paisley's protest was also directed against
the policies of the government of Margaret
Thatcher, who he charges has been too easy on
the IR A and has been "selling out" Ulster in her
talks with Republic of Ireland Prime Minister
Garret Fitzgerald.
Other Protestant groups at first decided not
to support the Paisley call for a day-long work
stoppage on the ground that it would serve no
useful purpose.
Yesterday, Archbishop John Armstrong, of
the Anglican Church of Ireland, declared that
he was against stopping work because it would
"plav into the hands of the IRA."
But after some days of consultation, other
Protestants have decided to hold their own
demonstration.
House downs salary hike
Washington — The House of Representatives
pay increase went down to defeat yesterday,
and along with it the hopes of some 46,000 fed
eral executives for a long-delayed salary boost.

Without debate, the House disagreed with a
conference committee report which had en
dorsed a 4.8 percent salary raise for House
members and government executives.
The two had been linked together during the
conference, but the House was reluctant to face
the issue of raising its own members' salaries
with an election vear coming up.
The pav increase for House members had
been unexpectedly rammed through a meeting
of House-Senate conferees at midnight Friday
just before the weary members headed for a
nightlv recess.
It was proposed by Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.) as
an amendment to the Senate version of a conti
nuing resolution that had included only the pay
raise for federal executives. Linking the two vir
tually assured their defeat, membersagreed lat
er.
Fazio argued that House members deserved a
pay increase, regardless of whether the senators
took one or not because the Senate had im
proved its compensation by lifting the ceiling
on honoraria they can receive for speeches and
other outside activities.
It would have raised House members' salaries
from $60,663 to $63,574 and created the unusual
situation of House members getting higher
salaries than senators.
Thousands remember Franco
Madrid — Almost 300,000 Spaniards, offering
the Fascist salute and cheering the leader of last
February's failed right-wing coup, packed a
square in front of the Royal Palace Sunday to
mark the sixth anniversary of the death of dic
tator Gen. Francisco Franco.
Rally organizers, emboldened by a spate of
rumors in recent days predicting another coup
attempt, called the turnout the biggest since
Franco, Spain's iron-fisted ruler for 36 years,
died on Nov. 20,1975.
The militant right-wingers defied a govern
ment order prohibiting the use of military uni
forms and the Spanish flag at political rallies.
Dressed in the blue shirts of the Fascist-style
Falange party and waving tens of thousands of
the red-and-yellow flags, they shouted for free
dom for Lt. Col. AntonioTejero, the Civil Guard
officer who led the storming of Parliament nine
months ago in a vain bid to overthrow the con
stitutional monarchy government.
Raimundo Fernandez Cuesta, chief of the
Falange party, said the rally was not a routine
commemoration, "but a national affirmation,
necessary because Spain is in danger of destruc
tion."
The civil governor's office put the crowd esti
mate at 275,000 in Orient Square in front of the
Roy.il Palace in downtown Madrid. But an of
ficial said thousands more were jammed out
side the square to hear calls for a return to Fran
coism
The crowd interrupted speakers several times
to chant Franco's name. They made no mention
of his successor, King )uan Carlos, who put
down the Feb. 23 coup attempt. The king was
outside Madrid in his Zarzuela Palace resi
dence. Sunday was the sixth anniversary of his
ascension to the throne.

Reagan prepares first veto
Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
locked in dispute over domestic budget cuts,
vowed to veto a compromise spending bill
passed yesterday by Congress and summoned
his Cabinet to an emergency meeting this
morning to begin shutting down nonessential
government functions.
The House, brushing aside Reagan's veto
threat, endorsed the compromise Sunday and
sent it to the Senate where approval came 46-
to-39. The bill then went to the White House.
The weekend maneuvering left the govern
ment without spending authority heading into
the work week.
Reagan was expected to wield his veto — the
first of his presidency — at about 7:30 a.m. EST,
and White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
he would tell his Cabinet at 8 a.m. to order em
ployes they don't absolutely need to "come to
work, cancel meetings, lock the safe, cutout the
lights and leave."
Speakes estimated that 400,000 of the 2.9-mil
lion federal employees could be furloughed
without pay by the end of the business day
tomorrow. However, Congress could forestall
such sweeping impact today by setting aside its
compromise and approving a simple extention
of lapsed spending legislation.
Reagan said he preferred the extention to the
congressional compromise.
Reagan said Congress' $428 billion spending
plan amounted to "lavish deficit spending,"
and he complained: "This is no way to run a rail
road."
Out of all those billions, Reagan and Con
gress were haggling about $2 billion. House
Democratic Leader ]im Wright said he didn't
know why Reagan would veto the measure,
"unless the president simply wants the theatrics
of bringing the government to a halt."
Brezhnev avoids protestors
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev arrived in Bonn yesterday for
talks with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt that are expected to have a major im
pact on East-West nuclear arms policies.
Touching down at the airport here in the ear
ly evening, Brezhnev came late enough to miss
tens of thousands of demonstrating West Ger
mans, Afghans and Soviet exiles who had
massed in downtown Bonn to protest Moscow's
arms- and development-aid policies and the in
vasion two years ago of Afghanistan.
The focal point of the four-day visit, during
which Schmidt and Brezhnev are scheduled to
meet formally three times, including once
without aides, will be how to curb European
based nuclear weapons. Schmidt and other
West European leaders face substantial public
opposition to North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion plans to station new Pershing II and cruise
medium-range nuclear missiles in their coun
tries.
The two leaders rode together from the air
port to Gvmnich Castle, 30 miles outside Bonn,
where Brezhnev is staying. West German tele
vision showed them, with West German For
eign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, sitting
down for drinks in the castle.
At the airport Sunday night to greet
Brezhnev, who will be 75 next month, were sev
eral thousand members of the West German
Communist Party and other leftist groups. They
carried banners declaring that Brezhnev had

come on a mission of peace and good will and
opposing nuclear weapons and nuclear bases,
meaning U.S. bases in West Germany.
This is Schmidt's sixth meeting with Brezhnev
— the most of any major Western leader. In pre
paring for the visit, Schmidt consulted with oth
er kev Western alliance officials, including Brit
ish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was
in Bonn last week, and President Ronald Rea
gan, with whom Schmidt spoke by phone Satur
day night.
With U.S.-Soviet negotiations on weapons set
to begin Nov. .30 in Geneva, Schmidt has said he
would explain the Western position to
Brezhnev and search for common East-West
ground. Reagan's offer last week to cancel the
U.S. deployment if the Soviets agreed to dis
mantle their new and old medium-range, land
based missiles has strengthened Schmidt's hand
in the talks here and will be the basis for his con
versations with Brezhnev. The Soviets have

died on Nov. 20,1975.
The militant right-wingers defied a govern
ment order prohibiting the use of military uni
forms and the Spanish flag at political rallies.
Dressed in the blue shirts of the Fascist-style
Falange party and waving tens of thousands of
the red-and-yellow flags, they shouted for free
dom for Lt. Col. AntonioTejero, the Civil Guard
officer who led the storming of Parliament nine
months ago in a vain bid to overthrow the con
stitutional monarchy government.
Raimundo Fernandez Cuesta, chief of the
Falange party, said the rally was not a routine
commemoration, "but a national affirmation,
necessary because Spain is in danger of destruc
tion."
The civil governor's office put the crowd esti
mate at 275,000 in Orient Square in front of the
Roy.il Palace in downtown Madrid. But an of
ficial said thousands more were jammed out
side the square to hear calls for a return to Fran
coism
The crowd interrupted speakers several times
to chant Franco's name. They made no mention
of his successor, King )uan Carlos, who put
down the Feb. 23 coup attempt. The king was
outside Madrid in his Zarzuela Palace resi
dence. Sunday was the sixth anniversary of his
ascension to the throne.

Reagan prepares first veto
Washington — President Ronald Reagan,
locked in dispute over domestic budget cuts,
vowed to veto a compromise spending bill
passed yesterday by Congress and summoned
his Cabinet to an emergency meeting this
morning to begin shutting down nonessential
government functions.
The House, brushing aside Reagan's veto
threat, endorsed the compromise Sunday and
sent it to the Senate where approval came 46-
to-39. The bill then went to the White House.
The weekend maneuvering left the govern
ment without spending authority heading into
the work week.
Reagan was expected to wield his veto — the
first of his presidency — at about 7:30 a.m. EST,
and White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
he would tell his Cabinet at 8 a.m. to order em
ployes they don't absolutely need to "come to
work, cancel meetings, lock the safe, cutout the
lights and leave."
Speakes estimated that 400,000 of the 2.9-mil
lion federal employees could be furloughed
without pay by the end of the business day
tomorrow. However, Congress could forestall
such sweeping impact today by setting aside its
compromise and approving a simple extention
of lapsed spending legislation.
Reagan said he preferred the extention to the
congressional compromise.
Reagan said Congress' $428 billion spending
plan amounted to "lavish deficit spending,"
and he complained: "This is no way to run a rail
road."
Out of all those billions, Reagan and Con
gress were haggling about $2 billion. House
Democratic Leader ]im Wright said he didn't
know why Reagan would veto the measure,
"unless the president simply wants the theatrics
of bringing the government to a halt."
Brezhnev avoids protestors
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev arrived in Bonn yesterday for
talks with West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt that are expected to have a major im
pact on East-West nuclear arms policies.
Touching down at the airport here in the ear
ly evening, Brezhnev came late enough to miss
tens of thousands of demonstrating West Ger
mans, Afghans and Soviet exiles who had
massed in downtown Bonn to protest Moscow's
arms- and development-aid policies and the in
vasion two years ago of Afghanistan.
The focal point of the four-day visit, during
which Schmidt and Brezhnev are scheduled to
meet formally three times, including once
without aides, will be how to curb European
based nuclear weapons. Schmidt and other
West European leaders face substantial public
opposition to North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion plans to station new Pershing II and cruise
medium-range nuclear missiles in their coun
tries.
The two leaders rode together from the air
port to Gvmnich Castle, 30 miles outside Bonn,
where Brezhnev is staying. West German tele
vision showed them, with West German For
eign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, sitting
down for drinks in the castle.
At the airport Sunday night to greet
Brezhnev, who will be 75 next month, were sev
eral thousand members of the West German
Communist Party and other leftist groups. They
carried banners declaring that Brezhnev had

come on a mission of peace and good will and
opposing nuclear weapons and nuclear bases,
meaning U.S. bases in West Germany.
This is Schmidt's sixth meeting with Brezhnev
— the most of any major Western leader. In pre
paring for the visit, Schmidt consulted with oth
er kev Western alliance officials, including Brit
ish Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was
in Bonn last week, and President Ronald Rea
gan, with whom Schmidt spoke by phone Satur
day night.
With U.S.-Soviet negotiations on weapons set
to begin Nov. .30 in Geneva, Schmidt has said he
would explain the Western position to
Brezhnev and search for common East-West
ground. Reagan's offer last week to cancel the
U.S. deployment if the Soviets agreed to dis
mantle their new and old medium-range, land
based missiles has strengthened Schmidt's hand
in the talks here and will be the basis for his con
versations with Brezhnev. The Soviets have
termed Reagan's proposal a propaganda ploy.
The visit — Brezhnev's first to the West since
the invasion of Afghanistan and only his third
trip abroad since then — has obvious advan
tages for the Soviets, who are expected to use
West Germany as a platform to further their
campaign against the planned U.S. deploy
ment.
Several demonstrations against Brezhnev's
visit were held here over the weekend.
Ulster braces for protest
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The security
forces in the troubled province of Ulster braced
themselves last night for the widespread loyalist
demonstration scheduled for today.
All police leave was canceled and community
leaders appealed to the populace to remain
calm and to avoid violence.
After uncovering five pounds of explosives in
a Protestant area, the police said that they were
worried that some loyalists might plan to com
mit violent acts today.
Some 40 demonstrations were scheduled to
take place across Ulster with the major ones set
for Belfast in midafternoon.
A work stoppage was originally called for by
the Rev. Lan Paisley, a member of Parliament
and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, in
a protest against the death of fellow Member of
Parliament, the Rev. Robert Bradford, at the
hands of the Irish Republican Army eight days
ago.
But Paisley's protest was also directed against
the policies of the government of Margaret
Thatcher, who he charges has been too easy on
the IR A and has been "selling out" Ulster in her
talks with Republic of Ireland Prime Minister
Garret Fitzgerald.
Other Protestant groups at first decided not
to support the Paisley call for a day-long work
stoppage on the ground that it would serve no
useful purpose.
Yesterday, Archbishop John Armstrong, of
the Anglican Church of Ireland, declared that
he was against stopping work because it would
"plav into the hands of the IRA."
But after some days of consultation, other
Protestants have decided to hold their own
demonstration.
House downs salary hike
Washington — The House of Representatives
pay increase went down to defeat yesterday,
and along with it the hopes of some 46,000 fed
eral executives for a long-delayed salary boost.

Without debate, the House disagreed with a
conference committee report which had en
dorsed a 4.8 percent salary raise for House
members and government executives.
The two had been linked together during the
conference, but the House was reluctant to face
the issue of raising its own members' salaries
with an election vear coming up.
The pav increase for House members had
been unexpectedly rammed through a meeting
of House-Senate conferees at midnight Friday
just before the weary members headed for a
nightlv recess.
It was proposed by Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Calif.) as
an amendment to the Senate version of a conti
nuing resolution that had included only the pay
raise for federal executives. Linking the two vir
tually assured their defeat, membersagreed lat
er.
Fazio argued that House members deserved a
pay increase, regardless of whether the senators
took one or not because the Senate had im
proved its compensation by lifting the ceiling
on honoraria they can receive for speeches and
other outside activities.
It would have raised House members' salaries
from $60,663 to $63,574 and created the unusual
situation of House members getting higher
salaries than senators.
Thousands remember Franco
Madrid — Almost 300,000 Spaniards, offering
the Fascist salute and cheering the leader of last
February's failed right-wing coup, packed a

attempt, called the turnout the biggest since
