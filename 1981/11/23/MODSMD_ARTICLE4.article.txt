# Rapes fail to prompt improvements in lighting
## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
The recent rapes have not changed the Univer
sity's 10-year master plan for the location and
amount of campus lighting, according to Univer
sity officials.
Facilities Engineer ]ohn Lerry said the rash of
sexual assaults hasn't led to an increase in the
$200,000 annual lighting project budget. "There
isn't much we can do about the rapes," he said.
"The only thing we can do is rely on the police and
the ASSU people to tell us if there are any gaps that
need lighting."
Lerry said some of the recent assaults have oc
curred in obscure places and pointed out that
many of the attacks have occurred in daylight,
when better lighting would not have helped.
"Basically we're proceeding with a lighting plan
that's intended to fill the gaps," he said. "Most of
our lighting projects are specifically related to
roads, parking lots and paths."
However, Planning Office Director Max

Ma/enko said the recent rapes have caused of
fii ials "to look at the areas where the rapes oc
curred "a little more closely."
Ma/enko said the University is continuing with
its original master plan to improve campus light
ing "It's basically a wish list consisting of every
conceivable area that would benefit from im
proved lighting," he said. "We've been making
substantial progress gfven the accelerated nature
of the lighting project."
Ma/enko said the Planning Office bases the
lighting plans on requests and complaints from in
dividuals. Potential lighting improvement plans
are formulated in conjunction with the ASSU, the
police department, SURE escort service and stu
dent housing management.
Asst. De.'m of Students Patricia Brandt ques
tioned whethe.r additional lighting would reduce
the number of campus rapes. "It's easy to get into
thinking that if we had more lights and more police
we wouldn't have rapes," she said. "But we need

to focus on the underlying attitudes of people."
Brandt said the University was criticized for not
reacting quickly to increased demands for secur
ity. But she said the additional police officers,
earlier escort service hours, and house security
meetings indicated the University was "quite re
sponsive."
Bob Elmore, acting electrical shop supervisor,
said outside lighting repair projects have also been
"geared up considerably" due to the recent at
tacks. "We used to have a two to three day backlog
of lighting changes and relamping," he said. "Now
it's rare when a lighting change waits more than a
day."v
According to Mazenko, 18 lighting improve
ment projects are being considered for 1981-82.
Among tho areas to receive additional lights are
the ifiner Quad, Quad courtyards and arches, the
physics tank area, the Roble Gym area, the
Bowman I louse Oak Grove, and various pathways
around campus.
