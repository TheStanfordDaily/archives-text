# Stanford grad reveals flipped PG&E diagram
## 
### Katherine L. Brown 
The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission (NRC.) voted last week to
suspend the fuel loading and low
power testing license granted to
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG & F.)
company's Diablo Canyon plant
just two months ago.
A 1980 Stanford graduate and
mechanical engineer for PG & E,
John Horn, was responsible for
finding the miscalculated seismic
responses which led to the in
creased scrutinization of the over
all safety of the plant. His dis
covery, which showed that sup
ports for the 160,000-pound cool
ing fans are not strong enough,
has led to more careful decision
making and documentation con
cerning nuclear energy at PG & E,
according to Horn.
Horn told The Stanford Daily,
"Decisions would be made over a
beer down the street . . . people
are being more careful now,
documents are being checked
and signed."
He said he was surprised at his
company's organization, "I
thought things would be really
well controlled and documented
— and that people would have to
answer to questions. It's definitely
not like being at a university," he
said.
Horn's specialty at PG & E's San
Francisco headquarters is making
calculations for seismic response
spectra "I'm not really pro-nucle
ar power, but I am into seismic
studies," he said. Horn described
his discovery of diagram dis
crepancies as a very chance hap
pening. "It's amazing how one lit
tle 3-inch diagram has changed
inv life," he said. "Two months lat
er i was flown out to Washington
D.C. for congressional meetings
and yesterday two television sta
tions wanted to talk to me."
What Horn found were some
engineers' diagrams of the
circular floor of the Diablo Ca
nyon reactor containment build
ing. The diagram is divided into
five pie shaped pieces, each one
indicating the location of some

very heavy pieces of equipment
called fan coolers. When he com
pared this diagram to one show
ing 'he actual placement of this
equipment, the slices of pie didn't
match. They were backwards im
ages of one another. As a result,
nine out of 20 seismic response
calculations for each of the five
sectors (on four different levels)
within the container were wrong.
"For the first containment
building, the diagram they used

was flipped upside down. Then
for the second reactor's building,
they used a mirror image, making
it doubly wrong," said Horn. The
original plans showed the two re
actors facing one another just as
two hands on the table have the
thumbs toward one another.
Researchers for Shell Oil dis
covered the Hosgri fault three
years after the construction for
Diablo began. The Hosgri fault is
about three miles offshore from
the plant. It wasn't until 1977 that
PG & F was forced to research
new design efforts to cope with a
potential 7.5 earthquake along
this newly discovered fault. It was
at this time that PG & E gave the
backwards diagram to its seismic
consultants, John A. Blume & As
sociates. After Horn's discovery
last September 19th, PC \ F. vol
untarily refrained from fuel load
ing and low-power testing. "They
were all fired up to begin testing
when we called them on Sept 28

representing a cross-section of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Re
actor's containment chambrs, correctly defines the areas where
"fan coolers" were to he safely placed. The drawing at the right,
used for the faulty design which caused the plant's license to be
suspended, has been flipped both horizontally and vertically,
causing the coolers to be arranged seismologically unsafely.

to tell them it wasn't safe," said Horn.
The NRC has been deluged by op
ponents of the plant since early 70s.
Last month Governor Jerry Brown
sent a letter to the NRC outlining 13
more problems that arose during
other checks of the plant.
According to Horn, the NRC has
latched onto his discovery of the
backward diagrams as a way to really
crack down on nuclear safety sys
tems. "It is as if the NRC is saying,
'Okay, so what else is right? Where
else did you (PG & E) get weights and
numbers from?' " said Horn.
The NRC has required P G & E to
hire an independent consulting firm
to conduct reviews of the safety sys
tems. Brown and San Luis Obispo
County residents (Mothers for Peace,
the Abalone Alliance) will have a say
in the NRC's approval of the new
consultants.
"PG & E's previous consultant,
Robert Cloud Associates, was on the

company payroll . . . that firm is not
what people would consider to be in
dependent," Horn said. PG & E is
proposing two other consultants in
addition to Cloud: Roger Reedy, an
independent consultant in the Bay
Area, and Teledyne Engineering Ser
vices of Massachusetts, a former
Cloud employer.
Horn says Brown has a right as a
representative of the people to re
quest the independent review of
Diablo
The 25-year-old mechanical engi
neer said he was not used to dealing
with the publicity his discovery has
given him; he said he didn't want to
appear on TV. "It's bad enough talk
ing about this stuff to print re
porters," he said. Horn put his mis
givings about talking about his dis
covery in perspective, however, by
saying, "The main thing I learned is
that no matter what happens, I can't
get too upset about what gets into
the newspapers."

Last month Governor Jerry Brown

According to Horn, the NRC has
latched onto his discovery of the
backward diagrams as a way to really
crack down on nuclear safety sys
tems. "It is as if the NRC is saying,
'Okay, so what else is right? Where
else did you (PG & E) get weights and
numbers from?' " said Horn.
The NRC has required P G & E to
hire an independent consulting firm
to conduct reviews of the safety sys

County residents (Mothers for Peace,
the Abalone Alliance) will have a say
in the NRC's approval of the new
consultants.
"PG & E's previous consultant,
Robert Cloud Associates, was on the

company payroll . . . that firm is not
what people would consider to be in
dependent," Horn said. PG & E is
proposing two other consultants in
addition to Cloud: Roger Reedy, an
independent consultant in the Bay
Area, and Teledyne Engineering Ser
vices of Massachusetts, a former
Cloud employer.
Horn says Brown has a right as a
representative of the people to re

Diablo
The 25-year-old mechanical engi
neer said he was not used to dealing
with the publicity his discovery has
given him; he said he didn't want to
appear on TV. "It's bad enough talk
ing about this stuff to print re
porters," he said. Horn put his mis
givings about talking about his dis
covery in perspective, however, by
saying, "The main thing I learned is
that no matter what happens, I can't
get too upset about what gets into
the newspapers."
The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission (NRC.) voted last week to
suspend the fuel loading and low
power testing license granted to
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG & F.)
company's Diablo Canyon plant
just two months ago.
A 1980 Stanford graduate and
mechanical engineer for PG & E,
John Horn, was responsible for
finding the miscalculated seismic
responses which led to the in
creased scrutinization of the over
all safety of the plant. His dis
covery, which showed that sup
ports for the 160,000-pound cool
ing fans are not strong enough,
has led to more careful decision
making and documentation con
cerning nuclear energy at PG & E,
according to Horn.
Horn told The Stanford Daily,
"Decisions would be made over a
beer down the street . . . people
are being more careful now,
documents are being checked
and signed."
He said he was surprised at his
company's organization, "I
thought things would be really
well controlled and documented
— and that people would have to
answer to questions. It's definitely
not like being at a university," he
said.
Horn's specialty at PG & E's San
Francisco headquarters is making
calculations for seismic response
spectra "I'm not really pro-nucle
ar power, but I am into seismic
studies," he said. Horn described
his discovery of diagram dis
crepancies as a very chance hap
pening. "It's amazing how one lit
tle 3-inch diagram has changed
inv life," he said. "Two months lat
er i was flown out to Washington
D.C. for congressional meetings
and yesterday two television sta
tions wanted to talk to me."
What Horn found were some
engineers' diagrams of the
circular floor of the Diablo Ca
nyon reactor containment build
ing. The diagram is divided into
five pie shaped pieces, each one
indicating the location of some

very heavy pieces of equipment
called fan coolers. When he com
pared this diagram to one show
ing 'he actual placement of this
equipment, the slices of pie didn't
match. They were backwards im
ages of one another. As a result,
nine out of 20 seismic response
calculations for each of the five
sectors (on four different levels)
within the container were wrong.
"For the first containment
building, the diagram they used

was flipped upside down. Then
for the second reactor's building,
they used a mirror image, making
it doubly wrong," said Horn. The
original plans showed the two re
actors facing one another just as
two hands on the table have the
thumbs toward one another.
Researchers for Shell Oil dis
covered the Hosgri fault three
years after the construction for
Diablo began. The Hosgri fault is
about three miles offshore from
the plant. It wasn't until 1977 that
PG & F was forced to research
new design efforts to cope with a
potential 7.5 earthquake along
this newly discovered fault. It was
at this time that PG & E gave the
backwards diagram to its seismic
consultants, John A. Blume & As
sociates. After Horn's discovery
last September 19th, PC \ F. vol
untarily refrained from fuel load
ing and low-power testing. "They
were all fired up to begin testing
