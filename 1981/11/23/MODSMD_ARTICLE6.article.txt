## Nicaragua,facing U.S. threats,economic pinch, turns to Soviets and others for aid 
### Washington Post 
Managua, Nicaragua —
While criticism from Washing
ton grows sharper and more
bellicose, Nicaragua is steadily
strengthening a broad range of
ties with the Soviet bloc and
with the revolutionary Arab
state, Libya.
While the Sandinista govern
ment here isavowedly Marxist
oriented and describes itself as
"internationalist," observers
see this trend in relations as
more the product of desper
ation than a natural affinity
with its new allies.
The guiding principle be
hind these links, although nev
er so explicitly stated by the
Nicaraguans, appears to be
based on the old idea that "the
enemv of my enemy is my
friend."
The Sandinistas have sus
pected since the days when it
supported the Somoza dic
tatorship that the U.S. govern
ment is their worst enemy and

in recent weeks the Reagan ad
ministration's public
statements have had the effect
of confirming that belief.
Despite Assistant Secretary
of State Thomas Enders' August
visit here to smooth relations
and an ensuing lull in the ver
bal war on both sides, those at
tacks have now resumed as
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and other high U.S. of
ficials repeatedly have de
nounced the Sandinistas and
refused to rule out military ac
tion against them.

gan administration recently

$30 million loan to Nicaragua
bv the Inter-American De
velopment Bank.
Nicaragua has replied by de
nouncing the Reagan adminis
tration for what it terms "ag
gressive adventurism," and at
the same time has turned to the
East. The Sandinistas have

firmed up their long-standing
ties to Cuba and gone beyond
those to embrace the Soviet
Union, its European allies, or
anyone else at odds with Wash
ington.
As the Reagan adminis
tration draws up a kind of in
ternational enemies list rang
ing from Brezhnev to Castro to
Khadafy, that is where the
Sandinistas look for friends.
Nicaragua still depends on
Western countries, especially
Mexico and Europe for much
of the economicaid it receives.
Even as Defense Minister Hum
berto Orteja visited Moscow
last week, Agriculture Minister
Jaime Wheelock was seeking
money and moral support in
Bonn.
But of most concern to the
United States are Nicaragua's
growing military ties to Ameri
ca's avowed enemies.
Both Nicaraguan officials
and diplomatic sources say
there is no firm evidence of
foreign troop concentrations
here or large shipmentsof mili
tary aircraft from Soviet alllies
to Nicaragua. But more than 50
Nicaraguan pilots trained to fly
MiG fighters are now returning
from Bulgaria and other
Eastern bloc countries accord
ing to the sources.
Military aid
East German, Cuban and
other military advisors trained
by Soviet allies are reported in
large numbers on Nicaragua's
troubled Atlantic coast, and ac
cording to one well-informed
Sandinista official, they also
have a strong presence in the
military headquarters here in
Managua.
Both the army's sector 2, mil
itary security, and sector 5, se
cret plans, have a particularly
large number of advisors, the
officials said, but declined to
give specific figures.
Arms have been supplied to
the Sandinistas by the Soviet
bloc, Algeria and Libya as the
government here continues
the rapid build up of its military.
But the current estimated
strength of the regular army re
mains about 25,000 soldiers and
the militias, strictly defensive
forces, have not yet enlisted

100,000 people despite Sand
inista hopes for twice that
number.
Beyond the military links that
have developed gradually over
the last two years, a totally new
element in Nicaraguan life is
the overt presence of propa
ganda from the Soviet bloc and
even Libya, often making a
curious mix with Nicaraguan
traditions and the long-stand
ing orientation toward Ameri
can culture.
On Managuan news stands
in addition to American comic
books and magazines, one
finds Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy's "Green Book, " "So
viet Life," and "Soviet Film."
Dubbed reruns of "Fantasy
Island" on the state-run tele
vision are interrupted by ad
vertisements for East German
documentaries on care for the
handicapped and the history of
Leipsig.
The Nicaraguan Association
of Friendship with the Socialist
Countries, was founded in July
to sponsor much of this activi
ty. It is a branch of the Sand
inista party organization with
five members. It has no set
budget as yet but gets funding
from "similar organizations" in
the Soviet bloc. It disseminates
information about the culture
of foreign socialist countries.

Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Miguel D'Escoto points to his

Nicaragua needs help any
where it can find it and to that
end D'Escoto is already plan
ning another trip to the Middle
East in January. Nicaragua is
seeking aid from Libya and the
Arabs precisely because it does
not want to depend on the So

Policies of fear
Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Miguel D'Escoto points to his
country's desperate economic
situation and the perceived
U.S. threats against itasthe rea
son for Nicaragua's ties to the
Eastern bloc and Libya.
Nicaragua needs help any
where it can find it and to that
end D'Escoto is already plan
ning another trip to the Middle
East in January. Nicaragua is
seeking aid from Libya and the
Arabs precisely because it does
not want to depend on the So
viets.
D'Escoto said Nicaragua
wants "to get into a situation
where we do not depend
critically on any one country....
We will fight with equal zeal to
be independent from any
country."
Managua, Nicaragua —
While criticism from Washing
ton grows sharper and more
bellicose, Nicaragua is steadily
strengthening a broad range of
ties with the Soviet bloc and
with the revolutionary Arab
state, Libya.
While the Sandinista govern
ment here isavowedly Marxist
oriented and describes itself as
"internationalist," observers
see this trend in relations as
more the product of desper
ation than a natural affinity
with its new allies.
The guiding principle be
hind these links, although nev
er so explicitly stated by the
Nicaraguans, appears to be
based on the old idea that "the
enemv of my enemy is my
friend."
The Sandinistas have sus
pected since the days when it
supported the Somoza dic
tatorship that the U.S. govern
ment is their worst enemy and

in recent weeks the Reagan ad
ministration's public
statements have had the effect
of confirming that belief.
Despite Assistant Secretary
of State Thomas Enders' August
visit here to smooth relations
and an ensuing lull in the ver
bal war on both sides, those at
tacks have now resumed as
Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and other high U.S. of
ficials repeatedly have de
nounced the Sandinistas and
refused to rule out military ac
tion against them.

Nicaragua has replied by de
nouncing the Reagan adminis
tration for what it terms "ag
gressive adventurism," and at
the same time has turned to the
East. The Sandinistas have

firmed up their long-standing
ties to Cuba and gone beyond
those to embrace the Soviet
Union, its European allies, or
anyone else at odds with Wash
ington.
As the Reagan adminis
tration draws up a kind of in

Khadafy, that is where the
Sandinistas look for friends.
Nicaragua still depends on
Western countries, especially
Mexico and Europe for much
of the economicaid it receives.
Even as Defense Minister Hum
berto Orteja visited Moscow
last week, Agriculture Minister
Jaime Wheelock was seeking
money and moral support in
Bonn.
But of most concern to the
United States are Nicaragua's
growing military ties to Ameri
ca's avowed enemies.
Both Nicaraguan officials
and diplomatic sources say
there is no firm evidence of
foreign troop concentrations
here or large shipmentsof mili
tary aircraft from Soviet alllies
to Nicaragua. But more than 50
Nicaraguan pilots trained to fly
MiG fighters are now returning
from Bulgaria and other
Eastern bloc countries accord

Military aid
East German, Cuban and
other military advisors trained
by Soviet allies are reported in
large numbers on Nicaragua's
troubled Atlantic coast, and ac
cording to one well-informed
Sandinista official, they also
have a strong presence in the
military headquarters here in
Managua.
Both the army's sector 2, mil
itary security, and sector 5, se
cret plans, have a particularly
large number of advisors, the
officials said, but declined to
give specific figures.
Arms have been supplied to
the Sandinistas by the Soviet
bloc, Algeria and Libya as the
government here continues
the rapid build up of its military.
But the current estimated
strength of the regular army re
mains about 25,000 soldiers and
the militias, strictly defensive
forces, have not yet enlisted

100,000 people despite Sand
