Catholics mourn death
An estimated 2000 mourners in Lurgan, Northern Ireland, followed the hearse of a
slain 21-year-old Catholic housing official, Peadar Fagan, who was killed last week
in what police believe was a revenge killing by Protestant gunmen. Today, Protes
tants plan to hold several rallies denouncing the IRA for its alleged role in the kill
ings of 10 Protestants in the past month, including a Protestant member of the Brit
ish Parliament from Northern Ireland.
