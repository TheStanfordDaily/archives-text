# French Socialists battle business over economy
## 
### Washington Post 
Paris — French Socialists who swept to power six
months ago determined to make a "tranquil revolu
tion" instead have become locked in an increasingly
rancorous battle with skeptical businessmen backed
by the rightist opposition.
The confrontation has generated an atmosphere in
which France's most prestigious and sober news
paper, Le Monde, recently published a front-page
analysis headlined: "Civil War?" Although the war
has been fought only with words so far, it demon
strates that positions are hardening on both sides as
the government comes face to face with those who
most oppose its reforms.
"The tension reflects a real division," said Michel
Berson, a Socialist member of Parliament from the
Paris suburbs. "The reaction of the right is a class reac
tion. What is going on is a class battle."
Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy has shown growing
irritation at businessmen's slowness to respond to his
appeals for cooperation in combatting unemploy
ment and nationalizing major industries and banks.
He and other Socialist leaders have begun to voice
suspicion that the resistance is in part a deliberate ef
fort to undermine his economic recovery and em
ployment programs.
"They are betting on our failure," Berson said in an
interview.
Most frustrating has been Mauroy's inability so far
to reverse the rise in unemployment, the number one
economic issue during President Francois Mitter
rand's election campaign. Since his victory May 10,

the number of unemployed has risen by more than
100,000 to top two million.
The rise had been expected. Not even Mauroy's
most ardent supporters believed he could turn the sit
uation around in six months. His advisor for social af
fairs, Bernard Brunhes, predicted the two million fig
ure in a background conversation with reporters two
months ago.
Its announcement nevertheless drew attention to
Mauroy's difficulty getting his programs out of min
istry offices into the factory at least fast enough to
slow the increase. A poll last week indicated that
more than half of French medium and small busi
nesses have no plans to invest and more than 80 per
cent have no plans to hire new workers.
Another poll said that, despite Mauroy's incentives
and exhortations, 79 percent of executives queried
said thev have changed nothing in their hiring poli
cies. computer specialist at Thompson, the giant
electronics firm just nationalized, said several experts
in his department are working on temporary con
tracts because, although they are needed, company
policy still is to avoid hiring new employees.
\ special program launched by Mauroy to increase
government aid to employers who agree to hire new
workers, called "solidarity contracts," has drawn only
two serious nibbles of interest. Both come from town
halls, one of them Lille, the northern French town
whose mayor is Mauroy himself.
Reflecting impatience — their own and that of So
cialist militants- 4 - Mitterrand and Mauroy announced
last week that the government plans to carry out a

series of substantial changes by decree rather than by
normal legislation that implies delay for parlia
mentary debate.
The procedure drew special attention as a sign of
government resolve because, as opposition leader,
Mitterrand often had criticized the same short cut
when it was practiced by previous governments as an
attempt to frustrate parliamentary control.
"Weare respondingtothe legitimate impatience of
Frenchmen," Mauroy explained, "and tothe urgency
of the situation."
The decrees will regulate cuts in the legal work
week, an increase from four to five weeks' paid vaca
tion and, among other things, a drop in retirement
age to 60. All are designed mainly to create more job
positions by reducing the amount of work done by
each employee.
Although the steps were popular campaign prom
ises, the main effort to combat unemployment has
centered on stimulating the economy through a post
war record $17 billion budget deficit now being voted
and swift increases in the minimum wage and such
government payments as unemployment insurance,
pensions and family welfare checks. Although in ef
fect for several months, these steps have failed to gen
erate new economic activity as fast as Mauroy had
hoped.
Opposition politicians and business leaders have
blamed the sluggish response on the Socialists, charg
ing that their nationalizations and increased taxes
have made executives afraid to act.

age to 60. All are designed mainly to create more job
positions by reducing the amount of work done by
each employee.
Although the steps were popular campaign prom
ises, the main effort to combat unemployment has
centered on stimulating the economy through a post
war record $17 billion budget deficit now being voted
and swift increases in the minimum wage and such
government payments as unemployment insurance,
pensions and family welfare checks. Although in ef
fect for several months, these steps have failed to gen
erate new economic activity as fast as Mauroy had
hoped.
Opposition politicians and business leaders have

have made executives afraid to act.
Paris — French Socialists who swept to power six
months ago determined to make a "tranquil revolu
tion" instead have become locked in an increasingly
rancorous battle with skeptical businessmen backed
by the rightist opposition.
The confrontation has generated an atmosphere in
which France's most prestigious and sober news
paper, Le Monde, recently published a front-page
analysis headlined: "Civil War?" Although the war
has been fought only with words so far, it demon
strates that positions are hardening on both sides as
the government comes face to face with those who
most oppose its reforms.
"The tension reflects a real division," said Michel
Berson, a Socialist member of Parliament from the
Paris suburbs. "The reaction of the right is a class reac
tion. What is going on is a class battle."
Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy has shown growing
irritation at businessmen's slowness to respond to his
appeals for cooperation in combatting unemploy
ment and nationalizing major industries and banks.
He and other Socialist leaders have begun to voice
suspicion that the resistance is in part a deliberate ef
fort to undermine his economic recovery and em
ployment programs.
"They are betting on our failure," Berson said in an
interview.
Most frustrating has been Mauroy's inability so far
to reverse the rise in unemployment, the number one
economic issue during President Francois Mitter
rand's election campaign. Since his victory May 10,

the number of unemployed has risen by more than
100,000 to top two million.
The rise had been expected. Not even Mauroy's
most ardent supporters believed he could turn the sit
uation around in six months. His advisor for social af
fairs, Bernard Brunhes, predicted the two million fig
ure in a background conversation with reporters two
months ago.
Its announcement nevertheless drew attention to
Mauroy's difficulty getting his programs out of min
istry offices into the factory at least fast enough to
slow the increase. A poll last week indicated that
more than half of French medium and small busi
nesses have no plans to invest and more than 80 per
cent have no plans to hire new workers.
Another poll said that, despite Mauroy's incentives
and exhortations, 79 percent of executives queried
said thev have changed nothing in their hiring poli
cies. computer specialist at Thompson, the giant
electronics firm just nationalized, said several experts
in his department are working on temporary con
tracts because, although they are needed, company
policy still is to avoid hiring new employees.
\ special program launched by Mauroy to increase
government aid to employers who agree to hire new
workers, called "solidarity contracts," has drawn only
two serious nibbles of interest. Both come from town
halls, one of them Lille, the northern French town
whose mayor is Mauroy himself.
Reflecting impatience — their own and that of So
cialist militants- 4 - Mitterrand and Mauroy announced
last week that the government plans to carry out a

series of substantial changes by decree rather than by
normal legislation that implies delay for parlia
mentary debate.
The procedure drew special attention as a sign of
government resolve because, as opposition leader,
Mitterrand often had criticized the same short cut
when it was practiced by previous governments as an
attempt to frustrate parliamentary control.
"Weare respondingtothe legitimate impatience of
Frenchmen," Mauroy explained, "and tothe urgency
of the situation."
The decrees will regulate cuts in the legal work
week, an increase from four to five weeks' paid vaca
tion and, among other things, a drop in retirement
age to 60. All are designed mainly to create more job
positions by reducing the amount of work done by
each employee.
