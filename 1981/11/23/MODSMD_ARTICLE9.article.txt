## New ride board at Tresidder Union 
### Annette Makino 
Need a ride to Seattle
over Thanksgiving? Want to
buy two plane tickets to Bos
ton, cheap? Looking for
someone to share driving
and gas costs down to L.A.?
The ride board, located in
the downstairs lobby of
Tresidder Union, next to Se
quoia Travel, has recently
been expanded and im
proved. Sponsored by
Alpha Phi Omega, a na
tional co-ed service fraterni
ty, the ride board is now
three or four times larger
than it was and has been re
organized to make it easier
to use.
"We just wanted to get it
kicked off. A lot of students
don't even know about it,
especially freshmen," said
Alpha Phi Omega member
Dave Yob.
The large red-and-white
board is divided intothe five
geographical areas of the
U.S. Segments of the board
are also reserved for notices
on carpools, airplane
tickets, international travel
and tours.

"Colorado or Bust,"!
"Three Branner Women in
Distress," and "Need ride to
Minesnowta for X-mas" are
just a few of the eye-catch
ing notes people have
tacked up.
A problem for years with
the old ride board was lack
of space, especially during
Thanksgiving and Christmas
breaks. The ASSU Council
of Presidents helped Alpha
Phi Omega expand the
board this year.
Another frequent com
plaint about the old ride
board was that Tresidder
used to remove all the notes
every two weeks, regardless
of how recent they were.
Notes will now stay up until
they are outdated.
Reaction to the new
board has been positive,
Yob said.
"People were really en
thused — they thought it
looked better. I think it
looks pretty sharp," he said.
"I think the new ride board
will be a really good service
for the community."
