'BUG ME' IS
COMING BACK!
Need an answer figured out?
Want to know what it's about?
Bothered by a trivial matter?
Heard some hot, disturbing chatter?
Don't let problems make you frown
Crab some paper â€” write 'em down
Bring 'em in and we'll do our best
To put your troubled mind to rest!
Watch for BUG ME, a weekly reader's aid
column, beginning in the Daily next Friday,
Dec. 4. Deliver your questions to:
Bug Me
