# Chavez blames global hunger on 'shortcuts'
## 
### Jeff Sims 
Cesar Chavez, president of the
United Farm Workers (UFW), told a
full crowd in Cubberley Auditorium
last night that hunger in the Third
World is largely the result of develop
ing nations trying to catch up to the
West too quickly.
Chavez said he would join students
in participating in today's seventh an
nual Fast Day. Although he said he
was "not an expert" on hunger, he
said he had witnessed hunger in the
United States and also during his
travels to the Third World.
"One of the big reasons why so
much hunger exists in under
developed countries is that almost
without exception they want to take
shortcuts," said Chavez. "Capital in
tensive development is stressed to
the exclusion of labor intensive de
velopment," he said.
"They want to mimic fully de
veloped c ountries," said Chavez.
According to Chavez, under
developed countries have unrealistic
plans for such capital-intensive in
dustries as airlines and automobile
factories and thus make "false prom
ises" to their people.
These countries "have to do a lot of
campaigning" to get people into the
urban centers, said Chavez, and
there are soon "many people in
these population centers without
jobs. They are a prime target for ex

pi' ion.
' Once this initial uprooting takes
plate, these people are never settled
again. Many are transported to de
veloped countries and exploited
there," he said.
According to Chavez, the world
hunger problem could be eased if
countries would concentrate on "ag
riculture of self-sufficiency" instead
of "capital-intensive agriculture."
Up-to-date machinery is not the
answer, said Chavez. "They talk
about using modern implements,
machines and pesticides in their agri
culture, but they cannot bring this
about," said Chavez. Thus, they "find
themselves importing food from
highly developed countries."
Developing countries should
"treat the soil as a living organism,"
he explained. "They don't need
fertilizers, implements, gas, tractors
or highly developed irrigation. They
don't need the capital expen
ditures."
According to Chavez, the United
States must decrease the "emphasis
on sending food," instead concen
trating on "getting the developing
countries started in agricultural self
—sufficiency. Only then will they be
free."
Agriculture in the United Statesisa
bad model for the developing coun
tries, Chavez claimed, because it
"has a tremendous amount of

waste." He said much of this waste is
due to capital-intensive farming
methods.
Chavez cited the example of a ma
chine that was brought in to help
with an apricot harvest while farm
workers were on strike. "The ma
chine was probably more effective
for the management than 100
strikebreakers, but they winded up
throwing away most of the apricots
Chavez said that agriculture in this
country is designed more to improve
processing methods than to benefit
consumers or farmworkers. "We de
velop machines but we don't care
about the workers that are dis
placed," he said. "We develop plants

to meet the machine but we don't
care about the consumers."
Chavez also stressed that there are
"people hungry right here in this
country, in California."
The UFW, said Chavez "is continu
ing its work of trying to bring social
justice to farmworkers."
Chavez said that during the fast he
wanted people to "reflect on the fact
that the food you eat has passed
through the hands of a man, woman
or child that was exploited. It's an
ironic tragedy that the people who
work on the land are the same ones
that are most often hungry."

Chavez said that agriculture in this
country is designed more to improve
processing methods than to benefit
consumers or farmworkers. "We de
velop machines but we don't care
about the workers that are dis
placed," he said. "We develop plants

to meet the machine but we don't
care about the consumers."
Chavez also stressed that there are
"people hungry right here in this
country, in California."
The UFW, said Chavez "is continu
ing its work of trying to bring social
justice to farmworkers."
Chavez said that during the fast he
wanted people to "reflect on the fact
that the food you eat has passed
through the hands of a man, woman
or child that was exploited. It's an
ironic tragedy that the people who
work on the land are the same ones
that are most often hungry."
