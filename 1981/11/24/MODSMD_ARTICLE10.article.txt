## Big Game 1981:A scrapbook of soggy successes 
### Madeline Kirbach 
What's a little rain when you've got the
Axe! Nothing could dampen the spirits of
Stanford fans as they prepared for the an
nual three-day Big Game extravaganza —
which was actually a "game" in itself.
The Kickoff: Gaieties 1981!
The Ram's Head production entitled
"Stanford Can Wait" recruited its players
through "A Chorus Line," obtaining first
round draft choices. The Gaieties per
formers plowed through the "pseudo-pre
ppies of USC" while one of the stars scored
with Princess Di.
As usual, the play featured a trompling
over the Berkeley "Weenies," blocking
their long-shot attempt to tie the score with
Stanford. The annual feature of the show
was another guest appearance by Ad
missions Dean Fred Hargadon, who has
been out this season.
10 minutes into the first quarter, Stanford
was well on its way to a Big Game victory.
The LSJUMB scrambled through Toyon,
Branner, Wilbur, Stern and the Row, then
reached the end zone at Lake Lag. The
Dollies kicked for extra points amidst the
cheers of the crowd and a background of
fireworks.
Second-quarter action began on Friday
with a replay of Gaieties followed by a
march down the grid-iron of San Francisco.
Protected by a line of LSJUMB members,
the Stanford masses carried the ball from
the Mark Hopkins Hotel to the Aquatic Park
near The Cannery. Despite a few minor set
backs including "offsides," and "illegal use
of the hands" penalties, the drive was again
successful.
After a halftime consisting of tailgaters,
reunions and other festivities, the most im
portant half of the Big Game action began
on Saturday in Stanford Stadium, where a
crew of the biggest and toughest Stanford
men took on The Berkeley Bear squad.
These selected representatives were
spurred on to victory by cheers led by spir
ited alumni, students, Dollies, LSJUMB
members, and traditional fight songs in
cluding "All Right Now" and "Come Join
the Band."
With the scoreboard flashing "Stanford:
42, Cal: 21, Time 0:00," came the climax of
the three-day event. Band members and
athletes held the "Big Game Axe" to which
Stanford regained possession as a reward
for an outstanding Big Game execution

BIG GAME WEEKEND — Clockwise from tipper right:
— Dollies charged through a sea of Band members at the start of
the game;
— Tailgaters didn't alter their pre-game festivities for a little rain;
— The Stanford Tree received a personal escort during half-time
activities;
— Students rallied in the City on Friday night as part of the Big
Game tradition;
— Umbrellas rose and rain fell as the Cards went on to beat Cal
42-21;
— Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon, masquerading as Gene
Kelly, was "in heaven" over the "Stanford Can Wait" production of
Gaieties;
— Give 'em the axe,the axe, the axe!". . . an alumnus
demonstrated he hasn't lost his school spirit over the years;
— The Band performed as fireworks exploded at Lake Lagunita
Thursday night.
