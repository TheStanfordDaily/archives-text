## Editorial Mascot colorful 
### 
"It's not easy being green," Kermit the frog
once sighed in a froggish lament about his
slightly puce pallor.
Alas. If only we could now get a character as
popular as Miss Piggy's paramour to champion
the cause of the Stanford Cardinal — as the
saying goes, the color not the bird. Having a
color for a mascot means more than just another
ad hoc task force open forum advisory board
producsd compromise decision designed to
annoy and dismay the folks who think up
college souvenir logos. Think of the possiblities:
Maybe we could get Snoopy's arch-enemy,
the Red Baron, to skvwrite the namealloverthe
skiesat home football games. Oops, waita
minute, that sounds vaguely similar to the
Robber Baron. Sorry, that would never do.
Or how about Red Rider? He could come

galloping onto the field at all home football
games shooting a gun with a flag that pops out
and says "Cardinal." Nope, too close to another
gent who likes to ride the range between the
goal lineson a pinto.
Maybe Robinson Crusoe could helpout with
publicity by putting notesin whiskey bottles
saying "Go Cardinal" (after all, he was
marooned on a desert island).
Vou might argue that we're not taking this all
very seriously — this"mascot issue" which has
plagued the campus for the past 10 years. Well,
you're right. We've gotour mascot — let's go on
to more important things. While we cringe at
the claim that we've "settled it once and for all"
(which we've done about four times now), this
time it's time to resign ourselves and just have
fun.
