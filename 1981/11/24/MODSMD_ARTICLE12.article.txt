## Private sector too crippled to promote 'Yankee ingenuity' 
### 
America's greatest natural resource can
not be quantified, cannot be measured and
cannot be included in any government pre
dictions. It is a resource so amorphous, so in
determinate, and so individualized as to be
.-useful only as an effect. It is not land, nor oil,
nor lack thereof, nor any other material ob
ject. Our greatest national treasure is that in
novative quality of mind from which creative
'solutions to problems spring. In the ver
nacular, it is the so-called "Yankee ingenui
ty." From this trite phrase flowed the United
.States' technological edge and resultant
dominant position in trade after the Second
World War. Secular humanism — a belief in
science as a tool for man's progress — was
the watchword of the day.
It is no secret that we are losing our tech
nological edge. Japan and West Germany
have superseded the United States as leaders
in world trade. Saddled with our seemingly
unquenchable thirst for oil, the economy is
crippled. For just as a man who cannot walk
cannot run, a private sector that can barely
.sustain production cannot waste effort
toward improving that production.
President Ronald Reagan is no innovator.

He has, however, sought a creative solution
to the nation's problems. He has responded
by cutting federal funding for research. It is
the president's sincere belief that the private
Sector, through added incentives and tax
cuts, will take over where the federal gov
ernment has left off.
As President Calvin Coolidge eulogized,
"the business of America is business." Rea
gan has based his domestic policy around
this Republican credo, devoting his energies
to developing a modern laissez-faire doc
trine. Wall Street has answered his call with
suspicion.
Business is devoting whatever economic
profit* its stockholders choose to spend to a
much-needed revamping of production
modes, not to research. Even so, corporate
treasurers are being very tight-fisted with
their money — the high yield of money mar
ket certificates is much more enticing than
the interest rate for borrowing. They are, in
short, saving more than they are spending.
The corporate sector seems to be inclined to
a coniented stagnation, patiently watching

to see if Reagan is as good as his word.
Our economy, unlike the state-centered
economies of japan and West Germany,
focuses on the maximization of profits. Cor
porations, as a result, are forgivably myopic.
They are motivated by the profit margin, not
by the social welfare. Research has only an

expedient value — when times are good,
they can afford to allocate funds for re
search. When times are bad, as in the current
recession, they are cautious of largess, re
moved from the temptations of the "plow
back."
Over the next ten years, the Bureau of La
bor Statistics predicts a 20 percent increase
of jobs in the job market. Because of the

post-war "baby boom", the bureau predicts
the labor force to swell by 40 percent. That
spells out to a lot of unemployed people.
Unemployed workers cost money in both
real terms and in terms of lost potential. La
bor, like land and capital goods, is a factor of
production, and inefficient implies

waste.
The large increase in the working popu
lation will result in increasing competition
for available jobs. Promotion and advance
ment will slow down as well, as the system's
ability to absorb new workers saturates. To
complete the cycle, incentive will generally
be lost along with creative solutions. Will we
see the eradication of the famed "Yankee in
genuity" as social stratification increases and

upward mobility becomes a thing of the
past?
The value of research is twofold: it de
velops new areas of knowledge and de
velops social goods. In purely economic
terms, knowledge can be applied to the de
velopment of new industries and variations
on old ones. Research has opened up areas
of tremendous potential (gene-splicing) and
added greatly to the public welfare (vaccina
tions, medical procedures).
Reagan would have research sub
ject to the demands of the market economy.
He is sacrificing long-term benefits for short
term gratification. In these days of high over
head and even higher inflation, it is doubtful
if the private sector can finance a public
good such as research. What is needed is a
government policy of active encouragement
of "Yankee ingenuity." If Reagan is really in
terested in serving his country, he would
adopt such a course.

of tremendous potential (gene-splicing) and
added greatly to the public welfare (vaccina
tions, medical procedures).
Reagan would have research sub
ject to the demands of the market economy.
He is sacrificing long-term benefits for short
term gratification. In these days of high over
head and even higher inflation, it is doubtful
if the private sector can finance a public
good such as research. What is needed is a
government policy of active encouragement
of "Yankee ingenuity." If Reagan is really in
terested in serving his country, he would
adopt such a course.

America's greatest natural resource can
not be quantified, cannot be measured and
cannot be included in any government pre
dictions. It is a resource so amorphous, so in
determinate, and so individualized as to be
.-useful only as an effect. It is not land, nor oil,
nor lack thereof, nor any other material ob
ject. Our greatest national treasure is that in
novative quality of mind from which creative
'solutions to problems spring. In the ver
nacular, it is the so-called "Yankee ingenui
ty." From this trite phrase flowed the United
.States' technological edge and resultant
dominant position in trade after the Second
World War. Secular humanism — a belief in
science as a tool for man's progress — was
the watchword of the day.
It is no secret that we are losing our tech
nological edge. Japan and West Germany
have superseded the United States as leaders
in world trade. Saddled with our seemingly
unquenchable thirst for oil, the economy is
crippled. For just as a man who cannot walk
cannot run, a private sector that can barely
.sustain production cannot waste effort
toward improving that production.
President Ronald Reagan is no innovator.

He has, however, sought a creative solution
to the nation's problems. He has responded
by cutting federal funding for research. It is
the president's sincere belief that the private
Sector, through added incentives and tax
cuts, will take over where the federal gov
ernment has left off.
As President Calvin Coolidge eulogized,
"the business of America is business." Rea
gan has based his domestic policy around
this Republican credo, devoting his energies
to developing a modern laissez-faire doc
trine. Wall Street has answered his call with
suspicion.
Business is devoting whatever economic
profit* its stockholders choose to spend to a
much-needed revamping of production
modes, not to research. Even so, corporate
treasurers are being very tight-fisted with
their money — the high yield of money mar
ket certificates is much more enticing than
the interest rate for borrowing. They are, in
short, saving more than they are spending.
The corporate sector seems to be inclined to
a coniented stagnation, patiently watching

to see if Reagan is as good as his word.
Our economy, unlike the state-centered
economies of japan and West Germany,
focuses on the maximization of profits. Cor
porations, as a result, are forgivably myopic.
They are motivated by the profit margin, not
by the social welfare. Research has only an

expedient value — when times are good,
they can afford to allocate funds for re
search. When times are bad, as in the current
recession, they are cautious of largess, re
moved from the temptations of the "plow
back."
Over the next ten years, the Bureau of La
bor Statistics predicts a 20 percent increase
of jobs in the job market. Because of the

post-war "baby boom", the bureau predicts
the labor force to swell by 40 percent. That
spells out to a lot of unemployed people.
Unemployed workers cost money in both
real terms and in terms of lost potential. La
bor, like land and capital goods, is a factor of
production, and inefficient implies

waste.
The large increase in the working popu
lation will result in increasing competition
for available jobs. Promotion and advance
ment will slow down as well, as the system's
ability to absorb new workers saturates. To
complete the cycle, incentive will generally
be lost along with creative solutions. Will we
see the eradication of the famed "Yankee in
genuity" as social stratification increases and

upward mobility becomes a thing of the
past?
The value of research is twofold: it de
velops new areas of knowledge and de
velops social goods. In purely economic
terms, knowledge can be applied to the de
velopment of new industries and variations
on old ones. Research has opened up areas
of tremendous potential (gene-splicing) and
added greatly to the public welfare (vaccina
