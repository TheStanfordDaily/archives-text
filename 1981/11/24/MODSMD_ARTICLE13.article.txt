## Letter to a Stanford boy: Sex is not just a game people play 
### 
To a Stanford boy:
You will never have to face preg
nancy as either a positive experience
(where one carries a child for nine
months within one's own body, gives
birth to it, and happily nurses and
raises it) or as a negative one (where
one must choose between abortion,
curving a child to term and then giv
ing it away, or keeping an unwanted
baby). Neither you nor any man has
ever experienced a monthly
menstrual cycle with its attendant
muscle cramps and discomforts.
Only an experimental handful of
men have ever been subject to dan
gerously altering their body
chemistry out of contraceptive need.
Very few, save prison inmates, will
ever be raped. You do not have to
cope with "honeymoon cystitis," life
in a society which will devalue you as
your youth fades, or "bad" reputa
tions ("stud" carries none of the
scornfully degrading contempt con
noted by the words "whore" and
"slut").
How different life must be when so
much of it can be lived with little or
no regard for consequences! How
rarely one would be forced to ac
knowledge compassionately that
"there, but for the grace of God, go I

Last week, I had an abortion. You,
the boy (for you are no man) who im
pregnated me will never know. You
were not even able to keep our sex
ual relations private; you could not
be trusted with such an extremely
personal and delicate matter as my
pregnancy. And have no doubt that
there is an unspoken social stigma to
being pregnant, just as there is to
b<*ing raped or having VD. It's all

right to play the game, you see, as
Iqng as one doesn't get caught (an
other socially contracted "disease,"
so to speak).
I am now a member of a sorority
larger than all the Theta's, Alpha Phi's
aAd Kappa Kappa Gamma's put to
gether, for I was pregnant and I was
alone. The circumstances of the haz
ing vary slightly for each new pledge,
but the number of women in that sis
terhood is infinite. In the historical,
rhetorical sense I was not alone at all,
and this knowledge was simultane
ously a source of comfort and great
artger.
While there are many boys and
men who are mature, caring, respon
sible people, there are also a vast
number who are not, and who don't
particularly work at developing
themselves in these areas. Ironically,
through your very immaturity and ir
responsibility, you have protected
vourself from the burden of coping
with the consequences of your ac
tions. In this case, a very typical one, I
carried the psychological, emotional,
physical and financial burden
without support from you, who
should have been 50 percent respon
sible. Not only have you been spared
the price I paid with my body, my
mind and my pocketbook, but by
avoiding the issue altogether you
bave also avoided the soul
s'earching, the re-evaluation of your
values, the reflections on your life
style, priorities and responsibilities
which would have developed a
greater depth and maturity for your
future. Ignorance is bliss.
I, however, have felt angry and re
sentful — justifiably so. You have no
business engaging in sex if you can

rtot do so with the total capacity and
willingness to handle real life conse
quences with sensitivity, integrity,
and a 50-50 share of the burden. If
you cannot live up to this, then every
shared sexual act in which you en-

Then again, hell, it's no fun to worry about
things like compassion, empathy, and
humane sensitivity. Worse yet, who wants to
constrain oneself by living life within limited
perimeters dictated by respect and concern
for the welfare of one's fellow human beings?

gage is a betrayal of the woman you
are with. Hollow claims of would-be
maturity in the face of a true crisis
ring very false if you must share the
news of your sexual activity with your
friends, if you cannot maintain a
friendship with your sexual partner,
or any number of other signs of ir
responsible sexual dabbling.
But let me share with you a bit of
what the experience is like for those
of us not biologically "lucky"
enough to be able to refuse to accept
the results of our actions. To simulate
the profound ethical and moral
dilemma one faces with an unwanted
pregnancy, I would put you onasink
ing boat with your mother and one
life-jacket. This is no brainteaser
from a jokebook. The psychological
implications facing an abortion can
be as great.
I cannot make your breasts enlarge
and grow painfully tender, nor can I
make you incessantly nauseous, in
frequent need of urinating, inex
plicably exhausted and subject to

rapid and tremendous mood swings,
I could lay you down on
tyour hack, spread-eagle, and drive a
broom handle into your lower ab
domen until you cry out pleading,
just as I pleaded, in anguish but in

vain, for the doctor to stop scraping
the inside of my uterus. Additionally,
I could charge you several hundred
dollars and your peace of mind for
<?he pleasure of undergoing all this.
And still you would be getting a
break, for you would experience
none of the sobering effects of the
<fear of confirming the pregnancy,
the fear of public knowledge, the
fear and shame of undergoing the
'abortion, the depression of emo
tional isolation, the inefficiency in
your academic work, and the tre
mendous sense of injustice in carry
ing 100 percent responsibility with no
support, concern or ongoing friend
ship from someone of whom you
"once thought highly enough toshare
.your bed and yourself.
The number of boys and men who
impregnate women and never learn
of it is high. The matter is much too
crucial for a woman to risk taking a
"tell him and see how he reacts" at
titude if a boy/man's behavior has al
ready shown lack of maturity dealing

Avith more trivial matters. Therefore,
gentlemen, think next time you slg'ep
-with a woman that your combined
actions could conceivably have a
traumatic and overwhelming impact
on her life — yes, even when birth
control is used. This is a strong argu
ment against irresponsible, in
discriminate screwing in the pursuit
of one's own pleasure.
Then again, hell, it's no fun to
worry about things like compassion,
empathy and humane sensitivity.
Worse yet, who wants to constrain
oneself by living life within limited
perimeters dictated by respect and
concern for the welfare of one's fel
low human beings? Think of the sex
ist and racist jokes you could no long
ertell! Think of the girls you could no
longer screw and forget about (ex
cept, of course, when recounting the

episode to eager friends)! Think of all
those good times gone!
, No, a life given over to uncaring,
hedonistic excesses is much more ef
fortless and pain free (for you). Con
sideration and thoughtfulness just
don't rate compared to drinking with
your buddies, getting rowdy,
.scrutinizing the "meatbook," hang
ing out at parties and picking up on
frosh women. And you don't ever
have to suffer any consequences you
..don't choose to share. So why care at
all?
Why not forget you read this?
Then again, why not distinguish
yourself from the apes?
