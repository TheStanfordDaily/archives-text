## Vent hatred on rapists, not supportive men 
### 
Buffie Eilert's column (Daily,
Nov. 20) shows either amazing mis
understanding of men and rapists, or
tho simple sexist paranoia she tells us
to avoid!
I am asangryabout rape as anyone,
male or female. It is despicable, but,
significantly, women must re
member it is aberrant behavior for all
but brutally sick and criminal men.
Some of the things Eilert wrote,
and the context in which they were
written actually contradicts this, and
betrays an apparent latent distrust of
all men. Let's review those miscon
ceptions:
Eirst, ". . . Society today doesn't al
low women to feel comfortable walk
ing alone at night." Wrong. Rapists,
not "Society," make women fearful.
Society condemns rape emphatical
ly; it does not condone it.

Second, and actually loathsome is
. . Why don't (men) . . . restrain
their urges rather than succumbing
to them?" Rape has absolutely noth
ing to do with men being horny.
Rape is a crime of brutal violence, not
done for sexual pleasure. Does Eilert
really think that "Men" (in the all-in
clusive context of those statements)
actually make a conscious or sub
conscious choice between rape and
abstinence each time they are
aroused? Neither men nor women
normally have the urge to rape, only
rapists need restraint.
These statements are all the more
amazing because she continually re
minds her female readers not to take
extremely negative views of men,
which she apparently does herself!
Women are reminded that not all
men are monsters, some actually

have feelings! Obviously she thinks
most women look at men as uncon
trollable cavemen, and condescend
ingly reassures them that not". . . all
men are bad in this way .. . out for
their own selfish satisfaction" and
"men are not basically insensitive un
caring brutes who are unwilling to
learn!" Is there any woman who has
ever known a man well who needs to
be told these sexist stereotypes in or
der to avoid them?
What really sickens me, though, is
the implication that all men are
potential rapists. This patently untrue
implication can only serve to cause
further fear and distrust of most men,
who are all more human and caring
for the safety of women than anyone
will give us credit for. Ladies, vent
your anger on rapists, and not on all
other males who support you totally.

Mascot headline poor
"Colored mascot prevails" (Daily,
Nov. 17). If this headline is supposed
to be a joke, it is in poor taste; if it is
an inadvertence, it is just barely ex
cusable. In any case, it is a rather bla
tant example of careless journalism,
the type of journalism that this vol
ume of the Daily seems to eschew,
and rightly so. The insensitivity and
carelessness of the person respon
sible for that headline is, therefore,
called to the attention of Daily
readers.
