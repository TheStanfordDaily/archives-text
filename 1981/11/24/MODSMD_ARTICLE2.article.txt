# Heat to be turned off
## 
### Adam Goodman 
In what's being billed as an effort
to conserve energy during
Thanksgiving break, the University
will turn off the heat in many aca
demic buildings on campus, includ
ing most of the general offices and
c lassrooms in the Quad.
According to Elizabeth Vlaovich of
the Energy Program Office, student
residences and buildings that require
constant temperatures or ventilation
for special uses such as laboratories
and computers will not be affected
bv the heat shutdown.
Vkiovich also emphasized that
"only heat will be turned off, and not
electricijy."
The decision of whether or not the
heat will be shut down in an academ
ic building is made in a survey of
huildintf energy managers, Vlaovich
said. She said the building managers
of publicly used buildings can call in
their schedules for the vacation
period.
Vlaovich said the University also
plans a heat shutdown during the
Christmas and New Year's holiday
weekends as well. Though residence
halls will not be affected during the
Thanksgiving weekend, most under
graduate residences, as usual, will
shut down during the Christ
mas/New Year's break.
The last time the University at
tempted a heat shutdown to con
serve energy was during the "energy
crunch" of 1973-74, Vlaovich said.
Anyone with any questions con
cerning the heat shutdown should
contact their building energy man
ager or the Energy Program Office at
497-0725.

Day of fasting
Students at Toyon, among other campus residences, abandoned
meal cards last evening, ostensibly committing themselves to a day
without food service in support of the world's hungry. Today's fast
day is designed both to raise money and increase hunger awareness.
