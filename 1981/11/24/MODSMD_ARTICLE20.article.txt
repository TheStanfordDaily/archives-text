## Fear & Loathing in Berkeley, and X marks the spot 
### Carl Johnston 
X
Berkeley Square
20 November 1981
The Geritol-punk generation was back in form at the
Berkeley Square for a weekend gig with the Los Angeles
hand X and others last weekend.
It may just bp California's drinking laws — which don't
lot anybody younger than Alexander Haig into pits like
the Square without harassment from a uniformed rent-a
cop carding people at the door — but it seems like
"punks" are cutting deeper into their 30s every time I go
out. I don't have anything against old people (that is,
people .over 30); they have their place. They're good at
telling stories about the old days in the student move
ment, and they can show you a few neat tricks with tie
dye. I just have a difficult time watching the generation
of love looking so despondent and alienated these days.
Is love really so disillusioning? Anyways. . .
The Punts, who proceeded X, as a friend put it, sound
like a third-class Lloyds. Knowing what first class Lloyds
sound like, that's saying something. There's a boring
sameness to a lot of mediocre punk stuff in general and
the Punts in particular — it's music which sounds like it
was intended as an anthem to the Santa Ana Freeway, or
the City of San Jose. It doesn't make use of the
capabilities of the instruments the musicians are playing
and so doesn't really command the attention of an au
dience that's heard this territory explored before.
There were good points, though — for instance, the
lead singer of the Punts was intriguing in that her hair-cut
made her look like Grace Kelly when she faced one way
and Joe jftalin facing the other.
One or two of the Punt anthems were acceptable; they
showed imagination and craft. All in all though it was
songs like "Rug Shampoo" that made one listen. In
variably, however, these were slower songs. Their
lugubrious, almost maudlin, pacing indicates to me that
the Punts' "punk" image is a hollow shell camouflaging a
closeted vein of schmaltz ballads straining to surface —
just like the Lloyds. Every generation must have its Nancy
Sinatras who, with their cute hooks and cute images, ride
the waves of the current chit without taking any of the
risks that make such an endeavor interesting.
I am, of course, deeply prejudiced. The audience liked
the Punts very much and called them back for encores.
Then again, I doubt that tlrey will even be around two
years from now. After all, the only reason that ancient
Greece is considered to be such a cradle of genius now is
necause most of the works of its mediocre minds were
destroyed by Caesar when he burned the ancient library
at Carthage. If the 80s are ever considered to be great it

will be necessary to destroy and forget most of the trash
wo put up with now. So, while.l think the Punts — and X,
for that matter -- were good, they are still eminently suit
able for the flames. I'll buy the butane.
X was, in performance, almost worthy of the awesome
ly gnarly acclaim they've acquired in the Southland of
California — particularly after their appearance in the
film The Decline ... of Western Civilization that pegged
the group as being on the cutting edge of the LA punk
scene, such as it is.

X's music — which tends to get a little tedious on their
two albums once you've heard the same Chuck Berry
( lone riffed from the guitar of Billy Zoom for the sixth
time - really gets a little freaky in performance. This is in
part because their short performance time (little more
tli,in an hour) allowed thein to play only their best songs
like "White Girl," "1 os Angeles," "In this House That I
C.'all I lome," "Adult Books," and "Your Phone's Off the
I look But You're Not."
It was also good, in part, because of the group's abili
ties as live performers. John Doe, the bassist, vocalist,

and, one suspects, mastermind of X, is a genuine talent
responsible for the subtler variations in X's music that
keep the audience interested. Exene, the other lead
singer, looks like a drowned bag lady on Darvon just
dragged out of the LA River (that's meant as a compli
ment). You might also think of her as a young Leonid
Bre/hnev with a fried Cvd Charisse toupe. Unusual? Yes.
She's also fun to watch and listen to on stage. Her voice
possesses the qualities necessary to run the range from
desperation to frantic desperation interspersed with
loathing — very much in the spirit of X's music.
The lead guitarist, Billy Zoom, responsible for the
sometimes monotonous guitar work, is, if nothing else,
interesting to look at. He is blonde and blue-eyed, with a
punching-bag cute face, and a dumb, passive grin on it
that makes you wonder if there might be something
worthwhile in autism, or even frontal lobotomy.
X is verv good at what they do, all of which lies in a very
narrow genre of punk rock. Their songs all employ the
same basic bass line along with the same sort of
monotonous melody, leaving the sound of each song to
relv on verv subtle variations between what is essentially
a pair of monotones. To make something imaginative
and musically worthwhile out of such a restricted format
is a challenge, to say the least. In performance, I think
they pull it off; in their albums, I'm not quite as sure.
X does have energy, something that sets them off from
the rest of the pack very quickly. They have that little
something-extra in performance which allows them to
carry off masterful numbers like the Doors' "Soul Kitch
en" without sounding like a dumb repetition, yet retain
ing that acid-induced intensity that makes the song rec
ognizable.
They plaved three encores Friday night and certainly
would have continued to play on if the same California
drinking laws referred to above had not closed the place
down. I have nothing against California, mind you. Cali
fornia has its place; it's good at warm weather and valet
service at the finer restaurants. But it still has a lot of
things to learn before it can be considered truly civ
ilized; learning how to drink without supervision by the'
state is one of them.
One note of caution. The Berkeley Square is not lo
cated in a neighborhood conducive to peace of mind.
When I and a friend stopped out for coffee between acts
we found ourselves in the midst of an imminent robbery.
Somewhere between my danish and a second cup of
Chock Full o' Nuts two seedy characters oozed in from
the street through the back door. While one kept a look
out the othi r climbed into a box near the counter. Not
waiting to find out what was going to happen next, my
friend and I left the restaurant in mid-swallow. The
things we expose ourselves to in the name of — uh — art.
