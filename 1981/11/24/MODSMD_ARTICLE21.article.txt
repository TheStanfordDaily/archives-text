# Blier still affecting, but no need for handkerchiefs this time
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
In the world of Bertrand
filler's movies, no oiip can be
trusted; anyone might be wear
ing dynamite under his or her
clothes. Beau Pore (Stepfather)
begins with the awareness of a
couple, Remv and Martine (Pa

trick Dewaere and Nicole Gar
cia), that they have grown dis
enchanted with <each other,
but before they can find a rem
edy, Martine dies in a car crash.
Remy and his newly adolescent
stepdaughter, 'Marion (Ariel
Besse), are each other's only

consolation, and when the
child's real father, Charlie
(Maurice Ronet), takes custody
of his daughter, the girl runs
back to Remy. The two
"fathers" fight over her — in
one funny shot, she nurses the
wounds of both — until Charlie
capitulates, and Marion and
Remy live happily together for
a while. But life never con
tinues without complications
for long; one night, returning
to the apartment late after
babysitting next door, Marion
tells Remy that she is in love
with him.
In Blier's great Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs, a child prodigy

so," she snaps. The next night,
when he arrives home, she is
lying nude in his bed. She in
sists that We perceive her as a
woman, but when he orders
her to leave, she claims that she
wants merely to sleep next to
him: "Couldn't you sleep with
a little girl in your arms?" Then
she admonishes him to be
careful how he deals with her,
because she is still so young.
The poor man doesn't have a
chance.
Beau Pore, the fourth of
Blier's pictures to be released
in this country (the others are
Going Places, a sexual romp
that suggests Henry Miller, the

Artifice plays a major role in Beau Pere;
the rundown flat where Remyand
Marion live might have been resurrected
from the set of an MGM musical, and the
film seems designed to distance us from
the characters.

(Riton) seduces Carole Laure
by pleading the need for some
one gentle who can tutor him
in sexual matters. His strategy is
so brilliant that it disarms her
completely; he is asking to be
led into the adult world but he
demands the compassion due a
child.
Marion in Beau Pere plays
with the same loaded dice —
and with demonic persistence.
At first, she wants to know if he
feels a similar attraction to her,
and when he replies in the
negative, she acts offended: "If
you don't like rrly bangs, say

outrageous satire Femmes Fa
talcs, and Gef Out Your Hand
kerchiefs; another film, Cold
Cuts, has not yel opened here),
is a droll erotic comedy evolv
ing, like his earlier movies,
from his conviction that love is
full of surprises and no amount
of soul searching or restraint
can protect vou from it — or
prepare you for it. Patrick [)ew
aere's perpetually astonished
eyes are the emblem of this
theme: Remy is an un
premeditating Humbert Hum
bert repeatedly baffled by his
own helplessness. (Blier plays a

great deal with the notion of
reversed roles: at one point,
Marion gives Remy, a hack pi
anist who' is usually out of
work, a few hundred francs to
net a shave, and we register in a
horrified flash that this 14-year
old is keeping a widower more
than twice her age.)
Dewaere teamed with
Gerard Depardieu in both
Go//)# Places and Gef Out Your
Handkerchiefs, and he played
the footballer unjustly accused
of rape in Coup do Toto; mov
iegoers familiar with his en
dearing sloppiness in these pic
tures may experience a mild
shock when they see him clean
shaven and clad in a turtleneck
and sports jacket, playing lush
ballads in a bar-dining room in
the opening scene of Beau
Poro. Without the usual scruffy
beard, Dewaere's languorous
eyes are accented — Blier may
lie trying to get, or parody,
what Truffaut drew from
Charles Aznavour in Shoot the
Pi.too Player — and he looks
strikingly younger than we've
ever seen him. He looks almost
unformed. In the love scenes
with Ariel Besse, who acts with
reassurance, he seems eerily
juvenile.
Beau Poro echoes Gef Out
Your Handkerchiefs in several
ways — whenever Dewaere
and Maurice Ronet are togeth
er in a scene, the concern of
these men for their shared
daughter, which is good for a
lot of laughs, cleverly inverts
the situation in Handkerchiefs,
in which an unhappy woman's
husband and lover pool re
sources to try to cure her mel
ancholy. But stylistically the

movies are quite different.
BeauPere lacks the vivacity and
open-endedness of the earlier
comedy; visually, it's a strange
ly cool movie, conceived by
Blier and his photographer,
Sacha Vierny, mostly in blues
and whites. Artifice plays a ma
jor role in the way in which
Blier has assembled the film:
the run-down flat where Remy
and Marion live together might
have been resurrected from
the set of an old MGM musical
(An American in Paris or Funny
Faro), characters address the
camera from time to time, and
the first 20 minutes are so drily
self-conscious that they seem
designed to distance us from
the characters. Perhaps, since
Blier loosens up once the kid
propositions her stepfather, his
intention was to keep us from
being affected emotionally by
Martine's death; if so, it works.
If the first 20 minutes are un
satisfying, so are the last. Blier
attains the peak of his inven
tion when he has Charlie sug
gest that the three of them live
together. Just as we begin to
anticipate the delicious comic
possibilities of that plan, the
idea is dropped, and Blier in

troduces a more conventional
twist into the plot: Remy meets
a classical pianist (Nathalie
Baye), whose little girl Marion
has been babysitting, and his
sexual interests stray to her.
From that point the film starts
to dissipate, and not until the
final shot, which is funnv and
creepy at the same time, does it
really recover its quirkiness
and comic resonance.
Blier is experimenting in
Beau /'ore — not with new
ideas, but with new tech
niques. He's such a superlative
technician that he carries off
this sleek, glacial stvle, but
since it doesn't enhance the
theme of the movie in any ap
parent way, the stylistic victory
seems hollow. Most of Beau
Pere is extremely funny, but
none of it is poignant, as the
comic situation might certainly
have been: we are never given
to appreciate the tragic im
plications of Remy and
Charlie's failure to command
the direction of their own lives,
and so they don't take root in
our imagination as the two
bumblers in Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs did. It's a com
edy of the second tank.

Dewaere teamed with
Gerard Depardieu in both

Handkerchiefs, and he played
the footballer unjustly accused
of rape in Coup do Toto; mov
iegoers familiar with his en
dearing sloppiness in these pic
tures may experience a mild
shock when they see him clean
shaven and clad in a turtleneck
and sports jacket, playing lush
ballads in a bar-dining room in
the opening scene of Beau
Poro. Without the usual scruffy
beard, Dewaere's languorous
eyes are accented — Blier may
lie trying to get, or parody,
what Truffaut drew from
Charles Aznavour in Shoot the
Pi.too Player — and he looks
strikingly younger than we've
ever seen him. He looks almost
unformed. In the love scenes
with Ariel Besse, who acts with
reassurance, he seems eerily
juvenile.
Beau Poro echoes Gef Out
Your Handkerchiefs in several
ways — whenever Dewaere
and Maurice Ronet are togeth
er in a scene, the concern of
these men for their shared
daughter, which is good for a
lot of laughs, cleverly inverts
the situation in Handkerchiefs,
in which an unhappy woman's
husband and lover pool re
sources to try to cure her mel
ancholy. But stylistically the

movies are quite different.
BeauPere lacks the vivacity and
open-endedness of the earlier
comedy; visually, it's a strange
ly cool movie, conceived by
Blier and his photographer,
Sacha Vierny, mostly in blues
and whites. Artifice plays a ma
jor role in the way in which
Blier has assembled the film:
the run-down flat where Remy
and Marion live together might
have been resurrected from
the set of an old MGM musical
(An American in Paris or Funny
Faro), characters address the
camera from time to time, and
the first 20 minutes are so drily
self-conscious that they seem
designed to distance us from
the characters. Perhaps, since
Blier loosens up once the kid
propositions her stepfather, his
intention was to keep us from
being affected emotionally by
Martine's death; if so, it works.
If the first 20 minutes are un
satisfying, so are the last. Blier
attains the peak of his inven
tion when he has Charlie sug
gest that the three of them live
together. Just as we begin to
anticipate the delicious comic
possibilities of that plan, the
idea is dropped, and Blier in

troduces a more conventional
twist into the plot: Remy meets
a classical pianist (Nathalie
Baye), whose little girl Marion
has been babysitting, and his
sexual interests stray to her.
From that point the film starts
to dissipate, and not until the
final shot, which is funnv and
creepy at the same time, does it
really recover its quirkiness
and comic resonance.
Blier is experimenting in
Beau /'ore — not with new
ideas, but with new tech
niques. He's such a superlative
technician that he carries off
this sleek, glacial stvle, but
since it doesn't enhance the
theme of the movie in any ap
parent way, the stylistic victory
seems hollow. Most of Beau
Pere is extremely funny, but
none of it is poignant, as the
comic situation might certainly
have been: we are never given
to appreciate the tragic im
plications of Remy and
Charlie's failure to command
the direction of their own lives,
and so they don't take root in
our imagination as the two
bumblers in Get Out Your

Remy and his newly adolescent

capitulates, and Marion and

Blier is experimenting in
Beau /'ore — not with new
ideas, but with new tech
niques. He's such a superlative
technician that he carries off
this sleek, glacial stvle, but
since it doesn't enhance the
theme of the movie in any ap
parent way, the stylistic victory
seems hollow. Most of Beau
Pere is extremely funny, but
none of it is poignant, as the
comic situation might certainly
have been: we are never given
to appreciate the tragic im
plications of Remy and
Charlie's failure to command
the direction of their own lives,
and so they don't take root in
our imagination as the two
bumblers in Get Out Your
Handkerchiefs did. It's a com
edy of the second tank.
