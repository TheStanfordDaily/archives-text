"I get by with a little help
from my friends," etc. Ringo
Starr first sung that in 1967, and
it seems his best post-Beatles
recordings have used that line
as his motto. The highly suc
cessful Ringo and Goodnight
Vienna albums saw Mr. Starkey
surrounded by the best musi
cians friendship can buy. These
friends extended Ringo's musi
cal limits, making those two
albums a perfect reflection of
Ringo's public personality —
humorous, friendly, optimistic
and enjoyable. • ,
Now, after a lull in'.Ringo's
musical status (due to the spir
itless albums that he released in
the late 70s), Ringo has fallen
back on the old reliable "with a
little help from my friends" for
mula. In doing so, he's come
up with his best album since his
early 70s successes. The new
album, Stop and Smell the
Roses, is an exhilarating one
that is supported by a cast of his
musical acquaintances. That
cast includes Paul McCartney,
George Harrison, Ron Wood,
Stephen Stills, Harry Nilsson,
and so forth. Each one of the
above contributes composi
tions of above average quality
and helps to produce the
album to bolster up the sound.
However, they don't interfere
with Ringo. They let Ringo
sound, well, like typically
Ringo.

The album starts off with
"Private Property," a Mc-
Cartney composition. The
words deal with love and
foolishness ("Love monopoly,
my philosophy, don't go fool
ing with private property"),
and the tune itself is a toe-tap
ping delight dominated by
horns. In fact, it is McCartney's
best "horns-styled" song since
"Listen to What the Man Said."
Above all, it is an uplifting tune
that sets the pace for the whole
album.
The next song is written by
George Harrison (If you begin
your album with a song by an
ex-Beatle, why ruin the idea).
The song, "Wrack Mv Brain," i«t
another witty, bouncy tune in
the style of "No No Song."
Strangely, Harrison seems to
write his best light-hearted
tunes for Ringo, and the slide
guitar work by Harrison is hif.
best in a while.
The easy-going format
kept up on the album as we *r£
hit with songs that sum tifV*
Ringo's qualities — from the'fj
diculous ("Dead Giveaway")to'
the autobiographical ("Drum
ming Is My Madness"), from
his country-music influences
("Sure To Fall") to his sincerity
of love ("You've Got a Nice
Way." This song is Stephen
Stills' contribution, and he
adds a CSN guitar and vocal
backup to this surprisingly
sweet song.
However, the two most
meaningful songs are "Back
Off Boogaloo" and the title
track. The title track is a
tongue-in-cheek song that

somehow is trying to get a
message across. In it, Ringo
puts down the hustle and bus
tle of the 80s, and urges people
to take their time and see the
world around them — to stop
and smell the roses. His sense
of humor enters this song
though, which lets us always
keep in mind that it is lovable
Ringo singing the message —
"Stop and take the time.to
smell the roses; stop and take
the time to fill your noses
. . .stop and take the time to
buv this album . . .
The final track, "Back Off
Boogaloo" is a remake of the
1972 hit for Ringo. Although it
lacks the roughness of the ori
ginal with its new lush horn ar
rangement, the song has an
added feature of incorporating
the songs of Ringo's past into it.
The song itself starts off with
the intro to "It Don't Come
Fasy," and throughout the
song we hear snatches of "Lady
Madonna," "Help," "Good
Day Sunshine," "Baby, You're
a Rich Man," and of course,
"With a Little Help From My
Friends."
Overall, Stop and Smell the
Roses is a good comeback for
one of the nicest musicians in
the business. The only problem
with it is the problem that will
most likely keep Ringo from
contributing to a truly substan
tial album. The fact is that
Ringo shows off his best quali
ties when he is a part of a rock
and roll group. No matter how
consistent his drumming may
beon thisalbum, he reallydoes
not rock out because there is

no suitable material for him to
rock out on. When McCartney
or Harrison write him a song,
he doesn't get a classic rocker;
instead, he gets a Ringo-style
number. Now this is okay if he
was part of a group because he

can prove himself on the
group's true rock numbers.
I fere though, he is stuck in the
formula and no matter bow en
joyable it is (as this album is), I
still wish that he could some
how start drumming again in

the rock and roll Vense.
Without this, we'll never hear
drumming like on "Birthday,"
"Ticket to Ride," or "The End."
However, this is a personal
wish for a Ringo that is newly
married and happily com

fortable with his celebrity sta
tus. Therefore, in these terms
the album succeeds. It's the
b«>st Ringo album in years and a
happy one in lieu of the past
year's events. The album's ded
ication, "Thanks to mv three
brothers" is the only thing on
the album that evokes any
sense of loss because we know
that the "missing" ' third
brother would have been one
of those "friends" that would
have contributed greatly to the
success of this album.

Tor an album entitled Reac

politically minded record in
cluding commentaries on the
inevitable nuclear meltdown
— especially if that record is
the work of rock poet/social
protester Neil Young. But
throughout his solo career,
Young has never stayed with a
musical formula for more than
one or two albums in a row.
Usually his style of music has
changed drastically from
album to album (i.e., from the
mellow number one Harvest
album to the following acid
rock culture of Tonight's the
Night).
Reactor is no different in its
difference, either. After the
top ten success of Rust Never
Sleeps, Young put out the
country-tinged Hawks and
Doves, which failed to dent the
top twenty. Now to continue
his erratic behavior, we are giv
