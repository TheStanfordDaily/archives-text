# Ringo Starr's typical, Neil Young typically atypical

Ringo Starr
Stop and Smell the Roses

"I get by with a little help
from my friends," etc. Ringo
Starr first sung that in 1967, and
it seems his best post-Beatles
recordings have used that line
as his motto. The highly suc
cessful Ringo and Goodnight
Vienna albums saw Mr. Starkey
surrounded by the best musi
cians friendship can buy. These
friends extended Ringo's musi
cal limits, making those two
albums a perfect reflection of
Ringo's public personality —
humorous, friendly, optimistic
and enjoyable. • ,
Now, after a lull in'.Ringo's
musical status (due to the spir
itless albums that he released in
the late 70s), Ringo has fallen
back on the old reliable "with a
little help from my friends" for
mula. In doing so, he's come
up with his best album since his
early 70s successes. The new
album, Stop and Smell the
Roses, is an exhilarating one
that is supported by a cast of his
musical acquaintances. That
cast includes Paul McCartney,
George Harrison, Ron Wood,
Stephen Stills, Harry Nilsson,
and so forth. Each one of the
above contributes composi
tions of above average quality
and helps to produce the
album to bolster up the sound.
However, they don't interfere
with Ringo. They let Ringo
sound, well, like typically
Ringo.

The album starts off with
"Private Property," a Mc-
Cartney composition. The
words deal with love and
foolishness ("Love monopoly,
my philosophy, don't go fool
ing with private property"),
and the tune itself is a toe-tap
ping delight dominated by
horns. In fact, it is McCartney's
best "horns-styled" song since
"Listen to What the Man Said."
Above all, it is an uplifting tune
that sets the pace for the whole
album.
The next song is written by
George Harrison (If you begin
your album with a song by an
ex-Beatle, why ruin the idea).
The song, "Wrack Mv Brain," i«t
another witty, bouncy tune in
the style of "No No Song."
Strangely, Harrison seems to
write his best light-hearted
tunes for Ringo, and the slide
guitar work by Harrison is hif.
best in a while.
The easy-going format
kept up on the album as we *r£
hit with songs that sum tifV*
Ringo's qualities — from the'fj
diculous ("Dead Giveaway")to'
the autobiographical ("Drum
ming Is My Madness"), from
his country-music influences
("Sure To Fall") to his sincerity
of love ("You've Got a Nice
Way." This song is Stephen
Stills' contribution, and he
adds a CSN guitar and vocal
backup to this surprisingly
sweet song.
However, the two most
meaningful songs are "Back
Off Boogaloo" and the title
track. The title track is a
tongue-in-cheek song that

somehow is trying to get a
message across. In it, Ringo
puts down the hustle and bus
tle of the 80s, and urges people
to take their time and see the
world around them — to stop
and smell the roses. His sense
of humor enters this song
though, which lets us always
keep in mind that it is lovable
Ringo singing the message —
"Stop and take the time.to
smell the roses; stop and take
the time to fill your noses
. . .stop and take the time to
buv this album . . .
The final track, "Back Off
Boogaloo" is a remake of the
1972 hit for Ringo. Although it
lacks the roughness of the ori
ginal with its new lush horn ar
rangement, the song has an
added feature of incorporating
the songs of Ringo's past into it.
The song itself starts off with
the intro to "It Don't Come
Fasy," and throughout the
song we hear snatches of "Lady
Madonna," "Help," "Good
Day Sunshine," "Baby, You're
a Rich Man," and of course,
"With a Little Help From My
Friends."
Overall, Stop and Smell the
Roses is a good comeback for
one of the nicest musicians in
the business. The only problem
with it is the problem that will
most likely keep Ringo from
contributing to a truly substan
tial album. The fact is that
Ringo shows off his best quali
ties when he is a part of a rock
and roll group. No matter how
consistent his drumming may
beon thisalbum, he reallydoes
not rock out because there is

no suitable material for him to
rock out on. When McCartney
or Harrison write him a song,
he doesn't get a classic rocker;
instead, he gets a Ringo-style
number. Now this is okay if he
was part of a group because he

can prove himself on the
group's true rock numbers.
I fere though, he is stuck in the
formula and no matter bow en
joyable it is (as this album is), I
still wish that he could some
how start drumming again in

the rock and roll Vense.
Without this, we'll never hear
drumming like on "Birthday,"
"Ticket to Ride," or "The End."
However, this is a personal
wish for a Ringo that is newly
married and happily com

fortable with his celebrity sta
tus. Therefore, in these terms
the album succeeds. It's the
b«>st Ringo album in years and a
happy one in lieu of the past
year's events. The album's ded
ication, "Thanks to mv three
brothers" is the only thing on
the album that evokes any
sense of loss because we know
that the "missing" ' third
brother would have been one
of those "friends" that would
have contributed greatly to the
success of this album.
Neil Young
Reactor
Reprise Records
Tor an album entitled Reac
tor, one would expect a very
politically minded record in
cluding commentaries on the
inevitable nuclear meltdown
— especially if that record is
the work of rock poet/social
protester Neil Young. But
throughout his solo career,
Young has never stayed with a
musical formula for more than
one or two albums in a row.
Usually his style of music has
changed drastically from
album to album (i.e., from the
mellow number one Harvest
album to the following acid
rock culture of Tonight's the
Night).
Reactor is no different in its
difference, either. After the
top ten success of Rust Never
Sleeps, Young put out the
country-tinged Hawks and
Doves, which failed to dent the
top twenty. Now to continue
his erratic behavior, we are giv

en the hard-rock persona of
Neil Young. Since there is so
much diversity from album to
album in Young's work, it is
hard for his enthusiasts to keep
up with what he is doing. In
doing so, he loses many
"potential" listeners.
For this album, Neil Young
has returned to the hard rocker
stance that he took on previous
LPs such as Time Fades Away
and Zuma. In doing so it is a
complete back-to-basics proc-

ess, as this album uses the bare
essentials in instruments and
studio effects. Only electric
guitar, bass,and drums are
used, and there are no acoustic
guitars at all. The sound is very
gritty, mean and potent — the
tunes attack like a hurricane
with Young's driving guitarand
Crazy Horse's full rhythm sec
tion, led by Ralph Molina's
drumming.
The music itself owes a lot to
the musicians who have
shaped Young's style of
playing. On many of the new
songs, we can hear snatches of
guitar solos very reminiscent of
popular classics. On "Rapid
Transit" and "Shots" we hear
licks from Hendrix' version of
"All Along the Watchtower"

and Dylan's "Like a Rolling
Stone". On "Surfer loe and
Moe the Sleaze", we hear a
similar guitar background to
Eric Clapton's on the Beatles'
"While My Guitar Gently
Weeps". And on "Southern Pa
cific", we are given a copy of
"Ghost Riders in the Sky",
though Young's blazing guitar
is far better than the Outlaws'.
Now this may seem a draw
back if one is considering the
originality of Young's material.
However, Young does add

some flourishes of his own and
onlv patterns his guitar playing
on those he (deservedly) ad
mires. The urgency that these
tunes bring forth more than
offsets the fact that he is copy
ing others, and it is to his credit
that he can copy them at all and
still add his own unique style.
So far I have avoided the sub
ject of the album's lyrics. For
good reason. Mostly, Young
has given up the rock-poet
style prevalent on most of his
classic works. Instead, he has
written lyrics that are strangely
despairing. We are given very
few personal insights and in
stead we are subjected to a real
piece of trash called "T-Bone"
(a nine minute overlong guitar

anthem repeating the words
"Got mashed potatoes/Ain't
got no T-Bone" over and over).
The only purpose for this song
would be as the theme song for
Food Service.
Otherwise, the majority of
the songs are your everyday
run-of-the-mill apocalyptic vi
sions such as "Surfer Joe and
Moe the Sleaze", "Shots", and
"Opera Star". The total effect is
very disheartening. When one
hears such new lines as "Now
I'm left to roll down the long
decline" and "Some things
never change/they stay the
way they are", it's very depress
ing — especially if one con
siders that this is the same per
son who said he'd always "be
searching for that heart of
gold" and "It's .better to burn
out than to fade away".
Therefore, Young's lyrics do
not do Reactor justice. In order
to appreciate this album then,
one has to listen to the pow
erful guitar playing of Young.
For example, the guitar and
drum work of "Southern Pacif
ic" move the song at a
breakneck pace leaving us in
awe as it passes by. The same
drive and immediacy is felt on
the album's high point,
"Shots". It is a rapidfire assault
on the senses, throwing the lis
tener into the turmoil of the
song. When Young sings
"Shots, I hear shots, I keep
hearing shots", the listener
hears them too as Young's
guitar is transformed into a
shattering shotgun.
Overall, Reactor has a lot of
flaws, but they are small in
comparison with the music's
driving force. This is an in
credible achievement in that
(he album is carried by Young's
musical ability, rather than by
his lyrical prose. The im
mediacy and passion of the
music itelf tend to minimize
the flaws and maximize the
strengths. This is a completely
new style for Young and it may
be discouraging to many fans
of his words. However, on Re
actor the music has the last
word.
