# GSH in an SF soapbox

Gil Scott-Heron
The Old Waldorf/San Francisco
2 November 1981
If all political speech writers wrote
and orated like Gil Scott-Heron, the
bland world of politics would have
some desperately needed color.
GSH and his band are not your or
dinary, run-of-the-mill fusion group.
Instead of just combining the sounds of
jazz and rock, they fuse together poli
tics and music with a catchy beat and
lyrics. They are a truly unique and in
novative band, especially in concert,
which they successfully exhibited last
Sunday at the Old Waldorf.
But before vye venture into GSH's
music politics, let us take a hard look at
the Old Waldorf first. It's high time the
Waldorf realized that if it wants to be a
classy S.F. club, it has to act like one.
One should not have to stand for nearly
three hours when he just paid $8.50 to
see a show in a so-called "nice" night
club. Sure, there were seats for those
who stood, but they had picturesque
viewsofthe back of a synthesizer or sax
ophone player.
The Waldorf also should realign its
aisles. I was fortunate enough to sit on
one last Sunday and view people walk
ing back and forth between me and the
stage. It felt like watching a show while
sitting in the main lobby of the Hyatt
Regency.
And here is some advice for your next
visit to the Waldorf: wear a hard hat. In
between acts, one of the ceiling tiles

came tumbling down to rest com
fortably on some poor soul's head.
Whooops!
Now, bark to the show. Opening tor
GSH was comedian Ray Booker, who
contrasted black and white people in
various situations. He also commented
on Los Angeles' mass transit: "Their
(L.A.'s) public transportation system
makes Muni look like a limosine ser
vice." The best part about Booker was
that he put the audience at ease, and
overall was a much better "warm-up"
than some rag-tag band that usually
opens at the Waldorf.
Once the audience was relaxed, after
a half hour intermission, GSH appeared
on stage. With his band playing a
rhythmy tune in the background, he
gave a five minute political speech,
which was chock full of pessimism and
cynicism: "Fifty-one percent (of the
people) voted for nobody (in the 1980
Presidential election). Therefore, dem
ocratically nobody should be presi
dent," he pointed out. "And I've come
to the conclusion that there is no presi
dent."
"The people wanted a hero of the
30's or 40's, like John Wayne, but he was
no longer available," GSH continued.
He also commented on the oppression
of minorities in America.
The speech concluded, GSH went
into a song entitled "Real to Reel" from
his latest album, "Reflections." All
GSH's tunes included lyrics, most of
which were politically based, and there
were few solos by the other eight band
members.
The songs varied from jazz fusion to

pop to soul to oven funk and reggae.
Before each piece, GSM explained its
background and tfie political message.
The group's fifth song was "Gun,"
also from the 1981 LP, and perhaps the
best tune of the hour and a half per
formance. Two songs later, GSH et al.
switched into a reggae beat lead by Pe
ter Tosh look alike, Ethan Ivy. "Angel
Dust," a tune with a spooky rhythm, fol
lowed, with GSH letting members of
the audience help hi in sing the chorus.
I he song began with an adequate biting
bass solo by Robert Gordon, who was
literally shorter than his bass.
GSH and co. finished with an anti-nu
clear power tune entitled "Shut 'em
Down," an excellent song with a very
jumpy base-line, highlighted by a
brilliant guitar solo by Ed Brady. Leon
Russell, who made a special appearance
with GSH for the S.F. shows, had a lucid
saxophone solo, his best of the per
formance as well.
The group's only encore was
"Madison Avenue," which included a
percussion solo with eight of the nine
band members playing some sort of
percussion instrument.
Perhaps the only pitfall in their per
formance was the downplay of the few
solos that GSH left room for in the
show. The solos were short and many of
them were not loud enough to discern
from the rest of the music. But what
makes GSH so downright good is his
ability to bring his political beliefs intoa
song and keep it from sounding like a
"We Shall Overcome" hymn. In an era
where more political awareness is nec
essary, GSH is doing his part to ac
complish this difficult task in an en
joyable and painless way.

pop to soul to oven funk and reggae.
Before each piece, GSM explained its
background and tfie political message.
The group's fifth song was "Gun,"
also from the 1981 LP, and perhaps the
best tune of the hour and a half per
formance. Two songs later, GSH et al.
switched into a reggae beat lead by Pe
ter Tosh look alike, Ethan Ivy. "Angel
Dust," a tune with a spooky rhythm, fol
lowed, with GSH letting members of
the audience help hi in sing the chorus.
I he song began with an adequate biting
bass solo by Robert Gordon, who was
literally shorter than his bass.
GSH and co. finished with an anti-nu
clear power tune entitled "Shut 'em
Down," an excellent song with a very
jumpy base-line, highlighted by a
brilliant guitar solo by Ed Brady. Leon
Russell, who made a special appearance
with GSH for the S.F. shows, had a lucid
saxophone solo, his best of the per
formance as well.
The group's only encore was
"Madison Avenue," which included a
percussion solo with eight of the nine
band members playing some sort of
percussion instrument.
Perhaps the only pitfall in their per
formance was the downplay of the few
solos that GSH left room for in the
show. The solos were short and many of
them were not loud enough to discern
from the rest of the music. But what
makes GSH so downright good is his
ability to bring his political beliefs intoa
song and keep it from sounding like a
"We Shall Overcome" hymn. In an era
where more political awareness is nec
essary, GSH is doing his part to ac
complish this difficult task in an en
joyable and painless way.
Gil Scott-Heron
The Old Waldorf/San Francisco
2 November 1981
If all political speech writers wrote
and orated like Gil Scott-Heron, the
bland world of politics would have
some desperately needed color.
GSH and his band are not your or
dinary, run-of-the-mill fusion group.
Instead of just combining the sounds of
jazz and rock, they fuse together poli
tics and music with a catchy beat and
lyrics. They are a truly unique and in
novative band, especially in concert,
which they successfully exhibited last
Sunday at the Old Waldorf.
But before vye venture into GSH's
music politics, let us take a hard look at
the Old Waldorf first. It's high time the
Waldorf realized that if it wants to be a
classy S.F. club, it has to act like one.
One should not have to stand for nearly
three hours when he just paid $8.50 to
see a show in a so-called "nice" night
club. Sure, there were seats for those
who stood, but they had picturesque
viewsofthe back of a synthesizer or sax
ophone player.
The Waldorf also should realign its
aisles. I was fortunate enough to sit on
one last Sunday and view people walk
ing back and forth between me and the
stage. It felt like watching a show while
sitting in the main lobby of the Hyatt
Regency.
And here is some advice for your next
visit to the Waldorf: wear a hard hat. In
between acts, one of the ceiling tiles

came tumbling down to rest com
fortably on some poor soul's head.
Whooops!
Now, bark to the show. Opening tor
GSH was comedian Ray Booker, who
contrasted black and white people in
various situations. He also commented
on Los Angeles' mass transit: "Their
(L.A.'s) public transportation system
makes Muni look like a limosine ser
vice." The best part about Booker was
that he put the audience at ease, and
overall was a much better "warm-up"
than some rag-tag band that usually
opens at the Waldorf.
Once the audience was relaxed, after
a half hour intermission, GSH appeared
on stage. With his band playing a
rhythmy tune in the background, he
gave a five minute political speech,
which was chock full of pessimism and
cynicism: "Fifty-one percent (of the
people) voted for nobody (in the 1980
Presidential election). Therefore, dem
ocratically nobody should be presi
dent," he pointed out. "And I've come
to the conclusion that there is no presi
dent."
"The people wanted a hero of the
30's or 40's, like John Wayne, but he was
no longer available," GSH continued.
He also commented on the oppression
of minorities in America.
The speech concluded, GSH went
into a song entitled "Real to Reel" from
his latest album, "Reflections." All
GSH's tunes included lyrics, most of
which were politically based, and there
were few solos by the other eight band
members.
The songs varied from jazz fusion to

pop to soul to oven funk and reggae.
