Brezhnev rejects proposals
ii
Bonn, West Germany — Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev yesterday rejected President
Ronald Reagan's proposal for eliminating Eu
ropean-range nuclear missiles, but offered a
unilateral reduction of Soviet missiles as "a
gesture of good will."
Brezhnev appeared to make his offer cont
ingent on the United States accepting a
moratorium on deploying or upgrading medi
um-range nuclear delivery systems during U.S.-
Soviet arms talks.
In a banquet speech following a day of talks
with Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Brezhnev re
newed the Kremlin call for such a moratorium,
saying that if the United States accepted, he
.would suspend further stationing of multiple
warhead SS-20 missiles as well as other such sys
tems.
Schmidt rejected Brezhnev's offer of a
moratorium on stationing new nuclear weap
ons in Europe because it would leave the Soviet
missiles still threatening the West, West Ger
man government spokesman Kurt Becker said.
, Soviet spokesman Leonid Zamvatin said Sovi
et missiles were deployed to counter U.S. air
and sea weapons.
Schmidt said 250 SS-20 Soviet missiles armed
with 750 warheads were aimed at Western Eu
rope, and told Brezhnev: "If you want no (new)
stationing in Europe, you must take away all
SS-205."
, However, West German sources said
Brezhnev offered to withdraw an unspecified
number of SS-20s to the eastern side of the Urals
if the United States would forgo placing new
weapons in Europe.
Joint Sinai patrol announced
London — Britain, France, the Netherlands
and Italy announced yesterday they will take
part in a U.S.-sponsored force to patrol the Sinai
after Israel completes its withdrawal from that
region in April.
The announcement was delayed for three
weeks by what diplomats said was a struggle
over wording to avoid angering Israel and the
Arab states and to satisfy the 10 Common Mar
ket countries.
In making the announcement, the four gov
ernments reaffirmed their support of the so
called "European intiative" for a Mideast peace
that calls for the PLO to be brought into the
Camp David process.
A French foreign ministry official said at a
briefing that the United States, Egypt and Israel,
which had asked Europeans to join the force,
were informed of the decision to go ahead with
it on Sunday.
Allen claims sale date mistake
Washington — National security adviser
Richard Allen wrote in a government financial
disclosure statement that he sold his consulting
firm in January 1978, but now, according to a
White House lawyer, says the sale actually took
place early this year.
Questioned about the sale date, White House
counsel Fred Fielding said Allen sent him a
memo last week stating that he had mistakenly
put down the 1978 date and had meant to write
January 1981.
In the disclosure statement, fiied last Febru
ary, Allen said he no longer was president of
Potomac International Corp. as of January 1978
and added in parentheses "sold business."
But Fielding could not explain why if the sale
of Potomac International had occurred in Janu

arv 1981, there was no mention of either the sale
or Allen's recent ownership of the firm'under
the income and assets section of the financial
questionnaire.

eration in Northern Ireland.

spower plants said they would join the strike, but
officials of the government electricity board
said senior engineers would keep the plants

porter Rita Jensen, who lived with murder sus
pect Katherine Boudin in a New York City
apartment, was dismissed from the newspaper
Friday.
J Boudin, a figure in the Weather Under
ground, and three others were arrested Oct. 20,
after a shootout in Nvack, New York, during a

awaiting trial on three counts of murder, and
one count each of Jobbery and conspiracy.

Cal coach gets job axe
Berkeley — Roger Theder was fired yesterday
after four seasons as the University of Califor
nia's football coach and one of his 1981 con
querors, Jack Elway of San Jose State, father of
Stanford quarterback John Elway, was among
the first men considered for the job opening.
"I do want to find out more about Cal. I'm in
terested," said Elway.
In a prepared statement, Theder said he was
"extremely hurt and very disappointed by the
decision. I have no bitternessand anger. On the
contrary, I have only great respect and admira
tion for the University of California and always
will have."
"It is with regret that we are relieving Roger
Theder of his duties as head footbajl coach,"
said Dave Maggard, the university's athletic di
rector.
"I have great respect for Rogej, and his
knowledge of the game of football. He is a per
son of fine character."
The Stanford loss probably did not trigger the
firing, however. Rumors had been abundant for
weeks that Theder was finished, and specula
tion about his successor has been widespread.
Theder, who served as an assistant coach
before being elevated to head coach, was ex
tremely popular with his players, who reported
ly met with Maggard last week.

FBI arrests Brink's suspect
San Francisco — An ex-Brink's guard charged
with t«ikinw; 51.85 million from his own armored
van in the second-largest Brink's theft ever was
quietly arrested by FBI agents near a busy San
Francisco supermarket.
George Manuel Bosque, 26, the object of an
intensive international manhunt, was unarmed
and offered no resistance Sunday night as he
was arrested in the parking lot of one of the
city's busiest markets, the FBI said. No further
details of the arrest were given. Bosque was
scheduled for arraignment today.
Haig signs weapons treaty
Mexico City — In a move welcomed by the
Mexican government, Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig yesterday delivered the final docu
ments committing the United States to a treaty
that would make Latin America a zone free of
atomic weapons.
But Haig, here on a 24-hour visit, was much
less likely to win Mexican support for his efforts
to curb a buildup of conventional arms in
Nicaragua, including the possible shipment of
MiG fighter planes from the Soviet Union.
After the first private meeting here Monday
between Haig and Mexican Foreign Minister
Jorge Castaneda, Haig spokesman Dean Fisher
said the session "reflected the common preoc
cupation of both countries with developments
in Central America, particularly Nicaragua." Al
though the two countries do not have identyral
views, Fisher said, there was "a sense of mutLal
concern in the search for ways to deal with.'fne
problems of Nicaragua."
The Reagan administration has said it fears
Nicaragua will become another Cuban-style
armed camp spreading lemst revolution
through Central America. &jt Mexico and
some other nations fear United States
will intervene militarily in Nicaragua and per
haps, in their view, add to the turmoil already
flowing through that troubled region.
Congress last week gave its advice and con
sent to the treaty, under which the United
States agrees "not to test, produce or deploy
nuclear weapons in Latin America."
Asked if he would ask Mexico to us£ its in
fluence in Nicaragua to halt what de
scribes as the "drift towards totalitarianism" in
that country, Haig said, "That's a decision for
them to make. It's not for us to come down here
and wag a finger at their basicapproach. But we
do know that Mexico shares our basic values,
the desire for peaceful change, and that's a
pretty sound platform."
Haig said Nicaragua was aiming at creating a
50,000-person Army and a militia of 200,000 — a
buildup he said would leave only Brazil and
Cuba with larger forces in Latin America.
