# Commerce Dept. looks into student research

A recent inquiry by the U.S. De
partment of Commerce into the re
search activities of a student from the
People's Republic of China has raised
questions about government at
tempts to restrict University research.
Flectrical Engineering Prof. Bruce
Lusignan said he received a question
naire and a list of all trade-restricted
areas two weeks ago from the Com
merce Department. The question
naire was concerned with material
being taught to a graduate student
from China, he said.
Lusignan, who teaches com
munications technology and plan
ning, including all aspects of com
munications satellites, said he re
fused to answer the questionnaire.
. "The first thing (the questionnaire) *.
said was that it was not concerned
with information in the public do
main, and everything I teach is public
information," Lusignan explained.
After receiving the letter, Lusignan
consulted with the provost's office,
which supported his decision not to
answer the inquiry, according to
provost official Pat Devaney, as
sociate dean of graduate studies.
"Our contention was that our re
search was public," Devaney said.
"In order to monitor the activities of
this subset of foreign students a
drastic restriction of our open en

vironment would be necessary."
In addition, Devanev said the prac
tice of continually answering ques
tions concerning foreign students
would be an "intolerable adminis
trative burden."
Devaney said the provost's office
concluded that export administrative
regulations do not apply to research
at Stanford because the regulations
specifically exempt generally avail
able information.
Lusignan said that in the past he has
received F. 8.1, inquiries into the ac
tivities of students from Soviet-bloc
countries, but he has always refused
to answer them. "I typically tell them
I don't spy on students," he said.
This is, however, the first time
questions relating to the restriction
of trade have been asked, Lusignan
said. "Questions relating to the re
striction of trade are disturbing," he
said. "I can understand much more
easily why the government is con
cerned with military information,"
he added.
The question of restricting Univer
sity research according to Lusignan,
has recently surfaced at a number of
major universities. This is related to
legislation being considered by Con
gress to protect U.S. technology in
foreign markets, he added.
"The impression I get is that major
universities are not going to restrict
foreign students," Lusignan said.
