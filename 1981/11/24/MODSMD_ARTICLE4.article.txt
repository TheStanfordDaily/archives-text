# Reagan shuts down government

i>v I ho Washington Post
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, in a spirited
budget struggle with Congress, closed the government
yesterday, the first time a chief executive has ordered so
massive a shutdown of federal operations.
Hut after Congress passed a short-term funding bill,
the ad ministration said the government would be back
in business today.
It was like a bad play that opens one day and closes the
next — only in reverse.
: !m prev«de'W hegarwhe df'y with his promised vet oof
the federal spending bill and gave sweeping orders to
close down non-essential government offices; then
Congress agreed to continue spending at current levels
until Dec. 15; and the way was cleared for all federal em
ployees to return to their jobs today.
The most histrionic of the almost annual crises over
keeping the government in spending money sent
thousands of non-essential workers home early, closed
the Statue of Liberty, forced the secretary of transporta
tion to consider using public transport instead of his
chauffeur-driven limousine — and settled nothing.

The workers furloughed yesterday were theoretically
not to he paid for their time away from work, but that pay
probably will be restored based on the resolution of
smaller shutdowns affecting a few departments in the
past. Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), chairman of the Sen
ate Appropriations Committee, and other senators made
clear on the Senate floor that pay would be restored this
time, too.
The latest crisis passed without resolving the dispute
over federal spending. It ended with an agreement be
twet) J{e..tgan and tike the:;: Th.tnk g:\
inn holiday first and fight over the budget later.
Before reaching agreement, the president blamed
congressional Democrats, and Democratic leaders fired
verbal salvos back at Reagan.
The Democratic-controlled House, followed by the
Rppublican-controled Senate, then accepted the com
promise Reagan had offered and extended federal
spending at its current level until Dec. 15.
At 7:55 a.m. EST, Reagan received the $428 billion
emergency spending bill from Congress that he had
promised to veto. He quickly kepfHis
promise, leaving most of the bureau
cracy without funds to carry on its
work. The veto did not interfere with
defense, other activities essential to
protection of life and property or the
mailing of Social Security and other
benefit checks.
A few minutes later, Reagan took
his message before the television
cameras, declaring that he had been
forced to choose between a
"budget-busting" bill and the risk of
interrupting government activities
and services.
He chose to cast the first veto of his
administration, Reagan said, because
despite the "possibility of some tem
porary hardship" the United States
would face "a far greater threat to all
Americans" from "continuing the
past budget-busting policies of big
spending and big deficits."
With increasing regularity in re
cent years, Congress has failed to
send appropriations bills to the presi
dent in time for action before dead
lines that prohibit federal spending
on many activities. But never before

have all the agencies and depart
ments been affected as they were
when the deadline passed at mid
night Friday, nor has a president ever
moved so forcefully to order a shut
down.
Bv late afternoon, Congress, as
eager to get out of town for the
holidays as was the president, who
had postponed his departure for his
California ranch from Sunday night,
opted for the deferral.
Reagan, who throughout his politi
cal career has argued in favor of
smaller government, declared: "This
is not business as usual. This is no<
theatrics. It's for real."
He then gave orders that non-es
sential government workers be sent
home as early as possible.
