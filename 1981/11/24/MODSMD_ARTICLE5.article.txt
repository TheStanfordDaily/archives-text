# Village Council discusses housing
## 
### Dan McMillan 
Newly elected members of the
Escondido Village Council met last
night for the first time since the
group disbanded last spring, with
next year's rent and the limited-stay
housing policy topping the the agen
da.
The limited-stay policy is designed
to favor incoming graduate students
in the draw for on-campus housing.
Among continuing students, singles
and married couples without chil
dren may stay one year in the hous
ing, and then enter a lottery for the
right to stay longer. Married students
with children may stay four years,
with a possible one-year extension.
This policy went into effect this fall.
Until then, students could stay in

definitely in graduate housing.
"They just railroaded this through
without consulting the students,"
said one woman at the meeting. Most
of those present said they resent the
new policy and question how the
University made its decision. Escon
dido Director Jan Marx countered
that last year's Village Council partic
ipated in the decision, and that of
ficials took nearly a year hearing vari
ous opinions on the question.
"The chances of changing the stay
policy now are virtually nil," said Bill
Smith of the Graduate Students' As
sociation, adding that "what matters
anyway is the percentage they allqjto
incoming students. We should try Jo
affect that."
The University won't set next year's

rents until winter quarter, hut all of
those at the meeting discussed a
rumored 14 percent increase. The
council members question where
their rent money is going. Smith said
he thought that "(University officials)
want a rent increase to finance new
housing — faculty and under
graduate housing."
Fscondido Facilities Manager Jerry
Parks said at the meeting that "the
University has committed itself to
building 800 new spaces. Rents will
absorb part of that cost. It's always
been done that way." He added that
faculty housing has a completely sep
arate budget, and draws no money
from student rents.
Even if the rent is fair, Marx said last
week she welcomes a rent protest:
"I'm hoping it will raise participation
in the Village Council."
Fred Buhl of the Council of Presi
dents said Marx's comment underlies
"a newfound militancy among stu
dents on housing issues. We think
the Village Council will reflect this."
According to Marx, "the council
has tremendous potential" and has
been very active. It has sponsored a
Fall Faire and Spring Flea Market, art
shows, dances and film series.
The council has also helped make
important decisions about Escondido
Village: it lobbied for the village
nursery school and for improved
lighting. When the Santa Clara Coun
ty library in Escondido closed in the
aftermath of Proposition 13, the Vil
lage Council made the building into

an activities center, now known as
Pepper Tree House.
In the past, University adminis
trators frequently consulted the
council before making major de
cisions that affected Escondido and
met regularly with council members.
But in recent months, according to
Marx, "only haphazard consultation
has been possible — basically whoev
er walks into the office with a com
plaint."
Last spring the council dissolved as
a result of apathy. "I'd hoped some
one would pick up the pieces this fall,
but it didn't happen," said Marx. So,
she called a meeting for those in
terested and formed a committee,
which held elections last week in
Escondido. Normally the incumbent
council members hold elections in
early October.
