# Professors assign their own books...

### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Around the beginning of every quarter, stu
dents in the Stanford Bookstore can be heard
joking sarcastically about having to buy "re
quired" books written by the professor who is
teaching the course. These books are often the
major textbook for the entire quarter in the
.course, and students sometimes speculate
whether the main purpose in requiring these
texts was to increase royalty checks for the au
thor.
But according to representatives from several
presses and publishing houses, often the
amount of money a professor receives in royal
ties on an order of their own books is "min
iscule." Royalties average around 10 percent of
an order, often going up to 15 percent if more
than 10,000 copies of the book have been or
dered cumulatively. Individual contracts with
publishing houses may vary.
. Professors claim that they have other reasons
"for using their own books.
"For one thing, I think my text is the best of its
kind," said Business School Prof. George Bach,
who taught Economics 1 two yeafs ago from his
own textbook and workbook. "Basically, the
point of my book is to provide basic analysis,
and then I would apply the analysis to real prob
lems in class."
Albert Elsen, professor of art hijtory here,
also uses his own book as one of'the main

sources for his introduction tp art history
course. "It provides background /or t{ie course
which I need students to have un
derstand what I'm trying to teach," hetaid.
Some professors here said they feel strongly
that the students should not have to pay the
royalties for the books they wrote and require
in their courses.
Prof. William Rivers of the Communication
Department, for instance, refunds approx
imately $2 to every student when they have to
buy his books.
"I feel my book is the best on the subject, so I
require it,"he said. "I just don't feel it's right
that students should think (making money is)
why I require the book "
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska said that rev
enues from a book he requires which he edited,
Blue Collar Workers in Eastern Europe, go to
Amnesty International and not to himself.
"It's one of six or eight books in the course,"
he said, "and it's the only one of it's kind, so I
use it."
Perhaps because there are numerous reasons
Jfor a professor to use his or her own book, the
University does not have a specific policy with
Jregard to this practice.
"I don't think there's a specific at any
University for either restricting or regulating
professors in their use of material they've writ
ten," said Dean of Humanities and Sciences

Norm Wessells.
Assoc. Dean of Humanities and Sciences
David Kennedy said, "I'd hate to see a specific
policy, since there are so many individual fac
tors which come into play in something like
this." He said that in some cases, professors use
a book which has specifically grown out of
teaching .1 particular course.
112 "In that sense, they feel it's the best book on
the subject," he said. "They're comfortable
with it."
Nevertheless, sometimes students complain
about the use of these books.
University Ombudsman John Goheen said
that although he's nevef received a formal com
plaint from anyone regarding a professor using
his own hook in a course, "I have received re
marks, which are sometimes cynical, on the is
sue." Goheen said that, to his knowledge, no
action has ever been taken on the issue.
"I've received a few complaints from stu
dents, usually about the textbook," said J.
Martin Evans, professor of Fnglish who served
as associate dean of Humanities and Sciences
last vear "They say they would prefer to use
something else." Evans said he hadn't heard any
complaints from the faculty about this ijsue.
"The rnly place where there might be use for
a policy is in cases where there are textlSooks in
competition with each other within a depart-
