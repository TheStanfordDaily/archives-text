Athens — Socialist Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou has rejected the
year-old agreement which had re
turned Greece to NATO's military wing
and asked Parliament to approve his
plan to end Greek participation in the
Western alliance.
In outlining his foreign policy plans
for the first time since his election four
weeks ago as Greece's first Socialist pre
mier, Papandreou also reiterated a
c ampaign pledge to negotiate removal
of U.S. military bases here and said his
government would begin negotiations
to have nuclear weapons of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization removed
from Greece.
He said Greece would hold a referen
dum on whether to remain in the Eu
ropean Economic Community (EEC or
Common Market) and, in a speech to
Parliament that chatted a clear change
of direction for this country in many
areas, dedicated his government to
broadening its relations with the Arab
world.
Papandreou's statements Sunday
largely reiterated pledges he made dur
ing the election campaign. It was un
clear until Sunday ju«.t how closely the
policies of the Socialist government
would follow demands the Socialists
made when thev were in the opposi
tion.
The program laid out by Papandreou
left out none of the sweeping campaign
promises for a major shift in Greek poli
cy, putting primary emphasis on the
boosting of military defense under an
independent foreign policy that in
cludes changed relations with NATO,
the United States and the Common
Market and strengthened ties with Arab
and 1 bird World states.
Papandreou rejected as "unaccep
table" the so-called Rogers Plan, nego

tiated by NATO commander Gen.
Bernard Rogers last year for Greece's
return to participation in N ATO military
operations. Although never actually
carried out by Greece, the plan had
been accepted by Turkey and the pre
vious Greek government. Greece
withdrew from NATO's military wing in
1974 in protest of the Turkish invasion
of Cyprus.
"There is no sense in our belonging
to the military wing of an alliance which
does not guarantee our eastern borders
(with Turkey) against any possible
threat," Papandreou told deputies and
a packed visitors' gallery.
"Moreover, the Rogers agreement
places in doubt the limits of Greece's
operational control in the Aegean,
which we deem unacceptable," he said.
According to the Rogers agreement,
Tur key, which objected to Greek re-en
try on pre-1974 terms, agreed to lift its
implied veto in favor of sorting out the
question of control of Aegean airspace
after Greece's reintegration. The
pre-1974 terms gave Athens full opera
tional control of the airspace.
Athens then changed its mind, how
ever, and held out against a review of
Aegean control. As leader of the Social
ist opposition at the time, Papandreou
criticized the conservative New De
mocracy government for agreeing to
rejoin NMO's military operations on
terms jeopardizing Greek control rights
in the Aegean.
Papandreou's statement appears to
end hopes on the part of Greece's
Western allies that campaign rhetoric
from his Panhellenic Socialist Move
ment (Pasok) would give way to mod
erate policies once the Socialists were
faced with the realities of power.
The Socialist administration's policy
program also said Greece, in a first step
toward establishing a nuclear-free zone

in the Balkans, will move unilaterally to
oust the nuclear weapons currently sta
tioned at the U.S. military bases in
Greece.
The move is jarring to NATO officials
who fear the Greek example will set off
a chain reaction at a time when the
peace movement is strong in Europe
and is spawning campaigns to halt the
planned deployment of medium-range
nuclear missiles in Western Europe.
Papandreou added that his adminis
tration will begin talks with the United
States on U.S. bases in Greece in early
1982 in order to reach an interim agree
ment until thevcan be permanent I ', dis
mantled. One of the Socialists' goals is
ridding Greece of all foreign military in
stallations.
In stressing Athens' intention to
boost ties with the Balkan and Arab
states and Third World, he repeated his
government's support of the right of all
Palestinian refugees to return to their
home.
On the domestic front, Papandreou
outlined a grim economic picture for
IQBI, featuring a halance-of-payments
deficit of $2.3 billion, an inflation rate of
more th.in 25 uercpnt and declining in
vestments and productivity.
Panandreou said his government
wouid combat the situation through a
program of boosting investments, revis
ing bank credit policy, aiding problem
industries and reinforcing the troubled
small- and mid-size businesses sector,
leading up to a five-year economic de
velopment plan starting 1982.
Papandreou indicated, however, that
military spending would remain at
about six percent, twice the European
average.
He said the government will proceed
with the socialization and revamping of
key industries, including some of the
large shipyards.
