Managua, Nicaragua (AP) â€”
After months of increasingly
strident bickering between
Managua and Washington, a
leader of Nicaragua's revolu
tionary regime says his nation
now wants a "stable rela
tionship" with the United
States.
Sergio Ramirez Mercado,
one of two civilians on the
three-man ruling junta and a
moderate by revolutionary
standards, said in a recent in
terview that "hysteria" has
muddied relations between

the two countries.
He acknowledged that
Nicaragua has contributed to
the climate of tension with the
United States. "We are verbal
at times," he said. "But our
only justification is that we do it
in the face of other verbal ag
gressions."
The 39-year-old writer and
former university professor
said his Central American na
tion (foes not want to be seen
as "an enemy" by the United
States.
Secretary of State Alexander

Haig said yesterday that the
"hours are growing rather
short" before the United States
and other nations might act to
reverse what he called a drift
toward totalitarianism.
"It is incumbent on us to
work in political, economic
and security areas to try to pre
vent this drastic outcome,"
Haig said. "We have not given
up on Nicaragua, but the hours
are growing rather short."
But presidential counselor
Edwin Meese, who appeared
on CBS-TV's "Face the Na

tion," said there is no plan to
send U.S. ground forces to
Nicaragua. A naval blockade to
stop the flow of arms, he said,
"could be a possible matter for
further discussion."
Ramirez Mercado said
Nicaragua wants to offer the
United States a "serious and
stable relationship that would
safeguard our sovereignty and
independence.
"We are fighting for true de
moracy. We do not want to re
turn to the past," he insisted.
