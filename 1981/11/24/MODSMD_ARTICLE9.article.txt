Warsaw, Poland — Polish secret police raided
the apartment of dissident intellectual Jacek
Kuron on Sunday, breaking up a meeting which
the government later charged was aimed at es
tablishing an illegal political party.
Several dozen people, including represent
atives of the Warsaw leadership of Solidarity,
wore at the gathering and had their identity pa
pers checked, according to an Interior Ministry
statement.
lanusz Onyszkiewicz, regional spokesman for
Solidarity, the free trade union, confirmed that
"several activists of the union had announced
their participation in the discussion." He added
in a union statement released Sunday night that
those present at the meeting had their briefcases
searched and that some were summoned for
questioning.
Kuron, who was not arrested, said in an in
terview at Solidarity's Warsaw regional head
quarters that the meeting was to discuss the or
ganization of "grass-roots structures" aimed at
promoting Solidarity's program. "It was a meet
ing of people from different parts of the country
who are thinking of launching 'Clubs of Self
governing Poland'," Kuron said, but he insisted
there would be no political party.
Nonetheless, both the Kuron initiative and the
police raid threatened to upset the fragile peace
that had seemed to prevail here between the
Solidarity movement and the authorities since a
domestic summit meeting early this month.
The union and the government are engaged
in a series of negotiations over specific econom

ic and political issues, and less formal talks re
portedly continue involving the authorities, Sol
idarity, the Roman Catholic Church and other
groups. Those talks are designed to come up
with a new political power-sharing formula.
These are particularly sensitive negotiations,
and powerful elements in both the union and
the Polish Communist Party oppose them: radi
cal unionists rejecting compromise and Party
hard-liners opposed to any power-sharing.
Kuron, a former Warsaw University professor
and one of the founding membersof the recent
ly-disbanded Committee for Social Defense, a
dissident organization known in Poland as KOR,
has been an important advisor to Solidarity since
the free trade union movement was founded 15
months ago.
The government statement accused Kuron of
trying to "create a political party with anti-So
cialist orientation."
The government statement said the gather
ing's allegedly illegal goals were "fully con
firmed by the text of the declaration of the
planned organization," a copy of which was
confiscated in the police search.
It also charged that "the plans to establish an
organization with anti-Socialist orientation
strike at the root of the idea of agreement
(among various social and political forces in Po
land) and lead to the creation of conflict situ
ations which threaten that agreement."
The government denied that it was trying to
"suppress some innocent discussion club or lim
it the possibility of expressing different political
views."
