When you just got a "D"
It's only a grade.
With a little luck (and maybe a tutor)
you might even pass the class. In the meantime,
do something right. Raise that sinking feeling with a sandwich
and a cold glass of milk.
Milk's the right answer to any food.
So go ahead and reward yourself.
Good ol' milk never fails.
But of course you know that.
there's nothing like something
with Milk. .
fhis seal is your assurance MKAIS
of <i real dairy food.^jji^^
