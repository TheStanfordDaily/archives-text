John Hart Ely, the Ralph S. Tyler professor of
constitutional law at Harvard, will become the
ninth dean of the Law School here by July 1,1982,
University President Donald Kennedy announced
Monday.
Ely was unanimously endorsed by both a search
committee set up to advise Kennedy and the Law
School faculty. He succeeds Dean Charles Meyers,
who entered private practice with Gibson, Dunn,
and Crutcher in Denver Sept. 1,1981.
"He was our first choice," said Prof. Robert
Rabin, who headed the search committee. Rabin
said it is extremely unusual for a "top flight" law
school to attract someone from another well
known law school.
"It's a real coup," said Rabin. "No comparable
school has appointed an outside dean since Stan
ford appointed Bayless Manning in 1963. It's a
cheerful day for the Law School."
"He's a great catch in the academic world," said
Prof. Barbara Babcock, a former U.S. assistant at
torney general.
One of the leading constitutional scholars of his
generation, Ely has received wide acclaim for his
book, Democracy and Distrust: A Theory of )udi

cial Review. The volume treats the central prob
lems of the of modern constitutional law and the
role of the U.S. Supreme Court.
After receiving his A.B. degree summa cum
laude from Princeton University and his magna
cum laude law degree from Yale, Ely worked as a
law clerk for former Supreme Court Chief Justice
Earl Warren from 1965-66.
In 1968, Ely secured an associate professorship at
Vale. When he received an endowed pro
fessorship at Harvard in 1973, he was one of the
youngest scholars ever to doso. Ely will also be one
of the few persons to receive an endowed dean
ship when he comes here in July,
While at Harvard, Ely served on the law appoint
ments committee and he is credited with a key role
in recruiting several of the five women now in
tenure track positions at Harvard.
Rabin said Ely's strength in recruitment will en
hance the internal relations of the Law School. His
open mind will also help the Law School to adjust
to changing timesand needs, Rabin said.
"It'sva combination of liberal temperament â€”
that is, being receptive to new ideas-and a concern
for excellence, that makes his a winning combina
tion," said Rabin.

Rabin said Ely won the praise of colleagues for
adminstrative expertise when he worked as gener
al counsel for the Department of Transportation
during the Ford Administration. Rabin said he felt
this is a good indication that Ely will be adept at
dealing with people and issues outside the Law
School.
"He's intellectually brilliant and he has a sense of
humor," said Babcock, who graduated from Yale
Law School with Ely in 1953 and has remained
friends with him since. "But the thing that drew us
(the Law School faculty) to him was his personal in
tegrity and righteousness. Those are things that
haven't changed over the years."
Babcock added that Ely is positive about his com
ing west. "People that are educated in the East find
it a big move to come west, but he's open to it,"
Babcock said.
Rabin said the small size of the Law School,
which creates an intimate atmosphere and makes
it possible to effect changes easily, was an impor
tant factor in attracting Ely to the University.
The Law School has a faculty of 37. The student
body of 170, chosen from an applicant pool of
4000, is one of the best in the nation.
