## Joe Rodota Tale of two supply-siders 
### 
Nancy apparently had nothing to
do with it. The order to redecorate
the Cabinet Room came from Presi
dent Ronald Reagan himself, and
consisted of one directive: replace
the portrait of Harry Truman with
one of Calvin Coolidge.
This exercise of executive privilege
was not intended to place Reagan in
the Architectural Digest Hall of
Fame. Instead, the new oil-and-can
vas Coolidge shrine daily reminds the
president and his advisers of three
fundamental precepts: Reaganomics
claims a respectable historical
pedigree; the Republican conserva
tive/supply-side economic policy is
here to stay; and present players are
vying with Democrats for the
limelight in the next generation's his
tory textbooks.
"Coolidge Vogue" is visible
throughout the present adminis
tration. The spirit which Reagan
seeks to revive is that of "Silent Cal's"
1924 message to Congress: In my
opinion the Government can do
more to remedy the economic ills of
the people by a system of rigid econ
omy in public expenditure than can
be accomplished through any other
action.
The new revisionists view Coolidge
and his policies as rip-roaring suc
cesses. "Steeped in the Yankee virtue
of thrift," notes Newsweek, Coolidge
"balanced the budget and cut the na
tional debt in half."
It is often argued that history re
peats itself; thoughtful historians
should find within the past some les
sons for the future. Today's lesson
begins with the fact that Coolidge
was elected to the presidency in 1924
on a supply-side platform.
Warren Harding's 1921 revenue
bill repealed the excess-profits tax
and curtailed the maximum surtax
for the highest income brackets. For
his bid to retain the post he inherited
after Harding's death, Coolidge bor
rowed not only the tax-cut idea, but
the author of the legislation: Har
ding's Secretary of the Treasury An
drew Mellon.
The start of the "Keep Cool with
Coolidge" campaign was coordi
nated with the introduction of
Mellon's second tax reduction pro
posal. The "Mellon Plan" called for
halving the taxes of the wealthy and
reducing by one or two percent the
taxes of the middle class.
As with this year's Kemp-Roth bill,
the 1924 proposal promised general
prosperity by encouraging the

wealthy to take their money out of
tax shelters and put it to use in "pro
ductive" investments. The president
of the Detroit Screw Works wrote of
the Mellon Plan to Coolidge: "I have
the confidence that its adoption will
do more in respect to encouraging
new business enterprises than any
thing that could be effected."
Rep. Martin Davey (D-Ohio) in
turn warned Coolidge: "I will not be
coerced into voting for any plan that
is partial to those of the greatest in
comes and unfair to millions of other
taxpayers." House Democrats and
Progressives defeated the Re
publican bill, raised the inheritance
tax and halved the basic income tax

Calvin Coolidge is as unsuited to the job of
presidential role model as he was to the job of
30th president of the United States. The man

pioneer ignorantly and haphazardly applied
economic policies, with disastrous results.

woo the middle-class voter.
As a November 1924 Chicago Her
ald and Examiner editorial com
mented, "the Democrats had all the
heart and the Republicans had all the
brains." Coolidge soundly defeated
his opponents in what was seen at the
time as a complete vindication of the
Mellon policies.
Coolidge and his "Wizard of the
Treasury" followed to the letter the
Mellon Plan and dramatically re
duced taxes in 1924 and 1926.
Coolidge's 1928 message to Congress
is pure supply-side: with every major
reduction in taxes, "the resulting
stimulation to business has so in
creased taxable income and profits
that a surplus has been produced."
Each year's surplus went in part to
reduce the national debt; the re
mainder defrayed the following
year's tax cut. "Silent Cal" and"the
second greatest Secretary of the
Treasury since Hamilton" thus com
bined the worst objectives of re
duced taxes, balanced budgets and
diminished debts.
When picking a role model, an at
tempt should be made to select one
that was at least moderately suc
cessful. The current "Coolidge Re
vival" overlooks a minor event called
the Great Depression. While H.L.
Mencken implied that Coolidge

merely overlooked the omens of ec
onomic collapse ("Nero fiddled, but
Coolidge only snored"), it is clear
that the Mellon policies to which our
30th president subscribed actually
hastened and magnified the depres
sion of 1929-1939.
According to Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr., "debt reduction and budget bal
ancing might have constituted a use
ful sedative for the nervous econo
my" of the 19205. But the third com
ponent of the Mellon plan — tax cuts
— released millions of dollars into a
saturated domestic investment mar
ket. A speculative boom of un
precedented proportions ensued,
short-term loans increased exponen-

tially, and risky overseas projects re
ceived heavy U.S. investment. When
the crash in 1929 came, America's ov
erextended economy collapsed in a
heap.

century.
Today's lesson seems to indicate
that Reagan might do well to cast
about for another patron saint.

Nancy apparently had nothing to
do with it. The order to redecorate
the Cabinet Room came from Presi
dent Ronald Reagan himself, and
consisted of one directive: replace
the portrait of Harry Truman with
one of Calvin Coolidge.
This exercise of executive privilege
was not intended to place Reagan in
the Architectural Digest Hall of
Fame. Instead, the new oil-and-can
vas Coolidge shrine daily reminds the
president and his advisers of three
fundamental precepts: Reaganomics
claims a respectable historical
pedigree; the Republican conserva
tive/supply-side economic policy is
here to stay; and present players are
vying with Democrats for the
limelight in the next generation's his
tory textbooks.
"Coolidge Vogue" is visible
throughout the present adminis
tration. The spirit which Reagan
seeks to revive is that of "Silent Cal's"
1924 message to Congress: In my
opinion the Government can do
more to remedy the economic ills of
the people by a system of rigid econ
omy in public expenditure than can
be accomplished through any other
action.
The new revisionists view Coolidge
and his policies as rip-roaring suc
cesses. "Steeped in the Yankee virtue
of thrift," notes Newsweek, Coolidge
"balanced the budget and cut the na
tional debt in half."
It is often argued that history re
peats itself; thoughtful historians
should find within the past some les
sons for the future. Today's lesson
begins with the fact that Coolidge
was elected to the presidency in 1924
on a supply-side platform.
Warren Harding's 1921 revenue
bill repealed the excess-profits tax
and curtailed the maximum surtax
for the highest income brackets. For
his bid to retain the post he inherited
after Harding's death, Coolidge bor
rowed not only the tax-cut idea, but
the author of the legislation: Har
ding's Secretary of the Treasury An
drew Mellon.
The start of the "Keep Cool with
Coolidge" campaign was coordi
nated with the introduction of
Mellon's second tax reduction pro
posal. The "Mellon Plan" called for
halving the taxes of the wealthy and
reducing by one or two percent the
taxes of the middle class.
As with this year's Kemp-Roth bill,
the 1924 proposal promised general
prosperity by encouraging the

wealthy to take their money out of
tax shelters and put it to use in "pro
ductive" investments. The president
of the Detroit Screw Works wrote of
the Mellon Plan to Coolidge: "I have
the confidence that its adoption will
do more in respect to encouraging
new business enterprises than any
thing that could be effected."
Rep. Martin Davey (D-Ohio) in
turn warned Coolidge: "I will not be
coerced into voting for any plan that
is partial to those of the greatest in
comes and unfair to millions of other
taxpayers." House Democrats and
Progressives defeated the Re
publican bill, raised the inheritance
tax and halved the basic income tax

Calvin Coolidge is as unsuited to the job of
presidential role model as he was to the job of
30th president of the United States. The man
Ronald Reagan praises for being a supply-side
pioneer ignorantly and haphazardly applied
economic policies, with disastrous results.

rate in an election-eve attempt to
woo the middle-class voter.
As a November 1924 Chicago Her
ald and Examiner editorial com
mented, "the Democrats had all the
heart and the Republicans had all the
brains." Coolidge soundly defeated
his opponents in what was seen at the
time as a complete vindication of the
Mellon policies.
Coolidge and his "Wizard of the
Treasury" followed to the letter the
Mellon Plan and dramatically re
duced taxes in 1924 and 1926.
Coolidge's 1928 message to Congress
is pure supply-side: with every major
reduction in taxes, "the resulting
stimulation to business has so in
creased taxable income and profits
that a surplus has been produced."
Each year's surplus went in part to
reduce the national debt; the re
mainder defrayed the following
year's tax cut. "Silent Cal" and"the
second greatest Secretary of the
Treasury since Hamilton" thus com
bined the worst objectives of re
duced taxes, balanced budgets and
diminished debts.
When picking a role model, an at
tempt should be made to select one
that was at least moderately suc
cessful. The current "Coolidge Re
vival" overlooks a minor event called
the Great Depression. While H.L.
Mencken implied that Coolidge

merely overlooked the omens of ec
onomic collapse ("Nero fiddled, but
Coolidge only snored"), it is clear
that the Mellon policies to which our
30th president subscribed actually
hastened and magnified the depres
sion of 1929-1939.
According to Arthur Schlesinger,
Jr., "debt reduction and budget bal
ancing might have constituted a use
ful sedative for the nervous econo
my" of the 19205. But the third com
ponent of the Mellon plan — tax cuts
— released millions of dollars into a
saturated domestic investment mar
ket. A speculative boom of un
precedented proportions ensued,
short-term loans increased exponen-

tially, and risky overseas projects re
ceived heavy U.S. investment. When
the crash in 1929 came, America's ov
erextended economy collapsed in a
heap.

astrous results.
If our modern-day Coolidge
groupies remain unconvinced, the
narrative need only be continued.

Franklin Roosevelt was elected, end
