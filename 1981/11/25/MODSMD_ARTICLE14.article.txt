## Football needs innovation 
### 
To sports editor Sally Jenkins' review of the Stanford
1981 football season and her prognostications for future
performance at the level of a national powerhouse (Dai
ly, Nov. 23) let me reply with a resounding "Bull!"
The last three victories by wide margins were against
teams with only a handfulofvictoriesamongthem. (Even
those were gained largely against one another.) Kicking
around the lousy Cal Bears or running up the score on an
Oregon State team that everyone outclasses hardly
seems performance to crow about. Stanford itself en
dured these experiences from Washington and Arizona
State, both of which — when they were crushing Stan
ford — held down their scores by inserting back-up
players into the game.
Stanford's overall football record has now been spiral
ing downwards for nearly half a decade. The team has
gone from the level of winning bowl games to being
butchered by the local state college. The current coach,
Paul "Bare" Wiggin, is no Paul "Bear" Bryant — to use
Jenkins' analogy with the Crimson Tide.
No, Wiggin is a proponent of "The Offense of the Six
ties": run to set up the pass. And of the corresponding
"Defense of the Sixties": stop the run, and the pass will
automatically be stopped. Both approaches have failed.
Wiggin has an overall losing record. This from teams that
were preseason picks to be bowl contenders. Stanford's
record and performance have degenerated under his

tutelage.
What can be done about this state of affairs is certainly
a difficult question. As Jenkins suggests, better recruiting
— for a defensive secondary and for depth (especially at
skill positions) — would be helpful. Stanford certainly
needs a quarterback who will be ready to replace Elway
in the 1983 season. But recruiting is likely to prove fruit
less in the absence of innovative coaching, and that we
will not have under Wiggin.
Perhaps Stanford cannot compete with USC and
Washington for frequent Rose Bowl bids. However,
former coach Bill Walsh proved that Stanford can regu
larly compete in secondary bowl games. Stanford is one
of the few academically superior schools at which that
can be said.
Furthermore, a successful football program can pro
vide the funds for many other sports activities and for the
maintenance of recreation facilities on this campus. It's
in the interests of the University that the program
achieve this success. So, a tentative first step in the right
direction will be to ask for Wiggin's resignation and to
seek as his replacement a proponent of a modern pass
ing offense.
In the absence of this positive action, Jenkins' hopes
for improvement are unrealistic.
