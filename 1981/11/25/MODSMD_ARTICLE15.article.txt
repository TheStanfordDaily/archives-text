## 'Playful attack' attitude is misdirected 
### 
Having a police department on the
campus should make the members of
this community feel relatively safe
and protected. This feeling of secur
ity was severely tested by recent
comments reported in the Daily
(Nov. 19).
In the article, "Police find assault
report," which refers to the at
tempted assault of a Stanford hospital
employee, Police Chief Marvin Her
rington was quoted as saying "the
man who accosted her was probably
'just being playful.' " And later he
said, "Not that he should have done
it, but I think he was just being play
ful."
This attitude does nothing to instill
the community's confidence in our
police force. Attitudes such as this
perpetrate the idea that it is accep
table in our society for men to be
"macho" and to periodically reaffirm
their dominance over women.
An attack of any kind is a serious in
cident regardless of the gender of the
attacker or the victim. Would Her
rington also call a mugging playful?

Or, was this particular case labeled as
such because of the gender of the
victim?
We would suggest that anyone
who has similar ideas to those of Her
rington reexamine their views, be
cause it is partly the existence of
these attitudes that allows the per
petration of crimes such as rape.

Time for architecture
The article on the teaching of
architecture at Stanford (Daily, Nov.
13) contained some inaccuracies.
Most serious was the suggestion that
there is littie interest in architecture
here, as shown by the lack of student
participation in the "exchange" pro
gram with Berkeley.
Actually, there are many Stanford
students interested in architecture.
One index of this is the large en

rollments in my courses. Another is
the large number of students who
talk with me every year, who want to
pursue careers in architecture but
are frustrated by the lack of a struc
tured program in the subject here.
Since the "exchange" with
Berkeley is free only to graduate stu
dents, and Stanford has no graduate
students in architecture, it is hardly
surprising that the program goes un
used. It is our undergraduates who
need help.
In fact, it is possible to prepare at
Stanford for graduate work in
architecture (and many of my stu
dents over the years have done so
with great success), but the task was
made much more difficult by the
elimination of the architectural pro
gram that Prof. Robert Mittelstadt
very ably taught in the Mechanical
Engineering Department. The re
institution of such a program, under
the aegis of engineering or art or
whomever, is a minimum require
ment for serving our undergraduates
interested in architecture as a career.

Another misconception that
should not go unanswered is the im
plication of little or no faculty in
terest in the expansion of Stanford's
offerings in architecture. I frequently
am asked by colleagues in various de
partments why Stanford is so barren
in this field. And practically all of the
Art Department faculty have for
years vigorously supported efforts to
improve the teaching of architecture
at the University.
The same is true of the faculty in
volved in the Urban Studies Program,
in which many Stanford students en
roll in their attempt to prepare for
graduate work in architecture.
It is probably time for those of us
who have labored for years to pro
vide some architectural education
here, and for the many students who
are interested in the subject, to be
come more vocal about the needs in
this area.
