## Rape a community problem 
### 
Rape is an incredibly important
thing for men here at Stanford (and
everywhere) to think about and deal
with. Vet, at the same time, that is a
\ ( erv difficult thing for us men to do. I
guess that's because men really don't
understand rape. Since it is men who
commit rapes, we don't really feel
victimized by it. We can sympathize
.. . but it's very difficult to em
phathize.
It's hard for men to understand
women's feelings about rape — feel
ings of fear and frustration and anger.
It's hard for us to know what it's like
to be afraid to go jogging alone or to
have to ask someone to walk with us
to the library or to the Coffee House.
It's hard for us to experience wom
en's sense of anger at this confine
ment and to know what sense of frus
tration and powerlessness which
such confinement creates. As men,
we've been conditioned from birth
to hide from our feelings, to repress
them. It is long overdue that we
started facing up to them.
If we men lea*n'"only one thing
from this most recent crisis, it should
be the realization that rape is a com
munity problem. It is not just a wom
en's problem . . .
* When I talk about the need for
men to understand the problem of
rape and to take their share of re
sponsibility for it, we need to look for
ways in which we, as men, can start to
do that. I read the Daily letter sug
gesting a temporary male curfew (
Daily, Nov. 13) — the idea that men
should not go anywhere on this cam
pus after 6 p.m. without some sort of
escort — an idea which was suc
cessfully tried at Berkeley a few years
ago. When I first read that, I won
dered whether such a proposal
would really help solve the problem. 4
A little later, however, I realized that
it is in many wa'ys a very thought-pro
voking and meaningful idea.
The point of such an exercise —
this requirement that all men be
forced to find an escort after dark —
is not merely a new means'for protec
ting women and not an attempt by
women to confine men out of anger.
Instead, it would help us men to feel
what women must experience every
day. It would help us get i.n touch
with the daily reality of rape,
ality of always having to find a jog
ging partner or of having to find
someone to walk with us to our car at
night. It is a way by which we men
could start to be sensitive to the roots
of women's experience: daily fear
and frustration.
In that context, I think it's a very
good idea, and I would encourage all
men here to try it for a week.
There are several more concrete

things which all men must consider
in helping this community confront
the problem of rape. First, in the
long-term, rape can only be suc
cessfully overcome by our examina
tion and re-evaluation of certain of
our traditional sex role behavior and
attitudes. We men must remember
that the majority of rapes occur be
tween people who knew each other
before. They take place more often
in the bedroom than in the bushes,
and the vast majority of these kind gp
unreported.
Rape is rooted in forms of domi
nance of aggression as well as in
men's sexual conditioning. It is the
ultimate and most horrible man
ifestation of these values. Since we as
men are taught these values and so
often embody them, it is up to us to
play a major role in changing them.

Rape is rooted in forms of dominance of
aggression as well as in men's sexual
conditioning. It is the ultimate and most
horrible manifestation of these valueis. Since
we as men are taught these values and so
often embody them, it is up to us to play a
major role in changing them.

On a daily basis, each of us must
work to become more sensitive and
aware as men — in our relationships,
in our behavior and attitudes, in our
discussions with friends. That is
where the roots of important, sub
stantive change are planted. This
change is the real long-term solution
to rape, if only we have the good
sense to see how such changes bene
fit all of us, including men, and not
feel threatened by them.
In the short term, there are several
very practical, daily things that we as
men can do. First, we men must take
far greater initiative in telling people
when we are going to the library, or
jogging, or to some other place
where it is safer (and more fun) to go
in a group, particularly at night.
Don't force women to ask us to es

cort them. That puts men once again
in the role of the protectorand pater
nalist. We do not need that. It is de
meaning to women, and it is not a fair
burden for them to have to bear. A
lot of women simply won't ask for
help. We men must take the initiative
and make it a comfortable sugges
tion.
When you find yourself in a lonely
place, particularly at night, and
there's a woman alone walking in
front of you, drop back, take a dif
ferent route, and do not frighten her.
We've raised this scenario in count
less dorm discussions about rape,
and 90 percent of all women have
said they just wished the guy would
disappear in those circumstances.
Finally, and perhaps most impor
tant, we must all work to be sup
portive of and sensitive to our wom-

en friends right now. We need to
build trust as a community — a trust
which does not currently exist — to
show women that we care about this
issue and that we see this as a com
munity problem for which we all
share responsibility.
Rape is a horrible but very real
thing, and it's hard to see a positive
side to it. But this situation presents
all of us here at Stanford with a
opportunity to learn frbm each other
and to share and grow together as a
true community. Let's not miss that
opportunity; let's work to solve this
problem.
