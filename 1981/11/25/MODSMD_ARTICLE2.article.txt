# Computer use to increase for agencies, media, legislators

Elected officials, governmnent agencies, lobbyists and
journalists are all moving towards increased com
puterization, which will allow them easier access to vast
areas of information, according to a panel of experts who
spoke yesterday at a forum in Memorial Auditorium.
Panel moderator William Miller, president of SRI, told
ihe small crowd that librarians and bank tellersand some
other service positions could be better filled by a ma
chine than a person.
The panel included seven participants who spoke
about different aspects of the impact of computer tech
nology on legislative affairs, among these were 21st Dis
trict Assemblyman Byron Sher, several professors and
representatives from private industry.
UC Irvine Political Science Prof, james Danzinger said
that increased inUxrmation resultingJrora greater auto
mation could take power away from politicians and be
cause of this, automation may be blocked by politicians.
However, Sher said that automation within the legisla
ture is increasing. As an example of this he explained that
five committee offices will be equipped with video dis
play terminals at the start of the legislature's next session;
eventually all legislator's offices will have video display
terminals installed.
"With automation we'll have the status of a bill at our
fingertips," Sher said.

Within two to three years video display terminals w ill
be installed in all the state legislator's district offices,
which will allow greater access to legislative information
for constituents, said Sher.
"Someone could call the office and receive informa
tion on a particular bill in a few minutes. Now it some
times takes weeks to get that information to a consti
tuent," the assemblyman said.
Other applications for computers in government, ac
cording to Sher, include improving opinion sampling
methods, giving a legislator information on how a partic
ular bill will affect his district and representing complex
problems graphically.
Matt Hogan of California Research, said his firm had in
the last few years begun selling information or data bases
on the legislature to lobbyists, trade unionsand agencies
within the state government.
Sher said that he hoped the state government could
replace private firms such as California Research in sell
ing information on the legislature and that revenues
from these sales could help finance increased auto
mation within the legislature. t
Diana Tillinghast, assistant professor of communica
tions here, said that the media has to adapt to new tech
nologies.
"If the media do not utilize the data base then the
knowlege gap between the private sector and the public
sector will increase," she said.
