# 'Furlough' day snafus irk workers
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — For federal employees
throughout California, and in other states,
Monday was a day of confusion, dark jokes
and occasional flashes of anger as they
tried to figure out whether to remain at
their jobs or go home.
Before the crisis ended with President
Ronald Reagan signing an emergency hill
to resume funding of federal departments,
thousands of "non-essential" government
workers were told they were being
"furloughed" — government talk for laid
off.
But many others did not seem to know
whether they were to stay at work or
whether they would be paid for it if they
did.
In San Francisco, federal workers passed
out handbills calling "all furloughed em
ployees" to a rally outside the Federal
Building there at noon yesterday "to ex

press our displeasure over Reagan's ac
tions."
All federal buildings in California, Ne
vada, Arizona and Hawaii were closed at
noon Monday after the president vetoed
tho first emergency spending resolution.
The buildings were placed on a "weekend
schedule" with skeleton staffs and em
ployees of occupying agencies required to
sign in and out.
It was those closures that apparently led
to much of the confusion among employ
ees of those agencies as to whether they
were to continue working.
"You would have thought they would
have had a contingency plan drawn up
years ago," complained one Social Secur
ity Administration employee in Los Angel
es, "telling us who was essential and who
wasn't."

In San Francisco, however, SSA spokes
man Bob Fouts said that agency was keep
ing open all its field offices that served the
public and that staffs were told early in the
day that they should stay at work.
He said some confusion may have arisen
in those SSA offices that are in federal of
fice buildings where the General Services
Administration ordered a shutdown of all
but skeleton maintenance operations.
On Monday, the Veterans Adminis
tration here was sending home all but hos
pital employees and others "responsible
for direct medical care, safety of human
life" and protection of property," in the
words of spokesman Frank Terry.
Some of the"furloughed" workers were
told to leave at noon. Some were told to
leave at 2 p.m. and others were told to re
main until the end of the day.
