## Banks upset by deregulation 
### 
New York — A victory for the public, said
Llewellyn Jenkins, representing commercial
bankers. "Arrogant and irresponsible," said Wil
liam O'Connell, speaking for savings and loan
associations.
Despite their differences, the two gentlemen
say they are thinking of your interests, which of
course is the way one builds support for his
cause. But in this instance the rhetoric really
does involve you.
A hit of background: The comments followed
a decision to eliminate interest rate ceilings on
individual retirement savings accounts opened
after Nov. 30. Banks had sought a free market;
S&Ls wanted limitations.
The S&Ls are fuming. They say the Depository
Institutions Deregulatory Committee is biased
toward banks, that it ignored the mortgage
needs of homebuyers, that the decision chops
another leg from under the S&Ls, already in
trouble because of high interest rates and bank
competition.
Thrifts have a particular interest in home
mortgage loans, such loans having made up the
bulk of their business in years gone by.
Because the nation had a commitment to
housing, and because thrifts were chartered to
lend to homebuyers, regulators limited the in
terest thev paid on small savings accounts. In
turn, this allowed them to make home mortgage

loans at correspondingly low interest rates.
Deregulation has been removing those pro
tections. Now the S&Ls see themselves being
pitched into an unfair battle for savings with the
commercial banks, which generally are far big
ger and more powerful.
Leonard Shane, vice chairman of the U.S.
League and president of Mercury Savings & Loan
Association, said "During the past four or five
years this country has not assumed its commit
ment to housing. We have made the mistake of
thinking that this was so, despite the facts of the
situation.
"There is no way we can have housing and a
level economic playing field, that is, total de
regulation in the credit markets. We didn't get to
where we are in housing by competing with
steels, cosmetics and the U.S. government. We
had do facto credit regulation."
"They (deregulators) sincerely believe it is
more important to deregulate for the sake of de
regulation than it is to retain any form of regu
lation to obtain national goals.
"I'm suggesting that housing is a unique issue,
not just another credit.use. They miss under
standing the social issues, the impact on life
styles, the uniqueness of it.... Every other user of
credit can pass the cost along as inflation or high
prices or taxes or deficits. The homebuyer can
not."
