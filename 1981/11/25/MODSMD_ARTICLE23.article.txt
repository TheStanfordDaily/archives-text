## Harriers take 3rd at NCAAs 
### Dick Hodge 
The Cardinal women's cross
country team ran to a third
place finish at the NCAA Na
tional Championships in
Witchita, Kan. Monday, finish
ing with the best season for
Stanford in history."
The Cardinal, ranked N0.2
nationally going into the race
by Harrier magazine, took the
third spot with 105 points, plac
ing behind pre-race favorite
University of Virginia (36
points) and the University of
Oregon (83 points). Stanford
finished ahead of fourth place
Michigan State University (122
points) and fifth place North
Carolina State University (123
points) in a field of the nation's
best women collegiate
runners. San Diego State,
which tied Stanford in the
NCAA Region 8 meet, fell to
seventh place with 169 points.
Despite the team's excellent
showing, Stanford head coach
Brooks Johnson said that his
runners didn't compete up to
par.
"It wasn't our best per
formance of the season," John
son said. "Compared to what
we can do, we didn't run that
well.
"All the conditions were fa
vorable. We were just trying
overly hard to compete well.

The same team a year from now
would have won the race. Our
saving grace is that we're so
good that we can have a medi
ocre performance and still be
one of the best teams in the
country."
Freshman star Ceci Hopp, as
has been her custom this sea
son, was the first Cardinal fin
isher. Taking 10th place with a
16:46 over the 5000-meter
course, she earned All-Ameri
ca honors. Following her to the
tape for Stanford were
sophomore Patti Sue Plumer
(23rd in 17:06.5), junior Kim
Schnurpfeil (27th in 17:08.4),
freshman Sloan Burton (29th
with 17:11.5), freshman Ann
Locke (45th with 17:27.9),
freshman Michelle Mason
(47th with 17:29.8), and
sophomore Ellen Lyons (55th
with 17:49.6).
Betty Jo Springs of North
Carolina State took the individ
ual crown in 16:19 finishing
ahead of Leann Warren of Ore
gon who placed second with
16:25.3 (Ironically, Stanford's
Hopp beat Warren in the Re
gion 8s). Aileen O'Conner of
Virginia took third (16:27.7),
Kelly Cathey of Oklahoma was
fourth (16:27.9) edging Lesley
Welsh of Virginia in fifth who
also clocked 16:27.9.
Johnson noted that, unlike

the youthful Stanford squad,
Virginia had run previously in
big, national races. He didn't
say, however, that inex
perience hurt his team's per
formance.
"I don't believe the rationale
about age," he said. "There's a
line at the beginning and a line
at the end and 5000 meters in
between where we didn't com
pete that well. Besides, only
two of the top 30 finishers were
seniors. The athletes who were
recruited four years ago can't
cut the mustard now. Women's
cross country is in an exciting
state of flux."
Men's cross country is cer
tainly in no state of flux, as wit
nessed by the performance in
Wichita of the University of
Texas at El Paso. UTEP won the
NCAA men'scrosscountrytitle
for the fourth consecutive year
and did so convincingly by
sweeping the top three spots.
Kenyan Matthew
Motshwarateu won the 10,000-
meter race in 28:45.6, followed
by UTEP teammates Michael
Musyoki (28:46.4) and Gabriel
Kanan (29:19.3). Mark Scrutton
of Colorado took fourth in
29:22.1 and Graeme Fell
rounded out the top-five with
29:30.4.
Following El Paso, which had
17 points in the teamstandings,

wore: Providence College (109
points), the University of Ar
kansas (175 points), the Univer
sity of Wisconsin (179 points)
and Pacific-10 Cbnference
Champion, UCLA (187 points).
Though disappointed at
missing a change at the na
tional title, Johnson was proud
of the progress his team has
made.
"I'd say we're about a year
ahead of schedule." the coach
said. "The season as a whole
was interesting and exciting
and there are a couple of very
positive things we can take
away from this race. First, the
kids know they can compete at
the national level, and second,
they know they don't have to
have a great day to win — they
can do it with a normal per
formance."
Johnson gave credit for this
year's success to assistant coach
Laurel Treon, who was respon
sible for recruiting the women
on the team (which was no
small accomplishment con
sidering Lyons and Hopp were
the top high school runners in
the nation their senior years).
Johnson also credited team
captain Kim Schnurpfeil,
whom he described as the per
son "who gives momentum to
this team."

ual crown in 16:19 finishing
ahead of Leann Warren of Ore
gon who placed second with
16:25.3 (Ironically, Stanford's
Hopp beat Warren in the Re

Virginia took third (16:27.7),
Kelly Cathey of Oklahoma was
fourth (16:27.9) edging Lesley
Welsh of Virginia in fifth who
also clocked 16:27.9.
Johnson noted that, unlike

the youthful Stanford squad,
Virginia had run previously in
big, national races. He didn't
say, however, that inex
perience hurt his team's per
formance.
"I don't believe the rationale
about age," he said. "There's a
line at the beginning and a line
at the end and 5000 meters in
between where we didn't com
pete that well. Besides, only
two of the top 30 finishers were
seniors. The athletes who were
recruited four years ago can't
cut the mustard now. Women's
cross country is in an exciting
state of flux."
Men's cross country is cer
tainly in no state of flux, as wit
nessed by the performance in
Wichita of the University of
Texas at El Paso. UTEP won the
NCAA men'scrosscountrytitle
for the fourth consecutive year
and did so convincingly by
sweeping the top three spots.
Kenyan Matthew
Motshwarateu won the 10,000-
meter race in 28:45.6, followed
by UTEP teammates Michael
Musyoki (28:46.4) and Gabriel
Kanan (29:19.3). Mark Scrutton
of Colorado took fourth in
29:22.1 and Graeme Fell
rounded out the top-five with
29:30.4.
Following El Paso, which had
17 points in the teamstandings,

wore: Providence College (109
points), the University of Ar
kansas (175 points), the Univer
sity of Wisconsin (179 points)
and Pacific-10 Cbnference
Champion, UCLA (187 points).
Though disappointed at
missing a change at the na
tional title, Johnson was proud
of the progress his team has
made.
"I'd say we're about a year
ahead of schedule." the coach
said. "The season as a whole
was interesting and exciting
and there are a couple of very
positive things we can take
away from this race. First, the
kids know they can compete at
the national level, and second,
they know they don't have to
have a great day to win — they
can do it with a normal per
formance."
Johnson gave credit for this
year's success to assistant coach
Laurel Treon, who was respon
sible for recruiting the women
on the team (which was no
small accomplishment con
sidering Lyons and Hopp were
the top high school runners in
the nation their senior years).
Johnson also credited team
captain Kim Schnurpfeil,
whom he described as the per
son "who gives momentum to
this team."

SHE'S A FRESHMAN SENSATION — Cardinal women's cross country first-year star Ceci

by Harrier magazine, took the
third spot with 105 points, plac

we can do, we didn't run that
well.
"All the conditions were fa
vorable. We were just trying
overly hard to compete well.

saving grace is that we're so
good that we can have a medi

one of the best teams in the
country."
Freshman star Ceci Hopp, as
