# Cardinal poloists sprint for title
## 
### Chris Addington 
An NCAA tournament brings to mind
cheering crowds, excellent sportsmanship
and the gleam of victory in every com
petitor's expression. Since 1969 all these
characteristics have been present at the
NCAA National Water Polo Cham
pionships.
Eight teams will compete this year at the
Belmont Plaza Natatorium in Long Beach.
The top eight water polo powers in the
country will vie for the coveted title of
NCAA National Champion.
The field is represented by Long Beach
State, UC-lrvine, UC-Berkeley, UCLA,
UCLA, UC-Santa Barbara, Brown Univer
sity, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and of
course, the men in Cardinal Red.
The Cardinal is definitely a newcomer at
to Nationals. In the early years of the tour
ney UCLA dominated the scene, winning

three championships in four years. Then
came the glory years of the California
Golden Bears, who swept to three straight
victories in 1973-'74-'75.
And then, in 1976, a bunch of guys in red
caps stole the show. They have been the
talk of the water polo circuit ever since.
Stanford has won the NCAA's three
times in the last five years, and in the sea
sons it didn't win, it missed going to the
finals by only one goal.
Stanford's squad is ranked No.l once
again going into this weekend's confronta
tions. The Cardinal is 28-0 for the year and
6-0 in the Pacific-10 conference. It is cur
rently running up the longest winning
streak in the history of collegiate water
polo.
And, the Cardinal has experience. Ev
eryone of the starting seven has seen ac
tion at the Nationals before. For some of

them, it will be their fourth year of post
season play. In 1978 seniors jody Campbell
and Chris Kelsey were freshman starters
for the Farm, and senior Alan Mouchawar
was a frosh who came off the bench to
score three goals in the final game.
When asked about his feelings going
into the tournament, Stanford head coach
Dante Dettamanti replied, "The semi-final
game is always the toughest. Sometimes,
even though it's the Nationals, the team
will be looking ahead to the next game."
Essentially, Stanford will have two tough
games and one easy one in the single
elimination tourney. The Cardinal will go
against Brown University at 9 a.m. Saturday
morning, a team they beat 25-6 early in the
year. If they win that contest, they play the
winner of the Santa Barbara-Irvine match
up. It should be noted that these are the
only two teams who have ever been ahead
of Stanford during a game all year long.
