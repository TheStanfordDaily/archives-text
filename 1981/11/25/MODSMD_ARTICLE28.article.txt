# Claims breach of contract
## Fred Dryer sues Rams 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Fred Dryer says he loves
the Los Angeles Rams as a team, but he has filed a
$5 million Superior Court lawsuit against the Na
tional Football League club's management,
which he blames for his downfall.
"They ended my career," the defensive end
said. "I had a no-cut contract and they cut me.
They don't care what a contract reads."
Dryer isn't a broke ex-player. He still iscollect
ing on the final year of his written contract call
ing for $220,000 per year.
He says he was promised extra benefits
amounting to $50,000 annually, which had been
promised him along with an extra two years un
der an oral agreement. Then, there was one cut
and its embarrassment, plus a second cut and
more embarrassment on being left hanging
without knowing his future.
"When they did that to me, it ripped away
what I've been doing for 20 years," Dryer said. "I
played in high school, college and in the pros."
Most of the money is asked for personal dis
tress to Dryer plus breach of contract, wrongful
termination, intentional influence of emotional

distress, fraud and deceit.
Anti-trust comes in and so does civil con
spiracy, which could let Dryer bring in the NFL
and others as defendants in his action.
The former defensive end says he regrets the
fall of the Rams this year to their 5-7 record since
"I know how the players feel because I spent
three years with the New York Giants when they
weren't doing well.
"The Rams have a lot of great players, but you
must have harmony with the people you work
for and play for."
Dryer doesn't have respect for owner Georgia
Rosenbloorn Frontiere as shown in his suit, and
he doesn't think there is communication be
tween the owner, General Manager Don
Klosterman and Coach Ray Malavasi.
Dryer played 13 seasons in the NFL, tfye last 10
with the Rams, but was told during the summer
he would be put on waivers. He brought pp.the
subject of his no-cut contract and was kept
three games into the regular season, when ne
was cut for good. •'
