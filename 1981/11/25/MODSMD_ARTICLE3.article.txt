The impact of the new con
servatism on women's socio-eco
nomic and political status, child care
and a market-replacement approach
â€¢to the economic evaluation of un
paid work in the household are some
of the topics under study this year by
seven visiting scholars at the Center
for Research on Women (CROW).
CROW selects approximately sev
en people each year to take part in
their Visiting Scholars program.
While they are granted full library
privileges and office space during
their stay, the scholars are not of
fered a stipend. They are appointed
for one month to a year, depending

on the nature of their research and
their own schedules.
Mary Katzenstein (department of
government at Cornell University)
and Skold (women's studies
program San Diego State), are pres
ently working on their own research
as well as working on a special
project, sponsored by the Ford Foun
daton, which examines feminist in
terests and children's interests, ac
cording to Frances Bertetta, the ad
ministrative assistant to the program.
Alison Prentice from the Ontario
Institute for Studies Education in
Canada was the third'visiting scholar
at CROW for a short time in October.
While here, she studied the history of
women's work and education for

work in Canada and the sexual
division of labor in the field of
teaching in Quebec and Ontario.
In response to a question about the
specific obligations of the scholars,
Bartetta said, "They go ahead and do
their own things. They get very in
volved and they don't have to report
back to me or anyone else." She said
they participate in a number of ac
tivities, including presenting papers
?t seminars, giving lectures, and
directing student seminars.
The scholars are selected on the
basis of "their academic credentials,
publications, teaching experience
and/or relevant activities, and their
research objectives," according to a
