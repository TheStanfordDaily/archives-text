Gone with the Wind*****
Festival Palo Alto
This is studio production mak
ing at its height. The "maverick"
producer David O. Selznick,
whose fixation this was, suc
ceeded in putting a polish on this
film that's sometimes suffocating
but more often great fun. It's a
moviQto gawk at — like resplen
dent jewelry, it doesn't really,
matter whether its shine is real or
paste. Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett
O'Hara, Clark Gable plays Rhett
Butler, Leslie Howard play%
Ashley ,yvilkes, Olivia dp
M.ivilland plays Melanie, Hattie
M< Daniel pljys Mammy, Butter-* 1 '
fly McQue,en plays Prissy, and
tlvv're all great Selznick ran
through four (or was it five?) di
rectors in search of perfection;
his final choice was Victor Flem
ing.
Starts tomorrow and plays
through next Wednesday.

Singin' in the Rain
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Singin' in the Rain is the
Hamlet of musicals. It's a virtually
perfect movie. The script, by Bet-.,
ty Comden and Adolph Green, is
funnv and tigP#t — it's also his
torically accurate in its telling of
the troubles that beset the mov
ies when they learned to talk The
music, by Arthur Freed and Nacio
Herb Brown, is wonderful — the
songs include "You'are My Lucky
Star," "Broadway Rhythm,"
"Make 'Em Laugh/' "Moses Sup
poses" (a great nonsense lyric
which starts supposes
his toeses are roses but Moses
supposes erroneously"), and, of
course, the title tune. And the
performers a\e. splendid. Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor
dance and sing a lot; Debbie Rey
nold sings quite a bit and dances a
little; Cyd Charisse just dances;
and Jean Hagen plays Lena La
mont, a screen star who can't
sing, can't dance, and can't act.
Lena Lamont's, awful, and
Hagen's marvelous.
Ends tonight. 'Double-billed
"Liii," which stars Leslie Caron.

Ninotchka
Fox, Redwood City
The ad line for Greta Garbo's
first sound film, Anna Christie.
was "Garbo Talks!" The ad line
for Ninotchka, her first comedy,
was "Garbo. Laughs!" For once,
the publicity department knew
what it was talking about — the
[addition of laughter Garbo's
screen persona was nearly as
great a revelation* as the addition
of sound. Her beauty ns still as
great, and thp presence oif a smile
warms her. Ernst Lubitsch
directed this great comedy,
which finds Russian agent
Ninotchka seduced by the
charms of the city of Paris and by
the things it offers; champagne,
dancing, and romance. It's a fairy
tale where good spirits and frivol
ity conquer a! 4.
Tonight only, witH another
Garbo film, Mata Hari.

My Fair Lady ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
George Cukor directed this
rather stodgy film adaptation of
the Lerner and Loewe musical.

Though it's not a great movie, the
play and the music are so appeal
ing that they more than outweigh
any weaknesses in direction and
pacing. As nearly everyone
knows, My Fair Lady is based on
the Shaw play, "Pygmalian" {or,
more accurately, it is based on
the screenplay Shaw worked up
for the 1938 movie version). Rex
Harrison, recreating his stage
role, plays linguistics expert Hen
ry Higgins; Audrey Hepburn
plays the dialectically under
priveleged Eliza Doolittle. Lerner
,rnd Loewe supplied the tunes: "I
Could Have Danced All Night,"
"On the Street Where You Live,"
"I've Grown Accustomed to Her
Face," and many others.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with The King and I.

Arthur ★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, playsa wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman **★
Guild, Menlo Park ,
Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century, notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy'lrons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote'
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Raggedy Man **
Old Mill, Mountain View
The firswfeature by Jack Fisk,
who served as art director on
Badlands and Days of Heaven;
though he shows an impressive
grasp of film technique, it's an art
director's movie: individual shots
matter more than whole se
quences.'William Witliff's script
suggests traces of southern
Gothic sensibility, but Fisk de
fangs the menace and makes the
film homey and benign. Eric Rob
erts, as the sailor who stumbles
into her life, acts Sissy Spacek off
the screen.

Madame Rosa ***
New Varsity, Palo Alttf
Simone* Signore' '*9|ars as
Madame Rosa, an a£ing jewish
prostitute who adpjf>ts an Arab
boy. The film is cruddy looking,
with m ( urky images,and avN»Wvard
cuts, and sometimes (at the end,
for example) it's almost un
beiieveably wrong.But Signoret
nearly makes up for it all; the ac
tress' dignity carries the film, and
redeems it, The movie moves
along in fits and starts — the starts
outweigh the fits, by a hair.
In French! with subtitles.
Double-billed with I Sent a Letter
to lily Love.next Tuesday and
Wednesday."

Breaker Morant ★**
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Harry "Breaker" Morant is a
lieutenant in the British forces in
South Africa during the Boer
War. He and two other Australian
soldiers are court martialled for
killing a German priest; they are
sacrificial lambs, server) up to ap
pease the German government
and world opinion. This account
of their trial, and the events
which led up to it, is an extremely
"well-made" movie, stuffed ftill
of pretty scenery and historical
significance; while it never quite
catches fire, it stays well above
the boredom threshold.
— Mike Hale

True Confessions ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
John Gregory-Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that'came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, (he movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing.and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.

Escape from New York***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The year is 1997; Manhattan Is
land has been wailed off to form a
maximum security prison. Once a
person is sent in, there's no way
out — those who don't like the
idea of living out their lives in the
prison may opt for execution and
immmediate cremation on the
premises. Inside, the island has
turned into a nightmare world,
inhabited above and below by
creatures out of bad dreams.
From the time the title credits
fade to the roll of the end credits,
Escape from New York offers vir
tually unrelenting excitement.
Director John Carpenter (who
directed Halloween, the first and
far and away the best of the cur
rent honor movie cycle) takes his
lightweight plot and fills it to the
bursting point with striking im
ages and setpieces of suspense.
Plays tonight with Arthur Hill's
The Warriors.

Gallipoii **' a
Fine Arts, Palo Alto >
Forthe first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Gunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
arid then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoii scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell floyd,
the pbotgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.
— S.V.
For Your Eyes Only **
Fox, Redwood City
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, of course, that it's not
sadistic. Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: the producers.plan to re-

place him with a younger model
soon). He perks up momentarily
— as does the movie itself — for a
terrific, cliche-reversing car
chase where Bond is fprced to ex
change his Lotus for a Citroen. If
the moviemakers had been as
playful with the Bond formula
through the rest of the film, For
Your fyes Only might have
passed for entertainment instead
of an exercise in cinematic stasis.
Plays Saturday with Where
Eagles Dare.

The King ai?d I *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This adaptation of the Oscar
and Hammerstein musical
doesn't live up to its reputation:
it's big (literally: someone
thought the garish set design,
merited being filmed in
CinemaScope), empty and
heartless. Deborah Kerr, who
mouths Marni Nixon's singing,
stars as the British school teacher
employed by the king of Siam.
Yul Brynner, who can't sing
either — evidently he couldn't"
get Ms. Nixon to dub him — is the'
king, and he's all bellows and
shiny baldness. Some, but by no
means all, of (he songsare pretty,
and there's, a Siamese version of
I Incle Tom's Cabin that's charm
ing until they present the moral
of the story ("slavery is bad") aqd
then it's merely dumb.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with My Fair Lady.

Prince of" the City *
Palo Alto Square
In short, deliberate takes, the
cast performs as though they'd
spent days'" In an overheated
steam room — we don't get any
rest from'their bug-eyed, over
heated actorishness. Every scene
begins at its climax, so that we
never understand what drove
these people to such extreme
states of hysteria. Sidney Lumet,
who directed and co-wrote the
script (with J-ay Prejson Allen),
seems to think he has something
so important to say in this movie
about police corruption that they
don't have to bother structuring
it or modulatfng the tone or es
tablishing motivation for the
characters — but it's almost im
possible to figure out what he is
saying. Treat Williams stars, but
the only good, performance is
given by Jerfy ©rbach.
-S.V.
Moonraker*
Fox, Redwood City
Formula James Bond — this
movie looks like it was made from
a recipe instead of from a script.
Take one unit James Bond (in this
case, Roger Moore, who serves as
a devalued Sean Connery for
these inflationary times), one ma
jor villain, one femme fatale (Lois
Chiles, who's great whenever
she's not required to deliver a
line) and a gimmicky plot and
you, too, can make your own
Bond movie. Moonraker has'a
great pre-credit sequence that
takes place in mid-air. After that,
the movie is earth-bound for two
solid hours — even the patented
in-the-sack final scene seems to
■be affected by post-coital depres
sion.
Plays Friday and Saturday with
Thunderhall.
