Only minor price increases
Washington — Consumer prices rose at an
annual rate of only 4.4 percent last month, the
lowest increase for two and a half years, the La
•bor Department reported yesterday.
The Consumer Price Index roseo.4 percent in
October, with the improvement primarily the
result of a steep drop in housing prices and a
decline in mortgage interest rates. The October
flndex was 279.9.
The price report came as interest rates con
tinued to fail. Chase Manhattan Bank dropped
its key prime lending rate to a 12-month low of
15*4 percent, and other major banks moved
down to 16 percent from 16 1/ i percent. Short
term interest rates now have been falling swiftly
for several weeks, and market analysts predict
that the prime rate will go lower this year.
For most of the summer the prime stayed at
20.5 percent, close to the record peak of 21.5
percent reached in December 1980. However,
short-term rates now have come down substan
tially, with the federal funds rate that banks
charge each other for overnight loans down to
as low as 12 percent yesterday. The bond market
also has started to revive.
The day's economic news triggered a rally on
the stock markets with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average closing up 18.45 points.
However, the good news on inflation and in
terest rates comes partly at the cost of a deep
ening recession. The sustained period of record
high interest rates this summer plunged the
economy into recession. And as the recession
has deepened in recent weeks, private sector
credit demand has fallen off and brought in
terest rates down again.
Money planners face deadline
Washington — White House officials and
congressional Republican leaders yesterday
mapped out a strategy aimed at getting them
past their next government funding deadline
without closing the government in the process.
"We need to get a package that's acceptable
to the administration' and can get passed
through Congress," said Senate Majority Lead
er Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) after an hour-long
meeting that included White House Chief of
Staff James Baker, Office of Management and
budget Director David Stockman and House
Minority Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.).
As they met, most of Congress had already
fled town, exhausted after a grueling weekend
stalemate over government funding that re
sulted in a presidential veto and day-long shut
down of most of the bureaucracy. The impasse
was ended late Monday when Congress, bow
ing to President Ronald, approved emergency
funding until Dec. 15.
Pressure to prosecute Allen
Washington — A group of 18 Democratic
senators charged yesterday that Attorney Gen
eral William French Smith is violating the law by
not appointing a special prosecutor to in
vestigate national security adviser Richard Al
len's receipt of $1000 intended for Nancy Rea
gan.
In a letter circulated by Sen. Thomas Eagleton

(D-Mo.) the senators criticized Smith's recent
statement that the Justice Department would
conduct an "extensive investigation" of the
matter. That "represents a clear and flagrant vi
olation" of the law, they said, because the de
partment's authority is limited to a very pre
liminary investigation that "has gone too far al
ready."
A Justice spokesman declined comment on
the letter.
Haig wants 'dialogue'on arms
Mexico City — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said yesterday he saw hope for "a new and
constructive dialogue" with the Soviet Union
on nuclear arms reduction.
Haig, addressing U.S. Embassy employees
during his visit to Mexico, said Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's reply to a missile reduction
offer by President Ronald Reagan indicated
"our message is going through."
Brezhnev on Monday rejected Reagan's pro
posal for dismantling European-range nuclear
missiles but offered to reduce the number of
Soviet missiles as a "gesture of good will."
"Recent discussions I had in New York with
(Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei) Gromyko also
offer some hope that a new and constructive
dialogue is in the offing," Haig said.
That meeting at the United Nations in Sep
tember opened the way for U.S.-Soviet arms
talks scheduled to start next Monday in Geneva.
Schmidt critiques USSR savvy
Bonn, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt said yesterday that three days of talks
with President Leonid Brezhnev had convinced
him that the Kremlin leadership still fails to un
derstand the Reagan administration's position
on arms negotiations.
Schmidt told members of his Social Demo
cratic Party that he had spent "a significant
part" of his talks with Brezhnev trying to con
vince him of American goodwill on the ques
tion of negotiating a reduction of nuclear arms
in Europe.
"It is more than clear that the Soviet leader
ship still cannot properly evaluate the inten
tions of the American leadership and its lead
ers," Schmidt said.
"We have, I repeat, tried for our part to clear
away serious Soviet doubts about the credibility
of the American position and of the readiness
for negotiations of the American government."
Brezhnev on Monday rejected Reagan's pro
posal for dismantling European-range nuclear
missiles but offered to reduce the number of
Soviet missiles as a "gesture of good will."
Arabs ponder problems
Fez, Morocco — The historically quarrelsome
\rab League heads of state began gathering
here yesterdav for a summit meeting to debate
their differences over Arab problems, particu
larly Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Fahd's con
troversial peace plan for the Middle East.
An endorsement of the Fahd plan by the 21
active Arab League members during the meet
ing that begins today, appears unlikely given

the active opposition of Libya, leader,
Col. Moammar Khadafy, has announced that he
would not attend and indications of disapproval
from the Palestine Liberation Organization and
several other members.
The Arab League, which once was head
quartered in Cairo but now has moved to Tunis,
comprised 21 nations plus the PLO until Egypt's
expulsion following the signing of the Egypt-Is
rael peace treaty in March of 1979. Libya is urg
ing that Sudan also be expelled because of its
close ties with Egvpt but the move, proposed
during a preparatory session of foreign min
isters here this week, is expected to fail.
MiGs sent to Nicaragua
Washington — The Soviet Union recently
sent Cuba 17 improved MiG-21 jet fighters,
which may foreshadow transfer of some older
MiGs from Cuba to Nicaragua, U.S. intelligence
sources said yesterday.
The new MiG-21L fighters, mftst advanced of
that type exported by Russia, are described as
equiped with more powerful engines than
older versions which the Soviets have been sup
plying to Cuba for years.
The sources, who asked to remain anony
mous, said the fecent delivery of MiG-21L
planes by sea was the second such shipment this
vear in a continuing buildup and mod
ernization of Cuba's armed forces, already
rated the strongest in Latin America.
U.S. intelligence analysts said they believe it
likely the new MiGs will replace earlier types of
MiGs for eventualtransfer to Nicaragua,
wwhich now has a tiny air force with fewer than
a dozen fighters converted from U.S.-built
training planes.
There have been persistent U.S. intelligence
reports that Nicaraguan pilotsare beingtrained
in Eastern Europe to fly MiGs.
Senior Reagan administration officials have
expressed deepening concern about a reported
major strengthening of leftist-ruled Nicaragua's
armed forces with arms and equipment from
communist countries allegedly channeled
through Cuba.
Stock prices soar
New York — Stock prices soared today as the
government reported a slowing of inflation and
interest rates fell again.
Trading was active. Before the opening, the
Labor Department reported that the consumer
price index rose 0.4 percent in October.
The figure was down from 1.2 percent the
month before, and came in well below most an
alyst's expectations.
Another plus for the market was provided by
Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, which
lowered its prime rate from 16'/2 to 15 S A per
cent. Many other banks cut their base rates for
large loans from 16V2 to 16 percent.
