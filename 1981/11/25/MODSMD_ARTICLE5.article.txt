# Cesar Chavez denies media report of any UFW membership decline
## 
### Katie Smith 
Contrary to recent reports, mem
bership in the United States Farm
workers of America is not declining,
according to union president Cesar
Chavez.
Rather, he said in an interview fol
lowing his speech here Monday eve
ning, union growth is at its peak with
105,000 members.
Refuting reports of division be
tween union members, Chavez
called an article on the subject which
appeared in the Los Angeles Times
earlier this fall "inaccurate" and said
its author, Herb Bernstein, was
"lying." The article said UFWA's sup
port was declining and its member
ship was down to 30,000 people.
"We're going to sue him (Berns
tein). He knew what the score was,"
said Chavez. Chavez said Bernstein
discounted about 75,000 union
workes due to their "migrant" status,
but emphasized that the union con
sidered anyone to be a member who
signed on with a grower under
UFWA contract and paid union dues.
Chavez said he would charge

Bernstein with "malicious intent." "I
don't want money," he said. "I want
to go to court and I want to disprove
the things that he said. I never turn
the press away, I only ask that they be
professional."
Chavez said the only time union
membership had dropped seriously
was in 1963 when the Growers and
Teamsters combined their influence
against the union. Between April and
August of that year the union
dropped from 67,000 to 4000 mem
bers, during which time farmworkers
suffered 20,000 arrests and two
murders, according to Chavez.
The Teamsters peace pact with the
UFWA expires this March, but
Chavez said he didn't know "right
now" how the union would be nego
tiating for a new pact.
As for recent endeavors, Chavez
said he has been "negotiating a lot
. . . doing a lot of planning," and
"trying to modernize the adminis
tration of the union." His most recent
contract negotiations have been with
companies in Salinas representing
lettuce, mushroom and wine grape

growers.
The UFWA is also presently striking
in Ventura and boycotting Cook and
Castle industries (Dole) in protest of
unacceptable contract conditions,
he said. Among their demands, the
UFWA wants a one-year rather than a
three-year contract, more medical
benefits and some wage, benefits.
Chavez's major criticism of growers
was the continued failure of many of
them to accept collective bargaining
in good faith.
Chavez commented on the success
of the'UFWA's lettuce strike and Chi
quita boycott in 1979. Workers struck
for nine months, he said, finally suc
ceeding in getting contracts signed
by about one half of the companies
struck.
These contracts, which expire in
September 1982, provide for a full
medical plan, and for worker wages
of $5 to $6 per hour. Southern Cali
fornia growers who did not sign "in
good faith" originally are now going
through Supreme Court litigations
and losing, said Chavez.
The modernization of adminis
tration which Chavez referred to in
clude using new management sys
tems and computers to keep track of
employee records, membership lists
and medical plans. In addition, the
union has an elaborate communica
tion and computer system to keep in
touch with its field offices and service
centers.
Chavez said the union does not
check the documentation of its
workers and said many "un
documented" workers belonged to
the UFWA. He finds offensive the
term "illegal alien" because workers
coming across the border from Mexi
co "can't believe they are doing any
thing illegal, when all they want todo
is work," he said.
Because of the number of these
workers in the union, and problems
with deportation, UFWA has ar
ranged for medical care both in the
United States and in the workers'
native countries. Besides receiving
treatment in the United States, work
ers receive care in the Phillipines, El
Salvador Yemen, and Mexico.
Chavez said the foreign programs
are set up through "medical people"
and other unions in the host country,
and that the UFWA tightly controls
the action to ensure themselves
against being "robbed" by the for
eign organizers.
Chavez said tribes brought up
from the Yucatan by growers were
now experiencing medical prob
lems. He said their chiefs are warned
in their Mayan language against hav
ing any dealings with the UFWA. Be
cause they can't communicate in
Spanish with the other Mexicans,
they will let their members die

before they'll let the UFWA take
them to a hospital.
Chavez called President Ronald
Reagan's new immigration reform
bill "terrible," saying that immigra
tion laws "have been racist from the
beggining." The bill calls for sanc
tions against employers of un
documented workersand introduces
a "guest worker" program
Chavez continues to work for the
UFWA merely for room, board, and
$10 per week stipend, as do all other
officers of the Union, he said. He said
he hopes they would someday have
the means to pay organizers salaries,
stating that the administration con
tinued on its volunteer basis"not out
of deep commitment," but out of
"necessity." He said presently one
quarter of union dues go to a strike
fund, and two-thirds to the union's
legal department.
Chavez said issues such as the air
controllers strike draw the UFWA to
gether with other unions, and he
called Reagan's action against the
strikers "persecuting" not "prose
cuting."
Chavez, the son of an Arizona
farmer who became a migrant work
ers when his land was taken away,
helped found the UFWA (then called
the National Farmworkers Union) in
1963. He is viewed as a religious,
ethnic, and social justice leader, as
well as a union president.
Chavez came here to speak on the
social justice of hunger, as part of
Hunger Awareness Week. He also
spoke to the Chicano community on
"Renewal of Commitment" â€” not
forgetting underprivileged
"brothers and sisters" when students
become doctors, lawyers, or other
professionals.
