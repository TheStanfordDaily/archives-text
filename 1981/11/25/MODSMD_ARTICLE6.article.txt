# Kaplan honored for his contributions to mankind

Dr. Henry Kaplan, D'Ambrogio professor of radiology and
a faculty member here since 1948, last Tuesday received a
plaque from the Exploratorium of San Francisco during its
annual special awards dinner. The plaque was awarded to
Kaplan in honor of his noted career as a professor, physician
and especially for his important discoveries in the fields of
clinical and cancer research.
Kaplan is probably best known for his contributions to the
fundamental understanding of the biology and immunology
of Hodgkin's disease. In fact, he is widely considered the ma
jor reason Hodgkin's has changed from an almost-always fa
tal disease a generation ago to one of the most curable can
cers today.
Kaplan is currently involved in three areas of research:
monoclonal antibodies, Hodgkins's disease, and rheumatoid
arthritis.
Kaplan's work with monoclonal antibodies involves a
process of cloning human cell hybridsasan unlimited source
of specific antibodies, and also the potential of these anti
bodies in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. He dis
covered the process two years ago with Dr. Lennart Olsson.
Kaplan and Olsson's discovery was based on the work of
scientists at Cambridge University, who six years ago devised
a new way of producing antibodies for mice. Antibodies are
created by the body's immune system to fight infections.
The British scientists fused cells which produce antibodies
when stimulated with a foreign substance, called B Lym
posites related cancer cell. The cancer cell, or Myeloma,
makes the B Lymposite immortal, and allows it to excrete the
antibodies it creates instead of keeping them to itself as it
normally would.
Kaplan and Olsson succeeded in using the same basic ap
proach invented by the British scientists to create human

antibodies. Kaplan said he thinks these antibodies could be
quite safe if used in the human body in the diagnosis and
treatment of infectious diseases due to viruses and bacteria,
immunological diseases or reactions and, potentially,
cancer.
These special antibodies could be used in both the detec
tion and the elimination of cancer cells. They would function
as "guided missiles," Kaplan said. However, Kaplan also
stressed the theoretical nature of this research at the present,
stating that "there are no human antibodies currently avail
able for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer."
Kaplan's recent work with Hodgkin's disease has also pro
duced encouraging results. In the latest trials of relation and
drug therapy for the disease here, 86 percent of Hodgkin's
victims have survived seven years after diagnosis. According
to Stanford researchers, the five-year survival rate for the dis
ease nationwide is significantly lower, at 55 percent.
This success has prompted Kaplan and Dr. Saul Rosenberg,
a Stanford oncologist, to experiment with the radiation and
drug therapy to reduce its terrible side effects: a five percent
chance of developing a fatal leukemia, the potential for de
veloping inflammation of the lungs and heart and decreased
immunity to infections.
Kaplan and Rosenberg's approach is toadminister less tox
ic drug combinations for patients who are in the early stages
of the disease and who have a favorable prognosis. Patients
with more developed cases of Hodgkins's are receiving an
experimental four-drug combination that the researchers
said they hope will be less damaging than the usual cure.
Kaplan is optimistic about his work in this area. "It may be
possible to cure 100 percent (of Hodgkin's victims) instead of
86 percent, and that's what we're trying to get to," he said.
Kaplan's pioneering research in rheumatoid arthritis has
been so successful that it was recently written up in Time

magazine. Kaplan devised a technique of radiation therapy,
similar to that used in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease, for
victims of rheumatoid arthritis.
In a study conducted here, researchers then tested the
new method on patients of rheumatoid arthritis who had
failed to respond to conventional treatment.
The results were promising: out of 11 patients in the study,
nine had "very dramatic responses," he said.
A second study is currently underway, this time using 30
patients. Kaplan has several goals for this project. First, he
said, "we want to confirm those findings (from the first study)
and be sure that they hold up." Secondly, "we are trying to
find if the dose of radiation we used the first time was op
timal, or if less could be used."
Kaplan is also interested in the long-term results of his new
treatment. And, since rheumatoid arthritis is a benign dis
ease, he wants to be sure that patients are free from future
complications relating to the treatment.
Kaplan emphasized that his treatment is still in the testing
stages, because researchers haven't yet seen its long term re
sults. As in his first studv, he will not accept patients who have
recently contracted the disease, but onlv those who have
had it for some time and who have failed to respond to
conventional treatments.
Will President Ronald Reagan's federal budget cuts affect
his research grants? "There will be a 12 percent cut in the
budgets of any existing grants" at their next expiration date,
according to Kaplan, and several of these are coming up next
spring.
Kaplan said he hopes none of his workers will have to be
laid off as a result. He plans to absorb the difference in funds,
supplies and the number of mice used in the laboratory. The
inevitable result of the cuts, he said, will be to "slow down
the research."
