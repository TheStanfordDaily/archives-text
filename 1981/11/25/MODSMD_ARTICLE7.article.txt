## Will Earth bake like Venus? 
### Jennifer Seymour 
Although Venus has intrigued
astronomers since the earliest days of star
gazing, onlv in the most recent studies,
particularly National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's (NASA) Mission
Pioneer Venus, has the significance of
Venus's environment to us on Earth been
revealed.
Launched in 1978, the Pioneer Venus
Probes and Orbiter provided scientists
with invaluable data about Venus. The four
Probes recorded information about
Venus's atmosphere before being de
stroyed bv heat and pressure after plung
ing into the Venusian atmosphere, while
the Pioneer Venus Orbiter continues to re
lav data from its instruments.
Results from this Pioneer Venus data
analyses prompted NASA's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View to initiate the
first International Conference of the
Venus Environment, as an oppportunity to
publicly correlate their findings about
Venus's climate, and its relationship to our
own.
Meeting at Rickv's Hyatt in early No
vember, 114 Venus experts from around
the world (but predominantly from NASA-
Ames), discussed Venus's composition, at
mospheric circulation, weather, origins,
geology, differences from earth and pos
sible explanations for each element.
Scientists also debated issues such as the
existence of lightning on Venus, what
caused the abundance of rare gases like
Argon on the planet and what processes
make Venus' strangeglow ("Ashen Glow")
often observed by astronomers.
Amidst numerous presentations, how
ever, one aspect of Venus's atmosphere
received considerable attention: the
Greenhouse effect.
A greenhouse effect occurs when the

surface temperature of a planet is raised as
sunlight passes through the atmosphere
verv easilv but can not escape, because at
mospheric components like carbon diox
ide convert it to longer-wave radiation.
Researchers have been concurrently
studying this effect on Venus, where it
plavs a predominant role, and on Earth,
where its role becomes increasingly im
portant as we continue to put carbon diox
ide into our atmosphere by burning fossil
fuels.
Results from the Pioneer Venus data in
dicate that a greenhouse effect on Venus
has baked the sister planet to a searing 900
degrees Fahrenheit, leaving the surface
void of water and 100 percent covered by
clouds (Earth is 50 percent covered by
clouds), reported Dr. Chris Toon of NASA
at the Venus Conference Press Con
ference.
According to Toon, studies also show an
atmospheric pressure equal to the pres
sure we would encounter 3000 feet down
in the ocean, the product of a severe
greenhouse effect as well as a stagnant cap
of glowing yellow sulfuric acid clouds, a
smog potent enough to seriously burn
vou.
What does Venus's greenhouse effect
have to do with Earth? Unfortunately, a lot.
Researchers such as Toon, and associate
James Pollack, calculated Venus's tem
perature, using their own theoretical
model of Venus instead of Pioneer rec
ordings. Their prediction, about 850
degrees Fahrenheit, proved highly ac
curate once the Pioneer recordings be
came available (These showed Venus to be
900 degrees.).
"This made us more assured of the ac
curacy of our model," said Toon.
Using the same sort of model for Earth,
Toon, Pollack and others predicted tem

peratures for the Earth in the next century.
Their result? That the Earth could heat up
more than 2 degrees in 50-100 years if we
continue to hum fossil fuels at current
rates.
According to Toon, the problem will
worsen as coal is commercialized because
it releases greater quantities of
hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. A
doubling of carbon dioxide levels in
Earth's atmosphere is thus predicted for
the next century.
If two degrees sounds inconsequential,
consider the 'Xntarctic ice sheet that would
melt if heated this much: it stores enough
water to raise all oceans 15 feet, said Toon.
That would put much of Florida and
some of California under water, and cause
severe droughts, studies at Princeton in
dicate, along with other serious ramifica
tions, reported Toon.
And recent studies by Columbia Univer
sity reserachers George Kukla and Joyce
Gavin supported these conclusions, re
porting that the extent of snow pack
around Antarctica during summers has de
creased since before the 19705, while the
average temperature in this zone is up .9
degrees.
"But these results are tentative," warned
Kukla and Gavin. "Since it is not known to
what extent the obseved changes in snow
and sea ice areas and in surface tem
peratures can be explained by natural fluc
tuations."
Through continued research on Earth
and Venus, scientists hope to further
document atmospheric changes, and es
pecially the greenhouse effect. Thus
Vonus continues to hold the attention of
planetary experts. Further NASA research
on the greenhouse effect is in jeopardy, as
are other research programs due to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's budget cuts.

ide convert it to longer-wave radiation.
Researchers have been concurrently
studying this effect on Venus, where it
plavs a predominant role, and on Earth,
where its role becomes increasingly im
portant as we continue to put carbon diox
ide into our atmosphere by burning fossil
fuels.
Results from the Pioneer Venus data in
dicate that a greenhouse effect on Venus
has baked the sister planet to a searing 900
degrees Fahrenheit, leaving the surface
void of water and 100 percent covered by
clouds (Earth is 50 percent covered by
clouds), reported Dr. Chris Toon of NASA
at the Venus Conference Press Con
ference.
According to Toon, studies also show an
atmospheric pressure equal to the pres
sure we would encounter 3000 feet down
in the ocean, the product of a severe
greenhouse effect as well as a stagnant cap
of glowing yellow sulfuric acid clouds, a
smog potent enough to seriously burn
vou.
What does Venus's greenhouse effect
have to do with Earth? Unfortunately, a lot.
Researchers such as Toon, and associate
James Pollack, calculated Venus's tem
perature, using their own theoretical
model of Venus instead of Pioneer rec
ordings. Their prediction, about 850
degrees Fahrenheit, proved highly ac
curate once the Pioneer recordings be
came available (These showed Venus to be
900 degrees.).
"This made us more assured of the ac
curacy of our model," said Toon.
Using the same sort of model for Earth,
Toon, Pollack and others predicted tem

peratures for the Earth in the next century.
Their result? That the Earth could heat up
more than 2 degrees in 50-100 years if we
continue to hum fossil fuels at current
rates.
According to Toon, the problem will
worsen as coal is commercialized because
it releases greater quantities of
hydrocarbons into the atmosphere. A
doubling of carbon dioxide levels in
Earth's atmosphere is thus predicted for
the next century.
If two degrees sounds inconsequential,
consider the 'Xntarctic ice sheet that would
melt if heated this much: it stores enough
water to raise all oceans 15 feet, said Toon.
That would put much of Florida and
some of California under water, and cause
severe droughts, studies at Princeton in
dicate, along with other serious ramifica
tions, reported Toon.
And recent studies by Columbia Univer
sity reserachers George Kukla and Joyce
Gavin supported these conclusions, re
porting that the extent of snow pack
around Antarctica during summers has de
creased since before the 19705, while the
average temperature in this zone is up .9
degrees.
"But these results are tentative," warned
Kukla and Gavin. "Since it is not known to
what extent the obseved changes in snow
and sea ice areas and in surface tem
peratures can be explained by natural fluc
tuations."
Through continued research on Earth
and Venus, scientists hope to further
document atmospheric changes, and es
pecially the greenhouse effect. Thus
Vonus continues to hold the attention of
planetary experts. Further NASA research
on the greenhouse effect is in jeopardy, as
are other research programs due to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's budget cuts.

Although Venus has intrigued
astronomers since the earliest days of star
gazing, onlv in the most recent studies,
particularly National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's (NASA) Mission
Pioneer Venus, has the significance of
Venus's environment to us on Earth been
revealed.
Launched in 1978, the Pioneer Venus
Probes and Orbiter provided scientists
with invaluable data about Venus. The four
Probes recorded information about
Venus's atmosphere before being de
stroyed bv heat and pressure after plung
ing into the Venusian atmosphere, while
the Pioneer Venus Orbiter continues to re
lav data from its instruments.
Results from this Pioneer Venus data
analyses prompted NASA's Ames Research
Center in Mountain View to initiate the
first International Conference of the
Venus Environment, as an oppportunity to
publicly correlate their findings about
Venus's climate, and its relationship to our
own.
Meeting at Rickv's Hyatt in early No
vember, 114 Venus experts from around
the world (but predominantly from NASA-
Ames), discussed Venus's composition, at
mospheric circulation, weather, origins,
geology, differences from earth and pos
sible explanations for each element.
Scientists also debated issues such as the
existence of lightning on Venus, what
caused the abundance of rare gases like
Argon on the planet and what processes
make Venus' strangeglow ("Ashen Glow")
often observed by astronomers.
Amidst numerous presentations, how
ever, one aspect of Venus's atmosphere
received considerable attention: the
Greenhouse effect.
A greenhouse effect occurs when the

surface temperature of a planet is raised as
sunlight passes through the atmosphere
verv easilv but can not escape, because at
mospheric components like carbon diox
