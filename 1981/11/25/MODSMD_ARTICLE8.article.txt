# The
						search for quarks

Directly challenging established theories,
physicists here are presently demonstrating
experimentally the independent existence of
quarks, the building blocks of all matter and
electrical charge.
Until 1965, all matter was thought to be
made of the sub-atomic particles: protons,
neutrons, and electrons. Since then, how
ever, physicists have predicted that these par
ticles were in turn made from other particles,
one group being quarks.
There are six types of quarks — up, down,
charm, strange, top, and bottom, each with its
anti-matter equivalent, which has the op
posite charge. These quarks have a positive or
negative electrical charge of one-third or
two-thirds, which contradicts the old theory
that charge could only exist as a whole
n umber.
Since 1969, in the basement of the Varian
building, Prof. Bill Fairbank, Art Hebard,
George Laßue, and Jim Phillips have been ex
perimenting to find fractional charges, in
dications of the presence of quarks, on
niobium spheres "a little smaller than the tip
of a ball point pen" and supercooled to mi
nus 269 degrees Celsius.
"We found in fact that we got exactly one
third of a charge on the first spheres," Fair
bank said. "We got a minus one-third (which
corresponds to a two-thirds charge) and
then, later on, we got a plus one-third. How
ever, we couldn't be absolutely certain that
we weren't seeing some spurious effect."
This experiment, which was originally de
veloped in Hebard's Ph.D. dissertation, was
modified in the mid-1970s by Laßue to make
the results more conclusive.
In May, 1977, the scientists were thus able
to publish the first paper giving evidence that
fractional charge existed on matter. They said
this was probably because one or two quarks
existed without being incorporated into the
protons and neutrons of the million-trillion
atoms in the sphere.
Yet, theorists said that quarks can't be sepa
rated from each other because, as Fairbank
said, "as you move out, the force stays cons
tant, and I would have to use an infinite
amount of energy to pull them totally apart."
Also, in order to reconcile Fermi's principle
(the theory that vou can only have a certain
number of charges at certain distances from
each other in the atom) with the theory that
several quarks make up particles, theoristsas

signed quarks three different arbitrary colors
— red, blue, and green. According to theory,
you can have one color and its anti-quark,
which is the same color, producing zero, or
vou can have red, blue, and green quarks,
producing white.
"Thus, you can't have free quarks, because
vou always have to cancel color," Fairbank
saiil, "But whenever you cancel color, you
get an integer charge. If our experiment is re
all v' ( eing fractional charges, then one of two
things is true — either there is another kind of
particle that has color and integer charge, or
else quarks can be free."
Experiments done at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SLAC) by Prof. Alan Litke have
"seen these quarks inside the proton and
neutron," Fairbank said, "by observing large
angle scattering (of high energy particles that
bombard protons and neutrons) as if they hit
something inside." Experiments done at
SLAC, however, have not seen any fractional
charges on quarks.
Since 1969, 56 determinations of charge
have been made on the 19 niobium balls, with
each measurement taking about a week.
"The sooner this becomes obsolete, the bet
ter," Laßue said, because its a very laborious
process, requiring several measurements to
be made on each ball before being able to
calculate the charge on it.
Occasionally, a week of measurements had
to be scrapped becauseofoccurancessuchas
minor earthquakes or the sphere losing its
charge in the middle of the measurements.
In any case, "the thirds are glaringly ob
vious," Laßue said, "As far as getting two
tenths of a charge, we don't get any. We find
all zeros and one-thirds."
Fairbank, Phillips, and Rick Fisel are begin
ning to do the same experiment with iron
balls at room temperature. This experiment
has been tried before by the scientists E. D.
Garris and K. O. H. Ziock and showed no in
dications of fractional charge. Improvements
in procedures and the sensitivity of measur
ing devices make the Stanford scientists
hopeful that they will find fractional charge
on these balls.
Laßue is presently trying to measure the
charge on mass directly from the generated
electric field, instead of measuring the force
needed to balance the electric force of the
balls as was done in this experiment, though
he said, "I don't know if I can get it to work."
