## Is Stanford just a game? Two graduates here believe so 
### Jane McConnell 
VVh.it would you do if the short story
you "borrowed" for your fiction class
turned out to have been written by your
professor under a pen name? If you were
playing the Stanford Game, you'd sub
tract three units and 10 social points and
wait until your next turn.
The Stanford Game, a board game
which came out this fall, was developed
by Heidi Roizen and Tim Draper, both
1980 Stanford graduates.
The game is played with token pieces
which accumulate "units" as they move
around a map of Campus Drive. The win
ner is the player who "graduates" with
the highest success rating, based on final
GPA, social stature, and resume stars.

"In certain respects, it (the game) issim
ilar to real life," said Roizen. "Because
success is determined by a combination
of three factors, it shows that in the long
run, English majors can do as well as engi
neering majors. You may get more re
sume stars as an engineer, but there are
fewer social points."
As the players move around the board,
they collect cards, which either increase
or decrease their points. For example, if
the card says, "your parents come to visit
every week" or"your roommate is a disco
instructor," the player loses 10 social
points, but if one draws "the bartenders
at the 'O' know you by name," 20 social
points are added.
At the end of the game, the three sets of

points are totalled and the summation de
termines the player's sue r ess rating for 20
years down the road. For example, a pre
law student with less than 1000 points
"will still be an ASSU senator," while a
pre-med with more than 4000 points
"cures death."
"Having the final success rating 20 years
later is more like real life because it pro
vides a chance for everything to equal
out. Everyone can win the game, or ev
eryone can lose," said Roizen.
Draper and Roizen came up with the
idea for the game this past January. "We
were trying to decide how we were going
to strike it rich. We got to talking about
how school was such a game, and we

thought, 'That's it! We'll make a college
oriented board game,' " said Draper.
"We were discussing how it doesn't re
ally matter what you major in or what you
learn; it is all a matter of collecting units
and getting involved in the right outside
activities. So we decided to make a game
of it — a game to encompass Stanford as it
really is," Roizen said.
Nine months passed from the planning
stages to completion of the game.
"It was a mutual effort," said Roizen.
"Tim and I come from very different
backgrounds — he was an engineering
major, an ASSU senator, and a football
player. I was an English major involved in
the Daily, dorm plays and creative writ

ing. We brought our separate ideas to
gether."
"We wanted to make it as much like
Stanford as possible. We tried to grade
things appropriately — for example, one
resume star equals 100 social points, be
cause it is much easier to be popular than
to get work experience," she said.
After preparing a demonstration
model, Draper and Roizen asked students
and alumni to play the game and provide
input.
The venture was financed completely
bv Draper and Roizen. "Heidi gambled
her winter quarter tuition on it," said
Draper. The printing costs totalled about
$13,000 and if all copies sell, Draper and
Roi/en expect to make profits of $8000.
"It's definitely a labor of love," said
Roi/en. "We are only making about 50
cents an hour."
The games sell for about $18 each and
2500 were printed this year. They are car
ried in the Stanford Bookstore, four stores
in the Stanford Shopping Center, and
stores in the San Francisco area.
Both Draper and Roizen are pleased
with the game's success. According to
Draper, the Bookstore has sold more than
150 games. "You can never tell until
Christmas," said Draper. "The month of
December is when game manufacturers
do 50 percent of their business."
Added Roizen, "We expect to sell a lot
at Christmastime. One alum just bought
10 games to give to each of his old room
mates as Christmas presents."
Customers also see the game as a way to
acquaint prospective students with Stan
ford. In fact, the game slogan is "put your
kid through Stanford for less than $20."
Once the first 2500 copies have sold,
Draper and Roizen plan either to sell the
idea, or continue to print updated edi
tions. "Although many of he jokes will
always be current, some things will be
outdated in five vears," said Draper.
In addition, the pair plan to go into pro
duction of other college games. "Seven
ty-five percent of thesquaresapplvtoany
university. All we have to do is change the
campus maps and some of the jokes," said
Roizen. They are currently working on a
UCLA and a USC game.
"I think we have set a good example for
voung people to get going. We are only
one year out of college, and yet we have
proved that it is possible to do something
like this and succeed," said Draper.
Roizen added, "Entrepreneuring is a
lot of hard work, but if is also a lot of fun
and very rewarding. Sometimes I go in the
Bookstore and just stand by the game rack
to hear people's reactions as they read it.
It makes me feel so good when they
laugh."
So next time you go the Halloween par
ty at the Mausoleum dressed as yourself,
and everyone thinks you are the ghost of
little Leland Jr., don't panic. Just subtract
20 social points and roll again.

how school was such a game, and we

thought, 'That's it! We'll make a college
oriented board game,' " said Draper.
"We were discussing how it doesn't re
ally matter what you major in or what you
learn; it is all a matter of collecting units
and getting involved in the right outside
activities. So we decided to make a game
of it — a game to encompass Stanford as it
really is," Roizen said.
Nine months passed from the planning
stages to completion of the game.
"It was a mutual effort," said Roizen.
"Tim and I come from very different
backgrounds — he was an engineering
major, an ASSU senator, and a football
player. I was an English major involved in
the Daily, dorm plays and creative writ

ing. We brought our separate ideas to
gether."
"We wanted to make it as much like
Stanford as possible. We tried to grade
things appropriately — for example, one
resume star equals 100 social points, be
cause it is much easier to be popular than
to get work experience," she said.
After preparing a demonstration
model, Draper and Roizen asked students
and alumni to play the game and provide
input.
The venture was financed completely
bv Draper and Roizen. "Heidi gambled
her winter quarter tuition on it," said
Draper. The printing costs totalled about
$13,000 and if all copies sell, Draper and
Roi/en expect to make profits of $8000.
"It's definitely a labor of love," said
Roi/en. "We are only making about 50
cents an hour."
The games sell for about $18 each and
2500 were printed this year. They are car
ried in the Stanford Bookstore, four stores
in the Stanford Shopping Center, and
stores in the San Francisco area.
Both Draper and Roizen are pleased
with the game's success. According to
Draper, the Bookstore has sold more than
150 games. "You can never tell until
Christmas," said Draper. "The month of
December is when game manufacturers
do 50 percent of their business."
Added Roizen, "We expect to sell a lot
at Christmastime. One alum just bought
10 games to give to each of his old room
mates as Christmas presents."
Customers also see the game as a way to
acquaint prospective students with Stan
ford. In fact, the game slogan is "put your
kid through Stanford for less than $20."
Once the first 2500 copies have sold,
Draper and Roizen plan either to sell the
idea, or continue to print updated edi
tions. "Although many of he jokes will
always be current, some things will be
outdated in five vears," said Draper.
In addition, the pair plan to go into pro
duction of other college games. "Seven
ty-five percent of thesquaresapplvtoany
university. All we have to do is change the
campus maps and some of the jokes," said
Roizen. They are currently working on a
UCLA and a USC game.
"I think we have set a good example for
voung people to get going. We are only
one year out of college, and yet we have
proved that it is possible to do something
like this and succeed," said Draper.
Roizen added, "Entrepreneuring is a
lot of hard work, but if is also a lot of fun
and very rewarding. Sometimes I go in the
Bookstore and just stand by the game rack
to hear people's reactions as they read it.
It makes me feel so good when they
laugh."
So next time you go the Halloween par
ty at the Mausoleum dressed as yourself,
and everyone thinks you are the ghost of
little Leland Jr., don't panic. Just subtract
20 social points and roll again.

VVh.it would you do if the short story
you "borrowed" for your fiction class
turned out to have been written by your
professor under a pen name? If you were
playing the Stanford Game, you'd sub
tract three units and 10 social points and
wait until your next turn.
The Stanford Game, a board game
which came out this fall, was developed
by Heidi Roizen and Tim Draper, both
1980 Stanford graduates.
The game is played with token pieces
which accumulate "units" as they move
around a map of Campus Drive. The win
ner is the player who "graduates" with
the highest success rating, based on final
GPA, social stature, and resume stars.

"In certain respects, it (the game) issim
ilar to real life," said Roizen. "Because
success is determined by a combination
of three factors, it shows that in the long
run, English majors can do as well as engi
neering majors. You may get more re
sume stars as an engineer, but there are
fewer social points."
As the players move around the board,
they collect cards, which either increase
or decrease their points. For example, if
the card says, "your parents come to visit
every week" or"your roommate is a disco
instructor," the player loses 10 social
points, but if one draws "the bartenders
at the 'O' know you by name," 20 social
points are added.
At the end of the game, the three sets of

points are totalled and the summation de
termines the player's sue r ess rating for 20
years down the road. For example, a pre
law student with less than 1000 points
"will still be an ASSU senator," while a
pre-med with more than 4000 points
"cures death."
"Having the final success rating 20 years
later is more like real life because it pro
vides a chance for everything to equal
out. Everyone can win the game, or ev
eryone can lose," said Roizen.
Draper and Roizen came up with the
idea for the game this past January. "We
were trying to decide how we were going
to strike it rich. We got to talking about
how school was such a game, and we

thought, 'That's it! We'll make a college
