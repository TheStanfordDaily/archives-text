LITERATURE SEARCHING
Through the Computer Search Service of the Stanford libraries, experienced library staff
can often retrieve the same or similar material for you in a short time by searching one or
more of over 100 databases. In addition to single retrospective searches, current aware
ness profiles can be established to provide you with periodic (e.g. monthly) searches on a
topic of ongoing interest. Disciplines covered include business and management, en
gineering technology, humanities, life and physical sciences, and social and behavioral
sciences.
THE RESULT?
Computter-generated list(s) of references —often with summaries—to books, conference
proceedings, dissertations, government documents, and/or journal articles on your topic
of interest. Also, business and economic statistics and patents.
THE COST?
Generally ranges 112 rom $10 to $30, per retrospective search. Current awareness searches
generally cost $5 to $10, per periodic update.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Available from the reference staff in most libraries at Stanford or the General Reference
Department, Green Library (7-1811).
Note: Most Stanford libraries restrict this service to current faculty, students, and staff of
the University.
