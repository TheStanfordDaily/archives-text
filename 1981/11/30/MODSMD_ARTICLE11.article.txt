## Start protecting life at conception 
### 
I suspect many Daily readers found Alec Rawls' sug
gestion (Daily, Nov. 19) that people be allowed to kill un
wanted infants up to the age of one so outlandish that
they thought he was being sarcastic! But his extension of
the pro-abortion argument to include young children is
indeed natural. After all, 6-month-olds are probably
more noisy and more demanding than fetuses, and just
as dependent! But the argument does "force examina
tion of the meaning and relevance of the concept em
ployed in the abortion debate," and when looked at
closely, reveals severe problems with the pro-abor
tion/pro-euthanasia stance.
First, he argues that to believe that human life should
be protected from the moment of conception is to take a
"religious" position. Actually, it is no more a value
judgement than Rawls' own belief that life only should
be protected after the age of one.
Second, Rawls wants us to believe that parents' ability
to plan is important enough that parents need the option
of abortion, not to mention the freedom to eliminate a
child under a certain age. What a self-centered premise!
— as if one's own plans werethe most perfect and impor
tant things one could ever encounter. Furthermore, why
kill the kids? Why not allow parents to put them in state
homes?
Third, he would have us believe that under the"toler

ant perspective of liberalism" we should not begrudge a
woman or a couple "that difficult decision (whether or
not toabort) should they make it."Tolerance, as I under
stand it, though, has never required people to be toler
ant when fundamental human rights are at stake. For in
stance, in places where women are not legal persons, I
feel free to advocate a change in the laws. Is that being
intolerant toall men who would lord it over women? Yes
— but it is nevertheless appropriate. (But I forget: Rawls
doesn't think we are endowed with rights; we only ac
cord them to each other. If that's the case, it's not clear
whv tolerance is a societal virtue at all.) At any rate, al
though opposition to abortion seems intolerant to those
who want abortions, it is equally intolerant to say to
fetusesand one-year-olds, "Sorry, we have no obligation
to protect you."
If infants don't deserve a legal right to life before the
age of one, it seems arbitrary, to say the least, to fix that
magic moment at one as opposed to, say, three or seven.
I hope people will realize this, and come not to agree
with Rawls but to reduce their own support for abortion.
To oppose abortion is part of being consistently tolerant
toward all human beings, no matter how different, how
helpless, or how old they may be.
