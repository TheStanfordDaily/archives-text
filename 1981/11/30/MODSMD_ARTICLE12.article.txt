## Male escort plan contains radical solution, worthy sacrifice 
### 
I am infuriated by the recent re
sponses in the Daily to the bold sug
gestion by Jeanne Fleming and Susan
Hammond of a mandatory escort ser
vice for males (Daily, Nov. 13), and I
am especially outraged by the "blind,
irrational," and utterly insensitive let
ter by Brad Jameson (Daily, Nov. 19).
If these are the responses of "en
lightened" men, then our world is in
deed in sorry shape.
Jameson and, to a lesser extent, Pe
ter Bacchetti (Daily, Nov. 18), re
sponded to Fleming and Hammond's

suggestion in typically male fashion:
"We are verv sorry that women are
imprisoned by a justifed fear of vio
lence, hut don't you dare try to
deprive us of our God given (trans
lation: male-produced) rights as
males — the freedom to walk almost
anywhere at any time without fear,
the privilege of inspiring fear in
women by our solitary presence on
walkways (in bushes, on jogging
trails, etc.), and, most importantly,
the right to condone, encourage and
perhaps even commit acts of vio

lence against women. Since it is un
fair to imprison men just because
women are imprisoned by fear, let's
keep the women imprisoned (since
we men are the more powerful
group), and, in the meantime, we'll
work on changing our attitudes
which foster rape." This attitude is
condescending and demeaning; it is
equivalent to "humoring the little
women." It also shows a total lack of
understanding of the gist of Fleming
and Hammond's letter.
I seriously question the validity of
both the reasoning and the under
lying premises of Jameson's argu
ment. He argues that Fleming and
Hammond's proposal would unjustly
punish innocent men. Is Jameson
suggesting that it is okay to punish in
nocent women by depriving them of
their freedom? Or is he arguing that
all women are guilty of something
(e.g., provoking male violence)
which allows us to legitimately
deprive them of this freedom?

Jameson also suggests that rape is the
work of "a few, sick deviants."
I must disagree with this assertion.
In our culture, rape is neither sick nor
deviant. From a very early age, we are
taught, albeit in very subtle ways, that
forceful sexual conquest of a female
is the ultimately gratifying act for the
normal American male (as well as for
the female), and we are also taught
that all women secretly want to be
raped. Indeed, violence against
women — real or symbolic — occurs
millions of times each day, in ways
that none of us would normally think
to be sick or deviant.
A simple content analysis of our
newspapers, new broadcasts, popu
lar fiction, movies, television pro
grams and even our language would
suffice to underscore this argument
(for instance, Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington's evaluation of a
male's assault on a female bicycle
rider as "playful").
The most frequently espoused

"fair" solution to the recent wave of
campus rapes has been to call on
men to escort women who must
journey out after dark. However,
protection of women by men is not
the solution to the problem. This
serves only to perpetuate the subser
vience of women to men, and it does
absolutely nothing to alleviate wom
en's fear of men — it simply transfers
the object of this fear from all men to
"bad" men (Incidentally, in the white
man's world, "bad" man usually
means black man).
I agree that Fleming and Ham
mond's proposal is drastic, but it is
not, by any stretch of the imagina
tion, ludicrous; it is certainly no more
ludicrous than the situation as it
stands. "Fair" and gradual solutions
are extremely ineffective; values and
attitudes can be changed, if at all,
only over the course of decades (or,
more likely, centuries). Violence
against women is a drastic and all
pervasive social problem which ne

cessitates radical and immediate
solutions. Radical solutions necessar
ily entail sacrifices, but these sacri
fices must be shared equally, and
they are a small price to pay for the
benefits they will produce. All of us
— women and men alike — must
share the responsibility for quick and
effective solutions to the problem of
rape, and, as with birth control, it is
about time that we men agree to
shoulder our fairshareof the respon
sibility.
A male curfew and a male escort
service — whether voluntary or man
datory — will serve to eliminate some
of the fear that women must face ev
ery minute of every day. I think we
men should be more than willing to
sacrifice a small amount of our free
dom so that the other half of the pop
ulation can enjoy some of the same
freedom.
