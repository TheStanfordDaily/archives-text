## Angry essay won't create good partner 
### 
In response to"Letter to a Stanford
bov" (D.iilv, Nov. 24): sadness, em
pathy and anger are not enough. In
particular, surely it is frightening
when a discussion of college sex goes
no further than the truism that some
human beings are insensitive, selfish
and destructive. Ves, it would be very
nice if simply sleeping with them —
or writing them angry public letters
— did anyone much good.
It clears the air to remember two
legitimate approaches to college re
lationships. The first is to avoid in
tercourse, because even with con
traception the trauma of unwanted
conception is possible. The second
approach is to practice intercourse
using contraception, after both part
ners know each other well and have a
long talk about the possibility of
pregnancy. Outside of these two ap
proaches, each man and woman is
free to choose partners willing to
hurt us as much as we let them.
Mv heart goes out to the woman
alone in her trauma. Angry essays are
important,but they will never pro
duce a Stanford where bed partners
are unavailable. Our response is in
complete unless we also focus atten

tion on coping with the world as it is.

'Playful'assault?
I was infuriated by a remark made
by Police Chief Marvin Herrington
which was quoted on the front page
(Daily, Nov. 19). Speaking of the as
sault on a Stanford Hospital employ
ee on Nov. 12, Herrington described
the woman's assailant as "playful."
Herrington is quoted as saying, "If
he had wanted to pull her off her bi
cycle he could have. Not that he
should have done it, but I think he
was just being playful." The implica
tion is that this assault was not crimi
nal because the man did not carry
through a rape.
Our confidence in the Stanford po
lice has already been eroded by re
cent articles about missing or dis
regarded assault reports. Her
rington's assertion that a male
stranger who makes a grab for a
woman on a public street is "being
playful" raises serious doubts about
his understanding of the whole issue

of rape and the psychological and
physical repression that women are
forced to live with all their lives.
No assault is "play" — whether it
be a whistle, crude verbal abuse, a
physical attack or an actual rape.
Nothing will ever change for us until
we all see that the subjugation of
women, at home, on the job and on
the street, is not a game.

Spray rapists
This is apropos of the present fear
some epidemic on the Stanford cam
pus.
I have long wondered why a can of
spray paint has not been proposed as
a defense against rapists.
Give one of these birds a coating of
bright canary yellow. Along with big
publicity: I'll betcha many incipient
crimes would never occur!
Sounds like a project for a lady
cop!!
"Entrapment"? Certainly.

Big Game bands
For many years my husband and I
attended the Big Game. Then there
was a span of 13 years when we didn't
attend.
With great anticipation we at
tended the Big Game on Nov. 21. We
enjoyed every minute of it — tailgate
party, rain and our wonderful
triumph.
However, I thought I had lost my
senses or my eyesight. Would some
body please explain to me what the
Stanford Band was doing? The music
sounded fine, but what a mess on the
field!

Splendid paradox
Is it not a splendid paradox that
President Ronald Reagan has suc
ceeded single-handedly where the
collective efforts of the radical move
ment have failed: he has stopped the
government! And they say he has no
vision!
