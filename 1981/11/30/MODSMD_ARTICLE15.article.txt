## Commentary/Kenneth Smith Potato latkes business cooks up trypan fracas 
### 
It is commonly claimed that the
acronym PLO stands for the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
Actually PLO stands for "Potato
Latkes Organization" and its mem
bers are radical Palestinians who are
insanely jealous of the Israeli ability
to make good potato latkes.
As a result, the PLO has engaged in
numerous nefarious schemes. For
example, it once hijacked an El Al jet
crammed full of potato latkes, but
was thwarted by Israeli security.
In addition, the PLO makes re
peated border incursions into Israel
in an effort to kill legitimate potato
latkes dealers and to steal their inven
tory. Lately, these attempts have not
met with success.
However, all Israeli mothers know
to place their own latkes under close
armed guard in order to prevent
their otherwise inevitable theft.

Most threateningly, the PLO has
launched a "diplomatic initiative"
claiming that Moslems, not Jews, ori
ginally invented the latkes and de
manded the return of all latkes
owned by Israelis or by Jews any
where in the world. A resolution sup
porting this demand passed by near
unanimous vote in the United Na
tions.
Since the bulk of the business (and
pleasure) of the latkesoccursannual
ly near the wintertime holiday of
Hanukkah, Israelis are especially
cautious this time of year, fearing
new assaults on potato latkes installa
tions.
The PLO has countered by drafting

UN resolutions which state that
H.inukkah is not and never has been
a Jewish holiday. The United States
vetoed this measure but Britain,
France and West Germany abstained.
PLO chief Hazar Ghabazar at
tributed this veto to "the pressure of
the Jewish lobby in America," an ac
cusation American Jewsangrily deny.
Meanwhile, the United States has
committed itself to "not deal with the
PLO until it accepts the right of Jews
to make potato latkes" which the
PLO has heretofore refused to do.
Several states have suggested that
Israel give the PLO all their existing
potato latkes but that she be allowed
to keep any that she makes in the
future. Both Israel and the PLO have
rejected this compromise.
Israel claims that the PLO will nev
er settle for half a loaf while PLO

spokesmen have said virtually the
same thing.
Whenasked ifshethoughtthePLO
would one day change its policies re
garding Jewish rights, one Jewish
grandmother responded with a Yid
dish expression that can roughtly be
translated as followed: "If my grand
mother had wheels, she would be a
carriage."
Asked how Israel and Jews manage
to survive amidst such constant phys
ical violence directed against them
and lies told about their religion and
members of it, the grandmother sim
ply replied, "practice."
