## Khadafy: green gospel 
### 
Infrequently does one encounter
such superbly skillful writing as was
displayed by Tom Killion in his recent
letter (Daily, Nov. 16). Unfortunately,
many people may have been misled
as to the true intent of his letter, due
to the remarkable subtlety of the
sarcasm he employed. If the follow
ing (a portion of a recent interview of
Libyan Col. Moammar Khadafy by
Oriana Fallaci for Italy's L'Espresso
magazine) had been included in his
letter, readers probably would not
draw the wrong conclusion:
"Khadafy is not normal ... he is,
clinically speaking, afool. Nota men
tal case with a streak of genius, but a
cretin, a poor thing whose in
telligence does not surpass that of a
chicken. When I interviewed him in
January 1980, I did not succeed in ex
tracting a single reasonable sentence
out of him: he replied with outbursts
of stupid laughter and cited idiocies
from his little green book, and twice
he had such a fit that his case should
be studied at a psychiatric con
ference. The first came when he re
alized that I was taking notes with a
green pen. Since he simply adores
the color green, and even uses green
handkerchiefs to wipe his nose, he
started shouting excitedly, "Green,
green, green, green, green."
The other time came when, in or
der to explain to me that he was a
new Mohammed, a new messiah, he
repeated, "I am the gospel, I am the
gospel, I am the gospel, I am the

gospel," for about six minutes
without stopping, without catching
his breath so that even his personal
secretary was gripped with terror."
"If you add to his folly his exhibi
tionism and the megalomania of a
new Mussolini of the Mediterranean,
I don't see why one should be sur
prised to see him ordering two jet
fighters against the Sixth Fleet.
Khadafv's boasts must not be
analyzed from a rational or political
viewpoint. He is a man who, if he had
the H-bomb, would explode it with
the same ease with which I am light
ing a cigaret."
When Killion stated at the begin
ning of his letter that he would "set
the record straight" regarding
Khadafy, and then proceeded to
ramble on about 20th century
African history, neglecting to ever
cite a single instance that would re
fute the widely-held contention that
Khadafv is "the most dangerous man
on earth," he was not, I am sure, en
gaging in deception or sophistry;
rather, he was utilizing a literary de
vice to emphasize the lunacy
Khadafy embodies. In short, his writ
ing, like Khadafy's boasts, must not
be analyzed from a rational or politi
cal viewpoint.
Killion should be recognized by
the Stanford community for the
brilliant satirist he obviously is.
