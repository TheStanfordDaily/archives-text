## Behind the blue and gold at Big Game 
### 
The annual conflict begins in September, ripens
through the football season and culminates in the
third week of November. The boyfriend goes to
Cal; the girlfriend to Stanford, and no relationship
is safe under the pressure of Big Game rivalry.
After years of facing each other in our respective
rooting sections, my boyfriend and I decided to be
mature and arrange to sit together at this, our last
football game as students. We were able to make
money from selling my Stanford ticket and buying
a Cal ticket (that shows you how much loyalty
those dirty Golden Bears have; they'll sell out for
less than 10 bucks), so I made the sacrifice and
played traitor, an experience that opened my eyes
to the depraved character of the Cal weenies.
The day began innocently enough; my
boyfriend and three other Cal couples arrived at
my house at 9:30, clad in their tacky blue and gold,
ready to crash the Stanford tailgaters. As we
prowled around the stadium, my Cal friends
peevishly commented on the quantities of
Merceries bearing Stanford stickers. Meanwhile,
Cal alumni huddled against the rain in their Pintos.
Out of necessity, I had dressed incognito, for fear
of how the barbaric weenies would react to a Stan

ford sweatshirt. My sex, I knew, would not protect
me from the primitive chant of "Take off that red
shirt." Unfortunately, I was thus mistaken for a
dreaded weenie during the pre-game festivities, a
humiliation beyond words. I had worn, as the
boldest gesture I could dare, red and white argyle
socks, which I exposed at every safe opportunity.
Upon entrance to the stadium my friends were
amazed at the ease with which we brought in our
beer. Apparently at Cal all students are frisked
before entrance. Clearly Cal officials are aware of
the danger of allowing Cal students unlimited ac
cess to intoxicating substances. Their caution is
well-founded if the Cal rooters' irresponsible ex
ploiting of this unaccustomed freedom this Satur
day was indication of their usual behavior.
Weenie loyalty was no less responsible. How
fervently they insisted upon the superiority of the
blue and gold, yet when Stanford so gloriously
made their first touchdown within the first two
minutes of gametime, my neighbors began berat
ing the Cal defense mercilessly!
The same defense which 10 minutes ago had
been"The bear's great advantage!" Throughout
Cal's few stumbling drives my friends claimed even

thev could pass better than "that idiot Torchio" —
surh words would never pass the lips of a Stanford
student about Elway. And when Cal made its first
feeble score, a neighbor remarked, "He actually
caught one!" The private sentiments of rooters
who claim such solidarity are indeed shocking.
I suppressed by glee as Stanford scored time af
ter time and I witnessed the continued de
baucherie and faithlessness of the Cal rooters.
Their behavior at halftime toward the LSJUMB —
behavior of bitter, jealous, drunken oafs who had
already given up all hope of victory, or even re
spectability — was despicable as usual. They are
free to prefer their constipated wind-up tin sol
diers to the creative expression of the Stanford
Band, but the violent fruit-throwing is simple im
maturity, although somehow not surprising con
sidering the weenie mentality.
Paring the walk home, my Cal friends moped
and glowered, making useless vows for revenge
next vear. All I knew is that next year I'll be back in
the Stanford rooter section — in the triumphant
sea of red and white — where both I and the Axe
belong.
