# Kennedy, Atkin to evaluate education
## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
University President Donald Ken
nedy <ind J. Myron Atkin, dean of the
School of Education, will lead a major
three-vear studv of educational poli
cy, curriculum, teacher preparation
and standards, Kennedy announced
last Monday in a speech to the
Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching.
The study will consist of several
panels designed to investigate specif
ic areas of education.
Atkin said he didn't know the
amount of funding the study will re
quire or exactly where the money
will come from. But he said he antici
pated that primary sources will be
corporations and private donors. He
said since the project is still in the
"active planning stage," the mem
bers and subjects of the panels are
still to be determined.
Kennedy said although "each
study panel will have a strongly
analytical orientation . . . we hope
and expect to tackle some very spe
cific problems: the viability of the
'comprehensive school' as it has
evolved over the recent past, and the
role of schools of education like ours
in teacher education, for example."
Senior faculty members from the
School of Education, other University
scholars and representatives from
nearby school districts will be in
volved. "We will exploit existing rela
tionships with Bay Area school dis
tricts, because we regard the schools

as the critical external constituency
for our recommendations," said
Kennedy.
Kennedy said the study "will try to
retain a focus on both an internal and
an external objective: first, to guide
the school through a reconsideration
and redesign of its programs; and
second, to make recommendations
to state and other school agencies
about curriculum and other school
policies."
According to the idea for
the study originated with several
members of the School of Education
faculty and developed fully after re
ceiving "warm support" from Ken
nedy and local public school repre
sentatives.
The Stanford Dailv first heard of
tho planned study early in October,
but Kennedy, Atkin and Education
Profs. Michael Kirst and David Tvack
declined to comment on the project
at the time.
Atkin said he was reluctant to talk
about the study earlier because he
hadn't discussed it with some mem
bers of the education faculty.
"There's nothing that someone on
the inside likes less than to have peo
ple on the outside hear about it first,"
he said. Atkin added that the project
had just "crystallized" in the last
month, and the Carnegie Foundation
speech provided an "appropriate
time" for the announcement.
Kirst said faculty members would
not talk to the Daily earlier because
thev were waiting for Kennedy's an
nouncement. "He (Kennedy)
wanted to play a major role. He
wanted to lead it, and we thought he
should announce it,"he said.
Atkin said Kennedy's announce
ment of the study at the Carnegie
Foundation colloquium was in
tended to alert other educators to
the University's dedication to solving
the problems of secondary educa
tion. "He thought it was an ap
propriate time to say that Stanford
Wants to devote its intellectual re
sources to addressing the problems
of pre-college education," said
Atkin.
