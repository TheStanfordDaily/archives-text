## Playing the holiday roommate shuffle 
### 
Washington — Some friends of
ours are making the same old loony
preparations for the holidays this
year.
With parents expected for turkey
and stuffing, many are destroying ev
idence that they live, unmarried,
with their lovers.
There's more, however, to erasing
the manifestations of "shacking up"
than removing an extra toothbrush.
Some culprits have been planning
their "evacuations" for months.
Every cohabiting couple's first
priority is to haul the queen-si/e bed
into basement storage, replacing it
with the more modest twin-size
model purchased by the woman's
father.
The next step is for one partner to
move back into his or her real apart
ment several blocks away, ferrying a
dresser, some records and two extra
pairs of shoes along.
Whoever remains behind agrees to
forward the mail, throw out the extra
vogurt and alert the other's friends
against calling during the weekend.
As silly as this routine sounds, the

element of secrecy is a common part
of cohabitation today. It's really no
secret to friends, co-workers and
brothers and sisters. Everyone seems
to know who lives where but Mom
and Dad — and Uncle Sam.
According to the U.S. Census Bu
reau, almost 3.2 million unmarried
Americans admitted to sharing quar
ters with their sweethearts in 1980, up
from about 1 million in 1970. Some
demographers, however, concede
this is a vast and unavoidable under
count. The number of Americans
who live together but keep that fact
quiet for Mama's sake probably ap
proaches 10 million, or about 8 per
cent of the nation's households.
George Masnick of the Harvard-
MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies in
Boston said, "A lot of people are liv
ing together but also maintaining
separate apartments. People appear
to be living apart where they are
often living together."
On one hand, it's easy to see why.
In 19 states, laws proscribe, as this
one does, "any man and woman, not
being married to each other, who

shall lewdly and lasciviously cohabit
and associate together." Michigan's
maximum penalty for convicted
cohabitators is four years (no fine);
South Carolina's is one year, and a
$500 fine.
But a recent issue of the Wisconsin
Law Review reports that such laws are
selectively enforced — if ever. It says
most criminal prosecutions arise out
of neighbors' complaints or the sus
picion of welfare abuse.
While archaic laws can be in
timidating, many people perform the
holiday shuffle because neither they
nor their parents are willing to con
sider cohabitation realistically.
Many parents skew the issue of the
day, contending that cohabitation is
fine for other folks — but not their
kids. Young cohabitators who worry
about disappointing their elders only
reinforce this double standard. Rath
er than admit to being wayward, they
play hide and seek at harvest time.
Oddly enough, each side wants the
same thing: marital bliss and grand
children. It's how one goes about it
that causes conflict.

While the informal nature of
cohabitation doesn't force couples
into the lifelong commitment essen
tial to a successful marriage, it cer
tainly allows them to test their love
through good times and bad. With
today's high divorce rates, many
couples have obviously been walking
to the altar wearing blindfolds; and
it's a legacy our contemporaries
don't want to inherit.
Unfortunately, the pressures
placed on cohabitators by parents as
well as themselves often ruin the ex
periment before it has a chance to
succeed.
No holiday should be cause for
such a headache. But among the mil
lions of cohabitors, someone will be
inviting their parents for turkey din
ner under false pretenses. It's those
hours with the family that make "liv
ing differently" particularly painful.

Washington — Some friends of
ours are making the same old loony
preparations for the holidays this
year.
With parents expected for turkey
and stuffing, many are destroying ev
idence that they live, unmarried,
with their lovers.
There's more, however, to erasing
the manifestations of "shacking up"
than removing an extra toothbrush.
Some culprits have been planning
their "evacuations" for months.
Every cohabiting couple's first
priority is to haul the queen-si/e bed
into basement storage, replacing it
with the more modest twin-size
model purchased by the woman's
father.
The next step is for one partner to
move back into his or her real apart
ment several blocks away, ferrying a
dresser, some records and two extra
pairs of shoes along.
Whoever remains behind agrees to
forward the mail, throw out the extra
vogurt and alert the other's friends
against calling during the weekend.
As silly as this routine sounds, the

element of secrecy is a common part
of cohabitation today. It's really no
secret to friends, co-workers and
brothers and sisters. Everyone seems
to know who lives where but Mom
and Dad — and Uncle Sam.
According to the U.S. Census Bu
reau, almost 3.2 million unmarried
Americans admitted to sharing quar
ters with their sweethearts in 1980, up
from about 1 million in 1970. Some
demographers, however, concede
this is a vast and unavoidable under
count. The number of Americans
who live together but keep that fact
quiet for Mama's sake probably ap
proaches 10 million, or about 8 per
cent of the nation's households.
George Masnick of the Harvard-
MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies in
Boston said, "A lot of people are liv
ing together but also maintaining
separate apartments. People appear
to be living apart where they are
often living together."
On one hand, it's easy to see why.
In 19 states, laws proscribe, as this
one does, "any man and woman, not
being married to each other, who

shall lewdly and lasciviously cohabit
and associate together." Michigan's
maximum penalty for convicted
cohabitators is four years (no fine);
South Carolina's is one year, and a
$500 fine.
But a recent issue of the Wisconsin
Law Review reports that such laws are
selectively enforced — if ever. It says
most criminal prosecutions arise out
of neighbors' complaints or the sus
picion of welfare abuse.
While archaic laws can be in
timidating, many people perform the
holiday shuffle because neither they
nor their parents are willing to con
sider cohabitation realistically.
Many parents skew the issue of the
day, contending that cohabitation is
fine for other folks — but not their
kids. Young cohabitators who worry
about disappointing their elders only
reinforce this double standard. Rath
er than admit to being wayward, they
play hide and seek at harvest time.
Oddly enough, each side wants the
same thing: marital bliss and grand
children. It's how one goes about it
that causes conflict.

While the informal nature of
cohabitation doesn't force couples
into the lifelong commitment essen
tial to a successful marriage, it cer
tainly allows them to test their love
through good times and bad. With
today's high divorce rates, many
couples have obviously been walking
to the altar wearing blindfolds; and
it's a legacy our contemporaries
don't want to inherit.
Unfortunately, the pressures
placed on cohabitators by parents as
well as themselves often ruin the ex
periment before it has a chance to
succeed.
No holiday should be cause for
such a headache. But among the mil
lions of cohabitors, someone will be

ner under false pretenses. It's those
hours with the family that make "liv
ing differently" particularly painful.
