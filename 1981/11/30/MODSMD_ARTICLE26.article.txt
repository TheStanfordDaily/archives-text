Trenton, N.J. â€” Four weeks after an election
that was too close to call, the state Board of Can
vassers meets tomorrow to certify a winner in a
bitter, rlosely fought race for New Jersey gov
ernor.
Republican Thomas Kean, former Assembly
speaker and the candidate backed by President
Ronald Reagan, gathered 1677 votes more than
Democratic opponent James Florio in initial un
official results.
Florio, who ran on a platform asking for voters
to send a negative message to the White House,
requested a recount after calling the margin of
.07 percent for 2.29 million votes "statistically
non-existent." With 95 percent of the votes re
tabulated, Kean has picked up about IU(J votes
since the recount beean Nov. 18.

A state elections panel, headed by retired Su
preme Court Justice Mark Sullivan, ruled last
week that the five-member, bi-partisan Can
vassers Board should certify the original county
vote totals.
I)emocrats have collected a dozen affidavits in
which urban voters claim they were intimidated
on election day by members of the National
Ballot Security Task Force, a group of poll work
ers paid by the Republican National Committee.
The task force posted poll-watchers in Essex,
Mercer, Atlantic and Camden counties. Com
plaints surfaced that some GOP workers wore
arm-bands, toted guns and scared minorities
away from voting booths.
GOP state Chairman Philip Kaltenbacher has
labeled the charges a "smokescreen."
