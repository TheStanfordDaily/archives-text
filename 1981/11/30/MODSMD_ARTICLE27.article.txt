# Reagan isn't 'imperial,' but is he all there?
## 
### Washington Post 
Santa Barbara — After 10
months in office, President
Ronald Reagan shows no sign
of succumbing to the tempta
tions of the imperial presiden
cy.
More than any other recent
president, Reagan likes to tell a
joke at his own expense and he
even turns aside with good hu
mor criticisms that go to the
core of his presidential style.
How closely Reagan follows
daily developments, how en
gaged he is in the process of
governing, and how he arrives
at decisions remainsoften mys
terious to outsiders late in the
first vear of Reagan's presiden
cy.
The president is well aware
of — and reportedly not
pleased by — the trickle of
articles that describe him as
somewhat disengaged from
the business of the nation, but
his public response is the joke,
not the retort.
A recent example came in
Reagan's ABC interview taped
Tuesday. Reagan had just flown
to California after ordering a
temporary halt to non-essen
tial government work during
Monday's budget confronta
tion with the Congress.
He made a joke when asked
whether he had classified
himself an essential worker.
"No one told me whether I was
or not," the president replied.
"I sat there in the office just in
case somebody tried to take it
over."
While Reagan's approach is
far removed from the imperial
manner of a president who in
vokes his authority at every
moment and reacts sharply to

.ill perceived slights, his style
does c reate some puzzlement.
At times the president is
clearly very well informed. In a
March interview, for example,
he answered without hesita
tion questions on African poli
cy that were far from the fore
front of his concerns at the mo
ment.
On other occasions, Reagan
leaves the impression that he
has only a ha/y understanding
of a complicated issue.
On Oct. 2, for example, the
president appeared in the
White House East Room with
Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger to announce his
decision on deployment of the
MX missile and construction of
the B-1 bomber. Reagan
agreed to answer a few ques
tions before turning the micro
phone over to Weinberger, but
he appeared distinctly uncom
fortable and unprepared.
Some of his news conference
performances have been relax
ed and impressive. Others have
stirred a new round of ques
tions about how closely he is in
touch with events.
In his initial round of meet
ings with foreign leaders, Rea
gan has clone better than some
critics suggested he would. He
has had many more successes
than problems.
Weinberger said recently
that every foreign bead of state
has come away from a first
meeting with Reagan very im
pressed and holding "a revised
opinion of Reagan's strength as
a leader." The score may not be
quite so perfect, but the presi
dent has served his policy
purposes well in most of his
top-level encounters.

One part of the Reagan
puzzle is that he often is show
cased dealing with the lighter
side* of his life as president.
Last week, for example, he
gave two interviews, both
heavily devoted to his life on
his mountaintop ranch here.
When he talked with a New
York Times reporter, the
ground rules were that only
questions about the ranch
c ould be asked.
With ARC's Barbara Walters,
he took questions on some ma
jor issues, but the bulk of the
hour-long program was on the
ranch and Reagan's personal
life, including his relations with
his parents and children.
Presidential counselor Edwin
Meese, chief of staff James
Baker and Weinberger were
making themselves available
for television interviews about
the budget showdown with
Congress and forthcoming
weapons talks with the Soviets
while Reagan gave his lighter
interviews.
The contrast was underlined
when Walters asked what had
been the toughest decision of
his presidency and he replied,
"It could have been the veto
the other night."
It would be interesting to
hear the president explain why
he considers that confronta
tion, which he called "a game
of chicken," a harder decision
than his budget cutting de
cisions, the decision to sell
AWACS aircraft to Saudi Ara
bia, deployment of the MX
missile, or his message to the
Soviets on arms reduction in
Europe.
The decision-making pro
cedure in the Reagan White

House adds to outsiders'
puzzlement over the presi
dent's role.
In essence, Reagan is pre
sented with options, both in
writing and orally from his ad
visers and Cabinet members.
Me considers the written pa
pers and listens to the oral
arguments, but rarelv makes a
decision on the spot. Instead,
the president's advisers an
nounce that an issue is ready
for ,i presidential decision, but
that the president wants more
time to reflect.
At the moment, natural gas
deregulation is in such a state
of suspended action. In this as
with other issues, the delay oc
casioned by Reagan's some
limes prolonged private con
siderations appears to out
siders to be mostly a means of
seeing a politically propitious
timing for a decision.
On questions that have
reached this stage, the presi
dent can announce a decision
at any time even though days
or weeks may have passed
since the issue was last de
scribed as being on a front
burner.
While the president's day
to-day role is sometimes un
clear, there are some impor
tant decisions on which Rea
gan acts from strong convic
tions and takes a leading role.
In a tough choice between
lowering the budget deficit
and cutting the rate of increase
in defense spending, Reagan
came down strongly last Au
gust on the side of a large de
fense buildup. He did not want
to trim his defense plans and he
stood firm.
