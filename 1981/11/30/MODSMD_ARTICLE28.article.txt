# Analysts calling for market boom

New York — Given the poor per
formance of stock prices through most of
1981, as well as the recession now spread
ing through the economy, Wall Street
forecasters are in a surprisingly upbeat
mood as yearend approaches.
One respected investment advisor re
cently described himself as "super bull
ish." Another service proclaimed, "Don't
delay an instant — become fully invested."
Still another concluded, "Patience is im
portant, but the upside potential appears
explosive."
Market Logic, a Fort Lauderdale, Florida,
investment advisory service, says 63 per
cent of the forecasters it monitors are now
optimistic about the stock-market out
look.
For anyone basing his opinion on near
term prospects for the economy, there
seems little basis for such enthusiasm.
"The economy's downhill slide is pick
ing up momentum," analysts at the Value
Line Investment Survey observed.

"Industrial production is skidding; the
auto business remains a disaster area;
housing starts hit a 15-year low last month
and (Jo not yet appear to have bottomed;
weak consumer spending points to a dis
appointing Christmas for the retail trade.

For the moment, stock
traders seem willing to
shrug off such news in
their preoccupation with
falling interest rates.

"Swelling inventories at a time of weak
demand are a clear sign that the economy
faces further downward pressure before
business activity begins to revive some
time next year," a report said.
Almost no one disputes that this all adds
up to bad news for corporate earnings
prospects.

For the moment, however, stock traders
seem willing to shrug off such news in their
preoccupation with falling interest rates.
The drop in rates that began quietly at
the end of the summer and started picking
up speed about a month ago continued in
the past week, and the stock market staged
.1 brisk Thanksgiving rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 33.01 to 885.94, reaching its
highest levels in almost three months.
The effects of the decline in interest
rates have shown up dramatically in a wide
range of investment and savings vehicles.
Prices of long-term government and cor
porate bonds, which move in the opposite
direction from interest rates, have soared
15 percent to 20 percent since late Octo
ber.
Since such securities as bonds and mon
ey-fund shares are regarded as direct com
petitors with stocks for investors' capital, a
sharp decline in interest rates theoretically
makes stocks more attractive.
