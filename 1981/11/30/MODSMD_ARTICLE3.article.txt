# New Law dean Ely looks to Stanford
## 
### Heather Millar 
It is too early to predict what
changes lohn Hart Ely will implement
upon assuming His position in July as
the Law School's ninth dean, accord
ing to both Ely and University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy. Kennedy
made the appointment last week.
"I don't know enough about Stan
ford to be talking about specific
changes," Ely explained.
However, Ely said he plans to re
view and perhaps modify teaching
methods which he said he feels are
often "routine." Although there are

three female law professors here, a
comparatively high number for a ma
jor law school, Ely said he sees more,,
of a need to attract minorities and
women to the Law School faculty.
At Harvard Law School, where he is
now the Ralph S. Tyler professor of
constitutional law, Ely was instumen
tal in adding several women to the
faculty when he served on the ap
pointments committee.
"One of the things that attracted us
to him is the fact that he didn't come
here with a set program," said Prof.
Barbara Babcock, one of Ely's Vale
University Law School classmates.
"He has a tremendously open mind."
The Law School faculty unani
mously endorsed Ely. "He's a great
catch in the academic world," said
Babcock. "It's a great coup for the
Law School." Ely, who has been de

scribed as "one of the leading con
stitutional scholars of his gener
ation," is the first dean of a major law
school 10 ho selected from outside its
current faculty in more than a dec
ade.
The Law School's small size and re
ceptiveness to new teaching tech
niques set Stanford apart from other
major law schools, Ely said. "I think a
small school is more interesting," he
said. "It's more relaxed and students
are more courageous about what
they sav."
In his constitutional and criminal
law courses at Harvard, Ely said he
encounters a great deal of tension.
"In a class of 170, when you're called
on to recite, it's easy to feel like
you're being grilled in front of a
crowd," Elv said.
Despite the heavy work schedule
the job of a law school dean imposes,
Flv said he plans to continue teaching
one course per quarter. "I want to
keep in touch with the students," he
said. "I don't want to become
isolated."
Flv said he looks forward to a more
informal atmosphere in his classes
here where the student/professor ra
tio is one-fourth that at Harvard.
"The tuition is higher at Stanford,"
he said. "But you get a better educa
tion (if there are fewer students) and
it's more pleasant."
Although Ely said he sees the Law
School as one of the leaders in ex
perimenting with teaching methods,
he said that, in general, "The
teaching of law has not progressed
dramatically in the last half century."
"There's a lot of wasted time in the
second and third years of law
school," Elv said. He added, how
ever, that he doesn't advocate reduc
ing the law degree program to two
vears.
Instead, Elv said he feels that
teaching methods could be updated
and streamlined. He suggested, for
example, teaching "routine" matters
such as wills and rules of evidence,
on a computer. The time saved by
avoiding classroom drill, he said,


John Ely
could he spent in discussion which
would develop analytical and precise
minds, as well as independence.
"If I could do one thing for lawstu
dents," Ely said, "it would be to make
them independent enough to make
decisions for themselves."
Fly said that his scholarly output
will have to be severely cut back. "I
think it was time to take a breather
from scholarship," he said. "The
book I wrote last year (Democracy
and Distrust: A Theory of judicial Re
view) was sort of a culmination. Right
now, there isn't anything I urgently
need to say . .
The move west, away from Wash
ington and the Supreme Court,
doesn't bother Ely; he said he is tired
of eastern winters and the high price
of fuel oil there and looks forward to
coming here. "I like Stanford," he
said. "I feel more at home with the
lifestyle. I feel like I should bethere."
