### Chris Addington 
The team is 31-0 for the sen
son. They are currently riding
on a 34-game winning streak,
the longest in the sport. And,
they have just won their fourth
national title in a space of just
six years. They are testimony to
the fart that a top-name uni
versity can produce ari athletic
squad of truly amazing caliber.
They are the Stanford water
polo team.
lust last night, the Cardinal
wrapped up a perfect season
by defeating theCal-State Long
Beach 49ers in the Belmont
Pla/a Natatorium in the finals,
of the NCAA National Cham
pionship Water Polo tour
nament by a blow-out score of
17-6.
The Cardinal had finished
the regular season with an un
blemished record of 28-0, and a
6-0 mark in Pacific-10 play, and
was seeded first in the presti
gious invitational.
Ironically enough, Stanford's
closest match came at the
hands of the underdog, Brown
University.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti pulled his starters at
halftime in the Saturday morn
ing game, after they had built
up a 6-0 lead. Brown battled
back to 6-5 before Dettamanti
reinserted his starting seven,
who pulled out the win by a
final score of 8-5.
Defeating Brown advanced
Stanford into the semi-finals
against the UC-lrvine Ant
eaters, who had defeated the
Gauchos of Santa Barbara in
their own preliminary round. It
might be noted that UCI" was
one of only two schools to lead
Stanford during a game this
[last season. But this time, it was
not to be.

A CHAMPIONSHIP FOR STANFORD â€” Cardinal water polo coach Dante Dettamanti
and senior stalwart Alan Mouchawar, shown here against Cal last week, had nothing to
worry about despite the intensity in their faces. Stanford embarassed its competition at
the NCAA championships in Lone Beach, claiming the national crown for the fourth time
in six years. Dettamanti's Stanford career record is now 123-11-3.
