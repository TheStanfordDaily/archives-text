### Chris Addington 
The team is 31-0 for the sen
son. They are currently riding
on a 34-game winning streak,
the longest in the sport. And,
they have just won their fourth
national title in a space of just
six years. They are testimony to
the fart that a top-name uni
versity can produce ari athletic
squad of truly amazing caliber.
They are the Stanford water
polo team.
lust last night, the Cardinal
wrapped up a perfect season
by defeating theCal-State Long
Beach 49ers in the Belmont
Pla/a Natatorium in the finals,
of the NCAA National Cham
pionship Water Polo tour
nament by a blow-out score of
17-6.
The Cardinal had finished
the regular season with an un
blemished record of 28-0, and a
6-0 mark in Pacific-10 play, and
was seeded first in the presti
gious invitational.
Ironically enough, Stanford's
closest match came at the
hands of the underdog, Brown
University.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti pulled his starters at
halftime in the Saturday morn
ing game, after they had built
up a 6-0 lead. Brown battled
back to 6-5 before Dettamanti
reinserted his starting seven,
who pulled out the win by a
final score of 8-5.
Defeating Brown advanced
Stanford into the semi-finals
against the UC-lrvine Ant
eaters, who had defeated the
Gauchos of Santa Barbara in
their own preliminary round. It
might be noted that UCI" was
one of only two schools to lead
Stanford during a game this
[last season. But this time, it was
not to be.

A CHAMPIONSHIP FOR STANFORD — Cardinal water polo coach Dante Dettamanti
and senior stalwart Alan Mouchawar, shown here against Cal last week, had nothing to
worry about despite the intensity in their faces. Stanford embarassed its competition at
the NCAA championships in Lone Beach, claiming the national crown for the fourth time
in six years. Dettamanti's Stanford career record is now 123-11-3.
when thev failed to place.
The 49ers reached the cham
pionship name by beating UC-
Berkelev 11-9 in a semi-final
thriller in which thev trailed bv
score of 6-4 at halftime.
Stanford senior Alan
Mouchawar said before the
name began, "If we can just put
pressure on them (Long
Beach), they will fold up early
in the second quarter." And
fold thev did.
Stanford, as usual, jumped to
a quick 2-0 lead on goals by
Bergeson. Senior jody
Campbell got into the action
with .i razzle-dazzle backhand,
and then senior Chris Kelsev
scored on a Campbell assist to
make the score 4-1 at the end

of the period.
Farlv in the second period,
I ong Beach's 6-foot-8 hole-set
Doug Kimble fired one in to
make it 4-2, and then Kelsey
and Kimble traded goals once
again to put the tally at 5-3.
Long Beach still had a chance
if thev could just penetrate and
rive, but this was the day the
world fell apart for the 49ers.
Stanford, displaying one of its
most concentrated scoring at
tacks of the year reeled off sev
en unanswered goals from the
hands of Kelsey, Bergeson and
Cam pbell.
The final quarter saw an
emptying of the Stanford
bench as everyone on the
squad got a peice of the action.
The final scoreboard read Stan

ford 17, Lour Beach 6.
Rounding out the tour
nament standings were Cal
third, UCI fourth, Santa
Barbara fifth, UCLA sixth,
Brown seventh, and Air Force
eigth.
Stanford has been accused of
letting up when the lead has
been established, but not in
this match. Said Dettamanti,
"There are too many seniors
for this team to let up."
And maybe that was the
main reason for Stanford's
awesome margin of victory. Six
seniors played their last game:
Campbell, Mouchawar,
Kelsey, Taylor, goalie Vince
Vanelli, and Brian Felix, and
thev cetainly went out in a
blaze of color.


JAMIF'S DAY — lames Bergeson, one of two Stanford
starters returning to the water polo team next season,
showed that the Cardinal will have a potent offense again
next season with his performance at the national this

weekend. The junior, shown here, was Stanford's leading
scorer in the finals against Long Beach State last night witn
six goals, and accounted for a total of 16 over the course of
the tourney.
