They say 'hey have a new attitude. They
say it's a new beginning. They even call.it a
new (Jay on the Farm,for chrissake. But
whatever it is, they've got something now
they haven't had in four years — a 2-0 rec
ord.
The Stanford men's basketball team
opened its 1981-82 season over the week
end by trouncing both U.S. International
(82-70) and Harvard University (93-70) at
Maples Pavilion. Neither were what you
would call classic basketball matchups but
both proved that Stanford is on the upsw

Sophomore guards Roger Lemons and
Keith Jones carried Stanford in last night's
clash between the colors. Lemons scored a
career high 21 points and Jones flipped in

center John Revelli (who finished with

Lemons shots, the Cardinal pulled even at
20-20 with 7:27 left in the first half.
After a time-out at 24-24, Stanford took

control of the game by unleashing their
fast break — or semi-fast break. As
Cardinal coach Dick Dißiaso said,
"Harvard is one of the few teams we can
run on," and run they did. Whipping off 13
unanswered points (six of which were
scored by jones), Stanford put the game
out of reach by halftime.
The second half, in which the Cardinal
committed 11 of its 14 turnovers, was slop

remained in control and walked away with
the win.

AN UPSTART - Freshman sensation Johnny Rogers (32), shown here tusseling USIU's
Don Robinson (44) Friday night, accounted for 24 of Stanford's 82 points in his debut in
Cardinal colois. The 6-foot-9 forwaid was rated as one of the best long-range shooters at
his position in high school last year, as he averaged 32.4 points and 12 rebounds per
game.
