# Card cagers open with two wins

They say 'hey have a new attitude. They
say it's a new beginning. They even call.it a
new (Jay on the Farm,for chrissake. But
whatever it is, they've got something now
they haven't had in four years — a 2-0 rec
ord.
The Stanford men's basketball team
opened its 1981-82 season over the week
end by trouncing both U.S. International
(82-70) and Harvard University (93-70) at
Maples Pavilion. Neither were what you
would call classic basketball matchups but
both proved that Stanford is on the upsw
ing. All the talk of young talent we've

heard this fall is not just rhetoric.
Sophomore guards Roger Lemons and
Keith Jones carried Stanford in last night's
clash between the colors. Lemons scored a
career high 21 points and Jones flipped in
19 as the Cardinal whipped the Crimson.
The game began rather clumsily for both
teams as Harvard jumped out to a 10-4
lead. A slick reverse lay-up by sophomore
center John Revelli (who finished with
eight points) picked up the Stanford scor
ing though, and aided by three long
Lemons shots, the Cardinal pulled even at
20-20 with 7:27 left in the first half.
After a time-out at 24-24, Stanford took

control of the game by unleashing their
fast break — or semi-fast break. As
Cardinal coach Dick Dißiaso said,
"Harvard is one of the few teams we can
run on," and run they did. Whipping off 13
unanswered points (six of which were
scored by jones), Stanford put the game
out of reach by halftime.
The second half, in which the Cardinal
committed 11 of its 14 turnovers, was slop
pv on both sides of the court but Stanford
remained in control and walked away with
the win.

AN UPSTART - Freshman sensation Johnny Rogers (32), shown here tusseling USIU's
Don Robinson (44) Friday night, accounted for 24 of Stanford's 82 points in his debut in
Cardinal colois. The 6-foot-9 forwaid was rated as one of the best long-range shooters at
his position in high school last year, as he averaged 32.4 points and 12 rebounds per
game.
titude," Dißiaso said aftor the game. "I like
the way we kept it going in the second half.
It's nice to have four players in double fig
ures (Lemons, Jones, senior Brian Welch
and freshman johnny Rogers) and it's nice
to have a concentrated effort to keep
something going. We'll have to wait until
December to see what we are really like
but I think we've benefitted from all three
of our games."
The Stanford-USIU game had few high
lights besides Revelli's career-high marks
in both scoring (27 points) and rebounding
(16). Take that back — Rogers' per
formance of 24 points and seven rebounds
in his opening game ranks as a bright spot

too.
But otherwise, the game came and went
without much impact. There was no sea
son-opening hoopla, the gym was cold,
one of the scoreboards wasn't working
and what crowd there was sat quietly until
the second half as if it was still digesting its
collective Thanksgiving dinner. Stanford
did win the game with a 20-point surge in
the last six minutes of play but even that
wasn't too unusual considering t Fie
Cardinal has won four-of-six season open
ers since Dißiaso has been here.
The Harvard game was refreshing in
comparison as the crowd came alive and
reassured us that there still is support for
Stanford basketball.

USIIJ, a small school hailing from San Di
ego, is comprised mostly of players from
New York City. Fast, sometimes slick but
mostly sloppy, they looked like the play
ground had never been too far away. Led
l)v guards Charlie Smith (a senior with 18
points) and Nigel Lloyd (a junior with 12
points) the Gulls kept the game close-until
the last quarter mostly by taking advantage
of Stanford's 26 turnovers.
rhe Cardinal presented its own brand of
sloppiness stemming primarily from a slow
team trying to keep up with a fast one. Had
the Gulls made more than 35 percent of*
their shots in the game, it could have been
a different story entirely.

ANOTHER YOUNG 'UN — Sophomore Roger Lemons, shown here against USIU, is one
of Ihree underclassmen starting this year for the Cardinal. The 6-5 guard posted a career
high 21 points and had four rebounds as Stanford romped over the Harvard Crimson
93-70 last night at Maples Pavilion.
