San Francisco (AP) — The San
Francisco 49ers, two years after
a 2-14 season, have become the
National Football League's first

division champions of 1981.
"I know how it feels to be
down, but time passes quickly
and I've learned to forget those

bad times" said Dwight Hicks,
the defensive back who joined
the team in 1979 and made the
first big play in vesterday'stitle
, clinching 17-10 victory over the
New York Giants.
"I never thought I'd see the
day when the crowd at
Candlestick Park would be cel
ebrating a championship," said
tackle Keith Fahnhorst, an
eight-year veteran.
Several thousand fans spilled
onto the muddy field after the
49ers had won for the ninth
time in the last 10 games to
make their record 10-3, which
clinched the National Con
ference West title.
Hicks set up the game's first
touchdown with a 54-vard in
terception return and the 49ers
went on to win the defensive
battle.
"We came up with enough
turnovers to keep things going
in our favor," concluded Hicks.
"I don't recall us making one
big play on defense," said New
York Coach Ray Perkins, whose
defense ranks among the NFL's
best. "They made them and we
didn't, and that was the dif
ference."
The 49ers have had only one
other winning season, 1976
when they went 8-6, since win
ning their last division title in
1972. With one more victory,
