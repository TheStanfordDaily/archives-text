Entitlement programs to be cut
Washington — Treasury Secretary Doriald Regan and Sen
ate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M)
said yesterday that federal welfare, pension and medical pro
grams will have to be curtailed to reduce the mammoth
budget deficits anticipated in fiscal 1983 and 1984.
In separate television interviews, they said the politically
sensitive "entitlement programs" such as pensions and food
stamp assistance, which provide federal payments to tens of
millions of individuals, are growing faster than the rate of in
flation, and the formulas by which they are calculated will
have to be revised downward.
Regan, appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week with David
Brinkley," was resolutely optimistic that the current re
cession will end and the economy will surge back to healthy
growth by mid-1982. The recession is at its worst in the cur
rent quarter, he said, and the economy "will be coming
back" by late summer, with a real annual growth rate of pos
siblv 5' 2 or 6 percent.
But even so, he said, the fiscal 1983 budget that President
Ronald Reagan will submit to Congress in Jandary will proba
bly project a deficit in the "$6O billion to $75 billion range,"
which means "we are going to have to get into the entitle
ments sooner or later."
Basic Social Security payments should not be touched at
least until a presidential commission finishes a study of the
benefits, Regan said, but "we have to look at Medicaid, we
have to look at pensions, we have to look at the cost-of-living
indexes and what has been going on."
Regan acknowledged that it would be difficult to persuade
Congress to accept major changes in the social welfare pro
grams. He argued, however, that opinion pollsshow popular
support for federal budget cuts, and therefore "if people
want to get elected I should think they would want to do
what the electorate wants them to do which is to cut this fed
eral budget even deeper."
Domenici, on NBC-TV's "Face the Nation," said it would
be necessary to reduce the growth in the payments programs
— not the level of benefits, but the amount bv which they are
escalating under current formulas — as part of a plan to re
duce the budget deficit.
Unlikj* Regan, he did not exclude basic Social Security
benefits from his projections. The system is "in trouble,"
Domenici said, and "unless we want to increase the taxes
enormously we are going to build the reserves. To build the
reserves you're going to have to cut back on the growth . . .
there is no way out."
Syrian school area hit by bombing
Damascus, Syria — A car packed with explosives blew up in
a school neighborhood yesterday, its blast ripping away walls
of apartment buildings and sending shards of glass and
debris through the crowded block. The government news
agency SANA said 64 people were dead and 135 wounded,
many of them children.
Many victims were burned and appeared to have severe
injuries following the blast, which gutted at least four four
storv apartment houses and shattered windows over a wide
area, a Damascus television newsfilm showed later.
Rescuers commandeered private cars and trucks to rush
victims to hospitals from the Azbakivah district where the ex
plosives went off, witnesses reported. Most victims appeared
to be civilians.
A military recruiting center was also in the neighborhood
but witnesses said it did not appear to be a target of the
bombers. Youngsters were crowded into classrooms of the
school, which held regular classes. Sunday is not a day of rest
in this predominantly Moslem nation.
"This is a very crowded area, in which one has to walk
shoulder to shoulder with people passing by," said a Damas
cus resident who saw the neighborhood after the blast,
before it was sealed off.
Actress Natalie Wood drowns
Santa Catalina Island, Calif. — The body of actress Natalie
Wood, a dark-eyed beauty who starred in such films as West
Side Story and Gypsy, was found floating yesterday in the
ocean off Catalina Island, sheriff's deputies said.
The 43-year-old actress, an apparent drowning victim, was

found at 8 a.m. near an inflatable boat 200 yards from shore
after a seven-hour search by the Harbor Patrol and life
guards, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies.
"She went out in the boat by herself and slipped off or fell
off or jumped off. She was found floating just beneath the
surface next to the boat," said Lt. Gary Crum of the Los An
geles County Lifeguard Service.
Wood, on location for a new film, had apparently gone
ashore with friends to visit the Isthmus Cove area near the
northwest end of the island, officials said.
Harbor director Doug Bombard said the group dined
ashore and Wood apparently returned to the boat owned by
her husband, actor Robert Wagner, aboard a power-driven
inflatable boat.
Bombard, who pulled her body from the waters of Blue
Cavern Point, said no other injuries were apparent and the
boat was not damaged.
"As to what happened, it all really speculative at this
point," Bombard said. "The motor may have failed and she
drifted, or she could have gone off course. We don't really
know."
Wood had been nominated for Academy Awards for her
roles in 1955's Rebel Without a Cause, 1961's Splendor in the
Grass and 1963's Love With the Proper Stranger.
Smith urges courts to use caution
Washington — Attorney General William French Smith
savs he believes the federal courts may be jeopardizing their
own independence and prestige by overstepping their
hounds in certain cases and outlined a Reagan adminis
tration campaign to curb judicial activism.
But he protested that the administration is not engaging in
anv "attack" on the court or lending its this time to
congressional efforts to strip the federal court's of the author
ity to rule on controversial social issues.
In fact, he maintained, it is not the administration that is
threatening the judiciary. The threat comes from the courts
themselves, as a result of their controversial decisions.
The courts"get into the political arena and by being in the
political arena, they subject themselves to Jhe same kind of
to-do that the political branches are subjected to ... I think
their independence and prestige is greatly enhanced when
the courts through their own restraint stay within their in
stitutional roles," he said.
Smith, in an interview with The Washington Post, de
fended a controversial speech he deliverdti Oct. 29 in which
he said the federal courts have gone beyond their proper
role in cases involving abortion, school busing, prisoners'
rights and other socially sensitive areas which they should
have left to elected officials.
The speech was heavily criticized by'some, in part because
it was interpreted as a call for the courts to reflect the conser
vative results of the 1980 election.
"We certainly did not say the Supreme Court should fol
low the election returns . . . what we are saying is that we are
following the election returns," Smith said. "The president
has enunciated this judicial philosophy ever since he's been
running for office ... As you may have noted, this president
has a way of meaning what he says...and what we're doing
is implementing one of his principal programs."
Smith did say the administration would attempt to reign in
"judicial activism" through the judicial appointment process
and through the legal arguments the department will make
in major cases.
Israel signs cooperation treaty
Jerusalem — With Prime Minister Menachem Begin pre
siding from his hospital bed, the Israeli Cabinet agreed yes
terday to send Defense Minister Ariel Sharon to Washington
to conclude and sign a strategic cooperation agreement with
the United States.
Almost up to the minute of the cabinet's action, some Is
raeli sources had suggested that the government might de
cide that the version of the pact offered by the United States
was too limited to be worth anything.
Although Sharon's trip has been scheduled for weeks,
there was a possibility that he might have called it off up until
the ministers voted. Sharon left for Washington shortly after
the cabinet meeting.

Israel made no secret of its preference for a much deeper
relationship than Washington was prepared to offer. In ef
fect, lerusalem wanted equal status in its alliance with the
United States to members of the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization.
But the cabinet finally decided to take what it could get. It
instructed Sharon to sign the memorandum of under
standing after making a last-minute effort to broaden the
agreement in his talks with Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger.
Israel radio reported that the cabinet was informed that
the United States was willing to make some additional con
cessions in the Weinberger-Sharon talks.
Israel had planned to veto European participation because
the four nations linked their agreement to join with a re
assertion of the European Common Market peace formula
that calls for direct negotiations between Israel and the
Palestine Liberation Organization. Israel has flatly rejected
the Common Market's "Venice declaration."
Habib shuttling to Middle East
Beirut, Lebanon — U.S. envoy Philip Habib met with a
rightist militia leader yesterday in his first round of talks on a
resumed mission to calm tensions over Syrian missiles in
southern Lebanon and shore up a fragile cease-fire pact he
helped arrange between Israel and the Palestinians.
Habib refused to speak with reporters at Beirut airport af
ter his arrival, but a U.S. Embassy source said Habib would be
meeting wiih several Lebanese officials "and will address the
peaceful foundations from previous visits."
Habib, greeted by U.S. ambassador to Beirut Robert
Dillon, was whisked away in a limousine in a motorcade of
escort cars with automatic weapons protruding from both
sides. He met with right-wing Christian miltia leader Beshir
Gemayel, but neither the U.S. Embassy nor Voice of Lebanon
radio commented on the content of the discussions.
Habib was expected to meet with Lebanese President Elias
Sarkis after visiting Israel tomorrow or Wednesday, accord
ing to the independe it daily An-Nahar. A source in Leba
non's Foreign Ministry confirmed the newspaper's report.
Sarkis currently is in Europe for a medical checkup. Habib
also is expected to visit Saudi Arabia and Syria.
In ]ulv, with the help of Saudi Arabia and the United Na
tions, Habib negotiated a cease-fire between Israel and the
Palestinian Liberation Organization after several weeks of Is
raeli air attacks on PLO positions in southern Lebanon and
Beirut. Israel said the raids were retaliation for guerrilla at
tacks in northern Israel.
Scholastic strike in Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Leaders of 100,000 striking students
called a meeting yesterday to discuss their tactics and an ap
peal for Solidarity's support. A spate of worker protests con
tinued, despite new warnings expected to be taken by Par
liament this week.
The National Commission of the Independent Students
Association, coordinators of the biggest student protest in
the Soviet bloc, was asking the independent labor federation
to persuade its member employees at the schools to go on
strike, spokesmen said.
The student strike started Oct. 20 over academic reforms
and the election of a Radom college headmaster. But ob
servers said the students may decide to go back to 71 of Po
land's 91 colleges and universities for lectures under some
kind of declaration that they are still protesting.
Farmers, firefighter cadets and oil field workers continued
ongoing strikes yesterday, a day after the Communist Party's
200-mernber Central Committee urged the party majority in
the Sejm, or parliament, to arm the government with new,
tough powers to crackdown on "all destructive actions."
The Central Committee's resolution said the powers were
needed to curb actions that could "destroy the country and
its economy, and threaten the socialist state, law and order
and public security."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair and cool through tomorrow. Lows in the upper
20s and 30s with a light freeze in outlying areas. Highs in the
upper 50s to mid 60s. Light winds.
