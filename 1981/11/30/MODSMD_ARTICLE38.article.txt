Money
Reporters and photographers (i.e.,
non-salaried staffers) who have not
filled out their contract cards but
nevertheless want to be paid — even
though money and the Daily are
mutually exclusive — should sign a
card by tomorrow at noon. See Vic.
Be prepared to beg.
Grill session
In this scene of The Daily Con
tinues Through the Centuries, the
Three Musketeers take on the
ephemeral write-in candidate in
mortal combat for top management
control. Something along the lines of
a death wish. Seriously, all staff mem
bers who want to know how the can
didates hope to shape the paper in
the coming volume — or who just
want to ask that stumper question —
should be at the staff lunch tomor
row at noon. Pick up platforms today.
Board of Directors
Nominations for (he Board of Di
rectors are due at noon tomorrow.
Satisfied, editor in chief (who shall
remain nameless)?
