# Kennedy assesses education policy
## 
### 
Provident Donald Kennedy's
speech presented to the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement
of Teaching announced the study
of educational policy (discussed
above) and provided Kennedy's
assessment of the current concfi
tions confronting universities. In
the speech, entitled "Advancing
Knowledge," Kennedy evaluated
the state of the sciences, the hu
manities and arts, and the social
sciences before discussing the
role of educational policy in
fostering research. What follows
are excerpts from the speech.
Kennedy on the state of the hu
manities:
"For more than a decade, we
have been hearing reports of the
death of the humanities, and calls
for their resurrection. The former
are premature; the latter might
better be aimed at repair, and re
balancing. The flood of support
for science left the humanities ov
ertaken, and nearly overrun. At
the high-water mark there was
some trickling down of beneficial
effects, and the birth of the En
dowments was also a source of
help."
On research associated with
profit:
"If members of the public come
to conclude that positive claims

about academic research are like
ly to be connected to the making
of money, they are eventually
going to discount them. And even
if basic science can survive such
suspicions, can it tolerate the loss
of openness ami trust that is likely
to accompany a rush to pro
prietary control?" (
On concentration of artistic
centers:
"I do not know what other parts
of society care to do about this
concentration mania, which I
view as the ultimate triumph of
collection over creation. But the
universities can help a little by
providing more places in which
the highest and best expressions
of culture can interact with the
finest capacity for criticism and in
terpretation."
University responses to the con
centration of the arts:
"That will demand a greater
willingness to appoint people
who lack some of the conven
tional academic credentials, and
also to cope with the difficult task
of blending them with the more
conventional academic sector.
We also need to try to create new,
special campus centers of human
istic scholarship and teaching.
Most of all, we will need firm in
sistence by university leaders that

the values of the humanities are
important, even when the rest of
the society seems to be saying that
they are not."
On the relation of social science
research to politics:
"Of course social science re
search has always had the special
problem that its outcomes tend to
be evaluated in light of political
preferences. But I do not know of
any way in which we can shield
policy research from political vul
nerability. To the extent that its
outcomes constitute recommen
dations for the design of society,

they .ire hound to be political, and
bound to be attacked bv those
who do not like them."
On priority of educational poli
cy:
"At Hn nartirr time *'~*â€¢ presi
dents of inajor universities
( (James) Conant of Harvard was
the most recent example) made
educational policy a central con
cern. There is little evidence of
that kind of concern today, and it
is hardly surprising that even the
best schools of education some
times feel like prophets without
honor in their own countries."
