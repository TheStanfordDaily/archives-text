# NSC adviser Richard Allen takes leave
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Richard Allen,
White House national security ad
viser, announced yesterday that he i$
taking an administrative leave of
absence from his job until the Justice
Department completes its investiga
tion of his receiving $1000 from
Japanese journalists who had in
terviewed First Lady Nancy Reagan.
Allen, who was affiliated with the
Hoover Institution here before join
ing the Reagan administration and
becoming head of the National Se
curity Council (NSC), conceded in a
nationally televised appearance that
he had exercised "bad judgment" —

but had done nothing illegal — in the
affair, which has made him a center
of controversy for the past two
weeks.
But he maintained later in a
lengthy interview with The Washing
ton Post that he eventually would be
vindicated and back on the job be
cause "it was only a one-time bad
judgment."
In his interview with The Post, Al
len provided new details concerning
the arrangements for the Reagan in
terview and his other contacts with
his longstanding friends from
Japanese industry.
Allen said his involvement in the
interview began on Dec. 7, 1980, the
}9th anniversary of the bombing of
Pearl Harbor. At that time he re
ceived a telephone call from Tokyo
from his longtime friend, Tamotsu
Takase, a Japanese business consul
tant, during which he was asked to
arrange the interview.
Takase had called to ask Allen to
make arrangements for himself, his
wife and others to receive invitations
and tickets to the Reagan inaugura
tion, Allen said. During the conversa
tion Takase "asked if his wife could
conduct an interview (with Nancy
Reagan) for a housewives' maga
zine," according to Allen.
There was never any mention of
monev in that conversation or any
subsequent conversation, Allen said.
Mien also said that although he lat
er met three or four times with

Takase at the White House, he never
discussed business matters in those
conversations. He specifically re
pudiated quotes that Takase re
portedly passed on to Japanese ex
ecutives as business advice from Al
len. Takase had made the remarks in
a speech in Japan after returning
from a White House meeting he and
an official of the Toyota auto com
pany had with Allen.
"That's Takase talking and not me
talking," said Allen. "I don't recall
ever saving that to Takase."
Mien also acknowledged that he
had lunch twice in the White House
with Yasuhiko Suzuki, Washington
vice president for Nissan U.S.A., the
Datsun marketing company that kept
Allen on an annual retainer before
Allen assumed his White House job.
But Mien said those lunches were
"purely social" and that no business
was discussed.
Allen has been criticized within
the White House inner circle not
onlv for receiving the $1000 and then
failing to turn it over to authorities,
but for his contacts, while in the
White House, with his friends from
the time he served as a consultant to
several Japanese businesses.
There had been published reports
th.it presidential chief of staff James
Maker, deputy chief of staff Michael
Deaver and the first laHv believed Al
len should be replaced as national se
curity adviser for having exercised
bad judgment.

Only White House Counselor
Edwin Meese, among the president's
top advisers, was reportedly urging
that Allen remain in his post while
the lustice Department continues its
inquiry to see whether a special pros
ecutor should he appointed to fully
investigate the case.
According to a White House
spokesman, Mien telephoned
Meese Saturday to tell him that he
had decided to request adminis
trative leave until the matter is fully
investigated, and Meese then tele
phoned the president at his ranch in
Santa Barbara to relay the message.
At 8:19 p.m. PST, Allen telephoned
the president and formally informed
him of his decision. Asked if Allen
will return to his job if he is vin
dicated by the Justice Department in
quiry, Deputy Press Secretary Larry
Speakes responded that he has "no
reason to think otherwise."
For now, Allen's duties will be as
sumed by his deputy, James Nance, a
retired admiral. Previously, Nance
served as an aide to Secretary of State
Alexander \laig when Haig was com
mander of the NATO forces.
Allen announced his decision on
NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" after
agreeing to appear only the day
before.
"The interest in this case has de
veloped to an extent where great
pressures have been brought to bear
on the White House," Allen said on
the show.

served as an aide to Secretary of State
Alexander \laig when Haig was com
mander of the NATO forces.
Allen announced his decision on
NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" after
agreeing to appear only the day
before.
"The interest in this case has de
veloped to an extent where great
pressures have been brought to bear
on the White House," Allen said on
the show.
Washington — Richard Allen,
White House national security ad
viser, announced yesterday that he i$
taking an administrative leave of
absence from his job until the Justice
Department completes its investiga
tion of his receiving $1000 from
Japanese journalists who had in
terviewed First Lady Nancy Reagan.
Allen, who was affiliated with the
Hoover Institution here before join
ing the Reagan administration and
becoming head of the National Se
curity Council (NSC), conceded in a
nationally televised appearance that
he had exercised "bad judgment" —

but had done nothing illegal — in the
affair, which has made him a center
of controversy for the past two
weeks.
But he maintained later in a
lengthy interview with The Washing
ton Post that he eventually would be
vindicated and back on the job be
cause "it was only a one-time bad
judgment."
In his interview with The Post, Al
len provided new details concerning
the arrangements for the Reagan in
terview and his other contacts with
his longstanding friends from
Japanese industry.
Allen said his involvement in the
interview began on Dec. 7, 1980, the
}9th anniversary of the bombing of
Pearl Harbor. At that time he re
ceived a telephone call from Tokyo
from his longtime friend, Tamotsu
Takase, a Japanese business consul
tant, during which he was asked to
arrange the interview.
Takase had called to ask Allen to
make arrangements for himself, his
wife and others to receive invitations
and tickets to the Reagan inaugura
tion, Allen said. During the conversa
tion Takase "asked if his wife could
conduct an interview (with Nancy
Reagan) for a housewives' maga
zine," according to Allen.
There was never any mention of
monev in that conversation or any
subsequent conversation, Allen said.
Mien also said that although he lat
er met three or four times with

Takase at the White House, he never
discussed business matters in those
conversations. He specifically re
pudiated quotes that Takase re
portedly passed on to Japanese ex
ecutives as business advice from Al
len. Takase had made the remarks in
a speech in Japan after returning
from a White House meeting he and
an official of the Toyota auto com
pany had with Allen.
"That's Takase talking and not me
talking," said Allen. "I don't recall
ever saving that to Takase."
Mien also acknowledged that he
had lunch twice in the White House
with Yasuhiko Suzuki, Washington
vice president for Nissan U.S.A., the
Datsun marketing company that kept
Allen on an annual retainer before
Allen assumed his White House job.
But Mien said those lunches were
"purely social" and that no business
was discussed.
Allen has been criticized within
the White House inner circle not
onlv for receiving the $1000 and then
failing to turn it over to authorities,
but for his contacts, while in the
White House, with his friends from
the time he served as a consultant to
several Japanese businesses.
There had been published reports
th.it presidential chief of staff James
Maker, deputy chief of staff Michael
Deaver and the first laHv believed Al
len should be replaced as national se
curity adviser for having exercised
bad judgment.

Only White House Counselor
Edwin Meese, among the president's
top advisers, was reportedly urging
that Allen remain in his post while
the lustice Department continues its
inquiry to see whether a special pros
ecutor should he appointed to fully
investigate the case.
According to a White House
spokesman, Mien telephoned
Meese Saturday to tell him that he
had decided to request adminis
trative leave until the matter is fully
investigated, and Meese then tele
phoned the president at his ranch in
Santa Barbara to relay the message.
At 8:19 p.m. PST, Allen telephoned
the president and formally informed
him of his decision. Asked if Allen
will return to his job if he is vin
dicated by the Justice Department in
quiry, Deputy Press Secretary Larry
Speakes responded that he has "no
reason to think otherwise."
For now, Allen's duties will be as
sumed by his deputy, James Nance, a
retired admiral. Previously, Nance
served as an aide to Secretary of State
Alexander \laig when Haig was com
mander of the NATO forces.
