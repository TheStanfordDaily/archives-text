## U.S., Soviets vie for West European support as arms talks open today 
### Washington Post 
Bonn, West Germany —
President Ronald Reagan's re
cent "program for peace"
speech and Soviet President
Leonid Bre/hnev's visit here
last week have dramatized a
psychological battle for Eu
ropean public opinion that
promises to he very much a
part of U.S. and Soviet tactics
surrounding the arms-reduc
tion talks that begin today in
Geneva, Switzerland.
What makes the new U.S.-
Soviet talks different from the
low-profile strategic-arms ne
gotiations of years past is
Western Europe's ex
traordinary interest and in
direct role in the process — a
fact that each superpower is
now trying to turn to its own
advantage.
For the United States, the
fact that its medium-range nu
clear missiles on the bargaining
table in Geneva are planned
for deployment in Europe has
made necessary a campaign for
continued European support
of its position.
But the Reagan adminis

tration, adjusting to office this
vear and believing deeply in its
own rearmament mission, was
slow to compromise with
Western European demands.
The Soviet Union thus gained
the propaganda advantage ear-
Iv without much trouble, Late-
Iv, Washington seems to have
c aught up.
The Europeans have not
been a passive audience in the
drama. West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt has
fashioned for himself a role as
what he calls "interpreter" be
tween the main East-West
players.
"We are the ones mainly
concerned" about the nego
tiations, declared Bonn gov
ernment spokesman Kurt
Becker last week, adding,
"either as the target of Soviet
rockets or the place where the
U.S. deloyment will take
place."
Schmidt's agreement with
Bre/hnev on West German-So
viet consultations that will par
allel the U.S.-Soviet talks in Ge
neva would appear to add a
new diplomatic dimension to

nuclear weapons negotiations,
which up to now were strictly a
bilateral affair.
The Bonn leader is accoun
table to his Social Democratic
Party and the West German
electorate, where there is sub
stantial opposition to plans —
previously agreed upon by
NATO governments — to
deploy U.S. Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles in Western Eu
rope. This gives added signifi
cance' to American and Soviet
attempts to sway Western Eu
rope, particularly West Germa
nv.
In targeting European opin
ion, the United States and the
Soviet I Inion have drawn on an
arsenal of verbal weapons, all
intended to stress the nuclear
threat to Europe posed by one
or the other superpower, de
pending on which side is talk
ing.
America's intention in the
debate is to keep the message
simple by focusing on Soviet
land-based, medium-range
rockets, for which the United
States has no equivalent de
terrent in Europe.

Moscow's interest is in com
plicating the issue by pointing
to a broad range of other U.S.
nuclear forces in Europe and
demanding that thev be in
cluded in negotiations. This ap
proach tends to run U.S. and
Soviet weapons systems and
nuclear-force ratios into a con

fused muddle, which suits the
Soviet .tim of drawing attention
from the single category of
land-based systems.
Throughout the vear, Mos
cow has conducted campaigns
of one sort or another on the
peace issue — against the neu
tron weapon, against the con
cent of limited nuclear war, in

favor ot nuclear-free zones. All
have found some resonance in
Western Europe, especially
against the background of
bellicose American pronoun
cements.
The Soviets have sought to
portray themselves as part of
Europe and thus genuinely

concerned for the fate of the
continent in a wav the Ameri
cans, located an ocean away,
are said not to he.
The Soviet arms develop
ment — replacing single-war
head SS-4 and SS-5 rockets with
triple-warhead, more accurate
SS-20s — is described bv Mos
cow officials as routine mod
ernization that will not alter
what the Soviets sav is a rough
balance of East-West nuclear
forces in Europe. In contrast,
the Soviets argue, the new U.S.
missiles would seriously
change the strategic balance.

U.S. officials say in response
ih.it the Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles are necessary to offset
the sS-20 threat.
Both the Soviets and the
Americans are reaching for a
psychological wrench that will
cither loosen or tighten the
holts of the Western Alliance.
Initially, the Reagan adminis
tration, while well aware that
the pro-detente mood in Eu
rope was out of st.-p with an
anti-Soyiet pro-rearmament
mood in America that helped
to it, assumed the Western Eu
ropeans could eventually be
brought around by lots of pep
talk.
But the Western Europeans
were not following the plan of
the Reagan administration, and
the Soviets saw it early. Rea
gan's harsh anti-Soviet
rhetoric, his administration's
Cold War posturing over Fl
Salvador, its big defense
budget and lark of interest in
early arms-control nego
tiations, all unsettled Western
Europe.
In response, the Soviets
launched a peace initiative at
their 26th Communist Party
congress in late February,
when Brezhnev suggested a
summit meeting with the new
U.S. president in an effort to re
store "norm.il relations."

Brezhnev's speech also con
tained calls for renewed arms
control efforts, including a
proposal for a freeze on
deployment of more SS-20
rockets targeted on Western
Europe, providing the Ameri
cans would cancel their own
deployment plans.
Schmidt and other Western
European officials, meanwhile,
urged the Reagan adminis
tration to return to the nego
tiating table with the Soviets as
soon as possible.
In May at an alliance min
isterial meeting in Rome, Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig
disclosed to his European col
leagues a plan for engaging the
Soviets in talks: first through
high-level diplomatic contacts
that, by the end of 1981, would
lead to the opening of formal
negotiations.
Yet, Western Europeans con
tinued to doubt Washington's
serious interest in negotiating.
In )ulv, at the summit meeting
of Western leaders in Ottawa,
Reagan reassured Schmidt of
his commitment to talks. But in
August, the Reagan adminstra
tion's announcement that it
had decided to produce and
stockpile neutron weapons
(ast Reagan's sincerity into
doubt in Western Europe.

ernization that will not alter
what the Soviets sav is a rough
balance of East-West nuclear
forces in Europe. In contrast,
the Soviets argue, the new U.S.
missiles would seriously
change the strategic balance.

U.S. officials say in response
ih.it the Pershing 2 and cruise
missiles are necessary to offset
the sS-20 threat.
Both the Soviets and the
Americans are reaching for a
psychological wrench that will
cither loosen or tighten the
holts of the Western Alliance.
Initially, the Reagan adminis
tration, while well aware that
the pro-detente mood in Eu
rope was out of st.-p with an
anti-Soyiet pro-rearmament
mood in America that helped
to it, assumed the Western Eu
ropeans could eventually be
brought around by lots of pep
talk.
But the Western Europeans
were not following the plan of
the Reagan administration, and
the Soviets saw it early. Rea
gan's harsh anti-Soviet
rhetoric, his administration's
Cold War posturing over Fl
Salvador, its big defense
budget and lark of interest in
early arms-control nego
tiations, all unsettled Western
Europe.
In response, the Soviets
launched a peace initiative at
their 26th Communist Party
congress in late February,
when Brezhnev suggested a
summit meeting with the new
U.S. president in an effort to re
store "norm.il relations."

Brezhnev's speech also con
tained calls for renewed arms
control efforts, including a
proposal for a freeze on
deployment of more SS-20
rockets targeted on Western
Europe, providing the Ameri
cans would cancel their own
deployment plans.
Schmidt and other Western
European officials, meanwhile,
urged the Reagan adminis
tration to return to the nego
tiating table with the Soviets as
soon as possible.
In May at an alliance min
isterial meeting in Rome, Sec
retary of State Alexander Haig
disclosed to his European col
leagues a plan for engaging the
Soviets in talks: first through
high-level diplomatic contacts
that, by the end of 1981, would
lead to the opening of formal
negotiations.
Yet, Western Europeans con
tinued to doubt Washington's
serious interest in negotiating.
In )ulv, at the summit meeting
of Western leaders in Ottawa,
Reagan reassured Schmidt of
his commitment to talks. But in

Bonn, West Germany —
President Ronald Reagan's re
cent "program for peace"
speech and Soviet President
Leonid Bre/hnev's visit here
last week have dramatized a
psychological battle for Eu
ropean public opinion that
promises to he very much a
part of U.S. and Soviet tactics
surrounding the arms-reduc
tion talks that begin today in
Geneva, Switzerland.
What makes the new U.S.-
Soviet talks different from the
low-profile strategic-arms ne
gotiations of years past is
Western Europe's ex
traordinary interest and in
direct role in the process — a
fact that each superpower is
now trying to turn to its own
advantage.
For the United States, the
fact that its medium-range nu
clear missiles on the bargaining
table in Geneva are planned
for deployment in Europe has
made necessary a campaign for
continued European support
of its position.
But the Reagan adminis

tration, adjusting to office this
vear and believing deeply in its
own rearmament mission, was
slow to compromise with
Western European demands.
The Soviet Union thus gained
the propaganda advantage ear-
Iv without much trouble, Late-
Iv, Washington seems to have
c aught up.
The Europeans have not
been a passive audience in the
drama. West German Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt has
fashioned for himself a role as
what he calls "interpreter" be
tween the main East-West
players.
"We are the ones mainly
concerned" about the nego
tiations, declared Bonn gov
ernment spokesman Kurt
Becker last week, adding,
"either as the target of Soviet
rockets or the place where the
U.S. deloyment will take
place."
Schmidt's agreement with
Bre/hnev on West German-So
viet consultations that will par
allel the U.S.-Soviet talks in Ge
neva would appear to add a
new diplomatic dimension to

nuclear weapons negotiations,
which up to now were strictly a
bilateral affair.
The Bonn leader is accoun
table to his Social Democratic
Party and the West German
electorate, where there is sub
stantial opposition to plans —
previously agreed upon by
NATO governments — to
deploy U.S. Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles in Western Eu
rope. This gives added signifi
cance' to American and Soviet
attempts to sway Western Eu
rope, particularly West Germa
nv.
In targeting European opin
ion, the United States and the
Soviet I Inion have drawn on an
arsenal of verbal weapons, all
intended to stress the nuclear
threat to Europe posed by one
or the other superpower, de
pending on which side is talk

America's intention in the
debate is to keep the message
simple by focusing on Soviet
land-based, medium-range
rockets, for which the United
States has no equivalent de
terrent in Europe.

Moscow's interest is in com
plicating the issue by pointing
to a broad range of other U.S.
nuclear forces in Europe and
demanding that thev be in
cluded in negotiations. This ap
proach tends to run U.S. and

Throughout the vear, Mos
