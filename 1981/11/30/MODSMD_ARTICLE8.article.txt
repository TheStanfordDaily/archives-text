## Stanford's radio KZSU emerges from a year-long 'facelift' 
### Curtis Gruenler 
According to Simon and Garfunkel, "They say that it's
all happening at the zoo." Quite a bit /'s happening at The
Zoo, Stanford's own student-run, 500-watt radio station
KZSU. On the heelsof a year-long reorganization, the
students at KZSU are reaching for a number of new goals.
KZSU station manager Michael Eldredge described
the general aims of the station as "putting together a
coherententertainment formatand interspersing
information-type things like news and sports and some
moreeducational and esoteric things."
In accordance with this philosophy, KZSU emphasizes
music of various kinds along with news, sports, and
public affairs programs.
KZSU is the product of a staff of about 80 students and
a handful of non-student engineers, who join The Zoo
for a variety of (different reasons.
"I like radio," said assistant programming director
Max Ball. "I want toget into it in the real worldand I'm
getting a lot of good basictraining here."
Ball is in the minority, though; only 10 percent of the
students at KZSU are interested in a career in
broadcasting.
"I'm not pre-radio,"said musicdirector Jim Mooney.
"Mv first reason was to give myself a little escape from
the Stanford world."
But Mooney said he appreciates experience he has
gained as musicdirector, which involvestalking to
record companies and other commercial organizations.

'Certain people are really into
music. You listen to the radio and
come down here to play the best
music ever played on radio. When
the novelty of that wears off,
you're just down here to play
music and do it differently than
everyone else/
— Paul Salazar, promotions
director at KZSU

"If you're trying to run a group professionally, you have
to learn how to deal with the real world,"he said.
The music is the main attraction for most students."l
originally came down here to play music," said Eldredge.
Promotions Director Paul Salazaradded, "Certain
people are really into music. You listen to the radio and
come down here to play the best music ever played on
radio. When the novelty of that wears off, you're just
down here to play music and do it differently than
everyone else."
On the other hand, judging by their titles, all of these
students found themselves involved in more than simply

plaving music. "I swore when I came down here that I'd
never get intothe management," said station manager
Eldredge, jokingthat"the things I've gotten intosince
have been more a function of being in the right place at
the wrong time."
The management at KZSU is committed to making it
enjoyable for both listenersand staff, he said. "We want
people to be able to come down here and have some
fun. There's an incredible amount of work that goes into
running a smooth, professional radiostation in which
people can do that."
Part of thiscommittment to professionalism has been a
year-long reorganization with the dual aim of setting up
both a permanent organizational heirarchy and a
comprehensive training program for new staff members.
Among the many reasons for the reorganization was a
history of management and conduct problems within
the station. Following an incident in the summer of 1980
in which a student announcer was assaulted inthe
station, the University disallowed all non-student
personnel from wording at KZSU without special
permission, and also reduced the operating hours of the
station.
The reorganization period began with a two-week
shutdown and reevaluation last autumn and ended
symbolically with the station's return to a continuous 24
hours of broadcasting on Oct. 3.
The centerpiece of the new organizational structure
will be a board of directors to provide continuity from
vear to vear. The board of directors, which is in the
throes of creation at present, will consist of half faculty
members from various departments and half students, all
serving two-year terms. It will also provide a link with the
Stanford Board of Trustees, which holds the station's
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license.
The training program isalready in full gear and is
meant to provide rigorous training for prospective staff
members that is applicable both within KZSU and at
"roal world" radiostations. Open to all interested
students, the program lasts one quarter and gives
opportunities for a weekly show and work in any of the
station's departments.
News at KZSU is primarily a publicservice, according
to news di rector Kelly Moran. KZSU istheonlyradio
station that delivers local Palo Alto area and Stanford
news. The news broadcastsat 5,6 and 10 p.m. Monday
through Friday and 1 p.m. Sunday are done by a separate
news staff with the responsibility of gathering the news
first-hand or off theUPI wire and delivering it on the air.
Sports broadcasts are also the task of a separate staff at
KZSU. This vear they provided live coverage of all
Stanford football games and will cover basketball and
other selected sportsas well.
l ocal public affairs broadcasts are an important part of
KZSU,since it isa non-commercial, educational radio
station. It broadcasts advertisements for various student
organizationsas well as public affairs programming,
including Palo Alto City Council meetings on Monday
nights, 11 a.m. services at Memorial Church Sunday

mornings and Campus Conference interviews with
various faculty members and administrators.
KZSU also broadcasts local election coverage, short
storv readings, and certain lecture series, such as guest
professor John Anderson's lectures last spring.
The primary emphasis at KZSU, however, is music. In
this department, said Eldredge, KZSU's greatest
advantage is also its greatest drawback."What most
people want in a radiostation is consistency, so that they
can tune in at 8 every morning and get the same thing."
At KZSU, on the other hand, each disc jockey has a
four-hour show once a week. During a show a D.J. can
play anything he wishes, with the moderate restriction
that during the show he play at least 10 cuts from the file

of the latest 200 or so albums the station has received.
The result of this"free-form radio" strategy isa great
variety of music: about 70 percent rock, 20 percent jazz,
and special shows of classical, Christian rock, and Latin
music on Sundays. D.J.'schoose musicfroma libraryof
more than B,oooalbums, which includes an extensive
collection of rock music second in the Bay Area only to
thp Bay 'Xrea Music Archives. DJ's also receive several
hundred requests in a day.
New this year is the Music Meal, Monday through
Thursday from 5 toB p.m. The Music Meal comprisesan
hour of music by a singJe artist following the news at 5
p.m., an hour of music based on some theme after the
news at 6 p.m. and an hourof public affairs programming
beginning at 7 p.m.
