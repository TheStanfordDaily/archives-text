The first little pig, desiring quick,
easy shelter, built his house of straw.
The second pig, working only slightly
more, used sticks to construct his
home. When the wolf came around
for dinner, he found these pigs and
their flimsy houses to be pushovers.

labored long and hard to erect a solid
structure of stone. His efforts pro
vided him with not only shelter, but
protection from the ravenous wolf.
In fact, he ended up with wolf stew

Consumers are like pigs in one way
or another, and the economy in
which the consumers operate is con
tinually threatened by bear markets,
similar to wolves. Unfortunately, too
many consumers think like the first
two little pigs. Prosperity for them
must come quickly and easily, and lit
tle thought is given to the long-run
setbacks caused by economic short
cuts.
The consequence of this is that
most political leaders champion
quick-fix policies designed to pro
vide their constituents with prosper
ity as fast as possible. This short-run
mentality, reflected in the policies of
past decades, has led directly to to
day's economic malaise. At present,
the push for instantaneous economic
relief comes from both Democratic
and Republican congressional lead
ers, and comparison with President
Ronald Reagan's long-range ap
proach puts these flimsy economic
edifices in true perspective.
The first little pig in our economic
drama is the Democratic Party. The
Democratic solution to economic
troubles is to promote rapid growth
in the proportional size of govern
ment as a means of stimulating de
mand. The result of such stimulation
is a quick boost in output, leading to
greater employment of labor and
larger supplies of goods and services,
at least in the short run.
further short-run effect, though,
is inflation. Rapidly rising prices en
courage a "spend now" psychology
which reduces the amount saved by
individuals. In the long run this
shrinks the pool of resources avail
able for investment in new plant,
equipment and technology, since in
vestment can only come from that
which the economy has saved.
Further, government growth has
the direct effect of shifting resources
from the private sector to the public
sector. Increased taxation must re

duce the incentive to work, save and
invest, because workers and busi
nesses have to turn over a larger
share of their earnings and returns to
government. Public borrowing
shrinks the pool of fundsavailable for
private investment. Money-printing
leads to more inflation and instabili
ty, further discouraging saving and
investment.
Whichever way it is financed, then,
government growth must discourage
investment in the capital shock. This
capital stock is used bv workers to
produce the goods and services en
joyed bv everyone. Thus the short
run benefits of demand stimulation
bear the long-run cost of a decrease
in our nation's ability to produce
goods and services, as well as provide
productive jobs to workers.
Two decades of these policies, au
thored largely hv Democrats, have
left the nation's capital stock in a

new investment in capital did not
oven make up for physical depreci

demand stimulation have clearly
brought us to the present situation,
where high inflation and slow growth
in output represent our chief prob

government growth strategy (in addi

creases in the midst of a recession, as
economics-major Reagan has
pointed out).
Of course, the most short-term,
opportunistic and stupidly narrow
minded policies of all are the spend

shortest possible horizon, in their
pork-barrel spending schemes. The
political dynamics of this vote
buving make it nearly impossible to
bring government growth under
control, to which the recent revel
ations of budget director David
Stockman attest.
The quick-fix and pork-barrel poli
cies of both parties' congressional
leaders stand in sharp contrast to the
long-run focus of Reagan's program,
which seeks to stimulate investment
through tax and regulatory reforms
while advocating a reasonably tight
monetary policy to hold inflation in
check. Critics of the Reagan plan, es
pecially candidate-at-large Walter
Mondale, display theirown econom
ic myopia by pronouncng the pro

program has scarcely taken effect! In

to which their own economic pro
posals are directed, these critics have
presented us with political hyperbole
at its worst.
The first two little pigs probably
had similar criticisms of their in

pigs, though, we may compare the
quick-fix advocates to the man who
built his house on a foundation of

and swept the house away. Reagan,
building his house on a foundation of
stone, should emerge from the next
storm in much better shape.

Consumers are like pigs in one way
or another, and the economy in
which the consumers operate is con

similar to wolves. Unfortunately, too
many consumers think like the first
two little pigs. Prosperity for them
must come quickly and easily, and lit
tle thought is given to the long-run
setbacks caused by economic short
cuts.
The consequence of this is that
most political leaders champion
quick-fix policies designed to pro
vide their constituents with prosper

mentality, reflected in the policies of
past decades, has led directly to to

the push for instantaneous economic

and Republican congressional lead

Ronald Reagan's long-range ap

edifices in true perspective.
The first little pig in our economic
drama is the Democratic Party. The
Democratic solution to economic
troubles is to promote rapid growth
in the proportional size of govern
ment as a means of stimulating de
mand. The result of such stimulation
is a quick boost in output, leading to
greater employment of labor and
larger supplies of goods and services,
at least in the short run.
further short-run effect, though,
is inflation. Rapidly rising prices en
courage a "spend now" psychology
which reduces the amount saved by
individuals. In the long run this
shrinks the pool of resources avail
able for investment in new plant,
equipment and technology, since in
vestment can only come from that
which the economy has saved.
Further, government growth has
the direct effect of shifting resources
from the private sector to the public
sector. Increased taxation must re

duce the incentive to work, save and
invest, because workers and busi
nesses have to turn over a larger
share of their earnings and returns to
government. Public borrowing
shrinks the pool of fundsavailable for
private investment. Money-printing
leads to more inflation and instabili
ty, further discouraging saving and
investment.
Whichever way it is financed, then,
government growth must discourage
investment in the capital shock. This
capital stock is used bv workers to
produce the goods and services en
joyed bv everyone. Thus the short
run benefits of demand stimulation
bear the long-run cost of a decrease
in our nation's ability to produce
goods and services, as well as provide
productive jobs to workers.
Two decades of these policies, au
thored largely hv Democrats, have

in output represent our chief prob

The quick-fix and pork-barrel poli
cies of both parties' congressional
leaders stand in sharp contrast to the
long-run focus of Reagan's program,
which seeks to stimulate investment
through tax and regulatory reforms
while advocating a reasonably tight
monetary policy to hold inflation in
