# Accusations aren't the first for Allen
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
The current brouhaha over Na
tional Security Adviser Richard Allen
is not the first time the former Hoo
ver fellow has had to face up to con
flict of interest charges.
Allen took a leave of absence from
his post Sunday in response toallega
tions of misconduct stemming from
the $1000 he accepted from a
Japanese magazine interview.
Allen also encountered public
pressure a little over a yearago when
a Wall Street Journal article alleged
that he had used his position to ob
tain consulting contracts for himself
and his friends. As a result, Allen re
signed from the Reagan campaign
five days before the election.
The Journal article stated that Allen
had remained on the government
payroll as a per diem consultant in
1972 while working as a consultant
for the Overseas Corporation of Por
tugal after leaving his post as assistant
national security adviser to Henry
Kissinger. The Overseas Corporation
invested in Angola and Mozam
bique.
The Reagan administration found
no improprieties and named Allen
national security advisor.
While he was a fellow at the Hoo
ver Institution between 1966 and
1968, and afterwards, Allen worked
as a consultant for numerous corpo
rations. His company, Potomac In
ternational, represented the
Japanese firm Nissan, which makes
Datsun automobiles. In 1978, Allen
introduced Datsun head Takashi
Ishihara to Senator Howard Baker (R-

Tenn), House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) and other Con
cessional leaders.
Allen was a successful consultant,
receiving $60,000 from the Overseas
Corporation, $4000 from Tokyo Elec
tric Power between 1974 and 1977,
and $4800 from Lockheed in 1976, for
example. He denied reports that
Datsun paid him $100,000 a year.
Companies found his knowledge of
international security and national
policy issues useful.
Questions arose, however, about
some of Allen's business trans
actions. In mid-1972, Allen acted as a
consultant for Howard Cerney, a law
yer for Robert Vesco, a financier who
was later accused of swindling in
vestors. Allen denied he had any
knowledge of Vesco's illegal deal
ings.
Allen's decision to take a leave of
absence comes after a period of in
house disputes in the Reagan admin
istration. On Nov. 4, before accounts
of the envelope containing $1000 su
rfaced, Secretary of State Alexander
Llaig accused a senior White House
aide of conducting "a guerilla cam
paign to discredit me." A "senior ad
ministration official" predicted that
"Allen's days are numbered."
According to Political Science Prof.
Hubert Marshall, the allegations
against Allen arc worthy of investiga
tion and should not be seen as an ex
cuse to dump the security adviser.
On the other hand, Marshall said he
believes the improprieties Allen is
accused of are not particularly seri
ous. He said that if Allen had criminal

intent he would have hidden the in
criminating envelope from his secre
tary.
The problem of "wheeler-dealers"
who have difficulty separating their
business and government lives is not
confined to the Reagan adminis
tration, Marshall said. He said that
nearly evpry administration since
President Harry Truman's has run
into similar problems.
Bert Lance, for example, resigned
from his post as head of the Office of
Management and Budget in the
Carter administration because of
questions about his financial trans
actions. He was eventually acquitted

of wrongdoing.
Federal law prohibits public of
ficials from accepting expensive gifts.
Allen should have immediately re
ported receiving the envelope,
Marshall said, but he was probably
used to accepting such gifts in his
business as a consultant.
Since Watergate, the public has
become more concerned with ques
tions of conflict of interest. "The pub
lic has a right to demand that its of
ficials be above suspicion," Marshall
said.
Even before Watergate, however,
governments had problems with of
ficials who accept gifts.

absence from his post as national security adviser to President
Ronald Reagan, following reports of mishandling of funds.
