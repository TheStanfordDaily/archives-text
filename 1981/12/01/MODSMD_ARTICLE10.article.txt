						1960s seen through the eyes of the 1980s: Branner Hall looks back

Stanford in the '60s — The Vietnam war
dragged on.
The director of the Stanford Research In
stitute (SRI), which was doing defense-re
lated research, lied to a University commit
tee investigating SRl's activities because he
said tolling the truth would jeopardize na
tional security.
Fewer students were being exempted
from the draft.
Stanford students held demonstrations to
protest the war, civil rights violations, Uni
versity regulations. . .
Stanford in the '80s — Branner Hall, with
the support of the ASSU Speakers Bureau

and Residential Education will sponsor a
series of activities this week titled "Ret
rospect on Revolution" which focuses on
the history and ideas of the '60s.
All the events will be held in the Branner
lounge and are open to the public.
Branner R.A.'s Leo Cunningham and Tom
Saxe organized the program. Cunningham
said he hopes the films, guest speakers, and
discussions will spark campus discussion of
the ideas of the '60s and their relevance to
day.
"Stanford was a turbulent place in the 60's.
It isn't now." said Cunningham. "Were the
goals achieved or were they forgotten?"
Tonight, History Profs. Barton Bernstein
and Clay Carson, and former Stanford Stu

dent Body President David Harris will discuss
"College Activism and the Anti-War Move
ment." A question and answer period will
follow the panel presentation.
Harris said the issues of the '60s become
particularly relevant today in light of draft
registration and American involvement in
the affairs of countries like El Salvador and
Guatemala. Harris added that the legacies of
the '60s are woven into the fabric of Ameri
can culture. "I don't think anyone can un
derstand the United States today without
having a grasp of (what happened in) the
'605," said Harris.
In the late '60s, according to Harris, there
was growing outrage against tightening draft
regulations among Stanford students. Many

students, including Harris, spent time in pris
on for dodging the draft.
There were also disputes concerning the
amount of control students should have over
student organizations, Harris said.
"The focusof the issues seemed more per
sonal at Stanford," said Carson, who was or
ganizing demonstrations at UCLA during the
anti-war movement. "At UCLA, the issues
were larger and more impersonal." How
ever, Carson said it took longer for radical
ism to reach UCLA and Stanford than to
reach UC-Berkeley.
Carson said he considers experimentation
with new lifestyles one of the most important
lessons of the '60s. "I think one of students'
fears is that when you get off that career

track, it means failure. That is one of the
scariest things to a Stanford student — fail
ure," said Carson. "The world does not stop
when you do it (try something radically
new). It's okay to experiment with your life."
"Today, the student body is more
cynical . . . and perhaps more informed than
it was in the '605," said Bernstein.
Tomorrow night a collection of films from
the '60s will be shown. Thursday will feature
another panel discussion on the topic "In
terpreting the Social Revolution."
Last year, Branner sponsored an "Election
Center" program and a debate series.
"We're trying to show that you can do big
educational programs through the resi
dences," said Cunningham.
