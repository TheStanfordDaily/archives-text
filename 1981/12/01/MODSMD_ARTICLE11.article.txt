## Jerry Wertheim Culture ill-defines mystique 
### 
For better or worse, I am a male.
Somehow, I want to apologize for
that. I read the letter "to a Stanford
boy" on this page a week ago and
wanted to apologize to the woman,
to say, "some of us aren't bad, some
of us care." But to do so would be an
insult to myself and, more important
ly, a denial of my biological nature. I
will not apologize for being a man,
nor will I apologize for a rape, an in
cident of incest, a woman subtly
abused. I will not assume the guilt for
other men's activity any more than I
would expect any person to accept
the stereotypes of their race, political
persuasion or hometown.
But my guilt did not spring from
nothing. I see, in the man/boy who
impregnated the letter writer, a part
of myself; not myself, but the male
counterpart to what author Betty
Friedan called "the feminine mys
tique." My culture, and your culture
too, women, has defined my role in
society just as readily as it created the
'barefoot and pregnant' ethic for
females.
To be honest, I find many parts of
the masculine mystique agreeable.
The male role allows rrfe to seek my
fortune and tells me that the pursuit
of happiness is my divinely endowed
right. For men, to be robust is good,
to be intelligent a great blessing. I am
told, because I am male, that with
some effort and talent, the future is
mine.
All that seems palatable enough;
some parts of the mystique prove less
agreeable. The masculine mystique
teaches me to laugh at crude jokes
and to think of myself as a member of
the community of men who chases
coy and ostensibly sexually disin
terested women. It teaches me that
women will accept me only when I
am successful and athletic.
We train our men young, giving
them guns and teaching them that
sport is violent, a microcosm of war.
If our young Nietzsches fail to ex
ercise their will to power, their bet
ter-trained siblings batter them into
introspection and self-degradation.
It's a tough world boy, get mean or
get out.
But why say all this? Every male and

quite a few females on this campus
know that society feeds us a line, that
masculinity is not tied to strength,
that (how many times have you heard
this one) it is all right to cry. I write
this because although we see our fol
ly, that folly still breeds a sense of mi
sogyny in men. A part of me fancies
women as objects, the pretentious
withholders of sex, and dislikes them
for it. Such sentiment scares the hell
out of me and I fight it at every turn.
But again, I cannot deny what was
imbedded in me at an early age.
What I can do is recognize the fallacy
of my subconscious, the inequity of
my subtle training. To do so will re
quire a social concert between men
and women, a collective definition of
sex roles. Friedan, in her new book
The Second Stage, asks for such re
vamping of old norms. As the New
York Times Book Review describes,
her strategy "calls for a joint effort of
men and women to redefine what is
meant by success ... so that the
needs of both sexes for achievement,
intimacy and nuturance can find ade
quate expression."
Intimacy is crucial to the success of
this stage. Rape displays no intimacy,
neither does the man who im
pregnates a woman selfishly nor the
woman who welcomes such ad
vances. I reject my capacity for in
timacy when I allow ingrained opin
ions about women to affect my ac
tions towards them. The woman ac
tivist who gruffly declaims men, al
lowing her bias to surface, alienates
those she so ardently wants to
change. The emotional distance be
tween men and women sends us all
into a danse macabre: eyes closed,
we see nothing but our own preju
dice as we whirl away from the op
posite sex, angry and afraid.
I cannot believe the anti-courtship
dance finally defines men and wom
en together. Men and women, ex
cept perhaps for the mentally ill,
possess the capacity for compassion,
the ability to conquer bias and to love
without submerged pretense. How
insane that when I listen to a Wom
en's Center speaker I feel she does
not know me nor I her, for we are
much the same. Different yes, but

differentiated only by silly precon
ceptions about the other and in
escapable matters of plumbing, pro
creative purpose and hormones.
Still the sexes drift apart. Go to the
"woman's music" section of the
Bookstore; you will see an album
jacket that tells men not to listen to
this feminist music: they cannot un
derstand. Watch the feminist move
ment as it attacks women's traditional
roles with such stridency that many
"moderate women" become dis
enchanted; they cherish the family.
Listen to the Christian Right and you
will hear the words of amoral
hucksters who say they defend "trad
itional values" while attempting to
throw women back into constrictive
roles. The activists, both left and
right, parry and jab while the sexes
remain strangers to each other.
Although men cannot collectively
bear the burden of responsibility for
overt or covert violations of women,
we can declare open season on
abasement of them. Women, activist
women in particular, can stop giving
lip service to the social union of men
and women and start believing in it.
A new feminist mystique, says
Friedan, limits women to the role of
caustic reactors as they press their,
"grievancesagainst men in office and
home, school and field, in marriage,
housework, even sex."
As long as men and women per
ceive each other as enemies the
scalding feminist rhetoric will flow,
the cruel male bias will play havoc
with social relations between the sex
es, women will remain partially op
pressed.
That is the tragedy of division be
tween men and women, the catch in
all our mystiques. By dividing into
sexual armies we perpetuate op
pression and fear. If weare ultimately
distinguishable from the apes it is
through our willful ability to change
our minds and modify our behavior.
Applied, that means thinking of men
and women primarily as humans and
forging a sexual detente.
