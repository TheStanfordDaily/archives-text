## Rely on police for lock-outs 
### 
Per the "upswing" of rape on the
campus, the following events are of
more than passing interest.
Last week, "Rape Week" at Stan
ford so it seemed, I needed to return
to my offices at the Medical Center
and thence to Jordan Hall. I am not a
fearsome person and have braved
both evening walks through the
Quad (alone) as well as NLF
squadrons (Viet Cong) during my
two years in a village at the Vietnam
ese/Cambodian border during the
Vietnam War.
On top of this last toughening up
experience, I also fought off a would
be rapist in Cambridge some years
back (and police were able to catch
him from my description) and I also
successfully apprehended two bur
glars in my Harvard apartment
without resorting to karate or even a
scuffle and again, police arrived in
time and brought these men to trial.
So I guess I would consider myself a
tough cookie.
I'm a runner as well, and within re
cent memory jogged the distances
between ( my offices and Escondido
Village when finishing my disserta

tion demanded late nights and still
later nights at the computer center.
But last week's events began to get
to me and I was forced to be realistic.
I called the SURE escort number on
Friday night and learned that these
laudable volunteers do not offer es
corts on Friday or Saturday nights.
The University operator suggested I
call campus police, but in the eve
nings apparently campus police are
dispatched from the Palo Alto police
department, so I called them.
When I explained that it was neces
sary for me to access both offices and
locate some material, the Palo Alto
police operator told me that they
absolutely would not dispatch any of
the force (campus or local) for the
purpose of an escort!
Well, at this point I was beginning
to tell myself what the hell, it couldn't
be worse than the Mekong Delta in
1972, but the switchboard operator at
Stanford spoke to a colleague who
said he'd be getting off work in a
while and could meet me and escort
me to the Medical Center and to the
Quad. So, I did this and finally ended

up at Jordan later that evening. No
sooner had I taken off my jacket and
gone to the library upstairs than I re
alized that I'd left my office keys (and
bike key, house key) in my jacket
pocket, in my office! Using a campus
hall phone, I called the campus oper
ator and explained the situation.
Again the campus operator told
me to call Palo Alto police to dispatch
someone. I told her that I doubted
that they would, since I had called
them earlier for the other purpose.
This time the operator disgreed,
saying, "For an office lock-out,
they'll be there." And this time she
was right!
What a relief to learn that, after all,
help is available, at least for office
lock-outs. We can sleep secure in the
knowledge that for really serious
problems, the Palo Alto police will be
happy to dispatch campus police.
Now, for the rest of you who don't
know what to do in case of attack,
don't cry wolf, don't cry rape, just cry
"Office Lockout" and help will be on
the way. . . .
