## Stockman slips show up Reaganomics as national travesty 
### 
Kemp-Roth? Nothing more than a
"Trojan horse" designed to make a
generous reduction in the marginal
tax rate for the wealthiest classes
palatable tothe general public. Supp
ly-side economics? Nothing more
than a "bill of goods" peddled by an
opportunistic Arthur Laffer to an
eagerly receptive and unabashedly
slapdash administration. President
Ronald Reagan's Economic Recovery
Act? Approved by Congress on a day
characterized by excessive political
horsetrading, when "the hogs were
really feeding . . . (and) the greed
level.. . just got out of control."
No, these are not the remarks of a
livid New-Dealer Democrat. They are
the candid — albeit careless — ad
missions of the "architect" of Rea
ganomics, David Stockman, as
quoted in the latest issue of The At
lantic Monthly. When an adminis
tration official expresses grave and
fundamental doubts in private about
a program he enthusiastically and
unprovisionally endorses publicly,
then that man's honesty and integrity
justly can be questioned. Stockman's
slips make an economic policy that
the enlightened long ago realized
was a deceitful, tragic charade, into a
national travesty.
Economic indicators paint a bleak
picture of Reagan's record. 3250
more corporations filed for

bankruptcy than at thissame time last
year, an increase of 48 percent. Black
unemployment for October was at
the highest level since the Bureau of
Labor Statistics began collecting sep
arate records for blacks — 16.9 per
cent. Overall, unemployment is at its
highest absolute level in 41 years —
8.5 million Americans are actively
seeking work.
Pundits and politicians alike em
phatically proclaim that Keynes is
dead. Yet as Harvard's Robert Reich
noted recently in an insightful article
in The New Republic, "Reaganomics
is revealing itself as a drastically sim
plified and bastardized version of the
same Keynesian principles that have
dominated economic policy for 35
years."
By believing that the economy will
respond to fine-tuning through the
manipulation of economic ag
gregates, the Reagan administration
succumbs to the temptation to solve
the nation's woes through an out
moded and limited version of Key
nesian economic management. Poli
cymaking needs to be guided by an
equity rule that not only analyzes
which groups in the economy are
going to be hurt by sudden changes
in target variables, but which explicit
ly sets forth which groups — such as
the poor — are to benefit at the ex
pense of other groups — such as the

rich.
Today the top 20 percent of the
population holds over 80 percent of
the nation's wealth. Reaganomics, by
cutting capital gains taxes, reducing
the marginal tax rate for the highest
bracket from 70 percent to 50 per
cent, allowing preferential treatment
of stock options, and slashing essen
tial transfer payment programs,
promises to exacerbate this disparity.
Certainly the Phillips curve has pro
vided us with its predictable trade-off
— lower inflation at the cost of
higher unemployment. But, as Reich
points out, those people "get drafted
into the inflation fight . . . who can
least afford it — young blacks in cen
tral city slums (90 percent of whom
are now unemployed), women . . .
and Hispanics." Inflation may be
lower in the short-run, but the worst
stagflation in the history of the Unit
ed States is bound to strike towards
the middle or end of 1982.
By then, the government deficit —
ballooned by tax cuts, irrational mili
tary expenditures, rising debt servic
ing costs, and skyrocketing transfer
payments to the additional millions
on welfare payrolls — will so saturate
the credit markets that interest rates
and inflation will zoom upward. The
handwriting ison the wall. America is
in for the worst recession since 1929.
There are grievous analytical and

theoretical errors in Reagan's
scheme for economic recovery, apart
from Stockman's brazen confession
of "fudging" the figures. There is al
together too much emphasis on
purely physical capital investment —
such as machinery and structures.
Reagan has never even considered
the crucial linkage between "human
capital" and productivity. Govern
ment expenditures on public educa
tion, nutrition, Medicare, job retrain
ing programs, and food stamps
should not be labeled as "consump
tion" by lazy slobs who won't get off
their duffs to go find a job. Rather,
they should be treated as invest
ments in the future productivity of
"human capital." In fact, these pro
grams are most essential now, be
cause the economy is shifting "from
capital-intensive industries (like au
tos, steel, cement, and fibers) to
newer 'knowledge-intensive' in
dustries (like computers, electronic
instruments, and industrial machin
ery) and to services."
Reich referred to worker as
sistance programs by advocating that
the government concentrate on the
pattern of investment as well as its ov
erall augmentation. Reich asserted
that capital markets do not allocate
resources to their most productive
uses, because they are fettered by
import and export restrictions and

subsidies which are not repealed be
cause they in the short term benefit
domestic industries.
Lester Thurow refers to the same
type of problem in The Zero Sum So
ciety when he calls for a "national in
vestment committee."
Anything approaching such a
"committee," unfortunately, would
be decried as socialism — and the im
poverished and unemployed, for
lack of more innovative leadership in
government, would suffer the conse
quences of inaction.
The deception of the present ad
ministration is unparalleled. Reagan,
by not accepting Stockman's resigna

tion and by casually observing that he
had often been caught off guard by
informal interviews himself, implicit
ly acknowledged that he too has his
doubts about the efficacy of his eco
nomic policy. Poor old Ronnie can
no longer be viewed as a man who,
however inadvisedly, at least believes
forthrightly in his cause. Reagan,
faced with a trickle down in popu
larity as the public becomes aware of
his trickery, should begin to realize
he should have joined Gerald Ford in
retirement in 1977.
