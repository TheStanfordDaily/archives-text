## Awareness rally helped combat rape 
### 
I would like to respond to Richard
Kim's criticism of the "speak-out"
rally. He expressed a desire to "do
something" but protested that rallies
and armbands are useless since they
do not deter rapists. I share his frus
tration about the problem of rape,
but I think he missed the point of the
rally.
First of all, people were offered
many suggestions of things "to do."
Lists were available for people who
wanted information on self-defense
clubs. There were also sign-up sheets
for those interested in joining a run
ning collective, volunteering to be a
SURE escort, or helping with a variety
of projects including a dorm out
reach program, the Rape Education
Project, and self-defense workshops.
Aside from organizing projects,
the rally served the much more im
portant function of education. We
cannot even begin to deal with the
problem of rape until we know what

it is. The speakers, therefore, ad
dressed common misconceptions
about rape and rapists. They also re
minded us that through our behavior
and our attitudes we can each con
tribute to a safer environment.
Armbands and rallies may not de
ter rapists, but they do conjribute to
awareness, and awareness is the best
weapon we have for combatting
rape. Educational efforts like the rally
are aimed at creating an environ
ment in which the act of supporting
each other becomes second nature
rather than a crisis response.

The "Letter to a Stanford boy" (
Daily, Nov. 24) has occasioned much
bitter debate. The anonymous writer
was striking out at the large number
of "boys" who refuse to take respon

sibility for their sexual actions and
treat their partners with respect and
compassion. In response to her re
marks, I have heard many people
argue that ultimately the woman
must carry all the responsibility of
sexual relations, out of biological
need.
It is true that the woman must face
the unpleasant consequences of any
sexual act. It is she who risks preg
nancy, social stigma, and emotional
trauma. What the man risks is expos
ing another human being to this suf
fering. If we are to view ourselves as
caring adults, is it possible to deny
that the man's responsibility is just as
great as the woman's in ensuring the
mutual safety of their lovemaking?

In his letter extolling Libyan die

tator Moammar Khadafy (Daily, Nov.
16) Tom Killion conveniently over
looks the fact that Khadafy has
spawned widespread violence, ter
rorism, and death.
Killion points out, correctly, that
the Libyan people have undergone
enormous suffering in this century.
But to argue that this past suffering
automatically justifies every excess
committed by Khadafy is, in my opin
ion, ridiculous.
Furthermore, if Killion is as con
cerned about "imperialism" as he
seems to be, he might at least have
mentioned Libya's invasion of Chad
and Khadafy's expansionist ambi
tions elsewhere.
