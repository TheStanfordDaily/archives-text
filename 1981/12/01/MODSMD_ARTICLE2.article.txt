# Investigations will decide Allen's fate
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” White House coun
selor Edwin Meese said yesterday
that Richard Allen's return as White
House national security adviser
would be influenced, but not neces
sarily determined, by the Justice De
partment report on his dealings with
Japanese journalists.
Meese also told a group of re
porters that he does not think the Al
len case requires appointment of a
special prosecutor. Under existing
law, that decision is the responsibility
of the attorney general, William
French Smith.
Meese said the current FBI in
vestigation of Allen "will obviously
be a factor" in his fate. Allen re
quested "administrative leave" Sun
day todefend himself against charges
of impropriety in accepting $1000
from a Japanese magazine team that
interviewed Nancy Reagan after the
inauguration last January.
As Allen sped through a morning
to-night round of interviews explain
ing his actions yesterday, Meese said
he would "look at the whole busi
ness," including Allen's dealings with
clients of his former consulting firm
in deciding whether to restore his
White House status.
"I see no reason why he shouldn't"
come back if he is cleared of charges
by the Justice Department, said
Meese, adding that he would make
his own judgment on reinstating Al
len, "subject to concurrence bv the
president."
Meese, Allen's immediate superior
on the White House staff and re

portedly his strongest defender,
walked a narrow line under per
sistent questioning from reporters.
He said it was"appropriate" for Allen
to arrange the interview with Mrs.
Reagan, for him to lunch in the White
House mess with a former business
client from Japan and to receive de
layed payments until this month from
the purchaser of his business-con
sulting firm.
But Meese also left room for a
judgment against reinstating Allen in
his old position, even if he is cleared
of any criminal charges bv the Justice
Department. Meese said the Allen
controversy is "an unfortunate
thing" that "certainly has not been
helpful" to the administration, add
ing that Mien's decision to stepaside,
at least temporarily, "was the right
thing to do."
In recounting his part in last week
end's developments, Meese dis
closed that he had turned over to the
Justice Department some "other
documents" in addition to the $1000
cash in an envelope found in a safe in
an office Allen had used.
Meese would not describe the
"other documents" but said they
were "no big deal." Allen has said the
other papers he was handed by the
Japanese journalists consisted of
copies of the Japanese women's
magazine, photostated copies of the
magazine's previous interviews with
other First Ladies and a one-page
cover sheet explaining in English
about the magazine and the previous
interviews.
