There is a quasi-euphoric feeling you get when
you've just attended a concert where practically ev
erything has gone well. You tend to forget the little,

sometimes annoying, always distracting errors that
can often make or break a marginal performance; in
stead, coming away from the evening with a set of
emotional experiences that leaves you feeling really
good for a few hours as you recall the way this or that
musical moment affected you.
This was just such an evening. For the San Jose Sym
phony, it represented a return to more certain musi
cal ground. For Maestro George Cleve, it meant a
chance to forget his worries about technical matters
and devote his considerable talent to making all the
music musical.
This was immediately apparent in the Couperin
pieces. Given limited but beautiful melodic material
to work with, the orchestra played with clarity and
depth of feeling that left many peop'e smiling at its
end. It was met by applause which could be described
as "warm."
Messiaen's Hymne was a sharp contrast, employing

many unusual dissonances. While it was well played,
and not without emotional significance, it often
seemed dated — sometimes sounding like, with all
due respect, a 40's movie score. It was met ap
plause which could be described as "uncertain."
The Poulenc organ concerto featured two soloists
of note — Carlo Curley, the organist, and the four
manual (keyboard) Allen Computer Organ. This or
gan is so remarkable that it deserves some comment.
It isthe equivalent of a six-thousand pipe organ, using
sixty-seven individual speakers powered by 2600
watts R.M.S. (How'd you like to have that in your ster
eo?) combined with a microprocessor system that
faithfully duplicates all of the characteristics of a pipe

organ.
The music was as remarkable as the featured instru
ment. A huge opening chord set a serene orchestra
into a struggle for sanity with a maniacal, unpredic
table organ. Just when it seemed as if the orchestra
had succeeded in calming the unrestrained instru
ment, it was subverted and corrupted by the beast,
being carried off into a world of evil fantasies. The
tympani entered, beating the crazed instruments into
a remorseful, introspective passage shattered by a
final, defiant chord from organ and orchestra. The
concerto was met by applause which could be de
scribed as "enthusiastic."
Then an unfortqnately all too unusual thing hap
pened — Curley sat down to play an encore. "Now," I
thought, "now we'll see if this guy can really play." I
had had my doubts about his technique, as he played
the not terribly demanding concerto with the aid of
the sheet music. Any further doubt was immediately

vanquished as Curley began to play a Bach A Minor
Fugue (BWV no., I don't know) with such dexterity
and ferocity that it stunned a very-hard-to-stun au
dience.
It was truly wonderful to see Curley, his feet danc
ing wildly on the pedals as his hands swept from key
board to keyboard, playing and changing stops, all
the while producing the most beautiful crystal-clear
Bach with the ease with which you or I tie our shoes.
The encore was met by a solid four minute standing
ovation which could be described as "thunderous."
After recovering during the intermission, we were
treated to a great piece of music by one of my favorite
underplayed composers, Camille Saint-Saens. Saint-

Saens writes by beautiful, romantically spirited music
which makes excellent use of modern innovations.
The Organ Symphony, one of the most often
played pieces by Saint-Saens, is an excellent example
of this. It begins airily, the light theme of the wood
winds taken up and given substance by the strings and
then whole orchestra. The joyous quality of .the music
then gives way the expression of which
exhausts itself into a gentle and beautifully played
passage.
The Presto was exceptionally well-played, with ex
cellent performances from the woodwinds nad nice
accents in the rapid figures.
The final movement, Maestoso, begins with some
of the biggest and most dramatic chords you are likely
to hear. The movement is conceived on a very grand
scale, and was executed in a grand manner, it being
verv apparent from his movements on the podium
that Cleve was truly working to bring out the best in
the orchestra.
