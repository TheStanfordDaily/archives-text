# A 						different kind of fusion from Hiroshima
## 
### Mark Zeigler Hiroshima 
Zellerbach Auditorium/Berkeley
24 November 1981
It is always nice to see a little variety,
even in the exciting world of
jazz/fusion. It is also pleasing to know
that Americans are not the only ones
who can produce this sound.
Hiroshima, a Japanese-American, Los
Angeles based fusion group, made both
these pleasures realities last Tuesday
night at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium.
Hiroshima is an ethnic mixture of
many different entities. The nine mem
ber group tosses the electric instru
ments of jazz and rock into their musi
cal Cuisinart with a pinch of their
Japanese tradition. They push the
"START" button and, after a few mo
ments, serve up a unique blend of
fusion.
The band calls on an interesting array
of Japanese percussion instruments,
such as the taiko, a huge bass drum
elevated off the ground and played
with two thick sticks. However, the key

to the limited success Hiroshima has
achieved is their use of the koto, a
Japanesestring instrument, which emits
a sound somewhere between a harp
and a guitar. The koto gives Hiroshima
the Oriental touch it needs to stand
from mainstream fusion ensembles.
Without the various Japanese instru
ments, Hiroshima would be a quite or
dinary band, and a rather poor one at
that; it would bo a jack-of-all-trades,
master-of-nothing type of group.
But what made them sound better
than they probably are was Zellerbach
Auditorium, a more than welcome
change from the kind of club in which
fusion groups of Hiroshima's ilk charac
teristically perform. Zellerbach's plush
seats, wide aisles, fresh air, and good
sound make one want to hitoneself for
ever darkening a nightclub's door.
And to make the evening that much
more enjoyable, no $95-per-seat
"warm-up" band, a species often found
in clubs, darkened Zellerbach's stage.
When there is no opening act, it makes
the headliner work harder to prove his
musical prowess to the audience, as
there isn't a hapless group of n on-musi

cians on stage first with which to com
pare them.
Hiroshima put on the necessary show
to captivate the crowd with an hour and
forty-five minute set, including material
from an album yet to be completed,
called Obon. The group opened with
"Fish," a song from this LP, which they
hope to release in February.
The next tune, entitled "Kokoro,"
was calmer than its predecessor, but
featured vicious, biting blasts from the
bass of Dennis Cortez, a guest per
former. All was going well at this point;
however, the next song included lyrics,
not Hiroshima's best quality.
Dan Kuramoto sang the extremeley
limited and simple words, which were
of the"I love you more than anything
else in the world, even ice cream"
degree of sophistication. And what
compounded the problem was
Kuramoto's method of lyrical delivery.
He was your basic, Mark IV imitation of
a cross between John Travolta and Barry
Manilow. Kuramoto toyed with the mi
crophone and its cord to add to the ef
fect.
The fourth song featured Teri

Kusurnoto as lead vocalist, much better
than her male counterpart. She
possesses a fine voice, sounding similar
to Barbara Streisand, but minus the
nose. Yet again the lyrics were retarded.
Hiroshima is professional when it
comes to music, but a mere rookie with
the vocal side of the coin.
In the group's next piece, June Okida
Kuramoto, Hiroshima's koto player,
won over the audience. Her swipes
over the strings represented controlled
anger at times, and serenity at others.
Kuramoto's brilliant solos blended in
superblv with the rest of the tune and
also clearly demonstrated that she is by
far the most talented member of the
band.
Hiroshima is by no means an
awesome jazz/fusion band. But by the
same token, they are not an awful one
either. The group is still an album or two
awav from making some real noise in
the fusion world. But if the new material
Hiroshima performed in concert is any
indication of the success of their 1982
LP, they will be a force to be reckoned
with in the future.

When there is no opening act, it makes
the headliner work harder to prove his
musical prowess to the audience, as
there isn't a hapless group of n on-musi

cians on stage first with which to com
pare them.
Hiroshima put on the necessary show
to captivate the crowd with an hour and
forty-five minute set, including material
from an album yet to be completed,
called Obon. The group opened with
"Fish," a song from this LP, which they
hope to release in February.
The next tune, entitled "Kokoro,"
was calmer than its predecessor, but
featured vicious, biting blasts from the
bass of Dennis Cortez, a guest per
former. All was going well at this point;
however, the next song included lyrics,
not Hiroshima's best quality.
Dan Kuramoto sang the extremeley
limited and simple words, which were
of the"I love you more than anything
else in the world, even ice cream"
degree of sophistication. And what
compounded the problem was
Kuramoto's method of lyrical delivery.
He was your basic, Mark IV imitation of
a cross between John Travolta and Barry
Manilow. Kuramoto toyed with the mi
crophone and its cord to add to the ef
fect.
The fourth song featured Teri

Kusurnoto as lead vocalist, much better
than her male counterpart. She
possesses a fine voice, sounding similar
to Barbara Streisand, but minus the
nose. Yet again the lyrics were retarded.
Hiroshima is professional when it
comes to music, but a mere rookie with
the vocal side of the coin.
In the group's next piece, June Okida
Kuramoto, Hiroshima's koto player,
won over the audience. Her swipes
over the strings represented controlled
anger at times, and serenity at others.
Kuramoto's brilliant solos blended in
superblv with the rest of the tune and
also clearly demonstrated that she is by
far the most talented member of the
band.
Hiroshima is by no means an
awesome jazz/fusion band. But by the
same token, they are not an awful one
either. The group is still an album or two
awav from making some real noise in
the fusion world. But if the new material
Hiroshima performed in concert is any
indication of the success of their 1982
LP, they will be a force to be reckoned
with in the future.
Zellerbach Auditorium/Berkeley
24 November 1981
It is always nice to see a little variety,
even in the exciting world of
jazz/fusion. It is also pleasing to know
that Americans are not the only ones
who can produce this sound.
Hiroshima, a Japanese-American, Los
Angeles based fusion group, made both
these pleasures realities last Tuesday
night at UC Berkeley's Zellerbach
Auditorium.
Hiroshima is an ethnic mixture of
many different entities. The nine mem
ber group tosses the electric instru
ments of jazz and rock into their musi
cal Cuisinart with a pinch of their
Japanese tradition. They push the
"START" button and, after a few mo
ments, serve up a unique blend of
fusion.
The band calls on an interesting array
of Japanese percussion instruments,
such as the taiko, a huge bass drum
elevated off the ground and played
with two thick sticks. However, the key

to the limited success Hiroshima has
achieved is their use of the koto, a
Japanesestring instrument, which emits
a sound somewhere between a harp
and a guitar. The koto gives Hiroshima
the Oriental touch it needs to stand
from mainstream fusion ensembles.
Without the various Japanese instru
ments, Hiroshima would be a quite or
dinary band, and a rather poor one at
that; it would bo a jack-of-all-trades,
master-of-nothing type of group.
But what made them sound better
than they probably are was Zellerbach
Auditorium, a more than welcome
change from the kind of club in which
fusion groups of Hiroshima's ilk charac
teristically perform. Zellerbach's plush
seats, wide aisles, fresh air, and good
sound make one want to hitoneself for
ever darkening a nightclub's door.
And to make the evening that much
more enjoyable, no $95-per-seat
"warm-up" band, a species often found
in clubs, darkened Zellerbach's stage.
When there is no opening act, it makes
the headliner work harder to prove his
musical prowess to the audience, as
there isn't a hapless group of n on-musi

cians on stage first with which to com
pare them.
