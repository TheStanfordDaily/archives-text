Disappointing â€” what
else can be said about a
group like The Cars, who
put out such an incredibly
great first album, and then
slipped into the world of
Nothing-Pop, or non-music
for un-people. Theirsecond
alburn, Candy-O, still
showed signs of life, with
some very good,
tunes. With Panorama, The
Cars finally lost the interest
of most listeners, and their
latest effort, Shake It Up,
promises to be the next step
into oblivion for the former
wonder-group.
It is immediately apparent
from the cover of Shake It
Up that this is still the same
old Cars; the alluring photo
of the young woman shak
ing up a flask, and then an

inside photo of the liquid in
the flask spewing out, are
pretty good indications of
the type of songs we can ex
pect to hear. And, indeed,
songs like "Victim of Love"
and "Think It Over" show
very little change from
"You're All I've Got To
night" or "just What I
Needed" from the first
alhum. Despite some ob
vious obsessions, vocal
ist/guitarist Ric Ocasek
writes some very modern,
innovative and catchy lyrics.
The lyrics on Shake It Up are
no worse than any of those
previous albums, and in
many cases seem less of
fensive and more subtle.
The problem with this
album becomes apparent
when we ask the question:
who listens to The Cars for
their lyrics? The answer is
clearly nobody, because lyr
ics on these albums aren't
worth their weight in
malathion; they are simply
filler for the music, so that
the tunes don't become too
monotonous.
Unfortunately, the songs
on Shake It Lip are not only

monotonous, but tedious,
repetitious and unbearably,
excruciatingly boring. Only
two songs, "Shake It Up"
and "This Could Be Love,"
show any hint of the excite
ment and energy apparent
in both of their first two
albums. Virtually every song
on the album relies on me
chanical-sounding
synethesizer and syn
thesized hand claps for the
backbeat. The innovative
guitar and drum rhythms of
old are gone, along with the
memorable vocal harmo
nies, and even the eerie
guitar solos.
Ric Ocasek, sole writer of
virtually every Cars song,
was recently quoted saying
that Shake It Up is "much
more modern than anything
we've done." If this is his
idea of modern music, then
The Cars may be lost forev
er, headed out into a sea of
dehumanized, emotionless,
mechanical machine-music.

The Cars have always been
electronically inclined, but
it previously seemed that
they would master the ma
chines, turning out fun, ex
citing music. Instead, they
seemed to run out of
creative energy after one or
two albums, and on Shake It
Up, they simply let the ma
chines take control. Ocasek
seems to think that he has
found a formula for writing
new music, and the result is
not music at all, but repeti
tive patterns of sound.
Most bands who pro
duced an album as bad as
Shake It Up would probably
never have been heard from
again, and no one would
care. But The Cars showed
right from the start what
they were capable of, caus
ing lotsof high hopesforthe
future. So, they keep pro
ducing albums and hopeful
fans keep buying. Well lis
ten, Cars fans: don't buy this
album! Do The Cars and
yourself all a favor by not
encouraging the regrettable
trend which they have con
tinued with Shake It Up.
