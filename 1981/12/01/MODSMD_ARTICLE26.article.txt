Mideast threat policy formulated
Washington — Israel and the United States worked
out a landmark "strategic cooperation" agreement
yesterday to deal with any threats to the Middle East
hv the Soviet Union or Soviet-controlled forces from
outside the region.
In a joint statement by Israeli Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon and Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger, the two governments said the new agreement
creating a framework of military cooperation "is not
directed at any state or group of states within the
Middle East."
The statement was an obvious effort to reassure
Arab countries that the United States and Israel would
not act together against any of them.
U.S. officials have made it clear they were con
cerned that anv such U.S.-Israeli pact might evoke a
hostile reaction in the Arab world unless it was speci
fied that the agreement was aimed at a possible Soviet
threat.
The agreement followed a Pentagon ceremony this
morning in which Sharon was greeted bv Weinberger
with a 19-gun salute and full military honors.
Behind the ceremonial facade, however, there was
evident Israeli unhappiness with the agreement.
A Memorandum of Understanding attached to the
pact apparently left the details on stockpiling of U.S.
military equipment in Israel up to future decision.
Soviets urge European arms limits
Moscow — The Soviet leadership voiced readiness
last night to open a political dialogue with the Reagan
administration and urged it to give "full and objective
consideration" to Soviet proposals on curbing nucle
ar arms in Europe.
A joint statement by the ruling politburo, the Soviet
government and the presidium of the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) came on the opening dav of Soviet-
American nuclear talks in Geneva.
The statement seemed to be designed to show the
West Europeans that the Kremlin is serious about the

talks, that it has serious doubts about American inten
tions to seek a "mutually acceptable agreement," but
that in the course of the talks both West European
governments and public at large could play an impor
tant role.
Supreme Court hears Nixon case
Washington — The Supreme Court, in a case of
potentially historic importance, is hearing arguments
over whether former President Nixon can be forced
to pav money out of his own pocket for violating the
rights of Americans.
At stake is the claim bv Pentagon "whistleblower"
A Ernest Fitzgerald that Nixon had him fired for dis
closing to Congress in 1968 that the C-5A military
transport plane could run $2 billion over estimates.
Fitzgerald, who sued Nixon and two aides for 53.5
million, claims his constitutional right to free speech
and his rights to make his views known to Congress
were violated.
Nixon lawyer Herbert Miller contends that a presi
dent needs absolute immunity from lawsuits seeking
money damages for misconduct in office if he is to be
"vigorous and fearless" in performing his duties.
Fitzgerald's lawyer, John Nolan, says absolute im
munitv for the president may be acceptable in "ex
ceptional situations," but that neither history nor the
Constitution requires it in all cases.
Court rules on censorship
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that juries in obscenity cases may suppress books,
magazines or movies without being certain "beyond
a reasonable doubt" that they are obscene.
The 6-3 ruling v\ ill make it easier for state and local
governments and judges to move against what they
consider obscene material.
Some First Amendment experts suggested that the
ruling is of potentially major significance for future
tree expression controversies, although ihe court dis
posed of it in only four pages without hearing full

arguments.
Yesterday's unsigned opinion stemmed from ef
forts bv officials in Santa Ana, Calif., to suppress
pornographic films at a theater there.
Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and
lohn Paul Stevens dissented, saying they believed the
First Amendment requires the strict standard.
Wood's death declared accidental
Los Angeles — The Los Angeles County Coroner's
Office said yesterday that actress Natalie Wood died
accidentally in a weekend boating mishap off Santa
Catalina Island and there was "no evidence of foul
play.
"Based on available evidence and information, it
appears that Miss Wood slipped while attempting to
board the small dinghy and entered the water," said
the written statement released by the Los Angeles
County coroner's office.
"Apparently she was unable to reboard the dinghy
or the vacht and tragically perished," the statement
said.
"There is no evidence of foul play or any cause oth
er than accidental drowning. According with stan
dard procedure, toxicology and laboratory tests are
being conducted."
Airlines to reduce flight service
Washington — The nation's airlines will begin re
ducing their scheduled flights by 5 percent today in
accordance with a Federal Aviation Administration
plan to limit flights because of the reduced air traffic
control work force.
The plan will eliminate between 500 and 600 flights,
primarily extra flights scheduled during morning and
evening rush hours, and chiefly in the Northeastern
section of the country.
FAA spokesman Dick Stafford said that the flights
were being reduced starting in December to take into
account the likelihood of bad weather and to reduce
the controllers to a 40-hour week.
He said that the FAA expects the cutback to last un

til ,ibout March, when most of the inclement weather
is expected to be over.
Recession predicted to continue
Washington — A key national measure of future ec
onomic strength dipped substantially again last
month in what one independent forecaster called
"the last big blowoff" of the current recession.
But a government official said the economy would
remain "pretty weak" the rest of the year, with no real
upturn until spring.
T"he Commerce Department reported that its Index
of Leading Indicators fell 1.8 percent in Oct., the third
straight decline and the fifth in six months.
The sizable drop still wasn't as bad as Sept. dip of 2.2
percent, the sharpest decline since May 1980 and the
heart of last vear's recession.
"The recession is for real and it's continuing," said
Robert Ortner, chief economist for the Commerce
Market posts fourth straight gain
New York — The stock market came on strong in
the last hour of an erratic session to record its fourth
straight gain Monday.
Takeover speculation produced brisk activity in
several energy and other natural-resources stocks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off more
than 5 points at its mid-session low, finished with a
.3.04 gain at 888.98. Last week the average climbed
33.01 points.
The daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange
showed advances with a 9-5 edge on declines, and the
exchange's composite index rose .66 to 73.37.
Marathon Oil, subject of a takeover battle between
U.S. Steel and Mobil Corp., led the active list and
dropped 2 1 h to 104 ' 4.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow with patchy fog
nights and mornings. Lows in the 30's and low 40's,
highs in the mid 50's to low 60's. Light winds.

Airlines to reduce flight service
Washington — The nation's airlines will begin re
ducing their scheduled flights by 5 percent today in
accordance with a Federal Aviation Administration
plan to limit flights because of the reduced air traffic
control work force.
The plan will eliminate between 500 and 600 flights,
primarily extra flights scheduled during morning and
evening rush hours, and chiefly in the Northeastern
section of the country.
FAA spokesman Dick Stafford said that the flights
were being reduced starting in December to take into
account the likelihood of bad weather and to reduce
the controllers to a 40-hour week.
He said that the FAA expects the cutback to last un

til ,ibout March, when most of the inclement weather
is expected to be over.
Recession predicted to continue
Washington — A key national measure of future ec
onomic strength dipped substantially again last
month in what one independent forecaster called
"the last big blowoff" of the current recession.
But a government official said the economy would
remain "pretty weak" the rest of the year, with no real
upturn until spring.
T"he Commerce Department reported that its Index
of Leading Indicators fell 1.8 percent in Oct., the third
straight decline and the fifth in six months.
The sizable drop still wasn't as bad as Sept. dip of 2.2
percent, the sharpest decline since May 1980 and the
heart of last vear's recession.

Market posts fourth straight gain
New York — The stock market came on strong in
the last hour of an erratic session to record its fourth

Takeover speculation produced brisk activity in
several energy and other natural-resources stocks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off more
than 5 points at its mid-session low, finished with a
.3.04 gain at 888.98. Last week the average climbed
33.01 points.
The daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange

Mideast threat policy formulated
Washington — Israel and the United States worked
out a landmark "strategic cooperation" agreement
yesterday to deal with any threats to the Middle East
hv the Soviet Union or Soviet-controlled forces from
outside the region.
In a joint statement by Israeli Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon and Defense Secretary Caspar Wein
berger, the two governments said the new agreement
creating a framework of military cooperation "is not
directed at any state or group of states within the
Middle East."
The statement was an obvious effort to reassure
Arab countries that the United States and Israel would
not act together against any of them.
U.S. officials have made it clear they were con
cerned that anv such U.S.-Israeli pact might evoke a
hostile reaction in the Arab world unless it was speci
fied that the agreement was aimed at a possible Soviet
threat.
The agreement followed a Pentagon ceremony this
morning in which Sharon was greeted bv Weinberger
with a 19-gun salute and full military honors.
Behind the ceremonial facade, however, there was
evident Israeli unhappiness with the agreement.
A Memorandum of Understanding attached to the
pact apparently left the details on stockpiling of U.S.
military equipment in Israel up to future decision.
Soviets urge European arms limits
Moscow — The Soviet leadership voiced readiness
last night to open a political dialogue with the Reagan
administration and urged it to give "full and objective
consideration" to Soviet proposals on curbing nucle
ar arms in Europe.
A joint statement by the ruling politburo, the Soviet
government and the presidium of the Supreme Soviet
(parliament) came on the opening dav of Soviet-
American nuclear talks in Geneva.
The statement seemed to be designed to show the
West Europeans that the Kremlin is serious about the

talks, that it has serious doubts about American inten
tions to seek a "mutually acceptable agreement," but
that in the course of the talks both West European
governments and public at large could play an impor
tant role.
Supreme Court hears Nixon case
Washington — The Supreme Court, in a case of
potentially historic importance, is hearing arguments
over whether former President Nixon can be forced
to pav money out of his own pocket for violating the
rights of Americans.
At stake is the claim bv Pentagon "whistleblower"
A Ernest Fitzgerald that Nixon had him fired for dis
closing to Congress in 1968 that the C-5A military
transport plane could run $2 billion over estimates.
Fitzgerald, who sued Nixon and two aides for 53.5
million, claims his constitutional right to free speech
and his rights to make his views known to Congress
were violated.
Nixon lawyer Herbert Miller contends that a presi
dent needs absolute immunity from lawsuits seeking
money damages for misconduct in office if he is to be
"vigorous and fearless" in performing his duties.
Fitzgerald's lawyer, John Nolan, says absolute im
munitv for the president may be acceptable in "ex
ceptional situations," but that neither history nor the
Constitution requires it in all cases.
Court rules on censorship
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that juries in obscenity cases may suppress books,
magazines or movies without being certain "beyond
a reasonable doubt" that they are obscene.
The 6-3 ruling v\ ill make it easier for state and local
governments and judges to move against what they
consider obscene material.
Some First Amendment experts suggested that the
ruling is of potentially major significance for future
tree expression controversies, although ihe court dis
posed of it in only four pages without hearing full

arguments.
Yesterday's unsigned opinion stemmed from ef
forts bv officials in Santa Ana, Calif., to suppress
pornographic films at a theater there.
Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and
lohn Paul Stevens dissented, saying they believed the
First Amendment requires the strict standard.
Wood's death declared accidental
Los Angeles — The Los Angeles County Coroner's
Office said yesterday that actress Natalie Wood died
accidentally in a weekend boating mishap off Santa
Catalina Island and there was "no evidence of foul
play.
"Based on available evidence and information, it
appears that Miss Wood slipped while attempting to
board the small dinghy and entered the water," said
the written statement released by the Los Angeles
County coroner's office.
"Apparently she was unable to reboard the dinghy
or the vacht and tragically perished," the statement
said.
"There is no evidence of foul play or any cause oth
er than accidental drowning. According with stan
dard procedure, toxicology and laboratory tests are
being conducted."
