Editor's election

take advantage of often and early)
will take place Thursday from 10 a.m.
to 8:15 p.m. in the Daily office. The
voting list is posted outside Sam's of

Grill session fish fry
Here it is — your chance to rub
elbows with the stars . . . er, grovel
with the swine. Bring the future
powers-that-be to their feet with
penetrating questions and de
rogatory comments. The biannual
grill session for editor candidates will
take place today, over lunch, in the
Daily office. All staffers invited — and
don't forget to ask them what's in it
for you.
Money
All staffers who wish to get paid
(that's paid with a p) and who hav«
not yet signed a contract card this
year must sign the card by noon to
day.

Photo meeting
There will be a meeting for all pho
tographers at 4 p.m. Thursday in the

Or at least be two columns by four

tight with a 20 percent screen.
Proletariat bash
Finally, a fogcutter party has come
to pass! Tonight, from 8:30 p.m. to

gregate and party!
Christmas banquet

be one of the best ever. Awards are

tionable hardships in the quest for
journalistic ideals. Sign up in the of
fice soon: we're nearly done giving
