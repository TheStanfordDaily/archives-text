# Ginsberg reflects on the '60s

The revolution of the 1960s was a response to the
"schizophrenia" which has characterized modern
American society, said poet and prominent leader of the
new left Aften Otftsberg'frt s speech before- morc-than
300 at Branner Hall yesterday evening.
"During the 19405, many people still believed that
what was written in Time magazine was the only reality,"
Ginsberg said. "By 1953, most people were beginning to
be hip to the difference between what was being said
and what was being done."
The emergence of the atomic bomb was an important
element in changing people's awareness and ideas about
history, according to Ginsberg.
"The bomb had a psychedelic effect on people," he
said. "By psychedelic, I mean mind-expanding. It posed
an insoluble riddle in people's minds, bodies, speech
and hearts. The weight of the bomb placed a crack in the
consciousness of Americans. It let the light in."
The shattering of the notion of "The American
Dream" was another factor that spurred the changes of
the 19605, Ginsberg said.
"The American Dream was supposed to be liberty, the
Bill of Rights, progress and individualism above all,"
Ginsberg said. "But bv 1953, everyone could see that the
CIA had overthrown a government in Guatemala and
another one in Iran. American agencies were doing
things that were un-American on many, many levels."
Ginsberg entertained the audience with a story of how
the CIA introduced LSD to America.
"The CIA bought 50 million doses of acid during the

50<. because someone made a clerical error," he said.
"Since Russia was experimenting with LSD, they thought
it was part of the Cold War they had to get into."
The idea was that you could create murderers, drive
people crazy or create assassihS'who would suffer"from
amnesia after killing someone, he explained. "So they
established a giant program to test the effects of LSD.
Many of the doctors who participated in the program
didn't know they were working for the CIA. They
thought their funds were coming from an independent
foundation."
Ginsberg said he took LSD as part of a research project
at Stanford in 1959.
Ginsberg read from CIA documents that instructed FBI
agents to infiltrate the student anti-war movement. CIA
"counter-intelligence" suggestions included sending
letters about a student's activist tendencies to his parents
and his parent's employers. The anonymous letters were
to be signed, "a concerned alumni."
"With the war in Vietnam and Watergate, the entire
schizophrenia became public." Ginsberg said, "But like
an old alcoholic, we are addicted to our hallucinations.
People throughout the world continue to suffer for our
mania."
"The first thing to do is to acknowledge the situation as
it is," he said. "But begin with yourself. Examine your
own hostility and aggressions, and then work outward
toward the world."
Ginsberg was the first speaker in a series of lectures
and activities organized by the Branner Hall resident
staff.
