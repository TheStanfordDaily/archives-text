# Heart-lung patient returns home
## 
### 
Barry Davis, the fourth patient to
receive a heart-lung transplant here,
went home to Redwood City last
Wednesday after spending 46 days in
recovery at the Stanford Hospital.
Dr. Bruce Reitz, assistant professor
of cardiovascular surgery, said Davis,
40, will he returning to Stanford for
twice-weekly clinic visits and con
tinue at home with a physical therapy
program, including bicycling and
weightlifting.
"We're very pleased with the way
the program is going," said Reitz,
who performed the Oct. 11 trans
plant.
"The results have encouraged us to
go forward and continue to screen
for persons who might be suitable for
the procedure."
Reitz said Davis' prospects for re
turning to normal activity, including
a career, were good.
Davis suffered since birth from a
ventricular septal defect, a hole be
tween the two primary chambers of
the heart.
He had suffered symptoms since
he was 15 years old and was forced to
quit his job in hotel management
about two years ago because of phys
ical deterioration.
His lungs ultimately were damaged
beyond repair, because his defective
heart caused an overload of blood
into the lungs.
Davis was selected for the heart
lung transplant procedure after doc
tors determined that he could not
survive more than a few months
without it.
