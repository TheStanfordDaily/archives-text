# Anti-nuke groups petition for weapons freeze
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
A coalition of anti-nuclear
weapons groups is attempting to
place an initiative calling for a
bilateral freeze on nuclear weap
ons production and testing on
next November's California
ballot.
A statewide petition drive be
gins today. The groups need
346,119 valid signatures before
April 1 for the proposal to be
placed on the ballot.
Proponents of the petition say it
will act to pressure President
Ronald Reagan to enter arms ne
gotiations. Scott Elrod of Protest
and Survive, a Stanford organiza
tion involved in the drive, noted
that California is the President's
home state and also contains ap
proximately 10 percent of the na
tion's voters.
Elrod stressed that the weapons
freeze initiative called for bilateral
rather than unilateral arms reduc
tions, A preliminary draft of the
proposal reads, "The people of
California do hereby request that
the President of the United States
propose to the Soviet Union a
mutual nuclear weapons
moratorium to immediately halt
the testing, production and
deployment of all nuclear war
heads, missies and delivery sys
tems."
Protest and Survive intends to
set up booths in White Plaza dur
ing the lunch hour next week. An
other Palo Alto group, the Wom
en's Party for Survival, will also set

up booths next Wednesday.
Other groups involved in the
statewide drive include Human
itas, the Campaign for Economic
Democracy, Physicians for Social
Responsibility, the War Resisters'
League, the Women's Interna
tional League for Peace and Free
dom and the Ecumenical Out
reach Coalition, a group of 14 lo
cal churches.
In addition to setting up booths,
the groups hope to gain signa
tures through petition parties and
a dance for disarmament on Dec.
12. The dance will feature Joan
Haez and Jerry Garcia at the San
Mateo County Fairgrounds, Elrod
said.
Freeze proposals have been
passed by legislatures in Massa
chusetts, Oregon and New York.
These resolutions at a state level
are not legally binding on the fed
eral government. However, pro
ponents of the measures hope
thev will spur greater emphasis on
arms talks.
Calls for mutual arms reduc
tions were passed by the San Fran
cisco, Marin and Alameda boards
of supervisors, proponents say. In
addition to government groups,
voters in four western Massachu
setts state senatorial districts ap
proved a freeze resolution recent
ly. In 30 of those 33 towns, Elrod
noted, Ronald Reagan was simul
taneously given a majority vote.
Arms freeze proponents say
California is affected more than

most states by nuclear arms. They
note that "Livermore laboratories
design them, a host of aerospace
companies from Sunnyvale to San
Diego build them and the Con
cord and Alameda Naval Stations
store them."
The California petition drive oc
curs as European concern over
disarmament mounts. Recently
hundreds of thousands of Europe
ans demonstrated against con
tinued arms buildups, leading
President Reagan to propose a
freeze in Europe. The referen
dum's proponents hope to keep
this sort of pressure on the gov
ernment.
Anti-nuclear groups have been
active around the University re
cently. Protest and Survive formed
several weeks ago. Physicians for
Social Responsibility, a national
group, has a chapter here which
has publicized the effects of nu
clear war. It produced a videotape
presentation entitled "The Last
Epidemic" about the effects of a
nuclear explosion over a city the
size of San Francisco, which to
gether with the movie "War
Game" will be shown tonight in
Terman.
The California petition must be
sent to the state's voter regis
tration board before being put on
the ballot. Californians for a
Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze
estimate they will need 500,000
signautres to compensate for in
accuracies and duplications.

that California is the President's
home state and also contains ap
proximately 10 percent of the na
tion's voters.
Elrod stressed that the weapons
freeze initiative called for bilateral
rather than unilateral arms reduc
tions, A preliminary draft of the
proposal reads, "The people of
California do hereby request that
the President of the United States
propose to the Soviet Union a
mutual nuclear weapons
moratorium to immediately halt
the testing, production and
deployment of all nuclear war
heads, missies and delivery sys
tems."
Protest and Survive intends to
set up booths in White Plaza dur
ing the lunch hour next week. An
other Palo Alto group, the Wom
en's Party for Survival, will also set

up booths next Wednesday.
Other groups involved in the
statewide drive include Human
itas, the Campaign for Economic
Democracy, Physicians for Social
Responsibility, the War Resisters'
League, the Women's Interna
tional League for Peace and Free
dom and the Ecumenical Out
reach Coalition, a group of 14 lo
cal churches.
In addition to setting up booths,
the groups hope to gain signa
tures through petition parties and
a dance for disarmament on Dec.
12. The dance will feature Joan
Haez and Jerry Garcia at the San
Mateo County Fairgrounds, Elrod
said.
Freeze proposals have been
passed by legislatures in Massa
chusetts, Oregon and New York.
These resolutions at a state level
are not legally binding on the fed
eral government. However, pro
ponents of the measures hope
thev will spur greater emphasis on
arms talks.
Calls for mutual arms reduc
tions were passed by the San Fran
cisco, Marin and Alameda boards
of supervisors, proponents say. In
addition to government groups,
voters in four western Massachu
setts state senatorial districts ap
proved a freeze resolution recent
ly. In 30 of those 33 towns, Elrod
noted, Ronald Reagan was simul
taneously given a majority vote.
Arms freeze proponents say
California is affected more than

most states by nuclear arms. They
note that "Livermore laboratories
design them, a host of aerospace
companies from Sunnyvale to San
Diego build them and the Con
cord and Alameda Naval Stations
store them."
The California petition drive oc
curs as European concern over
disarmament mounts. Recently
hundreds of thousands of Europe
ans demonstrated against con
tinued arms buildups, leading
President Reagan to propose a
freeze in Europe. The referen
dum's proponents hope to keep
this sort of pressure on the gov
ernment.
Anti-nuclear groups have been
active around the University re
cently. Protest and Survive formed
several weeks ago. Physicians for
Social Responsibility, a national
group, has a chapter here which
has publicized the effects of nu
clear war. It produced a videotape
presentation entitled "The Last
Epidemic" about the effects of a
nuclear explosion over a city the
size of San Francisco, which to
gether with the movie "War
Game" will be shown tonight in
Terman.
The California petition must be
sent to the state's voter regis
tration board before being put on
the ballot. Californians for a
Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze
estimate they will need 500,000
signautres to compensate for in
accuracies and duplications.
