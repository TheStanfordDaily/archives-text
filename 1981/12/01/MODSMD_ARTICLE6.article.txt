## Rev. Paisley leads Ulster's Protestants 
### Los Angeles Times 
Belfast, Northern Ireland
— Every Sunday evening,
the red brick Martyrs Me
morial Free Presbyterian
Church in East Belfast —
with a British flag flying out
side — fills to overflowing.
Three thousand par
ishioners have come to hear
the Rev. Lan Paisley preach
fundamentalist fire and
brimstone. A Paisley sermon
is a powerful mixture of
God-fearing Protestantism
and sharp political attacks.
For Paisley, 55-year-old
member of the British Par
liament for North Antrim
County, is the fiery political
leader of the Protestant mili
tants in Northern Ireland.
In this troubled British
province, many in the Pro
tesant majority turn to men
like Paisley when they see a
threat to their way of life. Of
whatever political stripe,
the Protestants of Ulster
have deeply ingrained fears
of being absorbed by the
Catholic south in a unified
government that would
leave them in a minority of
one million to 3.75 million

Catholics. In Northern Ire
land today, there is a two
to-one Protestant majority.
Paisley has found it easy to
capitalize on Protestant
fears of an eventual British
sellout, and time and time
again raises the specter of
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher seeking to divest
Britain of the troublesome
province.
Paisley booms out in his
sermons, "We have an un
holy trio — the Thatcherite
government, the Dublin
government, and the IRA.
Thev all have the same goal
to bring us into an all-Ire
land Republic. "That will
never be. Over our dead
bodies, only," he says.
Troubled year
For the Protestants of Ul
ster, as Northern Ireland is
called here, it has not been a
good year.
This year they have seen
IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands elected to the British
Parliament as he lay dying in
a prison outside this provin
cial capital. And they have
seen one of their own mem
bers of Parliament, the Rev.

Robert Bradford, as
sassinated by IRA gunmen.
And more ominous to the
Protestant militants have
been the talks between
Thatcher and Irish Prime
Minister Garret FitzGerald,
which seem to have taken
the problems of Ulster out
of a purely British context.
Paisley's Democratic
Unionist Party, which broke
away from the Official
Unionist Partv in 1970, has
increased its share of the
vote in every election since
then, now equalling the pa
rent party in popularity
polls.
It was Paisley's call for a
"day of action" that sent
thousands of unionists into
the streets of Ulster last
week, an event that ap
peared to strengthen his
claim to speak for the Prot
estant masses.
Not since the English co
lonized Northern Ireland in
the 17th century — about
the same time they settled in
America — have the Protes
tants been so uneasy about
their relations with the
mother country.

After the Irish Free State
was proclaimed in the south
in 1922, the British set up a
Northern Ireland Par
liament with a prime min
ister and Cabinet, and for 50
vears it ran the six counties
of Ulster as the Protestants
saw fit.
During those decades the
Catholic population — now
numbering about half a mil
lion to the Protestants' mil
lion — claimed it was dis
criminated against, not only
in a gerrymandered Par
liament, but in jobs and
housing. But their com
plaints brought little
change.
Finally, in 1968, the Catho
lic civil rights movement be
came more active, leading
to incidents that brought on
the current "troubles"
which at times have
amounted to guerrilla war
fare in the province.
In 1973, the British tried to
construct a "power-shar
ing" arrangement between
Protestants and Catholics in
Northern Ireland which,
partly due to Paisley's stiff
opposition, broke down,
and the province returned
to direct rule by the Par
liament in London.
The policy of the Official
Unionists is to remain a part
of the United Kingdom
without any home-rule gov
ernment in Northern Ire
land.
Paisley's Democratic
Unionists also want to re
main in the United King
dom, but have called for a
provincial government that
would give the Protestants a
commanding say, as they
had before London re
sumed direct rule here.
The unionist parties have
no official ties with the Prot
estant paramilitary or
ganizations here, though
they may have unofficial
ones.
The official government
security forces, the Ulster
Defense Regiment, with
7500 members, is not politi
cal. It is a unit of the British
army and has British of
ficers. Most of its soldiers
serve part time.

province, many in the Pro
tesant majority turn to men
like Paisley when they see a
threat to their way of life. Of
whatever political stripe,
the Protestants of Ulster
have deeply ingrained fears
of being absorbed by the
Catholic south in a unified
government that would
leave them in a minority of
one million to 3.75 million

Catholics. In Northern Ire
land today, there is a two
to-one Protestant majority.
Paisley has found it easy to
capitalize on Protestant
fears of an eventual British
sellout, and time and time
again raises the specter of
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher seeking to divest
Britain of the troublesome
province.
Paisley booms out in his
sermons, "We have an un
holy trio — the Thatcherite
government, the Dublin
government, and the IRA.
Thev all have the same goal
to bring us into an all-Ire
land Republic. "That will
never be. Over our dead
bodies, only," he says.
Troubled year
For the Protestants of Ul
ster, as Northern Ireland is
called here, it has not been a
good year.
This year they have seen
IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands elected to the British
Parliament as he lay dying in
a prison outside this provin
cial capital. And they have
seen one of their own mem
bers of Parliament, the Rev.

Robert Bradford, as
sassinated by IRA gunmen.
And more ominous to the
Protestant militants have
been the talks between
Thatcher and Irish Prime
Minister Garret FitzGerald,
which seem to have taken
the problems of Ulster out
of a purely British context.
Paisley's Democratic
Unionist Party, which broke
away from the Official
Unionist Partv in 1970, has
increased its share of the
vote in every election since
then, now equalling the pa
rent party in popularity
polls.
It was Paisley's call for a
"day of action" that sent
thousands of unionists into
the streets of Ulster last
week, an event that ap
peared to strengthen his
claim to speak for the Prot
estant masses.
Not since the English co
lonized Northern Ireland in
the 17th century — about
the same time they settled in
America — have the Protes
tants been so uneasy about
their relations with the
mother country.

After the Irish Free State
was proclaimed in the south
in 1922, the British set up a
Northern Ireland Par
liament with a prime min
ister and Cabinet, and for 50
vears it ran the six counties
of Ulster as the Protestants
saw fit.
During those decades the
Catholic population — now
numbering about half a mil
lion to the Protestants' mil
lion — claimed it was dis
criminated against, not only
in a gerrymandered Par
liament, but in jobs and
housing. But their com
plaints brought little
change.
Finally, in 1968, the Catho
lic civil rights movement be
came more active, leading
to incidents that brought on
the current "troubles"
which at times have
amounted to guerrilla war
fare in the province.
In 1973, the British tried to
construct a "power-shar
ing" arrangement between
Protestants and Catholics in
Northern Ireland which,
partly due to Paisley's stiff
opposition, broke down,
and the province returned
to direct rule by the Par
liament in London.
The policy of the Official
Unionists is to remain a part
of the United Kingdom
without any home-rule gov
ernment in Northern Ire
land.
Paisley's Democratic
Unionists also want to re
main in the United King
dom, but have called for a
provincial government that
would give the Protestants a
commanding say, as they
had before London re
sumed direct rule here.
The unionist parties have
no official ties with the Prot
estant paramilitary or
ganizations here, though
they may have unofficial
ones.
The official government
security forces, the Ulster
Defense Regiment, with
7500 members, is not politi
cal. It is a unit of the British
army and has British of
ficers. Most of its soldiers
serve part time.

CATHOLIC MOURNERS — The family of a slain Catholic social worker follows his
hearse in Northern Ireland, two weeks ago. Authorities suspect that Protes

Belfast, Northern Ireland

the red brick Martyrs Me

Church in East Belfast —

Three thousand par

the Rev. Lan Paisley preach
fundamentalist fire and
brimstone. A Paisley sermon
is a powerful mixture of
God-fearing Protestantism
and sharp political attacks.
