# 'Third force' in Cambodian war building in Jungle and abroad
## 
### Washington Post 
Bangkok, Thailand â€” With Vietnamese oc
cupation troops and Communist Khmer Rouge
guerrillas locked in a military stalemate, anti
communist Cambodians and their Southeast
Asian backers once again are trying to build up a
so-far elusive "third force" as part of an eventual
solution.
The cornerstone of the latest effort is an ex
tended fund-raising tour of Western countries
bv former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann
and other leaders of the Khmer People's Na
tional Liberation Front, the largest component
of the non-communist "third force" that is also
known as the Khmer Serei or Free Khmer.
While Son Sann's group still is no match mili
tarily for either the Vietnamese army or the
Khmer Rouge, it has developed into a well-or
ganized political force, according to Western
diplomats. In addition, it appears to be building
a military infrastructure to support future
growth.
At camps such as Banteay Ampil in north
western Cambodia just across the Thai border,
the Khmer People's National Liberation Front is
turning out thousands of civilian cadres in a
broad campaign of "political warfare" against
the Vietnamese-installed government in Phnom
Penh.
On the political front, according to relief of
ficials and Western diplomats, the organization
has made far greater gains than the Khmer
Rouge, whose popular support is negligible be
cause of the brutality of its rule from 1975 to
1979.
The front "has to be reckoned with right now
politically," a Western diplomat said. He cited

refugee reports of Khmer Serei political ac
tivities in the Cambodian interior. "They're or
ganized and they're out there," he said. "They
do have a network."
According to Western military sources, most
of the front's estimated 8000 to 9000 fighters are
used for the defense of its Banteay Ampil com
plex across the border from Thailand. But, they
said that while the front's military commander,
Dien Del, has an active and systematic training
program, the front's forces rarely combat the
Vietnamese or Phnom Penh government troops.
"Dien Del isscaredtotaketoo many casualties
when he's trying to build up his force," one
Western defense attache said. Currently, the
.30,000 to 40,000 guerrillas of the Chinese-backed
Khmer Rouge still do most of the fighting against
the Vietnamese, who have an estimated 200,000
troops in Cambodia.
In private, the Chinese at times have been
scathingly critical of the front, charging that it
(foes not do enough fighting and has not effec
tively used the weapons that Peking has already
delivered to it, the military attache said.
Evidence of the front's organization can be
seen at camps such as Banteay Ampil. During a
recent visit there, young recruits were drilling
with Chinese 75mm recoilless rifles and AK-57
machine guns supplied earlier this year.
Spread around the sprawling jungle camp are
bunkers, munitions storehouses, barracks and a
military hospital built of wood and thatch. Two
small settlements at the camp, which is off-limits
to foreign relief workers, consist of neat rows of
thatch-roofed huts reserved for soldiers and
their families.
