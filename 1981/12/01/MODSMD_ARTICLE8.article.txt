# China brings in market forces
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Peking — Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang re
committed the government here yesterday to
restructuring the country's economy so that
market forces can play an increasing role,
freeing both agriculture and industry from rigid
state administration.
But Zhao told the annual session of the Na
tional People's Congress, the Chinese par
liament, that central planning would remain
predominant, particularly in key areas, and that
the reforms would be introduced step by step to
avoid economic disruption.
Zhao also reaffirmed the government's long
term development strategy of using consumer
industries as the motor of economic growth, at
tempting to meet the demands of the world's
largest market, rather than continuing to de
pend on investments in heavy industry to boost
production and provide jobs.
The Chinese premier's proposed guidelines
and the general goals of the next five-year plan
are to be discussed by the 3500 deputies to the
congress before they are elaborated in the ac-

tual plan next year.
In his speech, Zhao anticipated some of the
objections that deputies were likely to raise, and
assured them that China would continue to
adhere to socialism even as it made use of ele
ments of the market economy, but Chinese ob
servers expected heated debates in the closed
door panel discussions today.
Zhao's plans foreconomicrestructuring, shift
ing the resources from reinvestment to con
sumption, from heavy industry to light, from the
planned sector to the market, echoed with the
prudence of having gone too far in rapid mod
ernization attempts in 1980.
But China is ready now to give increasing play
to market forces, Zhao said, and that will include
letting the law of supply and demand begin to
set prices for many commodities here.
In agriculture, Zhao said, reforms begun three
years ago have already given peasants the au
thority to plan their own production and de
velop sideline activities, bringing China another
bumper harvest.
