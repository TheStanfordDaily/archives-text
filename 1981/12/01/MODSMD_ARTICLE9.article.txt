## For some, a wall isn't just a wall 
### Jeff Sims 
"The main reason I came to Stanford
as an undergraduate was to climb the
walls here — I'm serious," said Jim Col
lins, an accomplished rock climber who
is now a business school student.
"Stanford is the best place in the
world for buildering (scaling a build
ing's walls). It's a mecca for builderers
from all over the world," said Collins.
Buildering seems to be more popular
than many people might believe.
"There are a lot of people who do this.
It's not a weirdism," insisted Collins. "It
is just another form of exercise. The
trouble is that people are not used to
it."
According to Greg Larson of the Stan
ford Alpine Club, interest in buildering
is growing. Climbers can often be seen
scaling the sides of the Art Gallery
Building, Memorial Court, and Encina
Hall, and there is a regular weekly
buildering session on Wednesday after
noons. This regular session gives be
ginners a chance to learn thesport from
more experienced climbers, said
Larson.
Larson said he had a list of 110 people
who are active climbers or are in
terested.
Lisa Stratton, after buildering for the
first time, said she was" really glad" she
had tried it, and said she planned to
continue the sport. "Buildering is not as
exciting as rock climbing because you
are not so far off the ground, but it's
great practice (for rock climbing)," she
said.
Builderers have received a wide vari
ety of reactions from curious students,
faculty members, and tourists. "The re
actions vary from bewildered stares to
questioning, concerned looks. Some
people just like to watch how gracefully
they climb the buildings," said Larson.
"The most usual questions are some
thing like 'Do finals make you climb
walls?', and 'Are you related to
spiderman?' " said Collins.
Collins, however, has encountered a
few more unusual reactions during his
buildering career. "Once I was climb
ing when 100 Japanese tourists came
out of a bus and started taking pictures.
Finally one man stepped forward and
said 'Oh yes, Americans really are on
drugs.' I had a hard time persuading

him I wasn't," related Collins.
"Another time a philosophy pro
fessor saw me buildering and asked
'Can this be construed as the ultimate
solution to the existential dilemma?"'
he said,
Builderers believe their sport is a val
uable activity, as it provides excellent
training for rock climbing and is also a
challenging activity in itself. "Many
rock climbers start buildering to prac
tice skills, but end up practicing it for
the challenge and exercise — just for
itself."
The buildings at Stanford are an "ide
al weight room" for climbers, accord
ing to Collins. "It's an intellectual and
physical workout," he said. "The dif
ferent types of problems here provide
exercise for the whole body. And if you
are concentrating on a handhold that is
two feet out of reach you completely
forget about school or whatever else is
worrying you. It's also just a lot of fun,"
he said.
"Climbers who builder at Stanford
are constantly making progress. As a re
sult, a lot of really good climbers come
out of here," Collins said.
The buildings here have enough vari
ety to satisfy both novices and ex
perienced climbers. There is even a
guide printed by the Alpine Club that
?iescribes some of the climbs in detail.
Many problems have been given names
which are often very appropriate to
their location. The climb on the philos

ophy building, for example, has been
dubbed "Kant Be Done", and the climb
over Memorial Church is known as
"Stairway to Heaven."
The most difficult climb, according to
Collins, is "Genocide", which is located
on Building 260 in the Quad. "It is the
most difficult buildering problem in the
world, and has only been fully com
pleted once,"he said.
Buildering at Stanford has had a long
history, according to Larson. "One pro
fessor said there have been builderers
here since he was an undergraduate,"
he said.
Through the years, the University has
not paid much attention to the
builderers. "The administration is usu
ally indifferent to what we do, as long as
it is not dangerous or we are not inter
rupting classes," said Collins.
One area now off limits to builderers,
however, is Memorial Church. "Tour
ists and the people at the church didn't
like the chalk marks,"said Collins.
"Also, there was an incident three
vears ago during a Christmas service.
During Mass, a builderer's silhouette
suddenly appeared through a stained
glass window. I guess the people in the
church were not too pleased by that,"
said Collins.
"Once I was climbing on Mem Chu
when a priest walked out and stared up
at me, " said Collins. "I told him: 'Don't
mind me father, I'm on the Stairway to
Heaven.' He just glared."

is now a business school student.
"Stanford is the best place in the
world for buildering (scaling a build
ing's walls). It's a mecca for builderers
from all over the world," said Collins.
Buildering seems to be more popular
than many people might believe.
"There are a lot of people who do this.
It's not a weirdism," insisted Collins. "It
is just another form of exercise. The
trouble is that people are not used to
it."
According to Greg Larson of the Stan
ford Alpine Club, interest in buildering
is growing. Climbers can often be seen
scaling the sides of the Art Gallery
Building, Memorial Court, and Encina
Hall, and there is a regular weekly
buildering session on Wednesday after
noons. This regular session gives be
ginners a chance to learn thesport from
more experienced climbers, said
Larson.
Larson said he had a list of 110 people
who are active climbers or are in
terested.
Lisa Stratton, after buildering for the
first time, said she was" really glad" she
had tried it, and said she planned to
continue the sport. "Buildering is not as
exciting as rock climbing because you
are not so far off the ground, but it's
great practice (for rock climbing)," she
said.
Builderers have received a wide vari
ety of reactions from curious students,
faculty members, and tourists. "The re
actions vary from bewildered stares to
questioning, concerned looks. Some
people just like to watch how gracefully
they climb the buildings," said Larson.
"The most usual questions are some
thing like 'Do finals make you climb
walls?', and 'Are you related to
spiderman?' " said Collins.
Collins, however, has encountered a
few more unusual reactions during his
buildering career. "Once I was climb
ing when 100 Japanese tourists came
out of a bus and started taking pictures.
Finally one man stepped forward and
said 'Oh yes, Americans really are on
drugs.' I had a hard time persuading

him I wasn't," related Collins.
"Another time a philosophy pro
fessor saw me buildering and asked
'Can this be construed as the ultimate
solution to the existential dilemma?"'
he said,
Builderers believe their sport is a val
uable activity, as it provides excellent
training for rock climbing and is also a
challenging activity in itself. "Many
rock climbers start buildering to prac
tice skills, but end up practicing it for
the challenge and exercise — just for
itself."
The buildings at Stanford are an "ide
al weight room" for climbers, accord
ing to Collins. "It's an intellectual and
physical workout," he said. "The dif
ferent types of problems here provide
exercise for the whole body. And if you
are concentrating on a handhold that is
two feet out of reach you completely
forget about school or whatever else is
worrying you. It's also just a lot of fun,"
he said.
"Climbers who builder at Stanford
are constantly making progress. As a re
sult, a lot of really good climbers come
out of here," Collins said.
The buildings here have enough vari
ety to satisfy both novices and ex
perienced climbers. There is even a
guide printed by the Alpine Club that
?iescribes some of the climbs in detail.
Many problems have been given names
which are often very appropriate to
their location. The climb on the philos

ophy building, for example, has been
dubbed "Kant Be Done", and the climb
over Memorial Church is known as
"Stairway to Heaven."
The most difficult climb, according to
Collins, is "Genocide", which is located
on Building 260 in the Quad. "It is the
most difficult buildering problem in the
world, and has only been fully com
pleted once,"he said.
Buildering at Stanford has had a long
history, according to Larson. "One pro
fessor said there have been builderers
here since he was an undergraduate,"
he said.
Through the years, the University has
not paid much attention to the
builderers. "The administration is usu
ally indifferent to what we do, as long as
it is not dangerous or we are not inter
rupting classes," said Collins.
One area now off limits to builderers,
however, is Memorial Church. "Tour
ists and the people at the church didn't
like the chalk marks,"said Collins.
"Also, there was an incident three
vears ago during a Christmas service.
During Mass, a builderer's silhouette
suddenly appeared through a stained
glass window. I guess the people in the
church were not too pleased by that,"
said Collins.
"Once I was climbing on Mem Chu
when a priest walked out and stared up
at me, " said Collins. "I told him: 'Don't
mind me father, I'm on the Stairway to
Heaven.' He just glared."

STANFORD DRIVES SOME PEOPLE UP THE WALLS! — Many students have en

can be seen scaling almost any building around campus, especially those in the
Quad.
