# Service charges indirectly benefit Bookstore shoppers

### Steve Trousdale 
In an effort to defray costs
and redirect services where
they are needed, the Book
store lias toughened its policies
on returned textbooks and the
use of credit cards, according
to Eldon Speed, manager of the
Bookstore.
A 50 cent re-shelving fee was
instituted on returned text
hooks in order to discourage
students from buying books for
classes they were not sure they
were taking. This practice often
created an artificial shortage of

textbooks and created prob
lems for studens who were def
initely taking the class, Speed
said.
Also new this year is a min
imum charge on the use of ma
jor credit cards, such as Master-
Card and Visa and exclusion of
crediVcard purchases from the
Bookstore's book rebate pro
gram, in which customers re
ceive a percentage of the total
v.i'ue of their book purchases
as a year-end rebate.
The minimum rate was in
stituted, according to Speed,

because the rates charged by
the credit card companies de
pends in part on the size of the
average voucher on each
charge card purchase.
Because the Bookstore pays
more money on credit card
purchases than on cash or
check purchases, the new "no
rebate" system makes charge
card customers "foot the bill"
for their purchases.
Though the Bookstore has
seen no decrease in business
because of the service change,
cash register personnel said

there have been many com
plaints about the minimum
charge requirement.
The Bookstore's goal, ac
cording to Speed, was "to
strive to provide books for stu
dents on the first day of class."
Under the old system, the
Bookstore often had to reorder
out-of-stock books, which
would then take several weeks
to arrive. In the meantime,
many of the same books would
be returned to the store, creat
ing a surplus.
As a result of the charges, the

Bookstore has this year ex
perienced a drop in textbook
returns from 8000 returned last
vear to less than one-third of
that figure.
There have been a few com
plaints about the fee. One stu
dent suggested that "as long as
the students bring the books
they don't want in . . . good
condition, (the Bookstore)
should accept them." Taking
and dropping classes was quite
natural ..in a University-ac
ademic environment," and the
reshelving fee disrupted this

atmosphere, he said.
Because students often
charged purchases of less than
$1, the Bookstore instituted the
minimum charge to discourage
this practice and increase the
size of an average charge card
purchase.
While charge-card cus
tomers are now asked to help
defray the cost of the use of
their cards, students are forced
by the reshelving fee to buy
textbooks more wisely, Speed
said.
