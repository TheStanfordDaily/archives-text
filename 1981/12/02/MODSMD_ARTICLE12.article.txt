## Bill Peatman Reexamine personal fortune 
### 
As usual, this year's Thanksgiving
turned out to be a real feast. We had
turkey, wine, pumpkin pie, and Aunt
Lucy saying "I really shouldn't!"
before each bite. As I ate, though, I
kept remembering last week's Fast
Day and that I'd fasted in the interest
of affirming the supreme value of ev
ery human being on this planet.
I couldn't help but wonder why,
on Thanksgiving, we annually give
thanks for what we have by consum
ing two or three times more food
than we usually would.
A strange process seems to take
place whenever we gain some kind
of advantages over others — after a
while, we convince ourselves than
we deserve our advantages. I see this
process at work in my own life. The
more time I spend at Stanford, the
less concern I have for those people
who have not had the good fortune
to become as educated as I am be
coming.
Somehow, by virtue of receiving
certain distinguishing advantages
such asanencouraging family, finan
cial security, and an uninterrupted
education, I've persuaded myself
that I am in some way superior to
those who have not had such advan
tages. Thus I deserve all that I can ac
quire, since people who prove to be
valuable will get what their worth de
mands.
At home, I find myself becoming
less and less interested in my old
friends, and at the same time I'm be
coming more and more comfortable
around them. As my friends at home
remain impressed by my presence at
Stanford, I don't seem to make much
effort at relating to them — there's
no need to, they're already im
pressed.
So, each November, instead of
going home to give thanks for my
good fortune, I end up patting myself
on the back for being such a person,
and I do this by overindulging in

what I've been given and by using my
friends and relatives for an ego boost.
Maybe this kind of feeling of supe
riority is deserved. We all had to work
hard to get into Stanford — we
earned it, right? Well, of course we
did, and continue to work hard, but
the fact that we are able to work at all,
and that we can secure the benefits
from our work that we are in the
process of securing, can hardly be at
tributed to ourselves. Most of us
were born into families that are eco
nomically healthy.
Certainly we did nothing to earn
the conditions into which we were
born; just as children in East Africa
did nothing to deserve a life of hard
ship and starvation. I suppose I could
argue that I squirmed out of the

womb very smoothly and with a
unique integrity, so that my mother
encouraged me more than other pa
rents encouraged their less coopera
tive children, but it seems unlikely.
In the end, I can't think of anything
that I have that was not given to me in
some way. If I have some innate gifts
or talents, they were given to me at
birth, and have nothing to do with
any personal merit. If I use what is
given to me in order to earn money,
should I praise myself, or should I be
thankful for what I was lucky enough
to receive?
Mv tendency is always to take the
credit for something that I have re
ceived. It's sort of like bragging about
going through a successful opera
tion, with "The doctor was okay, but I
lay on the table unconscious really
well!" attitude.
As if receiving help and being

cured showed some inherent human
superiority on my part. I always want
to claim ownership of what's been
Riven to me, for possessions, whether
thev are money, talents, degrees, or
whatever, are what we can use to set
ourselves above other people. I
Kuessthis Thanksgiving helped meto
realize some of the implications of
this wav of thinking.
Even as a nation, we have been giv
en many advantages like an abun
dance of resources and an abun
dance of resourceful people. But we
have proceeded to claim what's been
given to us as something that we de
served as an intrinsically more valu
able people. Thus we can place
ourselves above other nations and
use them to build our own country

up — the United States continues to
import more food from developing
countries than it exports tothem, etc.
After receiving some material ad
vantages over others, we claim that
we only get what is owed to us as
more worthy people.
Exploitation is easy if you're con
vinced that those who you are ex
ploiting are somehow less valuable
than you are. Perhaps we need to re
examine just where our advantages
in life really come from.
Mavbe then we will be able to
adopt a more humane policy towards
the deprived people of the world, so
we can give out of our excesses in
thanksgiving, rather than consume
our excesses in unreasonable self
praise.

that I am in some way superior to
those who have not had such advan
tages. Thus I deserve all that I can ac
quire, since people who prove to be
valuable will get what their worth de
mands.
At home, I find myself becoming
less and less interested in my old
friends, and at the same time I'm be
coming more and more comfortable
around them. As my friends at home
remain impressed by my presence at
Stanford, I don't seem to make much
effort at relating to them — there's
no need to, they're already im
pressed.
So, each November, instead of
going home to give thanks for my
good fortune, I end up patting myself
on the back for being such a person,
and I do this by overindulging in

what I've been given and by using my
friends and relatives for an ego boost.
Maybe this kind of feeling of supe
riority is deserved. We all had to work
hard to get into Stanford — we
earned it, right? Well, of course we
did, and continue to work hard, but
the fact that we are able to work at all,
and that we can secure the benefits
from our work that we are in the
process of securing, can hardly be at
tributed to ourselves. Most of us
were born into families that are eco
nomically healthy.
Certainly we did nothing to earn
the conditions into which we were
born; just as children in East Africa
did nothing to deserve a life of hard
ship and starvation. I suppose I could
argue that I squirmed out of the

thankful for what I was lucky enough

Kuessthis Thanksgiving helped meto
realize some of the implications of
this wav of thinking.
Even as a nation, we have been giv
en many advantages like an abun
dance of resources and an abun
dance of resourceful people. But we
have proceeded to claim what's been
given to us as something that we de
served as an intrinsically more valu

ourselves above other nations and
use them to build our own country

up — the United States continues to
import more food from developing
countries than it exports tothem, etc.

vantages over others, we claim that
we only get what is owed to us as

Exploitation is easy if you're con

than you are. Perhaps we need to re
examine just where our advantages
in life really come from.

adopt a more humane policy towards
the deprived people of the world, so
we can give out of our excesses in
thanksgiving, rather than consume
our excesses in unreasonable self
praise.

As usual, this year's Thanksgiving
turned out to be a real feast. We had
turkey, wine, pumpkin pie, and Aunt
Lucy saying "I really shouldn't!"
before each bite. As I ate, though, I
kept remembering last week's Fast
Day and that I'd fasted in the interest
of affirming the supreme value of ev
ery human being on this planet.
I couldn't help but wonder why,
on Thanksgiving, we annually give
thanks for what we have by consum
ing two or three times more food
than we usually would.
A strange process seems to take
place whenever we gain some kind
of advantages over others — after a
while, we convince ourselves than
we deserve our advantages. I see this
process at work in my own life. The
more time I spend at Stanford, the
less concern I have for those people
who have not had the good fortune
to become as educated as I am be
coming.
Somehow, by virtue of receiving
certain distinguishing advantages
such asanencouraging family, finan
cial security, and an uninterrupted
education, I've persuaded myself
that I am in some way superior to
those who have not had such advan
tages. Thus I deserve all that I can ac
quire, since people who prove to be
