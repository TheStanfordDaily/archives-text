## Hostility won't abolish violence 
### 
As a member of the Stanford com
munity, I am concerned with the re
cent tone of Daily columns and let
ters concerning rape, relations be
tween men and women, and person
al safety. The tension between men
and women here these days is very
disconcerting, and I wish to make a
few comments about this.
There is absolutely no question
that the recent attacks on women are
an outrage to the community. As a
person, not just as a male, such at
tacks and violations of personal pride
sicken me, and I feel very helpless in
trying to vent my frustration without
stereotyping or blaming in
discriminately. I have discussed the
problem with many people and have
made some personal decisions to
work towards a safer Stanford. In this
way, I feel that I am trying to combat
the problem.
However, I honestly do not be
lieve, and have never believed, that
hostility and name calling help to
solve problems. It is very difficult to
discuss sensitive issues and decide on

some course of action when
hostilities between people are high.
I can understand why women feel
hostile towards men here, and I can
also understand why men feel de
fensive and self-conscious in re
sponse to this. Yet, to build a com
munity, and to try to effectively deal
with these problems, men and wom
en need to sit down together, not mi
grate away.
I felt that the anonymous letter re
cently published (Daily, Nov. 24) was
an appeal to men to stop "protecting
(themselves) from the burdenof cop
ing with the consequences of (their)
actions," and to honestly and serious
ly re-evaluate their own personal
views towards women.
Though it's very difficult to dosuch
soul-searching in the face of 18 units
and a Chem problem set, one major
reason we are all here is to learn
about ourselves and why we think
and act like we do. Empathy, is the
key to this process. Thus — as the let
ter tries to convey — imagine what it
is like to have an abortion, to

menstruate, or to be continually ster
eotyped.
In addition, Mark Boehm's letter,
in the same issue, also appeals to
women tr» nnt Khmp all men for the
deeds of an abhorrent few. He
stresses that there are many men at
Stanford who are supportive of wom
en and their fears of safety, and who
are trying to work towards min
imizing, if not eliminating them.
Once again, I emphasize emphathy
over hostility; society as a whole con
demns rape and it isourcollective re
sponsibility to bring this fact to public
attention.
Finally, I make my own personal
appeal: let the hostilities cease. The
noontime rally of Nov. 12 was a step
in the right direction; support,
education, and awareness will help
solve the problems we face. Only if
we sit in the middle of the road, not at
its extremes, can we effectively deal
with such violent crime here. Hatred
and mistrust never solved a thing.
