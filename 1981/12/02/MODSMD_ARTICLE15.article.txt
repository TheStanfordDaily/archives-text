## Selfish moral codes unjust 
### 
I am sad because of our society. I am sad because
women cannot walk alone around this campus safely,
because people feel the need to carry keys for locks
which are supposed to protect them and their belong
ings, and because at any moment a powerful political
leader has the ability to make a choice which could lead
to global destruction. What saddens me more than all
this is that we, as a people, have no resource other than
sadness. We have no basis for justice.
I am not considering justice as a set of decisions which
are made in accordance with a body of laws. Rather, I am
considering a standard against which laws, actions, and
attitudes must be tested to ascertain whether they are
just.
When modern Americans must consider the rapes,
thefts, and killings present in the world today, they usual
ly conclude that such actions are unjust. However, they
cannot find anything in their world view which would al
low them to honestly conclude that some actions are tru
ly unjust.
Most people's moral code could be summarized by
the statement, "There are no absolute values; whatever I
do is all right as long as I don't hurt anyone else." There
are two serious flaws in using this view as a basis for jus
tice.
One flaw with this is that the value of not hurting oth
ers is not usually the product of a well-thought-out
world view, but is often affirmed because it is a position
which offers comfort. Some would say that not hurting
others is a necessity for society to run smoothly, but
there are no apparent reasons for seeing a smoothly
running society as intrinsically valuable.
Values are not things which can be measured or ob
served, but they exist because people attach value to
things, attitudes, and actions. For any value to have sig
nificance, it must have a source outside of some person's
arbitrarv choice.
To some people, my describing these decisions as arbi
trary seems absurd. After all, do we not have human rea
son to show us how to live? The problem is that we all do
in fact have our reason, and there is no evidence that the
morality of Charles Manson was based any less on hu
man reason than that of Martin Luther King, Jr.
The real history of the real world is filled with examples
of people who have shown by various actions (and even
more by attitudes) that they do not affirm the value of
human life. It would be difficult to determine which
would be the exception and which the rule. We must
have a standard outside of human reason to determine
whether one person's reason has been used more justly
than another's.
Thus, we are back to the problem of wishing that we
could sav that King's morality was in some way superior

to Manson's, but finding no basis for this view other than
personal whim.
There is a second major flaw with the statement
"Whatever I do is all right as long as I don't hurt anyone
else" which should be a concern of anyone who makes
the statement. The problem is that most people never at
tempt to consider the full implications of the statement.
Could hurting someone be the result of a choice to
spend time studying for that all-important final rather
than with someone who communicates an immediate
need for someone to talk to.
Doctors who choose to enter the crowded, high
paying world of middle-class American medicine may be
hurting people in Appalachia, India, and all over the
world who suffer from a lack of medical help.
Many business people choose to work for large corpo
rations which are at the core of the worldwide economic
structure which relies on exploiting or, at best, ignoring
the needs of the poor in order to increase the luxuries of
the rich. The extravagant lifestyle (by worldwide stan
dards) of most Americans is surely costing other people
throughout the world.
Many Stanford students express the desire to help oth
ers once they have achieved their own security. How
ever, we need to make a clear distinction between secur
ity and competition, since they are almost universally
confused in America. Success is to be our goal and is to
be measured by the number of cars and homes we own
and by the number of digits in our savings accounts and
investment portfolios.
To illustrate the difficulty that Stanford students are
likely to have in defining security, I consider how many
times I hear "I failed my midterm" when the speaker
means that he or she did not get an A. If we cannot find
success academically in anything less than straight As, it
will surely be hard for us to see comfort as anything less
than all the money and possessions we can grab.
Those who find a sense of justice an important part of
the way they view the world should carefully evaluate
the attitudes about success and security which are so
deeply rooted in our society. We will find it difficult to
make these evaluations because of the way we have
been trained to think.
When we look around us we see people being
motivated by a desire to accumulate emotional, intellec
tual, and material gains for themselves. This motivation
can be seen as the foundation for the very thing which
strikes us as most unjust, the lack of concern for other
people. However, our society accepts no standard for
justice against which we can test the motivations and ac
tions of people and find them truly unjust.
