## Irresponsibility painful, but part of growing up 
### 
Letter to a Stanford Woman:
I was moved by your anonymous
letter (Daily, Nov. 24). As the mother
of three daughters I am very aware
that any of my daughters is as vulner
able as you were to the timeless trag
edy of an unwanted pregnancy.
As their mother, I have the choice
of couselling them to avoid sex or ad
vising them to learn effective birth
control measures. I have chosen to
advise the latter.
While I am as angry as you are at
the callous irresponsibility shown
towards you by your "boy" friend,

and am as unwilling as you to relieve
him of any of the responsibilities he
should have borne once you became
pregnant, I must tell you that you are
as responsible as he — perhaps more
so since it is agreed that he could not
become pregnant — for not taking
sexual relations seriously enough to
seriously try to prevent conception.
You never mention birth control in
your letter and I shall assume that if
some measure was used, it proved in
effective. Nevertheless, the bottom
line remains the same. You chose to
have intercourse, you chose an im
mature partner, and you became

pregnant. Nothing in life is free and
while I do not recommend
abstinence, you must be prepared to
bear the consequences of your
choices and actions.
If you were my daughter, I'd hold
you in my arms and try to ease your
pain, the pain of hurt and betrayal. I
wouldn't say, "don't do it again" be
cause in time there will be another
love affair.
I'd try to make sure you under
stood the risk to yourself by not using
proper birth control measures and
I'd try my best to impart some of the
wisdom it is impossible for any of us
to know at your age: that sex is not a
matter of technique and experience
but isa qualitiative act that has mean
ing because of an emotional bond
two people share, even if it is not for
ever.
Maturity comes when one is able
to exercise the best possible
judgment as to choice of partner and
risks involved. Maturity, however,
comes slowly, and life is often painful
during the learning process.
When you heal, please be kind to
yourself.

The anonymous "Letter to a Stan
ford boy" (Daily, Nov. 24) is the best
letter I have ever read in your paper
for at least five years! This woman's
all too common predicament is just

one of the end results of our "benign
neglect" social attitudes.
"How come she let him do it," etc.
allows us to ignore our collective
contribution to society's hypocrisy,
which in turn makes such pregnan
cies more probable.
"Adult" society can't even talk
honestly about drunk driving. Stan
ford just lost two athletes because of
this, and the media treated it as a
tragedy that "happened" to "un
fortunate victims." Hence, since sex
is a "Christian no-no," how can we
ever expect to deal with sexual mat
ters honestly and intelligently?

its diagram of the Diablo Canyon

flip it when youshould have. The dia

"flipped both horizontally and ver

I think you're in cahoots with one
of my professors. He told me last
week (when I used an authoritative

Best letter
The anonymous "Letter to a Stan
ford boy" (Daily, Nov. 24) is the best
letter I have ever read in your paper
for at least five years! This woman's
all too common predicament is just

one of the end results of our "benign
neglect" social attitudes.
"How come she let him do it," etc.
allows us to ignore our collective
contribution to society's hypocrisy,
which in turn makes such pregnan
cies more probable.
"Adult" society can't even talk
honestly about drunk driving. Stan
ford just lost two athletes because of
this, and the media treated it as a
tragedy that "happened" to "un
fortunate victims." Hence, since sex
is a "Christian no-no," how can we
ever expect to deal with sexual mat
ters honestly and intelligently?

Vertical flip
Vou need a John Horn on your
staff. Pacific Gas and Electric flipped
its diagram of the Diablo Canyon
containment chambers when it
shouldn't have — you neglected to
flip it when youshould have. The dia
gram you describe as having been
"flipped both horizontally and ver
tically" was shown flipped only ver
tically.
I think you're in cahoots with one
of my professors. He told me last
week (when I used an authoritative
source for a formula which was in
correct) not to believe what I read
and here you are proving him right.
