# Committee to study grad housing
## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
\ new committee designed to de
termine the need for additional grad
uate student housing here is now
being formed, Assistant Dean of Stu
dents Rodger Whitney said yester
day.
According to Whitney, the com
mittee will first examine short and
long term demands for more gradu
ate student housing on campus. If the
committee determines a need for ad
ditional housing, it will later make
recommendations concerning the
quantity and type of the new com
plexes.
The formation of the committee is
partly in response to grad students'
protests that the University doesn't
consider their housing needs as im
portant as those of undergraduates
and faculty. For example, the new
Stanford West condominiums near
the Medical Center will technically
have room for graduates, but the
University will give priority for hous

ing to faculty members.
"I don't know how a graduate stu
dent could afford to buy .Â» con
dominium anyway," said Eric Berg,
treasurer of the Graduate Student
Association.
Graduate students also are con
cr rned hei a use of tne recent imposi
tion of i one-year limit on their guar
anteed housing. I nder the new time
lii nt, first year grad students are re
sf r I'd a space on campus, but must
V- '< < a lottery for housing for subse
cjuent years.
In ,i meeting with representatives
oi the Graduate Student Association
ve (erday, Whitney said the new $36
million undergraduate housing
project now under construction was
four years in planning, arid the
potential new graduate housing
could take as long. Whitney also said
it was difficult to predict what future
housing needs here will be.
The GSA representatives agreed
the committee is needed in or

dor for the graduate housing short
,ii;p to be reduced.
"I think it's a necessary first step
towards constructing new graduate
housing," s.iid Berg. But Berg said he
had some doubts whether the Uni
versity would actually be able to pro
duce the necessary funding.
The final draft of the charge for the
committee is still being composed.
The completed charge will first go to
the nominating committee of the
ASSIJ for recommendations of stu
dent committee members. Univer
sity faculty and staff will also be in
volved on the committee, and
Whitney s.nd ideally all graduate
constituencies, such as married and
foreign students, will be repre
sented
Whitney also suggested the com
mittee might look at the possibility of
integrating the graduate and under
graduate housing programs.
"There's some interest in that right
now," he said. "We'll certainly look

into that possibility."
But he added that the two pro
grams .ire very different, and a com
bination of them will mean the crea
tion of an entirely new housing sys
tem.
Berg said the potential combina
tion (if the graduate and under
graduate housing programs had
caused many graduates to be sus
picious of the University's motives
For example, last year the Escondido
Village rents were raised right after
the announcement of the Univer
sity's intention to construct ne\\ un
dergraduate dorms.
"Basically people were saving they
were raising graduate students' rents
in order to build undergraduate
dorms," he said. But Berg said the
possibility of having graduate stu
dents live in formerly undergraduate
housing, such as theme houses,
would benefit all the students in
volved.
