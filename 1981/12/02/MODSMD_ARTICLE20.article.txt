# Cities gently protest Reagan
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Detroit— Local government leaders po
litely criticized major aspects of President
Ronald Reagan's domestic program but
avoided an all-out assault on an adminis
tration dedicated to sharply reducing their
share of federal spending.
The administration, however, seemed
unappreciative of the politeness shown at
the National League of Cities annual con
vention. As an indication of where the
meeting of 3000 mayors and city council
members stands on the White House
priority list, Vice President George Bush
and four Cabinet-level officials, including
Secretary Samuel Pierce of the Depart
ment of Housing and Urban Affairs, re
fused invitations.
And Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), who
heads Reagan's commission on federalism,
made it clear in a speech and at a news con
ference that the administration's plans to
consolidate several grant programs, and
giving states and cities much more author
ity for them, "may mean less money" for
local government.
"We may be giving them too much au
thority and not enough money," Laxalt
said. But he told reporters that plans could
be revised later if spending cutbacks
proved too severe.
League of Cities President William Hud

nut, the Republican mayor of Indianapolis,
said turning present federal authority over
to the cities means "local government in
the future is going to be a growth industry
in terms of responsibility," with citizens
having a greater opportunity to shape poli
cies.
But Hudnut was clearly annoyed at the
failure of the administration to send a top
level domestic affairs spokesman. "This is
not a pipefitters' convention,"he told a re
porter. "I think they missed a good op
portunity...l'm disappointed."
Despite Hudnut's disappointment, the
league did not vary much from its past pol
icy of conciliation toward the Reagan ad
ministration.
That reflects the tastes of a group that
contains many suburban officials, many of
them Republicans, who agree
philosophically with the president and
whose relatively affluent communities will
not be hurt by Reagan's domestic cut
backs.
The league's attitude is in contrast to the
LJ.S. Conference of Mayors, dominated
largely by Democratic big-city mayors who
are harsh Reagan critics.
As an example of the league's attitude,
the resolutions committee postponed in
definitely a resolution calling on the ad
ministration and Congress "lo fundamen

l.illv restructure our national priorities by
drastically cutting the military budget
through the cessation of military support
for the various dictatorships we currently
fin,incc throughout the world and through
honest and bold negotiations with the So
viet Union and the other nuclear powers
to end the production of nuclear weap
ons."
The committee adopted resolutions
criticizing key parts of the Reagan pro
gram, but none was accompanied by any
anti-Reagan rhetoric.
The resolutions committee called on the
administration to continue federal operat
ing subsidies for masstransit. Reagan's sec
retary of transportation, Drew Lewis, op
poses such subsidies, saying that the feder
al government should help finance con
struction, buses and other capital expen
ditures but not daily operations.
Disagreeing with the president's much
stated faith in state government — a view
he gained in his years as governor of Cali
fornia — the resolutions committee said
"states should be encouraged to provide
additional business investment incentives
and enterprise zone program support to
local governments but should not have
veto power over eligibility or application
procedures."
