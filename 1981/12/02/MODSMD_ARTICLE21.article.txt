# Florio drops challenge in NJ race
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
New York— It took almost four weeks
from election day, but the citizens of New
Jersey finally learned who won their Nov. 3
vote for governor — moderate Republican
Thomas Kean.
Democratic candidate James Florio, who
earlier had said he might ask the courts to
order a new election, conceded defeat af
ter a laborious ballot-by-ballot recount —
and charges that white Republican vigi
lantes had intimidated black Democratic
voters — failed to shake his opponent's
lead.
Kean, a former speaker of the state As
sembly, won by 1677 votes out of 2.29 mil
lion cast, a margin of less than 0.1 percent.
National implications
"It is clear what the result is," Florio said,
with bitterness tinging his voice, "...by a
small margin, they (the voters) have ac
cepted Tom Kean's set of answers."
In advance, both Republican and Dem
ocratic party leaders had said the election
would have national implications. The Re
publicans had hoped for a strong Kean
margin as a vote of confidence in President
Ronald Reagan, and Democrats had billed
a Florio victory as a repudiation of Rea
gan's economic policies.
The voters gave neither party what it ex
pected. Kean's 50.007 percent of the vote
in unofficial returns was an ambiguous
slide from the president's 52.8 percent
showing in the state in the 1980 election.
Recount unfinished
All that was clearly confirmed was the
unpredictability of the New Jersey elec
torate. The state has split tickets consistent
ly since 1968, simultaneously giving ma
jorities to Republican presidents and
Democratic legislators.
The political organization in the state is
largely Democratic, working off a solid

power base of generations-old Democrats,
although the new conservative tide has
given rise to a set of "gypsy moth" Re
publicans, and even installed a few more
traditional line figures such as Millicent
Fenwick and others.
Florio, a congressman from the southern
city of Camden, threw in the towel with
the recount still unfinished in four of New
Jersey's 21 counties, some of which were
part of his south Jersey powerbase — but
only a day before the state's Board of Can
vassers was to certify Kean asthe winneron
the basisof the initial, unofficial count. The
board is required by law to certify a gov
ernor-elect within 28 days of the election.
The incomplete recount, for which
Florio's campaign will be billed about
$40,000, had added at least 140 votes to
Kean's total, election officials said.

The long delay between
the election and final
count was filled with
charges and
countercharges.

Charges of intimidation
The long delay between the election
and final count was filled with charges and
countercharges by the two candidates,
none of which now seem likely to amount
to anything, even in view of their severity.
Two days after the vote, Florio charged
that the Republicans had sent dozens of
men, some armed with pistols, to stand
guard at polling places in Democratic pre
cincts in "a conscious effort to intimidate"
black voters.
A spokesman for Kean, Carl Golden,
confirmed that the armed guards — mem

bers of a so-called National Ballot Security
Task Force — had been recruited, or
ganized and paid by the Republican Na
tional Committee. The guards, whose
leaders included Anthony Imperiale, a
state assemblyman from Newark who once
headed a white vigilante group, stood out
side polling places in largely Democratic
areas, including several black neighbor
hoods,
Racial pressure?
Golden said the guards had been in
structed only to observe the vote and re
port on any possible instances of election
fraud. He said he had received reports that
"strange things" had happened to
absentee ballots in Democratic areas. But
Florio and a coalition that included the
League of Women Voters, the New jersey
Council of Churches and the Urban
League said that instances of intimidation
had been reported.
"There were four or five men standing
around the polling place," said a black vot
er's affidavit released by the community
groups. "Most of the men were white.
They were telling people not to go into
the polling places because the polling ma
chines were broken and because it was too
crowded inside...There was nothing
wrong with the polling machines, and the
polling site was not crowded."
The chairman of the Republican Na
tional Committee, Richard Richards of
Utah, also defended the task force — but
later suspended the head of the group, a
former White House aide named John Kel
ly, when he learned that Kelly may have
falsely claimed to hold a law degree.
Kellv worked for the White House for
four months earlier this year as an in
vestigator checking the political back
grounds of Reagan appointees to federal
positions, White House officials have said.
