### Washington Post 
Cincinnati— President Ronald Reagan
ended his California vacation yesterday and
immediately launched a newattackon his po
litical foes whom he described as the"spend
thrift fraternity."
Reagan strongly defended his recent veto
of a continuing budget resolution that started
a shutdown of non-essential functions of the
federal government. He also pledged not to
retreat from economic policies based on low
ering taxes and cutting government spend
ing.
Reagan named no members of the spend
thrift fraternity but appeared to include Re
publican Everett Dirksen, the late Senate mi
nority leader from Illinois.
The president deplored those who
criticized his decision to veto the budget res
olution over a difference of only a few billion
dollars.
He asked how anyone could use the word
"mere" to describe numbers as large as
billions and paraphrased as coming from a
member of the spendthrift fraternity
Dirksen's famous remark: "A billion here, a
billion there, and pretty soon it adds up to
real money."
The president told a Republican fund-rais

inn reception attended by about 250 people
here that his opponents have no new ideas
but want "a return to their bankrupt policies
of higher taxes and higher spending."
Reagan said the veto was essential to keep
the budget under control. The difference be
tween his final position and what Congress
offered him was about $2.5 billion. Reagan
Mondav night cited the almost $10 billion dif
ference between his Sept. 24 position and
what Congress sent him.
Reagan denounced the "tax-and-tax,
spend-and-spend policies of our opponents"
and pointed out that the federal government
has not had a budget for 14 months.
The federal budget, he said, is out in "the
wild blue yonder."
The president ended his speech by saying
he is receiving "wonderful letters" of support
from Americans around the country, includ
ing a letter in Braille from a former Gl who
lost his sight during World War 11. Reagan said
the blind man "wrote in Braille to tell me that
if cutting his pension would help get this
country back on its feet, he'd like to have me
cut his pension.
"... We're not going to cut his pension. But
we're sure going to get this country back on
its feet."
