# Spacey students: a campus group is concerned with space development

While movies like Star Wars / and II
and 2001: A Space Odyssey which de
pict intergalactic dictators, outer space
miners, cosmic transport operators, and
solar scientists are box office smashes,
merchants are having trouble keeping
enough space-oriented games on their
shelves. And according to Karen Mc-
Grade, president of Stanford Students
for Space Development (SSSD), there
will lie numerous areas opening for
work in the field in the next 50 years.
"As an organization, we want Stan
ford students to be aware of these op
portunities," said McGrade, a first year
graduate student in material science.
The objectives of SSSD are to provide
information and sponsor activities con
cerning space development, she said.
The organization is looking forward
to bringing Art Dula, one of the few
space lawyers in America, to campus to
lecture later this year. As a space lawyer,
Dula researches the legal implications
of a space venture — such as a corpo
ration or group wanting to launch a
privately-funded rocket — and then
writes an appropriate contract.
SSSD is also involved in arranging for
students to fly an experiment on the

space shuttle. Faculty advisor Peter
Banks of the radio science department
is professionally involved with a NASA
sponsored experiment that will be
aboard the next space shuttle.

T he SSSD has not yet purchased room
on the next U.S. space shuttle from the
government, but thev plan to obtain a
sponsor from one of several companies
that have already reserved space

aboard the shuttle, according to Mc-
Grade.
If SSSD presents a valid proposition,
she said, a company will likely donate
the room for the experiment in order to
bolster their public relations image.
Though SSSD has not yet decided
upon an experiment, McGrade hopes
an idea will be finalized by Christmas.
SSSD is also working on the develop
ment of a summer studv program which
will focus upon the barriers to com
mercial development of space. Accord
ing to McGrade 'hoi, tentative plans
are to bring tonrlher enticpreneurs,
businessmen, .u .idemians, .tnd stu
dents in .i six-week program.
McGrade said she hopes the study,
which will encompass the economic,
legal and political aspectsof space com
mercialization, will clarifv problems
and"mavbe come up with some solu
tions."
SSSD was founded by Michael Simon,
a former Stanford student, who taught a
class in space colonization. Witnessing
the good turnout for his course, Simon
realized that there was a strong interest
in the space program and began the or
ganization, which now has about 200
members.
