## Cardinal opens with respectable showing in tourney Women's basketball team optimistic for season 
### Sally Jenkins 
In it's second week of regular
season play, Stanford's often
forgotten women's basketball
team travels south Friday to
face Long Beach State and (JSC,
both of which are ranked in the
top 10.
The lighter shade of Cardinal
basketball returns to regular
season play with a wealth of ex
perience, and something that
used to be wishful thinking:
depth. With three seniors and
two juniors in the starting line
up and two former starters re
turning as bar kups, head coach
Dotty McCrea can't help sing
ing "so long bad times."
Bearing the mark of chosen
favorite to take the NorCal
league championship this sea

son, the Cardinal squad is led
by senior center Louise Smith,
and junior center Kim Kup
ferer. Both Smith and Kupferer
were chosen to the all-tour
nament team at the Anheiser-
Busch Invitational last week,
Stanford's season-opening ap
pearance.
The Cardinal turned in a re
spectable performance in its
debut, held at San Jose State
Nov. 20, 21. Stanford placed
third in a field of four teams
that included San Jose State,
the University of Texas, and
Weber State. After losing to
Texas in the first round, the
Card went on to beat Weber
State. Texas took tho tourney
(rown in a final versus the host
ing souad.

In the rest of the lineup, sen
iors Debbie Gore and Ann
Miller hold down the fort at
guards, and junior Meg
Met/ger filling out the squad at
forward. In addition, former
starting center and leading
scorer Jeanne Ruark-Hoff has
returned to the squad after
redshirting a year to get mar
tied Also returning after a
year's absence is former start
ing guard and one-time
freshman sensation Angie Pac
cione.
I he toughest match of the
weekend most probably will be
I ISC, which boasts a dual threat
in a set of 6-foot-3 twins named
Pain .tnd Paula McGee. The
Trojans are the N0.4 team in

the nation and, not surprising
ly, are strong on the inside.
The Long Beach contest
should be a direct contrast. The
49ers have more diffuse talent,
and plenty of speed The main
problem for the Cardinal will
be outscoring them, which,
111 c kilv enough for McCrea, is a
distinct possibility. All of the
starting five but Miller aver
<iged double figures in the San
lose tournament, and even
Miller was close, with a 9-point
average.
"I think we can play with
both of them," said McCrea.
"We played well in San Jose,
and we've got experience,
which really makes a dif
ference."
