## Jack and John— A modern day tragedy 
### 
lICT ION: The following story is true.
Only the names have been changed to
make you think they're people yon
know:
Once upon a time, in a land far, far
away (something along the lines of
Bakersfield), there was a father and son
named Jack and John.
Jack, a likable, intelligent man, wasa,
uh, high school football coach. And his
son John, a blond-haired, blue-eyed
kid with an oversized right arm, was the
star quarterback at a bigger high school
across town.
Everything was just great for the
father and son. Both of their teams

press conference to say he was
interested in the big school. The school
had a press conference tosay they were
glad Jack was interested. Jack's wife had
a press conference to say she was
interested, but made it clear she wasn't
very fond of the school's colors, which
were blue and gold. The school had
another press conference to announce
