## Jack and John— A modern day tragedy 
### 
lICT ION: The following story is true.
Only the names have been changed to
make you think they're people yon
know:
Once upon a time, in a land far, far
away (something along the lines of
Bakersfield), there was a father and son
named Jack and John.
Jack, a likable, intelligent man, wasa,
uh, high school football coach. And his
son John, a blond-haired, blue-eyed
kid with an oversized right arm, was the
star quarterback at a bigger high school
across town.
Everything was just great for the
father and son. Both of their teams
usually did pretty well. Once a year,
Jack's team played John's team, and
usually lost. But that was OK. The local
media ate it up, which was good
publicity, and besides, lack's school was
never known for its football team. It was

known for its. . .well, it wasn't known
for its football team.
But then one dav Jack's team up and
slew his son's. At first, everyone
thought it was a big joke; just a fluke.
But soon they won even more games
andeveryone realized the little guvs
were reallv good at football — Jack had
done them well.
Well, success was a funny thing in that
land. You see, the third high school in
town (which had been losing a lot of
games with a fancy offense called
"Hunt and Peck" or some such
nonsense) dec ided they wanted the
almighty Jack on theirside. They
figure l (J since he (Jid so well with the
other school, he might be able to
salvage their ailing program. And
besides, a bald columnist from a green
newspaper thought Jack was neat
So then came the press conferences.

I here were a lot of them, too. Jack had a
press conference to say he was
interested in the big school. The school
had a press conference tosay they were
glad Jack was interested. Jack's wife had
a press conference to say she was
interested, but made it clear she wasn't
very fond of the school's colors, which
were blue and gold. The school had
another press conference to announce
th.it, should they offer Jack a position,
which was not yet a certainty, they
might be willing to change their colors
to appease his wife.
112 his went on for some time, hut
nothing really substantial happened.
Soon, though, the press remembered
that John's school and the blue and
gold s< hool were arch rivals. They
played each other at the end of every
season, and the winner got to take
home a huge bronzed knife. So, more
press conferences were called.
"Jack, if you coach your son's arch
rival and he wins the game for his team
will vou send him to bed early without
any dinner?"
"Nocomment," he said.
Not long afterthat, though, jack did
have a comment. "I have decided to
abandon my coaching post at the
smaller team and go with the tacky blue

and gold team," he said. "I'm pr etty
happy with my decision. . I guess."
\s it turned out, jack's wife realized
that her husband's old school used blue
and gold, so she withdrew her earlier
statements. And in the meantime, lack
and John both prospered. Their teams
racked up win after win, giving the
Pretty Large Game added importance.
The teams battled down to the wire in
the final game. Losing by one point with
two seconds left, l.irk sent in his field
goal kicker, who cooly nailed a 65-yard

field goal through the uprightsfor the
victory.
Wrought with frustration, John,
pl.n ing the last game of his < areer,
found the traditional bronze knife and
plunged it into his father's heart, killing
him before 80,000 stunned onlookers.
John was sentenced to life
imprisonment for hisactions, and never
got to pl.n professional football or
baseball, his lifelong ambition. Plainly,
its a sad, sail day when family members
meet as arch rivals.

lICT ION: The following story is true.
Only the names have been changed to
make you think they're people yon
know:
Once upon a time, in a land far, far
away (something along the lines of
Bakersfield), there was a father and son
named Jack and John.
Jack, a likable, intelligent man, wasa,
uh, high school football coach. And his
son John, a blond-haired, blue-eyed
kid with an oversized right arm, was the
star quarterback at a bigger high school
across town.
Everything was just great for the
father and son. Both of their teams
usually did pretty well. Once a year,
Jack's team played John's team, and
usually lost. But that was OK. The local
media ate it up, which was good
publicity, and besides, lack's school was
never known for its football team. It was

known for its. . .well, it wasn't known
for its football team.
But then one dav Jack's team up and
slew his son's. At first, everyone
thought it was a big joke; just a fluke.
But soon they won even more games
andeveryone realized the little guvs
were reallv good at football — Jack had
done them well.
Well, success was a funny thing in that
land. You see, the third high school in
town (which had been losing a lot of
games with a fancy offense called
"Hunt and Peck" or some such
nonsense) dec ided they wanted the
almighty Jack on theirside. They
figure l (J since he (Jid so well with the
other school, he might be able to
salvage their ailing program. And
besides, a bald columnist from a green
newspaper thought Jack was neat
So then came the press conferences.

I here were a lot of them, too. Jack had a
press conference to say he was
interested in the big school. The school
had a press conference tosay they were
glad Jack was interested. Jack's wife had
a press conference to say she was
interested, but made it clear she wasn't
very fond of the school's colors, which
were blue and gold. The school had
another press conference to announce
th.it, should they offer Jack a position,
which was not yet a certainty, they
might be willing to change their colors
to appease his wife.
112 his went on for some time, hut
nothing really substantial happened.
Soon, though, the press remembered
that John's school and the blue and
gold s< hool were arch rivals. They
played each other at the end of every
season, and the winner got to take
home a huge bronzed knife. So, more
press conferences were called.
"Jack, if you coach your son's arch
rival and he wins the game for his team
will vou send him to bed early without
any dinner?"
"Nocomment," he said.
Not long afterthat, though, jack did
have a comment. "I have decided to
abandon my coaching post at the
smaller team and go with the tacky blue

and gold team," he said. "I'm pr etty
happy with my decision. . I guess."
\s it turned out, jack's wife realized
that her husband's old school used blue
and gold, so she withdrew her earlier
statements. And in the meantime, lack
and John both prospered. Their teams
racked up win after win, giving the
Pretty Large Game added importance.
The teams battled down to the wire in
the final game. Losing by one point with
two seconds left, l.irk sent in his field
goal kicker, who cooly nailed a 65-yard

field goal through the uprightsfor the
victory.
Wrought with frustration, John,
pl.n ing the last game of his < areer,
found the traditional bronze knife and
plunged it into his father's heart, killing
him before 80,000 stunned onlookers.
John was sentenced to life
imprisonment for hisactions, and never
got to pl.n professional football or
baseball, his lifelong ambition. Plainly,
its a sad, sail day when family members
meet as arch rivals.
