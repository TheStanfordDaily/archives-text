# ASSU, University budget talks stalled
## 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU is currently bogged
down in its financial negotiations
with the University because of "dif
fering philosophies," ASSU Financial
Manager Cynthia Mathewson told
the ASSU Senate last night.
According to Mathewson, the
ASSU believes the University should
support the executive, legislative, ju
dicial, and financial branches of the
ASSU as stipulated in the associa
tion's constitution. The University
wishes to only cover activities con
nected with banking services, asthi
have done for the past six years, sh•
said.
"Both sides know how each feels,
Mathewson said. "(The University) ■
trying to cut costs and it's hard fo
them to justify giving us the le'» of
thousands or whatever we net i
Mathewson said the Universit * had

pr vided for all services stipulated in
the constitution until the two-year
negotiations of 1975-76 when the
ASSU agreed to allow the University
to reduce its financial contribution.
At that time the ASSU was becoming
'more independent" bv making
profits in their Special Events-spon
sored concerts and the ASSU Travel
Service.
"We're not quite in that financial
situation anymore," Mathewsor
said. Both Special Events and th(
Travel Service are now defunct.
The question to be answered in the
i urrent negotiations is whether the
University will now follow the prece
dent it set in the 1975-76 negotiation
or return to its earlier funding basis a<
set up in the constitution.
Mathewson and other ASSU mem
bers are currently discussing the fi
nances with Thomas Massey, as

sociate dean of student affairs.
Mathewson said these talks were the
first level of University decision-mak
ing on the arrangement. She pre
dicted that the talk', would not be
completed this quarter as they were
originally scheduled.
M last night's meeting the ASSU
Senate may have found itself as
bogged down as the financial nego
tiations In the lengthy meeting, sen
tic action w«t- consistently stalled be
< ause of procedural difficulties, and
several \SSIJ members compared
the scene to the "long meetings of
last year " However, even with their
troubles, the senate did manage to
get all their action items through.
The senate approved a resolution
asking that the University either en
dorse the designation of Jan. 15,
Martin Luther King's birthday, as an
official observed holidav or at least
J

support a program recognizing King.
It also stated that the business
office would be closed Jan 15 of ev
ery year beginning in 1982 to observe
Martin l.uther King Day. The action
followed a speech by COP member
Fred Buhl.
Program fee funds were approved
for the Committee on Hunger and
Holiday House, a program of ac
t for students at Stanford over
C hristmas break. Holiday House re
ceived $W0 and the Committee on
Hunger received $400. A request
trom the Stanford Central American
Action Network (SCAAN) was sent
back to the finance committee to dis
cuss again. SCAAN had requested
55500.
In other *\SSU news, COP member
Chris Greene said that at yesterday's
Student Conduct Legislative Council
mooting a four-member committee
was authorized to investigate pos
sible legislation creating a committee
"that would in some way be brought
into action when an administrative
decision was about to be made or a
major sanction be made against a stu
dent group."
Greene also said the SCLC dis
cussed the issue of the need for a pol
icy dealing with University-student
group relations but "the sense of the
committee" was that such a policy
was probably not necessary consider
ing the few incidentsof University ac
tion against student groups.
"At this point though, (the issue) is
still open," Greene said.
