# Cal to choose coach this week
## 
### 
Berkeley (AP) — Athletic Di
rector L")ave Maggard hopes to
name a new head football
coach for the University of Cal
ifornia by the end of this week,
"I want it done by the end of
the week," said Maggard, who
said Tuesday that he has talked
with Wayne Howard since
Howard resigned as Utah
coach.
The leading candidates for
the Cal vacancy, however, still
appear to be former Cal quar
terback Joe Kapp and San Jose

State Coach Jack Elway. Mag
gard and Elway have met three
times since Roger Theder was
fired from the Cal job Nov. 23.
Elway, whose San Jose team
was 9-2 this season, would have
to get out of a long-term con
tract to take the Cal job.

Anaheim, Calif. (AP) —
Buzzie Bavasi, the executive
vice president of the California

Angels, met with free agent
outfielder-designated hitter
Reggie Jackson and the
player's agent for two hours
Monday and afterward seemed
optimistic about an agreement
being reached.
' Reggie feels this is the place
where he can be happy and so
do I," said Bavasi. "His agent
(Gary Walker) volunteered the
information that he would play
here for less, although I don't
interpret that to mean several
hundred-thousand less.
"I'll probably talk to Walker
again tomorrow, then, per
haps, later in the week."
Jackson had two meetings on
Monday, with Bavasi at
Anaheim Stadium and with At
lanta Braves owner Ted Turner
and the Disneyland Hotel.
"I think Reggie has a few
years left and would be quite a
favorite here," said Angels'
owner Gene Autry.
Jackson played out his op
tion with the New York Yan
kees in 1981. It has been re
ported that he has expressed
interest in playing for one of
four clubs next season — the

Angels, Braves, Yankees and
Baltimore Orioles.
New York (AP) — Hard
throwing Dave Righetti of the
New York Yankees was named
American League Rookie of
the Year by the Baseball Writ
ers Association of America on
Monday, beating out Boston
teammates Rick Gedman and
Bob Ojeda for the award.
Righetti, a southpaw who
posted an 8-4 record for the
Yankees after being called up
from Columbus of the Interna
tional League, received 23 of
the 28 first place votes from a
BBWAA panel consisting of
two writers in each of the 14
American League cities. He

also received four second
place votes and finished with
127 points in the 5-3-1 ballot
ing.
Gedman, who batted .268 in
62 games replacing Carlton Fisk
as the Red Sox's catcher, re
ceived the other five first-place
votes and totaled 64 points.
Ojeda, who was 6-2 after being
called up following the players'
strike, finished third with 36
points.
Righetti started the 1981 sea
son at Columbus after being
the Yankees' last cut in spring
training. But when he won five
straight games with a 1.00 ERA
in the International League, he
was recalled by New York.
