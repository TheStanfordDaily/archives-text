### 
Clemson, S.C. (AP) â€” Clemson de
fensive tackle Jeff Bryant said yesterday he
didn't mind at all that the Tigers attained
their No.l football ranking by virtue of a
Penn State victory over Pittsburgh.
"It's just the way the marbles fall," said
the All-Atlantic Coast Conference line
man, whose team moved from the N0.2
spot into the top ranking in The Associated
Press poll despite being idle last week.
"The No.l is there, and all we've got to
do is go out and prove that we deserve it,"
he said.
Clemson, at 11-0 the nation's only un
defeated and untied NCAA Division l-A
team, will play fourth-ranked Nebraska in
the Orange Bowl in Miami on New Year's

night.
Georgia, Alabama and Nebraska all
moved up a notch from last week's rank
ings of third, fourth and fifth respectively,
in the wake of Penn State's 48-14 upset of
Pitt. The Panthers tumbled from first to
10th.
Clemson was named on 63 of 68 first
place ballots in becoming the seventh top
ranked team this year.
It is the first time in the 46-year history of
The AP poll that the Tigers have been top
ranked.
Southern Methodist finished fifth, fol
lowed by Texas, Penn State, Southern Cali
fornia, Miami, Fla. and Pitt. The Second
Ten consisted of North Carolina, Washing

ton, lowa, Brigham Young, Ohio State,
Michigan, Arizona State, Southern Missis
sippi, UCLA and Washington State.
Clemson Coach Danny Ford, exulting in
his team's ranking yesterday, said, "The
only thing I'd like to do is what the other
six folks ain't done, and that's figure out
how to stay there."
The final national poll will be an
nounced at 6:30 p.m. Jan. 3, two days after
the Orange Bowl, Georgia's clash with Pitt
in the Sugar Bowl and the Cotton Bowl bat
tle between Alabama and Texas.
Bryant said he didn't think the pressure
of going into the Orange Bowl as the No.l
'earn against a traditional powerhouse like
Nebraska would bother Clemson.
