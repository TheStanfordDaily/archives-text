Allen probe closed
Washington — Attorney General William
French Smith is closing the Justice Depart
ment investigation into Richard Allen's ac
ceptance of $1000 without the appointment
of a special prosecutor, the government an
nounced yesterday.
While ending its investigation into the gift
from representatives of a Japanese women's
magazine for helping arrange an interview
with first lady Nancy Reagan, Smith held
open the possibility of appointing a special
prosecutor to look into two other matters
involving Allen — his acceptance of two gift
watches from the same magazine and an in
accuracy in his financial disclosure
statement filed at the time he took office as
President Ronald Reagan's national security
adviser.
Allen has said the money was intended
for Nancy Reagan and he intercepted the
gift and put it in an office safe, where it was
forgotten until discovered in September.
On Saturday, he put himself on paidadmin
istrative leave while the investigation con
tinued.
The Justice Department said it was still
looking into the gift watches and the inac
curacy concerning the date he sold his in
terest in a consulting firm — both matters
which "came to the department's attention
within the past 10 days."
"The applicability of the special prose
cutor provisions to those matters has not yet
been determined," the department said in a
statement handed to reporters.
"At this time, it would be premature and
inappropriate to comment further," the
statement said.
The Justice Department said a careful re
view of the FBI investigation into the dis
covery of the money found no evidence
that Allen violated any federal criminal law.
Reagan backs Soc. Security
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
told the White House Conference on Aging
yesterday that the elderlv have been "need
lessly and cruelly frightened" about his pro
posals for Social Security and promised nev
erto betray their righttothe program's ben
efits.
At 70, the nation's oldest president ever,
Reagan said he is frustrated at being
"portrayed as somehow an enemy of my
own generation," largely because of his at
tempts to cut future Social Security benefits.
The president made an unannounced ap
pearance before the conference where
hours earlier, Reagan supporters won their
first test of strength as a key committee
voted overwhe\ming\y against using gener
al tax revenues to bail out Social Security.
The 111-34 vote in the Committee on Eco
nomic Well-Being came on a resolution in
troduced by Bruce Nestande, a Republican
supervisor in Orange County, Calif., and a
former aide to Reagan as governor.
Leaders of organizations for the elderly
have charged that the White House stacked
the Committee on Economic Well-Being
with Reagan supporters. Most of the nearly
2300 delegates were chosen by governors
and members of Congress, not the adminis
tration.
The president has been dead-set against
tapping general revenues to lift the
beleaguered retirement and disability pro
gram out of its funding crisis.
"We will not betray those entitled to So
cial Security benefits," Reagan told the con
ference. "And we will, indeed we must, put
Social Security on a sound financial basis."
Earlier this year, while still trying to bal
ance the budget by 1984, Reagan proposed
a series of rules changes that would have
sharply reduced benefits of future retirees,
penalized early retirement, eliminated the
minimum benefit and delayed next year's
cost-of-living increases for 36 million Amer
icans.
But one-by-one he scaled back his plans

and finally abandoned them in favor of
proposing a new task force to seek a com
promise solution to the financial troubles of
the retirement system.
"There has been political demagoguery
and outright falsehood," Reagan said yes
terday.
And, the president added, "those who
did that frightening either didn't know what
they were talking about or they were lying."
Talks begin to limit missiles
Geneva, Switzerland — American and So
viet negotiating teams talked for more than
two hours yesterday in the first full bargain
ing session on limiting nuclear missiles in
Europe, and promptly reasserted a news
blackout on the conduct of the nego
tiations.
"Everything is OK," Soviet delegation
chief Yuli Kvitsinskv said as he left the two
hour, 40-minute meeting. "We meet again
Fridav" at the Soviet mission, Kvitsinsky
said.
There were no other public indications
here about the conduct of the talks, which
have seized the attention of Western Eu
ropeans increasingly wary about the medi
um-range nuclear forces of the super
powers.
The two sides, in a move they said would
encourage progress, agreed to embargo vir
tually all information about the talks, which
are to be conducted Tuesdays and Fridays.
"We have concurred that the details of the
negotiations must be kept in the nego
tiating room," the chief U.S. negotiator,
Paul Nitze, said after conferring with
Kvitsinskv on Monday on procedural issues.
Nitze described that session as "cordial and
businesslike."
Deputy head of the U.S. delegation May
nard Glitman, reached bv The Associated
Press, would not discuss the atmosphere of
yesterday's round, the first full-scale meet
ing of the two delegations.
"We've finished for this day," said Glit
man. "I'm not going to tell you anything
more."
East Germans's official news agency ADN
said foreign ministers of the seven Warsaw
Pact countries would be discussing "the sta
tus of arms control and disarmament" at a
meeting that opened yesterdav in Bucha
rest, Romania.
Early sessions of the Geneva talks on in
termediate-range nuclear forces were likely
to center on resolving differences about the
terminology, numbers, range and destruc
tive characteristics of those armaments.
Stockman desires new cuts
Washington — Budget director David
Stockman wants to phase out two urban aid
programs and eliminate subsidies for low
income housing construction as part of a
blitz, of spending cuts that has left federal
housing officials in shock, sources said yes
terday.
Informed sources in and out of govern
ment said Stockman wants to eliminate all
new spending after 1983 for Community
Development Block Grants and Urban De
velopment Action Grants. The two pro
grams, which this year aided about 2850
communities in every part of the country,
started out with a $4.2 billion budget for
1982.
The sources, who declined to be identi
fied, said Stockman also is seeking a 75 per
cent reduction in the nearly $18 billion sub
sidized housing program for 1982 and even
deeper cuts for 1983.
This would limit the number of additional
low-income families eligible for rent sub
sidies from about 75,000 this year to about
44,000 in 1983, the sources said.
The cuts hit two of the major programs
run by the Department of Housing and Ur
ban Development. HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr., described as angry, plans to ap

peal the reductions to President Ronald
Reagan, the sources said.
The cuts would mean that starting next
year, there would be no new money to help
finance construction or rehabilitation of
housing for low-income families. It would
come amid the worst Homebuilding slump
since World War II
Other areas of large cuts under con
sideration by Stockman are the Environ
mental Protection '\gency, job training and
employment programs for the poor and a
variet\ of other individual assistance pro
grams.
Reagan, who lias not given final approval
to anv program cuts, plans to listen to agen
cv appeals of OMB's proposals over the next
two weeks.
Sen. Jake Garn (R-Utah), chairman of a
HID appropriations subcommittee, said he
has not been notified of any plans to phase
out the urban development grants, but
labeled it as a "stupid proposal" that he
would oppose.
\ spokesman for the U.S. Conference of
Mayors said a phase-out of the two pro
grams would cause "very, very serious prob
lems for cities already affected bv budget
cutbacks and fiscal distress."
DC-9 crash kills all aboard
Ajaccio, Corsica — A chartered DC-9,
caught in stiff winds and dense fog as it ap
proached the Ajaccio airport, smashed into
a mountainside yesterday. Police said all 168
passengers, many of them travel agents on a
promotional trip, and six crew members
were killed.
Ajaccio police said there were no sur
vivors and that the victims included three
children.
However, the Yugoslav company which
owned the plane, Inex-Adria Airways, was
unable to say exactly how many people
were aboard. It said the craft was equipped
to carry a maximum of 175 passengers, and
as many as 172 people held tickets for the
flight but several ticket-holders cancelled
out at the last minute.
Officials said the plane crashed into the
west side of the fog-shrouded 4543-foot
high Mount San Pietro about 30 miles from
the airport and near the village of Casa
Casalabriva. They said it hit the ground
about 597 feet from the top of the peak.
Control tower officials said the plane was
on its final approach to the airport when it
sent a distress signal and then disappeared
from the tower's radar screens. They said it
was only seven minutes before the plane
was'due to land at 9 a.m. (2 a.m. EST.)
Rescue teams located the shattered and
burned remains of the plane scattered as far
as 1500 teet from the crash site, police said. It
took nearly four hours to locate the craft be
cause of the weather.
Officials speculated the heavy weather
over much of the craggy Mediterranean is
land may have caused the accident.
Most of the bodies had been dismem
bered by the explosion that followed the
crash, officials said. They said about 30 bod
ies had been airlifted from the moun
tainside to makeshift morgues in Ajaccio
late last night.
Court denies itself powers
Washington — In what one justice called
an "unprecedented step," the Supreme
Court yesterday voluntarily stripped the
courts of jurisdiction over a whole class of
constitutional violations — those involving
state and local taxes.
In a ruling on a case involving property
tax assessments, the court said that such tax
es are the business of state and local govern
ments, and federal courts should not in
tervene.
The ruling, written by Justice William
Rehnquist and supported by four other jus
tices, bars property taxpayers from suing lo
cal officials for damages in federal courts

under civil rights laws. That will please cities,
states anil counties who have been com
plaining bitterly about what they consider
the ever-expanding reach of those laws into
their affairs.
But the debate was not over property tax
es. It was over what Justice William Brennan
called the "unprecedented step of renoun
cing our assigned jurisdiction."
While all nine justices agreed that a Mis
souri suit brought under a civil rights law
should not be heard in federal court, Bren
nan and three others differed sharply with
the philosophy behind Rehnquist's opin
ion.
Among those on Brennan's side was jun
ior Justice Sandra Day O'Connor who, it was
generally thought, would come down with
Rehnquist on the side of state authority in
such cases. It was her first public vote in an
opinion on an issue seriously contested
among the justices.
The case stemmed from a suit bv St. Louis
County, Mo., property tax activists and a
couple, ). David anil Lvnn Casillv, who said
their rights had been violated by county tax
officials.
They based their suit on the Civil Rights
Act of 1871, which is used frequently by in
mates protesting prison conditions, minor
ities protesting police brutality and welfare
recipients protesting government action to
reduce benefits.
Reagan seeks union aid
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
made his first conciliatory gesture yesterday
toward the air controllers he fired last Au
gust as he opened a drive to forge better re
lations between his administration and or
ganized labor.
In a meeting with the leadership of the
Teamsters union at the White House, Rea
gan mentioned that he is considering re
scinding an order that no fired controllers
be hired for any federal job for three years,
according to a statement released bv the
White House.
That move could be a first step toward al
lowing :ome of the 11,000 fired controllers
to regain jobs in the nation's undermanned
airport control towers, but that apparently
would come only after a period of bargain
ing with organized labor.
White House officials stressed yesterday
that Reagan is not opening the door now to
giving some of the strikers back their old
jobs.
"You ask me whether he is thinking of
putting them back in the towers. No, he is
not considering that," David Gergen, White
House communications director, said.
"There has been no change in the presi
dent's fundamental position regarding air
traffic controllers," the White House
statement said.
Stocks continue climb

heavy trading yesterday but the market's

vious four sessions, rose another 1.24 to
890.22.
