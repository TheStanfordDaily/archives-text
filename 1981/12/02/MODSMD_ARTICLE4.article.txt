Concluding that there is "a lot of
romanticizing about the '605," Clay
borne Carson, assistant professor of
history here and a former UCLA civil
rights and anti-war activist, joined
Barton Bernstein, associate professor
of history, and former "New Left"
Stanford student body President
David Harris in establishing some of

"What's the problem, nigger lover."
Carson, who earlier this year pub
