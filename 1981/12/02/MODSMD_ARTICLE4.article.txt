Concluding that there is "a lot of
romanticizing about the '605," Clay
borne Carson, assistant professor of
history here and a former UCLA civil
rights and anti-war activist, joined
Barton Bernstein, associate professor
of history, and former "New Left"
Stanford student body President
David Harris in establishing some of
"the basic lessons that were learned
during that time."
Bernstein, Carson, and Harris
spoke to students at Branner Lounge
last night in the second "Retrospect
on Revolution" svmposium.
Both Carson and Harris explained
that thev grew up in an atmosphere
of '50s idealism permeated by a
crusading anti-communism. Harris
entered Stanford on the heels of
being named "Fresno Boy of the
Year" in 1963,whileCarsonashamed-
Iv confessed that he was a nominee
for two military academies.
Harris said that his idealism grew
from "an intense belief" in the les
sons taught by "high school civics."

Bernstein explained that the crisis
of confidence in this idealism only
arises with the ascendency of "a rec
ognized liberal or neo-liberal" such
as former president John F Kennedy,
whose effusive professions of ideal
ism only made more manifest the
profound "gap between rhetoric and
action."
Harris explained how activists in
the fledgling Civil Rights movement
became painfully aware of the gap
between rhetoric and reality. Farlier
recalling that he wanted to be an FBI
agent when he was in the eighth
grade, Harris told of how a student
who joined him in the South to help
out in the Civil Rights movement
found himself "waylaid by some
Rednecks." When an FBI agent ar
rived to investigate, he said to Harris:
"What's the problem, nigger lover."

the birthplace of the anti-war and,
later, the women's and environmen
talist movements.
According to Carson, the Civil
Rights movement provided three
major legacies: an increased sensi
tivity about the nature of oppression
which caused people "to recognize
that rights are universal," a general
skepticism about authority and in
stitutional leadership, and tactics
such as sit-ins which exposed the in
consistencies of America's leaders.
On the question of tactics, Carson
suggested that "if we were willing to
go to jail, politicians should be will
ing to lose an election," on behalf of
these ideals.
When considering the short
comings of '60s radicalism, Bernstein
suggested that in conflicts on issues
such as ROTC and university military
research, the radical idea that
teaching warfare was "fundamental
ly antithetical to the notion of the
university, humanism, and human
ity" always lost to the liberal idea that
warfare research was wrong simply
because it was "classified" since that
violated the classical |ohn Stuart Mill
notion of the free "marketplace of
ideas."
Harris concluded that many peo
ple are too quick to denounce the
Founders of the New Left for"selling
out." He called this "a relatively use
less notion."
