Fd Zschau, Republican candidate for the 12th Con
gressional District told the Daily in a recent interview
that his No. 1 priority is to reduce the government's
spending deficit.
"We have to have leadership in restraining govern
ment spending," he said. "This is hard because peo
ple elect you based on what you can do for them."
"The economy suffers when we don't have any dis
cipline,"he added
Zschau blamed inflation and unemployment on
government deficits.
"Government expenditures have increased as a
percentage of GNP (Gross National Product) and
most of the increase in the federal budget has come in
the form of increased transfer payments," he said.
All sectors of the economy need to be examined for
budget cuts including entitlements, social security
and defense, according to Zschau.
Defense spending increases at the level called for
bv the Reagan administration are unnecessary, he
said, adding that the defense objectivesof the Reagan
administration can fie achieved in a more efficient
way.
The president of a high-technology corporation,
Zschau compared the budget process of his corpo
rtation to that of the United States.
"We can't give everybody what they ask for ori
ginally. If we did, the company wouldn't make it,"he
said.
In addition to budget cuts, Zschau advocated
selected tax cuts as a means of stimulating the econo
my.

"We have to trv to stimulate people to take risks,"
said 7mhau, who played a role in reducing the max
imum tax on capital gains from 50 to 28 percent in
1978.
/schau consistently advocates free market eco
nomics. He said he opposes government subsidies,
protective tariffs and he feels that the government has
become involved in too many areas "which individ
uals can do for themselves."
The government, according to Zschau, should limit
its involvement to several areas — protecting individ
ual's rights and property, providing a social-econom
ic setting in which individuals can succeed or fail, sup
porting public education, eliminating discrimination,
helping the . ri■ Iv needy and helping to balance near
term needs with the needs of future generations.
According to Zschau, the kev to meeting foreign
policy challenges and maintaining peace is to build a
strong economy. "If the economy is weak our hands
are tied," he said.
/schau favors the Reagan administration's energy
policy — especially deregulation of gas prices, be
cause, he 1 said, the higher prices will encourage
energy exploration, make alternative energy sources
competitive and encourage conservation.
Nuclear power will play a part in our energy future
and it should be encouraged, said Zschau. 'We have
discouraged it because we're afraid of it,"he ex
lained.
/schau, who supports the Equal Rights Amend
ment and opposes anti-abortion legislation, has been
endorsed bv current Congressman Pete McCloskey,
who is vacating his 12th District seat to run for the U.S.
Senate.
