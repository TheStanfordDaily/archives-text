# 'Friday night arsonist' thought to be student
## 
### Mike McAulay 
The "Friday Night Arsonist," who is
believed bv local fire officials to be
responsible for a series of 24 fires He
liber. itelv set on campus since last
Mav, is probably a student here, ac
cording to Captain Jerrv Davis of the
Palo Mto Fire Department.
Davis ,ilso said he believes that
chances are "quite good" that the
arso.iist m,iv soon be burning cars or
even buildings, if his pvromaniacal
tendencies go unchecked.
To date, the arsonist is believed to
be responsible for the burning of
gr.iss, trashcans, and even trees. On
Nov. 20 he or she overturned a mo
torcvcle parked on the corner of San
t.i Vne/ Street and Cabrillo Avenue
and ignited the contents of the gas
tank This was the most recent in the
series of blazes which began May 15
with four grass fires set on Serra
Street.
Davis said many arsonists, when
thev realize that thev can get away
with smaller fires, may become more
ambitious -Xt cording to Stanford Fo
lic e Captain Marvin Moore, there
still have been no witnesses to any of
the crimes.
The belief that the arsonist is a stu
dent here is based mostly on the sin
gular fact that there were no fires

during the summer months. Police
anil fire officials hoped that perhaps
their perpetrator might have ceased
or left the area altogether, until the
fites resumed abruptly in late Sep
tember.
It now seems almost certain that
the person responsible is a student at
Stanford who was merely away for
the summer vacation.
Seventeen of the 24 fires have oc
curred on a Friday, either before
(fawn or after sunset. Of the others,
two have been on Saturday, two on
Sundays, two on Thursdays, and one
on a Wednesday. Almost all of the
fires have been set between mid
night and 2 a.m.
Davis said there was little that cam
pus residents could do to protect
their vehicles unless they have access
to a lockable garage.
Moore said he feels confident that
the Stanford police are capable of
combatting both the arsonist and the
person responsible for the recent
rash of sexual assaults on campus.
He pointed out that "sexual as
saults are the No. 1 priority now,"
and was quick to add that police of
ficers patrolling the campus for rape
suspects can easily watch for possible
cases of arson at the same time.
