## Spicer is Scientist of the Year 
### Kristen Christopher 
Stanford Prof. William Spicer has been named "Scientist
of the Year" by Industrial Research and Development for
his work in both engineering and physics. But, since he has
been doing research in these fields for several decades, he
said, "I'll be damned if I know," why the journal decided to
give him the award this year.
Spicer said his work has been significant largely because
of his belief that basic and applied science should not be
separate realms.
"What is a very natural thing to happen, but a very de
structive thing," he said, "is the tendency in the scientific or
technical world to get polarized between the people who
are doing basic work and don't worry about any applica
tions and the people who are doing applied work and have
a short range goal in mind and tend not to approach it in a
very scientific way."
Although he said considers himself a basic physicist,
Spicer said he uses as a decision-making factor the question
of whether or not the basic information will have practical
applications.
In 1955, Spicer went to work for Radio Corporation of
America (RCA) laboratories doing research on photo
emission, the idea that light shined on a solid causes elec
trons to emerge from the solid, a main principle behind tel
evision pictures and camera tubes.
"No one understood how photo-emission worked or
why one material was good and another one wasn't," Spicer
said, "so what I did was workedout the basicunderstanding
of the mechanism andthenlwasabletoturnitaroundand
develop it as a tool for getting information on the quantum
states of solids."
Spicer also combined pure and applied physics in invent
ing an improved X-ray intensifier. He developed an X-ray
tube which amplifies the image by a factor of about 10,000,
which he said, "Allows you to use less X-rays and look at lots
of things you couldn't look at before, and therefore, there is
less danger for the doctor and the patient."
Spicer also changed the screen which converts X-rays into
visible light by determining the electron structure of alkali
halides, and thus, discovering a more effective evaporator
for the screen.
"It was one of those very, very simple things, but it revolu
tionized the field and everyone uses it now," he said.
Spicer is presently consulting director of the Synchroton
Radiation Laboratory at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center. "What we're concentrating on," he said, "is study
ing surfaces, because we now understand the inside of ma
terials fairly well, but particularly when we started this work
about 10 years ago, there was very little understanding
about surfaces or about when you put two materialstogeth
er, the interfaces between those materials."
Spicer said that while the work is fundamental in nature,
he tries to choose problems in which the knowledge gener
ated will also be of practical importance. For example, he
said he hopes to develop new catalytic materials so that the
United States can decrease its reliance on foreign countries
for strategic metals.
Spicer is also currently a member of the Advisory Group>

on Electron Devices for the U.S. government. "I think the
government has a very key role in science in that it's the
onlv grouping that has resources to pay for long range re
search," he said. "The government funding in this country
has grown in a strange wav because there hasn't been a con
tinuous adjustment of the funding policies."
Therefore, Spicer said he feels studies on government
funding should be done, and that particularly, the systems
used in other countries should be analyzed.
In teaching graduate students here, Spicer said he tries to
emphasize the mutual benefitsof basicand applied science
"bv creating an atmosphere which is very broad in nature."
For example, he said he has students who will get their Ph.D.
in four departments so that the danger of becoming too in
grown into one field is alleviated.
Spicer also said he believes it is necessary for students to
gain self-confidence through their studies. "I think it is ex
tremely important that a thesis advisor look at each student
as an individual and use the thesis as a mechanism for de
veloping that individual," he said.
