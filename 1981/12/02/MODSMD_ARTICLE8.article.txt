# Resistance to antibiotics

When a typhoid epidemic
strack Mexico in the early '70s,
doctors took swift, appropriate
action. They prescribed
chloramphenicol, an antibiotic
that had been used successfully
to combat the disease for near
ly 25 vears.
But the physicians were hor
rified to discover that many pa
tients were not responding to
treatment. The typhoid-pro
ducing bacteria, Salmonella
typhi, had become resistant to
the wonder drug.
While doctors searched fran
tically for an alternate cure,
20,000 persons died. Finally, a
laboratory in Britain under the
direction of Dr. Epbraim An
derson identified ampicillin as
a suitable substitute.
This dramatic example
points to a subject of growing
concern among physicians —
the problem of increasing bac
terial resistance to antibiotics.
Although the mechanics of
resistance are well understood,
the selectivity of the response
is still a mystery. Some bacteria
will develop resistance to a par
ticular antibiotic after only a
short period of exposure, while
other bacteria will remain sen
sitive to that same antibiotic
even after years of continued
exposure.
Dr. Kenneth Vosti, a pro
fessor of medicine here spe
cializing in infectious diseases,
warned that time can be de
ceiving. Gonococcus, for ex
ample, showed no signs of re
sistance for years and years af
ter being introduced to peni
cillin. Recently, however, two
resistant strains of gonorrhea,
the venereal disease caused by
these bacteria, have been iden
tified.
"Bacteria are quite smart,"
said Vosti. "It's a chess game;
no matter what we do, they'll
be able to come back with a
better move. So the game will
go on and on."
So far, the scientific game
plan has been largely offensive.
Since 1940, the year peni

cillin was first used successfully
to treat blood poisoning in hu
mans, the impact of antibiotics
on our lives has been nothing
short of miraculous. Diseases
like tuberculosis, the plague,
and svphilis, once the cause of
widespread suffering and
almost certain death, suddenly
became treatable.
As new varieties of anti
biotics were isolated and
tested, more and more applica
tions were discovered. Urinary
tract infections, acne, cholera,
meningitis, diptheria, whoop
ing cough, rheumatic fever —
these were just a few of the ills
for which cures became avail
able. Each new success pro
vided the impetus for further
experimentation. As time
passed, antibiotics became the
centerpiece of prophylactic, or
preventive, medicine.
Today, there are more than
60 antibiotics on the market,
and new varieties are steadily
being developed despite strict
quality control guidelines im
posed by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
Unfortunately, the successes
have begun to backfire.
For one thing, the public has
come to view antibiotics as
wonder drugs and doctors as
miracle-workers. These mis
conceptions have led to over
use of the drugs, which in turn
has accelerated the spread of
bacterial resistance.
"The tendency among physi
cians is to use antibiotics much
more aggressively," said Vosti.
The term "antibiotic" is de
rived from the Greek anti
biosis, meaning "against life."
Antibiotics are chemical sub
stances, produced by micro
organisms, that have the power
to inhibit the growth of, or
even to destroy, bacteria and
other microorganisms.
Resistance is the ability of an
organism to ward off the ef
fects of an antagonistic
chemical substance, in this case
an antibiotic, either by destroy
ing that substance or by block
ing its penetration. This innate
defense mechanism has

enabled organisms to cope
with hostile changes in the en
vironment, and as such has
plaved a key role in evolution.
What alarms doctors is not
the fact that resistance occurs,
but that our overuse of anti
biotics has dangerously ac
celerated the process.
\ bacterial organism may de
velop resistance in one of sev
eral wavs.
First, it mav mutate in the
presence of an antibiotic.
Whether or not such a re
sponse is genetically pre
determined is still a question of
debate.
For a long time, mutation
was thought to be the only way
in which resistance could be
acquired. In 1959, however, a
team of Japanese scientists dis
covered that resistance could
be physically transferred from
one organism to another by
means of plasmids, tiny bits of
genetic material, which could
migrate freely between or
ganisms.
Furthermore, they dis
covered that cross-resistance
to a variety of related anti
biotics could develop after ex
posure to only one of the sub
stances. This trait too, could be
transferred.
Perhaps the most startling
discovery of all was that trans
ference could take place not
only between like organisms,
but between unlike ones as
well.
Vosti said he is critical, for ex
ample, of the large volume of
antibiotics that are prescribed
for upper respiratory infec
tions, which are generally viral,
not bacterial, in nature. Anti
biotics have no effect on infec
tions caused by most viruses.
Nevertheless, he issympathetic
to the fact that physicians are
under a lot of pressure to pre
scribe.
"You can find it both ways,"
he said. "Some physicians will
knowingly use antibiotics in sit
uations where there's a very
high probability that it's not
bacterial, in which case I think
it is poor practice.
"On the other hand, though,
people are not yet at the point
where they're willing to accept
to a physician with what
almost certainly is a viral respi
ratory infection, and walking
out of the office without a pre
scription for an antibiotic. The
public puts a lot of pressure on
very well-meaning physicians
to prescribe something, an
antibiotic."
"In fact," he said, "if they
don't get it from one physician
they may go to another one un
til they do get it."
What can be done about the
overuse of antibiotics? The an
swer to this and other ques
tions will appear in the second
part of the article, appearing
next Wednesday.
