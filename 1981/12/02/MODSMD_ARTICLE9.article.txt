## Repairing bicycles beats hashing 
### Dan McMillan 
"We do this so we don't have to hash," said Ron Moller
<ihout his hike repair business in White Plaza. Moller and
Fete I owis, both sophomores here, have been fixing bi
( V( les in front of the Bookstore since last spring.
Moller and Lewis work out of a small wooden stand two
hours .1 day, four days a week, and do all repairs on the spot.
"I thought about doing something like this on campus
before I came to Stanford," said Moller. "I was surprised
that no one else had thought of it."
The pair decided to give Moller's idea a trial run last
spring quarter, when both were cycling extensively to train
for the crew team. Moller and Lewis initially checked with
the ASSU to see if such a business would be legal, and were
told that "no one reallv knew."
A< ( ording to Marianne Byerwalter of the Council of Pres
idents, the University has no written rules covering small
operations like Moller's and Lewis's. "It's a laissez faire poli
< v," she said. "The University lets the Bookstore, the Post
()ffii e and Tresidder control the land around them."
Fldon Speed, manager of the Stanford Bookstore, said,
"As long as I don't get any complaints, I don't particularly
mind their being there." For this reason, Moller and Lewis
(lose up when it rains, rather than move under the Book
store roof, where they might get in the way.
"If they bet ame a nuisance," said Speed, "I'd try to make
them leave, though I'm not even sure I could."
Though neither Lewis nor Moller has ever worked in a
bike shop, both have done extensive cycle touring.
"There's just not that much to bicycles," said Moller.
"We've picked up what we need to know from our own rid
ing."
"We're not trying to compete with the bike shops," he
s.tid. "We don't sell parts and can't do major work. On the
other hand, we do minor repairs a lot faster and at much less
rost. We charge just enough to make the same as people
who hash or work in the library," said Moller.
According to Moller, the job offers other rewards. "You
see quite a cross-section of the Stanford community," said
Moller. "It's interesting. There's also a real satisfaction in
taking something that's broken and making it work again
for someone."

don't sell parts or do major repairs, sophomores Ron
Moller and Pete Lewis have built up quite a business re
