"Scott Kim has perfected a personal art form — one with grace, elegance,
subtlety, and surprises. He draws on a deep understanding of letter forms and
visual perception, and the resulting designs are highly original and gratifying.
Many people will be delighted by what they see; some — I hope a good number
— will go on to explore their own corners of the enchanting artistic space that
Scott has revealed in INVERSIONS as an inspiring work."
—Douglas Hofstadter
