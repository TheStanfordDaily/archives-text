A Place to
Achieve.
A semiconductor company measures much of its
worth by the technological accomplishments of its
people. At Signetics, our Good People have an enviable
record of advances. It would take literally pages to
list all of them.
Measure us by our achievements, and you'll see why
a career with Signetics is head and shoulders above
many other places.
We offer challenging careers in all phases of engineer
ing—product, design, test, process, reliability/quality
assurance, and failure analysis.
If you have a Bachelor's or advanced degree in elec
trical, chemical or mechanical engineering; material
science; computer science; physics; metallurgy; elec
tronics or industrial technology, we want to talk to
you.
