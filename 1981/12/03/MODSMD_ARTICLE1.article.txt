# Finance plan for new faculty housing draws complaints
## 
### Monika Guttman Senior staff writer 
Several faculty members, claiming
that University proposals for financ
ing the purchase of the still-under
construction Peter Coutts con
dominiums exclude lower salaried
faculty, have vocalized their com
plaints "in the hopes that other facul
ty members will become aware of
what is going on," according to Eng
lish Prof. Ron Rebholz.
"The reasoning behind the financ
ing programs is to enable the Univer
sity to recruit 'star' faculty," said
Rebholz, who is president of the
Stanford branch of the American As
sociation of University Professors
(AAUP). "Recruitment isn't the only
thing at stake in the housing situ
ation, however. The low salaries of
professors in the humanities and so
cial sciences make it extremely dif
ficult to buy housing anyway, espe
cially in this market," he said.
The University is constructing 140
condominium units on Peter Coutts
hill for faculty purchase. The units are
supposed to be available "sometime
in the summer of 1982."
The University intends to have two
separate programs, above and
beyond normal mortgage financing
available through the banks, which
can be used for financing the
purchase of a Peter Coutts con
dominium, according to Robin Ham

ill, director of the faculty housing
program. Hamill emphasized that
these alternatives are still subject to
approval by the California Depart
ment of Real Estate.
—The first is the Coinvestment
Mortgage Program (COIN), which is
a second mortgage program oper
ated by the Univeristy itself. All
buyers who do not own a home
within a 15 mile radius of the Univer
sity and want to buy a house at Stan
ford are eligible for these loans. The
University Board of Trustees ap
proved establishing this program
permanently after a pilot program.
—The second, and more con
troversial, is the Housing Allowance
Program (HAP), which provides loans
for any faculty member who has
been recruited since 1979 who
wishes to purchase a house within a
15 mile radius of Stanford. The HAP
will allocate money proportionate to
a faculty member's income, which
means basically that faculty members
with higher salaries will be provided
with a higher housing stipend.
The HAP proposal has drawn con
siderable criticism because, accord
ing to Rebholz, the 1979 limit dis
criminates against faculty who have
been here for a while and the struc
ture of the loan program, by giving
larger stipends to faculty with higher
incomes, "doesn't help those who
need help the most," according to

Rebholz.
"We had to use the new housing as
a recruiting tool, and HAP is de
signed to make up for the difference
in housing costs between this area
and areas such as Cambridge, Mass.,
where faculty we wish to recruit may
also be recruited," said Hamill. "For
instance, a professor who earns
$70,000 per year at Harvard could buy
a fairly nice house, whereas that
would be impossible in Palo Alto."
Hamill admitted that this dis
criminates against faculty in the hu
manities and social sciences whose
salaries are generally lower than pro
fessors in the medical school or engi
neering, for example.
"But this is reflective of values in
society in general, and we can't be
expected to singlehandedly correct
that situation," she said. "We are
merely trying to place professors
here in the same buying position
they would be in elsewhere in the
country."
Hamill said that the cost of housing
has been a major factor in the inabili
ty of Stanford to attract faculty.
"I would say that of the people
who turn us down, one half of the re
jections are due to the cost of hous
ing in this area," said Hamill. "A few
years ago there was a perception of a
crisis here. The provost established
that recruitment would be the major

focus of our housing development
policy."
But faculty members say they feel
this policy is discriminatory.
"The HAP is meeting only one
need: recruitment," said Clifford
Barnett,professor of anthropology
here. "There is a second need that is
not being met: junior faculty mem
bers who cannot afford to buy hous
ing because their salaries aren't high
enough." Barnett is also an executive
member of the AAUP and a cosigner
of a letter which appears in yester
day's Campus Report outlining facul
ty objections to the financing policy.
Both Barnettandßebholzsaidthey
feel there is not enough awarness
among the faculty here of what the
policy is and how it will affect faculty.
Faculty members have also ex
pressed concern about the issue of
the proceeds from the sales of the Pe
ter Coutts project.
"Our guess is that the price is two
times the cost of the project," he
said. "If they would be willing to re
duce the proceeds from the project,
then they could sell the units below
market costs and make it more af
fordable for professors with a lower
salary."
Hamill said that the first $2.25 mil
lion in proceeds from the Peter
Coutts project are stipulated (by the
University Board of Trustees) to be
used for the HAP financing.
"It's difficult to estimate what our
proceeds will be, since we're selling
the 140 units over a three-year peri
od," said Hamill. "By the time we sell
the units, we could get a higher price
for them." Hamill estimated that total
proceeds would be somewhere
around $4 million.

focus of our housing development
policy."
But faculty members say they feel
this policy is discriminatory.
"The HAP is meeting only one
need: recruitment," said Clifford
Barnett,professor of anthropology
here. "There is a second need that is
not being met: junior faculty mem
bers who cannot afford to buy hous
ing because their salaries aren't high
enough." Barnett is also an executive
member of the AAUP and a cosigner
of a letter which appears in yester
day's Campus Report outlining facul
ty objections to the financing policy.
Both Barnettandßebholzsaidthey
feel there is not enough awarness
among the faculty here of what the
policy is and how it will affect faculty.
Faculty members have also ex
pressed concern about the issue of
the proceeds from the sales of the Pe
ter Coutts project.
"Our guess is that the price is two
times the cost of the project," he
said. "If they would be willing to re
duce the proceeds from the project,
then they could sell the units below
market costs and make it more af
fordable for professors with a lower
salary."
Hamill said that the first $2.25 mil
lion in proceeds from the Peter
Coutts project are stipulated (by the
University Board of Trustees) to be
used for the HAP financing.
"It's difficult to estimate what our
proceeds will be, since we're selling
the 140 units over a three-year peri
od," said Hamill. "By the time we sell
the units, we could get a higher price
for them." Hamill estimated that total
proceeds would be somewhere
around $4 million.
Several faculty members, claiming
that University proposals for financ
ing the purchase of the still-under
construction Peter Coutts con
dominiums exclude lower salaried
faculty, have vocalized their com
plaints "in the hopes that other facul
ty members will become aware of
what is going on," according to Eng
lish Prof. Ron Rebholz.
"The reasoning behind the financ
ing programs is to enable the Univer
sity to recruit 'star' faculty," said
Rebholz, who is president of the
Stanford branch of the American As
sociation of University Professors
(AAUP). "Recruitment isn't the only
thing at stake in the housing situ
ation, however. The low salaries of
professors in the humanities and so
cial sciences make it extremely dif
ficult to buy housing anyway, espe
cially in this market," he said.
The University is constructing 140
condominium units on Peter Coutts
hill for faculty purchase. The units are
supposed to be available "sometime
in the summer of 1982."
The University intends to have two
separate programs, above and
beyond normal mortgage financing
available through the banks, which
can be used for financing the
purchase of a Peter Coutts con
dominium, according to Robin Ham

ill, director of the faculty housing
program. Hamill emphasized that
these alternatives are still subject to
approval by the California Depart
ment of Real Estate.
—The first is the Coinvestment
Mortgage Program (COIN), which is
a second mortgage program oper
ated by the Univeristy itself. All
buyers who do not own a home
within a 15 mile radius of the Univer
sity and want to buy a house at Stan
ford are eligible for these loans. The
University Board of Trustees ap
proved establishing this program
permanently after a pilot program.
—The second, and more con
troversial, is the Housing Allowance
Program (HAP), which provides loans
for any faculty member who has
been recruited since 1979 who
wishes to purchase a house within a
15 mile radius of Stanford. The HAP
will allocate money proportionate to
a faculty member's income, which
means basically that faculty members
with higher salaries will be provided
with a higher housing stipend.
The HAP proposal has drawn con
siderable criticism because, accord
ing to Rebholz, the 1979 limit dis
criminates against faculty who have
been here for a while and the struc
ture of the loan program, by giving
larger stipends to faculty with higher
incomes, "doesn't help those who
need help the most," according to

Rebholz.
"We had to use the new housing as
a recruiting tool, and HAP is de
signed to make up for the difference
in housing costs between this area
and areas such as Cambridge, Mass.,
where faculty we wish to recruit may
also be recruited," said Hamill. "For
instance, a professor who earns
$70,000 per year at Harvard could buy
a fairly nice house, whereas that
would be impossible in Palo Alto."
Hamill admitted that this dis
criminates against faculty in the hu
manities and social sciences whose
salaries are generally lower than pro
fessors in the medical school or engi
neering, for example.
"But this is reflective of values in
society in general, and we can't be
expected to singlehandedly correct
that situation," she said. "We are
merely trying to place professors
here in the same buying position
they would be in elsewhere in the
country."
