# Ciskei soon to face self-rule
## 
### 
from the Daily wire services
King William's Town, South Africa — Tomor
row Ciskei will become the fourth bantustan, or
tribal "homeland" to be accorded independent
status by South Africa.
Twice the size of Luxemburg and covering
more than 5000 square miles next to the Indian
Ocean between Capetown and Durban, Ciskei
has 2.1 million inhabitants, two-thirds of whom
live in the white industrialized zones of South
Africa.
Despite a tense political and social climate,
this extremely poor land is preparing celebra
tions to mark a move to independence that will
probably be totally ignored by the international
community.
The rest of the world has already refused to
recognize similar events for three other ban
tustans that were declared independent: Trans
kei in 1976, Bophutaiswana in 1977 and Venda in
1979.

The United Nations and the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) see this "balkanisation" of
southern Africa as an accentuation of the apart
heid policy of the government in Pretoria.
The groups say that South African authorities
aim to create black "reservations" in order to
define more clearly a "white state" in which
blacks would be no more than immigrant work
ers.
Officials strongly dispute this interpretation.
But the future of Ciskei, the least developed of
the bantustans, promises to be difficult. In addi
tion, a growing political and trade union move
ment, harshly repressed, is opposed to the
change, whose principles have even been re
jected by a Ciskei government commission.
The government of neighboring Transkei is
also strongly opposed to a policy that would
mean dividing the ethnic Xhosa people between
two states, rather than unitingthem in one as the
homelands policy is supposed to do.
