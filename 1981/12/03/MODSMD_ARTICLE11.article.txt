### Los Angeles Times 
Rome — The City Council of Reggio
Calabria will oppose any plan to remove
the fabled Bronzes of Riace from the na
tional museum there for an exhibition in
Los Angeles in conjunction with the 1984
Olympic Games, Mayor Oreste Granillo
announced yesterday.
Although that may not be the last word

on the proposal, the city's opposition
raised serious doubts about the possibility
of an agreement with the Los Angeles
Olympic Organizing Committee.
"If the city is opposed, it is not possible
that the regional government will agree,"
Benedetto Mallamacci, regional com
missioner of public works, said yesterday.
Regional governments are similar to state

governments in the United States but with
somewhat less autonomy.
Members of the national government
here reaffirmed yesterday that they were
awaiting decisions from the political lead
ers of Calabria, where the bronzes were
found and have been on display since Au
gust, before making a final decision.
