## New fight to save the Stanislaus 
### Anne Larson 
In an attempt to save the Stanislaus
River's remaining stretches of popular
white water river rapids from inundation, a
signature-gathering drive is underway to
qualify an initiative that will reform water
pricing policy in California and postpone
the filling of the New Melones Reservoir.
The California Water Resources Protec
tion Council (CWRPC), a newly formed
environmental group, hopes to obtain the
half million signatures necessary in time to
place the Water Resouces Conservation
and Efficiency Act on the November 1982
ballot.
The language of the act gives the
Stanislaus River Canyon, located on the
western side of the central Sierra Nevada,
"special safeguards" that would "restrict
the filling of the New Melones Reservoir
until a need for the water is proven."
First authorized by Congress in 1944, the
Melones Dam was planned to protect
farmers in the river's flood plain against
flooding. Additional benefits were sug
gested, such as irrigation and the instiga
tion of a hydroelectric facility, and in 1966,
the New Melones Dam, almost twice the
size of the original, was authorized.
Protests began in 1968 as people began
to realize that the entire Stanislaus River
Canyon, which was becoming increasingly
popular for hiking, swimming, rafting, and
fishing, would be flooded upon comple
tion of the dam.
In 1974 an environmental group called
Friends of the River succeeded in gaining
enough signatures to place an initiative,
Proposition 17, on the ballot to prevent the
completion of the New Melones Dam then
about two-thirds built, and save the
Stanislaus.
The proposition lost, although FOR sup
porters claim that television ads and
billboards financed by corporations who
were profiting from building the dam, in
cluding the New Melones Contractors, de
ceived the voters and skewed the election
results.
The ads said, "really save the river; vote
no," when a no vote meant that the dam
would be completed and the river
flooded.

Since then, FOR has concentrated on
trying to prevent the filling of the reservoir
to its full capacity. Of the 25 miles of river
affected, 17 have already been flooded.
The current initiative hopes to save the re
maining eight miles.
Originally called the Stanislaus River In
itiative, the name and focus of the new leg
islation was broadened because of a grow
ing awareness that the Stanislaus is only
part of California's water problems. The
new initiative will deal with "the whole wa
ter problem" and help to "prevent future
Stans from occuring," said David Pannish
of the CWRPC.
Specific provisions of this initiative re
quire large water users "to develop and
implement cost effective water conserva
tion measures before new sources of water
are tapped," insure the protection and
preservation of the natural qualities of
lakes, rivers, and streams, and require "the
11 most critically overdrafted areas of the
state ... to begin locally-controlled,
groundwater management plans."
The initiative states, "At the present
time, filling the New Melones Reservoir to
a moderate level is an effective com
promise that will provide for irrigation,
flood control, power generation, and wa
ter quality enhancement, while preserving
the natural and recreational qualities of
the canyon." The impoundment of water
beyond this level "shall be prohibited until
the project operator has entered into
long-term water service contracts."
The stretch of water above Parrott's
Ferry Bridge is a "rare and unusual en
vironmenal resource" that should not be
destroyed "unless it is really justified,"said
Pannish.
Whetherthe water from New Melones is
actually needed by agriculture is a key
point in the debate. David Freyberg of the
Civil Engineering Department here said
that the flood irrigation system used by
most California farmers is an inefficient
use of water. But because the water is
cheap, farmers prefer to flood-irrigate
than to pay for the cost of weeding neces
sary with the more efficient drip irrigation.
"The whole reason water is used so
hpavily i« hpraiup of fhp way it i* prifpH,'

said Freyberg. Hesuggestedthatnotallow
ing the dam to be filled would lead to bet
ter water conservation efforts.
Freyberg also mentioned that the gov
ernment has invested millions of dollars in
the New Melones Project, and to a lot of
people it "seemsridiculous not to use it."
According to the Army Corps of Engi
neers, the dam should be allowed "to
fulfill the requirements of what the thing
was built for." Not to finish the project
would be a waste of the taxpayer's money,
a spokesman said.
There is enough water at present for ag
ricultural uses without totally filling the
dam, but the winter is unpredictable, ac
cording to Bill Dußois of the California
Farm Bureau Federation. The reservoir
would serve as a storehouse of water with
which to flush the delta below the dam in
low flood periods.
Filling the dam now will preserve the
delta water quality next summer and pro
tect the ecology of the delta, Dußois said.
He said that if environmental groups
would concern themselves with the
ecology of the delta they would support
the filling of the reservoir.
Dußois added, "And even if the water
wasn't an issue," we have the capability to
save substantial amounts of money that
we're having to send to the Arabs for for
eign oil.
"There isn't any justification for having
the structure" unless it is utilized, said
Dußois. "The tool is just rusting away/'
According to Edwin Nossof of the Cali
fornia Water Resources Control Board,
there is an ultimate need for the water for
irrigation, but at present there are no spe
cific contracts.
On February 27 of this year, U.S. District
Court Judge Dean Price ruled that the fed
eral government must abide by the state of
California's limitations on filling the reser
voir for fishing, irrigation and water quality
purposes. The state had already set a limit
of 844 feet for the water until there are
signed contracts for irrigation water. Price
also ruled, though, that the federal gov
ernment could entirely fill the Stanislaus
River Canyon for hydroelectric power
production.

STILL FLOWING FREE — Another political battle to prevent the remaining nine miles of
white water on the Stanislaus River from being flooded is now underway in the form or a
statewide ir»'tiative campaign.
