# The
						great solar debate: why the sun was rejected from the new dorm
## 
### Dunny Gifford 
While the recent
groundbreaking for the new
800-student housing complex
near Lake Lagunita began two
years of construction, it
marked the end of a three
year-long debate over the in
stallation of solar water heating
in the buildings.
"Our extensive work proved
that it was not economically
feasible," said Robert Nerrie,
manager of the housing
project. "We have discussed a
lot of propositions and would
like to ignore the costs, but
they (the heating systems) just
would not pay off."
However according to Tom
Goodlin, a student member of
the project advisory commit
tee, the solar option was re
jected because "the University
was concerned with saving
money, not energy."
The issue became con
troversial when Goodlin and
Jonathan Raab, members of
Stanford Energy Action (a stu
dent group concerned with al
ternative energy develop
ment), prepared a study in the
early stages of the project's de
velopment that showed solar
heating to be cost effective.
"We came up with figures
that said the thing would've
paid itself off in five to 10
years," said Goodlin.

As a result of this report,
Goodlin was asked to join the
student, faculty and adminis
trative advisory committee to
James Lyons, dean of student
affairs, that was responsible for
community input during de
velopment.
Goodlin then submitted a
petition to the committee con
taining about 800 signatures
encouraging the installation of
solar heating.
John Eaton, the director of
housing energy conservation
center, who "agrees with solar
energy in general," said
"strong student support defi
nitely encouraged the project
manager to look into it
further."
Student enthusiasm,
coupled with a June, 1980 Santa
Clara County request to ex
plore the possibilities, con
vinced the University to invest
$26,000 in hiring paid econom
ic engineering consultants to
explore solar options.
According to Elizabeth Kitas,
assistant project manager, the
consultants carried out studies
using one of the 90-student,
suite buidings as a prototype.
Pacific Sun, a solar engineer
ing firm, designed eight dif
ferent solar water heating sys
tems models for the building,
using flat plate collectors that
varied in size and cost.

William Swanson, an eco
nomic consultant, and me
chanical engineering professor
at San Jose State University,
evaluated the cost effective
ness of the different systems
and concluded that solar heat
ing would be cost ineffective.
Swanson also examined an
earlier Santa Clara County
analysis that used California
Energy Commission guidelines
and concluded that many of
the parameters used in that
study were not applicable to
the Stanford housing develop
ment.
Using the internal rate of re
turn methodology, a common
University approach which
compares cumulative cost with
cumulative savings, Swanson
determined that solar energy
in each of the eight models de
signed by Pacific Sun could not
be cost effective.
The conclusion of his report
cites two important factors that
determined the economic im
practicality of solar systems.
First, as a non-profit organiza
tion, Stanford does not pay tax
es and is thus, unlike local
home owners, ineligible for tax
write-offs on solar systems.
Second, no special interest
loans for the project are pres
ently available to the Univer
sity.
After considering the results

of the Swanson study, solar sys
tems were dropped from con
sideration. "It doesn't make
much sense to put them in if
they are not economically
feasible," said Nerrie.
According to Goodlin, the
favorable analysis prepared by
Stanford Energy Action
focused on a one-house
model, using University figures
for fuel price increases and a
local firm's estimate of solar
panel costs.
Swanson pointed out that al
though the price of fuel for
Stanford has been stable lately,
"forecasts are forecasts. There
is no way of knowing. It's not a
simple matter."
The most crucial assumption
is the projected fuel price in
crease, according to Gilbert
Masters, adjunct professor of
civil engineering, who has
been involved in solar energy
research for a number of years.
"You can get whatever kind
of results that you want, de
pending on your assump
tions," he said. "It's not a clear
cut process that says 'yes' or
'no.' "
According to Lynda
Weisberg, managerofthe Stan
ford energy program, the in
stallation costs of the solar sys
tem would have amounted to
nearly $850,000 and would
