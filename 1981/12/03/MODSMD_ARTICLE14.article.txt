## Viewpoint/Mike Lanza Arms plan: savvy maneuver 
### 
He has stayed one step ahead of
Congress, the press, and foreign
leaders at every stage since he took
office. He has perhaps accomplished
more in his first 10 months without
sacrificing his ideology than any oth
er American president.
Whether Democrat or Republican,
no observer of the current adminis
tration can help but be impressed
with the political savvy that President
Ronald Reagan has employed in his
short tenure.
His latest initiative, his offer to the
Soviet Union to reduce nuclear
armaments in Europe, is exemplary
of the patented Reagan savvy which
continues to catch so many off guard.
In view of the timing and the sub
stance of this invitation to negotiate,
it is his cleverest political maneuver
to date.
The fact that this announcement
comes just at the time when the ad
ministration is having serious internal
problems is no coincidence. The
feud between Secretary of State
Alexander Haig and national security
adviser Richard Allen, the allegations
that Allen accepted a bribe from a
Japanese magazine, and most signifi
cantly budget director David Stock
man's published criticisms of supply
side economics are all serious and far
reaching problems for the adminis
tration.
In addition to these internal prob
lems the administration is faced with
an approaching recession which will
be far greater in magnitude than it
could have predicted before interest
rates began what is now a precipitous
slide. The recession will hurt many
facets of the economy, but by taking
this bold initiative the president has
abruptly shifted the press' (and
therefore the public's) main focus
from domestic to international is
sues.
The timing of this opening of mis
sile reduction dialogue is also signifi
cant in that it helps Reagan avoid
criticism from his own camp, the po
litical right. Afterall, START (Strategic

Arms Reduction Talks) is a proposal
which has the potential to go way
beyond SALT.
No doubt this proposal disturbs
many hard-line conservatives, but at
a time when their president's politi
cal stock is in jeopardy, they dare not
kick him from behind.
Meanwhile, the Democrats in
Congress along with the leadership
of the Soviet Union have been
caught totally off guard. Clearly, with
this proposal the president has
abruptlvstolen the nucleararmscon
trol initiative from the Democratic
leadership. Ever since he has taken
office he has had Congress backed

Western European spotlight back to the U.S.,
restoring it to its leadership role in nuclear
arms control.

into a corner. His dramatic budget
and tax victories as well as the most
recent AWACS triumphs have devas
tated the Democratic leadership in
Congress. They have been reduced
these last 10 months to reacting to
various Reagan proposals, not able to
take any political initiatives of their
own.
In the past few weeks, though, they
had momentarily snatched the politi
cal momentum from the adminis
ration by making the most of its in
ternal problems and capitalizing in
the weakening economy. But with
Reagan's announcement of nuclear
missile reduction talks on Nov. 8, the
Democrat's momentum has at the
verv least been significantly im
peded.
Reagan's proposal has bested the
Soviet leadership as well. Due to
some political mismanagement of
their own, the Soviets are now em
broiled in an intense political strug
gle with Poland which demands
much of their attention. Thus, they
have been unable to take the peace
maker initiative, which would enable

them to exploit the strong anti-nu
clear sentiment fomenting in
Western Europe, particular in West
Germany.
Reagan's striking proposal shifts
the Western European spotlight back
to the U.S., restoring it to its leader
ship role in nuclear arms control. The
Soviets can do little now but nitpick
at specifics of the Reagan proposal.
They dare not reject outright such a
widely popular peace initiative.
For all its political merits, though,
Reagan's dramatic nuclear missile re
duction proposal has not erased the
manv problems which still loom large
over his administration. David Stock-

man can never retract his Atlantic
Monthly confessions. The adminis
tration's foreign policy power struc
ture is still in a shambles. And, of
course, this proposal has done noth
ing to change the economy's down
ward course.
What it has done is to buy time for
the administration. A fierce, never
ending power struggle rages in the
political arena, and politics is such
that no single entity is likely to have a
firm grip on political power for any
extended period of time. The victor is
that entity which is able to exploit its
momentum to the fullest when in
possession of it, and which is able to
thwart the momentum of others
when its control over political events
is slipping. The budget victories, the
tax victory, and the AWACS victory
all are examples of the former. This
recent missile reduction proposal ex
emplifies the latter.
Because the administration has
been able to exploit to the utmost its
triumphsand also divert attention, or
'buy time' when it is in hot water, it
has been the unequivocal victor in
the political struggle over its 10
month tenure.
Because the administration speaks
with one voice, because it has a firm
sense of direction tempered by an
astute perception of political reality,
the Reagan administration has out
performed both the Democrats in
Congress and the ooviet leadership,
both of which lack a leader of Rea
gan's magnitude.
Undoubtedly, if the administration
sits back to admire its lofty stature, it
will risk relinquishing all that it has so
masterfully gained. But, with Reagan,
a man who perhaps perceives this
danger better than anyone, at the
helm, we could be witnessing the
formation of a coalition of historic
proportions.

Reagan's proposal has bested the
Soviet leadership as well. Due to
some political mismanagement of
their own, the Soviets are now em
broiled in an intense political strug
gle with Poland which demands
much of their attention. Thus, they
have been unable to take the peace
maker initiative, which would enable

them to exploit the strong anti-nu
clear sentiment fomenting in
Western Europe, particular in West
Germany.
Reagan's striking proposal shifts
the Western European spotlight back
to the U.S., restoring it to its leader
ship role in nuclear arms control. The
Soviets can do little now but nitpick
at specifics of the Reagan proposal.
They dare not reject outright such a
widely popular peace initiative.
For all its political merits, though,
Reagan's dramatic nuclear missile re
duction proposal has not erased the
manv problems which still loom large
over his administration. David Stock-

man can never retract his Atlantic
Monthly confessions. The adminis
tration's foreign policy power struc
ture is still in a shambles. And, of
course, this proposal has done noth
ing to change the economy's down
ward course.
What it has done is to buy time for
the administration. A fierce, never
ending power struggle rages in the
political arena, and politics is such
that no single entity is likely to have a
firm grip on political power for any
extended period of time. The victor is
that entity which is able to exploit its
momentum to the fullest when in
possession of it, and which is able to
thwart the momentum of others
when its control over political events
is slipping. The budget victories, the
tax victory, and the AWACS victory
all are examples of the former. This
recent missile reduction proposal ex
emplifies the latter.
Because the administration has
been able to exploit to the utmost its
triumphsand also divert attention, or
'buy time' when it is in hot water, it
has been the unequivocal victor in
the political struggle over its 10
month tenure.
Because the administration speaks
with one voice, because it has a firm
sense of direction tempered by an
astute perception of political reality,
the Reagan administration has out
performed both the Democrats in
Congress and the ooviet leadership,
both of which lack a leader of Rea
gan's magnitude.
Undoubtedly, if the administration
sits back to admire its lofty stature, it
will risk relinquishing all that it has so
masterfully gained. But, with Reagan,
a man who perhaps perceives this
danger better than anyone, at the
helm, we could be witnessing the
formation of a coalition of historic
proportions.
(Mike Lanza is a sophomore major

He has stayed one step ahead of
Congress, the press, and foreign
leaders at every stage since he took
office. He has perhaps accomplished
more in his first 10 months without
sacrificing his ideology than any oth
er American president.
Whether Democrat or Republican,
no observer of the current adminis
tration can help but be impressed
with the political savvy that President
Ronald Reagan has employed in his
short tenure.
His latest initiative, his offer to the
Soviet Union to reduce nuclear
armaments in Europe, is exemplary
of the patented Reagan savvy which
continues to catch so many off guard.
In view of the timing and the sub
stance of this invitation to negotiate,
it is his cleverest political maneuver
to date.
The fact that this announcement
comes just at the time when the ad
ministration is having serious internal
problems is no coincidence. The
feud between Secretary of State
Alexander Haig and national security
adviser Richard Allen, the allegations
that Allen accepted a bribe from a
Japanese magazine, and most signifi
cantly budget director David Stock
man's published criticisms of supply
side economics are all serious and far
reaching problems for the adminis
tration.
In addition to these internal prob
lems the administration is faced with
an approaching recession which will
be far greater in magnitude than it
could have predicted before interest
rates began what is now a precipitous
slide. The recession will hurt many
facets of the economy, but by taking
this bold initiative the president has
abruptly shifted the press' (and
therefore the public's) main focus
from domestic to international is
sues.
The timing of this opening of mis
sile reduction dialogue is also signifi
cant in that it helps Reagan avoid
criticism from his own camp, the po
litical right. Afterall, START (Strategic

Arms Reduction Talks) is a proposal
which has the potential to go way
beyond SALT.
No doubt this proposal disturbs
many hard-line conservatives, but at
a time when their president's politi
cal stock is in jeopardy, they dare not
kick him from behind.
Meanwhile, the Democrats in
Congress along with the leadership
of the Soviet Union have been
caught totally off guard. Clearly, with
this proposal the president has
abruptlvstolen the nucleararmscon

leadership. Ever since he has taken
office he has had Congress backed

and tax victories as well as the most
recent AWACS triumphs have devas
tated the Democratic leadership in
Congress. They have been reduced
these last 10 months to reacting to
various Reagan proposals, not able to
take any political initiatives of their
own.
In the past few weeks, though, they
had momentarily snatched the politi
cal momentum from the adminis
ration by making the most of its in

the weakening economy. But with
