## Saudi peace plan faulty, insupportable 
### 
In the wake of Saudi Arabia's inability to muster
Arab support for its embryonic peace plan at the
recent Moroccan summit, supporters of that plan
mourn its passing and continue to hope for its
eventual adoption as the only way of breaking the
Middle east stalemate. Unfortunately, nothing
could be further from the truth; the Saudi plan was
ill-conceived and structurally faulty. More im
portantly, its gist and direction were such that no
rational Israeli — whether a supporter of Begin's
policies or not — could acquiesce in its demands
upon Israel.
The Saudi plan was basically an attempt to take
advantage of a dangerously simplistic view of the
dynamics of Middle Eastern geopolitics that has
been gaining acceptance lately even among many
who believe they have Israel's best long-term in
terests in mind. At the heart of the matter is the
misconception that the one major obstacle to
peace in the region is Israel's unwillingness to deal
with the Palestinian issue in meaningful terms its
unwillingness to grant the Palestinians a state of
their own.
According to this view, once Israel recognizes
the Palestinians — and the PLO as their legitimate
representative — as equal partners in any peace
negotiations, Yasir Arafat, and presumably the en
tire array of PLO splinter groups plus the rejec
tionist Arab states (that's everyone except Egypt,
Sudan and Oman) will fall into line.
Once Arafat gets his state, Israel will get the
peace it has sought all along. Unfortunately
goes this viewpoint — Israeli intransigence and
shortsightedness so far seem to preclude such de
velopments.
There is a Palestinian problem; to deny that is
patently absurd, and most thoughtful Israelis will
readily admit that eventual accommodation with
these people is a prerequisite for any sustainable
and comprehensive peace. Unfortunately, the
Palestinian problem hasbecome the prime sustain
ing vehicle of the Pan-Arab myth. In the peculiar
and fragmented world of internal Arab politics,
the plight of the Palestinians has come to embody
— for states which may disagree about practically
everything else — a semblance of cohesiveness, a
unity of purpose and the fleeting dream of Pan-
Arabism.
No matter that Algeria and Morocco, Syria and
Iraq, Iraq and Iran are currently involved in dis
putes that have more often than not turned
bloody. No matter that the PLO itself has, over the

years, been kicked out by the Jordanians (1970,
with hundreds of Palestinians killed) or mauled by
the Syrians (1980, again with hundreds of Palesti
nians killed). Despite all that, the question of
Palestinian rights continues to be the one overrid
ing critical contingency within the Arab world.
The rationale is clear; focusing only on the
Palestinian issue (and, within that context, on Is
rael's steadfast refusal to deal with the PLO) has be
come the acid test of an Arab regime's commit
ment to what Michael Hudson, in his book Arab
Politics, calls "the integration of the Arab home
land." It is both proof of commitment and a source
of legitimacy. Remarkably, even Arab regimes
which would doubtless feel threatened by a pro-
Soviet, PLO-dominated state support it in word.
Finally, it was Sadat's brazen flouting of that sym
bol — by attempting to both achieve peace with Is
rael and simultaneously continue to pursue a set
tlement of the Palestinian problem — that was his
ultimate downfall in the Arab world.
The other side of this coin has been the ex
tensive and repeated use of the Palestinian issue by
non-Arab states to curry favor within the Arab
world. For example, one won't find many Western
European leaders declaring support for the op
pressed Kurdish minority in Iraq; I guess that kind
of thing doesn't yield much in the way of leverage
or oil or arms deals.
But curiously, you will find substantial numbers
of European parliamentary delegations visiting
with Arafat in Beirut and affirming their support
for PLO participation in the peace process. Such
Western support has been so prevalent because,
bluntly, it is a cost-effective way to gain popularity
in an area of the world that — besides itsoil wealth
— represents the single largest market for arms in
existence.
Israel is accused of inflexibility. A dispassionate
examination of the historical record, however, re
veals otherwise. In 1947, it was the Jewish com
munity of Palestine which gratefully accepted the
United Nation's offer to partition Palestine and
create two independent states, one Arab and one
Jewish. Two days later, the Palestinian Arabs took
up arms against the Jewish community.
In 1956, Israel again took a calculated risk by
evacuating the Sinai after being promised that
U.N. forces would serve as a buffer between Egypt
and Israel; when Egypt's Nasser demanded the
U.N. withdraw in June, 1967, it took exactly one
dav for Secretary General U. Thant to comply.

Finally, in 1978, Israel agreed to give up the same
Sinai peninsula — its only physical buffer against
attack from the south — in return for what most of
you reading this take for granted — the opportuni
ty to go through life free of the real and constant
threat of massive physical violence perpetrated
against you, your family, or your friends. Such has
been Israel's "intransigence."
What can Israel look forward to — in the way of
risks and rewards — within the context of the Saudi
peace plan? The plan is nebulous and unclear, call
ing for guaranteeing the rights of all states in the
area without ever mentioning Israel by name.
It does, however, stipulate that a Palestinian
state be created on the West Bank with East Jerusa
lem as its capital. And here isthe crux of the dilem
ma: can Israel take the risk of agreeing to such a
vague formula without adequate reassurances or
proof of its true intent? Ultimately, can Israel rec
ognize the PLO and sanction the creation of a PLO
state only ten miles from downtown Tel Aviv and
one mile from downtown Jerusalem? I wish the an
swer were positive, but it is an emphatic "no."
Despite appeals by Western governments to the
PLO to drop some of the extreme language used in
its "covenant," that document still states (article
15) that "the liberation of Palestine is a national
duty, and it aims at the elimination of Zionism in
Palestine." In May 1970, Arafat's own organization,
Al-Fatah, at its fourth Congress reaffirmed its ul
timate goal: "to liberate Palestine completely, and
to liquidate the Zionist entity politically, economi
cally, militarily, culturally and ideologically."
Against such a backdrop, and considering the
enormous buildup of arms in the rejectionist states
(which together have more tanks and jets than
does NATO), it would be irrational for Israel to ac
cept the Saudi peace plan or anything resembling
it. Despite Israel's image as a potent military force
in the Middle East, that success has come only at a
tremendous cost in economic development and is
largely responsible for triple-digit inflation and
soaring trade deficit.
And despite that image, Israel still numbers less
than four million people who have learned — the
hard way — that few will stick their necks out for it
when it comes down to brass tacks.
For us, the slogan "you only go around once in
life" has a distinct double-meaning, and the need
for survival both precedes and transcends the
need for affiliation.
