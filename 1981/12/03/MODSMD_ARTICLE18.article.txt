# Diaphragm 'clinic' harmful
## Viewpoint/Carolyn Lumsden

Cowell Student Health Center re
cently announced a policy that I find
even more alarming than the rise in
pregnancies it is supposedly con
cerned about.
According to an article published
in the Daily last month, Cowell re
ported that it "will now issue
diaphragms only to those women
who attend one of two Thursday
classes on diaphragm use."
The reason for this, a spokesman
explained, is that Cowell noted a rise
both in unplanned pregnancies and
in diaphragm use. Evidently it equat
ed the two, assuming that women
who use the diaphragm use it wrong,
and that this accounts for the rise in
pregnancies.
But I had always been under the
impression that the reason there
were so many unplanned pregnan
cies is not that women, especially
very young women, don't use
diaphragms correctly; it is that they
don't use them, or any other form of
birth control, at all.
And I'm afraid that if Cowell
wanted to insure a rise in unplanned
pregnancies, it couldn't have picked
a better way.
Did Cowell ever consider that de
nying diaphragms to teenagers too
busy, embarrassed, protective of
their privacy, or afraid of getting
raped to come to the clinic on Thurs
day night might not prevent preg
nancies? That it might not be a good
idea to put conditions on getting a
diaphragm?
"I don't see it as a condition," said
a counselor at one recent clinic, to
which no one showed up. "I see it as
an opportunity."

Obviously, given that night's atten
dance, not many people see it the
same way. If Cowell would stretch its
imagination for a moment, it would
see that the last thing most women
would want to do if they were con
templating such an intimate decision
as birth control for the first time
would he to go to a stranger, let alone
a roomful of strangers, to discuss it.
The exam itself is bad enough.
But there aren't many alternatives.
Costs of private gynecological exams
are too high for many students to go
off campus. Other effective means of
contraception — the pill with its well
known hazards to health, the lUD
with its womb-tearing excruciating
fitting — are too dangerous. In fact,
some studies have shown abortions
to have a lower death rate than either
of those two forms of contraception.
Furthermore, California law
doesn't require parental approval of
abortions for minors. It is, therefore,
easier for a young woman at Stanford
to get an abortion — if she feels birth

control is no one's business but her
own and her doctor's — than it is for
her to get a diaphragm.
To get her to use it right is her doc
tor's job. Yet the Cowell counselor at
the clinic argued that one of the rea
sons the clinic exists is to "save time
in the doctor's office." The condi
tions under which a young woman
enters the doctor's office aren't con
ducive to her having a conversation
about birth control, she argued, and I
think she has a point.
Cowell's doctors and counselors
mean well. But by imposing this clinic
on young women, they will cause
more harm — and pregnancies —
than good. They will succeed in scar
ing away or infuriating the young
woman for whom this represents just
one more impediment to her getting
{decent contraception — and one
more control which someone else
exerts over her life.
