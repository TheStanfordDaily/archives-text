## Hoover: no constraints on diverse opinions 
### 
The paragraph attributing
statements to President Donald Ken
nedy regarding the Hoover Institu
tion in your article (Daily, Nov. 11) re
garding his comments on various
subjects in a KZSU program implies
that the Hoover Institution isthought
to have "institutional beliefs" on
matters of public policy.
As a Stanford graduate ('2B), I
would be dismayed if any part of the
University had institutional beliefs.
As an emeritus professor from anoth
er university (Harvard), I would not
be here if I felt there were any con
tracts on my opinions, whether very
conservative or very liberal, what
ever those words mean.

As a long-time friend and former
professor of the Director (Glenn
Campbell), I know that he would
neither expect nor tolerate any at
tempt to establish an institutional be
lief. As an admirer of Donald Ken
nedy, on both a personal and a pro
fessional basis, I am sure he respects
the right of all faculty members to
their diverse individual opinions, just
as they respect his right, as a dist
inguished individual, to state his own
opinions on whatever topics concern
him greatly.
