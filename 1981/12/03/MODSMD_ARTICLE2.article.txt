# Zete members file petitions
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
All 54 members currently living in the Zeta Psi fraterni
ty have sent separate but identical petitions to the Om
budsman raising concern over a housing office decision
to consider "prior affiliation" in judging the future ac
tions of ex-Zetes.
The petitions were filed Nov. 18 and 19.
The fraternity, wtiicb bns ■fcwen suspended for three
years, has yet to receive an official response, according
to Mike Zboralske, president of the Zetes.
The petitions assert that Associate Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson, "still reserves the right, that
should future incidents occur, although the fraternity
has been disbanded, he will judge me in accordance
with my prior affiliation to Zeta Psi."
Though the petitions praised the decision to reverse a
rule which would have limited the numberof Zetes who
could live together in future housing assignments, they
objected to the "prior affiliation" clause. The reversal
was announced by Robinson on Nov. 11.
Each petition states, "I, a member of Zeta Psi regard
Norm Robinson's latest statement retracting the two
Zete per residence as a step in the right direction. I also
feel, however, that this retraction is still not an equitable
sanction."
Zboralske said that they understoood the sanction to
mean that if two or three Zetes broke a window some
time in the future, for example, they would be dealt with
as former Zetes, not as individuals.
He said it was the unanimous feeling of fraternity

members that they go on record as wishing to insure and
guard their rights to due process.
"The day I recieved the petitions I sent them to (Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's) office," said Ombudsman John
Goheen. "My understanding was that they (the fraterni
ty members) understood that they were being sent to the
president's office," he said.
"The petitions raised a very important question that
has never been raised before," said Goheen. "They
raised the question of group rights as opposed to Indi
vidual rights. Almost all the regualations at this Univer
sity are in terms of individuals."
Zete members seemed to be saying that their individ
ual due process rights have been bypassed, Goheen
added. He called this "something that should be careful
ly thought about."
Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the president for trustee
affairs, who is handling the petitions, has not taken any
action so far.
"Please rest assured that I'm not going to sit on them,"
he said, explaining that he received the petitions just last
week and has not had time to look at them because of
other pressing demands.
Hamrdla said he wants to consult various University
administrators before making his recommendations to
Kennedy. He said Kennedy has not yet looked at them,
but will be reviewing them soon.
One of the problems is that they are addressed to the
University, rather than to a particular person, Hamrdla
said.
