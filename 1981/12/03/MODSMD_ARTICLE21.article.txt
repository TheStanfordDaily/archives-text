# Communications class aims to prove that engineers can write after all
## 
### Laurie Rackas 
When the Undergraduate Council of the
School of Engineering could not find a stu
dent in 1976 who deserved the $500 McKin
ney Prize for outstanding writing, it went in
search of a good writing program. It hired El
len Nold, then head of the undergraduate
writing program, to develop a speech and
writing program for engineers.
"If you don't write well and don't speak
well, especially in industry, you don't rise . . .
you don't make it," said Brent Davis, for
merly a teaching assistant to Nold and now a
director of the School of Engineering's five
year-old Communications Project.
Last year, on a budget of just under
$70,000, the project supplied speech and
writing tutors for 940 graduate and under
graduate students, 87 percent (815) of whom
were engineers. This year's slightly reduced
budget will pay for the full-time services of
Davis and co-director Francesca Venning,
and 31 part-timetutors whoarealsofull-time
students.
The Communications Project offers 17 ac
credited speech and writing courses, 12 of
them taught by tutors. It also provides
trained students to be used as formal tutors
in engineering courses. At least 22 engineer
ing courses will be using tutors this year, ac
cording to Professor Leonard Ortolano of
the Civil Engineering Department.
"It is important from a narrow professional
perspective" for engineers to know how to
communicate well, said Ortolano.
Ortolano used both writing and speech
tutors in his Water Resources Planning class.
It is the kind of class where having tutors
makes sense, he said, since students must
complete both a written assignment and an
oral presentation. Students are required to
work with the writing tutors on the outline,
the first draft, and the rewrite of the paper.
They then make a "dry run" of the oral pres
entation before the speech tutor, who eval
uates the speaker and makes suggestions for
improvement.
Students interested in working as tutors
compete for acceptance into a tutor training
course. If they are chosen, they spend a
quarter learning teaching techniques de

veloped bv Nold. The following quarter they
,iro farmed out as apprentices to seasoned
tutors; if they perform well, they are as
signed as tutors the next quarter.
"The program is unique in that it runs with
a limited number of professionals," said
Davis. The system of using students to coach
and tutor other students was an idea de
veloped by Nold to aid in cutting costs. Un
dergraduate tutors are paid $6-7 an hour;
graduate students get a comparable salary,
and a percentage of their tuition is paid.
Using students to teach otherstudents has
sparked some controversy, according to Or
tolano, although he has been"uniformly im
pressed with the tutors." The Industrial Engi
neering Department has decided not to use
writing tutors this year because "students
didn't like having their peers. . .telling them
how to write," said Professor Warren
Hausman.
A survey conducted last year by the Com
inuniations Project office said that 92 per
cent of the students tutored in speech and 78
percent of the students tutored in writing
felt they had improved.
The project also has been a successoutside
the University. Engineering 102W, a course
taught by Davis, called "Writing for the
World of Work, is transmitted live via Stan
ford Instructional Television to people in lo
cal industries. A computer program de
veloped by Nold as a writer-training system
has been fed into EDUNET, a federal.y
funded computer network linked to major
universities. It is the program most often re
quested from Stanford by other institutions.
Despite its successes, the Communica
tions Project faces a few obstacles, said Or
tolano. Funding is a problem. Through
1980-81, the project was funded by the Of
fice of the Dean of Engineering ($52,000),
and private contributions ($2000).
This year the Dean's office reduced its
contribution to $24,000, and individual engi
neering departments were asked to support
the project with departmental funds. So far,
money has been committed by only three
departments: Chemical Engineering, Me
chanical Engineering, and Electrical Engi
neering.
