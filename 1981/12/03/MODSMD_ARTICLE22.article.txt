# Debate team at Stanford is alive and expanding
## 
### Polly Grunfeld 
There really is a Stanford
debate team and it's con
tinually expanding.
Mariann Byerwalter, a res
ident assistant (R.A.) at
Branner, and herself a
championship debater, is
the coach of the two year
old team. She also teaches a
two-unit undergraduate
special debate course,
whose 20 members essen
tially comprise the debate
team.
Byerwalter stresses logical
skills in both coaching the

team and teaching the class.
This refers to thinking, pres
entation and organization,
rather than the pure ac
cumulation of facts and de
tails.
The team members see
the process of debate as one
which broadens their view
of the world. The beginners
learn from the advanced de
baters, while the advanced
learn from one another. The
competition may be an in
tramural or intercollegiate
debate.
The intramural matches,
one of the Byerwalter's in
novations, are facul
tv/student debates based in

Branner Hall and funded by
Residential Education. This
year's topics will include
Reaganomics and nuclear
deployment in Europe.
The Intercoflegiate
matches, held on both nov
ice and open (advanced)
levels, are open to students
whenever they believe they
are ready. At the recent re
gional competition held at
Berkeley, Claude Millman
and Debbie Swensen,
freshmen partners, took 3rd
place in the advanced
division, and Ist and 3rd
places respectively for indi
vidual speakers. Jerry
Wertheim, a sophomore,
won 3rd in extemporaneous
speaking. The "big debate"
(Voltaire debate) against
Berkeley will be hosted here
later this year.
The nationwide topic for
this year examines if the
United States should signifi
cantly curtail the power of
labor unions.
Millman believes that
"everyone has it (the ability
to debate); it just has to be
developed."
