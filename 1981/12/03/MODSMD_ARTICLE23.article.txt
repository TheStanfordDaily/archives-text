# New SMG stresses patient care

The Stanford Medical Group (SMG)
symbolizes the University's increased con
cern for patient care, according to the pro
gram's co-director Dr. Michael Jacobs. An
association of two full-time physicians and
12 professors of medicine, the SMG has
been operating a clinic in the Braswell
Clinic Building of the Medical Center
since Sept. 1.
"We're trying (o give fhe patient a little
extra care ... to go the second mile," said
Marjorie Dunn, the staff nurse for the
SMG.
Unlike the General Medical Clinic or the
University Hospital which emphasize
teaching and research as much as they
stress treatment, the SMG focuses on pa
tient care, according to the Medical Cen
ter News Bureau.
The first person an SMG patient sees is a
faculty member, Jacobs said. Rather than
only caring for the patient in an emer
gency, as is usually the case at the Univer
sity Hospital, the SMG physician will care
for the patient regularly if the patient so
wishes. Although the SMG must operate
within the financial and organizational
framework of the University, the fees
charged by the SMG are comparable to
those of private practitioners.
Students and resident physicians are
only associated with clinic as observers,
and take no direct part in the care.
In addition to the primary care practice,
the SMG runs a heart disease prevention
program for executives, a disease screen
ing service for animal handlers working in
University labs, and a consultation and re
ferral service.
"I think this is a major traditional break
through at Stanford," said Jacobs. "For

years, research has been foremost at Stan
ford."
Jacobs said he believes the Medical Cen
ter's need for a regular clientele inspired
the turn-around: "To really run a medical
school, you must have a patient base to
draw from. To develop this base, you must
provide services above and beyond the
first time visit. This is (what) the SMG
(does)."
jacobs added that the revenue the SMC
generates will help supplement the re
duced funds available for research.
While the semi-private clinic idea may
be new to Stanford, Jacobs said that the

SMG may be a "Johnny-come-lately" to
the trend of primary care clinics.
Duke University established its "Private
Diagnostic Clinics" when Duke Medical
School was founded in 1932. Likewise,
Massachusetts General Hospital, the
teaching hospital for Harvard Medical
School, began its "Internal Medicine As
sociates" (IMA) in 1972.
Unlike Stanford, in which students and
resident physicians participate as ob
servers, both Duke and Massachusetts
General incorporate students and resident

physicians into their primary care pro
grams.
"I think it's morally, ethnically, and
philosophically wrong (not to allow stu
dents to participate in the care)," said Dr.
John Stoeckle of Harvard's IMA.
The SMG strives to cater to people who
want to be cared for by faculty members,
Jacobs said. However, Jacobs sees no rea
son scholarship within the SMG should not
be encouraged, as long as it doesn't in
terfere with treatment.
"From an educational standpoint, we
hope the SMG will provide an accurate
model of private practice," Jacobs said.

Gelpi said the program seems to be run
ning smoothly, but alluded to fears of al
ienating practicing physicians who feel the
SMG, with its hospital base of operation, is
offering unfair competition. Gelpi added
that the SMG has not yet run into this prob
lem.
In Boston, Stoeckle said private physi
cians approach the IMA with a "polite,
veiled hostility." On the other hand, the
associate dean of medical education at
Duke said that private practitioners are re
ceptive to the PDC program.
