# Students teach art of real estate
## 
### Steve Lebovitz 
Stanford students often complain that
there are not enough undergraduate classes
which offer practical knowledge and specific
preparation for a career. But for the 26 stu
dents enrolled in the Undergraduate Special
Introduction to Real Estate, this complaint
doesn't apply.
The class is taught by seniors Chip Conley
and Christopher Bonbright, both economics
majors and licensed real estate salesmen.
They teach by dividing the real estate busi
ness into three main sections: theoretical and
conceptual basis, practical applications, and
trends and outlook. Said one student, "The
technique of instruction is unique, as prac
tical issues are not only discussed but are also
implemented."
The class recently studied a new income
producing office building in downtown Palo
Alto. The study included an on-site analysis
tour given by the building's developer, in
which students played the role of an invest
ment group, calculating the viability of this
project as an investment.
In many ways, the class resembles "a prac
tical lab looking at the actual steps taken by
an investor in calculating his potential re
turns," said Conley.
Both Conley and Bonbright are newcomers
to the field of teaching, but have a con
siderable amount of experience in the real es
tate industry. The combined experience of
the two gives the class what one student calls
"a professional air that very few under
graduate classes can match."

Said Bonbright, "The fact that our students
are extremely enthusiastic about the class
makes it that much easier to teach and also
that much more rewarding."
The 10 guest speakers who visit the class
during the quarter add practical anecdotes to
complement the theoretical information out
lined in the course. Speakers included Harold
Ellis, founder of Grubb and Ellis, the second
largest real estate brokerage firm in the U.S.;
Peter Bedford, president of Bedford As
sociates, one of the Bay Area's active real es
tate developers; and Samuel Freshman, who
flew up from Los Angeles to speak about the
operation of his property investment and
management firm.
The enthusiasm generated from the course
has led a group of students to form an under
graduate real estate organization. While the
name is still undecided, the club will begin
operation at the start of winter quarter.
"The objective of the organization will be
to make Stanford students more aware of the
opportunities and issues related to the real
estate industry," said Junior Doug Kessler.
The club will have numerous functions in
cluding organizing symposiums and career
forums, starting a mini-library with various
real estate publications and periodicals, and
establishing an alumni contact service.
One unique function will be to establish a
group investment seminar through which
students will have the chance to learn about
investment opportunities. The ultimate ob
jective will be to pool available funds into a
limited partnership real estate investment.
