# Mendicants tune up for Holiday
## 
### Hyo Yeon Annette Makino 
If there is one thing students
look forward to during Dead
Week, it's probably the Stan
ford Mendicants' traditional
Dead Week performance at
Meyer Library. The Stanford
Mendicants, a 16-member
men's vocal ensemble, who
have just come out with a tenth
album, have been performing
for the Stanford community for
the past 19 years.
The first Mendicant audi
tions were held in the winter of
1963 by Yale dropout Hank
Adams, who wished to dupli
cate the popular men's singing
groups of the Ivy League
schools.
The group's first concert was
given at Branner Hall, then an
all-women's dormitory. As the
first men's vocal ensemble at
Stanford, the Mendicants were
a novelty.
During the Vietnam War, the
group's cleancut, suit-and-tie
image underwent a dramatic
change. "It just seemed inap
propriate to go to a dorm and
sing a lot of humorous songs
while the War was in progress,"
said Music Director Mark
Keller.
In 1971, the Mendicants
broke up for a four-month pe
riod, then re-established them
selves, dressing more casually,
and singing more varied mate
rial.
This year, competition for a
position in the group was so in
tense that 50 men auditioned
for the five available spots.
"Sixteen members is a very
tough number to work with,"
said Keller. "You have to be
sensitive to each singer be
cause there are not enough
people to cover up the mis
takes."
The Mendicants rehearse
four hours weeklyand perform
two hours a week. They esti
mate that by the end of the year
their repertoire will consist of
40 to 60 songs, ranging from
"Barbershop to Blues." Au
dience favorites according to
Keller, are "Suite: Judy Blue
Eyes" by Crosby, Stills, Nash
and Young, "Martha My Dear"
by the Beatles and "Satin Doll"
by Duke Ellington.
"Singing with the Mendi
cants is the best way I know to
relax and totally remove myself

from the Univesity/'said mem
ber Chris Ehly. "Here there are
no midterms and no tensions."
A March 11, 1981 review in
the Los Angeles Times de
scribed their singing as"sweet,
true, youthful and buoyant,
with humor and optimism ... I
could see why the girls would
go crazy over them .. . They
were a charming bunch of

rascals."
The group's current project
is planning and raising funds
for a five-week tour of the Far
East in the summer of 1982.
The Mendicants are hoping
to see big sales of their new
album, entitled "Clean-cut but
Slightly Frayed" (from a review
in the Los Angeles Times) to
help finance the trip.

Future performances in
clude the Dead Week concert
in Meyer Library, a wine-tast
ing event at the end of winter
quarter and a spring concert in
Memorial Church. Keller says
he hopes to see the group per
form more spontaneously this
year. "That's the reason for our
existence, really. Where we
just cruise in — in a relaxed set
ting — and sing."
