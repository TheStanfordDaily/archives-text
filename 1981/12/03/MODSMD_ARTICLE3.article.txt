# O'Connor writes her first High Court opinion
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington — In her first signed opinion as a
United States Supreme Court justice, Sandra Day
O'Connor — the Stanford Law School Graduate
and first woman ever to sit on the High Court
bench — wrote for a unanimous court in ruling
that the Interior Department does not have to ex
periment with new leasing systems in future sales
of offshore oil-drilling rights.
Displaying the same straightforward, lucid and
no-frill writing that characterized her work as an
Arizona state judge, O'Connor's decision, handed
down this week, dealt with an interpretation of a
1953 law, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act
and amendments to it which were added in 1978.
Such casesoffer little insight intothejudicial phi
losophy of the opinion's author, sources noted.
The first 10 pages of her 17-page opinion featured a

statement of the facts and a discussion of whether
California had legal standing to be in the case. The
opinion's 19 footnotes dealt primarily with statu
tory language and legislative history. In such cases,
' the court must decide what Congress meant when
it passed a disputed law.
"We are unable to find anything, either in the
legislative history or in the 1978 amendments
themselves, that compels the conclusion that the
Congress as a whole intended to limit the Secretary
of the Interior's discretion to choose among the
various experimental bidding systems," O'Connor
wrote.
In another decision handed down by the court
yesterday, however, O'Connor was one of four
dissenters in a five-four decision ruling that em
ployees with access to confidential information are

generally entitled to join unions and be protected
by federal labor laws.
The decision, likely to affect thousands of secre
taries and other white collar workers, returned the
protection of labor laws to employees with access
to confidential information. The other dissenters
were Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices
Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist, all, like
O'Connor, considered conservative justices.
The 191-year-old sex barrier which had sur
rounded the Supreme Court was broken in July
when President Ronald Reagan appointed
O'Connor, 55, to fill the seat vacated on the court
by Justice Potter Stewart.
After graduating from the Law School in 1952,
O'Connor had served as a San Mateo County pros
ecutor and a legislator in the Arizona State Senate
and Assembly.
