# Williams makes
## live for a night 
### Jonathan Treitel 
A man strode onto a stage
and stood before a desk. . .
Picture him: middle-aged, a
stately paunch, a bulbous nose,
longish grey hair tucked back
behind his ears, and a W
shaped beard jerking en
thusiastically from his chin as if
joining in the applause; he
sported black shoes, black
trousers, and a black frockcoat
with a red geranium in the but
tonhole.
. . .He stood before the desk,
a solid, determined-looking
lectern equipped with an arm
rest, a ledge for a glass of water,
and an inset of crimson baize;
on which he deposited four
massive leather-bound tomes.
Carefully, dexterously, he
peeled off his white gloves;
made as if to lay them on the
books; thought the better of it;
coughed; and replaced them
on the ledge. . .
This man was Charles
Dickens in 1853, beginning the
first of his many smash-hit tours
reading from his own work.
This man was also the Welsh
actor Emlyn Williams in 1951,
beginning the first of hi:s many
smash-hit tours pretending to
be Charles Dickens.
Since then, Williams has
brought his one-man show to
enthusiastic audiences on five
continents, and he has devised
a dozen other literary im
personations: a whole coterie
ful, including Saki, John
Aubrey, and Dylan Thomas. He
has achieved success as a play
wright and novelist as well.
And finally, in 1981, he arrived
in the city for a fortnight tour
which he has just finished.
. . .Williams-cum-Dickens
glanced up; glanced down;
opened one volume; closed it;
opened another, and suddenly
and rapidly he was reciting in a
middle-class London accent,
and the stage was populated by
the characters of Our Mutual
Friend.
First came Wilfer, the
cherubic impoverished clerk,

and as Williams described him,
for an instant his own cheeks
bulged, his lips curled up
wards, and the cherubic face of
Wilfer flickered across his own.
Then ascending through the
class structure to the Veneer
ings: johnny-come-lately so
cial climbers, a "bran-new"
husband and wife, with a
"bran-new" house, "bran
new" friends they scarcely
know, a "bran-new" marriage,
and as "bran-new" a baby as
decency permits.
Williams performed minor
surgery on Dickens's text for
dramatic effect, swabbing out
redundant plot description un
til the similes sparkled and
tesselated like pietro dura.
The next scene underwent a
more drastic operation. He
took "The Black Veil" from
Sketches by floz — originally a
melodrama of a young doctor
summoned by a mad woman to
resurrect her hanged son — ex
cised the long-winded moral
conclusion and substituted a
tolling bell signifying the ex
ecution of her son at the adja
cent prison. Williams's version
was sharper focused, and an
improvement on the original.
As Williams was describing
the hanging, the stage
dimmed, until only a single
lime-green spotlight lit hiscon
torted face, and then black out.
Light up in the garret of Bob
Sawyer from The Pickwick Pa
pers, an impecunious young
medical student who's throw
ing a party for his friends:
corny jokes and cold brandy;
and in the midst of this jollifica
tion the stage darkened — and
the light that returned was
more sombre.
This is the sombre life of Paul
Dombey, the son in Domhey
and Son, an "old-fashioned
boy," quiet and uncomplain
ing, who died in childhood.
Williams's stitched together
paragraphs, from his "old-fash
ioned" birth as the longed-for
heir to his "old-fashioned"
Christian death:

How fast the river runs, be
tween its green bank and the
rushes, Floy. Rut it's very neat
the sea. / hear the \,vaves! They
always said so. . .
Oh thank COD, all who see
it, for that older fashion yet, of
Immortality! And look upon
us, angels of young children,
with regards not (fuite
estranged, when the swift river
hears us to the ocean!
Williams deserves credit for
portraying Dickens the moral
ist, and not, as must have been
so tempting, going only for thp
easy laughs in the comic sec
tions.
As a historical note, when
the real Charles Dickens read
from his novels to a Victorian
audience, it was the serious
passages that moved them
most, and the bitter-sweet
death of Little Nell of The Old
Curiosity Shop brought them
to tears.
It's evidently difficult to find
a scene to follow on Paul
jDombey's melancholy death,
and, unsurprisingly, there was
'a quarter of an hour in
termission.
J The audience strolled round
the intimate theatre, into the
cozy Dickensian bar with its
blazing wood fire, downed a
pint of English beer, or a Scotch
whiskey, and returned in suffi
ciently high spirits to hear Wil
liams, in the persona of a
cockney showman, relating the
life of Mr. Chips from Christ
mas Stories.

woman; I never knowed the
dwarf .ts could be get to love a
mall one. Which helps keep
' the luxuries they are. And
t he sec ond was to go into Soci
ety.
To cut a short story even
shorter, he achieved his ambi
tions by winning a lottery; re
sided in Pall Mall and was pre
sented at Court; discovered
the mysterious vices of Society,
and returned, bankrupt and
drunk, to the showman,
whereupon: We found him
gone into a much better Socie
ty than mine, or Pail Mall's.
And from a humble individ
ual's tragicomic battle for life
to The Battle of Life for human
ity at large. Dickens the
philosopher: how men die and
on their graves grow flowers
etc. etc.
Onto and up to the Murdles
of Little Dorrit: he of the wor
thy, weighty conversation, she
of the upholstered bosom. . .
And then another sharp jolt
onto the jolting tumbrils of the
French Revolution: It was the
best of times. It was the worst of
times. . . That famous opening
of The Tale of Two Cities fore
telling the bloodbath to come.
Indeed this is Williams's
technique: to select scenes of
black violence, and light gaie
ty, and layer them like a devil's
food cake.
And the cherry on top, the
finale, was the gruesome
Nurse's tale from The Uncom
mercial Traveller — in fact it's
so gruesome it doesn't bear re
peating — suffice it to say it
persuaded the audience to
grant Williams a 10 minutes'
standing ovation.
What's the secret of his suc
cess? He doesn't resort to gim
micks, or props, or grandiose
stage effects, he doesn't put on
funny voices or funny hats.
i'he simple answer is: great
literature and great acting.

the U.S. to act in Britain. I rec

Wilfer flickered across his own.

Williams performed minor
surgery on Dickens's text for
dramatic effect, swabbing out
redundant plot description un

Sketches by floz — originally a
melodrama of a young doctor

summoned by a mad woman to
resurrect her hanged son — ex
cised the long-winded moral
conclusion and substituted a
tolling bell signifying the ex
ecution of her son at the adja
cent prison. Williams's version
was sharper focused, and an
improvement on the original.
As Williams was describing
the hanging, the stage
dimmed, until only a single
lime-green spotlight lit hiscon
torted face, and then black out.
Light up in the garret of Bob
Sawyer from The Pickwick Pa
pers, an impecunious young
medical student who's throw
ing a party for his friends:
corny jokes and cold brandy;
and in the midst of this jollifica
tion the stage darkened — and
the light that returned was
more sombre.
This is the sombre life of Paul
Dombey, the son in Domhey
and Son, an "old-fashioned
boy," quiet and uncomplain
ing, who died in childhood.
Williams's stitched together
paragraphs, from his "old-fash
ioned" birth as the longed-for
heir to his "old-fashioned"
Christian death:

How fast the river runs, be
tween its green bank and the
rushes, Floy. Rut it's very neat
the sea. / hear the \,vaves! They
always said so. . .
Oh thank COD, all who see
it, for that older fashion yet, of
Immortality! And look upon
us, angels of young children,
with regards not (fuite
estranged, when the swift river
hears us to the ocean!
Williams deserves credit for
portraying Dickens the moral
ist, and not, as must have been
so tempting, going only for thp
easy laughs in the comic sec
tions.
As a historical note, when
the real Charles Dickens read
from his novels to a Victorian
audience, it was the serious
passages that moved them
most, and the bitter-sweet
death of Little Nell of The Old
Curiosity Shop brought them
to tears.
It's evidently difficult to find
a scene to follow on Paul
jDombey's melancholy death,
and, unsurprisingly, there was
'a quarter of an hour in
termission.
J The audience strolled round
the intimate theatre, into the
cozy Dickensian bar with its
blazing wood fire, downed a
pint of English beer, or a Scotch
whiskey, and returned in suffi
ciently high spirits to hear Wil
liams, in the persona of a
cockney showman, relating the
life of Mr. Chips from Christ
mas Stories.

t he sec ond was to go into Soci

To cut a short story even
shorter, he achieved his ambi
tions by winning a lottery; re
sided in Pall Mall and was pre
sented at Court; discovered
the mysterious vices of Society,
and returned, bankrupt and
drunk, to the showman,
whereupon: We found him
gone into a much better Socie

And from a humble individ

Onto and up to the Murdles

And then another sharp jolt
onto the jolting tumbrils of the
French Revolution: It was the
best of times. It was the worst of
times. . . That famous opening
of The Tale of Two Cities fore
telling the bloodbath to come.
Indeed this is Williams's
technique: to select scenes of
black violence, and light gaie
ty, and layer them like a devil's
food cake.
And the cherry on top, the
finale, was the gruesome
Nurse's tale from The Uncom
mercial Traveller — in fact it's
so gruesome it doesn't bear re
peating — suffice it to say it
persuaded the audience to
grant Williams a 10 minutes'
standing ovation.
What's the secret of his suc
cess? He doesn't resort to gim
micks, or props, or grandiose
stage effects, he doesn't put on
funny voices or funny hats.
i'he simple answer is: great
literature and great acting.
Emlyn Williams has now left
the U.S. to act in Britain. I rec
