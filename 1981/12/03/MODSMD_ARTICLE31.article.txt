# An admirable job by ACT
## 
### Fred Cheever 
When I entered the theater to see the Ameri
can Conservatory Theater's production of The
Admirable Crich(on, I was surprised and de
lighted. The overstuffed parlour furniture which
has served ACT through so many seasons of Brit
ish drawing-room comedy was nowhere to be
seen. Instead, the stage had been set with a col
lection of multi-purpose boxes and flats. This
departure from custom promised great things
for the new production and, for the most part,
these promises were fulfilled.
The Admirable Crichton is a wonderful play, a
drawing-room comedy which in the measure of
quality stands head and shoulders above the run
of its species. It is both clever, as a drawing-room
comedy must be, and slightly unsettling, as any
good play should be. Its author, James Barrie,
created in it a monument better suited to stand
the test of time than his more famous Peter Pan.
Through its well-managed wit the play deals
with profound, if not original, issues concerning
the nature of masters and servants, of man in civ
ilization and of man in nature. The play's treat
ment of these weighty issues is anything but
heavy handed. In fact, we are well into the third
act before we realize that the play's treatment of
its situation is not as straightforward as it seems
and that its development does not lend itself to
the simple happy sort of solution one expects
from comedy. Barrie maintains the balance be
tween wit and wisdom to create a comedy which
is more than a comedy, but bears no re
semblance to a sermon.
For the most part, the ACT company supports
this remarkable play with the quality acting for
which they are so well known. John Noah

Hertzler, in the title role, gives a particularly
good performance, timing his deadpan replies
to make the most of the play's funnier moments.
However, the acting of some of the supporting
cast does fall short of the mark. William Paterson
is inflexible in his protrayal of Lord Loam, English
peer made island fool. Thomas Oglesby presents
an unsympathetic picture of the Hon. Ernest
Wooly and Jane Jones is simply too loud in her
rendition of vulgar Eliza, "the Tweeny."

I hasten to add that these weak performances
do very little to spoil the quality of the evening.
For the most part, the professional and in
novative quality of the production complements
the virtues of the play to create wonderful enter
tainment.
So if you are considering an evening at the
ACT and you are looking for something lighter
than Richard 11, but with more substance than I
Remember Mama, I suggest you consider The
Admirable Crichlon. Its admirable qualities will
guarantee you a pleasant evening in town.
