Small clear chords hung in
the air like flowers. The
melodies were like bouquets.
There seemed to be no other
possibilities for life than those
delineated by the music. When
the piece was over Coalhouse
Walkerturned on the stool and
found in his audience the en
tire family. Mother, Father, the
boy, Grandfather and Mother's
Younger Brother, who had
come down from his room in
shirt and suspenders to see
who was playing. Of all of them
he was the only one who knew
ragtime. He had heard it in his
nightlife period in New York.
He had never expected to hear
it in his sister's home.
. . .The pianist sat stiffly at the
keyboard, his long dark hands
with their pink nails seemingly
with no effort producing the
clusters of syncopating chords
and the thumping octaves. This
was a most robust composition,
a vigorous music that roused
the senses and never stood still
a moment. The boy perceived
it as light touching various
places in space, accumulating

in intricate patterns until the
entire room was made to glow
with its own being.
This passage from E. L. Doc
torow's Ragtime is a wonderful
description of the insinuation
of this vivifying rag music into
New York white society in the
early 1900s. Redolent of the
brothels where it was first
played (in Jervis Anderson's
lengthy article on Harlern in
the New Yorker last summer,
we were told that in the early
days of ragtime, no respectable
black family would allow it to
be played in their parlor), it had
a heady, illicit charm that in
evitably broke down the re
sistance of starched-collar lis
teners — an elegant vulgarity.
Poctorow uses the music here
as an emblem, not only of the
epoch covered by the novel
(1902-1916) but also of the nov
el itself, which is a series of
"small clear chords" — sharply
drawn characters, some eccen
tric representations of celebri
ties like Harry Houdini and
Emma Goldmann, some purely
fictive — "robust" and "vigor

ous" and constantly moving.
Ragtime, in which all of the fig
ures touch each other's lives,
usually in mysterious, unan
ticipated ways, is, like Doc
torow's earlier The Rook of
Daniel, about connection, and
the process by which he leads
the reader from one "cluster of
syncopating chords" to the
next is sheerly cinematic. The
last sentence quoted above is
as much a description of the
function of a film, that other
great, vulgar artistic ex
pression, as it is of rag; the most
appropriate of all the book's
surprises is that it takes us to
Hollywood in the end, where
the resourceful Jewish immi
grant Tateh conceives the idea
of the "Our Gang" comedies.
One would think that any
filmmaker embarking on a
movie of Ragtime would un
derstand the significance of
this passage and shoot the
works with it. Milos Forrnan has
c hosen to make it look like one
of those stiff, fake scenes in
Hollywood composer bios (like
the 1945 A Song to Remember,

with Cornel Wilde as Chopin)
in which famous pieces were
wrung out on piano while lis
teners stood frozen in whatwas
supposed to be rapt admiration
— and then to cut away to a
sentimental embrace that is
purest melodrama while the
rag gets buried in orchestra
tion. Thisisindicativeoftheap
proach For man and the
screenwriter, Michael Weller,
have taken to Doctorow's nov
el. They don't seem to have just
misunderstood it; watching
this movie, one wonders if
they've even read it, since their
version rriighi easily be a dis
figurement of someone's plot
synopsis.
When Dino De Laurentiis
bought the rights to Doc
torow's novel in 1975, Robert
Altman had just released Nash
ville, which is really a Ragtime
for the '70s. De Laurentiis hired
Altman to direct the movie as
part of a three-picture deal,
and Altman and Doctorow had
begun to evolve the screenplay
when the first of the three mov
ies, Buffalo Hill and the Indians,
