thought Hair was brilliant, but
its rapid-cut virtuosity stoned
me, and I suspected that it
might be too unlikable to be
really popular (it did, in fact,
lose a lot of money); in
Ragtime, which was also shot
by Forman's countryman,
Miroslav Ondricek, but lacks
Hair's visual magic, Forman's
explicit style is like a wrecker's
ball that he levels at scene after
scene.
Ragtime displays none of
Forman's strengths, or Michael
Weller's (he scripted Hair as
well as the stage plays Moon
children and Loose Ends), but it
underscores all their weak
nesses. Doctorow's book is
deftly ironic; Forman, who
seems to be constitutionally in
capable of delicacy, turns the
irony into burlesque. Tateh
(Mandy Patinkin, who played
Che Guevara in Evita on Broad
way) throws Mameh (the tal
ented comedienne Fran
Drescher, of American Hot
Wax and The Hollywood
Knights) into the streets be
cause she has slept with anoth
er man, in a thundering se
quence that makes the
broadest vaudeville turn in Fid
dler on the Roof look like
Feydeau. Then he goes on to
make two-reelers in Atlantic
City, under the name Baron
Ashkenazy, and Forman and
Weller depict him as a nouveau
riche clodhopper who makes
sentimental speeches to his
cast and crew that noone both
ers listening to. This is un
charitable, not onlytothe actor
but also to Tateh, who in the
book drags his beloved daugh
ter out of oneslumafteranoth
er and employs his ingenuity to
make enough money so that
she can forget the horror of the
ghetto. It is the central Europe
an-Jewish-American ex
perience, and the filmmakers
have reduced it to nonsense.
Forman has never been a
sensitive director, and Ragtime
is an apotheosis of the most
cruel bits in his other movies.
When he took the patients in
Cuckoo's Nest from their ward
for an unauthorized outing, he
used the contrast of the world
beyond the hospital to expose
their ridiculousness, and I was
offended by his insistence on

these unfortunate men as the
butt of his joke. Similarly, he
and Weller drew the straights
in Hair as such gross, undif
ferentiated dopes that the hip
pie heroes' mean treatment of
them seemed out of propor
tion and the hippies began to
lose their appeal. In Ragtime,
almost everyone has befen re
legated to the category of the
straight world in Hair. Sarah
(Debbie Allen), the young
black woman who is taken in,
with her illegitimate child, by
the New Rochelle family men
tioned in the passage quoted
above, and whose death spurs
her lover, Coalhouse Walker
(Howard E. Rollins), to violent
action that occupies a good
third of the movie, is an open
mouthed, eye-rolling stupe —
a Topsy without spirit. Father
(James Olson) is stolid, vaguely
unpleasant, and an unprotest
ing cuckold. (In the novel,
Mother grows remote from
him but doesn't find a new
partner until after his death.)
Harry K. Thaw (Robert Joy),
who kills the architect Stanford
White (Norman Mailer) in a fit
of jealousy over his wife Evelyn
Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern),
is a spoiled adolescent.
Doctorow designed his char
acters in great part to be rich
comic resources, but he didn't
shortchange them. In the
book, baby doll Evelyn Nesbit
isn't stupid and she isn't in
sensitive; in the movie, she is a
vacant, pouty pin-up. In one
disgraceful sequence, lawyers
interrupt her idyll with her lov
er, Younger Brother (Brad
Dourif); he is fully clothed, but
she plays the entire scene
nude. It is a particularly unflat
tering view of female nudity:
the camera is trained on her
ample breasts while she
bounces around on a sofa in
dumb abandon. Elizabeth Mc-
Govern, who gave an unaf
fected performance as Timothy
Hutton's girl friend in last
year's Ordinary People, and
whose talent peeks through
this insulting caricature despite
every effort of Milos Forman to
block it, should sue.
Forman has assembled a cast
of (mostly) excellent actors but
he seems so serenely unaware
of what they can do that he
stifles almost all of them. Occa
sional bursts of life from Robert
Joy (who was the coke dealer in
Atlantic City) or Mary Steen
burgen (as mother) might be
accidental reminders of how
good they could have been.
Moses Gunn shook the screen
in The Iceman Cometh; here,
as Booker T. Washington, he
gives a dessicated, Hallmark
Hall of Fame performance.
Donald O'Connor, Pat

O'Brien, and Dorsey Wright
(Hud in Hair) pop up briefly
and have nothing to do. Only
three actors survive the wreck
age: Kenneth McMillan, Brad
Dourif, and James Cagney.
McMillan, this year's best
scene stealer (Eyewitness, True
Confessions), plays Fire Chief
Willie Conklin, whose little boy
prank on Coalhouse Walker's
car initiates much of the plot,
with infectious glee, slapping
his beer belly with the palms of
his hands as he saunters over to
inspect his handiwork. Brad
Dourif makes sense out of
Younger Brother's craziness —
he shadows Evelyn for weeks
before becoming her lover,
and later blacks his face with
cork to join Coalhouse Walk
er's rebel band — though the
reasons for some of his oddest
actions are omitted from the
script. He has given much bet
ter performances — as Billy
Bibbit in Cuckoo's Nest, as the
creepy chauffeur in Eyes of
Laura Mars, as the loony evan
gelist Hazel Motes in Wise
Blood — but those were in
much better movies. James
Cagney, in his first screen ap
pearance in two decades as Po
lice Commissioner
Rhinelander Waldo, is witty
and resilient, and makes such
immediate contact with the au
dience that several of his lines
draw applause.
Weller and Forman have cut
the heart out of Doctorow's
book. Emma Goldmann is
gone, and Harry Houdini and J.
P. Morgan and Henry Ford —
and with them the most
filmworthy of the original ma
terial. What remains are
basically two stories — the
Evelyn Nesbit part and the in
terminable black revolutionary
part, with Howard E. Rollins as
a shiny Coalhouse Walker who
is capable of neither obsession
norsufficient personal magnet
ism to gather a group of dis
ciples around him. One is nev
er too sure why both these tales
occupy the same movie. It's
possible to film just one or two
episodes from a book like East
of Eden or Hawaii, but Ragtime
is an unusual epic: without all
its parts, it ceases to mean any
thing. And in this fait, rhythm
less movie — did Forman's edi
tors resign in protest? — full of
too-carefully-clothed extras in
pitifully staged crowd scenes
trying to convince us that they
are New York slum dwellers in
the early days of century —

creations would probably lose
their way anyhow. When you
don't understand a good book,

Donald O'Connor, Pat

three actors survive the wreck

Willie Conklin, whose little boy
prank on Coalhouse Walker's
car initiates much of the plot,
with infectious glee, slapping
his beer belly with the palms of
his hands as he saunters over to
inspect his handiwork. Brad
Dourif makes sense out of
Younger Brother's craziness —
he shadows Evelyn for weeks
before becoming her lover,
and later blacks his face with
cork to join Coalhouse Walk

reasons for some of his oddest
actions are omitted from the
script. He has given much bet
ter performances — as Billy
Bibbit in Cuckoo's Nest, as the
creepy chauffeur in Eyes of
Laura Mars, as the loony evan
gelist Hazel Motes in Wise
Blood — but those were in
much better movies. James
Cagney, in his first screen ap
pearance in two decades as Po

Rhinelander Waldo, is witty
and resilient, and makes such
immediate contact with the au

draw applause.

was completed. De Laurentiis
hated Buffalo Bill, which was an
imaginative if somewhat in
flated exploration of American
mythmaking (Altman's in
terests at the time were clearly
close to Doctorow's), and
when Altman refused to re
edit it and the film died at the
box office, De Laurentiis termi
nated the contract. But Robert
Altman is the only director who
could have made a first-rate
movie out of this bizarre novel
that is already a movie. Forman,
a Czech emigre, was a terrible
choice to replace him; even his
best pictures, One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest and Hair,
hae a bulkiness that would
crush Ragtime — and does. I

thought Hair was brilliant, but
its rapid-cut virtuosity stoned
me, and I suspected that it
might be too unlikable to be
really popular (it did, in fact,
lose a lot of money); in
Ragtime, which was also shot
by Forman's countryman,
Miroslav Ondricek, but lacks
Hair's visual magic, Forman's
explicit style is like a wrecker's
ball that he levels at scene after
scene.
Ragtime displays none of
Forman's strengths, or Michael
Weller's (he scripted Hair as
well as the stage plays Moon
children and Loose Ends), but it
underscores all their weak
nesses. Doctorow's book is
deftly ironic; Forman, who
seems to be constitutionally in
capable of delicacy, turns the
irony into burlesque. Tateh
(Mandy Patinkin, who played
Che Guevara in Evita on Broad
way) throws Mameh (the tal
ented comedienne Fran
Drescher, of American Hot
Wax and The Hollywood
Knights) into the streets be
cause she has slept with anoth
er man, in a thundering se
quence that makes the
broadest vaudeville turn in Fid
dler on the Roof look like
Feydeau. Then he goes on to
make two-reelers in Atlantic
City, under the name Baron
Ashkenazy, and Forman and
Weller depict him as a nouveau
riche clodhopper who makes
sentimental speeches to his
cast and crew that noone both
ers listening to. This is un
charitable, not onlytothe actor
but also to Tateh, who in the
book drags his beloved daugh
ter out of oneslumafteranoth
er and employs his ingenuity to
make enough money so that
she can forget the horror of the
ghetto. It is the central Europe
an-Jewish-American ex
perience, and the filmmakers
have reduced it to nonsense.
Forman has never been a
sensitive director, and Ragtime
is an apotheosis of the most
cruel bits in his other movies.
When he took the patients in
Cuckoo's Nest from their ward
for an unauthorized outing, he
used the contrast of the world
beyond the hospital to expose
their ridiculousness, and I was
offended by his insistence on

these unfortunate men as the
butt of his joke. Similarly, he
and Weller drew the straights
in Hair as such gross, undif
ferentiated dopes that the hip
pie heroes' mean treatment of
them seemed out of propor
tion and the hippies began to
lose their appeal. In Ragtime,
almost everyone has befen re
legated to the category of the
straight world in Hair. Sarah
(Debbie Allen), the young
black woman who is taken in,
with her illegitimate child, by
the New Rochelle family men
tioned in the passage quoted
above, and whose death spurs
her lover, Coalhouse Walker
(Howard E. Rollins), to violent
action that occupies a good
third of the movie, is an open
mouthed, eye-rolling stupe —
a Topsy without spirit. Father
(James Olson) is stolid, vaguely
unpleasant, and an unprotest
ing cuckold. (In the novel,
Mother grows remote from
him but doesn't find a new
partner until after his death.)
Harry K. Thaw (Robert Joy),
who kills the architect Stanford
White (Norman Mailer) in a fit
of jealousy over his wife Evelyn
Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern),
is a spoiled adolescent.
Doctorow designed his char
acters in great part to be rich
comic resources, but he didn't
shortchange them. In the
book, baby doll Evelyn Nesbit
isn't stupid and she isn't in
sensitive; in the movie, she is a
vacant, pouty pin-up. In one
disgraceful sequence, lawyers
interrupt her idyll with her lov
er, Younger Brother (Brad
Dourif); he is fully clothed, but
she plays the entire scene
nude. It is a particularly unflat
tering view of female nudity:
the camera is trained on her
ample breasts while she
bounces around on a sofa in
dumb abandon. Elizabeth Mc-
Govern, who gave an unaf
fected performance as Timothy
Hutton's girl friend in last
year's Ordinary People, and
whose talent peeks through
this insulting caricature despite
every effort of Milos Forman to
block it, should sue.
Forman has assembled a cast
of (mostly) excellent actors but
he seems so serenely unaware
of what they can do that he
stifles almost all of them. Occa
sional bursts of life from Robert
Joy (who was the coke dealer in
Atlantic City) or Mary Steen
burgen (as mother) might be
accidental reminders of how
good they could have been.
Moses Gunn shook the screen

gives a dessicated, Hallmark
Hall of Fame performance.
