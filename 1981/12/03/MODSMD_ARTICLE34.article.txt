At a time when studying is of
the essence at Stanford, a few
new study aids are out on the
market.
For those who enjoy prepar
ing for finals with a little back
ground music minus the vo
cals, there are three recently
released jazz/fusion albums of
the mellower variety that
mighjt just do the trick.
The 1981 LP's by saxophonist
Grover Washington, Jr., and
guitarist John McLaughlin and
Earl Klugh aren't anything to
write home about. But if one's
record collection lacks decent,
mellow fusion, it is time to hop
in the car or on the bicycle and
pay a visit to the neighborhood
record shop.
Grover Washington, Jr.'s
latest, entitled Come Morning,
isthe mostdisappointingofthe
trio. Unless one craves a rather
boring, although attimesbeau
tiful, sax album to adulterate
his ears, let Come Morning col
lect dust on Tower Record's
shelves and not on yours.
The LP begins on an op
timistic note with an upbeat
tune called "East River Drive."
But from then on, the album
slips downhill. There are two
vocal tracks, with Grady Tate
singing lead on both "Be Mine
(Tonight)" and "Little Black
Samba." Neither song has the
potential to develop his hit,
"Just the Two of Us."
Washington seems desper
ate to make money, as his big
gest selling album (Winelight)
rode on the wave of a vocal
track ("Just the Two of Us), in
his 1981 efforts with vocals,
Washington succeeds mi
serably. He also appears to be
in need of imaginative, catchy
songs titles, always one of his
trademarks. "Be Mine (To
night)," "Making Love to
You," and "I'm All Yours" just
don't cut it.
Technically speaking,

Grover plays with the same ex
uberance and tranquility that
he always has. Behind him is an
unbelievable line-up of stars,
including Eric Gale (guitar),
Steve Gadd (drums), Richard
Tee (keyboards), and co-pro
ducer Ralph Mac Donald (per
cussion).
Nevertheless, Washington's
music is monotonous; it is
rapidly becoming a victim of
age. As he gets older, he
mellows — and so does him
music, to the point of tedium.
Like milk that sits out too long,
it begins to sour. Any of Wash
ington's albums released in the
last five years is better overall
than Come Morning.
Also aging is Earl Klugh;
however, he does not reveal as
many wrinkles or age spots on
his most recent LP, Crazy For
You, as does Washington on
Come Morning. But Klugh, like
Washington, has not moved on
to bigger and better things. He
still plays magnificent acoustic
guitar in an electric band. The
only problem with Crazy For
You is that it can be mistaken
for any of his other LPs.
The album features eight
songs, six of which closely re
semble one another. Many of
the songs rely heavily on syn
thesizers and a 60-person str
ing/harp/horn orchestra.
There are a few solos by the
other musicians appearing on
the album, including Phil Up
church, Ronnie Foster, and Ray
Parker, Jr.
Crazy For You is as good an
album as Klugh has done. The
success of this 1981 LP will de
pend largely on the popularity
of two songs: "Twinkle" and
"The Rainmaker." The former
is by far the fastest, most up
beat tune on the album. Klugh
introduces rhythmic clapping,
something almost exclusively
found in funky soul music, into
the song. "The Rainmaker"
features the quickest guitar
playing on the LP by Klugh, as
he makes his acoustic nylon
strings sound like raindrops
falling lightly from the sky.
The final song, "Crazy For
You," is not the rousing tune
one might expect to end an
album. Although it does con
tain some funky, biting bass
and some decent Klugh guitar
playing, the percussion and or
chestral arrangement renders
it borderline between a legit

imate song and a KABL "redo,"
worthy of Safeway airtime. It
leaves one with a plastictaste in
the mouth, as the title track
makes the album seem phony.
However, the record itself may
be plastic, but the songs on it
certainly aren't.
John McLaughlin is the only
artist of the three who has kept
his musical development in
constant progression. A sticker
on the album cover of his
latest, Belo Horizonte, reads as
follows:
"John McLaughlin is starting
something. Again. The man
who brought you Mahavishnu
Orchestra, the One Truth
Band, Shakti, and the epic
guitar summits with Paco de
Lucia and Al DiMeola hasagain
started something new.
Acoustic guitar in an electric
band."
Wait! Stop right there. What
about Earl Klugh and his music,
Mr. McLaughlin? Klugh has
been playing acoustic guitar in
an electric band for who knows
how many years. McLaughlin
might be starting something
new for himself, but not for the
jazz/fusion world. Sorry!
Nevertheless, Belo
Horizonte is an adequate ex
hibition of McLaughlin's ob
vious guitar playing abilities.
The LP is not much per se, but
one comes away with the no
tion that McLaughlin is per
haps the greatest, most ver
satile guitarist to ever live.
Come Morning and Crazy
For You are much easier to lis
ten to while studying because
one doesn't have to stop to
comprehend the myriad of
notes McLaughlin reels off in a
matter of seconds. He rivals Al
DiMeola when it comes to
sheer speed, and by far out
does him emotionally.
Paco de Lucia performs on
Belo Horizonte, which was rec
orded in Paris and released on
the Warner Bros, label. De
Lucia is an excellent acoustic
guitarist as well, but still has not
achieved the level of
McLaughlin.
Belo Horizonte is much
jazzier than either Klugh's or
Washington's latest LPs, both
of which contain fusion
baselines. Besides the syn
thesizers and some of the key
boards, all the instruments on
Belo Horizonte are non-elec
tric. Tommy Campbell does a

brilliant job on the drums, as
does bassist jean Paul Celea.
No one song really stands
out on the album, and accord
ingly it will not receive much
air time. Talent-wise, however,
Belo Horizonte wins a gold
medal, as McLaughlin pro
fessionally displays his celestial
ability to play an acousticguitar
with an expression of individ
uality.
Regretfully, the days of the
Mahavishnu Orchestra seem to
have at least temporarily van
ished, along with McLaughlin's
electric guitar, a tragedy. His
next album will indicte wheth
er his future will be spent with
his electric or acoustic guitar,
or both. McLaughlin currently
looks as if he will use Belo
Horizonte as a launching pad
into contemporary, straight
jazz. He has arrived at the
bridge and now must decide
whether or not to cross it.
On the other hand, Wash
ington has already approached
this bridge. But instead of
crossing it on foot, he decided
to swim. Unless Washington
rebounds from Come Morn
ing, a mini-fiasco, with a high
quality LP, he will drown.
That leaves us with Klugh. He
has yet to make this crucial de
cision, as he is still a few years
away from this bridge that,
when crossed, introduces
change into an artist's music.
He is still enjoying his peak
years in the jazz/fusion world,
something definitely reflected
in Crazy For You. In other
words, buy it.

At a time when studying is of
the essence at Stanford, a few
new study aids are out on the
market.
For those who enjoy prepar
ing for finals with a little back
ground music minus the vo
cals, there are three recently
released jazz/fusion albums of
the mellower variety that
mighjt just do the trick.
The 1981 LP's by saxophonist
Grover Washington, Jr., and
guitarist John McLaughlin and
Earl Klugh aren't anything to
write home about. But if one's
record collection lacks decent,
mellow fusion, it is time to hop
in the car or on the bicycle and
pay a visit to the neighborhood
record shop.
Grover Washington, Jr.'s
latest, entitled Come Morning,
isthe mostdisappointingofthe
trio. Unless one craves a rather
boring, although attimesbeau
tiful, sax album to adulterate
his ears, let Come Morning col
lect dust on Tower Record's
shelves and not on yours.
The LP begins on an op
timistic note with an upbeat
tune called "East River Drive."
But from then on, the album
slips downhill. There are two
vocal tracks, with Grady Tate
singing lead on both "Be Mine
(Tonight)" and "Little Black
Samba." Neither song has the
potential to develop his hit,
"Just the Two of Us."
Washington seems desper
ate to make money, as his big
gest selling album (Winelight)
rode on the wave of a vocal
track ("Just the Two of Us), in
his 1981 efforts with vocals,
Washington succeeds mi
serably. He also appears to be
in need of imaginative, catchy
songs titles, always one of his
trademarks. "Be Mine (To
night)," "Making Love to
You," and "I'm All Yours" just
don't cut it.
Technically speaking,

Grover plays with the same ex
uberance and tranquility that
he always has. Behind him is an
unbelievable line-up of stars,
including Eric Gale (guitar),
Steve Gadd (drums), Richard
Tee (keyboards), and co-pro
ducer Ralph Mac Donald (per
cussion).
Nevertheless, Washington's
music is monotonous; it is
rapidly becoming a victim of
age. As he gets older, he
mellows — and so does him
music, to the point of tedium.
Like milk that sits out too long,
it begins to sour. Any of Wash
ington's albums released in the
last five years is better overall
than Come Morning.
Also aging is Earl Klugh;
however, he does not reveal as
many wrinkles or age spots on
his most recent LP, Crazy For
You, as does Washington on
Come Morning. But Klugh, like
Washington, has not moved on
to bigger and better things. He
still plays magnificent acoustic
guitar in an electric band. The
only problem with Crazy For
You is that it can be mistaken
for any of his other LPs.
The album features eight
songs, six of which closely re
semble one another. Many of
the songs rely heavily on syn
thesizers and a 60-person str
ing/harp/horn orchestra.
There are a few solos by the
other musicians appearing on
the album, including Phil Up
church, Ronnie Foster, and Ray
Parker, Jr.
Crazy For You is as good an
album as Klugh has done. The
success of this 1981 LP will de
pend largely on the popularity
of two songs: "Twinkle" and
"The Rainmaker." The former
is by far the fastest, most up
beat tune on the album. Klugh
introduces rhythmic clapping,
something almost exclusively
found in funky soul music, into
the song. "The Rainmaker"
features the quickest guitar
playing on the LP by Klugh, as
he makes his acoustic nylon
strings sound like raindrops
falling lightly from the sky.
The final song, "Crazy For
You," is not the rousing tune
one might expect to end an
album. Although it does con
tain some funky, biting bass
and some decent Klugh guitar
playing, the percussion and or
chestral arrangement renders
it borderline between a legit

imate song and a KABL "redo,"
worthy of Safeway airtime. It
leaves one with a plastictaste in
the mouth, as the title track
makes the album seem phony.
However, the record itself may
be plastic, but the songs on it
certainly aren't.
John McLaughlin is the only
artist of the three who has kept
his musical development in
constant progression. A sticker
on the album cover of his
latest, Belo Horizonte, reads as
follows:
"John McLaughlin is starting
something. Again. The man
who brought you Mahavishnu
Orchestra, the One Truth
Band, Shakti, and the epic
guitar summits with Paco de
Lucia and Al DiMeola hasagain
started something new.
Acoustic guitar in an electric
band."
Wait! Stop right there. What
about Earl Klugh and his music,
Mr. McLaughlin? Klugh has
been playing acoustic guitar in
an electric band for who knows
how many years. McLaughlin
might be starting something
new for himself, but not for the
jazz/fusion world. Sorry!
Nevertheless, Belo
Horizonte is an adequate ex
hibition of McLaughlin's ob
vious guitar playing abilities.
The LP is not much per se, but
one comes away with the no
tion that McLaughlin is per
haps the greatest, most ver
satile guitarist to ever live.
Come Morning and Crazy
For You are much easier to lis
ten to while studying because
one doesn't have to stop to
comprehend the myriad of
notes McLaughlin reels off in a
matter of seconds. He rivals Al
DiMeola when it comes to
sheer speed, and by far out
does him emotionally.
Paco de Lucia performs on
Belo Horizonte, which was rec
orded in Paris and released on
the Warner Bros, label. De
Lucia is an excellent acoustic
guitarist as well, but still has not
achieved the level of
McLaughlin.
Belo Horizonte is much
jazzier than either Klugh's or
Washington's latest LPs, both
of which contain fusion
baselines. Besides the syn
thesizers and some of the key
boards, all the instruments on
Belo Horizonte are non-elec
tric. Tommy Campbell does a

brilliant job on the drums, as
does bassist jean Paul Celea.
No one song really stands
out on the album, and accord
ingly it will not receive much
air time. Talent-wise, however,
Belo Horizonte wins a gold
medal, as McLaughlin pro
fessionally displays his celestial
ability to play an acousticguitar
with an expression of individ
uality.
Regretfully, the days of the
Mahavishnu Orchestra seem to
have at least temporarily van
ished, along with McLaughlin's
electric guitar, a tragedy. His
next album will indicte wheth
er his future will be spent with
his electric or acoustic guitar,
or both. McLaughlin currently
looks as if he will use Belo
Horizonte as a launching pad
into contemporary, straight
jazz. He has arrived at the
bridge and now must decide
whether or not to cross it.
On the other hand, Wash
ington has already approached
this bridge. But instead of
crossing it on foot, he decided
to swim. Unless Washington
rebounds from Come Morn
ing, a mini-fiasco, with a high
quality LP, he will drown.
That leaves us with Klugh. He
has yet to make this crucial de
cision, as he is still a few years
away from this bridge that,
when crossed, introduces
change into an artist's music.
He is still enjoying his peak

looks as if he will use Belo
Horizonte as a launching pad
into contemporary, straight
jazz. He has arrived at the
bridge and now must decide
whether or not to cross it.
On the other hand, Wash
ington has already approached
this bridge. But instead of
crossing it on foot, he decided
to swim. Unless Washington
rebounds from Come Morn
ing, a mini-fiasco, with a high
quality LP, he will drown.
That leaves us with Klugh. He
has yet to make this crucial de
cision, as he is still a few years
away from this bridge that,
when crossed, introduces
change into an artist's music.
He is still enjoying his peak
years in the jazz/fusion world,
something definitely reflected
in Crazy For You. In other
words, buy it.

At a time when studying is of
the essence at Stanford, a few
new study aids are out on the
market.
For those who enjoy prepar
ing for finals with a little back
ground music minus the vo
cals, there are three recently
released jazz/fusion albums of
the mellower variety that
mighjt just do the trick.
The 1981 LP's by saxophonist
Grover Washington, Jr., and
guitarist John McLaughlin and
Earl Klugh aren't anything to
write home about. But if one's
record collection lacks decent,
mellow fusion, it is time to hop
in the car or on the bicycle and
pay a visit to the neighborhood
record shop.
Grover Washington, Jr.'s
latest, entitled Come Morning,
isthe mostdisappointingofthe
trio. Unless one craves a rather
boring, although attimesbeau
tiful, sax album to adulterate
his ears, let Come Morning col
lect dust on Tower Record's
shelves and not on yours.
The LP begins on an op
timistic note with an upbeat
tune called "East River Drive."
But from then on, the album
slips downhill. There are two
vocal tracks, with Grady Tate
singing lead on both "Be Mine
(Tonight)" and "Little Black
Samba." Neither song has the
potential to develop his hit,
"Just the Two of Us."
Washington seems desper
ate to make money, as his big
gest selling album (Winelight)
rode on the wave of a vocal
track ("Just the Two of Us), in
his 1981 efforts with vocals,
Washington succeeds mi
serably. He also appears to be
in need of imaginative, catchy
songs titles, always one of his
trademarks. "Be Mine (To
night)," "Making Love to
You," and "I'm All Yours" just
don't cut it.
Technically speaking,

Grover plays with the same ex
uberance and tranquility that
he always has. Behind him is an
unbelievable line-up of stars,
including Eric Gale (guitar),
Steve Gadd (drums), Richard
Tee (keyboards), and co-pro
ducer Ralph Mac Donald (per
cussion).
Nevertheless, Washington's
music is monotonous; it is
rapidly becoming a victim of
age. As he gets older, he
mellows — and so does him
music, to the point of tedium.
Like milk that sits out too long,
it begins to sour. Any of Wash
ington's albums released in the
last five years is better overall
than Come Morning.
Also aging is Earl Klugh;
however, he does not reveal as
many wrinkles or age spots on
his most recent LP, Crazy For
You, as does Washington on
Come Morning. But Klugh, like
Washington, has not moved on
to bigger and better things. He
still plays magnificent acoustic
guitar in an electric band. The
only problem with Crazy For
You is that it can be mistaken
for any of his other LPs.
The album features eight
songs, six of which closely re
semble one another. Many of
the songs rely heavily on syn
thesizers and a 60-person str
ing/harp/horn orchestra.
There are a few solos by the
other musicians appearing on
the album, including Phil Up
church, Ronnie Foster, and Ray
Parker, Jr.
Crazy For You is as good an
album as Klugh has done. The
success of this 1981 LP will de
pend largely on the popularity
of two songs: "Twinkle" and
"The Rainmaker." The former
is by far the fastest, most up
beat tune on the album. Klugh
introduces rhythmic clapping,
something almost exclusively
found in funky soul music, into
the song. "The Rainmaker"
features the quickest guitar
playing on the LP by Klugh, as
he makes his acoustic nylon
strings sound like raindrops
falling lightly from the sky.
The final song, "Crazy For
You," is not the rousing tune
one might expect to end an
album. Although it does con
tain some funky, biting bass
and some decent Klugh guitar
playing, the percussion and or
chestral arrangement renders
it borderline between a legit

imate song and a KABL "redo,"
worthy of Safeway airtime. It
leaves one with a plastictaste in
the mouth, as the title track
makes the album seem phony.
However, the record itself may
be plastic, but the songs on it
certainly aren't.
John McLaughlin is the only
artist of the three who has kept
his musical development in
constant progression. A sticker
on the album cover of his
latest, Belo Horizonte, reads as
follows:
"John McLaughlin is starting
something. Again. The man
who brought you Mahavishnu
Orchestra, the One Truth
Band, Shakti, and the epic
guitar summits with Paco de
Lucia and Al DiMeola hasagain
started something new.
Acoustic guitar in an electric
band."
Wait! Stop right there. What
about Earl Klugh and his music,
Mr. McLaughlin? Klugh has
been playing acoustic guitar in
an electric band for who knows
how many years. McLaughlin
might be starting something
new for himself, but not for the
jazz/fusion world. Sorry!
Nevertheless, Belo
Horizonte is an adequate ex
hibition of McLaughlin's ob
vious guitar playing abilities.
The LP is not much per se, but
one comes away with the no
tion that McLaughlin is per
haps the greatest, most ver
satile guitarist to ever live.
Come Morning and Crazy
For You are much easier to lis
ten to while studying because
one doesn't have to stop to
comprehend the myriad of
notes McLaughlin reels off in a
matter of seconds. He rivals Al
DiMeola when it comes to
sheer speed, and by far out
does him emotionally.
Paco de Lucia performs on
Belo Horizonte, which was rec
orded in Paris and released on
the Warner Bros, label. De
Lucia is an excellent acoustic
guitarist as well, but still has not
achieved the level of
McLaughlin.
Belo Horizonte is much
jazzier than either Klugh's or
Washington's latest LPs, both
of which contain fusion
baselines. Besides the syn
thesizers and some of the key
boards, all the instruments on
Belo Horizonte are non-elec
tric. Tommy Campbell does a

brilliant job on the drums, as
does bassist jean Paul Celea.
No one song really stands
out on the album, and accord
ingly it will not receive much
air time. Talent-wise, however,
Belo Horizonte wins a gold
medal, as McLaughlin pro
fessionally displays his celestial
ability to play an acousticguitar
with an expression of individ
uality.
Regretfully, the days of the
Mahavishnu Orchestra seem to
have at least temporarily van
ished, along with McLaughlin's
electric guitar, a tragedy. His
next album will indicte wheth
er his future will be spent with
his electric or acoustic guitar,
or both. McLaughlin currently
looks as if he will use Belo
Horizonte as a launching pad
into contemporary, straight
jazz. He has arrived at the
bridge and now must decide
whether or not to cross it.
On the other hand, Wash
ington has already approached
this bridge. But instead of
crossing it on foot, he decided
to swim. Unless Washington
rebounds from Come Morn
ing, a mini-fiasco, with a high
quality LP, he will drown.
That leaves us with Klugh. He
has yet to make this crucial de
cision, as he is still a few years
away from this bridge that,
when crossed, introduces
change into an artist's music.
He is still enjoying his peak
years in the jazz/fusion world,
something definitely reflected
in Crazy For You. In other
words, buy it.
