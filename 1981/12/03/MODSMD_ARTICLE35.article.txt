# Iggy's older, but he's still what rock is about

### Tony Kelly 
Iggy Pop
The Old Waldorf/San Francisco
25 November 1981
OK, so he isn't quite "the world's for
gotten boy" anymore. The neo-shiteating
grin from Lust for Life is now missing a front
tooth, the hair is just a little too black, and he
doesn't make a mess of his chest anymore.
Thank God for small favors.
But just as in those Thrilling Days of Yester
year, when Iggy and the Stooges churned
through the best, most raw-powerful, most
obnoxious heavy metal to ever deserve the
name (and by the way, don't ask me too
much about those days — my little brother
would've had to drop someacid into my Rice
Krispies for me to get into some Stooges min
imalism c. 1970), Iggy Pop, nee Iggy Stooge,
nee James Osterberg, finds himself battling
with his reputation everywhere he goes
these days.
Reputation. Roll that one over on your
tongue a bit. Re-pew-tay-shun. Sounds sin
ister, doesn't it? Well, so does any word if
you say it so slowly that it had better mean
something. Still, the task of fighting a shad
owy public image of oneself — especially
the, uh, distinctive persona of an Iggy Pop —
can't be an easy one. Every time the present
day model Ig runs onstage, there are shouts
for "I Wanna Be Your Dog" and lurid imagin
ings of a gold-lame-gloved hand reaching
into faded jeans for a favorite hunk of Oscar
Meyer.
But Iggy Pop doesn't do that anymore, and
I don't blame him. After all, that same burn
the-candle-at-both-ends lifestyle, while en
tertaining to a public desperately in need of
catharsis, led Iggy to a nervous breakdown in
1973. It may be fun to read about the Stooges
getting a CBS bankroll to buy new instru
ments and spending the whole wad on
drugs, but the fallout from that has to hit
sometime, both physically and mentally. In
deed, it's only by the grace of David Bowie
that Iggy ever dug himself out and came

back under the Thin White Duke's wing in
1977 with two Bowie-produced albums, The
Idiot and Lust for Life. It's inconceivable to
see anyone want to return to a life that very
nearly drove them crazy, and so the Pop of
today, while still active, is clearly not the
Dada Lama of the salad days of heavy metal.
But since then, the Ig has had other de
mons to exorcise, foremost among them the
spectre of Father Time. The drama of the ag
ing rock icon has long been bandied about
in these parts ever since word of Bill Haley's
receding hairline leaked out. Let the first
whiff of Geritol hit the collective snoot of an
audience and it's see you later, alligator.
Writers complain about Elvis Costello's "in
creasingly evident age" and write off the
Clash as a bygone band. Hell, Elvis Costello is
23 years old. The Clash have only been
around since 1977; compare that to singing
"My Generation" for 20 years, and you're
talking about a real fickle public these days.
And let's admit it: in a world so dependent
on youth, Iggy Pop has been acting pretty
old-fartish recently. There's a big difference
between being rightfully recognized as the
"godfather of punk" and acting like it. And I
get damn cranky when I see Iggy Pop actual
ly talk about his "minimalist songwriting"
and chat with Tom Snyder (TOM SNYDER??)
about the "Apollonian and Dionysian ele
ments of his craft". It's a hypocritical view, I
suppose, to write a think-piece about an ar
tist and then get bummed about that artist
doing the same thing. But Iggy's been telling
everyone around how highly he thinks of
Ronald Reagan, forchrissake. That last bit es
pecially merited investigation, and so when
the Ig stopped by last week to play some
hardball club rock at the Old Waldorf, I felt it
was worth dealing with the crowd to see
what's really going down in Iggytown these
days.
And when I say crowd, I mean crowd. The
Waldorf stationed two masses of security
guards onstage to protect the equipment,
which is very nice for delicate amps and mike
stands but not as good for the jostling au
dience immediately adjacent. I found myself

on, over and around various objects on the
dance floor (I didn't want to know what they
were) in order to keep a clear view of Herr
Pop himself. After all, the best thing about
the Waldorf for me is that the stage is about
six inches off the floor. This doesn't augur
much for the sound of the place, which is tin
nier than that guy with the oil can in The
Wizard of Oz. But for pure contact, up close
and personal with the folks onstage, the
drawback becomes an advantage.
Oh look, here comes Iggy now — in a shirt
left over from your kid sister's Brownie uni
form and a black leather. . . skirt. A real short
one too. So short, in fact, that for most of the
show it appears that we might witness a time
warp and return to the old Iggy Stooge, div
ing into his black briefs. I told you the
Waldorf was intimate.
But the biggest surprise of this latest in
carnation of Iggy Pop is the lack of theatri
cality. The Waldorf has a small stage, but the
ig preferred to stay within even smaller con
fines, only occasionally highkicking or flail
ing his mike stand around. Score one for
public safety.
This limitation, though, made Pop more
commanding, as he reeled through an hour
and-a-half set composed mainly of past ma
terial, sprinkled liberally with tracks from his
latest (excellent) LP, Party. From the opening
"Some Weird Sin" (off Lust For Life, for my
money one of the best records ever made)
through the final encore of a new song,
"Winter of My Discontent", Iggy snarled
through a rapidfire assortment of neglected
tracks from his past and present, sounding
almost like a K-Tel promotion for "The Life
and Times of Iggy Pop".
At this point (or more precisely, during the
first chorus of "I'm a Conservative" from
1980's Soldier album) I realized that the old
Stooge of the past is still firmly rooted in the
Pop of today. Sure, the sound is more com
mercial — in fact, if it weren't for the clothes,
I sure as heck wouldn't call this new wave —
and Iggy himself doesn't get as rude any
more, but the persona is consistent. And the
old stuff is still around, if you want it; the

boys even played "1969" and "TV Fye" off
the very first Stooges album. I still believed it,
too — even when Iggy sang "Now I'm gonna
be 22" in the former and punctuated the lat
ter when a thunderous "Big — fucking —
deal!!" What's more, if "Winter of My Dis
content" is any clue, the Ig's writing powers

Iggy runs onstage, there are

are better than ever. As New West magazine
(far from my favorite rag, and not thp best
source for hot musical tips) put it a while
back, "What do you know. He really is the
Jim Morrison for our times".
Whether he is or not doesn't matter to me.
What does is that Iggy Pop still alive and
kicking, though in a revised, morp mature
form. Most folks seem to find their rock, and
roll archetypes in the Bruce Springsteen
mold; a clean, nice, good looking guy who
gets up on a stage to let his guard down and
tell you what he really feels, way down deep,
in his ever-lovin' heart. That may be the way
life is, but it isn't what rock's about, ( or me,
Iggy Pop — or rather, Jimmy Osterberg's
portrayal of Iggy Pop — fills that role. And if
Iggy ever lets his guard down for a bit and
throws out the image that he's been simulta
neously battling and building, well, I don't
know what will happen. But I'll be listening,
and listening real closely.
