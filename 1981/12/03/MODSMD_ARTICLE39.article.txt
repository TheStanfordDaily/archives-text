Reagan hints air controller review
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, lamenting that
he has become "estranged from labor," asked AFL-CIO
leaders for a fresh start yesterday and promised, for his part,
that he will review the mass firings of air traffic controllers.
While the president was not specific on the issue, he did
not rule out the possibility that the 11,500 controllers who
were fired after an illegal strike Aug. 3 might be allowed back
in the airport towers.
Deputy press secretary Larry Speakes quoted Reagan as
telling the AFL-CIO leadership in an hour-long meeting that
"I never anticipated I would be estranged from labor with all
the years I put in as a union member.
"This would be a good point for us to consider starting
over. We need consultations to get this country moving
again," Reagan was quoted as saying.
A day earlier, Reagan told leaders of the Teamster union
he was considering whether to lift a three-year ban on any
federal employment for the fired controllers. Yesterday, ac
cording to the AFL-CIO contingent, he went a step further
and said he "will review" the entire issue, including, presum
ably, whether to reinstate the controllers.
Speakes sought at a midday briefing, however, to min
imize the possibility the controllers will be returned to their
old jobs.
"That has not been discussed. We haven't reached that
point," he said. "There are no plans now to put them (the
controllers) back in the towers."
Speakes agreed that Reagan did not rule that out, though
the question "did not come up specifically."
Senate gives Casey shaky endorsement
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Committee
handed William Casey a tepid endorsement yesterday to stay
on as CIA director, but declared he had displayed "an insuf
ficient appreciation" of his obligation to be open and
truthful with Congress.
In a statement notable for its negative phrasing, the com
mittee said its four-month investigation into the intelligence
chief's past business dealings found "no basis... for conclud
ing that Mr. Casey is unfit" to stay in office.
At the same time, the panel criticized Casey for being "at
minimum inattentive to detail" and said his financial dis
closures to Congress "were deficient in several respects."
Only one senator, Democrat Joseph Biden of Delaware,
dissented from the report. Biden flatly declared he had no
confidence in Casey.
The committee left unanswered recent questions about
Casey's decision to break the precedent of his two predeces
sors at CIA and keep control of his extensive stock portfolio
that includes holdings in firms with major foreign opera
tions.
In a prepared statement, Casey added, "I look forward to
continuing to work together with the committee to improve
the nation's intelligence capabilities."
High Court rules on union question
Washington — In a decision affecting thousands of secre
taries and other white-collar workers, the Supreme Court

ruled 5 to 4 yesterday that employees with access to con
fidential information are generally entitled to join unions
and to be protected by federal labor laws.
Only when employees have direct access to confidential
labor information, such as the company's collective-bargain
ing strategies, may they be barred from union activities, the
court said.
The justices overturned a 1980 lower court decision that
had excluded all employees with access to confidential in
formation from protection of the labor laws. Instead, the
high court upheld the National Labor Relations Board, which
has for years let secretaries and similar employees join
unions unless they work directly on labor matters for their
bosses.
White House adds new test for Allen
Washington — The White House said yesterday that Rich
ard Allen must pass a new test before returning as the presi
dent's national security adviser: a review by the presidential
counsel's office to see if White House "regulations" were vi
olated, regardless of whether Allen is fully exonerated by the
Justice Department.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said this
review will not begin until after the Justice Department com
pletes its investigation of unanswered questions in the Allen
case.
Justice declared Tuesday that Allen violated no laws in re
ceiving from Japanese journalists $1000 intended as an hon
orarium for their interview with Nancy Reagan. But the de
partment still is investigating Allen's acceptance of two
watches, given him by either a Japanese friend or Japanese
journalists who interviewed Mrs. Reagan, and errors in his
financial disclosure statement.
Speakes' statement was the most complete White House
declaration of hurdles Allen must clear to return to his job.
For a time yesterday, the matter seemed far from clear as
presidential advisers compounded confusion by issuing con
flicting comments about the affair.
Presidential counselor Edwin Meese, Allen's strongest de
fender within President Ronald Reagan's hierarchy, was
asked while walking into a Washington hotel if he expects
Allen to return if fully cleared by the Justice Department.
Solidarity goes on nationwide alert
Warsaw — Solidarity ordered a nationwide alert and called
its leaders into emergency session yesterday after Polish
commandos stormed a firefighters' school, routed protest
ing cadets and arrested nine unionists.
Solidarity chief Lech Walesa ordered local chapters to
await word from national leaders before declaring a strike,
and cautioned them to be on the guard for other police ac
tions.
Solidarity's Warsaw chapter considered a general strike
call for its 900,000-member region, but said it would await the
release of Seweryn Jaworski, one of the unionists seized at
the school.
No casualties resulted in the 90-minute raid begun when
the commandos jumped onto the roof of the five-story
building from a huge helicopter, and burst through street

level doors at 10 a.m.
"It was non-violent and we offered no resistance to give
them an excuse," said one of the 320 cadets ousted after a
week-long occupation. "They didn't beat us, they just
pushed a bit."
Witnesses said about 500 commandos, backed by 4000 to
5000 police and army troops, were on hand during the opera
tion.
The cadets, who had sought civilian status so they could be
covered by a new law on academic reforms, were told to go
home. But many defied the order, and flocked to Solidarity
union offices.
Begin defeats no-confidence vote
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's ruling
coalition yesterday turned back a parliamentary motion of
no confidence in his government by critics of Israel's new
"strategic cooperation" agreement with the United States.
Although his broken thigh prevented him appearing in
the Knesset, Begin was able to hold together his shaky four
faction Likud coalition defeating the motion 57 to 53.
If the Likuc bloc had lost the no confidence vote, Begin's
government would have been obliged to resign, and new
elections probably would have been scheduled early next
year.
In a somewhat raucous, six-hour debate on the motion,
many of the 120 members of the Knesset exercised their right
to have a say about the controversial memorandum of un
derstanding signed in Washington on Monday night by Is
raeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. Defense Secre
tary Caspar W. Weinberger.
Spokesmen for the opposition Labor Party, which pressed
the no-confidence motion, contended that the agreement
adds nothing to Israel's security and could entangle the na
tion in superpower conflicts far beyond its borders.
Market quickly loses Tuesday gains
New York — A late bout of selling pushed the stock market
into a broad decline yesterday.
Prices skidded from the opening bell, firmed a bit midday
but then slipped further in the final hour. Steel, retail, elec
tronic and forest products stocks fell while precious metals
and aircraft issues provided some of the few bright spots.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which topped 890
Tuesday — its best level in three months — fell nearly 5
points in the first two hours of trading, cut its loss in half, then
turned lower in late trading to end the day at 882.61, off 7.61.
Today's weather
Fair thru Friday with patchy night and morning fog or low
clouds. Lows in the 40s to low 50s, with highs in the mid 50s to
low 60s.

Reagan hints air controller review
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, lamenting that
he has become "estranged from labor," asked AFL-CIO
leaders for a fresh start yesterday and promised, for his part,
that he will review the mass firings of air traffic controllers.
While the president was not specific on the issue, he did
not rule out the possibility that the 11,500 controllers who
were fired after an illegal strike Aug. 3 might be allowed back
in the airport towers.
Deputy press secretary Larry Speakes quoted Reagan as
telling the AFL-CIO leadership in an hour-long meeting that
"I never anticipated I would be estranged from labor with all
the years I put in as a union member.
"This would be a good point for us to consider starting
over. We need consultations to get this country moving
again," Reagan was quoted as saying.
A day earlier, Reagan told leaders of the Teamster union
he was considering whether to lift a three-year ban on any
federal employment for the fired controllers. Yesterday, ac
cording to the AFL-CIO contingent, he went a step further
and said he "will review" the entire issue, including, presum
ably, whether to reinstate the controllers.
Speakes sought at a midday briefing, however, to min
imize the possibility the controllers will be returned to their
old jobs.
"That has not been discussed. We haven't reached that
point," he said. "There are no plans now to put them (the
controllers) back in the towers."
Speakes agreed that Reagan did not rule that out, though
the question "did not come up specifically."
Senate gives Casey shaky endorsement
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Committee
handed William Casey a tepid endorsement yesterday to stay
on as CIA director, but declared he had displayed "an insuf
ficient appreciation" of his obligation to be open and
truthful with Congress.
In a statement notable for its negative phrasing, the com
mittee said its four-month investigation into the intelligence
chief's past business dealings found "no basis... for conclud
ing that Mr. Casey is unfit" to stay in office.
At the same time, the panel criticized Casey for being "at
minimum inattentive to detail" and said his financial dis
closures to Congress "were deficient in several respects."
Only one senator, Democrat Joseph Biden of Delaware,
dissented from the report. Biden flatly declared he had no
confidence in Casey.
The committee left unanswered recent questions about
Casey's decision to break the precedent of his two predeces
sors at CIA and keep control of his extensive stock portfolio
that includes holdings in firms with major foreign opera
tions.
In a prepared statement, Casey added, "I look forward to
continuing to work together with the committee to improve
the nation's intelligence capabilities."
High Court rules on union question
Washington — In a decision affecting thousands of secre
taries and other white-collar workers, the Supreme Court

ruled 5 to 4 yesterday that employees with access to con
fidential information are generally entitled to join unions
and to be protected by federal labor laws.
Only when employees have direct access to confidential
labor information, such as the company's collective-bargain
ing strategies, may they be barred from union activities, the
court said.
The justices overturned a 1980 lower court decision that
had excluded all employees with access to confidential in
formation from protection of the labor laws. Instead, the
high court upheld the National Labor Relations Board, which
has for years let secretaries and similar employees join
unions unless they work directly on labor matters for their
bosses.
White House adds new test for Allen
Washington — The White House said yesterday that Rich
ard Allen must pass a new test before returning as the presi
dent's national security adviser: a review by the presidential
counsel's office to see if White House "regulations" were vi
olated, regardless of whether Allen is fully exonerated by the
Justice Department.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said this
review will not begin until after the Justice Department com
pletes its investigation of unanswered questions in the Allen
case.
Justice declared Tuesday that Allen violated no laws in re
ceiving from Japanese journalists $1000 intended as an hon
orarium for their interview with Nancy Reagan. But the de
partment still is investigating Allen's acceptance of two
watches, given him by either a Japanese friend or Japanese
journalists who interviewed Mrs. Reagan, and errors in his
financial disclosure statement.
Speakes' statement was the most complete White House
declaration of hurdles Allen must clear to return to his job.
For a time yesterday, the matter seemed far from clear as
presidential advisers compounded confusion by issuing con
flicting comments about the affair.
Presidential counselor Edwin Meese, Allen's strongest de
fender within President Ronald Reagan's hierarchy, was
asked while walking into a Washington hotel if he expects
Allen to return if fully cleared by the Justice Department.
Solidarity goes on nationwide alert
Warsaw — Solidarity ordered a nationwide alert and called
its leaders into emergency session yesterday after Polish
commandos stormed a firefighters' school, routed protest
ing cadets and arrested nine unionists.
Solidarity chief Lech Walesa ordered local chapters to
await word from national leaders before declaring a strike,
and cautioned them to be on the guard for other police ac
tions.
Solidarity's Warsaw chapter considered a general strike
call for its 900,000-member region, but said it would await the
release of Seweryn Jaworski, one of the unionists seized at
the school.
No casualties resulted in the 90-minute raid begun when
the commandos jumped onto the roof of the five-story
building from a huge helicopter, and burst through street

level doors at 10 a.m.
"It was non-violent and we offered no resistance to give
them an excuse," said one of the 320 cadets ousted after a
week-long occupation. "They didn't beat us, they just
pushed a bit."
Witnesses said about 500 commandos, backed by 4000 to
5000 police and army troops, were on hand during the opera
tion.
The cadets, who had sought civilian status so they could be
covered by a new law on academic reforms, were told to go
home. But many defied the order, and flocked to Solidarity
union offices.
Begin defeats no-confidence vote
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's ruling
coalition yesterday turned back a parliamentary motion of
no confidence in his government by critics of Israel's new
"strategic cooperation" agreement with the United States.
Although his broken thigh prevented him appearing in
the Knesset, Begin was able to hold together his shaky four
faction Likud coalition defeating the motion 57 to 53.
If the Likuc bloc had lost the no confidence vote, Begin's
government would have been obliged to resign, and new
elections probably would have been scheduled early next
year.
In a somewhat raucous, six-hour debate on the motion,
many of the 120 members of the Knesset exercised their right
to have a say about the controversial memorandum of un
derstanding signed in Washington on Monday night by Is
raeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. Defense Secre
tary Caspar W. Weinberger.
Spokesmen for the opposition Labor Party, which pressed
the no-confidence motion, contended that the agreement
adds nothing to Israel's security and could entangle the na
tion in superpower conflicts far beyond its borders.
Market quickly loses Tuesday gains
New York — A late bout of selling pushed the stock market
into a broad decline yesterday.
Prices skidded from the opening bell, firmed a bit midday
but then slipped further in the final hour. Steel, retail, elec
tronic and forest products stocks fell while precious metals
and aircraft issues provided some of the few bright spots.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which topped 890
Tuesday — its best level in three months — fell nearly 5
points in the first two hours of trading, cut its loss in half, then
turned lower in late trading to end the day at 882.61, off 7.61.

Reagan hints air controller review
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, lamenting that
he has become "estranged from labor," asked AFL-CIO
leaders for a fresh start yesterday and promised, for his part,
that he will review the mass firings of air traffic controllers.
While the president was not specific on the issue, he did
not rule out the possibility that the 11,500 controllers who
were fired after an illegal strike Aug. 3 might be allowed back
in the airport towers.
Deputy press secretary Larry Speakes quoted Reagan as
telling the AFL-CIO leadership in an hour-long meeting that
"I never anticipated I would be estranged from labor with all
the years I put in as a union member.
"This would be a good point for us to consider starting
over. We need consultations to get this country moving
again," Reagan was quoted as saying.
A day earlier, Reagan told leaders of the Teamster union
he was considering whether to lift a three-year ban on any
federal employment for the fired controllers. Yesterday, ac
cording to the AFL-CIO contingent, he went a step further
and said he "will review" the entire issue, including, presum
ably, whether to reinstate the controllers.
Speakes sought at a midday briefing, however, to min
imize the possibility the controllers will be returned to their
old jobs.
"That has not been discussed. We haven't reached that
point," he said. "There are no plans now to put them (the
controllers) back in the towers."
Speakes agreed that Reagan did not rule that out, though
the question "did not come up specifically."
Senate gives Casey shaky endorsement
Washington — The Senate Intelligence Committee
handed William Casey a tepid endorsement yesterday to stay
on as CIA director, but declared he had displayed "an insuf
ficient appreciation" of his obligation to be open and
truthful with Congress.
In a statement notable for its negative phrasing, the com
mittee said its four-month investigation into the intelligence
chief's past business dealings found "no basis... for conclud
ing that Mr. Casey is unfit" to stay in office.
At the same time, the panel criticized Casey for being "at
minimum inattentive to detail" and said his financial dis
closures to Congress "were deficient in several respects."
Only one senator, Democrat Joseph Biden of Delaware,
dissented from the report. Biden flatly declared he had no
confidence in Casey.
The committee left unanswered recent questions about
Casey's decision to break the precedent of his two predeces
sors at CIA and keep control of his extensive stock portfolio
that includes holdings in firms with major foreign opera
tions.
In a prepared statement, Casey added, "I look forward to
continuing to work together with the committee to improve
the nation's intelligence capabilities."
High Court rules on union question
Washington — In a decision affecting thousands of secre
taries and other white-collar workers, the Supreme Court

ruled 5 to 4 yesterday that employees with access to con
fidential information are generally entitled to join unions
and to be protected by federal labor laws.
Only when employees have direct access to confidential
labor information, such as the company's collective-bargain
ing strategies, may they be barred from union activities, the
court said.
The justices overturned a 1980 lower court decision that
had excluded all employees with access to confidential in
formation from protection of the labor laws. Instead, the
high court upheld the National Labor Relations Board, which
has for years let secretaries and similar employees join
unions unless they work directly on labor matters for their
bosses.
White House adds new test for Allen
Washington — The White House said yesterday that Rich
ard Allen must pass a new test before returning as the presi
dent's national security adviser: a review by the presidential
counsel's office to see if White House "regulations" were vi
olated, regardless of whether Allen is fully exonerated by the
Justice Department.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said this
review will not begin until after the Justice Department com
pletes its investigation of unanswered questions in the Allen
case.
Justice declared Tuesday that Allen violated no laws in re
ceiving from Japanese journalists $1000 intended as an hon
orarium for their interview with Nancy Reagan. But the de
partment still is investigating Allen's acceptance of two
watches, given him by either a Japanese friend or Japanese
journalists who interviewed Mrs. Reagan, and errors in his
financial disclosure statement.
Speakes' statement was the most complete White House
declaration of hurdles Allen must clear to return to his job.
For a time yesterday, the matter seemed far from clear as
presidential advisers compounded confusion by issuing con
flicting comments about the affair.
Presidential counselor Edwin Meese, Allen's strongest de
fender within President Ronald Reagan's hierarchy, was
asked while walking into a Washington hotel if he expects
Allen to return if fully cleared by the Justice Department.
Solidarity goes on nationwide alert
Warsaw — Solidarity ordered a nationwide alert and called
its leaders into emergency session yesterday after Polish
commandos stormed a firefighters' school, routed protest
ing cadets and arrested nine unionists.
Solidarity chief Lech Walesa ordered local chapters to
await word from national leaders before declaring a strike,
and cautioned them to be on the guard for other police ac
tions.
Solidarity's Warsaw chapter considered a general strike
call for its 900,000-member region, but said it would await the
release of Seweryn Jaworski, one of the unionists seized at
the school.
No casualties resulted in the 90-minute raid begun when
the commandos jumped onto the roof of the five-story
building from a huge helicopter, and burst through street

level doors at 10 a.m.
"It was non-violent and we offered no resistance to give
them an excuse," said one of the 320 cadets ousted after a
week-long occupation. "They didn't beat us, they just
pushed a bit."
Witnesses said about 500 commandos, backed by 4000 to
5000 police and army troops, were on hand during the opera
tion.
The cadets, who had sought civilian status so they could be
covered by a new law on academic reforms, were told to go
home. But many defied the order, and flocked to Solidarity
union offices.
Begin defeats no-confidence vote
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin's ruling
coalition yesterday turned back a parliamentary motion of
no confidence in his government by critics of Israel's new
"strategic cooperation" agreement with the United States.
Although his broken thigh prevented him appearing in
the Knesset, Begin was able to hold together his shaky four
faction Likud coalition defeating the motion 57 to 53.
If the Likuc bloc had lost the no confidence vote, Begin's
government would have been obliged to resign, and new
elections probably would have been scheduled early next
year.
In a somewhat raucous, six-hour debate on the motion,
many of the 120 members of the Knesset exercised their right
to have a say about the controversial memorandum of un
derstanding signed in Washington on Monday night by Is
raeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and U.S. Defense Secre
tary Caspar W. Weinberger.
Spokesmen for the opposition Labor Party, which pressed
the no-confidence motion, contended that the agreement
adds nothing to Israel's security and could entangle the na
tion in superpower conflicts far beyond its borders.
Market quickly loses Tuesday gains
New York — A late bout of selling pushed the stock market
into a broad decline yesterday.
Prices skidded from the opening bell, firmed a bit midday
but then slipped further in the final hour. Steel, retail, elec
tronic and forest products stocks fell while precious metals
and aircraft issues provided some of the few bright spots.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which topped 890
Tuesday — its best level in three months — fell nearly 5
points in the first two hours of trading, cut its loss in half, then
turned lower in late trading to end the day at 882.61, off 7.61.
