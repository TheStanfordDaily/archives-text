Editor's election
Today's the day you get your say!
Staffers are reminded that their pres
ence is respectfully requested some
where between 10 a.m. and 8:15 p.m.
in the office to cast their ballot for
editor. If you forget we will hunt you
to the far corners of the gallaxy (and
maybe even the library if we get des
perate).
The voting list is posted outside
Sam's office; check with him if you
have any questions about the list or
the election.

Christmas banquet
This year's Christinas banquet — to
be held Dec. 9 at the Bella Vista Res
taurant in Woodside — promises to
be one of the best ever. Awards are

being chosen even as you read this
for all staffers who have demon
strated their loyalty, dedication and
willingness to endure unmen
tionable hardships in the quest for
journalistic ideals. Rumor has it that
you can't go to the banquet unless
you vote in Thursday's election for
editor. After all, if you don't vote you
have no right to comment, right?
Well, if you can't comment, you'll
miss a big part of the Christmas ban
quet. We'll probably be commenting
all night.
Photo meeting

tographers at 4 p.m. today in the Dai
ly office. Be there or be square. Or at
least be two columns by four and sev
en-eighths inches, cropped tight
with a 20 percent screen.
