# Interferon tested at Med Center

Researchers at the Medical Center
are currently using interferon to help
identify patients who run a high risk
of fatal complications from hepatitis
B.
Interferon, a protein derived natu
rally from human cells, has been
shown to be useful in fighting viral in
fections and reducing tumors. It is
produced by white blood cells when
they encounter foreign substances.
Meanwhile, recombinant DNA
techniques also developed at Stan
ford are making it easier for re
searchers to conduct definitive
clinical studies on interferon's anti
cancer and anti-viral potential.
Dr. Thomas Merigan, head of the
Division of Infectious Diseases is
directing a team of physicians who
are reponsible for the interferon re
search. Merigan is organizing a $2.6
million randomized clinical study of
interferon and another drug, Ara-

AMP, to determine their value in
treating hepatitis B. Earlier published
Stanford studies found that the two
drugs, used in combination or alone,
cured significant numbers of
hepatitis B patients.
The five-year research project is
being sponsored by the National In
stitute of Allergy and Infectious Dis
eases.
Although research results have
been encouraging, Merigan said he
remains cautious about the eventual
outcome. "Maybe we'll be able to
find some specific results with some
infectious diseases, but the jury is still
out," he said.
Hepatitis B, a liver disease that af
flicts more than 100 million people in
the world, is caused by a virus against
which no definitive treatment cur
rently exists. Ninety percent of
hepatitis victims recover with no per
manent damage. About 10 percent of
those hospitalized with the disease,

however, become chronically in
fected. According to Merigan, such
patients are major potential trans
mitters of hepatitis B.
Recent results from a large study of
hepatitis B victims here, conducted
by Merigan and his colleagues Drs.
Coleman Smith, Peter Gregory and
William Robinson, show that a small
number of chronically infected pa
tients are at high risk for fatal com
plications. Most importantly, they
found that an examination of liver tis
sue and blood tests can identify those
people who are in danger.
In the long-term study, the Stan
ford researchers divided 370 chronic
hepatitis B victims into three groups
according to their amount of liver
damage. After following their
progress for five years, the scientists
found that a small number (less than
3 percent) ran a 45 percent risk of
death from liver failure and related
complications.
Merigan's current research on the
effectiveness of interferon in treating
human tumors is subcontracted from
the Northern California Cancer Pro
gram, which is under a contract from
the National Institute of Health
(NIH). Merigan is also doing a cancer
study undera grantfrom Hoffman-La
Roche, a pharmaceutical company.
Past work by Merigan and other
Stanford specialists showed in
terferon to be successful in reducing
tumors of the lymphatic system, or
lymphomas. A cancer in thissystem is
characterized by a proliferation of B
cells and the formation of malignant
growths, or lymphomas, in the lym
phatic system. B lymphocytes are
white blood cells produced by the

bone marrow which play a role in the
body's immune system.
Merigan and his colleagues at the
Med School, Drs. Sandra Horning
and Saul Rosenberg, recently re
ported that interferon produced by
recombinant DNA techniques seems
to be safe for use as an anti-cancer
and anti-viral drug. Preliminary
clinical trials here indicate that the
bacteria-produced substance func
tions in essentially the same way as in
terferon derived naturally from hu
man cells.
Merigan stressed the importance
of the new gene-splicing technology.
Using recombinant DNA, interferon
can be produced in larger quantities
than ever before. In addition to
being purer and more plentiful than
the blood-cell-derived interferon,

the synthetic form will also be about
ten times cheaper.
The new technique of producing
interferon involves inserting the in
terferon gene from human
leukocytes (a type of white blood
cell) into bacteria.
This recent research was a "phase
1" safety study designed to test only
how well patients tolerated doses of
the bacteria-produced interferon,
not to test the drug's effectiveness.
However, the tests also produced en
couraging results about the synthetic
substance's anti-tumor potential.
Out of eight patients with advanced
cancers of various types who re
ceived intramuscular injections of in
terferon over a period of 34 to 56
days, four showed some evidence of
tumor regression.
