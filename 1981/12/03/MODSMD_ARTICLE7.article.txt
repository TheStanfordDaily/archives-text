## British view gun control seriously 
### Los Angeles Times 
London — If Nancy Rea
gan had applied in Britain
for a permit for the "tiny lit
, tie gun" she says she kept
near her bed in Los Angeles,
she would have been
turned down flat.
"Under no circumstances
would we grant a permit for
a firearm just for personal
protection," a senior
Scotland Yard official said
recently. "Personal protec
tion is the responsibility of
our police force."
And while President
Ronald Reagan continues to
oppose gun control, of
ficials here want to see gun
control tightened even
further in Britain.
"We need tougher regu
lations, particularly con
cerning shotguns," one of
ficial said.
British law, an official of
the Home Office said, pro
vides that "you may not
possess or acquire rifles,
pistols, revolvers and shot
guns unless you have al
ready obtained a certificate
from your local police, and
they will not issue a
certificate unless they are
satisfied that you have good
reason for having it, that
public safety is not en
dangered and that you are
fit to be entrusted with a
firearm."
Because of rules like this,
there are only 8000 to 9000
handguns and about 30,000
shotguns in the British Isles,
among a population of 55
million.
By contrast, in the United
States, with more than 220
million people, it is esti
mated that there are more
than 55 million handguns

alone, plus 150 million to
200 million rifles and shot
guns.
Strict regulations
According to the Home
Office official, the British
police may also impose con
ditions for issuing a
certificate, and may revoke
it. Moreover, certificates
must be renewed every
three years.
Generally, licenses are is
sued only to members of
registered target-shooting
clubs. Shotgun and rifle
licenses are issued only to
citizens who can show ac
ceptable reasons for shoot
ing and hunting.
Gun licenses are not is
sued to private detectives,
nor are private security
agencies allowed to issue
firearms to their officers.
Citizens applying for
certificates to own rifles or

shotguns must convince the
police that they have a land
owner's permission to hunt
on his land. Further, they
can be checked out by the
police to make sure that
they can handle a weapon
properly.
A Scotland Yard official
said, "We think the shotgun
is the toy of the landed gen
try, and the legislation on
the issuance of shotgun
certificates is weaker than
we think necessary."
Automatic weapons are
prohibited altogether, as
are such defensive agents as
tear gas sprays. There was a
public protest in the
northern city of Manchester
when the police there
purchased two submachine
guns for emergency use.
The British attitude
toward guns carries over to
the national police force.

Since its founding 150 years
ago, the British police force
has rarely used weapons.
Bobbies on the beat in
variably go unarmed.
Police restricted
Only about one-fifth of
Britain's 120,000 policemen
are even trained in the use
of firearms. And few of
these carry weapons under
normal circumstances.
The only policemen who
carry guns routinely are as
signed to the anti-terrorist
squad, the special patrol
group, the specialized fire
arms squad, the royal family
protection group, the diplo
matic protection group and
the Special Branch protec
tion squad, which escorts
Cabinet ministers and im
portant visitors.
Police also can call in the
commando forces of the
Special Air Service.

recently. "Personal protec
tion is the responsibility of
our police force."
And while President
Ronald Reagan continues to
oppose gun control, of
ficials here want to see gun
control tightened even
further in Britain.
"We need tougher regu
lations, particularly con
cerning shotguns," one of
ficial said.
British law, an official of
the Home Office said, pro
vides that "you may not
possess or acquire rifles,
pistols, revolvers and shot
guns unless you have al
ready obtained a certificate
from your local police, and
they will not issue a
certificate unless they are
satisfied that you have good
reason for having it, that
public safety is not en
dangered and that you are
fit to be entrusted with a
firearm."
Because of rules like this,
there are only 8000 to 9000
handguns and about 30,000
shotguns in the British Isles,
among a population of 55
million.
By contrast, in the United
States, with more than 220
million people, it is esti
mated that there are more
than 55 million handguns

alone, plus 150 million to
200 million rifles and shot
guns.
Strict regulations
According to the Home
Office official, the British
police may also impose con
ditions for issuing a
certificate, and may revoke
it. Moreover, certificates
must be renewed every
three years.
Generally, licenses are is
sued only to members of
registered target-shooting
clubs. Shotgun and rifle
licenses are issued only to
citizens who can show ac
ceptable reasons for shoot
ing and hunting.
Gun licenses are not is
sued to private detectives,
nor are private security
agencies allowed to issue
firearms to their officers.
Citizens applying for
certificates to own rifles or

shotguns must convince the
police that they have a land
owner's permission to hunt
on his land. Further, they
can be checked out by the
police to make sure that
they can handle a weapon
properly.
A Scotland Yard official
said, "We think the shotgun
is the toy of the landed gen
try, and the legislation on
the issuance of shotgun
certificates is weaker than
we think necessary."
Automatic weapons are
prohibited altogether, as
are such defensive agents as
tear gas sprays. There was a
public protest in the
northern city of Manchester
when the police there
purchased two submachine
guns for emergency use.
The British attitude
toward guns carries over to
the national police force.

Since its founding 150 years
ago, the British police force
has rarely used weapons.
Bobbies on the beat in
variably go unarmed.
Police restricted
Only about one-fifth of
Britain's 120,000 policemen
are even trained in the use
of firearms. And few of
these carry weapons under
normal circumstances.
The only policemen who
carry guns routinely are as
signed to the anti-terrorist
squad, the special patrol
group, the specialized fire
arms squad, the royal family
protection group, the diplo
matic protection group and
the Special Branch protec
tion squad, which escorts
Cabinet ministers and im
portant visitors.
Police also can call in the
commando forces of the
Special Air Service.

ARMED WITH SHIELDS ONLY — British police earlier this year in Manchester faced
rioters with plastic shields rather than resort to the use of fire arms. Few British po
lice units regularly carry guns or rifles.
