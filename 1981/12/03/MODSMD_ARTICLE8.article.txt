San Vicente Province, El
Salvador (AP) — Underground
leaders of the Democratic Rev
olutionary Front, meeting in a
well-fortified guerrilla camp,
claim their fight to overthrow
the Salvadoran government is
advancing "uncontainably."
They spoke to foreign cor
respondents at a ceremony last
Thursday marking the an
niversary of the killing of five
front leaders who were found
dead after being kidnapped
last year during a news con
ference in San Salvador, the na
tion's capital.
Responsibility for the deaths
of the five, who included
Enrique Alvarez Cordova, pres

ident of the front, was claimed
by a right-wing paramilitary or
ganization.
The Democratic Revolu
tionary Front is a coalition that
represents non-violent leftist
groups and five Marxist guer
rilla bands opposing El
Salvador's U.S.-backed junta.
At the San Vicente ceremo
ny, the rebels denied govern
ment claims that its troops had
complete control of this
Massachussetts-sized country
of 4.8 million people.
Eduardo Calles, vice presi
dent of the front, rejected the
death tolls issued by the army
officials in San Salvador as ex
aggerated. "They are really car

rying out the waron paper," he
said.
The ceremony included a
military parade and a moment
of silence for the slain leaders.
About 60 guerrillas performed
military precision drills on a
small soccer field in the middle
of the guerrilla camp. As they
marched they shouted slogans
to a crowd of about 100 spec
tators: "Death to the junta!
Death to North American im
perialism! Get the Yankees out
of El Salvador! Revolution or
Death!"
In remarks to reporters,
Calles also denied that
Salvadoran rebels are depen
dent upon the Soviet Union,

Cuba and Nicaragua for in
spiration, training or arms.
The leftists' fight, Calles said,
is the result of El Salvador's
poverty and its past govern
ments.
