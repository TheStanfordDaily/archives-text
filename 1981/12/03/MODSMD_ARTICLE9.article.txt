# Argentines, many with skills, leave home In search of work
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Every day they line
up by the hundreds in front of a handful of em
bassies, Argentines desperate to join millions of
their countrymen who have already fled in
search of a richer and freer life.
While exact figures are hard to come by, the
consensus of government officials, foreign con
sular officers and local observers is that about 2.5
million Argentines have emigrated to other
countries in the last two decades.
That is a serious drain fora country with a pop
ulation estimated at 27 million — the equivalent
in the United States of 20 million people emigrat
ing to live abroad.
Outside the American embassy, one 30-year
old graduate engineer, a third-generation Ar
gentine from a well-to-do family, said, "I can't
get a job here. There are too many engineers
and the economy is falling apart."
Argentina, for all its potential wealth, oil re
serves, high educational levels and physical
beauty, is an economic disaster area.
Unemployment runs at nearly 15 percent in
this country where anyone who works for one
hour a week is considered employed. Labor
union officials figure that 2.5 million people
have only part-time jobs or hold positions in
which they do no work.
Inflation is among the world's highest, run
ning upward of 150 percent a year, and it has
been at triple-digit levels for six years.
Businesses and banks are closing and, increas
ingly, beggars and people selling wire coat
hangers are seen on the streets.
This situation is relatively new to Argentina, a
country that at one time prided itself on zero un
employment.
The answer increasingly for many people is to
leave. Somos, the country's equivalent to Time

and Newsweek, recently ran a cover story en
titled "So Long, Country."
It figured that one out of every three Argen
tines born this year will end up citizens or per
manent residents of other nations.
Where do they go? Of the 2.5 million who
have left Argentina over the last 20 years, the
largest number are in the United States an es
timated 800,000.
Britain, Canada, Spain and Australia are the
other favorites, particularly for professional and
skilled workers.
The number of professionals seeking visas
abroad has jumped this year due to a lack of jobs
in Argentina.
Such a professional is Roberto Williams, a law
yer from an Anglo-Argentine family that came to
Argentina at the turn of the century.
Williams sees himself as a victim of a social sys
tem that produces an overabundance of pro
fessionals with no chance of working. "My pa
rents kept after me to be a lawyer, that anything
else was socially unacceptable."
Now he is unemployed — along with about 10
percent of the country's lawyers, many of whom
drive taxis, work in newsstands or clerk at hotels.
Lawyers are not alone. About 8 percent of the
engineers do not work, and of the 50,000 engi
neers who have graduated in recent years,
10,000 are living abroad.
Thousands of Argentines fled to the United
States and Europe in the 1970s as the country un
derwent the agony of terrorism and government
counterterrorism.
A young architect who is trying to get to Wash
ington where his older brother lives said, "There
is no hope for democracy; there isn't even hope
for a civilian government. All we can except is
more corruption and more repression. I want
out," he said.
