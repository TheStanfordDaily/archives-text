As we enter the holiday season . ..
• • • with its swirl of parties and other festivities, we are
reminded that every year people throughout the country die in avoidable accidents
caused by excessive drinking. Stanford is not immune to that kind of tragedy. Recogniz
ing that the holidays bring many opportunities to overindulge, we — who have survived
more holiday seasons than most of you — offer our own collection of guidelines that allow
drinking without abandoning common sense or concern for others.
As A Party-Goer:
— Don't let anyone bully you into drinking if you don't want to; the bullies are
being rude, not you.
— If you're an experienced drinker, you know your limits and should observe
them. If you're inexperienced, take it easy and try to observe how the alcohol
is affecting you; ask some people you trust to keep an eye on you, too.
— Experienced or inexperienced, if you suspect that you are likely to drink too
much, make sure that a sober friend is around to ensure that at the end of the
evening you will be safe, albeit sorry.
— When you're the sober one, help your host with the responsibilities outlined
above.
As a Party Host:
— Remember that some of your guests, some or all of the time, will not want to
drink alcohol. Make them feel equally welcome by having an ample supply of
agreeable non-alcoholic drinks (offering exotic rum cocktails versus canned
soft drinks is not a fair choice).
— Feature activities other than drinking (dancing, interesting foods, movies,
tree-trimming, games, etc.); it's more fun as well as less alcoholic.
— If you have many guests, ask some friends to share your duties, including
watching out for excessive drinking.
— About an hour bef ore you hope the party will end, start pushing food, coffee,
and appealing non-alcoholic drinks.
—Simply don't serve alcohol to anyone who you believe has had too much
already. Your guest may be irate at the time, but that's a small price to pay.
— If someone gets drunk in spite of all these efforts, come up with a driver or
overnight accommodations of some sort. An intoxicated person cannot be
trusted to get home safely even on foot, and certainly not behind the wheel of
a motor vehicle.
As host or guest, know that an evening of excessive drinking can be life
threatening even without a motor vehicle. Get immediate help (911) if a person
cannot be roused; drank about one fifth of hard liquor, or the equivalent, in 2 -
3 hours; and/or drank alcohol in combination with barbiturates.
We have no corner on wisdom and we know that experience is often a better
teacher than mere words. However, we care about you — even after our 8-to-5
jobs — and hope that our suggestions help you to avoid the kinds ol lessons that
ruin or end human lives.
