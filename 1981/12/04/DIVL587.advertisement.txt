/r/s/i luck,no opposition makeO'Connell editor
Irish Eyes were smilin' at The Stanford
Daily last night when news editor Joan
O'Connell learned that she had been
elected editor-in-chief of the Daily's spring
volume. O'Connell, a San Francisco native
but as Irish as the day her grandmothers
Kitty Fitzgerald and Gert Ryan were born,
has worked on the paper almost since
leprachauns discovered Lucky Charms.
O'Connell, proud owner of the nicest
bottom to warm the editor's chair in many
a year, will take control Feb. 1 of the Daily,
The Stanford Daily Publishing Corporation
and the fearsome Daily softball team.
In a rousing victory speech, Stanford's
latest gray-haired journalistic matriarch
pledged to review the operations of the
Daily "from the ground up." Many at the
Daily recalled with admiration the "thor
ough professionalism" of her review of the
concrete walkway in front of the Storke
Publications Building earlier this fall.
"Such dedication," said one doting staff
member, "on the night of a staff party!"
Despite the victory smiles, however, staf
fers in the know have already discerned a
power struggle in the highest ranks of the
incoming administration. O'Connell has
been locked behind the scenes in a bitter
dispute with incoming managing editor
Rasputin, er, Richard, Klingler. Klingler,
who campaigned aggressively on a Five-
Yearplan forthe Daily calling fora purge of
"Imperialist" influence, has openly ex
pressed a preference for printing the paper
in bold red ink, as opposed to traditional
black. As true to her heritage as Jameson's
is smooth, O'Connell is pushing for green
ink.
"Let's do both red and green," said
peacemaker and all-around good-natured
person Julie Kaufmann, who will serve as
O'Connell's other managing editor. "With
the holiday season coming up, I just think it
would be a neat idea. It can be Christmas at
the Daily 52 weeks a year."
O'Connell has pledged a number of in
novations for the Daily, including:
— Irish coffee for all staffers who have to
stay late with the paper;
— Potatoes, potatoes and more potatoes
for the Daily's traditional 10 p.m. munchie
break, and a special of potato soup for the
staff's upcoming Christmas banquet; and
— Preferential hiring of all staffers under
5'2". "If you look up to see the underside
of a mushroom, you've got a job here," she
told one reporter scurrying about under
foot.
For the fourth spring volume in a row,
the incoming editor succeeded in making
a mockery of democracy by running unop
posed. O'Connell was unapologetic,
saying that "many democratic nations,
such as the Philippines and Taiwan, have
uncontested elections." Herr Klingler
nodded his head in agreement.
O'Connell pledged to follow the "won
derful example" set by the previous three
spring volume predecessors — "my three
favorite people."
"What, no beer?" a disappointed
O'Connell said when the traditional cham
pagne was opened in honor of her election
victory. "Nobody has any class around
here."
