# Trudeau wins on constitution
## 
### 
Ottawa (AP) — The House of Commons has
approved the framework fora new Canadian
constitution, setting the stage for the end of the
last colonial tie between Britain and Canada by
spring.
The 246-24 vote in Parliament's lower house
Wednesday was a personal triumph for Prime
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. But it raised new
prospects of a showdown with the Quebec sepa
ratists who denounce the new constitution as a
threat to the local powers of their French-speak
ing province in the English-dominated nation.
Quebec's premier, Rene Levesque, ordered
provincial flags in his province flown at half-staff
in protest. His Parti Quebecois meets this week
end in Montreal to plan strategy, possibly fora
renewed independence campaign. His govern
ment, meanwhile, will appeal to the courts to
squelch the constitution, but it is given little
chance of success.
Quebec's position "is an important sad note
to an otherwise joyful occasion for us as Canadi
ans," Edward Broadbent, leader of the socialist
New Democrats, told reporters.
Ends anachronism
The resolution adopted by the Commons was
the product of a compromise between Trudeau
and the premiers of the nine English-speaking
provinces. Itasksthe British Parliamenttoendan
historical anachronism and hand over full legal
responsibility for the Canadian constitution, the
British North America Act of 1867, after making
some changes in it.

The resolution is expected to win approval
easily within a week in the largely powerless C
anadian Senate and to be approved by the British
Parliament by February.
Before the climactic vote, members of
Trudeau's Liberal Party gave the 62-year-old
prime minister a minute-long standing ovation.
Most of them wore red carnations in their lapels,
emulating the red boutonniere healwayssports.
After the vote, Liberal, Conservative and New
Democratic members and the packed galleries
stood and thundered out "O Canada," the na
tional anthem.
Under the revised constitution, the vast coun
try of 24 million people will continue to be a de
centralized federation.
Rights bill
The constitution for the first time will include
a Charter of Rights and Freedoms which
Trudeau hailed as the best bill of rights in the
world. It includes affirmations of freedom of
conscience, opinion, press and association;
guarantees against discrimination, including an
ERA-like sexual-equality provision, and a stipu
lation that the police must inform a suspect of his
right to counsel.
But in a bow to the provinces' historic auton
omy, provincial legislatures are allowed to pass
laws overriding most of these guarantees.
In final negotiations with the provincial pre
miers last month, Trudeau made a similar con
cession on the issue of future amendments.
