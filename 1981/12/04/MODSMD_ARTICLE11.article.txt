# Sakharov holds to protest fast
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — The hunger strike begun by An
drei Sakharov, the nuclear physicist and the
most trenchant and uninhibited leader in hu
man rights struggle in the Soviet Union, is in its
thirteenth day. Sakharov has taken this action to
an attempt to press the government to allow a
young woman to join a man in the United States
to whom she was married by proxy over a year
ago.
The Kremlin, generally extremely reluctant to
yield under public pressure, previously has re
jected attempts by the woman, Liza Alexeyevna,
26, to join Alexei Semenov, who is Sakharov's
stepson. Sakharov has said that the only possi
bility of ending his protest would be if the gov
ernment changed its mind.
The Kremlin has maintained public silence on
the issue. For all practical purposes, Soviet of
ficialdom silenced Sakharov almost two years
ago by banishing him to Gorki, an industrial city
250 miles east of here that is closed to foreigners.
Sakharov's accomplishments and interna
tional reputation make him perhaps theonly fig
ure in the Soviet Union today that could engage
on such a course with even some dim hope of
success.
The last thing the Kremlin would want at a
time when it is courting Western public opinion
is to have a man like Sakharov die.
Sakharov, now 60, fall from favor in 1968 after

writing an essay in which he protesting intellec
tual restraints and Soviet pressure against the lib
eral Dubcek government in Czechoslovakia. He
accused Soviet authorities of systematically vio
lating human rights, and most recently con
demned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
But more important to the Soviet perspective,
he is one of the country's foremost theoretical
physicists and was instrumental in developing
the Soviet hydrogen bomb. Over the years he
has received more honors and awards than most
of the Soviet leaders, including the 1975 Nobel
Peace Prize.
It is precisely his preeminent standing in Sovi
et science that has made Sakharov's dissent such
a complicated issue for authorities. He is still a
member of the Academy of Sciences.
Yelena Bonner, 58, Sakharov's wife, is joining
Sakharov in the hunger strike, on which they are
taking only mineral water.
The legal aspects of the case are complicated.
Bonner's son, Alexei Semenov, was allowed to
emigrate to the United States four years ago. He
was married at the time to Olga Luvshchina, and
she emigrated to the United States 18 months
ago.
They subsequently divorced in the United
States and Semenov, a graduate student at Bran
deis University, married Alexeyevna in a proxy
ceremony last summer.
