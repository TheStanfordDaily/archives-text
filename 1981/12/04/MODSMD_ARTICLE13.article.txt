# Ray Bacchetti: Stanford's budget king
## 
### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
Although no single person determines
budgetary allocations at the University,
Ray Bacchetti, vice-provost for man
agement and budget, plays one of the
most important roles in that process.
Some say that after President Donald
Kennedy, Bacchetti is the University's
most powerful administrator.
Bacchetti is involved in sorting out and
evaluating the financial needs of all of the
various sectors of the University. He faces
the difficult task of balancing the Univer
sity's educational and research goals with
its physical needs — all of this within the
University's budget constraints. He is in
charge of financial planning, preparation
for the operating and capital budgets,
space allocation, facilities planning and
provostial functions.
Aside from his management duties Bac
chetti occasionally takes on special
projects. He was instrumental in develop
ing the University's minority student re
cruitment program in the early '70s.
Instead of getting away from education
in his spare time, Bacchetti holds the job
of Palo Alto school board president.
What do you feel are your main responsi
bilities?
I see my role as that of a general man
ager. I try to be helpful to people in ways

that keep the University running. As Stan
ford gets bigger and more complex it has
to meet more and more demands and in
order to do that successfully the provost's

'At a university,
management does not
have as much priority as it
does in industry. Here the
faculty is more important
than the management. I
have to try and make the
University work effectively
and efficiently and not get

in the way/

office has to coordinate these demands.
We have to see that the right questions
are raised and to help identify sources of

funds.

efficiently and not get in the way.
How much is tuition expected to increase
next year?
In our longer range forecasts we
projected tuition to increase six percent
above inflation for 1982-83 and six per
cent above inflation for 1983-84. Right
now it's too early to know the exact in
crease.
Why are tuition increases above inflation?
Mainly because of the increased cost of
utilities. Prices for utilities have gone up at
rates of 20 and 30 percent, way above in
flation. In 1971 utilties made up two per
cent of the budget and in 1982 they made
up seven percent of the budget.
With inflation, so much of our budget is
used to fund existing programs, but in or
der to keep Stanford progressing we need
to have money to try new things.
Will tuition increases combined with the
Reagan administration's reduction in stu
dent aid programs limit the ability of qual
ified lower income students to enroll at
the University?
We hope that nobody who is admitted

has an economic reason for not enrolling
at Stanford. Our policy is to provide a
combined package of financial aidtoany
one not able to afford Stanford. We make
that a high priority. If that is not a high
budget priority we will lose our ability to
continue this policy.
We always consider tuition in relation
to financial aid. Our financial aid policy is
to keep up with tuition increases and
make up for any federal and state pro
grams that don't grow or are cut back. Last
year $1,027,000 was made up by Stanford
in increased financial aid. The bulk of un
dergraduate financial aid comes from the
general fund.
What percentage of the University's
budget is made up by tuition and is that
expected to remain the same?
Tuition makes up about 50 percent of
the budget and in general we try to keep
that proportion the same. The rest of the
budget is made up through grants, gifts
and reimbursed indirect costs.
How have economic fluctuations general
ly affected the University's ability to get
grants and gifts?
Last year was our most successful year
in terms of gift receipts. Economic fluc
tuations have affected different sectors of
the economy differently which has

that can be cut in order to provide funds
for the new needs.
The last thing in the equation is how far
down the list we go with general funds.
We calibrate how much money is avail
able and we then look into alternative
sources of funding. In some cases we give
new programs or needs one-time fund
ing.

'Our faculty is at the top of
the range. Most of our
salaries are at the 95
percent level of higher
education/

How are salaries of faculty and staff de
termined?
Salaries are always a big issue because
they make up about two-thirds of the to
tal expenses. They're particularly impor
tant here because it's so expensive to live
in this area. Our faculty is at the top of the
range. Most of our salaries are at the 95
percent level of higher education.
Wo compete with private firms in the
area for staff so we try to aim our staff
salaries at the middle of the private level.
If wo lose ground on salaries to private
companies it becomes difficult to recruit
and retain good people.

What do you feel are your main responsi

I see my role as that of a general man

that keep the University running. As Stan

to meet more and more demands and in

How much is tuition expected to increase
next year?
In our longer range forecasts we
projected tuition to increase six percent
above inflation for 1982-83 and six per
cent above inflation for 1983-84. Right
now it's too early to know the exact in
crease.
Why are tuition increases above inflation?
Mainly because of the increased cost of
utilities. Prices for utilities have gone up at
rates of 20 and 30 percent, way above in
flation. In 1971 utilties made up two per
cent of the budget and in 1982 they made
up seven percent of the budget.
With inflation, so much of our budget is
used to fund existing programs, but in or
der to keep Stanford progressing we need
to have money to try new things.
Will tuition increases combined with the
Reagan administration's reduction in stu
dent aid programs limit the ability of qual
ified lower income students to enroll at
the University?
We hope that nobody who is admitted

has an economic reason for not enrolling
at Stanford. Our policy is to provide a
combined package of financial aidtoany
one not able to afford Stanford. We make
that a high priority. If that is not a high
budget priority we will lose our ability to
continue this policy.
We always consider tuition in relation
to financial aid. Our financial aid policy is
to keep up with tuition increases and
make up for any federal and state pro
grams that don't grow or are cut back. Last
year $1,027,000 was made up by Stanford
in increased financial aid. The bulk of un
dergraduate financial aid comes from the
general fund.
What percentage of the University's
budget is made up by tuition and is that
expected to remain the same?
Tuition makes up about 50 percent of
the budget and in general we try to keep
that proportion the same. The rest of the
budget is made up through grants, gifts
and reimbursed indirect costs.
How have economic fluctuations general
ly affected the University's ability to get
grants and gifts?
Last year was our most successful year
in terms of gift receipts. Economic fluc
tuations have affected different sectors of
the economy differently which has

that can be cut in order to provide funds
for the new needs.
The last thing in the equation is how far
down the list we go with general funds.
We calibrate how much money is avail
able and we then look into alternative
sources of funding. In some cases we give
new programs or needs one-time fund
ing.

'Our faculty is at the top of
the range. Most of our
salaries are at the 95
percent level of higher
education/

How are salaries of faculty and staff de
termined?
Salaries are always a big issue because
they make up about two-thirds of the to
tal expenses. They're particularly impor
tant here because it's so expensive to live
in this area. Our faculty is at the top of the
range. Most of our salaries are at the 95
percent level of higher education.
Wo compete with private firms in the
area for staff so we try to aim our staff
salaries at the middle of the private level.
If wo lose ground on salaries to private
companies it becomes difficult to recruit
and retain good people.

Although no single person determines
budgetary allocations at the University,
Ray Bacchetti, vice-provost for man
agement and budget, plays one of the
most important roles in that process.
Some say that after President Donald
Kennedy, Bacchetti is the University's
most powerful administrator.
Bacchetti is involved in sorting out and
evaluating the financial needs of all of the
various sectors of the University. He faces
the difficult task of balancing the Univer
sity's educational and research goals with
its physical needs — all of this within the
University's budget constraints. He is in
charge of financial planning, preparation
for the operating and capital budgets,
space allocation, facilities planning and
provostial functions.
