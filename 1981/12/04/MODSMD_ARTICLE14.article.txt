## Gary Ferries God on side of intolerance? 
### 
At any large gathering of people,
one can expect a certain number of
con artists, doomsayers, hucksters,
and charlatans to appear seeking in
nocent victims. Thus, it was really no
surprise that the Moral Majority
showed up at this year's Big Game.
Nor was it particularly shocking to
read the appropriately colored yel
low handbill that they were passing
out, titled "Sex, Penthouse, and Dr.
Falwell" (or on the reverse side, "El
Sexo, Penthouse, y el Dr. Falwell").
What is troubling, however, is that
despite the fact that the Moral Ma
jority makes no effort to conceal its
extremist goals, most of us in the real
majority fail to recognize that the
new morality movement is just the
old intolerance with a few new twists.
Still, the Moral Majority cannot be
dismissed as just another group of
misguided zealots.
Let me state at the outset that I
have some serious moral conflicts
about writing anything which de
fends Bob Guccione and Penthouse.
There is a certain intangible ex
ploitative attitude behind Penthouse
which I cannot condone. Therefore,
the anti-Penthouse diatribe will not
be argued here, it will only be used as
an illustrative example. Suffice it to
say that I must disagree with Rev.
Geoffrey Tachet, authorof'Sex, Pen
thouse, and Dr. Falwell," when he as
serts that "the people at Penthouse
are lost, hell-bound sinners who hate
everything that God and the Bible
stand for." judge not, lest ye be
judged, Reverend.
After denouncing Penthouse, the
handbill goes on to interpret a Bible
passage in a rather peculiar manner:
"If you continue to smoke dope, one
day you will be in hell, according to
Revelation 21:8." Those guys
thought of everything, didn't they?
No doubt this interpretation was lost
when the King James translation was
made. Rev. Tachet goes on to say, "If
you continue to go on getting drunk,
one day.you will be in hell ... if you

So on having sex outside of marriage,
one day vou will be in hell, according
to Revelation 21:8." This, again, is the
standard fire and brimstone sermon
izing which has been traditional
among certain sects. It is just an ex
ample of the same old intolerance,
and as such, is nothing new. If one
ascribes to this set of spiritual man
dates, one is free to follow them, and
in this country, if one does not
ascribe to this set of beliefs, one
should be free to ignore them.
The real danger of the Moral Ma
jority can be seen when the Rever
end sums up his case: "Which side
are you on: do you stand with Christ
and Dr. Falwell or with the devil and
Penthouse! Your choice will de-

termine whether or not you go to
hell." The problem is that the Moral
Majority has applied this simplistic
right or wrong, good vs. evil ap
proach to every political issue, with
the hidden threat that"you will go to
hell if you do not support our posi
tion on this." Not only is this an un
realistic approach to the often am
biguous world of politics, but it com
pletely ignores the right those of oth
er faiths have to live by their own be
liefs. This approach typifies the new
intolerance.
It is often said that any position
may be supported by choosing the
proper statistics. In a similar fashion,
almost any position may be sup
ported with judicious use of religious
quotations. In this manner, the Moral
Majority has fabricated religioussup

port fora wide range of secular goals.
For instance, the Michigan Moral
Majority has an 18-point platform for
the 1980s. Included on this platform
are opposition to such issues as arms
limitation talks with the Soviet
Union, OSHA (Occupational Safetv
and Health Administration) regu
lations, the Equal Rights Amend
ment, gambling, drugs, alcohol and
pornography. While emphasizing
"Don't's" over "Do's," the platform
also includes support fora strong and
disciplined Army, return of public
schools to community control and
voluntary school prayer. It is hard to
believe that SALT talks could be
against the will of God. If so, it is in
deed true that "God works in strange

and mysterious ways."
The new intolerance is very much
like the old intolerance, but the
number of attitudes which are con
sidered intolerable has increased in
number and range. The fanatics are
no longer to concern themselves
merely with the old "moral" issues
like alcohol, sex, drugs, and rock
and-roll. Now they are also dabbling
in political issues, such as national de
fense and AWACs sales. Their scope
has widened, but their vision remains
narrow; their views are morally
"right", and others' views are wrong,
with no room for compromise. Cod,
after all, is on their side.

showed up at this year's Big Game.
Nor was it particularly shocking to
read the appropriately colored yel
low handbill that they were passing
out, titled "Sex, Penthouse, and Dr.
Falwell" (or on the reverse side, "El
Sexo, Penthouse, y el Dr. Falwell").
What is troubling, however, is that
despite the fact that the Moral Ma
jority makes no effort to conceal its
extremist goals, most of us in the real
majority fail to recognize that the
new morality movement is just the
old intolerance with a few new twists.
Still, the Moral Majority cannot be
dismissed as just another group of
misguided zealots.
Let me state at the outset that I
have some serious moral conflicts
about writing anything which de
fends Bob Guccione and Penthouse.
There is a certain intangible ex
ploitative attitude behind Penthouse
which I cannot condone. Therefore,
the anti-Penthouse diatribe will not
be argued here, it will only be used as
an illustrative example. Suffice it to
say that I must disagree with Rev.
Geoffrey Tachet, authorof'Sex, Pen
thouse, and Dr. Falwell," when he as
serts that "the people at Penthouse
are lost, hell-bound sinners who hate
everything that God and the Bible
stand for." judge not, lest ye be
judged, Reverend.
After denouncing Penthouse, the
handbill goes on to interpret a Bible
passage in a rather peculiar manner:
"If you continue to smoke dope, one
day you will be in hell, according to
Revelation 21:8." Those guys
thought of everything, didn't they?
No doubt this interpretation was lost
when the King James translation was
made. Rev. Tachet goes on to say, "If
you continue to go on getting drunk,
one day.you will be in hell ... if you

So on having sex outside of marriage,
one day vou will be in hell, according
to Revelation 21:8." This, again, is the
standard fire and brimstone sermon
izing which has been traditional
among certain sects. It is just an ex
ample of the same old intolerance,
and as such, is nothing new. If one
ascribes to this set of spiritual man
dates, one is free to follow them, and
in this country, if one does not
ascribe to this set of beliefs, one
should be free to ignore them.
The real danger of the Moral Ma
jority can be seen when the Rever
end sums up his case: "Which side
are you on: do you stand with Christ
and Dr. Falwell or with the devil and
Penthouse! Your choice will de-

The problem is that the Moral Majority has
applied this simplistic right or wrong, good
vs. evil approach to every political issue, with
the hidden threat that 44 you will go to hell if
you do not support our position on this."

termine whether or not you go to
hell." The problem is that the Moral
Majority has applied this simplistic
right or wrong, good vs. evil ap
proach to every political issue, with
the hidden threat that"you will go to
hell if you do not support our posi
tion on this." Not only is this an un
realistic approach to the often am
biguous world of politics, but it com
pletely ignores the right those of oth
er faiths have to live by their own be
liefs. This approach typifies the new
intolerance.
It is often said that any position
may be supported by choosing the
proper statistics. In a similar fashion,
almost any position may be sup
ported with judicious use of religious
quotations. In this manner, the Moral
Majority has fabricated religioussup

port fora wide range of secular goals.
For instance, the Michigan Moral
Majority has an 18-point platform for
the 1980s. Included on this platform
are opposition to such issues as arms
limitation talks with the Soviet
Union, OSHA (Occupational Safetv
and Health Administration) regu
lations, the Equal Rights Amend
ment, gambling, drugs, alcohol and
pornography. While emphasizing
"Don't's" over "Do's," the platform
also includes support fora strong and
disciplined Army, return of public
schools to community control and
voluntary school prayer. It is hard to
believe that SALT talks could be
against the will of God. If so, it is in
deed true that "God works in strange

and mysterious ways."
The new intolerance is very much
like the old intolerance, but the
number of attitudes which are con
sidered intolerable has increased in
number and range. The fanatics are
no longer to concern themselves
merely with the old "moral" issues
like alcohol, sex, drugs, and rock
and-roll. Now they are also dabbling
in political issues, such as national de
fense and AWACs sales. Their scope
has widened, but their vision remains
narrow; their views are morally
"right", and others' views are wrong,
with no room for compromise. Cod,
after all, is on their side.

At any large gathering of people,
one can expect a certain number of
con artists, doomsayers, hucksters,
and charlatans to appear seeking in
nocent victims. Thus, it was really no
surprise that the Moral Majority
showed up at this year's Big Game.
