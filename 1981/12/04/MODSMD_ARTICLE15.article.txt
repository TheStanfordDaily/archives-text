## Reagan can't turn Salvadoran peasants against guerillas 
### 
La Virtud, Honduras — Washington will
have a rough time convincing thousands of
frightened Salvadoran peasants here that
their gravest threat comes from leftist guer
rillas fighting back home in El Salvador.
On the contrary, the 3000 refugees in the
United Nations camp near this isolated
border town are least worried by anti-gov
ernment guerrillas. They know that their big
gest enemiesare the U.S.-backed Salvadoran
army and the Honduran troops supposedly
protecting them.
"The refugees," warned a French doctor
who has been treating them, "are frightened
for their lives."
Alarmed by the expanding nature of the
Salvadoran civil war, we flew from the Hon
duran capital of Tegucigalpa in a single-en
gine Piper and then bounced by jeep over a
rocky mountain road to reach tiny La Virtud
(Virtue). Eighteen hours by poor roads from
the capital, this impoverished village of sev
eral hundred boasts only a barren central
square and stable-like shelters for its resi
dents. Malnourished children and elderly

persons with goiter problems are prevalent.
A radio operated by a humanitarian or
ganization offers them the only contact with
the world outside.
For both villagers and refugees living out
side of town, tension mounted after
Salvadoran troops and armed civilians
crossed the border and entered La Virtud at
midday, Nov. 16. With the knowledge and
consent of Honduran officers in town, the
Salvadoran militias tried to kidnap as many as
40 refugees and march them to certain death
back inside El Salvador's war zone.
Frustrated by the stalemate of the civil war,
Salvadoran troops have resorted to killing
refugees indiscriminately to inflate body
counts and force them out of the border
area.
Fortunately, self-styled humanitarian
Bianca Jagger and a visiting American dele
gation helped foil the tragedy by interven
ing. Another group of Salvadoran refugees
at a settlement near La Virtud wasn't so
lucky.
Despite a $2.6 million refugee budget in

Honduras, the United Nations keeps only
one man on the border to oversee the secur
ity of the camps. It's powerless to stop the
mounting campaign by the Honduran and
Salvadoran militaries to terrorize civilians on
both sides of the border.
Reports of refugee and relief worker har
rassment cause U.S. military advisers in
Tegucigalpa (at any time, there are from one
to 21 stationed in Honduras; Green Berets
have been seen working near the border)
either to roll over and play dumb or to deny
them as Soviet-inspired "disinformation."
Yet the U.S. advisers know full well what's
going on here. Indeed, instead of moving to
stop it, the United States is bankrolling such
behavior with its military support for the
Salvadoran and Honduran governments.
Many Americans might wonder how the
United States plans to win the "hearts and
minds" of Central Americans by tolerating
the cooperative terrorism of its surrogates
against defenseless women and children.
Yet Secretary of State Alexander Haig, top
Reagan aide Edwin Meese and a slew of Viet

nam-burned officials in Washington believe
such actions can be overlooked when anti
government guerrillas receive food and
medicine from peasants on both sides of the
border. (Since many top Central American

experts have fled the State Department, such
incorrect impressions are easy to come by.)
Relief workers and refugees minimize
their involvement on either side of the war.
Doctors are quick to belittle the claim that
their malnourished patients could be under

writing the guerrillas.
"I could give you, in calories or pounds,
what they eat in a week, and you'd see how
they couldn't be supporting the guerrillas,"
said one relief worker, who for fear of repris
al refused to give his name. "Men can't even
work for more than a morning before they
tire from lack of energy."
Before the Reagan administration turns
Honduras into another Cambodia-like stag
ing ground in the battle for Central America,
they ought to listen to people here. Ev
eryone we spoke with, including a young
brother of a Salvadoran rightist, conveyed
non-ideological, tacit support for the elusive
guerrillas.
"The difference between the government
and the guerrillas," moaned an elderly wom
an who had walked three days to reach La
Virtud, losing four children in the process,
"is that with the government, you can't live
anymore."
