Blame pregnancy on amoral society

We are indebted to the author of
the letter "to a Stanford boy" for giv
ing us a vivid picture of the price
sometimes paid for the joys of illicit
love. It is too bad that we do not have
the stories of all of the others who got
"caught" (became pregnant) as well
as the complete stories of those who
thought (mistakenly) that they had
escaped all harm because they had
practiced birth control.
Unfortunately the woman who
told about her abortion and, I am
afraid, many of those who read her
letter, have not learned all that they
should have from her experience.
Her condemnation of "sexism"
shows that she still does not under
stand that men and women have dif
ferent functions in life; and her con
demnation of "racism" shows that
she still does not realize that there
are inherited differences in character
even after her sad experience
through being involved with a man

of defective character.
Instead of placing all of the blame
on her boyfriend, she should place
most of the blame on her parents and
especially on her father. If he had tru-
Iv loved her, he would not have per
mitted her in an environment with
many temptations without adequate
preparation to withstand such temp
tations; and hp would have made
sure that she associated with people
who would help her to stay on the
right course.
And she should place some of the
blame on the University adminis
tration. The founding grant by the
Stanfords specified that religion and
morality should be taught at Stan
ford; but everything I know about
Stanford indicates no effort what
soever to teach religion or morality
but rather a bias against religion and
morality.
Some individuals may succeed in
living virtuous lives without being as

sociated with any institutionalized re
ligion; but collectively mankind can
not survive without religion. The hu
man race is inherently religious; and
no nation has ever existed or can ex
ist without a religion. (The socialist
anti-religious so-called nations are
parasitic entities which will perish
when we stop giving them aid and
support.)
America is a Christian nation and
people; and when we cease to be
Christian, we shall cease to be either
a nation or a people. Christianity is
based on the Bible; and the Bible
condems infanticide above all other
crimes. It provides the death penalty
for causing an abortion.
The author asks for compassion;
but what compassion did she have
for the child that she killed? She has
had a very painful experience; but
she is still alive and her child is not.
She should be praying that she might
be forgiven for killing her child.

Escort plan unrealistic
We strongly take issue with the fla
grantly fallacious reasoning and in
defensible conclusions of the recent
letter (Daily, Nov. 30) by Fd Gilliland.
The male escort plan may have some
merit as a short (about one week) ex
perience which would allow men to
share, however imperfectly, the re
duction in personal freedom ex
perienced by Stanford women lately.
It cannot, however, constitute a sen

sible long-term solution to the cur
rent problem.
A male escort plan is not a viable
solution for at least two reasons,
either of them sufficient. First, such a
plan would be an Orwellian infringe
ment upon personal liberties, as ex
plicitly guaranteed by the U.S. Con
stitution (not by God). Second, and
more important, this plan could not
possibly succeed. It is unclear that
the rapist(s) are Stanford students, or
that if they were, that they would fol
low these guidelines. It is equally un
clear that compliance could be effec
tively enforced. Who would do the
enforcing?
We feel that a realistic solution
would be more technical in nature.
Much more adequate lighting, im
proved escort services (it is here that
a truly "small amount of freedom"
might go a long way), an increased
police presence, especially on foot in
high-risk areas, and the wearing of
whistles by women when out at
night, unescorted, would combine to
have a much greater impact on the
chances of a sexual assault occurring.
These measures have been used
quite effectively and successfully in
communities with much higher rates
of all types of violent crime, and
should therefore work to make the
Stanford community a much safer
place to live.
