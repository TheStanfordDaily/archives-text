The tenth annual Christmas Faire will be
held this weekend in and around Tresidder
Union. Organized by Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS), the Faire will feature at least 80 dif
ferent types of arts and crafts as well as food
and entertainment, according to Jean Martin,
advisor to STARTS.
"When we first started the Christmas Faire
10 years ago we wanted a light-hearted event
before the students went home for Christ
mas," said Martin. "We decided to ask 40
craftspeople from a local fair if they would
like to do a fair at Stanford and they all said
'yes.' "
Since that time the Christmas Faire has
grown "very popular" with craftspeople, ac
cording to Martin. "People like to come to
Stanford and they like the idea of a fair," she
said.
The Christmas Faire has become so popular
among craftspeople that STARTS receives
many more requests from craftspeople who
wish to participate than the fair can ac
comodate.
"We look for crafts of very high qualitythat
will be of particular interest to the Stanford
community. Sometimes we take people who
won't sell a lot but areinteresting," said
Martin."We have loyalty to people who were
here before." About 80 percent of the pre
vious year's participants are accepted back,
"but we try to give new people a chance,
too," she said.
"We also screen the applicants for
friendliness. We want people who will work
harmoniously with everybody else," she said.
The craftspeople also have good feelings
about the fair. Holly Peake, who has partici
pated in the Christmas Faire for nine years,
said "the atmosphere is very exciting and the
people are beautiful."
Peake, who described himself as a "street
artist" in San Francisco, finds bird-shaped

pinecones in the Sierra and mounts them on
driftwood gathered from the coast. "I enjoy
using the familiar in an unfamiliar way and
heightening awareness of the simple beauty
of simple things," he said.
Tony Lydgate, a wood craftsman, is attend
ing his third Christmas Faire. Lydgate, who
gave up a career as a clinical psychologist,
said his craft is a "nice foil to head work . . .
"I like the concreteness, tangibility, and
functionality of crafts. It is ethical, honest
work, and I am able to relate directly to peo
ple," he said.
"I try to pack as much energy in everything
I do as possible — into the shape and design
ofthe wood. Mystyle is usually the traditional
form, but sometimes I like to create expecta
tions and then do something different," he
said.
Rikk Kvitek, who makes wooden puzzles,
participated in the Christmas Faire for the first
time last year, but turned out to be the big
gest seller there. His puzzles are made of
wood, rope, beads, and a brass ring, and the
objective is usually to disentangle the ring
from the rest ofthe puzzle.Theeasiest puzzle
usually takes about half an hour while the
longest needs about six to 12 months, accord
ing to Kvitek.
"I got the idea when I was teaching kin
dergarten three years ago and I wanted some
thing to aid the children in conceptualiza
tion," said Kvitek.
Solving the puzzles requires "a series of
conceptual leaps — you must change your
perception to see the next step. Most people
approach a puzzle with the attitude that it
must be solved right away and if they can't do
it, they're stupid," he said. According to
Martin, the Faire was originally not intended
as a "money-making event," but now earns
about $19,000 annually, providing enough
money to help underwrite the STARTS pro
gram for the rest of the year.

"I try to pack as much energy in everything
I do as possible — into the shape and design
ofthe wood. Mystyle is usually the traditional
form, but sometimes I like to create expecta
tions and then do something different," he
said.
Rikk Kvitek, who makes wooden puzzles,
participated in the Christmas Faire for the first
time last year, but turned out to be the big
gest seller there. His puzzles are made of
wood, rope, beads, and a brass ring, and the
objective is usually to disentangle the ring
from the rest ofthe puzzle.Theeasiest puzzle
usually takes about half an hour while the
longest needs about six to 12 months, accord
ing to Kvitek.
"I got the idea when I was teaching kin
dergarten three years ago and I wanted some
thing to aid the children in conceptualiza
tion," said Kvitek.
Solving the puzzles requires "a series of
conceptual leaps — you must change your
perception to see the next step. Most people
approach a puzzle with the attitude that it
must be solved right away and if they can't do
it, they're stupid," he said. According to
Martin, the Faire was originally not intended
as a "money-making event," but now earns
about $19,000 annually, providing enough
money to help underwrite the STARTS pro
gram for the rest of the year.
