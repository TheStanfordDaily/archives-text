A delegation led by Sidney Drell, Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) deputy director, Stanford Nobel
Laureate Paul Flory and UC-Berkeley laureate Edwin
McMillan delivered a "statement of concern and sup
port" for noted Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov to the
Soviet Consulate in San Francisco last night.
Sakharov, 60, and his wife, are in the 13th day of a hun
ger strike (timed to coincide with Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev's arrival in West Germany last month)
which protests the Soviet government's refusal to allow
Sakharov's daughter-in-law, Liza Alekseyeva, to emi
grate to the United States to rejoin her husband.
The statement was signed by 31 American Nobel
Laureates, including six Stanford professors. The six Uni
versity laureates were Flory, biochemistry professor Paul
Berg, economics professor Kenneth Arrow, physics pro
fessors Robert Hofstadter and Arthur Schawlow, and
SLAC researcher Burton Richter.

The petition promised to"hold the Soviet government
responsible for the hazard to Sakharov's health which
this hunger strike has caused," and urged that
"Alekseyeva be granted permission to emigrate before
serious and permanent damage is done."
"All those who admire your noble leadership as a
fighter for peace and for human rights sympathize with
you and your wife's distress at this hour," said Arrow in a
wire to Sakharov yesterday morning.
A candlelight vigil in front of the Soviet Consulate in
San Francisco followed the presentation and featured
speeches by singer Joan Baez and Yuri Yarim-agaev, a
former Soviet human rights activist who now works with
Flory. Approximately 200 people participated.
"It's a question of suffocating a voice called the 'cons
cience of mankind' in the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize cita
tion," Drell said, adding that if the Soviets cannot deal
with the embarrassment which keeping Sakharov and his
family in the Soviet Union creates, then they should "ex
pel the problem."
