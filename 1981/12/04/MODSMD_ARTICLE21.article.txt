# Bookbinding: Judging a book by cover
## 
### Tracy Rosendahl 
In some cases, one can't help but judge a
book by its cover. The Special Collections
Department of Green Library recently
opened an exhibit displaying a traveling
collection dedicated to bookbinding, put
forth by the Guild of Book Workers in hon
or of their 75th anniversary.
Bookbinding is "an art in itself" and
therefore should be viewed as such, said
Fred Cheever of the Special Collections
Department. The process involves a com
plex manual procedure which is usually
practiced as a hobby as binders rarely are
intrested in commercial publishing, he
said.

Two types of covers are on display depic
ting both historical and modern styles. The

retrospective works, represented by artists
such as Edith Diehl and Cordelia Baker,
serve to illustrate the history of the Guild
and are characterized by classical guilding
â€” intricate patterns of gold work on the
covers.
Modern covers, which show more color
and imagination than their traditional
counterparts, have very bright, abstract
designs. Cheever said that the modern
works, though "not as accomplished or ex
act as the traditional, are more creative."
In addition to the final cover products,
sections on lettering, the process of mak
ing marbilized paper and examples of res
torations are included in the assemblage in
the rotunda.
Stanford is the fourth stop of the exhibi
tion's journey around the country. It has
already visited other galleries and libraries
in New York and Texas, and at the end of
December will be leaving Stanford and
heading for Chicago, its last appearance.
The rotunda, where the exhibit is on dis
(play, is in the west wing of Green Library,
an area which after the recent renovation
of the East wing is now available to the Spe
cial Collections Department. They are us
ing the space to acquaint the Stanford
community with different aspects of the
collection through various exhibits such as
famous rare books and papers, and proc
esses such as bookbinding.

The bookbinding exhibition is the sec
ond in what will be a continuing series of
displays. Coming attractions include the
Hanna Honeycomb Exhibit, featuring the
famousarchitectural design by Frank Lloyd
Wright of the Paul Hanna home on cam
pus.
The Special Collections Department is
looking forward to the set up of the Kline-

'77ie process involves a
complex manual
procedure which is usually
practiced as a hobby as
binders are rarely
interested in commercial
publishing/

Roethke Collection scheduled to open in
January. This is a new rare book collection
owned by the University.
According to Cheever, the Special Col
lections Department is "Stanford's re
pository for really rare and valuable mate
rial." This department, along with the Uni
versity Archives which stores all of the
documents pertaining to the University,
holds records on the past and keeps tabs
on the present.


The books in the exhibition, which are
meant to be looked at and not read, vary in
their illustrative styles, said Cheever.
