Q; Why is Meyer like a greenhouse? I'm
tired of walking out and feeling like I just fin
ished running a marathon.
-J.B.
A: Unfortunately, you'll have to continue
to suffer heat exhaustion or else find a new
place to study. Because Meyer Library is run
on a centralized air conditioning unit, the
temperature cannot be controlled by a
thermostat located in the library itself. The
architecture of the building results in hot and
Cold pockets so while you may be sweating
profusely, people in other areas of the library
are bundled up in sweaters and coats.

Q: Could you please tell me what the con
struction is about between the Post Office
and iathrop. Are tuition increases going
towardpurchasingcampus swampland? How
much longer must I trudge my bike through
the mud?
-D.J.

A: No, Lake Lagunita has not expanded.
The construction which began last month on
the west side of the Post Office is utility work
in anticipation of the new Braun music cen
ter. The pipe rerouting is expected to be
completed by January and then a temporary
fence will be installed during construction of
the new building. So although the area will be
somewhat of a mess fora while, the muddy
conditions should be improved shortly after
Christmas break.

Q. Who gets to review restaurants for the
Daily and how does the process work?
— M.S.
A: According to our restaurants editor Liz
Rosner, anyone is able to review restaurants.
Those interested are to contact her and find
out what restaurants are available to he re
viewed. The reviewer and one guest are en
titled to a complimentary meal and any items
from the menu may be selected which the re
viewer feels appropriate. To insure greater
accuracy, the diner is requested to remain in
cognito (not reveal Daily affiliation) until the
meal is through.
