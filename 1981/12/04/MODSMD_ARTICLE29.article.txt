# Fire ends plan for restoration
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Lynn, Mass.â€” About 10 years
ago, a team from the American
Institute of Architecture visited
this old manufacturing city and
viewed its shoe factories, aban
doned because of cheap for
eign competition, with fresh
eyes. Its members said the
buildings should be treated as
monuments to America's In
dustrial Revolution.
Lynn's leadership responded
to the idea, and worked en
thusiastically to turn the down
town into a model of industrial,
educational and residential de
velopment. Eight-story Ed
wardian factory buildings were
converted to middle-income
apartment houses for the
elderly or space for new manu
facturers. A community col
lege campus was to be built.
The city spent $4 million of its
own and $14 million in federal
funds. Lynn's residents viewed
the urban renewal effort with
great pride.
Then, early last Saturday
morning, came what will
always be remembered here as
the Great Lynn Fire.
And on Tuesday, almost
three days after the fire began,
they were still pouring water
on the ruins. Even with a chill
rain falling, pockets of fire still
burned and firefighters still
manned the hoses in a city that
looked like Berlin in 1945.
"When we arrived, all you
could see was red," said Rich
ard Biagiotti, the district chief
of West Lynn, a veteran of 29
years in the department. "The
wind was directing the fire. The
heat and the fire were building
up to such a degree they were
creating a firestorm. . . The
floors were oil-saturated from
years and years of making
leather products and shoes.
Flames jumped streets. .. "

Biagiotti gestured towards
the rubble.
"Thiswasour pride and joy,"
he said. "This was our pride
and joy in the 1890s. It wascom
ing back to be our pride and
joy. It was a city on its way
back." Now, in a city where the
Christmas decorations already
are up on some streets, there is
shock, but there is also a de
termination to rebuild.
While the ruins still smoked,
meetings were underway in
Lynn's City Hall to consider a
long-term recovery program.
"It (the fire) has acted as a
catalyst," said Edward Calnan,
the city's director of communi
ty development. "I was down
at the fire most of the time. You
didn't have the usual crowd of
thrill seekers. People were
crestfallen. They were saying
we've come so far, why did this

have to happen."
Like many of its neighbors in
New England, Lynn blossomed
in the 1800 sand withered in the
1900s. In the past 35 years, the
city lost a quarter of its popu
lation. Lynn's 80,000 residents
endured business failures and
numerous cases of commercial
arson during the last decade.
Some residents bitterly refer
to Lynn as "the arson capital of
the world."
Investigators believe an
arsonist probably started the
fire that destroyed the down
town revitalization area, but,
firemen say it will be weeks
before the cause can be pinned
down.
About 150 residents re
mained homeless, and there
will be a while before re
construction gets underway.
