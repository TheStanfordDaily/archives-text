# Food Service raises prices
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Although University Food Service
personnel say they run an efficient,
unwasteful program, students facing
this year's 10.6 percent rise in board
costs question the operation. An
ASSU task force is currently re
searching the workings of Food Ser
vice and is expected to publish a
comprehensive report early next
quarter.

News Analysis

This year students are expected to
pay more than $5.3 million in board
charges as the University Food Ser
vice tries to stay within its 1981-82
three-quarter budget of more than
$6 million. Last year, student
payments accounted for 94 percent
of the Food Service income for the
regular three quarters.
Food Service management de
fends its board charges and points to
rising food, labor, and overhead
costs as the reasons for increased
rates. "We provide a quality food ser
vice, run efficiently," said Ed Scoles,
director of housing management.
"We're not trying to provide a
simple, bare-boned food service at
the lowest possible cost."
Students pay about $7.27 a day
(based on a 19-meals/week plan) for
food. A 19-meal "A" plan costs $1673
for three quarters — $596 for fall,
$546 for winter, and $531 for spring.
According to last year's final oper
ating budget, food costs and labor
costs (including hashers, full-time
employees, maintenance workers,

secretaries, managers and their assis
tants, as well as upper-level man
agement) each accounted for ap
proximately 39 percent of income
spent.
Maxine Anderson, manager of
Food Service, said the six dorms, six
Row houses and the main office of
Food service were staffed by more
than 300 student hashers, 90 full-time
employees, seven dining unit man
agers and seven assistant managers, a
dietician and assistant manager, and
three student and four non-student
secretarial and clerical workers. In
addition, the Food Service budget In
cludes Anderson's salary as well as
partial salaries for Scoles, an energy
conservation specialist and a finan
cial analyst.
"We're not hiring any more peo
ple than we need," Anderson said.
Food Service depends on activities
during the summer to increase its in
come. Summer conferences are ex
pected to add more than $1 million to
income for 1981-82. Scoles estimated
meal costs per day for summer guests
range from $12 to $30.
Anderson said that when student
payments do not cover costs, "we try
to make it up with the summer con
ference program."
Another reason cited for the high
cost of board is the residential educa
tion philosophy that characterizes
food service. "Stanford places more
emphasis on residential education
than any other university in the coun
try, and it manifests itself in the way
we provide food service," Scoles
said. Scoles explained that dining
halls in each dorm as well as services

such as group rebates, special din
ners and meal plan choice are ex
amples of such a philosophy.
"We're not just providing a roof
over top and two or three meals a
day. We make it more than just a sur
vival component," he said.
In a June 1980 program and man
agement review of Food Service con
ducted by the Facilities and Services
Department, the self-study commit
tee said "(We are) aware of no other
college or university in the United
States which matches the residential
education program of Stanford Uni
versity. Further, while some schools
may feature specific services dif
ferent from Stanford's, none offers
the variety or depth of food service
programs provided by Stanford."
Also included in the self-study was
a Harvard University analysis of the
food services available at 12 Eastern
universities in 1979-80. While the
University's price of $1.95 per meal
(fora 19-meal/week plan) was just
under the median price of $1.97, the
three-quarter contract price of $1350
was higher than the $1280 median
price. Inaddition, lOof theotheruni
versities' prices in the comparison in
cluded more meals per week than
are offered here.
Food Service does not use rate
comparisons with other schools be
cause "it is very difficult to comment
on the rate of one school with anoth
er because you don't know how
much overhead each has," Scoles
said.
Scoles said he would never ask an
otherschool tofigure itscostssimilar-

FOOD SERVICE — Many students, who under a full board plan pay approximately $7.27 per day for food,
question how the University's Food Service spends its money.
ly to the University for comparison
purposes, and he said he would not
do it himself either.
However, one group, the ASSU
Task Force on Conservation, does
not believe that food service com
parisons between schools are mean
ingless. The 18-member task force is
looking into food awareness, waste
and costs here as well as at other
schools.
"I think it is possible to compare
(food services) but you must be very,
very careful about it," said Susan
Becker, task force member. "Look
(MlMbMFKfcoois is vital."
BecKer said that she and Council of

Presidents (COP) member Dragan
Popov visited UC-Santa Cruz yester
day in order to evaluate Santa Cruz's
food service. "The most interesting
things we found was that their 'A'
plan (19 meals/week) only cost $350
and the program is totally run by an
outside company.
"Ina lot of other ways SantaCruzis
similar to Stanford. Santa Cruz is
divided into colleges (as Stanford is
divided into dormitories), and each
college there has its own dining hall
which seats 300 to 500 people," she
said.
Food Service's cost-efficiency here
is affected by the varied sizes of din
ing halls. "The large dorms support
the smaller houses just like the wom
en's dorms used to be supported by

the men's dorms," she explained.
Anderson said food costs per meal
average about $1.39 and labor costs
about $1.30.
According tothe 1980 Food Service
review, "the units serving a small
number of students are the least effi
cient, both in food and labor costs.
Attendance at lunch runs 50 to 60
percent in the Row houses, adding to
their inefficiency." The report also
recommended the "serious con
sideration of consolidating lunch op
erations on the Row to three or four
houses."
However, Scoles said that Food
Service would probably not shut
down lunch operations this year be
cause lunch attendance this year
"was not sufficiently low."
