# US autos called noncompetitive
## 
### 
New York — A Commerce
Department report informs
Congress that the financial
troubles of the American auto
motive industry are serious,
and that major doubts exists
about its future competitive
ness.
Coming after a year (1980) in
which the industry lost more
than $4 billion, that's hardly a
new conclusion. Some people
close to the industry, like con
sultant James Harbour, have al
ready said they are watching a
horror without parallel in U.S.
industrial history.
Harbour, of Berkley, Mich.,
feels he knows something
about automotive plants, since
ho and five associates in his au
tomotive consulting firm claim
150 years experience in the in
dustry.
Based on that experience

and on studies of U.S. and
Japanese plants, Harbour de
clares the Japanese, "are mak
ing us look like two-year-olds
in how we manage plants."
During a car industry sym
posium at Stanford University
Nov. 21 he told other automo
tive analysts that "They're
stomping us into the ground."
The entire U.S. industrial base
is "going right down the
drain," he said, because Amer
ican managers fail to boost
productivity.
Harbour, a middle-level ex
ecutive at Chrysler before he
founded James Harbour and
Associates, sometimes upset
theoretical arguments with
data from his own studies:
•Japanese car makers have
average unit costs $1700 below
American manufacturers on
comparable models sold in the

United States.
•General Motors is "the
worst assembler in the United
States," averaging 31.5 hours to
assemble a Chevette. Ford
takes 28 hours for an Escort or
Lynx, and Chrysler 29 hours for
an Omni or Horizon. In Japan,
the industry average for as
sembly is just over 15 hours.
•Whereas U.S. auto workers
average 45 minutes of work for
each hour on the job, Japanese
workers average 58. Machine
"uptime" in the United States
is only 60 percent, but in Japan
it is 80 percent.
•American wages and bene
fits average $19 an hour, com
pared to $12 for the Japanese.
Unauthorized worker
absences average 6 to 8 percent
in the United States industry,
and 2percent in Japan. Author

ized relief time averages 10
percent in the United States, 5
percent in Japan.
(In other words, Harbour
said in an interview later, if
General Motors opens a plant
to employ 4000 workers it has
to hire an additional 240 men
or women to make up for the
anticipated unauthorized
absences.)
But Harbour claims labor
cost differences are still a rela
tively small factor in the cost
gap between the Japanese and
Americans. The biggest prob
lem, he says, is poor U.S. prod
uctivity, "mostly bad man
agement."
U.S. producers have failed to
institute cooperative efforts
with labor and suppliers to
boost output, cut inventories
and improve quality, he says.
