# Chavez, UFW facing problems
## 
### Washington Post 
Los Angeles — It was 1970 and the Unit
ed Farm Workers, under the guidance of
Cesar Chavez, had turned a national grape
boycott into one of the most extraordinary
labor victories in U.S. history. The union
was poised to revolutionize American ag
riculture.
Eleven years later, the growers are wax
ing triumphant while the union is in dif
ficulty. The United Farm Workers no long
er control the majority of grape contracts.
They have signed contracts in only two
states outside California.
Their central leadership has been hit by
defections, charges of mismanagement
and a growers' counterattack of increasing
force, wealth and sophistication.
The union's troubles, like its triumphs,
again throw a spotlight on Chavez, a 54-
year-old dynamo with a seventh-grade
education who still has a hold on the loyal
ties and imaginations of his admirers. His
supporters say Chavez is pushing to make
the union modern and efficient. His critics
say he is the one, because of personal para
noia, who is holding the union back.
In an interview, Chavez acknowledged
his union's political and financial prob
lems, but said his critics had made too
much of the problems and his alleged sen
sitivity to criticism. "This union is growing
quite fast, but it is true that they are not

seeing it,"he said.
Without doubt, Chavez is responsible
for fundamental improvements in the lives
of American farm workers. California rural
laborers, who earned an average of $1.40
an hour in 1965 with no fringe benefits,
earned an average of $4.51 an hour in 1980,
with many union contracts providing $6 an
hour plus health care, paid holidays and
pensions.
But that very success, forcing a rise in
wages at even non-union farms and mak
ing workers less desperate for change, has
weakened the ability of Chavez's union to
grow.
Supporters and critics of Chavez dispute
just how much he or anyone can be
blamed for the failure to organize more of
the nation's farm workers. Chris Hartmire,
Chavez' assistant, said 105,000 workers are
now covered by United Farm Workers
contracts, compared with 67,000 in 1973.
An official union report in September
says only 30,000 are "regular dues-paying
members," but Hartmire discounts that
figure, which, he says, appears to include
only members who pay dues year-round
and ignores the majority covered by sea
sonal contracts.
Whatever the membership totals are,
they are being nibbled at by decertifica
tion elections organized by clever growers
and disgruntled workers. And union lead

ers cringe at the threat of a Republican,
grower-backed replacement for the
union's most important political friend,
Gov. Jerry Brown.
"It's going to be difficult for us" if that
happens, Chavez said.
After the loss of the grape-picking con
tracts in the grower-Teamster raid of 1973,
the United Farm Workers began to or
ganize pickers of other crops. But by re
building membership in this way, the
union increased and enormously com
plicated its administrative load.
"One of the problems of growth and
success and getting contracts is that they
get an increasing load of administrative re
sponsibilities and can get overextended,"
said Herbert Perry, acting chairman of the
state Agricultural Labor Relations Board.
Meanwhile, there are the union's conti
nuing problems with the growers. Already
powerful as owners of the state's number
one industry, the growers have united into
a formidible political machine.
One experienced state politician, re
questing that his name not be used, said
that in the decade since Chavez' grape
boycott victory, "the growers have be
come first or second in the state in their ca
pacity to raise moneyandcontributetopo
litical campaigns. They can outspend the
union 20 or 30 to 1 in terms of legal talent."

er control the majority of grape contracts.
They have signed contracts in only two
states outside California.
Their central leadership has been hit by
defections, charges of mismanagement
and a growers' counterattack of increasing
force, wealth and sophistication.
The union's troubles, like its triumphs,
again throw a spotlight on Chavez, a 54-
year-old dynamo with a seventh-grade
education who still has a hold on the loyal
ties and imaginations of his admirers. His
supporters say Chavez is pushing to make
the union modern and efficient. His critics
say he is the one, because of personal para
noia, who is holding the union back.
In an interview, Chavez acknowledged
his union's political and financial prob
lems, but said his critics had made too
much of the problems and his alleged sen
sitivity to criticism. "This union is growing
quite fast, but it is true that they are not

seeing it,"he said.
Without doubt, Chavez is responsible
for fundamental improvements in the lives
of American farm workers. California rural
laborers, who earned an average of $1.40
an hour in 1965 with no fringe benefits,
earned an average of $4.51 an hour in 1980,
with many union contracts providing $6 an
hour plus health care, paid holidays and
pensions.
But that very success, forcing a rise in
wages at even non-union farms and mak
ing workers less desperate for change, has
weakened the ability of Chavez's union to
grow.
Supporters and critics of Chavez dispute
just how much he or anyone can be
blamed for the failure to organize more of
the nation's farm workers. Chris Hartmire,
Chavez' assistant, said 105,000 workers are
now covered by United Farm Workers
contracts, compared with 67,000 in 1973.
An official union report in September
says only 30,000 are "regular dues-paying
members," but Hartmire discounts that
figure, which, he says, appears to include
only members who pay dues year-round
and ignores the majority covered by sea
sonal contracts.
Whatever the membership totals are,
they are being nibbled at by decertifica
tion elections organized by clever growers
and disgruntled workers. And union lead

ers cringe at the threat of a Republican,
grower-backed replacement for the
union's most important political friend,
Gov. Jerry Brown.
"It's going to be difficult for us" if that
happens, Chavez said.
After the loss of the grape-picking con
tracts in the grower-Teamster raid of 1973,
the United Farm Workers began to or
ganize pickers of other crops. But by re
building membership in this way, the
union increased and enormously com
plicated its administrative load.
"One of the problems of growth and
success and getting contracts is that they
get an increasing load of administrative re
sponsibilities and can get overextended,"
said Herbert Perry, acting chairman of the
state Agricultural Labor Relations Board.
Meanwhile, there are the union's conti
nuing problems with the growers. Already
powerful as owners of the state's number
one industry, the growers have united into
a formidible political machine.
One experienced state politician, re
questing that his name not be used, said
that in the decade since Chavez' grape
boycott victory, "the growers have be
come first or second in the state in their ca
pacity to raise moneyandcontributetopo
litical campaigns. They can outspend the
union 20 or 30 to 1 in terms of legal talent."
