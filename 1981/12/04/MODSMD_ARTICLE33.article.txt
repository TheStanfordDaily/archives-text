Waldheim withdraws from ballot
United Nations — Kurt Waldheim withdrew his
name from the deadlocked balloting for the post of
secretary general yesterday, but his action failed to
break the month-long impasse over the top U.N. job.
His chief rival, Tanzanian Foreign Minister Salim
Salim, remained in the running for the time being for
the position that Waldheim has held since 1972.
Waldheim's move is not expected to produce the
desired avalanche of fresh contenders for considera
tion by the 15-nation Security Council because most
are believed to be reluctant to come forward as long
as Salim remains a candidate.
The secretary general's announcement followed a
request by Security Council President Olara Otunnu
of Uganda that both current candidates voluntarily
step aside for the moment. The Security Council has
been unable to reach a decision between the two in
the 16 ballots that have been taken.
Salim has not yet responded, Otunnu said.
Waldheim's announcement, which came in a letter
to the Security Council, noted the deadlock and said:
"In these circumstances and in order to facilitate
the task of the council I would ask that my name not
be included in further ballots the council may hold. I
am making this request in the greater interest of the
organization to which I remain unalterably com
mitted."
The wording of the statement led to widespread
speculation that Waldheim's move was a tactical one
and that he remains open to continue serving for an
unprecedented third term as secretary general
should no other acceptable candidate be found.
Most diplomats said Salim's position appeared to
be untenable, however, and said they felt that he too
would have to step aside for other candidates by next
week.
Many diplomats believe the council will be unable
to agree on any of the new candidates, should they
come forward, and Waldheim will end up with a two
year extension of his present term when time runs
short. Waldheim's second five-year term expires Dec.
31.
Salvadoran elections considered
Gandes, St. Lucia — The United States and several
Latin American countries are on the verge of arrang
ing the first hemispheric endorsement of the sched
uled elections in El Salvador, diplomatic sources said
last night.
The potential endorsement by the General As
sembly of the Organization of American States was a
priority subject in private meetings yesterday be
tween Secretary of State Alexander Haig and several
hemispheric foreign ministers, the sources said.
Such an expression by the OAS would bestow
greater regional and international prestige to the
elections called for next March led by Salvadoran
President Jose Duarte.
International recognition of the planned elections

is considered important to efforts to consolidate the
U.S.-backed Duarte government and to head off de
mands that political recognition and a negotiated
share of power be granted to the Salvadoran guerrilla
movement and its political arm, the Democratic Revo
lutionary Front (FDR).
Informed of the Salvadoran commander's offer to
negotiate without prior conditions, Haig said yester
day, "If he's talking about putting down his AK-47 (a
Soviet-designed weapon) and taking his chances in a
democratic election, adding that that would clearly
be a breakthrough."
Salvadoran Foreign Minister Fidel Mena reiterated
here last night that the guerrilla forces have an open
invitation to join an interparty dialogue to negotiate
the conditions for the elections. Mena carefully quali
fied the offer to include negotiations limited to the
context of the planned balloting.
The ticklish part for the resolution's backers is to
find wording that will draw the greatest support
among the 29 Latin American and Caribbean nations
meeting here, the diplomat said.
Another idea being broached privately to deal with
the volatile Central American situation is to invoke
the 1947 Rio Pact permitting hemispheric nations to
order sanctions, including armed action, in the face of
threats to territorial integrity, sovereignty or political
independence of a hemispheric signatory nation.
U.S. officials have been privately discussing the Rio
treaty as a way to give legitimacy to a potential
blockade or other military actions around Salvador,
Nicaragua or other points in the hemisphere.
Peace talks for Sinai furthered
Washington — The United States and Israel issued a
joint declaration yesterday designed to clear the way
for European participation in a peacekeeping force
for the Sinai, but Israel called on the Europeans to re
affirm that their role is based solely on the Egypt-Israel
peace treaty.
The joint statement — drafted here last week by
Secretary of State Alexander Haig and Israeli Foreign
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to head off an Israeli veto of
the European participation — was approved in
Jeruslaem yesterday by Israeli Prime Minister Men
achem Begin's cabinet.
The Israeli objection to the European participation
centered on the Europeans' comments that they
would join the peace force in keeping with the Eu
ropean Common Market's Middle East policy, which
favors an eventual negotiating role for the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
The Cabinet's action was made conditional on the
agreement of the four European governments — Brit
ain, France, Italy and the Netherlands — to "approve
their acceptance" of "principles" set forth in the joint
announcement and exercise"no derogation or reser
vation" from them.
The United States is providing up to half the men
for the Sinai force, and without the Europeans only

Colombia, Uruguay and Fiji would have helped make
the force international.
"We believe it very important for the purposes of
peace-keeping in the Sinai and for strengthening the
(Egvpt-lsrael) treaty that we have as broadly based a
peace-keeping force as possible," the senior U.S. of
ficial said.
Arms sales increase
Ankara, Turkey — Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger arrived here late yesterday night fora
highly symbolic two-day visit intended to underscore
the strategic value the United States places on its
NATO ally.
Weinberger's talks here, and his meetings earlier
yesterday in Morocco, are likely to lead to increased
U.S. arms sales to both countries.
Weinberger, on a brief tour of strategic allies along
the Mediterranean rim, defined the purpose of his
Turkish visit as "an opportunity to show the warm and
close relations that exist now between our two coun
tries."
Turkey and Greece have been the principal guard
ians of NATO's southeastern flank. But the concern of
NATO, and especially the United States, has been
drawn to Turkey since newly elected Greek Prime
Minister Andreas Papandreou voiced intention last
month of renouncing Greece's membership in the al
liance and negotiating the removal of U.S. military
bases in Greece.
Papandreou also announced he intends to begin
negotiations aimed at removing NATO nuclear weap
ons. NATO planners fear that such a move, coupled
with rising anti-nuclear sentiment in Western Europe,
could produce a chain reaction of disarmament that
would cripple NATO's strategic forces.
Earlier yesterday, however, Weinberger told re
porters, "We don't anticipate having to leave
Greece" despite Papandreou's dramatic announce
ments. "We are very hopeful that Papandreou will see
the obvious benefits of American support and of
membership in NATO."
The Reagan administration has requested $400 mil
lion for arms sales to Turkey which, if approved by
Congress, would make Turkey the third-largest reci
pient of American arms, behind Israel and Egypt.
Senate supports MX missile
Washington — The Senate salvaged a limited ver
sion of President Ronald Reagan's short-term basing
program for the MX missile yesterday and endorsed
his planned resurrection of the B-1 bomber as part of
a $208.5-billion military spending bill.
One day after voting to bar the administration from
spending any of $334 million in MX funds to reinforce
silos for the missiles, the Senate balked at taking out
all funds for interim basing.
Later, the senators rejected an amendment to de
lete $2.4 billion for the first installment of a fleet of 100
B-1 bombers. The amendment proposed to use $1.8
billion to pay for things like more soldiers and am
munition and a speed-up of the proposed Stealth

bomber of the future. The remaining $500 million
would have been a saving.
Backers of the proposal said it made more sense to
rely on the existing B-52 fleet until the radar-eluding
Stealth plane is available than to try to bridge the gap
with the B-1, which was canceled by former President
Jimmy Carter.
"We cannot afford to build two new bombers, and
any attempt to do so is likely to founder," said Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.).
Report calls Americans healthier
Washington — Nearly 75 percent of Americans who
65 can now expect to live past 75, up from 60
percent In 1940, the government said yesterday in its
annual report on the nation's health.
Life expectancy at birth has also continued to rise
with females living 77.2 years and males 69.5 years, up
from 74.7 years for females and 67.1 years for males in
1970.
"The level of health in this country is good and get
ting better," Edward Brandt, assistant secretary for
health in the Department of Health and Human Ser
vices, said at a news conference. He said rates are de
clining for nearly all major causes of death, including
heart disease and stroke, although death from cancer
in the over 50 age group is rising.
"Many of our elderly today are survivors — sur
vivors of diseases that would once have killed them —
stroke, heart disease and others," Brandt said. The in
crease in life expectancy, he said, "reflects the vir
tually unprecedented declines in mortality in the age
groups over 65 that we have been experiencing since
the late 1960'5."
Increased longevity and medical breakthroughs
have resulted in an increase in the number of people
with diabetes. Since the development of life-saving
insulin in the early 1930'5, the prevalence of diabetes
has increased six-fold in the population, as many peo
ple who otherwise would have died now survive the
illness. Some 2.4 percent of Americans have diabetes.
Stocks show small gains
New York — The stock market closed mixed yester
day in a lackluster session, but key measures managed
small gains after spending most of the day in negative
ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks,
which had been off more than 3 points earlier after a
7.61-point drop Wednesday, recovered and closed up
1.24 to 883.85.
Losers held a slim edge over gainers on the New
York Stock Exchange, with about 770 issues declining.
