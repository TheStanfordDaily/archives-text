# Penn, Furman and Loyola- Marymount to battle on the Farm
## Hoopmen host Stanford Invitational Tourney this weekend 
### Steve Odell 
The first annual Stanford Invitational Basketball Tour
nament will be held this weekend at Maples Pavilion,
with Pennsylvania tabbed the pre-tourney favorite.
The Quakers, who have racked up an 82-35 record and
three NCAA basketball play-off berths the last four years,
will do battle with the Loyola-Marymount Lions tonight
at 9 p.m. Host Stanford will tangle with Furman's Paladins
in an earlier semi-final game at 7 p.m. Tomorrow's cham
pionship game begins at 9 p.m., with the third place con
test set to begin at 7 p.m.
"We're excited about staging a tournament at Stan
ford," said Cardinal coach Dick Dißiaso. "Penn, Furman,
and Loyola-Marymount are proven major college pro
grams, which should make fora competitive two nights
of basketball for Bay Area fans."
How competitive remains to be seen, as Penn appears
to have quite an edge on the rest of the group. The
Quakers are returning four starters from last year's team,
which went 20-8 and tied for the Ivy League title with a
13-2 conference mark. The Quakes, who are coached by
Bob Weinhauer, had a 12-game winning streak in
1980-81, and ended their season when they lost to West
Virginia, 67-64 in a first round National Invitational Tour
nament game.
"Penn is a veteran team which should gain another
post-season berth this year," said Dißiaso. "Coach
Weinhauer has transformed the Quakers into an East
Coast power, a team capable of beating anyone."
The four starters returning for Weinhauer are six-foot
five junior forward Paul Little (8.8 ppg, 6.3 rbg, All-Ivy
Second Team in 1980-81), 6-5 junior forward David
Lardner (9.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg), 6-8 junior center George Noon
(9.7ppg, 5.4 rpg, 55.1 FG percent) and 6-2 senior guard
Angelo Reynolds (10.5 ppg). The other probable starter is
6-4 senior guard Fran McCaffery (1.3 ppg).
If anyone can challenge Penn, it will probably be Stan
ford. The Cardinal pounded out two opening season vic
tories last weekend, dropping U.S. International 82-70
Friday and blowing out Harvard 93-70 Sunday. These op
ponents are hardly of Penn's caliber, but Stanford made
sure their weaker foes looked that way.

6-7 freshman Johnny Rogers put on a couple of im
pressive performances in the Cardinal's opening week
end, scoring 24 points in his rookie debut Friday, and fol
lowing it up with a 14 points, 13 rebounds, and a school
record six blocked shots two nights later.
Furtherencouragement was sparked by the play of 6-8
sophomore center John Revelli, who broke loose inside
against U.S.I.U. for 27 points and 16 rebounds, both ca
reer highs. Revelli was the 1981 Pacific-10 rookie of the
Year.
Dißiaso indicated that he will start with the same line
up he used a week ago, going with Rogers and 6-7 senior
Brian Welch at forwards, Revelli at center, 6-5
sophomore Roger Lemons and 6-2 senior Doug Marty at
the guard positions.
Furman, the Cardinal's first opponent, returns nine
lettermen and five sophomores off of last year's 11-16
squad, including one of the nation's premier guards in
6-2 senior Mel Daniel.
Daniel, a 1981 honorable mention All-America and
two-time All-Southern Conference pick, averaged 22.0
points per game last year, and was a member of the gold
medal U.S. team at the 1981 World University Games.
The Paladins, who are coached by Eddie Holbrook,
will be without the services of 6-8 center George Single
ton, who fractured his right foot in the pre-season. Sin
gleton averaged 16.1 points and 10.1 reboundsa yearago
as the Southern Conference Freshman of the Year and
ranked second in NCAA blocked shots, swatting an aver
age of 3.4 balls into the stands. What a match-up he
would have made with Revelli.
Loyola-Marymount, which Stanford plays next Thurs
day (Dec. 10) in another home date, was nudged by USC
at the Sports Arena last Friday 87-75 in its 1981-82 opener.
Coach Ed Goorjian's Lions return only two players from
last year's 9-19 team which finsished sixth in the West
Coast Athletic Conference, and is probably the weakest
team in the tournament.
The player to watch on LMU is 6-3 sophomore guard
Charles Dorsey, who averaged 9.5 points per game as a
Freshman All-America Honorable Mention.

CARD HOSTS INVITE — The Stanford ♦msfcr-lbtiH twrhi will host its first Invitational tournament tonight
and tommorovv at Maples Pavilion. Shown here, last year's Pacitic-10 Rookie-of-the-Year sophomore
center John Revelli could provide the key for the Cardinal against Penn, Furman, and Loyola-Marv
mount. Stanford starts the tournament against Furman this evening at 7.
The first annual Stanford Invitational Basketball Tour
nament will be held this weekend at Maples Pavilion,
with Pennsylvania tabbed the pre-tourney favorite.
The Quakers, who have racked up an 82-35 record and
three NCAA basketball play-off berths the last four years,
will do battle with the Loyola-Marymount Lions tonight
at 9 p.m. Host Stanford will tangle with Furman's Paladins
in an earlier semi-final game at 7 p.m. Tomorrow's cham
pionship game begins at 9 p.m., with the third place con
test set to begin at 7 p.m.
"We're excited about staging a tournament at Stan
ford," said Cardinal coach Dick Dißiaso. "Penn, Furman,
and Loyola-Marymount are proven major college pro
grams, which should make fora competitive two nights
of basketball for Bay Area fans."
How competitive remains to be seen, as Penn appears
to have quite an edge on the rest of the group. The
Quakers are returning four starters from last year's team,
which went 20-8 and tied for the Ivy League title with a
13-2 conference mark. The Quakes, who are coached by
Bob Weinhauer, had a 12-game winning streak in
1980-81, and ended their season when they lost to West
Virginia, 67-64 in a first round National Invitational Tour
nament game.
"Penn is a veteran team which should gain another
post-season berth this year," said Dißiaso. "Coach
Weinhauer has transformed the Quakers into an East
Coast power, a team capable of beating anyone."
The four starters returning for Weinhauer are six-foot
five junior forward Paul Little (8.8 ppg, 6.3 rbg, All-Ivy
Second Team in 1980-81), 6-5 junior forward David
Lardner (9.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg), 6-8 junior center George Noon
(9.7ppg, 5.4 rpg, 55.1 FG percent) and 6-2 senior guard
Angelo Reynolds (10.5 ppg). The other probable starter is
6-4 senior guard Fran McCaffery (1.3 ppg).
If anyone can challenge Penn, it will probably be Stan
ford. The Cardinal pounded out two opening season vic
tories last weekend, dropping U.S. International 82-70
Friday and blowing out Harvard 93-70 Sunday. These op
ponents are hardly of Penn's caliber, but Stanford made
sure their weaker foes looked that way.

6-7 freshman Johnny Rogers put on a couple of im
pressive performances in the Cardinal's opening week
end, scoring 24 points in his rookie debut Friday, and fol
lowing it up with a 14 points, 13 rebounds, and a school
record six blocked shots two nights later.
Furtherencouragement was sparked by the play of 6-8
sophomore center John Revelli, who broke loose inside
against U.S.I.U. for 27 points and 16 rebounds, both ca
reer highs. Revelli was the 1981 Pacific-10 rookie of the
Year.
Dißiaso indicated that he will start with the same line
up he used a week ago, going with Rogers and 6-7 senior
Brian Welch at forwards, Revelli at center, 6-5
sophomore Roger Lemons and 6-2 senior Doug Marty at
the guard positions.
Furman, the Cardinal's first opponent, returns nine
lettermen and five sophomores off of last year's 11-16
squad, including one of the nation's premier guards in
6-2 senior Mel Daniel.
Daniel, a 1981 honorable mention All-America and
two-time All-Southern Conference pick, averaged 22.0
points per game last year, and was a member of the gold
medal U.S. team at the 1981 World University Games.
The Paladins, who are coached by Eddie Holbrook,
will be without the services of 6-8 center George Single
ton, who fractured his right foot in the pre-season. Sin
gleton averaged 16.1 points and 10.1 reboundsa yearago
as the Southern Conference Freshman of the Year and
ranked second in NCAA blocked shots, swatting an aver
age of 3.4 balls into the stands. What a match-up he
would have made with Revelli.
Loyola-Marymount, which Stanford plays next Thurs
day (Dec. 10) in another home date, was nudged by USC
at the Sports Arena last Friday 87-75 in its 1981-82 opener.
Coach Ed Goorjian's Lions return only two players from
last year's 9-19 team which finsished sixth in the West
Coast Athletic Conference, and is probably the weakest
team in the tournament.
The player to watch on LMU is 6-3 sophomore guard
Charles Dorsey, who averaged 9.5 points per game as a
Freshman All-America Honorable Mention.
