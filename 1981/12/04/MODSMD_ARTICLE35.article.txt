# NCAA Soccer Tournament to start in Stanford Stadium
## 
### 
The NCAA Soccer Championship
Tournament will conclude its semi
final and final rounds this weekend in
Stanford Stadium, marking the first
time the event has been held on the
Farm.
And if the finish is to be as un
predictable as preliminary action,
anything could happen. Three major
upsets have already occured in
earlier rounds and one team was dis
qualified because of an inelligible
player.
None of the Final Four teams have
ever won a national championship
though all have been contenders in
the past. Alabama A&M (16-3-2),
Philadelphia Textile (18-1-1), Fastern
Illinois (17-1-1) and the University of
Connecticut (18-3-2) comprise the
field.
Alabama's Bulldogs will meet Phil
ly's Rams at 11 a.m. in the first semi
final tomorrow followed by the
Eastern Illinois Panthers and the Con
necticut Huskies in the second game
at 1:30 p.m.
The finals will be held at 2:30 p.m.,
Sunday.
U. Conn is the only top-rated team
still in the running and is favored to
take the tournament. No.l-ranked
Indiana University — which won the
tournament two years ago — was
knocked out by Textile in the quar
terfinals. Last year's champion Uni

versity of San Francisco was upset by
San Diego State, and Eastern Illinois
toppled cross-state powerhouse SIU-
Edwardsville.
The Huskies ironically got the up
set svndrome out of their system
earlier this year across the Stanford
campus at Maloney Field. On Oct. 4,
the then No.l ranked Dogs played
untested Stanford and lost 3-0.
They're back in fine style this
weekend. Connecticut won 10 and
tied in two of its games after the Stan
ford debacle and has sailed through
the tourney so far.
Textile has dominated the Phila
delphia Soccer Seven Conference for
all three years of the organization's
existence. It lost to LaSalle this sea
son, causing a tie for the conference
title, but led by freshman star Sean
Frvatt (15 goals), Tim Killeen (12) and
1980 second team All-America Tom
McDonald (11) the Rams are on a roll
in the tourney after the Indiana up
set.
Alabama A&M, one of the newest
varsity programs in the nation, has
won the Division II championship
twice — including its 1977 inaugural
season. The Bulldogs have struggled
to make the Final Four this year in
three overtime victories (1-0 over
Duke, 2-1 over Clemson and 2-1 over
West Virginia). They are led by
freshman forward Wayne Cargill

who scored 22 goals this season.
Eastern Illinois is the dark horse of
the tourney. The Panthers reached
the Final Four on a forfeit when San
Diego State was disqualfied because
of an ineligible player, Chris Bru.
