## 
### Lisa Stern 
The NCAA board of coaches an
nounced Tuesday the 20 teams which
have advanced to regional competi
tion in women's volleyball. Stanford,
seeded sixth in the national tour
nament, will be exempt from pre
liminary qualifying rounds.
The squad will travel toTuscaloosa,
Ala. to take on the Arizona State Sun
Devils at the University of Alabama in
the first round of the Southeast Re
gional playoffs Dec.ll.
The Sun Devil spikers, coached by
Dale Flickinger, are rated No.ll in
the nation. The team is led byoutside
hitter Lisa Stock, who was recently
named All-Conference by the West
Coast Athletic Association.
The Cardinal met its opponents in
a non-conference matchup Sept.2l
at home in Maples Pavilion. Head
coach Fred Sturm's squad triumphed
over the Devils in three consecutive

games, 15-9,15-13, and 16-14.
Stanford assistant coach Don Shaw
recalled the match. "Although we
beat them in three straight, two of
the games were duece games where
we only won by two points. I didn't
feel good about that performance,"
he said.
The Cards, coming off their best
regular season performance ever un
der Sturm, will have to contend with
the height of the Arizona State girls.
"They are the tallest team in the
country," said Sturm, "but they are a
hot and cold ball club. When they are
on top of their game, they make it
very tough for their opponents."
If Stanford beats the Sun Devils it
will advance to take on the victor of
the other Southeast regional game in
the finals. That game will feature the
UCLA Bruins, rated third, against the
winner of the Purdue-Tennessee
qualifying match, which will be

played this weekend. The Purdue
squad, seeded No. 14, is the favorite
to advance in the tournament.
We can't look toward UCL A and let
Arizona State beat us," Shaw said. We
have to concentrate on preparing for
one game at a time."
The winners in each region will
travel to Los Angeles Dec. 18 to com
pete for the national crown in the
NCAA finals, to be held on the UCLA
campus that weekend. The Univer
sity if Hawaii is favored to take the ti
tle. The University of Pacific, which
captured the Northern California
Athletic Conference championship
by defeating Stanford twice this fall,
is seeded fourth and will compete in
the Northeastern Regional at North
western University.
Sturm and Shaw look for the
Cardinal to improve on blocking ef
fectiveness in practice sessions. They
will introduce a new defensive

strategy and two new offensive plays
before the team leaves for its first
contest.
"We're still going to concentrate
on the things we've done well all
year," Sturm said, "and continue to
control the game from oursideof the
net."
Shaw explained that the team has
had time to get healthy since com
pleting regular season play almost
two weeks ago. As the spikers enter
their preparation period, the assis
tant coach wants to stress mental
conditioning.
"There is a different intensity dur
ing the playoffs," he said. "If you get
too pumped up you can make mis
takes. I just want the girls to play as
well as they have all year."
Sturm comcluded optimistically. "I
believe that if we can turn in the per
formance we are capable of turning
in, we'll be very successful."
