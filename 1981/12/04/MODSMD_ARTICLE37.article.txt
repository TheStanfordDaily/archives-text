# Poloists finish perfect season
## 
### Chris Addington 
Well, what can be said after the
perfect season? What about a
team that goes 31 straight games in
a season without a loss, winds up
with seven players on the NCAA
All-Tournament teams and cur
rently holds the longest winning
streak in collegiate water polo?
Perhaps Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti summed it up best of
all. "This is a perfect season and
we hate to see it end," he said. "I
suppose the only (other) thing we
could have done this year was shut
out every opponent."
And the Cardinal came close to
doing that too.
In last weekend's NCAA cham
pionship tournament Stanford
destroyed three teams in a
Cakewalk to the national title. By
defeating the Long Beach State
49ers in the final game, Stanford
established a record for the largest
score, 17-6, and largest margin of
victory, in a championship game.
Bv winning the nationals this
season, Stanford wrapped up the
most successful four year period
any collegiate water polo team has
had in the history of the sport.
In that time, the Cardinal
amassed .In incredible 108-8-3
record, along with three national

championships and one third
place finish.
But perhaps the most significant
factor displaying the dominance
of this squad was the All-Tourney
selections made at the conclusion
of the championship event.
The Cardinal landed all seven of
its starters somewhere on the
three teams. Dominating the first
team selections were five Stanford
players with names all too familiar
to water polo fans. Senior Jody
Campbell and junior James
Bergeson (who was Stickney's
Stanford At hlete-of-t he-Month
for November) shared the tour
nament's MVP award, while sen
iors Alan Mouchawar, Chris
Kelsev and Vince Vanelli were all
first team picks.
Stanford's other two starters,
Bill Taylor and John Tanner, were
accorded second team-honorable
mention status.
"I think another tribute to this
team is the fact that four of them
have a good chance of making the
1984 Olympic team," added Det
tamanti. "Campbell, Bergeson
and Mouchawar, as well as John
Cansel (goalie, graduated), all
have excellent chance of making
the Olympic squad," he said.
The Cardinal finished the year

with some equally impressive total
statistics. Bergeson led the team in
scoring with 82 goals, followed by
Campbell with 71, Mouchawar
with 49, Kelsey with 48, Taylor with
35, Tanner with 27 and Greg Lam
bert with 26.
Stanford outscored its oppo
nents 411-165 in total goals, but
even more amazing is the fact that
they outscored the opposition
115-20 in the first period.
The logical question inspired by
.ill these impressive facts and
numbers is, "Could this be the
end of Stanford water polo domi
nance considering the number of
graduating seniors?"
Hardly. Even though the
Cardinal is losing six seniors to
graduation, the future still looks
bright in deGuerre pool.
Starters: Bergeson and Tanner
will both be back, as well as utility
man Lambert. Dettamanti also will
have the services of two excellent
redshirts in Curtis Hanst, who was
a starter at LJC-Santa Barbara, and
Kirk Jensen, who started for the
UC-Berkeley before coming to
the Farm.

goalkeeper Steve Moyer and Tom

FUTURE OLYMPIANS? — Can you pick out the future Olympic water polo team members in this

Hardly. Even though the

FUTURE OLYMPIANS? — Can you pick out the future Olympic water polo team members in this
picture? According to Stanford coach Dante Dettamanti, Alan Mouchawar (N0.7), Jody Campbell
(No.10), and lames Bergeson (N0.4) are all possiblities. These three departing seniors lea the
Cardinal, shown here, through the NCAA Championship tournament like the plague through Eu
rope last weekend in Long Beach. They won the crown by the largest margin of victory ever, 17-6
over the host team.
Well, what can be said after the
perfect season? What about a
team that goes 31 straight games in
a season without a loss, winds up
with seven players on the NCAA
All-Tournament teams and cur
rently holds the longest winning
streak in collegiate water polo?
Perhaps Stanford coach Dante
Dettamanti summed it up best of
all. "This is a perfect season and
we hate to see it end," he said. "I
suppose the only (other) thing we
could have done this year was shut
out every opponent."
And the Cardinal came close to
doing that too.
In last weekend's NCAA cham
pionship tournament Stanford
destroyed three teams in a
Cakewalk to the national title. By
defeating the Long Beach State
49ers in the final game, Stanford
established a record for the largest
score, 17-6, and largest margin of
victory, in a championship game.
Bv winning the nationals this
season, Stanford wrapped up the
most successful four year period
any collegiate water polo team has
had in the history of the sport.
In that time, the Cardinal
amassed .In incredible 108-8-3
record, along with three national

championships and one third
place finish.
But perhaps the most significant
factor displaying the dominance
of this squad was the All-Tourney
selections made at the conclusion
of the championship event.
The Cardinal landed all seven of
its starters somewhere on the
three teams. Dominating the first
team selections were five Stanford
players with names all too familiar
to water polo fans. Senior Jody
Campbell and junior James
Bergeson (who was Stickney's
Stanford At hlete-of-t he-Month
for November) shared the tour
nament's MVP award, while sen
iors Alan Mouchawar, Chris
Kelsev and Vince Vanelli were all
first team picks.
Stanford's other two starters,
Bill Taylor and John Tanner, were
accorded second team-honorable
mention status.
"I think another tribute to this
team is the fact that four of them
have a good chance of making the
1984 Olympic team," added Det
tamanti. "Campbell, Bergeson
and Mouchawar, as well as John
Cansel (goalie, graduated), all
have excellent chance of making
the Olympic squad," he said.
The Cardinal finished the year

with some equally impressive total
statistics. Bergeson led the team in
scoring with 82 goals, followed by
Campbell with 71, Mouchawar
with 49, Kelsey with 48, Taylor with
35, Tanner with 27 and Greg Lam
bert with 26.
Stanford outscored its oppo
nents 411-165 in total goals, but
even more amazing is the fact that
they outscored the opposition
115-20 in the first period.
