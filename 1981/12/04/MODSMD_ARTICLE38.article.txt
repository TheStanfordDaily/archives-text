# Cardinal matmen pin Sac. St.

The Stanford varsity wrestl
ing team won its second con
secutive match Wednesday
against a surprisingly strong
Sacramento State team by a
score of 27-14. Stanford re
mains undefeated and has al
ready surpassed last year's dual
meet record. The match
against Sacramento State was
very close until senior co-cap
tain Doug Perkins secured a
decision and put the meet out
of reach.
The only pin wasachieved by
heavy-weight freshman Ed
Katz in 1:28 seconds. Katz, a
high school state champion in

free style and Greco-Roman
wrestling, is this year's top
freshman recruit and should
add much depth to the team.
Head coach Chris Horpel was
impressed with his style.
Another highlight in the
meet came from a 150-
pounder Bruce Ruben. A Stan
ford graduate, Ruben is a first
vear student at the law school
who does not like to do things
halfway. He initially felt that he
could not put enough time into
wrestling to be successful at it,
but his desire to compete over
ruled his reasoning and he de
cided to remain on the team.
After losing 12 pounds in 24

hours in order to make weight
for the match, the dedicated
wrestler overwhelmed his op
ponent and won by a major de
cision.
The wrestling team will take
part in the annual Munnby
tournament at San Jose State
tomorrow. The tournament
will feature some of the best
wrestlers from Southern Cali
fornia and will be a good test
for the Cardinal squad to see
how they compare to highly
competitive teams.
The next home match is
against the Claremont Stags
Jan. 29.
