# Tuition to increase 15 percent
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Students here can expect to pay $8211 in tui
tion next year.
The announcement of the 15 percent increase
— the highest yearly increase ever — came dur
ing Vice President and Provost Albert Hastorf's
presentation to the Faculty Senate last night. Tui
tion this year is $7140.
The announcement was somewhat unex
pected because Hastorf usually presents the
budget forecast to the Board of Trustees before
he presents it to the senate. Hastorf made the ear
ly presentation because the first senate meeting
following the board's meeting is not until Jan. 7.
The board will hear Hastorf's projections Mon
day.
The rise is based on a 9 percent inflation rate
plus an additional 6 percent increase.
Although the University is the first of the major
private institutions nationwide to present tuition
increases, President Donald Kennedy said he
thinks it will have the smallest percentage in
crease of these institutions.
Last year's 13.6 percent increase was lower

than every Ivy League school except Dartmouth
College, which had a 13.5 percent rise. Harvard
University's tuition rose 15.4 percent; Yale Uni
versity's tuition increased 15.1 percent, while all
Ivy League schools charged tuitions near $7000
this year.
Students are concerned that the tuition in
crease will affect other University programs.
"I'm concerned that the increase may change
the University's blind admissions policy," said
Dave Phelps, ASSU Senate chair. "I also am afraid
that the increased tuition will cause many stu
dents to turn away from Stanford toward public
schools such as Berkeley or UCLA or UC-Davis."
The University is one of the few institutions
which admits students without looking at their fi
nancial situations. This blind admissions policy
may be in jeopardy if the University becomes too
dependent on tuition money, Phelps said.
Kennedy said, however, that he foresees no
change in financial aid allotments.
"We have a commitment to provide ad
missions without regard to a student's financial
situation," said Kennedy, who added that the

University is "working like hell to get costs under
control."
The president stressed that although the an
nouncement itself was unexpected, the content
was not. When the trustees set this year's budget
last March, they pointed out that next year's tui
tion would increase at the inflation rate plus 6
percent.
Hastorf's announcement was part of his long
range financial forecast, which included ex
pected budget expenses and incomes for the
next four years. According to the projection,
which will change unless inflation stays around
eight percent for the next four years, tuition will
rise 14 percent in the 1983-84 school year and 11
percent in both the 1984-85 and 1985-86 school
years.
These rises translate to tuitions of $9360 for
'83-84, $10,387 for '84-85, and $11,529 for '85-86.
The tuition increase this year came despite an
"extraordinarily effective year" in fundraising,
according to Hastorf. Although $80 million was
raised, administrators were able to use little of
the funds to defray tuition costs.
Hastorf pointed to the recent en
dowments to the humanities faculty,
which totalled $2 million, as ex
amples. The grants, which included
$1 million from the Pew Memorial
Trust and $1 million from an individ
ual gift, must be used for humanities
programs and not for tuition sub
sidization.
Reacting to expected protests
about the tuition hikes, Kennedy said
that students must realize that "all in
stitutions — from businesses to gov
ernments — are facing this problem
of inflation; Stanford is no excep
tion."
