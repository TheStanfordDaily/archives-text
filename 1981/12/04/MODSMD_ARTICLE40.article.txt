# UCLA to be put on NCAA probation, says LA Times
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Sources close to the UCLA athletic pro
gram say the NCAA has placed the school on probation
for two years and banned it from participating in the
NCAA basketball tournament next spring. The penalty
was imposed after an NCAA investigation of the athletic
program.
However, none of UCLA's teams has been banned
from appearing on television or in bowl games, the
sources said, and the basketball team is free to play in the
National Invitation Tournament next March. The NIT re
portedly has already contacted UCLA about that possi
bility.
The sources, who asked not to be identified, said the
basketball team is eligible for the 1983 NCAA basketball
tournament, during the second year of the probation.
The NCAA reported the results of its investigation
Tuesday and neither it nor the school will comment on
the findings. UCLA has the option of an appeal within 15
days after receiving the notice. The school reportedly

Hot the notice from the NCAA Monday.
The tournament ban, sources said, is the only sanction.
The second year of the probation, they said, amounts to a
reprimand.
"Judging from the fact UCLA is considering an appeal,
it's a good guess that the NCAA didn't have a whole lot,"
a source said. "Just enough."
Asked to confirm or deny the probation and ban,
Christian Smith, UCLA vice chancellor for institutional
relations, said: "Thanks for the alert, but UCLA's position
is there will be no comment until the NCAA or UCLA
makes it public. UCLA will neither confirm nor deny any
speculation."
The sources — influential alumni and Bruin boosters
— said the NCAA's allegations involved only the basket
hall and football teams. The allegations are said to be nu
merous, but nothing major. The sources indicated an ap
peal is a strong possibility, but other sources doubted
that course of action. No school has ever won a signifi
cant appeal to the NCAA.

The sources supported basketball coach Larry
Farmer's belief that the NCAA was trying to crack down
on a number of small things that happened over a
number of years, rather than one major incident.
They said two violations the NCAA cited were (1)
former basketball coach Larry Brown buying dinners for
players, and (2) an apartment for forward Tony An
derson, subsidized by an influential Bruin alumnus
whom the source wouldn't name.
Brown, who left UCLA last March after two years to
coach the New jersey Netsof the NBA, declined to com
ment.
Anderson, a senior, was suspended last week. UCLA
did not give a reason, calling it a private matter.
There was a report last season that several basketball
players received cars at a discount from a UCLA booster,
and sources said this may have been a factor in the
NCAA's findings.
The Pacific-10 already has penalized UCLA (and other
schools, for various reasons) because some players on

the 1977 football team had illegal transcripts, but Coach
Terry Donahue has said that, to the best of his knowl
edge, there are no new football charges.
Sources said there is no TV ban, at least in part because
of contractual commitments between the NCAA and the
networks.
"The NCAA wouldn't go that far," said a member of
Bruin Bench, the school's booster club.
There is some speculation that the NCAA's hesitancy
to impose television sanctions against UCLA could be re
lated to the current battle between the NCAA and the
CFA (College Football Association) over television rights
control. The two conferences remaining under NCAA
control on the television issue are the Big-10 and the
Pac-10.
The basketball team, still ranked in the Top 10 after
splitting its first two games, is scheduled for six ap
pearances on national TV, starting Saturday at Notre
Dame.

There is some speculation that the NCAA's hesitancy
to impose television sanctions against UCLA could be re
lated to the current battle between the NCAA and the
CFA (College Football Association) over television rights
control. The two conferences remaining under NCAA
control on the television issue are the Big-10 and the
Pac-10.
The basketball team, still ranked in the Top 10 after
splitting its first two games, is scheduled for six ap
pearances on national TV, starting Saturday at Notre
Dame.
