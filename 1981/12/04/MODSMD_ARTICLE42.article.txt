## 'Reasons for Moving' lacks reason 
### Cory Foster 
"What technique do you do?," they
asked me in New York.
"Well. . .1 go to school at Stanford. . ."
"Yes, but what do you take," as if I'm
supposed to be on drugs. "Graham? Cun
ningham? Louis?" It was a name they
wanted. Something they could buy.
"We get a taste of those styles. We've
taken some of them, but our teachers have
developed their own. . ."
"Oh yeah, I've heard they do that in Cal
ifornia."
California dance is like California the
state on that cover of the New Yorker. It is
smaller, less distinct, less distinguishable,
than New York dance. It is also unex
perienced by many New Yorkers, who
only know the studios down the street.
What does happen to dance that moves
from New York to California? What hap
pens to dance in the spatial and temporal
interval between coasts? Can Sara
Wilbourne, a member of Tandy Beal's
company (the same Tandy Beal who was a
member of Alwin Nikolais's company), dis
tinguish her form of dance in the eyes of
her Eastern forebears?
Wilbourne's dance lineage was bound
to come into focus in a concert of three of
her works and one of Tandy Beal's, among
others. One approaches such a concert
wondering if the style Sara has developed,
in her own way, on the West Coast, can
survive without being attached to a name.
One wants to know whether a personal
style can make a name for itself.
The title of the concert was "Reasons for
Moving." It was held at the Loudon-
Nelson Community Center in Santa Cruz
on Friday night. The auditorium was
packed to capacity with Santa Cruzers and
one carload of Palo Altans. The programs
indicated seven short dances before in
termission and Music to Dance To by the
Laurel Street Drummers after intermission.
"Reasons for Moving" sounded like it
might give some interesting viewpoints to
those of us dancers who do not necessarily
motivate themselves through one particu
lar choreographer, such as Graham or
Cunningham. In this way, a mood of in
trospection was established. It was also de
stroyed as the introductory piece began. A
clown/mime character came on stage and
did a routine with a felt bowler hat, to live
accompaniment on drums. It was lively
and funny. The choreographer, Letitia
Bartlett, was skilled at creating the illusion
of the hat being a face or of it being sucked
up to the hand. But so much for rhyme or
reason. Whatever impetus the dancers
had, they knew it already and used it, pre
sumably, to motivate themselves to dance
for the audience.
Because of its light-hearted character,
this opening could not really disappoint.

The second piece of the concert, choreo
graphed by Tandy Beal, however, proba
bly suffered from following such a theatri
cal opener. Travelogue was a pure move
ment piece, one where the governing
principles included the joy of creating de
signs in space. It had distinct influences
from Nikolais dance. In other words, much
of the development of the piece arose
from the task of carving more intricate de
signs in space; from demonstrating timing
variations; from freezing certain body
shapes, and contrasting these with con
tinuous motion. These four elements of
time, shape, space, and motion are in
variably found in a Nikolais lecture-dem
onstration. Certainly, Tandy Beal's
heritage as a Nikolais dancer is apparent in
this choreography. But distance seems to
have put some wear and tear on the
Nikolais concepts.
First of all, Travelogue was originally a
duet. It had been re-worked for four dan
cers for this dance concert, and at times
the stage seemed crowded. Each of the
four dancers had a unique quality of
movement, making uniformity difficult.
This in turn made contrasts unclear. Also,
without the complex environments
Nikolais creates for his dances, the theme
development appeared simple and some
times ended up boring. Its placement after
the mime piece, too, left the audience un
prepared for the enjoyment of motion and
design for their own sake. So, program
ming diminished whatever merits Trav
elogue had.
Three of the other pieces were choreo
graphed by Sara Wilbourne. They all con
tained some obvious Nikolais, as well as
other influences. In two of her pieces, A
Recurring Landscape and Surviving the
Moment, she accompanied herself with
monologue. The third piece, Prom Night,
depicted a young woman interacting with
a mattress. The movement style of each of
these pieces was unremarkable. Develop
ment went according to basic principles of
varying intensity and complexity of
phrases, and with unremarkable move
ments remarkable development is dif
ficult. But, clearly, some of the problems
Wilbourne set herself in creating the
dances derive from Nikolais', and proba
bly Tandy Beal's, concepts of dance. As for
the other influences on her dances, it
seems she turned to exercises from the
performance art style. Prom Night might
have been her answer to a problem of how
to use a mattress as a prop in as many ways
as possible.
Unfortunately, when mattress meets
young woman in living room setting (girl
dressed in white formal, circa 1961), the
mattress becomes infused with meaning
and pure prop manipulation gives way to
worn Mlt cliche. The piece of dance be

ttfflMHi vaudeville drama. The same kind
of error came up in her vocally accom
panied pieces. Even though the words she
used might' have come from her private
journal, somehow they were trivial. And
her dance had no choice but to respond in
kind to the accompaniment.
It looks as though there is a deficiency in
California dance. It stems from a dancer
mixing several styles together and calling it
personal style.
Even within the context of the one pro
gram, on Friday night, there was so much
diversity in choreography, that there was
only one thing certain. That was that
coherence was not an aim of this per
formance.
Ordinarily, a concert with pieces as thin
as these tended to be would be guilty of
disrespecting its audience. The dances can
insult the intelligence of the viewers.
Somehow, though, "Reasons for Moving"
did not have this flaw, and that saved it
from being deadly dull. Once the au
dience arrived and settle into chairs in the
auditorium, the homey atmosphere took
over. The whole attitude was "look what
we're up to, we just want to show you
what's going on, we want to know what
you think of our ideas." Sara Wilbourne
was not dishing up a particular cuisine or
dance, (i.e./'Graham," "Louis," "Evans.")
Rather, she was engaging us in conversa
tion, that we might not mind the meal.
Well, it's nice to be treated with respect as
an audience, even if the fare falls short of
expectations. It's nice to realize that a
dancer does not need to be associated
with a style of dance before an idea can be
enacted.
Letitia Bartlett's other piece, Amelia
Earhart, exemplifies a good idea that came
about, probably just because it was not re
stricted by a particular style. It contained
many approaches to a kind of tribute to the
woman aviator. The piece included narra
tion, a Blondie song, a puppet, and a
flashlight. The most striking section was
the dance Ms. Bartlett evoked from, sim
ply, light on a screen and shadows of her
hands. She felt free to include drama,
dance, and mime in one choreography.
Otherwise none of it could have come
about as it did.
Eager audiences are looking for new
ideas, as was evidenced by the attentive
Santa Cruz audience. A polished style can
lead to whole new directions in dance. The
Santa Cruz concert was not quite there,
but they had taken the first step, which was
to get something happening; to provide a
forum for themselves, so that they might
perfect what they are doing.
Someday, some of these California dan
cers may be among the names New
Yorkers ask for.
"What technique do you do?," they
asked me in New York.
"Well. . .1 go to school at Stanford. . ."
"Yes, but what do you take," as if I'm

cers may be among the names New
Yorkers ask for.
"What technique do you do?," they
asked me in New York.
"Well. . .1 go to school at Stanford. . ."
"Yes, but what do you take," as if I'm
supposed to be on drugs. "Graham? Cun
ningham? Louis?" It was a name they
wanted. Something they could buy.
"We get a taste of those styles. We've
taken some of them, but our teachers have
developed their own. . ."
"Oh yeah, I've heard they do that in Cal
ifornia."
California dance is like California the
state on that cover of the New Yorker. It is
smaller, less distinct, less distinguishable,
than New York dance. It is also unex
perienced by many New Yorkers, who
only know the studios down the street.
What does happen to dance that moves
from New York to California? What hap
pens to dance in the spatial and temporal
interval between coasts? Can Sara
Wilbourne, a member of Tandy Beal's
company (the same Tandy Beal who was a
member of Alwin Nikolais's company), dis
tinguish her form of dance in the eyes of
her Eastern forebears?
Wilbourne's dance lineage was bound
to come into focus in a concert of three of
her works and one of Tandy Beal's, among
others. One approaches such a concert
wondering if the style Sara has developed,
in her own way, on the West Coast, can
survive without being attached to a name.
One wants to know whether a personal
style can make a name for itself.
The title of the concert was "Reasons for
Moving." It was held at the Loudon-
Nelson Community Center in Santa Cruz
on Friday night. The auditorium was
packed to capacity with Santa Cruzers and
one carload of Palo Altans. The programs
indicated seven short dances before in
termission and Music to Dance To by the
Laurel Street Drummers after intermission.
"Reasons for Moving" sounded like it
might give some interesting viewpoints to
those of us dancers who do not necessarily
motivate themselves through one particu
lar choreographer, such as Graham or
Cunningham. In this way, a mood of in
trospection was established. It was also de
stroyed as the introductory piece began. A
clown/mime character came on stage and
did a routine with a felt bowler hat, to live
accompaniment on drums. It was lively
and funny. The choreographer, Letitia
Bartlett, was skilled at creating the illusion
of the hat being a face or of it being sucked
up to the hand. But so much for rhyme or
reason. Whatever impetus the dancers
had, they knew it already and used it, pre
sumably, to motivate themselves to dance
for the audience.
Because of its light-hearted character,
this opening could not really disappoint.

The second piece of the concert, choreo
graphed by Tandy Beal, however, proba
bly suffered from following such a theatri
cal opener. Travelogue was a pure move
ment piece, one where the governing
principles included the joy of creating de
signs in space. It had distinct influences
from Nikolais dance. In other words, much
of the development of the piece arose
from the task of carving more intricate de
signs in space; from demonstrating timing
variations; from freezing certain body
shapes, and contrasting these with con
tinuous motion. These four elements of
time, shape, space, and motion are in
variably found in a Nikolais lecture-dem
onstration. Certainly, Tandy Beal's
heritage as a Nikolais dancer is apparent in
this choreography. But distance seems to
have put some wear and tear on the
Nikolais concepts.
First of all, Travelogue was originally a
duet. It had been re-worked for four dan
cers for this dance concert, and at times
the stage seemed crowded. Each of the
four dancers had a unique quality of
movement, making uniformity difficult.
This in turn made contrasts unclear. Also,
without the complex environments
Nikolais creates for his dances, the theme
development appeared simple and some
times ended up boring. Its placement after
the mime piece, too, left the audience un
prepared for the enjoyment of motion and
design for their own sake. So, program
ming diminished whatever merits Trav
elogue had.
Three of the other pieces were choreo
graphed by Sara Wilbourne. They all con
tained some obvious Nikolais, as well as
other influences. In two of her pieces, A
Recurring Landscape and Surviving the
Moment, she accompanied herself with
monologue. The third piece, Prom Night,
depicted a young woman interacting with
a mattress. The movement style of each of
these pieces was unremarkable. Develop
ment went according to basic principles of
varying intensity and complexity of
phrases, and with unremarkable move
ments remarkable development is dif
ficult. But, clearly, some of the problems
Wilbourne set herself in creating the
dances derive from Nikolais', and proba
bly Tandy Beal's, concepts of dance. As for
the other influences on her dances, it
seems she turned to exercises from the
performance art style. Prom Night might
have been her answer to a problem of how
to use a mattress as a prop in as many ways
as possible.
Unfortunately, when mattress meets
young woman in living room setting (girl
dressed in white formal, circa 1961), the
mattress becomes infused with meaning
and pure prop manipulation gives way to
worn Mlt cliche. The piece of dance be

ttfflMHi vaudeville drama. The same kind
of error came up in her vocally accom
panied pieces. Even though the words she
used might' have come from her private
journal, somehow they were trivial. And
her dance had no choice but to respond in
kind to the accompaniment.
It looks as though there is a deficiency in
California dance. It stems from a dancer
mixing several styles together and calling it
personal style.
Even within the context of the one pro
gram, on Friday night, there was so much
diversity in choreography, that there was
only one thing certain. That was that
coherence was not an aim of this per
formance.
Ordinarily, a concert with pieces as thin
as these tended to be would be guilty of
disrespecting its audience. The dances can
insult the intelligence of the viewers.
Somehow, though, "Reasons for Moving"
did not have this flaw, and that saved it
from being deadly dull. Once the au
dience arrived and settle into chairs in the
auditorium, the homey atmosphere took
over. The whole attitude was "look what
we're up to, we just want to show you
what's going on, we want to know what
you think of our ideas." Sara Wilbourne
was not dishing up a particular cuisine or
dance, (i.e./'Graham," "Louis," "Evans.")
Rather, she was engaging us in conversa
tion, that we might not mind the meal.
Well, it's nice to be treated with respect as
an audience, even if the fare falls short of
expectations. It's nice to realize that a
dancer does not need to be associated
with a style of dance before an idea can be
enacted.
Letitia Bartlett's other piece, Amelia
Earhart, exemplifies a good idea that came
about, probably just because it was not re
stricted by a particular style. It contained
many approaches to a kind of tribute to the
woman aviator. The piece included narra
tion, a Blondie song, a puppet, and a
flashlight. The most striking section was
the dance Ms. Bartlett evoked from, sim
ply, light on a screen and shadows of her
hands. She felt free to include drama,
dance, and mime in one choreography.
Otherwise none of it could have come
about as it did.
Eager audiences are looking for new
ideas, as was evidenced by the attentive
Santa Cruz audience. A polished style can
lead to whole new directions in dance. The
Santa Cruz concert was not quite there,
but they had taken the first step, which was
to get something happening; to provide a
forum for themselves, so that they might
perfect what they are doing.

Someday, some of these California dan
cers may be among the names New
Yorkers ask for.
"What technique do you do?," they
asked me in New York.
"Well. . .1 go to school at Stanford. . ."
"Yes, but what do you take," as if I'm
supposed to be on drugs. "Graham? Cun
ningham? Louis?" It was a name they
wanted. Something they could buy.
"We get a taste of those styles. We've
taken some of them, but our teachers have
developed their own. . ."
"Oh yeah, I've heard they do that in Cal
ifornia."
California dance is like California the
state on that cover of the New Yorker. It is
smaller, less distinct, less distinguishable,
than New York dance. It is also unex
perienced by many New Yorkers, who
only know the studios down the street.
What does happen to dance that moves
from New York to California? What hap
pens to dance in the spatial and temporal
interval between coasts? Can Sara
Wilbourne, a member of Tandy Beal's
company (the same Tandy Beal who was a
member of Alwin Nikolais's company), dis
tinguish her form of dance in the eyes of
her Eastern forebears?
Wilbourne's dance lineage was bound
to come into focus in a concert of three of
her works and one of Tandy Beal's, among
others. One approaches such a concert
wondering if the style Sara has developed,
in her own way, on the West Coast, can
survive without being attached to a name.
One wants to know whether a personal
style can make a name for itself.
The title of the concert was "Reasons for
Moving." It was held at the Loudon-
Nelson Community Center in Santa Cruz
on Friday night. The auditorium was
packed to capacity with Santa Cruzers and
one carload of Palo Altans. The programs
indicated seven short dances before in
termission and Music to Dance To by the
Laurel Street Drummers after intermission.
"Reasons for Moving" sounded like it
might give some interesting viewpoints to
those of us dancers who do not necessarily
motivate themselves through one particu
lar choreographer, such as Graham or
Cunningham. In this way, a mood of in
trospection was established. It was also de
stroyed as the introductory piece began. A
clown/mime character came on stage and
did a routine with a felt bowler hat, to live
accompaniment on drums. It was lively
and funny. The choreographer, Letitia
Bartlett, was skilled at creating the illusion
of the hat being a face or of it being sucked
up to the hand. But so much for rhyme or
reason. Whatever impetus the dancers
had, they knew it already and used it, pre
sumably, to motivate themselves to dance
for the audience.
Because of its light-hearted character,
this opening could not really disappoint.

The second piece of the concert, choreo
graphed by Tandy Beal, however, proba
bly suffered from following such a theatri
cal opener. Travelogue was a pure move
ment piece, one where the governing
principles included the joy of creating de
signs in space. It had distinct influences
from Nikolais dance. In other words, much
of the development of the piece arose
from the task of carving more intricate de
signs in space; from demonstrating timing
variations; from freezing certain body
shapes, and contrasting these with con
tinuous motion. These four elements of
time, shape, space, and motion are in
variably found in a Nikolais lecture-dem
onstration. Certainly, Tandy Beal's
heritage as a Nikolais dancer is apparent in
this choreography. But distance seems to
have put some wear and tear on the
Nikolais concepts.
First of all, Travelogue was originally a
duet. It had been re-worked for four dan
cers for this dance concert, and at times
the stage seemed crowded. Each of the
four dancers had a unique quality of
movement, making uniformity difficult.
This in turn made contrasts unclear. Also,
without the complex environments
Nikolais creates for his dances, the theme
development appeared simple and some
times ended up boring. Its placement after
the mime piece, too, left the audience un
prepared for the enjoyment of motion and
design for their own sake. So, program
ming diminished whatever merits Trav
elogue had.
Three of the other pieces were choreo
graphed by Sara Wilbourne. They all con
tained some obvious Nikolais, as well as
other influences. In two of her pieces, A
Recurring Landscape and Surviving the
Moment, she accompanied herself with
monologue. The third piece, Prom Night,
depicted a young woman interacting with
a mattress. The movement style of each of
these pieces was unremarkable. Develop
ment went according to basic principles of
varying intensity and complexity of
phrases, and with unremarkable move
ments remarkable development is dif
ficult. But, clearly, some of the problems
Wilbourne set herself in creating the
dances derive from Nikolais', and proba
bly Tandy Beal's, concepts of dance. As for
the other influences on her dances, it
seems she turned to exercises from the
performance art style. Prom Night might
have been her answer to a problem of how
to use a mattress as a prop in as many ways
as possible.
Unfortunately, when mattress meets
young woman in living room setting (girl
dressed in white formal, circa 1961), the
mattress becomes infused with meaning
and pure prop manipulation gives way to
worn Mlt cliche. The piece of dance be

ttfflMHi vaudeville drama. The same kind
of error came up in her vocally accom
panied pieces. Even though the words she
used might' have come from her private
journal, somehow they were trivial. And
her dance had no choice but to respond in
kind to the accompaniment.
It looks as though there is a deficiency in
California dance. It stems from a dancer
mixing several styles together and calling it
personal style.
Even within the context of the one pro
gram, on Friday night, there was so much
diversity in choreography, that there was
only one thing certain. That was that
coherence was not an aim of this per
formance.
Ordinarily, a concert with pieces as thin
as these tended to be would be guilty of
disrespecting its audience. The dances can
insult the intelligence of the viewers.
Somehow, though, "Reasons for Moving"
did not have this flaw, and that saved it
from being deadly dull. Once the au
dience arrived and settle into chairs in the
auditorium, the homey atmosphere took
over. The whole attitude was "look what
we're up to, we just want to show you
what's going on, we want to know what
you think of our ideas." Sara Wilbourne
was not dishing up a particular cuisine or
dance, (i.e./'Graham," "Louis," "Evans.")
Rather, she was engaging us in conversa
tion, that we might not mind the meal.
Well, it's nice to be treated with respect as
an audience, even if the fare falls short of
expectations. It's nice to realize that a
dancer does not need to be associated
with a style of dance before an idea can be
enacted.
Letitia Bartlett's other piece, Amelia
Earhart, exemplifies a good idea that came
about, probably just because it was not re
stricted by a particular style. It contained
many approaches to a kind of tribute to the
woman aviator. The piece included narra
tion, a Blondie song, a puppet, and a
flashlight. The most striking section was
the dance Ms. Bartlett evoked from, sim
ply, light on a screen and shadows of her
hands. She felt free to include drama,
dance, and mime in one choreography.
Otherwise none of it could have come
about as it did.
Eager audiences are looking for new
ideas, as was evidenced by the attentive
Santa Cruz audience. A polished style can
lead to whole new directions in dance. The
Santa Cruz concert was not quite there,
but they had taken the first step, which was
to get something happening; to provide a
forum for themselves, so that they might
perfect what they are doing.
Someday, some of these California dan
cers may be among the names New
Yorkers ask for.
