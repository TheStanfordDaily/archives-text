# So Journey really is good?

Maybe it's an attitude
thing, either mine or theirs,
but journey didn't give the
show I'd come expecting to
see. They weren't the scowl
ing tough guys of their pub
licity pictures or the ego
maniacs who got fired early
on in their tour as an open
ing act for the Rolling
Stones (where Steve Perry
came out and yelled to a
Philadelphia crowd, "Thank
you for making Journey the
number one band in Ameri
ca,"and got pelted with
cups and bottles by an au
dience apparently com
posed of Stones fans). What
they were was... well, very
entertaining.
Journey started off right
by having an opening act
that did much better for
them than they did for the
Stones. The guys in Lover
boy were loose; they were
enthusiastic, and they never
claimed to be the most pop
ular band in the country. By
the time they took their set
out with "Turn Me Loose"
and"The Kid is HotTonite,"
they had the crowd behav
ing as if the main act had just
left. Taking seriously their
obligation to "warm up"
Journey's audience they
then closed their encore
with an overlong, in
dulgent, and very well-re
ceived number in which
they broke the audience
into competing halves fora
noise contest.
Before they even showed
up, Journey played on their
native son appeal, as their
announcer led about half of
the 49er players onto the
stage fora bow, and once
the band arrived, Perry's
first comment was "It's
good to be home." From
the start it was Perry's show
and he did well by it, spin
ning and sprinting to all
parts of the stage with a cor

dless microphone and mak
ing a point to work with the
crowd. Breaking the group's
projected image as virile,
"bitchin' " rockers, he took
the much more appealing
option of running on with a
smile and looking like he
was having a great time.
A highlighted supporting
player was pianist Jonathan
Cain, who got the op
portunity to starkly contrast
the everybody-plays-their
loudest style of most of the
songs with a solo introduc
tion to "Who's Crying
Now." His playing and Per
ry's vocals were also the key
points to a rendition of a
ballad they wrote for Heavy
Metal that I like very much.
The vocals had a problem
after a time, though, in that
Perry's thick, whiny voice
didn't make it through their
sound system in a condition
to be understood (unlike
Loverboy's vocals, which
were always clear). Un
doubtedly most of the au
dience knew the lyrics well
enough that they were men
tally interjecting them any
way, but for the casual fan it
was more a night to take in
mood, rather than brilliant
craftmanship. With the ex
ception of this lack of clari
ty, though, the acoustics in
the Cow Palace were very
good, with no feedback or
distortion problems.
The concert probably
worked best as a product of
Perry's ebullient and very
friendly mood anyway, as
the lyrics to most of their
songs aren't anything you'd
want to pin up on your wall.
A possible exception to this
was a cut off of their new Es
cape album called "Mother,
Father," which was dramatic
and compelling enough to
makemewish I knewwhatit
said.
Journey also had its share
of technical showmanship,
possibly the most im
pressive of which was the
early fireworks display
which was surprising and
flashy enough that it was
probably worth the ten

minute coughing fit that
most everyone near the
stage got just after it ended.
They ended the concert
with a nifty little video cur
tain call which let you know
that this performance
wasn't the first time they'd
done it and which likely
gave them just enough time
to get to their cars in back
before we all caught on that
the show was over and left.
It's tough to seriously
criticize a band that tries
their best to give the au
dience a good time, and
Journey certainly was doing
that. Their effort and vitality
was even enough to make
one overlook that they
thanked the audience for
making Escape "the number
one album in America."
Heck, at least they were the
main attraction this time.
