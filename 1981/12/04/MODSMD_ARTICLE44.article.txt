When the punk/new wave
movement invaded America, it
was looked upon with disgust,
despair and disdain. For many,
this new music was antithetical
to the rock and roll of the 50s
and 60s. For many, this new
"British Invasion" lacked the
quality of music that the 60s
British Invasion had inspired.
Thus, this new radical type of
music couldn't compare to any
of the classic 60's rock groups.
However, as with almost ev
ery strange and radical type of
social culture, the trends
toward mass acceptability and
commercialism soon followed.
Soon people were "liking" this
new style of music because af
ter the first initiation to this
music, these people were re
alizing how much of the new
wave music wasessentially a re
tread of much of the 60's rock
and roll. After all, wasn't The

Who the first punk band? After
all, didn'tthe Ramonestry their
hand at their own "A Hard
Day's Night" by starring in
"Rock-n-Roll High School?"
After all, didn't Patti Smith sing
and act like Mick Jagger? After
all, were most of the punk
bands even half as weird asThe
Doors?
Therefore, as this "new
wave" was slowly growing in its
acceptance, it was also destroy
ing the initial point of its revolt
ing nature. By becoming co
opted into the mainstream,
punk and new wave lost its
sense of radical purpose and
just became another facet of
music trying to dent the Top 40.
Above all though, the whole
movement was swept into the
mainstream by those groups
that gained such a following so
as to give it gold and platinum
sales status. And the biggest
group to do so was Blondie.
Blondie was one of the ori
ginal bands that led the mid
70's New York punk move
ment. Along with Talking
Heads, the Ramones, the New

York Dolls, Television and Patti
Smith, Blondie helped to for
mulate and define the new
wave movement. However, in
its gaining of mass public ac
ceptance, the original punk at
titude of the group could no

longer hold true. Blondie itself
had been co-opted into the
Top 40. It could not carry out an
existence without discarding
many of its punk ethics for the
more established "rules" of the
music industry.

Of course, this enabled
Blondie to capture the public's
fancy and permitted them to
come up with four number one
singles. This then put Blondie
in the suitable position to re
lease a Best of Blondie collec
tion, thus becoming the first
punk/new wave band to do so.
(This, of course, is another co
option intothe mainstream; no
person connected with the
punk movement five years ago
would have imagined that a
new wave group would ever be
in a position to release a
greatest hits package, since
new wave punk was supposed
ly not categorized into estab
lished musical formats).
But the album has been re
leased and this is supposed to
be a review of that album.
Therefore, I will dwell on the
quality of the music, rather
than whether it is good "punk"
or a "sellout." After all, music is
music and if the music is to be
put down for being a "sellout,"
then almost every group could
be criticized for selling out
(The Beatles with their cute

suits; The Rolling Stones for
Altamont; Rod Steward be
coming discofied, etc.).
On its own terms then, the
album is a great party record
and one that is very uptempo.
As a group, Blondie has a vast
range of diverse material that
incorporates rock, disco, new
wave, reggae, and 60s girl
groups. The album's first track
is "Heart of Glass," which com
bined the rock, disco and punk
of the late 7O's, and in doing so
established Blondie as the top
selling new wave group. From
there on we get the whole
range of Blondie's musical vari
ety; from the early Kinks/Who
derived "Dreaming" and "One
Way Or Another," to the 60s
bubblegum music parodies of
"In The Flesh" and "Sunday
Girl," (the bubblegum classic
by The Silkers); from the reg
gae rock of "The Tide is High,"
to the rap-rock of "Rapture"
(This song incidentally got a lot
of negative criticism but for
some reason I like its humor
ous look at the rap-style of mu
sic. Although it's not Kurtis

Blow, that's the breaks).
The key to the music,
though, is not Deborah Harry.
She sounds too meek and too
forced at numerous times. She
cannot evoke the sexual aura
like Chrissie Hynde or even Pat
Benatar. Only on "Rip Her to
Shreds" does the sexy tough
girl image of Harry dominate
the song.
The key therefore is the
group itself, the musicians that
empowered Blondie to rise
above the rest of the N.Y.
Bowerv bar bands. The kinetic
drumming of Ciem Burke
along with the 60s style guitar
work of Chris Stein account for
the group's full sound and the
group's eclectism. The band
that backs Debbie Harry is the
source that enables the band to
succeed in carrying out the
group's solid harmonies and
danceable sound. Therefore, if
you get this album remember
that Blondie is a group and that
it is this group that sets the pace
for the great tunes you'll be
dancing to upon hearing the
album.
