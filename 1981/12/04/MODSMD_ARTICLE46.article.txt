The Hour of Our Death
By Phillippe Aries
Alfred A. Knopf
$20.00, 614 pp.
In the 18th century a certain Mme. de
Rhert, sensing that her death was near, ar
ranged her own funeral: she had her house
draped in black, and had masses said ahead
without her feeling the least bit sick. When
she had finished giving all the necessary or
ders to spare her husband from having to do
so, she died on the hour and day she had in
dicated.
In our century such behavior would be
considered eccentric — not so in the 18th,
according to Philippe Aries, a distinguished
French historian whose magnum opus, The
Hour of Our Death, has recently appeared in
English.
Although such clairvoyance was not given
to everyone, writes Aries, this acceptance of
death was not uncommon from the Middle
Ages through the 19th century.
Death was very much a part of life. It was a
spectacle in which the person about to die
played the leading part from the death-bed
scene up to the burial which took place as
often as not right among the living.
One of the mistakes of our society, Aries
believes, is that we haverejected death. Not
only are people not allowed to die when
their time has come — their death pro
longed through artificial means — but their
bodies are quickly removed from sight.
There is an inherent contradiction in our
attitudes toward death. On the one hand the
bereaved are objects of exclusion; there is a
belief that a public demonstration of mourn
ing, as well as its prolonged and involved
private expression, is inherently morbid. On
the other there is the insistence of psy
chologists, starting with Freud and Karl
Abraham,that mourning is a necessary and
healthy reaction.
The psychologist's view of mourning and
its role "is exactly the opposite of the at
titude of society. Society regards mourning
as morbid, whereas for the psychologists it is
the repression of mourning that is morbid
and pathological," writes Aries.
According to Aries not only is there a con
tradiction, but psychologists are plain wrong
when they claim grief to be a natural reac
tion. The insistence that the bereaved must
become accustomed to the absence of the
"other" — a jargon term which refers to the
person lost — and must internalize the fact is
not a timeless truth of human nature, as psy

chologists would have it, but a creation of a
change in human sensibility that occurred
sometime in the 18th century.
It is not that the death of a wife or a close
friend went unregretted in earlier times,
writes Aries, but that affectivity simply did
not play such a large role. It was not unusual
fora widower to remarry within a few
months. He had not forgotten but his grief
was quickly assuaged.
The claim here is not just that people had
different reactions but that they felt dif
ferently. And it is with statements like this
that someone unfamiliar with contemporary
French thought is likely to run into dif
ficulties.
It is easy to accept changes in cultural prac
tices, but do we want to say that subjective
aspects of experience change in the same
way?
If we admit human nature to be relative we
may very well be sliding down the slippery
slope of cultural relativism that does not al
low us to judge and evaluate historical
events. If relativism were true, events have to
be judged on their own terms. So, relativism
could lead us to all sorts of absurdities. We
would be unabletocallslaveryevilforexam
ple, or call one historical period more en
lightened then another.
All historians divide history into periods,
but none do like the French. The French
don't just talk about the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance but about "discourse" — what
is said and written at a particular time — and
historical "breaks" and "ruptures," in the
lingo of an all-encompassing structuralist
philosophy.
Aries is completely unimpressed by
modern-day cultural evolutionism. The de
bate over the effects of the genetic on the
cultural in evolution — the battle being
waged between sociobiologists and more
moderate interactionists — does not interest
him in the least.
"I am not interested at all in this com
parison," Aries said about the comparison
between biological and cultural evolution in
an interview with the Daily during his brief
visit as a guest of the History Department
here last month. "I have a structural view of
phenomena which must be extracted from
sources and documents and not at all by sug
gestions of a philosophical system . . . cul
tural change is not a linear and deterministic
change."
To many French intellectuals, and Aries is
one of them, periods in history are not just a
convenient way of organizing facts but have

an existence of their own.
The individual who comes closest to this
approach in the analytic tradition of Ameri
can and British philosophy is Thomas Kuhn,
who introduced the word "paradigm" into
the philosophy of science. A "paradigm" —
a word that has become a catch-all for social
scientists as well as historians — can be
roughly equated with the structuralists' "dis
course" and with Aries' stages in our at
titudes toward death.
Aries distinguishes between five different
and self-contained periods of Western cul
ture in social attitudes toward death. These
are not equivalent to our ordinary notion of
historical periods such as the Renaissance, or
Middle Ages. Rather, like paradigms they
can be thought of as the frames of reference
or models with which people view the world
—■ frames that consist of anything from in
stitutions to individual habits.
In reference to "Renaissance" and

"Middle Ages" Aries' periods — or
"models" as he calls them — are specific to
his subject matter, can coexist within the
time period and are highly mentalistic.
Aries' book is complex and difficult to fol
low, but like the books of Michel Foucault —
he is very close in his approach to this French
structuralist philosopher — it is full of col
orful detail. Aries uses broad range of evi
dence for his thesis: anything from demo
graphics, wills, inscriptions on tombstones,
statuary in cemetries and personal diaries as
well as novels of Charlotte Bronte. The Hour
of Our Death is the kind of book that can be

read almost at random — opening it at any
page is likely to reveal a fascinating though
perhaps often obscure fact. Reading it from
cover to cover, however, may be tough.
The best guides to the book may be the
short conclusion at the end along with schol
arly reviews in The New York Review of
Books (Oct. 12,1978) and a more recent one
in Psychology Today (March 1981) written by
Stanford's own History Prof. Paul Robinson.
(It is these sources, especially Paul Rob
inson's review, that made the following short
summary possible.)
Aries calls his first model "tame death." It
originated somewhere in the Middle Ages
and though elements of it still persist to the
present day, this way of treating death as a
part of life has been largely replaced by the
contemporary "medicalized" view.
The second model is associated with the
late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aries
calls this "death of the self." It is in this peri
od that there was a rise in individualism and a
greater concern with the pleasures and
possessions of this world which brought
along with it a terror of death previosly un
known.
Aries' third model — that of the 17th and
18th centuries — is more difficult to under
stand. Aries calls this "remote and imminent
death." In this period science begins to dis
tance death but also transforms the dead
person into a fetish.
The fourth model was brought by the ro
manticism of the 19th century. Aries calls this
"the death of the other" or "the beautiful
death." This is the "easeful death" with
which John Keats was "half in love" and the
death discussed extensively by Susan Sontag
in her Illness as Metaphor.
The final and fith model brings us to the
present with "medicalized" death —death
which modern medicine and science tries to
deny.
Whatseems rather unsatisfying isthat both
Aries and Foucault are satisfied in asking the
"what" of history rather then asking the
more complex questions of "how" and
"why."
"I am not sure that historians can explain
the motor of history," Aries told the Daily.
"It is not good to try to find a key to open the
doors" of the "hows" in history. This is the
difference between Aries and Marxist his
torians. "I have no key," Aries said.
"lam not really a historian of death," Aries
told the Daily, " I am interested in attitudes
toward death no more then attitudes toward
sexuality and the family.

Aries is concerned with what he calls"the
sphere of subjectivity" which sounds very
much like a variant of the Jungian idea of the
collective subconscious. The sphere of sub
jectivity is, Aries explained, "all that is not
said, all that is unconscious or non-conscious
plus all the attitudes too familiar to be per
ceived, ones that are deeply internalized."
The modern attitudes toward death are
seen by Aries as an instance of what he views
as an excessive privatization of life.
"The excess of privacy is a bad thing be
cause it closes man in a tomb, a ghetto,"
Aries said, "In the traditional society there
was no distinction between the private and
the public space, they were mixed. Perhaps
the only private space was the bed . .

One of the mistakes of
our society, Aries be
lieves, is that we have re
jected death. Society re
gards mourning as
morbid, whereas for the
psychologists it is the re
pression of mourning
that is morbid and
pathological.

Since then this community space has been
replaced by three spaces: the private, the
professional and the public. Institutions such
as the club or cafe are disappearing from the
scene.
Aries is quite open about his nostalgia for
the cafe and his hatred for the family, which
he says has "imprisoned" man — women in
cluded.
"Man has imprisoned himself by the im
possibility in the modern world to have a
private life outside the family and to have a
public sociability," Aries said.

found liberty through the mind, through lit
erature and philosophy ..." — by Jiri

according to Philippe Aries, a distinguished
French historian whose magnum opus, The
Hour of Our Death, has recently appeared in
English.
Although such clairvoyance was not given
to everyone, writes Aries, this acceptance of
death was not uncommon from the Middle
Ages through the 19th century.
Death was very much a part of life. It was a
spectacle in which the person about to die
played the leading part from the death-bed
scene up to the burial which took place as
often as not right among the living.
One of the mistakes of our society, Aries
believes, is that we haverejected death. Not
only are people not allowed to die when
their time has come — their death pro
longed through artificial means — but their
bodies are quickly removed from sight.
There is an inherent contradiction in our
attitudes toward death. On the one hand the
bereaved are objects of exclusion; there is a
belief that a public demonstration of mourn
ing, as well as its prolonged and involved
private expression, is inherently morbid. On
the other there is the insistence of psy
chologists, starting with Freud and Karl
Abraham,that mourning is a necessary and
healthy reaction.
The psychologist's view of mourning and
its role "is exactly the opposite of the at
titude of society. Society regards mourning
as morbid, whereas for the psychologists it is
the repression of mourning that is morbid
and pathological," writes Aries.
According to Aries not only is there a con
tradiction, but psychologists are plain wrong
when they claim grief to be a natural reac
tion. The insistence that the bereaved must
become accustomed to the absence of the
"other" — a jargon term which refers to the
person lost — and must internalize the fact is
not a timeless truth of human nature, as psy

chologists would have it, but a creation of a
change in human sensibility that occurred
sometime in the 18th century.
It is not that the death of a wife or a close
friend went unregretted in earlier times,
writes Aries, but that affectivity simply did
not play such a large role. It was not unusual
fora widower to remarry within a few
months. He had not forgotten but his grief
was quickly assuaged.
The claim here is not just that people had
different reactions but that they felt dif
ferently. And it is with statements like this
that someone unfamiliar with contemporary
French thought is likely to run into dif
ficulties.
It is easy to accept changes in cultural prac
tices, but do we want to say that subjective
aspects of experience change in the same
way?
If we admit human nature to be relative we
may very well be sliding down the slippery
slope of cultural relativism that does not al
low us to judge and evaluate historical
events. If relativism were true, events have to
be judged on their own terms. So, relativism
could lead us to all sorts of absurdities. We
would be unabletocallslaveryevilforexam
ple, or call one historical period more en
lightened then another.
All historians divide history into periods,
but none do like the French. The French
don't just talk about the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance but about "discourse" — what
is said and written at a particular time — and
historical "breaks" and "ruptures," in the
lingo of an all-encompassing structuralist
philosophy.
Aries is completely unimpressed by
modern-day cultural evolutionism. The de
bate over the effects of the genetic on the
cultural in evolution — the battle being
waged between sociobiologists and more
moderate interactionists — does not interest
him in the least.
"I am not interested at all in this com
parison," Aries said about the comparison
between biological and cultural evolution in
an interview with the Daily during his brief
visit as a guest of the History Department
here last month. "I have a structural view of
phenomena which must be extracted from
sources and documents and not at all by sug
gestions of a philosophical system . . . cul
tural change is not a linear and deterministic
change."
To many French intellectuals, and Aries is
one of them, periods in history are not just a
convenient way of organizing facts but have

an existence of their own.
The individual who comes closest to this
approach in the analytic tradition of Ameri
can and British philosophy is Thomas Kuhn,
who introduced the word "paradigm" into
the philosophy of science. A "paradigm" —
a word that has become a catch-all for social
scientists as well as historians — can be
roughly equated with the structuralists' "dis
course" and with Aries' stages in our at
titudes toward death.
Aries distinguishes between five different
and self-contained periods of Western cul
ture in social attitudes toward death. These
are not equivalent to our ordinary notion of
historical periods such as the Renaissance, or
Middle Ages. Rather, like paradigms they
can be thought of as the frames of reference
or models with which people view the world
—■ frames that consist of anything from in
stitutions to individual habits.
In reference to "Renaissance" and

"Middle Ages" Aries' periods — or
"models" as he calls them — are specific to
his subject matter, can coexist within the
time period and are highly mentalistic.
Aries' book is complex and difficult to fol
low, but like the books of Michel Foucault —
he is very close in his approach to this French
structuralist philosopher — it is full of col
orful detail. Aries uses broad range of evi
dence for his thesis: anything from demo
graphics, wills, inscriptions on tombstones,
statuary in cemetries and personal diaries as
well as novels of Charlotte Bronte. The Hour
of Our Death is the kind of book that can be

read almost at random — opening it at any
page is likely to reveal a fascinating though
perhaps often obscure fact. Reading it from
cover to cover, however, may be tough.
The best guides to the book may be the
short conclusion at the end along with schol
arly reviews in The New York Review of
Books (Oct. 12,1978) and a more recent one
in Psychology Today (March 1981) written by
Stanford's own History Prof. Paul Robinson.
(It is these sources, especially Paul Rob
inson's review, that made the following short
summary possible.)
Aries calls his first model "tame death." It
originated somewhere in the Middle Ages
and though elements of it still persist to the
present day, this way of treating death as a
part of life has been largely replaced by the
contemporary "medicalized" view.
The second model is associated with the
late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aries
calls this "death of the self." It is in this peri
od that there was a rise in individualism and a
greater concern with the pleasures and
possessions of this world which brought
along with it a terror of death previosly un
known.
Aries' third model — that of the 17th and
18th centuries — is more difficult to under
stand. Aries calls this "remote and imminent
death." In this period science begins to dis
tance death but also transforms the dead
person into a fetish.
The fourth model was brought by the ro
manticism of the 19th century. Aries calls this
"the death of the other" or "the beautiful
death." This is the "easeful death" with
which John Keats was "half in love" and the
death discussed extensively by Susan Sontag
in her Illness as Metaphor.
The final and fith model brings us to the
present with "medicalized" death —death
which modern medicine and science tries to
deny.
Whatseems rather unsatisfying isthat both
Aries and Foucault are satisfied in asking the
"what" of history rather then asking the
more complex questions of "how" and
"why."
"I am not sure that historians can explain
the motor of history," Aries told the Daily.
"It is not good to try to find a key to open the
doors" of the "hows" in history. This is the
difference between Aries and Marxist his
torians. "I have no key," Aries said.
"lam not really a historian of death," Aries
told the Daily, " I am interested in attitudes
toward death no more then attitudes toward
sexuality and the family.

Aries is concerned with what he calls"the
sphere of subjectivity" which sounds very
much like a variant of the Jungian idea of the
collective subconscious. The sphere of sub
jectivity is, Aries explained, "all that is not
said, all that is unconscious or non-conscious
plus all the attitudes too familiar to be per
ceived, ones that are deeply internalized."
The modern attitudes toward death are
seen by Aries as an instance of what he views
as an excessive privatization of life.
"The excess of privacy is a bad thing be
cause it closes man in a tomb, a ghetto,"
Aries said, "In the traditional society there
was no distinction between the private and
the public space, they were mixed. Perhaps
the only private space was the bed . .

One of the mistakes of
our society, Aries be
lieves, is that we have re
jected death. Society re
gards mourning as
morbid, whereas for the
psychologists it is the re
pression of mourning
that is morbid and
pathological.

Since then this community space has been
replaced by three spaces: the private, the
professional and the public. Institutions such
as the club or cafe are disappearing from the
scene.
Aries is quite open about his nostalgia for
the cafe and his hatred for the family, which
he says has "imprisoned" man — women in
cluded.
"Man has imprisoned himself by the im
possibility in the modern world to have a
private life outside the family and to have a
public sociability," Aries said.

The Hour of Our Death
By Phillippe Aries

In the 18th century a certain Mme. de
Rhert, sensing that her death was near, ar
ranged her own funeral: she had her house
draped in black, and had masses said ahead
without her feeling the least bit sick. When
she had finished giving all the necessary or
ders to spare her husband from having to do
so, she died on the hour and day she had in
dicated.

only are people not allowed to die when
their time has come — their death pro
longed through artificial means — but their
bodies are quickly removed from sight.
There is an inherent contradiction in our
attitudes toward death. On the one hand the
bereaved are objects of exclusion; there is a
belief that a public demonstration of mourn
ing, as well as its prolonged and involved
private expression, is inherently morbid. On
the other there is the insistence of psy
chologists, starting with Freud and Karl
Abraham,that mourning is a necessary and
healthy reaction.
The psychologist's view of mourning and
its role "is exactly the opposite of the at
titude of society. Society regards mourning
as morbid, whereas for the psychologists it is
the repression of mourning that is morbid
and pathological," writes Aries.
According to Aries not only is there a con
tradiction, but psychologists are plain wrong
when they claim grief to be a natural reac
tion. The insistence that the bereaved must
become accustomed to the absence of the
"other" — a jargon term which refers to the
person lost — and must internalize the fact is
not a timeless truth of human nature, as psy

chologists would have it, but a creation of a
change in human sensibility that occurred
sometime in the 18th century.
It is not that the death of a wife or a close
friend went unregretted in earlier times,
writes Aries, but that affectivity simply did
not play such a large role. It was not unusual
fora widower to remarry within a few
months. He had not forgotten but his grief
was quickly assuaged.
The claim here is not just that people had
different reactions but that they felt dif
ferently. And it is with statements like this
that someone unfamiliar with contemporary
French thought is likely to run into dif
ficulties.
It is easy to accept changes in cultural prac
tices, but do we want to say that subjective
aspects of experience change in the same
way?
If we admit human nature to be relative we
may very well be sliding down the slippery
slope of cultural relativism that does not al
low us to judge and evaluate historical
events. If relativism were true, events have to
be judged on their own terms. So, relativism
could lead us to all sorts of absurdities. We
would be unabletocallslaveryevilforexam
ple, or call one historical period more en
lightened then another.
All historians divide history into periods,
but none do like the French. The French
don't just talk about the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance but about "discourse" — what
is said and written at a particular time — and
historical "breaks" and "ruptures," in the
lingo of an all-encompassing structuralist
philosophy.
Aries is completely unimpressed by
modern-day cultural evolutionism. The de
bate over the effects of the genetic on the
cultural in evolution — the battle being
waged between sociobiologists and more
moderate interactionists — does not interest
him in the least.
"I am not interested at all in this com
parison," Aries said about the comparison
between biological and cultural evolution in
an interview with the Daily during his brief
visit as a guest of the History Department
here last month. "I have a structural view of
phenomena which must be extracted from
sources and documents and not at all by sug
gestions of a philosophical system . . . cul
tural change is not a linear and deterministic
change."
To many French intellectuals, and Aries is
one of them, periods in history are not just a
convenient way of organizing facts but have

an existence of their own.
The individual who comes closest to this
approach in the analytic tradition of Ameri
can and British philosophy is Thomas Kuhn,
who introduced the word "paradigm" into
the philosophy of science. A "paradigm" —
a word that has become a catch-all for social
scientists as well as historians — can be
roughly equated with the structuralists' "dis
course" and with Aries' stages in our at
titudes toward death.
Aries distinguishes between five different
and self-contained periods of Western cul
ture in social attitudes toward death. These
are not equivalent to our ordinary notion of
historical periods such as the Renaissance, or
Middle Ages. Rather, like paradigms they
can be thought of as the frames of reference
or models with which people view the world
—■ frames that consist of anything from in
stitutions to individual habits.
In reference to "Renaissance" and

"Middle Ages" Aries' periods — or
"models" as he calls them — are specific to
his subject matter, can coexist within the
time period and are highly mentalistic.
Aries' book is complex and difficult to fol
low, but like the books of Michel Foucault —
he is very close in his approach to this French
structuralist philosopher — it is full of col
orful detail. Aries uses broad range of evi
dence for his thesis: anything from demo
graphics, wills, inscriptions on tombstones,
statuary in cemetries and personal diaries as
well as novels of Charlotte Bronte. The Hour
of Our Death is the kind of book that can be

read almost at random — opening it at any
page is likely to reveal a fascinating though
perhaps often obscure fact. Reading it from
cover to cover, however, may be tough.
The best guides to the book may be the
short conclusion at the end along with schol
arly reviews in The New York Review of
Books (Oct. 12,1978) and a more recent one
in Psychology Today (March 1981) written by
Stanford's own History Prof. Paul Robinson.
(It is these sources, especially Paul Rob
inson's review, that made the following short
summary possible.)
Aries calls his first model "tame death." It
originated somewhere in the Middle Ages
and though elements of it still persist to the
present day, this way of treating death as a
part of life has been largely replaced by the
contemporary "medicalized" view.
The second model is associated with the
late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Aries
calls this "death of the self." It is in this peri
od that there was a rise in individualism and a
greater concern with the pleasures and
possessions of this world which brought
along with it a terror of death previosly un
known.
Aries' third model — that of the 17th and
18th centuries — is more difficult to under
stand. Aries calls this "remote and imminent
death." In this period science begins to dis
tance death but also transforms the dead
person into a fetish.
The fourth model was brought by the ro
manticism of the 19th century. Aries calls this
"the death of the other" or "the beautiful
death." This is the "easeful death" with
which John Keats was "half in love" and the
death discussed extensively by Susan Sontag
in her Illness as Metaphor.
The final and fith model brings us to the
present with "medicalized" death —death
which modern medicine and science tries to
deny.
Whatseems rather unsatisfying isthat both
Aries and Foucault are satisfied in asking the
"what" of history rather then asking the
more complex questions of "how" and
"why."
"I am not sure that historians can explain
the motor of history," Aries told the Daily.
"It is not good to try to find a key to open the
doors" of the "hows" in history. This is the
difference between Aries and Marxist his
torians. "I have no key," Aries said.
"lam not really a historian of death," Aries
told the Daily, " I am interested in attitudes
toward death no more then attitudes toward
sexuality and the family.

Aries is concerned with what he calls"the
sphere of subjectivity" which sounds very
much like a variant of the Jungian idea of the
collective subconscious. The sphere of sub
jectivity is, Aries explained, "all that is not
said, all that is unconscious or non-conscious
plus all the attitudes too familiar to be per
ceived, ones that are deeply internalized."
The modern attitudes toward death are
seen by Aries as an instance of what he views
as an excessive privatization of life.
"The excess of privacy is a bad thing be
cause it closes man in a tomb, a ghetto,"
Aries said, "In the traditional society there
was no distinction between the private and
the public space, they were mixed. Perhaps
the only private space was the bed . .

One of the mistakes of
our society, Aries be
lieves, is that we have re
jected death. Society re
gards mourning as
morbid, whereas for the
psychologists it is the re
pression of mourning
that is morbid and
pathological.

Since then this community space has been
replaced by three spaces: the private, the
professional and the public. Institutions such
as the club or cafe are disappearing from the
scene.
Aries is quite open about his nostalgia for
the cafe and his hatred for the family, which
he says has "imprisoned" man — women in
cluded.
"Man has imprisoned himself by the im
possibility in the modern world to have a
private life outside the family and to have a
public sociability," Aries said.

The Hour of Our Death
By Phillippe Aries
Alfred A. Knopf
$20.00, 614 pp.
In the 18th century a certain Mme. de
Rhert, sensing that her death was near, ar
ranged her own funeral: she had her house
draped in black, and had masses said ahead
without her feeling the least bit sick. When
she had finished giving all the necessary or
ders to spare her husband from having to do
so, she died on the hour and day she had in
dicated.
In our century such behavior would be
considered eccentric — not so in the 18th,
according to Philippe Aries, a distinguished
French historian whose magnum opus, The
Hour of Our Death, has recently appeared in
English.
Although such clairvoyance was not given
to everyone, writes Aries, this acceptance of
death was not uncommon from the Middle
Ages through the 19th century.
Death was very much a part of life. It was a
spectacle in which the person about to die
played the leading part from the death-bed
scene up to the burial which took place as
often as not right among the living.
One of the mistakes of our society, Aries
believes, is that we haverejected death. Not
only are people not allowed to die when
their time has come — their death pro
longed through artificial means — but their
bodies are quickly removed from sight.
