"In every country (he moun
tains are fountains, not only of
rivers but of men. Therefore
we are all born mountaineers,
the offspring of rock and sun
shine; and, although according
to ordinary commercial meth
ods of computation it may
seem a long way down through
lichen and pine tree to God
like human beings, . . . meas
ured by other standards the
distance becomes scarcely ap
preciable. "
— John Muir
Rarely is a man remembered
by his words alone.

It is the ability to translate
thoughts and dreams into ac
tion that stands out among
lives, demandingthe inquiry of
others which is characterized
as fame.
George Bayley lived from
1840 to 1894, a man who was
destined to be discovered by
history. Evelyn Hyman Chase
was the first to recognize that
destiny, and she worked more
than ten years to see it fulfilled,
producing a chronicle of the
remarkable life of a man who
knew how to live.
Mountain Climber is the

story of a man who was not lim
ited by life. George Bayley's
native urge for adventure filled
a lifetime of explorations; he
crossed the oceans as a sailor,
helped settle the Bay Area as a
pioneer and challenged the
highest peaks in the West as a
mountaineer.
Chase describes Bayley pri
marily as she found him,
through the words of his peers
and his personal journals.
These manuscripts were
gathered from 1967 to 1977 as
Chase traveled thousands of
miles and wrote numerous let
ters, tracking down the news
papers and family memorabilia
which contributed to the bio
graphy.
"It was like solving a mystery

story," said Chase in a recent
interview. "You always learned
something that gave you a start
on the next clue."
As a result of the informal
system of mountaineer record
keeping, Chase found that the
toughest aspect of her search
was establishing definitive
dates of climbs. After extensive
research, however, Chase was
able to determine that the
climber reached the 14,410-
foot peak of Mount Rainier
twice, once on Aug. 17, 1883
and a second time on Aug. 22,
1892 (at the age of 52). He also

logged the first recorded climb
of Mount Starr King in Yosem
ite Park in 1875.
Bayley's love of the harsh
challenges posed by the moun
tains is best expressed in his
own zealous accounts of his
adventures. Rainier alone pro
vided obstacles as varied and
discouraging as übiquitous
swarms of yellowjackets, an in
terminable night spent
stranded in a cave near the
summit and a 2000-foot slide
down the icy glacier which re
sulted in several broken ribs for
jhe diminutive mountaineer.
Yet Bayley spoke little of the
hardships, allowing only that,
"The spice of danger is very
pungent for the moment, but it
leaves a delicious aftertaste."
Beyond his ability as a moun
tain climber, Bayley is
portrayed asa man of many dis
tinguishing talents and in
terests. One of a number of
cultured men who contributed
to the growing city of San Fran
cisco, Bayley worked as a suc
cessful businessman in the
banking industry, a renowned
breeder in the poultry market
and an ardent supporter of the
arts.
The presence of such
educated men in San Francisco
in the late 1800s, Chase sug
gests, ensured the city's de
velopment of its rich and dis
tinctive cultural heritage.
Bayley's role as one of these
"Rennaissance men" is an im
portant reason for the
documentation of his life, ac
cording to Chase.
The research and care that
went into the writing of Moun
tain Climber are the book's
greatest assets. The
documented passages written
by Bayley and his colleagues,
including naturalist John Muir,
lend first-hand realism to the
perils, hardships and glories
experienced by 18th Century
mountaineers (who climbed
before the advent of luxuries
such as modern alpine leading
to the base of the mountains
they assaulted).
