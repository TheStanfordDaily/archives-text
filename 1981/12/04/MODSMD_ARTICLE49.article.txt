Masquerade
By Kit Williams
Shocken Books
$9.95, 31 pp.
Reviews often contain descriptions
like "lyric prose," "exquisite artwork"
and "brilliant creation," but rarely all
three, and even more rarely are such
phrases correct or appropriate. Mas
querade is one of the select books for
which such superlatives apply.
Kit Williams, the English artist, has
written and illustrated a book which is
at once a treasure hunt, a collection of
masterfully executed color plates, a
puzle of conundrums and a beautifully
symbolic, almost archetypical fairy-tale.
What distinguishes Masquerade from
any other children's story is the intricate
multi-leveled nature of the book. At
first glance, Masquerade is merely one
of the most poetically vivid fairy-tales
ever written. As one explores the text

one finds increasing layers of riddles.
Sprinkled liberally through Mas
querade are a number of incredibly in

genious and witty visual puns and
douhle-entendres. Following the Eng
lish style, there are hidden anagrams,
word-jumbles and acrostics.
To cap the whole affair, Masquerade
consists of a wonderfully subtle series of
disguised clues to a precise location
somewhere in England. At this spot, a
golden bejeweled hare is buried. Kit
Williams has offered free traveling ex
penses to England should any non-Brit
on discover the hare's location; no spe
cial knowledge of British geography is
said to be required. Kit Williams has said
that the hare is as likely to be discovered
by an Oxford don as by a child of 10. At
the time of this writing, the hare has still
not been uncovered.
But the primary appeal of iVf.is
quorade should not be the treasure
alone, although the thrill of the hunt
admittedly piqued my interest. The
story and art of Masquerade can be ap
preciated by "children" of all ages. No
matter how much "education" you
have received you will still appreciate
Masquerade for the innocent "sense of
wonder" it evokes.
Do you remember the first time you
saw a shooting star, met a butterfly, sur
prised a rabbit or witnessed a sunset?
Masquerade brings back those memo
ries, and even more that you may have
->riever had.
Williams decided to turn
philosopher when the romance of the
Royal Navy faded. He said, "After four
(fays, I decided I wouldn't become a
philosopher, so I started painting and
never looked back." Though Plato and
Socrates may have lost a boon compa
? nion, I for one am glad he made the de
cision. With t he success of Mascjuerade,
one hopes that Williams will continue
to publish his work; the magically re
freshing quality of his art and prose
might easily prove addicting.
Masquerade is a combination of sev

eral different elements, each of which
exerts its own peculiar fascination on
the reader, whether he or she is young
or old, naive or cynical. Its final value
lies in a universal appeal to that wonder
ing child that remains somewhere
within us all.

1 he cover leaf of the book says it all:
In this Illustrated Fantasy,
the Moon falls in love
with the Sun.
She entrusts her gift,
a Fabulous Jewel,
to Jack Hare,
who must travel through
Earth
Air
Fire and
Water
to reach the Sun.
Along the way many adventures
befall Jack Hare,
but in the end,
the Jewel is lost.
Where it was lost
and where the Treasure
lies buried
is the final puzzle of
MASQUERADE
