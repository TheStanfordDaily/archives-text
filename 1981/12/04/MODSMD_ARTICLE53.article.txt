Beauty and the Beast****
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau wrote and
directed this version of the great
fairy tale, and it is lovely. The look
of the film is consciously styled af
ter Vermeer paintings, but the
tone, with its curious, exhilarat
ing blend of reality and fantasy, is
uniquely Cocteau's.
The Beast inhabits an
enormous palace where ev
erything is enchanted: the
candles are held aloft by human
hands and the walls quite literally
have ears. Nothing is quite as it
seems — Coteau's
tion of the real world is haunting
ly beautiful. Josette Day has been
perfectly typecast as Beauty, and
jean Marais, wearing magnif
icent, amazingly expressive
makeup, is her Beast.
Plays through Wednesday with
The Wanderer.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Guild, Menlo Park
]ohn Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which

Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Prince of the City*
Palo Alto Square
In short, deliberate takes, the
cast performs as though they'd
spent days in an overheated
steam room — we don't get any
rest from their bug-eyed, over
heated actorishness. Every scene
begins at its climax, so that we
never understand what drove
these people to such extreme
states of hysteria. Sidney Lumet,
who directed and co-wrote the
script (with Jay Presson Allen),
seems to think he has something
so important to say in this movie

about police corruption that they
don't have to bother structuring
it or modulating the tone or es
tablishing motivation for the
characters — but it's almost im
possible to figure out what he is
saving. Treat Williams stars, but
the only good performance is
given by Jerry Orbach.

Rich and Famous***
Mountain View Theater
Rich and Famous stars Jac
queline Bisset and Candice
Bergen as best friends who don't
really like each other. It's usually
enjoyable; it never soars, but it is
consistently interesting and
alwavs beautifully put together.
And, sometimes, it is graceful.
This gracefulness can only be
attributed to the director,
George Cukor. Gerald Ayres'
screenplay doesn't supply the
best material he's ever worked
with — it's a write-by-numbers
script, with the plot and dialogue
roughed in but never really
blended. Our disbelief is sus
pended by the director's trust in
his material — the brittle con
trivances of the Ayres script are
softened by Cukor's patience
with them. In an age where most
movies, even comedies, seem to
have been produced at gunpoint
for consumption by captive au
diences, it's a treat to see a film
made with a little kindness.

Bread and Chocolate***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A bittersweet, funny comedy
about an Italian immigrant who Is
battered by the system when he
tries to find his dreams in Switzer
land's promised land. The movie
has a compassion and warmth to
it that makes it eminently watch
able. Nino Manfredi, asthe immi
grant, has one of those faces that
can make anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece. Franco Brusati directed.
Starts next Thursday with Cafe
Fxpress.

Arthur ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and )ohn Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

2001, a Space Odyssey****
New Varisty, Palo Alto
An evolutionary primer, or:
How / /.earned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kurbrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelation finds
mankind ready to make a giant
leap into the unknown. In
Kubrick's vision, what we're leap
ing from is particularly bleak. His
characters are engulfed in tech
nology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendid emptiness of
space, they seem drained and va
cant: they've carried the work
ethic out between the planets.
Space must ultimately be a seduc
tress, and mankind meets its
greater fate only through the
kindness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood, and a computer
named Hal. Plays tonight and
tomorrow with Kubrick's A
Clockwork Orange.

True Confessions***
Old Mill, Mountain View
lohn Gregory Dunne and joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a copand
a priest) is never moved into the

foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good th.it the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.
— S.V.
A Clockwork Orange****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2007, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock isa giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell isthe"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
Plays tonight and tomorrow
with 2007.

Anne of the Thousand Days
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Genevieve Bujold plays Anne
Bolevn, the wife of Henry VIII
who lived, so the story goes, only
<1 thousand days before Henry
decided to detach her head. Bu
jold is the center of the movie —
the camera stays on her relent
lessly — but she's strangely cool,
and it throws the entire movie
out of whack. Burton is much
more fiery as Henry, and, though
the movie is strongly on Boleyn's
side, it's hard not to identify with
him. Charles Jarrot directed,
bloodlessly; Irene Pappas is also
in the cast.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Paul Scofield's A Man for All Sea
sons.

Blazing Saddles **v 2
Saturday, Cubberley
One of Mel Brooks' better ef
forts still comes up short of The
Producers, his first and best, but
at least it is funny. Gene Wilder,
Cleavon Little, Madeleine Kahn
and Mel himself lead the film
through a seriesofone-linersand
slapstick routines which will
doubtless bring good laughs, but
10-to-1 you'll wind up bored with
sexual failures and farts.
Wilder is appropriately mealy
mouthed as a drunkard of an ex
gunfighter, and Cleavon Little is
hilarious as a delightfully re
sourceful black sheriff, but the
movie rapidly degenerates into
silliness.
— Sally Jenkins

1 The Elephant Man ★*★*
I Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
I The Elephant Man is based on
1 the life of John Merrick, a victim
of a deforming disease in nine
— teenth-century England. One
might have expected it to be
preachy and all about "human
dignity" (which, to paraphrase
Samuel Goldwyn, is best left to
telegrams). But, with David
Lvnch's direction and the per
formance of |ohn Hurt as Mer
rick, the movie's not preachy at
an — it's pure magic.
Lynch has created a film that's
equal parts Dickens and Mary
Shelley. We empathize with this
"monster," and we're appalled at
the cruelty of the society in which
he finds himself, Lynch's style is
anything but realistic: his movie
has the look and feel of a great
fairy tale. As played by Hurt, Mer
rick is imbued with sweetness
and gentle grace.

Life of Brian ★*
Fox, Redwood City
Sort of like Godspe// with dirty
jokes. Several brilliant sketches
are lost in the drivel; it's all funny,
but it goes on for much too long.
The Monty Python troupe takes
aim at Biblical epics, terrorist
logistics, and the PLO; while they
don't always score, in this form
even a string of bullseyes would
be boring. A Python movie needs
a better plot than the Bible can
provide.
Double-billed with another
Python movie, Monty Python and
the Holy Grail.
— Mike Hale
