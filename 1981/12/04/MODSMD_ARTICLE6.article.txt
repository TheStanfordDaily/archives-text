# Additional power plant considered

An extensive $750,000 study has
been commissioned by the Univer
sity Board of Trustees to investigate
the feasibility of constructing a sec
ond co-generating plant, producing
both electricity and steam, that will
be located adjacent to the original on
Jordan Way.
If completed, the plant will costthe
University from $25 to $35 million, ac
cording to Jack Barkle, project man
ager at the Facilities Project Man
agement Office. Construction may
start in 1983.
A preliminary study was com
missioned earlier this year; findings
from that study indicated that the
University may make substantial
energy savings if the plant is built.
According to Barkle, the University
currently purchases electrical energy

at a cost of $7.8 million a yearand nat
ural gas to fuel steam boilers at $4.8
million dollars a year. Barkle said co
generation (burning one fuel to pro
duce electricity and steam) could
possibly reduce the current $12.6 mil
lion energy cost to $4.8 million.
The idea behind the co-generation
plant is that instead of purchasing
electricity from the Pacific Gas and
Electric Company (P G & E), and gen
erating steam from heating in a sepa
rate plant, the University will gener
ate its own electricity and steam in
the same plant, converting what
would otherwise be dissipated as
heat loss into energy savings.
Not only will it be cheaper for the
Univesity, but less fuel will be used
overall. "Based on the utility com
pany's request for rate increases and
anticipated inflation effects, the cost

of those forms of energy is expected
to increase to $23.3 million," Barkle
said.
The existing co-generation plant
produces steam for the University
and just enough electricity to supply
the Medical Center in the event of a
power failure. The proposed facility,
however, will use many of the exist
ing electrical and steam hook-ups.
The completed preliminary study
indicated that the University could
receive a satisfactory rate of return
on its investment if the plant were
designed to produce the total steam
requirement of the campus â€” 27
megawatts of electrical power. Stan
ford now consumes 93 million kilo
watt hours of electrical energy a year,
or an average capacity requirement
of about 10.6 megawatts, with the
