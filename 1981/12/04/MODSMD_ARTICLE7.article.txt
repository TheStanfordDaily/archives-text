# ASSU budget controversy persists
## 
### Will McClatchy 
The new ASSU budget is still undetermined due to dif
ferent interpretations of its constitution. The issue is cur
rently being discussed by University and ASSU repre
sentatives.
The ASSU constitution states that the University must
negotiate with the ASSU every other year to determine
an operating budget allowance. It states that University
funds are to be used for "normal" operating expenses,
including "the financial, legislative and executive func
tion . ..."
ASSU Financial Manager Cynthia Mathewson said the
University currently pays for the ASSU's banking ser
vices, which accounts for about one- half of the ASSU's
office, salary and election costs. She claims the University
should pay for all the ASSU's operating costs.
Mathewson stressed, however, that the ASSU still in
tends to pay for programs it sponsors using interest from
its endowment funds or student fee assessments.
Council of Presidents (COP) member Chris Greene
said, "We're not talking about extravagances, we're talk
ing about the basic nuts and bolts of running the ASSU."
Thomas Massey, associate dean of student affairs, said
the ASSU constitution does not require the University to
pay for all operating expenses. He also said that nowhere
in the constitution does it mention what the terms of ne
gotiation must be.
The degree to which previous budget agreements are
binding is also being debated. In 1975 and 1976 the ASSU
was generating income from its Special Events and Travel
Services programs; at the same time the University was
under severe financial constraint.
According to Greene, the ASSU agreed during those
years to pay for certain operating costs. But Greene said

that since neither Special Events nor Travel Services is
currently operating, the ASSU can no longer cover its
operating costs. According to Greene, Travel Services
stopped being feasible after airline deregulations went
into effect; Special Events was discontinued in 1979 fol
lowing three consecutive years of financial losses.
Massey said the three budget agreements since 1975
are not strictly binding. He said, though, that any pro
posed change is subject to negotiation and that the ASSU
must show real need if it intends to ask for more money.
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps said, however, that the
University treats previous budget agreements as if they
were constitutional amendments. According to Phelps,
the only relevant document is the constitution.
"I don't think we're going to see eye to eye on prin
ciples so it would be up to us to show financial need,
which I think we can do," said Phelps.
Mathewson and Phelps warned that if the University
does not pay for more operating expenses, students may
have to make up the difference through increased fee
assessments. They said that the ASSU has tentative plans
to add several new programs and that it may have to seek
increased fee assessments to defray the costs.
Massey suggested that the ASSU may have to limit its
growth. He said the University is asking all its depart
ments to cut their budgets by two percent. He said stu
dents would be willing to pay for new programs through
fee assessments if they thought they needed them badly.
Massey added that students would end up paying
through tuition for money given to the ASSU by the Uni
versity.
Negotiations, according to Mathewson, will continue
into winter quarter.
