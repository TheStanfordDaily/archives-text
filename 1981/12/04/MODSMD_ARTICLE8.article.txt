## Rebel bands fight Obote in Uganda

Obote faces increasing opposi
tion to his 11-month-old rule
from ragtag guerrilla bands
that seem to enjoy widespread
popular support but lack the
firepower to topple the gov
ernment.
Without a major supply of
arms, the guerrillas seem to
pose no immediate threat to
the Obote government, which
last December was elected to
replace the ousted dictatorship
of Idi Amin. The guerrillas say
they are in no hurry, though.
"People always think of a
coup," a guerrilla political
leader observed. "They wantto
chop the head off this regime.
We are moving more slowly.
We will strangle it. But in the
end, it will be just as dead."
During an 11-day trek which
covered about 100 miles in
night marches, guerrillas of the
National Resistance Army
(NRA) took an American jour
nalist to five guerrilla camps on
the condition that the location
of the camps not be given and
that the identities of the guer
rillas not be revealed.
Motivation
The guerrillas appeared to
be motivated by a number of
forces: tribal rivalries, a shat
tered economy, increasingly
autocratic rule by Obote,
charges of rigged elections
and, more recently, a break
down in military discipline that
the guerrillas and villagers say
has turned large parts of the
army into little more than rov
ing bands of bandits.
Most of the problems are the
same that have plagued the 14
million people of this land
locked nation in east central
Africa since it gained inde
pendence from Britain 19 years
ago.
Obote, a charismaticsocialist
of the minority Langi tribe, has
long been at the forefront of
politics. He was the country's
first prime minister and later
became president. He banned
all political parties in 1969 and
was overthrown two years later
by Idi Amin.
Amin's bloody rule was
ended in April 1979 by Ugan

dan rebels helped by Tanza
nian troops. It has been esti
mated that 250,000 Ugandans
were killed during the rule of
Amin, who now lives in Saudi
Arabia.
Obote was returned tooffice
in freeelections but opposition
politicians claim the voting was
rigged. The guerrilla war
started about two months later.
Although the election re
ceived overall approval for its
fairness by a team of observers
from eight Commonwealth
countries, many of the villagers
interviewed during the
marches through the lush
green countryside remained
unconvinced.
Earlier this month, a group of
guerrillas roasted meat over a
campfire at Camp Mwanga.
Within 10 miles of the camp
were four military barracks,
housing several thousand gov
ernment soldiers of Obote's
Uganda National Liberation
Army.
But the sense of security
projected by the 1000 or so
NRA insurgents seemed due to
support from local villagers
among whom they live.
What the villagers cannot
provide, though, is weapons.
Only about two-thirds of the
guerrillas' 1000-man force was
armed — with automatic rifles,
machine guns, grenades and
rocket launchers captured
from the government troops.
Though their supplies are
limited, the guerrillaseffective
ly harass government forces
with hit-and-run raids and
bombings.
There was no apparent evi
dence of foreign assistance to
the rebels, though their leaders
said they would welcome aid
from any quarter.
Villagers encountered on
the marches between the guer
rilla camps accused Obote's
soldiers of murder, rape, loot
ing and vandalism in their anti
guerrilla operations.
The National Resistance
Army is the military wing of the
National Resistance Move
ment, led by former president
(after Amin) Yusufu Lule, now
in exile.
