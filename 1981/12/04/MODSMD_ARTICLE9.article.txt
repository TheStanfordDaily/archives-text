Hanover, West Germany
â€” Former president of Iran
president Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr announced yesterday
he intends to return home
"very soon."
In an interview with the
Hanover, West Germany
newspaper Neue Presse,
Bani-Sadr said: "I am pre
paring for my return. I
would like to travel official
ly. But if that is not possible,
then secretly, and soon."
Bani-Sadr noted that
quite a lot has been
achieved in Iran through
the nationalization of the
banks and insurance com
panies, the tripling of wages
and the raising of agricultur
al prices, but experience has
shown "that socialism
without freedom is a big lie.
And we have not achieved it
(freedom) with Khomeini."
The former Iranian leader
predicted, "If the current
economic situation does
not improve, Khomeini will

fall."
In order to strengthen the
economy, Bani-Sadr said,
Khomeini would have to in
crease oil production, but
the plants have been de
stroyed by bombs, and for
this reason "there is no way
out."
Bani-Sadr, who said he
"once loved Khomeini like
my father," now believes
the Iranian leader is ruined
and has ruined his people.
"He has betrayed all our
hopes."
The former president said
he would even tolerate
bloodshed in Iran if it led to
the ousting of the regime.
"Wearenoangels. Butwe
are on the side of the peo
ple. And they are prepared
to bring about a revolution
through the blood of their
children."
He said, however, that he
would be willing to renouce
power at any time in the
name of freedom.
