COMFORTABLE MIR OF SHOES
LOOK THIS GOOOP
It they're Tiinherlands they do. Because Fimberland
handsewns have a unique construction which allows the
shoe to conform to your foot instead of vice versa.
1 lit- uppers are made of the finest full-grain
leathers. They're sewn with sturdy nylon thread. The
eyelets are solid brass. And the soles are long-lasting,
rugged Vibam. *
The result? Handsewns so comfortable, the
breaking-in period ends the day you put them on.
