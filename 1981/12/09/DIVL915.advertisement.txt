the works of the devil?
"Finally my brethren be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,
put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the
wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, hut against
principalities, against the rulers of die darkness of this world, against
spiritiual wickedness in high places." —(F.pu. 6:10-12)
