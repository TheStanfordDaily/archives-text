Goode, John Meyer, Seymour Martin Lipset and Alex

women's and minority movements, bureaucracy and constraints on
freedom, war and violence. The course is taught by a group of faculty
members selected for their expertise on these topics.
Soc 257, The Professions, Higher Education, and
Social Change in Latin America Gyarmati. MF 2:15-4:05
A theoretical course based on Latin American — mainly Chilean —
experience during the past two or three decades. The course will focus on
the tensions between the technical and the political roles of the
"professional system,' concentrating on the elation between professions
and the system of higher education; social classes and the professions; the
ideology of professional elitism; the basis of the social and political power of
the professional system; and the relation between the professional system
and changes in Latin American society
OFFERINGS OF SPECIAL INTEREST
Soc 126, Evaluation and Social Control
Sandy Dornbusch, W 2:15-5:05
Evaluation is the basic process by which persons control themselves and
control others. Examine evaluation processes within the individual, in small
groups, in organizations, and in the institutions of a society. Study how
evaluations control behavior, and also how and why groups struggle to keep
themselves from being evaluated. There will be some attention to issues of
moral choice and individual freedom in relation to societal pressure.
Soc 149, Youth in Modern Society Larry Sirowy,
MWF 1:15
A study of the ways the lives of children, adolescents, and youth are
organized in modern society, how this situation is changing, and how it
influences experience in later life Special focus is on how institutional
arrangements (organizations, legal structures, normative systems)
structure the status of "child," "adolescent," and "youth." Of particular
interest for students anticipating careers in education, problems of juveniles,
social work, or other helping professions.
Soc 158, Social Movements and Social Protest
Carol Conell, MWF 10:00
This course explores the underside of electoral politics, often referred to as
"the politics of disorder The questions considered include the following:
How do new issues get placed on political agendas? What determines
whether a grievance leads to collective protest, and, what role does formal
organization play in the process? What role do the procedures for
channeling protest which are associated with the liberal state play in
preserving that state and is that role sufficient to justify the claim that the
liberal states response to protest is essentially repressive?
