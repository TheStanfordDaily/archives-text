# Zetes may face charges due to stable prank

### Joan O'Connell 
Zeta Psi fraternity members may
face Fundamental Standard charges
and criminal prosecution following
an incident last Friday when two
pledges were bound with surgical
tape and were left in a horse paddock
near the Stanford stables.
Stanford police say they found
sophomores John deßennedetti and
Morgan Morgan, dressed only in un
dershorts, about 1 a.m. face down in
a muddy area. The two identified
themselves as Zete pledges and ad
mitted that the stunt was part of the
fraternity's "hell week." The police
had been called by a neighbor who
heard yelling and a car leaving.
However, Morgan told the Daily
yesterday that the scene at the stables
was not like the one described by the
police in a University press release.
"In all the initiation activities, the
actives always made sure that there
were people going out to help or
rescue the pledge," he said. "Ten
minutes after we were at the stables,
two pledges brothers were right
there; unfortunately, the police got
there first."
Morgan said he and deßennedetti,
who is legally blind, had been
dropped on their knees, not placed
faced down, and that the noise the
resident heard was the two of them
yelling "Boy, are we enthusiastic" —
the "proper" pledge answer to
queries about their "mental at
titude."
Jennifer Westerland of the Univer
sity Counsel office said yesterday she
is investigating possible violations of
the Fundamental Standard in this in
cident. She would not comment on
the likelihood of any or all of the
Zetes being charged, but said a de
cision was likely to be reached by the
end of the week.
"»h»? Fundamental Standard ex
pects students to show "respect for
order, morality, personal honor and
of a Mills College woman into a
pond, for which three mem
bers have been criminally
charged.
Although Dean of Residen
tial Education Norm Robinson
adamantly refused to make any
comparison between the mov
ie and the Zetes, he said the at
tention given this latest inci
dent is not unwarranted.
"I keep hearing that were it
not for the press, this wouldn't
be a big deal. But the potential
disasterousness of this case is
evident and has provoked the
kind of coverage it's received,"
Robinson said.
Robinson said he will review
his decision to suspend the
Zetes and may extend the sus
pension or expell the fraternity
altogether. A decision from his
office is likely within the next
few weeks, he said.
Robinson admitted that the
penalities for hazing as set
down in the California Educa
tion Code explain the Univer
sity's concern with following
up this matter; a person, cor
poration or association which
knowingly permits hazing,
"shall forfeitanyentitlementto

public funds, scholarships or
awards which are enjoyed by
him or by it and shall by
deprived of any sanction orap
proval granted by any public
educational institution," the
code states.
Conceivably, should any stu
dents be held liable for the haz
ing violation, they could stand
to lose student loans or schol
arships.
Robinson will continue to
use the "collective responsi
blity" standard in dealing with
the fraternity, however, espe
cially since the incident in
volves an initiation activity.
Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons agreed with Rob
inson's assessment of the seri
ousness of the matter: "In
deed, when you bind someone
by their hands and feet and put
them face down in mud pud
dles and horse manure, they
easily could drown," 'Lyons
said.
"This pledge class has under
gone a humiliating and de
structive experience — I'm told
they think this is a very good
thing because it's part of the
Zete tradition.
"We have to ask, is this what

these same pledges would de
cide to replicate in a re
organized house?" Lyons said,
commenting that additional
review by Robinson seemed in
order.
Morgan said he thought it
was "impossible for anyone
outside the house to judge
what's going on inside the
house. No matter how you put
it down in words, it's going to
look worse than it is.
After meeting with members
of the fraternity, Robinson said
he is still left with the im
pression that the group "hasan
inability to generalize."
"No, no one specifically told
them not to do this," Robinson
said, but "Diana (Conklin) met
with them last Wednesday to
go over state laws about haz
ing."
Neither Robinson nor Lyons
said they could recall an inci
dent of hazing on campus in
the past.
Robinson said he would like
ly consult with Lyons before
making a decision on the fate
of the Zetes, adding that he
would not reconvene the com
mittee which had advised his
earlier decision.
