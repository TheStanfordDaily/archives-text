# Zetes may face charges due to stable prank

Zeta Psi fraternity members may
face Fundamental Standard charges
and criminal prosecution following
an incident last Friday when two
pledges were bound with surgical
tape and were left in a horse paddock
near the Stanford stables.
Stanford police say they found
sophomores John deßennedetti and
Morgan Morgan, dressed only in un
dershorts, about 1 a.m. face down in
a muddy area. The two identified
themselves as Zete pledges and ad
mitted that the stunt was part of the
fraternity's "hell week." The police
had been called by a neighbor who
heard yelling and a car leaving.
However, Morgan told the Daily
yesterday that the scene at the stables
was not like the one described by the
police in a University press release.
"In all the initiation activities, the
actives always made sure that there
were people going out to help or
rescue the pledge," he said. "Ten
minutes after we were at the stables,
two pledges brothers were right
there; unfortunately, the police got
there first."
Morgan said he and deßennedetti,
who is legally blind, had been
dropped on their knees, not placed
faced down, and that the noise the
resident heard was the two of them
yelling "Boy, are we enthusiastic" —
the "proper" pledge answer to
queries about their "mental at
titude."
Jennifer Westerland of the Univer
sity Counsel office said yesterday she
is investigating possible violations of
the Fundamental Standard in this in
cident. She would not comment on
the likelihood of any or all of the
Zetes being charged, but said a de
cision was likely to be reached by the
end of the week.
