# Vietnam subsists on dollars, inefficiency

from the Daily wire services
Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam â€” The com
munists may have conquered South Viet
nam, but in its former capital, the U.S.
dollar still is the strongest currency. One
can buv everything from soap to stereos
with American dollars. Vietnam's own cur
rency, the dong, buys very little.
Unable to beat the dollar-funded black
market, the government has joined it. Spe
cial state stores purvey such scarce com
modities as beer, cloth and cigarettes to
Vietnamese lucky enough to get money
from abroad.
And to sweep up the greenbacks for the
government's own use without killing the
lucrative trade, state banks exchange Ha
noi-printed "dollar-As"for the real thing.
The dollar-As then recirculate through
what may be the world's busiest and most
blatant underground economy.
Five dollars will buy a delicious three
course dinner for three, or one of the
young women haunting the shadowsagain
on General Uprising Street between the
Cuu Long and Song Sen Hotels. The infre
quent Western visitors stay at the Cuu
Long, the Russians at the Song Sen.
According to Eastern Europeans sta
tioned in Hanoi, the underground econo
my hastaken over there too, forthesimple
reason that nothing seems to work in of
ficial channels.
Because of the starvation wages paid
throughout Vietnam, bureaucrats exact
cigarettes, liquor or cash in return for ev
ery government transaction. The "gift" is
converted into food for the family. After
dollars, the most valuable currency is Brit
ish cigarettes called "State Express."
Second economy
In the factories, production drags be
cause employees use their working hours
to rest up for their second jobs. "A kilo of
pork (just more than two pounds) costs 50
dong," said a Hanoi resident visiting the
south. "A factory job pays 60 donga
month. So people have to have second
jobs to survive." This might be gardening
or repair work or clothes-making, or

black-market trading.
Until recently, the Communist leader
ship headed by Secretary General Le Duan
blamed the failing economy on wartime
disruption and damage, the lingering ef
fects of American defoliation with Agent
Orange and a series of droughts and
floods. Those problems are real in the eyes
of Western analysts, but not real enough to
explain Vietnam's inability to recover after
six-and-a-half years of relative peace.
This year the party organ, Nhari Dan,
finally admitted that "our poor economic
management" also was to blamed.
Ineptness is, in fact, evident everywhere.
It takes Vietnam's railroad seven days to
move an expresstrain 1100 miles from here
to Hanoi: a speed of six mph. Moreover,
the daily flight between the two cities is so
clogged that essential government officials
find themselves stranded away from work
for days on end. Mismanagement strands
vital shipments in harbor and on the docks
for months. A desperately needed paper
making machine from France still sits on
the quay a year after unloading, its condi
tion in the crates unknown.
Skills unused
Meanwhile, people with the know-how
to straighten out the economy languish in
make-work jobs or "re-education camps,"
or have long since fled the country.
"The Communists in the north thought
all they had to do was win the war," said a
high-level technocrat who served in the
South Vietnamese regime at a high level
and now works in the Communist govern
ment. "It had come as a great shock that no
economic miracle automatically followed
the victory."
A Marxist from Eastern Europe who had
lived in Hanoi for nearly two years put it
this way: "All the leaders are military men,
basically. They know nothing about eco
nomics, and when they try to bring in so
called new blood, it's the same old 60-
year-olds with no new ideas."
Somewhat unwillingly, advisors have ar
rived from the Soviet Union and its allies to
help straighten out the mess.

Evidence is mounting that the obvious
economic crisis despite Soviet aid and ad
vice, might be expanding into a personal
political crisis for Le Duan. Hanoi dis
patches report that the party Central Com
mittee met from Oct. 9 to Nov. 3 without
reaching agreement on plans for the Fifth
Party Congress.
The immediate crisis is the human one,
and its roots are not only Marxist.
U.S. soldiers' kids
The western visitor's first sight as the air
port minibus pulls into General Uprising
Street is a clutch of boys and girls who
pursue the passersby to sell them
cigarettes. These are kids of American sol
diers, along with thousands of others of
their type in the country trying to scratch
out an existence, the left-behind offspring
of Vietnamese mothers, rejected by their
peers. Many live in the streets on their
own.
When word got around that there were
Americans staying at the hotel several of
the youngsters brought their mothers.
They spoke English, telling of their hard
ships and asking visitors to deliver their ap
plications for refugee status to the Ameri
can Empassy in Bangkok.
"My name is Le-thi Kim Hue," read one
letter. "Date and place of birth: 1948, Trav
inh. Sex: female. Nationality: Vietnam. Re
ligion: Catholic. I wish to write this ap
plication for approval to come to the Unit
ed States of America for myself and my
daughter named Le-thi Hoang My, born
13-7-73 at Vinh Binh from an American
father."
But there is nospecial refugees category
for half-American children or their moth
ers. The just-resumed refugee airlift carries
150 a week at most. The U.S. Orderly De
parture Program office in Bangkok has
65,000 applications, most of them covering
four or five persons in a family.
Once people apply for the required exit
permit, Vietnam washes its hands of them.
Downtown streets are lined with little tea
shops where waiting emigrants try to eke
out a living.
