# Norway adds to military, fearing USSR
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Oslo, Norway — The pene
tration of a Soviet submarine
into Swedish territorial waters
continues to make diplomatic
waves in Scandinavia.
The incident has strength
ened the anti-Soviet stance of
conservative parties in the re
gion, according to diplomatic
sources here, and has weak
ened the postion of some left
wing parties — at least for the

short term.
It has been a source of spe
cial trouble for left-wing party
leaders in Norway who had
called for the creation of a nu
clear-free zone in Scandinavia.
Most Norwegians, as well as
other Scandinavians, accept as
valid a Swedish report that
some sort of nucleararmament
was aboard the submarine,
which was stranded Oct. 24
near a Swedish naval base.
As Berge Furre, chairman of
the Socialist Left Party in Nor
way, put it recently, "We still
consider it a great mystery how
the Soviets could do a silly
thing like that. I'd like to send
an open letter to (Soviet lead
er) Leonid Brezhnev saying,
'You are an idiot — or you have
an admiral who is an idiot.' "
The Socialist Left Party stands
considerably to the left of the
opposition Labor Party, but
Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
Labor Party leader who gov
erned Norway until the party's
defeat in the September elec
tion, said recently: "The sub
marine question opened the
eyes of some people who had
no reason to have their eyes
shut before. There is now a
greater realism where Soviet

intentions are concerned."
Still, Brundtland said that the
very fact that a Soviet vessel
penetrated Scandinavian wa
ters with atomic weapons on
board indicated that there is a
pressing need for creating a
nuclear-free zone around
Scandinavia.
The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has no
nuclear weapons in Norway,
but there are U.S. carrier forces
and attack planes based in the
United Kingdom and these are
close to Scandinavia.
Until the September elec
tions here, the issue of creating
a nuclear-free zone in Scan
dinavia was a hot one, but, part
ly because of the Soviet sub
marine incident and partly be
cause of the accession to
power by the Conservative Par
ty, the issue is now less urgent.
Kjall Colding, the under
secretary of state for security
affairs in the present govern
ment of Prime Minister Kaare
Willoch, indicated that the is
sue of ridding Norway and all
of Scandinavia of nuclear
weapons is no longer as sensi
tive as it had been.
Prime Minister Willoch has
pledged to stiffen Norway's de

fense. He has earmarked four
percent of the gross national
product for that purpose.
The prime focus of Norway's
defense under the new, Con
servative government is to
ward off any attack by its huge
neighbor, the Soviet Union.
Norway is the only NATO
country besides Turkey that
shares a border with the Soviet
Union.
According to Colding, Nor
way's primary defense goal u
making sure that the NATO
powers will come to its aid in
case of a Soviet attack.
Toward that end, the conser
vative government has taken
the controversial decision toal
low NATO to preposition arms
fora U.S. Marine brigade that
would be expected to rush to
Norway in the event of
hostilities.
In the past, Scandinavian
countries have depth-charged
— after adequate warning —
what were presumed to be So
viet submarines in theirterrito
rial waters. But now they face
the question of whether they
should use depth charges
against a submarine that might
be carrying nuclear weapons.
