# Rebels vie Guatemalan terror

### Los Angeles Times 
Tecpan, Guatemala — After anti-government
guerillas last month blocked the major highway
here by felling trees on the route, the govern
ment reacted by mounting its largest military op
eration in years and conducting a weeklong
sweep to open the highway.
Gen. Benedicto Lucas Garcia, the new army
chief of staff, said afterward that the rebels now
number between 2000 and 4000 armed activists.
He used to say there were 2000.
The activity around Tecpan was the cul
mination of a series of guerrilla moves that has
led the country's military regime to recognize
the rebels as a real political threat — the third in
surrection in Guatemala in less than 20 years.
LJ.S. options are limited because the Lucas
Garcia government has such a dismal human
rights record that for Washington there can be
no moral justification for providing it with mili

tary aid. There is little prospect that his regime
will make any attempt at reform.
Indeed, the signs are that repression is increas
ing. The U.S. State Department reported early
this year that politically motivated killings in the
first half of 1981 averaged 250 a month, and in
formed sources said the number now is about
300 a month, with most of the victims being cam
pesinos, landless migrant farm workers.
In one incident on Sept. 27, soldiers sur
rounded a village square and began firing in
discriminately into a crowd celebrating a feast,
killing 30 people.
One landowner said, "The army comes in
looking for people who are supporitng the guer
rilla movement. They argue that if the guerrillas
have been here, it must be because they have
support. They look for culprits and then those
people disappear. The army tends to be very ar
bitrary."
