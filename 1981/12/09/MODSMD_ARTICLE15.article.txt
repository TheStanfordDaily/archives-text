## Editorials The 						high price we pay 
### 
When we at the Daily heard that
undergraduatetuition will rise 15 percent to an
astounding $8211 next year, our reaction was
one of frustration. Our first comment — like
those of some students reading the headline at
the Post Office Friday — was an obscenity.
But beyond that outburst are serious concerns
about the effects of such a huge hike in tuition.
Will financial aids sufficiently compensate
present Stanford students so that they we will be
able to continue education uninterrupted, or
will the added cost force some of us to stop out
involuntarily and work before we can graduate?
Will the University, already beleaguered by
federal cutbacks on student loans, be forced to
abandon the admissions policy blind to
students' financial situations which yields
Stanford so much of its diversity? Even if it can,
willthe high price tag scare away the same low
income applicants that the University has tried
so hard to recruit?
If the University can provide satisfactory

answers to these questions — and it promises
that it can — then the tuition increase might
prompt us toexamine other, more personal
concerns. Wecould think about whether we're
content that the quality of education here
merits the astronomical tuition. We might
examine ways we could improve our utilization
of thetimeand money we spend here. And we
might considerthe multitude of opportunities
outside the classroom that our fees help pay for
and decide whether we are taking advantage of
as many as we would like.
No one else can evaluate our activities for us
because we each hope to get something
different out of our time here. Although we
won't really know whether we made our time at
Stanford worth the $50,000-odd dollars we will
spend here until many years after we graduate, a
little introspection can be valuable. It becomes
especially important at times like this when
tuition hikes remind us how expenisive our
vears on the Farm will be.
