# What's the big deal?

Most of us, given the choice, would probably
prefer not to be tied up, stripped to our
underclothes and left in the cold night in a
smelly horse stable.
However, a few of us would. That is to say,
certain men in the Stanfordcommunityare
willing to put up withthe traditional ritesof
"hell week" to join fraternities, some of which
require pledging members to perform feats
causing personal discomfort, embarrassment or
both. Those who wish to join many of the
fraternities on this campus know full well what
they will have to go through to do so, and they
are still willing to do it.
We agree that the University has a
responsibility to make every effort to ensure the
well-being of students and other members of
the Stanford community. With regard to hazing,
sanctions must exist todeal with and prevent
fraternity initiation rituals that jeopardize the
safety of participants.
But it is with mixed feelings that we viewthe
reaction of both the University and the local
media to an incident early Friday morning in
which two pledges of the Zeta Psi fraternity were
discovered in the midst of an initiation activity.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons was not
off base in his first response that he was
"incredulous" that despite the suspension the
Zetes received for violating University rules
earlier this quarter, the fraternity would
conduct"hell week" activities which resulted in
a police response, possible criminal and
University disciplinary chargesand further
media portrayals of an"Animal House"on the
Stanford campus. Generally, theZetesdon't
really seem too impressed by the lessons they
were supposed to have learned from the

incident involving the woman from Mills
College.
But in the interest of fairness, it is important to
recognize that the University has responded to
the most recent incident involving the fraternity
differently than it has to such cases before, and
that the Zetes are not the only local chapter that
engages in thistypeof hazingduring initiation.
This fall the University has had to make a
tough decision to suspend the Zetes for three
years. Now, however, the University seems so
bent on proving the decision right that certain
administrators appear to be doing their best to
play up this incident and paint it as one more
example of the Zetes' near-barbarism. Some
have even suggested that Zeta Psi could face
permanent expulsion from the University, an
action that would be unprecedented.
The issue then becomes: were two Zete
pledges in danger?
In the opinion of Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer, they "could have drowned out
there." Yet the two pledges denied the need for
medical assistance and wished only to return to
their house. And neithershowedany
willingness to divulge the names of those who
had bound them, telling police they were angry
not about the incident itself, but about the
stormy reaction to it. Certainly if they had issued
complaints, it would be a different matter.
We emphasize, as we have before, that the
Zetes deserve to have been kicked off campus
for other actions; but this recent incident
should not be used to justify that decision. The
reaction in the local media and from University
administrators is a sorry example of
overreaction to an internal affair among
consenting membersof a group.
