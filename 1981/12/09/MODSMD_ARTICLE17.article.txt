# Extend library hours
## 
### 
Oceans of bicycles parked between Green
and Meyer librariesand midnight linesof
students waiting to borrow books from Meyer as
the library closes remind us of the season: it is,
again, Dead Week — another Dead Week and
slew of finals without extended library hours.
Meyer Library closesat midnight each night;
Green Library, the University's most extensive
collection of books and periodicals, has even
shorter hours. The end-of-the-quarter rush to
finish research papers and to read reserved
works makes thisa crucial time to heed the
perennial plea to open the libraries — or at least
one major library — far later into the night.
Access to library materials is a crucial part of
the learning process for which Stanford exists.
Longer library hours would further that process,
especially when students most demand
libraries' quiet and materials.
The primary objection toextending library
hours is, of course, a lack of money. Currently,
there is a time (6 p.m. on Fridays for Green

Library) when it becomes too costly to allow
libraries to remain open. However, this
reasoning is fraught with perils common to all
cost/benefit analysis: it is easy to quantify costs
while benefits, which are often intangible goods
such as learning, are much harder to assess.
Lighting, heat, security and people to shelve
and check books all cost money; the costs are
fairly clear. But howdo you measure the benefit
of less crowded libraries or of students' ability to
finish a term paper more thoroughly, to check
one more source or footnote, or to have a quiet
and safe place to work?
Discussing benefitsof an open library extends
to a defense of learning itself. Insights gained
from reading Gibbons on reserve at dawn or 3
a.m. interpretations of Newton are invaluable.
Costs will be balanced againstthese benefits,
but we feel the University should keep its
principal institution of learning available to
students far beyond midnight or 11 p.m. —
especially during the last weeks of a quarter.
