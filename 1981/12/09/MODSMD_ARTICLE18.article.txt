# End throwaway ethic
## 
### 
Californians, as the nation's leading
consumers of beer and soft drinks, throw away
approximately 7 billion cansand bottlesa year
(that comes down toabout 13,000 throwaways
every minute).
Currently, a group called Californians Against
Waste (CAW) is moving to end this waste,
sponsoring a signature-gathering campaign to
put the Can and Bottle Recycling Initiative on
California's November 1982 ballot.
The initiative, if approved by voters, will
require a minumum refundable deposit of 5
centson all beerandsoftdrinks in bottlesand
cans. Stores would be reimbursed for
redeeming empty containers of the brands they
sell, and in return would receivea handlingfee
of 20 percent of the deposits returned to
customers. The measure also allows recycling
centers to collect the handling fee for
redeeming cans and bottles.
In response to similar measures in the past,
industry officials have charged that the initiative
would reduce jobs as a result of reduced
production and increase costs and energy use
due to transportation requirements. In fact, the

proposed initiative isexpected to net substantial
energy savings from decreasing the production
of new containers and an increase of nearly 4800
jobs, besides lowering demands on our
overburdened waste disposal systems and
reducing American imports of expensive
bauxite (used to make aluminum).
Similar measures have passed in eight other
states, resulting in lower prices to consumers in
all but one (Michigan's plan does not provide a
handling fee to redemption centers, passing the
costs directly to buyers). The California plan,
implemented through the business sector,
constructs no expensive new government
bureaucracies.
Most importantly, the recycling initiative
takes a step toward combatting the "throwaway
ethic," the attitudesand behaviors of waste
which mustchangeforourworld tosurvive.
We support the efforts of CAW to make
California a national leader in establishing
practices of conservation and recycling, and we
encourage registered voters in the Stanford
community to voice their support by adding
their names to the initiative proposal.
