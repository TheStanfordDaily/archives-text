## Politics trendy in Europe 
### 
In Europe, fashion has always been
important. The latest styles out of Par
is or Rome make their debuts on city
streets throughout the continent.
With Gucci in your pocket or YSL
around your neck, acceptance is the
result, no matter what the actual
quality or beauty of the item may be.
Is it any wonder, then, that the
realm of political reason has been in
corporated into the world of fashion
by the style-conscious Europeans?
No longer is it enough to wear the
right clothes and carry the right ac
cessories; political beliefs must fol
low the trends as well and un
fortunately, it seems that the "latest
in politics" comes not from Paris or
Rome but from Moscow.
The "House of Brezhnev" has not
been slow in reacting to its new
found popularity. In fact, the new fall
line included "peace overtures" to
the Netherlands, France, Italy and
others as well as a promise to spare
Germans from nuclear attack if they
refuse to deploy U.S. medium-range
missiles in their country. The claim is
that the Soviet Union cannot be con
sidered an enemy. Perhaps more re
markable is the identity of the person
who made this claim in a national tel
evision interview: West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
The misled, deluded neutralists of
Western Europe are taking to the
streets these days in greater and
greater numbers. Almost every large
city has been the sight of demonstra
tions. European friends report that
the atmosphere at these gatherings is
more social than political; demon
strators vie to outdo one another
with flashy protest signs and lapel
pins. (One popular button shows two
big-nosed profiles, one striped red,
white and blue, the other, red and
gold. In the middle is a peace sign; a
finger is stuck in each of the noses.)
Incredibly enough, the sentiment
at these rallies is almost exclusively
anti-American. It is somehow not im
portant that the Soviets threaten Po
land with invasion, land spy sub
marines on Swedish shores, or active-

ly exploit theircolonies in Eastern Eu
rope. To the modern neutralist,
American missiles which are still on
the drawing board are a far greater
danger to peace than the more than
600 land-based Soviet missiles
targeted at Western Europe. Clearly,
such distorted logic can only be at
tributed to the whimsical dictates of
fashion rather than the pragmatic
reasoning required by the situation.
A new and dangerous philosophy
is developing in the West. No longer
are the NATO countries willing to
take the responsibility of equal part
ners in the Western alliance. They
prefer to see themselves as innocent,
morally superior and relatively pow
erless nations, caught in the middle
of an enormous, amoral power strug
gle. The convenience of this philoso-

Western alliance.

phy is obvious but it simply refuses to
face the facts. The United States and
the Soviet Union are by no means
morally equivalent. While some
present aspects of U.S. foreign policy
are questionable, decisions are usual
ly based on moral concerns as well as
our own self-interests. On the other
hand, it would be difficult to cite a
single time when the Soviet Union
hasacted outof concern foranything
other than its own interests. Sadly,
the simple fact of the matter is that it
is stylish to criticize the United States
and to sympathize with and "under
stand" the Soviet Union. Very few
people try to support these views
with objective information. Whether
or not an opinion is in vogue is ap
parently more important than the
truth.
As hard as it is to believe, the U.S.
boycott of the Olympics was proba
bly more unpopular with the neutral
ists than the Soviet invasion and con
tinued occupation of Afghanistan.
Perhaps their cry, "Politics and sports

don't mix!" should be answered with
an equally simplistic reply, "Neither
do politicsand fashion!!"
Just recently, 250,000 "peace dem
onstrators" filled the streets in Bonn.
Meanwhile, the newly formed
Papendreou government in Greece
announced its plans to withdraw
from NATO and to negotiate the re
moval of U.S. bases there. It is ap
parent that many Western Europeans
would rather shrink from their re
sponsibilities while ignoring the re
ality of the present situation. As Dr.
Leon Wieseltier of Harvard puts it,
the peace apostles do notenjoy spiri
tual superiority but suffer from a sort
of spiritual fatigue induced by a long
peace and a security safeguarded by
the NATO alliance and the United
States.

Political ideologies of the kind
espoused today by the chique in
tellectuals of Western Europe can
only bring about eventual disaster,
with or without an actual war. The
thousands of tanks which the Soviet
Union has positioned along the
Eastern European border are ob
viously not defensive in nature and
Soviet victory through intimidation is
conceivable.
Nevertheless, any victory of that
sort will be a long time in coming. Al
ready, the pendulum of political
thought may have reversed its direc
tion. Perhaps European sensibilities
are growing tired of the blatant ig
norance of reality which is inherent
to neutralist dogma.
There is one thing we can be cer
tain of with European fashions: they
will always change. Whether or not
the next change will come in time re
mains to be seen.

the NATO alliance and the United
States.

Political ideologies of the kind
espoused today by the chique in
tellectuals of Western Europe can
only bring about eventual disaster,
with or without an actual war. The
thousands of tanks which the Soviet
Union has positioned along the
Eastern European border are ob
viously not defensive in nature and
Soviet victory through intimidation is
conceivable.
Nevertheless, any victory of that
sort will be a long time in coming. Al
ready, the pendulum of political
thought may have reversed its direc
tion. Perhaps European sensibilities
are growing tired of the blatant ig
norance of reality which is inherent
to neutralist dogma.
There is one thing we can be cer
tain of with European fashions: they
will always change. Whether or not
the next change will come in time re
mains to be seen.

In Europe, fashion has always been
important. The latest styles out of Par
is or Rome make their debuts on city
streets throughout the continent.
With Gucci in your pocket or YSL
around your neck, acceptance is the
result, no matter what the actual
quality or beauty of the item may be.
Is it any wonder, then, that the
realm of political reason has been in
corporated into the world of fashion
by the style-conscious Europeans?
No longer is it enough to wear the
right clothes and carry the right ac
cessories; political beliefs must fol
low the trends as well and un
fortunately, it seems that the "latest
in politics" comes not from Paris or
Rome but from Moscow.
The "House of Brezhnev" has not
been slow in reacting to its new
found popularity. In fact, the new fall
line included "peace overtures" to
the Netherlands, France, Italy and
others as well as a promise to spare
Germans from nuclear attack if they
refuse to deploy U.S. medium-range
missiles in their country. The claim is
that the Soviet Union cannot be con
sidered an enemy. Perhaps more re
markable is the identity of the person
who made this claim in a national tel
evision interview: West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
The misled, deluded neutralists of
Western Europe are taking to the
streets these days in greater and
greater numbers. Almost every large
city has been the sight of demonstra
tions. European friends report that
the atmosphere at these gatherings is
more social than political; demon
strators vie to outdo one another
with flashy protest signs and lapel
pins. (One popular button shows two
big-nosed profiles, one striped red,
white and blue, the other, red and
gold. In the middle is a peace sign; a
finger is stuck in each of the noses.)
Incredibly enough, the sentiment
at these rallies is almost exclusively
anti-American. It is somehow not im
portant that the Soviets threaten Po
land with invasion, land spy sub
marines on Swedish shores, or active-

ly exploit theircolonies in Eastern Eu
rope. To the modern neutralist,
American missiles which are still on
the drawing board are a far greater
danger to peace than the more than
600 land-based Soviet missiles
targeted at Western Europe. Clearly,
such distorted logic can only be at
tributed to the whimsical dictates of
fashion rather than the pragmatic
reasoning required by the situation.
A new and dangerous philosophy
is developing in the West. No longer
are the NATO countries willing to
take the responsibility of equal part
ners in the Western alliance. They
prefer to see themselves as innocent,
morally superior and relatively pow
erless nations, caught in the middle
of an enormous, amoral power strug
gle. The convenience of this philoso-

phy is obvious but it simply refuses to
face the facts. The United States and
the Soviet Union are by no means
morally equivalent. While some
present aspects of U.S. foreign policy
are questionable, decisions are usual
ly based on moral concerns as well as
our own self-interests. On the other
hand, it would be difficult to cite a
single time when the Soviet Union
hasacted outof concern foranything
other than its own interests. Sadly,
the simple fact of the matter is that it
is stylish to criticize the United States
and to sympathize with and "under
stand" the Soviet Union. Very few
people try to support these views
with objective information. Whether
or not an opinion is in vogue is ap
parently more important than the
truth.
As hard as it is to believe, the U.S.
boycott of the Olympics was proba
bly more unpopular with the neutral
ists than the Soviet invasion and con
tinued occupation of Afghanistan.
Perhaps their cry, "Politics and sports

don't mix!" should be answered with
an equally simplistic reply, "Neither
do politicsand fashion!!"
Just recently, 250,000 "peace dem
onstrators" filled the streets in Bonn.
Meanwhile, the newly formed
Papendreou government in Greece
announced its plans to withdraw
from NATO and to negotiate the re
moval of U.S. bases there. It is ap
parent that many Western Europeans
would rather shrink from their re
sponsibilities while ignoring the re
ality of the present situation. As Dr.
Leon Wieseltier of Harvard puts it,
the peace apostles do notenjoy spiri
tual superiority but suffer from a sort
of spiritual fatigue induced by a long
peace and a security safeguarded by
the NATO alliance and the United
States.
