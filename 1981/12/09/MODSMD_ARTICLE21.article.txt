## Stanford Enquirer? 
### 
The recent front page article en
titled "Accusations aren't the first for
Allen" (Daily, Dec. 1) has got to be
the worst trash I've read in the Daily
in some time. This report cited a Wall
Street journal accusation that Rich
ard Allen "used his position toobtain
consulting contracts for himself and
his friends" without even saying what
his position was at the time or what
evidence was found to substantiate
the accusation.
The story further states that in 1978
Allen introduced a client of his com
pany to several "congressional lead
ers" as if making introductions was
unethical. The next "accusation"
seems to be that Allen made some
$70,000 as a consultant to various
firms in the late '70s.
Further: "He (Allen) denied re
ports that Datsun paid him $100,000 a
year." What reports are those and
who reported them? Furthermore,
whose business is it how much Allen
made as a consultant before joining
the White House staff? But the real
juicy stuff on Allen is this tidbit: "In
mid-1972, Allen acted as a consultant
for Howard Cerney, a lawyer for
Robert Vesco, a financier who was
later accused of swindling investors."
This "news" piece is so ridiculous
that the reader wants to laugh. If this
article represents the current stan
dard of reporting upheld by the Dai
ly, then may I suggest a new name for
our campus paper. The Stanford En
quirer.
