## Join fight to save Sakharov 
### 
At this moment, Nobel laureate
Andrei Sakharov and his wife, Elena
Bonner, are in the third week of their
hunger strike.
In 1968, the year of the Soviet in
vasion of Czechoslovakia, Sakharov,
a prominent Soviet physicist and aca
demician, published his book
Progress, Coexistence and Intellec
tual Freedom. The outstanding fea
ture of this book was the scope of the
problems he addressed â€” human
rights, poverty, world hunger, the
environment, disarmament and
peace.
While it wasamazingthatthisbook
came from a person who seemed to
be totally involved in his narrow pro
fessional activity, the real uniqueness
of this event was that it was the first
case in Soviet history when a person
who belonged to the scientific elite,
who had more official awards than
any of the leaders of the country,
voiced opinions entirely independ
ent of the official line. His approach,
which at first glance could seem
naive, in fact shows a very profound
understanding of the modern world.
Hisdeep concern forthe rights and
dignity of every single human being
has proven to be very effective in
solving difficult problems.
He stands by his principles with in
credible firmness and courage. He
has never hesitated to stop anything
he is working on to help a person in
trouble. His statements and tele
grams in defense of hundreds of peo
ple all over the world could in the
long run prove even more valuable
to us than his articles and books.
His activities have brought upon
him persecution by the Soviet au
thorities. Sakharov was dismissed
from his top position. The Soviet gov
ernment has orchestrated a loud
slander campaign against him. Day
and night for more than a decade his
every step has been followed by KGB
agents.
The campaign against Sakharov
peaked in 1975 after he was awarded
the Nobel Peace Prize. At this time,
not yet daring to arrest such promi
nent people, the KGB made physical
threats against the Sakharovs' two
children. Greatly concerned with
their children's lives and safety, the
Sakharovs persuaded them to leave
the country. At that time their son
Alexei was already engaged to a
young girl, Liza Alexeyva, who

couldn't join him then. Sakharov
persuaded Alexei to leave the coun
try without Liza, promising to assure
the permission from Soviet author
ities for Liza's emigration. Never
theless, during all these years all at
tempts to obtain this permission have
failed. In fact, Liza has been used as a
hostage in the struggle of the author
ities against the Sakharovs.
In 1980, after he voiced his opposi
tion to the Soviet invasion of Afghan
istan, Andrei Sakharov was arrested
and exiled to the city of Gorky. Since
that time he has been kept there,
isolated from everybody except his
wife. Despite his serious heart condi
tion, he has been totally deprived of
medical care. These conditions, how
ever, have not prevented him from
going on with his struggle.
Several of his articles on the im
mediate necessity of disarmament
and numerous letters to the interna
tional community have been smug
gled out of Gorky. At the same time
he kept trying to help Liza, appealing
to his colleagues and various gov
ernmental and public organizations.
In the last letter that has reached us
from Gorky he said, "I feel sur
rounded by the wall of incom
prehension, indifference, and passiv
ity. The tragedy of Liza and Alexei is
going on and might, if nothing
changes, go on fora very long time.
In this extreme situation, after long
and painful consideration, I and my
wife Elena Bonner, invalid of the Sec
ond World War, have decided to be
gin a hunger strike on the 22nd of
November, demanding immediate
permission for Liza to emigrate from
the Soviet Union.
"Informing you of our decision, I
hope you will correctly understand
our motivation in taking such a step
and its inherent necessity to us in this
tragic situation. In the past I fasted on
behalf,of the prisoners of conscience
in the U.S.S.R. I consider the defense
of our children as important as the
defense of other victims of any
wrongdoing, but in this case it was
meand my public activity that caused
a human suffering."
Last Saturday, on the 13th day of
their hunger strike, they were taken
to the hospital by the KGB where
they are reportedly being force-fed.
In the past few years I have come to

know the Sakharovs very well. They
make their decisions after very
careful and serious consideration,
but having made such decisions, fol
low them to the end despite the fact
that they could cost them their free
dom or even their lives.
We cannot afford to let these peo
ple perish. The only way to save them
is for us to take on their struggle, to
clearly show them that our fight will
go on until Liza is free. The most im
portant concern of every human
rights activist in the Soviet Union is
often expressed in the question "If
not me, then who?" We can provide
the Sakharovs with the answer to this
question. Tomorrow a number of
prominent scientists and I will partic
ipate in a symbolic 24-hour hunger
strike (which coincides with Human
Rights Day), and it is my hope that all
who are concerned will join in.
