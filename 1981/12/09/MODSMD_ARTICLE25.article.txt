## Apply pride, respect to salve fall blues 
### 
At first glance, the Stanford community is a little
overwhelming. It is dormitories, an industrial park,
a hospital, a law school, a classroom building, a
theater — and the Hoover Institution! Tothe new
corner, viewing it as from the outside, it may even
appear so complex as to be intimidating.
Yet members of the community have a different
vantage point. As faculty, staff, administrators and
students become more involved and more familiar
with Stanford, it assumes a different scale — ceas
ing to be so vast, and becoming a smallerand more
personal community. Several of itsqualitiesarees
pecially important to our lives here.
First, the atmosphere Is one of concern and re
spect for others. We are proud of that tradition —
especially in view of the temptations to lead self
centered lives under circumstances where many of
us have few responsibilities outside our own con
cerns for schoolwork, jobs and activities. Second,
we have access to some of the finest academic re
sources in the country, in an environment that en
courages exchange among peers. And, as an extra,
we are able to pursue athletic interests in a favor
able climate and in a setting where vigor and
health are valued qualities.
There are, of course, consequences of this small
and personalside of our community. When we ex
perience defeat or tragedy, there is compassion for

those involved, and — sometimes — a more gener
al sense of discouragement. It is this last concern
that prompts this letter.
This has been an eventful, up-and-down quar
ter. Perhaps it was encapsulated in the events im
mediately surrounding Big Game. The largestturn
out of voters in nine years confirmed "Cardinal" as
our mascot; we then chartered buses to a spirit
filled rally in San Francisco; we forgot ourselves in
the City, destroying a not inconsiderable amount
of public and private property; and we defeated
Cal on the football field the following day. Some
good news, some bad news — none of it, perhaps,
of cosmic significance.
But more serious and troubling events charac
terized the early part of November: a tragic auto
accident and a disturbing series of rapes on cam
pus. Our distress, however, generated positive ef
forts by the entire community — a rally, an educa
tional forum, self-help and tighter security. In
deed, the friends and parents of students involved
in all these tragedies summoned extraordinary for
titude and showed that adversity, difficult as it may
be, is not without its noble moments.
In short, we've had tragedy and thoughtless be
havior in some abundance, and we've all felt down
at certain times during the quarter. So what do we
do about that?
For one thing, we need to summon our personal

pride in Stanford and in our community. While the
importance of self-governance here is clear and
has endured the test of time, everyone needs to
articulate repeatedly the connection between self
governance and the obligations it places upon all
of us to be considerate in our individual and col
lective actions. In succinct form, the Fundamental
Standard (and itsacademiccounterpart, the Honor
Code) remind us that
Students at Stanford are expected to show
both within and without the University such
respect for order, morality, personal honor
and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to do so will be suffi
cient cause for removal from the University.
This mutual respect for individuality and inde
pendence has been the hallmark of our life togeth
er; it must be protected to maintain an adequately
structured, enjoyable environment for the entire
Stanford community. We urge that everyone com
mit himself or herself in the time ahead to coupling
individuality and independence with renewed at
tention to thoughtfulness and care in our relations
with one another.
