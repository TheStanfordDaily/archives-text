## Tragic irony of pro-choice: no right has value if you're dead 
### 
My sentiments toward abortion are no
longer neutral, as they were one year ago.
My present position is derived from a series
of observations and facts that I have eval
uated as well as from several questions I
asked myself. Many of us feel that the Su
preme Court settled this issue in 1973 and are
thus satisfied to accept abortion as legitimate
simply because it is legal. This bothers me.
What would we say if armed robbery was
made legal? My objective in writing this arti
cle is not so much to convince, but rather to
provoke thought and questioning.
Too often, we base our opinions on emo
tion rather than reason and the first problem
with abortion is that its acceptance is based
on such an emotional appeal. Pro-abortion
(pro-choice) almost invariably includes (and
sometimes centers its argument around) two
extremes. These are the cases of pregnancy
caused by rape or incest, and instances
where the mother's life is endangered. Iron
ically, these cases, cited so frequently, occur
very rarely.
Less than one-tenth of a percent of all
abortions each year are done to save the
mother's life. Rape, according to a
gynecologist at the Stanford Medical Center,
accounts for less than 5 percent. Each year in
the United States, we abort 1.2 million preg
nancies. At the risk of appearing insensitive, I
would like to put the two above cases aside
and look to the remaining 95 percent.
Another tenet of pro-abortionist reason

ing is reflected in its strange regard for the
unborn in general and the unborn handi
capped in particular. By aborting the handi
capped and those subject to abuse, they
maintain, we prevent "unwanted" children
from living "unhappy" lives. This seems
quite benevolent until we consider the fol
lowing.
• Statistics suggest that legalized abortion
has actually contributed to child abuse. In
1972, one year before the monumental Su
preme Court decision, there were 60,000 re
ported cases of child abuse in the United
States. By 1976, the figure had risen to
500,000. I realize that this is merely sug
gestive. Nevertheless, I find the coincidence
alarming.
• The "unwanted" child is a myth, as any
adoption agency would attest. According to
the Children's Home society in San Jose, the
waiting list is between six and eight years for
parents who want to adopt a healthy,
Caucasian child (a 15 to 1 ratio). The ratio falls
when we consider minorities and the handi
capped, but a representative maintained
that "generally speaking, there are no un
wanted children."
• As for individuals who will be born deaf,
blind, retarded, etc., we need to ask
ourselves if they will actually live "mean
ingless," "unhappy" lives. A short walk
around the Stanford campus would answer
this question.
No abortion argument is complete

without addressing the question of whether
a zygote, embryo, fetus, etc. inside the
womb is human, and thus deserves human
rights. Let me first say that if these beings are
indeed human, we are murdering 1.2 million
innocent victims each year. There are about
a half dozen approaches we can take in
trying to answer this (i.e., religious, his
torical, economic, moral, logical, etc.).
Historically, Western culture has based its
fundamental moral values upon a Judeo-
Christian etfhic, which stresses the sanctity,
uniqueness and irreplacability of human life
from conception. This is reflected above, as
well as in the Declaration of Geneva, mod
eled in 1948 after the ancient Hippocratic
Oath and adopted by some 30 medical
schools. It includes the line: "I will maintain
the utmost respect for human life from con
ception.
So what is life?
With nothing higher than human
judgment on which to make such fun
damental decisions, the very concepts of
crime, murder and rights lose their absolute
meaning. The result is confusion and con
tradiction. In arriving at the decision which
legalized abortion, the Supreme Court con
cluded: "We need not resolve the difficult
question of when (human) life begins. When
those trained in the respective disciplines of
medicine, philosophy and theology are un
able to arrive at any conclusions, the judi
ciary, at this point in man's knowledge, is not

in a position to speculate as to the answer."
They went on, however, to make such a
speculation: Human life probably begins at
six months, when the baby is realistically able
to live outside its mother.
I see in this an ominous parallel with the
rationale which was used to justify the
enslavement of blacks. In order to maintain
Southern plantation society, we had to ul
timately convince ourselves that the black
man did not deserve equal protection under
a constitution which guaranteed equal rights
(i.e. right to life, liberty and property) to all
men. Thus, we relegated Negroes to sub-hu
man status. Women, until recently, have suf
fered from the same injustice. Now it is un
born babies. The justifications? It is signifi
cant that in 1971, medical schools began to
delete from the Declaration of Geneva the
phrase "from conception." "I will maintain
the utmost respect for human life ..
It seems so ludicrous to call a tiny, two
celled egg, human. Yet ours is the first gener
ation to pointthisout. Have we suddenly dis
covered a hidden truth that has escaped the
rest of mankind for thousands of years, or is
this the first step in the direction of moral
digression?
What is a human? Who deserves human
rights? The "viability argument," proposed
and implemented by the Supreme Court,
seems rational, or at least a good com
promise, until we ask whether human rights
are functions of progression in medical tech

nology. Twenty years ago, the earliest a baby
could live outside the womb was 33 weeks.
We can now successfully deliver babies at
five months. If an artificial womb is de
veloped, this age may drop to one month.
Those who claim that a "person" (a being
with human rights) must demonstrate at
tributes such as consciousness, reason, self
motivation, self-awareness, etc. are implicit
ly espousing infanticide and child abuse. Just
as an eight month-old baby inside the womb
does not satisfy these criteria, an infant
which is one month past the delivery table
cannot either.
Pro-abortionists finally seek shelter in the
Privacy Act (perhaps as a last resort) and as
sert that women should have complete con
trol over their own bodies. Yet if we took this
to its logical extremes, prostitution and hero
in, as well as abortion, would hsve to be
made legal. Another question they ask is
"what right do you have to impose your
moral values on me?" None, I guess. Never
theless, I would find it shocking if a woman
castigated me after rescuing her from rape
because I had interfered by "imposing my
moral values" upon the rapist.
In conclusion, I see in abortion a sad trend
that demands protection of rights at the ex
pense of innocent life. The irony of pro
choice is that no right, including the right to
choose, is of any value if you are dead.

a half dozen approaches we can take in
trying to answer this (i.e., religious, his
torical, economic, moral, logical, etc.).
Historically, Western culture has based its
fundamental moral values upon a Judeo-
Christian etfhic, which stresses the sanctity,
uniqueness and irreplacability of human life
from conception. This is reflected above, as
well as in the Declaration of Geneva, mod
eled in 1948 after the ancient Hippocratic
Oath and adopted by some 30 medical
schools. It includes the line: "I will maintain
the utmost respect for human life from con
ception.
So what is life?
With nothing higher than human
judgment on which to make such fun
damental decisions, the very concepts of
crime, murder and rights lose their absolute
meaning. The result is confusion and con
tradiction. In arriving at the decision which
legalized abortion, the Supreme Court con
cluded: "We need not resolve the difficult
question of when (human) life begins. When
those trained in the respective disciplines of
medicine, philosophy and theology are un
able to arrive at any conclusions, the judi
ciary, at this point in man's knowledge, is not

in a position to speculate as to the answer."
They went on, however, to make such a
speculation: Human life probably begins at
six months, when the baby is realistically able
to live outside its mother.
I see in this an ominous parallel with the
rationale which was used to justify the
enslavement of blacks. In order to maintain
Southern plantation society, we had to ul
timately convince ourselves that the black
man did not deserve equal protection under
a constitution which guaranteed equal rights
(i.e. right to life, liberty and property) to all
men. Thus, we relegated Negroes to sub-hu
man status. Women, until recently, have suf
fered from the same injustice. Now it is un
born babies. The justifications? It is signifi
cant that in 1971, medical schools began to
delete from the Declaration of Geneva the
phrase "from conception." "I will maintain
the utmost respect for human life ..
It seems so ludicrous to call a tiny, two
celled egg, human. Yet ours is the first gener
ation to pointthisout. Have we suddenly dis
covered a hidden truth that has escaped the
rest of mankind for thousands of years, or is
this the first step in the direction of moral
digression?
What is a human? Who deserves human
rights? The "viability argument," proposed
and implemented by the Supreme Court,
seems rational, or at least a good com
promise, until we ask whether human rights
are functions of progression in medical tech

nology. Twenty years ago, the earliest a baby
could live outside the womb was 33 weeks.
We can now successfully deliver babies at
five months. If an artificial womb is de
veloped, this age may drop to one month.
Those who claim that a "person" (a being
with human rights) must demonstrate at
tributes such as consciousness, reason, self
motivation, self-awareness, etc. are implicit
ly espousing infanticide and child abuse. Just
as an eight month-old baby inside the womb
does not satisfy these criteria, an infant
which is one month past the delivery table
cannot either.
Pro-abortionists finally seek shelter in the
Privacy Act (perhaps as a last resort) and as
sert that women should have complete con
trol over their own bodies. Yet if we took this
to its logical extremes, prostitution and hero
in, as well as abortion, would hsve to be
made legal. Another question they ask is
"what right do you have to impose your
moral values on me?" None, I guess. Never
theless, I would find it shocking if a woman
castigated me after rescuing her from rape
because I had interfered by "imposing my
moral values" upon the rapist.
In conclusion, I see in abortion a sad trend
that demands protection of rights at the ex
pense of innocent life. The irony of pro
choice is that no right, including the right to
choose, is of any value if you are dead.

My sentiments toward abortion are no
longer neutral, as they were one year ago.
My present position is derived from a series
of observations and facts that I have eval
uated as well as from several questions I
asked myself. Many of us feel that the Su
preme Court settled this issue in 1973 and are
thus satisfied to accept abortion as legitimate
simply because it is legal. This bothers me.
What would we say if armed robbery was
made legal? My objective in writing this arti

provoke thought and questioning.
Too often, we base our opinions on emo
tion rather than reason and the first problem
with abortion is that its acceptance is based
on such an emotional appeal. Pro-abortion
(pro-choice) almost invariably includes (and
sometimes centers its argument around) two
extremes. These are the cases of pregnancy
caused by rape or incest, and instances
where the mother's life is endangered. Iron
ically, these cases, cited so frequently, occur
very rarely.
Less than one-tenth of a percent of all
abortions each year are done to save the
mother's life. Rape, according to a
gynecologist at the Stanford Medical Center,
accounts for less than 5 percent. Each year in
the United States, we abort 1.2 million preg
nancies. At the risk of appearing insensitive, I
would like to put the two above cases aside
and look to the remaining 95 percent.
Another tenet of pro-abortionist reason

ing is reflected in its strange regard for the
unborn in general and the unborn handi
capped in particular. By aborting the handi
capped and those subject to abuse, they
maintain, we prevent "unwanted" children
from living "unhappy" lives. This seems
quite benevolent until we consider the fol
lowing.
• Statistics suggest that legalized abortion
has actually contributed to child abuse. In
1972, one year before the monumental Su
preme Court decision, there were 60,000 re
ported cases of child abuse in the United
States. By 1976, the figure had risen to
500,000. I realize that this is merely sug
gestive. Nevertheless, I find the coincidence
alarming.
• The "unwanted" child is a myth, as any
adoption agency would attest. According to
the Children's Home society in San Jose, the
waiting list is between six and eight years for
parents who want to adopt a healthy,
Caucasian child (a 15 to 1 ratio). The ratio falls
when we consider minorities and the handi
capped, but a representative maintained
that "generally speaking, there are no un
wanted children."
• As for individuals who will be born deaf,
blind, retarded, etc., we need to ask
ourselves if they will actually live "mean
ingless," "unhappy" lives. A short walk
around the Stanford campus would answer
this question.
No abortion argument is complete

without addressing the question of whether
a zygote, embryo, fetus, etc. inside the
womb is human, and thus deserves human
rights. Let me first say that if these beings are

Pro-abortionists finally seek shelter in the
Privacy Act (perhaps as a last resort) and as
sert that women should have complete con
trol over their own bodies. Yet if we took this
to its logical extremes, prostitution and hero
in, as well as abortion, would hsve to be
made legal. Another question they ask is
"what right do you have to impose your
moral values on me?" None, I guess. Never
theless, I would find it shocking if a woman
castigated me after rescuing her from rape
because I had interfered by "imposing my
moral values" upon the rapist.
In conclusion, I see in abortion a sad trend
that demands protection of rights at the ex
pense of innocent life. The irony of pro
choice is that no right, including the right to
choose, is of any value if you are dead.
