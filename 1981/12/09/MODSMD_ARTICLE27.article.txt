Conservatism doesn't affect Hoover's objectivity or quality

I am getting a bit tired of unin
formed appraisals of the Hoover In
stitution that have appeared in the
Daily and other media. With respect
to some issues raised, the facts, as I
know them, are as follows:
• Quality of Hoover scholars —By
all external criteria used to evaluate
academic quality, Hoover is one of
the leading social science institutions
in the country.
One indicator often employed in
judging institutions is membership in
national honorific societies such as
the National Academy of Sciences
and the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences. Although the former is
primarily limited to natural scientists,
seven Hoover fellows have been
elected to membership: Kenneth Ar
row, Kingsley Davis, Milton Fried
man, Alex Inkeles, S.M. Lipset, James
March and Edward Teller.
Hoover fellows in the American
Academy include, in addition to the
seven who are also in the National
Academy, Heinz Eulau, William
Goode, Sidney Hook and Robert

Ward.
Three persons elected to the presi
dency of the American Political Sci
ence Association are affiliated with
Hoover: Eulau, Lipset and Ward,
while a fourth, Emeritus Prof. Gabriel
Almond, who also belongs tothe Na
tional and American Academies, has
received a major research grant from
the Institution. Two of Hoover's
economists received a Nobel Prize,
Arrow and Friedman. Two Hoover
sociologists, Davis and Goode, have
been presidents of the American So
ciological Association.
• Politics of Hoover scholars —
There can be little doubt that the po
litical opinions of Hoover fellows are,
on the average, more conservative
than those of most academic social
scientists. As has been documented
in various research studies on the
politics of academe, the large majori
ty of American social scientists are
Democrats, and many identify them
selves politically as liberal or left. I
have no equivalent quantitative data
for Hoover, but from what I know of

the views of my colleagues, they
range from socialist to conservative
Republican. I do not know how Hoo
ver scholars voted in 1980, whether
Ronald Reagan received a majority of
their votes, or not. Certainly Jimmy
Carter and John Anderson were pub
licly supported by a number of Hoo
ver fellows. The day following Fran
cois Mitterrand's election, I ran into
two Hoover colleagues of French
background in a local French restau
rant enthusiastically celebrating the
election of their nation's first socialist
president.
• Hoover and the Reagan adminis
tration — Clearly, a number of Hoo
ver administrators and scholars have
advised the administration formally
and informally. Many do not. Two
Hoover staff hold major appoint
ments, Martin Anderson and Darrell
Trent. A few others hold less impor
tant positions in the administration.
The press, however, has seen fit to
exaggerate the number of Hoover
people in Washington by citing ap

pointees with any sort of past link to
Hoover as part of Hoover's contribu
tion to the administration. Thus,
Richard Allen, who served at Hoover
for two years more than 15 years ago,
is repeatedly credited to Hoover, al
though prior to entering the govern
ment he had been a business consul
tant for many years, lived in Washing
ton, and had an academic tie to
Georgetown Univeristy.
Hoover fellows are, as noted, more
conservative on the average, than
other groups of social scientists, but
so are the members of many eco
nomics departments across the coun
try. It is no secret that political views
influence the academicjudgmentsof
social scientists, but most of them,
whether left, right or center, attempt
to be objective in their scholarly
work and in appraisals of prospective
colleagues.

Human Rights day
Dec. 10, 1981 marks the 33rd an
niversary of the signing of the United
Nations Universal Declaration of Hu
man Rights at the 1948 UNESCO con
ference in Paris. Despite the ex
istence of this international accord,
violations of human rights still per
vade many parts of the world.
The disappearance of Carlos Hum
berto Contreras Maluje is typical of
incidents in many countries today.
On Nov. 3,1976, Contreras, a Chilean
pharmacist, was abducted by four
men following a street accident in
which he was seriously injured. As he
was forced into a car, Contreras was
able to shout out that he was being
arrested by the Chilean secret police
(Direccion de Inteligencia Nacional-
DINA), that he had been tortured by
DINA, and that witnesses should in
form his family of the incident. The
abduction was corroborated by sev
eral witnesses, including a police of
ficer. His family has not seen him

since. The authorities have denied
that they are holding him.
Amnesty International estimates
that as many as 1500 Chileans, 15,000
Argentineans, and 30,000
Guatemalans have "disappeared"
during the last 15 years. It is believed
that more than 100,000 (and perhaps
as many as 500,000) Ugandans have
"disappeared" since 1969.
What can be done to eliminate this
pervasive violation of human rights?
Protests, publicity campaigns and let
ter-writing campaigns have proven
to be effective ways of obtaining in
formation and releases. By partici
pating in Amnesty International, a
nonpartisan organization devoted to
working toward universal human
rights, you can become a part of a
concerted effort by people from all
over the world to aid victims of hu
man rights violations.
