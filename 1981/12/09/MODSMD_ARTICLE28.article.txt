## Cole and Bergstrom Reflections on a Stanford fall 
### 
As fall quarter and 1981 draw to a
close, we feel that it is necessary to
take the time to reflect on Stanford
life. Too often we take where we live
and what we do for granted; al
though we strive not to admit it,
there is a real world beyond Stanford,
and we are an integral part of this real
world. This fall many of us have been
exposed to a dose of the "real
world": Stanford has been the victim
of a shattering car accident and a
frightening increase in the number
of rapes; attempts to increase public
awareness of world hunger were rel
atively unsuccessful, while Stanford
students remained mired in a quest
for personal fulfillment. A caveat to
this column: we recognize that the
inherent flaw of all social commen
taries is an inability to maintain a high
degree of objectivity: where you
stand depends on where you sit, and
we are just as subjective as anyone
else in our observations.
World Hunger Day represented an
attempt to focus our attention out
side our community on a problem of
worldwide scope. It isa sad commen
tary on us that while 84,000 people
will turn out to see a 3-7 Stanford
football team play in the rain, less
than 20 percent of the Stanford com
munity could be persuaded to fast for
a single day. It is not that we dislike
football; we were at the game too,
but perhaps a re-evaluation of our
priorities is necessary. When most
people at Stanford will not fast fora
single day, can any one of us even
comprehend what it is like to go hun
gry fora lifetime?
Daily life at Stanford is not hinged
around survival — we are not to be
concerned with issues such as food,
shelter and clothing: they are all pro
vided. The fact that Stanford is not
the oasis we imagine was borne out

tragically this fall by the car accident
that claimed the lives of two fellow
students. The facts surrounding the
accident are readily known: Stanford
students were drinking and driving.
There were no exogenous variables.
This is considered a criminal sin, but
to a lesser extent a social sin, which is
discouraged by society but com
mitted all too often by Stanford stu-

dents. However callous our in
terpretations of the events surround
ing this accident may appear, they
strive to be objective. It is hard for us
to realize, from our sheltered per
spective, that some of the choices we
make have consequences that we
cannot comprehend or control.
For most of us, the "life or death"
choices which command our atten
tion are all too familiar: "Should I live
on or off campus next year?" or,
"How should I fulfill the non-
Western Culture requirement?" Re
cently a good friend of ours was dis
traught at the possibility of not being
admitted to Florence winter term —
for her, the "life or death" question
was, "Should I go to Europe in three
weeks or three months?" While
these questions are important, per
haps it is time to invoke Shakespeare
and look at the forest instead of the
trees.
Stanford is vulnerable to the same

problems which affect the "real
world"; all to frequently this fall we
have been reminded of this truism by
the alarming number of on-campus
rapes. The response to this problem
has been uncharacteristically sub
stantive: ASSU whistles, public
education and noon rallies com
bined to make this one of the few in
stances in which the Stanford com-

munity has shown thought and fore
sight intoa "real" issue — does it real
ly take violence and violation to
bring us to this awareness? And yet it
is ironic that when a campus fraterni
ty takes initiative and tries to raise
funds for the escort service through
the publication of a calendar, they
are attacked by the very segment of
the population they were trying to
protect. Cannot people see beyond
their petty differences to work fora
common good?
We could go on — the fields of
energy conservation and political
awareness are too often neglected
on this campus — but we hope that
the point has been made. Isn't it time
we all spent a few months and took a
step backward to discover where we
really are?

As fall quarter and 1981 draw to a
close, we feel that it is necessary to
take the time to reflect on Stanford
life. Too often we take where we live
and what we do for granted; al
though we strive not to admit it,
there is a real world beyond Stanford,
and we are an integral part of this real
world. This fall many of us have been
exposed to a dose of the "real
world": Stanford has been the victim
of a shattering car accident and a
frightening increase in the number
of rapes; attempts to increase public
awareness of world hunger were rel
atively unsuccessful, while Stanford
students remained mired in a quest
for personal fulfillment. A caveat to
this column: we recognize that the
inherent flaw of all social commen
taries is an inability to maintain a high
degree of objectivity: where you
stand depends on where you sit, and
we are just as subjective as anyone
else in our observations.
World Hunger Day represented an
attempt to focus our attention out
side our community on a problem of
worldwide scope. It isa sad commen
tary on us that while 84,000 people
will turn out to see a 3-7 Stanford
football team play in the rain, less
than 20 percent of the Stanford com
munity could be persuaded to fast for
a single day. It is not that we dislike
football; we were at the game too,
but perhaps a re-evaluation of our
priorities is necessary. When most
people at Stanford will not fast fora
single day, can any one of us even
comprehend what it is like to go hun
gry fora lifetime?
Daily life at Stanford is not hinged
around survival — we are not to be
concerned with issues such as food,
shelter and clothing: they are all pro
vided. The fact that Stanford is not
the oasis we imagine was borne out

tragically this fall by the car accident
that claimed the lives of two fellow
students. The facts surrounding the
accident are readily known: Stanford
students were drinking and driving.
There were no exogenous variables.
This is considered a criminal sin, but
to a lesser extent a social sin, which is
discouraged by society but com
mitted all too often by Stanford stu-

dents. However callous our in
terpretations of the events surround
ing this accident may appear, they
strive to be objective. It is hard for us
to realize, from our sheltered per
spective, that some of the choices we
make have consequences that we
cannot comprehend or control.
For most of us, the "life or death"
choices which command our atten
tion are all too familiar: "Should I live
on or off campus next year?" or,
"How should I fulfill the non-
Western Culture requirement?" Re
cently a good friend of ours was dis
traught at the possibility of not being
admitted to Florence winter term —
for her, the "life or death" question
was, "Should I go to Europe in three
weeks or three months?" While
these questions are important, per
haps it is time to invoke Shakespeare
and look at the forest instead of the
trees.
Stanford is vulnerable to the same

problems which affect the "real
world"; all to frequently this fall we
have been reminded of this truism by
the alarming number of on-campus
rapes. The response to this problem
has been uncharacteristically sub
stantive: ASSU whistles, public
education and noon rallies com
bined to make this one of the few in
stances in which the Stanford com-

munity has shown thought and fore
sight intoa "real" issue — does it real
ly take violence and violation to
bring us to this awareness? And yet it
is ironic that when a campus fraterni
ty takes initiative and tries to raise
funds for the escort service through
the publication of a calendar, they
are attacked by the very segment of
the population they were trying to
protect. Cannot people see beyond
their petty differences to work fora
common good?
We could go on — the fields of
energy conservation and political
awareness are too often neglected
on this campus — but we hope that
the point has been made. Isn't it time
we all spent a few months and took a
step backward to discover where we
really are?
