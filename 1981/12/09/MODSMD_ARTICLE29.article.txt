Trashing of Aquatic Park childish

I have just been walking in Aquatic
Park and have seen how it was
"trashed" by the Stanford University
students after their (Nov. 20) rally.
Thev left hundreds of bottles of beer,
champagne, paper cups, papers, etc.
all over the beach and what was grass
before this onslaught. They have de
stroyed thousands of dollars worth of
grass, just turning into mud what was
a beautiful area . . . and all with per
mission, I understand? The gardeners
were very upset and told me that the
students get permission to do this ev
ery year. I have never seen such ir
responsibility. All the so-called hip
pies and undesirables who hang
around Aquatic Park have never
done such damage since I have been
walking along this area, which is
about 22 years. I am also going to
send a copy of this letter to Mayor

Diane Feinstein, and Herb Caen, so
that everyone is aware of what is
going on with our darling privileged
Stanford "children."

Hoover confusion
The recent article on the Hoover
Institution (Daily, Nov. 18) revealed a
great deal about its subtle rela
tionship with the University. I found
Prof. Alexander Dallin's critique of
the controversial ties between the
two to be essentially correct: the is
sue is not the ideological bent of the
senior fellows who comprise the In
stitution's research operations, but
whether the undeniable identi
fication of Hoover to Stanford and
the strong financial support Stanford

provides the Institution is a proper
relation of the University.
Hoover has, at least outwardly, be
come aligned with Stanford. By phys
ically occupying University build
ings, securing nearly one-third of its
operating budget from University
funds, and sharing the landmark im
age which nationally represents the
University, the Hoover Institution
has gained tacit representation of the
political views of Stanford.
The point is that no political orien
tation, whether deliberately or not,
has the right to assume representa
tion or claim acceptance of the di
verse views of Stanford students and
faculty. And Hoover currently has
that role.
