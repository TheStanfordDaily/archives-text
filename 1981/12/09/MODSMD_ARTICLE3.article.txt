### Liz Rosner 
Addressing the current hunger
strike of Nobel Peace Prize winner
Andrei Sakharov and his own ex
patriation, Soviet dissident Lev
Kopelev Monday called Sakharov a
"mild, meek man . . . but he is hard as
diamond, the best man in Russia to
day." Kopelev spoke Monday after
noon to a group of about 50 people
in the de Basily room of Hoover To
wer.
Sakharov, a nuclear physicist and
one of the creators of the Soviet
hydrogen bomb, was exiled to Gorky
nearly two years ago for his human
rights activities.
Kopelev, who was deprived of his
Soviet citizenship nearly one year
ago, began hi-. Informal speech by
discussing the most.recent news of
the Sakharovs. Both Sakharov and his
wife have been fasting since Nov. 22

in an attempt to pressure the Kremlin
into letting their daughter-in-law,
Liza Alexeyeva, emigrate to the Unit
ed States to join her husband.
According to Kopelev, the latest
report from foreign correspondents
in Moscow revealed that the couple
is in a cardiological unit of a hospital
in Gorky, and one friend who was
permitted to visit the Sakharovs last
week told Alexeyeva that they were
in "very bad condition . . . Andrei
couldn't move and said, 'I dream
only to die as soon as possible.' "
Kopelev said that Alexeyeva has been
invited to go to the visa department,
and added that "If Liza (Alexeyeva)
can go tomorrow, Sakharov will end
his hunger strike."
Kopelev went on to explain the ur
gent need for help from American
scientists; he appealed for "as many
good signatures as possible" to ac

company two cables being sent to
the Soviet Union, one to be sent to
Brezhnev and the other to be sent to
several members of the Academy of
Science. Both cables are appeals on
behalf of Sakharov.
Kopelev said that "the protests of
scientists are more influential than
the protests of literary people be
cause even the stupidest officials
know that they need certain things
from American know-how." When
one listener asked why there has
been no significant protest made to
the Kremlin by Soviet scientists,
Kopelev said, "You people can't un
derstand the situation in our country
. . . Without free speech, free press,
they dare not speak openly. Sakharov
is a b**ro for speaking openly; that
makes the difference between him
and others."
