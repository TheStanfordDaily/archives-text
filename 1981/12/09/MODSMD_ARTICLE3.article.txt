# Soviet pleads for Sakharovs
## 
### Liz Rosner 
Addressing the current hunger
strike of Nobel Peace Prize winner
Andrei Sakharov and his own ex
patriation, Soviet dissident Lev
Kopelev Monday called Sakharov a
"mild, meek man . . . but he is hard as
diamond, the best man in Russia to
day." Kopelev spoke Monday after
noon to a group of about 50 people
in the de Basily room of Hoover To
wer.
Sakharov, a nuclear physicist and
one of the creators of the Soviet
hydrogen bomb, was exiled to Gorky
nearly two years ago for his human
rights activities.
Kopelev, who was deprived of his
Soviet citizenship nearly one year
ago, began hi-. Informal speech by
discussing the most.recent news of
the Sakharovs. Both Sakharov and his
wife have been fasting since Nov. 22

in an attempt to pressure the Kremlin
into letting their daughter-in-law,
Liza Alexeyeva, emigrate to the Unit
ed States to join her husband.
According to Kopelev, the latest
report from foreign correspondents
in Moscow revealed that the couple
is in a cardiological unit of a hospital
in Gorky, and one friend who was
permitted to visit the Sakharovs last
week told Alexeyeva that they were
in "very bad condition . . . Andrei
couldn't move and said, 'I dream
only to die as soon as possible.' "
Kopelev said that Alexeyeva has been
invited to go to the visa department,
and added that "If Liza (Alexeyeva)
can go tomorrow, Sakharov will end
his hunger strike."
Kopelev went on to explain the ur
gent need for help from American
scientists; he appealed for "as many
good signatures as possible" to ac

company two cables being sent to
the Soviet Union, one to be sent to
Brezhnev and the other to be sent to
several members of the Academy of
Science. Both cables are appeals on
behalf of Sakharov.
Kopelev said that "the protests of
scientists are more influential than
the protests of literary people be
cause even the stupidest officials
know that they need certain things
from American know-how." When
one listener asked why there has
been no significant protest made to
the Kremlin by Soviet scientists,
Kopelev said, "You people can't un
derstand the situation in our country
. . . Without free speech, free press,
they dare not speak openly. Sakharov
is a b**ro for speaking openly; that
makes the difference between him
and others."
Another audience member sug
gested that the Soviet Academy of
Science still deserves credit for
withstanding pressure from the
Kremlin to expel Sakharov from the
Academy. Kopelev agreed, adding,
"Out of 250 members, they (the Sovi
et government) found 73 to sign (a
petition to expel Sakharov). Why? All
of them are chiefs of Institutes, mem
bers with official posts who didn't
want to lose them."
Kopelev answered questions re
garding the repeated "liquidations"
of the dissident movement, referring
to a history of "funerals" dating back
to 1963. "We have no Gallup,"
Kopelev said, "I know only from
rumors . . . But there are realistic
rumors." As an example of the re
silience of the dissident movement,
Kopelev cited the fact that the single
periodical of 1969-70, Chronicle of
Human Rights, has grown to more
than 30 periodicals based in numer
ous cities throughout Russia and
Eastern Europe.
Kopelev's own expatriation came
about after he and his wife went to

visit Germany in November 1980, un
der a "gentlemen's agreement" with
Soviet officials who said the Kopelevs
could return provided they did not
participate in any anti-Soviet ac
tivities while abroad. Arriving in
Frankfurt, Kopelev had insisted "We
came here to see and not to show, to
study and not to teach, to listen and
not to speak." Still, on Jan. 22, 1981,
exactly one year after Sakharov's ex
ile to Gorky ("bureaucratic irony,"
said Kopelev), the Kopelevs received
a letter from the Soviet embassy
depriving them of their citizenship.
Kopelev described Russia as a
"corporative state . . . What
Mussolini and Hitler dreamed of,
Stalin and his colleagues have
achieved." He said that the various
"corporations — such as military of
ficers, engineers, party and union
members" are linked together
through what he called "internal
marriages — with very few holes."
Kopelev closed with a final plea for
help "from people in a free country,
from people who can write and
speak . . . Help firmly and consistent
ly."

bers with official posts who didn't
want to lose them."
Kopelev answered questions re
garding the repeated "liquidations"
of the dissident movement, referring
to a history of "funerals" dating back
to 1963. "We have no Gallup,"
Kopelev said, "I know only from
rumors . . . But there are realistic
rumors." As an example of the re
silience of the dissident movement,
Kopelev cited the fact that the single
periodical of 1969-70, Chronicle of
Human Rights, has grown to more
than 30 periodicals based in numer
ous cities throughout Russia and
Eastern Europe.
Kopelev's own expatriation came
about after he and his wife went to

visit Germany in November 1980, un
der a "gentlemen's agreement" with
Soviet officials who said the Kopelevs
could return provided they did not
participate in any anti-Soviet ac
tivities while abroad. Arriving in
Frankfurt, Kopelev had insisted "We
came here to see and not to show, to
study and not to teach, to listen and
not to speak." Still, on Jan. 22, 1981,
exactly one year after Sakharov's ex
ile to Gorky ("bureaucratic irony,"
said Kopelev), the Kopelevs received
a letter from the Soviet embassy
depriving them of their citizenship.
Kopelev described Russia as a
"corporative state . . . What
Mussolini and Hitler dreamed of,
Stalin and his colleagues have
achieved." He said that the various
"corporations — such as military of
ficers, engineers, party and union
members" are linked together
through what he called "internal
marriages — with very few holes."
Kopelev closed with a final plea for
help "from people in a free country,
from people who can write and
speak . . . Help firmly and consistent
ly."
Addressing the current hunger
strike of Nobel Peace Prize winner
Andrei Sakharov and his own ex
patriation, Soviet dissident Lev
Kopelev Monday called Sakharov a
"mild, meek man . . . but he is hard as
diamond, the best man in Russia to
day." Kopelev spoke Monday after
noon to a group of about 50 people
in the de Basily room of Hoover To
wer.
Sakharov, a nuclear physicist and
one of the creators of the Soviet
hydrogen bomb, was exiled to Gorky
nearly two years ago for his human
rights activities.
Kopelev, who was deprived of his
Soviet citizenship nearly one year
ago, began hi-. Informal speech by
discussing the most.recent news of
the Sakharovs. Both Sakharov and his
wife have been fasting since Nov. 22

in an attempt to pressure the Kremlin
into letting their daughter-in-law,
Liza Alexeyeva, emigrate to the Unit
ed States to join her husband.
According to Kopelev, the latest
report from foreign correspondents
in Moscow revealed that the couple
is in a cardiological unit of a hospital
in Gorky, and one friend who was
permitted to visit the Sakharovs last
week told Alexeyeva that they were
in "very bad condition . . . Andrei
couldn't move and said, 'I dream
only to die as soon as possible.' "
Kopelev said that Alexeyeva has been
invited to go to the visa department,
and added that "If Liza (Alexeyeva)
can go tomorrow, Sakharov will end
his hunger strike."
Kopelev went on to explain the ur
gent need for help from American
scientists; he appealed for "as many
good signatures as possible" to ac

company two cables being sent to
the Soviet Union, one to be sent to
Brezhnev and the other to be sent to
several members of the Academy of
Science. Both cables are appeals on
behalf of Sakharov.
Kopelev said that "the protests of
scientists are more influential than
the protests of literary people be
cause even the stupidest officials
know that they need certain things
from American know-how." When
one listener asked why there has
been no significant protest made to
the Kremlin by Soviet scientists,
Kopelev said, "You people can't un
derstand the situation in our country
. . . Without free speech, free press,
they dare not speak openly. Sakharov
is a b**ro for speaking openly; that
makes the difference between him
and others."
Another audience member sug
gested that the Soviet Academy of
Science still deserves credit for
withstanding pressure from the
Kremlin to expel Sakharov from the
Academy. Kopelev agreed, adding,
"Out of 250 members, they (the Sovi
et government) found 73 to sign (a
petition to expel Sakharov). Why? All
of them are chiefs of Institutes, mem
bers with official posts who didn't
want to lose them."
