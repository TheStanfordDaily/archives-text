## Violation of space is rape too 
### 
I came home yesterday seething with anger. I had
been out running, alone. I had just come to the part of
the run where I could let my guard down, where I could
relax and enjoy the run — the bushes were too small to
hide a rapist and I was on a moderately well-traveled
road, where if there was trouble, help was nearby. I was
letting my thoughts drift when I was rudely startled by a
carload of Stanford males who found it necessary to hoot
and holler at me as they rounded the corner.
I felt a rush of anger surge through me — it was the
same anger I felt when, while riding my bike, some jerk
reached out of his car to grab my rear. It was a fraction of
the same anger I felt when I read that a woman had been
raped on campus while she was out running at 10:30 in
the morning. And it was the same kind of anger I feel ev
erytime a stranger sits at my table in the Coffee House
and feels compelled to tell me how attractive he thinks I
am. In all these cases my space is being violated, I have
been objectified.
I feel raped. I feel the males in these encounters failed
to see my humanity — each of them took for granted a
need on my part to hear that I am attractive, or assumed
(or rationalized to themselves) that I really enjoy being
yelled at or goosed. They did not seem to be aware of my
need to be respected and responded to as a human
being first. They saw only my femalenessand used that as
the cue for how their behavior should be directed
toward us.
I am frustrated that so many men do n6t understand
rape. It is objectification that violates people, that chips
away at human dignity. "Little" rapes occur when a man
assumes a woman "wants" to hear that she is attractive,
no matter what the time or place is. They also occur
when a woman walks by a man and he checks her out
and wonders what it would be like to screw her. They be
come larger rapes when they take the form of street
hassling, or "soft" pornography being sold at the Tres
idder Store. The rape becomes larger when the street
hassling becomes obscene (or physical) and the porno
graphy becomes more violent. Finally at the end of this
continuum of objectification come actual physical abuse
and forced intercourse, what we traditionally think of as
rape.
Psychological studies have shown that men tend to
make external attributions when things go wrong. When
a male student fails a test, he will more often blame the
professor, the test or the grader than his own ability or

intelligence. Men tend to blame circumstances outside
of themselves for the failure, whereas women tend to
make internal (the opposite) attributions for the same
failures.
I think in very much the same manner, men seek ex
ternal gratification for their needs. They seek someone
else to make them happy, or feel good about themselves,
or understand life or deal with (or cause) their sexual
feelings.
But can people really reach out toeach other, can they
truly connect with other people before they reach inside
themselves, and connect with their own feelings? To un
derstand other people, I think we must understand
ourselves. We cannot take for granted that an assump
tion or belief is valid or that a feeling is rational just be
cause it is the societal norm or because that is the way
people have always felt. (e.g. the assumptionsthat whistl
ing at a woman is good for her self-esteem, or every
women wants to be told she's beautiful.)
I want to be a warm, caring human being. I want to give
of myself. But I cannot, merely because lama woman, be
the universal caregiver, the always patient listener or the
nurturing mother. I am not capable of giving totally and
indiscriminately to someone just because he is a male
who needs or wants me. Besides, giving indiscriminately
is a form of objectification and may not really be giving at
all. (In the same light, is having intercourse in
discriminately ever really making love?)
True caring is a willingness to give and share and be
vulnerable; it is a desire to understand and know the
multiple facets of the other person — there is no room
for objectification or assumptions in true caring.
If you are a man and are angry, I urge you to look at
that anger, try to understand it. I think I have been as
sertive, but I have tried not to be offensive. I am strong,
but I do not believe I have been abrasive. I am trying to
be confrontive without being threatening. I amsurea lot
of you feel that you are trying to be fair and open
minded and empathetic towards women. Then we come
along and tell you that you are not doing a good enough
job, that you should try harder. That should hurt, it may
make you angry. But do not let that hurt and anger give
you permission to quit trying to understand what we are
saying, or from trying to understand yourself. If you quit,
then we all lose.

or understand life or deal with (or cause) their sexual
feelings.
But can people really reach out toeach other, can they
truly connect with other people before they reach inside
themselves, and connect with their own feelings? To un
derstand other people, I think we must understand
ourselves. We cannot take for granted that an assump
tion or belief is valid or that a feeling is rational just be
cause it is the societal norm or because that is the way
people have always felt. (e.g. the assumptionsthat whistl
ing at a woman is good for her self-esteem, or every
women wants to be told she's beautiful.)
I want to be a warm, caring human being. I want to give
of myself. But I cannot, merely because lama woman, be
the universal caregiver, the always patient listener or the
nurturing mother. I am not capable of giving totally and
indiscriminately to someone just because he is a male
who needs or wants me. Besides, giving indiscriminately
is a form of objectification and may not really be giving at
all. (In the same light, is having intercourse in
discriminately ever really making love?)
True caring is a willingness to give and share and be
vulnerable; it is a desire to understand and know the
multiple facets of the other person — there is no room
for objectification or assumptions in true caring.
If you are a man and are angry, I urge you to look at
that anger, try to understand it. I think I have been as
sertive, but I have tried not to be offensive. I am strong,
but I do not believe I have been abrasive. I am trying to
be confrontive without being threatening. I amsurea lot
of you feel that you are trying to be fair and open
minded and empathetic towards women. Then we come
along and tell you that you are not doing a good enough
job, that you should try harder. That should hurt, it may
make you angry. But do not let that hurt and anger give
you permission to quit trying to understand what we are
saying, or from trying to understand yourself. If you quit,
then we all lose.

I came home yesterday seething with anger. I had
been out running, alone. I had just come to the part of
the run where I could let my guard down, where I could
relax and enjoy the run — the bushes were too small to
hide a rapist and I was on a moderately well-traveled
road, where if there was trouble, help was nearby. I was
letting my thoughts drift when I was rudely startled by a
carload of Stanford males who found it necessary to hoot
and holler at me as they rounded the corner.
I felt a rush of anger surge through me — it was the
same anger I felt when, while riding my bike, some jerk
reached out of his car to grab my rear. It was a fraction of
the same anger I felt when I read that a woman had been
raped on campus while she was out running at 10:30 in
the morning. And it was the same kind of anger I feel ev
erytime a stranger sits at my table in the Coffee House
and feels compelled to tell me how attractive he thinks I
am. In all these cases my space is being violated, I have
been objectified.
I feel raped. I feel the males in these encounters failed
to see my humanity — each of them took for granted a
need on my part to hear that I am attractive, or assumed
(or rationalized to themselves) that I really enjoy being
yelled at or goosed. They did not seem to be aware of my
need to be respected and responded to as a human
being first. They saw only my femalenessand used that as
the cue for how their behavior should be directed
toward us.
I am frustrated that so many men do n6t understand
rape. It is objectification that violates people, that chips
away at human dignity. "Little" rapes occur when a man
assumes a woman "wants" to hear that she is attractive,
no matter what the time or place is. They also occur
when a woman walks by a man and he checks her out
and wonders what it would be like to screw her. They be
come larger rapes when they take the form of street
hassling, or "soft" pornography being sold at the Tres
idder Store. The rape becomes larger when the street
hassling becomes obscene (or physical) and the porno
graphy becomes more violent. Finally at the end of this
continuum of objectification come actual physical abuse
and forced intercourse, what we traditionally think of as
rape.
Psychological studies have shown that men tend to
make external attributions when things go wrong. When
a male student fails a test, he will more often blame the
professor, the test or the grader than his own ability or

intelligence. Men tend to blame circumstances outside
of themselves for the failure, whereas women tend to
make internal (the opposite) attributions for the same
failures.
I think in very much the same manner, men seek ex
ternal gratification for their needs. They seek someone
else to make them happy, or feel good about themselves,
or understand life or deal with (or cause) their sexual
feelings.
But can people really reach out toeach other, can they
truly connect with other people before they reach inside
