## Tracey Minkin 'Twas the night before Christmas 
### 
'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the na
tion
The halls were quite decked; every radio station
Blared out yuletide tunes, from Springsteen to Handel,
Shopping malls sported huge red plastic candles. Gifts
bought and given, "Financial redress
Will be coming," grins battered American Express.
But finally all quiet from East coast to West,
The Reagans all snuggled in their capitol nest,
Green p.j.'s for Ronnie, and Nancy in red,
While visions of jellybeans danced 'round their heads.
Even the Statue of Liberty dozed,
When from out in the harbor a clamor arose.
She near dropped her torch for she had such a start,
But regained her balance while grabbing her heart,
"Who goes there, speak up now! What do you intend?
Oh Santa, it's you! You don't look so good, friend.
What's happened my dear? Who's done this to you?"
For the Santa before her wasn't the Santa she knew.
This new man was thin, his red coat had faded,
The old cherub face looked a little bit jaded.
His blue eyes were clear but lacked their old spark,
With crescents below them a little too dark.
He seemed a bit jumpy as he jumped from his sleigh,
"Well it ain't been the best year, let's put it that way.
These new-fangled toys ain't a cinch to construct, Those
computers for kids? Now those really sucked.
But I've got this great friend," and he reached in his suit
And pulled out a vial — "You care fora toot?"
"Santa — you're daft!" our Miss Liberty cried,
Seeing the reason the old man look fried.
"Do some lines with me Libby, don't be such a Quaker,
'Cause when Santa flies he don't call Freddy Laker!"
"No, really, no thank you," she said blushing red,
"But why don't you show me your cargo instead?"
"That's cool," he conceded, wiping his nose,
"The stuff that I'm porting'll put runs in your hose!"
And he reached in the sleigh and pulled out a sack,
A bit of a grubby one, less red than black.
"Well you blew off my coke, but that's just the begin
ning,
I've got what you want for some real first-class sinning!"
He tossed at her sandled feet pills of all hues,
Cannisters, bongs, "Not to mention the booze,"
Cried the thin bearded man as he reached in once more
And set down some bottles, "Liquor galore!
Your favorite Jack Daniels? Seagram's? George Dickel?
Maybe liqueur if you tend to be fickle?

I brought it all this year, from acid to rum,
How better to handle the season than numb?
And I don't mean from the snow. Ya' dig me old girl?
We'll all get high this Christmas, c'mon, give it a whirl!"
"I'm really not sure," she said, shrinking back,
"What else, dare I ask, have you inside that sack?"
"Check this out, stone-face," he grinned, pulling out
Piles of books. "Here's what they're about...
There's this Jew and a Mexican, walking along,
and one says to the other ..." but he didn't go on
As he started to giggle, to laugh, and to shriek, "These
jokes are too funny!" he choked out, "I'm weak!"
As he rolled on her pedestal, Liberty glared,
"Ethnic jokes are not funny, you beast," she declared.
The roller in red sobered up, sat upright,
"Hold it now baby," he hissed, "Listen tight.
Things now are tough. U.S. straits are dire.
But you don't likely laugh at the man that you hire.
So there's plenty of others around who stand out,
At least far enough to make these jokes about.
It's called blowin' off steam babe, ain't really no harm,
So one Pollack joke — is that cause for alarm?"
Liberty froze, "There is something amiss,
You can't be St. Nicklaus, he wouldn't do this."
"You been readin' the papers gal, watchin' the news?
Same rancid dogshit's on everyone's shoes.
Don't lay on a trip about what's in my bag,
America asked for it, let me by, hag!"
He tried to fake past her but tripped, as he fell
His Santa face shattered, a visage from Hell
Rose up screaming from the debris, "Now looky here
bitch!
At this point does it matter who's who or who's which?
You're all gonna get it, I'm here to deliver."
"I won't let you!" she cried, repressing a shiver.
Then a tinkling of sleigh bells made the two pause,
"Hades!" spectre cried, "It's the real Santa Claus!"
And he snatched up his flotsom and jetsom to flee,
Then paused fora moment, and growled, "Liberty!
Your homeland might be for the brave and the free,
But more than you think would have loved to see me
Instead of some candy canes beside their tree.
See you next year!" as he slid into the sea.
Liberty wept, but held up her light
To help guide the real Claus down through the night.

tion
The halls were quite decked; every radio station
Blared out yuletide tunes, from Springsteen to Handel,
Shopping malls sported huge red plastic candles. Gifts
bought and given, "Financial redress
Will be coming," grins battered American Express.
But finally all quiet from East coast to West,
The Reagans all snuggled in their capitol nest,
Green p.j.'s for Ronnie, and Nancy in red,
While visions of jellybeans danced 'round their heads.
Even the Statue of Liberty dozed,
When from out in the harbor a clamor arose.
She near dropped her torch for she had such a start,
But regained her balance while grabbing her heart,
"Who goes there, speak up now! What do you intend?
Oh Santa, it's you! You don't look so good, friend.
What's happened my dear? Who's done this to you?"
For the Santa before her wasn't the Santa she knew.
This new man was thin, his red coat had faded,
The old cherub face looked a little bit jaded.
His blue eyes were clear but lacked their old spark,
With crescents below them a little too dark.
He seemed a bit jumpy as he jumped from his sleigh,
"Well it ain't been the best year, let's put it that way.
These new-fangled toys ain't a cinch to construct, Those
computers for kids? Now those really sucked.
But I've got this great friend," and he reached in his suit
And pulled out a vial — "You care fora toot?"
"Santa — you're daft!" our Miss Liberty cried,
Seeing the reason the old man look fried.
"Do some lines with me Libby, don't be such a Quaker,
'Cause when Santa flies he don't call Freddy Laker!"
"No, really, no thank you," she said blushing red,
"But why don't you show me your cargo instead?"
"That's cool," he conceded, wiping his nose,
"The stuff that I'm porting'll put runs in your hose!"
And he reached in the sleigh and pulled out a sack,
A bit of a grubby one, less red than black.
"Well you blew off my coke, but that's just the begin
ning,
I've got what you want for some real first-class sinning!"
He tossed at her sandled feet pills of all hues,
Cannisters, bongs, "Not to mention the booze,"
Cried the thin bearded man as he reached in once more
And set down some bottles, "Liquor galore!
Your favorite Jack Daniels? Seagram's? George Dickel?
Maybe liqueur if you tend to be fickle?

I brought it all this year, from acid to rum,
How better to handle the season than numb?
And I don't mean from the snow. Ya' dig me old girl?
We'll all get high this Christmas, c'mon, give it a whirl!"
"I'm really not sure," she said, shrinking back,
"What else, dare I ask, have you inside that sack?"
"Check this out, stone-face," he grinned, pulling out
Piles of books. "Here's what they're about...
There's this Jew and a Mexican, walking along,
and one says to the other ..." but he didn't go on
As he started to giggle, to laugh, and to shriek, "These
jokes are too funny!" he choked out, "I'm weak!"
As he rolled on her pedestal, Liberty glared,
"Ethnic jokes are not funny, you beast," she declared.
The roller in red sobered up, sat upright,
"Hold it now baby," he hissed, "Listen tight.
Things now are tough. U.S. straits are dire.
But you don't likely laugh at the man that you hire.
So there's plenty of others around who stand out,
At least far enough to make these jokes about.
It's called blowin' off steam babe, ain't really no harm,
So one Pollack joke — is that cause for alarm?"
Liberty froze, "There is something amiss,
You can't be St. Nicklaus, he wouldn't do this."
"You been readin' the papers gal, watchin' the news?
Same rancid dogshit's on everyone's shoes.
Don't lay on a trip about what's in my bag,
America asked for it, let me by, hag!"
He tried to fake past her but tripped, as he fell
His Santa face shattered, a visage from Hell
Rose up screaming from the debris, "Now looky here
bitch!
At this point does it matter who's who or who's which?
You're all gonna get it, I'm here to deliver."
"I won't let you!" she cried, repressing a shiver.
Then a tinkling of sleigh bells made the two pause,
"Hades!" spectre cried, "It's the real Santa Claus!"
And he snatched up his flotsom and jetsom to flee,
Then paused fora moment, and growled, "Liberty!
Your homeland might be for the brave and the free,
But more than you think would have loved to see me
Instead of some candy canes beside their tree.
See you next year!" as he slid into the sea.
Liberty wept, but held up her light
To help guide the real Claus down through the night.
