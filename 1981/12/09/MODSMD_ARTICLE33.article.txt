## Help for Nancy's jokebook 
### 
Recent word has it that Nancy Rea
gan has borrowed one of her hus
band's favorite tactics for answering
critics: she tells jokes about herself.
At last, a Reagan administration poli
cy that I can wholeheartedly support.
It's a good thing that Nancy's going
to get plenty of help on this one, be
cause she's obviously not up to the
task by herself. For one thing, she not
only adopted her husband's strategy,
she borrowed his writer as well. As a
consequence, she's been blathering
airily about her "china" policy and
carrying around Ronnie and Nancy
dolls, designer underwear and all.
Pretty stale stuff. Not even Steve
Martin could survive this routine, but
what do you expect from the only
first lady in recent history who thinks
ERA is a laundry detergent?
Another problem Nancy faces, lit
erally, is her unending and insipid
smile. Anyone who has any sense of
humor at all knows the absolute ne
cessity of an occasional and well
timed straight face. If Nancy can't
learn to put on a straight face herself,
she'll have to find a partner to do it
for her. This may indeed solve her
problem — numerous straight man
funny man (or woman) acts have en
joyed success in the past. If Nancy
wants a balanced team, though, she's
going to have to find someone who's
really straight, and everybody knows
dead people aren't funny.
All hope is not lost, however, there
is a particular brand of humor that
may suit Nancy extraordinarily well.
Anyone who has seen the death
threat-through-the-smile humor of
Betty White as the happy home
maker on the Mary Tyler Moore
show knows what I'm talking about.
As a matter of fact, one rumor has it
that the cause of Nancy's smile
(which has been fixed since approx

imately October of 1974) is her desire
to be drafted into a Betty White-type
role on a sitcom. Nancy spent so
much time smiling and waiting to be
discovered, so goes the theory, that
the muscles contracted permanently
into the distortion that we all know
and love.
Another popular cause-of-the
smile theory dates back to a little
known mishap on the ranch. It seems

I'm sure that a lot of old standbys can be
adopted: How many Nancy Reagans does it take
to screw in a light bulb? (Two: one to consult
Better Homes and Gardens and one to call the
hired help.) ...

that Nancy was cleaning a loaded
shotgun which accidently went off.
Fortunately, all fifteen pellets passed
entirely through her head and left all
of her vital organs intact. Un
fortunately, due to the medical treat
ment afterwards, she fell prey to a
disease which afflicts a growing
number of housewives every day:
Valium addiction. Hence the smile.
A final theory, which is popular
among Freudian analysts, has to do
with ego fixation. According to this
theory, Nancy, who has had no ego
of her own since about the time of
her marriage, has adopted the ego of
a favorite storybook figure — you
guess it: the Cheshire Cat. Someday,
if we're lucky, Nancy may just fade
away to that nether region of old
generals and aged politicians.
One way to resolve the smile issue
and get Nancy's comic career started
off with a bang at the same time

would be to have a Nancy roast. Don
Rickles, Dean Martin, Rodney Dan
gerfield and the gang could all getto
gether and make fun of her $209,000
china, or perhaps we could all laugh
over her $822,000 redecoration
project. I'm sure that a lot of old
standbys can be adopted: How many
Nancy Reagans does it take to screw
in a light bulb? (Two: one to consult
Better Homes and Gardens and one

to call the hired help.) What's a Nan
cy Reagan on the rocks? (One drink
and you're dizzy for the rest of your
life.) Or what's the difference be
tween Nancy Reagan and an in
flatable doll? (Nancy is the one with
the glassy eyes.) What has eight legs,
six eyes, and anl.Q.of 102 (Nancy and
Ronnie on a horse Thirty-six points
belong to the horse.) What's red and
goes around in circles? (Nancy Rea
gan in a blender.) Or did you hear
what happened when Nancy backed
into the propellor of Air Force One?
Disaster. Why did Nancy cross the
road? I don't know, but there goes
the neighborhood. Then there was
the travelling Nancy ...
Like they say, the only bad thing
about political jokes is that they get
elected. Or their husbands do.
