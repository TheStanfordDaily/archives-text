## You better watch out... Santas are everywhere!

How would you like to have your very own Santa
Claus? One who leaves you little messages and
gifts, and surprises you with festive gimmicks and
pranks.
Each year around holiday time many residences
on campus set up a "Secret Santa system." Each
participant becomes one of his classmates' Santa
Claus fora number of days, keeping his or her
identity a secret until the final revealing party.
"Gift giving" can range from traditional stocking
stuffers to unique and bizarre pranks — from little
candy Christmas trees to back rubs given by attrac
tive "elves." Outrageous gifts in the past have in
cluded roses delivered with a dozen kisses, a five
string quartet to serenade a santee, and a
scavenger hunt around San Francisco.

According to Ted Eimon, a Toyon house as
sociate (R.A.), one of the more outrageous gifts
this year occurred in an economics class, when
someone announced in the lecturer's microphone
that there was an emergency message fora mem
ber of the class. Several men in jeans, white t-shirts
and black neckties entered the lecture hall with
champagne, and presented it to the lucky santee,
with a serenade.
There's more to the tradition of secret santas
though than just the fun in receiving gifts: "It really
brings the dorm together because people are run
ning around doing things for people they don't
know," said one R.A.
Most dorms on campus participate in Secret San
tas, and most play by about the same rules. There
are, however, some exceptions. Donner, for in

stance, has two male santas for every female and
one female santa for two males, because of its ratio
of men to women. Dorms also vary in length of gift
giving, budget restraining and methods of reveal
ing the santas.
Typically, the unveiling occurs at an all-dorm
gathering, a formal dinner or party. People are
often shocked upon learning the identity of their
Santa.
One Toyon student said, "My secret santa was
my next door neighbor, and I didn't even have a
clue!"
Although no one knows exactly how or when
the Secret Santa tradition began, one can be sure it
will be a part of pre-holiday festivities for some
time to come — at least as long as finals and other
harsh realities exist.
