# A 						decade came alive during Branner's '60s Week

### Wendy Prentice 
Theodore Roszak, author of the high
ly acclaimed book The Making of a
Counter Culture, and Todd Gitlin, '60s
New Left leader and now assistant pro
fessor of sociology at UC-Berkeley, pre
sented their views on "Interpreting the
Social Revolution of the '605," in the
final segment of the '60s series held at
Branner Hall last week.
Roszak, who last spoke at Branner
lounge 21 years ago to address the prob
lem of '50s "complacency," said it had
occurred to him that "I might very well
be talking about the same things — to
day."
Roszak elaborated that the problem
in 1959 was how to make sense of a
"technocratic" society which in
corporated both affluence and horror,
exemplified by Disneyland and the
Thermonuclear Intercontinental
Ballistic Missle.
"We're still in the same technocratic
state of affairs which allows a re
markable amount of affluence and yet
ties us to the horror of possible world
annihilation," he explained. If anything
has changed over the last 21 years,

Roszak concluded that people have de
veloped a heightened awareness of the
problems of personal fulfillment and
ecology.
Focusing on the former, Roszak said
that people recognized during the '60s
that highly technocratic-industrial soci
ety required "more social regimen
tation, more discipline than many of us
were willing to give." People began to
want "to define who they were on their
own, independently of any social role
or assigned identity that was conferred
upon them or prefabricated for them
by society."
When he spoke at Branner in 1959,
"none of the young women were wear
ing anything but skirts, and there were
very strict rules about how young ladies
were to act." This, he said, was only a
minor example of the kind of yielding
to "social role playing, obedience, and
acquiescence" characteristic of a high
tech society.
The desire for "personal recogni
tion," Roszak elucidated, became par
ticularly prominent during the anti-war
movement because "the worst kind of
assigned identity for anyone to give you

is death."
In helping people find personal iden
tity, Roszak stressed that he advocates
"personalism," a "convivial" political
philosophy opposed to the individ
ualism so resurgent in the '80s, which is
"isolating, anti-social, and self-seek
ing."
Gitlin, who recently published The
Whole World is Watching: Mass Media
in the Making and Unmaking of the
New Left, suggested that people do not
give the '60s activists adequate credit
for bringing the changes of which
Roszak spoke. "It seemed that a new or
der was about to be ushered in and be
cause in the end it wasn't, it seemed to
many people — certainly to the press —
and to many people within the '60s
movement who had the highest hope
— that perhaps nothing had changed."
Gitlin said that the most prevalent
"false and misleading" interpretation
fostered by the media was that the '60s
were "a time of political idealism, but
that idealism always has to get serious in
the end." He added that the media is
largely responsible for cultivating the
image that the '60s accomplished their
goals and now with the advantage of
hindsight, we can be glad they hap

pened but equally glad that "they are
now over."
Roszak agreed: "There was a strong
thrust by the major media to bury any
thing called protest or counterculture
as rapidly as possible." Roszak said that
Time magazine ran an article in the late
'60s called "The Cooling of America"
which was published "two weeks
before the largest of all the anti-war
demonstrations took place in Washing
ton."
Roszak explained that media has the
capacity to "talk things off the scene
before they even get started" and to
create the impression that we've gotten
through those issues because "we've
passed on to other things on the Mike
Douglas Show." Some of these issues
are going to take generations to solve,
he said.
Roszak warned that people should be
careful not to be fooled into believing
that history happens as the media says.
"There is a continuity of issues and
problems before us today . . . that were
raised in the '60s and are still waiting to
be worked out."
When asked to what extent we can
trust the press, Roszak responded "not
at all."
Because of the media's portrayal of
the New Left, along with the move
ment's misguided aspiration to affect
radical revolution, many people over
look the real accomplishments of the
'60s, Gitlin said. It is easy to forget, he
said, that as late as 1963 it was not pos
sible for blacks and whites to drink out
of the same water fountain.
In addition, the "anti-war movement
in Vietnam was probably the most suc
cessful movement against an imperial
war in the history of the world." He
noted that the White House gave seri
ous consideration to the use of nuclear
weapons in Vietnam, a plan which was
scrapped because of "an unremitting
anti-war movement that went on for 10
vears."
Gitlin identified the shortcoming of
the New Left as two-fold. First, the
movement's hostility to authority al
lowed the media to choose the leaders.
In the absence of authority, many ac
tivists paradoxically turned to un
abashed cult worship of radical figures
such as Mao and Ho Chi Minh.
Second, he reiterated that the '60s ac
tivists misconstrued their agenda as a
revolutionary one, when in fact there
was no revolutionary class to carry out
wide-sweeping societal transformation.

Despite achieving much of its liberal
agenda on civil rights and anti-war is
sues, the New Left concluded that their
cause failed simply because thev did
not achieve apocalyptic revolution.
During the question and answer ses
sion, Gitlin responded to charges de
livered by a Leninist in the audience
that these shortcomings resulted from
the lack of democratic centralism and
an adequate grounding in theoretical
debate.
In a powerful exhibition of intellec
tual macho, Gitlin denounced Leninism
for creating oppressive regimes the
world over, while he explicitly denied
that the American New Left failed toen
gage in energetic theoretical dis
cussion.
When pressed by his adversary that
there is a grand difference between
Leninism and Stalinism, Gitlin scoffed at
such vaunted scholars as Isaac
Deutscher, Edward Hallett Carr, and
Charles Bettelheim whose efforts to es
tablish this distinction strike him as"the
contemporary equivalent of the medi
eval discourse about angels and pins."
After the formal question and answer
session, both speakers were barraged
with queries from flocking admirers.
Gitlin responded to the suggestion that
Reagan was a businessman's president
by countering that Wall Street has given
the new administration a cold recep-

He added that Mr. Capitalism
himself, David Rockefeller, "thinks
Reagan's a crackpot." Rockefeller ap
parently would not agree, telling the
New York Times Magazine that he has
never enjoyed better access to the
White House, as he has met with Rea
gan at least six times since the election.
"Mv enthusiasm has grown," said
Rockefeller, "I didn't adequately rec
ognize the strength of (Reagan's) lead
ership. The president has proved that
he has the skills to turn the country."
While members of the audience
grumbled that things will only get
worse under the Reagan adminis
tration, Roszak concluded bv providing
rhem with a rousing exhortation to ac
tion:
"Politics happen through the im
aginative and daring action of relatively
few people. If you are waiting for mil
lions to sign up for something, you
might as well not wait. That doesn't
happen. The issues and the problems
raised in the '60s are still with us and
waiting to be addressed. Insofar as you
and I have any sense of conscience
about these matters, we should get
busy. The world is probably closer to
thermonuclear disaster than it was in
1959. That should concern us all. We
live here under the shadow of annihila
tion. What are we waiting for?"
