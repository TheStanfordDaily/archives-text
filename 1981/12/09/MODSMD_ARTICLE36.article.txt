# Sharing spreads the holiday spirit

Got a room full of unwanted
items?
To provide students with a
means of discarding articles
they no longer want, the ASSU
— in conjunction with the
Community Outreach Pro
gram at Stanford (CORPS) and
the Committee on Hunger — is
sponsoring "The Great Chrit
mas Exchange" to be held in
White Plaza Jan. 15 to 16.
Collection of items will take
place between Dec. 14 and 16
in The Clubhouse in Old
Union. Students designate the
lowest price they want their
goods sold for — represent
atives from the organizations
involved will later sell the
articles at the sale in January
and return the proceeds to the
student. No commission will be
deducted for this service.
"In the spirit of Christmas, it
is hoped that students will also
donate some things to the
project," said council of presi
dents (COP) member Dragan
Popov, the initiator of the
project.
Depending on what the arti
cle is, a donated item will be

given either to a local convales
cent home or to the Ecu
menical Hunger Project, ac
cording to Catherine Beck of
CORPS.
Popov said he hopes the
textbook area of the Exchange
will be successful. "We'd like
to provide an alternative to the
Bookstore," he said. The Law
School currently runs a similiar
book exchange.
Popov would like to see the
Exchange become a regular
event held every quarter.
The ASSU has already held
two similiar exchanges - a
"Dump Your Junk" sale last
June, and "Swap Sale" two
months ago.
"It's really not necessary to
have all that stuff going to the
dump," said Popov. "A lot of it
really is good!"
So if you haven't figured out
a way to stuff your many
belongings into a suitcase
bound for Florence, or if you
can't open your closet door
without a deluge of unwanted
items raining down, The Great
Christmas Exchange would be
happy to take them off your
hands.
