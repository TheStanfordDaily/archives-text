# Next quarter, find time
## 
### 
Ever since you've been here, you've been saying it. Over
and over again. "I want to work for the Daily, but I just don't
have time."
Well, don't you think it's about time you made time?
The Daily always needs new writers, reviewers, photogra
phers, artists, wire editors and production people.
Come in to our office in Storke Publications Building
when you get back from break. We'll hand you a story or
photo assignment and help you complete it.
Come on, make time. We think it's worth it.
