# 'Assassin' game leads to tragedy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Long Beach, Calif.— In the aftermath of the
weekend shooting of a Cal State Long Beach
sophomore by a campus policeman, a college
vice president pleaded with students to stop
playing a bizarre game sweeping college cam
puses.
The game, called "Assassin," involves the ex
ecution of "contracts" on the lives of players. An
assassin wins by finding his opponent alone and
unprotected and "terminating" him, using toy
weapons. The game continues until only one
player remains.
Mike Reagan, 19, of Norwalk, Calif., was shot
on Saturday night, when he pointed his sim
ulated M-16 weapon at campus police.
Reagan, who was struck in the upper right
chest and in the leg, was listed in guarded condi
tion in the intensive care unit at Los Altos Hospi
tal in Long Beach.
"What I am sure was considered fun and
games for the students almost caused at least
one death," Cal State Long Beach Vice President
Jack Shaline said in a statement circulated
throughout the 32,000-student campus Monday.
"I plead with our students and anyone else to
find recreational outlets other than with guns,

play guns, or anything that can be considered a
weapon or mistaken fora weapon."
Investigators said Sgt. Stephan King observed
Reagan and his companion, Julia Gissel, 19, get
ting out of a car and carrying toy rifles, and com
manded "freeze, police" after seeing them mov
ing along a walkway rattling doors.
The woman stopped but Reagan turned
around, assumed a squatting position and
pointed the toy gun at King, they said. The of
ficer fired three shots, two of which hit Reagan.
Bob Breunig, the school's director of public
affairs, said King apparently believed the couple
were burglars. He said there had been at least 15
recent break-ins in the area where the shooting
occurred.
"It's just a bad time for people to be going out
in dark areas with guns that look very real," he
said. "There are implications in society about
that. . . talk about Libyan hit squads. Everybody
is fairly jumpy."
Breunig said one university investigation, to
be conducted by the public safety department,
will seek to determine whether the "shooting
was accomplished within established policy for
using firearms."
