# Gene patent could garner 1$ million

Less than a week before the dis
count deadline, the University has in
hand 25 checks from the estimated
150 companies who use the gene
splicing technique patented one year
ago.
"I'm sure we're going to hit 50,"
said Andrew Barnes, coordinator of
biotechnology licensing atthe Office
of Technology Licensing (OTL).
If 50 companies take advantage of
the special credit available to firms
signing up by Dec. 15, the gene-splic
ing patent will bring the University $1
million this fiscal year — as much as
all its other annual patent revenue
combined.
Many expect that gene-splicing
will be to Stanford what Gatorade
was to Florida and fluoride to Indiana
— a patent that will earn the Univer
sity millions of dollars annually.
Last week, however, The New York
Times noted a "considerable in
dustry reluctance to accept what
many believe is an unenforceably
broad claim."
The 10-page patent, in outlining
the basic process of gene-splicing,
actually describes several techniques
— the "breadth" the industry re
portedly "grumbles" about.
The process itself, as reported in a
University new release, "stemmed
from scientific collaborations begun
in informal conversations by (Drs.
Stanley) Cohen (of Stanford) and
(Herbert) Boyer (of the University of
California at San Francisco) in a
Waikiki delicatessen in November
1972."
Determined not to missout on rev
enues in bioengineering as it had on
semiconductors, the University
fought tenaciously for the patent to
the process.
According to The New York Times,
Arthur D. Little, a consult lg firm in
Boston, estimated that t,\ • process
spawned at least 150 bioengineering
companies, which currently use io
phisticated modifications of it in
work on such products as insulin, in
terferon and oil-eating micro-or

ganisms — and all of which, legally at
least, must sign with Stanford.
But Barnes said the OTL intends to
prosecute only those non-licensed
companies that actually make money
on material produced by the tech
nique when their products finally ap
pear on the market.

For example, the South San Fran
cisco bioengineering company that
leads the field in insulin research
does not expect to produce it com
mercially for at least a year.
Co-founded by Herbert Boyer,
Genetech is one of the 30 companies
which gave Barnes a "fairly firm"
commitment, but which remains
conspicuous by the absence of its
check.
So is Cetus, the Berkeley genetic
engineering firm that is among those
researching interferon. The Wall
Street journal reported in August
that it planned "to be among the first
licensees."
Cetus Vice President William
Amon said in a phone interview Fri
day that the licensing agreement is
under review of the company's pat
ent attorneys, who are "trying to
straighten out various aspects of the
document. We're not sure we under
stand some terms of the agreement."
The "unique" agreement, Barnes
said, is designed to apply "not only to
the Genetechs but to the Eli Lillys
too." It is intended to suit all in
dustries with its reasonable terms —
or, as The New York Times wryly put
it, "to make it cheapertosign up than
tif-ht."
The company signing up pays an
initial $10,000 licensing fee and
