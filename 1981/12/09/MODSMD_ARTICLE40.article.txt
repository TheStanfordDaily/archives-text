# Employment push failing?
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The grow
ing unemployment problem,
which could become the worst
since the Great Depression of
the 19305, follows three dec
ades of national commitment
to more jobs and greater job
security.
That commitment was a
legacy of the disastrous times
just before World War 11, when
joblessness peaked at nearly 25
percent of the civilian labor
force. The nation proclaimed it
should never happen again.
Jobs were made: by a gov
ernment that grew huge, by a
resurgent private sector, by ef
forts of dedicated unions. It
was a massive push to make
more work, and to improve
wages, benefits, and working
conditions.
It seemed to be the answer,
fora time anyway. From 1947
through 1969 the jobless rate
never exceeded 6.8 percent (in
1958); in 13 years it remained
below 5. But since then it has
been below 5 in only 1970 and
1973.

In the deep recession of 1975
the jobless rate for the year
rose to 8.5 percent before
dropping steadily to a low of
5.8 percent in 1979. Last year it
reached 7.1. This November it
reached 8.4, wih more than 9
million Americans officially
counted as being without jobs.

Businesses
everywhere are...
seeking to pare off
layers of office
help.

Moreover, the rate is likely
to continue rising; private sec
tor and government fore
casters alike say monthly rates
as high as 9 percent are proba
ble next year. Three straight
monthly declines in new or
ders at factories, the latest one
(October) especially sharp,

foretell more weakness in jobs
and underscore the general ec
onomic deterioration.
Another factor, not quan
tified as easily as the un
employment rate, also tints the
picture darker. Pressured by
recession-inflation, businesses
everywhere are re-evaluating
their white collar needs, seek
ing to pare off layers of office
help. And it has become com
mon in labor-management
talks this year for management
to seek a return of wage and
other benefits labor had won in
earlier negotiations.
Viewing this picture, it
would be easy to conclude that
after 30 years or so the nation's
big job push has failed. But
such a judgment might be has
ty. Consider, for example, that
since 1939, when 17 percent of
workers couldn't find jobs, the
total civilian labor force has
almost doubled, from about 55
million in 1939 to more than
106 million.
What has happened — or is
happening — to the general

economy, and thus to jobs, is
the subject of great debate. No
one theory is likely to explain
the story, but common ele
ments are found in various
arguments.
That, for example, jobs and
wages were set without due re
gard for their relationship with
productivity. Productivity gains
have almost ceased in many in
dustries. Management often
blames employment costs.
Management itself isincreas
ingly suspect. Among the ac
cusations: It failed to invest in
research and development; it
avoided risk, anci thus
forewent the rewards.
Whatever the argument, the
productivity factor plays a role.
As it fell, the unitcostsof goods
rose. More capital and workers
were required to deliver the
same quantity of goods and
services. Result: inflation,
which made goods unaf
fordable and then forced cut
backs. Almost every part of the
economicprocess hasadded to
the cycle.
