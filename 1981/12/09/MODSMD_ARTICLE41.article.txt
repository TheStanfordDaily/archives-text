# Creationist teaching in court fight
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Little Rock, Ark. — It began with the
traditional invocation from the U.S.
marshal: "May God bless the United States
and this honorable court."
But the celebrated "creationism" trial,
which opened in federal court here Mon
day, quickly evolved into another species
— a constitutional test of whether "crea
tion science" is nothing more than that
old-time religion.
Equal time for the supernatural
The proceedings before U.S. District
Judge William Overton stemmed from a
challenge by 23 religious groups,
educators and individuals of a 1981 Arkan
sas statute that requires Arkansas public
schools that teach evolutionary theory to
give equal time to the theory that a super
natural force created the universe. Its pro
ponents term this latter approach "crea
tion science."
An almost identical law is under
challenge in Louisiana, and similar laws
have been proposed in at least 13 other
states.
Representing the plaintiffs in the Arkan
sas lawsuit is the American Civil Liberties
Union, an organization that owes much of
its fame to its effo'rts in the classic 1925
Scopes "monkey trial." The Scopes trial in
volved a challenge toa Tennessee law ban
ning the teaching of evolution in public
schools.
A media circus
Although it has not equaled the
circuslike atmosphere of the Scopes trial,
the Little Rock case promises to be a noisy
spectacle as testimony rolls on, mainly be
cause of the distractions caused by seven
television crews, 66 reporters, nine trial
lawyers and an audience of about 150 per
sons, representing extreme sides of the is
sue.
In his opening statement Monday,
ACLU attorney Robert Cearley of Little

Rock characterized the statute, Act 690, as
an effort by fundamentalist religious
groups to "force teaching of basic re
ligious beliefs in the guise of science."
"We intend to prove that creation sci
ence is not a science," Cearley said.
Implying a creator?
The Arkansas attorney general's office,
charged with defending the law in court,
claimed that the ACLU is acting as a censor
by trying to limit freedom of speech in the
classroom.
At times, the opening-day testimony re
sembled a college seminar in medieval
philosophy. Arkansas Attorney General
Steve Clark and his staff have constructed a
defense of the law based on a complicated
theory that the idea of creation does not
necessarily imply the existence of a
creator.
Clark has maintained that the issues in
the case are not religious but scientific.
"Creation science," Clark said in his open
ing statement, "is at least as scientific as
evolutionary science."
With the introduction of such a semantic
question, the focus of the trial took a
sharply philosophical turn, with each side
calling upon batteries of educated wit
nesses to introduce sometimes hard to fol
low arguments.
Philosophical attack
To attack the state's position, the ACLU
called on Langdon Gilkey, a professor of
the'ology at the University of Chicago.
Gilkey challenged the philosophical un
derpinnings of a creatorless creation with
dramatic flair.
The Chicago professor declared that
"creation science" is religious and added
that the state's position reminded him of
the 2nd Century Gnostic and Marcion
heresies.
The judge, a former insurance trial at
torney, gave an early hint of his leanings

during questioning of ACLU witness
George Marsden, a history professor at
Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich.,
and an expert on American fundamentalist
religion.
Religion or science?
The state had objected to Marsden's
characterization of "creation science" as a
direct product of fundamentalism, claim
ing it was irrelevant to the case. Overton
ruled against the state, saying, "If the Deo*-
pie who are writing about creation science
are borrowing their ideas from religious
movements, I would think that is relevant.
You can't wear two hats at the same time.
"You can't refer to it as religion for one
purpose and science for another," the
judge said.
The ACLU contends that the law which
was adopted in March and will be im
plemented in September 1982, is un
constitutional because it violates the First
Amendment's prohibition against estab
lishment of religion.
Carl Sagan, astronomy professor at Cor
nell University and host of the public ser
vice televiosion show "Cosmos" was asked
by the ACLU to speak on their behalf, but
cancelled at the last minute due to person
al reasons.
Literal interpretations
Kenneth Hicks, bishop for the 178,000-
rnember United Methodist Church in Ar
kansas, also testified for the ACLU. Hicks,
one of the individual plaintiffs in the case,
said he felt the law represented a fun
damentalist philosophy and was an in
trusion on the First Amendment.
Asked about his interpretation of the
Book of Genesis, Hicks said he took liter
ally only the first five words: "In the begin
ning God created..."
"To go beyond that line," Hicks said,
"belittles both God and the theological
process;"
