Sanctions against Libya debated
Washington — The administration is planning some
form of economic sanctions against Libya but is still in
the middle of high-level discussions to determine
their scope, according to senior administration of
ficials.
President Ronald Reagan convened a session of the
National Security Council again yesterday to take up
the issue for the second consecutive day, and the
group adjourned in midafternoon without reaching a
conclusion.
One of the ideas reportedly under consideration
involves asking U.S. allies from the ranks of the major
industrial oil-importing countries to join in an effort
to cut the market for Libyan oil. Buttodothis, officials
say, the United States would have to take the lead.
"The president feels that it's inconsistent to pay a
big bill to Libya every year while at the same time ask
ing our friends to stop dealing with them," one
knowledgeable source said.
The Libyan news agency, JANA, said overthe week
end that the CIA had "sent to NATO a secret report
which instigates West European countries to counter
Libya's policy and foil economic relations with this
state."
The White House yesterday afternoon was said to
be within 24 to 48 hours of briefing congressional
leaders on what it intends to do. Two press
statements, apparently differing in the sternness of
their rhetoric, reportedly have been prepared.
Reagan himself said Monday that "we have the evi
dence" that Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Khadafy,
had sent assassination teams to murder top-ranking
U.S. officials but, rather than follow up with details,
White House officials yesterday deplored leaks to the
media about the alleged teams.
Reagan rhetoric reversed
Washington — The Reagan administration, buf
feted by controversy over leaked federal budget esti
mates showing $100 billion-plus deficits annually for
the next three years, yesterday abandoned traditional
Republican rhetoric that labels government deficits
the main cause of inflation and warned it would be a
"disaster" to make any basic change in the president's
economic policy.
Economic Council member William Niskanen
stunned a conference sponsored by the conservative
American Enterprise Institute (AEI) by arguing that
"in general, concern about the (federal) deficit has
been misplaced." He said, "There is no direct or in
direct connection between deficits and inflation."
Calling for"a new perspective" on the budget,
Niskanen suggested that instead of a balanced
budget goal, the nation "should be prepared to ac
cept a deficit of $60-billion plus ... for the current
policy horizon" to prevent a contraction in"the net
worth of the federal government."
He added that in an inflationary environment, one
of the side effects is that the value of the govern
ment's financial and phsyical assets increases. Thus,
he said, the nation would do better "to look at the net
worth of the federal government", which has in
creased from $20 billion to $250 billion despite deficits
in 14 out of the last 15 years.
Hijackers seize four planes
Three hijacked Venezuelan jetliners with more
than 100 hostages aboard landed in Cuba yesterday
and a commandeered Libyan jet with at least 38
hostages touched down in Beirut. All four aircraft
were seized a day earlier and had made several stops.
Officials confirmed the planes — two Aeropostal
DC-9s and an Avensa Boeing 727 — landed in Cuba,

the Communist-ruled island 90 miles off the Florida
coast.
Passengers treed along the way said 10 hooded and
heavily armed people were involved in the highly co
ordinated operation. The Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina said there were 11 hijackers.
The Libyan jetliner, taken over by Shiite Moslemsto
dramatize the disappearance three years ago of their
spiritual leader, landed in Beirut last night after two
unsuccessful attempts to touch down, according to
witnesses. It was the plane's second landing in the
Lebanese capital in less than 24 hours.
The airliner was commandeered Monday over Italy
bv three Lebanese supporters of Imam Moussa Sadr,
the leader of the Shiite Moslem sect in Lebanon who
disappeared after a visit to Libya in August 1978.
The Libvan Boeing 727 landed in Rome earlier yes
terday after stops in Beirut and Athens, Greece. Air
port authorities said the plane carried at least 30 pas
sengers, eight crew and five armed men. Libvan of
ficials put the number of hostages aboard at 40, in
cluding 32 passengers and eight crew.
Campus church groups get ruling
Washington — The Supreme Court ruled yesterday
that public universities that let secular student or
ganizations meet in their buildings must also make fa
cilities available to campus religious groups for dis
cussions, worship services or prayers.
By a vote of 8-1, the justices concluded that the Uni
versity of Missouri at Kansas City violated the First
Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech when it
barred an evangelical Christian group from meeting
regularlv in a campus building.
The decision gave broad new constitutional protec
tion to religious observances. It marked the first time
the high court has directly held that religious ac
tivities, including prayers or worship services, are a
form of speech covered by the First Amendment just
like speech about political subjects.
The lone dissenter, Justice Byron White, said the
court was "plainly wrong" in holding that worship
services are a form of speech. Under that logic, he
said, a university might offer a class entitled "Sunday
Mass" just as easily as one called "The History of the
Catholic Church."
But in an opinion by justice Lewis Powell, the ma
jority said its ruling was a narrow one.
"Having created a forum generally open to student
groups, the (Missouri) university seeks to enforce a
contest-based exclusion of religious speech," Powell
said. "Its exclusionary policy violates the fundamental
principle that a state regulation of speech should be
content-neutral."
Salim drops from U.N. race
United Nations — The election of the next U.N. sec
retary generalwas thrown open yesterday as the last
candidate in the six-week impasse, Tanzanian Foreign
Minister Salim Salim, stepped aside.
Salim announced ata press conference here that he
would temporarily withdraw his name from the
balloting, and the Security Council promptly
gathered to consider new contenders.
The other original candidate, incumbent Kurt
Waldheim, who was seeking an unprecedented third
five-year term, pulled out of the balloting Thursday.
But since Salim was the nominee of the African na
tions and the non-aligned movement, other can
didates were reluctant to jump in so long as he re
mained in the race.
The latest move by Salim, who like Waldheim in
dicated he remains available fora draft, is expected to
bring forward as many as a score of hopefuls, virtually

all of them from the Third World.
The 15-nation council had deadlocked on 16 ballots
during the last six weeks, as the Chinese continually
vetoed Waldheim and the United States blocked
Salim.
The Tan/anian said that the determined American
opposition to him "is something which I fail to under
stand."
The council will not begin consideration of the new
group of contenders until late this week or early next
week. First it must give the candidates time to step for
ward; then the members must get voting instructions
from home.
Affirmative action leaders lobby
Washington — Civil rights leaders rallied round the
embattled banner of affirmative action yesterday on
two fronts as the U.S. Civil Rights Commission issued a
detailed endorsement of affirmative action that coin
cided with a dust-up on the same issue in the Senate.
Contrary to what critics of affirmative action claim,
white men continue to benefit from "an interlocking
self-perpetuating process that, started by past events,
now routinely bestows privileges" on them, accord
ing to the commission report. It works against blacks,
women and others to an extent that renders many
"colorblind" or "neutral" actions discriminatory, the
report says.
It reasserts that affirmative action, including quotas
in certain cases, is the only remedy.
Outgoing commission chairman Arthur Flemming,
who was fired last month by President Ronald
gan, presented the 56-page report along with a de
nunciation of attempts by Congress and the current
administration to "pull the rug out from under" ef
forts to gain equal opportunity for blacks, women and
others.
The administration, among other things, has in
dicated that it no longer will ask courts to force em
ployers to meet numerical goals for hiring women or
minority group members but will only seek remedial
action in individual cases of proven discrimination.
Also, in an interview yesterday in the Wall Street
Journal, Assistant Attorney General William Bradford
Reynolds said he will seek a Supreme Court ruling to
bar federal agencies from developing plans that give
minorities and women preference in hiring and pro
motions.
Fatal explosion in Appalachians
Whitwell, Tenn. — An explosion ripped through a
coal mine shaft yesterday, killing 13 miners 1200 feet
underground, authorities said. It was the third mine
disaster in the Appalachian coalfields in the last five
days.
Emergency rescue teams equipped with air tanks
and masks had to crawl through a shaft that is only 36
inches wide in some places to reach the men, a mine
company spokesman said.
William Allison, president of Tennessee Con
solidated Coal Co., said in a statement that all 13 men
had been found "and there were no survivors."
Mike Caudill, an assistant operations officer with
the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, had
said earlier that there were problems "with the at
mosphere inside the mine," which is about 30 miles
northwest of Chattanooga in a mountainous area of
southeastern Tennessee, and their conditions were
unknown.
Robert Woolsey, a spokesman for Tennessee Con
solidated, said no one answered when officials tried
tocall the minersthrough an underground telephone
from an office three miles from the shaft. None of the
miners were identified, but their families were gather

ing at the company's office.
On Monday, eight coal miners died in eastern Ken
tucky when an explosion trapped them about 2580
feet inside a mountain.
A mine accident last Thursday in Bergoo, West Vir
ginia, killed three men when a 35-foot section of slate
in a mine roof collapsed. Three miners escaped im
mediately after the fall, and three others were
rescued.
Sakharov still kept isolated
Moscow — Soviet authorities continued to bar all
contacts with Andrei Sakharov yesterday amid indica
tions of a slightly softer official attitude toward the
country's foremost dissident, who currently is being
held at an unspecified hospital.
The absence of news from Gorky, a city 250 miles
east of here to which Sakharov had been exiled, has
heightened concern among his friends about the
health of the nuclear physicist and his wife, who were
forcibly hospitalized last Friday after a 13-day hunger
strike.
But Liza Alexeyeva, the young woman at the center
of the Sakharovs' protest, yesterday met with an of
ficial of the KGB secret police and also talked by
phone with Anatoly Alexandrov, president of the So
viet Academy of Sciences.
Alexeyeva was briefly detained by the KGB Satur
day when she attempted to travel to Gorky and
warned that she should refrain from attempts to es
tablish contacts with Sakharov. On the previous day,
Alexandrov had refused to talk to her and had sent an
aide to tell her that he had done everything he could
to help Sakharov and could do no more.
Allen investigation probes deeper
Washington — The Justice Department has ex
panded its inquiry of Richard Allen to include the na
tional security adviser's failure to list his consulting
firm's clients on his financial disclosure form, a gov
ernment official said yesterday.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said
Justice Department investigators met with officials of
the Government Ethics Office in the past few days to
discuss the client question.
"The judgment that he should have listed (his
clients) is going to be made," said the official, adding
that the only question was whether Allen would be
required to file a second amended disclosure form
now, or wait until the Justice Department review is
over.
Budget worries depress market
The stock market declined broadly for the second
straight session yesterday amid persistent worries
over the federal budget deficit.
But the session produced one impressive gainer —
Lockheed Corp., which jumped 7 7 /e to 49V< as of the 4
p.m. close in New York on turnover of more than 1
million shares.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 5.70 on
Monday, lost another 5.24 to 881.75.
The daily tally on the New York Stock Exchange
showed more than two issues declining for every one
that advanced, and the Big Board's composite index
slipped .29 to 72.36.
