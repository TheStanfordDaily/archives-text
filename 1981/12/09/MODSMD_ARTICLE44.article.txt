### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
The first indictment of a Selective
Service non-registrant is expected
Friday, according to Dan Dobson,the
prospective defendant's lawyer. This
development is significant because it
is the beginning of official prose
cution of the 108 men who are
known to U.S. district attorneys
across the country as non-registrants.
Scott Aaseng, a Minnesota resident
and self-declared non-registrant, was
one of the first people to receive two
letters this fall warning him to reg

ister with the Selective Service or face
the possibility of prosecution.
Dobson told the Daily he has been
negotiating over Aaseng's case with
Thor Anderson, the assistant U.S. at
torney in the eastern district of Min
nesota, for the past six weeks.
Dobson said Aaseng informed the
government in July of his failure to
register with Selective Service.
Dobson said Anderson's office has
given Aaseng until Friday to register.

Dobson said he and Aaseng expect to
receive the indictment around 11
a.m. Friday, at which time they plan
to hold a national press conference.
According to Matt Nicodemus of
Stanford Against Conscription (SAC),
nationwide demonstrations in sup
port of non-registrants are planned
to follow the public announcement
of the indictment.
There will be a rally in White Plaza
on Friday, said Nicodemus, another
non-registrant. He explained that the
purpose of the rally is to "indicate
that there a strong non-registrant

force.
"It will be an opportunity for non
registrants here and across the coun
try to reaffirm their decision and
make public the government's in
ability to deal with our large num
bers."
The number of non-registrants is
estimated to be more than 1 million,
according to SAC's Larry Ausubel.
Speakers at the rally will include lo
cal anti-draft activists, three Stanford
non-registrants, and statements of
support by various groups on cam
pus, Nicodemus said.
