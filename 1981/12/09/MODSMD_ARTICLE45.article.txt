Full moon
Due to a twist of nature which
places the offical full moon at 12:41
a.m. Friday morning, Stanford man
and woman-izing will hereby take
place Friday evening at midnight. So
sayeth the soothsayers in the Daily of
fice. Or, if you're really serious about
this, as apparently a certain few peo
ple who have been studyingthis deli
cate issue are, you can try both nights
— one is sure to take.
Christmas banquet
Oh, tidings of comfort (Southern,

that is) and joy ... The day has ar
rived, the stockings have all been
hung by the editors' boxes with care,
in hopes that the banquet soon will
be there. The party begins this eve
ning at the Daily at 5:30, and we will
leave for the Bella Vista at about 6:30.
Please come — but if you're not com
ing, please call the office today so
that the unfortunates on the waiting
list can get in.
Pay cards
Everyone who has not signed a
contract card yet this year should do
so today. Comprende?
