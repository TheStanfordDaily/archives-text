# Little big effort stymies Cardinal, 71-63
## Penn quakes through Maples, wins 1 st Stanford Invitational 
### Sally Jenkins Steve Odell 
Stanford basketball's New Look
took a nose dive last weekend as the
Cardinal watched the First Annual
Stanford Invitational Tournament ti
tle slip away to the University of
Pennsylvania, 71-63
Stanford's chance to win its own
tournament and upset an Eastern
powerhouse disappeared in the flash
of an Andy Geiger grimace. Penn for
ward Paul Little singlehandedly out
manuevered the Card defense, while
the Card offense fell into a lethal
slump, failing to sink a single field
goal in the last 11 minutes of play.
The Card dominated the game for
the entire first half and most of the
second until Little earned himself the
tournament Most Valuable Player
Award by running up 10 points in the
closing minutes.
The onslaught began in earnest
with 7:56 remaining. Penn had whit
tled away at Stanford's 9-point half
time lead with a barrage of un
answered scores from Little, forward
David Lardner and guard Angelo
Reynolds until Little brought Penn to
within 3 with two consecutive buck
ets: one on a layin from an inbounds
pass underneath the basket and the
other on a slam-dunk.
The Card managed to string only
five points together in the remainer
of the game, on free throws from
freshman center Johnny Rogers, sen
ior forward Brian Welch and
sophomore guard Keith Jones.
Penn took the initiative and ran up
the score in the final five minutes. Lit
tle hit on shots of 8 and 18 feet, Rey
nolds hit a 20-footer to tie the sc'ore
and Lardner handled the Card case
inside with two layups. Guard Willie
Oliphant scored the final basket with
five seconds remaining with an easy
layup after a Stanford turnover.
Stanford dominated the first half of
play after Penn ran to a 6-point lead
spurred by an airtight full-court press
which yielded two turnovers. Rey
nolds started Penn off with a 16-foot
jumper from the right side, Little
tipped the ball in 10 seconds later on
a steal and Reynolds hit another
jump shot from 15 feet on the second

turnover.
But sophomore guard Roger
Lemons scored three consecutive
buckets to spark Stanford; one on a
break-away dunk from Welch that
drew roars from Maples Pavilion
fans, another on a layin after a Revelli
steal seconds later and a 13-footer.
Revelli added two free throws to pass
the Quakers and the Card shuffled to
a 43-34 first half lead from there.
"Credit should go to Pennsylva
nia," said Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso. "They showed great pa
tience despite the fact that they were
down by 10. Their aggressive defense
certainly has an effect on our play.
"We made crucial turnovers at the
wrong time," he added. "Our shot
selection was questionable. They just
outplayed us in the last 10 minutes,
we made the mistakes. I thought our
patience was good, but not our
judgement."
Lemons, Welch and Revelli made
the All-Tournament team, with 12,14
and 15 points respectively in the final.
They were joined by Little (16 points)
and Lardner (15) from Penn, and
Furman guard Mel Daniel, perhaps
the most exciting player of the week
end.
Daniel led Furman to a an 86-80
third place finish over Loyola-Mary
mount earlier in the evening, with a
stellar performance in the fast-paced
contest. Loyola was there on the
scoreboard but never seemed in con
trol as the Paladins simply out-ran,
out-classed and out-coached them.
Daniel and forward Noel Gilliard
helped Furman to a 44-35 first half
lead with 13 and 9 points respective
ly, and Loyola could never quite
make up the deficit. Daniel finished
with a tournament high 27-pointsfor
the evening, while Gilliard followed
him up with 14.
The Paladins were Stanford's op
ponents on Friday night in the
opening game of the tournament
and the Cardinal survived a 14-point
Furman spurt at the start of the sec
ond half, hanging on to win, 78-74.
The Cardinal led at intermission by
a score of 43-35, thanks mostly to
Revelli's 12 points and seven re

bounds. But Stanford came out for
the second half and watched, liter
ally, their eight point lead turn into a
six point deficit as Furman pulled
ahead 49-43. They were mostly
watching Daniel, who scored six of
his game high 26 points (14-for-14
from the line) during the outburst.
But just as Stanford was reeling
back, about ready to hit the mat, they
regained their balance and strung to
gether 1 3 straight points of their own
to knock the Paladins out of the game
and into the consolation bracket.
The resurgence was highlighted by
a 25-footer from Welch, who fol
lowed up his bomb by intercepting a
pass in the backcourt on the ensuing
transition and driving fora layin.
Stanford led 56-49 when the smoke
had cleared and their lead was never
seriously challenged the rest of the
game.
"It was like watching the interest
rate," Dißiaso said of the streaks after
the game. "I was very proud of our
tgam. We had the lead at halftime
and then came out very flat in the
second half. But we were able to go
from six down to seven ahead. His
torically, we have not been a team
that has been able to create their own
momentum, but we did it tonight."
The most momentous momentum
makers were Revelli, who finished
with 25 points and 13 boards before
fouling out with 12 seconds remain
ing, and Jones, who flashed and
dashed for 21 points on eight-for-11
shooting coming in from off the
bench.
"He's great as a starter," Dißiaso
said in reference to the sophomore
guard from Arizona, "but he's also
one helluva sixth man." Dißiaso
would have given his right hand for
such a predicament in past years.
Jones was the proverbial shot in
the arm when the Cardinal needed it
the most, using his quickness and
penetrating abilities to effectively
counter Furman's zone, which was
bottling Stanford up until Jones hit
the floor.

and full-court fast
break lay-in with 15seconds re
maining allowed the Quakers
to nip Loyola-Marymount,
70-69.
The Lions had just taken
possession after Penn's Rey
nolds slipped and was called
for travelling with 39 seconds
left and the Quakes leading
68-67. LMU guard Charles
Dorsey was dribbling near the
top of the key in preparation
fora final shot when McCaffery
came up with his game-win
ning theft.
Ware then hit a 30-foot
jumpshot to make the final
margin.
Loyola came within one
point six times in the latter
minutes, but was never able to
regain the lead, which they
held briefly at the outset, 2-0.
It looked as though Penn
would roll over the Lions as it
cruised out to a 29-15 lead.
Loyola, however, came back,
behind the redhot shooting of

the guard triumvirate of
Dorsey (14 points), Ware (15
points) and Sparks (8-10 from
the field, 18 points).
Ware hit three straight out
side jumpers, before the half to
conclude a 19-8 Loyola turn
around and put them into the
locker room trailing by only
three, 37-34.
Forward Lardner provided
the offensive punch for Penn,
putting in a game-high 20
points and ripping six offensive
rebounds. He was followed by
Reynolds with 14 points (all
from the field) and Little, who
added 11. McCaffery, despite
only scoring two points (on the
game-winner), had six assists
and five steals.
Loyola, despite missing its
chance to play Stanford in the
tournament, will have that op
portunity tomorrow.
The Lions, now 0-4 after the
Stanford Invite, will travel
again into Maples Pavilion fora

Stanford basketball's New Look
took a nose dive last weekend as the
Cardinal watched the First Annual
Stanford Invitational Tournament ti
tle slip away to the University of
Pennsylvania, 71-63
Stanford's chance to win its own
tournament and upset an Eastern
powerhouse disappeared in the flash
of an Andy Geiger grimace. Penn for
ward Paul Little singlehandedly out
manuevered the Card defense, while
the Card offense fell into a lethal
slump, failing to sink a single field
goal in the last 11 minutes of play.
The Card dominated the game for
the entire first half and most of the
second until Little earned himself the
tournament Most Valuable Player
Award by running up 10 points in the
closing minutes.
The onslaught began in earnest
with 7:56 remaining. Penn had whit
tled away at Stanford's 9-point half
time lead with a barrage of un
answered scores from Little, forward
David Lardner and guard Angelo
Reynolds until Little brought Penn to
within 3 with two consecutive buck
ets: one on a layin from an inbounds
pass underneath the basket and the
other on a slam-dunk.
The Card managed to string only
five points together in the remainer
of the game, on free throws from
freshman center Johnny Rogers, sen
ior forward Brian Welch and
sophomore guard Keith Jones.
Penn took the initiative and ran up
the score in the final five minutes. Lit
tle hit on shots of 8 and 18 feet, Rey
nolds hit a 20-footer to tie the sc'ore
and Lardner handled the Card case
inside with two layups. Guard Willie
Oliphant scored the final basket with
five seconds remaining with an easy
layup after a Stanford turnover.
Stanford dominated the first half of
play after Penn ran to a 6-point lead
spurred by an airtight full-court press
which yielded two turnovers. Rey
nolds started Penn off with a 16-foot
jumper from the right side, Little
tipped the ball in 10 seconds later on
a steal and Reynolds hit another
jump shot from 15 feet on the second

turnover.
But sophomore guard Roger
Lemons scored three consecutive
buckets to spark Stanford; one on a
break-away dunk from Welch that
drew roars from Maples Pavilion
fans, another on a layin after a Revelli
steal seconds later and a 13-footer.
Revelli added two free throws to pass
the Quakers and the Card shuffled to
a 43-34 first half lead from there.
"Credit should go to Pennsylva
nia," said Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso. "They showed great pa
tience despite the fact that they were
down by 10. Their aggressive defense
certainly has an effect on our play.
"We made crucial turnovers at the
wrong time," he added. "Our shot
selection was questionable. They just
outplayed us in the last 10 minutes,
we made the mistakes. I thought our
patience was good, but not our
judgement."
Lemons, Welch and Revelli made
the All-Tournament team, with 12,14
and 15 points respectively in the final.
They were joined by Little (16 points)
and Lardner (15) from Penn, and
Furman guard Mel Daniel, perhaps
the most exciting player of the week
end.
Daniel led Furman to a an 86-80
third place finish over Loyola-Mary
mount earlier in the evening, with a
stellar performance in the fast-paced
contest. Loyola was there on the
scoreboard but never seemed in con
trol as the Paladins simply out-ran,
out-classed and out-coached them.
Daniel and forward Noel Gilliard
helped Furman to a 44-35 first half
lead with 13 and 9 points respective
ly, and Loyola could never quite
make up the deficit. Daniel finished
with a tournament high 27-pointsfor
the evening, while Gilliard followed
him up with 14.
The Paladins were Stanford's op
ponents on Friday night in the
opening game of the tournament
and the Cardinal survived a 14-point
Furman spurt at the start of the sec
ond half, hanging on to win, 78-74.
The Cardinal led at intermission by
a score of 43-35, thanks mostly to
Revelli's 12 points and seven re

bounds. But Stanford came out for
the second half and watched, liter
ally, their eight point lead turn into a
six point deficit as Furman pulled
ahead 49-43. They were mostly
watching Daniel, who scored six of
his game high 26 points (14-for-14
from the line) during the outburst.
But just as Stanford was reeling
back, about ready to hit the mat, they
regained their balance and strung to
gether 1 3 straight points of their own
to knock the Paladins out of the game
and into the consolation bracket.
The resurgence was highlighted by
a 25-footer from Welch, who fol
lowed up his bomb by intercepting a
pass in the backcourt on the ensuing
transition and driving fora layin.
Stanford led 56-49 when the smoke
had cleared and their lead was never
seriously challenged the rest of the
game.
"It was like watching the interest
rate," Dißiaso said of the streaks after
the game. "I was very proud of our
tgam. We had the lead at halftime
and then came out very flat in the

steal seconds later and a 13-footer.
Revelli added two free throws to pass
the Quakers and the Card shuffled to
a 43-34 first half lead from there.
"Credit should go to Pennsylva
nia," said Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso. "They showed great pa
tience despite the fact that they were
down by 10. Their aggressive defense
certainly has an effect on our play.
"We made crucial turnovers at the
wrong time," he added. "Our shot
selection was questionable. They just
outplayed us in the last 10 minutes,
we made the mistakes. I thought our
patience was good, but not our
judgement."
Lemons, Welch and Revelli made
the All-Tournament team, with 12,14
and 15 points respectively in the final.
They were joined by Little (16 points)
and Lardner (15) from Penn, and
Furman guard Mel Daniel, perhaps
the most exciting player of the week
end.
Daniel led Furman to a an 86-80
third place finish over Loyola-Mary
mount earlier in the evening, with a
stellar performance in the fast-paced
contest. Loyola was there on the
scoreboard but never seemed in con
trol as the Paladins simply out-ran,
out-classed and out-coached them.
Daniel and forward Noel Gilliard
helped Furman to a 44-35 first half
lead with 13 and 9 points respective
ly, and Loyola could never quite
make up the deficit. Daniel finished
with a tournament high 27-pointsfor
the evening, while Gilliard followed
him up with 14.
The Paladins were Stanford's op
ponents on Friday night in the
opening game of the tournament
and the Cardinal survived a 14-point
Furman spurt at the start of the sec
ond half, hanging on to win, 78-74.
The Cardinal led at intermission by
a score of 43-35, thanks mostly to
Revelli's 12 points and seven re

bounds. But Stanford came out for
the second half and watched, liter
ally, their eight point lead turn into a
six point deficit as Furman pulled
ahead 49-43. They were mostly
watching Daniel, who scored six of
his game high 26 points (14-for-14
from the line) during the outburst.
But just as Stanford was reeling
back, about ready to hit the mat, they
regained their balance and strung to
gether 1 3 straight points of their own
to knock the Paladins out of the game
and into the consolation bracket.
The resurgence was highlighted by
a 25-footer from Welch, who fol
lowed up his bomb by intercepting a
pass in the backcourt on the ensuing
transition and driving fora layin.
Stanford led 56-49 when the smoke
had cleared and their lead was never
seriously challenged the rest of the
game.
"It was like watching the interest
rate," Dißiaso said of the streaks after
the game. "I was very proud of our
tgam. We had the lead at halftime
and then came out very flat in the
second half. But we were able to go
from six down to seven ahead. His
torically, we have not been a team
that has been able to create their own
momentum, but we did it tonight."
The most momentous momentum
makers were Revelli, who finished
with 25 points and 13 boards before
fouling out with 12 seconds remain
ing, and Jones, who flashed and
dashed for 21 points on eight-for-11
shooting coming in from off the
bench.
"He's great as a starter," Dißiaso
said in reference to the sophomore
guard from Arizona, "but he's also
one helluva sixth man." Dißiaso
would have given his right hand for
such a predicament in past years.
Jones was the proverbial shot in
the arm when the Cardinal needed it
the most, using his quickness and
penetrating abilities to effectively
counter Furman's zone, which was
bottling Stanford up until Jones hit
the floor.

and full-court fast
break lay-in with 15seconds re
maining allowed the Quakers
to nip Loyola-Marymount,
70-69.
The Lions had just taken
possession after Penn's Rey
nolds slipped and was called
for travelling with 39 seconds
left and the Quakes leading
68-67. LMU guard Charles
Dorsey was dribbling near the
top of the key in preparation
fora final shot when McCaffery
came up with his game-win
ning theft.
Ware then hit a 30-foot
jumpshot to make the final
margin.
Loyola came within one
point six times in the latter
minutes, but was never able to
regain the lead, which they
held briefly at the outset, 2-0.
It looked as though Penn
would roll over the Lions as it
cruised out to a 29-15 lead.
Loyola, however, came back,
behind the redhot shooting of

the guard triumvirate of
Dorsey (14 points), Ware (15
points) and Sparks (8-10 from
the field, 18 points).
Ware hit three straight out
side jumpers, before the half to
conclude a 19-8 Loyola turn
around and put them into the
locker room trailing by only
three, 37-34.
Forward Lardner provided
the offensive punch for Penn,
putting in a game-high 20
points and ripping six offensive
rebounds. He was followed by
Reynolds with 14 points (all
from the field) and Little, who
added 11. McCaffery, despite
only scoring two points (on the
game-winner), had six assists
and five steals.
Loyola, despite missing its
chance to play Stanford in the
tournament, will have that op
portunity tomorrow.
The Lions, now 0-4 after the
Stanford Invite, will travel
again into Maples Pavilion fora
non-conference game at 8 p.m.
Stanford basketball's New Look
took a nose dive last weekend as the
Cardinal watched the First Annual
Stanford Invitational Tournament ti
tle slip away to the University of
Pennsylvania, 71-63
Stanford's chance to win its own
tournament and upset an Eastern
powerhouse disappeared in the flash
of an Andy Geiger grimace. Penn for
ward Paul Little singlehandedly out
manuevered the Card defense, while
the Card offense fell into a lethal
slump, failing to sink a single field
goal in the last 11 minutes of play.
The Card dominated the game for
the entire first half and most of the
second until Little earned himself the
tournament Most Valuable Player
Award by running up 10 points in the
closing minutes.
The onslaught began in earnest
with 7:56 remaining. Penn had whit
tled away at Stanford's 9-point half
time lead with a barrage of un
answered scores from Little, forward
David Lardner and guard Angelo
Reynolds until Little brought Penn to
within 3 with two consecutive buck
ets: one on a layin from an inbounds
pass underneath the basket and the
other on a slam-dunk.
The Card managed to string only
five points together in the remainer
of the game, on free throws from
freshman center Johnny Rogers, sen
ior forward Brian Welch and
sophomore guard Keith Jones.
Penn took the initiative and ran up
the score in the final five minutes. Lit
tle hit on shots of 8 and 18 feet, Rey
nolds hit a 20-footer to tie the sc'ore
and Lardner handled the Card case
inside with two layups. Guard Willie
Oliphant scored the final basket with
five seconds remaining with an easy
layup after a Stanford turnover.
Stanford dominated the first half of
play after Penn ran to a 6-point lead
spurred by an airtight full-court press
which yielded two turnovers. Rey
nolds started Penn off with a 16-foot
jumper from the right side, Little
tipped the ball in 10 seconds later on
a steal and Reynolds hit another
jump shot from 15 feet on the second

turnover.
But sophomore guard Roger
Lemons scored three consecutive
buckets to spark Stanford; one on a
break-away dunk from Welch that
drew roars from Maples Pavilion
fans, another on a layin after a Revelli
steal seconds later and a 13-footer.
Revelli added two free throws to pass
the Quakers and the Card shuffled to
a 43-34 first half lead from there.
