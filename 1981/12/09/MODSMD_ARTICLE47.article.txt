# Cagewomen lose to SC, LB

### Sally Jenkins 
The women's basketball team trav
elled south last weekend and re
turned with that swell cliche, the
moral victory. The N0.4 ranked USC
Trojans won their inevitable victory
over the Cardinal 76-57 Friday night,
and Stanford bordered on a big-time
upset Saturday evening but lost a
60-57 heartbreaker to the N0.5 Long
Beach 49ers.
To ease the pain of the double loss
went that Top-40 tune, "but we
played great." So sang Stanford assis
tant coach Sue Roicewijcz, because
in only their third and fourth games
of the season the Cardinal squad put
a couple of performances in their
pockets that could prove them de
serving of a Top-5 ranking of their
own in the near future.
Head coach Dottie McCrea's
squad played the Tro-women to a
29-30 near draw at halftime. Led by
senior center Louise Smith, who filed
an 18-point 10-rebound per
formance overall, the Card led by 10
points through most of the half. The
Stanford offensive onslaught forced
the normally sedate Trojans out of
man-defense into zone (and thus the
moral victory), and it took afullcourt
press and a lot of catch-up basketball
to rgain their composure.
Stanford was simply out-scored in
the second half. USC upped its lead
to 10 with four minutes to play, and
stepped on the gas. As the Trojans
ran up the score the Cardinal finally
lost control for the first time all night.
The Card out-rebounded USC
37-33, thanks to Smith and junior for
ward Meg Metzger, with 11 points
and 9 rebounds. Junior center Kim
Kupferer followed her up on the
scoring chart with 11 points also, and
5 rebounds.
"We really controlled the tempo,"
said Roicewijcz. "They couldn't run
on us."
The real running team was Long
Beach, a speedy squad with a danger
ous fast-break.
The 49ers struggled to a narrow
30-29 first half lead due to a defensive
effort that eventually held Smith to
only 6 points in the entire game. She
did pull down a team-leading 12 re
bounds however.

The Card controlled the tempo
again, and led by one point with 23
seconds remaining when the 49ers
sunk two free-throws to turn the
tables. With a chance to recapture
the lead and take home a big upset,
the Card turned the ball over a Long
Beach made an easy bucket to save its
ranking.
Testimony to Stanford's new
found depth came from the bench. If
the 49ers thought they were safe in
shutting down Smith, they soon
found out different when head
coach Dottie McCrea pulled Jeanne
Ruark-Hoff out of her sleeve. A
former starting center on the team

before she redshirted a year to get
married, Hoff took over as leading
scorer with 15 points, and snatched
five rebounds.
Although Roicewijcz praised
Hoff's performance, she added that a
lineup change isn't probable at this
point. "There's always the possibilty
of a shake-up because the competi
tion is definitely there, but we don't
forsee any change right now," she
said.
Another surprise from the bench
was freshman phenom Noelle
Hanrahan, who bolstered a sagging
Cardinal offensive effort with three
buckets from the top of the key.
