# Ashe says he's prepared to default McEnroe in Davis Cup match play

### Washington Post 
Cincinnati — Arthur Ashe, cap
tain of the U.S. Davis Cup team,
says he is prepared to default John
McEnroe, his team's No. 1 player,
if McEnroe misbehaves during
this week's Davis Cup final here
against Argentina.
"I was embarrassed and upset
by what happened in Portland and
so waseveryone in the U.S. Tennis
Association," said Ashe, who is in
his first year as captain. "I think
John knows he was wrong and was
embarrassed, too. But it cannot
happen again. I plan to tell him
that."
The incident that upset Ashe
took place during the doubles
match that clinched the U.S. semi

final victory over Australia in Oc
tober. McEnroe and partner Peter
Fleming, leading, 2-0, in sets, be
came involved in a dispute with
the chair umpire and the match
referee that almost led to their
being defaulted for arguing too
long and too strenuously.
"John and Peter had a legit
imate reason to complain because
the umpire was wrong," Ashe
said. "But I told them, 'Bad luck,
boys, we got screwed.' We were
still up, 2-0. But they continued to
argue. It really made us look like
the ugly Americans."
McEnroe says he and Fleming
probably did go too far in their
arguments. "Peter started the
argument, and I supported him

because he's my teammate,"
McEnroe said. "We were com
pletely right on the call. But we
wouldn't take no for an answer,
and I guess that was a mistake.
"I know this is a sensitive issue
but I think a coach or a captain
should stick up for his player right
or wrong. I don't think you're sup
posed to say bad things about
them. I can understand, though,
where it might be difficult for
Arthur. He's got a reputation as a
great gentleman and being on the
court with Peter and me probably
isn't the easiest thing in the world
for him.
"But if it bothers him then I
don't think he should take the job.
If you feel you are
going to have to criticize
your plavers, you shouldn't
be the coach. I think if it
were me, I would take the
heat for my players."
McEnroe always plays
Davis Cup, which other top
American players over the
years have not always done,
because it is not lucrative.
Davis play also puts
McEnroe in a nothing-to
gain, everything-to-lose sit
uation since he is the No. 1
player in the world.
Ashe says he is ap
preciative of McEnroe's will
ingness to play Davis Cup —
Jimmy Connors is not here
and did not play in Portland
— but also says he plans to
talk to McEnroe about his
behavior before the
matches begin here Friday
at Riverfront Coliseum.
"The conversation will
only last about three
minutes," Ashe said. "I'm
not going to tell him any
thing he doesn't already
know. But I want him to re
alize that if it happens again
like in Portland I'm just
going to tell him to sit down,
walk up to the umpire and
say, 'The United States de
faults.' It's never been done
before but I will do it and I
know the USTA will back
me."
McEnroe says he has
made an effort in recent
months to avoid on-court

incidents because he finds
them — and their aftermath
— unpleasant. His behavior
during the U.S. Open was
good and, in the earlier
Davis Cup series against
Czechoslovakia, near
perfect.
"If people say the way I
behave is embarrassing for
the United States then I
have to think about chang
ing my behavior," he said.
"It's not my nature to just
accept things, though. If I
embarrass people, maybe I
shouldn't be selected again.
I think the standards of be
havior should be higher for
Davis Cup because you
aren't just embarrassing
yourself, you're embarrass
ing your country."
Which is exactly Ashe's
point. He sees great irony in
the fact that McEnroe
should embarrass himself
when playing Davis Cup, a
situation where he should
have a chance to enhance
his image merely by show
ing up.
"I appreciate the fact that
John wants to play, but he
knows he has to live up to a
certain standard to be
selected in the future,"
Ashe said. "Obviously, I
want him on the team. But
in Davis Cup the standards
are higher and the rules are
tougher.
