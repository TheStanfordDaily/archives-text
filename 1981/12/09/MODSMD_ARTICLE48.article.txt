### Washington Post 
Cincinnati â€” Arthur Ashe, cap
tain of the U.S. Davis Cup team,
says he is prepared to default John
McEnroe, his team's No. 1 player,
if McEnroe misbehaves during
this week's Davis Cup final here
against Argentina.
"I was embarrassed and upset
by what happened in Portland and
so waseveryone in the U.S. Tennis
Association," said Ashe, who is in
his first year as captain. "I think
John knows he was wrong and was
embarrassed, too. But it cannot
happen again. I plan to tell him
that."
The incident that upset Ashe
took place during the doubles
match that clinched the U.S. semi

final victory over Australia in Oc
tober. McEnroe and partner Peter
Fleming, leading, 2-0, in sets, be
came involved in a dispute with
the chair umpire and the match
referee that almost led to their
being defaulted for arguing too
long and too strenuously.
"John and Peter had a legit
imate reason to complain because
the umpire was wrong," Ashe
said. "But I told them, 'Bad luck,
boys, we got screwed.' We were
still up, 2-0. But they continued to
argue. It really made us look like
the ugly Americans."
McEnroe says he and Fleming
probably did go too far in their
arguments. "Peter started the
argument, and I supported him

because he's my teammate,"
McEnroe said. "We were com
pletely right on the call. But we
wouldn't take no for an answer,
and I guess that was a mistake.
"I know this is a sensitive issue
but I think a coach or a captain
should stick up for his player right
or wrong. I don't think you're sup
posed to say bad things about
them. I can understand, though,
where it might be difficult for
Arthur. He's got a reputation as a
great gentleman and being on the
court with Peter and me probably
isn't the easiest thing in the world
for him.
"But if it bothers him then I
don't think he should take the job.
