# Connecticut connects with NCAA Championship
## 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford University hosted the
NCAA Soccer Championship Tour
nament semifinals and finals last
weekend as the top four teams in the
nation competed for the national
soccer crown.
Soccer fans witnessed quite a
show, not only of great soccer, but in
games which were closer and more
exciting than anyone could possibly
have planned.
At the end of the two day tour
nament, the University of Connecti
cut Huskies, a team which Stanford
beat 3-0 earlier this year, claimed
their first NCAA soccer cham
pionship ever in a hard fought 2-1 ov
ertime victory over the Alabama
A&M Bulldogs.
On Saturday, Connecticut won its
semifinal match with Eastern Illinois
2-1, while Alabama A&M beat Phila
delphia Textile in a shootout after a
stunning 2-2 triple-overtime tie.
Sunday's final between Connecti
cut and Alabama A&M had all the ex
citement that one would expect,
though both teams were obviously
tired and probably not as sharp as
they were in the semifinals.
From the start of the game, the
contrasting style of the two teams was
very evident. Connecticut generally
chose to control the game with its
short passing attack, while Alabama
A&M was content to use its highly ef
fective counters.

The Bulldogs were the first team to
score. Taking advantage of a midfield
mistake by the Huskies, A&M for
ward Solomon Shiferaw caught Con
necticut out of position. He took the
ball just before the midfield mark
and made a 45-yard run before driv
ing his 12-yard shot past the charging
Connecticut goalie.
In the second half, Connecticut
came right back, scoring a goal in the
first minute of the period. Junior
midfielder Bill Marrone, son of
Huskie coach Joe Marrone, scored
the goal from eight yards out after
taking an excellent pass from junior
striker Graziano Cornola.
Connecticut again came close to
scoring minutes later when Huskie
striker Elvis Comrie had his shot
blocked by Bulldog goalie Kevin
Hunt.
But for the next ten minutes things
slowed down a bit and neither team
was able to do much of anything.
However, the final minutes of the
second half ended in a flurry with
hoth teams putting on good pres
sure. Unfortunately, neither team
was able to score, sending the game
into overtime.
In the overtime period, Alabama
A&M looked tired, definitely show
ing symptons of Saturday's triple-ov
ertime victory. After nearly five
minutes had expired in the period,
