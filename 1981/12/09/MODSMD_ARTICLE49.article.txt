# Connecticut connects with NCAA Championship
## 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford University hosted the
NCAA Soccer Championship Tour
nament semifinals and finals last
weekend as the top four teams in the
nation competed for the national
soccer crown.
Soccer fans witnessed quite a
show, not only of great soccer, but in
games which were closer and more
exciting than anyone could possibly
have planned.
At the end of the two day tour
nament, the University of Connecti
cut Huskies, a team which Stanford
beat 3-0 earlier this year, claimed
their first NCAA soccer cham
pionship ever in a hard fought 2-1 ov
ertime victory over the Alabama
A&M Bulldogs.
On Saturday, Connecticut won its
semifinal match with Eastern Illinois
2-1, while Alabama A&M beat Phila
delphia Textile in a shootout after a
stunning 2-2 triple-overtime tie.
Sunday's final between Connecti
cut and Alabama A&M had all the ex
citement that one would expect,
though both teams were obviously
tired and probably not as sharp as
they were in the semifinals.
From the start of the game, the
contrasting style of the two teams was
very evident. Connecticut generally
chose to control the game with its
short passing attack, while Alabama
A&M was content to use its highly ef
fective counters.

The Bulldogs were the first team to
score. Taking advantage of a midfield
mistake by the Huskies, A&M for
ward Solomon Shiferaw caught Con
necticut out of position. He took the
ball just before the midfield mark
and made a 45-yard run before driv
ing his 12-yard shot past the charging
Connecticut goalie.
In the second half, Connecticut
came right back, scoring a goal in the
first minute of the period. Junior
midfielder Bill Marrone, son of
Huskie coach Joe Marrone, scored
the goal from eight yards out after
taking an excellent pass from junior
striker Graziano Cornola.
Connecticut again came close to
scoring minutes later when Huskie
striker Elvis Comrie had his shot
blocked by Bulldog goalie Kevin
Hunt.
But for the next ten minutes things
slowed down a bit and neither team
was able to do much of anything.
However, the final minutes of the
second half ended in a flurry with
hoth teams putting on good pres
sure. Unfortunately, neither team
was able to score, sending the game
into overtime.
In the overtime period, Alabama
A&M looked tired, definitely show
ing symptons of Saturday's triple-ov
ertime victory. After nearly five
minutes had expired in the period,

CONNECTICUT COPS THE CHAMPIONSHIP — The University of Connecticut Huskies edged a tired
Alabama A&M squad 2-1 in overtime Sunday to capture the NCAA national crown. Striker Pedro Deßrito,
shown here after a shot at the Bulldog goalie Kevin Hunt, failed to score in the final but had a key goal
Saturday in U-Conn's semifinal victory over Eastern Illinois
headed in a ball to
give the Huskies a 2-1 overtime
victory.
After the game, U-Conn
coach Joe Marrone described
his strategty in the overtime
period.
"We really needed to put
more pressure on their back
line. Philadelphia Textile had
given 'Bama trouble earlier
with the same type of strategy. I
knew that if we could center
the ball, Jimmy D'Orsaneo
would really challenge for it."
Both of Saturday's semifinal
matches proved to be very ex
citing, perhaps even more so

than the final itself.
The first game between
A&M and the Textile Rams was
as exciting as it was long.
With the game tied at 1 -1 and
just 55 seconds left to play,
Shiferaw scored for the Bull
dogs, giving them the lead and
what looked like the game.
However, only 23 seconds later
with just 32 seconds left in the
game, Philadelphia midfielder
Billy Gunther made an ex
cellent throw-in pass near the
Bulldog goal. Freshman for
ward Sean Fryatt scored, eve
ning the game at 2-2 and send
ing it into sudden-death over

time.
After three scoreless over
time periods of 15 minutes
each, the game went to a
shootout. Originally the rules
stated that the teams were to
play four overtime periods, but
a change had to be made be
cause the match was running
late and Stanford Stadium
doesn't have lights.
In the shootout, Philadelphia
Textile made only 2 of 5 shots
while Alabama made 3 of 4
shots giving the Bulldogs the
victory.
In the other semifinal match,

the Connecticut beat Eastern Il
linois in a close game well
played by both teams.
Connecticut scored first
when senior striker Pedro
Dißrito booted a perfect 35-
yard shot into the upper right
hand corner of the Panther
goal.
Eastern Illinois came right
back when forward Silvano
Corazza scored following a
corner kick by midfielder
Agyeman Prempeh.
Before the end of the first
half, Connecticut's Comrie
shot the half past the Panther
goalie giving the Huskies a 2-1
lead and the victory.

Minnesota, which needed a
last-second basket to edge
Loyola of Chicago, was eighth
with 702 points. Alabama-Birm
ingham, a winner over Missis
sippi in its only game last week,
had 560 points, eight more than
defending national champion
Indiana, which downed Notre
Dame.
Arkansas, which collected
the final first-place vote,
headed the Second Ten. San
Francisco was 12th followed by
Missouri, Tulsa, Nevada-Las
Vegas, Alabama, UCLA, South
western Louisiana, Oregon
State and Georgetown. Last
week, the Second Ten was Ala
bama-Birmingham, Indiana,
Arkansas, San Francisco,
Brigham Young, Missouri, Ala
bama, Nevada-Las Vegas and
Georgetown, D.C.
Southwestern Louisiana, 5-0,
and Oregon State, 2-0, are the
newcomers to the Top Twenty,
replacing Brigham Young —
which lost games to Oregon
State and Nevada-Las Vegas —
and Notre Dame.
