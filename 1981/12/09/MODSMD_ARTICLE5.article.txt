# University resisting ASSU pleas for funds
## 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU and the University
seemed no closer to agreement in
their financial negotiations fol
lowing a meeting yesterday of
ASSU representatives and Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons and
Associate Dean Thomas Massey.
Not only do the ASSU and the
University have "differing
philosophies" on how much sup
port the University should pro
vide, but the two groups have dif
fering views on how the ASSU
should manage its money as well.
According to Massey, the
ASSU's need for more University
financial support hasoccurred be
cause the organization has over
drawn its resources in order to bail
out project failures such as Special
Events-sponsored concerts.

"(Special Events) was under
their control and they didn't ex
ercise the constraint or restraint
necessary," Massey said. Massey
estimated that more than $110,000
came out of ASSU reserves to cov
er for Special Events, the ASSU's
former concert-promoting arm
which was terminated last year.
ASSU members insist, however,
that no Special Events losses were
covered with funds from their op
erating reserve or endowment
funds. Instead they say project re
serve funds, consisting of profits
made by ASSU projects, were
used to cover Special Events costs.
"Special Events has absolutely
no effect on the-operating budget
or on what we're negotiating,"
said Council of Presidents (COP)
member Chris Greene. "The
projects are a separate part of
our budget and the money
used to pay Special Events was
the money accumulated over
the years (in project profits)."
ASSU members emphasized
that under ASSU by-laws they
are not supposed to make prof
its in their projects to use for
operating costs, and called any
efforts to do so "unethical."
According to ASSU Financial
Manager Cynthia Mathewson,
the ASSU "has been forced to
spend project profits on oper
ating expenses" the past sever
al years because the University
has not been funding the ASSU
adequately.
In the negotiations, which
occur every two years, the
ASSU is asking the University to
pay for the financial, legisla
tive, judicial and executive
functions of the organization
as called for in the Associa
tion's constitution. However,
the University stands behind its
financial agreements with the
ASSU for the past six years,
which have only covered bank
ing services.
Massey insists that the
"agreements do not abridge
the constitution," and said the
ASSU wants the University to
pick up additional costs of ap
proximately $30,000 in the new
negotiations. Areas covered by
the money would include part
of the financial manager's
salary, the COP, the senate
chair and deputy chair salaries,
salaries of other various per
sonnel and operating ex
penses, Massey said.
Massey suggested that the
ASSU use fee assessments to
pay for its programs, which he
said is allowable under the
constitution. He also said the
University has been holding
"an emergency reserve for the
ASSU" of $15,000 which can be
added to the ASSU's endow
ment to draw interest.
"(The interest) is not going to
be a lot, but it gives them some
flexibility," Massey said. "It
doesn't necessarily put money
up for grabs if they have losses
in their projects."
In addition, Massey said the
ASSU "needs to find income,
needs stability, and has to set
some priorities given its in
come level."
Mathewson estimated the
interest on the $15,000 would
be approximately 1 percent of
the ASSU's operating budget.
The debate occurs as both
the University and the ASSU
are strapped for funds. Massey
said one of the realities which
must be faced is whether
"there isenough money within
the University to give money to
the ASSU when everyone else
is cutting 2 percent." Massey
was referring to the Univer
sity's call fora 2 percent budget
reduction in each department
this year.
