# University resisting ASSU pleas for funds
## 
### Adam Goodman 
The ASSU and the University
seemed no closer to agreement in
their financial negotiations fol
lowing a meeting yesterday of
ASSU representatives and Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons and
Associate Dean Thomas Massey.
Not only do the ASSU and the
University have "differing
philosophies" on how much sup
port the University should pro
vide, but the two groups have dif
fering views on how the ASSU
should manage its money as well.
According to Massey, the
ASSU's need for more University
financial support hasoccurred be
cause the organization has over
drawn its resources in order to bail
out project failures such as Special
Events-sponsored concerts.

"(Special Events) was under
their control and they didn't ex
ercise the constraint or restraint
necessary," Massey said. Massey
estimated that more than $110,000
came out of ASSU reserves to cov
er for Special Events, the ASSU's
former concert-promoting arm
which was terminated last year.
ASSU members insist, however,
that no Special Events losses were
covered with funds from their op
erating reserve or endowment
funds. Instead they say project re
serve funds, consisting of profits
made by ASSU projects, were
used to cover Special Events costs.
"Special Events has absolutely
no effect on the-operating budget
or on what we're negotiating,"
said Council of Presidents (COP)
