# "Pastry" Huntington: inspiration in a kilt
## 
### Mike Thurman 
After following the Stanford
Women's Field Hockey team
this fall, it's not easy look back
and single out an individual
player for post-season feature
length recognition.
As taught by their coach, the
most important aspect of the
Cardinal hockey season was
the transformation of a group
of individuals, who first met
back in August, into a team
which played head to head
with some of the best squads in
the nation.
Through it all, however, the
focus has been on an un
declared sophomore who real
ly isn't all that crazy about re
ceiving the attentions that are
directed to a leading
scorer/standout player.
Patsy Huntington just likesto
play hockey and go
home"... no big deal.
Yet when you look at her
statistics, it quickly becomes
apparent that the All-America
player is a big deal on both the
Stanford team as well as on the
national field hockey scene.
Earlier this season Coach
Onnie Killefer said of Hunt
ington: "Patsy is our strongest
player. She's one of the top 60
players in the country and hasa
good chanceof makingthe un
der-21 national team."
Huntington closed out her
second brilliant season at Stan
ford several weeks ago, leading
the rebuilding Cards to a win
ning season with 16 goals. As a
freshman the left inside for
ward used her position and
lack of recognition to tally 17
goals, tying the school single
season scoring record.
Downplaying her role as a

scorer, Huntington said, "By
nature of the game it's easier to
bring the ball down the right
side of the field, then to bring it
across to the left in front of the
goal. Therefore, it's easier to
score from the left.
"I don't ever feel that they
(the team) say, 'Here, you go
too team-oriented for that to
happen. Any pressure that I felt
was mostly self-imposed."
Regarding her personal
future in hockey, Huntington
says, "You have to make re
alistic goals for yourself. I
would love it if I could play in
the Olympics, but that's just
too far to look ahead right now.
My goal at the present time is
to make the under-21 national
team."
To get there, Huntington will
focus on continuing to learn
each time she steps out on the
field. "Hockey is such a game
of experience," she said.
"There is so much that can be
learned from every game — it
could be just a little thing, a
new dodge or a move with the
ball.
One activity Huntington en
joys in her spare time is her in
volvement in the Volunteers
for Youth Program, serving as a
"big sister" fora child from
Palo Alto.
"You get so wrapped up in
classes and sports and stuff that
you forget there's more out
there than just Stanford," she
said. "It's very striking when
you see a small child or an
older person on campus. I en
joy the perspective I get from
someone outside the Univer
sity."
