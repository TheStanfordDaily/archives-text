fust a bunch of IM heros
Bill Worden (holding the ball, above) runs to daylight for the Zetes
and Greg Webb (right) displays his artistic sense of balance for Soto as the two teams
captured the 'A' and 'B' league titles respectively in intramural football. The Zetes
defeated the Theta Delts 9-0 and Soto edeed the DU I's 20-19. Soto's "Team Red" let
the Farm know just how dominant it is in IM grids as it also captured the 'Co-Ed' title
by ripping up on the SAE's 26-12.
