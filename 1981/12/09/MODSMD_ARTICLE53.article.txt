## College football's day of days: last comes the Toilet Bowl 
### John Kosner 
So what do you want for
Christmas?
How about another college
football bowl game on New
Year's Day? What do you mean
you'd rather slit your wrists
first? Nonsense. Why not start
your 1982 the way any normal
minded psychopath would: Ex
hume yourself at the crack of
dawn and then flip the dial to
the Tournament of Roses Pa
rade. After that, don't stop till
you've watched way too much
— namely, the Fiesta Bowl, the
newest addition to college
football's day of days (NBC-TV,
10:30 a.m. Pacific Time), the
Cotton Bowl (CBS, 11 a.m.), the
Rose Bowl (NBC, 2 p.m.), the
Orange Bowl (NBC, 5 p.m.), the
Sugar Bowl (ABC, 5 p.m.), and
naturally the door which leads
to the Toilet Bowl (anytime).
Clearly this New Year's Day
bill of fare — an exercise in vis
ual indulgence that's straight
out of A CLOCKWORK OR
ANGE — is the sort of thing that
would drive any sensible per
son to drink.
Hangover or no, though,
there is still the problem of the
scheduling conflicts. Of the
five big bowl games, only the
Rose — ironically the worst
game of all — will run alone.
How you are to keep track of
both the two games before the
Rose and the two after is
beyond me. Pass the beer.
FIESTA BOWL (Tempe, Ariz.):
No. 7-ranked (by the AP) Penn
State (9-2) versus No. 8 USC
(9-2).
Early Line: USC favored by
IV2 points.
Mumbojumbo: Heisman
Trophy-winner Marcus Allen
(2342 yards gained, eight 200-

yard games, and a nation-lead
ing 23 touchdowns) had, sim
ply, the greatest season of any
collegiate running back ever.
Unfortunately for the Trojans,
Allen's presence alone will not
be enough to hold off surging
Penn State.
Penn State's offensive line,
anchored by guard Sean Far
rell, will once again be called
upon to open holes for shifty
tailback Curt Warner(lo4 yards
against Pitt).
While (JSC's defensive line is
predictably monstrous, John
Robinson's team is weak on
both sides of the passing game.
Whether the Lions' inconsis
tent quarterback Todd Black
ledge can take advantage of
Trojan shortcomings is another
matter. The feeling here is that
he can.
Prediction: Penn State 24
USC 17

COTTON BOWL (Dallas, Tex
as): No. 3 Alabama (9-1-1) ver
sus No. 6 Texas (9-1-1).
Early Line: Alabama favored
by 1 Vi points.
Mumbojumbo: The last time
these two teams met was right
here nine yearsago. On that af
ternoon — in a game whose
pre-game buildup, or lack of
one, mirrors this year's affair —
Texas rallied to dry the Tide,
17-13. It is tempting to go with
the Longhorns again. Tempt
ing, but probably not too
smart. Texas' two best players,
defensive tackle Kenneth Sims
(broken leg) and tailback A.J.
(Jam) Jones (always injured),
are both out — leaving the
Horns undermanned against
one of the deepest teams in the
game.
The thought of national
championship number seven
will no doubt cross 'Bama

coach Bear Bryant's mind be
tween now and New Year's,
but it will take a minor miracle
— a big Alabama victory,
coupled with a Pitt stop of
Georgia and a sluggish Nebras
ka win over Clemson — to
make it possible. Texas be
comes victim No. 316.
Prediction: Alabama 21 Tex
as 10
ROSE BOWL(Pasadena, Cal.):
No. 12 Washington (9-2) versus
No. 13 lowa (8-3-0)
Early Line: lowa favored by 3
points.
Mumbojumbo: If you love
defense or the underdog, then
this year's Rose Bowl is indeed
something special.
Here's lowa — separated by
22 years from its last ap
pearance in Pasadena, and 19
from its last winning season —
taking on Washington, which

after two humiliating defeats
(31-0 to UCLA and 26-7 to Ari
zona State) recouped to make
its second straight run to the
Roses. Both teams play knock
up "D" — the Hawkeyes hav
ing held the opposition to one
TD or less eight times, and the
Huskies having limited ex
plosive USC and Washington
State to a combined 13 points
in the season's final two games
— and both have trumps. For
lowa, it's the punting of Reggie
Roby (49.8 yards a boot). For
Washington, it's Don James'
splendid special teams.
Prediction: Washington 14
lowa 13
ORANGE BOWL (Miami, Fla.):
No. 1 Clemson (11-0) versus
No. 4 Nebraska (9-2)
Early Line: Nebraska favored
by 4.
Mumbojumbo: Top-ranked

Clemson — unknown to
almost everyone except the
NCAA recruiting violations
committee — needs only a vic
tory over crippled Nebraska
(which will evidently be
without injured star quarter
back Turner Gill) to answer all
those questions about ACC
football.
The no-name Tigers play ter
rific defense (only allowing 8.2
points a game) and feature the
fancy passing combo of QB
Homer Jordan to wide receiver
Perry Tuttle. Against Nebraska,
however, the Tigers may find
themselves caged.
With the exception of the in
jury to Gill, both the tangibles
and the intangibles favor Ne
braska. The Huskers played a
harder schedule and they have
been to the Big Time before.
Not so for Clemson.
Prediction: Nebraska 23

Clemson 14
SUGAR BOWL (New Orleans,
La.): No. 2 Georgia (10-1) ver
sus No. 10 Pittsburgh (10-1)
Early Line: Pittsburgh fa
vored by 1.
Mumbojumbo: Penn State's
48-14 walloping of Pitt sure
took the lustre off this one in a
hurry, huh? Now only Georgia
has the true incentive (a nice
win here and an unimpressive
Nebraska victory in Miami
would probably bring the
Dawgs their second straight na
tional crown) and therein lies
the secret to this game.
To revisit the promised land,
Georgia must hold down the
Panthers' dandy Dan Marino
(the best quarterback prospect
e.ist of Flwav) while also getting
the standard wonderous per
formance from its 222-pound
tailback Herschel Walker.
Prediction: Georgia 27 Pitt 17
