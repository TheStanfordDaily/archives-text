## Fish makes comeback 
### Susan Spaeth 
One of the several hundred endangered
species in the United States is making a come
back, but its troubles are not over.
Recently scientists observed spawning of
the cui-ui, a carp-like sucker fish, in its natural
spawning territory in the Truckee River for
the first time in 40 years, said Gary Scoppet
tone, fishery biologist with the Fish and Wild
life Service.
But the cui-ui is in fierce competition with
the city of Reno, Nevada, the Fallon agricul
tural area, and other concerns which divert
substantial amounts of water from the
Truckee River as it flows 120 miles from its ori
gins in the Sierra Nevada, through Lake
Tahoe, to Pyramid Lake, the cui-ui's only hab
itat.
According to a Fish and Wildlife Service re
port, the survival of the cui-ui is of special in
terest to the Paiute Indians, for whom the fish
is a traditional, highly-valued food source,
and who operate Pyramid Lake asa water rec
reation area and fishery.
Biologist Scoppettone said that the eggs of
the cui-ui cannot tolerate the relatively high
salt concentration of Pyramid Lake whose
only sizeable tributary is the Truckee River.
The cui-ui, therefore, must spawn in the river
or its side channels.
But according to a Fish and Wildlife Service
report, a series of water diversions for munic
ipal, industrial and agricultural use have re
duced tremendously the flow of water in the
Truckee River, especially towards its termi
nus. One project alone, the Truckee Canal,
diverts 50 percent of the Truckee's annual
flow, according to the report. The result of
these diversions has been a drop of 80 feet in
the lake's water level over the last 80 years
and the formation of a massive delta at the
river's mouth, which prevents the cui-ui from
reaching their spawning ground, Scoppet
tone said.
Pyramid Lake once harbored the largest

Western trout species, the Lahoutan cut
throat, another obligate stream spawner, ac
cording to a Fish and Wildlife Service report.
But the same problems that threaten the cui
ui extinguished the naturally reproducing
population of the popular, world-famous
trout, according to the report. In particular,
the construction of Derby Dam in 1905, 38
miles upstream from Pyramid Lake, led to
excessive water draw-off from the Truckee
and left thousands of dead spawners in the
lower river as early as 1911, according to the
report.
To facilitate spawning of species surviving
in Pyramid Lake, a three-mile long fishway
which bvpasses the blocked river mouth, was
built in 1976, Scoppettone said. Scientists sus
pected that cui-ui have been spawning suc
cessfully since that time, but were unable to
document their belief partly because the fish
spawn at night. This past spring, with the help
of special goggles designed by the U.S. Army
to enhance night vision, biologists were able
to observe active spawning bv adult cui-ui
which were placed in a side channel of the
Truckee River.
"It was terrific to see," Scoppettone said
about the spawning. The fish typically spawn
in groups of three to seven fora few seconds,
a couple of hundred times over a three to five
day period, he said. The adults then return to
live in Pyramid Lake until the next spawning
run the following spring. Shortly after hatch
ing, the young cui-ui migrate to the lake
where they live, usually out of human sight,
untilthey begin thespawningcyclefouryears
later.
Bv supplementing natural spawning with
the release of artificially raised young, the
Fish and Wildlife Service hopes to restore the
cui-ui population. "There are numerous en
dangered species," Scoppettone said, "and
this one has a real shot at recovering" — if
Pyramid Lake gets enough water.
