# Will antibiotics continue to be our wonder drug?
## 
### Linda Brown (Second of two parts 
Part one of this series, which appeared last
week, discussed certain bacteria's increased
resistance to antibiotics. The first part also
stated that unnecessary prescription of the
"wonder drugs" by physicians is hastening
the increase in resistance, which threatens to
leave our most potent enemy against bac
teria, antibiotics, totally useless.
Overuse of antibiotics has three potential
ly adverse effects. First, it increases the risk of
allergic reaction. Second, it promotes the
growth of non-targeted bacterial strains
which are normally suppressed by the body,
as was the case with Legionnaire's Disease,
an infection which first appeared in the late
70s. Third, any increase in use increases the
risk of unpleasant side effects, which ranges
from bone marrow depression to yellowing
of teeth in children.
In January 1980, the Canadian Medical As
sociation Journal published a report which
indicated that one out of three children at a
children's hospital in Winnipeg were pre
scribed antibiotics unnecessarily. Similar fin
dings were reported in studies of adult pa
tient populations.
These findings are particularly disturbing
because hospitals are fertile breeding
grounds of resistance. In his book, A Clini
cian's Guide to Antibiotic Therapy, Paul
Noone explained that the effects of adminis
tering antibiotics in hospital settings are so
cial as well as personal.
"The widespread pollution of the hospital
environment with antibiotics affects all those
who reside or work in the place. Those most
at risk are of course the debilitated patients.
Although outside of the hospital the effects
of antibiotic usage are diluted to a greater
degree, there is no doubt that there is a sig
nificant trend toward the general prolifera
tion of resistant strains of bacteria among the
population."
The so-called "nosocomial," or hospital

acquired infections that occur as a result of
the spread of resistant strains can be life
threatening to the debilitated patient, whose
natural defenses are already somewhat
weakened.
If the consequences of overuse are so
great, then why do physicians continue to
prescribe antibiotics without first verifying
their diagnoses?
First, it takes time to grow cultures and
complete tests, and the patient may be suf
fering in the meantime. The realities of med
ical practice demand immediate response.
"In teaching centers we're often accused
of a sort of purist type of view, that is, of the
way you go about treating infections," said
Kenneth Vosti, professor of medicine here.
First you make a diagnosis. Then ideally you
would wait for the culture to come back so
you know exactly what the organism is.
"But of course the dynamics of the situ
ation is that, very often, you have to treat the
patient on the presumption of what it's
statistically likely to be . . . because the cul
ture will take probably between 24 and 48
hours before you know what you're working
with," he said.
A second reason for overprescribing is ec
onomic. It is often much cheaper fora pa
tient to try out a drug than to have extensive
lab tests done.
There are other reasons as well. Dr. James
McClenahan, director of the Cowell Student
112 Jealth Center, said that in the case of a per
sistent cold or cough, a trial dose of an anti
biotic may be prescribed without a culture to
see if a secondary infection is at work.
"In such cases," he said, "we try to use a
fairly benign antibiotic — one that has a high
chance of doing good and a low chance of
side effects."
This practice is the exception, however,
not the rule. Cowell's general policy is to
prescribe a minimal number of drugs. Ac
cording to McClenahan, the doctors actively
encourage each other to write prescriptions

only when necessary.
McClenahan and Vosti agree that physi
cians in general should be more selective in
the drugs they prescribe. Because most bac
terial infections respond to more than one
type of treatment, it is possible to rotate anti
biotics and to hold certain ones back. In this
way, it is possible to preserve an antibiotic's
effectiveness.
Patients must also take some responsibility
for the number of prescriptions that are writ
ten. McClenahan believes that antibiotic use
would dropoff by half if patients took a more
skeptical approach to the drugs.
Paradoxically, taking too little of an anti
biotic can be as bad as, if not worse than, tak
ing too much. In any concentration of bac
teria there are bound to be a few naturally
resistant organisms. When a patient stops
taking a drug too early, he runs the risks of
killing off only the most sensitive organisms
while leaving the resistant ones intact. The
few bacteria that remain will then multiply
and may even bring about a relapse of infec
tion, which would be in turn more difficult
to treat.
There is yet another dimension to the re
sistance problem, one which lies beyond the
influence of doctors and patients alike. It is
the controversial use of antibiotics in animal
feeds.
Approximately two-thirds of our beef and
dairy cattle as well as nearly 100 percent of
our poultry, hogs and veal calves eat foods
laced with antibiotics.
The intent is twofold. First, it serves a
prophylactic purpose, holding disease down
in crowded pens. Second, it promotes
growth by as much as 5 to 10 percent. The
two factors combine to hold prices down by
increasing meat output.
Traces of antibiotics eventually wind up in
our meat and dairy products. Investigators
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture have
turned up numerous cases in which anti
biotic residues were discovered. Their find

ings represent only a sampling of the total
livestock population.
The controversy centers around the extent
to which these antibiotics contribute to the
overall spread of bacterial resistance.
The FDA has taken the position that the
antibiotics do indeed pose a threat to hu
mans. A report released in June 1979 by the
FDA Office of Technological Assessment
(OTA) reaffirmed the findings of a 1972 task
force study, which had concluded that the
use of drugs such as penicillin and
tetracycline in animal feeds presented a
long-term risk to human health. The report
went on to recommend a ban on the use of
specific antibiotics such as penicillin and
tetracycline in animal feeds.
Much of the evidence to support this view
has been inferred from the experiences of
farm hands and slaughterhouse workers,
who tend to have more drug resistant bac
teria in their intestines than the general pop
ulation.
According to OTA project staff director
J.B. Cordaro, "We all agreed that physician
prescribing and veterinarian prescribing
habits are much more significant than the is
sue we were dealing with." But the FDA is
powerless to regulate the manner in which
drugs are prescribed, whereas it does have
the power to recommend which drugs
should be permissable.
Donald Kennedy, formercommissionerof
the FDA and currently University president,
strongly advocates the regulatory agency's
position. FHe pointed out that the FDA pro
posal called for selective rather than across
the-board bans, an approach which he con
siders to be moderate and just.
On the other side of the argument are the
powerful lobbies of the livestock producers
and the drug companies. The producers dis
pute the findings of the FDA and argue that
antibiotics in animal feeds play only a negli
gible role in the spread of resistance. The

drug companies have a substantial interest in
the outcome of the debate — 40 percent of
all antibiotics produced in the United States
wind up in animal feed!
Dr. Thomas Jukes, the man credited with
the discovery of the growth-promoting qual
ities of antibiotics in 1949, remains steadfast
in his support of the practice of using the
drugs in feeds. After years of exhaustive re
search on the subject, Jukes, now a professor
at UC-Berkeley, stated emphatically that no
harmful effects on public health in the Unit
ed States that are attributable by experimen
tal evidence to the use of antibiotics in
animal feeds have been reported.
"Even when tetracyclines were used in the
United States and Canada in a dipping proc
ess for poulry, meat and fish," he said, "no
deleterious effects on consumers were re
ported. Such poultry and fish contained
levels of tetracyclines far higherthan anyen
countered in animals receiving antibiotics in
feeds."
Hesitant to make a final decision on the
debate, Congress in 1978 commissioned the
National Academy of Sciences to conduct its
own study. In March 1980, the committee re
ported that the evidence available did not
conclusively support either view, and
furthermore, that "insurmountable techni
cal difficulties" made it impossible to con
duct an adequate study of the subject.
The report did state, however, that "the
lack of data linking human illness with this
subtherapeutic use must not be equated
with proof that the proposed hazards do not
exist." And so the debate continues.
Reviewing the problem of antibiotic re
sistance in itsentirety, the outlook is relative
ly optimistic. It may not be possible to beat
bacteria at their own game, but with some
minor concessions by each of the players in
volved — the physicians, the patients, the
livestock producersand the drug companies
— we may be able to end the game in a draw.

feeds.
Approximately two-thirds of our beef and
dairy cattle as well as nearly 100 percent of
our poultry, hogs and veal calves eat foods
laced with antibiotics.
The intent is twofold. First, it serves a
prophylactic purpose, holding disease down
in crowded pens. Second, it promotes
growth by as much as 5 to 10 percent. The
two factors combine to hold prices down by
increasing meat output.
Traces of antibiotics eventually wind up in
our meat and dairy products. Investigators
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture have
turned up numerous cases in which anti
biotic residues were discovered. Their find

ings represent only a sampling of the total
livestock population.
The controversy centers around the extent
to which these antibiotics contribute to the
overall spread of bacterial resistance.
The FDA has taken the position that the
antibiotics do indeed pose a threat to hu
mans. A report released in June 1979 by the
FDA Office of Technological Assessment
(OTA) reaffirmed the findings of a 1972 task
force study, which had concluded that the
use of drugs such as penicillin and
tetracycline in animal feeds presented a
long-term risk to human health. The report
went on to recommend a ban on the use of
specific antibiotics such as penicillin and
tetracycline in animal feeds.
Much of the evidence to support this view
has been inferred from the experiences of
farm hands and slaughterhouse workers,
who tend to have more drug resistant bac
teria in their intestines than the general pop
ulation.
According to OTA project staff director
J.B. Cordaro, "We all agreed that physician
prescribing and veterinarian prescribing
habits are much more significant than the is
sue we were dealing with." But the FDA is
powerless to regulate the manner in which
drugs are prescribed, whereas it does have
the power to recommend which drugs
should be permissable.
Donald Kennedy, formercommissionerof
the FDA and currently University president,
strongly advocates the regulatory agency's
position. FHe pointed out that the FDA pro
posal called for selective rather than across
the-board bans, an approach which he con
siders to be moderate and just.
On the other side of the argument are the
powerful lobbies of the livestock producers
and the drug companies. The producers dis
pute the findings of the FDA and argue that
antibiotics in animal feeds play only a negli
gible role in the spread of resistance. The

drug companies have a substantial interest in
the outcome of the debate — 40 percent of
all antibiotics produced in the United States
wind up in animal feed!
Dr. Thomas Jukes, the man credited with
the discovery of the growth-promoting qual
ities of antibiotics in 1949, remains steadfast
in his support of the practice of using the
drugs in feeds. After years of exhaustive re
search on the subject, Jukes, now a professor
at UC-Berkeley, stated emphatically that no
harmful effects on public health in the Unit
ed States that are attributable by experimen
tal evidence to the use of antibiotics in
animal feeds have been reported.
"Even when tetracyclines were used in the
United States and Canada in a dipping proc
ess for poulry, meat and fish," he said, "no
deleterious effects on consumers were re
ported. Such poultry and fish contained
levels of tetracyclines far higherthan anyen
countered in animals receiving antibiotics in
feeds."
Hesitant to make a final decision on the
debate, Congress in 1978 commissioned the
National Academy of Sciences to conduct its
own study. In March 1980, the committee re
ported that the evidence available did not
conclusively support either view, and
furthermore, that "insurmountable techni
cal difficulties" made it impossible to con
duct an adequate study of the subject.
The report did state, however, that "the
lack of data linking human illness with this
subtherapeutic use must not be equated
with proof that the proposed hazards do not
exist." And so the debate continues.
Reviewing the problem of antibiotic re
sistance in itsentirety, the outlook is relative
ly optimistic. It may not be possible to beat
bacteria at their own game, but with some
minor concessions by each of the players in
volved — the physicians, the patients, the
livestock producersand the drug companies
— we may be able to end the game in a draw.
Part one of this series, which appeared last
week, discussed certain bacteria's increased
resistance to antibiotics. The first part also
stated that unnecessary prescription of the
"wonder drugs" by physicians is hastening
the increase in resistance, which threatens to
leave our most potent enemy against bac
teria, antibiotics, totally useless.
Overuse of antibiotics has three potential
ly adverse effects. First, it increases the risk of
allergic reaction. Second, it promotes the
growth of non-targeted bacterial strains
which are normally suppressed by the body,
as was the case with Legionnaire's Disease,
an infection which first appeared in the late
70s. Third, any increase in use increases the
risk of unpleasant side effects, which ranges
from bone marrow depression to yellowing
of teeth in children.
In January 1980, the Canadian Medical As
sociation Journal published a report which
indicated that one out of three children at a
children's hospital in Winnipeg were pre
scribed antibiotics unnecessarily. Similar fin
dings were reported in studies of adult pa
tient populations.
These findings are particularly disturbing
because hospitals are fertile breeding
grounds of resistance. In his book, A Clini
cian's Guide to Antibiotic Therapy, Paul
Noone explained that the effects of adminis
tering antibiotics in hospital settings are so
cial as well as personal.
"The widespread pollution of the hospital
environment with antibiotics affects all those
who reside or work in the place. Those most
at risk are of course the debilitated patients.
Although outside of the hospital the effects
of antibiotic usage are diluted to a greater
degree, there is no doubt that there is a sig
nificant trend toward the general prolifera
tion of resistant strains of bacteria among the
population."
The so-called "nosocomial," or hospital

acquired infections that occur as a result of
the spread of resistant strains can be life
threatening to the debilitated patient, whose
natural defenses are already somewhat
weakened.
If the consequences of overuse are so
great, then why do physicians continue to
prescribe antibiotics without first verifying
their diagnoses?
First, it takes time to grow cultures and
complete tests, and the patient may be suf
fering in the meantime. The realities of med
ical practice demand immediate response.
"In teaching centers we're often accused
of a sort of purist type of view, that is, of the
way you go about treating infections," said
Kenneth Vosti, professor of medicine here.
First you make a diagnosis. Then ideally you
would wait for the culture to come back so
you know exactly what the organism is.
"But of course the dynamics of the situ
ation is that, very often, you have to treat the
patient on the presumption of what it's
statistically likely to be . . . because the cul
ture will take probably between 24 and 48
hours before you know what you're working
with," he said.
A second reason for overprescribing is ec
onomic. It is often much cheaper fora pa
tient to try out a drug than to have extensive
lab tests done.
There are other reasons as well. Dr. James
McClenahan, director of the Cowell Student
112 Jealth Center, said that in the case of a per
sistent cold or cough, a trial dose of an anti
biotic may be prescribed without a culture to
see if a secondary infection is at work.
"In such cases," he said, "we try to use a
fairly benign antibiotic — one that has a high
chance of doing good and a low chance of
side effects."
This practice is the exception, however,
not the rule. Cowell's general policy is to
prescribe a minimal number of drugs. Ac
cording to McClenahan, the doctors actively
encourage each other to write prescriptions

only when necessary.
McClenahan and Vosti agree that physi
cians in general should be more selective in
the drugs they prescribe. Because most bac
terial infections respond to more than one
type of treatment, it is possible to rotate anti
biotics and to hold certain ones back. In this
way, it is possible to preserve an antibiotic's
effectiveness.
Patients must also take some responsibility
for the number of prescriptions that are writ
ten. McClenahan believes that antibiotic use
would dropoff by half if patients took a more
skeptical approach to the drugs.
Paradoxically, taking too little of an anti
biotic can be as bad as, if not worse than, tak
ing too much. In any concentration of bac
teria there are bound to be a few naturally
resistant organisms. When a patient stops
taking a drug too early, he runs the risks of
killing off only the most sensitive organisms
while leaving the resistant ones intact. The
few bacteria that remain will then multiply
and may even bring about a relapse of infec
tion, which would be in turn more difficult
to treat.
There is yet another dimension to the re
sistance problem, one which lies beyond the
influence of doctors and patients alike. It is
the controversial use of antibiotics in animal
feeds.
Approximately two-thirds of our beef and
dairy cattle as well as nearly 100 percent of

risk of unpleasant side effects, which ranges
from bone marrow depression to yellowing
of teeth in children.
In January 1980, the Canadian Medical As
sociation Journal published a report which
indicated that one out of three children at a
children's hospital in Winnipeg were pre
scribed antibiotics unnecessarily. Similar fin
dings were reported in studies of adult pa
tient populations.
These findings are particularly disturbing
because hospitals are fertile breeding
grounds of resistance. In his book, A Clini
cian's Guide to Antibiotic Therapy, Paul
Noone explained that the effects of adminis
tering antibiotics in hospital settings are so
cial as well as personal.
"The widespread pollution of the hospital
environment with antibiotics affects all those
who reside or work in the place. Those most
at risk are of course the debilitated patients.
Although outside of the hospital the effects
of antibiotic usage are diluted to a greater
degree, there is no doubt that there is a sig
nificant trend toward the general prolifera
tion of resistant strains of bacteria among the
population."
The so-called "nosocomial," or hospital

acquired infections that occur as a result of
the spread of resistant strains can be life
threatening to the debilitated patient, whose
natural defenses are already somewhat
weakened.
If the consequences of overuse are so
great, then why do physicians continue to
prescribe antibiotics without first verifying
their diagnoses?
First, it takes time to grow cultures and
complete tests, and the patient may be suf
fering in the meantime. The realities of med
ical practice demand immediate response.
"In teaching centers we're often accused
of a sort of purist type of view, that is, of the
way you go about treating infections," said
Kenneth Vosti, professor of medicine here.
First you make a diagnosis. Then ideally you
would wait for the culture to come back so
you know exactly what the organism is.
"But of course the dynamics of the situ
ation is that, very often, you have to treat the
patient on the presumption of what it's
statistically likely to be . . . because the cul
ture will take probably between 24 and 48
hours before you know what you're working
with," he said.
A second reason for overprescribing is ec
onomic. It is often much cheaper fora pa
tient to try out a drug than to have extensive
lab tests done.
There are other reasons as well. Dr. James
McClenahan, director of the Cowell Student
112 Jealth Center, said that in the case of a per
sistent cold or cough, a trial dose of an anti
biotic may be prescribed without a culture to
see if a secondary infection is at work.
"In such cases," he said, "we try to use a
fairly benign antibiotic — one that has a high
chance of doing good and a low chance of
side effects."
This practice is the exception, however,
not the rule. Cowell's general policy is to
prescribe a minimal number of drugs. Ac
cording to McClenahan, the doctors actively
encourage each other to write prescriptions

only when necessary.
McClenahan and Vosti agree that physi
cians in general should be more selective in
the drugs they prescribe. Because most bac
terial infections respond to more than one
type of treatment, it is possible to rotate anti
biotics and to hold certain ones back. In this
way, it is possible to preserve an antibiotic's
effectiveness.
Patients must also take some responsibility
for the number of prescriptions that are writ
ten. McClenahan believes that antibiotic use
would dropoff by half if patients took a more
skeptical approach to the drugs.
Paradoxically, taking too little of an anti
biotic can be as bad as, if not worse than, tak
ing too much. In any concentration of bac
teria there are bound to be a few naturally
resistant organisms. When a patient stops
taking a drug too early, he runs the risks of
killing off only the most sensitive organisms
while leaving the resistant ones intact. The
few bacteria that remain will then multiply
and may even bring about a relapse of infec
tion, which would be in turn more difficult
to treat.
There is yet another dimension to the re
sistance problem, one which lies beyond the
influence of doctors and patients alike. It is
the controversial use of antibiotics in animal
feeds.
Approximately two-thirds of our beef and
dairy cattle as well as nearly 100 percent of
our poultry, hogs and veal calves eat foods
laced with antibiotics.
The intent is twofold. First, it serves a
prophylactic purpose, holding disease down
in crowded pens. Second, it promotes
growth by as much as 5 to 10 percent. The
two factors combine to hold prices down by
increasing meat output.
Traces of antibiotics eventually wind up in
our meat and dairy products. Investigators
for the U.S. Department of Agriculture have
turned up numerous cases in which anti
biotic residues were discovered. Their find

ings represent only a sampling of the total
livestock population.
The controversy centers around the extent
to which these antibiotics contribute to the
overall spread of bacterial resistance.
The FDA has taken the position that the
antibiotics do indeed pose a threat to hu
mans. A report released in June 1979 by the
FDA Office of Technological Assessment
(OTA) reaffirmed the findings of a 1972 task
force study, which had concluded that the
use of drugs such as penicillin and
tetracycline in animal feeds presented a
long-term risk to human health. The report
went on to recommend a ban on the use of
specific antibiotics such as penicillin and
tetracycline in animal feeds.
Much of the evidence to support this view
has been inferred from the experiences of
farm hands and slaughterhouse workers,
who tend to have more drug resistant bac
teria in their intestines than the general pop
ulation.
According to OTA project staff director
J.B. Cordaro, "We all agreed that physician
prescribing and veterinarian prescribing
habits are much more significant than the is
sue we were dealing with." But the FDA is
powerless to regulate the manner in which
drugs are prescribed, whereas it does have
the power to recommend which drugs
should be permissable.
Donald Kennedy, formercommissionerof
the FDA and currently University president,
strongly advocates the regulatory agency's
position. FHe pointed out that the FDA pro
posal called for selective rather than across
the-board bans, an approach which he con
siders to be moderate and just.
On the other side of the argument are the
powerful lobbies of the livestock producers
and the drug companies. The producers dis
pute the findings of the FDA and argue that
antibiotics in animal feeds play only a negli
gible role in the spread of resistance. The

drug companies have a substantial interest in
the outcome of the debate — 40 percent of
all antibiotics produced in the United States
wind up in animal feed!
Dr. Thomas Jukes, the man credited with
the discovery of the growth-promoting qual
ities of antibiotics in 1949, remains steadfast
in his support of the practice of using the
drugs in feeds. After years of exhaustive re
search on the subject, Jukes, now a professor
at UC-Berkeley, stated emphatically that no
harmful effects on public health in the Unit
ed States that are attributable by experimen
tal evidence to the use of antibiotics in
animal feeds have been reported.
"Even when tetracyclines were used in the
United States and Canada in a dipping proc
ess for poulry, meat and fish," he said, "no
deleterious effects on consumers were re
ported. Such poultry and fish contained
levels of tetracyclines far higherthan anyen
countered in animals receiving antibiotics in
feeds."
Hesitant to make a final decision on the
debate, Congress in 1978 commissioned the
National Academy of Sciences to conduct its
own study. In March 1980, the committee re
ported that the evidence available did not
conclusively support either view, and
furthermore, that "insurmountable techni
cal difficulties" made it impossible to con
duct an adequate study of the subject.
The report did state, however, that "the
lack of data linking human illness with this
subtherapeutic use must not be equated
with proof that the proposed hazards do not
exist." And so the debate continues.
Reviewing the problem of antibiotic re
sistance in itsentirety, the outlook is relative
ly optimistic. It may not be possible to beat
bacteria at their own game, but with some
minor concessions by each of the players in
volved — the physicians, the patients, the
livestock producersand the drug companies
— we may be able to end the game in a draw.
Part one of this series, which appeared last
week, discussed certain bacteria's increased
resistance to antibiotics. The first part also
stated that unnecessary prescription of the
"wonder drugs" by physicians is hastening
the increase in resistance, which threatens to
leave our most potent enemy against bac
teria, antibiotics, totally useless.
Overuse of antibiotics has three potential
ly adverse effects. First, it increases the risk of
allergic reaction. Second, it promotes the
growth of non-targeted bacterial strains
which are normally suppressed by the body,
as was the case with Legionnaire's Disease,
an infection which first appeared in the late
70s. Third, any increase in use increases the
risk of unpleasant side effects, which ranges
from bone marrow depression to yellowing
of teeth in children.
In January 1980, the Canadian Medical As
