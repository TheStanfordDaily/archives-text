## Home away from home for the holidays 
### Annette Makino 
Stanford can be a lonely place for the
many students, faculty and staff who re
main over winter break while their friends
go home for the holidays.
For this reason, the Bechtel Interna
tional Center (l-Center), is sponsoring
Holiday House, a program providing com
panionship and entertainment for the
Stanford community during winter break.
The various events and excursions,
which begin on Dec. 18 and continue
through Jan. 3, include cross-country

skiing at Yosemite, Christmas caroling on
Lake Merritt, international folk-dancing, a
walking tour of San Francisco, and a Han
nukah supper and a hike at Angel Island.
"The purpose of Holiday House is to
provide a warm, festive atmosphere for
people who aren't going away for the
holidays," said Penny Thorpe, program co
ordinator for the l-Center.
People are encouraged not only to par
ticipate in the many planned activities, but
also to just drop by the l-Center any time
during winter break to read by the fire,

watch TV, play pool or ping-pong and en
joy the company of others, she said.
With Holday House, now in its third
year, the l-Center hopes to capture the
spirit of the entire holiday season, rather
than just Christmas. "We try to have a vari
ety of events that appeal to everyone â€” ac
tivities for families with children, a hike
and a bike trip foroutdoorsy people. Some
events focus on Christmas and Hannukah,
while others are completely secular," said
Thorpe. "Holiday House is for everyone at
Stanford and not just foreign students,"
