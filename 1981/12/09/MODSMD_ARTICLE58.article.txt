## Men respond to rape with education, discussion 
### Jeffrey Golden 
Few issues have the power to
pack several hundred mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty into White Plaza for more
than an hourofspeeches. Rape
is one of them. Those who
came Nov. 17 to hear students
and faculty "Speak Out Against
Rape," as a flowing banner
near the microphone put it,
were attentive and quiet, their
individual daily concerns set
aside fora long moment.
One glance at the headlines
of the two weeks preceding the
rally fully explains why so many
women were there. The rapes
of Nov. 5 and 10 were only the
latest of six sexual assaults re
ported on the campus since the
beginning of October. The
coming together of potential
victims of this kind of violence
to share each others' strength
and outraged determination
puzzled no one.
But something else hap
pened that afternoon. There
unfolded into public view a
conviction that has been grow
ing steadily in the Stanford
community: the victimsof rape
are of both genders.
"Rape is not a women's
problem,' " said law student
jim Steyer, who spoke at the
rally. "It's a community prob
lem. Women are the first,
brutal casualties, but in the end
it poisons all of us, it cuts away
at the possibility of loving,
trusting relationships."
Education
Steyer's interest began well
before the highly-publicized
cluster of attacks this fall. Last
year he co-founded the Rape
Education Project, which used
video tapes in dormitory pres
entations to encourage men to

reach as deeply within them
selves as they can and pull out
their inner feelings about their
sexuality and about women.
"Men's Lives," an accredited
course he designed and hopes
to teach fora second time this
spring, offers an ongoing fo
rum for people to share their
inner discoveries and stimulate
each other to new ones.
Steyer's concern with fun
damental issues of male sex
uality bring him directly to the
rape awareness campaign.
"Rape is the ultimate, extreme
manifestation of the mosttradi
tional dominance roles that
men have over women in our
society," he said. "That's why
I'm into working on it. It lets
men see in dramatic form a lot
of things they should be ques
tioning in the first place."
He stressed that rape is not a
bizarre aberration distinctly
separate from the rest of hu
man sexual relations, but "the
extreme end of a continuum;
most men are not very close to
that end, but somewhere along
the way."
Views of rape
Others who have been pro
moting greater community
awareness would argue that
rape includes an arc of several
degrees, and not just an end
point, on that continuum. "I
call it rape," visiting Law Pro
fessor Catherine MacKinnon
told the White Plaza crowd,
"when a woman has in
tercourse and feels violated."
Her definition multiples the
number of "rapists" by a factor
of thousands; MacKinnon said
most rapes occur between
people who know each other,
even in couple relationships.
Although she accepts the

proposition that rape, by de
molishing bonds of trust and
intimacy, makes victims of both
sexes, she reminds us that the
victimizers are of one sex only.
"Men alone can bring an
end to rape," she said, "and
thev can do that only by recog
nizing and laying bare the roles
of dominance and control, and
even contempt for women,
that our society has forced
upon them."
MacKinnon said she sup
ports the formation of groups
in which men can help one an
other become aware of their
underlying sexual attitudes,
but sees how a disabling smug
ness could set it.
"One has to be careful," she
said, "not to let an abundance
of discussion make men feel
like they know all about the
problem, at which point they
stop questioning themselves."
That won't happen, she sug
gested, if men's groups stay in
touch with women's ongoing
concerns. She said she would
like to see men in regular con
tact with outreach arms of
women's centers and with the
writing of authors such as An
drea Dworkin and Susan
Brownmiller.
Sex roles
So far the local drive for male
sexual awareness has side
stepped the kind of isolation
MacKinnon fears. The two pro
grams presented on campus
this fall bv Richard Snowden, a
San Francisco organizer of
Men Against Male Violence,
have drawn sizeable mixed au
diences. Instead of the riveting
problem of rape, Snowden
uses a 45-minute slide show as a
catalyst to trigger group ex
plorations of the issues of sex

ual roles and emotions.
The slides are a survey of dif
ferent media depictions of
women that both manipulate
and mold the most dehumaniz
ing of male perceptions. Play
boy's "soft porn," that alter
nately deifies and degrades
women, is represented, and so
is Hustler's "raunch," which
openly celebrates their sub
jugation.
Many of the images were
created in Madison Avenue
studios and pictorially endorse

the brutalization of women in
stunningly direct ways: a male
model demonstrates the
breezy free comfort of a new
leisure coat by slapping around
the room a female model, who
is sporting a smart little outfit
that is just right forthat big eve
ning of abuse.
Cultural images
Snowden's message is that
the cultural images of male
dominance are so pervasive,
constant, and accepted that we

cannot hope to resist them un
til we pull them into our con
scious awareness. The dis
cussions that follow his slides
do more than that.
"He asks a question or two,
and then it sort of takes its own
direction," said freshman
Leonard Lattanzi. "It opens up
practically everything that's
important to us. The full impact
doesn't even hit you until two
or three days later."
When it hit Lattanzi, he met
again with half a dozen other

men who saw the program and
are determined to spread the
awareness it gave them. The
group is looking fora suitable
name and plans to sponsor a
week of speakers and program
sometime next month. The re
sult, Lattanzi hopes, will be an
organization with enough
energy, sensitivity and brainsto
provide resources that make
increased sexual and human
gentleness a constantly ac
cessible goal in the Stanford
community.

do more than that.
"He asks a question or two,
and then it sort of takes its own
direction," said freshman
Leonard Lattanzi. "It opens up
practically everything that's
important to us. The full impact
doesn't even hit you until two
or three days later."
When it hit Lattanzi, he met
again with half a dozen other

men who saw the program and
are determined to spread the
awareness it gave them. The
group is looking fora suitable
name and plans to sponsor a
week of speakers and program
sometime next month. The re
sult, Lattanzi hopes, will be an
organization with enough
energy, sensitivity and brainsto
provide resources that make
increased sexual and human
gentleness a constantly ac
cessible goal in the Stanford
community.
Few issues have the power to
pack several hundred mem
bers of the Stanford communi
ty into White Plaza for more
than an hourofspeeches. Rape
is one of them. Those who
came Nov. 17 to hear students
and faculty "Speak Out Against
Rape," as a flowing banner
near the microphone put it,
were attentive and quiet, their
individual daily concerns set
aside fora long moment.
One glance at the headlines
of the two weeks preceding the
rally fully explains why so many
women were there. The rapes
of Nov. 5 and 10 were only the
latest of six sexual assaults re
ported on the campus since the
beginning of October. The
coming together of potential
victims of this kind of violence
to share each others' strength
and outraged determination
puzzled no one.
But something else hap
pened that afternoon. There
unfolded into public view a
conviction that has been grow
ing steadily in the Stanford
community: the victimsof rape
are of both genders.
"Rape is not a women's
problem,' " said law student
jim Steyer, who spoke at the
rally. "It's a community prob
lem. Women are the first,
brutal casualties, but in the end
it poisons all of us, it cuts away
at the possibility of loving,
trusting relationships."
Education
Steyer's interest began well
before the highly-publicized
cluster of attacks this fall. Last
year he co-founded the Rape
Education Project, which used
video tapes in dormitory pres
entations to encourage men to

reach as deeply within them
selves as they can and pull out
their inner feelings about their
sexuality and about women.
"Men's Lives," an accredited
course he designed and hopes
to teach fora second time this
spring, offers an ongoing fo
rum for people to share their
inner discoveries and stimulate
each other to new ones.
Steyer's concern with fun
damental issues of male sex
uality bring him directly to the
rape awareness campaign.
"Rape is the ultimate, extreme
manifestation of the mosttradi
tional dominance roles that
men have over women in our
society," he said. "That's why
I'm into working on it. It lets
men see in dramatic form a lot
of things they should be ques
tioning in the first place."
He stressed that rape is not a
bizarre aberration distinctly
separate from the rest of hu
man sexual relations, but "the
extreme end of a continuum;
most men are not very close to
that end, but somewhere along
the way."
Views of rape
Others who have been pro
moting greater community
awareness would argue that
rape includes an arc of several
degrees, and not just an end
point, on that continuum. "I
call it rape," visiting Law Pro
fessor Catherine MacKinnon
told the White Plaza crowd,
"when a woman has in
tercourse and feels violated."
Her definition multiples the
number of "rapists" by a factor
of thousands; MacKinnon said
most rapes occur between
people who know each other,
even in couple relationships.
Although she accepts the

proposition that rape, by de
molishing bonds of trust and
intimacy, makes victims of both
sexes, she reminds us that the
victimizers are of one sex only.
"Men alone can bring an
end to rape," she said, "and
thev can do that only by recog
nizing and laying bare the roles
of dominance and control, and
even contempt for women,
that our society has forced
upon them."
MacKinnon said she sup
ports the formation of groups
in which men can help one an
other become aware of their
underlying sexual attitudes,
but sees how a disabling smug
ness could set it.
"One has to be careful," she
said, "not to let an abundance
of discussion make men feel
like they know all about the
problem, at which point they
stop questioning themselves."
That won't happen, she sug
gested, if men's groups stay in
touch with women's ongoing
concerns. She said she would
like to see men in regular con
tact with outreach arms of
women's centers and with the
writing of authors such as An
drea Dworkin and Susan
Brownmiller.
Sex roles
So far the local drive for male
sexual awareness has side
stepped the kind of isolation
MacKinnon fears. The two pro
grams presented on campus
this fall bv Richard Snowden, a
San Francisco organizer of
Men Against Male Violence,
have drawn sizeable mixed au
diences. Instead of the riveting
problem of rape, Snowden
uses a 45-minute slide show as a
catalyst to trigger group ex
plorations of the issues of sex

ual roles and emotions.
The slides are a survey of dif
ferent media depictions of
women that both manipulate
and mold the most dehumaniz
ing of male perceptions. Play
boy's "soft porn," that alter
nately deifies and degrades
women, is represented, and so
is Hustler's "raunch," which
openly celebrates their sub
jugation.
Many of the images were
created in Madison Avenue
studios and pictorially endorse

the brutalization of women in
stunningly direct ways: a male
model demonstrates the
breezy free comfort of a new
leisure coat by slapping around
the room a female model, who
is sporting a smart little outfit
that is just right forthat big eve
ning of abuse.
Cultural images
Snowden's message is that
the cultural images of male
dominance are so pervasive,
constant, and accepted that we

cannot hope to resist them un
til we pull them into our con
scious awareness. The dis
cussions that follow his slides
do more than that.
"He asks a question or two,
