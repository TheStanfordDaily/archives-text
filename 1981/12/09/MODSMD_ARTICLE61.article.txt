# King Crimson gets progressively better (and more exciting)
## 
### Tony Kelly 
Fora long long time, evop
before I became an overrated
headphone attachment and
had to think about music be
cause I got paid for it, I had
thought that King Crimson was
the \)vorst band in the history of
rock, simply because they were
the most pretentious. Oh sure,
you can regale me with your

journeys and your Van Halens
and your Throbbing Gristles
and your Surf Punks, but you
won't change my mind. You
see, for all the pomp and cir
cumstance that other bands in
sist on shoving into their music
like peanuts into M & Ms (a
thoroughly distasteful move as
far as I'm concerned, and guar
anteed to catapult "melting in
my mouth, not in my hands"
off my list of cool things to do),

they still have one guiding
purpose in mind: to make
money. And they succeed, in
their own sp'endidly comatose
way.
King Crimson, on the other
hand, seemed to actually be
lieve the Crackerjack mys
ticism and apocalyptic hoo-ha
on In the Court of the Crimson
King and got even more theo

retical from there. And if you
really think that philosophical
broodings and rock music are
compatible, you're destined
for the Phil Donahue Eternal
Circle of Irrelevancy ("I think
he's God, but my friends say
he's just fat.").
But just when I thought I had
the Crimheads figured out,
thev went and pulled some
thing weird on me. They broke
up. One of the Ten Command-

ments of Progressive Rock
oholism is that thou shalt not
split, though thou may have to
flog many dead horses to keep
product flowing. Instead, King
Crimson — or rather Robert
Fripp, the Grand Guitar
Poobah of said band — de
cided to leave when "its use
fulness was over" (which just
coincidentally was the same
moment when KC was about to
break into the Mass Success
bracket, and if you can play
Connect-the-Dots on that one
give yourself an A for the day).
After all that disillusionment
vou can bet I was thrilled to bits
when King Crimson reformed
under Fripp's aegis. All my
dashed preconceptions came
back to roost and gloat like
maggots over a bag of Rush
records. What happened, guys,
decided you wanted to start
eating again? Got sick and tired
of wandering around alleys
crying "Won't someone record
my new opus?" Couldn't han
dle seeing your records in the
cut out bins at Zody's? FHuh?
And of course, I got faced
again. In the official press re
lease announcing Crimson's
return, Robert Fripp insists that
"it was never my intention to
reform King Crimson. So why,
after several years of flat de
nials? There are several quick
answers:
1. The press misquoted me;
2. No one would believe the
band was going on hold for
seven vears;
3. I was mistaken;
4. Fripp is an opportunist tur
key, a fraud and charlatan."
I'd love to hold him to that
last one, but the man's humor
is just too disarming. Regard
less, I went to the Old Waldorf
with knives sharpened, teeth
clenched, and utterly dis
gusted at the hundreds of sur
rounding proggies, outfitted
with headbands and para
phernalia, screaming
"Schizoid Man" (which I can
only assume is an old Crimson
song) at the top of their herb
laden lungs from the Lincoln
Log chairs and tables at the
Waldorf.
I left looking for all the world
just as amazed and catatonic as
my temporary mates, telling
anyone in my field of vision
how awesome and how tal
ented King Crimson was and

how thoy totally rock — what
ever that moans. What's more, I
still respected mvself the next
morning as I remembered the
show, and that's not easy fora
card-carrying Catholic.
Kini» Crimson's music, while
not quite in the genre from
whence they sprang 12 years
ago, is nonetheless more
progressive than almost any
thing else I have heard in years,
and thus is probably truer to
the name. The sound is un
believably full fora four-piece
outfit — Bill Bruford's drum
ming and veteran session
player (Chuck Mangione, Pe
ter Gabriel, and John Lennon,
to name a few) Tony Levin's
stick bass playing can leap tall
buildings in a single bound,
while the interplay of Fripp and
Adrian Belew's guitars com
mands such concentration just
to listen to that one can't im
agine two people working with
such timing, let alone having
fun in the process. Even more,
the fool thing works. If it
weren't for the Waldorf's in
sistence over and above
Crimson's show contract that
there be no dance floor, the
Waldorf would have been the
unlikely recipient of the Stan
ford Daily Golden Twinkie
Award for "Best Concert Ever
Seen". Seriously. Hell, even the
sound system was great — a
real rarity for the Old Wald.
King Crimson further em
phasized their unique role in
new/old music by concentrat
ing heavilv on newer material
from the just-released-brand
spanking-new Discipline
album, featuring new member
Belew as the front man and re
legating old guards Fripp and
Bruford to the background.
Belew responds in good humor
and style, showing off a pretty
good voice (previously let
loose only in his work with
Frank Zappa, and actively hid
den during his tour with the ex
panded Talking Heads last
year, where Adrian sang his
heart out on every song but
was refused the simple luxury
of a microphone). At the same
time, his guitar work is nothing
less than outstanding, com
pletely ignoring details like
riffs, licks, and harmonies. This
electrifying counterpoint to
the precision of the rest of the
band is the key to the new King

Crimson, and elevates them to
a level populated by a select
few bands — that plateau
where no one else does any
thing similar to them. There is
no longer a genre for King
Crimson, for they are simply
alone in their field.
Also alone in his field, yet
now desperately desirous of

company in the form of an au
dience, is Robert Fripp, the
onlv ordinal Crimson to still
bear the burden of living up to
a popular image. Fripp has
carefully carved out a niche for
himself over the years as sort of
a schizoid man himself; half of
him isa student of guitar whose
style is inimitable and whose
plaving is impeccable, while
the other half is a hopeless aca
demic wrestling with the inner
consequences of playing rock
and roll devil music. While it
mqy be pleasing to those who
see rock as an art form to have
Fripp around for intellectual
gymnastics, too often his
earthly theories traipse over
the edge and fall into the Pit of
Social Pretension.
However, at a press con
ference following the first
night in San Francisco for King
Crimson, Fripp appeared to
have reached a new under

standing of his music and his
role in that music. Whereas
previous Fripp endeavors, such
as a three-year dive into some
thing called Frippertronics,
emphasized the near-fanatical
solitude of the Musician (capi
tal M, of course), the reborn
Robert now speaks of "ap
proaching America in a sense

of critical goodwill — to work
for change from the inside."
Subversive, huh?
But if that is Fripp's intention
in returning to a group with a
ready-made audience of old
Crimson fans, then why break
ever break up the original
groupin the first place? To hear
the articulate Fripper tell it,"In
1969 King Crimson took some
of the european tonal harmon
ic (that's classical to you) tradi
tion. It was a rock band, but it
accepted its cultural baseas Eu
ropean. The later bands that
picked up on the idea of, if you
like, copping classical licks, did
so with a sense of pastiche and
not creation. King Crimson was
the only band to stop at the
right moment, and start again
at the right moment. It just be
came nonsense, pretension."
Take note, Rush fans.. .
For Robert Fripp, King
Crimson is a reaffirmation of

self, in a way. "This is the first
tour I've over done where sex
isn't the main advantage. I've
gone in .is a human being and I
hope to stay one." Indeed,
family man Fripp's only use of
the center mike at the Waldorf
during the shows was in a brief,
wittv recognition of his sister's
presence in the audience, like

ning the magnitude of the
event to "the assassination of
all world leaders over after
noon tea." Funny man, that
Fripp.
At the same time, though,
King Crimson is always acutely
aware of its collective actions.
That awareness makes the
Crimmers distinctly, excitingly,
progressively different — even
in their attitudes about per
forming. Robert Fripp con
fided, "The good thing about
being onstage is that you can
be an icon. The bad thing is you
c an be a rock star. This stuff I've
been prattling for four years —
I mean I believe it, but if it all
comes from my 'rock star ego'
it's soiled. People in public
places are not to be trusted.
Who would trust a politician
nowadays? My father perhaps.
Father is 71, though, and he
hasn't been to many rock
shows lately."
