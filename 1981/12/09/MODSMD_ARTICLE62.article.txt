# 'Garden of Delights' good, but not delightful

### Julie Beehner 
L.ist Thursday evening at the Nitery, four people
walked out of a play called Garden of Delights. Rather
than reflecting on the quality of the performance
(which was superb) I found their exit a demonstration
of the disturbing intensity of the play. Inspired by a
Hieronymous Bosch painting of the same title,
Fernando Arrabal's Garden of Delights embodies in
words and actions what Bosch's painting captured in
oil. Both are detailed, confused and confusing, and
both deal with the futile circularity of life and the in
evitability of death and degradation in this world.
The play was technically rough around the edges,
lighting and sound sometimes not quite coinciding
with action, but the performances of the four main
characters gave Garden a central strength which
more than made up for the technical deficiencies.
Lais, the star of the show in whose mind the play takes
place, was portrayed by Drue Bralove in an insanely
electric performance. Lais isonstage most of the time,
the action is brutally physical, and the energy level of
her part cannot fail without the play collapsing. Lais's
confusion and uncertainty, her inability to come to
terms with her past, with God, and with her soul, are
laid bare by Bralove almost from the moment she ap
pears.
A crucial part of Lais's confusion stems from her ex
periences as a young girl in a strict Catholic or
phanage. Her relationship with Miharca (Nicole
Goedhart), a fellow orphan, was tinged with
homosexual innuendoes which Lais was, as an adoles
cent, unaware of. Miharca is a mass of contradictory

impulses and desires, and Nicole Goedhart gives an
energetic performance. During a forbidden venture
outside the orphanage walls, Lais meets Teloc, a
strange and compelling man. Tom Dobrocky plays
Teloc as a sullen, egotistical, neurotic yet fascinating
wanderer. Teloc tells Lais she will be an actress, and
professes to show her the future and the past, life and
death. He gives her an empty jam jar to put her soul in.
Lais projects great, almost mystical, qualities onto Tel
ec, qualities he does not, in fact, possess.
The form of Garden is, I think, a series of flashbacks
and associations in Lais's mind. Living a life of seclu
sion as a theater star, secure with her pet sheep and
Zenon, a pseudo-ape character (Michael Ramsey-
Perez) she keeps in a cage, Lais is plagued by her
thoughtsand memories. Zenon comes across as a very
real, strictly emotional character — he loves Lais and
wants her to love him more than she loves her sheep.
Lais constantly threatens to put Zenon back in his
cage because he acts like an animal.
Symbolism is a major part of Garden of Delights.
The religious references (Inquisition, circumcision,
etc.) were generally pointed and fairly easy to recog
nize. The sheep, and Lais as the Good Shepherd, were
similarly obvious. But some of the scenes with Zenon,
the man-ape, were difficult to comprehend. I, for
one, was never quite sure what Zenon was. Perhaps
he was a real character, or perhaps he represented
Lais's repressed urges, especially towards Teloc. Two
scenes involve Zenon bringing out a large, hollow
egg, and Lais and Zenon going inside the egg togeth
er. Another scene between Lais and Zenon is a staged

wedding, with Zenon assuming the traditionally sub
missive role of the bride, and Lais the dominant role
of the groom. The wedding ceremony is never com
pleted, the phone rings and reality prevents Lais and
Zenon from achieving unity. The phone call, one in a
series of calls, helps to fragment the action, to cut it
into workable pieces.
A recurring religiojs theme in Garden isoneof sac
rifice. The idea that one must make a sacrifice, human
or otherwise, to enter the Garden of Delights, per
meates the entire play. There are several semi-sacri
ficial scenes: Lais and Miharca as teenagers play a
game of sacrifice, Lais envisions herself being judged
in an Inquisitional scene and ultimately sacrificed for
her sins, Zenon slaughters Lais' sheep, and Lais and
Teloc kill Miharca, sacrificing her that they may enter
their own Garden of Delights.
Despite the serious tone of Garden, there are some
wonderful tension-relieving lines. After an un
believably sexual scene between a young Lais and
Teloc, Lais asks what Teloc did to her thighs. Teloc re
plies exhaustedly, "I wrote on you." Miharca and Lais
intone the prayers of the refrigerator and the
thermostat, and often in her most emotional mo
ments, Lais is at her humorous best. She vows to make
"a cauldron of boiling shit" and to throw in everyone
who ever hurt her. When she talks to her sheep, she
offers to do anything for them — buy them each a tel
evision set, or sunglasses and a tan boyfriend. One of
the most comic scenes involves an electroencephalo
graph. Lais hauls out the machine and enlists Zenon's
aid in interpreting the readouts, hoping to find out

what her mind is like. The pattern of her brain waves
remains relentlessly the same, no matter who she
thinks of. Lais is infuriated by the failure of modern
technology to alleviate her confusion. The telephone
conversations add a comic dimension — the inane
questions of the television emcee's guests and later
the boring monotony of the police detective contrast
vividly with Lais'often flowery, sometimes cutting, re
sponses.
Garden of Delights ends with Zenon and Lais enter
ing the egg, and Lais giving Zenon her soul (in the jam
jar) to taste. As Zenon reaches into her soul, their
roles are reversed. Lais becomes the stuttering, unin
telligible subhuman, and Zenon assumes the role of a
literate, thinking person. After two hours of constant
changing of who is in control, the play returns to
where it began except for the reversal between Lais
and Zenon. The play closes with Zenon singing the
song Lais sang as the lights went on, "Such is life,
seeming so delectable. .
Garden of Delights has everything it takes to be
popular in America: sex, perversion, humor, sarcasm,
and bitterness. Ther underlying implications of the
play are hundredfold, and I undoubtedly missed most
of them. But the effect of the play is certainly lasting,
and not an altogether comfortable one. The per
formance was incredibly draining, so that in
termission seemed more like half-time. Perhaps it is
just as well that the Nietery holds only 70 people and
that only a limited number were fortunate enough to
see Garden of Delights. It would be too unsettling to
have anv more confused people on campus.
