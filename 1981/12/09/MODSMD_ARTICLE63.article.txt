# 'Reds': an understated epic, an inspired love story
## 
### 
Warren Beatty is all over
R( m/s. Hp produced and
directed it, worked on the
script with the gifted British
playwright Trevor Griffiths
(who wrote the stage play Co
medians), and plays the role of
Jack Reed, the American cor
respondent whom Pancho Vil
la and Lenin befriended, who
wrote Ten Days That Shook the
World about the November
1917 Revolution in Russia, and
who captained the protesters
who split from the American
Communist Party in 1919 to
form the Communist Labor
Party, smuggling himself into
Russian to gain recognition
from the Comintern for this
new organization. (He died
there of typhus in 1920.) Reds is
chiefly the story of Reed's rela
tionship with Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), the writer who
became his lover and then his
wife and worked alongside him
in Russia; it cost more than $30

million to make and it runs
for three and a half hours plus
intermission. It was an ex
traordinarily ambitious under
taking fora director on his sec
ond time out (he and Buck
Henrv collaborated on the
comedy Heaven Can Wait
three years ago), and even if he
had botched it in some impor
tant way, we would have to re
spect a filmmaker of such ad
venturous mettle, seizing on a
fascinating but not necessarily
commercial property — a love
story about two Communists?
— and lavishing all his re
sources on it. But Reds needs
no apology. It is an intelligent,
unconventional, craftsmanlike
movie, remarkably coherent
and remarkably sustained.
Beatty must have watched
those ponderous historical
epics of the '60s and early '70s
— the white elephants of the
film industry that nearly ef
fected its collapse, like Tora!
Tora! Tora! and Nicholas and
Alexandra — with distaste, as
most of us did, and worked out
a strategy that would steer Reds
away from all the traps they
tumbled into. We can see how
all the money was spent, but
Beatty doesn't choke us with it.

He keeps the narrative line
clear — we never have to ask
where we are or why the char
acters are behaving in this way
— but he asks us to assimilate a
great deal of information and
trusts to our ability to do so
rather than underscoring
themes and reducing historical
personages to emblems. His
photographer, Vittorio
Storaro, shows similar restraint
bv working in such an un
forced style that we hardly no
tice how carefully the New
York scenes are shot —
claustrophobically, with slight
ly pasty-faced men and women
in rooms that distort the natu
ral light or cut it off completely
— until we move to bright,
spacious Provincetown.
Storaro refuses to dazzle us un
til we arrive in Russia at the end
of Part One, and the composer,
Stephen Sondheim, refuses to
fill the soundtrack with rousing
marches (until Part Two, when

the revolutionary songs take
over). If there is such an animal
as an understated epic, Reds is
it.
Beattv's framing device for
the story is a collection of anec
dotes and judgements de
livered in close-up by a series
of "witnesses," among them
Arthur Mayer, Henry Miller,
Rebecca West, Will Durant,
George Jessel, and Adela Rog
ers St. John. They never identi
fy themselves — and indeed,
most of these contemporaries
were not closely connected to
the world Reed and Bryant
lived in, so presumably they are
simply standing in for the usual
friends and associates in
terviewed in documentaries
about famous people from a
bvgone era. Much of what they
say is irrelevant or at least per
ipheral to the story, and they
contradict each other; this
seems to be Beatty's of es
tablishing the impossibility of
weighing the contributions of
the two central figures, of ever
knowing what they were really
like. Some of the bits are
charming and quite moving,
but the whole idea strikes me
as disingenuous: after all, the
movie they introduce (and

continue to intrude upon) has
its own, very strong point of
view to present, and surely we
are meant to be convinced by
it. I'm not sure why Beatty and
Griffiths chose to undercut it.
In the Greenwich Village and
Provincetown scenes, we
glimpse the group of friends to
whom lack Reed introduces
Louise, lack's social circle in
cluded most of the most in
teresting New Yorkers of the
1910s, and Beatty has wisely
chosen to cast actors with dis
tinctive personalities in the
roles — lack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill, Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman,
Edward Herrmann as Max East
man, Max Wright as Floyd Dell,
Dolph Sweet as labor leader
Big Bill Hayward, and Gene
Hackman (in a nice bit) and
George Plimpton as editors. Ex
cept for Goldman, who reap
pears in Part Two (Stapleton
gives a first-rate performance,
letting us see this fabled revo
lutionary's warmth and
dogmatic obstinacy as well as
her fierce intelligence), and
O'Neill, who has an affair with
Louise, these characters are
seen fleetingly — Beatty uses
them to establish Reed's
milieu. As far as it goes, this ap
proach works, but we can't
help feeling deprived of the
opportunity to know these
fascinating people better; it
seems a shame that Max Wright
has onlv two or three lines and
Edward Herrmann ten or
twelve.
In fact, the first part could
stand restructuring. Most of it
is given over to the burgeoning
relationship between Jack and
Louise, which moves in fits and
starts. Their arguments begin
to repeat, although the writing
is often sharp. Griffiths and
Beatty haven't shaped the roles
in such a way that the two stars
can really take off with them;
they both seem a little im
mature, not fully formed, and
so Beatty and Keaton fill them
out with their personalities.
Keaton suffers more than Beat
tv in these scenes because Lou
ise behaves impulsively, throw
ing up obstacles between
herself and Jack while still en
couraging his interest in her..
Her motives are sometimes as
unclear as those of Sybylla in
Mv Brilliant Career, who
horsewhipped the man she
loved. Her romance with
O'Neill is also unexplained —
at least from her point of view.
It is clear enough from his:
Nicholson shows us his attrac
tion to Louise, and his cynical
perceptions of her conduct
help us to put her in per
spective, even if we finally de
cide that he is too harsh on her.
This is Nicholson's best work in
years; his readings of those ter

rific putdowns really crackle.
(O'Neill based the love triangle
in Bevond the Horizon, his first
major full-length play, on his
involvement with Louise and
Jack, and derived the character
of Nina in Strange Interlude
largely from Louise.)
In Part Two, however, we can
see why Beatty and Griffiths in
sisted on drawing the charac
ters of Reed and Bryant as they
did in the American se
quences. Russia jerks them into
adulthood, and they turn out
to be fascinating people whose
interaction truly holds the
screen. Needless to say, this de
velopment does wonders for
Beatty and Keaton's acting,
which may never have been
better than it is in the last nine
ty minutes. Keaton begins Part
Two with a riveting speech
about Bolshevism at a senate
hearing on conspiracy that es
tablishes her credibility as a
woman and a reporter in our
eyes. The little girl who, in
Reed's words, was taken seri
ously by no one in New York
because she didn't take herself
seriously, has pulled herself up
to the forefront of political ex
perience and it has energized
her thinking. It has sensitized
her, too; it is she who is the first
to see that party politics have
obsessed Jack and blinded him
to the impracticality of much of
what he is immersed in. (Even
the normally clear-eyed Emma
Goldman doesn't become alert
to this until she encounters
Reed in Russia upon his re
turn.) We can believe that the
woman Louise has turned into
could have the stamina and
dedication to set out on a
search for her husband, who

has been imprisoned in Finland
and then sent back to Moscow,
and find him. (In the scene in
which Louise hunts through a
crowd of detraining Bolsheviks
for Jack, we see her anxiety
turn into terror and then into
grinning relief and joy. These
may be the finest two minutes
of Diane Keaton's career thus
far.)
Jack Reed is an ideal role for
Warren Beatty. Reed's Ten
Days That Shook the World is
so breathlessly vivid even six
decades after the events it de
scribes transpired that it gives
the illusion of having been en
tirely written in one incredible
day. Reading about its author
in Barbara Gelb's So Short a
Time ("Like all genuine mar
tyrs," she writes, "Reed was
unaware of self sacrifice. He
courted danger and hardship
out of idealistic conviction" —
and later she refers to "his
youthful tendency to see
himself as a romantic hero and
to become a participant in the
drama he was covering"), one
thinks of the best of Beatty's
performances: Clyde Barrow,
McCabe, George in Shampoo
— dreamers and romantics all.
In Part One of Reds Beatty
seems to be relying too much
on his identification with the
character; in Part Two, when
Jack diplays some unpleasant
traits and the role acquires
some tension, his performance
deepens. Beatty allows us to
agonize over Jack's mistakes
without ever losing respect for
this totally committed individ
ual whose "true genius. . .was
in the way he lived his life," as
Edwin Justus Mayer described
him. When Jack and Louise

struggle in Part Two, we can see
them growing out of the pain
of that struggle. Reds is one of
the few inspiring love stories in
movies.

The cult members in Ticket
to Heaven are smilingly sexless
and relentlessly sunny, like
cheerleader robots. When they
set to work on an initiate — es
pecially an unwilling one, like
David (Nick Mancuso) — they
break him down by employing,
simultaneously, physical pres
sure (lack of sleep, lack of pro
tein) and mental tricks that are
horrifyingly simple. He is led to
participate in sub-juvenile
summer camp games and
"songs, entertained by crackpot
nonsense lectures with an in
sidious and not quite coherent
religious subtext, and never
left alone fora minute. The
kids' games operate, on a more
intense level, much as com
mercials do: they are so far
below David's mental faculties
that thev appear harmless
enough, and thus they disarm
him totally. Informal "getting
to know you" raps slip into a
kind of group therapy, and the
atmosphere of confidence and
confession lulls him intoexpos
ing his own anxieties. Before
he can figure out what is being
done to him, he has become a
crew-cutted disciple of an
Asian "lather" whose photo
graph he genuflects to, and he
is grubbing money for this idol
by selling flowers in the sub
urbs of San Francisco.
The organization in Ticket to
Heaven is called The Young
Pioneer Community Center (its
members refer to themselves
as "heavenly children" or "the

family")/ but we know who
they're meant to represent, of
course. (The audience howls at
the traditional disclaimer at the
end of the picture.) In the era
not only of the Moonies but
also of lonestown and the
horn-again Christians, it seems
odd that no filmmaker before
the Canadian Ralph L. Thomas
has been drawn to such ex
plosive subject matter — unless
we count Philip Kaufman, who
treated it satirically in Invasion
of the Body Snatchers. (There
have been a couple of TV mov
ies about it; one, Blinded by
the Light, starred Kristy
McNichol.) Thomas isn't ter
ribly imaginative, and he and
his co-screenwriter Anne Cam
eron share a sentimental streak
that softens the picture in
spots, but they're good enough
to serve this fantastic story
(taken from Josh Freed's
Moon webs) about the
brainwashing and de-pro
gramming of David. Ticket to
Heaven is a very scary movie.
David's entrapment in the
cult at the hands of an
astonishingly shrewd group
leader, Ruthie (well played by
Kim Cattrall, who makes her
seem so normal that she is the
most truly frightening — be
cause the most unfathomable
— of all the members) takes up
most of the first half of the film;
in the second half, his best
friend Larry (Saul Rubinek) flies
over from Toronto to in
vestigate the mystery of David's
disappearance. Larry is an ac
countant who performs stand
up comedy as a hobby; when
he enters the"camp," he man
ages to resist Ruthie by turning
this new environment into a
target for his jokes. Rubinek
makes us understand how
laughter really can act as a tow
line to sanity. In the movie's
best scene, he does his routine
for the others — and the only
person who finds him funny is
also a ringer, who is looking for
his sister and helps Larry to es
cape and kidnap David in order
to deprogram him.
Thomas and Cameron de
scribe the deprogramming
procedure with much less clari
ty than we might hope for, and
they make other major mis-,
calculations, too. The pietuie
opens with an aggressive se
quence in which David and
two other cult members (one is
Robert Joy, in his third portrait
of an on-the-edge personality
this year — I hope he's not in
danger of becoming the new
Anthony Perkins) chant
slogans and pound the walls of
a van as they ride through the
city; then we flash back to
David's life in Toronto before
his conversion. Nothing is
gained in structuring the be
ginning of the film in this way
