# 'Bandits'an unsettling fantasy
## 
### Jim Mattson 
No matter what the ads may
indicate, Time Bandits stars six
dwarfs and an 11-year-old kid
named Kevin. At a time when
movie screens are filled with
the macho fantasies of the Indi
ana loneses and Supermans
and James Bonds, it's refresh
ing to see a movie with a view
point firmly centered around
four-foot one.
Time Bandits is a fantasy
made hy Monty Pythons Terry
Gilliam (who directed) and
Michael Palin (who, with
Gilliam, wrote the screenplay).
They've constructed a movie
that deftly sandwiches heroism
and satire — just when you
think you've got things figured
out, they've put in a joke that
undercuts the heroics or a neat
idea that fractures the jokes.
Instead of setting up a strug

gle between the good guys and
the had guys, the filmmakers
have gone one step further: at
the core of Time Bandits is the
fight of good to remain good in
the presence of evil. As one
might expect from the people
who popularized "I'm a Lum
berjack and I'm OK" in every
high school in America, if good
is to triumph, it will only he by
telling better jokes than evil.
The bandits of the title are six
minor employees of the Su
preme Being (they're in charge
of shrubs and bushy under
growth) who decide to plunder
the world's greatest treasures.
The movie is constructed re
vue-style around their adven
tures, starting when they ac
cidentally add the kid to their
group (when they fall through
a time-hole into his closet) and
ending with their involvement

in a confrontation between the
Supreme Being and the Evil
Genius.
The sketches vary in quality,
and, at the beginning especial
ly, tend to suffer from being
stretched thinner than the ma
terial will allow. (The episode
where they rob Napoleon, for
example, is a blackout sketch
allowed to fade away in
terminably.)
But when the movie is good
it's very good, and it's very
good much of the time. We see
things through the eyes of
Kevin, played wonderfully by
Craig Warnock. Like Lewis Car
roll's Alice, he's an ordinary
child in an extraordinary situ
ation, and it's his common
sense that keeps the narrative
going smoothly.
Palin and Gilliam have made
Kevin the most reasonable

character in the movie. He's an
astute judge of deed and char
acter. (The dwarves quickly
learn to turn to him for sound
advice.) He makes the episodes
real for us: we believe what's
happening because he be
lieves it.
The boy's soberness is coun
terpointed by the utter
boorishness of most of the
adults in the movie. His pa
rents, whom we see briefly at
the l beginning and the end of
the movie, are more fearsome
than all the other terrible
beings Kevin encounters (it'sas
if he was stolen by two wicked
stepmothers when he was a
baby).
Other grownups, even fa
mous ones, turn out to be
fakes, too. John Cleese's Robin
Hood is the height of stuffy re
spectability. He takes away the

bandits' hard-won booty, and
they can do nothing — there's
no stronger defense than
glacial courtesy.
Kevin is surrounded by ogres
of all shapes and sizes; they get
increasingly grotesque as the
movie progresses. The Evil
Genius (who covets the map
the dwarfs have filched from
the Supreme Being) is part dev
il and part electrical engineer:
he wants nothing less than to
discover the secret of the semi
conductor chip. He's a game
show Satan who seduces the
unwary by blurring the con
nection between merit and re
ward.
Late in the movie, the Su
preme Being makes an ap
pearance (as played by thes
pian knight Ralph Richardson).
This god is a sort of cosmic tax
accountant — he keeps the
books balanced and audits
those whose spending seems
excessive. Kevin asks him the
question that everyone would
like to ask: how can an om
nipotent god tolerate the pres

once of evil in the universe?
Richardson ponders a mo
ment, and then hypothesizes
that it might have something to
do with free will.
It's an explanation that might
satisfy a tax accountant — it
(/oes add up — but it doesn't
work very well in practice, es
pecially when the one who
might exercise this "free will"
is a child. None of the charac
ters in Time Bandits reallyseem
to be making any choices at all
— things happen arbitrarily.
Kevin's parents impose rules
on him about bedtimes and
noise levels and eating habits,
and when he leaves them it is
only because he is yanked
against his will into a maze con
necting past and present.
The only positively-depicted
adult in the movie is King
Agamemnon (played by Sean
Connery, who somehow man
ages to give a memorable per
formance in about three
minutes of screen time), whom
Kevin quite literally falls upon
and whom he quite accidental

ly saves. The reward Kevin re
ceives is to be treated as a hu
man being for perhaps the first
time in his life.
The dwarfs steal him away,
once again against his will. But
Connery reappears at the mov
ie's very end as a fireman who
has put out a strange fire in
Kevin's house. He doesn't offer
any comfort to Kevin — rather,
he seems to throw the boy
even more deeply into chaos.
What he does offer seems to be
a chance for Kevin finally toex
ercise some choice about the
direction his life will take.
Gilliam ends the movie up in
theair: nothing is sealed; noth
ing is certain. This is a choice
which will probably cost the
movie $10 million at the box of
fice — audiences like to be told
what to think. What the direc
tor has accomplished is quite
striking, and virtually un
precedented in this kindof en
tertainment. He's made an "es
capist" movie that doesn't al
low us to come out of the thea
ter pacified and unaffected.
