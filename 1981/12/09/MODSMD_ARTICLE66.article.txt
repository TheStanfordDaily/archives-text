# Pryor gets serious
## 
### Steve Kessler Trey Ellis 
Some people think Richard Pryor is very
funny because he uses a lot of profanity.
Some people think Richard Pryor stinks be
cause he uses a lot of profanity. After watch
ing him for an hour at the Circle Star Theatre
last week, you get the feeling that Mr. Pryor
would tell both groups to fuck off.
See, Richard Pryor has developed a social
conscience. If the word "motherfucker" still
gets a laugh that's okay, but it is no longer the
cornerstone of his act. He now talks about the
destructiveness of the word "nigger," the
persecution of the Jews, and his emotional
trip to Africa. When you get past the myriad
of fucks, sucks, honkies, and pussies that in
fest Mr. Prvor's vocabulary, you find out that
the man has something important to say.
"I am a burned man!," Richard Pryor

shouts to the applause and laughter of all. "I
have burnt up!" AnHthen he segues intocall
ing his secretary a white honky bitch. Howls
of laughter, shouts of approval. He calls his
eight lawyers motherfucking Jewish crooks.
Pryor starts to get serious, and people start
to heckle. "No, this'll be funny in the end, but
you gotta think about it,"he fells them. "I
won't use the word 'nigger' anymore cause I
was in Africa three weeks and didn't see one
nigger." A few shouts of "Right on."
"Africa is where all life began. A white an
thropologist said that," he says."I throw in
the shit about the anthropologist, so the
white people say, 'Well, heck, maybe he's
telling the truth.'"
At his best, Richard Prvor not only asks for
laughter, but demands that you think about
why you laugh at any joke, phrase, or word.
