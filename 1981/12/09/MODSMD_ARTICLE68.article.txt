# John Klemmer is truly sui generis

John Klemmer
Old Waldorf/San Francisco
4 December 1981
John Klemmer is John Klem
mer. Sounds simple, but there
are no other appropriate words
to describe this superior tenor
saxophonist.
To say his performance last
Friday night at the Old Waldorf
was special would be an under
statement. To call Klemmer
sensational wouldn't quite tell
it all either. Perhaps the only
word that comes close to char
acterizing Klemmer and his
show is "professional."
Klemmer played in as un
pretentious a manner as pos
sible. No hype, no facial ex
pressions pretending that he
was performing a difficult solo.
However, he almost went too
far in his conscious intention to
downplay ostentatious behav
ior.
Klemmer's only words all
evening were the names of his
band members and the instru
ments they played. That was it.
The sole pitfall of this in
novative approach was that it
created a rather impersonal ef
fect, a sort of "I'm John Klem
mer and you're not" non-ver
bal statement.
Nevertheless, Klemmer
played like the pro he is, dem
onstrating his rich, lucid tone
duplicated by no one. His ex
tensive use of an Echoplex, a
device which echoeseach note
two or three times, only con
tributed to his complete
brilliance. He even sounded
good through the Waldorf's
atrocious sound system, proba
bly the best compliment of all.
Backing him up was a quartet
of musicians that did a better

than adequate job. Milcho
Leviev (keyboards), Bob
Magnusson (acoustic bass),
Roy McCarthy (drums), and Al
Fontano (percussion) round
out the John Klemmer group.
Klemmer et al., however,
desperately needed the ser
vices of a guitarist, as all but
one of the solos featured either
Klemmer or Leviev. A few
guitar solos would have made
the concert much more bal
anced and at the same time
taken some of the burden off
Leviev's shoulders. Without as
many solos, Leviev, whose
solos never came close to rival
ing Klemmer's, could have
taken better advantage of his
limited talent by being more
original.
Opening for Klemmer was
just what they needed. Solo
electric guitarist Steve
Urchiaga was the most talented
opening act I have ever seen at
the Old Waldorf, though that
isn't saving much. He was able
to mix low and high notes to
make his guitar sound as if an
electric bass was accompany
ing him.
The only solo by someone
other than Klemmer or Leviev
was Fontano's percussion solo
and his interplay with Mc-
Carthy. He mostly concen
trated on the bongos and the
congas, playing them faster
than the speed of light.
Throughout the rest of the per
formance, he was always
playing some sort of instru
ment, since percussion is a ma
jor element in Klemmer's mu-i
sic, which quite often contains]
a Latin beat.
But the best solos of the eve
ning came from Klemmer's
saxophone. To begin the show,
he soloed without the as
sistance of his band. It took just

two quick snaps of his fingers
to get the band started with a
song from his Magnificent
Madness LP, called "I Can't
Help It."
Then he played another
bandless solo, this time with
the Echoplex, and led into a
not-too-impressive Leviev key
board solo. Leviev's best solo
all evening was on a concert
grand piano during the group's
fifth song. But for some un
known reason, Leviev did not
again grace the concert grand
with the presence of his dex
terous fingers.
The major problem in the ar
rangement of the show,
though, was that Klemmer
chose not to play any upbeat
tunes, something essential in
any concert besides classical
music. Many of the songs
started slow and then
progressed intoa whirlof tenor
sax notes from Klemmer. But
they did not satiate the au
dience's obvious desire fora
tune like "Brazilia."
I think Carly Simon wrote
her hit song, "Nobody Does it
Better," with John Klemmer in
mind.
