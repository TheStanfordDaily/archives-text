Most of you readers now
glanc ing at this little review are
probably doing so mainly out
of curiosity. "The Ventures,"
you say, "are they a new wave
band?" Well no, not really. Pic
ture, if you will, four musicians
walking onstage, two guitars,
one bass and one drummer,
but lo and behold, three of
them look like friends of your
grandparents. The fourth
member, a youngster on
rhythm guitar, is obviously a
newer addition to the group,
because The Ventures are not
New Wave, but Old Wave,
older even than the British
Wave. Put simply, The Ven
tures recorded their first hit in
1%0, and went on to become
the greatest instrumental
group in history.
How many of us wouldn't
recognize the theme song
from Hawaii Five-O? Or the
theme from Outer limits?
I low about "Wipe Out," with a
drum solo that lives on as an in
spiration to drummers of all
ages and musical persuasions.
These are just a few of the
songs that make The Ventures
recognizable by virtually ev
eryone, even those of us who
didn't yet have fully developed
musical tastes in 1960. In fact,
almost every song played at the
Keystone on Thursday night
was instantlv recognized by the
audience, not by name, since

there are no Ivrics, out oy
sound.
The Ventures may be old,
but they certainly haven't lost
their touch. The members of
the band are not performers;
thev don't dance and strut
around on the stage, and there
is no vocalist making faces and
gesturing .it the audience. They
don't have to perform, because
thev are musicians, damn good
ones, and t hey let the music do
the talking. Thev have their
own distinctive sound and a
vast supply of songs, so they
simply get up and play, and let
the audience enjoy. And, al
though thi* lines of age are ap
parent on their faces, the hands
of these musicians don't seem
to have slowed at all over the
years.
There is something verv in
triguing and infectious about
"the sound" of The Ventures.
This distinctiveness seems to
come mainly from the lead
guitar, played bv Nokie Ed
wards. Edwards, a big Indian
wearing a large black cowboy
hat, stood virtually motionless
on the stage, and let his fingers
do the talking, playing leads
faster and more skillfully than
any young punker could ever
hope to do. The chord
progressions and leads which
he plaved had a certain haunt
ing and verv appealing sound,
and carried the songs very well
in the absence of vocals.
For those who think that an
instrumental group must be
boring, let it just be said that a
large portion of the audience
were on their feet the whole

time, and interestingly
enough, many of these were
young New Wavers, who prob
ably weren't even born when
The Ventures began recording.
It is true than instrumentals
have the potential of becoming
vorv repetitive. Fortunately,
the band seemed very aware of
this danger, and managed to
put interesting variations in the
songs, as well as keeping them
fairly short, thus succeeding in
keeping things moving very
well.
As good as The Ventures may
be, they are still a band of the
past; nothing can push back
time, even for rock stars. They

have made an immense con
tribution to the development
of good, basic rock and roll,
but there is a sense that this
band is playing out the final
ciays of its career. However,
there is hope that what The
Ventures have to offer won't
be lost forever. The New Wave
movement seems to be draw
ing more and more on music
from tho past, and starting over
at a very basic level. The fact
that a band from 20 years ago is
still playing, bringing music of
the past into the present, is
bound to have a positive effect
on the development of new
music.

The Ventures
Keystone Palo Mto
1 Pec ember 1981
Most of you readers now
glanc ing at this little review are
probably doing so mainly out
of curiosity. "The Ventures,"
you say, "are they a new wave
band?" Well no, not really. Pic
ture, if you will, four musicians
walking onstage, two guitars,
one bass and one drummer,
but lo and behold, three of
them look like friends of your
grandparents. The fourth
member, a youngster on
rhythm guitar, is obviously a
newer addition to the group,
because The Ventures are not
New Wave, but Old Wave,
older even than the British
Wave. Put simply, The Ven
tures recorded their first hit in
1%0, and went on to become
the greatest instrumental
group in history.
How many of us wouldn't
recognize the theme song
from Hawaii Five-O? Or the
theme from Outer limits?
I low about "Wipe Out," with a
drum solo that lives on as an in
spiration to drummers of all
ages and musical persuasions.
These are just a few of the
songs that make The Ventures
recognizable by virtually ev
eryone, even those of us who
didn't yet have fully developed
musical tastes in 1960. In fact,
almost every song played at the
Keystone on Thursday night
was instantlv recognized by the
audience, not by name, since

there are no Ivrics, out oy
sound.
The Ventures may be old,
but they certainly haven't lost
their touch. The members of
the band are not performers;
thev don't dance and strut
around on the stage, and there
is no vocalist making faces and
gesturing .it the audience. They
don't have to perform, because
thev are musicians, damn good
ones, and t hey let the music do
the talking. Thev have their
own distinctive sound and a
vast supply of songs, so they
simply get up and play, and let
the audience enjoy. And, al
though thi* lines of age are ap
parent on their faces, the hands
of these musicians don't seem
to have slowed at all over the
years.
There is something verv in
triguing and infectious about
"the sound" of The Ventures.
This distinctiveness seems to
come mainly from the lead
guitar, played bv Nokie Ed
wards. Edwards, a big Indian
wearing a large black cowboy
hat, stood virtually motionless
on the stage, and let his fingers
do the talking, playing leads
faster and more skillfully than
any young punker could ever
hope to do. The chord
progressions and leads which
he plaved had a certain haunt
ing and verv appealing sound,
and carried the songs very well
in the absence of vocals.
For those who think that an
instrumental group must be
boring, let it just be said that a
large portion of the audience
were on their feet the whole

time, and interestingly
enough, many of these were
young New Wavers, who prob
ably weren't even born when
The Ventures began recording.
It is true than instrumentals
