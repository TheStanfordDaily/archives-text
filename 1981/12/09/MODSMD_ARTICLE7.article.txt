# Oak Creek's condo conversion stalled
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
Conflicting interpretations of a complicated
agreement concluded last August between the
University and Palo Alto realtor Scott Carey have
forced a halt in negotiations over the conversion of
the Oak Creek apartments to condominiums.
According to both Carey and Frank Morrow, the
University's director of housing, no negotiations
have taken place since the Board of Trustees re
jected what they called a "request" from Carey for
changes in the terms for extending the ground
lease for the apartments Oct. 13.
Carey said reports that he made such a request
are "absolutely untrue." He said there were some
conflicts when he and the University examined a
checklist late last summer, but that he first heard
about his"request" through a letter sent to him by
Morrow in mid-October.
Carey, former mayor of Palo Alto, represents
Oak Creek Associates, a firm which wants to turn
the 759-unit apartment complex, located on Uni
versity land along Willow Road, into con
dominiums. The University tentatively agreed this
fall to extend its ground lease on the property fora
period of 65 to 99 years to make the conversion
practical. The present ground lease will expire in
37 years.
Eighty-three percent of Oak Creek residents
agreed early this year to the conversion to allow
approval by Palo Alto city officials, according to
Robin Hamill, directorof housing programs forthe
University.
Under the terms of the agreement signed last
summer, the University would purchase up to 200

units for an estimated $19 million. That price re
flects considerations given to the University for ex
tending the ground lease. Carey was to provide fi
nancing for up to 100 units at a mortgage rate of 11
percent. The University would also retain rights to
negotiate for the remaining 559 units.
Tenants who opted to buy condominiums
would be offered 30-year mortgages with a 20 per
cent down payment and an 11.75 interest rate. The
Palo Alto Weekly quoted Carey as saying this fall
that, "without that kind of mortgage, there won't
be any conversion." That rate was three points
below market rate at that time. Since then, interest
rates have risen substantially.
Carey also offered tenants lifetime leases with
rent increases limited to 80 percent of increases in
the Consumer Price Index.
According to Morrow, differences in interpreta
tion between the board and Carey exist on three
main issues, but that the most important one is
long-term financing. The University interprets the
agreement as saying that the mortgages offered to
the University and tenants would be fully as
sumable over their 30-year duration. Morrow said
Carey is prepared to offer only first-mortgage fi
nancing. If that was the case, Carey probably only
would have to finance the low interest rates for five
or six years, which is the average turnover rate at
the Oak Creek Apartments.
Carey declined to identify which issues were in
question saying, "I don't want to debate the situ
ation in the press."
Morrow said other issues in question include
that of the duration of the ground lease extension

on the Oak Creek property and the question of
providing a master leasee for the complex after
conversion.
The University expects Oak Creek Associates to
be the master leasee and overlook the complex for
five years after the conversion. Morrow said Carey
says he doesn't want to — or can't — provide this
service.
Oak Creek resident Lou Fein, a vocal opponent
of the conversion, said it would be illegal for Carey
to function as the master leasee. Fein also warned
of other legal obstacles to the conversion, especial
ly in the way that tenants' approval was obtained
last year. He said that at that time Carey's deal with
Stanford was still unclear, and that the terms of the
lifetime lease have since been altered.
Fein also said that while tenants signed the
agreement only after being given a specific price at
which they could purchase their units after con
version, that price will expire Dec. 31. If an agree
ment is concluded after that time, Carey would be
able to charge tenants a price higher than the one
to which they agreed.
Fein foresees legal challenges if Carey and the
University ever conclude their conversion agree
ment.
He also warned that even with the low interest
rates, very few residents will be able to afford their
units or to even qualify for one of the loans, if the
conversion goes through. Fein said conversion
would create a "menagerie" within the complex
because tenants, most of whom would be taking
advantage of the lifetime leases at below-market

BUT CAN YOU BUY THEM? — The arrangement to convert the Oak
Creek apartments into condominiums so that the University can use
them for faculty/staff housing is being questioned. The issue may
not be resolved for years.
interest rates, would feel pressure
from the absentee owners to move
out of the complex. This pressure
would come from Carey and As
sociates, for whom the cash would be
negative as long as they continued to
live there and pay the low rent, and
from the University, which would
want them to move out so it could
buy the unit and rent it out to Stan
ford faculty and staff, he said.
Oak Creek administrator Diana
Bos downplayed opposition to the
conversion within the complex. She
said there was initial opposition but,
"After residents had time to digest
the material, all of that pretty much
dissipated."
Oak Creek is still functioning as a
rental apartment complex, Bos said,
but prospective renters are informed
of the potential of the conversion.
According to Morrow, "The ball is
now in Carey's court." He said the
Board of Trustees is "adamant" about
its interpretations of the agreement,
and will not consider the matter un
less Carey agrees with those in
terpretations. He is receiving no

pressure from University officials to
conclude the agreement, he said,
even with the current adminis
tration's desire to obtain more low
cost housing for faculty and staff. The
University does not expect to gain
"more than 20 units a year" for the
short-term because of the lifetime
lease offered to tenants, he ex
plained.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to
President Donald Kennedy, declined
to comment on the administration's
concerns about the current stall in
negotiations.
Carey said he sees little hope fora
resolution of the disagreement. He
said he has requested meetings with
the board numerous times, but has
been informed there will be no
further discussion on the issue unless
Oak Creek Associates agrees to the
board's interpretations.
Morrow would not comment on
the chance that the deal would go
through. He reiterated the board's
announcement that discussions
would proceed until February 1983 if
Carey continues to pursue the mat
ter.
