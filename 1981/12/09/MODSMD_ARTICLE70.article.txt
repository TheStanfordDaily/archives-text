						critic finds the only way to make it through a Devo concert

### Kris Roginski 
Devo
San Francisco Civic Auditorium
December 1981
The first tangible effect of the drug manifested itself at
the souvenir stand immediately inside the doorway. My
intellect had expanded to monstrous proportions; the
attendant at the counter was clay in my hands. Failing to
realize my cunning, he sold me an authentic red plastic
Devo "energy dome" for the ridiculously low price of $7.
Weaving my way through the swarms of airborne rep
tiles, I fought for position near the stage, where the new
wave crowd had already gathered. Sizing up the sea of

young faces, I estimated a turnout of about half a million
people, stretching to the horizon in all directions. Devo's
popularity has grown, I dimly concluded. Through
pupils big as saucers, I took in rapidly shifting images.
The concert opened with short Devo flicks projected
onto a large screen in front of the stage. The crowd went
wild when an army-general type announced the de
evolution of the human race, the idea which is Devo's
namesake. Mark Mothersbaugh, the lead vocalist, ap
peared on the screen i a white laboratory smock. Jerking
spastically he sang "Are we not men?" Dressed in
straight jackets and sunglasses, the rest of the band re
plied (along with an enthusiastic audience), "We are
Devo."
Other movie shorts included "I Can't Get No Satisfac

tion" and the Mow Traditionalists tunes "Love Without
Anger," "Beautiful World," and "Through Being Cool."
When the concert began an announcer appeared on
the screen. "So vou've decided to attend a live Devo per
formance. . .forget your old traditions, the world needs
Devo's new traditions." But Devo's N/ew Traditionalists
songs are uncharacteristically devoid of newness or ori
ginality. If anything, they have grown more conventional
in both musical style and lyrics. As their popularity
grows, they are becoming that which they attempt to
satirize: a mainstream rock group, composing with an
eye for the Top 40, putting crowd-pleasing ahead of any
kind of artistic message. What started out as a small
group of unknowns with a cult following, admirable for
their dedication to weirdness (lacking anything else) has

become a packaged product.
On the sleeve of the New Traditionalists album (which
I foolishly purchased before the concert) Devo's new
commercialism is egregiously evident. It reads like a
mail-order catalogue â€” it even has an order form with a
dotted line to cut along, so you can send in for your f a .
vorite patented Devo products. For the paltry sum of Sl5,
you can have your very own Devo action vest, "devolved
action wear" for the Devotee. Or "protect yourself from
dangerous human elements and stay cool during
meltdowns" with a "Yellow Suit" for only $13.50. Re the
first kid on your block to join Club Devo. They even off er
a Devo "E-Z listening cassette," with watered-down
Muzak versions of Devo "classics."
