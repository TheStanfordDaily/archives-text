# Jazz across the waters

### Ted Gioia 
Giorgio Gaslini, the Italian
jazz pianist, has suffered the
same fate shared by many lead
ing European exponents of
jazz: while recognized as a ma
jor talent in his own country,
Gaslini remains virtually un
known in this country. During
the past several years Gaslini's
records have finally become
easily available in the United
States, yet they have gained vir
tually no airplay and one sus
pects that their sales have been
poor.
Gaslini demonstrated, in an
appearance Thursday night at
the Knoll Annex, that the neg
lect of his music in this country
is both unfortunate and un
justified. Gaslini displayed
both a competent command of
his instrument and an ability to
accomodate himself to a varie
ty of musical styles.
It is as a composer, however,
that Gaslini is most impressive;
he is able to extract an amazing
variety of sounds from his
quintet — typically a Gaslini
composition wavers between
the type of late impressionism
one associates with Debussy
and Ravel and the avant garde
explorations of Elliot Carter
and Charles Ives; yet one hears
elementsof the blues, stride pi
ano, and bebop in his playing.

The influence of the classical
avant garde on Gaslini's music
is in many ways a striking re
minder of the different musical
culture in which his style de
veloped. The ties between jazz
and classical music are much
closer in Italy than in this coun
try. Gaslini is conservatory
trained, and this is not unusual
for Italian jazz artists. Unlike
America, where jazz is in many
ways tainted by its long associa
tionnwith popular music and is
still considered by many as a
type of ethnic folk music, Italy
has long cherished jazz as a
"high-brow" art. Jazz artists
such as Cecil Taylor, Archie
Shepp, Sam Rivers, Joseph
Jarman, and Roscoe Mitchell,
whose complex, often classi
cally-oriented works were fora
long time largely ignored in the
United States, found a willing
and appreciative audience in
Italy. Many of the finest albums
of experimental jazz music by
American artists have been
coming out of Italy during the
past several years, mostly be
cause American record labels
have had little interest in pro
moting this type of work. The
Italian jazz magazine, La Musi
ra lazz, gives extensive cov
erage to the avant garde and
ranks among the best jazz peri
odicals in the world because of
the seriousness of its approach.

If one approachs the work of
Caslini in this light, it is easier to
understand the intent and
scope of his work. Gaslini
creates music of great com
plexity and depth, while largely
eschewing the popular music
elements which characterize
much of contemporary jazz.
This is music which is more at
home in a concert hall than in a
smoke-filled cluh.
The concert, jointly spon
sored by the Italian Cultural In
stitute of San Francisco and
Stanford's La Casa Italiana,
opened with Gaslini's com
position "Free Action." A
raucous introduction, remi
niscent of Cecil Taylor's Unit
Structures, melted into a
melodic, almost bossa nova
like, melody based on an
ascending chromatic bass line;
this tantalizing interlude led
into an a cappella bass clarinet
passage which developed into
a polyphonic exchange be
tween the two reed players,
which eventually led the group
back to the bossa nova melody.
This intricate combination of
diverse musical styles is typical
of Gaslini's work. His music is
full of ingenious twists and
turns and felicitous surprises.
This was most clearly seen in
Gaslini's lovely "Mediter
ranean Suite" which show
cased Gaslini's ability to as

siinilate elements of Italian folk
music into a jazz context. In
presenting the five Italian folk
melodies that were the build
ing blocks of the composition,
Gaslini touched on a variety of
musical settings, all with skill
and insight. The Suite was
clearly the showpiece of the
concert and left one with the
desire to hear it again several
times in order to savour the de
velopment of the melodies and
the tasteful use of substitute
harmonies.
The neglect of Gaslini's mu
sic in the United States is un

fortunately all too typical of the
reaction of American jazz fans
to European jazz artists. The
number of premier European
based jazz musicians whose
work is largely unknown here
is almost ridiculous — the Pole
Adam Makowicz, the French-
Algerian Martial Sola I, the Aus
trian Friedrich Gulda, along
with Gaslini, have spent years
developing music of beauty
and diversity, and yet are con
sistently ignored while atten
tion is lavished on local artists
with only a fraction of their tal
ent.

The concert, jointly spon
sored by the Italian Cultural In
stitute of San Francisco and
Stanford's La Casa Italiana,
opened with Gaslini's com
position "Free Action." A
raucous introduction, remi
niscent of Cecil Taylor's Unit
Structures, melted into a
melodic, almost bossa nova
like, melody based on an
ascending chromatic bass line;
this tantalizing interlude led
into an a cappella bass clarinet
passage which developed into
a polyphonic exchange be
tween the two reed players,
which eventually led the group
back to the bossa nova melody.
This intricate combination of
diverse musical styles is typical
of Gaslini's work. His music is
full of ingenious twists and
turns and felicitous surprises.
This was most clearly seen in
Gaslini's lovely "Mediter
ranean Suite" which show
cased Gaslini's ability to as

siinilate elements of Italian folk
music into a jazz context. In
presenting the five Italian folk
melodies that were the build
ing blocks of the composition,
Gaslini touched on a variety of
musical settings, all with skill
and insight. The Suite was
clearly the showpiece of the
concert and left one with the
desire to hear it again several
times in order to savour the de
velopment of the melodies and
the tasteful use of substitute
harmonies.
The neglect of Gaslini's mu
sic in the United States is un

fortunately all too typical of the
reaction of American jazz fans
to European jazz artists. The
number of premier European
based jazz musicians whose
work is largely unknown here
is almost ridiculous — the Pole
Adam Makowicz, the French-
Algerian Martial Sola I, the Aus
trian Friedrich Gulda, along
with Gaslini, have spent years
developing music of beauty
and diversity, and yet are con
sistently ignored while atten
tion is lavished on local artists
with only a fraction of their tal
ent.

Giorgio Gaslini
Giorgio Gaslini, the Italian
jazz pianist, has suffered the
same fate shared by many lead
ing European exponents of
jazz: while recognized as a ma
jor talent in his own country,
Gaslini remains virtually un
known in this country. During
the past several years Gaslini's
records have finally become
easily available in the United
States, yet they have gained vir
tually no airplay and one sus
pects that their sales have been
poor.
Gaslini demonstrated, in an
appearance Thursday night at
the Knoll Annex, that the neg
lect of his music in this country
is both unfortunate and un
justified. Gaslini displayed
both a competent command of
his instrument and an ability to
accomodate himself to a varie
ty of musical styles.
It is as a composer, however,
that Gaslini is most impressive;
he is able to extract an amazing
variety of sounds from his
quintet — typically a Gaslini
composition wavers between
the type of late impressionism
one associates with Debussy
and Ravel and the avant garde
explorations of Elliot Carter
and Charles Ives; yet one hears
elementsof the blues, stride pi
ano, and bebop in his playing.

The influence of the classical
avant garde on Gaslini's music
is in many ways a striking re
minder of the different musical
culture in which his style de
veloped. The ties between jazz
and classical music are much
closer in Italy than in this coun
try. Gaslini is conservatory
trained, and this is not unusual
for Italian jazz artists. Unlike
America, where jazz is in many
ways tainted by its long associa
tionnwith popular music and is
still considered by many as a
type of ethnic folk music, Italy
has long cherished jazz as a
"high-brow" art. Jazz artists
such as Cecil Taylor, Archie
Shepp, Sam Rivers, Joseph
Jarman, and Roscoe Mitchell,
whose complex, often classi
cally-oriented works were fora
long time largely ignored in the
United States, found a willing
and appreciative audience in
Italy. Many of the finest albums
of experimental jazz music by
American artists have been
coming out of Italy during the
past several years, mostly be
cause American record labels
have had little interest in pro
moting this type of work. The
Italian jazz magazine, La Musi
ra lazz, gives extensive cov
erage to the avant garde and
ranks among the best jazz peri
odicals in the world because of
the seriousness of its approach.

If one approachs the work of
Caslini in this light, it is easier to
understand the intent and
scope of his work. Gaslini
creates music of great com
plexity and depth, while largely
eschewing the popular music
elements which characterize
much of contemporary jazz.
This is music which is more at
home in a concert hall than in a
smoke-filled cluh.
