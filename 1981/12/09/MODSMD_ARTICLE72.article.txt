# J. Geils frozen in post-pubescent paradise

### Stefan Malmoli 
I didn't grow up in Palo Alto before I came to Stan
ford. I didn't even grow up in California. Instead, I was
a New York city punk who went west. Therefore, in
reminiscing about home, I inevitably think back to mv
public high school days. Just thinking about those
high school highs and lows always brings a smile to my
face. I recall the gang fights and teacher stabbings just
as vividly as my academic endeavors. I recall the joys
of "cutting out" and "hanging out" in the hallways.
("Yes, Principal Kempler, I'll get to class as soon as I
finish buying these drugs.") But above all, I recall the
girls of my high school days. Ahh, what fun times. Re
member those times of passing notes, or those times
when everyone was crowding around the peephole
that revealed the girls' locker room, who could
forget those after-class "homework" sessions, or
those secret rendezvous behind the football
bleachers.
Of course, for fairly "good" guys like myself, one
had a tough time to impress those girls who wore only
the tightest of pants and the sexiest of shoes. (You
know who I'm talking about, frat-men. These are the
same girls as the Paly High girls.) Well, usually one
never got to make it with those girls, but it was the
chivalrous challenge that made even the brushoffs
worthwhile. It was just the excitement in trying to get

one of those girls that was important.
With the ]. Geils Band's new album, Freeze Frame,
one is shot back to those carefree high school days
with all the sexual fantasies intact. Now one can relive
the exhilaration those girls gave you without the per
sonal pain in failing to finally get the girl. However,
the album has more than just a masturbatory purpose.
It is actually a statement on every typical hot-blooded
teenager. It is an accurate account of the maturing
process of love. Therefore, the album succeeds on
those points since it recalls those lost days vividly and
brings back many fond and frivolous memories.
The epitome of the whole high school experience is
therefore present in the album's best tune, "Center
fold." It is the perfect song to describe those days be
cause it places you back in your high school classroom
when you were trying to figure out what it was that
the girl in the second row had over you: "Slipped me
notes under the desk, while I was thinkin' about her
dress. . .1 was shakin' in my shoes, whenever she
flashed those baby-blues." Then the song sends you
back to fantasizing over the girl: "Those soft and
fuzzv sweaters/Too magical to touch/To see her in
that negligee is really just too much." However, just as
with these high school dreams, it was only wasted ex
citement and energy: "A part of me has just been
ripped/the pages from my mind are stripped."

The other songs continue with this theme by bring
ing up more of those girls who you never got to know
on a closer basis. In "Flamethrower," one is face to
face with one of those girls. The song itself is a
"flamethrower" as it burns into your past memories:
"Silently she waits/Silently she contemplates/She can
make 'em tremble/You know the reason why." And
then in "Do You Remember When," one really does
remember the pain of failed attempts at romance.
However, although in the band's attempts at send
ing us back to our high school days through the lyrics'
storylines, the band has forgetten to include top
notch material. Only about half of the album suc
ceeds on a strictly musical basis. It lacks much of the
punch of the J. Geils Band's earlier work. Basically, it is
not a step forward, and even with the band's tight
playing and singing, it is a reworking of older motifs.
Therefore, the remainder of this review should deal
with the album as a whole. As mentioned before,
"Centerfold," "Flamethrower," and "Do You Re
member When" are the highpoints. Also, the Phil
Spector-inspired "Angel in Blue" is an excellent slow
paced number that is bittersweet in its description of a
boy who is willing to forget a girl's risque past, while
the girl won't even give him a chance to try: "When I
whispered I thought I could love her/She just said,
'Baby, don't even bother to try.'"
