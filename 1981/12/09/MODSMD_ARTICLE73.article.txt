# 'Godspell' gets played for laughs
## 
### Katie Smith 
With a circus tent setting,
life-size rabbit ushers, songs by
Stephen Schwartz, and a cast
reminiscent of Saturday Night
live, Godspell had a formula
guaranteed to bring smiles and
give inspiration for the Dead
Week crunch.
Sitting in bleachers around
an abandoned circus ring,
complete with lion cages and a
high wire, the audience knew
thev were in fora creative eve
ning even before the ring
master (musical director Lita
l.iback) walked in. The lights
went on, the show began, and
the audience got its fill of big
top laughs, thrills, and sur
prises. From a special fish
shaped lighting effect to herald
Jesus's (Steve Bushwall's) com
ing, to Bushwall's dive off the
high wire into a 600-pound-test
string net signifying Christ's
crucifixion, the show
abounded with innovations.
Actors were equally creative
in choosing comic vehicles to

act out Christ's parables. Most
notable were McCall
Punahee's "Rosanne Rosanna
Danna" narration of the Good
Samaritan, Kevin Reidy's "Mas
terpiece Theatre" rendition of
thetale of Lazarus, and a down
home, knee-slapping, Texan
version of the Prodigal Son
which featured Tom Williams.
Lots of "inside" Stanford hu
mor, like "Face" and Marin
Countv jokes, detracted a bit
from the show's pro
fessionalism, but involved the
audience on a Ga/'ef/'es-level
psvche. Some watchers even
got to participate phvsically, as
the cast pulled the front row
into the ring to dance to "You
Are the Light of the World."
The script of Godspell is
based on the Bible's book of
Matthew, and here director
Brian Prestwich made two
notable changes. In the ori
ginal script John the Baptist and
Judas are played by the same
person Prestwich removed
this confusion. He had Tom

Williams wear the yellow fur
and "prepare (ve) the way of
the Lord" and left Kevin Reidy
to work solely on developing
ludas's character. Prestwich
also ended the show with the
resurrection, which accords
with Matthew but is left out of
the official Godspell script. The
inclusion of the resurrection
succeeded in making Godspell
an inspiring story of faith and
hope, and gave meaning to the
show's final number, "Long
Live God." It also gave the au
dience an accurate presenta
tion of the gospel and. . .a hap
py ending.
While Prestwich's idea of
"Godspell in a tent" may be the
greatest innovation to hit
Ram's Head, his set was not
without logistical problems.
The show required a $9000
budget, and relatively few peo
ple could be seated for each
showing. Special heaters had to
be set up to warm the au
dience, and a crew member
had to man the tent 24 hours a

day for security reasons. Circus
equipment turned out to be a
stumbling block for some of
Christ's disciples: several ac
tors contracted Gerald Forditis.
•\coustics were poor at times.
Voices came across weaklv in
the opening Prologue song,
anil the orchestra drowned out
parts of Williams's "All Good
Gifts" and Bushwall's "Mas for
You." Sound problems were
compensated for by duet and
trio singing, and the cast had a
tremendous choral blend and
projection. Alexandra Cossu
("Bless the Lord") and Williams
(in "All Good Gifts") both dis
played remarkable yocal
ranges. Bushwall's voice had a
threat tonal quality for his part;
however, his projection lacked
at times.
The set also put constraints
on Susie Cashion and )im
Sakamoto's choreography.
With the notable exceptions of
"Day by Day"and "All for the
Best," chorus numbers had a
redundant quality. Movements

were effective, but tended to
reappear several times over
and always made use of the
same parts of the stage. For
those people that had seen the
"flashlight version" of "You
Are the Light of the World,"
this production's "non-flash"
staging of the song was a bit
disappointing. However, the
audience participation was a
fun way to end the dance. Par
able blocking and solo dance
numbers, such as Dunahee's
"Turn Back, O Man," were
much more creative and varied
in terms of set use.
While Godspell offered lots
of humor and creativity, it
tended to sacrifice its dramatic
potential for laughs. The Last
Supper was indeed moving, but
potentially stirring scenes such
as "By Thy Side" ran too quick
ly into funny parable skits, thus
detracting from their poign
ancy. Sometimes the entire
point of a parable was ob
scured for the sake of a joke —
we'll all remember the Marin
County guru, but what the hell

did he sav? The major obstacle
to the show's dramatic poten
tial was the script itself. Actor's
switched characters in each
sketch, and the result was what
looked like a bunch of students
having fun rather than Christ
developing relations with his
disciples. Reidv had onlv three
"straight" lines with which to
develop the character of Judas,
quite a task for anyone. (He did
admirably, considering.)
Dunahee succeeded in de
veloping her "femme fa tale"
character with the help of her
costume, song, and a running
flirtation with Alex Kaufman,
Ann Osmond developed the
character of a timid, sensitive
disciple, Tom Williams came
off as a young and "out to
change the world" sort, and
Dawn Atkinson added a fairly
consistent, abrasive, "rough
edges" element to the show.
Other disciple's personalities
were less easily grasped and
they tended to appear group
elements rather than individ
ual characters. Bushwall, who

had the most potential of any
one for character develop
ment, did a good job of
portraying Jesus the parable
teacher, but definitely lacked
in his moreseriousscenes. It'sa
good thing he came back to
life, for his death scene would
not have made him a superstar.
In fact, the real superstar of
the show was Cathy Ransom,
the owner of a million dollar
smile and the fastest hands in
rhe West. Completely deaf, she
positively effervesced on stage
and never once looked con
fused as she took part in skits
and dances. She signed along
with most of the songs and had
the most emotional rapport
with lesus of any of the dis
ciples.
Hamming it up and clever
jokes aside, Ransom provided
the biggest reason to come out
of the tent grinning. Perhaps
her performance provided the
real message of Godspell — it
doesn't matter what vour abili
ties are, believing is what it's all
about.

"Day by Day"and "All for the
Best," chorus numbers had a
redundant quality. Movements

were effective, but tended to
reappear several times over
and always made use of the
same parts of the stage. For
those people that had seen the
"flashlight version" of "You
Are the Light of the World,"
this production's "non-flash"
staging of the song was a bit
disappointing. However, the
audience participation was a
fun way to end the dance. Par
able blocking and solo dance
numbers, such as Dunahee's
"Turn Back, O Man," were
much more creative and varied
in terms of set use.
While Godspell offered lots
of humor and creativity, it
tended to sacrifice its dramatic
potential for laughs. The Last
Supper was indeed moving, but
potentially stirring scenes such
as "By Thy Side" ran too quick
ly into funny parable skits, thus
detracting from their poign
ancy. Sometimes the entire
point of a parable was ob
scured for the sake of a joke —
we'll all remember the Marin
County guru, but what the hell

did he sav? The major obstacle
to the show's dramatic poten
tial was the script itself. Actor's
switched characters in each
sketch, and the result was what
looked like a bunch of students
having fun rather than Christ
developing relations with his
disciples. Reidv had onlv three
"straight" lines with which to
develop the character of Judas,
quite a task for anyone. (He did
admirably, considering.)
Dunahee succeeded in de
veloping her "femme fa tale"
character with the help of her
costume, song, and a running
flirtation with Alex Kaufman,
Ann Osmond developed the
character of a timid, sensitive
disciple, Tom Williams came
off as a young and "out to
change the world" sort, and
Dawn Atkinson added a fairly
consistent, abrasive, "rough
edges" element to the show.
Other disciple's personalities
were less easily grasped and
they tended to appear group
elements rather than individ
ual characters. Bushwall, who

had the most potential of any
one for character develop
ment, did a good job of
portraying Jesus the parable
teacher, but definitely lacked
in his moreseriousscenes. It'sa
good thing he came back to
life, for his death scene would
not have made him a superstar.
In fact, the real superstar of
the show was Cathy Ransom,
the owner of a million dollar
smile and the fastest hands in
rhe West. Completely deaf, she
positively effervesced on stage
and never once looked con
fused as she took part in skits
and dances. She signed along
with most of the songs and had
the most emotional rapport
with lesus of any of the dis
ciples.
Hamming it up and clever
jokes aside, Ransom provided
the biggest reason to come out
of the tent grinning. Perhaps
her performance provided the
real message of Godspell — it
doesn't matter what vour abili
ties are, believing is what it's all
about.

With a circus tent setting,
life-size rabbit ushers, songs by
Stephen Schwartz, and a cast
reminiscent of Saturday Night
live, Godspell had a formula
guaranteed to bring smiles and
give inspiration for the Dead
Week crunch.
Sitting in bleachers around
an abandoned circus ring,
complete with lion cages and a
high wire, the audience knew
thev were in fora creative eve
ning even before the ring
master (musical director Lita
l.iback) walked in. The lights
went on, the show began, and
the audience got its fill of big
top laughs, thrills, and sur
prises. From a special fish
shaped lighting effect to herald
Jesus's (Steve Bushwall's) com
ing, to Bushwall's dive off the
high wire into a 600-pound-test
string net signifying Christ's
crucifixion, the show
abounded with innovations.
Actors were equally creative
in choosing comic vehicles to

act out Christ's parables. Most
notable were McCall
Punahee's "Rosanne Rosanna
Danna" narration of the Good
Samaritan, Kevin Reidy's "Mas
terpiece Theatre" rendition of
thetale of Lazarus, and a down
home, knee-slapping, Texan
version of the Prodigal Son
which featured Tom Williams.
Lots of "inside" Stanford hu
mor, like "Face" and Marin
Countv jokes, detracted a bit
from the show's pro
fessionalism, but involved the
audience on a Ga/'ef/'es-level
psvche. Some watchers even
got to participate phvsically, as
the cast pulled the front row
into the ring to dance to "You
Are the Light of the World."
The script of Godspell is
based on the Bible's book of
Matthew, and here director
Brian Prestwich made two
notable changes. In the ori
ginal script John the Baptist and
Judas are played by the same
person Prestwich removed
this confusion. He had Tom

Williams wear the yellow fur
and "prepare (ve) the way of
the Lord" and left Kevin Reidy
to work solely on developing
ludas's character. Prestwich
also ended the show with the
resurrection, which accords
with Matthew but is left out of
the official Godspell script. The
inclusion of the resurrection
succeeded in making Godspell
an inspiring story of faith and
hope, and gave meaning to the
show's final number, "Long
Live God." It also gave the au
dience an accurate presenta
tion of the gospel and. . .a hap
py ending.
While Prestwich's idea of
"Godspell in a tent" may be the
greatest innovation to hit
Ram's Head, his set was not
without logistical problems.
The show required a $9000
budget, and relatively few peo
ple could be seated for each
showing. Special heaters had to
be set up to warm the au
dience, and a crew member
had to man the tent 24 hours a

day for security reasons. Circus
equipment turned out to be a
stumbling block for some of
Christ's disciples: several ac
tors contracted Gerald Forditis.
•\coustics were poor at times.
Voices came across weaklv in
the opening Prologue song,
anil the orchestra drowned out
parts of Williams's "All Good
Gifts" and Bushwall's "Mas for
You." Sound problems were
compensated for by duet and
trio singing, and the cast had a
tremendous choral blend and
projection. Alexandra Cossu
("Bless the Lord") and Williams
(in "All Good Gifts") both dis
played remarkable yocal
ranges. Bushwall's voice had a
threat tonal quality for his part;
however, his projection lacked
at times.
The set also put constraints
on Susie Cashion and )im
Sakamoto's choreography.
