Compare the following quotes. The first is
from The Odysseus Manuscripts: the new
volume of poems by English Prof. Ken Fields,
director of the Poetry Program at Stanford —
and the serond is from Christopher Logue's
Poundian translation of the Iliad.
These are mere fahles: like Odysseus's bed
— Who would not love to see that mystery?
Surely rut down for firewood long ago.
Now only truth remains: a persistent song,
A fiction telling of his lonely life;
Which we preserve because it is our own.
(And compare that with:)
. . . The left horse falls. The right prances
through blades,
Tearing its belly like a silk balloon,
And the shields inch forward under
bowshots,
And under the shields the half-lost soldiers
think,
'We fight when the sun rises. When it sets we
count the dead.. .
It is true that men are clever
Hut the least of men is cleverer than their
best.
Both are montaged interpretations of
Homer. Both have an iambic pentameter
ground rhythm. But the difference is one of
attitude; precisely because Logue regards
the Homeric world as infinitely more ma

jestic than the real one, he is paradoxically
capable of staging a take-over bid, of in
corporating the Homeric voice into his own.
On the other hand, Fields, reading the
Odyssev as if tensed in the continuous pres
ent, approaches and reapproaches Homer
without ever passing, as if conducting a per
manent courtship.
Of course this is an oversimplification of
Field's attitude: the passage quoted above is
from a triptych of poems entitled "Bearings"
which concludes:
. . In this man
Table became our history and our plan:
I /e was not all the others, he was he.
Fven so, whereas Logue moves on a ver
tical axis between here and above; Fields
moves on the horizontal one between here
and there.
Throughout his poetical career Fields has
used mythology as a starting point for Win
tersian speculation.
In his first book The Other Walker he jux
taposed spry epigrammatic poems with
more open-ended ones related to the Amer
ican Indian tradition. In his later works, Sun
bellv and Smoke, this tradition became a
mythological frame of reference, thereby
gaining confidence in handling auto
biographical material. The Odysseus Man
uscripts is a new departure in several ways.
The Homeric legends became an objec
tive correlative, and Fields used this to
springboard away from the overtly auto
biographical to a gallery of screened person
as: the poems are accredited to an array of
characters from the Odyssey, everybody
from the goddess Athene to Odysseus's dog.

The first poem is entitled'"Athene: The
Owl."
I am himself though he does not know it
Drawing his wiliness into my love,

I am the straight way, through his crooked
nesses.
The <juiet voice within,
not the loud word above.

The light. The fire. The woodsmoke.
Even the sacrifices.
Note the splendid music of the last line:
shifting from a clear rising rhythm to a mut
tering falling one.
This theme recurs throughout: Athene,
the goddess of both War and Art, infiltrates
into the voyage of Odysseus, and is also the
symbol of the poetic sequence itself.
Again and again, Athene, tutelary spirit of
The Odysseus Manuscripts, speaks out. She
is the eponymous heroine of five of them,
and her comments and philosophy in
tersperse Odysseus' escapades.
Next, the cattle of the sun are awarded an
epitaph in four haiku — and then Athene
m utters:
These things and more, ambiguous vertigoes
These promptings bring you life, we bring
you death.
But Odysseus sails on, drifts, and at night
fall, thinking of Athene:
Meed, like an owl, falls suddenly upon me
Can it be that she sees me, even in my dark?
(Lovely vowel-music; and Fields deserves
a prize for resisting the temptation to half
rhvme this couplet.)
And again, Athene, in the guise of her
symbol the owl:
. . . For"it is
The lion's claw, the lion's tooth and need,
That has given the deer its beauty grace and
speed."
This theme of the beauty of suffering is
one that Fields gingerly accepts and rejects.
It is a merit of the structure of the "se

quence" that this can be done without hav :
ing to stake out an autobiographical claim.
The voyage is over. Odvsseus returns to
Ithaca, to his home. He sees himself: an old"
man, unkempt, unrecognized, his wife-,
besieged by suitors. Only his dog remem
bers mistily:
Long ago, long ago, we
Are happy dogs
Walking into a grey fog
From off the sea.
And the mood has darkened.
Odysseus creeping in among the suitorv
like a beggar, fingering his bow as if it were a
Ivre, and then,
Strings the great bow, before their eyes can
follow
And plucks the string, which through the si
lent hall
Sends the sharp thrill of doom, like a tiny
swallow
And so the Odyssey is complete and
Odysseus drifts off into retirement and death
Fields is a writer of two moods. He can sj*t
out from a spry Wintersian rootedness, as if
the validity of poetic experience mattered.
But he also writes with glittering technique;-
he harmonizes sense and sound-textufe
with finesse, which is more complex if not
more important.
Fields dedicated one of his earlier books to
Gitta, around whom revolve its de
terminations and harmonies — and 'de
termination and harmonies' are in the ertd
what is valuable in his work.
