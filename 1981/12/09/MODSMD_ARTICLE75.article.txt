DINAH'S SHACK
4269 El Camino Real
Palo Afto
493-9510
Don t in on look at the menu (v\hose
black mammy cover is insulting to
begin with) — just head straight for
Dinah's extraordinary smorgasbord. At
$7.25 ($5.50 is the lunchtime price) foras
manv platefuls as vou can consume, it's
a pretty unbeatable offer, and the main
attraction of this local landmark.
Dinah's has been around since 1926,
v\ hen it first opened as a Chicken-in-a
basket walk-up establishment. Stanford
students began carving their names into
Dinah's bar and lounge walls, making
this an old wooden memory lane for
manv Stanford alumni.
Owner John Rickev has decorated
Dinah's with some of his prized art
pieces, including paintings from Leland
Stanford's personal collection and from
Winchester House. Still, some may find
the decor to tend toward "friendly clut
ter"; I must admit that the combination
of marble sculptures and plastic flowers
struck me as "cheerfully tacky," to put it
mildlv. . .
Dinah's 40-item smorgasbord fea
tures a broad spectrum of foods:
beyond the vast array of salad "fixins"
(kidney beans, chick-peas, cucumbers,

sprouts, pickles, onions, etc.), there are
numerous cold salad dishes — cole
slaw, carrot salad, potato salad,
macaroni salad — and more unusual of
ferings as well, including marinated
pigs' feet, pastrami mixed with fresh
vegetables, and a sticky, cinnamon
flavored rice pudding. There are plat
ters of cold cuts and cheeses, bowls of
fresh shrimp and fresh fruit, pickled
herring and hot peppers, and a selec
tion of hot items: among them, bat
tered, deep-fried fish and scallops, and
a thick, beef goulash.
The key word is PACING, and a de
scriptive card on each dining table sug
gests a recommended "sequence,"
starting with items like herring and
progressing through to dessert selec
tions like ambrosia.
Mv companion and I made a couple
of ordering errors: first, we selected full
course dinners from the menu, and sec
ond, she opted for soup and salad to ac
company her meal rather than the alter
native once-around-t he-smorgasbord.
The meal began on a bit of a sour
note; the homemade buttermilk
biscuits were exceedingly doughy,
dropping to the bottoms of our stom

achs like miniature lead balloons. While
I worked my way around the
smorgasbord, my guest was served her
small cup of clam chowder — a creamy,
homemade blend with bits of seafood. I
got back to the table (with my well
stacked plate of goodies) in time for the
arrival of her token salad — a surprising-

lv unimaginative pile of lettuce topped
with shredded beets. (Was she being
punished for not selecting the
smorgasbord???)
Our waitress, though not overly
friendly, promptly brought us our en
trees; I had ordered the Pacific Salmon
Steak (59.25, including the
smorgasbord), and found it very pink,
very fresh, and less-than-spectacularly
tasty. Still, the lemony Bernaise sauce
added a flavorful touch.
Mv companion had ordered a medi
um Teriyaki Steak ($8.75, including
the best fried chicken to be found.
For dessert, we tried Dinah's Old
Fashioned Carrot Cake ($1), and a
Strawberry Parfait ($1.75), which wases

soup and salad), and unfortunately re
ceived a very well done piece of
marinated meat. Oh well. Both of these
main courses were accompanied by
rather uninspired rice and sauteed veg
etables. Our third mistake may have
been in not ordering Dinah's Southern
Fried Chicken, which I'm told is some of

peciallv good and topped with fresh
whipped cream. The cream came in
handy when I sipped my coffee — a dis
appointing cup of vending machine
quality.
Dining at Dinah's can be as informal
as vou please; I saw a couple in formal
attire (was it prom night?) and a couple
in very well-worn jeans, and there were
quite a few single customers who came
in with books for company. And for live
entertainment, harpist Phyllis
Schlomoritz plays nightly.
Go to Dinah's and try the
smorgasbord — it's convenient, reason
ably priced, and well worth visiting.
