This is not the easiest restau
rant to find if vou haven't been
warned that it's connected to
the Cameo Club, a poker
parlor not far south of Page
Mill Road. This American-Viet
namese restaurant is in the
back, with quiet lettering on
the door.
Inside, vou'll find darkly
paneled walls with red
tablecloths and candles. Dark
and sparsely peopled, it would
be without atmosphere if it
weren't for the loud gamblers
in the adjoining club: yells
from the gaming room are
muted by the calm, dark
panels. The Cameo Club's full
bar was rowdy, but waitresses
managed to calmly travel back
and forth from restaurant to
bar.
The N.C. Restaurant used to
be "Archies," a hamburger,
fries, and omelette kitchen that
serviced the Cameo Club. But
Dr. Canh Nguyen, a visiting
professor at the Hoover Institu
tion, and his wife, Thanh Vu,
bought "Archies" this past Au
gust, and renamed it with his
initials, "N.C."
Thanh Vu, the illustrious
cook, says that it took her two
weeks to master the cooking of
American food for the Cameo

Club. "Then I started preparing
Vietnamese food for the res
taurant," she says with a smile.
The Vietnamese food she
prepares is Northern Vietnam
ese, and she uses absolutely no
MSG or fat in any of her cook
ing. Touring through her
simple, clean kitchen, I found
onlv olive and sesame oils. I ate
nothing that I didn't love, and I
left happily stuffed.
Although Vietnamese food
can be hot, at the N.C. the
choice is the diner's; a small
(fish of coarselv grounded hot
peppers is placed on the table
at the start .of the meal, to ig
nore, use for bravura displays
or even to enjoy — the peppers
are freshlv ground and their
fire stays on your tongue and
lips for more than a little while.
However, without dipping into
this innocuous-looking dish of
chilis, Thanh Vu's dishes are de
lectably un-firey — without
even the faintest burn to them.
She is truly an artist, mixing
spices familiar to the Chinese
food-lover — ginger and anise
seed, for example — with
Southeast Asian charbroiling.
The crab asparagus soup
($1.50) was a perfect opening to
a splendid meal. Lots of crab
and lots of asparagus. There
was some chicken stock flavor
and a few egg drops, but the
predominant item — and
flavor — was crab. It was beau
tiful.

I recommend the Dinner
Plates, which come with a main
course, a chicken salad (a type
of cole slaw with grated cab
bage, carrots, shredded
chicken and a vinegar dress
ing), steamed rice, and two of
Thanh Vu's "special sauces." I
chose the Combination Plate
beacuse it had the largest as
sortment of things to try. Ev
erything on my plate was dif
ferent, glorious, and freshly
cooked. The entire Combina
tion Plate cost $5.95, and was
served with a rich jasmine tea.
My companion's main
course consisted of Imperial
Roll, Shish-Kebob and
chicken. I found the Imperial
Roll far superior to a Chinese
Spring Roll; it was wrapped in
rice paper and stuffed with
shrimp, vegetables, dried black
mushrooms and Chinese ver
micelli. It was fried in such hot
sesame oil that there was no
greasy aftertaste, nor was there
any grease left on my fingers.
One of the sauces was tart, with
carrots in it, and the crispy Im
perial Roll dipped into this
sauce stayed crispy. Its tartness
brought out the flavors of both
the shrimp and the vegetables.
The Shish-Kebob tasted of
the Chines Five Spices — mild,
exotic and sweet. Its flavor re
minded me of the Satay stands'
shish-kebob that one sees in
the street stalls of Southeast

even the faintest burn to them.
She is truly an artist, mixing
spices familiar to the Chinese
food-lover — ginger and anise
seed, for example — with
Southeast Asian charbroiling.
The crab asparagus soup
($1.50) was a perfect opening to
a splendid meal. Lots of crab
and lots of asparagus. There
was some chicken stock flavor
and a few egg drops, but the
predominant item — and
flavor — was crab. It was beau
tiful.

I recommend the Dinner
Plates, which come with a main
course, a chicken salad (a type
of cole slaw with grated cab
bage, carrots, shredded
chicken and a vinegar dress
ing), steamed rice, and two of
Thanh Vu's "special sauces." I
chose the Combination Plate
beacuse it had the largest as
sortment of things to try. Ev
erything on my plate was dif
ferent, glorious, and freshly
cooked. The entire Combina
tion Plate cost $5.95, and was
served with a rich jasmine tea.
My companion's main
course consisted of Imperial
Roll, Shish-Kebob and
chicken. I found the Imperial
Roll far superior to a Chinese
Spring Roll; it was wrapped in
rice paper and stuffed with
shrimp, vegetables, dried black
mushrooms and Chinese ver
micelli. It was fried in such hot
sesame oil that there was no
greasy aftertaste, nor was there
any grease left on my fingers.
One of the sauces was tart, with
carrots in it, and the crispy Im
perial Roll dipped into this
sauce stayed crispy. Its tartness
brought out the flavors of both
the shrimp and the vegetables.
The Shish-Kebob tasted of
the Chines Five Spices — mild,
exotic and sweet. Its flavor re
minded me of the Satay stands'
shish-kebob that one sees in
the street stalls of Southeast

N.C. RESTAURANT
4120 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
494-3320
This is not the easiest restau
rant to find if vou haven't been
warned that it's connected to
the Cameo Club, a poker
parlor not far south of Page
Mill Road. This American-Viet
namese restaurant is in the
back, with quiet lettering on
the door.
Inside, vou'll find darkly
paneled walls with red
tablecloths and candles. Dark
and sparsely peopled, it would
be without atmosphere if it
weren't for the loud gamblers
in the adjoining club: yells
from the gaming room are
muted by the calm, dark
panels. The Cameo Club's full
bar was rowdy, but waitresses
managed to calmly travel back
and forth from restaurant to
bar.
The N.C. Restaurant used to
be "Archies," a hamburger,
fries, and omelette kitchen that
serviced the Cameo Club. But
Dr. Canh Nguyen, a visiting
professor at the Hoover Institu
tion, and his wife, Thanh Vu,
bought "Archies" this past Au
gust, and renamed it with his
initials, "N.C."
Thanh Vu, the illustrious
cook, says that it took her two
weeks to master the cooking of
American food for the Cameo

Club. "Then I started preparing
Vietnamese food for the res
taurant," she says with a smile.
The Vietnamese food she
prepares is Northern Vietnam
ese, and she uses absolutely no
MSG or fat in any of her cook
ing. Touring through her
simple, clean kitchen, I found
onlv olive and sesame oils. I ate
nothing that I didn't love, and I
left happily stuffed.
Although Vietnamese food
can be hot, at the N.C. the
choice is the diner's; a small
(fish of coarselv grounded hot
peppers is placed on the table
at the start .of the meal, to ig
nore, use for bravura displays
or even to enjoy — the peppers
are freshlv ground and their
fire stays on your tongue and
lips for more than a little while.
However, without dipping into
this innocuous-looking dish of
chilis, Thanh Vu's dishes are de
lectably un-firey — without
even the faintest burn to them.
She is truly an artist, mixing
spices familiar to the Chinese
food-lover — ginger and anise
seed, for example — with
Southeast Asian charbroiling.
