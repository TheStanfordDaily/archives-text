Ethnic food has certainly found its niche in
the average American's way of life, whether it
means pizza on Fridav nights, tacos for lunch, or
an occasional outing to a Chinese restaurant.
Many of the more adventurous regularly dine at
French, Italian or Greek restaurants, but very
few seem to explore the wonderful delicacies of
Japanese cuisine.
Eating a meal in a Japanese restaurant should
not be a solely gastronomic treat, it should be an

aesthetic experience as well. The dining room
should be simply but very tastefully decorated,
some bamboo and perhaps a couple of silk
screens on the wall, and the atmosphere should
be sedate and relaxing. The meal should be
served in a wide variety of intriguing recep

tacles, varying sized boards for the sushi, lack
ered wooden bowls for soup, cast iron pots for
Sukiyaki and simple, elegant china for much of
the rest. Finallv, the food should be artisticly pre

FUKISUSHI

Fukisushi offers all of the above with the ex
ception of the atmosphere. It is rather cramped
and suffers from a distinctly uninspiring decor,
but that's okay, as the bill is considerably less
hefty than at its more elegant counterparts. The
food, however, is no different. Our meal was di
verse, covering many different styles of cooking,
and not one of them could be faulted.
We started with an order of Assorted Tempura
($5.75), a variety of vegetables and shrimps
deep-fried in a wonderfully light batter, which
one dips in a soya based sauce. The consistency
and flavor were both impeccable. To clear the
palette, we followed this with bowls of Mis
oshiru ($1.25) and Akadashi ($1.25), two
Japanese soybean soups, one a red soybean, and
the other white; both were served in beautiful
Asia, except that the charcoal
broiled beef was fatless and
tender.
Dr. Canh explained that his
wife soaks the chicken — a ten
der, savory dream — overnight
in five spices, a little sesame oil
and sov sauce. She then bakes
it, slowly. It was perfectly
cooked, and natural juices
from the flavor-sealed meat
drenchfd the rice as I cut the
chicken. Again, no grease, just
delicious flavor.
Another must are the
Dolmades — a Greek name for
a Vietnamese treat. Beautiful
and unusual, these were bits of
pork wrapped in romaine let
tuce (Thanh Vu says it's the
closest approximation to her
Vietnamese greens). The small,
wrapped rolls were charcoal
broiled and served with a plum
sov sauce that was sprinkled
with grated peanuts. The taste
combination of Dolmade and
sauce was exotic and addictive.
Anyone who has wandered

through Southeast Asian mar
kets and remembers a sweet
fragrance drifting from the
tood stalls, will be pleased to
see Fried Bananas»on the N.C.'s
menu, with or without ice
cream, for dessert. Americans
know them as Banana Fritters,
but there's a touch of distinctly
Oriental spice in this battter. As
with everything at this restau
rant, the bananas are not
greasy.
While dining Vietnamese, I
heard waitresses shouting
"Burger and fries!" to Thanh
Vu. The menu is ex
tensive, offering the usual as
sortment of steaks, burgers,
chicken, prawns and scallops.
But without any MSG (i.e. no
"Accent") on the meat and no
unhe.ilthful fat in the frying —
as well as the N.C.'s knack with
charcoal broiling — I would
imagine that even these Ameri
can standards might be superi
or to the "usual usual."
