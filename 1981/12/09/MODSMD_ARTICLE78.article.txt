CAYLORD INDIA RES
TAURANT
Ghirardelli Square

771-8822
Sunday morning: into my
best suit, onto the 7F, then
the cable car, and still
bleary-eyed, down into my
seat in Gaylord's in
Ghiradelli Square . . .
"Now it's quite simple,"
this woman in the purple
dress was saying, "Lord
Krishna was jogging along
the lakeside in spring, and
what could be more natural
than that he drew a water
pistol from his pocket?" She
twisted her arms ap
propriately, and the waiter
poured me a glass of cham
pagne. "Well, of course he
filled it with red powderand
water, and looked around
fora beautiful maiden." She
made a "looking around"
gesture while I sipped the
champagne; it was ex
cellently dry.
"Eventually he spied
one," she continuted, "and
squirted the liquid in her
face. She wrungout her veil,
like this, and gazed coyly at
the god. Of course she kept
red powder in her pocket
too, so she flung some in his
face. He was angry, but she
said she was just getting
even." She stoked an im
aginary mustache, flung her
arms out expansively and
broke into a dance.
I rubbed my eves, side
stepping toward the brunch
buffer laden with: tomato,
cucumber, assorted sauces
and chutneys, eggplant in
batter and a variety of baked
squash, saffron rice, meat
balls pnd two kinds of
chicken. I maneuvered my
loaded plate back to my
table and tucked into the
first solid food of my day.
Meanwhile the woman in
the purple dress was mim
ing out the tale of Krishna in
a supposedly Indian dance.
She also wore three red
carnations pinned into her
black hair, giving her a faint
ly Spanish mien. Indeed,
there was more than a hint
nf flamenco in the dance,
which consisted of numer
ous thrustsof hand, foot and
head, with an occasional
swirl of the skirt. The ac
companiment on drums
and sitar was blandly Ameri
canized and tended to be
short on melodic complexi
ty.
Meanwhile, the brunch. I

began by sampling the egg
plant in batter, over which I
spooned tart sauce of
cucumber in yogurt. The
waiter brought a basket of
bread to the table. It looked
like pita, smelled like
toasted Fnglish muffin, and
tasted like pancake. I
amused myself dunking the
bread into pungent relishes
— a wonderfully vinegary
< hutnied mango, and some
thing like an Asian
Worcestershire sauce — dar
ingly nibbling, and rapidly
quenching my palette with
tomato slices.
Another sip of cham
pagne and onto the meats.
The meatballs were chewy
and throughly spiced; I
could detect basil, cumin
and coriander, among oth
ers. The chicken came in
two varieties. The first was
tando or i, which was
flavorful enough on the
outside but too pappy in
side. The second was
braised in a lumeric-rich
sauce, moist and aromatic
but lacking fruitiness and
body.
By this time, the dance
had paused, so I took time
to glance around the restau
rant. Plush and comfortable.
The clientele were plush
and comfortable too, and I
saw only one Indian family
in the place. Just a dash of
India in the furnishings,
potted palms, an intricate
woodcarving,and wallhang
ings depicting various com
binations of gods, maidens
in saris, rivers, trees, maid
ens not in saris . . .
Now dessert wan genuine.
First a spoonful of kir for old
times sake (kir is a concoc
tion of vermicelli poached
in milk, sugar and vanilla).
Second, two varieties of
brvi; this is a sort of Indian
fudge, heavy with nuts —
either almonds or cashews
— and for the sake of ex
travagance, it's stained with
slivers of silver foil. Brvi is at
-once highly fattening and
c uriously addictive.
Coffeearrived (Continen
tal roast), so I swigged a cup
ful as a final concession to
waking up, rubbed my eyes
one last time, crammed a
few sticks of brvi into my
pocket and strolled out info
San Francisco. Do I recom
mend this restaurant? Cer
tainly. If you've fallen into a
Sunday morning routine,
this will most definitely
knock vou out of it.
