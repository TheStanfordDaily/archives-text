THE OMELETTE HOUSE

If you're the kind of person who does not liketo
make difficult decisions early in the morning, it's
probably not a good idea to eat breakfast at The
Omelette House in San Mateo. An interesting
selection of more than 80 omelettes, as well as
pancakes and waffles ("If you must have breakfast
without omelettes," according to the menu) await
indecisive customers. With names like the"Oliver
Sudden," "Julius Cheezer," and "Banana Brazil
ian Flambe" (that is an omelette), selection is by
no means an easy process — unless, of course, you
have a clear-and-away favorite.
Like a peanut butter and jelly omelette (that's a
number 49 on the menu), which our waitress told
us was not exactly a hot item, but commanded the
devoted allegiance of a few — mainly children un
der six.
Or how about the Hawaiian — ham, pineapple,
peppers, bananas, raisins and coconut? Or the San
Mateo )oe (find out for yourself what's in that
one), the Athenian or the Teriyaki?
To be serious fora minute, a restaurant in San
Mateo, with neither a particulary outstanding at
mosphere inside nor pleasant surroundings out
side, hasto have a lot to recommend it for break
fast-hungry people to be willing to come up from
this area fora visit. It's about a 15-minute drive up
Highway 101 (don't plan on just going along for
the ride), or a slightly more arduous trip on Sam-
Trans for those who scorn the automobile.
If you're any kind of an omelette connoisseur
(we do exist), this restaurant is worth the trip, es
pecially if you're looking for any kind of excuse to
get out of Palo Alto (who isn't during Dead
Week?). The food is excellent, and both the selec
tion and the quality are a notch above just about
any offerings in closer proximity to Stanford. On
the other hand, it's probably not that much better,
and a lot of people are most likely not enthralled

enough about breakfast, to begin with, for the
journey to be worth their time.
We tried the "Russe," a delicious combination
of sauteed potatoes, bacon, scallions, sour cream
and chives. We also tried the Spanish, a combina
tion of celery, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions and
"secrets," according to the menu. This was still
good, but the mixture wound up slightly soggy.
Omelettes at The Omelette House are cooked
in a manner different from the way that most pre
pare them. Most chefs add the ingredients shortly
after the eggs begin to cook in the pan, while
here, the eggs are cooked in a pan separate from
the rest of the ingredients, which are folded in
only at the end, just before the dish is served. The
taste is different — the separate flavors stand out
more.
Highlights of The Omelette House are the ex
tras that go along with the meal. These include
banana nut bread, excellent French Bread, a side
of mushroom sauce or white cream sauce and a
lot of freshly ground hot coffee.
Also, between now and the new year, there's a
comlimentary glass of Buck's Fizz (champagne
and orange juice) served with every meal.
The prices are reasonable, ranging from a lowly
$3 fora plain or $3.50 (you guessed it, that's for the
peanut butter and jelly) to $6.50 fora special LI
DO-IT self-designed entree or $7 fora crab- or
shrimp-filled delicacy.
The atmosphere of the place is extremely
friendly, and certainly unpretentious. There's
clearly a local clientele, and on the day we were
there, a lot of people were crowded around a tel
evison set watching the 49ers smash the Bengals.
The service, if anything, was too prompt, but that's
only because we went on a leisurely Sunday morn
ing; if you ever have to go here and eat fast, you'll
undoubtedly appreciate the melange of good
food and quick service.
The restaurant seems small when viewed from
the front entrance, but can still hold about 70 peo
ple indoors. (The initial appearance hides a lot of

iho bark and a patio which, when open in warmer
months, holds about 60 people.) The decor is hardly
more than one would find at any local coffee shop

across the country. If you like local coffee shops,
you'll like this place, but if they're not classy enough
for vou, you may not feel satisified no matter how
good the food is.

If you're the kind of person who does not liketo
make difficult decisions early in the morning, it's
probably not a good idea to eat breakfast at The
Omelette House in San Mateo. An interesting
selection of more than 80 omelettes, as well as
pancakes and waffles ("If you must have breakfast
without omelettes," according to the menu) await
indecisive customers. With names like the"Oliver
Sudden," "Julius Cheezer," and "Banana Brazil
ian Flambe" (that is an omelette), selection is by
no means an easy process — unless, of course, you
have a clear-and-away favorite.
Like a peanut butter and jelly omelette (that's a
number 49 on the menu), which our waitress told
us was not exactly a hot item, but commanded the
devoted allegiance of a few — mainly children un
der six.
Or how about the Hawaiian — ham, pineapple,
peppers, bananas, raisins and coconut? Or the San
Mateo )oe (find out for yourself what's in that
one), the Athenian or the Teriyaki?
To be serious fora minute, a restaurant in San
Mateo, with neither a particulary outstanding at
mosphere inside nor pleasant surroundings out
side, hasto have a lot to recommend it for break
fast-hungry people to be willing to come up from
this area fora visit. It's about a 15-minute drive up
Highway 101 (don't plan on just going along for
the ride), or a slightly more arduous trip on Sam-
Trans for those who scorn the automobile.
If you're any kind of an omelette connoisseur
(we do exist), this restaurant is worth the trip, es
pecially if you're looking for any kind of excuse to
get out of Palo Alto (who isn't during Dead
Week?). The food is excellent, and both the selec
tion and the quality are a notch above just about
any offerings in closer proximity to Stanford. On
the other hand, it's probably not that much better,
and a lot of people are most likely not enthralled

enough about breakfast, to begin with, for the
journey to be worth their time.
We tried the "Russe," a delicious combination
of sauteed potatoes, bacon, scallions, sour cream
and chives. We also tried the Spanish, a combina
tion of celery, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions and
"secrets," according to the menu. This was still
good, but the mixture wound up slightly soggy.
Omelettes at The Omelette House are cooked
in a manner different from the way that most pre
pare them. Most chefs add the ingredients shortly
after the eggs begin to cook in the pan, while
here, the eggs are cooked in a pan separate from
the rest of the ingredients, which are folded in
only at the end, just before the dish is served. The
taste is different — the separate flavors stand out
more.
Highlights of The Omelette House are the ex
tras that go along with the meal. These include
banana nut bread, excellent French Bread, a side
of mushroom sauce or white cream sauce and a
lot of freshly ground hot coffee.
Also, between now and the new year, there's a
comlimentary glass of Buck's Fizz (champagne
and orange juice) served with every meal.
The prices are reasonable, ranging from a lowly
$3 fora plain or $3.50 (you guessed it, that's for the
peanut butter and jelly) to $6.50 fora special LI
DO-IT self-designed entree or $7 fora crab- or
shrimp-filled delicacy.
The atmosphere of the place is extremely
friendly, and certainly unpretentious. There's
clearly a local clientele, and on the day we were
there, a lot of people were crowded around a tel
evison set watching the 49ers smash the Bengals.
The service, if anything, was too prompt, but that's
only because we went on a leisurely Sunday morn
ing; if you ever have to go here and eat fast, you'll
undoubtedly appreciate the melange of good
food and quick service.
The restaurant seems small when viewed from
the front entrance, but can still hold about 70 peo
ple indoors. (The initial appearance hides a lot of

iho bark and a patio which, when open in warmer
months, holds about 60 people.) The decor is hardly
more than one would find at any local coffee shop

across the country. If you like local coffee shops,
you'll like this place, but if they're not classy enough
for vou, you may not feel satisified no matter how
good the food is.
