Trudeau's victory not all roses
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau enjoyed the applause of the Liberal caucus
of the House of Commons last week after the passage of his proposals for patriating
the Canadian Constitution from Britain. However, in Quebec, the Parti Quebecois
adopted a new hard line in a meeting Sunday which threatens to push fora referen
dum on independence for the province possibly by next year. At the same time,
Party leader Rene Levesque threatened to resign, saying that without a previous ec
onomic agreement with the rest of Canada, any independence attempt is bound to
failure.
