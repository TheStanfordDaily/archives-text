# Shrimp to eel...and raw fish

wooden bowls, complete with covers, but
without spoons, as it is customary to sip directly
from the bowls. Both soups were clear, subtle
and yet bursting with flavor.
Our next course might not be for everyone,
hut for those of you who are willing to try some
thing slightly different, Sushi is an exquisite taste
experience. Raw fish, lying on a small ball of sea
soned rice, might sound unappetizing, but
please give it a try. The Deluxe Nigiri Sushi
($7.75), a combination of Fukisushi's best, in
cludes an interesting selection of seafood rang
ing from shrimp, through tuna and mackerel, to
the slightly more exotic giant clam and sea
urchin. All were either good or very good, the
contrast of flavors and textures wonderful, and
the presentation beautiful.
To accompany this combination, we tried the
Futo Maki ($4.25), egg, eel, mashed shrimp and
mushroom, all rolled with seasoned rice in
seaweed. Not only was it excellent, but volumi
nous as well.
Finally the main course. We could have
chosen from a selection of standard fare such as
Teriyaki chicken or beef, or the more unusual
like Chanko Nabe Sumo Wrestler's seafood and
vegetables, or Udon Suki, Japanese noodles with
seafood in a special sauce, but we decided on
the middle eround, Sukiyaki ($7.75). Although

this dish is usually prepared at the table, at
Fukisushi this is not the case; but they make up
for it as much as possible by serving it in a large
cast iron pot still sizzling from the stove. The
contents were excellent — a combination of
sliced beef, assorted vegetables, bamboo
shoots, vam noodles and Tofu, all simmered in a
special soy-based sauce. The vegetables were all
cooked to perfection, the noodles suitably slip
pery, and the sauce, almost drinkable as soup,
was even better when soaked up by the rice.
Only the beef, which was somewhat fatty, left
anv room at all for improvement. The portion
was huse, and included in the price was a salad,
simple but with a slighly sweet and very tasty
dressing, and the Misoshiru soup, which I de
scribed above.
Accompanying the meal we enjoyed the tradi
tional green tea, and Sake (warmed Japanese
rice wine). The service was adequate: friendly
but overly rushed and haphazard. My only real
complaint was the cigarette smoke drifting over
from adjacent tables, but due to the limited
space I suppose it can't be helped. Still the meal
was delicious and the value-for-money ex
cellent. Whether you are an afficionado of
Japanese food or still a novice, Fukisushi should
be high on your list of restaurants to visit in this
area.
