The Wizard of Oz****
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
The Wizard nf Oz may be the
most familiar movie ever made —
becaifce of its repeated airings on
television, there's virtually no
one who doesn't know it by
heart. But seeing it on the large
screen, as it was meant to be seen,
is a revelation: it's simultaneously
much stagieid(the sets are more
obviously set*) and much prettier
than it looks on TV. This is a mu
sicfcbox of a movie, tuneful, beau
tifully crafted, and fun to watch.
ludy Garland, Ray Bolger, lack
Haley, Bert Lahr, dozens of very
short people and a woman with
green skin and a nasty personality
are featured. Victor Fleming
directed for MCM.

The Return of the Secaucus
Seven ****
Fox, Redwood City
~-jA triumph. John Savfes wrote,
acted in, edited, produced and
directed this story about seven
Tongtimtj triends who get togeth
er for a'weekend vacation in the
Return of the
Secaitcus Seven is warm, funny,
human and humane: all fehethar
atters are rounded and believ
able to an extent that makes most
oth#r recent movies seem like
collections of cardboard cutouts.
Savles' script is terrific — it is fun
ny and insightful about the
strengths and weaknesses of
these people without ever being
cdiel.
And perhaps most incredibly
ofafi, Savles accomplished all this
on a budget of $60,000. (That's
not a typo. Secaucus Seven cost
less than one-five hundredth of a
movie like Superman II.) This was
accomplished by cutting corners
nearly everywhere — on the loca
tions, on the sets, on the actors'
salaries — except on the integrity
of the movie.
Plavs tonight only with A Small
Circle nf Friends.

5.0.8. *
Mountain View Ttieater
I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie bv turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the
only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston asa
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill
ing to give up any method of
making life more comfortable.
_ Double-billed with Rich and
Anions.

Life of Brian **
Fox, Redwood City
Sort of lik «> Gospel I with dirty
jokes Several brilliant sketches
«tre |rw in the drivel: it's all funny,
but it goes on for much too long.
The Monty Python troupe takes
aim at Biblical epics, terrorist
logistics, and the PLO; while they
don't alwavsfahfi*' in form
even a string nrbullseyes would
be boring. A Pvthonmovie needs
a better plot than the Bible can
provide.
Plays tomorrow and Friday
with another Python movie,
Montv Python and the Holy Grail.

Arthur ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
' more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, playsa wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
heing an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, i*between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's qffscfreen.

True Confessions***
Old Mill, Mountain View
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing,and the relationship be
tween the two brothers. Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a verv
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring vou to tears, despite its
weaknesses.
— Steve Vineberg
Bread and Chocolate***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A bittersweet, funny comedy
about an Italian immigrant who is
battered by the system when he
tries to find his dreams in Switzer
land's promised land. The movie
has a compassion and warmth to
it that makes it eminently watch
able. Nino Manfredi, as the immi
grant, has one of those faces that
can make anything seem either
funny or tragic. Anna Karina is
fine as an immigrant from
Greece. Franco Brusati directed.
Plavs tomorrow and Friday
with Cafe Express.

Beauty and the Beast#iiir*
Festival Cinema, Palo AWo
Jean Cocteau wrote and
directed this version of the great
fairy tale, and it is lovely. The look
of the film is consciously styled af
ter Vermeer paintings, but the
tone, with its curious, exhilarat
ing blend of realits and fantasy, 1$
uniquely Cocteau's.
The Beast inhabits an
enormous palace where ev
erything is enchanted: the
candles are held aloft by human
•(lands and the walls quite literally
$w>ave ears. Nothing is quite as it
* seems—Cocteau's reinterpreta
tion of the real world is haunting
lv beautiful. Josette Day has been
perfectly typecast as Beauty, and
lean Marais, wearing magnif
icent, amazingly expressive
makeup is her Beast.
Plays tonight only with The
Wanderer.

Raiders of the Lost Ark**
Palo Alto Square
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the'3os and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the T/
serials and comics of the '50s. ft
represents the ceytobined efforts
qfe some of the s»nost gifted
craftsmen in Hofmvood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Bodv Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
tojall'those good vibrations: I
didn't jlare for the movie very
mura Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hvpe about its adolescent
bovs' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

I Confess **'i
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock directed this
Aama about a Canadian priest
whose life is endangered when
he refuses to police what
told to hiiff
Vlontgomerv Hm plays the
piiest, and he, like the movie, is
sometimes marvelous and some
times rather stiff. It might be that
the actor's stvle and the director's
stvle were simply incompatible:
they ended up cancelling each
other out. Hitchcock himself
criticized the film for being hu
morless, and it's a valid complaint

®roe movie offers none of the
characteristic Hitchcock irony,
and it therefore feels a little flat.
You can nevertheless see whatat
tracted him to the story itself, The
priest finds himself in the
archetypal Hitchcock situation of
knowing much more than he can
safely reveal without jeopardiz
ing what he believes in
Starts tomorrow with one of
Hitchfock's British films, The Se
cret Agent.

Tho French Lieutenant's
Woman ★★★
Guild, Menlo Park
lohn Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (feremy Irons) and Anna
(Mervl Streep) carry on an affair
dining the filming of The French
I initpna'nl's Woman. Thecharac-
in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a hit chillv. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Cutter's Way ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ivan Passer directed this
dreamy — almost hallucinatory
— story of a man who, convinced
that that he has discovered cor
ruption in high places, drags his
friends through an increasingly
unsettling chase. The movie's im
agery is often beautiful — the
credits themselves, which show a
Southern Californian parade in
slow motion set to somber music,
are breathtakingly executed. The
script, unfortunately, isn't so hot:
it doesn't wind itself up into the
tense, fatalistic ball you sense
Passer wants it to become, and
the dialogue is sometimes oddly
stilted, as if the actors got hold of
the first draft of the screenplay in
stead (of the more polished re
visions.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Horn to Win.
