# Brazil faces 'closed' elections
## 
### Washington Post 
Rio de Janeiro — Dimming
hopes fora return to de
mocracy in Brazil, President
Joao Baptista Figueiredo has
sent to Congress a set of restric
tive election laws that virtually
guarantees uninterrupted rule
bv the present military-tech
nocratic alliance through the
end of the decade.
Last week he also canceled
part of Congress' upcoming
summer break fora special ses
sion to act on the election
package. The congressional
session, which is to last through
Jan. 15, is the first called by the
executive in 13 years.
Figueiredo, the latest of five
army generals to rule since the
1964 military coup, repeatedly
has vowed "to make this coun
try a democracy." Since he
took office in 1979, his abetura,
or liberalization program, has
received widespread interna
tional acclaim as a showcase at
tempt to guide a Latin Ameri
can military dictatorship back
to c ivilian rule.
But the long-awaited elec
tion rules unveiled last week
are written so as to ensure a
government party victory at
the polls next November.
No opposition
As a measure of the sudden
reversal, forecasters who last
month predicted Brazil's op
position pa rties would win
governorship races in 18 of the
22 states now say the official So
ci.il Democratic Party will
sweep at least 17 of the state

races.
Ulvsses Guimaraes, a mem
ber of Congress and president
of the leading oppositionparty,
the Brazilian Democratic
Movement, said, "This is a new
Pearl Harbor."
The official statement of the
moderate Popular Party, the
second-place opposition
force, read, "We are facing the
collapse of the electoral proc
ess. What is planned here is. . .
nothing less than the strangling
of the opposition parties."
"It demystifies the farce of the
ahetura ," commented Luis Ig
nacio da Silva, Brazil's most
popular labor leader and presi
dent of the Workers' Party. Last
month, a military court sen

tenced da Silva to seven years
in jail for leading an "illegal"
auto workers' strike. He cur
rently is free while the convic
tion is being appealed.
The new bill prohibits coali
tions among the five opposi
tion parties and requires man
datory straight-ticket voting.
Under the new bill, by voting
fora favorite candidate for city
council an elector will also au
tomatically vote for state depu
ty, federal deputy, federal sen
ator, and governor — all on the
same party slate. Not by coin
cidence, the government par
ty's strength is concentrated at
the local level — with 75 per
cent of the mayors and 87 per
cent of the city council.
