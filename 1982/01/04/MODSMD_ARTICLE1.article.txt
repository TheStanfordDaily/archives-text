He had 25 early last month and said
he expected 50, but by the Dec. 15
deadline, courier, carrier and Federal
Express brought Andy Barnes 73
$10,000 checks â€” the initial fee for
use of the gene splicing patent jointly
owned by Stanford and UC-San Fran
cisco.
Barnes is coordinator of
biotechnology licensing here.
The money came to him at the Of
fice of Technology and Licensing
from 73 genetic engineering com
panies from around the world. They
will use the process invented by Dr.
Stanley Cohen, professor of genetics
and medicine here, and Dr. Herbert
Boyer of UCSF in the development of
products such as insulin, interferon
and oil-eating microorganisms.
Although Barnes said he was
"mildly surprised" at the turnout, he
said he had expected the last-minute
rush to sign up with the University in
time to receive a special credit on
future royalties. "If you have a bill to
pay, you don't pay it early, do you?"
he said.
The signers included familiar
names such as Corning, Johnson &
Johnson, Nabisco, Revlon and Tex
aco as well as newcomers such as Ad
vanced Genetic Sciences and Vir
ogenetics.
The firms will pay an additional
$10,000 yearly, as well as royalties
ranging from Vi to 1 percent of net
sales of any product which is manu
factured using the technique. The
first annual payment is due Feb. 1.
The University will receive 15 per
cent of the total for administering the
program, and the rest of the money
will be split evenly between Stanford
and UCSF.
Here, Barnes explained, the funds
will be distributed according to the
University's standard policy for royal
ties. One-third of the money goes to
