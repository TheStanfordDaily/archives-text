# 73 companies sign up for splicing patent

### Julie Kaufmann 
He had 25 early last month and said
he expected 50, but by the Dec. 15
deadline, courier, carrier and Federal
Express brought Andy Barnes 73
$10,000 checks — the initial fee for
use of the gene splicing patent jointly
owned by Stanford and UC-San Fran
cisco.
Barnes is coordinator of
biotechnology licensing here.
The money came to him at the Of
fice of Technology and Licensing
from 73 genetic engineering com
panies from around the world. They
will use the process invented by Dr.
Stanley Cohen, professor of genetics
and medicine here, and Dr. Herbert
Boyer of UCSF in the development of
products such as insulin, interferon
and oil-eating microorganisms.
Although Barnes said he was
"mildly surprised" at the turnout, he
said he had expected the last-minute
rush to sign up with the University in
time to receive a special credit on
future royalties. "If you have a bill to
pay, you don't pay it early, do you?"
he said.
The signers included familiar
names such as Corning, Johnson &
Johnson, Nabisco, Revlon and Tex
aco as well as newcomers such as Ad
vanced Genetic Sciences and Vir
ogenetics.
The firms will pay an additional
$10,000 yearly, as well as royalties
ranging from Vi to 1 percent of net
sales of any product which is manu
factured using the technique. The
first annual payment is due Feb. 1.
The University will receive 15 per
cent of the total for administering the
program, and the rest of the money
will be split evenly between Stanford
and UCSF.
Here, Barnes explained, the funds
will be distributed according to the
University's standard policy for royal
ties. One-third of the money goes to
the inventor's school, in this case, the
School of Medicine. The inventor's
department receives the second
third — Cohen's joint appointment
means that the departments of medi
cine and genetics will divide the
money.
The final third usually goes directly
to the inventor, said Barnes. Cohen
and Boyer have both waived their
rights to personal royalties, however.
Cohen has stipulated that hisshareof
the money be used for Medical
School fellowships.
The University earlier reported
that 71 firms, 53 American and 18 for
eign companies, had made the early
deadline, but Barnes told the Daily
yesterday that two more companies
whose representatives had gotten
lost on campus were later included in
the total. "They were on campus by
the deadline, but just not in our of
fice," he said.
Barnes said he could not re

member the names of the two firms.
Companies which signed by Dec.
15 will deduct from royalty payments
five times the amount of fees already
paid.
For example, a company which
signed up and then took three years
to develop a marketable product
would deduct $200,000, or five times
$40,000 ($lO,OOO yearly plus the initial
$10,000 fee), from royalties due Stan
ford and UCSF. The credit is limited
to 50 percent of annual royalties.
Although Barnes said "it's hard to
predict what the revenues could be
in the future," this fiscal year the pat
ent will earn more money for the
University than all other patents
combined.
New methods and techniques that
could be used as alternatives to the
Cohen/Boyer process would
diminish the patent's profitability,
but "there is nothing around now,"
he said.
