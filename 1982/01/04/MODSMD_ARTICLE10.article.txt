## Ethiopia pacifies troubled area by military and economic means 
### Washington Post 
Asmara, Ethiopia — When asked wheth
er the Ethiopian government is attempting
to gain support from Eritreans or simply a
military victory over them, an Eritrean here
said, "That's a very delicate question you
are asking," and walked briskly away from
the reporter.
The answer to the question is likely to
determine whether there is a chance to
end soon the two-decade Eritrean inde
pendence war that drains Ethiopia, one of
the world's poorest nations, and its peo
ple.
A four-day visit last month to Ethiopia's
northern province of Eritrea, where
Africa's longest war has been raging since
the former Italian colony was incorporated
into Ethiopia in 1962, provided evidence
that the military government is on a two
track approach, seeking both military and
peaceful solutions.
Two huge truck convoys rolling in op
posite directions on the same day il
lustrated the dual efforts to pacify these
largely Moslem people whose independ
ence drive has exacerbated Ethiopia's rela
tions with its Arab neighbors.
About 100 trucks carrying goods toward
Addis Ababa were on the highway headed
south out of the Eritrean capital one morn
ing last month. Although the convoy
passed through numerous military check
points, there was no military escort.
Three years ago such a scene would have
been impossible. Asmara was under siege
and supplies had to be flown in at con
siderable risk since Eritrean guerrillas were
entrenched just three miles from the air
port and their rockets occasionally strafed
the landing strip.
The presence of such a large convoy is
evidence that the government has been
successful in restoring stability and com
merce to major areas of the countryside.
Peace nearing
Peace is also returning to much of the
area: thousands of guerrillas have taken
advantage of an amnesty, refugees are re
turning from Sudan, curfews have been re

laxed and the government goes to great
lengths to demonstrate that the people are
living normal lives.
On the way back up the Rift Valley es
carpment in the afternoon, however, a
massive military convoy rolled toward
Asmara. The "cargo" was several thousand
troops, armed with rifles, machine guns
and artillery pieces.

It is expected that the
Ethiopian Army — the
largest in black Africa
with approximately
250,000 troops plus a
large militia — may well
launch another offensive.

Diplomats in Addis Abada speculated
that thiswaspartof Ethiopia's 21st Division.
The division's 10,000 to 12,000 troops had
recently been sent from the Addis Ababa
area to Tigre Province, south of Eritrea,
where other civil strife is under way. Hav
ing cleaned up some dissident activity in
Tigre, the troops were now moving into
Eritrea, reportedly to launch another of
fensive against the Eritrean guerrillas in
their last sronghold at Nakfa, a mountain
redoubt 150 miles north of Asmara.
Nakfa is the only major town still con
trolled by the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front. At their high-water mark in 1978 the
front and another group, the Eritrean Lib
eration Front, controlled most of the re
gion except for the cities of Asmara and
Massawa.
Guerillas feud
The guerrillas missed the opportunity to
gain control in 1978 when the two or
ganizations clashed, giving the Ethiopians
time to win a war against Somalia in the
south with Soviet and Cuban support and
then regroup and drive the Eritrean forces

out of their strongholds.
The last Ethiopian attempt to retake
Nakfa two years ago was a disaster with
thousands of soldiers killed. Since then,
however, fighting between the guerrilla
groups has escalated and most of the ELF
loyalists are believed to have retreated into
Sudan. The more radical EPLF is estimated
to have about 10,OOOguerrillas under arms,
about half its 1978 strength.
The approach of Chairman Mengistu
Haile-Mariam, leader of the military gov
ernment, a Western diplomat said, "is still
that of the ancient Ethiopian emperors —
you settle your problems militarily."
Thus, it is expected that the Ethiopian
Army — the largest in black Africa with ap
proximately 250,000 troops plus a large
militia — may well launch another of
fensive.
One indication that Mengistu is pursu
ing the military route is a recent fraying of
relations with Sudan, whose cooperation is
needed to bring about a negotiated settle
ment. There are about 400,000 Ethiopian
refugees in Sudan, and the country had
been used as a rear base by the guerrillas
until an exchange of visits between
Mengistu and Sudanese President Jaafar
Nimeri in 1980 and 1981.
Last August, however, Ethiopia made an
alliance with Libya, Sudan's arch enemy.
Since then Ethiopian-Sudanese ties have
taken a turn for the worse.
Ethiopia called in the Sudanese charge
d'affaires in Addis Ababa and publicly
complained about U.S. military maneuvers
in Sudan. Foreign Minister Feleke Wolde-
Giorgis played down in an interview the
need for cooperation with Sudan, saying
that only Ethiopians could solve the
Eritrean problem.
Sudanese officials say they want to main
tain the old rapprochement but it is up to
Ethiopia to show reciprocity.
In such circumstances, there has been
no visible movement toward negotiations,
but the government's longstanding am
nesty offer to the guerrillas has finally reg
istered some success.
