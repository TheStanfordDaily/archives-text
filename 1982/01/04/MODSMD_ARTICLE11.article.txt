# Goenka fights Indian state corruption
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bombay, India — Relaxing in
his sparsely furnished pen
thouse, 25 stories up and over
looking the Arabian Sea, In
dia's best-known newspaper
baron showed little sign of
strain from his latest battle. But
there was no reason why he
should.
In 50 years of building the
combative Indian Express into
India's largest, most con
troversial English-languagedai
ly, confrontation has become
routine for Ram Nath Goenka.
The current fight, a labor dis
pute that according to Goenka
was triggered by political ene
mies, threatens the existence
of his influential Bombay edi
tion, the largest of 10 published
in different cities. Combined
circulation is about 600,000.
Like earlier clashes, this one
grew out of an expose of politi

cal corruption.
"Temporarily, they may suc
ceed in quelling a dissenting
voice," he said of his Bombay
political foes, "but ultimately
they must lose, because truth
will prevail."
India's press is not censored,
but most owners, afraid of ruffl
ing official feathers and harm
ing their wider business in
terests, impose constraints that
make the press look generally
timid. But Goenka has only mi
nor business interests.
Goenka has made many ene
mies in high place, including in
the government. His in
vestigative reports focus on of
ficial corruption or malad
ministration, and for much of
the past decade a primary
target has been Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi and some of the
people around her.

Last September, for example,
in a scandal that captured na
tional attention, the paper re
ported that the chief minister
of Maharashtra state, which in
cludes Bombay, was extorting
funds from local industry and
business as the price for neces
sary government permits and
scarce state-controlled com
modities.
The state official, Abdul An
tulay, who is a member of the
prime minister's Congress Par
ty, did not deny the charge. In
stead, he defended the action,
saying that the money was not
for his personal use. He said he
had put the money into trusts
he had formed to help the poor
and the unemployed.
Another article, after an in
criminating picture showing
Indira Gandhi approving one
of these funds, the paper's ex
ecutive editor and most relent

less investigator, Arun Shourie,
challenged the finance min
ister to take action against the
paper.
"I have used the word 'lies'
to describe a bit of what you
said," Shourie wrote. "What do
you and your friends propose
to do ... haul me up for
breaching your privileges as an
MP (member of Parliament)?"
Nothing was done.
Shourie is a former World
Bank economist who joined
the Express three years ago.
In the past few years, the pa -
per's reporters working under
Shourie's direction has helped
uncover police torture in Bihar
state, widespread trafficking in
women in central India and the
plight of thousands of people
who have spent much of their
lives in jail awaiting trial, often
for petty offenses.
