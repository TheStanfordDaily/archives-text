## Editor's Viewpoint Anticipation of a New Year 
### 
Happy New Year — and welcome back to
Stanford! The unusual near-desolation which
the University experienced this weekend, as at
Christmastime, is slowly giving way to a new
quarter's activity here, as students move back in
and staff return to their jobs: the University is
resuming its normal pace . . .
The Daily, at the same time, is resuming its
normal pace of operation after nearly a month's
respite. For many of us on the staff, including
myself, the time off and away has provided the
perspective to evaluate the fall's progress.
In the midst of a wonderful blur of family,
friends and snow back East, I took some time to
read the Daily — the49 regular issuesof the
volume so far, as well as our Orientation issue
and sports magazines. I read them carefully,
more carefully than I was able to read many of
them the day they came out, and certainly more
carefully than I wind up reading most
newspapers.
When I was able, as best I could, to separate
the individual issues from the memoriesof the
various events and crises surrounding their
publication, I was struck by the twin emotions
which I described in a column at the very
beginning of this volume — inspiration and
disillusionment.
In that column, I described my sense of all that
a newspaper can be — "a source of information,
a collage of images and a storehouse of
thoughts," as well as "a medium of exchange for
human beings."
That's idealistic, as I admitted when I wrote it.
Producing that kind of product all the time —
without eithereditorial or aesthetic mistakes —
is the stuff of which editors' dreams are made.
The disillusionment sets in when those mistakes
— both omissions and commissions — are
made.
Reading the Daily, I saw strings of both
achievement and failure.
A lot of people put a lot of effort into our

product this fall, and I feel that their work was
evident much of the time — in well-writ ten
stories, balanced pages, good photographs, and
more generally in issues which gave that sense
of what was going on here at the time. The
opposite was also true — mistakes, missed
stories, imbalanced coverage, less-than-great
layouts and the like. There were things which we
as a staff, and I as editor, would probably do
differently if we had it all to do again. If itwere
otherwise, we would almost surely be failing to
learn from our experience here.
What we try to do here is present information
as accurately as we can, analyzing it where
appropriate, but in the main leaving
interpretation, judgment and advocacy up to
the readers. Whatever personal views we who
work here hold, I think most of us believe that
our responsibility is to let the facts speak for
themselves. Truth does not and should not need
to be propped up by our own subjectivity, but
our job is hardly defined by that simple maxim,
for no two people here at Stanford, or indeed in
the world, have ever been able exactly to agree
on what truth is.
In the remaining month of Volume 180, and
through the rest of the school year when the
Da/Vy will be led by incoming editor Joan
O'Connell, we will continue to work hard to
increase the ratio of ups to downs, successes to
failures, quality to banality.
I plan to provide another opportunity for the
public to express their views to Daily editors in
an open forum, and I also continue to
encourage your direct comments to us. As I also
said at the beginning of this volume, it is not just
for the sake of the Da//y that communication
between us and our readers should be as open
as possible — the University itself will be better
for the exchange.
