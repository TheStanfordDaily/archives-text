## Callister decision: does statist ruling spell end of an ERA? 
### 
Found in the obituary column: On
Wednesday, Dec. 23, 1981, an
amendment was pronounced dead
on appeal in a Boise, Idaho
courtroom. The amendment, known
as ERA, was the veteran of 35 suc
cessful state ratification fights. U.S.
District Judge Marion Callister is
being held for questioning.
Thus ended the checkered career
of the ERA, beloved by supporters
and beleaguered by opponents.
Passed by Congress in 1972, these
three sentences created a decade of
controversy:
Equality of rights under the law
shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any state on
account of sex. Congress shall have
the power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this arti
cle. This amendment shall take effect
two years after the date of ratifi
cation.
Three-fourths (or 38) of state legis
latures must ratify an amendment to
make it a part of the Constitution. In
diana was the 35th state to pass the
proposed amendment in 1977. Since

then, the movement for ratification
has resembled the fabled Sisyphus —
snatching defeat from the jaws of vic
tory. Callister's decision threatens to
catapult the ERA to the bottom of the
ratification mountain.
Callister's ruling responded to a
suit filed by the states of Idaho and
Arizona challenging the authority of
Congress over the amendment pro
cedure. In 1978, Congress voted to
extend the ratification deadline for
what would be the 27th amendment
from March 1979 to June 1982. Con
gress also voted to deny recognition
to the actions of the five states — Ida
ho, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Da
kota and Nebraska — that had rati
fied the amendment and several
years later voted to rescind ratifi
cation. Essentially, Callister ruled
Congress' actions unconstitutional,
supporting the states right to rescind
and denying extension.
The Callister decision, under ap
peal by the National Organization of
Women, purports to define con
gressional authority over the amend
ment procedure. Callister adamantly

defends his states' rights position,
stating that Congress has no power to
determine "the validity or invalidity
of a properly certified ratification or
recission." He favors a decentraliza
tion of constitutional authority.
It is interesting to note that Con
gress has never before accepted
rescissions of a ratification vote.
Furthermore, the fifth article of the
Constitution, which delineates the
method by which amendments are
proposed and adopted, says only that
"no State, without its consent, shall
be deprived of its equal suffrage in
the Senate."
The authors of the Constitution
were intentionally ambiguous in
their language. They wanted a docu

ment that could mold as times
changed, a document whose power
rested on interpretation. With the
advent of judicial review, the battle
ground for interpretive change be
came the courtroom. In this tussle
over constitutional authority, the Su
preme Court will ultimately have the
final say. Should the Court uphold
Callister's ruling, only 33 states will
have ratified the amendment and the
time allotted for ratification will have
run out.
The validity of the Equal Rights
Amendment is debatable. Oppo
nents believe it will rend asunder the
nuclear family and force women to
register for the draft. Supporters see
it as a formal equalization of the sexes

and as a tool for reformative liti
gation.
Strictly speaking, there is no con
stitutional need for the amendment.
The rights it guarantees are included
in the first section of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which says: "No State
shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or im
munities of citizens of the United
States; nor shall any State deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law; nor deny
to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws."
The"due process" and "equal pro
tection" clauses have provisions
which safeguard civil liberties and
equality of legal protection regard
less of race, creed, color or sex.
The Equal Rights Amendment's ef
fect would be largely symbolic.
While it might smooth the litigation
process, the amendment applies to
an area that is not lacking in constitu
tional protection. ERA'S passage
would not destroy America's moral
fiber as its opponents claim, nor,
however, would it end sex dis

crimination in one fell swoop.
Law is merely a reflection of socie
tal values. It can be effective only
when society as a whole chooses to
enforce it. The ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment, then, is
not needed for the eradication of
sexual discrimination.
The real danger of the Callister de
cision, however, lies in its decen
tralization of the amendment pro
cedure. Congress should have
absolute authority over the method
by which constitutional amendments
are adopted. The Constitution, by
definition, enumerates of federal
powers, not states' rights. The de
cision assumes that a retroactive con
trol over the ratification procedure is
justified. A vote, once cast, must be
legally binding in order for a repre
sentative democracy such as ours to
function properly. The Callister de
cision, as it stands, threatens to
emasculate the necessary federal
control of constitutional authority.

cedure. Congress should have
absolute authority over the method
by which constitutional amendments
are adopted. The Constitution, by
definition, enumerates of federal
powers, not states' rights. The de
cision assumes that a retroactive con
trol over the ratification procedure is
justified. A vote, once cast, must be
legally binding in order for a repre
sentative democracy such as ours to
function properly. The Callister de
cision, as it stands, threatens to
emasculate the necessary federal
control of constitutional authority.

Found in the obituary column: On
Wednesday, Dec. 23, 1981, an
amendment was pronounced dead
on appeal in a Boise, Idaho
courtroom. The amendment, known
as ERA, was the veteran of 35 suc
cessful state ratification fights. U.S.
District Judge Marion Callister is
being held for questioning.
Thus ended the checkered career
of the ERA, beloved by supporters
and beleaguered by opponents.
Passed by Congress in 1972, these
three sentences created a decade of
controversy:
Equality of rights under the law
shall not be denied or abridged by
the United States or by any state on
account of sex. Congress shall have
the power to enforce, by appropriate
legislation, the provisions of this arti
cle. This amendment shall take effect
two years after the date of ratifi
cation.
Three-fourths (or 38) of state legis
latures must ratify an amendment to
make it a part of the Constitution. In
diana was the 35th state to pass the
proposed amendment in 1977. Since

then, the movement for ratification
has resembled the fabled Sisyphus —
snatching defeat from the jaws of vic
tory. Callister's decision threatens to
catapult the ERA to the bottom of the
ratification mountain.
Callister's ruling responded to a
suit filed by the states of Idaho and
Arizona challenging the authority of
Congress over the amendment pro
cedure. In 1978, Congress voted to
extend the ratification deadline for
what would be the 27th amendment
from March 1979 to June 1982. Con
gress also voted to deny recognition
to the actions of the five states — Ida
ho, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Da
kota and Nebraska — that had rati
fied the amendment and several
years later voted to rescind ratifi
cation. Essentially, Callister ruled
Congress' actions unconstitutional,
supporting the states right to rescind
and denying extension.
The Callister decision, under ap
peal by the National Organization of
Women, purports to define con
gressional authority over the amend
ment procedure. Callister adamantly

defends his states' rights position,
stating that Congress has no power to
determine "the validity or invalidity
of a properly certified ratification or
recission." He favors a decentraliza
tion of constitutional authority.
It is interesting to note that Con
gress has never before accepted
rescissions of a ratification vote.
Furthermore, the fifth article of the
Constitution, which delineates the
method by which amendments are
proposed and adopted, says only that
"no State, without its consent, shall
be deprived of its equal suffrage in
the Senate."
The authors of the Constitution
were intentionally ambiguous in
their language. They wanted a docu

ment that could mold as times
changed, a document whose power
rested on interpretation. With the
advent of judicial review, the battle
ground for interpretive change be
came the courtroom. In this tussle
over constitutional authority, the Su
preme Court will ultimately have the
final say. Should the Court uphold
Callister's ruling, only 33 states will
have ratified the amendment and the
time allotted for ratification will have
run out.
The validity of the Equal Rights
Amendment is debatable. Oppo
nents believe it will rend asunder the
nuclear family and force women to
register for the draft. Supporters see
it as a formal equalization of the sexes

and as a tool for reformative liti
gation.
Strictly speaking, there is no con
stitutional need for the amendment.
The rights it guarantees are included
in the first section of the Fourteenth
Amendment, which says: "No State
shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or im
munities of citizens of the United
States; nor shall any State deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law; nor deny
to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws."
The"due process" and "equal pro
tection" clauses have provisions
which safeguard civil liberties and
equality of legal protection regard
less of race, creed, color or sex.
The Equal Rights Amendment's ef
fect would be largely symbolic.
While it might smooth the litigation
process, the amendment applies to
an area that is not lacking in constitu
tional protection. ERA'S passage
would not destroy America's moral
fiber as its opponents claim, nor,
however, would it end sex dis

crimination in one fell swoop.
Law is merely a reflection of socie
tal values. It can be effective only
when society as a whole chooses to
enforce it. The ratification of the
Equal Rights Amendment, then, is
not needed for the eradication of
sexual discrimination.
The real danger of the Callister de
cision, however, lies in its decen
tralization of the amendment pro
cedure. Congress should have
absolute authority over the method
by which constitutional amendments
are adopted. The Constitution, by
