Almost a foot of snow fell on the Hamilton Range mountains across the Bay this past weekend, mak
ing for this view from Sand Hill Road. An Alaskan storm deposited snow as low as the 400 ft. level,
and pelted other Bay Area residents with rain and hail. According to the MMU*nal Weather Service,
the storm brought the heaviest snowfall the Bay Area has had since 1977.
