## ASSU financing plans: incorrect and invalid 
### 
The arguments which ASSU of
ficials present regarding ASSU-Uni
versity financing agreements (Daily,
Dec. 4) should be regarded by stu
dents as historically incorrect, legally
invalid and politically outrageous.
First, the ASSU Constitution, as le
gally modified by the 1970 Letter of
Acceptance of then-University Presi
dent Kenneth Pitzer, states only that
1.) the University and ASSU shall ne
gotiate "on a not more than biannual
basis" and 2.) "the funds in this (op
erating budget allowance) are to be
used for the normal operating ex
penses of the Association, including
the financial, legislation and ex
ecutive function ... " (Emphasis
added.)
It's obvious that the University only
limited how its (i.e., student-fi
nanced) funds could be spent by
ASSU, rather than guaranteeing the
perpetual, blank check funding of
any ASSU operation and personnel.
The interpretation of Associate Dean
of Student Affairs Thomas Massey is
the correct one.
This reasoning is in part due to the
ASSU's clever understatement of
University support for its 1970-71 op
erating budget, which caused the
University to make payment to cover
this deficit. But as Pitzer made clear,
this sort of financing should not be
expected in the future.
The comments of Council of Presi
dents member Chris Greene also de
serve some scrutiny. ASSU Special
Events only made a profit in 1976 (not

in 1975) and cost the ASSU about
$300,000 before ASSU officials finally
buried it last year. As for any claim
that ASSU Travel Service also made
money, some of us remember Travel
Service's practice of always booking
with one airline, which during the
Christmas 1975 United Airlines strike
cause horrible problems for students
and losses for ASSU. Airline de
regulation is not the only reason why
Travel Service went down the tubes.
More to the point, students should
refuse to be played as suckers, just
like other California residents. After
the state (ASSU) spent years amassing
a huge surplus (about $400,000), state
officials (ASSU executives) threaten
more taxation (fee assessments)
when economic reality catches up to
them, and demand that the federal
government (University) cough up
more money which in turn causes the
feds to warn of higher taxation (tui
tion).
Before students feel responsible
for this mess or cave in to "scare" tac
tics, they should demand that ASSU
officials draw up sensible budgets,
stop whining for University subsidies,
and make sacrifices themselves. After
all, the four COP members, the ASSU
Senate Chair and the ASSU Financial
Manager together receive combined
salaries in excess of $15,000, and all
enjoy the privilege of paying half-tui
tion for taking half-unit quarters.
