## Aid-for-poor law program pushed 
### 
Washington — Presidential coun
selor Edwin Meese has been quietly
traveling the country this fall, en
couraging third-year law students to
help fill the void created by federal
cutbacks in legal aid to the poor.
Despite Meese's vocational back
ground, the former Alameda County
district attorney isn't one we'd ex
pect to see carrying the banner for
the goals and aims of the Legal Ser
vices Corp., much less inciting young
professionals to volunteer their time.
But Meese sounds serious.
"As a professor I know how third
year law students become particular
ly bored with the standard cur
riculum of the law school," Meese
recently told law students at UC-
Berkeley. "A great deal of the legal
problem of the poor could be han
dled by . . . third-year law students or
beginning lawyers who have not yet
established an extensive practice."
Meese contends the legal volun
teerism could "expand the available
resources to the poor a hundredfold
or a thousandfold ..."
Of course, such hyperbole may be
the product of years of wishful think
ing. "To propose that law students
and private attorneys are able to rep
resent 30 million poor people dis
plays a lack of understanding of the
increasingly complex field of poverty
law," said Thomas Ehrlich, former
president of the Legal Services Corp.
under Presidents Ford and Carter.
Regardless of their own doubts,
however, a group of law students at
Stanford has accepted Meese's
challenge as earnest. They've com
piled a thoughtful proposal which
would enable interested law students
here to gain academic credit by
working with public defenders.
Students enrolled in the proposed
Stanford/East Palo Alto Community
Law Project would initially take

courses in such areas as landlord-ten
ant, welfare and domestic relations
law before serving in the neighbor
hood. Once students are assigned to
the field, attendance at a concurrent
seminar would be required.
"People in this clinic will be ableto
gain academic credit and more real
knowledge of law than they would in
a first year with a corporate law firm,"
predicts James Steyer, one of the
project's student coordinators.
Added Paul Brest, chairman of the
curriculum committee at Stanford
Law School: "Other law school
clinics that I know about are quite au
tonomous and the faculty aren't in
volved . . . The uniqueness of this
proposal is that it will combine
courses and seminars in addition to
legal practice..."
In keeping with the current White
House style, celebrity law students at
Stanford, Bill Walton and Bob Moore
(who respectively played basketball
for the Portland Trailblazers and
football for the Oakland Raiders), are
expected to beef up a forthcoming
project fundraising drive.
While Meese's appeal to law stu
dents aims to tap their idealism, it ef
fectively throws the burden of defen
ding the poor on the shoulders of rel
atively untrained novices. In a liti
gious society like our own, these stu
dents know their efforts won't be suf
ficient.
Stanford's initial response to feder
al cutbacks is a refreshing example of
what can be done in the face of hard
ship. It reflects the volunteer spirit of
which we ourselves have been skep
tical. Unless Professor Meese and
friends get behind such efforts, he
and cohorts run the risk of perjuring
themselves.
