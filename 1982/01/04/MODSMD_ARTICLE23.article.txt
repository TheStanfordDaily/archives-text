## Young takes controls for Atlanta 
### Associated Press 
Atlanta — Andrew Young,
no stranger to controversy dur
ing a career that has stretched
from Southern pulpits to the
United Nations, moves into city
government this week as
mayor of Atlanta.
Young, 49, took the oath of
office yesterday to become the
second black mayor of this city
of nearly 500,000.
He succeeds Maynard Jack
son, who was not eligible for
re-election after serving eight
years, and he inherits a budget
crunch that could spark the
first political battle of the new
administration.
Jackson, the city's first black
mayor, is leaving office after
recommending a 1982 budget
of $178.9 million — $15 million
more than the city expects to
take in. Since Atlanta is barred
by law from deficit financing,
Jackson has recommended
raising property taxes, increas

ing garbage collection charges
and cutting some city services.
Young has endorsed both
the budget — which includes
hiring 125 new police and es
tablishing small police pre-

cincts at 10 housing projects —
and the tax increase which
would boost city taxes on a
$40,000 home from $132 to
$164, exclusive of school and
county levies.
There has been little en
thusiasm for the tax increase
from the City Council, which
must approve the tax and
spending package. Thus, to win
that early battle, Young is likely

The mayoral election last fall was
decided primarily along racial lines,
despite Atlanta's reputation for
being free of much of the racial
animosity of other Southern cities.

to have to draw on the skills of
oratory and persuasion de
veloped during his days in the
civil rights movement, in Con
gress and in the United Na
tions.

Born in New Orleans, the
son of a prosperous dentist and
a teacher, Young studied for
the ministry at Hartford Theo
logical Seminary in Connecti
cut. He was ordained in the
United Church of Christ and
served congregations in Ala
bama and Georgia.
When the civil rights move
ment began, Young led a voter
registration drive and worked

with white youths in New York
City for the National Council of
Churches. A registration
project in the South put him in
touch with the Dr. Martin Lu
ther King Jr.
Young became one of King's
top lieutenants and was in
charge of the 1963 demonstra
tion in Birmingham, Alabama,
when Police Commissioner
Eugene "Bull" Connor used
fire hoses to repel marchers.
After King was assassinated
in 1968, Young entered politics
and, after one unsuccessful try,
won a seat in Congress from At
lanta in 1972, making him the
first black congressman from
Georgia since 1870.
He campaigned for fellow
Georgian Jimmy Carter in the
1976 presidential campaign.
Following his election, Carter
offered Young the job of U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions.

was decided primarily along ra
cial lines, despite Atlanta's rep
utation for being free of much

Young has yet to send de
finitivesignalsabout hisadmin
istration, and there are indica
tions that much of the old Jack
son city hall will remain intact.
The formal transfer of power
was scheduled for 6 p.m. yes
terday in the 16,000-seat Omni
sports arena, where onlookers
were given candles to light and
hold during the ceremony.
