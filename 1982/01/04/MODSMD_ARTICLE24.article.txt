# Winter strikes the North
## 
### Associated Press 
Holiday storms that killed at least 24 people
spread a treacherous layer of snow and ice
across northern states yesterday and left 20,000
people without electricity in 10-degree weather
in Maine.
Cars spun crazily out of control in chain-reac
tion smashups in cities from Seattle to Baltimore
as up to 18 inches of fresh snow fell in the Rock
ies.
Residents of Roscoe, South Dakota, with only
melted snow to drink, held an emergency meet
ing to decide what to do about the town's water
supply, which froze when the mercury dropped
to 20 below zero.
More snow fell in the Pacific Northwest and
across the Midwest into the Great Lakes region,
where parts of Michigan got 8 inches. Freezing
rain glazed highways through Virginia, Mary
land, Pennsylvania and New York, and winds
whipped up ground blizzards in the snow
smothered Colorado Rockies.
Temperatures dropped to 24 degrees below
zero in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and 4 inches
of rain overnight in Greenwood, Mississippi,
causing some flooding, but police reported no
major problems.
Meanwhile, the National Weather Service said
the "most dangerous storm" of the season was
developing over the Texas Panhandle and was
expected to move toward the Great LakeÂ£.

In Maine, where 2 feet of snow on New Year's
Day ripped down power lines and tree limbs in
Hancock and Washington counties, about
20,000 people were still without power Sunday.
Hundreds of elderly people were moved into
hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities
with emergency power.
Roland Richardson, chief deputy sheriff for
Washington County, said shelters were being set
up Sunday in churches for another 200 people in
case power wasn't restored soon. A police
spokesman in Ellsworth in Hancock County said
people in that area were being urged to seek
shelter at a naval station in Winter Harbor.
Kenneth Cosseboom of the Bangor Hydro-
Electric Co. said coastal areas up to 30 miles in
land were the hardest hit. He said some workers
had been on the job 40 hours straight and crews
were being brought in from other states.
In Roscoe, Mayor Leland Treichel called an
emergency meeting Sunday for the 370 residents
to decide what to do about the water supply. The
town's wells failed p Morage tank had frozen
solid.
"We've got one tank that's sitting there with a
100, CoO gallon ice cube,'' he said.
Storms since New Year's Eve have been
blamed for at least 24 deaths, including seven
people killed in four separate plane crashes in
Colorado, New York, North Carolina and Flori
da.
