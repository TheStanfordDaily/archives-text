### Associated Press 
Monteview, Idaho — Eastern
Idaho farmers shrugged off
threats of boycotts of Idaho
crops Saturday and clubbed
dead another 15,000 wild jack
rabbits.
It was the fifth rabbit round
up in less than a month in an
area where farmers say a huge
population of jack rabbits has
caused an estimated $10 mil
lion damage to their crops.
The number killed so far is
about 55,000 rabbits, and the
farmers say they plan to con
tinue the drives until most of
the rabbits are killed.
Saturday's drive drew be

tween 400 and 500 people de
spite snow, fog and tem
peratures near zero. On foot
and using horses and snow
mobiles, they herded rabbits
into a funnel-shaped trap.
Once inside, the rabbits were
beaten to death.
"There's hundreds of tons of
hay tipping over every day out
here," said Orvin Twitchell, a
Mud Lake farmer who serves as
spokesman for the farm
groups.
As before, most of the dead
hares were sold to an lowa firm
which processes them into
mink food. One man, who said
he was from Pocatello, walked

off with a pair of live jack rab
bits and said he planned to take
them home as pets.
Farmers Friday offered a
bounty of 8 cents per head for
dead hares. Idaho Farm Bureau
Federation spokesman Bill
Whittom said Saturday after
noon some 2,500 had been
turned in, with $200 paid in
bounties.
Animal protection groups
have complained that the
method of slaughter is in
humane. During the week,
four groups announced they
plan to boycott Idaho and its
farm products in protest.
