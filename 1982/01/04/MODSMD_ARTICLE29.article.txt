## Bears win 87-78 in Pac-10 opener; eighth straight win for women cagers Second half miscues derail Cardinal hoopsters 
### Peter Finch 
It looked for awhile as if the
Stanford basketball team final
ly was going to put together a
steady, consistent per
formance.
Unfortunately for the
Cardinal, the steadiness and
the consistency which gave
them a 42-39 halftime edge
over Cal Saturday night disap
peared at intermission, and the
Bears walked away with a 87-78
Pac-10 season opening victory.
Sure, Cal center Mark
McNamara deserves credit for
his occasionally hard-earned
30 points and 12 rebounds. And
the Bears' tenacious zone de
fense did a fine job of keeping
Stanford, now 5-5, at bay in the
second half.
But in truth, the Cardinal
simply fumbled the game
away. And Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso agreed
"When we tried to move the
ball around, we mishandled
passes," said Dißiaso. "They
were not bad passes, but poor
catches."
The Cardinal's problem with
late-game let downs, in fact, is
nothing new. Over its winter
"vacation," the team gave
Christmas present victories to
Santa Clara (62-60) and Mar
quette (66-65) and barely hung
on to defeat Seattle Pacific, a
NCAA Division 2 school, 67-65.
In the Cal game, both teams

came out shooting, and ev
erybody was hitting. Stanford's
Brian Welch started the game
off with an 8-foot bank shot
and Cal's Wes Howell an
swered with a 15-foot jumper.
The teams traded leads in simi
lar fashion for most of the half.
Aftpr Butch Havs opened the
second half for the Bears with
two free throws, the Cardinal
reeled off six unanswered
points to make the score 48-41.
It wasn't long before Cal found
the answer, however, and
cranked out 16 points to Stan
ford's four and took a 57-52
lead.
This was when the slopiness
began and Stanford's hopes for
victory ended.
"When we got down by sev
en, I called a timeout and re
minded (the team) of the ad
justments we made at half
time," said Cal coach Dick
Kuchpn. "We didn't adjust at
the start of the second half. Af
ter that we blocked out well,
and played extremely well on
defense."
The Bears, now 7-3, also
began to hit their free throws.
Cal made only three of nine
first-half attempts, but missed
only two of 20 in the second
halt.
Stanford didn't miss a single
free throw on the night. How
ever, the Cardinal was given

only six chances, and only two
in the second half.
Another factor inhibiting the
Cardinal's performance was
the absence of the team's third
leading scorer, Keith Jones.
Jones, a sophomore guard who
was averaging 10.6 points per
game, was declared academ
ically ineligible last week and
will not be allowed to play for
the remainder of the season.
According to Dißiaso, al
though it was known that Jones
"was having some academic
difficulties," he was not aware
he would be ineligible until last
week.
In women's basketball, the
Cardinal won three more
games over the winter break,
upping its total to eight con
secutive victories and tying a
school record.
In the first game, led by Meg
Metzger's 21 points, Stanford
defeated Pepperdine 82-42.
The next night the team beat
Idaho 79-65. Louise Smith had
24 points and 19 rebounds, a
career high. Saturday, the
Cardinal completed the Christ
mas sweep with a 86-55 victory
over Texas A&M. Metzger led
all scorers with 21 points.

peared at intermission, and the
Bears walked away with a 87-78
Pac-10 season opening victory.
Sure, Cal center Mark
McNamara deserves credit for
his occasionally hard-earned
30 points and 12 rebounds. And
the Bears' tenacious zone de
fense did a fine job of keeping
Stanford, now 5-5, at bay in the
second half.
But in truth, the Cardinal
simply fumbled the game
away. And Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso agreed
"When we tried to move the
ball around, we mishandled
passes," said Dißiaso. "They
were not bad passes, but poor
catches."
The Cardinal's problem with
late-game let downs, in fact, is
nothing new. Over its winter
"vacation," the team gave
Christmas present victories to
Santa Clara (62-60) and Mar
quette (66-65) and barely hung
on to defeat Seattle Pacific, a
NCAA Division 2 school, 67-65.
In the Cal game, both teams

came out shooting, and ev
erybody was hitting. Stanford's
Brian Welch started the game
off with an 8-foot bank shot
and Cal's Wes Howell an
swered with a 15-foot jumper.
The teams traded leads in simi
lar fashion for most of the half.
Aftpr Butch Havs opened the
second half for the Bears with
two free throws, the Cardinal
reeled off six unanswered
points to make the score 48-41.
It wasn't long before Cal found
the answer, however, and
cranked out 16 points to Stan
ford's four and took a 57-52
lead.
This was when the slopiness
began and Stanford's hopes for
victory ended.
"When we got down by sev
en, I called a timeout and re
minded (the team) of the ad
justments we made at half
time," said Cal coach Dick
Kuchpn. "We didn't adjust at
the start of the second half. Af
ter that we blocked out well,
and played extremely well on
defense."
The Bears, now 7-3, also
began to hit their free throws.
Cal made only three of nine
first-half attempts, but missed
only two of 20 in the second
halt.
Stanford didn't miss a single
free throw on the night. How
ever, the Cardinal was given

only six chances, and only two
in the second half.
Another factor inhibiting the
Cardinal's performance was
the absence of the team's third
leading scorer, Keith Jones.
Jones, a sophomore guard who
was averaging 10.6 points per
game, was declared academ
ically ineligible last week and
will not be allowed to play for
the remainder of the season.
According to Dißiaso, al
though it was known that Jones
"was having some academic
difficulties," he was not aware
he would be ineligible until last
week.
In women's basketball, the
Cardinal won three more
games over the winter break,
upping its total to eight con
secutive victories and tying a
school record.
In the first game, led by Meg
Metzger's 21 points, Stanford
defeated Pepperdine 82-42.
The next night the team beat
Idaho 79-65. Louise Smith had
24 points and 19 rebounds, a
career high. Saturday, the
Cardinal completed the Christ
mas sweep with a 86-55 victory
over Texas A&M. Metzger led
all scorers with 21 points.

It looked for awhile as if the
