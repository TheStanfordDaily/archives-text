# Woman attacked during finals week
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
A 19-year-old Stanford woman escaped a pos
sible kidnap attempt on Dec. 16 while walking
across a parking lot near the Varian Physics Build
ing. The attempt took place at about 6 p.m.
Although this woman, a student, is the sixth to
be assaulted on campus since late September — in
cluding two other women who were raped — her
description of the assailant estimates his age to be
about 40, while the previous attacker(s) were de
scribed as being 18 to 20.
University Police Lt. Marvin Moore said it is pos
sible the recent attack was by the same assailant.
According to University Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer and Chief Marvin Herrington, the stu
dent was walking across a parking lot near the Vari
an Physics Building when a motorist asked her for
directions to Tresidder Union, then reached out
and grabbed her and tried to pull her into his car —
a white, four-door, American-made car.
The woman wrenched free and notified the po
lice immediately.
The woman described her assailant as black,
about 40 years old, 5 feet 10 inches tall, with a short

Afro-style haircut and a stocky, muscular build.
Campus police are investigating all of the at
tacks. On Nov. 17, they released two composites of
the assailant. They have no suspects.
In response to the Dec. 16 attack, Albert Hastorf,
University vice president and provost, announced
that during the winter break period from Dec. 21
to Jan. 1, parking permit and time limit regulations
would not be enforced daily after 3 p.m.
Hastorf, who made the decision in President
Donald Kennedy's absence (Kennedy was on the
East Coast), said the action was designed as a spe
cial caution because the campus is sparsely popu
lated during the holidays.
According to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, it is unlikely the parking regulations will
remain eased winter quarter.
Herrington said campus parking lot patrols have
been increased since the attacks.
Students United for Rape Elimination (SURE)
continues to offer free escort service for women.
SURE, which screens its escorts, received an aver
age of 18 calls a night during the fall quarter, ac
cording to Andrew Cargile, SURE's student direc

tor.
It is not only students who are worried by the as
saults. Women working on campus said they are
frightened by the attacks.
"You bet I'm scared," said Betty Oswald, admin
istrative assistant in the Communications Depart
ment. "I work until 5 p.m. Every time the door
opens I get up and look to see who comes in."
Karen Rezendes, a secretary at Encina Commons
and in the Comparative Literature Department,
said she has been apprehensive since the attacks.
"I don't feel safe, but it's not just on Stanford
campus," Rezendes said. "Now I try to be con
scious of who's around me, especially around the
parking lot."
Both Oswald and Rezendes said they believe the
campus police are taking all possible measures to
apprehend the suspected assailant and to provide
safety. Rezendes also said she believes the public
ity and information about the attacks and rape pre
vention are necessary.
"But, two days after the last rape, I still saw a
young woman come through the bushes and start
jogging alone," Rezendes said.
