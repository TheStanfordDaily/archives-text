Miami (AP) — The Clemson

whether it's true that it's harder
to stay at the top than it is to get
there in the first place.
Coach Danny Ford, still bask
ing in the glow of Clemson's
first national championship in
its 86 years of football, is look
ing forward to the challenge.
"If we can replace some dog
gone good players, we'll try
and do it again," Ford said Sun
day before heading back to
Clemson and hitting the re
cruiting trail.
The Tigers' entire backfield,
led by quarterback Homer Jor
dan, will be back this fall, but
the team must replace three
starters on the offensive line
and both wide receivers, in
cluding record-breaker Perry
Tuttle.
Five starters also will be gone
from the nation's eighth
ranked defense, including
linebacker Jeff Davis, tackle
Jeff Bryant and both cor
nerbacks.
"We've got to have a good
recruiting year," Ford said.

"And I think because of this
(the national championship),
we'll get to talk and have peo
ple believe what we say a little
bit more."
