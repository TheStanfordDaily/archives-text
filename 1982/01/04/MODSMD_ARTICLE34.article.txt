Poland to meet debt payment
Western sources said yesterday that Poland
had come up with the $350 million it needed to
pay by the end of 1981 toavoidtechnical default
on its huge $26.3 billion in debts to Western
governments and banks.
The sources said this information had been
given by Deputy Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski
during a visit last week to West Germany. The
sources said he also assured the West Germans
that Poland would continue to meet its financial
obligations.
Earlier, Western banks had refused to provide
Poland with the necessary funds, which were
required to pay the remainder of last year's in
terest on the debt.
The sources said that since Poland's hard-cur
rency reserves were virtually non-existent and
since no Western institutions or governments
were known to have provided the cash, it was
assumed that the $350 million came from within
the Soviet Bloc, probably from Moscow itself.
The Polish government has made no an
nouncement of the payment and there was no
way to confirm the reports.
Poland had been scheduled to begin nego
tiations with both the U.S. government and
American banks this month on possible
rescheduling of Poland's $2 billion debt to the
United States.
Rehnquist leaves hospital
Washington — Supreme Court Associate Jus
tice William Rehnquist was released from
George Washington University Hospital here
yesterday after recovering from a drug with
drawal reaction that caused what hospital of
ficials said were temporary "disturbances in
mental clarity."
"He was in good condition, good spirits, and
he went home," said Dr. Dennis O'Leary, the
hospital's dean of clinical affairs. O'Leary said
there is a "reasonable expectation" that Rehn
quist will be ready to return to work when the
Supreme Court resumes its session Jan. 11.
Rehnquist, 57, entered the hospital Dec. 27
when his physician, Dr. Hugo Rizzoli, pre
scribed a reduced dosage of a painkilling drug
Rehnquist was taking for chronic lower back
pain. On Dec. 30, Rehnquist began suffering
the withdrawal symptoms.
O'Leary said yesterday that after the drug re
action, Rizzoli had restored Rehnquist's ori
ginal dosage and then reduced it more gradu
ally so that Rehnquist overcame the initial with
drawal symptoms.
O'Leary said hospital policy prevented him
from identifying the drug Rehnquist had been

taking.
Neither Rizzoli nor Rehnquist could be
reached for comment. A Supreme Court
spokesman said he did not know when Rehn
quist would return to work.
FBI investigating officials
New York — The FBI has 1400 public officials
under investigation for possible corruption, bu
reau Director William Webster said yesterday.
Webster, interviewed on ABC-TV's "This
Week With David Brink ley," said those under
investigation included appointed and elected
officials on all levels of government — local,
state and federal.
He said they were being investigated because
they were believed "to be utilizing their offices
for corrupt purposes."
In Oklahoma alone, Webster said, 135 people
have been convicted or pleaded guilty "in a
statewide pervasive practice at the local level of
county commissioners accepting bribes or kick
backs."
He said the FBI began such investigations be
cause in many cases, the people responsible for
prosecuting officials were there "at the suf
ferance or through the efforts of the people un
der investigation. It makes it very difficult for
them to do that job."
Also during the program, Webster was asked
how many Soviet KGB agents are operating in
the United States.
"That's a classified figure, but if you take 35
percent of all diplomats in this country, you'd
not be far off," he said, estimating that there are
1200 diplomats in the United States.
In addition, he said, there are others who are
not diplomats, "illegals" who are in the United
States under other cover.
He said all the Soviet bloc countries also were
"busily engaged through their intelligence
sources in technology transfer efforts."
Asked if there was any hard evidence that a
Libyan "hit team" was in the United States to as
sassinate President Ronald Reagan, he said,
"We've never confirmed that."
Allen and Reagan to meet
Palm Springs, Calif. — The White House in
vestigation of national security adviser Richard
Allen could be finished as early as today, lead
ing to a meeting between Allen and President
Ronald Reagan, whose aides say Allen will be
replaced by top State Department official Wil
liam Clark.
As Reagan returns today to Washington after
a week-long vacation in California, one of his
top priorities will be clearing up the Allen issue
and overhauling the White House foreign poli

cy operation.
Allen, Reagan's national security assistant
since the administration took office, has been
on administrative leave with pay since Nov. 29
while the Justice Department investigated the
circumstances surrounding $1000 found in a
safe in an office once used by Allen.
Allen has said the money was given by repre
sentatives of a Japanese magazine who in
terviewed Nancy Reagan last Jan. 21. The Justice
Department said Dec. 23 it had cleared Allen of
any wrongdoing.
A White House spokesman said yesterday
that Allen had asked presidential counsellor
Edwin Meese 111 for a meeting with Reagan.
Brzezinski urges sanctions
Washington — Former national security ad
viser Zbigniew Brzezinski said yesterday that
the United States should step up its economic
sanctions against the Soviet Union for its con
tinued involvement in Poland.
Brzezinski, interviewed on CBS' "Face the
Nation," said cutting off phosphate shipments
to the Soviets would demonstate U.S. resolve to
Moscow.
"If the Soviets were to become actively in
volved, I think we ought to adopt economic
sanctions across the board," he said. "If there is
no accommodation, growing Soviet interven
tion, then we should think of publicly renounc
ing the Yalta agreements."
But George Kennan, a former U.S. am
bassador to the Soviet Union, opposed the Rea
gan administration's sanctionsagainst Moscow,
saying they heighten tensions and create ill feel
ing between the two governments.
Brzezinski denied that a rejection of the 1945
Yalta agreements that divided Europe into
spheres of western and eastern influence would
amount to a declaration of war.
He said the Soviets cannot expect to control
eastern and central Europe now the way it did
immediately after World War 11.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt,
who is to meet with President Ronald Reagan
tomorrow in Washington, said in an interview
published yesterday by The New York Times
that any attempt by the United States to alter the
balance of power in Europe would mean war.
