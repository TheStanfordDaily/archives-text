# Two Stanford deaths
## 
### 
Dolores Worthington, assistant
dean of the Stanford School of Earth
Sciences and her husband, William,
both died of heart failure only hours
apart on Dec. 7.
Mrs. Worthington had had heart
bypass surgery and a valve operation
in September, but returned to work
Dec. 1, apparently much improved in
health.
She died in her sleep in the cou

pie's Menlo Park home. Her hus
band, who had retired about five
years ago, found her body, suffered a
heart attack himself and died at the
Hospital about two hours after his
wife.
They are survived by their two
daughters, Carol Vonder Linden and
Gail Roland, two sons-in-law and
three grandchildren.
