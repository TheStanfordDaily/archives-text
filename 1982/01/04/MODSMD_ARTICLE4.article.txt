# Zetes leave clean house and dirty pond

### 
Members of the Zeta Psi (Zete)
fraternity house left a relatively clean
and undamaged house behind them
when they evacuated the University
facility on Dec. 19, according to ad
ministrators, even though their part
ing actions prompted yet another
run-in with police and this time the
fire department as well.
The Palo Alto Fire Department was
summoned the night of Dec. 18toex
tinguish flames caused bya bonfirein
which the fraternity's bar and bar
stools were burned, according to
Stanford police.

Although the police would make
no comment to the Daily yesterday, a
University press release reported that
the Palo Alto Fire Department was
summoned twice Friday night by po
lice staking out the fraternity. After
arriving on the scene, firefighters ex
tinguished flames 20 feet high which
were burning in the Zetes' pond —
the same pond into which a Mills Col
lege woman was thrown earlier this
year, prompting a three-year sus
pension for the fraternity and the
University decision which forced
them to leave the house.

University officials inspected the
house Dec. 21. Aside from a pond full
of ashes, they said they were pleased
with the overall condition of the
house.
"I've never seen the floor this
clean," commented Diana Conklin,
assistant dean of student affairs. Re
portedly at least one alumnus and
several house members had worked
through the weekend cleaning the
house.
The house will become part of the
general University housing system

this quarter.
On Dec. 19, two students — at least
one a Zete, according to police —
were arrested on suspicion of sign
theft. The two were cited and re
leased.
One of the University's complaints
against the fraternity was the unclean
condition of the house at the end of
last spring quarter. Members of the
fraternity, however, claim that the
house was left clean but that gradu
ating members later trashed the resi
dence after final examinations.
