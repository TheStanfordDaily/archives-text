### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Twenty-one pieces of furniture al
legedly stolen from University de
partments were confiscated by Stan
ford police from the Delta Upsilon
(DU)fraternity last Wednesday, ac
cording to Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
The furniture was discovered dur
ing a routine examination of Row
houses by University maintenance
employees, according to Norm Rob
inson, associate dean of residential
education, who said he was notified
of the situation by the police the
same day.
The employees had previously re
cieved a police report stating that
furniture had been stolen from the
Law School in October, Robinson
said. He said that the employees ap
parently thought the furniture re
sembled that described in the police
report.
Robinson said the police acted in
response to a telephone call from the
maintenance workers. The house
was vacant when a moving crew of
four, led by Niemeyer, arrived at 10
a.m. to haul away the furniture.
According to the police report re
leased Wednesday, at least one chair
was from the Terman Engineering
building and several other chairs
bore markings from the Medical
Center. Not all the property reported
missing from the Law School was
found.
The police left a copy of the search
warrantand an inventory of the items
they removed from the house on the
pool table, according to Wayne
McKay, DUpresident.
Niemeyer said 30 other items, in
cluding signs and small quantities of
marijuana and hashish, also were
taken by police. The articles were
found in individual rooms, which
were "clean and beautifully deco
rated," Niemeyer said. Police also
took evidence to establish the identi
ty of each room's occupants.
"They didn't do any kind of illegal
search. They did everything by the
book, as far as I can tell," McKay said.
Despite repeated attempts to ob
tain information about the scope of
the warrant and the confiscation of
property, Stanford police refused to

release any information until later
this week.
One fraternity member said drugs
were not specifically listed on the
warrant, but added that he thought
police were within their rights in
searching for the names of individ
uals in possession of the stolen items.
One source inside the house ques
tioned the legality of confiscating
other illegal items, such as drugs,
which were apparently uncovered in
the search. Another DU said he
thought the police were allowed to
confiscate anything illegal.
Niemeyer said he would recom
mend to the district attorney felony
charges of possession of stolen prop
erty.
Both Robinson and McKay said
they did not know if charges will be
pressed, adding that it is primarily up
to the D.A.'s office. McKay said he
would have a better idea of what to
expect after talking to the police
tomorrow.
None of the stolen property was
found in common areas; all of it was
recovered from individuals' rooms,
according to McKay.
Robinson said he met with McKay
yesterday afternoon to discuss what
had happened and what was going to
happen. "Wayne and I talked about
whether this was a house action or an
individual action. I'm inclined to
think this is just an individual prob
lem," Robinson said.
"What we are trying to do is be
helpful to Wayne and the guys in the
house," Robinson said. "I don't
know that all the furniture taken out
was stolen. That issomethingthatwill
have to be determined," Robinson
said.
Regarding the confiscation of
marijuna and hashish, Robinson said
he was aware that some had been
found, but thought it was a "suffi
ciently small quantity" not todeserve
further attention.
There is some question as to when
the furniture was acquired. Three
fraternity members claimed that
much of it had been in the house
before this fall. "We need to de
termine if the furniture showed up a
number of years ago or if it was newly
acquired," McKay said.
