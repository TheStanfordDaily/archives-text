# New drunk driving laws go into effect
## The
						new laws make it illegal to drive with a blood alcohol content of .1 percent 
### 
A statewide campaign by law en
forcement agencies to reduce alco
hol-related highway accidents was
bolstered New Year's Day at 12:01
a.m., when revisions in California's
drunk driving laws designed to make
the penalties for combining autos
and alcohol even more severe, went
into effect.
Immediate statistics appear to in
dicate that the threat is being taken
seriously by motorists, as the Califor
nia Highway patrol has reported that
the number of traffic fatalities and

drunk driving arrests this New Year's
Eve weekend is down significantly
compared to last year and is likely at
tributable to the tougher legislation.
Among other provisions, one law
makes it illegal to drive with a blood
alcohol content of .1 percent: about
four drinks for the average person.
Previously a .1 percent reading only
presumed drunkeness and could be
rebutted in court.
Other laws increase the penalties
for conviction and require the im

pounding of the arrested person's
car at the owner's expense for one to
30 days. If the charge is reduced or
dismissed, the new law requires the
court to show why.
A total of 23 people died on Cali
fornia highways during the 60-hour
period from 6 p.m. Thursday through
6 a.m. Sunday, according to a CHP
spokesman. This is compared to 47 fa
talities in the same time period last
New Year's, he said.
In Santa Clara County, meanwhile,

a campaign entitled "Avoid the 13"
— referring to the 13 police agencies
of the county and San Jose State Uni
versity Police — has accompanied
the holiday crackdown on drunk
driving by local law enforcement. As
of yesterday, 1237 arrests had been
made for drunk driving violations,
there had been 129 alcohol-related
accidents and one person had died in
an accident believed to be alcohol
related. These numbers were rec
orded for the period Dec. 18 through
Jan. 3.
