M.inila, Philippines â€” Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos sharply denied yesterday that
his family was involved in the disappearance of a
leading sports figure who reportedly married
Marcos' daughter in the United States last
month. Marcos accused the missing man's fami
ly of "contemptible and cheap" efforts to de
fame him.
The president ordered the military and police
to use all efforts to find Tomas Manotoc, who of
ficials say presumably has been kidnapped, and
he called on the press and the Manotoc family to
cooperate in the efforts to solve the case.
Marcos' angry reaction came five days after
Manotoc, 33, a basketball coach and top
amateur golfer, was reported missing after din
ing with Maria Imelda "Imee' Marcos in a Ma
nila restaurant.
The Manotoc family has alleged official in
volvement in the disappearance.
Manotoc's family has reported that he was

married secretly to Imee Marcos in an Arlington,
Virginia, ceremony last month. The marriage
was opposed by Imee Marcos' parents, largely
because Manotoc already had been married, ac
cording to the Manotoc family.
Marcos' statement, issued by Malacanang Pal
ace, criticized the Manotocfamilyfortheallega
tions. He also assailed the foreign press for "us
ing the same allegations without the slightest ef
fort at verification."
The statement did not say directly whether
Imee Marcos had been married to Manotoc,
who was estranged from his first wife, Aurora Pi
juan. According to Manotoc family sources, he
divorced his wife in the Dominican Republic last
month, since divorce is illegal in the pre
dominantly Roman Catholic Philippines.
The statement said the presidential family can
not have any interest in the disappearance of
Manotoc because a divorce obtained overseas is
not recognized in the Philippines.
