# Clark gets job after Allen quits
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — National Se
curity Adviser Richard Allen resigned
yesterday, and President Ronald Rea
gan immediately replaced him with
Deputy Secretary of State William
Clark.
Reagan said he accepted the resig
nation "with deep regret" during a
meeting with Allen, who left the
White House without comment to
reporters. Only hours earlier, Allen
had said at his home he had no inten
tion of resigning.
The meeting followed Reagan's re
ceipt of an internal White House re
port on Allen's conduct. The presi
dent, in a brief announcement re
layed by his press office, said he had
asked Allen to serve as a "consultant"'
in organizing a new foreign in
telligence advisory board.
Allen replied in writing that he
would be pleased to undertake that
"interim task."
Clark arrived at the White House
just moments after Allen departed
and discussed his new duties with re
porters.
The president said in his statement,
read by Deputy Press Secretary Larry
Speakes, that Allen had been cleared
of any wrongdoing by a study in
vestigating the $1000 Allen received
from a Japanese magazine, as well as
three watches accepted from
Japanese friends.
In an exchange of letters, Reagan
told Allen that as he leaves his job he
did so "with my confidence, trust and
admiration for your personal integri
ty and your exemplary service to the
nation."
"Over the past year, you have
served our nation with great distinc
tion as my assistant for national secur
ity affairs," Reagan said. "You have
provided me with invaluable advice
and counsel over the years of our as
sociation and I am grateful for your
constant loyalty and dedication."
Allen stated:
"It has been a rare privilege and a
high honor to serve in your adminis
tration, and before that in the years
of your campaign for the presidency,
you have created memories which
will accompany me and my family
forever, and your trust and con
fidence are a source of deep pride
and satisfaction."
Clark, a former California Supreme
Court justice, was Reagan's first chief
of staff when Reagan was governor of
California and is one of the most sen
ior members of the president's inner
circle.
But when he became deputy secre
tary of state, he had had no ex
perience in foreign policy, and was
confirmed by the Senate only after a
stormy confrontation with the For
eign Relations Committee.
Clark told reporters the president
has "not changed his position" that
Secretary of State Alexander Haig Jr.
is his chief formulator and spokes
man on foreign policy.
But Speakes said that new national
security adviser "will have a direct re
porting relationship to the presi
dent," something Allen did not en
joy.
Allen generally communicated
with the chief executive through
Edwin Meese 111, the president's
counselor.
Speakes said that Clark "in his new
role will be responsible for the de
velopment, coordination and im
plementation of national security
policy, as approved by the presi
dent."
