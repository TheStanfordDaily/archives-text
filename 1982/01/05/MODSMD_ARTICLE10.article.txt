## An organization brings government closer to students 
### Jane McConnell 
"Fulfilling a committment to bring the
government closer to Stanford students,
and vice versa" is how Chairperson Susan
Zaroff described Stanford-ln-Govern
ment.
Stanford-ln-Government is a student
run organization whose primary function
is to obtain internships for Stanford stu
dents in Washington D.C. and Sacra
mento. Applicants for internships are first
given advice on writing resumes and cov
er letters, and are then interviewed by
Zaroff and Executive Director Eric Bur
roughs, who try to get an idea of their
qualifications and expectations.
"We help them figure out how best to
sell themselves, by highlighting their
number one selling points," explained
Zaroff. "For example, an intern may have
fantastic writing abilities, or know a lot
about the environment. Basically, we
want the group of applicants from Stan
ford to be the best that it can possibly be,
and we want to get a firm idea in mind of
what each applicant is like."
With this idea in mind, Stanford-ln-
Government members then go on a lob
bying trip to Washington D.C., to try to
"drum up" support for applicants.

"We try to sell the students on a per
sonal level," said Publicity Director Nancy
Williams. "We try to give Stanford stu
dents a competitive edge on the eastern
schools. Because they are so close to D.C.,
interns from the East can apply in person,
and also because they get out of school
earlier than we do — in May — they have
a definite advantage in obtaining in
ternships."
"We knock onevery doorwheresome
one has applied, and try to present them
in the best possible light," added Zaroff,
"We've had tremendous success in the
past with this personal connection." Last
year about 150 students were represented
on the lobbying trip, and more than 100
ended up with positions.
Stanford-ln-Government provides oth
er valuable services to interns — one of
the most important is funding. Each year,
about 10 students who otherwise could
not afford to hold internships are given
stipends which enable them to do so. Ad
ditional stipends allow students to accept
non-paid positions.
"An internship is a notoriously low-pay
or non-paid proposition," said Williams.
"Our funding takes into account trans
portation, housing and food, and helps

students to get by for the summer, but
rarely to make money."
The organization used to be funded
solely through one anonymous donor —
an alum who gave enough to cover all fi
nancial aid, which then totalled between
$10,000 and $20,000 a year. This donor has
since decided to extend funds to other
areas, and has given Stanford-ln-Govern
ment a final lump sum to last for the next
few years.
"In the meantime, we're looking for
new sources of funding," said Margo
Nelson, director of classes and student
services, who acts as unofficial advisor for
the organization. "There is a feeling that
since it isastudent organization, itshould
be funded by students." The organization
lost the vote for a fee assessment this fall,
but may try again in the spring. They have
also tried to obtain donations from
former interns.
The organization also serves as an in
formational resource, wherestudentscan
look through files of questionnaires from
congressional offices, agencies and com
mittees, to discover what each office
looks for when hiring an intern.

The organization also helps students
find housing in Washington D.C. by writ
ing to all the alums in the area, and asking
them if they'd like a "housesitter" for the
summer, or a "temporary live-in."
It also organizes a summer program of
meetings for students in Washington D.C.
They are currently working with the
guest professorship board and the Stan
ford Committee on Political Education to
get guestspeakersand organize seminars.
"Basically, we are trying to bring a greater
awareness of government to the cam
pus," said Zaroff.
The organization is also developing a
structured program to provide credit for
internships. "Currently, credit is avail
able, but it's complicated to arrange.
We're trying to change that," said Wil
liams.
Besides a chairperson, executive direc
tor, and publicity director, the organiza
tion consists of about 60students, most of
whom are undergraduates. Everyone in
volved is a board member, and is required
to sit for office hours once a month. No
credit or pay is given, but according to
Zaroff, the advantage of being involved is

that board members get first access to in
formation, housing, and services, and this
exposure helps them a great deal in ob
taining internships.
Engineering major Gary Robinson
served as an intern last spring in the office
of Rep. James Santini (R-Nev.), working
on the MX missile.
"The missile was a hot issue back then,
and I did a lot of environmental impact
studies on it, to determine its effect on
small towns and farms," said Robinson.
Because he was the only intern in the
office, Robinson had a lot of staff privi
leges, and said he was treated just as an
other member of the staff. In addition to
doing research, he wrote letters to consti
tuents and represented Santini at ban
quets.
Robinson said the most important thing
he learned from the experience was the
value of "saying the right thing at the right
time — I discovered that you words travel
further than you think" he said. "One
time at a reception I commented that
Senator Orrin Hatch wasn't one of my fa
vorite people, and it turned out that one
of his staff members was at the reception.
It was a big mess."

them if they'd like a "housesitter" for the
summer, or a "temporary live-in."
It also organizes a summer program of
meetings for students in Washington D.C.
They are currently working with the
guest professorship board and the Stan
ford Committee on Political Education to
get guestspeakersand organize seminars.
"Basically, we are trying to bring a greater
awareness of government to the cam
pus," said Zaroff.
The organization is also developing a
structured program to provide credit for
internships. "Currently, credit is avail
able, but it's complicated to arrange.
We're trying to change that," said Wil
liams.
Besides a chairperson, executive direc
tor, and publicity director, the organiza
tion consists of about 60students, most of
whom are undergraduates. Everyone in
volved is a board member, and is required
to sit for office hours once a month. No
credit or pay is given, but according to
Zaroff, the advantage of being involved is

that board members get first access to in
formation, housing, and services, and this
exposure helps them a great deal in ob
taining internships.
Engineering major Gary Robinson
served as an intern last spring in the office
of Rep. James Santini (R-Nev.), working
on the MX missile.
"The missile was a hot issue back then,
and I did a lot of environmental impact
studies on it, to determine its effect on
small towns and farms," said Robinson.
Because he was the only intern in the
office, Robinson had a lot of staff privi
leges, and said he was treated just as an
other member of the staff. In addition to
doing research, he wrote letters to consti
tuents and represented Santini at ban
quets.
Robinson said the most important thing
he learned from the experience was the
value of "saying the right thing at the right
time — I discovered that you words travel
further than you think" he said. "One
time at a reception I commented that
Senator Orrin Hatch wasn't one of my fa
vorite people, and it turned out that one
of his staff members was at the reception.
It was a big mess."
"Fulfilling a committment to bring the
government closer to Stanford students,
and vice versa" is how Chairperson Susan
Zaroff described Stanford-ln-Govern
ment.
Stanford-ln-Government is a student
run organization whose primary function
is to obtain internships for Stanford stu
dents in Washington D.C. and Sacra
mento. Applicants for internships are first
given advice on writing resumes and cov
er letters, and are then interviewed by
Zaroff and Executive Director Eric Bur
roughs, who try to get an idea of their
qualifications and expectations.
"We help them figure out how best to
sell themselves, by highlighting their
number one selling points," explained
Zaroff. "For example, an intern may have
fantastic writing abilities, or know a lot
about the environment. Basically, we
want the group of applicants from Stan
ford to be the best that it can possibly be,
and we want to get a firm idea in mind of
what each applicant is like."
With this idea in mind, Stanford-ln-
Government members then go on a lob
bying trip to Washington D.C., to try to
"drum up" support for applicants.

"We try to sell the students on a per
sonal level," said Publicity Director Nancy
Williams. "We try to give Stanford stu
dents a competitive edge on the eastern
schools. Because they are so close to D.C.,
interns from the East can apply in person,
and also because they get out of school
earlier than we do — in May — they have
a definite advantage in obtaining in
ternships."
"We knock onevery doorwheresome
one has applied, and try to present them
in the best possible light," added Zaroff,
"We've had tremendous success in the
past with this personal connection." Last
year about 150 students were represented
on the lobbying trip, and more than 100
ended up with positions.
Stanford-ln-Government provides oth
er valuable services to interns — one of
the most important is funding. Each year,
about 10 students who otherwise could
not afford to hold internships are given
stipends which enable them to do so. Ad
ditional stipends allow students to accept
non-paid positions.
"An internship is a notoriously low-pay
or non-paid proposition," said Williams.
"Our funding takes into account trans
portation, housing and food, and helps

students to get by for the summer, but
rarely to make money."
The organization used to be funded
solely through one anonymous donor —
an alum who gave enough to cover all fi
nancial aid, which then totalled between
$10,000 and $20,000 a year. This donor has
since decided to extend funds to other
areas, and has given Stanford-ln-Govern
ment a final lump sum to last for the next
few years.
"In the meantime, we're looking for
new sources of funding," said Margo
Nelson, director of classes and student
services, who acts as unofficial advisor for
the organization. "There is a feeling that
since it isastudent organization, itshould
be funded by students." The organization
lost the vote for a fee assessment this fall,
but may try again in the spring. They have
also tried to obtain donations from
former interns.
The organization also serves as an in
formational resource, wherestudentscan
look through files of questionnaires from
congressional offices, agencies and com
mittees, to discover what each office
looks for when hiring an intern.
