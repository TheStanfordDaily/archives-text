## Garey Ramey Europe: collapsing economy 
### 
Since the Greeks vanquished their
Persian foes in the days of Alexander,
Europe has remained the world's
most important and influential re
gion. Led by explorers, European
armed forces ventured out and con
quered the entire world. European
culture has had a heavy impact upon
nearly every society, and European
economic ideas and institutions have
been the keys to building the
modern non-European industrial su
perpowers, Japan and the United
States.
Today, however, European in
fluence is collapsing. This decline is
so abrupt, so complete and so devas
tating that it virtually defies historical
comparison. Further, the free-fall
can only accelerate, since Europe is
on the threshold of a completely new
array of destructive and intractable
problems. The European economies
are facing chaos and catastrophe.
The causes of the European de
cline are many, but several factors
predominate. The European nations
have proven themselves unwilling or
unable to compete successfully for
world markets, and they have lost out
in competition even for their
domestic markets. Their industries
have become inefficient and inflex
ible, completely stymied by socially
inspired regulations and bureau
cratic institutions. Socialism as they
practice it is wrecking Europe, and it
is no wonder that high unemploy
ment, lowered standards of living
and social unrest characterize the Eu
rope of today.
The figures alone tell the bleak
story. Low unemployment in the 2-3
percent range has for years been a
proud symbol of Europe. Today un
employment in the European com
munity has reached 8 percent and
shows no sign of declining. At the
same time, real output for the Eu
ropean community will shrink by
almost 2 percent in 1981 while infla
tion stays high.
These do not promise to be short
term developments. Europe pros
pered because it lead the world in
production of machine tools, optics,
consumer electronics, small cars,
steel, chemicals, and a myriad of oth
er industries. Japanese and American
companies, however, have now
wiped out Europeans competition
for most of these markets. Japan,
more than any other country, has put
pressure on these traditional Europe

an strongholds.
In addition to dominating the
world markets, Japan is now taking
over the Europeans' home markets.
Japanese exports to the European
community have doubled since 1977,
and the community's trade deficit
with Japan has increased 48-fold
from 1970 to the present. The deficit
today stands at $14.3 billion. Once
again, the trends indicate that the sit
uation will only grow worse.
Of course, one may contend that
these problems are temporary and
cyclical, and that they will eventually
correct themselves. But this argu
ment turns its back on reality. In
which markets does Europe hope to
turn itself around? The Europeans
have no base of raw material in
dustries, as does the United States
with food, lumber and coal. They
further show utterly no indication of

having the production and market
ing expertise which would allow
them to take on the Japanese in the
manufacturing markets which Eu
rope once dominated.
New problems are arising now
which will only accelerate Europe's
decline. The key to future economic
growth lies in computers and their
high-technology spinoffs, including
industrial robotics and computer-as
sisted design. These industries were
created and developed in America
and Japan. At this point, the Europe
an challenge in these crucial sectors
is laughable, and there are no signs
that Europe will come up with a mag
ic formula to overcome the deficit.
The Europeans must instead buy
the new technologies from overseas.
Efforts to mass-produce high-tech
nology products have amounted to

little more than pasting European
labels on Japanese imports. In West
Germany, the big new Siemen's com
puter is made by Fujitsu. Italy's Olive
tti has a popular new typewriter
which is also of Japanese make.
Not only is Europe being left be
hind in the industries of the future,
but increasingly successful Third
World countries such as South Korea,
Taiwan, Singapore and Brazil are
mounting impressive challenges in
the few markets in which Europe is
still credible.
Why can't Europe compete? Why
is it so totally overwhelmed again and
again in the very markets which it
created and at one time controlled?
The answer lies in the gross ineffi
ciencies which have been built into
European industries by intrusive gov
ernments and organized labor. Un
der the banner of Socialism, political
ly powerful unions have wrested
opulent wages and fringe benefits
from companies, pricing European
goods out of world markets.
Political pressure has led to regu
lations which have crippled in
dustrial flexibility. Union and gov
ernment rules dictate how com
panies must use workers even if
absurd inefficiences result, and de
facto prohibitions against layoffs pre
vent economies from shifting work
ers away from decaying older in
dustries such as steel to dynamic new
industries like electronics.
Liberal social benefits paid by gov
ernments are financed directly
through robbing resources from the
capital pools which are the origins of
new investment. Thus the European
capital stock has steadily deterio
rated and competitive industries are
never built.
Europe has pursued its Socialist
policies to the extreme. At the same
time, America, Japan and other na
tions, with much more sensible poli
cies, have totally annihilated Europe
in the race for prosperity.
Sadly, the present polarization of
European politics makes solutions to
these problems even harder to attain.
The facts, trends and causes are all
clear. The world is witnessing a his
torical turning point as sudden and
important as any before, and the les
sons of the European mistakes
absolutely must not be lost on the
rest of the world.
