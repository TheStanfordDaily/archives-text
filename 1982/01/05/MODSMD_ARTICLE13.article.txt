## Youth emulate elders' distorted values 
### 
Washington — Moral bankruptcy
among American youth has been a
popular topic since a half-dozen Cal
ifornia teenagers viewed a
classmate's leaf-strewn corpse last
month but chose not to inform the
authorities. In addition to bewilder
ing the residents of Milpitas, this
striking case of student apathy has
led observers to name the usual sus
pects: drugs, television, sexual per
missiveness and divorce.
There's no mistake about the facts:
Jacques Broussard, 16, strangled his
girlfriend, Marcy Conrad, 14, and
dumped her body in a gully. For sev
eral days afterwards, classmates pa
raded by the corpse to verify
Broussard's claim of murder. Not
only did the teenagers tamper with
the corpse, (taking pieces of her
clothing), they tacitly vowed to keep
the matter secret.
Though the Santa Clara County
Court hasn't yet tried Broussard, the
public has already handed in its ver
dict: American youth has fallen to a
moral low.

But before we join the chorus of
last rites for a supposedly amoral and
valueless generation, it is unfair to
suggest that these kids are no less
twisted than their elders. For exam
ple, in Chicago alone last week:
• Marie Paulausky, 65, was robbed
and beaten on a public bus at high
noon while 35 passengers looked on.
• Another 35 passengers fled a pub
lic bus two days later after one pas
senger reportedly knifed Sidoria
Cervantes, 25, in the neck (one man,
a pastor, stayed behind, saving the
victim's life).
• On yet another bus that day, two
teenagers only avoided serious injury
at the hands of an attacker by
scrambling from the vehicle. Noone,
including the driver, helped them
either.
• The following morning, another
rider, Sherri Washington, 17, was
stabbed twice while fellow riders
looked away.
It's too bad these incidents didn't
come from a behavioral psy
chologist's textbook. Each, in fact,
came from the pages of the Chicago

Sun-Times. When taken together,
they help put the Milpitas tragedy in
perspective.
Social negligence by adults isn't
limited to witnessing crimes in
progress. More serious is our deep
seated nonchalance toward lending
a hand. Last week at a dinner party
here, our associate Michael Duffy
heard some of Wasington's brightest
young lawyers and professionals
belittle destitute vagrants and conve
nience store robberies in their neigh;
borhood.
"Joan asked me to pick up a pound
of butter before coming over to
night," confessed one woman. "But
when I walked in the Stop and Co
store, the manager was being robbed
at gunpoint. I'm so used to it, I just
turned around and walked out."
We weren't surprised to learn the
woman also hadn't bothered to call
the police afterwards.
Unfortunately, widespread ir
responsibility raises the question of
who's more delinquent: criminals or
bystanders who act like zombies.
While we're not suggesting that

people tangle with gun-toting
crazies, moral mindlessness among
young Americans won't improve as
long as older folks live by the same
rules.
Though citizen's obligations will
be debated indefinitely, it's certain
that an individual's freedoms come
only with a good dose of responsi
bilities. We all have a right to turn
away and let someone else deal with
trouble. But at the same time, we
have an obligation to see that the del
icate fabric of society doesn't un
ravel. And sometimes that requires
getting involved.
This week we're bound to read
countless stories about "Good
Samaritans" who saved the day or
helped out someone in crisis. Soon,
however, these reports will lose their
news value until next Christmas.
Such may be an indication of our un
willingness to learn the lessons of
Milpitas.
