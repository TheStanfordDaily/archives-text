## Berlin wall keeps outsideworld in focus 
### 
Everyone knows that there is an ex
tremely real wall around West Berlin.
However, not everyone realizes that
if you don't think about the wall, it
disappears. I became aware of this
metaphysical phenomenon the oth
er day during a conversation with my
landlady.
We were talking about Gurus, lef
tists, and how the youth in general
these days are so degenerate and
lazy. I of course expressed my awe
before the fact that I myself, despite
my age, do not spend much time
thinking about how to overthrow
"the" government, nor taking
strange drugs in order to liberate my
inner self from the external (and ir
relevant) pressures of the world:
At this point in our conversation,
my landlady gently pointed out that
my having come to Berlin to study, as
opposed to Hamburg or Munich, im
plies the moral responsibility of com

ing to terms with the history of this
place and of understanding what has
been and is going on here. With
these remarks came a fully
documented lecture on Berlin —
before, during and after World War II
— with a stress on the Berlin Air Lift,
and finally the building of the wall.
My landlady was right, I had not been
thinking about the wall lately.
The (sad) fact is that it's very easy to
get absorbed in the culture — opiate
of West Berlin, generously provided
by West Germany, and forget where
one is and how one got here. This
"phasing-out" syndrome would
seem particularly prevalent in
walled-in West Berlin; however, in a
very philosophical sense, every state
has a "wall" around it, and people
usually are not very aware of it.
People arp used to their area, their
people, their customs; and not ev
eryone feels the need to go out into

the world beyond the wall and ex
plore. The fact is people don't always
need a real wall to keep them from
leaving their home environment. A
lot of West Berliners — particularly
the younger generation brought up
with the presence of the wall — have
only been to East Berlin a couple of
times — for many, the same is true of
West Germany! They feel completely
content living in their alloted space.
The question that remains is: is it at
all worthwhile to think about the wall
and things beyond it anyway? If one
is happy where one is at, why bother
with concerns not relevant to daily
life? There is in such an approach to
world-scope problems a luring ap
peal. After all, it's not only the wall,
which can disappear metaphysically
when we refuse to perceive it. The
same is true of President Ronald Rea
gan, Soviet Premier Leonid
Brezhnev and the Pope.

Coffee in class
Who are these people who drink
coffee in class? They jot down notes
so smugly. Every few minutes, they
slowly raise the steaming styrofoam
cup to their lips, sssssssip a little cof
fee, say "Ahhh," reflect dreamily on
God knows what, then resume
notetaking. They drive me crazy.
Can't they stay awake in class? Are
they trying to look serious? Are these
people grad students?
I think this should stop. These cof
fee drinkers are insulting their pro
fessors by implying that they need a
stimulant to effectively concentrate,
and they themselves should be bro
ken of their insidiouscaffeinecrutch.
You know who you are.
