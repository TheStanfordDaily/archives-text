## Absolutely no room for absolutists 
### 
"They always says the show must
go on, but they never say why. Well,
right now, the show must not go on."
— Kermit the Frog
From time to time, I read that peo
ple must have an objective, absolute
standard of morality. The latest such
declaration was Andy Hartwell's
Viewpoint (Daily, Dec. 2). He and the
other absolutes I've read fail to give
any convincing reasons supporting
their stand, instead playing on peo
ple's ingrained and unexamined con
tempt for subjectivity with phrases
like "arbitrary choice" and "personal
whim." Once we stop chasing the
phantom of objectivity, we see that
their arguments are empty, and we
start to wonder if perhaps people
must not have an absolute standard
of morality.
Hartwell writes, "For any value to
have significance, it must have a
source outside of some person's arbi
trary choice." What about his own
"arbitrary choice" to value obe
dience to God? In what sense is this
less arbitrary than my choice to value

caring about others? He also claims
that we have no basis other than
"personal whim" for our view that
Martin Luther King, Jr. was morally
superior to Charles Manson. This is
ridiculous.
King dedicated his life to fighting
injustice and relieving suffering,
while Manson caused hideous mi
sery for his own perverse grat
ification; therefore, King was morally
superior to Manson. This is as com
plete and satisfying as any answer
that invokes God. Absolutists may, if
they like, denounce as "personal
whim" our judgment that segrega
tion was unjust or our abhorrence of
unnecessary suffering, but their
name-calling does not in any way
cheapen our values.
A standard absolutist argument
that Hartwell, to his credit, does not
use is the time-worn accusation that,
without absolute morality, we have
no right to prevent murder. What this
means, of course, is that we have no
absolute right to prevent murder.
This is no more distressing to a moral
personalist than the fact that we have
no unicorns in the National Zoo. If
we don't hunger for what doesn't ex
ist, then we needn't resort to
absolutism to create it.
Absolutism is not merely unneces
sary for morality; it is harmful to it in
several ways. Any absolute standard
of justice is bound to be either too
vague to be useful or too rigid to be
humane; there is no middle-ground
between these alternatives (though
there is plenty of overlap). Absolute
morality tends to call forth notions of
absolute enforcement, like heaven
and hell.
These deny the existence of un
redressed injustice and divert peo

ple's attention from the actual world
(e.g., Christians who spend theirtime
praising the Lord when they could be
loving their fellow human beings).
They also degrade moral behavior to
mere obedience and make morality
contingent on belief in some
mythological after-life. What could
be less moving than morality that is
inspired only by a smug belief in
eternal reward (and eternal pun
ishment for others)?
Personal morality promotes humil
ity — we don't claim to have the
whole universe on our side — but
absolutism promotes remoreseless
ness (e.g., the Inquisition, Khomeini,
the "Moral" Majority). Absolutists all
have total faith in their own dogmas,
and they never seem to wonder why
so many other people have the same
total faith in different dogmas. They
all claim to have the inside scoop on
absolute truth, even though their
"proof" for this claim is just like the
"proof" of millions of people who
disagree with them.
Absolutists seem to find objective
morality intrinsically valuable. They
should simply admit this and stop
trying to pass absolutism off as neces
sary for morality. They should also try
to realize what they lose by being so
certain.
I stand with the absolutists in
deploring selfishness. We can con
trol our limitless greed not by trying
to somehow convince ourselves that
restraint now will lead to boundless
rewards when we die, but rather by
ceasing to subordinate our personal
moral values to the pursuit of objec
tive measures of success like money,
status, and power.
