## 'Malice' hurt by Field's absence of personality 
### 
Visually, Absence of Malice, which Sydney Pollack
directed and Owen Roizman photographed, is flat and
conventional, and Kurt Luedtke's script lacks punch, too.
The story, an indictment of irresponsible journalism and
insidious methods of criminal investigation, is perfectly
plausible. When the leaderof the longshoremen's union
disappears, Elliot Rosen, the Justice Department's or
ganized crime strike force chief (Bob Balaban), is con
vinced that Michael Gallagher (Paul Newman), the son
of the missing man's arch-enemy, a one-time bootleg
ger, is somehow implicated. He lets a crime beat journal
ist named Megan Carter (Sally Field) do his investigating
for him: he plants a file on Gallagher where Megan will
find it, and she prints a story about him. He is blameless;
he was in Atlantic City when the disappearance oc
curred, taking care of a childhood friend who was having
an abortion. The nervous, unstable girl, Teresa (Melinda
Dillon), contacts Megan to tell her of Michael's in
nocence and clear his name, but, terrified of the reaction

of her Catholic family and her employer, the principal of
a convent school, she begs Megan not to reveal her iden
tity; Megan does and Teresa commits suicide.
The movie has the virtue of straightforwardness: the
narrative is coherent, effect following cause with the in
evitability of a soundly worked out detective thriller.
What is missing is the possibility of contradiction.
Luedtke and Pollack don't ask us to weigh the issues;
they've already decided who's to blame and how Rosen
and Megan should have behaved. Megan's editor (Josef
Sommer) tries to comfort her when she learns of Teresa's
death, assuring her, "It's not your fault," but we in the

audience argue silently, "Yes, it is"; there's no doubt in
our minds. Megan, too, arrives at the same conclusion at
the end of the film, when she tells Gallagher, "There's
nothing wrong with the work I do. I just did it badly."
Megan never seems to be struggling with dilemmas;
she acts with full confidence, always, and her action is
always ill-advised — until she finally learns her lesson
and saves a friend's job by refusing to identify him as her
source. If the movie allowed us to feel that Megan's tac
tics are justified — which is not difficult to imagine since,
divorced from the emotional setting of the story, this re
porter's performance doesn't seem to be shockingly in
competent or even unusual — and debated their merit in
light of the explosion they precipitate, Absence of Mal
ice might be provocative and unsettling and poignant.
But Pollack and Luedtke don't let us discover anything
for ourselves; it's a pre-sifted movie.
The opening credits are laid over shots of computers
printing out headlines and stories being pasted up, while
Dave Grusin's sprightly near-march musiczings along on
the soundtrack. We click into the vivifying newspaper
world we recognize from Blessed Event and The Luck of
Ginger Coffey and all the film versions of The Front Page;
it's a stirringly edited sequence. But it'sjustabout the last
fun this movie permits us. Absence of Malice has been
structured like a morality play, and that kills the enjoy
ment we might have taken in its sensational story — and
since we've been denied any intellectual excitement, re
moving the simpler pleasures of melodrama too is a real
cheat. The on!/ flourish in the film is the way Bob
Balaban plays Elliot Rosen. Bobbing about the room like
an owl on methedrine, chewing gum and wrapping
elastic bands around and around his hands as if prepar
ing some intricate magic trick, using a Damon Runyon
New York accent, Balaban might have stepped out of a
1930s Warner Brothers picture.
If Bob Balaban suggests one direction in which the
movie might have gone, Paul Newman represents the
other. His Michael Gallagher — shrewd but decent, pas
sionate, capable of violence and tenderness — is the only
real substance in the movie. Like Murphy, the cop New
man played in last winter's Fort Apache, the Bronx,
Gallagher is charmingly old-fashioned about women —
a man the feminist movement has left behind. (He also
betrays the prejudices of his urban Irish background.)
His relationship with Megan, which blooms mysteriously
into a romance, baffles this forceful, unaffected woman

who can't quite figure out why she is drawn to such a
shamelessly conservative man. Luedtke may have con
cocted their love affair purely for plot purposes, but
Newman gives Gallagher such warmth that we aren't as
surprised as Megan is.
Unfortunately, the pivotal role in Absence of Malice is
Megan, not Michael. The movie might have been re
deemed if Sally Field had supplied Megan with some
depth, but she gives a bland, unnuanced performance.
It's the only time I've seen Field since her TV sitcom days
when I've had the impression that she was still stuck in
one; the best part of her acting here is her timing in
scenes like her first encounter with Michael, when she
spills coffee all over her desk, and her comic realization

that his choice to take her to lunch on his boat has effec
tively dismissed the photographer who has been shad
owing them in the hope of snapping Michael. In the dra
matic scenes, she is as flat as the linesshe has to read. Sal
ly Field is a strange actress; she seems to be totally lacking
in subtlety, yet when she's at her most vivid — in Norma
Rae or communicating the hysteria of a new widow in
the recent TV movie All the Way Home — her intensity is
powerful enough to pull us right into the emotional
maelstrom of the character she's playing. She is always
believable, but that isn't enough for a leading actress; in
this movie, which is fueled on nothing but believeability,
it's practically a negative virtue. Absence of Malice needs
