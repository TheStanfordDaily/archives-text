# Lake Lag will fill in 10 days
## Rains close local roads, threaten floods 
### Richard Klingler 
Last night's storm washed out Uni
versity area roads, stranded automo
biles and downed telephone lines as
police watched the swelling San
Francisquito Creek to determine
whether area residents needed to be
evacuated.
Evacuation was most likely near the
Chaucer Street bridge dividing Palo
Alto and Menlo Park. By 10:30 p.m.,
the creek had risen high enough to
push against the bridge itself. Police
cleared the bridge and stood ready
with sand bags to block the rising wa
ter.
One Menlo Park police officer
said, "The chance of evacuation is
slight now, but if it happens, it'll be
around two o'clock in the morning."

He predicted that areas of Menlo
Park near Pope Street were most like
ly to be evacuated.
Officers expected the bridge to
survive the storm intact because
there were "no cracks at all yet," ac
cording to one officer surveying the
flooding.
Other policemen blamed the
creek's height on the University's wa
ter policies.
Officials of the University Dept. of
Facilities and Services decided to
open the floodgates to Searsville
Lake at approximately 4:30
p.m.yesterday because the lake was
"overflowing over the top of the
gate," according to Jason Mavis, di
rector of Facilities and Services. "The
water wasn't flowing out fast enough
to prevent the lake from overflowing

a county road."
Responding to charges that the de
cision to open the gates swelled the
creek, Mavis said, "with this kind of
rain, (opening the Searsville Lake
gates) may have increased the flow
on the San Francisquito, but there
would have been very little dif
ference."
The water from the lake will fill
Lake Lagunita, which will remain full
through the spring.
San Francisquito Creek over
flowed near a bridge by the intersec
tion of Woodland and Newell Roads,
and only a concrete retaining wall
held the water away from the nearby
streets.
San Mateo County workers and
California Highway Patrolmen
watched the water rise at the Univer
sity Avenue bridge overthe San Fran

cisquito Creek as well. Water Depart
ment workers had told the pa
trolmen they didn't know whether
the bridge would be threatened. A
woman standing next to the retaining
wall pointed to the water that had ex
ceeded the creek's banks and said, "I
was picking berries right there the
other day."
One hundred yards away, a tree
whose roots had washed away top
pled telephone lines, blocking the
road.
On campus, University police used
flares and saw horses to narrow Palm
Drive to a single lane. Water blocked
sections of Galvez Avenue and
smaller streets.
At least a dozen University workers
were on duty to react to problems
created by the storm, according to

Lake Menlo Park
Rain, rain and more rain fell on Stanford and the Bay Area yesterday, swamping cars, flooding homes and getting everything wet. But don't
break out the ark yet; the skies are expected to clear a bit this afternoon.
Mavis. "Everybody's on call tonight.
This is the worst rainfall in many,
many years." The only reports of
damage so far were reports of minor
leaks, he said.
Large areas of Menlo Park and Palo
Alto were sectioned off as water as
deep as two and one-half feet
stranded motorists and flooded in
tersections. Roadblocks and flares
stopped traffic on streches of such
major roads as El Camino Real and
Middlefield Road.

Water between one and two and
one-half feet deep covered several
hundred yards of El Camino Real
north of University Avenue, closing
the southbound lanes to traffic. Resi
dents walked home through the
knee-deep water in front of the Oasis
Beer Garden in Menlo Park. A block
away, tow trucks pulled cars past the
Beacon Gas station, where gas pumps
were half-submerged in water. Emp
ty, stalled cars and roadblocks closed
Middlefield Road near the Atherton
city limits.

Last night's storm washed out Uni
versity area roads, stranded automo
biles and downed telephone lines as
police watched the swelling San
Francisquito Creek to determine
whether area residents needed to be
evacuated.
Evacuation was most likely near the
Chaucer Street bridge dividing Palo
Alto and Menlo Park. By 10:30 p.m.,
the creek had risen high enough to
push against the bridge itself. Police
cleared the bridge and stood ready
with sand bags to block the rising wa
ter.
One Menlo Park police officer
said, "The chance of evacuation is
slight now, but if it happens, it'll be
around two o'clock in the morning."

He predicted that areas of Menlo
Park near Pope Street were most like
ly to be evacuated.
Officers expected the bridge to
survive the storm intact because
there were "no cracks at all yet," ac
cording to one officer surveying the
flooding.
Other policemen blamed the
creek's height on the University's wa
ter policies.
Officials of the University Dept. of
Facilities and Services decided to
open the floodgates to Searsville
Lake at approximately 4:30
p.m.yesterday because the lake was
"overflowing over the top of the
gate," according to Jason Mavis, di
rector of Facilities and Services. "The
water wasn't flowing out fast enough
to prevent the lake from overflowing

a county road."
Responding to charges that the de
cision to open the gates swelled the
creek, Mavis said, "with this kind of
rain, (opening the Searsville Lake
gates) may have increased the flow
on the San Francisquito, but there
would have been very little dif
ference."
The water from the lake will fill
Lake Lagunita, which will remain full
through the spring.
San Francisquito Creek over
flowed near a bridge by the intersec
tion of Woodland and Newell Roads,
and only a concrete retaining wall
held the water away from the nearby
streets.
San Mateo County workers and
California Highway Patrolmen
watched the water rise at the Univer
sity Avenue bridge overthe San Fran

cisquito Creek as well. Water Depart
ment workers had told the pa
trolmen they didn't know whether
the bridge would be threatened. A
woman standing next to the retaining
wall pointed to the water that had ex
ceeded the creek's banks and said, "I
was picking berries right there the
other day."
One hundred yards away, a tree
whose roots had washed away top
pled telephone lines, blocking the
road.
On campus, University police used
flares and saw horses to narrow Palm
Drive to a single lane. Water blocked
sections of Galvez Avenue and
smaller streets.
At least a dozen University workers
were on duty to react to problems
created by the storm, according to

Lake Menlo Park
Rain, rain and more rain fell on Stanford and the Bay Area yesterday, swamping cars, flooding homes and getting everything wet. But don't
break out the ark yet; the skies are expected to clear a bit this afternoon.
Mavis. "Everybody's on call tonight.
This is the worst rainfall in many,
many years." The only reports of
damage so far were reports of minor
leaks, he said.
Large areas of Menlo Park and Palo
Alto were sectioned off as water as
deep as two and one-half feet
stranded motorists and flooded in
tersections. Roadblocks and flares
stopped traffic on streches of such
major roads as El Camino Real and
Middlefield Road.

Water between one and two and
one-half feet deep covered several
hundred yards of El Camino Real
north of University Avenue, closing
the southbound lanes to traffic. Resi
dents walked home through the
knee-deep water in front of the Oasis
Beer Garden in Menlo Park. A block
away, tow trucks pulled cars past the
Beacon Gas station, where gas pumps
were half-submerged in water. Emp
ty, stalled cars and roadblocks closed
Middlefield Road near the Atherton
city limits.
