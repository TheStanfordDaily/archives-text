Watching Keith jarrett per
form can be a striking ex
perience for those unfamiliar
with his eccentricities and his
iconoclastic concert hall be
havior. Even before beginning
the performance, Jarrett typi
cally addresses several caustic
comments to his audience
("Please do all your coughing
now before I begin"), but
when he seats himself before
the piano, his peculiarities be
come even more apparent.
Once the music begins, Jarrett
remains in constant motion —
his fingers stay poised over the
keys, but his small wiry frame
sways in rhythm. Throughout
the concert he continues to
play in a bizarre crouch, half
standing and half-sitting, occa
sionally breaking the spell by
practically crawling into the pi
ano to pluck the strings.
Obviously much of this is
lost, perhaps to most people's
relief, in Jarrett's recordings.
Nonetheless, those familiar
with Jarrett's output only
through his recordings have
often found them equally mys
tifying. Refusing to let his talent

grow stagnant in established
jazz genres, Jarrett has tried his
hand, with mixed success, at an
unbelievable variety of musical
forms. In addition to his many
solo and group recordings, he
has released albums of ex
tended orchestral works, organ
music, soprano saxophone
performances, and even a disc,
now long out of print, of Jarrett
attempting to sing folk songs in
a Bob Dylan vein.
Perhaps the most fruitful
area of all for Jarrett has been
his work with the now dis
banded American quartet. This
group, featuring saxophonist
Dewey Redman, bassist Charlie
Haden, and drummer Paul Mo
tian was Jarrett's working band
for most of the mid-'7os. The
musicians in thisgroupseemed
much more willing to
challenge Jarrett and to push
him into new areas of musical
expression than do his more
recent cohorts. His newer Eu
ropean group has developed
into a vehicle to feature Jarrett,
and despite the clear talent of
its leader, it lacks much of the
subtle musical interplay char
acteristic of the earlier quartet.
Impulse Records has recent
ly issued a double album com
pilation of the best of Jarrett's
work with the American
quartet. The set, released un
der the name Great Moments

With Keith Jarrett, provides the
listener with an overview of
some of Jarrett's best ensemble
work. True, the album features
only one facet of Jarrett's music
(despite the "greatest hits"
pretensions), but it remains an
essential acquisition for the
jazz connoisseur who does not
possess the original recordings
of the quartet.
One almost hesitates to use
the word "jazz" in reference to
the music discussed here. Per
haps it is more accurate to view
the group's output as im
provisational chamber music.
The stock cliches of jazz are
abandoned, and newer, more
complex compositions replace
the standard song form.
The beauty of Jarrett's work
is no doubt enhanced by the
quality of his sidemen. Bassist
Charlie Haden has long dis
played a concern with purity of
tone which borders on a fetish;
since his earliest work with Or
nette Coleman and Denny
Zeitlin, Haden has consistently
produced the most strikingly
lovely bass sound I have ever
heard. This obsession is com
plemented by his distinctly
musical ear which has the rare
ability to zero in on the very
center of the note, and by his
instrument, one of the most ex
pressive (and expansive) that
one can find.

Drummer Paul Motian is
equally noteworthy. In his ear
ly work with pianist Bill Evans,
Motian developed a complete
ly different approach to the use
of drums in jazz. Truly a group
musician, Motian saw the
drums as only one part of a
group's rhythmic drive — a
part which must be enhanced
by the other musicians; and
because of this approach his
playing has always been able to
maintain a high level of com
plexity while remaining
elusively subtle. Like Haden,
he is extremely concerned
about sound quality, and has
been able, at least to my ears, to
extract the most expressive
sound from the cymbals of any

jazz drummer.
But it is Jarrett who is the
guiding light of this group.
With one exception all of the
compositions featured on the
album are his. In his work
"Mysteries," for example, he
attempts what most jazz musi
cians would find nearly im
possible — he develops a
lengthy group piece which is
taken entirely at a rubato tem
po; in other words, there is no
precise beat, but only the sug
gestion of a tempo which de
pends upon the intuition of the
musicians. Yet the effect is
achieved so naturally that the
listener is never aware of any
thing "experimental" being

done. The beauty of the music
seems to depend on this un
inhibited musical flow.
On "Everything that Lives
Laments," Jarrett gives us one
of his finest solos ever. The
piece, which begins at a dirge
tempo, breaks midway into a
medium tempo swing which
ties Jarrett more directly into
the jazz tradition. Those famil
iar with an earlier recording by
jarrett of this piece will be
struck by how he has taken a
composition of only limited
quality and developed it into
one of his finest performances.
Still there are omissions in
the compilation that an avid

Jarrett fan would like to see
made up. First, one of Jarrett's
longish compositions, such as
"Death and the Flower,"
would have given the listener
an idea of how jarrett handles
extended forms. Also, selec
tions from some of Jarrett's
finest albums with this group,
Byahlue and Treasure Island,
have, much to my disappoint
ment, not been included.
All things considered, the
album has many high points
and very few low ones. As Jar
rett continues to develop in
new directions, these re
markable recordings can serve
to remind usof the significance
of what he has already
achieved.
