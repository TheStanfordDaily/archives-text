Europe won't help, won't hurt
Brussels, Belgium — Ten Western European
governments promised yesterday they won't
undermine economic sanctions the United
States imposed on the Soviet Union following
declaration of martial law in Poland.
But the Common Market countries failed to
reach agreement on their own unified response
to the situation in Poland.
Foreign ministers of the 10 Common Market
countries issued a declaration pledging to
"avoid any step which could compromise,"
anti-Soviet sanctions announced last week by
President Ronald Reagan, who said the Soviet
Union was responsible for martial law in Po
land.
The promise was aimed at assuring the United
States that European countries would not fill the
gap in sales of high technology equipment or
other items on a list of goods Reagan banned
for export to the Soviet Union.
The Common Market made similar pledges
in 1980 when the United States imposed sanc
tions on Iran and cut grain sales to the Soviet
Union to protest the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan.
"Europe will do nothing in any area that
might undermine the action of other coun
tries," said Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tin
demans, as spokesman for the 10 ministers.
He said the ministers met privately for seven
hours to discuss the possibility of imposing their
own commercial restrictions on the Soviet
Union and cutting off food and financial aid to
Poland. But the governments of Britain and
West Germany already had formally opposed
economic sanctions as ineffective.
They agreed for the first time as a group, how
ever, with the U.S. analysis that the Soviet Union
is involved in the crackdown, along with East
bloc members of the Warsaw Pact military al
liance.
Polish factories reopened
Polish radio said yesterday that reopened fac
tories were functioning normally, butsaid noth
ing of the situation at Gdansk where two at
tempts to resume production at several in
dustrial plants were postponed.
Teachers holding high school classes for the
first time since martial law was declared Dec. 13
were told yesterday not to engage in debates
with students about the military crackdown.
The Communist Party and government of
ficials meanwhile were considering the "tasks"
of Poland's universities. The universities re
mained shuttered, apparently because of ap
prehension about allowing students with sym
pathy for the suspended Solidarity union to
gather at their schools.
In other developments yesterday:
—Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski met in War
saw with ambassadors from the Warsaw Pact
countries, then met with eight diplomats of
Common Market nations. In the latter session,
Radio Warsaw said, Jaruzelski stressed "the im
portance of the economic and trade exchanges
between East and West for the consolidation of
European peace."
—In Brussels, the Common Market foreign
ministers reiterated their concern about "re
pression" in Poland. They saidthey will do noth
ing to undermine the U.S. sanctions against Po
land and the Soviet Union, but presently plan
no retaliation of their own.

Belgium's foreign minister, Leo Tindemans,
said the ministers got a report on the "tragic"
meeting between the envoys and Jaruzelski,
but would not elaborate. The Dutch foreign
minister said he was pessmistic about the
chance that martial law would be lifted soon.
—Radio Warsaw said normal telephone and
telex services, suspended nationwide since
Dec. 13, would be restored today in 10 prov
inces where"public order" had improved. Four
of the provinces border the Soviet Union or
Czechoslovakia and three are near Warsaw.
Schmidt arrives in Washington
Washington — Reagan administration of
ficials will urge West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt today to help make sure that
the Polish crisis does not split the United States
and its European allies.
The officials said that the United States, in
talks beginning today between Schmidt and the
Reagan administration, will emphasize its belief
thatthe Soviet Union has been trying to turn the
crisis to its advantage and drive a wedge be
tween the allies.
The officials noted, for instance, that
messages from the Kremlin to Washington re
garding the crisis had been negative and bellig
erent, while a much softer tone was adopted in
Soviet messages to Schmidt's West German
government.
Schmidt, who arrived here yesterday, met
briefly with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in
preparation for talks today with President
Ronald Reagan, Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, other
policy-level officials and key members of Con
gress.
"The last thing we need is to turn the crisis in
Poland — a crisis provoked by the Soviet Union
— into a crisis within the Western community,"
a senior administration official told reporters
today. "That is not our intention, and it is not
the intention of the Federal Republic of Germa
ny."
Schmidt's visit here was planned well before
the Dec. 13 martial-law crackdown in Poland,
but officials now see it as a high-visibility op
portunity to smooth differences between the
Reagan administration's view that the Soviet's
prompted the crackdown and Schmidt's stand
that the events in Poland took place without So
viet interference.
Nuclear energy support low
Washington — The Reagan administration's
policy of strongly supporting nuclear power
while dismantling many government conserva
tion programs is unlikely to attract widespread
public support and may actually be solidifying
opposition to nuclear power, a new Washing
ton State University study suggests.
"Devoting major efforts toward nuclear
power at the expense of conservation may very
well prolong the high level of opposition to nu
clear power," according to researchers Eugene
Rosa and Marvin Olsen.
Based upon an extensive survey of attitudes
in the Western states and a review of trends in
recent national polls, they concluded that the
public climate for nuclear expansion is less fa
vorable now than at any time since the period
immediately following the 1979 accident at
Three Mile Island.
And, they noted, the administration's pro

posal to speed up licensing of nuclear plants
flies in the face of increasing local opposition to
such plants.
In general, they found a "low level" of sup
port for nuclear power and a "high level" of
support for conservation and suggested that a
policy that "makes room for both options"
might be more successful.
Mubarak swears in cabinet
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak swore in an expanded new cabinet
yesterday that embodied relatively few changes
mainly aimed at reexaminating the economic
policies of the late President Anwar Sadat.
Prime Minister Fouad Mohieddin chose only
12 new faces to join him in the34-member cabi
net. Nine ministers were dismissed and several,
including the once-powerful Interior Minister
Nabawi Ismail, were shifted to other jobs. The
previous cabinet had 32 members.
Sadat's entire economic team was replaced
by men who were described by a former min
ister as "classic, conservative economists, un
likely to make any drastic innovations."
Since Sadat's assassination, Mubarak has
complained that Egypt's economy had become
too dependent upon imported food and luxury
goods. Although Mubarak pledged to continue
the late president's open-door economic poli
cy, he said he would emphasize domestic in
vestment and production.
Following the swearing-in of the cabinet and
its first meeting with Mubarak as its chairman,
Mohieddin said, "We want a productive open
door policy. We are not against the open-door
perse, but for it not be in particular the things
the people here don't need . . . We welcome
foreign capital from anywhere, but our
priorities are to production needs."
However, foreign bankers and economists
here said they doubted that Mubarak's new ec
onomic team, led by the chairman of the Cen
tral Bank of Egypt Mohammed Abdul Fattah
Ibrahim would be able to conduct much more
than a holding operation until long-term stud
ies of Egypt's economic woes are completed
this winter.
Another former minister discribed the cabi
net shuffle as a holding operation, designed by
Mubarak to sweep out a handful of unpopular
figures, but generally to stand pat with the old
Sadat team and policies at least until April 25. At
that time Israel is scheduled to return the last of
the Sinai to Egyptian sovereignty.
Modest stock advance
New York — The stock market opened its
new year with a modest advance today, aided
by a late surge that gave the closely watched in
dustrial issues a substantial gain.
The market opened mostly higher but then
showed little change for most of the session in
relatively light activity. But in the last hour,
prices of industrials and other stocks picked up
new momentum and other stocks were able to
pare some of their early losses.
Today's weather
Heavy rain with a chance of thundershowers,
tapering off and ending tonight. Chance of rain
decreasing to 70 percent this morning and 20
percent this afternoon. Fair and colder Tuesday
night and Wednesday. High today in the 50s,
low in the 30s to 40s.

Mubarak swears in cabinet
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak swore in an expanded new cabinet
yesterday that embodied relatively few changes
mainly aimed at reexaminating the economic
policies of the late President Anwar Sadat.
Prime Minister Fouad Mohieddin chose only
12 new faces to join him in the34-member cabi
net. Nine ministers were dismissed and several,
including the once-powerful Interior Minister
Nabawi Ismail, were shifted to other jobs. The
previous cabinet had 32 members.
Sadat's entire economic team was replaced
by men who were described by a former min
ister as "classic, conservative economists, un
likely to make any drastic innovations."
Since Sadat's assassination, Mubarak has
complained that Egypt's economy had become
too dependent upon imported food and luxury
goods. Although Mubarak pledged to continue
the late president's open-door economic poli
cy, he said he would emphasize domestic in
vestment and production.
Following the swearing-in of the cabinet and
its first meeting with Mubarak as its chairman,
Mohieddin said, "We want a productive open
door policy. We are not against the open-door
perse, but for it not be in particular the things
the people here don't need . . . We welcome
foreign capital from anywhere, but our
priorities are to production needs."
However, foreign bankers and economists
here said they doubted that Mubarak's new ec
onomic team, led by the chairman of the Cen
tral Bank of Egypt Mohammed Abdul Fattah
Ibrahim would be able to conduct much more
than a holding operation until long-term stud
ies of Egypt's economic woes are completed
this winter.
Another former minister discribed the cabi
net shuffle as a holding operation, designed by
Mubarak to sweep out a handful of unpopular
figures, but generally to stand pat with the old
Sadat team and policies at least until April 25. At
that time Israel is scheduled to return the last of
the Sinai to Egyptian sovereignty.
Modest stock advance

relatively light activity. But in the last hour,
prices of industrials and other stocks picked up
new momentum and other stocks were able to
pare some of their early losses.

Europe won't help, won't hurt
Brussels, Belgium — Ten Western European
governments promised yesterday they won't
undermine economic sanctions the United
States imposed on the Soviet Union following
declaration of martial law in Poland.
But the Common Market countries failed to
reach agreement on their own unified response
to the situation in Poland.
Foreign ministers of the 10 Common Market
countries issued a declaration pledging to
"avoid any step which could compromise,"
anti-Soviet sanctions announced last week by
President Ronald Reagan, who said the Soviet
Union was responsible for martial law in Po
land.
The promise was aimed at assuring the United
States that European countries would not fill the
gap in sales of high technology equipment or
other items on a list of goods Reagan banned
for export to the Soviet Union.
The Common Market made similar pledges
in 1980 when the United States imposed sanc
tions on Iran and cut grain sales to the Soviet
Union to protest the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan.
"Europe will do nothing in any area that
might undermine the action of other coun
tries," said Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tin
demans, as spokesman for the 10 ministers.
He said the ministers met privately for seven
hours to discuss the possibility of imposing their
own commercial restrictions on the Soviet
Union and cutting off food and financial aid to
Poland. But the governments of Britain and
West Germany already had formally opposed
economic sanctions as ineffective.
They agreed for the first time as a group, how
ever, with the U.S. analysis that the Soviet Union
is involved in the crackdown, along with East
bloc members of the Warsaw Pact military al
liance.
Polish factories reopened
Polish radio said yesterday that reopened fac
tories were functioning normally, butsaid noth
ing of the situation at Gdansk where two at
tempts to resume production at several in
dustrial plants were postponed.
Teachers holding high school classes for the
first time since martial law was declared Dec. 13
were told yesterday not to engage in debates
with students about the military crackdown.
The Communist Party and government of
ficials meanwhile were considering the "tasks"
of Poland's universities. The universities re
mained shuttered, apparently because of ap
prehension about allowing students with sym
pathy for the suspended Solidarity union to
gather at their schools.
In other developments yesterday:
—Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski met in War
saw with ambassadors from the Warsaw Pact
countries, then met with eight diplomats of
Common Market nations. In the latter session,
Radio Warsaw said, Jaruzelski stressed "the im
portance of the economic and trade exchanges
between East and West for the consolidation of
European peace."
—In Brussels, the Common Market foreign
ministers reiterated their concern about "re
pression" in Poland. They saidthey will do noth
ing to undermine the U.S. sanctions against Po
land and the Soviet Union, but presently plan
no retaliation of their own.

Belgium's foreign minister, Leo Tindemans,
said the ministers got a report on the "tragic"
meeting between the envoys and Jaruzelski,
but would not elaborate. The Dutch foreign
minister said he was pessmistic about the
chance that martial law would be lifted soon.
—Radio Warsaw said normal telephone and
telex services, suspended nationwide since
Dec. 13, would be restored today in 10 prov
inces where"public order" had improved. Four
of the provinces border the Soviet Union or
Czechoslovakia and three are near Warsaw.
Schmidt arrives in Washington
Washington — Reagan administration of
ficials will urge West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt today to help make sure that
the Polish crisis does not split the United States
and its European allies.
The officials said that the United States, in
talks beginning today between Schmidt and the
Reagan administration, will emphasize its belief
thatthe Soviet Union has been trying to turn the
crisis to its advantage and drive a wedge be
tween the allies.
The officials noted, for instance, that
messages from the Kremlin to Washington re
garding the crisis had been negative and bellig
erent, while a much softer tone was adopted in
Soviet messages to Schmidt's West German
government.
Schmidt, who arrived here yesterday, met
briefly with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in
preparation for talks today with President
Ronald Reagan, Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, other
policy-level officials and key members of Con
gress.
"The last thing we need is to turn the crisis in
Poland — a crisis provoked by the Soviet Union
— into a crisis within the Western community,"
a senior administration official told reporters
today. "That is not our intention, and it is not
the intention of the Federal Republic of Germa
ny."
Schmidt's visit here was planned well before
the Dec. 13 martial-law crackdown in Poland,
but officials now see it as a high-visibility op
portunity to smooth differences between the
Reagan administration's view that the Soviet's
prompted the crackdown and Schmidt's stand
that the events in Poland took place without So
viet interference.
Nuclear energy support low
Washington — The Reagan administration's
policy of strongly supporting nuclear power
while dismantling many government conserva
tion programs is unlikely to attract widespread
public support and may actually be solidifying
opposition to nuclear power, a new Washing
ton State University study suggests.
"Devoting major efforts toward nuclear
power at the expense of conservation may very
well prolong the high level of opposition to nu
clear power," according to researchers Eugene
Rosa and Marvin Olsen.
Based upon an extensive survey of attitudes
in the Western states and a review of trends in
recent national polls, they concluded that the
public climate for nuclear expansion is less fa
vorable now than at any time since the period
immediately following the 1979 accident at
Three Mile Island.
And, they noted, the administration's pro

posal to speed up licensing of nuclear plants
flies in the face of increasing local opposition to
such plants.
In general, they found a "low level" of sup
port for nuclear power and a "high level" of
support for conservation and suggested that a
policy that "makes room for both options"
might be more successful.

pression" in Poland. They saidthey will do noth
ing to undermine the U.S. sanctions against Po
land and the Soviet Union, but presently plan
no retaliation of their own.

Belgium's foreign minister, Leo Tindemans,
said the ministers got a report on the "tragic"
meeting between the envoys and Jaruzelski,
but would not elaborate. The Dutch foreign
minister said he was pessmistic about the
chance that martial law would be lifted soon.
—Radio Warsaw said normal telephone and
telex services, suspended nationwide since
Dec. 13, would be restored today in 10 prov
inces where"public order" had improved. Four
of the provinces border the Soviet Union or
Czechoslovakia and three are near Warsaw.
Schmidt arrives in Washington
Washington — Reagan administration of
ficials will urge West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt today to help make sure that
the Polish crisis does not split the United States
and its European allies.
The officials said that the United States, in
talks beginning today between Schmidt and the
Reagan administration, will emphasize its belief
thatthe Soviet Union has been trying to turn the
crisis to its advantage and drive a wedge be
tween the allies.
The officials noted, for instance, that
messages from the Kremlin to Washington re
garding the crisis had been negative and bellig
erent, while a much softer tone was adopted in
Soviet messages to Schmidt's West German
government.
Schmidt, who arrived here yesterday, met
briefly with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in
preparation for talks today with President
Ronald Reagan, Vice President George Bush,
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, other
policy-level officials and key members of Con
gress.
"The last thing we need is to turn the crisis in
Poland — a crisis provoked by the Soviet Union
— into a crisis within the Western community,"
a senior administration official told reporters
today. "That is not our intention, and it is not
the intention of the Federal Republic of Germa
ny."
Schmidt's visit here was planned well before
the Dec. 13 martial-law crackdown in Poland,
but officials now see it as a high-visibility op
portunity to smooth differences between the
Reagan administration's view that the Soviet's
prompted the crackdown and Schmidt's stand
that the events in Poland took place without So
viet interference.
Nuclear energy support low
Washington — The Reagan administration's
policy of strongly supporting nuclear power
while dismantling many government conserva
tion programs is unlikely to attract widespread
public support and may actually be solidifying
opposition to nuclear power, a new Washing
ton State University study suggests.
"Devoting major efforts toward nuclear
power at the expense of conservation may very
well prolong the high level of opposition to nu
clear power," according to researchers Eugene
Rosa and Marvin Olsen.
Based upon an extensive survey of attitudes
in the Western states and a review of trends in
recent national polls, they concluded that the
public climate for nuclear expansion is less fa
vorable now than at any time since the period
immediately following the 1979 accident at
Three Mile Island.
And, they noted, the administration's pro

posal to speed up licensing of nuclear plants
flies in the face of increasing local opposition to
such plants.
In general, they found a "low level" of sup
port for nuclear power and a "high level" of
support for conservation and suggested that a
policy that "makes room for both options"
might be more successful.
Mubarak swears in cabinet
Cairo, Egypt — Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak swore in an expanded new cabinet
yesterday that embodied relatively few changes
mainly aimed at reexaminating the economic
policies of the late President Anwar Sadat.
Prime Minister Fouad Mohieddin chose only
12 new faces to join him in the34-member cabi
net. Nine ministers were dismissed and several,
including the once-powerful Interior Minister
Nabawi Ismail, were shifted to other jobs. The
previous cabinet had 32 members.
Sadat's entire economic team was replaced
by men who were described by a former min
ister as "classic, conservative economists, un
likely to make any drastic innovations."
Since Sadat's assassination, Mubarak has
complained that Egypt's economy had become
too dependent upon imported food and luxury
goods. Although Mubarak pledged to continue
the late president's open-door economic poli
cy, he said he would emphasize domestic in
vestment and production.
Following the swearing-in of the cabinet and
its first meeting with Mubarak as its chairman,
Mohieddin said, "We want a productive open
door policy. We are not against the open-door
perse, but for it not be in particular the things
the people here don't need . . . We welcome
foreign capital from anywhere, but our
priorities are to production needs."
However, foreign bankers and economists
here said they doubted that Mubarak's new ec
onomic team, led by the chairman of the Cen
tral Bank of Egypt Mohammed Abdul Fattah
Ibrahim would be able to conduct much more
than a holding operation until long-term stud
ies of Egypt's economic woes are completed
this winter.
Another former minister discribed the cabi
net shuffle as a holding operation, designed by
Mubarak to sweep out a handful of unpopular
figures, but generally to stand pat with the old
Sadat team and policies at least until April 25. At
that time Israel is scheduled to return the last of
the Sinai to Egyptian sovereignty.
Modest stock advance
New York — The stock market opened its
new year with a modest advance today, aided
by a late surge that gave the closely watched in
dustrial issues a substantial gain.
The market opened mostly higher but then
showed little change for most of the session in
relatively light activity. But in the last hour,
prices of industrials and other stocks picked up
new momentum and other stocks were able to
pare some of their early losses.
Today's weather
Heavy rain with a chance of thundershowers,
tapering off and ending tonight. Chance of rain
decreasing to 70 percent this morning and 20
percent this afternoon. Fair and colder Tuesday
night and Wednesday. High today in the 50s,
low in the 30s to 40s.

Europe won't help, won't hurt
Brussels, Belgium — Ten Western European
governments promised yesterday they won't
undermine economic sanctions the United
States imposed on the Soviet Union following
declaration of martial law in Poland.
But the Common Market countries failed to
reach agreement on their own unified response
to the situation in Poland.
Foreign ministers of the 10 Common Market
countries issued a declaration pledging to
"avoid any step which could compromise,"
anti-Soviet sanctions announced last week by
President Ronald Reagan, who said the Soviet
Union was responsible for martial law in Po
land.
The promise was aimed at assuring the United
States that European countries would not fill the
gap in sales of high technology equipment or
other items on a list of goods Reagan banned
for export to the Soviet Union.
The Common Market made similar pledges
in 1980 when the United States imposed sanc
tions on Iran and cut grain sales to the Soviet
Union to protest the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan.
"Europe will do nothing in any area that
might undermine the action of other coun
tries," said Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tin
demans, as spokesman for the 10 ministers.
He said the ministers met privately for seven
hours to discuss the possibility of imposing their
own commercial restrictions on the Soviet
Union and cutting off food and financial aid to
Poland. But the governments of Britain and
West Germany already had formally opposed
economic sanctions as ineffective.
They agreed for the first time as a group, how
ever, with the U.S. analysis that the Soviet Union
is involved in the crackdown, along with East
bloc members of the Warsaw Pact military al
liance.
Polish factories reopened
Polish radio said yesterday that reopened fac
tories were functioning normally, butsaid noth
ing of the situation at Gdansk where two at
tempts to resume production at several in
dustrial plants were postponed.
Teachers holding high school classes for the
first time since martial law was declared Dec. 13
were told yesterday not to engage in debates
with students about the military crackdown.
The Communist Party and government of
ficials meanwhile were considering the "tasks"
of Poland's universities. The universities re
mained shuttered, apparently because of ap
prehension about allowing students with sym
pathy for the suspended Solidarity union to
gather at their schools.
In other developments yesterday:
—Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski met in War
saw with ambassadors from the Warsaw Pact
countries, then met with eight diplomats of
Common Market nations. In the latter session,
Radio Warsaw said, Jaruzelski stressed "the im
portance of the economic and trade exchanges
between East and West for the consolidation of
European peace."
—In Brussels, the Common Market foreign
ministers reiterated their concern about "re
pression" in Poland. They saidthey will do noth
ing to undermine the U.S. sanctions against Po
land and the Soviet Union, but presently plan
no retaliation of their own.
