Staff lunch
Should old aquaintence be forgot,
come to the staff lunch on Thursday
at noon to remember them. And if
you want a memory boost early — by
the way we are a little short of staffers
this week — come by even sooner to

chat and work.
Spring fling
All current staffers and potential staf
fers interested in working in an edi
torial capacity for the next volume
should sign up before Wednesday
for a meeting with Richard, Julie and
loan. Meetings will be held this
week, Wednesday through Saturday,
to discuss your ideas and what you'd
like to do. Please bring your high
school SAT scores, a character refer
ence from your next-door neighbor
and a 1000-word essay on the topic,
"The one hundred most often mis
spelled words and why I think they
are misspelled." No, seriously, even
if you just want to discuss changes or
ideas you have for different depart
ments, please sign up to talk with us;
the only real requirement is en
thusiasm.
