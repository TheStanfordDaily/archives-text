Mark Kramer, a senior majoring
in political science and Slavic lan
guages, became one of the na
tion's 32 Rhodes Scholars during
the winter break.
Kramer won the coveted award,
which offers winners two-year
scholarships to Oxford University
in England, following an extensive
selection process in which he
competed with more than 250
other applicants from the Western
States Region, which includes Ari
zona, California, Colorado, Ha
waii, New Mexico, Nevada and
Utah.
He is the 42nd Stanford reci
pient of the award since 1947.
Kramer, who speaks Russian
fluently, plans to study Russian, in
ternational relations and modern
language and history.
Kramer was selected based on
his transcript, a letter of recom
mendation from a professor, a
1000-word essay and extra-cur
ricular achievements. The senior

has maintained a 4.0 average here,
and was an aide for Senator Ed
ward Kennedy in 1979-80. He
spent last summer writing a 200-
page paper on negotiations for
banning underground nuclear
testing.
"He was an extraordinarily

good student; he had one of those
rare analytical minds which causes
one to notice him," said Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall,
who wrote Kramer's recommen

dation. Kramer took Marshall's
"Major Issues of American Policy"
(Poli Sci 1) as a freshman.
At least one student per year is
chosen by the University to partic
ipate in the Rhodes Scholarship
competition. Marshall's recom
mendation helped Kramer to be
selected as the University's repre
sentative.
Marshall said, "He used to walk
with me after every class period
asking me questions. I was very
impressed with his intelligence.
We would discuss politics, and I
soon realized that he must read
over 20 periodicals every week,
and get very little sleep. He had a
tremendous enthusiasm for learn
ing and unusual energy."
Kramer said he was "surprised
and honored" when he heard of
his selection. He admitted, how
ever, that he will be "a little reluc
tant to leave Stanford."
