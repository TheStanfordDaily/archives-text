# New assistant provost for facilities named
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
Lynda Weisberg, formerly Univer
sity energy program manager, was
namedassistant provost for facilities
on Dec. 13 by Vice-Provost Raymond
Bacchetti.
Weisberg replaced Susan
Schofield, who resigned the office af
ter nine years of facilities-related
work. Schofield will remain here, but
her next post is undetermined.
In her new job, Weisberg is re
sponsible for ensuring that facilities
plans mesh with the University's
goals and long-range plans, Bacchetti
said. "Her perspective is to look at
how the University is put together in
terms of academic goals and to
ensure that facilities work to help
meet those goals." t
He said that while it is the Depart
ment of Facilities and Services that
does the actual physical planning of

facilities — which include both Uni
versity buildings and intrastructure
such as drains, sewers and parking
lots — it is Weisberg who ensures that
program needs are being met.
Weisberg described her responsi
biliiesas planning, monitoring and al
locating funds for the University's fa
cilities. She said she also serves as a
coordinator to bridge the gap be
tween the academic departments —
under the authority of Albert
Hastorf, vice president and provost
— and the departments who do the
actual designingand buildingoffacil
ities, which are responsible to the
Department of Business and Finance.
"The University has a building pro
gram," Weisberg said, "which mainly
stems forth the academic depart
ments which need certain facilities.
But they often have neither the ex
perience nor the knowledge to go
about developing their plan, I'm the
one who works with them to help

them get the work done."
In her new position, Weisberg will
also assist with day-to-day demands
from academic departments for facil
ities services. An example of such a
request, Weisberg said, would be
when a department needs to provide
office space for a new professor.
Weisberg currently participates in
the University's Management and
Development Program. About 30
people participate in this program,
which was initiated three years ago
by Bacchetti and Director of Per
sonnel Robert Parker. The program is
designed for middle-level managers
to acquaint them with particular op
erating procedures within the Uni
versity and to offer additional man
agement training to employees who
might lack a strong backround in
management.
As energy program manager,
Weisberg was responsible for initiat
ing three major programs designed

to cut energy costs here. They were:
•An energy retrofix of 17 Univer
sity buildings, starting with the Grad
uate School of Business, which alters
the way the buildings heat and cool
air.
•The monitoring of Pacific Gas &
Electric to increase the accuracy of
energy costs forecasts, as well as par
ticipating in PG&E's rate increase
hearings before the Public Utilities
Commission.
•Instituting building managers at
all 200 of the University's buildings
who are responsible for monitoring
and charting energy use within the
buildings.
Weisberg also recently designed a
multi-million dollar program de
signed to reduce the University's
energy consumption by 20-26 per
cent.
Her replacement as energy pro
gram director has not yet been
named.
