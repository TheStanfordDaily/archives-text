Norm Robinson, assistant dean of
residential education, met today with
members of the Delta Upsilon (DU)
fraternity, following the recovery of
21 pieces of allegedly stolen furniture
from the DU house on Dec. 30.
Robinson said he suggested that as
a first step the individuals involved
talk to the ASSU legal counsel "to try
to figure out what to do and try and
figure out how cooperative they
want to be." Robinson said, "The
more cooperative they are, the less
severe the penalty will be. That's my
guess."
Robinson also said that the stu
dents involved might want to think
about getting their own legal coun
sel, depending on the outcome of
discussions with the D.A.
Responding to a question about
his own role in the situation, Rob
inson said, "I don't think I'll have one
except to give advice to the guys in
the house and to try and be helpful
where I can. It's really a police mat
ter."
Before a full house meeting yester
day morning, Stanford Police Cap
tain Raoul Niemeyer, Robinson and
others met with the vice president
and president of the fraternity to dis
cuss "what had happened, what the
police had done, and what the future
process would be," according to
Robinson
"Niemeyer's main point was that if
we cooperate we can get this thing
settled soon," Wayne McKay, the
house president, said.
"The police said they wouldn't be
finished with the report until Thurs
day or Friday, at which time they will
file it with the D.A.'s office" McKay
said. "Niemeyer told me he would
not recommend anything in regard
to charges," Mckay said.
According to University news ser
vices, Niemeyer previously said he
would recommend to the D.A. felo
ny charges of possession of stolen
property.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said police would prefer to give the
furniture back to the University im
mediately, but added that they
would have to hold it as evidence.
In response to a question about
when search warrants might be used
in the future, Herrington said a war
rant would be obtained and used
whenever there is reason to believe
there is evidence that a crime has
been committed.
Regarding the discovery of less
than an ounce of marijuana and a
small piece of hashish in the process

of the search, Herrington agreed that
the amounts were small, but added,
"We're not going to ignore drugs."
McKay, Herrington and Niemeyer
all said they were not yet able to tell
the Daily how many individuals were
involved. However, Niemeyer said
that furniture was confiscated from
about 10 rooms.
"I have no idea exactly how many
were involved, but it was a small per
centage of the house,"'McKay said.
Another DU indicated that there
were approximately 21 rooms in the
house.
