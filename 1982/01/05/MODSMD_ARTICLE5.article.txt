Norm Robinson, assistant dean of
residential education, met today with
members of the Delta Upsilon (DU)
fraternity, following the recovery of
21 pieces of allegedly stolen furniture
from the DU house on Dec. 30.

house president, said.
"The police said they wouldn't be
finished with the report until Thurs
day or Friday, at which time they will
file it with the D.A.'s office" McKay
said. "Niemeyer told me he would
not recommend anything in regard

According to University news ser

property.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
