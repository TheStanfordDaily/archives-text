# Storm batters NorCal

### 
San Rafael (AP) — One of the most
devastating Pacific storms of the cen
tury flooded several thousand peo
ple from their homes in Northern
California last night, claiming at least
five lives, derailing trains and closing
highways.
The violent rains caused extensive
flooding in Marin and Sonoma coun
ties north of San Francisco. Officials
there said damage from flash floods,
mudslides and falling trees and rocks
could run in the millions of dollars.
One person in a house was killed
when it slid from its foundation in
nearby Tiburon, and four others also
reportedly died of storm-related
causes in the region, authorities said.
As the storm built toward a peak,
the National Weather Service re
ported that it dumped more than 8
inches of rain in Santa Cruz, the
greatest 24-hour rainfall since 1890
when record-keeping began.
Across the San Francisco Bay, 13
people were injured, none seriously,
at 3 p.m. when six cars of an eight-car
Amtrak train jumped flooded tracks
near Richmond in Contra Costa
County. No injuries were reported in
a Alder Point where a 10-car South
ern Pacific freight derailed.
The storm knocked out power
throughout the region, and left
125,000 people without power in
northern Santa Cruz County at 8:30
p.m., said Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
The California Highway Patrol
briefly closed the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge yesterday, fearing that
a dam on Standard Oil of California
property near the toll plaza could
break.
But the bridge was reopened when
the Highway Patrol found that the
dam posed no danger to the bridge.
Although the CHP at first said the
dam was above the toll plaza, CHP
spokesman Bob Williams said the
dam was below.
At Vallejo, northeast of San Fran
cisco, officials began evacuating at
least 500 people from houses and
mobile homes which lie below the
Lake Chabot reservoir. Earlier yester
day, the reservoir was near capacity,
forcing officials to open flood gates.
Water two feet deep then quickly

collected in low-lying areas.
People were evacuated from some
300 mobile homes in West Rohnert
Park in Sonoma County and about 50
houses were evacuated in Bodega,
"where there was water as high as the
second story on some homes," said
CHP Sgt. Wayne Calvert.
Marin County administrator John
Barrows said the county asked Gov.
Jerry Brown to declare an emer
gency. Approximately 25 National
Guard trucks and 50 guardsmen
helped evacuate Marin County resi
dents stranded in cars on flooded
highways or trapped in homes in
low-lying areas.
In Santa Cruz County, officials de
clared an emergency after the San
Lorenzo River defied its banks in San
ta Cruz, about 70 miles south of San
Francisco, said Michael Van De Veer
of the county Office on Emergency
Services.
"We've sandbagged this building
and are waiting to see what happens
during high tide tonight. Those who
believe in prayer have turned to
that," he said, adding that about 40
county roads have been closed by
floodwaters, mudslides, trees, rocks
and debris.
The California Highway Patrol set
up a roadblock at the northbound
toll plaza to screen motorists crossing
the Golden Gate Bridge yesterday af
ternoon and allowed only those
bound for southern Marin County to
pass.
"The traffic can come in, but
where's it to go?" CHP Officer Ed
Larson asked. "I haven't seen it this
bad in the 16 years I've been here."
"The city is under siege," San
Rafael Fire Chief Brian Waterbury
said, adding that firefighters re
ported mud and water racing
through the city's streets at more
than 30 mph.
Just over a foot of rain fell in Marin
County in a 20-hour period begin
ning Sunday, weather officials said.
The National Weather Service pre
dicted the rain would continue in a
steady downpour through last night,
then break up into showers early to
day with rain ending by this afer
noon.

Larson asked. "I haven't seen it this
bad in the 16 years I've been here."
"The city is under siege," San
Rafael Fire Chief Brian Waterbury

San Rafael (AP) — One of the most
devastating Pacific storms of the cen
tury flooded several thousand peo
ple from their homes in Northern
California last night, claiming at least
five lives, derailing trains and closing
highways.
The violent rains caused extensive
flooding in Marin and Sonoma coun
ties north of San Francisco. Officials
there said damage from flash floods,
mudslides and falling trees and rocks
could run in the millions of dollars.
One person in a house was killed
when it slid from its foundation in
nearby Tiburon, and four others also
reportedly died of storm-related
causes in the region, authorities said.
As the storm built toward a peak,
the National Weather Service re
ported that it dumped more than 8
inches of rain in Santa Cruz, the
greatest 24-hour rainfall since 1890
when record-keeping began.
Across the San Francisco Bay, 13
people were injured, none seriously,
at 3 p.m. when six cars of an eight-car
Amtrak train jumped flooded tracks
near Richmond in Contra Costa
County. No injuries were reported in
a Alder Point where a 10-car South
ern Pacific freight derailed.
The storm knocked out power
throughout the region, and left
125,000 people without power in
northern Santa Cruz County at 8:30
p.m., said Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
The California Highway Patrol
briefly closed the Richmond-San
Rafael Bridge yesterday, fearing that
a dam on Standard Oil of California
property near the toll plaza could
break.
But the bridge was reopened when
the Highway Patrol found that the
dam posed no danger to the bridge.
Although the CHP at first said the
dam was above the toll plaza, CHP
spokesman Bob Williams said the
dam was below.
At Vallejo, northeast of San Fran
cisco, officials began evacuating at
least 500 people from houses and
mobile homes which lie below the
Lake Chabot reservoir. Earlier yester
day, the reservoir was near capacity,
forcing officials to open flood gates.
Water two feet deep then quickly

collected in low-lying areas.
People were evacuated from some
300 mobile homes in West Rohnert
Park in Sonoma County and about 50
houses were evacuated in Bodega,
"where there was water as high as the
second story on some homes," said
CHP Sgt. Wayne Calvert.
Marin County administrator John
Barrows said the county asked Gov.
Jerry Brown to declare an emer
gency. Approximately 25 National
Guard trucks and 50 guardsmen
helped evacuate Marin County resi
dents stranded in cars on flooded
highways or trapped in homes in
low-lying areas.
In Santa Cruz County, officials de
clared an emergency after the San
Lorenzo River defied its banks in San
ta Cruz, about 70 miles south of San
Francisco, said Michael Van De Veer
of the county Office on Emergency
Services.
"We've sandbagged this building
and are waiting to see what happens
during high tide tonight. Those who
believe in prayer have turned to
that," he said, adding that about 40
county roads have been closed by
floodwaters, mudslides, trees, rocks
and debris.
The California Highway Patrol set
up a roadblock at the northbound
toll plaza to screen motorists crossing
the Golden Gate Bridge yesterday af
ternoon and allowed only those
bound for southern Marin County to
pass.
"The traffic can come in, but
where's it to go?" CHP Officer Ed
Larson asked. "I haven't seen it this
bad in the 16 years I've been here."
"The city is under siege," San
Rafael Fire Chief Brian Waterbury
said, adding that firefighters re
