## Ethiopian socialism launches campaigns for literacy, health 
### Washington Post 
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia —
"The revolution has let me go
to school," Yubnish, a former
prostitute, said simply when
asked what she thought of Ethi
opia's Marxist government.
Yubnish still lives in a dank,
one-room shack and does not
care about her country's shift
from feudal capitalism to so
cialism, but she proudly ex
hibited the Amharic-language
primers that she can now read
and told of her hopes to be
come a secretary.
"Before I could not read or
write," she said. "I was like a
baby. The revolution is good
because I go to school."
Yubnish, now attending
fourth grade and becoming lit
erate in English as well as
Amharic, is one of 5.5 million
Ethiopians who have become
literate since the 1974 revolu
tion deposing emperor Haile
Selassie. It is a social trans
formation almost un
fathomable to the Western
mind.
Even the severest critics of
socialist Ethiopia readily ac
knowledge that the govern
ment has made vast strides in
social reform, especially in
education, health and land dis
tribution, in one of the world's
poorest countries.

The literacy rate has gone
from 7 percent to more than 35
percent; about 50 percent of
children of primary-school age
are now in schools as opposed
to 18 percent in 1974; overall
school enrollment has in
creased by 250 percent to more
than 2.5 million.
In the health field, the per
centage of Ethiopians with ac
cess to health services has in
creased from 15 percent to 43
percent oftheestimated32mil
lion population, meaning that
an additional 10 million people
now have a chance to get med
ical care.
Land has been nationalized,
ending exorbitant rents for
peasants. In urban areas, access
to better housing has been en
hanced by provision of free

land and improved financing.
These radical changes have
also brought some problems,
however.
Standards of education have
dropped because of the vast in
flux of students. Some classes
have 80 to 90 students, and
many schools are on triple
shifts.
Medical shortcomings
Ethiopians have a life expec
tancy of 40 years, still the lowest
in the world, according to the
World Bank. Many Ethiopians
still live so far from health ser
vices that it takes two to three
days walking to get help.
Land reform in some cases
has led to a decrease in mar
keted per capita food produc
tion.
Ethiopian officials are willing
to admit these shortcomings.
During a tour of Asmara, of
ficials showed a wealthy dis
trict, which has a kindergarten
where children are issued free
uniforms and towels, a well
stocked shop and a community
center under construction.
Even though the tour was be
hind schedule, the officials
then insisted on showing an
other district, a slum within
sight of a magnificent Ethio
pian Orthodox church. The es
timated 3000 people in the area
live in hovels, the stench of
urine is everywhere, and
Mezgebe Desta, the district
leader, estimated that about 20
percent of the adults were fully
employed.
The display of poverty, ad
mittedly, is all blamed on the
evils of the deposed U.S.-sup
ported government.
"Under Haile Selassie, there
was an educational obelisk —
small at the bottom and small at
the top — as opposed to the
normal educational pyramid,"
said Geoffrey Last, an advisor
under both governments. "The
emperor wanted an educated
elite dependent on him for
running the country, but he
did not want to educate the
masses," Last said.
Discontent with educational
policy played a significant role
in the revolution.
Last gave examples of
schools being seized for offices

by rural governors and cited
one case where prisoners were
housed on the school com
pound. Wealthy landowners
opposed tax increases to ex
pand education.
Today, however, the drive
for education is manifest.
When the program started in
June 1979, six million people
enrolled. Only 1.3 million had
been expected.
Obviously, in such a situ
ation results were less than ide
al — only one quarter passed.
Since then, results have been
improved with the use of re
medial and follow-up courses.
Literacy classes are now
taught in 10 languages, with
plans to add five more this year.
There are about 100 languages
in Ethiopia, but most are not
written. In the past, classes
were only given in Amharic.
Gudeta Mamo, a senior of
ficial in the literacy campaign,
said more than four million
Ethiopians have become liter
ate as part of the campaign in
the last three years. In com
parison, only about 40,000 ob
tained literacy under a pro
gram the old government
started in 1968.
The government fudges
some in its statistics since it sets
the literacy level at the
equivalent of a second-grade
education.
At present, half the primary
school age children are not at
tending classes. If they did it
could cause an agricultural
crisis, since they provide the
bulk of the farm work in this la
bor-intensive society.
Yubnish, the reformed pros
titute seeking to be a secretary,
described the changes in her
life: "Before, people told me
things, but I could not re
member. Now, I hear things, I
write them down and I re
member."
