Lima, Peru (AP) â€” After 10 days without food, nine
U.S. citizens and nine other foreign inmates at a fed
eral prison say they will fast to the death if necessary to
dramatize their complaints against torture, inhuman
conditions and other human rights violations.
"We know what we're doing and we're serious.
We'll continue fasting until our demands are met or
we die," Kaydon Brandenburger, a 37-year-old pilot
from Wichita, Kan., told an Associated Press cor
respondent who visited the prison Sunday.
The Lurigancho federal prison is at the foot of the
Andes in the desert about six miles east of Lima.
Brandenburger is one of nine U.S. citizens partici
pating in the strike along with three Canadians, two
Frenchmen and inmates from Greece, Argentina,
Germany and Chile. They are demanding to be re

leased or transferred to jails in their own countries.
Thirty-seven inmates began the strike on Christmas
Day. Those remaining on strike said the others
dropped out for "health or personal reasons."
The strikers said they were taking vitamin pills and
drinking liquids such as coffee and tea, but were not
eating any food.
Two inmates were too ill to get out of bed, includ
ing Oscar Perez, 49, of Hialeah, Fla., who said he had
high blood pressure and a bad pancreas, and Francois
Antoine Arrighi, 36, of Corsica, France, who said he
suffered a heart attack a week after he began a hunger
strike on Dec. 4.
"There are many reasons for this strike, but the bot
tom line is the violation of our human rights," Richard
Mayer Stein, 36, of San Francisco said.

Stein said violations included the use of torture to
obtain forced confessions, being held upon arrest for
days or weeks without access to legal counsel, the fail
ure of the judicial system to review cases, to provide
trials or to pass sentences within legal time limits.
The inmates also complained of inhuman living
conditions in the jail, built to house 2500 inmates but
with a current population of more than 6000 men.
"There's a hole in each cellblock which serves as
the toilet for everyone," Stein said. "We have running
water for only 15 minutes in the morning and must
buy all of our food, drinking water and bedding."
The inmates said all but one of them is accused of
narcotics violations. Louis Masso, 39, of New York
City, said he was accused of trying to sell stolen airline
tickets.
