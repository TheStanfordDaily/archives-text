# China shifts focus to economic realm
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
' Shanghai, China — Liu
Dezhen was hawking chil
dren's toys in People's
Square, where 15 years ago,
as a young Red Guard, he
took part in massive rallies
during the Cultural Revolu
tion.
"From Red Guard to
salesman — it is quite a
change," Liu said, stopping
for a minute to muse over
his transformation and
Shanghai's as well.
"We have given up the
'uninterrupted revolution'
to concentrate on econom
ic development," Liu went
on. "By itself, continuing
revolution was not doing
much for us. In fact, it was
destroying rather than

building."
Liu, now 34, conceded
that he used to be a "smash
and-grab rebel." If he has
matured, Shanghai has also
changed. As Ge Dashong, a
city planner, put it: "We
have finally gotten down to
earth, seen the enormous
ness of the problems we
face and begun to do some
thing about them, one by
one and step by step. We
have learned that revolu
tion is not a magic wand that
we can wave to make prob
lems disappear."
Shanghai does have prob
lems — unemployment,
crime, industrial pollution,
urban congestion, rising
prices, an acute housing
shortage, the other com
plaints heard in most big

cities around the world —
and these have become the
main political themes here,
replacing revolution and
Maoist radicalism.
"To those who were
caught up in it, the Cultural
Revolution may have
seemed liked a great
cause," a Shanghai journal
ist said, "but it built almost
no new housing here. It
created no new jobs and it
did nothing about factory
pollution or traffic jams."
He added, "This and worse
was the result of putting
'politics in command,' as
chairman Mao Tse-tung
liked to say."
All China, of course, suf
fered during the Cultural
Revolution, which was
launched by Mao in 1966.
But Shangahi, as the radi
cals' stronghold, was even
more affected.
"We forgot totally," the
journalist said, "that the
purpose of politics is to
mobilizethe peopletosolve
problems."
In the five years since the
radicals were ousted,
Shanghai has struggled to
make up for the lost time, al
locating hundreds of mil
lions of dollars to create
more than one million new
jobs, to house 40,000 more
families a year in new apart
ments, to reduce the in
dustrial pollution that gives
the city China's highest in
cidence of cancer.
Crime is slowly being
brought under control, ac
cording to Shanghai resi
dents, although it has taken
very tough policing, occa
sionally by soldiers. Demon
strations, mostly by out-of
work youths, continue in
termittently, but they no
longer paralyze the city as
they frequently did only two
or three years ago.

Communist Party officials
are slowly fashioning a new
political system that sepa
rates the municipal govern
ment from the party struc
ture, gives it real authority
to run the city and broadens
public participation in it.
Yu Baolin, a top official of
the Shanghai Municipal
People's Congress said,
"We call it a 'people's gov
ernment,' and we are trying
to make it just that. When
we say 'power to the peo
ple,' it is not an empty
slogan. We want a political
system that gives the people
real power — first, to solve
their problems and, second,
to ensure that there will
never be another Cultural
Revolution."
As impressive as the
changes are when the pres
ent situation is measured
against that of 1978 or early
1979, residents still com
plain that the city has a long
way to go.
In housing, it will take
perhaps four more years to
house the 110,000 families
waiting for apartments, and
by then there may be many
families returned from oth
er parts of the country and
newlyweds needing a place
to live.
"If we could do some
thing about the congestion,
then many problems could
be dealt with more easily,"
Ge Dazhong, the city plan
ner, said.
Other Shanghai officials
said the lack of a com
prehensive approach,
though not scientific, may
prove to be better because
it produces quicker results
and avoids the big, grandi
ose schemes typical of past
urban construction pro
grams when everything was
part of a political campaign.

In the five years since the
radicals were ousted,
Shanghai has struggled to
make up for the lost time, al
locating hundreds of mil
lions of dollars to create
more than one million new
jobs, to house 40,000 more
families a year in new apart
ments, to reduce the in
dustrial pollution that gives
the city China's highest in
cidence of cancer.
Crime is slowly being
brought under control, ac
cording to Shanghai resi
dents, although it has taken
very tough policing, occa
sionally by soldiers. Demon
strations, mostly by out-of
work youths, continue in
termittently, but they no
longer paralyze the city as
they frequently did only two
or three years ago.

Communist Party officials
are slowly fashioning a new
political system that sepa
rates the municipal govern
ment from the party struc
ture, gives it real authority
to run the city and broadens
public participation in it.
Yu Baolin, a top official of
the Shanghai Municipal
People's Congress said,
"We call it a 'people's gov
ernment,' and we are trying
to make it just that. When
we say 'power to the peo
ple,' it is not an empty
slogan. We want a political
system that gives the people
real power — first, to solve
their problems and, second,
to ensure that there will
never be another Cultural
Revolution."
As impressive as the
changes are when the pres
ent situation is measured
against that of 1978 or early
1979, residents still com
plain that the city has a long
way to go.
In housing, it will take
perhaps four more years to
house the 110,000 families
waiting for apartments, and
by then there may be many
families returned from oth
er parts of the country and
newlyweds needing a place
to live.
"If we could do some
thing about the congestion,
then many problems could
be dealt with more easily,"
Ge Dazhong, the city plan
ner, said.
Other Shanghai officials
said the lack of a com
prehensive approach,
though not scientific, may
prove to be better because
it produces quicker results
and avoids the big, grandi
ose schemes typical of past
urban construction pro
grams when everything was
part of a political campaign.

PARTY-LED CHANGES — Hu Yaobang, chairman of
the Chinese Communist Party, recently told party of
ficials, "Don't talk big, instead do concrete tnings for
the people."
' Shanghai, China — Liu
Dezhen was hawking chil
dren's toys in People's
Square, where 15 years ago,
as a young Red Guard, he
took part in massive rallies
during the Cultural Revolu
tion.
"From Red Guard to
salesman — it is quite a
change," Liu said, stopping
for a minute to muse over
his transformation and
Shanghai's as well.
"We have given up the
'uninterrupted revolution'
to concentrate on econom
ic development," Liu went
on. "By itself, continuing
revolution was not doing
much for us. In fact, it was
destroying rather than

building."
Liu, now 34, conceded
that he used to be a "smash
and-grab rebel." If he has
matured, Shanghai has also
changed. As Ge Dashong, a
city planner, put it: "We
have finally gotten down to
earth, seen the enormous
ness of the problems we
face and begun to do some
thing about them, one by
one and step by step. We
have learned that revolu
tion is not a magic wand that
we can wave to make prob
lems disappear."
Shanghai does have prob
lems — unemployment,
crime, industrial pollution,
urban congestion, rising
prices, an acute housing
shortage, the other com
plaints heard in most big

cities around the world —
and these have become the
main political themes here,
replacing revolution and
Maoist radicalism.
"To those who were
caught up in it, the Cultural
Revolution may have
seemed liked a great
cause," a Shanghai journal
ist said, "but it built almost
no new housing here. It
created no new jobs and it
did nothing about factory
pollution or traffic jams."
He added, "This and worse
was the result of putting
'politics in command,' as
chairman Mao Tse-tung
liked to say."
All China, of course, suf
fered during the Cultural
Revolution, which was
launched by Mao in 1966.
But Shangahi, as the radi
cals' stronghold, was even
more affected.
"We forgot totally," the
journalist said, "that the
purpose of politics is to
mobilizethe peopletosolve
problems."
