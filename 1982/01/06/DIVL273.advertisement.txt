EUROPE AND THE THIRD WORLD: THE COLONIAL LEGACY
STANFORD IN BRITAIN â€” SUMMER 1982
Stanford Overseas Studies is offering a summer focus program which will provide historical and
contemporary perspectives on relations between Western Europe and the countries of Latin
America, Africa, and Asia over which Europeans once established colonial rule. The courses in this
program will examine the major events and trends in the formation of European colonial empires in
the Third World; theories explaining European imperialism, the political, economic, social, cultural,
and psychological dimensions of colonialism; initiatives taken by Third World peoples to assert their
dignity and autonomy; the effects of European colonialism on the nature of post-colonial Third
World states and on the development of options available to them; and contemporary relations
between Europe and the Third World which may affect the political and economic prospects of both
sets of countries.
