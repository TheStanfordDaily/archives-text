# Tight times ahead for many scientists
## 
### 
from the Daily wires
President Ronald Reagan's
science and technology adviser
Sunday night forecast a period
of belt-tightening ahead for
the scientific community and
advised researchers to do their
own trouser hitching.
"To those who object to such
undertakings, and to all my sci
entific colleagues," said
George Keyworth, who directs
the President's Office of Sci
ence and Technology Policy, "I
must say that if we scientists do
not make such choices, others
will, but with less acuity." The
federal government finances
most basic research and a sub
stantial proportion of applied
research in the United States.
In a blunt keynote address at
the opening of the American
Association for the Advance
ment of Science's 148 th Ses
sion, Keyworth advised scien
tists "who may still hope for
constantly growing budgets
across the board .. . that time
has passed." Science and tech
nology policy made without
considering the nation's eco
nomic policy "is no longer re
levant."
A former research scientist at
Los Alamos National Labora
tory, Keyworth said the gov
ernment's role in science must
be different from what has pre
vailed since World War 11. "A
science policy for the 1980s
cannot be, and should not be,
one based simply on growth
for growth's sake. Even in a pe
riod of affluence and sustained
economic growth, throwing
money at problems has not
alone proven to be an effective
strategy."
The retrenchment policy,
Keyworth said, would not app
ly to research and develop
ment funds in the Defense De
partment — earmarked for a 21
percent increase this year. But
it would be relevant to re
search in universities, which,
Keyworth suggested, should
work out their own problems.
For example, one issue that has
plagued many universities is
their difficulty responding to
student demand for courses in
computer science and engi
neering. Keyworth suggested

these schools raise engineering
faculty salaries — possibly at
the expense of top-paid law
and medical professors — to at
tract and retain more engineer
ing professors.
Some institutions may find
that the tenure system and a
low faculty turnover, commits
them to a large senior faculty
unsuited to today's needs, Key
worth said. "We may see some
attempts to modify the tenure
system to restore some flex
ibility to schools."
Where the government is
likely to look for budget cuts is
within its own federal labora
tory system. The system in
cludes Brookhaven National
Laboratory on Long Island,
N.Y., known especially for its
nuclear research. But Key
worth said the laboratories are
now more than 30 years old
and their original missions are
frequently forgotten. "A large
amount of federal research and
development funds goes to
these labs. Can we honestly say
that all of it is well spent? ... I
intend to concentrate on this
issue during the coming year."
Nevertheless, Keyworth did
not necessarily see dark days
ahead for science. "My own
experience leads me to believe
that the best overall quality of
research may not occur in
times of accelerating support,
but in times of moderate re
straint that forces qualitative
decisions."
Keyworth advised scientists
to begin making hard choices
in the work they support. "By
this I mean the application of
specific criteria to discriminate
between scientific areas that
are most promising and those
that are less promising." The
first criterion should be ex
cellence, he said, "the ex
cellence of the investigator and
the excellence of the field." In
applied research, where scien
tists have a specific goal in
mind, the criteria should be
pertinence. Finally, Keyworth
said, scientists should keep re
sults in mind. "What gives us
the most return for the dollars
spent?... We are interested in
results, past, present, and
future."

from the Daily wires
President Ronald Reagan's
science and technology adviser
Sunday night forecast a period
of belt-tightening ahead for
the scientific community and
advised researchers to do their
own trouser hitching.
"To those who object to such
undertakings, and to all my sci
entific colleagues," said
George Keyworth, who directs
the President's Office of Sci
ence and Technology Policy, "I
must say that if we scientists do
not make such choices, others
will, but with less acuity." The
federal government finances
most basic research and a sub
stantial proportion of applied
research in the United States.
In a blunt keynote address at
the opening of the American
Association for the Advance
ment of Science's 148 th Ses
sion, Keyworth advised scien
tists "who may still hope for
constantly growing budgets
across the board .. . that time
has passed." Science and tech
nology policy made without
considering the nation's eco
nomic policy "is no longer re
levant."
A former research scientist at
Los Alamos National Labora
tory, Keyworth said the gov
ernment's role in science must
be different from what has pre
vailed since World War 11. "A
science policy for the 1980s
cannot be, and should not be,
one based simply on growth
for growth's sake. Even in a pe
riod of affluence and sustained
economic growth, throwing
money at problems has not
alone proven to be an effective
strategy."
The retrenchment policy,
Keyworth said, would not app
ly to research and develop
ment funds in the Defense De
partment — earmarked for a 21
percent increase this year. But
it would be relevant to re
search in universities, which,
Keyworth suggested, should
work out their own problems.
For example, one issue that has
plagued many universities is
their difficulty responding to
student demand for courses in
computer science and engi
neering. Keyworth suggested

these schools raise engineering
faculty salaries — possibly at
the expense of top-paid law
and medical professors — to at
tract and retain more engineer
ing professors.
Some institutions may find
that the tenure system and a
low faculty turnover, commits
them to a large senior faculty
unsuited to today's needs, Key
worth said. "We may see some
attempts to modify the tenure
system to restore some flex
ibility to schools."
Where the government is
likely to look for budget cuts is
within its own federal labora
tory system. The system in
cludes Brookhaven National
Laboratory on Long Island,
N.Y., known especially for its
nuclear research. But Key
worth said the laboratories are
now more than 30 years old
and their original missions are
frequently forgotten. "A large
amount of federal research and
development funds goes to
these labs. Can we honestly say
that all of it is well spent? ... I
intend to concentrate on this
issue during the coming year."
Nevertheless, Keyworth did
not necessarily see dark days
ahead for science. "My own
experience leads me to believe
that the best overall quality of
research may not occur in
times of accelerating support,
but in times of moderate re
straint that forces qualitative
decisions."
Keyworth advised scientists
to begin making hard choices
in the work they support. "By
this I mean the application of
specific criteria to discriminate
between scientific areas that
are most promising and those
that are less promising." The
first criterion should be ex
cellence, he said, "the ex
cellence of the investigator and
the excellence of the field." In
applied research, where scien
tists have a specific goal in
mind, the criteria should be
pertinence. Finally, Keyworth
said, scientists should keep re
sults in mind. "What gives us
the most return for the dollars
spent?... We are interested in
results, past, present, and
future."
