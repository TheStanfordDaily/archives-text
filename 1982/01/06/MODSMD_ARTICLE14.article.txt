## Viewpoint/Tom Pratt Nuclear arms morally wrong 
### 
We're drowning in a waterfall of
verbiage about nuclear annihilation.
For years we've been hearing the
grim statistics and scenarios, and as a
result all of us can recite an atomic
liturgy as long as your arm. Plumbers
know approximately how long it will
take for a person's flesh to burn off in
Hollywood if a nuclear weapon ex
plodes in downtown Los Angeles.
Businessmen and housewives can tell
you about fallout, and lawyers know
the symptoms of radiation sickness.
In fact none of us — save hermits —
can possibly claim ignorance of this
"pall of death hanging over the na
tions."
In spite of this detailed knowledge
of the destruction that awaits us,
there is little response among Ameri
cans, and particularly among youth
and educated Americans. This inac
tion is even more striking in light of
the movement against nuclear weap
ons in Europe. In a time when our
government spends almost un
imaginable sums on nuclear weap
ons while poor people are asked to
suffer, it is hard to imagine why so lit
tle protest has been heard. The em
peror has no clothes, but we are vir-

tually silent.
There are, no doubt, many reasons
for this silence, but I'd like to suggest
"demoralization" as the primary
cause. When I use this term I mean it
in its most literal sense; we have been
robbed of our moral senses. The in
formation bombardment has dulled
us; we are fatalistically content to
know the details of nuclear death,
but we have made no moral
judgement on it.
It is interesting that synonyms of
"demoralized" include "de
pressed," "unenthusiastic" and
"broken," all connoting the cessa
tion of striving for a goal. The con
notation is accurate; morality is the
great motivator of human action and
without it we are broken and cast
adrift, unable to take concerted ac
tion for the social good.
I think the tkne has come for us to
regain this ability. We can't afford to
allow our fears of nuclear weapons to
paralyze our moral condemnation of
them. We cannot claim that the
world nuclearsituation is too difficult
to change — this is the epitome of ir
responsibility. There is no moral justi
fication for nuclear weapons in any

world view or ethical system that puts
primary value on human life.
Even the most lenient "just war
rior" cannot seriously argue that the
loss of life and destruction inflicted
by nuclear weapons is an acceptable
way to achieve political goals. Even
the person who concedes that gov
ernments have a legitimate right to
militarily defend their people must
agree that in the long run the use of
nuclear weapons for defense is sui
cidal.
The construction and deployment
of nuclear weapons can be stopped.
Those who would fight their use have
morality and hard-headed common
sense on their side, both powerful
weapons in changing publicopinion.
Students must organize and urge our
government to pursue the eventual
dismantling of all nuclear weapons
around the world. It can be done.
The abolitionist and the civil rights
movements made great social gains
by morally condemning an evil and
then organizing to fight it.
It is time for us to do the same. Let's
take action.
