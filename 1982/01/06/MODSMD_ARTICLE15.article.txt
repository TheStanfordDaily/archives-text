## Pro-lifers should support rights of those definitely alive 
### 
The recent column by Ralph Walker, (Dai
ly, Dec. 9), epitomizes an attitude which,
alarmingly, seems to be on the rise. It is a
kind of facile decision-making by people
who have had no real experience with the
extraordinarily powerful situations they are
discussing. It emerged, somewhat laugh
able, among those who wanted to count rel
ish as a vegetable in government-supported
children's lunches. It is far more dangerous
with regard to abortion. It appears in people
like Walkerwhosay,"Ahal Lookeehere! We
have people who want to adopt children,
and we have women who are pregnant and
don't want childrenl We'll simply force the
pregnant women to carry the pregnancy to
term, then figure out some way of getting
them to turn their newborns over to waiting
adopters."
It is an attitude which discloses an utter
absence of understanding about the trauma
and psychological damage that forced preg
nancy means to the women involved. The
fact is that for some women the pregnancy
itself is unendurable. Surely Walker is aware
that before abortion was legalized

thousands of women died in desperate at
tempts to get an abortion illegally. (Between
1963 and 1973, 6 million abortions were per
formed in the United States.)
The fact is that many women (and men) do
not believe that a zygote, or an embryo, or a
fetus, is a human being. In certain situations
some of those women decide that stopping
the development of a potential human being
is necessary to the life and health (physical or
psychological) of those who are alive. These
same women, were they forced to carry a
pregnancy to term, would find it impossible
to give up what would then be a realized hu
man being. This is true despite the fact that
keeping the child may mean misery for the
child, the parent(s) and other children in the
home.
I know no woman who has made the de
cision to have an abortion lightly. It is a de
cision formed by many emotions and con
siderations which finally bring the forceful
realization that the woman should not give
birth. Nor is it a decision which has been
made only by modern American women.
Throughout history, throughout the world,

women have confronted situations that
make them know that abortion is necessary.
In societies that vary tremendously, but are a
great deal less violent than our own, there is
far greater understanding and acceptance of
a woman's decision to terminate a pregnan
cy. Perhaps it is because people live more
closely and are dealing with the personal hu
man situation rather than abstract statistics.
Yes, there are those who believe the
zygote, is a human being. And there are
those who believe that contraception of any
kind (thereby preventing the conception of
children God wishes to be conceived) is akin
to murder. There are those who believe
masturbation to be equally morally wrong,
since it also involves the "killing" of what
could potentially form human beings. Does
Walker think that masturbation and con
traceptives should also be outlawed?
The Supreme Court's conclusion that
abortion must bethe decision of the individ
ual involved was made for the very good rea
son that these are issues we do not and can
not know about, and the differences of be
lief are tremendous. All life should be pre

cious to us. Yet, when we must choose be
tween a fish and a human being, we im
mediately choose the latter. When I must
choose between tremendous psychological
and/or physical damage to one I know to be
human, and the ending of what I can not
know to be life, I must choose the person.
Walker clouds the issue by attempting to
draw an analogy between abortion and our
nation's history of inhuman conduct toward
blacks and women. However, we know
these are human beings by every measure of
humanity. And we certainly have plenty to
do before we have made this world, or even
our own society, a decent place for all whom
we know to be human beings. Perhaps if we
achieved that decency, many women who
now feel they must choose abortion would
not have to do so.
Walker suggests that legalization of abor
tion contributed to child abuse. Surely dur
ing his college career someone has pointed
out the faultiness of inferring casual links
from events which happen to coincide. In
fact, incidence of reported child abuse was
rising before 1973. More importantly, there
are many alternative explanations forthe rise

in reported child abuse since 1973. They re
late to increased public awareness, govern
ment programs to encourage reporting of
child abuse, hot-lines for child abuse re
ports, etc. It is also clear that behavior which
was once tolerated is no longer considered
acceptable (there was a time, remember,
when father even had the right of life and
death over their children and, under certain
circumstances, coqld kill a child without
being charged for murder).
Perhaps the rise in reported child abuse
also relates to the general rise in violence in
this nation. I believe that this violence stems
in part from precisely the kind of attitude
Walker's article evinces, an insensitivity and
unconcern for the suffering of very real peo
ple, be it justified by what is essentially a the
ory (that a zygote is a human) or the greed
for an extra tax dollar.
I would at least be able to take Walker's
espoused concern for life more seriously if
he were first committed to creating a society
which made bringinga child into the world a
positive alternative for all women.

ports, etc. It is also clear that behavior which
was once tolerated is no longer considered
acceptable (there was a time, remember,
when father even had the right of life and
death over their children and, under certain
circumstances, coqld kill a child without
being charged for murder).
Perhaps the rise in reported child abuse
also relates to the general rise in violence in
this nation. I believe that this violence stems
in part from precisely the kind of attitude
Walker's article evinces, an insensitivity and
unconcern for the suffering of very real peo
ple, be it justified by what is essentially a the
ory (that a zygote is a human) or the greed
for an extra tax dollar.
I would at least be able to take Walker's
espoused concern for life more seriously if
he were first committed to creating a society
which made bringinga child into the world a
positive alternative for all women.
(Janice Brodman is a Ph.D. candidate in polit
ical science at Harvard University.)
The recent column by Ralph Walker, (Dai
ly, Dec. 9), epitomizes an attitude which,
alarmingly, seems to be on the rise. It is a
kind of facile decision-making by people
who have had no real experience with the
extraordinarily powerful situations they are
discussing. It emerged, somewhat laugh
able, among those who wanted to count rel
ish as a vegetable in government-supported
children's lunches. It is far more dangerous
with regard to abortion. It appears in people
like Walkerwhosay,"Ahal Lookeehere! We
have people who want to adopt children,
and we have women who are pregnant and
don't want childrenl We'll simply force the
pregnant women to carry the pregnancy to
term, then figure out some way of getting
them to turn their newborns over to waiting
adopters."
It is an attitude which discloses an utter
absence of understanding about the trauma
and psychological damage that forced preg
nancy means to the women involved. The
fact is that for some women the pregnancy
itself is unendurable. Surely Walker is aware
that before abortion was legalized

thousands of women died in desperate at
tempts to get an abortion illegally. (Between
1963 and 1973, 6 million abortions were per
formed in the United States.)
The fact is that many women (and men) do
not believe that a zygote, or an embryo, or a
fetus, is a human being. In certain situations
some of those women decide that stopping
the development of a potential human being
is necessary to the life and health (physical or
psychological) of those who are alive. These
same women, were they forced to carry a
pregnancy to term, would find it impossible
to give up what would then be a realized hu
man being. This is true despite the fact that
keeping the child may mean misery for the
child, the parent(s) and other children in the
home.
I know no woman who has made the de
cision to have an abortion lightly. It is a de
cision formed by many emotions and con
siderations which finally bring the forceful
realization that the woman should not give
birth. Nor is it a decision which has been
made only by modern American women.
Throughout history, throughout the world,

women have confronted situations that
make them know that abortion is necessary.
In societies that vary tremendously, but are a
great deal less violent than our own, there is
far greater understanding and acceptance of
a woman's decision to terminate a pregnan
cy. Perhaps it is because people live more
closely and are dealing with the personal hu
man situation rather than abstract statistics.
Yes, there are those who believe the
zygote, is a human being. And there are
those who believe that contraception of any
kind (thereby preventing the conception of
children God wishes to be conceived) is akin
to murder. There are those who believe
masturbation to be equally morally wrong,
since it also involves the "killing" of what
could potentially form human beings. Does
Walker think that masturbation and con
traceptives should also be outlawed?
The Supreme Court's conclusion that
abortion must bethe decision of the individ
ual involved was made for the very good rea
son that these are issues we do not and can
not know about, and the differences of be
lief are tremendous. All life should be pre

cious to us. Yet, when we must choose be
tween a fish and a human being, we im
mediately choose the latter. When I must
choose between tremendous psychological
and/or physical damage to one I know to be
human, and the ending of what I can not
know to be life, I must choose the person.
Walker clouds the issue by attempting to
draw an analogy between abortion and our
nation's history of inhuman conduct toward
blacks and women. However, we know
these are human beings by every measure of
humanity. And we certainly have plenty to
do before we have made this world, or even
our own society, a decent place for all whom
we know to be human beings. Perhaps if we
achieved that decency, many women who
now feel they must choose abortion would
not have to do so.
Walker suggests that legalization of abor
tion contributed to child abuse. Surely dur
ing his college career someone has pointed
out the faultiness of inferring casual links
from events which happen to coincide. In
fact, incidence of reported child abuse was
rising before 1973. More importantly, there
are many alternative explanations forthe rise

in reported child abuse since 1973. They re
late to increased public awareness, govern
ment programs to encourage reporting of
child abuse, hot-lines for child abuse re
ports, etc. It is also clear that behavior which
was once tolerated is no longer considered
acceptable (there was a time, remember,
when father even had the right of life and
