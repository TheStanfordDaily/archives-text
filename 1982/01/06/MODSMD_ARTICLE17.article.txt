## Cowell contraceptive clinics helpful, effective 
### 
Recent comments on Cowell's diaphragm
clinics need much correction.
Diaphragm clinics exist to speed the process of
obtaining a prescription for a diaphragm.
Gynecological appointments often get
backlogged and must be made for three or four
weeks in the future. Diaphragm clinics provide the
most effective way to accomodate more women
sooner, by providing part of the information and
instruction normally given in a one hour appoint
ment with a doctor or nurse practitioner.
Thus, the clinics make the fitting appointment
more accessible and expedient.
Furthermore, in cases where a woman states her
extreme discomfort or desire to "protect her
privacy," when making her fitting appointment,
she has two alternatives. First, she can visit the Con
traceptive Counseling Center upstairs at Cowell,
between noon and 4 p.m., Monday through Fri
day, and a peer counselor will go through the

clinic with her on an individual basis. Second, she
can make a longer appointment with the clinician,
who will go over the facts and information covered
in a diaphragm clinic. In either case, the woman
must make the Cowell person aware of her need,
i.e., tell the counselor she wishes the session to
fulfill the purpose of the clinic, or tell the recep
tionist she desires a longer appointment instead of
a clinic.
The diaphragm clinics are taught by a nurse
practioner or contraceptive counselor, people
who have extensive training in use of this method.
Those who conduct clinics inform and instruct.
They do not ask that women discuss their personal
contraceptive choice, as was implied. In fact, a
woman need not talk at all, unless, of course, she
has a question. Clinics attract anywhere from zero
people (especially in rainy weather and during
midterm and finals weeks) to eight or 10. Often,
couples attend, and people generally ask ques

tions when necessary. One benefit of a group ses
sion is that other people's questions may clarify a
woman's confusion or answer some question she
felt uncomfortable asking. Those who choose sim
ply to come, listen and leave need not feel com
pelled to speak if they don't wish to.
While for a few, the clinics pose some inconve
nience or uneasiness, we do not get complaints or
objections from those who do come. It stands to
reason that for most people in college, the desire
to prevent pregnancy and its problematic ramifica
tions outweighs the temporary possible discom
fort or inconvenience of attending a 30 to 45-
minute clinic. And people who greatly desire an al
ternative to a group session can utilize one of two
other options, given that they voice their specific
need to Cowell personnel.
