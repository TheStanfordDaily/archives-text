## Don't force personal religious values on society 
### 
I feel compelled to write in objec
tion to the letter by George Bump
CDaily, Oct. 4). This letter expresses a
view which may be shared by some of
our society, but I certainly hope not
by many. It states, "America is a
Christian nation and people; and
when we cease to be Christian we
will cease to be a nation or a people."
This is not true. America is a nation of
many religions, and of many ideas. It
is partly this diversity which makes
our nation what it is today. It is cer
tainly not all the work of Christianity.
"Christianity is based on the Bible...
" Yes, indeed. America is based on
the United States Constitution.
"... Collectively mankind cannot
survive without religion." Why not?
What has religion got that is so essen
tial? Yes, there are many religions,
and they all offer something to their
followers, but I do not believe that
these are things without which we
cannot survive. After all, it is even ad
mitted in the letter that"... individ
uals may succeed in living virtuous
lives without being associated with
any institutionalized religion ... "
The socialist anti-religious so-called
nations are parasitic entities which
will perish when we stop giving them
aid and support." I missed something
here. When did we start giving the
Soviet Union aid and support? It is by
far the largest of these entities. And I

would think it safe to say that the So
viet Union doesn't seem to be in
much danger of perishing, unless in a
nuclear conflagration, which for all
his virtuousity, Bump will not survive
either.
"The founding grant by the Stan
fords specified that religion and mo
rality should be taught at Stanford;
but everything I know about Stan
ford indicates no effort whatsoever
to teach religion or morality but rath
er a bias against religion and morali
ty." Then what is the function of the
Religious Studies department? It cer
tainly seems to me that Stanford
makes an effort to teach religion;
there is an entire department de
voted to it. Getting off the subject of
religion, and on to social attitudes,
Bump says "Her condemnation of
'sexism' shows that she still does not
understand that men and women
have different functions in life." In
reproductive life only. And she cer
tainly found that outl In societal life
women function exactly as men.
They can do the same work as men,
learn the same things as men, and
have as great or as small ideas as men.
They can even be priests, just like
men. "... her condemnation of 'ra
cism' shows that she still does not re
alize that there are inherited dif
ferences in character even after her
sad experience though being in

volved with a man of defective char
acter." But what has this to do with
racism? Does she state anywhere in
her letter that the boy/man with
whom she was involved was of a dif
ferent race than herself? No. Then
how is a racist position to be sup
ported by this? As always, on very
shaky foundations.

In sum, I respect Bump's religious
beliefs, but not his apparent ex
tension of those beliefs onto societal
values, and I do not think that those
beliefs should be forced on society or
its members.
