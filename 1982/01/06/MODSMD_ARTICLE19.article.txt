# Blind artist creates sculptures to be felt

Don Charpiot painted the themes of
Negro spirituals until he could no long
er see. Then he became a sculptor.
"The hands support the eye,"
Charpiot says, working on the rough
alabaster form of his latest piece. "I try
to show how our hands can take over
for our eyes.
"If I can get an understanding, help
bridge the gap, between the blind
world and the sighted world . . . that's
it."
An alabaster figure sits inside the
front door of Charpiot's home, hands
wrapped around its head. The piece,
once displayed at the Kansas City Art In
stitute and the Carnegie Institute in Pit
tsburgh, is modeled after a friend who

tore at his sightless eyes in frustration.
Another piece, two hands wrapped
around an oval eyeball, has just re
turned from a national Year of the
Handicapped tour.
"Blind people can do so much if
they're just given the opportunity,"
Charpiot says.
Working as a drill-punch operator in
1940, Charpiot took up a brush in his
spare time at the urging of artsy friends
from Washington University.
"I also had a twin sister who died at
the age of 19," he says. "She had an
enlarged heart and couldn't play with
the other children. We were very close,
of course. She always wanted to be an
artist. So when she died, I decided todo

it for her."
For about a decade, Charpiot used
the themes of Negro spirituals for in
spiration. His favorite is "Swing Lo,
Sweet Chariot," a green-gold canvas of
black angels rising to heaven.
He took up sculpting in 1950 when a
wood chip spat out by a table saw took
his right eye and glaucoma robbed him
of sight in the left.
Nearly 70 now, Charpiot moves ef
fortlessly through his comfortable
south St. Louis home. His wife hauls out
an old scrapbook filled with 40 years of
announcements of his exhibitions.
Although he doesn't paint much any
more, Charpiot pulls out one painting,
an amalgam of hands, Braille and type
writer keyboards. "The tools of the

blind," he says.
Charpiot doesn't like modern
sculpture very much. "It's so visual, you
can't gei up and touch it,"he says."It
should be textural. I tell everybody who
displays my work to please let people
touch it.
"That's another sad thing," Charpiot
adds. "I go out to the art museum and
all I can touch is glass cases."
Charpiot works alongside Angela, his
12-year-old niece, at a small workbench
in the basement. The precocious
Angela, who painted "Lady Stepping on
a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich,"
chips away at a stone bunny as Charpiot
sculpts.
"I love the way she thinks," Charpiot
says.
