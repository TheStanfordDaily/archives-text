# Kennedy attacks research restraints
## 
### Brad Crystal 
University President Donald Ken
nedy, speaking last night on the PBS
television program "The MacNeil-
Lehrer Report," defended a letter he
sent to the U.S. Departments of State,
Defense and Commerce in which he
protested government attempts to
interfere in graduate research.
Calling such attempts a "stifling in
fluence" on research, Kennedy said
the letter — sent last February — was
written as a response to government
attempts to monitor the activities of
foreign graduate students conduct
ing research hereandatseveral other
national universities. The letter ex
pressed "grave concern" over the
application of Export Administration
Regulations and the International
Traffic and Arms Regulations to aca
demic institutions.
Last Kennedy told a national
audience that Stanford was con
cerned that in the application of reg
ulations to fundamental research, at
tempts to preserve U.S. technolog
ical leadership which in other ways
may be entirely legitimate, become,
in fact, a stifling influence on the
conduct of an entire scientific en
terprise, most of which is based in
universities.
When asked whether he thought it
appropriate for universities to take it
upon themselves to restrict foreign
students' access to certain courses or
professors, Kennedy reiterated his
view that impositions of that kind
would undercut basic research.

And, Kennedy indicated, safe
guards to prevent leakage of sensi
tive information to foreign govern
ments are adequate enough already.
"If the technology becomes so im
portant militarily that it needs restric
tion, then the government can classi
fy it,"he said, "and then universities
can decide whether they wish to do
it."
Assistant Secretary of Commerce
Lawrence Brady, also appearing on
the program, countered Kennedy's
assertions by claiming that the gov
ernment's concerns "are not without
very solid foundations." He said uni
versities are too lax in overseeing the
activities of foreign students who
may pass on sensitive information
learned here to their host govern
ments.
"We found out that a graduate stu
dent from one of the East European
countries was over here studying
fuel-to-air explosives under a pro
fessor who was under contract to the
Navy," according to Brady. "The stu
dent finished in the U.S. and went
back to his East European homeland
and began working in the precise
area in which we had taught him."
Asked whether he believed there
are some aspects of technology
which should be, and, in fact, can be
kept secret, Kennedy answered af
firmatively.
"I think those (sensitive areas of re
search) should meet the test of re
quiring national security classi
fication," Kennedy said.
