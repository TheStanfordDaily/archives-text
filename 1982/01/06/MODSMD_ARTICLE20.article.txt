New York— A modest rise
in new construction spend
ing in November provided
another signal that the re
cession might be abating,
some economists said yes
terday, but a report of an in
crease in the nation's mon
ey supply raised fears that
interest rates will not soon
fall.
There was more bad news
from the auto industry,
which reported its 1981 pro
duction fell about 1.5 per
cent from a year earlier to
the lowest level in 20 years.
The major U.S. auto
makers, excluding Volks
wagen of America, said they
built 6.08 million cars in
1981. Even including VW's
figures, expected to be re
leased shortly, the final total
was expected to be the low
est since 1961, when 5.52
million cars were built.
The Commerce Depart
ment said spending for new
construction rose a scant 0.2
percent in November, after
falling 0.5 percent in Octo
ber and rising 0.5 percent in

September.
After adjustment for infla
tion, new construction
spending fell 0.1 percent in
November, the 10th con
secutive monthly decline,
the department said.
The value of construction
put in place through last
November was $217.5
billion, 3.3 percent above
the level for the same peri
od of 1980, it said.
The meager gain in non
inflation-adjusted new
spending followed a report
Thursday that factory orders
in November also rose 0.2
percent after a revised drop
of 5.6 percent in October
and a 1 percent decline in
September.
Both reports seemed to
indicate that the nation's
second recession in as many
years, while continuing,
may have passed its worst
point.
In December, the re
cession indeed worsened
and spread to more regions,
according to a monthly sur
vey of corporate purchasing

managers.
The recession has been
credited by many with forc
ing companies to pare oper
ations, thereby easing cor
porate loan demand and
taking some upward pres
sure off interest rates.
Rates dipped last fall, but
the decline stalled last
month amid forecasts of
record federal budget defi
cits and growth in the na
tion's money supply, which
the Federal Reserve Board is
trying to stem to fight infla
tion.
But the basic measure of
the money supply has re
sumed its growth, according
to the board. It said MIB, a
measure of funds readily
available for spending, rose
$1.4 billion in the week
ended Dec. 23 to a season
ally adjusted $442 billion.
For the latest four weeks,
MIB has grown at an 8.4
percent adjusted annual
rate, compared with the 7
percent rate for which the
Fed is aiming.
