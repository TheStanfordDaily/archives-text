## Three years after 'tractorcade' Farmers fight unchanging policy 
### Washington Post 
Copeland, Kansas â€” They
were mad as hell in 1979 mad
enough about U.S. farm policy
that they got on their big trac
tors and drove to Washington
to protest under the flag of
their newly formed American
Agriculture Movement.
That protest seems a world
and time ago, and the AAM
men are back on their farms
now, hunkering down for a
mean winter. They're alive and
well, and, without a doubt, still
mad as hell.
The tractorcade got them
some attention but it didn't
change things. Wheat, corn
and cattle prices are down. In
terest rates, fuel, fertilizer,
equipment and seed costs are
up. Government farm policy is
essentially the same.
It's a situation that drives
farmers to despair, although
many of them, despite their
talk of hard times and political
impotence, somehow find a
way to keep planting and har

vesting. And so it is with AAM
in Kansas.
Eight of the farmers who
took tractors to Washington
gathered with their wives re
cently at the home of Howard
Stude, who farms more than
2200 acres near here, to talk
about their lives since 1979.
Most of Stude's friends operate
big farms, which is the style out
here.
It was a good meeting, for
people seem to feel better
when they talk about their
problems and know they have
a willing listener. But it was not
an entirely happy meeting. For
a visitor from the city it was as
disconcerting as it was instruc
tive.
There was conflicting talk:
get government out of farming
but raise the price-support
loans for farm commodities;
shut down the Department of
Agriculture and fire the bu
reaucrats but continue some
protection for the farmers.
There also was dark talk of

conspiracy against the farmer
by land-hungry big business,
the Trilateral Commission and
the Council on Foreign Rela
tions. There was an urgency
about returning to the gold
standard. Parity-pricing was a
term that tumbled off every
tongue. That might have been
window dressing. What sur
faced with more urgency was a
pained sense of isolation that
comes from not being ap
preciated, particularly by city
folks and political leaders.
The towns in southwestern
Kansas are small and far apart,
huddled between fields that
stretch beyond the horizon.
Miles of irrigation pipe attest to
the region's aridity. Farm im
plement outlets outnumber
auto dealerships. The men,
needing an identity, dress like
ranch hands although they are
neither western nor cowboys.
The AAM took root in this
country and Howard Stude's
friends were part of it. Their

small-scale uprising in the West
and here in the Plains led to the
creation of AAM, which
pushes the idea that parity
pricing of farm goods would
solve all the country's ills.
AAM remains active in Kan
sas, and its members continue
to preach and proselytize with
passion for parity, even though
economists and politicians put
little stock in their ideas.
At its simplest, the theory
goes this way: If farmers were
paid a higher price for their
goods, more money would
circulate. Farmers then would
buy more, factories would
hum, workers would work, the
world would be rosy.
But farm policy, if anything,
is moving away from the parity
concept and the AAM farmers'
feeling of frustration grows.
Lurking behind that frustration
is the sense that people in the
cities simply don't understand
where their food comes from
or how it is grown and priced.
