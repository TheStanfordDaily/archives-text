## 49ers Walsh named year's best 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — One
year ago, San Francisco 49ers
and former Stanford Coach Bill
Walsh and his wife, Geri, took a
short vacation and he tried to
put the disappointments of a
6-10 National Football League
season behind.
Now, vacation plans are on
hold, the 49ers are one step
from the Super Bowl, and
Walsh is The Associated Press
Coach of the Year.

"There were times it looked
so different, especially the
middle of last year," Walsh said
yesterday after being declared
an overwhelming winner in the
annual AP Coach of the Year
poll of sports writers and
broadcasters.
"The first year it was so dif
ficult and I began to wonder
how long we could go on.
We've had many difficult mo
ments. The lowest point was af

ter we lost to Miami last year,"
he recalled. "It was our eighth
straight loss and the fourth by
less than a touchdown.
"That flight back from Miami
was a very tough one."
Walsh returned to the NFL,
where he had served 10 years as
an assistant coach, in 1979 to
become head coach and gen
eral manager of the 49ers. The
team had gone 2-14 the pre
vious season, and it went 2-14
again under Walsh.
A 3-0 start in 1980 was fol
lowed by the eight-game los
ing streak and the team had to
settle for modest success. The
breakthrough came this season
when the 49ers' 13-3 record
was best in the NFL.
Walsh was named Coach of
the Year two days after his team
beat the New York Giants 38-24
and advanced to the National
Conference title game, sched
uled Sunday against the Dallas
Cowboys at Candlestick Park.
In the poll, Walsh was named
on 61 of the 84 ballots cast.
Forrest Gregg of the Cincinnati
Bengals, another 6-10 team last
year, was second with 15 votes. *
"The award is probably the
most gratifying thing that's

happened in my career. We
deserve the award as a
coaching staff, as an organiza
tion," Walsh said.
The coach, 50, came to the
49ers from Stanford, where he
got a head coaching op
portunity in 1977 after being
passed over by several NFL
teams. His two Cardinal teams
were bowl game winners, and
he had two national passing
leaders in quarterbacks Guy
Benjamin, now a 49er, and
Steve Dils who plays for the
Minnesota Vikings.
joe Montana, who became
the 49ers' No. 1 quarterback
midway in the 1980 season, was
the top-ranked NFC passer this
year, enhancing Walsh's repu
tation as a master of the passing
game.
But defense was the major
reason for this season's success.
The 1981 draft brought in Ron
nie Lott, Eric Wright and
Carlton Williamson, defensive
backs who started as rookies
and played like old pros.
"We should be in the playoff
picture for at least the next few
years," said Walsh.
