Cowboys were named yester
day to The Associated Press All-
Pro team.
Joining Dorsett in The AP's
National Football League All-

George Rogers of the New Or
leans Saints, who edged out
Dorsett on the final weekend
for the NFL rushing title, and
quarterback Ken Anderson of
the Cincinnati Bengals.
The first-team pass-catchers
are tight end Kellen Winslowof
the San Diego Chargers, wide
receiver James Lofton of the
Green Bay Packers and Alfred

Two other Dallas players, of
fensive tackle Pat Donovan and

of sports writers and broad
casters amounted to the largest
representation by any one NFL
club on The All-Pro team.

year, in order to recognize the
increased popularity of the 3-4
defense along with the more
traditional 4-3 alignment, The
AP selected 12 players to its All-
Pro defensive unit, adding a
nose tackle (some teams refer
to the position as middle
guard) to the usual four
linemen and three linebackers.
The San Francisco 49ers,
whose 13-3 record in 1981 was
the best in the league, followed
the Cowboys with five All-Pro
players — rookie cornerback
Ronnie Lott and veteran de
fensive end Fred Dean on the
first team (even though Dean
was a pass-rushing specialist
and not a starter for the 49ers)
and quarterback Joe Montana,
and strong safety Donnie Shell
on the second team. The Jets
are offensive tackle Marvin
Powell and defensive end Joe
Klecko on the first team and
center Joe Fields and defensive
end Mark Gastineau on the
second team.
The remaining first-team of
fensive lineman is guard John
Hannah of the New England
Patriots.
The rest of the defensive
stars are defensive tackle Gary
"Big Hands" Johnson of the
San Diego Chargers, nose
tackle Charlie Johnson of the
Philadelphia Eagles, outside
linebackers Lawrence Taylor of
the New York Giants and Bob
Swenson of the Denver Bron
cos, strong safety Gary Fencik
of the Chicago Bears and free
safety Nolan Cromwell of the
Los Angeles Rams.
