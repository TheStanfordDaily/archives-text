# Spikers fall in S.E. Regional
## 
### Lisa Stern 
"Nine teams in the nation could have won
the national championship, but we should
have been one of the final four," Stanford's
dejected head coach Fred Sturm said.
Such heroics were not to be had by the
Cardinal spikers this season, however, as the
UCLA Bruins eliminated Stanford from the
national tournament in the finals of the
Southeast regional held Dec. 12 at the Uni
versity of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
The Bruins overpowered the Cardinal 4-15,
15-10,15-10,10-15 and 15-3 in the best-of-five
two hour match.
The loss came on the heels of a Stanford
win the previous night over Arizona State
University. The Cardinal trounced the Sun
Devils in three games 15-0,15-10,15-6.
Despite the team's tournament per
formance, Stanford managed to finish with an
impressive 32-14 record for the season, the
most successful mark ever recorded under
Sturm's tutelage.
The UCLA victory advanced head coach
Andy Banachowski's Bruins to the national
championships in Los Angeles at their own
Pauley Pavilion. They were joined by USC,
San Diego State University and the University
of the Pacific, the 1981 NorCal Conference
champion.
USC proved to be the tournament's Cin
derella story. After upsetting No.l ranked Ha
waii in the Western Regional to advance to
the nationals, the Trojans toppled the next fa

vorite, UCLA, in a five game final to capture
the championship. Following UCLA in sec
ond was San Diego State in third and UOP in
fourth.
Stanford senior Chris Anderson and junior
Deanna Boyette were awarded berths on the
S.E. Regional All-Tournament team for their
stellar play from the outside hitter positions.
Patty Orozco and Jeanne Beauprety from the
UCLA squad also received All-Tournament
honors.
Coaches Sturm and Shaw, while disap
pointed with the team's performance in the
UCLA match, maintained that they were
pleased with Stanford's overall effort this sea
son.
"Of course it's very hard for me personally
to not be disappointed," remarked Sturm,
"because we had beaten UCLA earlier in the
season. I find it difficult to gain a real unemo
tional perspective on the match."
"Yet," interjected Shaw, "two coaches
couldn't be happier with a squad of players.
They devoted a great deal of time and energy
this year, and we still believe that such an ov
erall dedicated attitude makes our job so
much more rewarding."
Both men are similiarly enthusiastic about
the future of the volleyball program. The
team will lose the All-NorCal-Conference tal
ents of Jan Linden and Chris Anderson to
graduation in June, but Sturm hopes that a
successful recruiting season will help mend
the loss.
