Schmidt still opposes sanctions
Washington — President Ronald Reagan told a
seemingly unconvinced West German Chancellor
Helmut Schmidt yesterday that the West must uni
formly and forcefully "insist that the Soviet Union
stop pressuring Poland" or face a grave disruption of
its alliance.
Schmidt, who earlier rebuked the president by
complaining to a Senate group that the United States
had failed to consult its allies before imposing trade
sanctions against the Soviets, made no direct public
response.
Instead, at Reagan's side, the West German leader
emphasized his concern over the world economy and
said joint efforts are needed to end the current global
recession, and reverse high interest rates "in order
not to plunge into a worldwide depression."
The two leaders thrashed out their differences over
how to handle Moscow and the military crackdown in
Poland for more than two hours. In public, Schmidt
did not budge from his opposition to the limited U.S.
sanctions Reagan imposed last week against the Sovi
et Union.
However, a U.S. official stressed the similarities be
tween the positions of the two leaders rather than
their differences.
Schmidt was described by senators as advocating a
"carrot and stick" approach by the West to help steer
the course in Poland toward moderation, perhaps by
offering cash to help Poland out of its present finan
cial shambles.
Storm leaves at least 13 dead
Northern California's devastating winter storm, de
scribed as the worst in decades, began abating yester
day after killing at least 13 people, displacing
thousands of others and causing millions of dollars in
damage. Eleven people were still missing.
In Pacifica, a seaside community south of San Fran
cisco, rescue workers tried yesterday to dig out three
children buried in a mud slide that struck their home
Monday night, but the effort appeared to be doomed
to failure.
Pacifica Deputy Fire Chief Gary Stofan said "a rush
of mud" hit the two-story house, trapping Billy Velez,
9, and his sisters, Michele, 14, and Melissa 4.
The mud slide sent one house crashing into another
on the coastal bluff.
Although Southern California was hit by substantial
rain, it was spared the predicted heavy drenching
when the storm veered from its previous south
easterly path and moved eastward.
Northern California property damage was greatest
in wealthy Marin County, where one official esti
mated losses in excess of $30 million, but the casual
ties were worst in Santa Cruz County.
A Santa Cruz County sheriff's spokesman said that
at least six people died Monday night, five by mud
slides that engulfed their homes and another when a
tree fell on a house.
Two others were missing and feared dead. One
person vanished after falling into the flood-swollen
Zayante River in the San Lorenzo Valley.
Judge revokes creationism statute
Little Rock, Ark. — A federal judge yesterday struck
down an Arkansas law requiring schools that teach
evolution to balance it with the theory of creationism.
The judge ruled the statute violated constitutional
guarantees of separation between church and state.
"It was simply and purely an effort to introduce the
biblical version of creation into the public school cur
ricula," U.S. District Judge William Overton said of
the law, which would have taken effect next fall.
The verdict, following a nine-day trial last month,
was a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union,
which said in a May 27 lawsuit that the law was too
vague, infringed on academic freedom and abridged

the First Amendment ban on laws that establish re
ligion. Overton invalidated the law on the religion is
sue only.
Evolutionists believe the Earth is billions of years old
and that life forms began developing gradually sever
al million years ago. Creationists generally hold that
the Earth and most life forms came into existence sud
denly about 6,000 years ago.
The statute said that schools teaching evolution
must give balanced treatment to creationism.
Reagan approves defense budget
Washington — Administration officials said yester
day that President Ronald Reagan has approved a
$245 billion defense budget for the coming fiscal year,
an increase of 15 percent over this year's level.
The $245 billion is in so-called obligational author
ity, the right to spend money in the future. This is the
best measure of the dimensions of the defense
budget. Actual Pentagon spending next fiscal year
would be $215 billion, up 18 percent from this year's
likely total.
The new figures remain subject to minor revision,
but they are a clear and forceful continuation of Rea
gan's policy of raising the defense budget while cut
ting back domestic programs.
The president's $245 billion request for defense for
fiscal 1983 is $32 billion above the fiscal 1982 obliga
tional authority of $213 billion.
Critics who have reviewed Reagan's new defense
budget said more programs have been started than
the services will be able to pay for in future years,
meaning further political struggles and possible can
cellations in the future.
Urban revitalization plan okayed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has ap~
proved in principle a plan to create up to 75 "en
terprise zones" in rundown urban areas, offering
companies special tax breaks to move in and create
new jobs.
Sources said the enterprise zones, one of the few
new domestic programs the president has embraced,
could be included in his state of the union and budget
messages this year.
In general, sources said, the plan envisions creation
of up to 25 zones a year for the next three years;
elimination of the capital gains tax on investments in
the zones; a tax credit of possibly $1,500 a year for
each low-income worker an employer hires for work
in the zone; a similar tax credit or deduction for the
employer on Social Security and other similar taxes
paid for each employee; a federal tax credit of per
haps $450 per worker in the zones, provided they
meet certain conditions, such as having previously
been on welfare or unemployed); and special invest
ment tax credits (possibly 10 percent on construction,
5 percent on machinery and 3 percent on light ma
chinery) for investments made in the zone.
Interest rates drop market again
New York — Renewed fears of higher interest rates
swept the stock market into a broad and steep decline
yesterday. Trading was active.
Industrial, electronic and financial stocks suffered
some of the worst setbacks, as did energy-related is
sues following reports of crude-oil price cuts by Mex
ico, Venezuela and Algeria.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged
17.22 points to 865.30, its lowest level since Nov. 23
when it closed at 851.79 and its worst one-day decline
since Sept. 3 when it also dropped 17.22.
Today's weather
