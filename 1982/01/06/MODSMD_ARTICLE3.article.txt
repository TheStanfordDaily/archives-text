Ralph Keller, director of the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center,
will become the School of Educa
tion's Asst. Dean for Alumni Rela
tions, retiring from the position at the
CPPC which he has held for 17 years.
Keller's retirement and subse
quent appointment to the School of
Educationwill go into effect July 1,
Myron Atkin, dean of the School of
Education, announced yesterday.
A search committee composed of
faculty and students is forming to so
licit applicants to fill Keller's position,
said search committee chairman
Carol Marchick, adding that the
search will likely be nationwide.
Keller, who received his M.A. and
Ph.d. in education here, has person
ally aided hundreds of Stanford stu

dents in finding job opportunities
and seemed the "natural choice" for
thealumni relations position,accord
ing to Atkin.
Keller, who has served as CPPC di
rector since 1965, said he sought
throughout his term in that office to
create programs that would expand
the job opportunities for seniors
graduating with liberal arts degrees.
"When I arrived, the CPPC was the
University Placement Center and it
was giving attention to those who
needed it least," Keller said. Whereas
four years ago a mere 12 companies
interviewed for liberal arts majors,
today 115 companies seek students
with such degrees, Keller said.
Keller said he noticed early on in
his work at the Placement Center,
that the economic times were chang
ing and liberal arts majors needed
the benefit of better and more abun
dant job opportunities if they were to
survive.
More women with liberal arts
degrees headed into the work force
while large numbers of students
opted for work rather than graduate
school. Inflation rose and people
began to hold more than one job,
further stiffening the competition for
jobs.
In 1971, the CPPC appointed its
first director of Liberal Arts Place
ment and the staff began searching
for companies which might have an
interest in liberal arts majors. Before
long, a greater awareness of the skills
of a a student in liberal arts began to
