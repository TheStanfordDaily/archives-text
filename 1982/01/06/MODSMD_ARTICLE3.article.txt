# Keller to leave CPPC for Education School
## 
### Todd Pickett 
Ralph Keller, director of the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center,
will become the School of Educa
tion's Asst. Dean for Alumni Rela
tions, retiring from the position at the
CPPC which he has held for 17 years.
Keller's retirement and subse
quent appointment to the School of
Educationwill go into effect July 1,
Myron Atkin, dean of the School of
Education, announced yesterday.
A search committee composed of
faculty and students is forming to so
licit applicants to fill Keller's position,
said search committee chairman
Carol Marchick, adding that the
search will likely be nationwide.
Keller, who received his M.A. and
Ph.d. in education here, has person
ally aided hundreds of Stanford stu

dents in finding job opportunities
and seemed the "natural choice" for
thealumni relations position,accord
ing to Atkin.
Keller, who has served as CPPC di
rector since 1965, said he sought
throughout his term in that office to
create programs that would expand
the job opportunities for seniors
graduating with liberal arts degrees.
"When I arrived, the CPPC was the
University Placement Center and it
was giving attention to those who
needed it least," Keller said. Whereas
four years ago a mere 12 companies
interviewed for liberal arts majors,
today 115 companies seek students
with such degrees, Keller said.
Keller said he noticed early on in
his work at the Placement Center,
that the economic times were chang
ing and liberal arts majors needed
the benefit of better and more abun
dant job opportunities if they were to
survive.
More women with liberal arts
degrees headed into the work force
while large numbers of students
opted for work rather than graduate
school. Inflation rose and people
began to hold more than one job,
further stiffening the competition for
jobs.
In 1971, the CPPC appointed its
first director of Liberal Arts Place
ment and the staff began searching
for companies which might have an
interest in liberal arts majors. Before
long, a greater awareness of the skills
of a a student in liberal arts began to


Ralph Keller
grow to the point where companies
such as IBM now solicit such students
that they refused years ago, said
Keller. In addition, the starting salary
of a student with a liberal arts degree
is lower and more appealing to many
companies who cannot afford to hire
a student with an Kelier said.
These efforts by Keller and others
seem to be bearing fruit for the liber
al arts majors registered with the
CPPC. While nationwide only two
percent of the jobs go to graduates
with liberal arts degrees, at Stanford
18 percent of the jobs fall to liberal
arts students. For Stanford students in

the liberal arts, the odds for work
placement after graduation are in
creasing. In 1979-80, 62 percent of
those liberal arts majors seeking em
ployment found positions; in
1980-81, that figure rose to 71 per
cent, according to Keller.
"We must try and satisfy the needs
that Stanford students feel, not as we
think them to be, but as they are ex
pressed to us by the students," Keller
said.

Between receiving his under
graduate degree from Maryland and
attending graduate school at Stan
ford, Keller served in World War II as
an educational advisor. After receiv

ing his M.A., he worked as director of
curriculum for the Air Force
Academy. He continued working for
the Air Force Academy in Washing
ton D.C., after he returned to Stan
ford for his doctorate. In 1952, Keller
came back to Stanford for four years
as a professor in air science.
In 1958, Keller became the U.S. at
tache to Israel and stayed there to be
come the superintendent of the
American International Schools.
Keller shunned government job of
fers in Vietnam and the Pentagon in
1965, when he accepted the job as di

Ralph Keller, director of the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center,
will become the School of Educa
tion's Asst. Dean for Alumni Rela
tions, retiring from the position at the
CPPC which he has held for 17 years.
Keller's retirement and subse
quent appointment to the School of
Educationwill go into effect July 1,
Myron Atkin, dean of the School of
Education, announced yesterday.
A search committee composed of
faculty and students is forming to so
licit applicants to fill Keller's position,
said search committee chairman
Carol Marchick, adding that the
search will likely be nationwide.
Keller, who received his M.A. and
Ph.d. in education here, has person
ally aided hundreds of Stanford stu

dents in finding job opportunities
and seemed the "natural choice" for
thealumni relations position,accord
ing to Atkin.
Keller, who has served as CPPC di
rector since 1965, said he sought
throughout his term in that office to
create programs that would expand
the job opportunities for seniors
graduating with liberal arts degrees.
"When I arrived, the CPPC was the
University Placement Center and it
was giving attention to those who
needed it least," Keller said. Whereas
four years ago a mere 12 companies
interviewed for liberal arts majors,
today 115 companies seek students
with such degrees, Keller said.
Keller said he noticed early on in
his work at the Placement Center,
that the economic times were chang
ing and liberal arts majors needed
the benefit of better and more abun
dant job opportunities if they were to
survive.
More women with liberal arts
degrees headed into the work force
while large numbers of students
opted for work rather than graduate
school. Inflation rose and people
began to hold more than one job,
further stiffening the competition for
jobs.
In 1971, the CPPC appointed its
first director of Liberal Arts Place
ment and the staff began searching
for companies which might have an
interest in liberal arts majors. Before
long, a greater awareness of the skills
of a a student in liberal arts began to

grow to the point where companies
such as IBM now solicit such students
that they refused years ago, said
Keller. In addition, the starting salary
of a student with a liberal arts degree
is lower and more appealing to many
companies who cannot afford to hire
a student with an Kelier said.
These efforts by Keller and others
seem to be bearing fruit for the liber
al arts majors registered with the
CPPC. While nationwide only two
percent of the jobs go to graduates
with liberal arts degrees, at Stanford
18 percent of the jobs fall to liberal
arts students. For Stanford students in

the liberal arts, the odds for work
placement after graduation are in
creasing. In 1979-80, 62 percent of
those liberal arts majors seeking em
ployment found positions; in
1980-81, that figure rose to 71 per
cent, according to Keller.
"We must try and satisfy the needs
that Stanford students feel, not as we
think them to be, but as they are ex
pressed to us by the students," Keller
said.

Between receiving his under
graduate degree from Maryland and
attending graduate school at Stan
ford, Keller served in World War II as
an educational advisor. After receiv

ing his M.A., he worked as director of
curriculum for the Air Force
Academy. He continued working for
the Air Force Academy in Washing
ton D.C., after he returned to Stan
ford for his doctorate. In 1952, Keller
came back to Stanford for four years
as a professor in air science.
In 1958, Keller became the U.S. at
tache to Israel and stayed there to be
come the superintendent of the
American International Schools.
Keller shunned government job of
fers in Vietnam and the Pentagon in
1965, when he accepted the job as di
rector of student work placement
here.
