# Campus fares well in storm

### Jeff Sims 
Although the recent storm
brought flooding, power knockouts
and other damage to the Bay Area,
the campus did "surprisingly well,"
according to Jerry Osterander, direc
tor of Utilities Systems here.
In addition, neither the police nor
fire departments reported any in
juries or accidents as a result of the
storm.
Osterander called the lack of prob
lems "unusual." However, he said,
"it took a lot of people working many
hours to mimimize the damage."
The overflow of Searsville Lake was
one of the bigger problems faced by
officials. He explained that the water
coming over the dam must be regu
lated to match the water from the
"feeder streams."
"We had to let water out of
Searsville or risk flooding people at
the other end of the dam," said Os
terander.
Flumes used to divert water had
becomed "clogged with debris and
silt," said Osterander. On campus,
utilities personnel had to pump wa
ter out of flooded manholes.
"There may be a problem on the
golf course, where a hill may be slid
ing,"said Osterander. However, he
said the area "is still too wet to assess"
what, if anything, will be done.
Gerald Hummel of Building Main
tenance Operations said "things
were basically handled pretty well,
but we found a few leaks we didn't
know about before".
Meyer Library, because of its de
sign, is especially prone to leaks, said
Hummel. "Meyer was originally sup
possed to have a fifth floor, and the
temporary roof put up instead of the
fifth floor doesn't hold up so well un
der a lot of water," he said.
All in all, no major problems de
veloped according to Hummel. "Last
year we found water running
through the walls in the law school,"
he said.
