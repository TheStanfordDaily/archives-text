# Woman forced off bike near mausoleum
## Another campus rape 
### 
A Palo Alto woman was forced from her bicycle and
raped shortly after 1 p.m. yesterday near the Stanford
family mausoleum, according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
The woman was riding along a bike path "in the fallen
angel area," said Herrington, when a man standingalong
the path forced her from her bike and dragged her into
nearby bushes where he raped her.
The assailant is described as a black male in his 20s,
about six feet tall, 180 pounds, with a thin mustache,
short hair and muscular build. He fled the scene of the
attack on foot when another bicyclist approached. He
was wearing a blue jacket, jeans, and tennis shoes. The
second bicylist, apparently unaware of what had hap
pened, did not stop.
Two persons eventually stopped to help the victim and
accompany her to the Stanford police station. She was
then taken to the Stanford hospital, Herrington said.
Yesterday Herrington issued an appeal to any persons
who were in the arboretum area between noon and 1:30
p.m. yesterday to contact his office.
The rape was the third on the Stanford campus since
October. The assailant in all three rapes fits a similar de
scription, but Herrington said he was unsure if it was the
same man.
"The description is somewhat different this time," said
Herrington."He's taller, for one. But the proportions, as
far as his build and his weight are about the same.

"The victim is pretty shook up," he continued, noting
that he hopes she will be able to provide the police with
more information when she calms down.
Herrington added that the victim was well and not in
jured, to his knowledge. "We always take the victims to
the hospital," he said.
According to Herrington, police have warned several
women seen alone near the arboretum in recent weeks.
"It's one of the lonelier kind of spots," he said. "It's
kind of a lunch area. People stop and read, but the
weather hasn't been that great recently. . .We arestill pa
trolling that area and others, mostly in the evenings.
We're doing everything we can in the daytime, but with
so many people out and about, it is very frustrating. It is
very difficult to try to cover such a big area.
"Right now we're just trying to figure out where this
guy's going to strike next," he said. "There's no given
area. That's what we're trying to impress on people — it
can happen anywhere."
Herrington said a composite drawing of the assailant
was not yet in the making. "Hopefully we'll get one," he
said. "That just depends on whether or not the victim is
able to do that."
To date, seven women have been attacked on campus
this fall, including the three successful rapes. Several
other women have been assaulted while riding bicycles,
although they managed to get away.
