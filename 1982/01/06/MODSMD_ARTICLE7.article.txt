# Expert says world environment dying
## 
### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
The current world society is unsus
tainable because of excessive soil
erosion, the deterioration of
biological systems and the rapid
depletion of world oil supplies, ac
cording to Lester Brown, president of
the Worldwatch Institute.
"We are engaging in a form of
biological deficit spending. We are
consuming environmental capital as
well as interest," Brown told a full
house at Dinkelspiel auditorium last
night, In a speech sponsored try Stan
ford for Environmental Education.
In order to understand our eco
nomic system, Brown said, one must
first understand the environmental
stucture that underpins the world
economy. The leading economic in
dicator should be the condition of
the environmental support system
and the failure of world leaders to
recognize this has created confusion,
he added.

"Supply side economics is mis
placed," Brown said."Producing
more will deplete the environment
even more."
Brown cited several examples of
the decreasing capacity of the en
vironment to meet the increasing de
mands made upon it by society.
Among these are the steady decrease
in the worldwide fish catch since 1970
and the decrease in the worldwide
production of lumber per capita that
has taken place since 1960.
Global food production has
doubled since I9SO, but according to
Brown fertilizer usage has increased
from 14 million tons in 1950 to more
than 100 million tons in 1980. Increas
ing food production by increasing
the usage of fertilizer in the future
will be difficult becausefertilizersare
made from oil which is itself becom
ing rapidly scarce, Brown observed.
The conversion of productive agri
cultural land to urban usage, along
with the large amounts of soil erosion
could create a major food shortage in
the coming decade, according to
Brown.
"The food problem could unfold
this decade as the oil problem un
folded in the 705," he said.
Food production per person has
declined 16 percent in Africa since
1970 and Brown predicted the prob
lem will get worse. "Africa is ex
periencing the fastest population
growth and the fastest decline in land
productivity by any continent in his
tory," he added.
In order to create a sustainable so
ciety, Brown said current values will
have to change. The values of throw
away goods and planned ob
solescence will have to be replaced
by values consistent with a sus
tainable society such as recycling, he
added.
"We need to think about system

atic recycling. Recyled metal could
be a primary source of metal in a
mature industrial society,"according
to Brown. Besides conserving metal,
Brown said, recycling saves large
amounts of energy. Citing recycled
aluminum as an example, he said that
metal uses 7 percent of the energy
used in the process of making new
aluminum.
Norway already uses more re
cycled metal than new metal, accord
ing to Brown, who added that in Nor
way a $100 deposit is required for the
metal on a new car.
Brown said that important strides
are being made in alternative energy
by various nations around the world
such as Brazil, which is using large
amounts of alcohol as fuel. Also, Chi
na has developed an extensive
hydroelectric power program.
"As we move toward renewable
resources we'll see a redistributon of

industry to places where renewable
resources are abundant," he said.
This is bringing us back to the situ
ation that existed when coal was the
major source of fuel and industry had
to be located near a major source of
coal, he said.
Financial incentives, the market
place and regulations are all vehicles
which need to be used to create a
sustainable society, said Brown.
Equity has to be a major concern
because of the limited worldwide ec
onomic growth, according to Brown.
"We have to think about the distribu
tion of wealth and resources not only
among nations but between gener
ations," he added.
"We have become so preoccupied
with our current economic situation
that we forget (he longterm. A re
newable society will endow our soci
ety with a permanence that societies
based on fossil fuels did not have,"
he said.
