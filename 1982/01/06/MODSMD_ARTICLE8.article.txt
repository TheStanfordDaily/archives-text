# Low grad turnout at ASSU Senate
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Even though most graduate
senators and alternates failed to
show up at last quarter's meetings,
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps
says that senate attendance "has
been the best in the history of the
senate."
Undergraduate attendance has
been "spectacular", Phelps said.
"We have more undergraduates
attending (senate meetings) this
year than both undergraduate
and graduate students together
last year."
The senate consists of 10 under
graduate senators and 10 graduate
senators as well as 10 under
graduate alternates and 10 gradu
ate alternates. Alternates are free
to participate in meetings but only
vote when needed to replace an
absent senator. According to
Phelps, when a regular senator
misses his third consecutive meet
ing he is moved to the bottom of
the alternate list and loses his vot
ing privilege.
"I prefer that (all senators and
alternates) did show up but guess
ing from past experience I did not
expect to have all 40 at the meet
ings," Phelps said.
"The graduate senate usually
has six graduate students (attend
meetings on the average). As
much as I would like to have all
graduate students attend that is all
I can expect since only 10 received
more than their own write-in
votes in (last spring's) election."
According to Phelps, the senate
does not have the power to re
move any of its members for lack
of attendance. "There is no mech
anism to replace them except for a
special election." In a special elec
tion students are able to recall
senators if they wish.
"It's not a functional problem
until no graduate senators show
up, however," Phelps said, refer
ring to the lack of a quorum which
would occur if fewerthan 11 sena-
