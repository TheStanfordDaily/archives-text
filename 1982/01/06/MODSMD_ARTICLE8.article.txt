# Low grad turnout at ASSU Senate
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Even though most graduate
senators and alternates failed to
show up at last quarter's meetings,
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps
says that senate attendance "has
been the best in the history of the
senate."
Undergraduate attendance has
been "spectacular", Phelps said.
"We have more undergraduates
attending (senate meetings) this
year than both undergraduate
and graduate students together
last year."
The senate consists of 10 under
graduate senators and 10 graduate
senators as well as 10 under
graduate alternates and 10 gradu
ate alternates. Alternates are free
to participate in meetings but only
vote when needed to replace an
absent senator. According to
Phelps, when a regular senator
misses his third consecutive meet
ing he is moved to the bottom of
the alternate list and loses his vot
ing privilege.
"I prefer that (all senators and
alternates) did show up but guess
ing from past experience I did not
expect to have all 40 at the meet
ings," Phelps said.
"The graduate senate usually
has six graduate students (attend
meetings on the average). As
much as I would like to have all
graduate students attend that is all
I can expect since only 10 received
more than their own write-in
votes in (last spring's) election."
According to Phelps, the senate
does not have the power to re
move any of its members for lack
of attendance. "There is no mech
anism to replace them except for a
special election." In a special elec
tion students are able to recall
senators if they wish.
"It's not a functional problem
until no graduate senators show
up, however," Phelps said, refer
ring to the lack of a quorum which
would occur if fewerthan 11 sena-

Though reaching a quorum has not
been a problem this year in the regu
lar senate meetings, it has created
troubles for committee meetings,
"where graduate students play an
important part," Phelps said. Since
the finance committee failed to
reach a quorum at meetings last
quarter, committee members pres
ent were only able to make informal
recommendations for senate ap
proval and were prevented from tak
ing any formal committee action.
One graduate senator who has
been active in the senate this year
and has a good attendance record is
Jim McGrath. McGrath, who heads
the rules committee, says that one
reason graduate senators are not as
active in the senate is that "ASSU
projects have had a bias toward un
dergraduates.
"To a certain extent graduate stu
dents are not as interested in the is
sues the senate deals with because
they are mostly undergraduate is
sues. Graduate students don't per
ceive the ASSU as something which

serves the graduate community.
"It's not that the senate usually
does things wrong from the graduate
student viewpoint, but the really se
vere problem is that issues which
graduate students are concerned
about are rarely brought up."
Both McGrath and Phelps termed
the graduate attendance problem "a
viscious circle," whereby without
graduate participation it is difficult
for the ASSU to serve graduate stu
dents.
At last night's senate meeting,
ASSU senators approved by-law
changes to provide for the set-up of
ASSU boards and bureaus. Affected
by the new by-laws are the Academic
Organizations Board, ASSU Course
Guide Policy Board, ASSU Legal
Counseling Office Policy Board,
ASSU Guest Professorship Bureau,
and ASSU Speaker's Bureau. The sen
ate did not discuss the by-law
changes for the Publications Board
which have been delayed in the rules
committee until Jan. 26.
The changes "should bring some
consistency to all by-laws," said Roc
Blumenthal, deputy senate chair.

ASSU Guest Professorship Bureau,
and ASSU Speaker's Bureau. The sen
ate did not discuss the by-law
changes for the Publications Board
which have been delayed in the rules
committee until Jan. 26.
The changes "should bring some
consistency to all by-laws," said Roc
Blumenthal, deputy senate chair.
Even though most graduate
senators and alternates failed to
show up at last quarter's meetings,
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps
says that senate attendance "has
been the best in the history of the
senate."
Undergraduate attendance has
been "spectacular", Phelps said.
"We have more undergraduates
attending (senate meetings) this
year than both undergraduate
and graduate students together
last year."
The senate consists of 10 under
graduate senators and 10 graduate
senators as well as 10 under
graduate alternates and 10 gradu
ate alternates. Alternates are free
to participate in meetings but only
vote when needed to replace an
absent senator. According to
Phelps, when a regular senator
misses his third consecutive meet
ing he is moved to the bottom of
the alternate list and loses his vot
ing privilege.
"I prefer that (all senators and
alternates) did show up but guess
ing from past experience I did not
expect to have all 40 at the meet
ings," Phelps said.
"The graduate senate usually
has six graduate students (attend
meetings on the average). As
much as I would like to have all
graduate students attend that is all
I can expect since only 10 received
more than their own write-in
votes in (last spring's) election."
According to Phelps, the senate
does not have the power to re
move any of its members for lack
of attendance. "There is no mech
anism to replace them except for a
special election." In a special elec
tion students are able to recall
senators if they wish.
"It's not a functional problem
until no graduate senators show
up, however," Phelps said, refer
ring to the lack of a quorum which
would occur if fewerthan 11 sena-

Though reaching a quorum has not
been a problem this year in the regu
lar senate meetings, it has created
troubles for committee meetings,
"where graduate students play an
important part," Phelps said. Since
the finance committee failed to
reach a quorum at meetings last
quarter, committee members pres
ent were only able to make informal
recommendations for senate ap
proval and were prevented from tak
ing any formal committee action.
One graduate senator who has
been active in the senate this year
and has a good attendance record is
Jim McGrath. McGrath, who heads
the rules committee, says that one
reason graduate senators are not as
active in the senate is that "ASSU
projects have had a bias toward un
dergraduates.
"To a certain extent graduate stu
dents are not as interested in the is
sues the senate deals with because
they are mostly undergraduate is
sues. Graduate students don't per
ceive the ASSU as something which

serves the graduate community.
"It's not that the senate usually
does things wrong from the graduate
student viewpoint, but the really se
vere problem is that issues which
graduate students are concerned
about are rarely brought up."
Both McGrath and Phelps termed
the graduate attendance problem "a
viscious circle," whereby without
graduate participation it is difficult
for the ASSU to serve graduate stu
dents.
At last night's senate meeting,
ASSU senators approved by-law
changes to provide for the set-up of
ASSU boards and bureaus. Affected
by the new by-laws are the Academic
Organizations Board, ASSU Course
Guide Policy Board, ASSU Legal
Counseling Office Policy Board,
ASSU Guest Professorship Bureau,
and ASSU Speaker's Bureau. The sen
