## Artificial Intelligence—Can machines think? 
### Richard Roth 
Some might think Artificial Intelligence is
something that enabled their roommate to
gain admission to Stanford, but it's actually
the hottest and potentially the most far
reaching topic in the field of computer sci
ence today.
The Heuristic Programming Project (HPP),
a group within the Stanford Computer Sci
ence Department, is devoted to the study of
Artificial Intelligence (Al). There are approx
imately 60 faculty, staff and graduate stu
dents who are working in this field at Stan
ford, which is considered by experts to be
one of the top three institutions in the coun
try, along with M.I.T. and Carnegie-Mellon,
for Al research. The HPP research receives
approximately $2 million a year from various
government agencies, such as the Depart
ment of Defense, National Science Founda
tion and National Institute of Health, as well
as private industry.
Early research in Artificial Intelligence
concentrated on the development of robots.
"If you wanted to build an intelligent system
what would you do?" said Asst. Prof, of Com
puter Science Mike Genesereth. "You'd try
to emulate the major intelligent system that
we know about, the human being. Much of
the early work was involved with trying to
build an automaton that could see and talk
and move things around. What was dis
covered was that in understanding natural
languages you need a tremendous amount
of higher intelligence capabilities in order to
figure out what a person is saying."
Computers needed to be able to perform
complex operations of logic, but computer
languages in use at the time had been de
signed to handle numerical computations
with speed and accuracy. In the 19505, com
puter languages were developed that
enabled the machine to manipulate sym
bols, first words and then entire sentences,
in such a way as to reach logical conclusions
from the information it was given. Effort was
then directed towards creating a general

problem solver, a very intelligent computer
program that could reason its way through a
large number of complex situations.
This initial approach was not successful
and prompted researchers in Al to ponder
the fundamental question of just what it is
that constitutes intelligence. They de
termined that purely logical reasoning was
not sufficient, in itself, to produce satisfac
tory conclusions from complex data. Where
as results could be obtained that were
logically reasonable, they were unaccep
table when considered in the context of
complex domains such as medicine or
chemistry. Intelligence, the researchers con
cluded, also derives from a vast store of
knowledge that is accumulated over many
years of education, training and experience,
coupled with an ability to use selected bits
and pieces of that knowledge to solve a par
ticular problem.
Efforts were then devoted to developing
computer programs, called "knowledge
based", that had large quantities of informa
tion built into them. "The way that human
beings manage to (make use of all that in
formation)," said Genesereth, "is that they
have some rules, some lore, some heuristics
as they're often called, that suggest which
are fruitful ways to (proceed) and which are
not. What we've developed is a way of cap
turing that lore, a language in which experts
(in a given field) can write down the rules of
reasoning than they have developed
through years of experience, rather than just
the facts. That's the important thing. That's
what we can do that people haven't thought
about doing in the past."
Al researchers at Stanford were able to de
velop high performance computer pro
grams, called "expert systems," by combin
ing the rules of logic with the more special
ized rules, or heuristics, obtained from many
years of experience in a certain field.
The programs not only provide con
clusions, but can also be requested to supply
an explanation as to the specific line of rea

soning that was used. Experts use this pro
cedure to scrutinize the performance of the
programs and determine if the rules are cor
rect. The programs are designed so that the
rules can be easily modified and new ones
added. After many repetitions of the eval
uation and modification procedure, the pro
grams begin to perform with a high level of
competence.

Several programs in different fields have
already been produced that incorporate
these design features. The MYCIN and DEN
DRAL programs were created with the help
of experts in the fields of medical diagnosis
and molecular structure analysis, respective
ly-
MYCIN is a computer program that can
evaluate the symptoms of a patient who is
suspected of having an infectious disease
and deliver a diagnosis. The use of such a
program in remote areas of the world could
provide expert medical advice where it
would otherwise be unavailable. The DEN
DRAL program was designed to determine
molecular structures from mass spec

trometer data.
Both programs have been subjected to in
tensive review by panels of experts and de
emed to perform at levels of competence
equal to that of the top people in the field.
Current research in the HPP at Stanford is
aimed at applying the same principles that
were used in the MYCIN and DENDRAL pro
grams to a broader range of problems. An in-

telligent computer program is being de
veloped for IBM that can diagnose the cause
of malfunctions in faulty computers. Anoth
er is being created to do the same for high
technology, military equipment. In both
cases, the programs will incorporate the in
sights and experience of experts at trouble
shooting, as well as detailed information
concerning the design of the equipment. A
third project involves the development of a
computer program that would automate the
interpretation of subsurface, geophysical
data to expedite the search for valuable
energy resources.
One topic that is the object of increasing
interest, is a development that will make the

computer programs more efficient at weav
ing their way through the complex maze of
problem solving.
"We'd like to give the program the ability
to reason about the problem of reasoning,"
Genesereth said ( "to let it introspect about
the problem of solving a problem and per
haps realize things like, 'Hey, this problem is
not solveable'."
This concept of giving the computer a
sense of itself and of what it is trying to ac
complish, is the underlying thread that con
nects the many, seemingly unrelated, topics
that are discussed in the best-selling book by
Douglas Hofstadter,Gode/, Escher, Bach.
(His father, Robert Hofstadter, is a Nobel
Laureate physics professor at Stanford). In
the book, he relates the concept of reason
ing about reasoning to the structure of
canons and fugues composed by Bach, the
paradoxical drawings of M.C. Escher and the
mathematical formulations of Kurt Godel.
The book has had a profound effect on the
field of Al research, as witnessed by several
recent technical papers that have discussed
it.
Another area of current research is the de
velopment of programs that can teach them
selves. Instead of constructing programs that
contain rules to interpret a body of data, the
programs are designed so that they can de
duce their own rules given a set of results
that have already been interpreted. The pro
grams might even be able to design experi
ments to test the rules in light of the data at
hand.
Genesereth offers an interesting analogy
with previously developed technologies that
are now fully integrated into our society. "I
think people feel possessive about in
telligence as being a unique human trait. We
accept machines that can make us travel
faster than we can run. We accept machines
that can make us see or hear better than we
could otherwise. I don't see why we
shouldn't accept machines that can help us
think better."
