# Marguerite bus routes reduced
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
The University has recently
adopted recommendations of the
Committee on Parking and Transpor
tation which call for a reduction in
Marguerite bus service and an in
creased emphasis on the problems
facing those who must drive to work
on campus.
While the cost of parking stickers
will remain the same next year, the
price of pay parking will rise from 50
cents to perhaps 75 cents or a dollar.
The Marguerite No. 1 line will have
its operating hours reduced by half
an hour in the morning and another
half hour at night. It will begin run
ning at 7:30 a.m. and run until 5:30
p.m. The cuts are being implemented
to reduce costs and because of low
ridership, the committee reported.
In addition, the number of vehicle
hours per day on the route will be cut
from 64 to 32 hours. This will require
a reduction in service and some
changes in the bus route.
The University is also moving to in
crease the number of parking spaces
in its existing pay parking lots. It is
studying the committee's recom

mendations on increasing the
number of parking lots, especially
where new buildings are con
structed.
The committee's report maintains
that it is not favoring the use of auto
mobiles over alternative methods of
transportation. It emphasized that
bus fares should not be adopted, for
instance. However, the committee
suggested that using money col
lected from parking fees to finance
the Marguerite would be an unfair
practice.
"Those who use Marguerite do not
pay for it, and vice versa," the report
said. "Furthermore, those who,
through no fault of their own, must
drive a car to work deeply resent hav
ing to subsidize a system they scarce
ly use." The committee recom
mended that the University find oth
er ways to finance the bus system.
The committee said parking on
campus was a serious problem. Not
only does searching for spaces waste
time and aggravate students and
staff/but parking in lots far from cam
pus represents a danger, especially to
women, during dark winter eve

nings.
Lack of on-campus parking spaces
reduces staff efficiency. Mildred
Aine, who works in the controller's
office in Encina Hall, said her work
requires interaction with other of
fices around campus. She said find
ing parking spaces was often time
consuming when running errands,
particularly when she must attend a
meeting lasting beyond the 40-
minute limit of spaces nearest some
buildings.
Betty Oswald, who works across
campus in the Jordan Quad, charac
terized the parking situation as
"tight. It's O.K. if you get there early
enough in the morning, but if you
have to leave and come back, you're
going to have to drive around look
ing for a place to park."
The staff at the Communication
Dept. uses a bicycle with a basket to
run errands on campus, Oswald said.
Ann Vollmer, who works in Encina
Hall, said that as a carpooler she had
little trouble finding parking spaces
near the Encina tennis courts. She
said parking spaces were "not too far
away" during the day. However, she

added that the lots were too remote
to be safe at night. "If for some rea
son I had to work late, I'd break the
rules and park closer. Any secretary
would."
Oswald said parking near the
Quad was a problem. She said she
often faced a 10-minute walk to her
office when she worked there several
years ago.
Reductions in Marguerite service
may result in a further reduction in
ridership. Both Oswald and Aine said
the bus was too slow to be used to
commute between offices. "It's so
slow it's useless," Aine said. "If I had
my way, I'd encourage it, not dis
courage it." She said previous cut
backs prevented her from going to
the Stanford Shopping Center during
lunch hour because the trip now
takes too long. Aine said that because
of cutbacks she uses the bus a lot less
frequently than she did last year.
Aine said cutting back the hours
the bus operated would affect staff
who get out of work latejnd need to
connect with another local bus artd
students in Escondido Village who
stay on campus during the evening.


A clear day to see the City by the Bay
The Pacific storm which ravaged the Bay Area early this week was not without some benefits. The waters
washed away dirty air, bringing the clear day and cloudless skies yesterday which made for near-perfect
viewing from Hoover Tower. Viewers atop the tower could see up and down both the Santa Cruz and East

Bay mountains, as well as all the way to San Francisco, making particularly appropriate the well-known
book title Stanford: From the Foothills to the Bay. More fair weather today could bring another great day
tor seeing the sights.
