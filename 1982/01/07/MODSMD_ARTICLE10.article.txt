## Grant to promote educational programs at Art Museum 
### Jeff Sims 
The University Art Museum has received a
$25,000 federal grant which will be used to
fund the Educational Services Program in the
museum, according to Joan Coppock, an ad
ministrative assistant in the Art Dept.
The Instituteof Museum Services, an inde
pendent agency of the Department of
Education, donated the grant to the
museum, which received a similar grant
from the same agency last year, said Carol
Osborne, assistant director of the musuem.
Coppock, who wrote the application for
the grant, defined the purpose of the pro
gram as an effort to "bring the art of the Stan
ford Museum into the surrounding com
munity and bring the surrounding com

munity to Stanford to see the art."
The Educational Services Program has
sponsored docent-led tours of the Art
Museum and Art Gallery, and programs with
local schools, community groups and busi
nesses, said Kate Kimelman, director of the
program.
Kimelman said the new money would be
used to expand special programs for the
physically impaired, help publicity and train
new docents. She said the museum has pro
grams for the sight-impaired and hearing
impaired, but needs to find ways of increas
ing the attendance of the physically handi
capped.
The museum currently has about 80 do
cents and will be training a new docent class
in the fall, she said. According to Kimelman,

the docents are volunteers from the com
munity who have an "extensive training
from the Art Department on campus."
The docents' training program lasts 9
months, in which they audit classes in art.
Docents are "urged to audit one or two
classes a quarter" after completing their
training, she said. As well as leading tours of
the museum and Art Gallery, docents guide
campus sculpture walks and tours of the
Hanna Honeycomb House designed by
Frank Lloyd Wright, said Kimelman.
Kimelman said the Educational Services
Program would continue to provide art lec
tures using slides and artifacts for educa
tional groups in the community. Osborne
said this program would help educate
"American students coming out of public

schools who know very little about the visual
arts."
Last year's award of $35,000 was used for
the care and restoration of the collection, es
pecially the American and European paint
ings, and the Native American and African
art exhibits, she said."We also set up a simple
lab so some problems could be solved on the
premises. It was an extremely useful
grant,"concluded Osborne.
The Art Museum was one of 573 applicants
that received aid out of the 1311 museums
that applied, said Kimelman. Coppock stated
that she did not know what criteria were
used to select the recipients of the grants,
but Kimelman felt that background and
strengths of the programs were probably the

deciding factors. "This is the 12th year of the
docent program, and they realized the
number of people who are brought to the
museum," she said.
The museum is usually funded by the Uni
versity and from private sources, said Cop
pock. "The University provides the basic op
erating budgets â€” salaries and expenditures
for maintaining the museum," she said.
However, it "provides no money for the ac
quisition of new art or special exhibits, which
all comes from outside sources," she said.
Kimelman stated that the grant will help
make the musuem staff "open to tailoring
our ideas to people's needs. We are willing
to set up a special tour to tie in with what a
class is studying, or do anything to help the
students."
