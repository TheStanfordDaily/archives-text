## Viewpoint/Jerry Brodkey Take active role in education 
### 
During the Christmas vacation,
friends and relatives asked me how I
felt about my fall quarter at Stanford.
I found myself replying: "It was an
excellent quarter, but perhaps not as
excellent as it could conceivably
have been."
Hearing myself say this bothered
me, and I wanted to more thoroughly
clarify the quality of excellence I was
seeking. The comments that follow
are general in nature and not
directed at any specific individuals or
courses. Rather, they are intended to
help clarify my expectations and per
haps stimulate discussion.
The half dozen courses which I
took or audited have much in com
mon. The professors were prepared,
articulate and stimulating. The mate
rial seemed interesting and worth
while. On three or four of the course
evaluations I gave the professors
nothing but the highest ratings. Still,
something was missing.
Friends and I had talked about this
missing quality throughout the quar
ter. It seemed to be the result of a
passivity about the students — myself
included — in many of the classes I
attended. I knew that I would often
shuffle into the back of a lecture,
spread out my backpack, pull out the
notebook, and begin to take notes
like a robot.
I would be comfortable in the
knowledge that I would not be called
upon tooffer my opinion norwould I
be forced to react to the professor's
statements. In almost all of my
classes, only a very small number of
students ever spoke or raised ques
tions. The vast majority would enter,
silently take notes and leave.
This passivity obviously is learned.
The same students who sit so quietly
in a class setting often explode with
ideas in the hallways, the dorms or lo
cal bars.
Why does this happen? In high
school and elsewhere, students learn
that the easiest path is one of silence.
It takes emotional and intellectual ef
fort to react to a classroom situation.
There is a perceived risk of being
judged harshly by one's instructors
and peers. It is easier to sit quietly
than to speak.
There is a pervasive and unspoken
belief that the responsibility for the
quality of a student's classroom ex
perience rests upon the professor.
The class is seldom seen as an interac
tive process dependent upon the ac
tions of both the students and the
professors. As students we still do not
take responsibility for our own learn
ing.
This does not mean that professors
should be absolved from their re
sponsibilities for a course. Instead,
the concept of responsibility should
be broadened to include students as

well.
Were the students in the class pre
pared? Did they help stimulate you to
explore the material? Were interest
ing and important questions raised?
Was the professor's point of view
challenged?
Many courses here seem product
oriented. The goal is to complete the
mid-terms, papers and final. In many
classes students need rarely come; or
if attendance is required, partici
pation seldom is. The day-to-day
learning process can easily be over
shadowed by the goal of getting
things done.
One man I taught with character
ized his students as either "sponges"
or "stones." The material he present
ed would simply flow by the "stones"
in his class. The "sponges," on the
other hand, would soak up the bits of
knowledge we teachers dispensed.
The problem with this dichotomy
is that in both cases the students are
passive learners. This educational
process is very different from one
which emphasizes a type of partner
ship of teacher-student exploration
and discovery.
I have heard people say that there
is no time for more discussion and in
teraction: the curriculum must be
covered. The acquisition of bits and
pieces of knowledge, however,
seems a secondary educational goal
at best.
If the sole goal of the lecture for
mat is to present information to a
massive audience, perhaps the live
lecture could be junked. Material
could even be transcribed and read
much more quickly than listened to.
If efficiency of transmission is the
goal, other methods can be utilized.
There are obviously other reasons
for having lectures. Being present at a
live event — whether a lecture or a
football game — has an emotional
component that cannot be matched
by television. Sometimes this "effec
tive" component of learning is as
crucial as the cognitive one. Last
quarter I audited a history class
where the professor was so articulate
and so stimulating that I would have
paid to see him speak on almost any
subject.
Emotionally as well as intellectual
ly, it was a pleasure to be in his
classroom. More importantly, most
professors who give lectures do pro
vide for some student interaction.
Questions may be raised, clari
fications given, and comments solic
ited. Often these unplanned and im
promptu moments are among the
most important of the course. When
students are passive, these moments
never occur.
Note-taking is part of the same pas
sive process. I know I can easily take
notes without thinking. When taking

notes, students look busy and in
volved. A student who sits in a class
and simply listens might be viewed as
being cocky, lazy or bored. For most
of us, note-taking is almost a condi
tioned response. The professor be
gins to speak, we begin to write. As
long as we are busy taking notes, no
one condemns us for failing to ques
tion or think critically.
It would be interesting to see what
would happen if a professor pro
hibited note-taking and the only op
tions available to students were to sit
and listen and think and react. It
would also be interesting to know
how the ASSU note service is being
used. Does it free students to con
centrate in class, or are the notes sim
ply a back-up procedure to insure
nothing slips by the note-taking net?
What can be done? First, atten
dance can be emphasized or even re
quired. Being in class and contribut
ing can be made explicit class goals.
When a student is absent, it can be
made known that he/she was genu
inely missed. Names can be learned
by both the professor and other stu
dents to facilitate discussion and ex
change of ideas.
Second, the lecture format can be
modified to provide even more time
for interaction and questions. At dif
ferent points in a lecture, a professor
might stop and call on students by
name for their reactions.
Third, the traditional blockbuster
paper-test assignment pattern might
be altered. Every week students
could be asked to write short reac
tion papers to that week's readings.
Students could be required to come
to weekly seminars and discussions
with a prepared series of questions
about lectures and readings. Day-to
day participation could be em
phasized to a much greater degree.
Finally, there can be an awakening
to new possibilities, a raising of the
intensity of the Stanford educational
experience. Perhaps the ideal can be
achieved. It seems that we at Stanford
have an unbelievable opportunity
that should not be squandered. The
professors, the students, and the re
sources of the University present an
environment of unmatched poten
tial.
The excellence I am seeking, and
must help to create, is one where
each class period would be intellec
tually and emotionally challenging.
The experience could be filled with
interactions, with challenges, with
exploration, with discovery. Each
time I enter a class I want to feel that
something important is aboutto hap
pen. I want to be upset, exhilarated,
surprised, and most importantly —
involved.

fort to react to a classroom situation.
There is a perceived risk of being
judged harshly by one's instructors
and peers. It is easier to sit quietly
than to speak.
There is a pervasive and unspoken
belief that the responsibility for the
quality of a student's classroom ex
perience rests upon the professor.
The class is seldom seen as an interac
tive process dependent upon the ac
tions of both the students and the
professors. As students we still do not
take responsibility for our own learn
ing.
This does not mean that professors
should be absolved from their re
sponsibilities for a course. Instead,
the concept of responsibility should
be broadened to include students as

well.
Were the students in the class pre
pared? Did they help stimulate you to
explore the material? Were interest
ing and important questions raised?
Was the professor's point of view
challenged?
Many courses here seem product
oriented. The goal is to complete the
mid-terms, papers and final. In many
classes students need rarely come; or
if attendance is required, partici
pation seldom is. The day-to-day
learning process can easily be over
shadowed by the goal of getting
things done.
One man I taught with character
ized his students as either "sponges"
or "stones." The material he present
ed would simply flow by the "stones"
in his class. The "sponges," on the
other hand, would soak up the bits of
knowledge we teachers dispensed.
The problem with this dichotomy
is that in both cases the students are
passive learners. This educational
process is very different from one
which emphasizes a type of partner
ship of teacher-student exploration
and discovery.
I have heard people say that there
is no time for more discussion and in
teraction: the curriculum must be
covered. The acquisition of bits and
pieces of knowledge, however,
seems a secondary educational goal
at best.
If the sole goal of the lecture for
mat is to present information to a
massive audience, perhaps the live
lecture could be junked. Material
could even be transcribed and read
much more quickly than listened to.
If efficiency of transmission is the
goal, other methods can be utilized.
There are obviously other reasons
for having lectures. Being present at a
live event — whether a lecture or a
football game — has an emotional
component that cannot be matched
by television. Sometimes this "effec
tive" component of learning is as
crucial as the cognitive one. Last
quarter I audited a history class
where the professor was so articulate
and so stimulating that I would have
paid to see him speak on almost any
subject.
Emotionally as well as intellectual
ly, it was a pleasure to be in his
classroom. More importantly, most
professors who give lectures do pro
vide for some student interaction.
Questions may be raised, clari
fications given, and comments solic
ited. Often these unplanned and im
promptu moments are among the
most important of the course. When
students are passive, these moments
never occur.
Note-taking is part of the same pas
sive process. I know I can easily take
notes without thinking. When taking

notes, students look busy and in
volved. A student who sits in a class
and simply listens might be viewed as
being cocky, lazy or bored. For most
of us, note-taking is almost a condi
tioned response. The professor be
gins to speak, we begin to write. As
long as we are busy taking notes, no
one condemns us for failing to ques
tion or think critically.
It would be interesting to see what
would happen if a professor pro
hibited note-taking and the only op
tions available to students were to sit
and listen and think and react. It
would also be interesting to know
how the ASSU note service is being
used. Does it free students to con
centrate in class, or are the notes sim
ply a back-up procedure to insure
nothing slips by the note-taking net?
What can be done? First, atten
dance can be emphasized or even re
quired. Being in class and contribut
ing can be made explicit class goals.
When a student is absent, it can be
made known that he/she was genu
inely missed. Names can be learned
by both the professor and other stu
dents to facilitate discussion and ex
change of ideas.
Second, the lecture format can be
modified to provide even more time
for interaction and questions. At dif
ferent points in a lecture, a professor
might stop and call on students by
name for their reactions.
Third, the traditional blockbuster
paper-test assignment pattern might
be altered. Every week students
could be asked to write short reac
tion papers to that week's readings.
Students could be required to come
to weekly seminars and discussions
with a prepared series of questions
about lectures and readings. Day-to
day participation could be em
phasized to a much greater degree.
Finally, there can be an awakening
to new possibilities, a raising of the
intensity of the Stanford educational
experience. Perhaps the ideal can be
achieved. It seems that we at Stanford
have an unbelievable opportunity
that should not be squandered. The
professors, the students, and the re
sources of the University present an
environment of unmatched poten
tial.
The excellence I am seeking, and
must help to create, is one where
each class period would be intellec
tually and emotionally challenging.
The experience could be filled with
interactions, with challenges, with
exploration, with discovery. Each
time I enter a class I want to feel that
something important is aboutto hap
pen. I want to be upset, exhilarated,
surprised, and most importantly —
involved.

During the Christmas vacation,
friends and relatives asked me how I
felt about my fall quarter at Stanford.
I found myself replying: "It was an
excellent quarter, but perhaps not as
excellent as it could conceivably
have been."
Hearing myself say this bothered
me, and I wanted to more thoroughly
clarify the quality of excellence I was
seeking. The comments that follow
are general in nature and not
directed at any specific individuals or
courses. Rather, they are intended to
help clarify my expectations and per
haps stimulate discussion.
The half dozen courses which I
took or audited have much in com
mon. The professors were prepared,
articulate and stimulating. The mate
rial seemed interesting and worth
while. On three or four of the course
evaluations I gave the professors
nothing but the highest ratings. Still,
something was missing.
Friends and I had talked about this
missing quality throughout the quar
ter. It seemed to be the result of a
passivity about the students — myself
included — in many of the classes I
attended. I knew that I would often
shuffle into the back of a lecture,
spread out my backpack, pull out the
notebook, and begin to take notes
like a robot.
I would be comfortable in the
knowledge that I would not be called
upon tooffer my opinion norwould I
be forced to react to the professor's
statements. In almost all of my
classes, only a very small number of
students ever spoke or raised ques
tions. The vast majority would enter,
silently take notes and leave.
This passivity obviously is learned.
The same students who sit so quietly
in a class setting often explode with
ideas in the hallways, the dorms or lo
cal bars.

school and elsewhere, students learn

seems a secondary educational goal
at best.
If the sole goal of the lecture for
mat is to present information to a
massive audience, perhaps the live
lecture could be junked. Material
could even be transcribed and read
much more quickly than listened to.
If efficiency of transmission is the
goal, other methods can be utilized.
There are obviously other reasons
for having lectures. Being present at a
live event — whether a lecture or a
football game — has an emotional
component that cannot be matched
by television. Sometimes this "effec
tive" component of learning is as
crucial as the cognitive one. Last
quarter I audited a history class
where the professor was so articulate
and so stimulating that I would have
paid to see him speak on almost any
subject.
Emotionally as well as intellectual
ly, it was a pleasure to be in his
classroom. More importantly, most
professors who give lectures do pro
vide for some student interaction.
Questions may be raised, clari
fications given, and comments solic
ited. Often these unplanned and im
promptu moments are among the
most important of the course. When
students are passive, these moments
never occur.
Note-taking is part of the same pas
sive process. I know I can easily take
notes without thinking. When taking

notes, students look busy and in
volved. A student who sits in a class
and simply listens might be viewed as
being cocky, lazy or bored. For most
of us, note-taking is almost a condi
tioned response. The professor be
gins to speak, we begin to write. As
long as we are busy taking notes, no
one condemns us for failing to ques
tion or think critically.
It would be interesting to see what
would happen if a professor pro
hibited note-taking and the only op
tions available to students were to sit
and listen and think and react. It
would also be interesting to know
how the ASSU note service is being
used. Does it free students to con
centrate in class, or are the notes sim
ply a back-up procedure to insure
nothing slips by the note-taking net?
What can be done? First, atten
dance can be emphasized or even re
quired. Being in class and contribut
ing can be made explicit class goals.
When a student is absent, it can be
made known that he/she was genu
inely missed. Names can be learned
by both the professor and other stu
dents to facilitate discussion and ex
change of ideas.
Second, the lecture format can be
modified to provide even more time
for interaction and questions. At dif
ferent points in a lecture, a professor
might stop and call on students by
name for their reactions.
Third, the traditional blockbuster
paper-test assignment pattern might
be altered. Every week students
could be asked to write short reac
tion papers to that week's readings.
Students could be required to come
to weekly seminars and discussions
with a prepared series of questions
about lectures and readings. Day-to
day participation could be em
phasized to a much greater degree.
Finally, there can be an awakening
to new possibilities, a raising of the
intensity of the Stanford educational
experience. Perhaps the ideal can be
achieved. It seems that we at Stanford
have an unbelievable opportunity
that should not be squandered. The
professors, the students, and the re
sources of the University present an
environment of unmatched poten
tial.
The excellence I am seeking, and
must help to create, is one where
each class period would be intellec
tually and emotionally challenging.
The experience could be filled with
interactions, with challenges, with
exploration, with discovery. Each
time I enter a class I want to feel that
something important is aboutto hap
pen. I want to be upset, exhilarated,
surprised, and most importantly —
involved.
