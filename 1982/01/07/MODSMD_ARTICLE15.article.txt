## Nonexistent influence doesn't decline 
### 
I am writing in response to Garey Ramey's article
"Europe: Collapsing Economy" (Daily, Jan. 5). The
article starts with the writer indicating his ig
norance of history and soon goes into exhibiting
the writer's ignorance of economics. As an expert
in European history, I find it necessary to point out
two things with regard to Ramey's article.
First, the writer states that "since the Greeks van
quished their Persian foes in the days of Alexander,
Europe has remained the world's most important
and influential region." This is totally wrong, as
anyone with the least knowledge of Europe's his
tory would be glad to tell Ramey.
Soon after Alexander's death, the Persians were
powerful again in their own land, often domi
nating all the countries between India and the
Eastern coast of the Mediterranean. The Greeks
and later the Romans dominated the Mediter
ranean until the end of the 7th century, when the
Arabs and other Islamic people pushed the Ro
mans not only out of the eastern and southern

coasts of the Mediterranean Sea but actually oc
cupied large parts of Europe itself.
Furthermore, the Moslems dominated world
commerce until the 15th century. I will not go into
any more details on this point; suffice it to say that
Ramey's article reflects the unforgivable tendency
of American textbooks of world history to see the
latter in terms of Europe's history.
Second, it is true, however, that since the early
17th, and probably mid-16th century, Europe was
the world's most powerful region until the end of
World War II when American and Soviet super
powers emerged. Nonetheless, there is no basis
whatsoever to Ramey's assertion that "Today,
however, European influence is collapsing. This
decline is so abrupt, so complete and so devas
tating that it virtually defies historical com
parison."
Unfortunately, Ramey's knowledge of history
obviously does not qualify him for historical com
parison even if Europe's decline was "so abrupt, so

complete, and so devastating," which it is not.
It is true that European colonial powers have
been kicked out of their former colonies in Asia,
Africa and Latin America. But it is not true that Eu
ropean economies are declining. On the contrary,
unemployment rates in such European capitalist
countries as West Germany, Switzerland, Sweden,
Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium, are low
er than they are in the United States. There is vir
tually no unemployment in socialist Europe.
Furthermore, such social services as aid to the
needy and elderly throughout Europe are much
better than they are in the United States.
The presence of such European manufactured
goods as Volvos, Mercedes', Triumphs, etc., in
America, is certainly no sign of the irreversible de
cline Ramey talks about.
