## This time, student loans really fall due 
### 
Columbus, Ohio — Look out
American college students, past and
present. An experienced team of bill
collectors is about to stalk the biggest
kitty you've thrown their way: those
delinquent student loan repayments.
Almost $700 million in outstanding
loans dating from 1965 are, or will be,
past due by 1984, according to the
Education Department, which has for
the first time hired a private collec
tion agency to get the money back.
Representatives from Payco Amer
ican Corp., the largest collection
agency in the world, plan to "knock
on doors" as early as next February.
Payco Chairman Richard Horn says
that the company's sheer pro
fessionalism can make a sizeable
dent in the backlog of unpaid debts.
"These students aren't deadbeats —
they're not at all," Horn concedes,
contending that the federal govern
ment has been negligent in its own
collection duties.
Payco's strategy for students differs
little from that of its other collection

schemes. But Horn plans to in
corporate some special tactics to
bluff about 400,000 Americans (ac
cording to Education Department es
timates) who owe Uncle Sam be
tween $800 and $2200, but are over 30
days late in payment.

"We'll appeal to their moral re
sponsibility as well as to the proven
benefit of their education," said Neal
Sparby at Payco's Milwaukee head
quarters. "Over 70 percent of the de
faults are over eight years old, and, as
a consequence, most of the debtors

are at least 30 and probably em
ployed."'
Therefore, the most difficult task is
finding debtors, Sparby adds. "If we
can get a hold of them, they usually
show a willingness to make the effort
to begin repayment."

For the moment, Payco is suffi
ciently excited about the large size of
its government contract to profess
patience with delinquent student
loan-holders. Sparby reminded our
reporter, Michael Duffy, that a 1978
federal law prevents Payco from

threatening debtors "in any fashion
at all." The company (whose name
may soon become a household word
for many families) also pointed out
that available information about
debtors' financial status will be lim
ited.
"It's distressing," Sparby said. "If
we find someone who just won't pay,
there's nothing much we can do
about it. We'll just turn the case over
to the Justice Department, where
there's (another multi-year)
backlog."
Payco surely has its work cut out
for it. Most of our friends with out
standing loans know full well their
obligation but will do most anything,
it seems, to sidestep it. We appreciate
the good word that the company has
put in for our generation. But even
Payco may find tougher language
necessary if it wants to get the job
done.
