## Continue to seek planets'secrets

Proposals are being considered to
cancel the Jupiter Galileo or
biter/probe, the Venus Orbiter Im
aging Radar (VOIR), U.S. partici
pation in the Halley's Comet ren
dezvous and even to shut down the
Deep Space Network (DSN) of re
ceiving antennae, thereby muting
forever Voyager 2
Yet, the launching of space probes
to the planets of our solar system pro
vided mankind with the first op
portunities to study distant worlds us
ing robotic sensors within the very
environments themselves.
These proposals were made be
cause of cuts in NASA's budget man
dated by the Reagan administration.
The science advisor, George Key
worth, has advocated the cancella
tion of all new starts for planetary ex
ploration for the next decade.
The gathering of information from
these spacecraft is a tremendous
achievement, unique in history. I
wish to relate some of what we have
learned about two of our fellow
planets, Venus and Jupiter.
Venus, with her veils of clouds, has
long personified the inherent mys
tery of alien worlds. Mariner, Venera
and Pioneer spacecraft have revealed
more and more of the secrets of
Earth's sister planet. Her charm was
not thereby diminished, but rather
enhanced through the wonders of
the reality of different nature.
The golden, luminous clouds are
droplets of concentrated sulfuric
acid; the temperature on the ground
is hot enough to melt lead; the at

mosphere is 90 times denser than
Earth's, at a pressure equivalent to
that at an ocean depth of 900 meters.
The air is so thick that everything we
could see would be curved by re
fraction (yes, under certain condi
tions, we might be able to see the
backs of our own heads!). Plants
might love the 90 percent-carbon
dioxide air, but humans and animals
would quickly gag and die,
Is this horrible place, divinely
named Venus, a joke on the sensi
bilities of man? A beautiful shining
light in the evening sky concealing
such a hellish condition is not a mor
dant trick visited upon mankind by
some evil genius; it is an unsubtle re
minder that anthropocentric notions
of good and bad have no meaning in
the eternal scheme.
What will be, will be determined
by the laws of nature, just as we
ourselves are so determined. Instead
of recoiling in horror, wonder at the
infinite variety of our little solar sys
tem.
The picture of Jupiter gained from
the Voyager spacecraft is one not
only of great beauty, but also of great
complexity. It encompasses a diverse
radiation field of solar, satellite and
interplanetary origin, and that field's
interaction with a rapidly whirling

magnetosphere-ionosphere system.
Jupiter is a light, spinning world
with whirling gases, surrounded by
lethal radiation. Can this be a part of
us also? It can be and most definitely
is. The variety of nature is again un
compromisingly manifested; we can
only stare in wonder, and then bow
our heads to ponder.
This then is an example of pure sci
entific inquiry: the understanding
for its own sake of the universe and
by extension the understanding of
ourselves. To ascribe profit or materi
al gain to such endeavor is nonsense.
Much basic scientific research of
great value is done by private in
dustry, but the exploration of the
universe is not a management-justifi
able enterprise because there is no
discernible material return.
The United States is the only coun
try that has sent spacecraft to the out
er planets. In a world fraught with
baneful concerns, planetary explora
tion stands as a beacon of man's en
lightened spirit. There are functions
which are government's province;
for a rich and creative nation, the
pursuit of knowledge for its own sake
is one.

Venus, with her veils of clouds, has
long personified the inherent mys
tery of alien worlds. Mariner, Venera
and Pioneer spacecraft have revealed
more and more of the secrets of
Earth's sister planet. Her charm was
not thereby diminished, but rather
enhanced through the wonders of
the reality of different nature.
The golden, luminous clouds are
droplets of concentrated sulfuric
acid; the temperature on the ground
is hot enough to melt lead; the at

mosphere is 90 times denser than
Earth's, at a pressure equivalent to
that at an ocean depth of 900 meters.
The air is so thick that everything we
could see would be curved by re
fraction (yes, under certain condi
tions, we might be able to see the
backs of our own heads!). Plants
might love the 90 percent-carbon
dioxide air, but humans and animals
would quickly gag and die,
Is this horrible place, divinely
named Venus, a joke on the sensi
bilities of man? A beautiful shining
light in the evening sky concealing
such a hellish condition is not a mor
dant trick visited upon mankind by
some evil genius; it is an unsubtle re
minder that anthropocentric notions
of good and bad have no meaning in
the eternal scheme.
What will be, will be determined
by the laws of nature, just as we
ourselves are so determined. Instead
of recoiling in horror, wonder at the
infinite variety of our little solar sys
tem.
The picture of Jupiter gained from
the Voyager spacecraft is one not
only of great beauty, but also of great
complexity. It encompasses a diverse
radiation field of solar, satellite and
interplanetary origin, and that field's
interaction with a rapidly whirling

magnetosphere-ionosphere system.
Jupiter is a light, spinning world
with whirling gases, surrounded by
lethal radiation. Can this be a part of
us also? It can be and most definitely
is. The variety of nature is again un
compromisingly manifested; we can
only stare in wonder, and then bow
our heads to ponder.
This then is an example of pure sci
entific inquiry: the understanding
for its own sake of the universe and
by extension the understanding of
ourselves. To ascribe profit or materi
al gain to such endeavor is nonsense.
Much basic scientific research of
great value is done by private in
dustry, but the exploration of the
universe is not a management-justifi
able enterprise because there is no
discernible material return.
The United States is the only coun
try that has sent spacecraft to the out
er planets. In a world fraught with
baneful concerns, planetary explora
tion stands as a beacon of man's en
lightened spirit. There are functions
which are government's province;
for a rich and creative nation, the
pursuit of knowledge for its own sake
is one.
