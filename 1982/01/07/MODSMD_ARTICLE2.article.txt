# Assault investigations lack evidence

Investigations into the series of assaults com
mitted here since the beginning of fall quarter
have been hampered by a lack of concrete evi
dence.
"There's no common denominator of location,
time or victim type. They have been random acts of
violence," according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Rapes have occurred near Stanford Stadium and
next to Memorial Church. One rape attempt oc
curred in the Quad, while another rape attempt
was reported near Tresidder Union, and a third in
the parking lot near the Physics Building. Tuesday's
rape was on the bike path near the Stanford family
Mausoleum.
Normally there are three to five police units on
campus. This number has increased this year, ac
cording to Herrington, and as many as 20 units
have been patrolling the campus at one time. Since

the Stanford police department is within the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's domain, the University does
get extra units from the Sheriff's department.
The inner campus foot patrol is both uniformed
and in plain clothes. "We're concentrating our ef
forts on the night patrol since it's hard to de
termine who suspicious characters are during the
day. There are just too many people on campus at
one time," said Herrington.
Tuesday's incident should sober the widespread
attitude that women on bicycles are less vulner
able than pedestrians. Herrington emphasized the
importance of bikers taking the same precautions
as pedestrians. The police department has issued a
map of suggested walking routes. It is designed to
maximize the lighted corridors on campus by in
creasing traffic density.
Herrington said, "The flip side of community,
awareness is the inevitable fading of enthusiasm
for these precautions. Lateness, bad weather and

convenience prompt women to take more expe
dient paths or to walk alone."
Regarding the usefulness of media coverage,
Herrington said he has mixed feelings. During No
vember, the local media coverage of the Stanford
campus rapes was exceptionally heavy. San Fran
cisco's KRON-TV interviewed women on campus
and did live coverage from in front of Hoover Tow
er at night. And according to Herrington, the local
newspapers gave considerably more space to
rapes committed here than similar crimes com
mitted in Palo Alto and Menlo Park during Novem
ber.
"The potential for giving satisfaction to the rapist
or inciting other sexual crimes is small compared
to the awareness generated by such coverage,"
said Herrington.
"We have a lower crime rate than the surround
ing community ... I think it's because sexual as
saults get talked about here," he said.
