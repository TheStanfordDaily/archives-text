## Features on the Environment Is L.A. turning Mono Lake into the 'Dead Sea of California'? 
### Fred Beddall 
Mono Lake, located a few
miles east of the Sierra Nevada
crest near Yosemite National
Park, is one of the oldest and
most productive lakes in North
America. Though dubbed by
Mark Twain "the Dead Sea of
California," Mono Lake's
alkaline waters are very much
alive — with trillions of brine
shrimp and brine flies, and mil
lions of migratory birds which
feed on them.
But Mono Lake may soon
live up to its old reputation af
ter all. This summer, more than
95 percent of the California
Gulls hatched there — 25,000
chicks — died of starvation.
Adult birds could not feed
their young because the popu
lation of brine shrimp in the
lake (their primary food
source) decreased suddenly in
June to less than 15 percent of
its usual size. Mono Lake
biologists say they have no
conclusive proof of the cause
of the brine shrimp drop, but
there is one certain suspect:
the city of Los Angeles.
Since 1941 Mono Lake's four
major tributary streams have
flowed into the Los Angeles
Aqueduct and not the lake,
providing roughly 17 percent
of the city's water. Among the
consequences of diversion
have been a dwindling lake
surface, predator invasion of
nesting sites on former islands,
alkali dust storms, and increas
ing salinity of the lake — a pos
sible cause of the shrimp mor
tality, according to David
Gaines, chairman of the Mono
Lake Committee (MLC). Each
year the lake level has dropped
until now the lake is at its low
est in at least 15,000 years, he
said.
The MLC, a group of
biologists, hikers and local resi
dents based in nearby Lee Vin
ing, wants Los Angeles to limit

water diversions to levels that
are not environmentally de
structive. Gaines cited a state
study, published in December
1979, that concluded that a re
duction of Mono
Lake's diversions in wet years
could stabilize the lake's sur
face level and assure biological
productivity.
The study was the result of
the Interagency Task Force on
Mono Lake that included rep
resentatives of the California
Department of Water Re
sources, Mono County, the In
terior Department, and the Los
Angeles Department of Water
and Power (DWP). The DWP
alone dissented from the task
force conclusion that the re
duced water supply for Los An
geles could be compensated
by replacing outdated, ineffi
cient plumbing and by recycl
ing waste water, without im
posing conservation or chang
ing lifestyles.
According to Bruce Kuebler
of the DWP aqueduct division,
the assumed impact of con
servation was unrealistic.
"Statistics from across the state
show that water consumption
has rebounded to pre-drought
levels, not just in Los Angeles,
but in San Diego, Oakland, and
Marin County as well."
Nevertheless, he said, the
DWP has an active and costly
conservation program. Los An
geles was the only city in the
state to distribute home water
conservation kits without state
aid, at a cost of more than
$900,000. Moreover, the DWP
has abolished discounts for
large users and includes two
year water use data on all
homeowner water bills.
However, David Freyberg,
assistant professor of civil engi
neering at Stanford, com
mented that people use as
much water as they perceive is
available, and expect their wa

ter commissioners to provide
water, not publicize scarcity.
"L.A. does have fairly low per
capita use compared to other
cities in the state," Freyberg

said. "Nevertheless I doubt
that water is priced to take ac
count of the much higher cost
of securing a new water source.
Every additional gallon today

costs a lot more than it used
to."
According to Gaines, Los An
geles already has alternatives to
tapping the Mono Basin. As a

member of the Southern Cali
fornia Metropolitan Water Dis
trict, the city pays for the right
to use state water, but doesn't
claim its share.

"Basically, the reason is this:
Mono water is a lot cheaper,"
said Freyberg. "The California
water, which requires ex
pensive pumping to climb the

Tehachapi Pass south of Bak
ersfield, can only get more ex
pensive as energy costs rise.
But the Mono aqueduct is grav
ity flow, and actually generates
some electricity and profit for
the DWP."
National recognition of
Mono Lake's predicament has
been increasing. This summer
Rep. Norm Shumway (R-Mod
esto) introducted legislation
(HR 4057) to establish a na
tional monument around
Mono Lake. The bill mandates
federal study of alternatives to
diversions but takes no action
to interrupt the current Los An
geles use.
The MLC is supporting na
tional monument status as an
important first step towards
preserving the scenic and natu
ral values of the area. Gaines
said he was surprised that the
DWP should vigorously op
pose the bill, since the At
torney General has certified
that water rights would not be
affected.
But according to Kuebler,
"It's obvious what the motive is
— to protect the lake. Protect it
from what — the city's diver
sions. Saying the bill wouldn't
affect L.A. water is like pointing
a loaded shotgun at someone's
head and promising not to fire.
There's a clear conflict be
tween our continued use of the
water and the national mon
ument management doctrine,
which says 'preserve the re
source unimpaired for future
generations.' "
Shortly after the introduc
tion of Shumway's national
monument legislation, nine
Southern California con
gressmen introduced a bill (HR

4403) to guarantee the Los An
geles use of Mono water in
perpetuity and to revoke fed
eral control of the aqueduct
right of way.
The DWP has also applied to
purchase more than 20,000
acres of federal lakeshore. The
MLC maintains that DWP own
ership would make a national
monument practically im
possible. But Kuebler down
played the seriousness of the
purchase proposal, which he
called a "paper tiger."
While the arguments, and
the diversions, go on, some be
lieve that a final solution to the
Mono Lake problem will not
be resolved by disputes over
whose water conservation fig
ures are correct, but by a re
alization that overall changes
in water usage attitudes are
needed.
"I deplore the morality that
can justify devastating the area
from which their water
comes," lamented Gaines. "It's
not a question of need, it's a
question of greed. In wet years
California water flows into the
sea. If we could only save some
of that water for Mono Lake we
could preserve this ex
traordinary and beautiful natu
ral resource. And in the dry
years, when the water was real
ly needed for human use, we
could provide it too."
Freyberg agreed that the de
cline of Mono Lake results
from poor state-wide water
management. "All of us in Cali
fornia are wasteful," he said.
"More conscientious and effi
cient husbandry is needed not
just to save Mono Lake but to
solveourother water problems
as well."
