## Movies/ Steve Vineberg Pennies from Heaven' worth a million 
### Steve Vineberg 
Pennies from Heaven is a great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and astonishing ever made. The
director, Herbert Ross, staged the musical numbers in
Funny Girl, which were tasteful and polished, and the
ballet sequences in his film The Turning Point were so
elegantly shot that they nearly saved the movie, but
nothing in his career prepares one for the inventiveness
and command he demonstrates here. His straight films
have been professional hack jobs at best, often sen
timental and overbearing; even his good movies, like
The Owl and the Pussycat and The Seven-Per-Cent Solu
tion, have been trifles. I include this catalogue of his past
projects not to put Ross down, but because in Pennies
from Heaven this second-rater has propelled himself
into the first rank and done something no one has ever
thought of before. Pennies from Heaven is about the
need for illusion, which is a startling theme for a musical
because it is the truth behind the idea of musical comedy
— the reason why musicals exist in the first place. And in
order to illuminate his theme, Ross and his choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, and his costumer, Bob Mackie,
have ravaged the history of movie musicals, spinning off
in alt directions from the pictures that have inspired
them.
Musical comedy Is a trick mirror that transforms grim
reality into optimism. In the 1930s when Pennies from
Heaven is set, the musical films didn't ignore the hard
tunes — penniless show girls steal their neighbor's milk
in Gold Diggers of 1933, Fred Astaire hasn't a sou in
Swing Time, and the hero of Hallelujah, I'm a Bum! pan
handles in Central Park. The major difference between
the world of these pictures and the world outside the
movie palaces was one of tone, no one despaired in a
musical, because a blue sky and romance were always
justaround the corner. If audiences had not been able to
recognize the details of their everyday lives in these mov
ies and seen themselves in the characters, they could not
have been swept away by what they watched. Pennies
from Heaven goes one step further: the characters in it
are so trapped in their own lives — so stunted by poverty
and sexual frustration that they respond to their mi
sery by turning it into musical comedy. It's not at all a
farfetched idea. In the novel Loon Lake, also set in the
Depression, E.L. Doctorow has his young protagonist,
Joe, describe how he handles the rigors of an awful fac
tory job: "I am Fred Astaire in top hat and tails tossing up
the screws into the holes, bouncing the frames on the
floor and catching them in my top hat of tin. I twirl the
headlight kick it on the belt, with a backward flip of my
heel... Soon everyone in the plant has picked up on my
routine — everyone is dancing! The foreman comes
pirouetting along, putting stars next to each name on his
clipboard. And descending from the steel rafter by in
sulated wire to dance backward on the moving parade ol
car bodies, Mr. Bennett himself in white tie and tails
He's singing with a smile, he's flinging money from his
hands like stardust."
This passage might be a blueprint for the first dance
number in Pennies from Heaven. Arthur (Steve Martin)
an unsuccessful pop composer who dreams of openingi
music shop, attempts to obtain a loan from a bank, but ii
refused point blank by the manager (Jay Garner). Sud
denly the two men begin to dance, mouthing the word'

to an old recording by Sam Browne and the Carlyle
Cousins called "(My Baby Said) Yes, Yes!" while silver
wigged chorus girls in silver-studded black leotards with
mink collars anc&eathered caps kick and roll giant coins
that evoke, of course, Busby Berkeley's "We're in the
Money" number from Gold Diggers of 1933. (There's
even a Berkleyesque aerial shot.)
The concept of gritty realistic settings
bursting into song — someone else's song, lip-synched
by the actors — was thought up by the screenwriter,
Dennis Potter, who originally used it on his six-part BBC
series of the same name. (Only once in the film does one
of the performers sing in his own voice; the contrast is
tremendously moving.) I didn't see the television show,
so I don't know how much of the original story he altered
for the film or exactly how the songs (which I understand
were far more modestly staged) were related to the emo
tional state of the characters. In the movie the songs are
all epiphanies. The characters — the hopeless liar and
philanderer Arthur; his wife Joan (Jessica Harper), who is
so repressed that her acquiescence to his desires twists
her terrified love for him into vicious sexual hatred;
Eileen (Bernadette Peters), the spinster schoolteacher
whom Arthur impregnates; the black hobo-mysician
(Vernel Bagneris) whom Arthur treats to dinner; Eileen's
humorless principal (John McMartin); and the others
are suffused with emotion that they cannot express in
any other way, so the songs burst out of them. I've never
seen so much emotional intensfty in a musical; the acting
of these five performers has a purity and untrammelled
range that recall the best acting in D.W. Griffith's movies.
It is gloriously appropriate — and perhaps not accidental
— that the depiction of the moment before each song,
when these people are trembling with feeling that
freezes in their eyes, should most closely approach the
portrayal of feeling in silent movies. These moments are
so terrifyingly vivid that the musical numbers are as
much a release for us as they are for the characters.
I've always liked Steve Martin, but I never imagined he
had the depth to play a dramatic role like this one. In fact,
the generally unfavorable response his performance has
drawn from many people 112 know, and from many other
critics, may derive from the expectations we have of him;
unless he lowered his voice an octave and played
Shakespeare without a single affectation, I'm not sure
audiences would register that he's departing radically
from his usual comic style. (The poor notices John Trav
olta received in Blow Out are another example of this
kind of confusion.) But Martin is different in this movie,
and he's different from scene to scene, too. At first, his
eyes, his aggressive-passive face and his slightly lagging
line readings in that wide, friendlyfnidwestern twang are
amiable and disarming; then he slicks his hair back, his
eyes grow still bigger and his itchy discontent turns to a
fierce self-confidence that j» more than a little fright
ening. Martin manages to make Arthur both sympathetic
and slightly repellent,
All the acting fe extraordinary — down to Eliska
Krupka's brief appearance as a blind girl who suggests
the doomed beauty of Mae Murray in Birth of a Nation
and Intolerance — but Bernadette Peters' work in this
picture is so monumental that it eclipses anything any
other actress has done on screen all year. Peters can con
vey two or three conflicting emotions in one look; she

shows us Eileen, who starts as a schoolteacher and ends
up a whore, simultaneously fighting against destruction
and hurtling toward it. Sincere and vulnerable, she also
has a sharp edge deep inside her — a razor's edge that
her emotions are precariously balanced on.
No musical has ever captured a period as sensuously as
MPennies from Heaven, which was conceived by Ross, Bob
Mackie, Ken Adam (the visual consultant), Fred Tuch
and Bernie Cutler (the art directors) and Gordon Willis
(the cinematographer) in the style of Edward Hopper's
paintings — and occasionally Walker Evans' photo
graphs. For many of us, Hopper and Evans express the
spirit of the Depression — Hopper's rich, nocturnal
scenes in particular find the poetry in the alienation of
emaciated figures in underlit cafes and gas stations, liv
ing out hopeless lives. To tap the resources of his paint
ings in this movie was a stroke of genius. Several are ac
tually reproduced — notably "Nighthawks" and "Movie
Palace" — and the reproductions are meticulous
without being merely academic. The photography re
minded me of the experiments John Alofiso made in
Farewell, My Lovely andlLaszlo Kovacs in Paradise Alley,
but it's fuller, less gimmicky; you believe that people
could live in this ambiance. I have no idea how Willis got
the look of the film so close to Hopper —" the very air
seems neon lit — but it's the most remarkable work yet
from one of our most gifted photographers.
Herbert Ross's collaborators (including the editor,
Richard Marks) have harmonized in this film. The musi
cal numbers are so beautifully worked out that they are
like the harvest of years and years of developing craft. Ex
cept for Steve Martin (who dances wonderfully) and
Eliska Krupka, the cast is made up entirely of performers
who rose from the ranks of Broadway and off-Broadway
hoofers — it's an assembly of kindred spirits.
This collection of talent enables Ross to be as
audacious as he is and take his conception as far as it can
go. I've never seen a musical as imaginative or a com
mercial American film as offbeat as this one that is so
brilliantly sustained. (New York, New York isn't this dar
ing, and as amazing as most of it is, it keeps falling apart.)
Ross never repeats himself in the numbers; you may
think you've seen the ace up his sleeve in the art deco
bank number, but he's just warming up. White-suited
children tap dance on white pianos in one number — it's
the "Words Are in My Heart" extravaganza from Cold
Diggers of 1935 but with a set full of Shirley Temples and
Bobby Breens. A trio, with Martin, Tommy Rail and Rob
ert Fitch dressed as music hall buskers mouthing the
Boswell Sisters' "It's the Girl" — a celebration of Arthur's
new love affair — ends in a cynical juxtaposition of ro
mance and lust. Bernadette Peters' "I Want to Be Bad" is
like a compendium of all of Busby Berkeley's most snig
gering ensembles — like "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" — and
Christopher Walken, who shows up in a pin stripe suit
and purple tie as a pimp, does the most unsettling strip
tease you've ever seen. Ross doesn't only contrast the re
ality of the dramatic scenes with the fantasy of the songs;
the most ambitious numbers contain that tension within
them. Joan's ambivalence toward her husband is com
municated in "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie," and in "Pennies
from Heaven," Vernel Bagneris' drawn face and
strained, bird-like movements — as well as the huge
blow-up of a starving tramp behind him — belie the

cheeriness of the lyric and the promise provided by the
coins that rain on him as he dances. (There is no doubt
that this dance is one of the high points in the history of
musicals.) And in one scene, Arthur and Eileen watch
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers perform "Let's Face the
Music and Dance" from the 1936 Follow the Fleet — one
of their most dramatic pas de deux — and, silhouetted
dwarf versions of the huge projected images, they im
itate the dance and finally replace it on screen with their
own, darker vision of the number.
Pennies from Heaven is the first original musical to be
filmed at MGM in more than 25 years. It is fitting that
Herbert Ross should have made this movie on the stages
of the studio where so much first-rate work was done in
this medium in the forties and fifties. If Ross owes a debt
to those earlier musicals, and the RKO and Warners mu
sicals of the thirties, he has repaid it by giving them layers
of meaning they couldn't have had before. You may nev
er watch those old movies in the same way again after
seeing Pennies from Heaven, because your vision will
have been altered, deepened. That's what art does.

like the harvest of years and years of developing craft. Ex

Eliska Krupka, the cast is made up entirely of performers
who rose from the ranks of Broadway and off-Broadway

This collection of talent enables Ross to be as
audacious as he is and take his conception as far as it can
go. I've never seen a musical as imaginative or a com
mercial American film as offbeat as this one that is so
brilliantly sustained. (New York, New York isn't this dar

Ross never repeats himself in the numbers; you may
think you've seen the ace up his sleeve in the art deco
bank number, but he's just warming up. White-suited
children tap dance on white pianos in one number — it's
the "Words Are in My Heart" extravaganza from Cold
Diggers of 1935 but with a set full of Shirley Temples and
Bobby Breens. A trio, with Martin, Tommy Rail and Rob
ert Fitch dressed as music hall buskers mouthing the
Boswell Sisters' "It's the Girl" — a celebration of Arthur's
new love affair — ends in a cynical juxtaposition of ro

like a compendium of all of Busby Berkeley's most snig
gering ensembles — like "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" — and
Christopher Walken, who shows up in a pin stripe suit
and purple tie as a pimp, does the most unsettling strip
tease you've ever seen. Ross doesn't only contrast the re
ality of the dramatic scenes with the fantasy of the songs;
the most ambitious numbers contain that tension within
them. Joan's ambivalence toward her husband is com
municated in "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie," and in "Pennies
from Heaven," Vernel Bagneris' drawn face and
strained, bird-like movements — as well as the huge
blow-up of a starving tramp behind him — belie the

cheeriness of the lyric and the promise provided by the
coins that rain on him as he dances. (There is no doubt
that this dance is one of the high points in the history of
musicals.) And in one scene, Arthur and Eileen watch
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers perform "Let's Face the
Music and Dance" from the 1936 Follow the Fleet — one
of their most dramatic pas de deux — and, silhouetted
dwarf versions of the huge projected images, they im
itate the dance and finally replace it on screen with their
own, darker vision of the number.
Pennies from Heaven is the first original musical to be
filmed at MGM in more than 25 years. It is fitting that
Herbert Ross should have made this movie on the stages
of the studio where so much first-rate work was done in
this medium in the forties and fifties. If Ross owes a debt
to those earlier musicals, and the RKO and Warners mu
sicals of the thirties, he has repaid it by giving them layers
of meaning they couldn't have had before. You may nev
er watch those old movies in the same way again after
seeing Pennies from Heaven, because your vision will
have been altered, deepened. That's what art does.

to play a dramatic role like this
one. . . Bernadette Peters can
convey two or three conflicting
emotions in one look.
Pennies from Heaven is a great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and astonishing ever made. The
director, Herbert Ross, staged the musical numbers in
Funny Girl, which were tasteful and polished, and the
ballet sequences in his film The Turning Point were so
elegantly shot that they nearly saved the movie, but
nothing in his career prepares one for the inventiveness
and command he demonstrates here. His straight films
have been professional hack jobs at best, often sen
timental and overbearing; even his good movies, like
The Owl and the Pussycat and The Seven-Per-Cent Solu
tion, have been trifles. I include this catalogue of his past
projects not to put Ross down, but because in Pennies
from Heaven this second-rater has propelled himself
into the first rank and done something no one has ever
thought of before. Pennies from Heaven is about the
need for illusion, which is a startling theme for a musical
because it is the truth behind the idea of musical comedy
— the reason why musicals exist in the first place. And in
order to illuminate his theme, Ross and his choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, and his costumer, Bob Mackie,
have ravaged the history of movie musicals, spinning off
in alt directions from the pictures that have inspired
them.
Musical comedy Is a trick mirror that transforms grim
reality into optimism. In the 1930s when Pennies from
Heaven is set, the musical films didn't ignore the hard
tunes — penniless show girls steal their neighbor's milk
in Gold Diggers of 1933, Fred Astaire hasn't a sou in
Swing Time, and the hero of Hallelujah, I'm a Bum! pan
handles in Central Park. The major difference between
the world of these pictures and the world outside the
movie palaces was one of tone, no one despaired in a
musical, because a blue sky and romance were always
justaround the corner. If audiences had not been able to
recognize the details of their everyday lives in these mov
ies and seen themselves in the characters, they could not
have been swept away by what they watched. Pennies
from Heaven goes one step further: the characters in it
are so trapped in their own lives — so stunted by poverty
and sexual frustration that they respond to their mi
sery by turning it into musical comedy. It's not at all a
farfetched idea. In the novel Loon Lake, also set in the
Depression, E.L. Doctorow has his young protagonist,
Joe, describe how he handles the rigors of an awful fac
tory job: "I am Fred Astaire in top hat and tails tossing up
the screws into the holes, bouncing the frames on the
floor and catching them in my top hat of tin. I twirl the
headlight kick it on the belt, with a backward flip of my
heel... Soon everyone in the plant has picked up on my
routine — everyone is dancing! The foreman comes
pirouetting along, putting stars next to each name on his
clipboard. And descending from the steel rafter by in
sulated wire to dance backward on the moving parade ol
car bodies, Mr. Bennett himself in white tie and tails
He's singing with a smile, he's flinging money from his
hands like stardust."
This passage might be a blueprint for the first dance
number in Pennies from Heaven. Arthur (Steve Martin)
an unsuccessful pop composer who dreams of openingi
music shop, attempts to obtain a loan from a bank, but ii
refused point blank by the manager (Jay Garner). Sud
denly the two men begin to dance, mouthing the word'

to an old recording by Sam Browne and the Carlyle
Cousins called "(My Baby Said) Yes, Yes!" while silver
wigged chorus girls in silver-studded black leotards with
mink collars anc&eathered caps kick and roll giant coins
that evoke, of course, Busby Berkeley's "We're in the
Money" number from Gold Diggers of 1933. (There's
even a Berkleyesque aerial shot.)
The concept of gritty realistic settings
bursting into song — someone else's song, lip-synched
by the actors — was thought up by the screenwriter,
Dennis Potter, who originally used it on his six-part BBC
series of the same name. (Only once in the film does one
of the performers sing in his own voice; the contrast is
tremendously moving.) I didn't see the television show,
so I don't know how much of the original story he altered
for the film or exactly how the songs (which I understand
were far more modestly staged) were related to the emo
tional state of the characters. In the movie the songs are
all epiphanies. The characters — the hopeless liar and
philanderer Arthur; his wife Joan (Jessica Harper), who is
so repressed that her acquiescence to his desires twists
her terrified love for him into vicious sexual hatred;
Eileen (Bernadette Peters), the spinster schoolteacher
whom Arthur impregnates; the black hobo-mysician
(Vernel Bagneris) whom Arthur treats to dinner; Eileen's
humorless principal (John McMartin); and the others
are suffused with emotion that they cannot express in
any other way, so the songs burst out of them. I've never
seen so much emotional intensfty in a musical; the acting
of these five performers has a purity and untrammelled
range that recall the best acting in D.W. Griffith's movies.
It is gloriously appropriate — and perhaps not accidental
— that the depiction of the moment before each song,
when these people are trembling with feeling that
freezes in their eyes, should most closely approach the
portrayal of feeling in silent movies. These moments are
so terrifyingly vivid that the musical numbers are as
much a release for us as they are for the characters.
I've always liked Steve Martin, but I never imagined he
had the depth to play a dramatic role like this one. In fact,
the generally unfavorable response his performance has
drawn from many people 112 know, and from many other
critics, may derive from the expectations we have of him;
unless he lowered his voice an octave and played
Shakespeare without a single affectation, I'm not sure
audiences would register that he's departing radically
from his usual comic style. (The poor notices John Trav
olta received in Blow Out are another example of this
kind of confusion.) But Martin is different in this movie,
and he's different from scene to scene, too. At first, his
eyes, his aggressive-passive face and his slightly lagging
line readings in that wide, friendlyfnidwestern twang are
amiable and disarming; then he slicks his hair back, his
eyes grow still bigger and his itchy discontent turns to a
fierce self-confidence that j» more than a little fright
ening. Martin manages to make Arthur both sympathetic
and slightly repellent,
All the acting fe extraordinary — down to Eliska
Krupka's brief appearance as a blind girl who suggests
the doomed beauty of Mae Murray in Birth of a Nation
and Intolerance — but Bernadette Peters' work in this
picture is so monumental that it eclipses anything any
other actress has done on screen all year. Peters can con
vey two or three conflicting emotions in one look; she

shows us Eileen, who starts as a schoolteacher and ends
up a whore, simultaneously fighting against destruction
and hurtling toward it. Sincere and vulnerable, she also
has a sharp edge deep inside her — a razor's edge that
her emotions are precariously balanced on.
No musical has ever captured a period as sensuously as
MPennies from Heaven, which was conceived by Ross, Bob
Mackie, Ken Adam (the visual consultant), Fred Tuch
and Bernie Cutler (the art directors) and Gordon Willis
(the cinematographer) in the style of Edward Hopper's
paintings — and occasionally Walker Evans' photo
graphs. For many of us, Hopper and Evans express the
spirit of the Depression — Hopper's rich, nocturnal
scenes in particular find the poetry in the alienation of
emaciated figures in underlit cafes and gas stations, liv
ing out hopeless lives. To tap the resources of his paint
ings in this movie was a stroke of genius. Several are ac
tually reproduced — notably "Nighthawks" and "Movie
Palace" — and the reproductions are meticulous
without being merely academic. The photography re
minded me of the experiments John Alofiso made in
Farewell, My Lovely andlLaszlo Kovacs in Paradise Alley,
but it's fuller, less gimmicky; you believe that people
could live in this ambiance. I have no idea how Willis got
the look of the film so close to Hopper —" the very air
seems neon lit — but it's the most remarkable work yet
from one of our most gifted photographers.
Herbert Ross's collaborators (including the editor,
Richard Marks) have harmonized in this film. The musi

of these five performers has a purity and untrammelled
range that recall the best acting in D.W. Griffith's movies.
It is gloriously appropriate — and perhaps not accidental
— that the depiction of the moment before each song,
when these people are trembling with feeling that
freezes in their eyes, should most closely approach the
portrayal of feeling in silent movies. These moments are
so terrifyingly vivid that the musical numbers are as
much a release for us as they are for the characters.
I've always liked Steve Martin, but I never imagined he
had the depth to play a dramatic role like this one. In fact,
the generally unfavorable response his performance has
drawn from many people 112 know, and from many other
critics, may derive from the expectations we have of him;
unless he lowered his voice an octave and played
Shakespeare without a single affectation, I'm not sure
audiences would register that he's departing radically
from his usual comic style. (The poor notices John Trav
olta received in Blow Out are another example of this
kind of confusion.) But Martin is different in this movie,
and he's different from scene to scene, too. At first, his
eyes, his aggressive-passive face and his slightly lagging
line readings in that wide, friendlyfnidwestern twang are
amiable and disarming; then he slicks his hair back, his
eyes grow still bigger and his itchy discontent turns to a
fierce self-confidence that j» more than a little fright
ening. Martin manages to make Arthur both sympathetic
and slightly repellent,
All the acting fe extraordinary — down to Eliska
Krupka's brief appearance as a blind girl who suggests
the doomed beauty of Mae Murray in Birth of a Nation
and Intolerance — but Bernadette Peters' work in this
picture is so monumental that it eclipses anything any
other actress has done on screen all year. Peters can con
vey two or three conflicting emotions in one look; she

shows us Eileen, who starts as a schoolteacher and ends
up a whore, simultaneously fighting against destruction
and hurtling toward it. Sincere and vulnerable, she also
has a sharp edge deep inside her — a razor's edge that
her emotions are precariously balanced on.
No musical has ever captured a period as sensuously as
MPennies from Heaven, which was conceived by Ross, Bob
Mackie, Ken Adam (the visual consultant), Fred Tuch
and Bernie Cutler (the art directors) and Gordon Willis
(the cinematographer) in the style of Edward Hopper's
paintings — and occasionally Walker Evans' photo
graphs. For many of us, Hopper and Evans express the
spirit of the Depression — Hopper's rich, nocturnal
scenes in particular find the poetry in the alienation of
emaciated figures in underlit cafes and gas stations, liv
ing out hopeless lives. To tap the resources of his paint
ings in this movie was a stroke of genius. Several are ac
tually reproduced — notably "Nighthawks" and "Movie
Palace" — and the reproductions are meticulous
without being merely academic. The photography re
minded me of the experiments John Alofiso made in
Farewell, My Lovely andlLaszlo Kovacs in Paradise Alley,
but it's fuller, less gimmicky; you believe that people
could live in this ambiance. I have no idea how Willis got
the look of the film so close to Hopper —" the very air
seems neon lit — but it's the most remarkable work yet
from one of our most gifted photographers.
Herbert Ross's collaborators (including the editor,
Richard Marks) have harmonized in this film. The musi
cal numbers are so beautifully worked out that they are
like the harvest of years and years of developing craft. Ex
cept for Steve Martin (who dances wonderfully) and
Eliska Krupka, the cast is made up entirely of performers
who rose from the ranks of Broadway and off-Broadway
hoofers — it's an assembly of kindred spirits.
This collection of talent enables Ross to be as
audacious as he is and take his conception as far as it can
go. I've never seen a musical as imaginative or a com
mercial American film as offbeat as this one that is so
brilliantly sustained. (New York, New York isn't this dar
ing, and as amazing as most of it is, it keeps falling apart.)
Ross never repeats himself in the numbers; you may
think you've seen the ace up his sleeve in the art deco
bank number, but he's just warming up. White-suited
children tap dance on white pianos in one number — it's
the "Words Are in My Heart" extravaganza from Cold
Diggers of 1935 but with a set full of Shirley Temples and
Bobby Breens. A trio, with Martin, Tommy Rail and Rob
ert Fitch dressed as music hall buskers mouthing the
Boswell Sisters' "It's the Girl" — a celebration of Arthur's
new love affair — ends in a cynical juxtaposition of ro
mance and lust. Bernadette Peters' "I Want to Be Bad" is
like a compendium of all of Busby Berkeley's most snig
gering ensembles — like "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" — and
Christopher Walken, who shows up in a pin stripe suit
and purple tie as a pimp, does the most unsettling strip
tease you've ever seen. Ross doesn't only contrast the re
ality of the dramatic scenes with the fantasy of the songs;
the most ambitious numbers contain that tension within
them. Joan's ambivalence toward her husband is com
municated in "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie," and in "Pennies
from Heaven," Vernel Bagneris' drawn face and
strained, bird-like movements — as well as the huge
blow-up of a starving tramp behind him — belie the

cheeriness of the lyric and the promise provided by the
coins that rain on him as he dances. (There is no doubt
that this dance is one of the high points in the history of
musicals.) And in one scene, Arthur and Eileen watch
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers perform "Let's Face the
Music and Dance" from the 1936 Follow the Fleet — one
of their most dramatic pas de deux — and, silhouetted
dwarf versions of the huge projected images, they im
itate the dance and finally replace it on screen with their
own, darker vision of the number.
Pennies from Heaven is the first original musical to be
filmed at MGM in more than 25 years. It is fitting that
Herbert Ross should have made this movie on the stages
of the studio where so much first-rate work was done in
this medium in the forties and fifties. If Ross owes a debt
to those earlier musicals, and the RKO and Warners mu
sicals of the thirties, he has repaid it by giving them layers
of meaning they couldn't have had before. You may nev
er watch those old movies in the same way again after
seeing Pennies from Heaven, because your vision will
have been altered, deepened. That's what art does.

I never imagined he had the depth
to play a dramatic role like this
one. . . Bernadette Peters can
convey two or three conflicting
emotions in one look.
Pennies from Heaven is a great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and astonishing ever made. The
director, Herbert Ross, staged the musical numbers in
Funny Girl, which were tasteful and polished, and the
ballet sequences in his film The Turning Point were so
elegantly shot that they nearly saved the movie, but
nothing in his career prepares one for the inventiveness
and command he demonstrates here. His straight films
have been professional hack jobs at best, often sen
timental and overbearing; even his good movies, like
The Owl and the Pussycat and The Seven-Per-Cent Solu
tion, have been trifles. I include this catalogue of his past
projects not to put Ross down, but because in Pennies
from Heaven this second-rater has propelled himself
into the first rank and done something no one has ever
thought of before. Pennies from Heaven is about the
need for illusion, which is a startling theme for a musical
because it is the truth behind the idea of musical comedy
— the reason why musicals exist in the first place. And in
order to illuminate his theme, Ross and his choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, and his costumer, Bob Mackie,
have ravaged the history of movie musicals, spinning off
in alt directions from the pictures that have inspired
them.
Musical comedy Is a trick mirror that transforms grim
reality into optimism. In the 1930s when Pennies from
Heaven is set, the musical films didn't ignore the hard
tunes — penniless show girls steal their neighbor's milk
in Gold Diggers of 1933, Fred Astaire hasn't a sou in
Swing Time, and the hero of Hallelujah, I'm a Bum! pan
handles in Central Park. The major difference between
the world of these pictures and the world outside the
movie palaces was one of tone, no one despaired in a
musical, because a blue sky and romance were always
justaround the corner. If audiences had not been able to
recognize the details of their everyday lives in these mov
ies and seen themselves in the characters, they could not
have been swept away by what they watched. Pennies
from Heaven goes one step further: the characters in it
are so trapped in their own lives — so stunted by poverty
and sexual frustration that they respond to their mi
sery by turning it into musical comedy. It's not at all a
farfetched idea. In the novel Loon Lake, also set in the
Depression, E.L. Doctorow has his young protagonist,
Joe, describe how he handles the rigors of an awful fac
tory job: "I am Fred Astaire in top hat and tails tossing up
the screws into the holes, bouncing the frames on the
floor and catching them in my top hat of tin. I twirl the
headlight kick it on the belt, with a backward flip of my
heel... Soon everyone in the plant has picked up on my
routine — everyone is dancing! The foreman comes
pirouetting along, putting stars next to each name on his
clipboard. And descending from the steel rafter by in
sulated wire to dance backward on the moving parade ol
car bodies, Mr. Bennett himself in white tie and tails
He's singing with a smile, he's flinging money from his
hands like stardust."
This passage might be a blueprint for the first dance
number in Pennies from Heaven. Arthur (Steve Martin)
an unsuccessful pop composer who dreams of openingi
music shop, attempts to obtain a loan from a bank, but ii
refused point blank by the manager (Jay Garner). Sud
denly the two men begin to dance, mouthing the word'

to an old recording by Sam Browne and the Carlyle
Cousins called "(My Baby Said) Yes, Yes!" while silver
wigged chorus girls in silver-studded black leotards with
mink collars anc&eathered caps kick and roll giant coins
that evoke, of course, Busby Berkeley's "We're in the
Money" number from Gold Diggers of 1933. (There's
even a Berkleyesque aerial shot.)
The concept of gritty realistic settings
bursting into song — someone else's song, lip-synched
by the actors — was thought up by the screenwriter,
Dennis Potter, who originally used it on his six-part BBC
series of the same name. (Only once in the film does one
of the performers sing in his own voice; the contrast is
tremendously moving.) I didn't see the television show,
so I don't know how much of the original story he altered
for the film or exactly how the songs (which I understand
were far more modestly staged) were related to the emo
tional state of the characters. In the movie the songs are
all epiphanies. The characters — the hopeless liar and
philanderer Arthur; his wife Joan (Jessica Harper), who is
so repressed that her acquiescence to his desires twists
her terrified love for him into vicious sexual hatred;
Eileen (Bernadette Peters), the spinster schoolteacher
whom Arthur impregnates; the black hobo-mysician
(Vernel Bagneris) whom Arthur treats to dinner; Eileen's
humorless principal (John McMartin); and the others
are suffused with emotion that they cannot express in
any other way, so the songs burst out of them. I've never
seen so much emotional intensfty in a musical; the acting
of these five performers has a purity and untrammelled
range that recall the best acting in D.W. Griffith's movies.

handles in Central Park. The major difference between
the world of these pictures and the world outside the
movie palaces was one of tone, no one despaired in a
musical, because a blue sky and romance were always
justaround the corner. If audiences had not been able to
recognize the details of their everyday lives in these mov
ies and seen themselves in the characters, they could not
have been swept away by what they watched. Pennies
from Heaven goes one step further: the characters in it
are so trapped in their own lives — so stunted by poverty
and sexual frustration that they respond to their mi
sery by turning it into musical comedy. It's not at all a
farfetched idea. In the novel Loon Lake, also set in the
Depression, E.L. Doctorow has his young protagonist,
Joe, describe how he handles the rigors of an awful fac
tory job: "I am Fred Astaire in top hat and tails tossing up
the screws into the holes, bouncing the frames on the
floor and catching them in my top hat of tin. I twirl the
headlight kick it on the belt, with a backward flip of my
heel... Soon everyone in the plant has picked up on my
routine — everyone is dancing! The foreman comes
pirouetting along, putting stars next to each name on his
clipboard. And descending from the steel rafter by in
sulated wire to dance backward on the moving parade ol
car bodies, Mr. Bennett himself in white tie and tails
He's singing with a smile, he's flinging money from his
hands like stardust."
This passage might be a blueprint for the first dance
number in Pennies from Heaven. Arthur (Steve Martin)
an unsuccessful pop composer who dreams of openingi
music shop, attempts to obtain a loan from a bank, but ii
refused point blank by the manager (Jay Garner). Sud
denly the two men begin to dance, mouthing the word'

to an old recording by Sam Browne and the Carlyle
Cousins called "(My Baby Said) Yes, Yes!" while silver
wigged chorus girls in silver-studded black leotards with
mink collars anc&eathered caps kick and roll giant coins
that evoke, of course, Busby Berkeley's "We're in the
Money" number from Gold Diggers of 1933. (There's
even a Berkleyesque aerial shot.)
The concept of gritty realistic settings
bursting into song — someone else's song, lip-synched
by the actors — was thought up by the screenwriter,
Dennis Potter, who originally used it on his six-part BBC
series of the same name. (Only once in the film does one
of the performers sing in his own voice; the contrast is
tremendously moving.) I didn't see the television show,
so I don't know how much of the original story he altered
for the film or exactly how the songs (which I understand
were far more modestly staged) were related to the emo
tional state of the characters. In the movie the songs are
all epiphanies. The characters — the hopeless liar and
philanderer Arthur; his wife Joan (Jessica Harper), who is
so repressed that her acquiescence to his desires twists
her terrified love for him into vicious sexual hatred;
Eileen (Bernadette Peters), the spinster schoolteacher
whom Arthur impregnates; the black hobo-mysician
(Vernel Bagneris) whom Arthur treats to dinner; Eileen's
humorless principal (John McMartin); and the others
are suffused with emotion that they cannot express in
any other way, so the songs burst out of them. I've never
seen so much emotional intensfty in a musical; the acting
of these five performers has a purity and untrammelled
range that recall the best acting in D.W. Griffith's movies.
It is gloriously appropriate — and perhaps not accidental
— that the depiction of the moment before each song,
when these people are trembling with feeling that
freezes in their eyes, should most closely approach the
portrayal of feeling in silent movies. These moments are
so terrifyingly vivid that the musical numbers are as
much a release for us as they are for the characters.
I've always liked Steve Martin, but I never imagined he
had the depth to play a dramatic role like this one. In fact,
the generally unfavorable response his performance has
drawn from many people 112 know, and from many other
critics, may derive from the expectations we have of him;
unless he lowered his voice an octave and played
Shakespeare without a single affectation, I'm not sure
audiences would register that he's departing radically
from his usual comic style. (The poor notices John Trav
olta received in Blow Out are another example of this
kind of confusion.) But Martin is different in this movie,
and he's different from scene to scene, too. At first, his
eyes, his aggressive-passive face and his slightly lagging
line readings in that wide, friendlyfnidwestern twang are
amiable and disarming; then he slicks his hair back, his
eyes grow still bigger and his itchy discontent turns to a
fierce self-confidence that j» more than a little fright
ening. Martin manages to make Arthur both sympathetic
and slightly repellent,
All the acting fe extraordinary — down to Eliska
Krupka's brief appearance as a blind girl who suggests
the doomed beauty of Mae Murray in Birth of a Nation
and Intolerance — but Bernadette Peters' work in this
picture is so monumental that it eclipses anything any
other actress has done on screen all year. Peters can con
vey two or three conflicting emotions in one look; she

shows us Eileen, who starts as a schoolteacher and ends
up a whore, simultaneously fighting against destruction
and hurtling toward it. Sincere and vulnerable, she also
has a sharp edge deep inside her — a razor's edge that
her emotions are precariously balanced on.
No musical has ever captured a period as sensuously as
MPennies from Heaven, which was conceived by Ross, Bob
Mackie, Ken Adam (the visual consultant), Fred Tuch
and Bernie Cutler (the art directors) and Gordon Willis
(the cinematographer) in the style of Edward Hopper's
paintings — and occasionally Walker Evans' photo
graphs. For many of us, Hopper and Evans express the
spirit of the Depression — Hopper's rich, nocturnal
scenes in particular find the poetry in the alienation of
emaciated figures in underlit cafes and gas stations, liv
ing out hopeless lives. To tap the resources of his paint
ings in this movie was a stroke of genius. Several are ac
tually reproduced — notably "Nighthawks" and "Movie
Palace" — and the reproductions are meticulous
without being merely academic. The photography re
minded me of the experiments John Alofiso made in
Farewell, My Lovely andlLaszlo Kovacs in Paradise Alley,
but it's fuller, less gimmicky; you believe that people
could live in this ambiance. I have no idea how Willis got
the look of the film so close to Hopper —" the very air
seems neon lit — but it's the most remarkable work yet
from one of our most gifted photographers.
Herbert Ross's collaborators (including the editor,
Richard Marks) have harmonized in this film. The musi
cal numbers are so beautifully worked out that they are
like the harvest of years and years of developing craft. Ex
cept for Steve Martin (who dances wonderfully) and
Eliska Krupka, the cast is made up entirely of performers
who rose from the ranks of Broadway and off-Broadway
hoofers — it's an assembly of kindred spirits.
This collection of talent enables Ross to be as
audacious as he is and take his conception as far as it can
go. I've never seen a musical as imaginative or a com
mercial American film as offbeat as this one that is so
brilliantly sustained. (New York, New York isn't this dar
ing, and as amazing as most of it is, it keeps falling apart.)
Ross never repeats himself in the numbers; you may
think you've seen the ace up his sleeve in the art deco
bank number, but he's just warming up. White-suited
children tap dance on white pianos in one number — it's
the "Words Are in My Heart" extravaganza from Cold
Diggers of 1935 but with a set full of Shirley Temples and
Bobby Breens. A trio, with Martin, Tommy Rail and Rob
ert Fitch dressed as music hall buskers mouthing the
Boswell Sisters' "It's the Girl" — a celebration of Arthur's
new love affair — ends in a cynical juxtaposition of ro
mance and lust. Bernadette Peters' "I Want to Be Bad" is
like a compendium of all of Busby Berkeley's most snig
gering ensembles — like "Shuffle Off to Buffalo" — and
Christopher Walken, who shows up in a pin stripe suit
and purple tie as a pimp, does the most unsettling strip
tease you've ever seen. Ross doesn't only contrast the re
ality of the dramatic scenes with the fantasy of the songs;
the most ambitious numbers contain that tension within
them. Joan's ambivalence toward her husband is com
municated in "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie," and in "Pennies
from Heaven," Vernel Bagneris' drawn face and
strained, bird-like movements — as well as the huge
blow-up of a starving tramp behind him — belie the

cheeriness of the lyric and the promise provided by the
coins that rain on him as he dances. (There is no doubt
that this dance is one of the high points in the history of
musicals.) And in one scene, Arthur and Eileen watch
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers perform "Let's Face the
Music and Dance" from the 1936 Follow the Fleet — one
of their most dramatic pas de deux — and, silhouetted
dwarf versions of the huge projected images, they im
itate the dance and finally replace it on screen with their
own, darker vision of the number.
Pennies from Heaven is the first original musical to be
filmed at MGM in more than 25 years. It is fitting that
Herbert Ross should have made this movie on the stages
of the studio where so much first-rate work was done in
this medium in the forties and fifties. If Ross owes a debt
to those earlier musicals, and the RKO and Warners mu
sicals of the thirties, he has repaid it by giving them layers
of meaning they couldn't have had before. You may nev
er watch those old movies in the same way again after
seeing Pennies from Heaven, because your vision will
have been altered, deepened. That's what art does.
