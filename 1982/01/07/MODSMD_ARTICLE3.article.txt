# CROW to do study on working women
## 
### Sally Newman 
As women swell the labor force
and the nationwide percentage of
working women climbs, how are
their children affected and what con
flicts of interest does society see in
their departure from traditional
roles? The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) and the Boys Town
Center here will use a $100,000 grant
from the Ford Foundation to find
out.
A 21-month study, entitled "Public
Policy Implementations of Perceived

Conflicts Between Feminists' In
terests and Children's Interests," will
examine the way American culture
casts the women's movement and try
to learn "why people view women's
liberation as something in conflict
with children's interests," according
to Sylvia Yanagisako, assistant pro
fessor of anthropology.
"We hope that this group of ex
perts will help to translate what is
known into perspectives usable by
policy makers and interested pres
sure groups," said Sanford

Dornbusch, deputy director of Boys
Town and professor of sociology.
"We believe that people who have to
make policy decisions are unaware of
the changes which have taken place
in women's employment situations,"
he said.
He added that these decisions are
made "without looking at possible
effects on children, women and the
family itself. Our main orientation
will be toward how we can help pub
lic policy," said Dornbusch, who,
with Assoc. Prof, of Education Myra

Strober and Lenore Weitzman, sen
ior research associate in sociology, is
directing the project.
Individual faculty members' con
tributions will focus on their particu
lar areas of expertise. The scholars in
volved in the project represent eight
departments in addition to CROW
and theHoover Institution. While it
will be approached from a variety of
perspectives, though, the study will
focus on "perceived conflicts be
tween mothers and children and
how they might affect children's and
parents' well-being," said Strober.
A tentative list of topics to be ex
amined includes: how changing im
ages of women's employment have
affected child support, alimony, day
care, single parent families and
custody decisions.
Yanagisako, who has studied
changing family structures among
Japanese-Americans from an an
thropological perspective, said she
plans to find out how American cus
toms affect Japanese strategies on
child-rearing through studies of
"symbolic analyses of meanings
which people attribute to women's
work."
She noted that while it was not un
usual among first-generation
Japanese women to work outside the
home, "the second generation has a
more 'American middle-class view'
of sex roles, and this is a culturally
learned set of attitudes about wom
en's roles and parenting."
She said even when a high per
centage of Japanese-American wom
en works, there is a low rate of "prob
lem" indicators (such as crime, sui
cide, and lower levels of educational
achievement).
This "doesn't fit the general idea
that having women in the work force
is detrimental to children,"
Yanagisako said. She observed that
"children are used a lot as a way to le
gitimize discrimination against wom
en."
Though cross-cultural research
will be performed, "America is the
focus, and we will look at others only
to help understand ourselves," said
Dornbusch. His special interests in
clude the problems single parent
families face, such as raising children
and adolescents.
