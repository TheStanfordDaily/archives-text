# CROW to do study on working women
##

As women swell the labor force
and the nationwide percentage of
working women climbs, how are
their children affected and what con
flicts of interest does society see in
their departure from traditional
roles? The Center for Research on
Women (CROW) and the Boys Town
Center here will use a $100,000 grant

A 21-month study, entitled "Public
Policy Implementations of Perceived

in women's employment situations,"
he said.
He added that these decisions are
made "without looking at possible
effects on children, women and the
family itself. Our main orientation
will be toward how we can help pub
lic policy," said Dornbusch, who,
with Assoc. Prof, of Education Myra

Strober and Lenore Weitzman, sen
ior research associate in sociology, is
directing the project.
Individual faculty members' con
tributions will focus on their particu
lar areas of expertise. The scholars in
volved in the project represent eight
departments in addition to CROW
and theHoover Institution. While it
will be approached from a variety of
perspectives, though, the study will
focus on "perceived conflicts be
