Soviets to aid Poland
Moscow — The Soviet Union announced yesterday that it
would grant Poland major new credits on easy terms to se
cure a continued flow of Soviet energy and raw materials to
the beleaguered military government of Premier Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
The credits, reported to be worth $3.4 billion, appeared to
cover part of Poland's 1981 trade deficit as well as the antici
pated deficit this year. Polish sources here said the figure did
not include Soviet hard currency credits extended to Poland,
apparently designed to help the Poles meet interest
payments due on their huge debt to Western banks.
The new credits are part of a wider agreement that in
cludes a Soviet pledge to supply Poland with food, energy
supplies and raw materials. They demonstrate the lengths to
which Moscow is willing to go to roll back the Polish reform
movement that was stopped by the imposition of martial law
on Dec. 13.
There have been numerous reports in the Polish and Sovi
et press recently about shipments of fuel and food from the
Soviet Union to the Poles, all coming amid signs of a tight
food supply within the Soviet Union itself and reported cut
backs in Soviet energy supplies to other East European coun
tries. The new agreement with Poland appears to extend this
situation through 1982.
In announcing the agreement, the Soviet government
news agency Tass said merely that "taking into account the
difficult situation in Poland's national economy, the Soviet
government agreed to grant (Poland) an easy-term credit to
repay the difference in the values of mutually delivered
goods."
The trade protocol was signed yesterday by Polish Foreign
Trade Minister Tadeusz Nestorowizc and Soviet Foreign
Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev. Details of the protocol
had been discussed during Nestorowicz's visit here last
month.
Tass said the Soviet Union would continue to deliver oil,
natural gas and other raw materials to Poland in 1982. Poland
is expected to deliver machine tools, construction machin
ery, chemical industry equipment and farm machinery to the
Soviet Union. The agency made no mention of Polish coal
deliveries, which have fallen sharply during the past year.
Arms talks to continue
Washington — Despite deteriorating relations with the So
viet Union over its role in Poland, the United States plans to
intensify communications with the Kremlin, possibly
through a summit meeting, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said yesterday.
Without making specific commitments, Haig made clear
this applies to his own scheduled meeting with Soviet For
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko and perhaps a conference
this year between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev.
A direct exchange between the superpower leaders, Haig
said, "is more, rather than less, important in times of crisis."
Haig said also the United States "is not asking for lock-step
treatment" from its allies regarding the punitive economic
measures directed at the Warsaw and Moscow governments.
And the secretary declared the situation in Poland reflects "a
profound failure in the East and not disarray in the West."
He said Reagan has "a great sense of satisfaction" over the
"very positive" outcome of discussions this week with West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Reagan is encouraged, said Haig, over Schmidt's
statements blaming the Soviet Union for influencing events
in Poland.
In response to questions, Haig emphasized that Reagan is
"very sensitive of the requirement to maintain rather than to
terminate" high-level communications with Moscow, espe
cially in a period of crisis.
Haig told a news conference that talks on limiting Europe
based intermediate-range nuclear missiles are in a "special
category of East-West relations" and will resume as sched
uled in Geneva Jan. 12.
Haig also said that his planned meeting with Gromyko on
Jan. 27 to discuss a new round of strategic arms talks would
probably take place because of a need to maintain "lines of
communication" with the Kremlin in a time of crisis.
The secretary of state's remarks confirmed the assertion of
Schmidt after his meeting Tuesday with Reagan that Schmidt
had won assurances from the administration that the arms
control talks, regarded as a political necessity by Schmidt's
government, would not be interrupted becuase of the
martial law crackdown in Poland.

At the same time, Haig appeared to be abandoning the ad
ministration's adherence to a policy of "linkage" in dealing
with the Soviets. For most of the past year, Haig, Reagan and
other officials have said arms control talks would not be ex
empted from the administration's hard-line policy of dealing
with the Soviets in one arena according to their behavior in
another.
Reagan to propose tax increases
Washington — President Ronald Reagan will propose
some tax increases in 1983 and 1984 after all, and probably
will seek to raise more than the $22 billion over three years
that he mentioned last September, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan said yesterday.
The secretary also said that, given the tax increases and ad
ditional non-defense spending cuts the administration will
propose, federal budget deficits in both years will be "much
lower" than $100 billion. Another high administration of
ficial said the estimate for the current fiscal year would also
be less than $100 billion. Earlier estimates suggested the defi
cits would go above $100 billion in all three years.
Regan stressed that the administration will propose no
changes in the 25 percent personal income tax cuts passed
last year. He also said, in an interview on NBC's Today show,
"There will be nothing in 1982 in the way of tax increases."
He emphasized, as did a White House spokesman later, that
the president has yet to make up his mind on 1983 and 1984.
But Regan said that, "As far as '83 and '84, when the econo
my is better, I think there will be increased taxes. We've al
ready discussed $22 billion worth in the proposals we sent up
in September that were not enacted."
Those proposals were spelled out only in general terms;
they mostly were relatively minor examples of what the
White House has since called loophole closing. As to further
increases, "We haven't even shown him yet some of the
things that we're considering in the budget area," Regan
said.
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes agreed
that no decisions have been made on the tax issue. He re
fused to predict what the president would do as he made his
final budget decisions today and tomorrow. "Nobody knows
except the man in the Oval Office," Speakes declared, add
ing that the president "doesn't look with favor on new tax
es."
At his most recent news conference in December, the
president said he had "no plans for increasing taxes in any
way." Minutes after the end of the news conference, how
ever, Speakes said that Reagan did not mean to rule out the
kind of tax proposal he made in September — and since then
various Reagan advisers have come to agree he might have to
propose more.
One set of administration estimates that became public
last month showed budget deficits of more than $150 billion
in both 1983 and 1984 unless more spending cuts were made
and taxes raised. Since then administration economists have
changed their economic assumptions somewhat — princi
pally to show inflation coming down a bit more slowly — in
ways that tended to reduce the deficits.
Now, with the additional assumption that the president
will go along with a variety of higher taxes, such as increased
excise levies on alcohol, beer, wine and possibly gasoline,
Reagan's advisers have been able on paper to hold the deficit
below $100 billion each year. Moreover, one adviser said, it
will be shown declining each year.
ERA controversy grows
Washington — The Justice Department decision to oppose
a speedy Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of
the Equal Rights Amendment ratification process was at
tacked yesterday on both legal and political grounds as the
maneuvering over survival of the controversial amendment
escalated.
In Washington, House Democratic leaders announced
they would attempt to enter the court case on the side of the
National Organization for Women and other ERA sup
porters.
In Idaho, the ERA opponents who brought the suit that
now threatens the amendment's survival announced that
they would join the pro-ERA forces in seeking an expedited
hearing from the Supreme Court.
And at the Justice Department, sources said yet another
option was under consideration: asking the Supreme Court
to summarily wipe out the Dec. 23 federal court ruling that
started the flurry of activity. This could be the quickest means
of nullifying the lower court's action, but it might leave the

major constitutional issues unresolved.
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional law
professor who is representing NOW in the suit, said, "I think
it would be a victory to have the court do anything that re
verses or vacates, but it would not serve the long-term in
terest. The fundamental problem would not go away but
would just be deferred. The country ought to hope for some
thing more definitive."
The controversy stems from a ruling Dec. 23 by U.S. District
Court Judge Marion Callister in Idaho holding Congress'
1978 extension of the ratification deadline unconstitutional
and upholding the authority of states to rescind ratification
of the amendment.
The legislatures of 35 states out of the 38 required have
voted to ratify, but five subsequently attempted to rescind
their ratifications, an action that has never been recognized
by Congress.
Timing of the Supreme Court's review is critical because
the ratification deadline is June 30. In addition, the clock is
running even faster in unratified states whose legislatures
will adjourn sooner — one as early as the end of this month.
Without expedited review, the ERA could die before the Su
preme Court takes up the issue, possibly as late as next Octo
ber.
Casey lobbying questioned
Washington — William Casey, as a private lawyer working
for the Indonesian government, lobbied top officials of the
Treasury Department in 1976 for multimillion-dollar changes
in the U.S. tax law without registering as a foreign agent.
Casey, now Central Intelligence Agency director, has con
tended in past Senate inquiries that he performed limited le
gal services and attended "informational meetings" with In
ternal Revenue Service officials. But government documents
obtained by The Washington Post indicate that Casey was ad
vocating specific changes in tax policy outside established
channels with top political appointees of the Ford adminis
tration, including Treasury Secretary William Simon.
The issue of whether Casey should have registered as a for
eign agent is under Justice Department review following last
fall's Senate Intelligence Committee inquiry, which con
cluded Casey was not unfit to serve as director of the CIA.
Stanley Sporkin, CIA general counsel, has maintained that
Casey was not required to register as a foreign agent.
Syria calls for U.N. action
United Nations — Syria called on the Security Council yes
terday to impose sweeping military ( economicand diplomat
ic sanctions against Israel for its annexation of the Golan
Heights, and warned Washington that a veto of the measure
would pose a threat to U.S. interests in the Middle East.
Syrian Ambassador Dia-Allah Fattal also reserved his gov
ernment's right to use armed force to "deal with this ag
gression" if the council fails to act.
"A mere condemnation will not be sufficient," he said.
"We demand sanctions and only (mandatory) sanctions."
Fattal also accused Washington of "encouraging Israel's
intransigence" by continuing to give it political and military
support and refusing to recognize the Arab case.
The Syrian ambassador launched a debate on the Golan
Heights annexation in which Israeli Ambassador Yehuda
Blum responded that Israel was forced to resolve the status of
the Golan Heights because of Syria's long refusal to nego
tiate a peace agreement.
"This Syrian position has placed the Golan Heights and its
inhabitants in a limbo," said Blum. "Israel could not wait
endlessly for Syria to make peace, and had thus to act to nor
malize the situation regarding the Golan Heights."
The council adopted a resolution in December, after Israel
decided to annex the Golan Heights, calling on Israel to re
scind its legislation, and declaring it "null and void."
Today's weather
Fair today and tomorrow with gradual warming. Highs in
the lows 50s today and in the 50s tomorrow. Cold tonight
with areas of freeze, lows in the 30s to low 40s.
Stocks decline broadly
New York — The stock market suffered its second straight
broad decline yesterday but an attempted late recovery
pared early losses for many issues.
Still, losers led gainers by nearly 5 to 2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where more than 1000 stocks fell and the
NYSE's composite index slipped 0.54 to 69.18.

the Equal Rights Amendment ratification process was at
tacked yesterday on both legal and political grounds as the
maneuvering over survival of the controversial amendment
escalated.
In Washington, House Democratic leaders announced
they would attempt to enter the court case on the side of the
National Organization for Women and other ERA sup
porters.
In Idaho, the ERA opponents who brought the suit that
now threatens the amendment's survival announced that
they would join the pro-ERA forces in seeking an expedited
hearing from the Supreme Court.
And at the Justice Department, sources said yet another
option was under consideration: asking the Supreme Court
to summarily wipe out the Dec. 23 federal court ruling that
started the flurry of activity. This could be the quickest means
of nullifying the lower court's action, but it might leave the

major constitutional issues unresolved.
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional law
professor who is representing NOW in the suit, said, "I think
it would be a victory to have the court do anything that re
verses or vacates, but it would not serve the long-term in
terest. The fundamental problem would not go away but
would just be deferred. The country ought to hope for some
thing more definitive."
The controversy stems from a ruling Dec. 23 by U.S. District
Court Judge Marion Callister in Idaho holding Congress'
1978 extension of the ratification deadline unconstitutional
and upholding the authority of states to rescind ratification
of the amendment.
The legislatures of 35 states out of the 38 required have
voted to ratify, but five subsequently attempted to rescind
their ratifications, an action that has never been recognized
by Congress.
Timing of the Supreme Court's review is critical because
the ratification deadline is June 30. In addition, the clock is
running even faster in unratified states whose legislatures
will adjourn sooner — one as early as the end of this month.
Without expedited review, the ERA could die before the Su
preme Court takes up the issue, possibly as late as next Octo
ber.
Casey lobbying questioned
Washington — William Casey, as a private lawyer working
for the Indonesian government, lobbied top officials of the
Treasury Department in 1976 for multimillion-dollar changes
in the U.S. tax law without registering as a foreign agent.
Casey, now Central Intelligence Agency director, has con
tended in past Senate inquiries that he performed limited le
gal services and attended "informational meetings" with In
ternal Revenue Service officials. But government documents
obtained by The Washington Post indicate that Casey was ad
vocating specific changes in tax policy outside established
channels with top political appointees of the Ford adminis
tration, including Treasury Secretary William Simon.
The issue of whether Casey should have registered as a for
eign agent is under Justice Department review following last
fall's Senate Intelligence Committee inquiry, which con
cluded Casey was not unfit to serve as director of the CIA.
Stanley Sporkin, CIA general counsel, has maintained that
Casey was not required to register as a foreign agent.
Syria calls for U.N. action
United Nations — Syria called on the Security Council yes
terday to impose sweeping military ( economicand diplomat
ic sanctions against Israel for its annexation of the Golan
Heights, and warned Washington that a veto of the measure
would pose a threat to U.S. interests in the Middle East.
Syrian Ambassador Dia-Allah Fattal also reserved his gov
ernment's right to use armed force to "deal with this ag
gression" if the council fails to act.
"A mere condemnation will not be sufficient," he said.
"We demand sanctions and only (mandatory) sanctions."
Fattal also accused Washington of "encouraging Israel's
intransigence" by continuing to give it political and military
support and refusing to recognize the Arab case.
The Syrian ambassador launched a debate on the Golan
Heights annexation in which Israeli Ambassador Yehuda
Blum responded that Israel was forced to resolve the status of
the Golan Heights because of Syria's long refusal to nego
tiate a peace agreement.
"This Syrian position has placed the Golan Heights and its
inhabitants in a limbo," said Blum. "Israel could not wait
endlessly for Syria to make peace, and had thus to act to nor
malize the situation regarding the Golan Heights."
The council adopted a resolution in December, after Israel
decided to annex the Golan Heights, calling on Israel to re
scind its legislation, and declaring it "null and void."

Soviets to aid Poland
Moscow — The Soviet Union announced yesterday that it
would grant Poland major new credits on easy terms to se
cure a continued flow of Soviet energy and raw materials to
the beleaguered military government of Premier Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
The credits, reported to be worth $3.4 billion, appeared to
cover part of Poland's 1981 trade deficit as well as the antici
pated deficit this year. Polish sources here said the figure did
not include Soviet hard currency credits extended to Poland,
apparently designed to help the Poles meet interest
payments due on their huge debt to Western banks.
The new credits are part of a wider agreement that in
cludes a Soviet pledge to supply Poland with food, energy
supplies and raw materials. They demonstrate the lengths to
which Moscow is willing to go to roll back the Polish reform
movement that was stopped by the imposition of martial law
on Dec. 13.
There have been numerous reports in the Polish and Sovi
et press recently about shipments of fuel and food from the
Soviet Union to the Poles, all coming amid signs of a tight
food supply within the Soviet Union itself and reported cut
backs in Soviet energy supplies to other East European coun
tries. The new agreement with Poland appears to extend this
situation through 1982.
In announcing the agreement, the Soviet government
news agency Tass said merely that "taking into account the
difficult situation in Poland's national economy, the Soviet
government agreed to grant (Poland) an easy-term credit to
repay the difference in the values of mutually delivered
goods."
The trade protocol was signed yesterday by Polish Foreign
Trade Minister Tadeusz Nestorowizc and Soviet Foreign
Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev. Details of the protocol
had been discussed during Nestorowicz's visit here last
month.
Tass said the Soviet Union would continue to deliver oil,
natural gas and other raw materials to Poland in 1982. Poland
is expected to deliver machine tools, construction machin
ery, chemical industry equipment and farm machinery to the
Soviet Union. The agency made no mention of Polish coal
deliveries, which have fallen sharply during the past year.
Arms talks to continue
Washington — Despite deteriorating relations with the So
viet Union over its role in Poland, the United States plans to
intensify communications with the Kremlin, possibly
through a summit meeting, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said yesterday.
Without making specific commitments, Haig made clear
this applies to his own scheduled meeting with Soviet For
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko and perhaps a conference
this year between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev.
A direct exchange between the superpower leaders, Haig
said, "is more, rather than less, important in times of crisis."
Haig said also the United States "is not asking for lock-step
treatment" from its allies regarding the punitive economic
measures directed at the Warsaw and Moscow governments.
And the secretary declared the situation in Poland reflects "a
profound failure in the East and not disarray in the West."
He said Reagan has "a great sense of satisfaction" over the
"very positive" outcome of discussions this week with West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Reagan is encouraged, said Haig, over Schmidt's
statements blaming the Soviet Union for influencing events
in Poland.
In response to questions, Haig emphasized that Reagan is
"very sensitive of the requirement to maintain rather than to
terminate" high-level communications with Moscow, espe
cially in a period of crisis.
Haig told a news conference that talks on limiting Europe
based intermediate-range nuclear missiles are in a "special
category of East-West relations" and will resume as sched
uled in Geneva Jan. 12.
Haig also said that his planned meeting with Gromyko on
Jan. 27 to discuss a new round of strategic arms talks would
probably take place because of a need to maintain "lines of
communication" with the Kremlin in a time of crisis.
The secretary of state's remarks confirmed the assertion of
Schmidt after his meeting Tuesday with Reagan that Schmidt
had won assurances from the administration that the arms
control talks, regarded as a political necessity by Schmidt's
government, would not be interrupted becuase of the
martial law crackdown in Poland.

At the same time, Haig appeared to be abandoning the ad
ministration's adherence to a policy of "linkage" in dealing
with the Soviets. For most of the past year, Haig, Reagan and
other officials have said arms control talks would not be ex
empted from the administration's hard-line policy of dealing
with the Soviets in one arena according to their behavior in
another.
Reagan to propose tax increases
Washington — President Ronald Reagan will propose
some tax increases in 1983 and 1984 after all, and probably
will seek to raise more than the $22 billion over three years
that he mentioned last September, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan said yesterday.
The secretary also said that, given the tax increases and ad
ditional non-defense spending cuts the administration will
propose, federal budget deficits in both years will be "much
lower" than $100 billion. Another high administration of
ficial said the estimate for the current fiscal year would also
be less than $100 billion. Earlier estimates suggested the defi
cits would go above $100 billion in all three years.
Regan stressed that the administration will propose no
changes in the 25 percent personal income tax cuts passed
last year. He also said, in an interview on NBC's Today show,
"There will be nothing in 1982 in the way of tax increases."
He emphasized, as did a White House spokesman later, that
the president has yet to make up his mind on 1983 and 1984.
But Regan said that, "As far as '83 and '84, when the econo
my is better, I think there will be increased taxes. We've al
ready discussed $22 billion worth in the proposals we sent up
in September that were not enacted."
Those proposals were spelled out only in general terms;
they mostly were relatively minor examples of what the
White House has since called loophole closing. As to further
increases, "We haven't even shown him yet some of the
things that we're considering in the budget area," Regan
said.
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes agreed
that no decisions have been made on the tax issue. He re
fused to predict what the president would do as he made his
final budget decisions today and tomorrow. "Nobody knows
except the man in the Oval Office," Speakes declared, add
ing that the president "doesn't look with favor on new tax
es."
At his most recent news conference in December, the
president said he had "no plans for increasing taxes in any
way." Minutes after the end of the news conference, how
ever, Speakes said that Reagan did not mean to rule out the
kind of tax proposal he made in September — and since then
various Reagan advisers have come to agree he might have to
propose more.
One set of administration estimates that became public
last month showed budget deficits of more than $150 billion
in both 1983 and 1984 unless more spending cuts were made
and taxes raised. Since then administration economists have
changed their economic assumptions somewhat — princi
pally to show inflation coming down a bit more slowly — in
ways that tended to reduce the deficits.
Now, with the additional assumption that the president
will go along with a variety of higher taxes, such as increased
excise levies on alcohol, beer, wine and possibly gasoline,
Reagan's advisers have been able on paper to hold the deficit
below $100 billion each year. Moreover, one adviser said, it
will be shown declining each year.

Haig said also the United States "is not asking for lock-step
treatment" from its allies regarding the punitive economic
measures directed at the Warsaw and Moscow governments.
And the secretary declared the situation in Poland reflects "a
profound failure in the East and not disarray in the West."
He said Reagan has "a great sense of satisfaction" over the
"very positive" outcome of discussions this week with West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Reagan is encouraged, said Haig, over Schmidt's
statements blaming the Soviet Union for influencing events
in Poland.
In response to questions, Haig emphasized that Reagan is
"very sensitive of the requirement to maintain rather than to
terminate" high-level communications with Moscow, espe
cially in a period of crisis.
Haig told a news conference that talks on limiting Europe
based intermediate-range nuclear missiles are in a "special
category of East-West relations" and will resume as sched
uled in Geneva Jan. 12.
Haig also said that his planned meeting with Gromyko on
Jan. 27 to discuss a new round of strategic arms talks would
probably take place because of a need to maintain "lines of
communication" with the Kremlin in a time of crisis.
The secretary of state's remarks confirmed the assertion of
Schmidt after his meeting Tuesday with Reagan that Schmidt
had won assurances from the administration that the arms
control talks, regarded as a political necessity by Schmidt's
government, would not be interrupted becuase of the
martial law crackdown in Poland.

At the same time, Haig appeared to be abandoning the ad
ministration's adherence to a policy of "linkage" in dealing
with the Soviets. For most of the past year, Haig, Reagan and
other officials have said arms control talks would not be ex
empted from the administration's hard-line policy of dealing
with the Soviets in one arena according to their behavior in
another.
Reagan to propose tax increases
Washington — President Ronald Reagan will propose
some tax increases in 1983 and 1984 after all, and probably
will seek to raise more than the $22 billion over three years
that he mentioned last September, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan said yesterday.
The secretary also said that, given the tax increases and ad
ditional non-defense spending cuts the administration will
propose, federal budget deficits in both years will be "much
lower" than $100 billion. Another high administration of
ficial said the estimate for the current fiscal year would also
be less than $100 billion. Earlier estimates suggested the defi
cits would go above $100 billion in all three years.
Regan stressed that the administration will propose no
changes in the 25 percent personal income tax cuts passed
last year. He also said, in an interview on NBC's Today show,
"There will be nothing in 1982 in the way of tax increases."
He emphasized, as did a White House spokesman later, that
the president has yet to make up his mind on 1983 and 1984.
But Regan said that, "As far as '83 and '84, when the econo
my is better, I think there will be increased taxes. We've al
ready discussed $22 billion worth in the proposals we sent up
in September that were not enacted."
Those proposals were spelled out only in general terms;
they mostly were relatively minor examples of what the
White House has since called loophole closing. As to further
increases, "We haven't even shown him yet some of the
things that we're considering in the budget area," Regan
said.
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes agreed
that no decisions have been made on the tax issue. He re
fused to predict what the president would do as he made his
final budget decisions today and tomorrow. "Nobody knows
except the man in the Oval Office," Speakes declared, add
ing that the president "doesn't look with favor on new tax
es."
At his most recent news conference in December, the
president said he had "no plans for increasing taxes in any
way." Minutes after the end of the news conference, how
ever, Speakes said that Reagan did not mean to rule out the
kind of tax proposal he made in September — and since then
various Reagan advisers have come to agree he might have to
propose more.
One set of administration estimates that became public
last month showed budget deficits of more than $150 billion
in both 1983 and 1984 unless more spending cuts were made
and taxes raised. Since then administration economists have
changed their economic assumptions somewhat — princi
pally to show inflation coming down a bit more slowly — in
ways that tended to reduce the deficits.
Now, with the additional assumption that the president
will go along with a variety of higher taxes, such as increased
excise levies on alcohol, beer, wine and possibly gasoline,
Reagan's advisers have been able on paper to hold the deficit
below $100 billion each year. Moreover, one adviser said, it
will be shown declining each year.
ERA controversy grows
Washington — The Justice Department decision to oppose
a speedy Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of
the Equal Rights Amendment ratification process was at
tacked yesterday on both legal and political grounds as the
maneuvering over survival of the controversial amendment
escalated.
In Washington, House Democratic leaders announced
they would attempt to enter the court case on the side of the
National Organization for Women and other ERA sup
porters.
In Idaho, the ERA opponents who brought the suit that
now threatens the amendment's survival announced that
they would join the pro-ERA forces in seeking an expedited
hearing from the Supreme Court.
And at the Justice Department, sources said yet another
option was under consideration: asking the Supreme Court
to summarily wipe out the Dec. 23 federal court ruling that
started the flurry of activity. This could be the quickest means
of nullifying the lower court's action, but it might leave the

major constitutional issues unresolved.
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional law
professor who is representing NOW in the suit, said, "I think
it would be a victory to have the court do anything that re
verses or vacates, but it would not serve the long-term in
terest. The fundamental problem would not go away but
would just be deferred. The country ought to hope for some
thing more definitive."
The controversy stems from a ruling Dec. 23 by U.S. District
Court Judge Marion Callister in Idaho holding Congress'
1978 extension of the ratification deadline unconstitutional
and upholding the authority of states to rescind ratification
of the amendment.
The legislatures of 35 states out of the 38 required have
voted to ratify, but five subsequently attempted to rescind
their ratifications, an action that has never been recognized
by Congress.
Timing of the Supreme Court's review is critical because
the ratification deadline is June 30. In addition, the clock is
running even faster in unratified states whose legislatures
will adjourn sooner — one as early as the end of this month.
Without expedited review, the ERA could die before the Su
preme Court takes up the issue, possibly as late as next Octo
ber.
Casey lobbying questioned
Washington — William Casey, as a private lawyer working
for the Indonesian government, lobbied top officials of the
Treasury Department in 1976 for multimillion-dollar changes
in the U.S. tax law without registering as a foreign agent.
Casey, now Central Intelligence Agency director, has con
tended in past Senate inquiries that he performed limited le
gal services and attended "informational meetings" with In
ternal Revenue Service officials. But government documents
obtained by The Washington Post indicate that Casey was ad
vocating specific changes in tax policy outside established
channels with top political appointees of the Ford adminis
tration, including Treasury Secretary William Simon.
The issue of whether Casey should have registered as a for
eign agent is under Justice Department review following last
fall's Senate Intelligence Committee inquiry, which con
cluded Casey was not unfit to serve as director of the CIA.
Stanley Sporkin, CIA general counsel, has maintained that
Casey was not required to register as a foreign agent.
Syria calls for U.N. action
United Nations — Syria called on the Security Council yes
terday to impose sweeping military ( economicand diplomat
ic sanctions against Israel for its annexation of the Golan
Heights, and warned Washington that a veto of the measure
would pose a threat to U.S. interests in the Middle East.
Syrian Ambassador Dia-Allah Fattal also reserved his gov
ernment's right to use armed force to "deal with this ag
gression" if the council fails to act.
"A mere condemnation will not be sufficient," he said.
"We demand sanctions and only (mandatory) sanctions."
Fattal also accused Washington of "encouraging Israel's
intransigence" by continuing to give it political and military
support and refusing to recognize the Arab case.
The Syrian ambassador launched a debate on the Golan
Heights annexation in which Israeli Ambassador Yehuda
Blum responded that Israel was forced to resolve the status of
the Golan Heights because of Syria's long refusal to nego
tiate a peace agreement.
"This Syrian position has placed the Golan Heights and its
inhabitants in a limbo," said Blum. "Israel could not wait
endlessly for Syria to make peace, and had thus to act to nor
malize the situation regarding the Golan Heights."
The council adopted a resolution in December, after Israel
decided to annex the Golan Heights, calling on Israel to re
scind its legislation, and declaring it "null and void."
Today's weather
Fair today and tomorrow with gradual warming. Highs in

Stocks decline broadly
New York — The stock market suffered its second straight
broad decline yesterday but an attempted late recovery
pared early losses for many issues.
Still, losers led gainers by nearly 5 to 2 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where more than 1000 stocks fell and the
NYSE's composite index slipped 0.54 to 69.18.

Soviets to aid Poland
Moscow — The Soviet Union announced yesterday that it
would grant Poland major new credits on easy terms to se
cure a continued flow of Soviet energy and raw materials to
the beleaguered military government of Premier Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
The credits, reported to be worth $3.4 billion, appeared to
cover part of Poland's 1981 trade deficit as well as the antici
pated deficit this year. Polish sources here said the figure did
not include Soviet hard currency credits extended to Poland,
apparently designed to help the Poles meet interest
payments due on their huge debt to Western banks.
The new credits are part of a wider agreement that in
cludes a Soviet pledge to supply Poland with food, energy
supplies and raw materials. They demonstrate the lengths to
which Moscow is willing to go to roll back the Polish reform
movement that was stopped by the imposition of martial law
on Dec. 13.
There have been numerous reports in the Polish and Sovi
et press recently about shipments of fuel and food from the
Soviet Union to the Poles, all coming amid signs of a tight
food supply within the Soviet Union itself and reported cut
backs in Soviet energy supplies to other East European coun
tries. The new agreement with Poland appears to extend this
situation through 1982.
In announcing the agreement, the Soviet government
news agency Tass said merely that "taking into account the
difficult situation in Poland's national economy, the Soviet
government agreed to grant (Poland) an easy-term credit to
repay the difference in the values of mutually delivered
goods."
The trade protocol was signed yesterday by Polish Foreign
Trade Minister Tadeusz Nestorowizc and Soviet Foreign
Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev. Details of the protocol
had been discussed during Nestorowicz's visit here last
month.
Tass said the Soviet Union would continue to deliver oil,
natural gas and other raw materials to Poland in 1982. Poland
is expected to deliver machine tools, construction machin
ery, chemical industry equipment and farm machinery to the
Soviet Union. The agency made no mention of Polish coal
deliveries, which have fallen sharply during the past year.
Arms talks to continue
Washington — Despite deteriorating relations with the So
viet Union over its role in Poland, the United States plans to
intensify communications with the Kremlin, possibly
through a summit meeting, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said yesterday.
Without making specific commitments, Haig made clear
this applies to his own scheduled meeting with Soviet For
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko and perhaps a conference
this year between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev.
A direct exchange between the superpower leaders, Haig
said, "is more, rather than less, important in times of crisis."
Haig said also the United States "is not asking for lock-step
treatment" from its allies regarding the punitive economic
measures directed at the Warsaw and Moscow governments.

profound failure in the East and not disarray in the West."

Syria calls for U.N. action
United Nations — Syria called on the Security Council yes
terday to impose sweeping military ( economicand diplomat
ic sanctions against Israel for its annexation of the Golan
Heights, and warned Washington that a veto of the measure
would pose a threat to U.S. interests in the Middle East.
Syrian Ambassador Dia-Allah Fattal also reserved his gov
ernment's right to use armed force to "deal with this ag
gression" if the council fails to act.
"A mere condemnation will not be sufficient," he said.
"We demand sanctions and only (mandatory) sanctions."
Fattal also accused Washington of "encouraging Israel's
intransigence" by continuing to give it political and military
support and refusing to recognize the Arab case.
The Syrian ambassador launched a debate on the Golan
Heights annexation in which Israeli Ambassador Yehuda
Blum responded that Israel was forced to resolve the status of
the Golan Heights because of Syria's long refusal to nego
tiate a peace agreement.
"This Syrian position has placed the Golan Heights and its
inhabitants in a limbo," said Blum. "Israel could not wait
endlessly for Syria to make peace, and had thus to act to nor
malize the situation regarding the Golan Heights."
The council adopted a resolution in December, after Israel
decided to annex the Golan Heights, calling on Israel to re
scind its legislation, and declaring it "null and void."

Soviets to aid Poland
Moscow — The Soviet Union announced yesterday that it
would grant Poland major new credits on easy terms to se
cure a continued flow of Soviet energy and raw materials to
the beleaguered military government of Premier Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
The credits, reported to be worth $3.4 billion, appeared to
cover part of Poland's 1981 trade deficit as well as the antici
pated deficit this year. Polish sources here said the figure did
not include Soviet hard currency credits extended to Poland,
apparently designed to help the Poles meet interest
payments due on their huge debt to Western banks.
The new credits are part of a wider agreement that in
cludes a Soviet pledge to supply Poland with food, energy
supplies and raw materials. They demonstrate the lengths to
which Moscow is willing to go to roll back the Polish reform
movement that was stopped by the imposition of martial law
on Dec. 13.
There have been numerous reports in the Polish and Sovi
et press recently about shipments of fuel and food from the
Soviet Union to the Poles, all coming amid signs of a tight
food supply within the Soviet Union itself and reported cut
backs in Soviet energy supplies to other East European coun
tries. The new agreement with Poland appears to extend this
situation through 1982.
In announcing the agreement, the Soviet government
news agency Tass said merely that "taking into account the
difficult situation in Poland's national economy, the Soviet
government agreed to grant (Poland) an easy-term credit to
repay the difference in the values of mutually delivered
goods."
The trade protocol was signed yesterday by Polish Foreign
Trade Minister Tadeusz Nestorowizc and Soviet Foreign
Trade Minister Nikolai Patolichev. Details of the protocol
had been discussed during Nestorowicz's visit here last
month.
Tass said the Soviet Union would continue to deliver oil,
natural gas and other raw materials to Poland in 1982. Poland
is expected to deliver machine tools, construction machin
ery, chemical industry equipment and farm machinery to the
Soviet Union. The agency made no mention of Polish coal
deliveries, which have fallen sharply during the past year.
Arms talks to continue
Washington — Despite deteriorating relations with the So
viet Union over its role in Poland, the United States plans to
intensify communications with the Kremlin, possibly
through a summit meeting, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said yesterday.
Without making specific commitments, Haig made clear
this applies to his own scheduled meeting with Soviet For
eign Minister Andrei Gromyko and perhaps a conference
this year between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev.
A direct exchange between the superpower leaders, Haig
said, "is more, rather than less, important in times of crisis."
Haig said also the United States "is not asking for lock-step
treatment" from its allies regarding the punitive economic
measures directed at the Warsaw and Moscow governments.
And the secretary declared the situation in Poland reflects "a
profound failure in the East and not disarray in the West."
He said Reagan has "a great sense of satisfaction" over the
"very positive" outcome of discussions this week with West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Reagan is encouraged, said Haig, over Schmidt's
statements blaming the Soviet Union for influencing events
in Poland.
In response to questions, Haig emphasized that Reagan is
"very sensitive of the requirement to maintain rather than to
terminate" high-level communications with Moscow, espe
cially in a period of crisis.
Haig told a news conference that talks on limiting Europe
based intermediate-range nuclear missiles are in a "special
category of East-West relations" and will resume as sched
uled in Geneva Jan. 12.
Haig also said that his planned meeting with Gromyko on
Jan. 27 to discuss a new round of strategic arms talks would
probably take place because of a need to maintain "lines of
communication" with the Kremlin in a time of crisis.
The secretary of state's remarks confirmed the assertion of
Schmidt after his meeting Tuesday with Reagan that Schmidt
had won assurances from the administration that the arms
control talks, regarded as a political necessity by Schmidt's
government, would not be interrupted becuase of the
martial law crackdown in Poland.

At the same time, Haig appeared to be abandoning the ad
ministration's adherence to a policy of "linkage" in dealing
with the Soviets. For most of the past year, Haig, Reagan and
other officials have said arms control talks would not be ex
empted from the administration's hard-line policy of dealing
with the Soviets in one arena according to their behavior in
another.
Reagan to propose tax increases
Washington — President Ronald Reagan will propose
some tax increases in 1983 and 1984 after all, and probably
will seek to raise more than the $22 billion over three years
that he mentioned last September, Treasury Secretary
Donald Regan said yesterday.
The secretary also said that, given the tax increases and ad
ditional non-defense spending cuts the administration will
propose, federal budget deficits in both years will be "much
lower" than $100 billion. Another high administration of
ficial said the estimate for the current fiscal year would also
be less than $100 billion. Earlier estimates suggested the defi
cits would go above $100 billion in all three years.
Regan stressed that the administration will propose no
changes in the 25 percent personal income tax cuts passed
last year. He also said, in an interview on NBC's Today show,
"There will be nothing in 1982 in the way of tax increases."
He emphasized, as did a White House spokesman later, that
the president has yet to make up his mind on 1983 and 1984.
But Regan said that, "As far as '83 and '84, when the econo
my is better, I think there will be increased taxes. We've al
ready discussed $22 billion worth in the proposals we sent up
in September that were not enacted."
Those proposals were spelled out only in general terms;
they mostly were relatively minor examples of what the
White House has since called loophole closing. As to further
increases, "We haven't even shown him yet some of the
things that we're considering in the budget area," Regan
said.
Deputy White House press secretary Larry Speakes agreed
that no decisions have been made on the tax issue. He re
fused to predict what the president would do as he made his
final budget decisions today and tomorrow. "Nobody knows
except the man in the Oval Office," Speakes declared, add
ing that the president "doesn't look with favor on new tax
es."
At his most recent news conference in December, the
president said he had "no plans for increasing taxes in any
way." Minutes after the end of the news conference, how
ever, Speakes said that Reagan did not mean to rule out the
kind of tax proposal he made in September — and since then
various Reagan advisers have come to agree he might have to
propose more.
One set of administration estimates that became public
last month showed budget deficits of more than $150 billion
in both 1983 and 1984 unless more spending cuts were made
and taxes raised. Since then administration economists have
changed their economic assumptions somewhat — princi
pally to show inflation coming down a bit more slowly — in
ways that tended to reduce the deficits.
Now, with the additional assumption that the president
will go along with a variety of higher taxes, such as increased
excise levies on alcohol, beer, wine and possibly gasoline,
Reagan's advisers have been able on paper to hold the deficit
below $100 billion each year. Moreover, one adviser said, it
will be shown declining each year.
ERA controversy grows
Washington — The Justice Department decision to oppose
a speedy Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of
the Equal Rights Amendment ratification process was at
tacked yesterday on both legal and political grounds as the
maneuvering over survival of the controversial amendment
escalated.
In Washington, House Democratic leaders announced
they would attempt to enter the court case on the side of the
National Organization for Women and other ERA sup
porters.
In Idaho, the ERA opponents who brought the suit that
now threatens the amendment's survival announced that
they would join the pro-ERA forces in seeking an expedited
hearing from the Supreme Court.
And at the Justice Department, sources said yet another
option was under consideration: asking the Supreme Court
to summarily wipe out the Dec. 23 federal court ruling that
started the flurry of activity. This could be the quickest means
of nullifying the lower court's action, but it might leave the

major constitutional issues unresolved.
Laurence Tribe, a Harvard University constitutional law
professor who is representing NOW in the suit, said, "I think
it would be a victory to have the court do anything that re
verses or vacates, but it would not serve the long-term in
terest. The fundamental problem would not go away but
would just be deferred. The country ought to hope for some
thing more definitive."
The controversy stems from a ruling Dec. 23 by U.S. District
Court Judge Marion Callister in Idaho holding Congress'
1978 extension of the ratification deadline unconstitutional
and upholding the authority of states to rescind ratification
of the amendment.
The legislatures of 35 states out of the 38 required have
voted to ratify, but five subsequently attempted to rescind
their ratifications, an action that has never been recognized
by Congress.
Timing of the Supreme Court's review is critical because
the ratification deadline is June 30. In addition, the clock is
running even faster in unratified states whose legislatures
will adjourn sooner — one as early as the end of this month.
Without expedited review, the ERA could die before the Su
preme Court takes up the issue, possibly as late as next Octo
ber.
Casey lobbying questioned
Washington — William Casey, as a private lawyer working
for the Indonesian government, lobbied top officials of the
Treasury Department in 1976 for multimillion-dollar changes
in the U.S. tax law without registering as a foreign agent.
Casey, now Central Intelligence Agency director, has con
tended in past Senate inquiries that he performed limited le
gal services and attended "informational meetings" with In
ternal Revenue Service officials. But government documents
obtained by The Washington Post indicate that Casey was ad
vocating specific changes in tax policy outside established
channels with top political appointees of the Ford adminis
tration, including Treasury Secretary William Simon.
The issue of whether Casey should have registered as a for
eign agent is under Justice Department review following last
fall's Senate Intelligence Committee inquiry, which con
cluded Casey was not unfit to serve as director of the CIA.
Stanley Sporkin, CIA general counsel, has maintained that
Casey was not required to register as a foreign agent.
