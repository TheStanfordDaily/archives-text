Staff lunch
Maestro Sam Howe and his band of
renowneds cordially invite you to the
staff lunch of the season. We're going
to turn the VDT's down low, play a lit
tle soft Mergenthaler music and
dance to the strains of "Bev and the
Typesetters." Photographers are es
pecially invited and guests should be
aware that stunning snap shots —
suitable for pasting onto a press card
— will be taken. Party favors will be
provided and there will be inspira
tional readings from the l-Xmit.
Noon, the Daily office — nowhere
else.
Apologies
The Daily sincerely regrets the un
fortunate choice of wording in yes
terday's story on the campus rape.
That story should have noted that
there were three "actual" rapes on
campus this fall, not three "suc
cessful" rapes, as was written in the
story. In addition, the police account
of the incident which read that she
was "not injured" should have read
"not otherwise injured." We
apologize to both the victim and to
any readers who were dismayed by
these oversights.
