# Devastating storm 'worst in decades'
## 
### Associated Press 
Ben Lomond (AP) — The death
toll rose to 22 yesterday and
rescue workers said it could go
much higher as they dug out from
the devastating northern Califor
nia storm which buried houses in
mud, closed the Golden Gate
Bridge and caused an estimated
$100 million damage.
Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a
state of emergency in Contra Cos
ta, Marin, Sonoma, San Mateo,
Humboldt and Santa Cruz coun
ties. The designation frees state
funds for repair work and allows
the state to request low-interest
loans from the federal govern
ment.
President Ronald Reagan ex
pressed his serious concern
through a White House spokes
man, and he ordered the govern
ment to respond quickly to ap
peals for disaster relief.
A 2000-yard face of a mountain
covered 300 acres of expensive
homes, trapping up to 20 people
in this wooded Santa Cruz County
community about 60 miles south
of San Francisco, according to wit
nesses. One body was found.
Rescue teams, who were stalled
more than two days by fog and
mud, expected to find more bod
ies.
Asked if there was any hope for
residents caught by the slide, Earl
Robertson, spokesman for the
rescue effort, said: "If there's any
body in there — no."
Also yesterday, at Pacifica 10
miles south of San Francisco, the
body of 9-year-old Billy Velez was
recovered from the same rubble
that eight hours earlier had
yielded the bodies of his sisters,
Michelle, 13, and Melissa, 4. The
children were killed late Monday
as a mudslide forced a house on
top of the Velez home.
The massive slide at Ben
Lomond occurred about 2 a.m.
Monday, turning the Love Creek
area of this normally beautiful
Redwood-studded valley into a
quagmire barely resembling what
existed before the storm, which
began Sunday and continued re
lentlessly until Tuesday.
Emergency medical technician
Rodger Lee, who witnessed the
massive landslide, said many of
the homes cost $300,000.
"The whole mountain moved
and came down on the 300 acres,"
he said. "I've never seen anything
like it before. These were beau
tiful homes, many with terraces,
fine lawns.

"The place looks like Mount St.
Helens — fallen trees all over the
place and a tremendous pile of
mud," he said.
Officials were awaiting the ar
rival of heavy equipment before
launching the main rescue effort,
Harriman said. In the meantime,
two 10-man crews did what they
could with chain saws and shovels.
The only access to the valley
yesterday was by foot. Newsmen
attempting to hike in were threat
ened with arrest.
About a mile north of Ben
Lomond, a slide closed Highway 9,
the main route into the area. A
third slide on the edge of town ru
ined two homes, and residents
yesterday carried buckets of mud
from the dwellings as they at
tempted to salvage some
possessions.
The National Guard trucked in
water after existing supplies in
Ben Lomond were contaminated
in the storm. The city of Santa
Cruz was running low on water
and officials urged residents to
limit use to health and sanitation
purposes.
Elsewhere in the hard hit coun
ty, 70,000 homes and businesses
were still without power after 36
hours, and Pacific Gas & Electric
spokesman Tony Ledwell said
power would remain out for at
least another 12 hours. Roger Orr,
of Pacific Telephone, said 9000
phones were out in the county
and another 11,000 phones were
out elsewhere in Northern Cali
fornia.
North of San Francisco in Marin
County, where 80 homes were
leveled by mudslides and another
150 were damaged, there were
new problems yesterday.
With the Golden Gate Bridge
closed, tens of thousands of com
muters to San Francisco managed
the best they could. Most suffered
through a massive traffic jam on
the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge,
a large span across the bay north
of the Golden Gate.
Others turned to private boats
and ferries.
"Basically, it was fill them and
float them," said Bob Dean of the
Red and White Fleet, which can
celled its sightseeing tours of the
bay to haul an estimated 10,000
people from Marin County to San
Francisco.
Officials hoped to have four of
eight lanes on the highway just
north of the bridge opened by
yesterday evening.

and ferries.
"Basically, it was fill them and
float them," said Bob Dean of the
Red and White Fleet, which can
celled its sightseeing tours of the
bay to haul an estimated 10,000
people from Marin County to San
Francisco.
Officials hoped to have four of
eight lanes on the highway just
north of the bridge opened by
yesterday evening.
Ben Lomond (AP) — The death
toll rose to 22 yesterday and
rescue workers said it could go
much higher as they dug out from
the devastating northern Califor
nia storm which buried houses in
mud, closed the Golden Gate
Bridge and caused an estimated
$100 million damage.
Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a
state of emergency in Contra Cos
ta, Marin, Sonoma, San Mateo,
Humboldt and Santa Cruz coun
ties. The designation frees state
funds for repair work and allows
the state to request low-interest
loans from the federal govern
ment.
President Ronald Reagan ex
pressed his serious concern
through a White House spokes
man, and he ordered the govern
ment to respond quickly to ap
peals for disaster relief.
A 2000-yard face of a mountain
covered 300 acres of expensive
homes, trapping up to 20 people
in this wooded Santa Cruz County
community about 60 miles south
of San Francisco, according to wit
nesses. One body was found.
Rescue teams, who were stalled
more than two days by fog and
mud, expected to find more bod
ies.
Asked if there was any hope for
residents caught by the slide, Earl
Robertson, spokesman for the
rescue effort, said: "If there's any
body in there — no."
Also yesterday, at Pacifica 10
miles south of San Francisco, the
body of 9-year-old Billy Velez was
recovered from the same rubble
that eight hours earlier had
yielded the bodies of his sisters,
Michelle, 13, and Melissa, 4. The
children were killed late Monday
as a mudslide forced a house on
top of the Velez home.
The massive slide at Ben
Lomond occurred about 2 a.m.
Monday, turning the Love Creek
area of this normally beautiful
Redwood-studded valley into a
quagmire barely resembling what
existed before the storm, which
began Sunday and continued re
lentlessly until Tuesday.
Emergency medical technician
Rodger Lee, who witnessed the
massive landslide, said many of
the homes cost $300,000.
"The whole mountain moved
and came down on the 300 acres,"
he said. "I've never seen anything
like it before. These were beau
tiful homes, many with terraces,
fine lawns.

"The place looks like Mount St.
Helens — fallen trees all over the
place and a tremendous pile of
mud," he said.
Officials were awaiting the ar
rival of heavy equipment before
launching the main rescue effort,
Harriman said. In the meantime,
two 10-man crews did what they
could with chain saws and shovels.
The only access to the valley
yesterday was by foot. Newsmen
attempting to hike in were threat
ened with arrest.
About a mile north of Ben
Lomond, a slide closed Highway 9,
the main route into the area. A
third slide on the edge of town ru
ined two homes, and residents
yesterday carried buckets of mud
from the dwellings as they at
tempted to salvage some
possessions.
The National Guard trucked in
water after existing supplies in
Ben Lomond were contaminated
in the storm. The city of Santa
Cruz was running low on water
and officials urged residents to
limit use to health and sanitation
purposes.
Elsewhere in the hard hit coun
ty, 70,000 homes and businesses
were still without power after 36
hours, and Pacific Gas & Electric
spokesman Tony Ledwell said
power would remain out for at
least another 12 hours. Roger Orr,
of Pacific Telephone, said 9000
phones were out in the county
and another 11,000 phones were
out elsewhere in Northern Cali
fornia.
North of San Francisco in Marin
County, where 80 homes were
leveled by mudslides and another
150 were damaged, there were
new problems yesterday.
With the Golden Gate Bridge
closed, tens of thousands of com
muters to San Francisco managed
the best they could. Most suffered
through a massive traffic jam on
the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge,
a large span across the bay north
of the Golden Gate.
Others turned to private boats
and ferries.
