### Peggy Hernandez 
Santa Clara â€” Maureen Reagan, the presi
dent's daughter and a candidate for the U.S.
Senate, spoke at the University of Santa Clara
Dec. 11, outlining her political platform for
the June 8 primary.
Reagan, one of seven challengers to in
cumbent S.I. Hayakawa in the Republican
primary, advocated increasing U.S. trade in
foreign nations, saying the United States is
"in a serious economic situation" which
could be remedied through increased ex
portationsof U.S. products.
"There are trillions of dollars of business
out there," Reagan told a black tie audience
of 120. "We are the single largest market
place in the world. We export 7 percent of
our goods. If we can export 10 percent, we
can balance our deficit."
Reagan told amusing anecdotes and joked
with the audience to get her message across.
She criticized the public, for instance, which

claims to have little knowledge about in
ternational trade.
"I am mildly amused by people who wear
Pierre Cardin shirts, watch Sony TVs, have a
Fiat in the garage and who tell me they don't
know anything about international trade,"
Reagan said.
She said the United States is capable of
meeting foreign trade demands, but that the
United States is "not aggressively selling"
itself.
"We taught the world everything about
business/' Reagan said. "If we keep our
sense of humor and be a little sneaky we can
accomplish what we want. Not through
competition, but through cooperation."
Reagan is part owner of Sell Overseas
America, a research magazine which
catalogs U. 5. products which are open for
trade and sale. The magazine is distributed
overseas.
She said she believes the United States can

be competitive in foreign trade within the
next 10 years. To accomplish this, Reagan
said three factors must be considered.

. First: Americans must learn a foreign lan
guage to deal with other countries, hence
she supports magnet schools and bilingual

education programs.
Second: U.S. businessmen must be willing
to travel to foreign countries to do business.
Reagan said many foreign businessmen
complain to her about having to come to the
United States to buy.
Third: Foreign countries must allow the
United States to sell products in their coun
tries. "If Japan and Western Europe continue
to sell in this marketplace they're going to
have to let us sell in their marketplace," she
said.
Reagan, who was escorted by Secret Ser
vice men, acknowledged her family name is
a plus in the Senate campaign, but, she said,
"There is a great deal of assumption about it.
We are all a sum total of our heredity and en
vironment. Hopefully, given the opportuni
ty to hear what's said, people will make up
their minds about me."
Reagan presently lags far behind other
Senate candidates Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr.

and Pete McCloskey, as well as San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson and Hayakawa, accord
ing to a recent California poll. Reagan was
undaunted, however, saying "I intend to
win."
Recently, Goldwater said he would not
debate McCloskey over his National Youth
Service act. Reagan said she would not
either.
"I don't agree with the idea," Reagan said.
"I don't believe in conscription in peace
time. We don't need a volunteer army. So, I
don't see any point in debating (Mc-
Closkey)."
Reagan announced Jan. 5 that she will seek
to gain 10,000 registered voters' signatures
on a Senate petition rather than pay a $1213
filing fee. The filing date is Feb. 25.
Reagan said she will submit signatures
rather than a filing fee to show her intention
of conducting a "grass roots" campaign.
