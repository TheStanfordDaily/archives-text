## China seeks to end widescale winter gambling by peasants 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — With winter hard
upon the countryside and
money from last year's bumper
harvest in their pockets, Chi
nese peasants have turned to
their favorite vice — gambling.
In some areas, nearly half of
the rural workforce is playing
poker now, the Communist
Party newspaper People's Daily
reported with alarm yesterday.
The sums are not always
small, with as much as $6000 at
stake on a single hand. Some
gamblers have lost virtually
their entire earnings from last
year, and a few have had to sell
all their family's personal and
household goods to pay their
debts.
Some enterprising peasants
in Zhejiang Province's Fenghua
county on China's east coast set
up a network of 22 gambling
houses, virtually one in each
hamlet, and were drawing 25
and 30 customers a day, accord
ing to the People's Daily.
Not just men
Mahjongg addicts in other

villages have games going on
around the clock, according to
reports in provincial news
papers, and players — mostly
women — are throwing
around almost as much money
as their poker-playing hus
bands.
The life savings of families
are being gambled away, the
People's Daily said, adding that
some gamblers have com
mitted suicide after losing
heavily.
Gambling, which some Chi
nese social commentators have
described as having a following
here that is even greater than
sex, was outlawed by the Com
munists when they came to
power in 1949.
The prohibition is widely ig
nored, however, and the real
obstacle has been the poverty
of both peasants and workers.
The rural resurgence in the last
three years has given the
peasants more money than
most can spend because of a
shortage of consumer goods

and has contributed to an in
crease in games, the news
paper reported.
Communist Party and gov
ernment officials are being
mobilized for a crackdown, but
even some of them are in
volved in gambling. A village
party secretary in central Chi
na's Henan Province was re
cently jailed for a year and his
winnings confiscated after he
was found running the village
poker game.
