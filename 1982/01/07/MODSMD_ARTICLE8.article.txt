Los Angeles â€” Recent Soviet
criticism of Los Angeles' prepa
rations for the 1984 Olympics
met rebuttle Tuesday from
Monique Berlioux, the direc
tor of the International Olym
pic Committee, who declared
that regardless of what the So
viets do or say, the Los Angeles
Games will go on.
Berlioux, speaking by tele
phone from lOC headquarters
in Lausanne, Switzerland, said
that the Soviet criticism of the
Los Angeles preparations and,
in particular, of Peter Ueber
roth, president of the Los An
geles Olympic Organizing
Committee, was "not very
fair." The Soviet observations
were contained in a commen
tary by Tass, the official news
agency, published last week.
Berlioux's remarks marked
the first time that any leading
lOC official had publicly
criticized the Soviets for their
negative attitude toward the

1984 Games.
Berlioux said she thinks it
likely that the Soviet criticism
will go on indefinitely, but said
that by July 28, 1984, six weeks
before the Games, the Soviets
will have to decide if they are
going to send a team.
Berlioux's comments came
in one of the most open dis
cussions by any leading Olym
pic official on the possibility of
a Soviet boycott of the 1984
Games in retaliation for the
American boycott of the Mos
cow Games.
The lOC director said she be
lieves that the timing of the
Tass criticism resulted from the
Reagan administration's de
cision, as a sanction following
the Polish crisis, to extend by
two months a freeze against
payment to Moscow by the Na
tional Broadcasting Co. (NBC)
of the $16 million it still owes
on its aborted contract to tele
vise the Moscow Games.
