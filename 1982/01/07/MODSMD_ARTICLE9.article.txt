# Jaruzelski calls for reforms with stability
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Now that he has
achieved his short-term goal of imposing
martial law, military leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski faces a much more difficult task
as he tries to use dictatorial methods to re
form Poland's bankrupt economic and po
litical systems so that they work on the
basis of popular consent.
Since declaring martial law Dec. 13,
jaruzelski several times has reiterated his
determination to press ahead with reforms
begun in August 1980 following massive
industrial unrest. One of his advisors, Capt.
Wieslaw Gornicki, has insisted that it is im
possible to turn back "the clock of his
tory."
But what Western diplomats and others
see as apparent contradictions in
Jaruzelski's efforts to return Poland to nor
mality seem to indicate that a tragic cycle
in Polish history is about to be repeated.
A Warsaw intellectual put it this way:
"The new rulers are falling into the old
trap. They are attempting to treat this as a
crisis of the regime — of mistakes made by
individual leaders — when in fact it's a
crisis of the entire system."
jaruzelski, who has a personal reputa
tion for honesty, appears sincere when he
says he wants to decentralize the econo

my, end corruption and reform the admin
istration. But he has also committed
himself to preserving the Communist Par
ty's monopoly of political power — and
this is the goal that overrides all others.
The military government has promised
to increase the efficiency of the economy
and introduce limited political reforms.
The dynamics of martial law, however,
have meant that manipulation of the mass
media is once again total, and political re
liability is again being viewed asa more im
portant quality for managers and officials
than competence.
Military commissars have been drafted
into every factory in the country. In some
plants, such as the Lenin Shipyard in
Gdansk, even the workers are being asked
for pledges of loyalty or threatened with
dismissal unless they disown Solidarity.
"The new government badly needs to
get the economy working properly," a
Western diplomat said, but many of the
martial-law regulations appear to be work
ing at cross purposes. "How can you run an
efficient business without telephones?" he
said.
At the same time, there is some evidence
that the authorities are moving against
private businessmen — despite the fact

that revitalization of small trade forms a
key part of the plans for economic reform.
It is similarly difficult to see how a
purged press, such as is now operating in
Poland, can become a guardian of reform.
Only a handful of selected newspapers
were permitted to publish following the
declaration of martial law.
"We used to make fun of the old propa
ganda of success under (former party lead
er Edward) Gierek which colored ev
erything to make the regime look good,"
remarked a Polish journalist. "But what
we've got now is far, far worse."
Twice since World War II — in 1956 and
1970 — Communist Party leaders have
come to power promising to learn from
the mistakes of their predecessors. On
both occasions hopes for change were
dashed.
Now, the new military authorities have
attempted to distinguish between two v
phases of Solidarity's power. The original
strikes in the summer of 1980 are depicted
as "healthy" workers' protests directed
against Gierek's corrupt and incompetent
regime, but then the union is said to have
been seized by "anti-socialist" forces who
wanted to overthrow the communist sys
tem.

says he wants to decentralize the econo

my, end corruption and reform the admin
istration. But he has also committed
himself to preserving the Communist Par
ty's monopoly of political power — and
this is the goal that overrides all others.
The military government has promised
to increase the efficiency of the economy
and introduce limited political reforms.
The dynamics of martial law, however,
have meant that manipulation of the mass
media is once again total, and political re
liability is again being viewed asa more im
portant quality for managers and officials
than competence.
Military commissars have been drafted
into every factory in the country. In some
plants, such as the Lenin Shipyard in
Gdansk, even the workers are being asked
for pledges of loyalty or threatened with
dismissal unless they disown Solidarity.
"The new government badly needs to
get the economy working properly," a
Western diplomat said, but many of the
martial-law regulations appear to be work
ing at cross purposes. "How can you run an
efficient business without telephones?" he
said.
At the same time, there is some evidence
that the authorities are moving against
private businessmen — despite the fact

that revitalization of small trade forms a
key part of the plans for economic reform.
It is similarly difficult to see how a
purged press, such as is now operating in
Poland, can become a guardian of reform.
Only a handful of selected newspapers
were permitted to publish following the
declaration of martial law.
"We used to make fun of the old propa
ganda of success under (former party lead
er Edward) Gierek which colored ev
erything to make the regime look good,"
remarked a Polish journalist. "But what
we've got now is far, far worse."
Twice since World War II — in 1956 and
1970 — Communist Party leaders have
come to power promising to learn from
the mistakes of their predecessors. On
both occasions hopes for change were
dashed.
Now, the new military authorities have
attempted to distinguish between two v
phases of Solidarity's power. The original
strikes in the summer of 1980 are depicted
as "healthy" workers' protests directed
against Gierek's corrupt and incompetent
regime, but then the union is said to have
been seized by "anti-socialist" forces who
wanted to overthrow the communist sys
tem.
