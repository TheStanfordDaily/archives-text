# Kappa Sigs reject ritual, lose charter
## 
### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
The national charter of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity chapter here was re
voked last month because the
chapter refused to reinstate an initia
tion ritual which it said religiously
discriminated against potential
members.
Senior Mike Vaska, chapter treas
urer, said that the national ritual was
essentially Christian and that using it
would exclude some Jews, all atheists
and some agnostics from member
ship in the fraternity because they
could not answer the questions "cor
rectly" without violating their be
liefs.
For the past eight years the
fraternity has been using a modified
form of the ritual that deleted seg
ments that members felt would be of
fensive to people of Jewish or other
non-Christian religious faiths.
The details of the ritual were not
released, as they are part of a tradi
tionally secret ceremony.
According to Vaska, the Kappa
Sigmas received permission to use
the modified version of the ritual
eight years ago by the local repre
sentative for the national fraternity
Daniel Asera, but last year Asera
asked them to reinstitute the national
version of the ritual.
Executive director for the national
fraternity Richard Heubner said that
his office was unaware that the Stan
ford chapter had been using a mod
ified ritual until last year when it
began efforts to have the national rit
ual reinstated.
Heubner refused to comment on
the ritual. However, he did say that
he knew of no other cases where lo
cal chapters refused to perform the
ritual.
Diana Conklin, director of the row,
said that the fraternity's loss of na
tional affiliation will have no effect
on its relations with the University.
"They are getting nothing but sup
port from Stanford. I'm rather proud
of the stand they've taken," she
added.
According to Conklin the Kappa's
action supports the idea that
fraternities here are autonomous.
"I know that from time to time the

local fraternity will get pressure from
the national organization, but they
have always made it clear that they
want to be locally controlled," she
said.
Conklin said that she had never
asked the fraternity to reveal its ritual
so that she would have no way of
knowing whether or not the ritual is
discriminatory. But she added that
she had read all the constitution to
find out whether anything was dis
criminatory in them.
Although several Kappa Sigma
members have expressed concern
that the loss of a national affiliation
may deter some potential members
from rushing, chapter President Jeff
Eklins said he thinks it will have no ef
fect on rush.
"I know myself I didn't think about
national affiliation when I joined,"
said Kappa Sigma member Ted Hop
per. "I just met the guys and liked
them," he added.
Elkins said the fraternity will lose
some privileges as a result of the loss
of national recognition but that the
fraternity will derive a gain in funds
from the break with the national
group because they will no longer
have to pay dues.
Among the lost privileges are the
accounting done by the national or
ganization, the right to stay at Kappa
houses all over the nation and the ac
cess to some scholarships offered by
the national organization, said Elkins.
The decision not to reinstate the
national ritual was approved by a
two-thirds majority of the Kappa
Sigma membership last quarter, but
the discussion of the issue began af
ter the summer conclave when the
Kappa Sigmas were given an ul
timatum to reinstate the ritual.
According to Elkins, the debate
was lenghty but not divisive. "We
were told bluntly by the national or
ganization that we would lose our
charter if we didn't use their ritual,"
he said. "The whole house knew that
when we voted," he added.
"At times it was a divided group
but now everyone is pretty much
agreed that we did the right thing,"
said Hopper.
Hopper said that he was offended
by the traditional Kappa ritual be
cause he does not believe in the
Judeo-Christian God. "It was of
fensive because I would have had to
swear something I didn't believe," he
said.
Vaska said that while most of the
fraternity members held traditional
beliefs and thus did not find the ritual
offensive on an individual basis, they
felt that it might exclude some peo
ple from joining.
"There are few fraternities that
would break with a national over a
moral issue," he said. "We have
taken the morally correct road," he
added.
Although the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) has not been officially
informed of the chapter's loss of na
tional affiliation, Elkins said he be
lieves that the new local status will
have no effect on their relationship
with the IFC.
The Kappa Sigma fraternity at UC-
Berkeley has no trouble with the rit
ual, according to its president Craig
Martin. "Any ritual is pretty subjec
tive as to how far you want to in
terpret it. For me and everyone else I
know its no big deal. Their (Stanford
Kappa Sigmas) membership must
have significantly different attitudes
than we do," he said.
Martin said that he feels the ritual
does not exclude anyone from mem
bership in the fraternity. "It's no
worse than taking a Boy Scout oath
and saying you believe in God," he
added.
According to Elkind, the Kappa
Sigmas will work with other chapters
to see if they can get the ritual
changed and if they are successful
they will be reinstated.
However, an attempt by the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology
chapter to add a sentence into the
constitution at the Kappa Sigma con
clave last summer that stated, "Race
and religion shall not be part of the
qualifications for membership," did
not even receive enough votes in
committee to be considered by the
whole body, according to Vaska.
"Presumably the ritual would have
changed if that amendment had
passed," Vaska said.

"I know myself I didn't think about
national affiliation when I joined,"
said Kappa Sigma member Ted Hop
per. "I just met the guys and liked
them," he added.
Elkins said the fraternity will lose
some privileges as a result of the loss
of national recognition but that the
fraternity will derive a gain in funds
from the break with the national
group because they will no longer
have to pay dues.
Among the lost privileges are the
accounting done by the national or
ganization, the right to stay at Kappa
houses all over the nation and the ac
cess to some scholarships offered by
the national organization, said Elkins.
The decision not to reinstate the
national ritual was approved by a
two-thirds majority of the Kappa
Sigma membership last quarter, but
the discussion of the issue began af
ter the summer conclave when the
Kappa Sigmas were given an ul
timatum to reinstate the ritual.
According to Elkins, the debate
was lenghty but not divisive. "We
were told bluntly by the national or
ganization that we would lose our
charter if we didn't use their ritual,"
he said. "The whole house knew that
when we voted," he added.
"At times it was a divided group
but now everyone is pretty much
agreed that we did the right thing,"
said Hopper.
Hopper said that he was offended
by the traditional Kappa ritual be
cause he does not believe in the
Judeo-Christian God. "It was of
fensive because I would have had to
swear something I didn't believe," he
said.
Vaska said that while most of the
fraternity members held traditional
beliefs and thus did not find the ritual
offensive on an individual basis, they
felt that it might exclude some peo
ple from joining.
"There are few fraternities that
would break with a national over a
moral issue," he said. "We have
taken the morally correct road," he
added.
Although the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) has not been officially
informed of the chapter's loss of na
tional affiliation, Elkins said he be
lieves that the new local status will
have no effect on their relationship
with the IFC.
The Kappa Sigma fraternity at UC-
Berkeley has no trouble with the rit
ual, according to its president Craig
Martin. "Any ritual is pretty subjec
tive as to how far you want to in
terpret it. For me and everyone else I
know its no big deal. Their (Stanford
Kappa Sigmas) membership must
have significantly different attitudes
than we do," he said.
Martin said that he feels the ritual
does not exclude anyone from mem
bership in the fraternity. "It's no
worse than taking a Boy Scout oath
and saying you believe in God," he
added.
According to Elkind, the Kappa
Sigmas will work with other chapters
to see if they can get the ritual
changed and if they are successful
they will be reinstated.
However, an attempt by the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology
chapter to add a sentence into the
constitution at the Kappa Sigma con
clave last summer that stated, "Race
and religion shall not be part of the
qualifications for membership," did
not even receive enough votes in
committee to be considered by the
whole body, according to Vaska.
"Presumably the ritual would have
changed if that amendment had
passed," Vaska said.
The national charter of the Kappa
Sigma fraternity chapter here was re
voked last month because the
chapter refused to reinstate an initia
tion ritual which it said religiously
discriminated against potential
members.
Senior Mike Vaska, chapter treas
urer, said that the national ritual was
essentially Christian and that using it
would exclude some Jews, all atheists
and some agnostics from member
ship in the fraternity because they
could not answer the questions "cor
rectly" without violating their be
liefs.
For the past eight years the
fraternity has been using a modified
form of the ritual that deleted seg
ments that members felt would be of
fensive to people of Jewish or other
non-Christian religious faiths.
The details of the ritual were not
released, as they are part of a tradi
tionally secret ceremony.
According to Vaska, the Kappa
Sigmas received permission to use
the modified version of the ritual
eight years ago by the local repre
sentative for the national fraternity
Daniel Asera, but last year Asera
asked them to reinstitute the national
version of the ritual.
Executive director for the national
fraternity Richard Heubner said that
his office was unaware that the Stan
ford chapter had been using a mod
ified ritual until last year when it
began efforts to have the national rit
ual reinstated.
Heubner refused to comment on
the ritual. However, he did say that
he knew of no other cases where lo
cal chapters refused to perform the
ritual.
Diana Conklin, director of the row,
said that the fraternity's loss of na
tional affiliation will have no effect
on its relations with the University.
"They are getting nothing but sup
port from Stanford. I'm rather proud
of the stand they've taken," she
added.
According to Conklin the Kappa's
action supports the idea that
fraternities here are autonomous.
"I know that from time to time the

local fraternity will get pressure from
the national organization, but they
have always made it clear that they
want to be locally controlled," she
said.
Conklin said that she had never
asked the fraternity to reveal its ritual
so that she would have no way of
knowing whether or not the ritual is
discriminatory. But she added that
she had read all the constitution to
find out whether anything was dis
criminatory in them.
Although several Kappa Sigma
members have expressed concern
that the loss of a national affiliation
may deter some potential members
from rushing, chapter President Jeff
Eklins said he thinks it will have no ef
fect on rush.
"I know myself I didn't think about
national affiliation when I joined,"
said Kappa Sigma member Ted Hop
per. "I just met the guys and liked
