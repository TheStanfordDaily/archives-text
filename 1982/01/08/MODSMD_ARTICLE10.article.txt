# French Socialists to discuss differences with Communists
## 
### 
Paris (AP) — French So
cialist and Communist lead
ers will meet today to dis
cuss their sharply differing
views on the Polish crisis in a
confrontation that marks
the first major ideological
split in their uneasy, eight
month alliance.
It is the second such meet
ing since Socialist French
President Francois Mitter
rand swept into power last
May. Mitterand appointed
four Communists to his 44-
member Cabinet, an act
which brought cries of
alarm from leaders of con
servative political groups
that have ruled France for 23
years.
Mitterrand has con
demned the imposition of
martial law in Poland, but
the French Communists
have followed Moscow's
lead and supported military
rule as the only alternative
available to the Polish gov
ernment.
"We will discuss foreign
policy toward Poland. There
are a number of things I
want to say to (French Com
munist Party Leader)
Georges Marchais and oth
er Communist leaders,"
French Socialist Party chief
Lionel jospin said.
"I also have a lot of things
to say," Marchais com
mented. His party said it has
no intention of changing its
stand on Poland.
Despite that, Socialist
leaders believe they can
somehow bring the Com
munists around to their
point of view.
"Our differences, or at
least some of them, can be
overcome during the meet
ing Friday," predicted So
cialist Party National Elec
tions Secretary jean
Poperen.
Despite the rosy Socialist
predictions, neither party
can say if a joint com
munique will be issued after
the closed-door meeting at
French Communist Party
headquarters. Eight dele
gates from each party will be
at the meeting, which has

been postponed several
times since its original mid-
December date.
The Socialist and Com
munist differences over Po
land surfaced almost im
mediately after martial law
was proclaimed in the East
European country last
month and have been
widening ever since.
In one of the strongest
statements from a European
leader, Mitterrand con
demned the military
crackdown and said the loss
of liberties in Poland must
be vigorously and con

sistently denounced.
The French Communist
Party has never condemned
the military takeover. In
stead, Marchais has said it
"was the best possible solu
tion, or in any case, the least
worst."
Following that line, the
Communist-led CGT labor
union, the largest in France,
has refused to participate in
demonstrations and work
stoppages other French
unions have held in support
of the independent Polish
labor union Solidarity.
