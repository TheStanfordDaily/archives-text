## Stanford Sierra Camp offers'once-in-a-lifetime experience' 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Already thinking about next summer's
job? You might consider working at the
Stanford Sierra Camp, located on Fallen
Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe's South Shore.
Each summer, University students are
hired to be arts and crafts instructors, chil
dren's program leaders, hiking leaders, of
fice assistants, and maintenance persons,
according to Steve Davis, acting director of
Stanford Sierra Camp.
The camp, run completely by University
students and alumni, offers both alums and
faculty week-long vacations. Student em
ployees are responsible for helping and en
tertaining the guests and their children.
This summer, students will work from
Junellto September 4, a total of 12 weeks, at
the camp. New groups of guests arrive each
week, giving the students an opportunity
to meet a wide variety of people.
"It's a people job," said Jeff Swisher, a
senior who has spent two summers at the
camp. "You meet a lot of different kinds of
people, and you establish contacts with
these people. I met one alumnus who
helped me get the house I'm living in now,
and other people have gotten jobs through
alumni who have been guestsat the camp."
One of the most obvious advantages to
spending a summer at Stanford Sierra
Camp is its location in the Sierras, a popular
vacation retreat. The camp has two tennis
courts, facilities for volleyball, basketball,
ping-pong, horseshoes, movies, campfires
and fishing, as well as swimming, sailing
and waterskiing on Fallen Leaf Lake.
Backpacking and hiking in the local

mountains are also popular for both the
staff and the guests.
"You're on the edge of the wilderness,
and that's exciting," said Swisher. "One
time a bunch of the employees rented a
sailboat and went sailing on Lake Tahoe.
We got caught in the middle of a huge
storm with 60 mph winds. It was like some
thing out of Gilligan's Island. We got back
all right, but it was a frightening ex
perience."

"It's almost like going to a little desert is
land for 12 weeks," said Staff Director Andy
Roberts, a senior. Roberts stressed the
uniqueness of working at the camp.
"It's really a once-in-a-lifetime ex
perience. You form really strong rela
tionships with a group of people, and you
get the opportunity to meet a lot of dif
ferent kinds of people."
Roberts also pointed out that working

there "is physically demanding." A typical
employee will often put in a 14-hour work
day.
"It's hard to always have that smile on
your face and to always have to be con
genial," said Roberts. "A lot of employees
also are disappointed because the guests
are only there for a week, and just when
you're getting to know them they leave."
Responses from workers are overwhelm
ingly positive, however, which is indicated
by the high returning-employee rate. Ac-

cording to Roberts, out of the 40 available
positions, 20 will be filled by returning
workers. Roberts himself is a returning em
ployee.
Employees receive wages of $100 plus
around $75 in tips per week plus room and
board. Food is "always excellent," accord
ing to Davis. Students perform a variety of
kitchen duties, besides their primary job,
which ranges from child care to sailing in
struction.
