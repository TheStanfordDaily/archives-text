## Joe Rodota Abolish grand jury mandate 
### 
This is the story of a democratic in
stitution. Like many another institu
tion this one was invented abroad
and imported to America. Also like
many another it lived on in America
in the name of democracy long after
the land of its birth had forsaken it in
the name of efficiency.
These words come from the jacket
of a minor book printed in 1963. The
object of the anonymous assistant
publisher's attention is an obscure
part of American government: the
grand jury. Citing the historical role
of the institution, the author and his
publisher championed the grand
jury as "a bulwark of liberty" and
predicted for the system continued
health and prosperity.
"The people's panel" became part
of American democracy with the
1791 ratification of the Fifth Amend
ment guaranteeing that "No person
shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless
on a presentment or indictment of a
Grand Jury ..." Many federal and
state grand juries have since per
formed admirably. A New York panel
helped break the notoriously corrupt
Tweed Ring in the 1870s. One hun
dred years later, grand juries played
key roles in the Watergate investiga
tions that brought down the Nixon
Administration.
While dramatic, these chapters in
the story of the grand jury are excep
tions rather than the rule. The Ameri
can grand jury remains an
anachronism that is neither efficient
nor particularly democratic. The
question facing the United States
and, in particular, the state of Califor
nia, is whether to opt for abolishment
or reform.
Although the U.S. Supreme Court
has upheld since 1884 the right of
states to abolish grand juries, little
hope exists for exorcizing the grand
jury from the federal judicial system.
The 23-member panels in each feder
al district court can be outlawed only
by repeal of the Fifth Amendment.
While Americans once united against
Prohibition and repealed the 18th
Amendment, chances for an encore
are slim. "Grand juries," explains
Congressional Quarterly, "are not
yet as unpopular as prohibition."

While legally free to do so, Califor
nia has stubbornly refused to abolish
its grand jury system. California is
also one of only two states which ac
tually mandate the appointment of a
grand jury in each of their counties.
These county juries are prime can
didates for outright erasure; San
Francisco's civil grand jury correctly
announced last month that the big
gest problem it could find was itself.
What do California's grand juries
do? According to a Sonoma County
brochure, "the Grand Jury acts to
correct situations that result in im
proper, inefficient, or damaging ac
tions by government against the pub
lic good, and to preventsimilar prob
lems in the future."
The juries themselves confess to
being ineffectual. The San Francisco
panel polled its predecessors and
concluded that grand juries "rarely
provide useful detailed suggestions."
Supporters of the system admit the
need for reform. They suggest
enhancing the legitimacy and power
of the local grand jury. In effect, sym
pathizers hope to elevate both de
mocracy and efficiency.
The method of juror selection is
often a target for change. In coun
tries using the "old" method, grand
jurors are randomly selected from
lists drawn by local judges. Critics
charge that this process enables
judges to "pad" juries with "largely
white and middle-class professionals
who have the time to dabble in civic
affairs."
Public interest lawyers mobilized
against perceived abuse and sued in
1974 to force the San Francisco Supe
rior Court to employ conventional
trial jury selection methods. By min
imizing judicial discretion, reformers
hoped to make grand juries more
representative of the community and
therefore, in a sense, more demo
cratic.
The recent San Francisco report
proves that no revamping of selec
tion methods can save the sagging
system. The switch to randomness
has not significantly increased non
white membership. In addition, ran
dom selection has created insur

mountable problems for the as
sembled grand jury.
To be effective, a grand juror
needs a modicum of investigative
and writing skills. The "effective"
jurors point to their unskilled col
leagues as a stumbling block to over
all jury effectiveness: "It is im
possible to bring these people up to
speed."
"One of the major sources of frus
tration," the Sonoma panel recently
states, "is the need for independent,
non-political, expert advice in gov
ernment law. In our many attempts at
fulfilling that need we have been en
gaged in hour upon hour of fruitless
tail-chasing."
The solution? The Sonoma County
grand jury requested "an independ
ent legal advisor free from the en
tanglements of local politics." These
and similar reforms proposed to
make grand juries more effective by
making them more powerful. What
the local grand jury clearly needs,
however, is abolishment, not reform.
Employing professional advisers
will open up al! juries to charges that
they are "sheep" following their am
bitious counsellor. Giving the jury
more clout will not solve its prob
lems, nor will the community's best
interests be served.
Local government has grown too
complicated for casual lay investiga
tion; granting additional powers
would only lead to juries blundering
up blind alleys with more disasterous
consequences than before.
The vicious cycle of wasteful in
vestigations and ill-informed reports
must be brought to an end. The
absurd California mandate for a
grand jury unquestionably deserves
reversal. No State order should per
petuate the suffering of those coun
ties which experience frustrating dif
ficulties with their grand juries.
Our representatives in Sacramento
must heed the words of the San Fran
cisco Grand Jury: "Let those who
wish to keep the status quo defend its
mediocrity."

correct situations that result in im
proper, inefficient, or damaging ac
tions by government against the pub
lic good, and to preventsimilar prob
lems in the future."
The juries themselves confess to
being ineffectual. The San Francisco
panel polled its predecessors and
concluded that grand juries "rarely
provide useful detailed suggestions."
Supporters of the system admit the
need for reform. They suggest
enhancing the legitimacy and power
of the local grand jury. In effect, sym
pathizers hope to elevate both de
mocracy and efficiency.
The method of juror selection is
often a target for change. In coun
tries using the "old" method, grand
jurors are randomly selected from
lists drawn by local judges. Critics
charge that this process enables
judges to "pad" juries with "largely
white and middle-class professionals
who have the time to dabble in civic
affairs."
Public interest lawyers mobilized
against perceived abuse and sued in
1974 to force the San Francisco Supe
rior Court to employ conventional
trial jury selection methods. By min
imizing judicial discretion, reformers
hoped to make grand juries more
representative of the community and
therefore, in a sense, more demo
cratic.
The recent San Francisco report
proves that no revamping of selec
tion methods can save the sagging
system. The switch to randomness
has not significantly increased non
white membership. In addition, ran
dom selection has created insur

mountable problems for the as
sembled grand jury.
To be effective, a grand juror
needs a modicum of investigative
and writing skills. The "effective"
jurors point to their unskilled col
leagues as a stumbling block to over
all jury effectiveness: "It is im
possible to bring these people up to
speed."
"One of the major sources of frus
tration," the Sonoma panel recently
states, "is the need for independent,
non-political, expert advice in gov
ernment law. In our many attempts at
fulfilling that need we have been en
gaged in hour upon hour of fruitless
tail-chasing."
The solution? The Sonoma County
grand jury requested "an independ
ent legal advisor free from the en
tanglements of local politics." These
and similar reforms proposed to
make grand juries more effective by
making them more powerful. What
the local grand jury clearly needs,
however, is abolishment, not reform.
Employing professional advisers
will open up al! juries to charges that
they are "sheep" following their am
bitious counsellor. Giving the jury
more clout will not solve its prob
lems, nor will the community's best
interests be served.
Local government has grown too
complicated for casual lay investiga
tion; granting additional powers
would only lead to juries blundering
up blind alleys with more disasterous
consequences than before.
The vicious cycle of wasteful in
vestigations and ill-informed reports
must be brought to an end. The
absurd California mandate for a
grand jury unquestionably deserves
reversal. No State order should per
petuate the suffering of those coun
ties which experience frustrating dif
ficulties with their grand juries.
Our representatives in Sacramento
must heed the words of the San Fran
cisco Grand Jury: "Let those who
wish to keep the status quo defend its
mediocrity."

This is the story of a democratic in
stitution. Like many another institu
tion this one was invented abroad
and imported to America. Also like
many another it lived on in America
in the name of democracy long after
the land of its birth had forsaken it in
the name of efficiency.
These words come from the jacket
of a minor book printed in 1963. The
object of the anonymous assistant
publisher's attention is an obscure
part of American government: the
grand jury. Citing the historical role
of the institution, the author and his
publisher championed the grand
jury as "a bulwark of liberty" and
predicted for the system continued
health and prosperity.
"The people's panel" became part
of American democracy with the
1791 ratification of the Fifth Amend
ment guaranteeing that "No person
shall be held to answer for a capital,
or otherwise infamous crime, unless
on a presentment or indictment of a
Grand Jury ..." Many federal and
state grand juries have since per
formed admirably. A New York panel
helped break the notoriously corrupt
Tweed Ring in the 1870s. One hun
dred years later, grand juries played
key roles in the Watergate investiga
tions that brought down the Nixon
Administration.
While dramatic, these chapters in
the story of the grand jury are excep
tions rather than the rule. The Ameri
can grand jury remains an
anachronism that is neither efficient
nor particularly democratic. The
question facing the United States
and, in particular, the state of Califor
nia, is whether to opt for abolishment
or reform.
Although the U.S. Supreme Court
has upheld since 1884 the right of
states to abolish grand juries, little
hope exists for exorcizing the grand
jury from the federal judicial system.
The 23-member panels in each feder
al district court can be outlawed only
by repeal of the Fifth Amendment.
While Americans once united against
Prohibition and repealed the 18th
Amendment, chances for an encore
are slim. "Grand juries," explains
Congressional Quarterly, "are not
yet as unpopular as prohibition."

While legally free to do so, Califor
nia has stubbornly refused to abolish
its grand jury system. California is
also one of only two states which ac
tually mandate the appointment of a
grand jury in each of their counties.
These county juries are prime can
didates for outright erasure; San
Francisco's civil grand jury correctly
announced last month that the big
gest problem it could find was itself.
