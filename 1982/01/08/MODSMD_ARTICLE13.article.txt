## ERA would eliminate sexist laws 
### 
Peter Spivack's mourning of the imminent death of the
Equal Rights Amendment (Daily, Jan. 4) is appreciated as
empty sympathy. His statement that "there is no con
stitutional need" for the ERA is incorrect and a common
fallacy.
The 14th amendment, which he quotes, was one of the
Reconstruction amendments, passed in order to give
black male slaves equality of rights under the law. The
15th amendment gave them the right to vote. If these
amendments had applied to women, i.e., if women were
among the "citizens" defined by these amendments,
then it would not have been necessary to pass the 19th
amendment, 50 years later, in order to give women the
right to vote.
Nowhere else does the 14th amendment prohibit the
states from denying equal protection or equal rights on
the basis of sex.
Spivack is correct in concluding that the ERA will not
eradicate sex discrimination, nor does it claim to. How it
could possibly destroy the family is beyond my com
prehension. What it can do is stop the embodiment in
law of what legislators consider to be proper life roles for

men and women.
Instead of roles mandated by law, we would have free
dom of choice by individuals as to what their roles will
be. The ERA could also make it difficult for judges to
make decisions strictly on the basis of the sexes of per
sons involved in a case. It is not always the case that a
woman is a better parent, nor does a man have the right
to beat or rape a woman because she is or has been his
wife.
The most common argument that I hear against the
ERA is that "times are changing; women are already
treated equally." In the first place, there are many re
gions of the United States where that is simply not true.
In the second place, "things are changing" implies that
they can change back.
The ERA is emphatically not just a symbolic gesture. It
is a necessity if women are ever to be permanently and
securely full citizens of the United States. Those women
who think that they already are equal citizens should re
examine the constitution,
