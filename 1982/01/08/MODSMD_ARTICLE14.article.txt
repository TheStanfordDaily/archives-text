## Washington experience proves disheartening 
### 
Washington â€” Before winter ends, this town will
have been inundated by hard-driving young men
and women who've come looking for work and an
opportunity to save the world.
By July, many will probably find themselves stuf
fing envelopes in office building basements. Nev
ertheless, the chance for them to witness Secretary
of State Alexander Haig exiting from a
Georgetown restaurant can be too much to for
sake.
Numerous friends and acquaintances, of course,
have endured their Washington experiences on
congressional committees, in executive depart
ments, or as assistants to bureaucratic bigwigs
with hardly a flicker of disappointment. Yet most
young staffers never give themselves a chance to
grow old in Washington; they would say that work
ing for the government is an education more in
cynicism than in hope.
So it was for 27-year-old Brett Fromson, who de
scribes his yearlong "education" as a White House
and congressional staff member in his book "Run
ning and Fighting: Working in Washington."
While the Stanford University graduate notched
two better-than-average government jobs on his
resume, his story has some universal lessons about
being young and toiling for the bureacracy.
Like many fresh-faced staff members, Fromson
came here (during the last summer of the Ford ad
ministration) with a headiness and aura of self-im
portance that would slay Ms. America. The au
thor's initially self-congratulatory tone is repre
sentative of many young turks in town.
Yet it doesn't take long for Fromson to size up
the scene. Assigned to a top White House econom
ics unit, the Connecticut native quickly realizes

that government policies consist more of buzz
words than sincerity. Fromson learns among other
things that seemingly obvious questions about U.S.
arms sales rarely come up within the national se
curity hierarchy. In the most powerful office in the
world, politics renders the public interest ir
revelant.
Admittedly, after several months in the ex
ecutive branch, the frustrated Fromson would
have been able to write his book about govern
ment service. When he changes jobs, he learns that
the system works no better elsewhere in town.
Even at the bipartisan Joint Economic Committee
of Congress (JEC), where Fromson immerses
himself in railroad and Social Security issues,
sound ideas don't always survive, pertinent ques
tions aren't always asked, let alone answered by
congressional witnesses.
Fromson eventually resigns from the JEC over its
suppression of his white paper on the Social Secur
ity tax increase, which he believes has grave eco
nomic implications. As a result, despite his pre
viously long-term expectations, Fromson leaves
Washington no longer a neophyte but a dis
illusioned and angry young man.
"When you work for the government, you're
there to serve the public," Fromson told us recent
ly. "The goals are supposed to be totally different
from those of business, where there's a tremen
dous feeling of serving yourselves and of serving
people who can help your career. Yet, it upsets me
to see so much of the same (routine) going on in
government service."
While many young Americans working in Wash
ington and state capitals may see themselves in
Fromson, few of his contemporaries will feel sorry

for him. Such is every generation's tendency with
its more ambitious members. Unfortunately, many
college graduates face either going into the private
sector and accusations of greed, or following in
Fromson's footsteps with a label of cocky idealism.
Jealousies aside, however, we can't ignore how
government service can destroy those of even the
best intentions. Too many bright and energetic
Americans, it seems, plainly give up and return to
the private sector, leaving others who don't mind
politicians and fostering their continuing com
promises.
As Fromson concludes, "You can't keep turning
off young people too long and expect them to be
attracted to public service. Eventually all you're
going to end up with are shills and naked career
ists."
Of course, one need not have worked in Wash
ington to understand that, like lobbyists and
would-be presidents, young idealists will continue
to venture to this bottomland of milk, honey and
highway robbery, and they will continue to be
"educated."l t would be folly to expect this cynical
cycle to change overnight.
While Fromson offers no suggestions for
change, however, his book goes a long way in pro
filing for young and old the limitations of working
in Washington. Unless those bound for "The Com
pany" master Fromson's lesson and understand
the inherent obstacles, many will end up like our
crusader: burned out and turned off to public ser
vice.
Each year, we pay dearly for such a high attrition
rate.
