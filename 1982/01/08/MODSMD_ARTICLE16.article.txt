## Eliminate devastating nukes 
### 
If this society is truly interested in
punishing criminals, it should focus
its attention on those who are prepar
ing us for nuclear war.
A nuclear exchange between the
United States and the Soviet Union
would be no less than a pact for
mutual national suicide. Two films
shown on campus recently ("The Last
Epidemic" and"The War Game")
brought this fact home to an au
dience of several hundred. It is well
worth repeating what is known about
the effects of nuclear weapons.
A 20 - megaton nuclear bomb
(roughly 7500 times as powerful as
the fission bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima) exploded at ground level
would create a fireball about one and
one-half miles in diameter, with tem
peratures of 20-30 million degrees
Farenheit. Buildings and people
within the fireball would be vapor
ized, leaving a large crater.
At six miles from the explosion, the
heat flash would melt glass. Shock
waves, combined with winds in ex
cess of 300 miles per hour, would de
stroy virtually all structures. Nobody
would survive.
Out to a distance of 20 miles from
"ground zero," intense heat and
blast would destroy most buildings
and probably kill or severely injure
50-90 percent of the population. If
San Francisco were the target, people
as far away as San Jose would suffer
blindness or retinal burns should
they glance at the fireball.
Fires started by the explosion
would burn out of control, because
fire-fighting capabilities would have
been destroyed. As at Dresden, Ger
many, after attack by Allied incen
diary bombs, and Hiroshima, a huge
firestorm would ensue, with tem
peratures in excess of 1000 degrees
Farenheit. Those people in shelters
would be asphyxiated as the fire
storm used up all available oxygen.
The shelters would function ad
mirably ... as crematoria.
Highly radioactive particles
(fallout) from a nuclear bomb ex
ploded at ground level would be
spread out in accordance with local
wind patterns. A single explosion
would render thousands of square
miles of territory uninhabitable for
weeks; the unfortunates unable to
escape would die of acute radiation

poisoning within weeks or months.
Some radioactive particles would rise
into the stratosphere and be dis
persed globally.
An all-out nuclear exchange
would destroy much of the ozone
layer in the upper atmosphere, allow
ing greatly increased quantities of ul
traviolet radiation to reach the
Earth's surface. Severe burns and
blindness could result for the un
protected ... including all animals.
The ecosystem would be pushed
towards collapse.
A so-called "counterforce" attack
by the Soviets against only ICBM sites
in the United States would result in
about 10-20 million deaths. After
such an attack, according to physicist
Bernard Feld, editor of the Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists, "a reasonably
large fraction of the United States
east of the Rockies would be covered
with lethal fallout." There is no rea
son to suppose that a nuclear war
would be limited to only military
targets, however. "Both the United
States and the Soviet Union have
thousands of large-yield bombs,
enough to destroy every large-or
moderate-sized population center in
both countries. Aggregate casualties
could be expected to exceed 200 mil
lion.
Civil defense measures against nu
clear bombs would be almost
worthless. Those near the sites of ex
plosions could be protected only by
extremely expensive blast shelters;
fallout shelters would be destroyed
by the severe blast effects of the ex
plosions. Protecting urban popu
lations in this way is estimated to cost
several hundred billion dollars. Mass
evacuation of cities in a crisis is equal
ly untenable; once the populace re
alized that the government actually
intended to wage nuclear war, hys
teria and revolt would probably be
inevitable.
Survivors of a nuclear war would
be faced with severe hardships. Most
cropland would be contaminated by
the radioisotope strontium 90, which
is chemically similar to calcium.
Once in the food chain, the stron
tium 90 would get into the bones of
humans and animals, causing cancer.

Furthermore, insect infestations
would probably be severe, because
many predators would have been
killed. The industrial base of the na
tion would be nearly obliterated, as
well.
Soviet citizens have not been de
luded into believing that nuclear war
is a rational way to settle disputes. So
viet magazines and television have
explained graphically the conse
quences of nuclear war. Dr. E.I.
Chazov, Soviet deputy minister of
health and Leonid Brezhnev's physi
cian, has asked, "How then can any
one today even talk about strategic,
limited nuclear warfare when what is
at stake is the survival of the planet
and the survival of the human race?"
The claim that the Soviet Union is
willing to accept massive casualties in
a nuclear war is ludicrous. For U.S.
politicians such as Vice President
George Bush to push new weapons
systems based upon this claim is pure
deception.
Even more threatening is the way 4
in which former President Jimmy
Carter and President Ronald Reagan
seem to have accepted the possibility..
of a limited nuclear war. The Soviet
leadership has repeatedly stated that
initiation of the use of nuclear weap
ons would certainly lead to a full
scale exchange.
Ironically, the late General
Douglas Mac Arthur, who wanted t0.,,,
use nuclear weapons in the Korean
War, recognized that "The very
triumph of scientific annihilation has
destroyed the possibility of war being
a medium of practical settlement of
international differences ... War
contains the germs of double sui
cide."
Mutual disarmament is the only
way to remove the very real and
growing threat of nuclear war. The
public in this country should demon
strate its resolve that there be no in
creases in the nuclear arsenals, that
consideration of "limited" nuclear
war is insane, and that leaders who
pursue contrary goals will be re
moved from office.
