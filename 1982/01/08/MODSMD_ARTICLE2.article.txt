# Faculty cautioned on rapes
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
University President Donald Kennedy announced to
the faculty senate last night the distribution of an open
letter written by Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington regarding the rape which occurred here Jan. 5.
The letter followed a meeting the morning of Jan. 6,
when Kennedy expressed concern to Herrington over
the rape — the third to occur here since October. Also
three rape attempts have been reported since the begin
ning of this academic year.
The letter, which encouraged members of the Univer
sity community to show increased awareness and cau
tion announced the suspension of parking zone ticket
ing after 3 p.m. The letter also requested staff supervisors
to accomodate their employees.
Enforcement of ticketing in "A" parking zones, which
are located nearest to campus buildings, will be sus
pended after 3 p.m. so that campus employees will be
able to move their cars closer to their place of work.

Ticketing will also be suspended in "C" areas, which are
the farthest from campus buildings, and time zone areas,
which usually have a 40 minute limit.
Kennedy stressed that supervisors will be encouraged
to "cooperate in allowing employees to leave in daylight
hours."
The letter also asked people in the community to use
"common sense," well-traveled routes and the SURE es
cort service, and walk with friends or co-workers. It also
encouraged members of the community to notify police
of any suspicious activities. It described the man be
lieved to be the rapist as a black man in his early 20s, be
tween 5'10"-6', with a muscular build, short hair, and a
thin mustache.
In other action, the senate approved a doctoral pro
gram in education and humanities and accepted the
complete list of this quarter's candidates for bachelor's
and advanced degrees. Both votes were unanimous.
