## 'Old school' boys oust woman sheriff 
### Dallas Times Herald 
Dallas — The only woman sheriff in Tex
as, embroiled in controversy for the year
she was in office, has resigned her post
amid suggestions her East Texas county
could not accept a "lady" as its chief law
enforcement officer.
Citing "personal reasons," Peggy Evans
stepped down this week as the $15,000-a
-year sheriff of rural Trinity County. She as
sumed the office last February after the
death of her husband, veteran Sheriff Lynn
Evans.
"We weren't ready for a lady sheriff, I
guess," said "Bunk" Harrelson, a county
commissioner appointed by his fellow law
makers as her replacement. "Most of the
people here are from the old school."
Added Lee Smith, editor of the
Croveton News, published in the county
seat of Trinity County, "This is a pretty
wide-open county, with saloons from end
to end. Could you imagine a woman run
ning into a bar and stopping a fight? I don't
think the lady was tough enough to handle
it."
Mrs. Evans, 56, could not be reached at
her home in Groveton, 75 miles north of
Houston, or at the nursing home where

she now works as a licensed vocational
nurse. Her son, Mark Evans, said she was
probably out of town visiting relatives.
She told the Houston Chronicle Tuesday
that "I guess being a woman contributed
to the problem."
Evans said his mother had been ill from a
kidney infection and had lost 30 pounds.
"She needed to get away," he said, add
ing that she thought she was not receiving
the full support of other county officials,
including Harrelson.
Harrelson, 54, denied that, saying as a
commissioner he had given her "ev
erything she had asked for."
The son said that his mother took the law
enforcement position, presiding over nine
persons and a budget of $150,000, only be
cause his father had asked her on his
deathbed to do so, in order to avoid intra
office friction from deputies who would
be vying for the office.
The tenure of Mrs. Evans was marked by
problems. Four months after she assumed
the post, she drew criticism by firing four
veteran sheriff's deputies, charging them
with insubordination, and replacing them
with people from outside the county.
Last fall, a Trinity County grand jury
blasted the way that the sheriff's depart

ment conducted investigations. The panel
said it was i nable to issue indictments in
several cases, including murders, because
of shoddy police work. Others noted that
Mrs. Evans had little law enforcement ex
perience.
Had she wanted to retain office, Mrs.
Evans would have faced a Democratic pri
mary battle in May and a November elec
tion for the remaining two years of her
husband's four-year term. Harrelson has
filed for the Democratic primary along
with James Smith — one of the sheriff de
puties Mrs. Evans fired — and Trinity
County Constable Kenneth Moore.
Having a woman sheriff was not the only
thing that distinguished the government
of Trinity County, a heavily wooded area
containing the Davy Crockett National
Forest and a population of about 8000,
from the state's 253 other counties.
Since Nov. 23, County Commissioner
Clifton Elliot has been conducting official
business from his cell in the county jail,
where he is serving a six-month sentence
for driving while intoxicated. Officials said
he has the status of a trustee and is allowed
out to attend commissioner's court meet
ings.
