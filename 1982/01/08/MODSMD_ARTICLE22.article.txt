# Social Security upheaval seen

### 
New York — When the sub
ject is Social Security the dis
cussion almost always is mon
ey, that apparently being the
chief concern of both con
tributor and beneficiary.
But don't for a minute be
lieve there aren't apsects of the
great retirement program that
might be of even greater im
portance, difficult asthat might
be to imagine.
Haeworth Robertson has
that imagination, sharpened
and amplified as chief actuary
of the Social Security Adminis
tration from 1975 to 1978, a pe

riod when you might think his
chief concern would have
been money.
But, said Robertson, "serious
as the apparent financial prob
lems may be, they are probably
not the most important Social
Security-related problemscon
fronting the nation." The larg
er costs, are "more subtle and
intangible," and he argued
they could change not only the
finances but the nation's entire
economic and social environ
ment.
Robertson isn't anti-Social
Security, but he said he be
lieves Americans should un

derstand the subject better
than they do, and they should
prepare themselves for
change, because "change is in
evitable."
As matters stand, he as
serted, the system "can trans
form our historic value system
and way of life before we re
alize what is happening." He
said it in "The Coming Revo
lution in Social Security," pub
lished by Security Press, and in
an article for William Mercer
Inc., the employee benefits
consulting company of which
he is vice president.
He begins with the observa

tion that Social Security is so
complex the average person
will never know what benefits
to expect, and will never know
how much responsibility to as
sume for himself and his family.
"This will lead to the individ
ual's looking blindly to the
government for whatever ben
efits are being dispensed at the
time," he said, adding that
"the inevitable result will be
erosion of initiative, individ
uality, and self-respect, as well
as the loss of any sense of free
dom of choice and control re
garding a vital aspect of our
lives."
