# Lax mortgage law urged
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — A presidential advisory com
mission called for sweeping changes in the struc
ture of the nation's housing finance system to
meet the demands of potential home buyers for
mortgage loans in the 1980s.
The President's Commission on Housing rec
ommended that savings and loan associations
and banks be given broad powers to attract
money for home loans from new sources and to
invest funds in ways that will reinvigorate the ail
ing housing industry.
The panel also recommended changes in tax
incentives to encourage mortgage lending
among a wider range of financial institutions.
And it said outdated laws should be overhauled
to permit private pension funds to invest in
home mortgage instruments.
"The major flaw of the financing system has
been a lack of flexibility that has rendered it frag
ile under pressure," the commission concluded
in a preliminary report.
The preliminary report came as savings and
loan associations, the nation's traditional and
largest home mortgage lenders, are suffering

their worst earnings slump since the Great De
pression of the 19305. Persistently high interest
rates are forcing the associations to pay more to
attract new deposits than they are collecting in
interest on old mortgage loans.
The-aim of the commission's recommenda
tions are to reinvigorate the housing finance sys
tem and thereby give financial institutions a
"real option" to offer traditional long-term, fix
ed-rate home mortgages.
Such mortgages have been the backbone of
the housing industry for the past 50 years. But in
recent years, high interest rates, rapidly rising
home prices and scarce mortgage money have
made them more and more obsolete.
The commission report said the federal gov
ernment should take action to prevent — or at
least discourage — states from restricting en
forcement of so-called "due-on-sale" clauses in
outstanding mortgages.
Under those clauses, homeowners who take
out housing loans must pay off the mortgages
when they sell the property and, thus, cannot
transfer the low-interest notes to new buyers.
