## Dallas keeps on doing it right; 49ers want to do them wrong 
### Washington Post 
During their 16 straight win
ning seasons, other teams have
replaced the Dallas Cowboys
temporarily as the dominant
force in the NFL.
Pittsburgh has won more Su
per Bowls (four to Dallas' two).
Miami had an unprecedented
17-game winning streak in
1972. Oakland moved from a
wild-card entry to Super Bowl
champion last year.
But no team, not even Oak
land, has stayed so good for so
long as the Cowboys since
1966, the season leading up to
Super Bowl I.
In those 16 years, Green Bay
has gone from two straight
championships to a league
also-ran. Minnesota,fourtimes
a Super Bowl runner-up, didn't
make the playoffs this season
and hasn't been in a con
ference championship game
since 1977. Pittsburgh, the
dynasty of the late 19705, fell to
.500 after missing the playoffs
the last two years. The New
York Jets faded out of the

playoff picture soon after their
Super Bowl 111 victory. Balti
more, the Super Bowl V
champ, was the league's sec
ond-worst team this season.
But only once in those same
16 years has the Cowboys' sea
son not included at least one
playoff game. And now they
need only beat the San Francis
co 49ers Sunday in the NFC title
game to advance to their sixth
Super Bowl.
Organizational stability and
Tom Landry often are cited as
the major reasons for Dallas'
consistency. But the major
thinkers behind the success of
Pittsburgh, Oakland, Minne
sota and Miami all are still in
place with the same teams. And
only the Raiders have changed
coaches.
What Dallas has managed to
do better than anyone else is to
combine the draft, key trades
and player durability.
The Cowboys have had some
miserable drafts in those 16
years. Yet, of the 45 players cur

rently on their active roster, 34
are draft choices, including 18
of the 22 starters. Dallas has
shown that, to remain suc
cessful, every pick doesn't have
to be a gem. Instead, it is just as
important to have a constant
flow of new talent, even if it's
just one or two newcomers

each season.
Trades also have contributed
heavily to the Cowboys' draft
success. Dallas was in the 1973
NFC championship game, but
because of a deal with Hous
ton, obtained the No. 1 player
selected in the 1974 draft, Ed
(Too Tall) Jones.

Anaheim, Calit. (AP) â€” San
Francisco tight end Charle
Young says the 49ers have suc
ceeded because Coach Bill
Walsh made them believe in
themselves.
"He has a talent for instilling
belief," said Young, a nine

year National Football League
veteran whose once-ebbing
career has crested again with
the 49ers. "He made us beTieve
we could do the job; we did
and now we're here."
"Here" means the NFC title
game, with the 49ers battling
the Dallas Cowboys in San
Francisco Sunday with a Super
Bowl berth at stake.
Young's up-and-down NFL
career started at Philadelphia,
with the Eagles making the
Southern Cal star their first pick
in the 1973 draft. He had four
good seasons with the club,
then went to the Los Angeles
Rams in the trade that sent
quarterback Ron Jaworski to
the Eagles.
Asked how the 49ers com
pare to the Los Angeles team
that lost 31-19 to Pittsburgh in
the 1980 NFL title game, Young
replied: "I think we're a much
better ballclub. We have more
togetherness, a more positive
attitude. The coaching staff has
made a lot of improvements in
the team, and they've added

some key players to make the
pieces fit in the puzzle.
"There are teams in the NFL
with more talent than we have,
but they don't all play as a team
like we do."
Young grinned when asked
about comments Dajlas de
fensive end Ed Jones reported
ly made about the 49ers.
"They're trying to use psy
chology against us," he said,
"but we can't worry about
what they're saying. We can't
get in a debate with them. I
used to play those psychology
games when I was younger. But
we have a game to play and
we'll be playing on our home
field, so now they will get a
chance to try to back up what
they say."
Young said he figures the
Cowboys will be looking to
avenge a 45-14 humbling at the
hands of the 49ers during the
regular season.
"I'm sure they've been told
they embarrassed the or
ganization when they lost to
us," he said.
