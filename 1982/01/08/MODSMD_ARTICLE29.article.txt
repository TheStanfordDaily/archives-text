# They'll stomp in 'Swampland'

San Francisco (AP) — Sodden
Candlestick Park continued
drying yesterday under crystal
blue skies as the vaunted "Sod
Squad" worked to whip the
field into shape for Sunday's
National Football League clash
between the San Francisco
49ers and the Dallas Cowboys.
The winner earns the NFC ti
tle and a spot in Super Bowl XVI
jan. 24 at Pontiac, Mich.
Candlestick, called
Candleswamp, Candlemuck
and Candlemire by teams
which visited this season, is
generally considered the worst
field in the NFL.

Built on the edge of San
Francisco Bay, the field is dif
ficult to dry — and the park was
inundated with almost 10 in
ches of rain from a wicked
weekend rain storm which
wreaked havoc across
Northern California.
Groundskeeper George
Toma, an expert called in last
November in an effort to make
the field playable, says it "hurts
me to see that field the way it
is."
He blames the problemson a
lack of consistant main
tenance.

Toma's crew has kept the
field covered during recent
rains, but it still draws a chorus
of boos, even from some 49ers.
Linebacker Jack Reynolds,
for instance.
"It's like playing in
swampland," he says.
Toma insists the field has
been getting better.
"There has been some im
provement," he says. "Earlier
in the year, the divots were two
and three feet long. Now
they're only six or eight in
ches."
