## 
### Kathy Olmsted 
Sandra Day O'Connor, a Stanford
alumna and the first woman to serve
on the Supreme Court, will deliver
the commencement address June 15
to the Class of 1982.
O'Connor was the first choice of
the Commencement Panel, an ad
visory group to University President
Donald Kennedy composed of stu
dents, faculty, and staff.
"Sandra O'Connor's name was at
the top of our lists by unanimous
consent," said Marlene Wine, special
assistant to Kennedy.
Lisa Cetlin, a senior class president
who served on the panel, agreed that
O'Connor was the "obvious choice."
Cetlin said that although O'Connor's
Stanford education was a "minor
consideration" in the panel's de
cision, the justice's relationship to
Stanford made her acceptance
"more special."
"We're very honored to have her
and we're very pleased that she ac
cepted," Cetlin said.
O'Connor received her bachelor's
degree in economics from Stanford
in 1950 and her law degree two years

later. The 51-year-old former Arizona
judge began her freshman year at
Stanford at the age of 16and finished
her undergraduate program in just
three years. She lived in Branner Hall
for two years and met her husband,
John O'Connor, when they were
both editors of the Stanford Law Re
view.
Although, initially, anti-abortion
leaders attacked O'Connor's Su
preme Court nomination, she was
confirmed by the Senate 99-0. She is
the second representative of Stan
ford Law School's Class of 1952 on the
Supreme Court. Justice William
Rehnquist graduated from the Law
School with O'Connor.
Last year's commencement ad
dress was delivered by another Stan
ford Law School graduate (Class of
1949), former Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher, the of
ficial who negotiated the release of
the American hostages in Iran. Pre
vious commencement speakers here
have included former United Na
tions Ambassador Andrew Young,
Special Watergate Prosecutor
Archibald Cox, and Chief Justice Earl
Warren.
