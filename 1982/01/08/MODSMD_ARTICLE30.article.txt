## There's a 'Bear'in the air Shriners invade Farm 
### Sally Jenkins 
The playing fields and local beer gardens were
painted with unseemly colors this week; hulking
frames clad in red and blue with stars on their
shoulders, and men in purple tassled hats who
call themselves Shriners.
But all eyes looked for the figure in more
somber attire, who has haunted these hallowed
halls quietly in preparing for his last game of the
season. With his Sherlock Holmes hat and voice
from the bottom of a well, Alabama coach Paul
"Bear" Bryant seems to bring a little legitimacy
to tommorow's East-West Shrine game, a touch
of reverence to this generally garish event. Even
the cold and dry weather of late speaks of real
football.
Bryant heads the East team, assisted by Pit
tsburgh coach Jackie Sherrill on defense, with
Michigan mentor Bo Schembechler handling
the offense. Throw that dangerous combination
against a curious but potentially intriguing
Western staff of Paul Wiggin (head coach, Stan
ford), latest college genius Jack Elway (offense,
San Jose State) and Wayne Howard (defense,
Utah) and the result might be a not so run of the
mill confrontation. The East's usual running at
tack should prove a little more versatile than in
the past, and a dazzling passing performance
from the West seems to be in order.
Bryant and Schembechler will direct quarter
backs Buck Belue of Georgia — who has almost
four years of experience — and Rick Stockstill of
Florida State. But the standout performance
should come from the running back position,
where Joe Morris of Syracuse is slated to appear.

At only five-foot-seven and 182 pounds, Morris
gained 4299 carreer yards, making him the lead
ing rusher in the school's history. To do that he
had to overtake some fellows who waxed rather
fast in their own time: Larry Csonka, Jim Brown,
Ernie Davis and Floyd Little if you want to drop
names.
Splitting time with Morris will be Schem
bechler student Stan Edwards of Michigan and
Sammy Winder of Southern Mississippi, and
Belue has at least one friend in California in
Georgia teammate Ronnie Stewart.
Three Cardinal players join the cast of charac
ters for the West: center John Macauley, de
fensive tackle Doug Rogers, and Andre Tyler at
split-end. Tyler was asked to play in the game
before he injured his ankle, cutting him out of
his last season, and the Shriners decided to hon
or the invitation when they learned that he had
finally recovered.
Wiggin and Elway (who engineered one of the
highest scoring teams in the nation at San Jose
State) will have the best of the West to work with
in quarterbacks Matt Kofler of San Diego State
and Mike Pagel of Arizona State. Pagel is the guy
who napalmed the Cardinal at Stanford Stadium
Oct. 24 when he threw for seven touchdowns
and 446 yards, leading ASU to a 62-36 victory. He
wrapped up his season with 29 touchdowns and
2484 yards.
In between the football is enough pageantry
to overdose even a lover of Rose Bowl Parades.
Close to 6000 people are expected to participate
in the pre-game festivities, and the halftime pro
gram features a Euro-Asia show with 600 per
formers.
