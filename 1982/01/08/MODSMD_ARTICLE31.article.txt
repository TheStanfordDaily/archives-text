# OU Ducks paddle south
## 
### Peter Finch 
It's remarkable that the Stan
ford basketball team has been
blessed with so many con
secutive home games this sea
son. The Cardinal has played 10
games so far and nine of them
took place in Maples Pavilion.
It's also remarkable, in a way,
that the team has not been able
to take better advantage of this
situation. Even with admittedly
sparse hometown crowds
cheering them on so often, the
Cardinal is 5-5 overall and 0-1
in Pac-10 play.
Coach Dick Dißiaso's got to
be wondering about what's
going to happen when he takes
his show on the road.
Fortunately for him, how
ever, he doesn't have to worry
about that for another week.
Somehow, the gods of NCAA
basketball scheduling have giv
en Stanford another break,
bringing Oregon and Oregon
State south for fun on the Farm
this weekend.
The Ducks of the University
of Oregon are the first to pad
dle their way down, meeting

the Cardinal Saturday night at 8
p.m. In contrast to Stanford,
Oregon has been red-hot late
ly, smashing Arizona (97-88)
and Arizona State (82-65) last
weekend, while the Cardinal
dropped its Pac-10 season
opener to Cal (87-78).
The Ducks, coached by Jim
Haney, have won four of their
last five games, setting their ov
erall record at 7-4. Two weeks
ago, the team advanced the Far
West Classic title game, finally
losing to nouveau superpower
Idaho, 81-62. The Ducks ad
vanced to the title game with
wins over Wisconsin (85-82)
and Portland (69-68).
The team's leading scorer
and rebounder is senior John
Greig, who is averaging 15.2
points and 7.3 rebounds per
game. Greig scored 15 points in
the Ducks' win over Arizona
and hit on 10 of 11 field goal at
tempts en route to a career
high 25 points against Arizona
State.
Center John Revelli con
tinues to lead the Cardinal,
scoring an average of 18 points
and grabbing an average of

10.4 rebounds per game. Even
in the losing effort against Cal,
Revelli scored a career high 27
points.
Dißiaso explained the loss to
the Bears this way: "We didn't
do a good job of stopping
them. That's a direct reflection
of (Cal center) Mark
McNamara. We're going to
have difficulty against teams
with big, dominant centers.
The two teams coming in this
weekend have legitimate
Pac-10 centers. Again, we'll be
forced to compensate for this."
The team, according to
Dißiaso, is also still compensat
ing for the loss of three of its
top players, forward Hans
Wichary and guards Terry
Smith and Keith jones. Wichary
is sidelined with a foot stress
fracture, Smith is out with a
back injury and Jones was re
cently declared academically
ineligible.
"It's been a factor," said
Dißiaso. "Losing Jones,
Wichary and Terry Smith has
changed our thinking and our
approach to strategies for the
Pac-10 season."
