# Big weekend for Card tankmen, women
## 
### Nick Ferguson 
This weekend Stanford kicks
off its NCAA men's and wom
en's swimming seasons in de-
Guerre pool with intense ac
tion planned in a number of
major events.
Today, the men take on
some tough imports from the
University of Calgary in Canada
at 11 a.m. and then turn to
domestic competition at 2 p.m.
against the University of Ne
braska Cornhuskers. Saturday
at 1 p.m., the swimmers face a
bigtest against sixth-ranked Ar
izona State University and fin
ish up Sunday with the Stan
ford Relays featuring, among
others, fifth- ranked rival, the
UC-Berkeley Golden Bears.
The ASU meet has taken on
great importance for both
teams ever since the Sun Devils
upset No.l ranked UCLA. That
meet opened up the con
ference, meaning the winner
of tomorrow's meet has a good
chance of taking the Pacific-10
dual-meet crown.
To win, Stanford coach Skip
Kenney will be counting not
only on his proven up
perclassmen, but also on the
untested freshmen. The last

two recruiting years were high
ly successful and it is in crucial
meets like this one that a
freshman's talents are meas
ured.
Kenney felt his rookies were
ready. "They trained very hard
over Christmas and have the
endurance. Now we're looking
for speed."
The two places to look for it
are in the 100-yard backstroke
and the 400-yard freestyle re
lay. In the backstroke, co-cap

tain Wade Flemons will be
shooting for the NCAA record
of 51.1 seconds, and the relay
team hopes to shatter the time
in their event.
If the men's team can be
termed strong, then the wom
en are dominant. They will
have a chance to prove if they
deserve their No.l ranking
against Calgary, the University
of Arizona and fourth-ranked
ASU, today and Saturday and in

the Stanford Relays Sunday.
The women are led by first
year coach George Haines. A
veteran Olympic coach and
former NCAA Coach of the
Year, Haines has taught such
greats as Mark Spitz and Donna
DeVarona. His charges this
year are as impressive as any in
the nation, with returnees
Anne Tweedy, Sherri Hanna,
Krissie Bush and Kelly Asplund.
They will combine with tal
ented newcomers.
