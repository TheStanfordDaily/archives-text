## 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford women's
basketball team boosted it's
record to 10-4 this week by
nabbing third place at the
Montana Lady Grizzly Classic,
but broke a school record tying
eight-game winning streak in

the meantime. The Cardinal
travelled to Missoula, Mont,
with a 9-3 record Tuesday for
it's last pre-season competition
against Drake University,
Washington, and the host
school.
The Card fell to Montana in
the first round, 65-52. Trailing
30-17 at halftime, a Stanford
comeback attempt led by for
ward Meg Metzger couldn't
gather quite enough steam.
Metzger, a 6-foot-1 junior,
posted a team-leading 16
points and 9 rebounds with her
effort.
In the consolation bracket,
upset was the word for the day
as the Cardinal slipped by
Washington in the closing sec
onds 69-67.
The Card trailed again at the
half, but this time, the margin
was only two points. Stanford

fell to a seven point deficit in
the third quarter but once
again Metzger pulled the
squad up, turning in team
leading 21-point, 10-rebound
performance.
With her heroics, Metzger
earned a place on the All-Tour
nament team, the only
Cardinal to do so. Named All-
Tournament Most Valuable
Player at the Wahine Classic
Dec. 27, she earned the title of
Stanford Athlete of the Month
in December.
Following up Metzger in
scoring against Washington
were center Louise Smith and
forward Jeanne Ruark-Hoff
with 14 points each, and senior
Debi Gore with 12. Gore, a 5-7
guard, presently leads the Nor-
Cal conference in assists with a
4.9 average per game.
Hoff's best performance

came against Montana, a 15-
point 9-rebound effort. The 6-0
forward was an ace in the hole
off the bench until the Hawai
ian tournament, when starting
forward Kim Kupferer strained
the ligaments in her right knee
against San Francisco State.
Smith presently leads the
team in overall scoring with a
16.2 average per game, and in
rebounds as well with 9.7. Hoff
is right behind her in spite of
her back-up role for the first
part of the season, with a 14.3
point average, and a 7.2 mark in
rebounds. Metzger is third on
the list with 14.1 points, and 6.6
rebounds per game.
