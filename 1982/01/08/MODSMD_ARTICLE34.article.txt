Diving Into the Wreck
By Adrienne Rich
W.W. Norton & Co.
$3.95, 62 pp.
Those who know of Adri
enne Rich may only know her
as a feminist author/poet;yet
she is much more than this sim
plistic label implies. Diving into
the Wreck is a collection of
poems written in the author's
40s by a sensitive, disillusioned
artist.
She has found that the ac
cepted conventions of modern
living, the traditional roles of

She is a poet tor our times, presenting
our common inner tears and growing
dissatisfaction with blind acceptance
ot tradition. Rich makes us realize in
the most ettective way how ingrained
our sexism is.

both women and men, and the
technological advances of the
times have limited her growth
and stifled her sensitivity. She is
a poet for our times, presenting
our common inner fears and
growing dissatisfaction with
blind acceptance of tradition.
In "A Primary Ground" she
describes . . . Thanksgiving
with its pumpkin teeth/... It
all seems innocent enough,
this sin/ of wedlock: . .. pass
ing the salt/ down a cloth
ironed by a woman/ with
aching legs/ Sensuality
dessicates in words-/. .. in ev
ery room the furniture reflects
you/ larger than life, or dwindl
ing.
In "Translations" Rich
speaks of the poems she has

read in translation from an un
specified language in which
Certain words occur: enemy
even sorrow/ enough to let me
know/ she's a woman of my
time.
In the same poem, she goes
on to enumerate the ex
periences shared by modern
women: cooking, cleaning,
typing, being betrayed by
adulterous husbands, and con
cludes that .; . this way of
grief/ is shared, unnecessary/
and political.
It is not only the vignettes of
contemporary urban life (Rich
is a resident of New York City)

but the subtle, economical and
clever use of words that make
Rich's poetry so gripping, so vi
tally fascinating.
Her imagery often strikes a
nerve and can make one
cringe: your mother dead and
you unborn/ your two hands
grasping your head/ drawing it
down against the blade of life.
Rich does not describe feel
ings; she describes situations
with a subtlety of language that
elicits feeling and a sometimes
intense response. It can be vi
olent and shocking. One pow
erful piece is entitled "Rape."
It tells of a rape victim who
goes to the police and recounts
her rape to a policeman who
seems to enjoy the hysteria in
her voice and who fits the de
scription of the rapist. "From
the Prison House" also deals
with police violence and the
prison system.
Rich's poetry is exciting be
cause of the images she paints
which are sometimes simply
unusual combinations of banal
events. For example, in "After
Twenty Years"; Two women sit
at a table by a window. Light
breaks/ unevenly on both of
them/ Their talk is a striking of
sparks/ which passers-by in the
street observe/ as a glitter in
the glass of that window.
Sometimes Rich likes to
challenge preconceived preju

dices concerning women, not
by lecturing in a militant
manner but rather by surpris
ing the reader. "Incipience"
has a passage that describes a
man's dream. A neurosurgeon
enters his dream/ and begins
to dissect his brain/ She does
not look like a nurse...
Even those of us who con
sider ourselves liberated have
been conditioned to expect
the male pronoun after the
word "neurosurgeon." Rich
makes us realize in the most ef
fective way how ingrained our
sexism is.
Rich also includes in this col
lection a five-part poem on The
Wild Boy of Aveyron by J.M.

Itard which is the account of
the "civilizing" of a boy found
in the forests of Aveyron,
France. He had been aban
doned as an infant, and yet had
survived past his 10th year.
When he was found, he was
dressed and cared for by well
meaning scientists who tried to
discover how he had survived.
This short collection would
be an excellent introduction to
Adrienne Rich's work and is
definitely recommended to
those who would be interested
in hearing her speak later this
quarter when she comes to
Stanford as a guest of the ASSU
Speaker's Bureau.
