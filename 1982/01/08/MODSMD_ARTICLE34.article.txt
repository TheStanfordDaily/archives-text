Diving Into the Wreck
By Adrienne Rich
W.W. Norton & Co.
$3.95, 62 pp.
Those who know of Adri
enne Rich may only know her
as a feminist author/poet;yet
she is much more than this sim
plistic label implies. Diving into
the Wreck is a collection of
poems written in the author's
40s by a sensitive, disillusioned
artist.
She has found that the ac
cepted conventions of modern
living, the traditional roles of

She is a poet tor our times, presenting

dissatisfaction with blind acceptance

is a resident of New York City)

but the subtle, economical and
clever use of words that make
Rich's poetry so gripping, so vi
tally fascinating.
Her imagery often strikes a
nerve and can make one
cringe: your mother dead and
you unborn/ your two hands
grasping your head/ drawing it

Rich does not describe feel
ings; she describes situations
with a subtlety of language that
elicits feeling and a sometimes
