"I am a white working-class
male ..." So begins Jon Snod
grass' introduction to A Book
of Readings For Men Against
Sexism. This is an extraordinary
statement for Snodgrass, a
white working-class male, to
make.
But this is an extraordinary
anthology. Snodgrass admits to
his skin and gender privilege as
a white male, and thereby ex
poses color, class, and gender
as determinant social factors.
The book as a whole, an an
thology of anti-sexist
statements by men, explicitly

admits to male privilege, and
critiques it.
In the little-documented and
barely begun tradition of jour
nals like Unbecoming Men,
Brother: A Forum for Men
Against Sexism, and Double F:
A Magazine of Effeminism,
Snodgrass presents the radical,
personal, and often moving
statements of male anti-sexists.
The contributors are men pro
foundly affected by the wom
en's movement, men engaged
in the often too-painful or too
threatening exploration of
male sexuality and male social
ization.
Perhaps the most striking
quality about this collection of
writings is its focus on male sex
uality — the author's emphasis
on this issue respects a radical
feminist view that locates ine
quality precisely in sexual rela
tions between women and
men.

As Jack Litewka writes in the
first piece, "The Socialized
Penis," " ... I was willing to
deal with ... women on a hu
man (rather than male-to
female) basis, except in relating
to them sexually, where I still
had to deal with them on an ob
jective, fixate, and conqueror
basis."
Although it is extremely
doubtful that there is such a
thing as a "human" basis in a
society in which women and
men are rigidly sex-role de
fined, and although sexuality
does not surface only in the so
called "sex-act," Litewka hits
the central core of the basic
female-male dynamic.
This anthology documents a
hopeful, if not pervasive shift in
male identity — important, ex
traordinary reading.
