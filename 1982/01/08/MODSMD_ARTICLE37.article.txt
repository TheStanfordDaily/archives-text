Madonna Kolbenschlag's
first book, Kiss Sleeping Beauty
Good-Bye, awakened my own
blindness toward sexual stere
otypes. The author gives new
interpretations to traditional
legends dealing with female
development, for example in
the Snow White, Cinderella
and Goldilocks fairy tales.
My surprise was a response
to the freshness of
Kolbenschlag's message — that
it is not the more blatant signs
of sexism which socialize and
repress females but the

"female myths" with which we
unquestioningly grew up.

Kolbenschlag's unique use of

It is not the more blatant signs of sex
ism which socialize and repress
females but the 'female myths' with
which we unquestioningly grew up.

fairy tales. The author draws
out prior steps made in this
direction in such works as Si
mone de Beauvoir's Second
Sex and particularly Bruno Bet
telheim's The Uses of Enchant
ment.
Kolbenschlag, however,
speaks especially effectively to
modern women. She demon
strates the relevance of ancient
legends in a society where the
media still predominantly em
phasizes the importance of
women "looking/smelling
good for him"—the omniscient
male figure around which
many female lives revolve.
Even Stanford would remain an
ambiguous, not-yet fully liber
ated environment in
Kolbenschlag's terms.
Through five well-known
legends, the author develops
her principle theme of female
autonomy. We learn that the
Snow White story is a metaphor
of the negative aspect of the
mother/daughter bond.
As some mothers transmit
their "fear of being women" to
their daughters, obstacles to
female autonomy (spirtual
wholeness) develop. If the first
"mirror" that Snow White
gazes into for self-affirmation is

ambivalent and distorted in the
sense of a mother who re
presses overt behavior, she
may not become a "self-ac
tualized person."
Kolbenschlag ruptures the

foundation of the Snow White
legend which feeds on the
domesticity that grew up with
American independence and
industry.
I found the Cinderella leg
end and its relevance to wom
en's work to be the most
fascinating. From the 345
documented variants of "Cin
derella," a frightening pattern
emerges — that of a heroine
accepting worthlessness and
meaningless tasks in expecta
tions of rescue from her
drudgery.
Again, there are obstacles
which have prevented women
from lacking identities not only
as persons but as workers. The
cultural myth of motherhood
and the role of the homemaker
has been devalued in the
"real" productive world. Sec
ondly, women have generally
failed to view work as a neces
sary component of identity.
Kolbenschlag suggests the
need to repattern the structure
of work in order to recover its
"spirtual" sense for men and
women. Her main point is that
men must integrate worldly
pursuits with the activities of
the home while women must

become increasingly con
vinced that they are needed in
the public sphere. Ideally, a
convergence of home and
work is attained.
Kolbenschlag analyzes my
own favorite childhood fairy
tale, "Goldilocks and the Three
Bears," as a moral fable of the
search for a perfect family. The
dilemma of Goldilocks is that
we expect all our relations, like
our fairy tales, to end "happily
ever after."
Women are typically more
socialized than men to the ne
cessity for affiliation — but

modern changes in the status
of family relationships force us
to break out of the "Gold
ilocks" mold. At first, women
may feel uncomfortable in
their aloneness.
The author believes that
women will learn to engage in
and enjoy solitude which is
creative — rather than trying to
fit in "other's seats" or eat
"porridge which is sweetened
to Father Bear's or Baby Bear's
liking," rather than our own.
I was relieved to discover
that my heroine's — and
Kolbenschlag's — essential
messages are optimistic. Gold
ilocks returns to the forest at
the end of the fable. In contrast
tothe happyending of the Cin
derella fable, Goldilocks re
turns to an enigmatic solitude
— which is the basis of an au
tonomous relationship.
Part of Kolbenschlag's
strength as an author lies in a
near absence of biases towad
her subject. The author, a pro
fessor at a midwestern univer
sity, has been widely published
in scholarly journals. Kiss
Sleeping Beauty Good-Bye is
carefully researched and
documented — each fairy tale
presented in its historical and
social context.
My only problems with the
book resulted from the au
thor's same wide use and
criticism of theorists, which
sometimes obscure her impor
tant message. She manages to
incorporate L. Kohlberg's ethi
cal stages, Soren Kierkegaard's
levels of existence, and Jim
Fowler's life maps into her
book. Kolbenschlag criticizes
literature which has denigrated
the female role — from Seven
teen magazine to Tolstoy's
Anna Karenina.
Kolbenschlag defames
equally traditional women's
work as "overly supportive and
service oriented." For exam
ple, the author proposes that
most female volunteer work is
an act of complicity. One must
realize, however, that
Kolbenschlag is demanding
new, active models of female
work — volunteerism is viable
if its goal is dynamic change
and leads to participation in
decision-making.
Kiss Sleeping Beauty GoocZ-
Bye is not the type of book one
stays up all night reading but it
consistently engages the
reader's attention. The real test
of Kolbenschlag's work will
come as readers undertake the
task she outlines for our gener
ation — the renewal of fairy
tales for our own children and
removal of obstacles to female
autonomy.
Readers must ask how
they can exorcise themselves
from female myths which crip
ple and suppress positive ele
ments of masculinity. The au
thor does not advocate
"masculine" women but views
sexuality as a continuum — "a
dynamic interchange of
energies serving as a bridge
toward autonomy and full per
sonhood."
I would encourage anyone
committed to liberation — not
only female liberation but real
human liberation — to read
Kolbenschlag's prose so that
men and women may become
something new together.

Madonna Kolbenschlag's
first book, Kiss Sleeping Beauty
Good-Bye, awakened my own
blindness toward sexual stere
otypes. The author gives new
interpretations to traditional
legends dealing with female
development, for example in
the Snow White, Cinderella
and Goldilocks fairy tales.
My surprise was a response
to the freshness of
Kolbenschlag's message — that
it is not the more blatant signs
of sexism which socialize and
repress females but the

"female myths" with which we
unquestioningly grew up.
Kiss Sleeping Beauty Good-

feminist literature through
Kolbenschlag's unique use of

It is not the more blatant signs of sex
ism which socialize and repress

which we unquestioningly grew up.

fairy tales. The author draws
out prior steps made in this
direction in such works as Si
mone de Beauvoir's Second
Sex and particularly Bruno Bet
telheim's The Uses of Enchant
ment.
Kolbenschlag, however,
speaks especially effectively to
modern women. She demon
strates the relevance of ancient
legends in a society where the
media still predominantly em
phasizes the importance of
women "looking/smelling
good for him"—the omniscient
male figure around which
many female lives revolve.
Even Stanford would remain an
ambiguous, not-yet fully liber
ated environment in
Kolbenschlag's terms.
Through five well-known
legends, the author develops
her principle theme of female
autonomy. We learn that the
Snow White story is a metaphor
of the negative aspect of the
mother/daughter bond.
As some mothers transmit
their "fear of being women" to
their daughters, obstacles to
female autonomy (spirtual
wholeness) develop. If the first
"mirror" that Snow White
gazes into for self-affirmation is

ambivalent and distorted in the
sense of a mother who re
presses overt behavior, she
may not become a "self-ac
tualized person."
Kolbenschlag ruptures the

foundation of the Snow White
legend which feeds on the
domesticity that grew up with
American independence and
industry.
I found the Cinderella leg
end and its relevance to wom
en's work to be the most
fascinating. From the 345
documented variants of "Cin
derella," a frightening pattern
emerges — that of a heroine
accepting worthlessness and
meaningless tasks in expecta
tions of rescue from her
drudgery.
Again, there are obstacles
which have prevented women
from lacking identities not only
as persons but as workers. The
cultural myth of motherhood
and the role of the homemaker
has been devalued in the
"real" productive world. Sec
ondly, women have generally
failed to view work as a neces
sary component of identity.
Kolbenschlag suggests the
need to repattern the structure
of work in order to recover its
"spirtual" sense for men and
women. Her main point is that
men must integrate worldly
pursuits with the activities of
the home while women must

become increasingly con
vinced that they are needed in
the public sphere. Ideally, a
convergence of home and
work is attained.
Kolbenschlag analyzes my
own favorite childhood fairy
tale, "Goldilocks and the Three
Bears," as a moral fable of the
search for a perfect family. The
dilemma of Goldilocks is that
we expect all our relations, like
our fairy tales, to end "happily
ever after."
Women are typically more
socialized than men to the ne
cessity for affiliation — but

modern changes in the status
of family relationships force us
to break out of the "Gold
ilocks" mold. At first, women
may feel uncomfortable in
their aloneness.
The author believes that
women will learn to engage in
and enjoy solitude which is
creative — rather than trying to
fit in "other's seats" or eat
"porridge which is sweetened
to Father Bear's or Baby Bear's
liking," rather than our own.
I was relieved to discover
that my heroine's — and
Kolbenschlag's — essential
messages are optimistic. Gold
ilocks returns to the forest at
the end of the fable. In contrast
tothe happyending of the Cin
derella fable, Goldilocks re
turns to an enigmatic solitude
— which is the basis of an au
tonomous relationship.
