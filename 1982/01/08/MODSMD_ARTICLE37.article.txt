Madonna Kolbenschlag's
first book, Kiss Sleeping Beauty
Good-Bye, awakened my own
blindness toward sexual stere
otypes. The author gives new
interpretations to traditional
legends dealing with female
development, for example in
the Snow White, Cinderella
and Goldilocks fairy tales.
My surprise was a response
to the freshness of
Kolbenschlag's message — that
it is not the more blatant signs
of sexism which socialize and
repress females but the

"female myths" with which we
unquestioningly grew up.
Kiss Sleeping Beauty Good-
Bye centers itself in present
feminist literature through
Kolbenschlag's unique use of

ism which socialize and repress

fairy tales. The author draws
out prior steps made in this
direction in such works as Si
mone de Beauvoir's Second
Sex and particularly Bruno Bet
telheim's The Uses of Enchant
ment.
Kolbenschlag, however,
speaks especially effectively to
modern women. She demon
strates the relevance of ancient
legends in a society where the
media still predominantly em
phasizes the importance of
women "looking/smelling
good for him"—the omniscient
male figure around which
many female lives revolve.
Even Stanford would remain an
ambiguous, not-yet fully liber
ated environment in
Kolbenschlag's terms.
Through five well-known
legends, the author develops
her principle theme of female
autonomy. We learn that the
Snow White story is a metaphor
of the negative aspect of the
mother/daughter bond.
As some mothers transmit
their "fear of being women" to
their daughters, obstacles to
female autonomy (spirtual
wholeness) develop. If the first
"mirror" that Snow White
gazes into for self-affirmation is

ambivalent and distorted in the
sense of a mother who re
presses overt behavior, she
may not become a "self-ac
tualized person."
Kolbenschlag ruptures the

foundation of the Snow White
legend which feeds on the
domesticity that grew up with
American independence and
industry.
I found the Cinderella leg
end and its relevance to wom
en's work to be the most
fascinating. From the 345
documented variants of "Cin
derella," a frightening pattern
emerges — that of a heroine
accepting worthlessness and
meaningless tasks in expecta
tions of rescue from her
drudgery.
Again, there are obstacles
which have prevented women
from lacking identities not only
as persons but as workers. The
cultural myth of motherhood
and the role of the homemaker
has been devalued in the
"real" productive world. Sec
ondly, women have generally
failed to view work as a neces
sary component of identity.
Kolbenschlag suggests the
need to repattern the structure
of work in order to recover its
"spirtual" sense for men and
women. Her main point is that
men must integrate worldly
pursuits with the activities of
the home while women must
