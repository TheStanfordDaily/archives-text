In Surpassing the Love of
Men, Lillian Faderman ex
plores the experience of "ro
mantic friendship and love be
tween women from the Ren
aissance to the Present."
Faderman synthesizes his
torical, sociological, and liter

ary analyses and interprets the
effects of love between wom
en, and of male-dominated
American and European socie
ties upon one another.
According to Faderman, our
foremothers of the 16th
through 19th centuries
lavished one another with the
intellectual respect,physicalaf
fection, and emotional sus
tenance which was denied
them by men who regarded
women as mentally andspiritu
ally inferior humans to be con
trolled through legally defined
marital property rights. (Name
ly, their husbands.)
Women expressed their love
for one another with pledges
of lifelong devotion, frequent
(often daily) letters, and public
kissing and embracing. Men
who determined social posi
tion celebrated these friend
ships as affectations becoming
to the "gentler sex" who, ac
cording to the prevalent myths,
were incapable of sexual pas
sion or genuine love.
These men did not take
women's friendships seriously
while they exercised control
over female lives through eco
nomic monopoly, and while
they believed in the myth of
feminine asexuality. According
to Faderman, it was not until
economic independence be
came a possibility for women
after WWI, and the subsequent
popularization of Freudian
theories, that love between
women was labelled "neu
rotic" as Sigmund Freud and
his contemporaries became
obsessed with the psy

chological illness: "les
bianism." This label was used
to manipulate women into
choosing to continue their de
pendence upon men.
In her book, Faderman em
phasizes that the romantic
friendships which occurred be-

tween women in the 16th
through 19th centuries were
not genital . . . she cites in
ternalization of the myth of
women's passionlessness to be
a possible explanation for this.
This emphasis raises impor
tant questions about the signif
icance of genital contact (a very
specific form of physical con
tact) in human relations. "Ro
mantic friends" fondled, flat
tered, encouraged, and in
spired one another. They

wrote love poems, kissed,
and shared beds. Most of
them lived apart only be
cause society provided their
husbands with property
rights to their destinies.
It is important to talk spe
cifically about women's ex
perience of their genitals
precisely because the ex
istence and realization of
this experience has been
denied by patriarchal socie
ty. It is equally important
not to trap ourselves into
the trapof framing our con
cerns around this ex
perience — accepting a

male framework in order to
react against it.
Lillian Faderman's work
transcends the dichotomies
which male tradition has im
posed between aspects of
experience such as liter
ature and history, or friends
and lovers, in order to write
about women's experience
of love.
