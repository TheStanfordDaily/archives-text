# Reagan will continue draft registration
## 
### Los Angeles Times with staff reports 
Washington — Reversing his stand
that draft registration is immoral and
destructive of American values, Pres
ident Ronald Reagan yesterday or
dered the indefinite continuation of
peacetime draft registrauon begun
by President jimmy Carter in 1980.
Reagan stressed in a statement that
his decision on registration did not
foreshadow a return to the actual
drafting of youths, and said his ad
ministration remains "steadfast" in
its commitment to an all-volunteer
defense force.
Administration officials said a
grace period of 30 to 60 days would
be extended to young men who have
failed to register for the draft. The
Selective Service law requires all 18-
year-olds to register within 30 days of
their 18th birthday. Failure to do so
could bring a prison term of up to
five years or a $10,000 fine.
Despite those penalties, more

youths are currently failing to reg
ister than at any time in American his
tory, including during the height of
opposition to the Vietnam war.
Selective Service officials said that as
of last Nov. 30, an estimated 800,000
18-year-olds had failed to register, or
23 pel cent of the 7.4 million youths in
that age bracket.
Due to the uncertainty over
whether the president would order a
continuation of the draft or would
stand by his earlier criticisms of regis
tration, the White House last month
ordered the Department of Justice to
temporarily suspend prosecution
agaii .st some of the 800,000 who had
failed to register.
Reaction to the president's de
cision was harsh from critics of draft
registration. Members of Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC), who met
last night at Columbae House to plan
a response, will hold a rally to protest
the decision in the near future, ac

cording to SAC leader Matt Nico
demus. Also, the group plans to dis
tribute leaflets and work with local
outreach groups to explain their re
action.
Calling the Reagan decision "im
moral" Nicodemus said SAC puts lit
tle stock in a president who "has re
versed himself so dramatically."
He said the latest action is solid ev
idence that the administration is
moving closer to implementing a
full-fledged draft.
The administration "will use the
next international crisis" to justify a
military draft, "just as they used the
Palish crisis to reverse their policy on
registration," Nicodemus said.
Claiming that the government
lacks sufficient enforcement power,
he urged non-registrants "not to be
intimidated by Reagan's scare tac
tics."
He added, "We can defeat regis
tration, and through continued re

sistence we can oppose Reagan's en
tire military buildup of which conti
nuing registration is but a part."
Although anti-draft organizations
have ascribed the growing number
of non-registrants to a Vietnam era
type peace movement, the Selective
Service says the failure to register is
simply because "people forget," in
the words of Selective Service official
Joan Lamb.
Selective Service Director Thomas
Turnage said that while a grace peri
od will be allowed for late registrants,
he would have "no other option" but
to turn the names of non-registrants
over to the Department ot Justice for
possibfe prosecutfon. "We think that
prosecution will follow," he added.
During the 1980 presidential cam
paign, Reagan often criticized the
Carter administration's decision in
February 1980, to begin the nation's
first peacetime draft registration.
Carter took that action in response to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
In a letter to Congress urging the
withholding of funds for registration,
Reagan wrote then that the "most
fundamental objection to draft regis
tration is moral.
"Only in the most severe national
emergency does the government
have a claim to the mandatory service
of its young people," he said. "In any
other time, a draft or draft regis
tration destroys the very values that
our society is committed to defend
ing."

paign, Reagan often criticized the
Carter administration's decision in
February 1980, to begin the nation's
first peacetime draft registration.
Carter took that action in response to
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
In a letter to Congress urging the
withholding of funds for registration,
Reagan wrote then that the "most
fundamental objection to draft regis
tration is moral.
"Only in the most severe national
emergency does the government
have a claim to the mandatory service
of its young people," he said. "In any
other time, a draft or draft regis
tration destroys the very values that
our society is committed to defend
ing."
Washington — Reversing his stand
that draft registration is immoral and
destructive of American values, Pres
ident Ronald Reagan yesterday or
dered the indefinite continuation of
peacetime draft registrauon begun
by President jimmy Carter in 1980.
Reagan stressed in a statement that
his decision on registration did not
foreshadow a return to the actual
drafting of youths, and said his ad
ministration remains "steadfast" in
its commitment to an all-volunteer
defense force.
Administration officials said a
grace period of 30 to 60 days would
be extended to young men who have
failed to register for the draft. The
Selective Service law requires all 18-
year-olds to register within 30 days of
their 18th birthday. Failure to do so
could bring a prison term of up to
five years or a $10,000 fine.
Despite those penalties, more

youths are currently failing to reg
ister than at any time in American his
tory, including during the height of
opposition to the Vietnam war.
Selective Service officials said that as
of last Nov. 30, an estimated 800,000
18-year-olds had failed to register, or
23 pel cent of the 7.4 million youths in
that age bracket.
Due to the uncertainty over
whether the president would order a
continuation of the draft or would
stand by his earlier criticisms of regis
tration, the White House last month
ordered the Department of Justice to
temporarily suspend prosecution
agaii .st some of the 800,000 who had
failed to register.
Reaction to the president's de
cision was harsh from critics of draft
registration. Members of Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC), who met
last night at Columbae House to plan
a response, will hold a rally to protest
the decision in the near future, ac

cording to SAC leader Matt Nico
demus. Also, the group plans to dis
tribute leaflets and work with local
outreach groups to explain their re
action.
Calling the Reagan decision "im
moral" Nicodemus said SAC puts lit
tle stock in a president who "has re
versed himself so dramatically."
He said the latest action is solid ev
idence that the administration is
moving closer to implementing a
full-fledged draft.
The administration "will use the
next international crisis" to justify a
military draft, "just as they used the
Palish crisis to reverse their policy on
registration," Nicodemus said.
Claiming that the government
lacks sufficient enforcement power,
he urged non-registrants "not to be
intimidated by Reagan's scare tac
tics."
He added, "We can defeat regis
tration, and through continued re

sistence we can oppose Reagan's en
tire military buildup of which conti
nuing registration is but a part."
Although anti-draft organizations
have ascribed the growing number
of non-registrants to a Vietnam era
type peace movement, the Selective
Service says the failure to register is
simply because "people forget," in
the words of Selective Service official
Joan Lamb.
Selective Service Director Thomas
Turnage said that while a grace peri
od will be allowed for late registrants,
he would have "no other option" but
to turn the names of non-registrants
over to the Department ot Justice for
possibfe prosecutfon. "We think that
prosecution will follow," he added.
