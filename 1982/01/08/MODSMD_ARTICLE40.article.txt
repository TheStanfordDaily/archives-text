## A 						Bill Graham New Year's Eve: '82 checks in,'81 cashes in Greg Kihn: a blue ribbon at the Cow Palace 
### Pete Keyser 
Greg Kihn Band
The Cow Palace/San Fran
cisco
; 31 December 1981

Few musicians have fans
•, devout enough to sit
through four hours of
nerve-wracking warm up
music prior to their per
formance. However, Bay
Area favorite Greg Kihn
helped rock in the New Year
in style after the audience
was first subjected to the
' heavy metal punishment of
Y and T (formerly Yesterday
and Today), and Gamma,
featuring Ronnie Montrose.
A never-say-die group of
unknown rockers, Y and T
has managed to keep their
act together for seven years,
though never tasting
; stardom. While the au
dience was appreciative,
calling Y andT outforanen

core, the band's lack of a
keyboardist and the poor
Cow Palace acoustics com
bined to make their per
formance ineffective.
Y and T feels their use of
Marshall equipment helps
produce the metallic, in
tense sound they desire. Al
though the group made ef
fective use of slow paced
songs such as "Rescue Me,"
lead guitarist David
Meniketti's driving solos
proved too much for the
Cow Palace acoustics to
handle.
Gamma, featuring Ronnie
Montrose, is just that. From
the first song of Gamma's
performance to the last,
Montrose's extravagant
guitar solos are the center of
attraction. While a few
songs generated crowd in
terest, Gamma tends to
abuse and overuse the tal
ent of Montrose so that one

cannot distinguish one song
from another.
Gamma evoked nostalgia
in the audience with their
rendition of "Thunder and
Lightning," one of their bet
ter tunes. However, they left
no optimism for the future
as tracks from their new
album, "Gamma 3," to be
released in February, lacked
ingenuity. -
One particularly poor
piece, "Fight to the Finish,"
was demonstrative of the
whole lot, featuring barking
lyrics and (what else?) an
other Montrose solo.
After the ear-battering Y
and T and Gamma imposed,
relief came in the form of
the Greg Kihn Band. Kihn's
show began with the typical
Bill Graham flair. Kihn ar
rived on stage at exactly
midnight in a rocket ship
lowered from the Cow Pal
ace ceiling, as thousands of

balloons dropped on the
crowd.
Kihn got the audience
rolling with its first song,
"When the Music Starts,"
and never stopped. Most of
the material came from his
latest album, "RocKihn
Roll." Included in this rep
ertoire were "The Breakup
Song," "Valerie," and an
audience participation
number, "Girl Most Likely."
However Kihn made effec
tive use of tracks to be in
cluded in a new album to be
released in the spring.
The well-rounded effect
of Kihn's clear vocals, 12
string guitar and keyboard
rhythm, and crisp, but not
overpowering, guitar solos,
give the Greg Kihn Band a
unique sound. In this era of
plastic sound and the take
the-money-and-run bands,
the Greg Kihn Band puts on
a show well worth waiting
for.
