# EWF lacks an element in Oakland

### Mark Zeigler 
Earth, Wind, and Fire
Oakland Coliseum
31 December 1981

It was the best of concerts, it
was the worst of concerts.
In the waning hours of 1981,
Earth, Wind, and Fire played
the numerous hit songs that
have raised them to a height
equalled by no one in the
pop/soul music kingdom over
the past decade.
But at the same time, EWF
demonstrated that their talent
lies only in their song writing
abilities, not in their in
strumental prowess. And in at
tempting to incorporate mas
terful solos into their star
studded lineup of songs, they
tried too hard in an effort met
with prompt failure.
This both famous and in
famous ordeal took place in
the spacious confines of the
Oakland Coliseum, home of
the Golden State Warriors
basketball team. The court area
was filled with chairs, the stage
being situated at one end of
the arena, allowing for re
served seating. The vast stage
featured two side ramps and a
larger incline in the middle
with the drums set inside it.
And living uptotheirreputa
tion as oligarchs of outlandish
ness, EWF's stage and light
show defied all laws of nor-

mality. The nine EWF members
plus the four-man horn section
donned barbarous costumes
dripping with all the colors of
the rainbow.
The group opened with "Get
Away," rousing the audience
into a festive frenzy. A few
tunes later, however, EWF dis
played their missing element
— the ability to solo — during
"Sing a Song." Both the key
board and bass solos could
have been played with com
parable quality by a novice. To
compensate, the soloists
feigned difficulty, attracting ig
norant cheers from a good deal
of the crowd.
Next, the band jumped into a
less-than-awe-inspiring
medley of their hit songs, in
cluding "Shining Star," "Devo
tion," and "Gratitude." It was
evident that EWF strived for a
quantity rather than a quality
effect.
Nevertheless, the name of
the game at any Earth, Wind
and Fire concert is audience
participation. After the band
had the entire crowd on its feet
dancing, singing, and clapping
in unison during a song, one
got the feeling that EWF could
transform a funeral parlor into
a happening place.
But just as quickly as the au
dience stood up and got into
the act, they sat down and
played dead. It was time for

Roland Batista's guitar solo and
the scene instantly changed
from New Year's Eve Earth,
Wind, and Fire Concert to High
School Dance Revisited.
Bautista, exhibiting no more
talent than a high schooler,
played the same note over and
over for upwards of five
minutes, with his sweat
drenched face clenched in
complete concentration. Yea,
real tough solo. What's more,
one could have closed his eyes
and honestly thought he was at
a Van Halen concert. And
through all this the audience
sat and quietly watched.
However, when discussing
EWF, one should speak of them
as a team, not as individual
players. The group has stuck
together loyally and has not
lost that knack for repeatedly
turning out quality hit songs,
evidenced by their latest chart
topper, "Let's Groove To
night."
Even if they do not possess
much instrumental ability, EWF
can still put on a good show
simply because of the songs
they play. But it is truly sad to
see a band of Earth, Wind, and
Fire's status trying to produce
solos up to par with the songs
themselves and failing mi
serably.
And what made it worse was
that EWF did nothing special

for New Year's besides having
confetti and a few hundred
balloons dropped from the
Coliseum's ceiling. Amid the
mass celebration of 1982's first
moments, the terrific 13 snuck
in a few goodnights and darted
off backstage, making be
lievers of many that they would
grab a drink and come back for
another set. agers to middle-
But they didn't. In fact, they
played the same exact show as
they did the night before. As
they came out for theirfirst en
core, a guy sitting near me an
nounced that EWF would play
two encores and proceeded to
name them ("Let's Groove To
night" and "September"), ob
viously informed of the pre
vious night's show. Then he re
laxed in his chair with the con
fidence of a bookie about to
cash in on a sure bet.
As people filed out of the
Coliseum, there was excite
ment in the air. However, it was
definitely not over EWF's per
formance, but instead seemed
to be directed towards 1982.
There was also an air of disap
pointment present, as if one
had just been let down by a
best friends; in this case, Earth,
Wind, and Fire. Sure, they
played all their hits, but some
thing was still missing — some
thing that EWF must find if they
hope to climb back to the top
of the hilltheyareover.
