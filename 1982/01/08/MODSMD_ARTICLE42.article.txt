# And at the Auditorium, the only good head is a Dead Head

The Grateful Dead
Oakland Auditorium
31 December 1981

The Grateful Dead New Year's Eve shows have become
a tradition among Dead Heads over the last few years.
Thousands of (mostly) scruffy looking folks, from teen
to middle-aged '60s holdouts, congregate from all over
the United States each year for a set of five shows, cul
minating in the New Year's Eve extravaganza. The Dead
have such a diverse and devoted following that tickets
for this year's December 31 show were sold by mail-in
lottery to give East Coast fans a better shot at tickets usu
ally snapped up by their Bay Area counterparts. And the
lady behind me in line must have been at least 50. God,
that's old enough to be Jerry Garcia's sister. Actually,
there was a slight resemblance.
In short, this was really an Event, one that sometimes
overshadowed the concert itself. As such, there was a
wild carnival atmosphere, especially in the park/muddy
campground adjacent to the Oakland Auditorium
where Bill Graham provided occasional free meals and
maintenance. Colorful long dresses, psychedelic tie
dyed t-shirts (yes, they still exist), Levi's, long hair, and
drugs abounded. Several brightly painted converted old
buses, some equipped with water heaters and plumbing
tacked onto the exterior, littered the parking lot. Alto
gether, the whole experience was reminiscent of a sixties
psychedelic revival; representatives of a whole gener
ation emerged from the woodwork New Year's Eve to at
tend. Jerry Garcia once said it, or something like it: "Life
would be so colorless without psychedelics." Well, judg
ing from all appearances, last Thursday's show was a very
colorful experience for much of the crowd.
On the other hand, the Dead appear to have acquired
a new generation of fans in people only a few years old
when the Dead started in 1965, who have only hazy
memories of that period, and probably none of the
Dead. So the band must have some kind of appeal to in
spire such newfound loyalty. Also, it would be a mistake
to label their music as simply psychedelic rock, although
psychedelia obviously plays a part. In fact, it would be
tough to classify the Grateful Dead definitively. They also
play a little country, a little blues, and a little folk, plus
more, all with a rock edge to it. Perhaps their music is
closest to folk-tinged rock, but even this tag is risky.
What much of their music does have in common though,
believe it or not, is a sense of American tradition ("Uncle

John's Band" or "Friend of the Devil," among hundreds
of others, come to mind).
Certainly, the Dead are not a creative force in music
today; their contribution belongs to another era. They
rarely issue new material these days (they did, however,
unveil a few new tunes Tuesday night, I believe) and
their studio records have neverapproached the intensity
of their live concerts. But the Dead can still play, and play
well, and their work does seem to grow on you â€” some
times insidiously, like athlete's foot. In fact, I must reluc
tantly admit that I enjoyed myself New Year's Eve. The
band was really on and played some old favorites not
heard in quite some time. The audience reacted wildly,
accordingly. Of course, if I hadn't been with some Dead
Head friends I would have missed the significance of
much that went on; I'm not exactly an ardent devotee.
Even I however, could tell that this was an exceptionally
good night.
New Year's Eve began, for most of those present, in
cluding unhappily, yours truly, withstanding in line wait
ing for a supposed 4:30 opening time. Many Dead
Heads, though, had also spent most of the night in line
waiting for the few remaining tickets to go on sale early
in the morning. Several unfortunates were still combing
the environs for stray tickets right up to show time, and
some scalpers were asking upwards of a $100.
Predictably, it rained. Not just a drizzle, but intermit
tent bursts of cold, hard rain accompanied by a piercing
wind. When the doors finally opened at six, thousandsof
frozen, wet fans straggled stiffly into the hall, which con
sisted of a large dance floor surmounted by balcony seats
and a roof that occasionally dripped. Bill Graham did,
however, hand out hats and whistles. The crowd thawed
out.
Then, following a juggling act, The New Riders of the
Purple Sage commenced a rather dismal set of country
rock numbers. If you've heard their "hit," "Panama
Red," you get the general idea, and that's their best song.
One particularly odious number contained a lyric that
went something like "You can tell the way she makes
love by the way she dances." More odes to good times
and women followed. At least their performance gave
thirsty concertgoers a chance to check out the bar.
After the New Riders mercifully left the stage and a
short break, Joan Baez walked on, which came as no sur
prise to those who had attended the night before when
she put in a surprise appearance leading off the Dead's
second set. Thursday night she introduced herself by
saying "I'm Joan Baez and I'm a remnant of the '60*"

Well, she said it. She sang a few songs either a capella or
accompanying herself with her own acoustic guitar, and
then finished her short set backed by the Dead's Bob
Weir on acoustic.
Unfortunately, about half of her numbers were re
treads from the previous night, and most didn't bear re
peating. Baez's own compositions fared the worst, gen
erally consisting of trite and cliche ridden lyrics and rath
er pedestrian melodies. Folk music is supposed to be
simple, but it does not have to be uninteresting as well.
Furthermore, her voice does not stand up to close
scrutiny: conviction and volume do not a great voice
make. Indeed, on the several occasions that she chimed
on in Dead tunes her voice seemed more an intrusion
than a compliment, although this was perhaps partly due
to divergent styles. However, Baez did manage pleasant
versions of Paul Simon's "The Boxer" and Kris Kristof
ferson's "Me and Bobby McGee."
Then, The Big Moment. The Dead calmly strolled on
stage and began their first set with a long, slightly psy
chedelic version of "Shake Down Street." Their execu
tion of this song perhaps embodied both the virtues and
flaws of the Dead's music. The tune itself is attractive and
compelling, and it was obvious that the band was on, in
comparison with the previous night's relatively re
strained performance. Jerry Garcia especially was im
pressive on lead guitar on "Shake Down" and through
out the show, crisply and creatively fingering his clean
sounding instrument. The man may not move around a
whole lot, in fact it's a major event if he so much as sways
back and forth, but he sure as hell can play. However, the
song's length and the excessive amount of time devoted
to free form excursions soon bored me. The crowd, on
the other hand, most of whom were in a receptive frame
of mind, as it were, loved it.
For the most part, the crowd seemed rather sedate
during the first set, perhaps not surprisingly considering
that many had been camped out for six days and five
shows. But the band was very energetic, playing even the
usually slow moving blues numbers, such as "Mexicali
Blues" and"C.C. Rider," with nerve and fire. Certainly,
the Dead are not visually exciting: they just stand up
there, play, and create a show through their music. This
may be boring to those used to the flashy visuals of thun
dering pompous heavy metal bands, who need some
thing to distract the audience from the appalling quality
of their music. I, however, find it refreshing.
New Year's festivities succeeded the first set, Ken
Kesey, author of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"

presided. Dressed in white and dangling from the rafters
on a rope over the stage, he introduced a flying joint, the
U.S.S. Columbian, (ha, ha. The crowd roared) containing
Bill Graham dressed as Santa, who dispersed red roses (a
Dead symbol) as the craft slid down wires from the top
balcony to the stage. On the stroke of midnight, the
Dead began their second set with "Aiko Aiko," instead
of the traditional "Sugar Magnolia," surprising and de
lighting Dead Heads who hadn't heard it in years.
An electric set followed, interrupted only be a section
devoted, as usual, to the two man rhythm section bang
ing about on various sets of percussion instruments, and
experimental section of space music, in which the band
wailed away individually and collectively. This isone por
tion of the show that could very easily be dropped, espe
cially since it interrupts the flow of the music and need
lessly reduces the show's intensity. Well, it does give ev
eryone a chance to cool down.
New Year's Eve, though, the Dead, to their credit,
managed to jump right back into it,and by theendofthe
set had stimulated a previously lethargic crowd to dance
in the aisles. In this, the best part of the show, the band
played with precision and emotion, especially on
"Morning Dew," another seldom performed number.
The band did not do an encore. Instead, after another
break, they played a third mini set. All in all, they played
for just over four hours, coming on before 10 and finish
ing at 3:30 the next morning with two 40 minute
breaks. Let it not be said that the Dead don't give the
crowd their money's worth. This third set, just as
energetic as the second, was highlighted by the per
formance of "Dark Star," a rather psychedelic number
seldom played these days, but one on which the Dead
used to jam for an hour and a half in their heyday. That's
probably why they don't play it very often any more. Al
though the rambling, spacy "Dark Star" is not quite my
style, by that time I didn't care, and everyone else sure
went home happy.
While the Grateful Dead may be considered by some
to be an historical rock artifact from a previous era, and
indeed age has diluted some of the impact, that artifact
gave a very good, satisfying show the other night. The
band may not be without flaws, but Thursday's show
proved that they, like other folk-tinged artists such as
Neil Young, have a place in music today. One tip,
though. If you decide to see them some time, go with
one who knows to translate the excitement of the de
voted crowd, which is a major contribution to any Dead
show.
