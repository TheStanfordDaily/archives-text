In striving to avoid the traps of

about D.H. Lawrence and his

bungles the material in surprising

old Mexico, France and Italy, but
we keep losing track of where
they are and who they're talking

Pennies from Heaven
Guild, Menlo Park
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers

Young Frankenstein ***★
Fox, Redwood City
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
Cod. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal version, and the black

tribute much toward the movie's

John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
star in a tiresome film version of
the Thomas Berger novel, a
bewildering mix of suburban
Kafka and slapstick silliness. Larry
Gelbart, who wrote the script,
must have thought he was writing
a black comedy about a middle
class schlemiel (Belushi) whose
quiet, dead end lane is invaded
by a pair of unrestrainable luna
tics (Aykroyd and Kathy Moriar
ty), but the indignities Belushi
suffers are more aggravating than
horrific. Director John G.
Avildsen's notion of style seems
to be to keep everyone bottled

proach to this kind of material.

Cinderella
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Left alone to be a servant in her

Cinderella is ill treated by her
wicked stepmother and two ugly
stepsisters. Yet, with the help of
her fairy godmother, Cinderella

manages to find happiness and
live happily ever after.
Cinderella, as brought to life
by Walt Disney, is filled with rich

charming mice and birds who
come to Cinderella's aid. Cin
derella will make you believe that
there still may be "prince charm

Palo Alio Square
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.

History of the World, Part
One **
Fox, Redwood City
History is receiving more
criticism than any other Mel
Brooks film for its tastelessness.
It's tasteless, all right — the au
dience I saw it with greeted the
Spanish Inquisition sequence
with hostile murmurs of protest
— but, worse than that, it's simply
not all that funny. We've all heard
Brooks' fart jokes and Jew jokes
and queer jokes before, and he
doesn't seem to think he needs to
add anything to make them fresh
enough to laugh at.
Ironically, History may be
Brooks' best looking movie —
maybe he took a summer course
in film composition. Albert
Whitlock's matte work, which
gives Roman skylines to the stu
dio back lot, is quite beautiful.
Madeline Kahn, as Nympho,
Nero's empress, gives the movie's
funniest performance.
Plays tonight and Saturday

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star War's) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

I Franco Zeferelli directed this

I allows Warren Beatty to go all the

this adaptation of the Ken Follett

good director — in fact, his han

Sutherland and Kate Nelligan
star. Sutherland plays a Nazi spy
who could be a brother to the
Nazi he played in 1900; he does it
very well, but noamount of talent
could make the character partic
ularly interesting. Kate Nelligan
plays the Englishwoman who falls
in love with him. Her part is near
ly as poorly written, and she has
to participate in all of the hokier
elements of the plot (which at
tempts to one-up Wait Until Dark

A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and

the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers

here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni

History is receiving more
criticism than any other Mel
Brooks film for its tastelessness.
It's tasteless, all right — the au
dience I saw it with greeted the
Spanish Inquisition sequence
with hostile murmurs of protest
— but, worse than that, it's simply
not all that funny. We've all heard
Brooks' fart jokes and Jew jokes
and queer jokes before, and he
doesn't seem to think he needs to
add anything to make them fresh
enough to laugh at.
Ironically, History may be
Brooks' best looking movie —
maybe he took a summer course
in film composition. Albert
Whitlock's matte work, which
gives Roman skylines to the stu

Madeline Kahn, as Nympho,

represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted

Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star War's) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the

It has been acclaimed by the ov

a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur

the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an

An intelligent, unconven

markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant

restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating

History of the World, Part
One **
Fox, Redwood City
History is receiving more
criticism than any other Mel
Brooks film for its tastelessness.
It's tasteless, all right — the au
dience I saw it with greeted the
Spanish Inquisition sequence
with hostile murmurs of protest
— but, worse than that, it's simply
not all that funny. We've all heard
Brooks' fart jokes and Jew jokes
and queer jokes before, and he
doesn't seem to think he needs to
add anything to make them fresh
enough to laugh at.
Ironically, History may be
Brooks' best looking movie —
maybe he took a summer course
in film composition. Albert
Whitlock's matte work, which
gives Roman skylines to the stu
dio back lot, is quite beautiful.
Madeline Kahn, as Nympho,
Nero's empress, gives the movie's
funniest performance.
Plays tonight and Saturday
with Young Frankenstein.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star War's) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.

Endless Love
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Melodrama triumphs turgidly
in this torrid ta/e of teenaged in
temperance. Brooke Shields end
lessly loves Martin Hewitt, who
burns down her house, spends
two years in an institution, breaks
parole, causes her father's death,
and loves her endlessly, too.
I Franco Zeferelli directed this
uncredited remake of Splendor
- in the Grass, in which Natalie
i Wood, teenagedly intemperant,
I allows Warren Beatty to go all the
1 way with her and goes crazy be
cause of it. In Zeferelli's version,
going all the way means always
having to say you're sorry.
Plays tonight only with The
Blue Lagoon.

Marooned all alone in a tropical

Kleiser (Crease) has seen to it that
there's something here to offend

they're being threatened by

Casablanca *★★★
Tonight, Kresgc
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. As Rick and llsa,
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman are one of the screen's
perfect couples: this was a match
made in movie heaven. Michael
Curtiz, a Warner Brothers con
tract director, was handed a rou
tine (and unfinished) script and
all the actors the studio had to of
fer. The result is a lot more than
routine — in its enduring appeal,
Casablanca has made movie his
tory.
Also featured are Dooley
Wilson, Claude Rains, Peter
Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and
many others.

Eye of the Needle **
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Richard Marquand directed
this adaptation of the Ken Follett
novel. Marquand isn't a very
good director — in fact, his han
dling of the "action" pieces
(these tending toward stabbings
and hackings) makes him seem
borderline incompetent. Donald
Sutherland and Kate Nelligan
star. Sutherland plays a Nazi spy
who could be a brother to the
Nazi he played in 1900; he does it
very well, but noamount of talent
could make the character partic
ularly interesting. Kate Nelligan
plays the Englishwoman who falls
in love with him. Her part is near
ly as poorly written, and she has
to participate in all of the hokier
elements of the plot (which at
tempts to one-up Wait Until Dark
and fails). But Nelligan manages
to make her character come
alive; we actually like the woman
she portrays. She may be the only
human being in the movie. One
can only hope that her next film
finds her among some others.

Priest of Love **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
In striving to avoid the traps of
biographical movies, this film
about D.H. Lawrence and his
wife, Frieda Van Richthofen,
bungles the material in surprising
ways: it is a bewilderingly struc
tured set of flashbacks that inter
rupt an endless travelogue. The
Lawrences take in New Mexico,
old Mexico, France and Italy, but
we keep losing track of where
they are and who they're talking
to. Lan McKellen, ideally cast as
Lawrence, has some strong mo
ments, but it's just a sketch; Janet
Suzman, as Frieda, comes off
much better.
Double-billed with The Fox
next Tuesday and Wednesday.

Pennies from Heaven
Guild, Menlo Park
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s. This is a mov
ie of incredible emotional in
tensity, written by Dennis Potter
and shot and designed in the style
of Edward Hopper.

Young Frankenstein ***★
Fox, Redwood City
Mel Brooks directed this
faithful sendup of Mary Shelley's
tale of a man who dares to play
Cod. Young Frankenstein is
probably the best Brooks movie
— there's a trace of real affection
here, something I've never
before or since detected in the
director's work. The Mel Brooks
Repertory Players are all in fine
form. Gene Wilder stars as the
Frankenstein heir who creates a
monster that looks alarmingly
like Peter Boyle. Cloris Leachman
plays Frau Blucher, a woman
whose very name causes panic in
the streets. And the ever-present
Madelaine Kahn portrays a nice
girl who learns to love life and
live love. The sets, some of them
restored from the original Uni
versal version, and the black
and-white photography con
tribute much toward the movie's
success.
Double-billed with History of
the World, Part I tonight and Sat
urday.

Dear Inspector
Fox, Redwood City
Not even the talented Annie
Giradot can salvage much of this
over-violent, sometimes cloying
mystery/romance. It's a thor
oughly unconvincing movie.
Girardot plays a "lady detective."
It's on this unabashedly sexist
basis that the film views her — the
movie's idea of a good joke is to
have her drop everything to have
her hair done. Philippe Noiret
co-stars. Philippe de Broca (King
Of Hearts) directed.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Jupiter's Thigh.

Absence of Malice
Old Mill, Mountain View
Visually, Sidney Pollock's mov
ie is flat and conventional, and
Kurt Luedtke's script, an indict
ment of irresponsible journalism
and incidious methods of crimi
nal investigation, lacks punch,
too. The story is plausible, but the
filmmakers don't ask us to weigh
the issues: they've already de
cided who's to blame and how
the characters should have be
haved. As the journalist, Sally
Field gives a bland, unnuanced

rm> -
performance. The movie's only
real substance is Paul Newman's
acting in the role of the man un
fairly implicated in the disap
pearance of a union leader.
— S.V.
The Producers **
Fox, Redwood City
A movie that has forged an
amazingly durable reputaion on
the strength of one good gag.
One gets the feeling that director
Mel Brooks would have pre
ferred to be making "Springtime
for Hitler," the play-within-the
film, than the movie itself. Its TV
style ugliness — the camera never
seems to be in the right place,
and the whole thing has an un
pleasant greenish cast — is a text
book case in ineptitude. Zero
Mostel, overacting fiendishly,
stars as the producer who sets out
to make a flop; Gene Wilder,
pink-eyed and wilted, plays
Mostell's mild-mannered ac
countant.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with A Funny Thing Happened
on the Way to the Forum.

Neighbors *
Old Mill, Mountain View
John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
star in a tiresome film version of
the Thomas Berger novel, a
bewildering mix of suburban
Kafka and slapstick silliness. Larry
Gelbart, who wrote the script,
must have thought he was writing
a black comedy about a middle
class schlemiel (Belushi) whose
quiet, dead end lane is invaded
by a pair of unrestrainable luna
tics (Aykroyd and Kathy Moriar
ty), but the indignities Belushi
suffers are more aggravating than
horrific. Director John G.
Avildsen's notion of style seems
to be to keep everyone bottled
up — the worst possible ap
proach to this kind of material.
