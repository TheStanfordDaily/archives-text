Storm damage continues
Los Angeles — Grim-faced and weary, professionals and
volunteers slogged through tangles of fallen trees and knee
deep mud yesterday, trying to reach what almost certainly is
the earthen tomb of as many as eight people in the Santa
Cruz County village of Ben Lomond.
The confirmed death toll for the largely rural resort county
rose to 11 yesterday with the discovery of an unidentified
man's body in another mud slide in Scotts Valley, sheriff's
Sgt. Bruce Simpson said.
Although a sheriff's spokesman reported Wednesday that
as many as 20 people were trapped in the homes along Love
Creek in Ben Lomond, Simpson said yesterday that he be
lieves that there were no more than eight.
Santa Cruz County was the hardest-hit of the Northern
California counties in terms of loss of life.
The unofficial death toll for the entire region during the
ferocious storm and its aftermath ranges from 24 to 29.
Total damages for the 200-mile stretch of the state "will be
$200 million, possibly higher," according to Jack Kearns,
deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services.
Gary Patton, chairman of the Santa Cruz County Board of
Supervisors, estimated that 100 to 500 people were still
isolated yesterday in cabins and homes cut off from roads by
fallen trees and mud slides.
Patton estimated that more than 100 houses were de
stroyed by flooding and mud slides, and many others were
"substantially damaged."
Solidarity accused of confrontation
Poland's military rulers said soldiers were working in fac
tories, mines and farms and "protecting" transport yester
day, and accused the Solidarity union of planning to con
front the Communist regime with spikes, gasoline bombs
and barricades.
The report of soldiers on the job indicated large-scale
worker boycotts. Underground Solidarity letters have urged
passive resistance, but Warsaw television said a Solidarity
document called for confrontation.
The document, prepared before the imposition of martial
law in December, also called for disruption of radio and TV
programs, establishment of Solidarity channels of com
munication including short-wave radio operators, and using
church services for "propaganda purposes," the official
broadcast said.
Poland's Communist Party Central Committee presidium,
meeting yesterday in Warsaw, said anti-corruption laws
would be enforced strictly to make sure high officials do not
abuse their posts for personal gain, along with a "resolute
struggle against all manifestations of bribery, string-pulling
and clique-creation," the official radio said.
Feds may sell land
Washington — The Reagan administration is considering
selling excess federal land and other property as a limited
means of reducing the federal debt, presidential counsellor
Edwin Meese 111 said yesterday. Federal land sales are "a very
alive" issue for the forthcoming 1983 budget, a budget of
ficial later confirmed.
The most difficult issue facing the president is whether to
raise taxes, as most of his advisers reportedly favor, in order
to narrow the large federal budget deficits otherwise
projected for fiscal 1983 and 1984. Although there is no one
set of proposals for tax increases behind which officials are
united, the president accused them of "ganging up on him"
after one meeting when taxes were discussed, a senior of
ficial said this week.
Other budget decisions already made include a 15 percent
increase in defense spending for fiscal 1983. This would take
defense spending to about $220 billion, and be equivalent to
a real increase after inflation of about 7 percent from 1982.
President Ronald Reagan has apparently ruled out saving
money by paring his planned defense buildup.
He said the White House was looking at a number of ways
of reducing outstanding federal debt, for example using
"unnecessary federal or public property." Although Meese

suggested that any money raised this way should be put into
a separate "capital" account, and not used directly to reduce
the budget deficit, it would have the "practical effect" in fi
nancial markets of cutting the deficit and so easing the pres
sures of high interest rates, a budget official said later.
A new trust fund could be set up that would get revenues
from land sales and use them to purchase government debt,
the offical suggested. Such sales could raise $2 billion or $3
billion a year. This would in fact reduce the budget deficit.
Meese conceded that the 1982 budget had been "as much
of a quick fix as possible."
Europe considers sanctions
London — Major West European countries are consider
ing a series of measures designed — in carrot-and-stick fash
ion — to encourage the lifting of martial law in Poland, ac
cording to diplomats here and in other West European capi
tals.
The program includes what was described as substantial
economic aid for Warsaw if the military rule is ended and ec
onomic sanctions directed against Poland and to a lesser ex
tent against the Soviet Union if it is not.
The Reagan administration has indicated it would be satis
fied with only a strong statement of condemnation from next
Monday's meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.
Neverthless, British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington said
in an interview that Washington still "wants to see some ac
tion" from the Europeans that would complement although
not match the sanctions Reagan has imposed against Poland
and the Soviet Union.
France, which has taken a much tougher stand toward the
Soviet Union's role in the Polish crackdown than the other
West European states, is reconsidering the scope of its in
volvement in the multibillion-dollar pipeline deal, Washing
ton Post correspondent Edward Cody reported from Paris.
Among the several proposals that have been sent to Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand is one that would reduce the
amount of gas France would take annually from the pipeline
from 8 billion to 6 billion cubic meters, Cody reported.
Casey under investigation
Washington — CIA Director William Casey failed to tell a
Senate committee investigating his past business dealings of
the full extent of his lobbying of Treasury and State Depart
ment officials on behalf of Indonesia in 1976, government
documents show.
The Justice Department's criminal division is reviewing the
matter to see if Casey violated federal law by failing to reg
ister as a foreign agent. Department officials say that in the
past, criminal charges have been brought only when a for
eign agent tried to conceal his work.
In a revised disclosure statement filed with the Senate In
telligence Committee last September — two days before the
panel ended its active investigation of Casey — the CIA di
rector acknowledged he had one meeting at Treasury and
two meetings at the Internal Revenue Service in 1976 while
representing Indonesia on a tax question involving that na
tion's oil industry.
Casey did not say with whom he met. He submitted a letter
from his former law firm, Rogers & Wells, which described
the two sessions at IRS as "information meetings."
But IRS documents obtained by The Associated Press show
that Casey also contacted the State Department. And both
documents and the recollection of officials who were then
involved with the issue indicate that Casey also contacted
Charles Walker, the assistant treasury secretary for tax policy,
and possibly Treasury Secretary William Simon himself.
The documents and interviews show that Casey was lobby
ing administration officials outside formal channels to
change U.S. tax rulings on a matter of high importance to In
donesia.
Asked about the matter, the CIA said yesterday, "Rogers &
Wells made a good faith determination in 1976 that no regis
tration was called for. The firm continues to believe that de
termination was correct, and Mr. Casey concurs." The agen
cy declined to answer any other questions.

Court clears Marathon takeover
Washington — Chief Justice Warren Burger on Wednes
day refused to block U.S. Steel Corp.'s proposed $6.3 billion
takeover of Marathon Oil.
The refusal cleared the way for U.S. Steel to begin buying
Marathon's shares after midnight Wednesday.
For the second time in a week, Burger turned down an
emergency request by rival bidder Mobil Oil Corp..
Burger's action was announced minutes before 5 p.m. —
seven hours before the takeover was scheduled to begin.
His brief order said he had first consulted other members
of the court, adding: "no contrary views having been ex
pressed, the (emergency request) is denied."
Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, had asked
Burger to freeze the takeover fight until the full Supreme
Court has a chance to hear a formal appeal Mobil filed last
week.
The appeal, which is still pending and may not be acted on
for months, challenges a ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals preventing Mobil from joining in the bidding for
Marathon stock.
The appeals court ruled that Mobil's acquisition of Mara
thon probably would violate federal antitrust laws. Mara
thon, based in Findlay, Ohio, is the 17th largest oil company.
Cranston may run tor President
Los Angeles — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) disclosed
Wednesday that a committee will be formed later this month
to explore the "desirability and feasibility" of his running for
president in 1984.
Cranston said in an interview that he has made no decision
to run. But he indicated that he would like to run if he is con
vinced it would not be a quixotic gesture.
Attorney Allyn Kreps, a longtime Cranston confidant, ac
companied the senator to the interview and said he will be
instrumental in putting together the exploratory committee,
which may be formed by Jan. 19.
Cranston said his decision to explore formally running for
president was made in a family meeting around Thanksgiv
ing. He said a number of people have approached him about
the possibility.
But at least two close Cranston associates over the years
said privately Wednesday that the senator's interest in run
ning took them greatly by surprise.
Reforms that are being contemplated in the Democratic
nomination process would give officeholders and party
elders more representation in the national convention and
leave perhaps 25 of the total delegates uncommitted going
into the convention, far more than in the recent past.
Cranston indicated that he believes this provides tested vet
erans such as himself with a better chance of winning the
nomination.
Market down only slightly
New York — The stock market closed slightly lower yester
day after an afternoon recovery enabled many issues to pare
morning losses.
New York Stock Exchange losers had led gainers better
than 2-1, but the ratio narrowed to about 7-6 by the closing
bell.
Still the afternoon upturn following two sessions of broad
setbacks "was a temporary pause in the (market's) decline,"
asserted Jack Conlon, first vice president of E.F. Hutton & Co.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday with a slow and warming trend. Lows
in the mid 20s to 40s, highs in the 50s.

Total damages for the 200-mile stretch of the state "will be
$200 million, possibly higher," according to Jack Kearns,
deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services.
Gary Patton, chairman of the Santa Cruz County Board of
Supervisors, estimated that 100 to 500 people were still
isolated yesterday in cabins and homes cut off from roads by
fallen trees and mud slides.
Patton estimated that more than 100 houses were de
stroyed by flooding and mud slides, and many others were
"substantially damaged."
Solidarity accused of confrontation
Poland's military rulers said soldiers were working in fac
tories, mines and farms and "protecting" transport yester
day, and accused the Solidarity union of planning to con
front the Communist regime with spikes, gasoline bombs
and barricades.
The report of soldiers on the job indicated large-scale
worker boycotts. Underground Solidarity letters have urged
passive resistance, but Warsaw television said a Solidarity
document called for confrontation.
The document, prepared before the imposition of martial
law in December, also called for disruption of radio and TV
programs, establishment of Solidarity channels of com
munication including short-wave radio operators, and using
church services for "propaganda purposes," the official
broadcast said.
Poland's Communist Party Central Committee presidium,
meeting yesterday in Warsaw, said anti-corruption laws
would be enforced strictly to make sure high officials do not
abuse their posts for personal gain, along with a "resolute
struggle against all manifestations of bribery, string-pulling
and clique-creation," the official radio said.
Feds may sell land
Washington — The Reagan administration is considering
selling excess federal land and other property as a limited
means of reducing the federal debt, presidential counsellor
Edwin Meese 111 said yesterday. Federal land sales are "a very
alive" issue for the forthcoming 1983 budget, a budget of
ficial later confirmed.
The most difficult issue facing the president is whether to
raise taxes, as most of his advisers reportedly favor, in order
to narrow the large federal budget deficits otherwise
projected for fiscal 1983 and 1984. Although there is no one
set of proposals for tax increases behind which officials are
united, the president accused them of "ganging up on him"
after one meeting when taxes were discussed, a senior of
ficial said this week.
Other budget decisions already made include a 15 percent
increase in defense spending for fiscal 1983. This would take
defense spending to about $220 billion, and be equivalent to
a real increase after inflation of about 7 percent from 1982.
President Ronald Reagan has apparently ruled out saving
money by paring his planned defense buildup.
He said the White House was looking at a number of ways
of reducing outstanding federal debt, for example using
"unnecessary federal or public property." Although Meese

suggested that any money raised this way should be put into
a separate "capital" account, and not used directly to reduce
the budget deficit, it would have the "practical effect" in fi
nancial markets of cutting the deficit and so easing the pres
sures of high interest rates, a budget official said later.
A new trust fund could be set up that would get revenues
from land sales and use them to purchase government debt,
the offical suggested. Such sales could raise $2 billion or $3
billion a year. This would in fact reduce the budget deficit.
Meese conceded that the 1982 budget had been "as much
of a quick fix as possible."
Europe considers sanctions
London — Major West European countries are consider
ing a series of measures designed — in carrot-and-stick fash
ion — to encourage the lifting of martial law in Poland, ac
cording to diplomats here and in other West European capi
tals.
The program includes what was described as substantial
economic aid for Warsaw if the military rule is ended and ec
onomic sanctions directed against Poland and to a lesser ex
tent against the Soviet Union if it is not.
The Reagan administration has indicated it would be satis
fied with only a strong statement of condemnation from next
Monday's meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.
Neverthless, British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington said
in an interview that Washington still "wants to see some ac
tion" from the Europeans that would complement although
not match the sanctions Reagan has imposed against Poland
and the Soviet Union.
France, which has taken a much tougher stand toward the
Soviet Union's role in the Polish crackdown than the other
West European states, is reconsidering the scope of its in
volvement in the multibillion-dollar pipeline deal, Washing
ton Post correspondent Edward Cody reported from Paris.
Among the several proposals that have been sent to Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand is one that would reduce the
amount of gas France would take annually from the pipeline
from 8 billion to 6 billion cubic meters, Cody reported.
Casey under investigation
Washington — CIA Director William Casey failed to tell a
Senate committee investigating his past business dealings of
the full extent of his lobbying of Treasury and State Depart
ment officials on behalf of Indonesia in 1976, government
documents show.
The Justice Department's criminal division is reviewing the
matter to see if Casey violated federal law by failing to reg
ister as a foreign agent. Department officials say that in the
past, criminal charges have been brought only when a for
eign agent tried to conceal his work.
In a revised disclosure statement filed with the Senate In
telligence Committee last September — two days before the
panel ended its active investigation of Casey — the CIA di
rector acknowledged he had one meeting at Treasury and
two meetings at the Internal Revenue Service in 1976 while
representing Indonesia on a tax question involving that na
tion's oil industry.
Casey did not say with whom he met. He submitted a letter
from his former law firm, Rogers & Wells, which described
the two sessions at IRS as "information meetings."
But IRS documents obtained by The Associated Press show
that Casey also contacted the State Department. And both
documents and the recollection of officials who were then
involved with the issue indicate that Casey also contacted
Charles Walker, the assistant treasury secretary for tax policy,
and possibly Treasury Secretary William Simon himself.
The documents and interviews show that Casey was lobby
ing administration officials outside formal channels to
change U.S. tax rulings on a matter of high importance to In
donesia.
Asked about the matter, the CIA said yesterday, "Rogers &
Wells made a good faith determination in 1976 that no regis
tration was called for. The firm continues to believe that de
termination was correct, and Mr. Casey concurs." The agen
cy declined to answer any other questions.

Court clears Marathon takeover
Washington — Chief Justice Warren Burger on Wednes
day refused to block U.S. Steel Corp.'s proposed $6.3 billion
takeover of Marathon Oil.
The refusal cleared the way for U.S. Steel to begin buying
Marathon's shares after midnight Wednesday.
For the second time in a week, Burger turned down an
emergency request by rival bidder Mobil Oil Corp..
Burger's action was announced minutes before 5 p.m. —
seven hours before the takeover was scheduled to begin.
His brief order said he had first consulted other members
of the court, adding: "no contrary views having been ex
pressed, the (emergency request) is denied."
Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, had asked
Burger to freeze the takeover fight until the full Supreme
Court has a chance to hear a formal appeal Mobil filed last
week.
The appeal, which is still pending and may not be acted on
for months, challenges a ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals preventing Mobil from joining in the bidding for
Marathon stock.
The appeals court ruled that Mobil's acquisition of Mara
thon probably would violate federal antitrust laws. Mara
thon, based in Findlay, Ohio, is the 17th largest oil company.
Cranston may run tor President
Los Angeles — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) disclosed
Wednesday that a committee will be formed later this month
to explore the "desirability and feasibility" of his running for
president in 1984.
Cranston said in an interview that he has made no decision
to run. But he indicated that he would like to run if he is con
vinced it would not be a quixotic gesture.
Attorney Allyn Kreps, a longtime Cranston confidant, ac
companied the senator to the interview and said he will be
instrumental in putting together the exploratory committee,
which may be formed by Jan. 19.
Cranston said his decision to explore formally running for
president was made in a family meeting around Thanksgiv
ing. He said a number of people have approached him about
the possibility.
But at least two close Cranston associates over the years
said privately Wednesday that the senator's interest in run
ning took them greatly by surprise.
Reforms that are being contemplated in the Democratic
nomination process would give officeholders and party
elders more representation in the national convention and
leave perhaps 25 of the total delegates uncommitted going
into the convention, far more than in the recent past.
Cranston indicated that he believes this provides tested vet
erans such as himself with a better chance of winning the
nomination.
Market down only slightly
New York — The stock market closed slightly lower yester
day after an afternoon recovery enabled many issues to pare
morning losses.
New York Stock Exchange losers had led gainers better
than 2-1, but the ratio narrowed to about 7-6 by the closing
bell.
Still the afternoon upturn following two sessions of broad
setbacks "was a temporary pause in the (market's) decline,"
asserted Jack Conlon, first vice president of E.F. Hutton & Co.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday with a slow and warming trend. Lows

Storm damage continues
Los Angeles — Grim-faced and weary, professionals and
volunteers slogged through tangles of fallen trees and knee
deep mud yesterday, trying to reach what almost certainly is
the earthen tomb of as many as eight people in the Santa
Cruz County village of Ben Lomond.
The confirmed death toll for the largely rural resort county
rose to 11 yesterday with the discovery of an unidentified
man's body in another mud slide in Scotts Valley, sheriff's
Sgt. Bruce Simpson said.
Although a sheriff's spokesman reported Wednesday that
as many as 20 people were trapped in the homes along Love
Creek in Ben Lomond, Simpson said yesterday that he be
lieves that there were no more than eight.
Santa Cruz County was the hardest-hit of the Northern
California counties in terms of loss of life.
The unofficial death toll for the entire region during the
ferocious storm and its aftermath ranges from 24 to 29.
Total damages for the 200-mile stretch of the state "will be

document called for confrontation.
The document, prepared before the imposition of martial
law in December, also called for disruption of radio and TV
programs, establishment of Solidarity channels of com
munication including short-wave radio operators, and using
church services for "propaganda purposes," the official
broadcast said.
Poland's Communist Party Central Committee presidium,
meeting yesterday in Warsaw, said anti-corruption laws
would be enforced strictly to make sure high officials do not
abuse their posts for personal gain, along with a "resolute
struggle against all manifestations of bribery, string-pulling
and clique-creation," the official radio said.
Feds may sell land
Washington — The Reagan administration is considering
selling excess federal land and other property as a limited
means of reducing the federal debt, presidential counsellor
Edwin Meese 111 said yesterday. Federal land sales are "a very
alive" issue for the forthcoming 1983 budget, a budget of
ficial later confirmed.
The most difficult issue facing the president is whether to
raise taxes, as most of his advisers reportedly favor, in order
to narrow the large federal budget deficits otherwise
projected for fiscal 1983 and 1984. Although there is no one
set of proposals for tax increases behind which officials are
united, the president accused them of "ganging up on him"
after one meeting when taxes were discussed, a senior of
ficial said this week.
Other budget decisions already made include a 15 percent
increase in defense spending for fiscal 1983. This would take
defense spending to about $220 billion, and be equivalent to
a real increase after inflation of about 7 percent from 1982.
President Ronald Reagan has apparently ruled out saving
money by paring his planned defense buildup.
He said the White House was looking at a number of ways
of reducing outstanding federal debt, for example using
"unnecessary federal or public property." Although Meese

suggested that any money raised this way should be put into
a separate "capital" account, and not used directly to reduce
the budget deficit, it would have the "practical effect" in fi
nancial markets of cutting the deficit and so easing the pres
sures of high interest rates, a budget official said later.
A new trust fund could be set up that would get revenues
from land sales and use them to purchase government debt,
the offical suggested. Such sales could raise $2 billion or $3
billion a year. This would in fact reduce the budget deficit.
Meese conceded that the 1982 budget had been "as much
of a quick fix as possible."
Europe considers sanctions
London — Major West European countries are consider
ing a series of measures designed — in carrot-and-stick fash
ion — to encourage the lifting of martial law in Poland, ac
cording to diplomats here and in other West European capi
tals.
The program includes what was described as substantial
economic aid for Warsaw if the military rule is ended and ec
onomic sanctions directed against Poland and to a lesser ex
tent against the Soviet Union if it is not.
The Reagan administration has indicated it would be satis
fied with only a strong statement of condemnation from next
Monday's meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels.
Neverthless, British Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington said
in an interview that Washington still "wants to see some ac
tion" from the Europeans that would complement although
not match the sanctions Reagan has imposed against Poland
and the Soviet Union.
France, which has taken a much tougher stand toward the
Soviet Union's role in the Polish crackdown than the other
West European states, is reconsidering the scope of its in
volvement in the multibillion-dollar pipeline deal, Washing
ton Post correspondent Edward Cody reported from Paris.
Among the several proposals that have been sent to Presi
dent Francois Mitterrand is one that would reduce the
amount of gas France would take annually from the pipeline
from 8 billion to 6 billion cubic meters, Cody reported.
Casey under investigation
Washington — CIA Director William Casey failed to tell a
Senate committee investigating his past business dealings of
the full extent of his lobbying of Treasury and State Depart
ment officials on behalf of Indonesia in 1976, government
documents show.
The Justice Department's criminal division is reviewing the
matter to see if Casey violated federal law by failing to reg
ister as a foreign agent. Department officials say that in the
past, criminal charges have been brought only when a for
eign agent tried to conceal his work.
In a revised disclosure statement filed with the Senate In
telligence Committee last September — two days before the
panel ended its active investigation of Casey — the CIA di
rector acknowledged he had one meeting at Treasury and
two meetings at the Internal Revenue Service in 1976 while
representing Indonesia on a tax question involving that na
tion's oil industry.
Casey did not say with whom he met. He submitted a letter
from his former law firm, Rogers & Wells, which described
the two sessions at IRS as "information meetings."
But IRS documents obtained by The Associated Press show
that Casey also contacted the State Department. And both
documents and the recollection of officials who were then
involved with the issue indicate that Casey also contacted
Charles Walker, the assistant treasury secretary for tax policy,
and possibly Treasury Secretary William Simon himself.
The documents and interviews show that Casey was lobby
ing administration officials outside formal channels to
change U.S. tax rulings on a matter of high importance to In
donesia.
Asked about the matter, the CIA said yesterday, "Rogers &
Wells made a good faith determination in 1976 that no regis
tration was called for. The firm continues to believe that de
termination was correct, and Mr. Casey concurs." The agen
cy declined to answer any other questions.

Court clears Marathon takeover
Washington — Chief Justice Warren Burger on Wednes
day refused to block U.S. Steel Corp.'s proposed $6.3 billion
takeover of Marathon Oil.
The refusal cleared the way for U.S. Steel to begin buying
Marathon's shares after midnight Wednesday.
For the second time in a week, Burger turned down an
emergency request by rival bidder Mobil Oil Corp..
Burger's action was announced minutes before 5 p.m. —
seven hours before the takeover was scheduled to begin.
His brief order said he had first consulted other members
of the court, adding: "no contrary views having been ex
pressed, the (emergency request) is denied."
Mobil, the nation's second-largest oil company, had asked
Burger to freeze the takeover fight until the full Supreme
Court has a chance to hear a formal appeal Mobil filed last
week.
The appeal, which is still pending and may not be acted on
for months, challenges a ruling by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals preventing Mobil from joining in the bidding for
Marathon stock.
The appeals court ruled that Mobil's acquisition of Mara
thon probably would violate federal antitrust laws. Mara
thon, based in Findlay, Ohio, is the 17th largest oil company.
Cranston may run tor President
Los Angeles — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) disclosed
Wednesday that a committee will be formed later this month
to explore the "desirability and feasibility" of his running for
president in 1984.
Cranston said in an interview that he has made no decision
to run. But he indicated that he would like to run if he is con
vinced it would not be a quixotic gesture.
Attorney Allyn Kreps, a longtime Cranston confidant, ac
companied the senator to the interview and said he will be
instrumental in putting together the exploratory committee,
which may be formed by Jan. 19.
Cranston said his decision to explore formally running for
president was made in a family meeting around Thanksgiv
ing. He said a number of people have approached him about
the possibility.
But at least two close Cranston associates over the years
said privately Wednesday that the senator's interest in run
ning took them greatly by surprise.
Reforms that are being contemplated in the Democratic
nomination process would give officeholders and party
elders more representation in the national convention and
leave perhaps 25 of the total delegates uncommitted going
into the convention, far more than in the recent past.
Cranston indicated that he believes this provides tested vet
erans such as himself with a better chance of winning the
nomination.
Market down only slightly
New York — The stock market closed slightly lower yester
day after an afternoon recovery enabled many issues to pare
morning losses.
New York Stock Exchange losers had led gainers better
than 2-1, but the ratio narrowed to about 7-6 by the closing
bell.
Still the afternoon upturn following two sessions of broad
setbacks "was a temporary pause in the (market's) decline,"
asserted Jack Conlon, first vice president of E.F. Hutton & Co.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday with a slow and warming trend. Lows
in the mid 20s to 40s, highs in the 50s.

Storm damage continues
Los Angeles — Grim-faced and weary, professionals and
volunteers slogged through tangles of fallen trees and knee
deep mud yesterday, trying to reach what almost certainly is
the earthen tomb of as many as eight people in the Santa
Cruz County village of Ben Lomond.
The confirmed death toll for the largely rural resort county
rose to 11 yesterday with the discovery of an unidentified
man's body in another mud slide in Scotts Valley, sheriff's
Sgt. Bruce Simpson said.
Although a sheriff's spokesman reported Wednesday that
as many as 20 people were trapped in the homes along Love
Creek in Ben Lomond, Simpson said yesterday that he be
lieves that there were no more than eight.
Santa Cruz County was the hardest-hit of the Northern
California counties in terms of loss of life.
The unofficial death toll for the entire region during the
ferocious storm and its aftermath ranges from 24 to 29.
Total damages for the 200-mile stretch of the state "will be
$200 million, possibly higher," according to Jack Kearns,
deputy director of the state Office of Emergency Services.
Gary Patton, chairman of the Santa Cruz County Board of
Supervisors, estimated that 100 to 500 people were still
isolated yesterday in cabins and homes cut off from roads by
fallen trees and mud slides.
Patton estimated that more than 100 houses were de
stroyed by flooding and mud slides, and many others were
"substantially damaged."
Solidarity accused of confrontation
Poland's military rulers said soldiers were working in fac
tories, mines and farms and "protecting" transport yester
day, and accused the Solidarity union of planning to con
front the Communist regime with spikes, gasoline bombs
and barricades.
The report of soldiers on the job indicated large-scale
worker boycotts. Underground Solidarity letters have urged
passive resistance, but Warsaw television said a Solidarity
document called for confrontation.
The document, prepared before the imposition of martial
law in December, also called for disruption of radio and TV
programs, establishment of Solidarity channels of com
munication including short-wave radio operators, and using
church services for "propaganda purposes," the official
