# Feminist says funds lacking

Patriarchal tolerance permitting
sexual exploitation of women must
be ended through a collective, in
ternational women's effort, said
Brandeis sociology instructor Kathy
Barry last night before a primarily
female audience of 75 people in
Kresge Auditorium.
This cultural relativism "has a past
history of being hands off on what is
deemed unique and essential to a
culture . . . But this allows for some
fundamental denials of human
rights," she said.
Barry said feminist groups seeking
to end female sexual exploitation on
some kind of international level have
lacked funding from other human
rights organizations, such as Amnesty
International. Present cultural rela
tivism has only permitted in
terference when instances such as in
ternational kidnap for forced prosti
tution, what she termed "sexual
slavery," become a blatant violation
of human rights.
Barry defined female sexual slavery
as "any situation a woman is in, re
gardless of how she got in, where she
is sexually and physically abused."
She cited the forced prostitution of
Linda Lovelace for pornography and
the abduction for revolutionary use
of San Francisco heiress Patricia

Hearst as examples.
But with financial support of the
Dutch government, Barry said she
and 29 other feminists from all re
gions of the world will meet next fall
in Europe to set up an international
network for the control of female
sexual slavery.
"This network will show how to ap
proach these problems (of interna
tional sexual explotation of women).
We will not accept these violations
any longer in order to protect patri
archal power," she said.
She said it is not the motive of radi
cal feminists to absorb or ignore di
versity among women and their cul
tures but to approach this diversity
with an increased sensitivity.
Human rights organizations will be
surprised to discover, she said, the
feminist attitudes of delegates to the
organizational convention with re
gard to practices of female sexual ex
ploitation in their own countries.
Delegates will represent feminist at
titudes in nations that include India,
Egypt, Japan and other nations not
usually considered strongholds of
feminism.
"Feminist organizations were
viewed as a major factor in the
change in the status of women (at the
World Conference on Women 1980)
in Copenhagen," she said, "but there

has been no organization at the in
ternational level to raise the issues
that are really the issues of sexual pol
itics. There has only been a grass
roots kind of organization."
She said the network will give
feminists the means to cross cultural
divisions and national boundaries to
go beyond the notion of cultural rel
ativism.
"It will be on a level of compassion
that we will come to understand the
diversity of women, to understand
the experience on an experiential
basis with respect to the situation .
this will be the glue of international
feminism," she said.
