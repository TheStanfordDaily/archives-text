## Kurds in Iraq resume anti-state actions 
### Washington Post 
Paris â€” Proclaiming allegiance to a
broad new opposition front, Iraqi Kurds
are seeking to resume their uprising
against the Baghdad government after
more than six years of relative submission,
according to reliable reports from the
area.
The unrest, in several areas of northern
Iraq, reflects in part a weakening of Iraqi
army control because of the need to assign
forces to other regions for the 15-month
old war with Iran. The reports, reaching
here from front leaders, say the front has
been encouraged by fresh military and fi
nancial aid from Syria and Iran along with
better organization by the still-shaky coali
tion, which groups Kurds, dissident
Baathists, dissident Iraqi army officers and
Shiite Moslem religious leaders.
A European diplomatic source, confirm
ing the substance of the reports, said Iraqi
army control diminished sharply this fall in
northern Iraqi Kurdistan, becoming lim
ited to the region's major towns and roads
at night. Most fighting occurs during am
bushes on Iraqi army patrols by newly-re
armed Kurdish Pesh Merga rebel forces,
although winter weather in the moun
tainous northern region has forced a
slowdown in recent weeks, a front leader

reported.
The diplomat said it is too early to pre
dict whether the renewed uprising will
evolve into another major problem for
President Saddam Hussein, who has en
countered increasing difficulty in the un
exepctedly long war with Iran. In any case,
it already is an unwelcome harassment at a
time when Iraqi forces have suffered sev
eral reversals in the fight against Iran, they
said.
The opposition grouping has named
itself the Iraqi Front of Revolutionary, Is
lamic and National Forces. It was formed
last July in Damascus with the proclaimed
goal of toppling Saddam Hussein and re
placing him with a government pledged to
democratic freedoms, including local au
tonomy for Iraqi Kurds.
The front's emergence appears to mark
the most successful attempt so far to end
the long history of disputes between vari
ous Iraqi rebel groups based in Damascus
but unable to join forces effectively against
their common enemy. Despite a joint
charter and close cooperation on the
ground, however, political differences still
trouble the front's disparate groups, which
range from secular Baathists to fundamen
talist Shiite mullahs.
"There are problems," acknowledged a

front leader in an interview here.
Key linkages
The grouping nevertheless establishes,
for the first time since the Kurdish uprising
was crushed in March 1975, effective links
between major Kurdish rebel groups (with
a combined fighting force of about 5000)
and Saddam Hussein's political opponents
with access to Syrian or Iranian backing. In
addition, it has resulted in agreement on
an overall military commander to coordi
nate operations and supplies from Iran and
Syria, he said.
Participation of the commander, Gen.
Hassan Mustafa Naqib, was regarded as a
crucial asset, the front leader said. The
Iraqi officer was part of the July 1958 revo
lution that overthrew the Iraqi monarchy
and had been assistant chief of staff in
Baghdad and Iraqi ambassador to Spain
and Sweden before becoming an exile in
1978. He was said to be running a com
mand center near the Iranian border.
The most effective aid comes from Syria,
the front official said, because Iran's center
is too distant and itself embroiled. At the
same time, Iranian army officers provide
some arms, allow border crossings and al
low a rebel broadcast station to beam anti
government programs from Iranian soil,
he added.
