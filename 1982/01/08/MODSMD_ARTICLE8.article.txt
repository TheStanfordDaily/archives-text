# Pentacostalists in U.S. embassy protest
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — Two Soviet wom
en who have lived in the Amer
ican Embassy compound here
for 3 1 /2 years, in hopes of emi
grating to the United States,
have started a hunger strike to
press their demands.
The action appears to esca
late a seemingly insoluble
problem into an acute diplo
matic and moral issue for the
Reagan administration.
Augustina Vashchenko and
her daughter, Lydia, who
started the protest on Dec. 28,
are among seven Pen
tecostalists who raced past So
viet police guards into the
American Embassy on June 27,
1978.
The seven have been holed
up ever since in a basement
room that measures 20 by 12
feet, and have been fed at U.S.
expense. They include Pyotr
and Augustina Vashchenko
and their three adult daugh
ters, and a mother and son,
Mariya and Timofey
Chmykhalov. All have been
holding out for guarantees of
emigration fortheirentire fam
ilies.

The Vashcenkos have 13 chil
dren, most of them still in their
native mining town of
Chernogorsk. Mariya
Chmykhalov's husband also
lives in Chernogorsk. The total
amount of relatives involved in
the two families is 22.
Vashchenko and her daugh
ter said they would continue to
take only tea and fruit juices
until their problem is finally
"resolved." They have told
American officials that they
would refuse to be hospi
talized in a Soviet institution.
Officials quoted an embassy
physician as confirming that
the fast has begun to show its
effects on the two women.
Their situation was not de
scribed as serious, however.
The Russians have refused so
far to provide advance as
surances that the families,
which say they want to emi
grate because of religious per
secution in the Soviet Union,
would in fact be allowed to
leave.
While the United States can
hardly turn these refugees out
into the street, it had been hop
ing that the seven would leave

voluntarily.
The hunger strike, however,
brings the issue to a head. The
two Vashchenkos said that
President Ronald Reagan had
appealed personally to Soviet
President Leonid Brezhnev re
cently to yield to emigration
demands that led nuclear

phsicist Andrei Sakharov and
his wife to stage a 17-day hun
ger strike. Reagan "should do
the same for us," Lydia
Vashchenko said.
She continued: "We have
been trying to leave the coun
try for 21 years and the Ameri
cans have not helped us at all.
The hunger strike is like a kick
in the pants of the Americans

'We have been trying to leave the country
tor 21 years... the hunger strike is like a
kick in the pants ot the Americans who
think that what we are doing is stupid and
that we are fanatics/
— Lydia Vashchenko

who think that what we are
doing is stupid and that we are
fanatics."
Her mother said: "The
Americanssay thatthe Russians
must decide the issue, but we
do not really know who or
what is holding us here."

Soviet authorities have in
sisted that the refugees must
return to their native town and
apply for emigration.
Mariya Chmykalov's hus
band was reported to have
traveled to Moscow Wednes
day and was said to have shown
up in front of the embassy ac
companied by unknown men
who offered to escort
Chmykalov to the Soviet
passport office and pledged
that she would be able to re
turn to her embassy refuge.
Chmykalov was said to have
agreed to accompany the men
but changed her mind at the
last minute as she was about tp
leave U.S. territory.
Warren Zimmerman, deputy
chief of mission at the embassy,
yesterday morning conferred
with the two protestors in an
effort to persuade them tp
abandon their hunger strike.
He apparently was not suc
cessful since senior officials
said later that they were sad
dened by the whole incident.!
The American Embassy does
not have adequate medical fa
cilities to treat the two women
should their condition deterio
rate sharply. The mission will
then have to make the decisiofi
whether to take them to a Sovi
et hospital despite their ad
vance notice that they would
refuse such action.
The seven Pentecostals have

become familiar figures in the
embassy compounds. The
Vashchenkos first attempted to
enter the U.S. Embassy in 1968.
They were prevented by Soviet
police and two family members
were subsequently sentenced
to three years in a labor camp.
