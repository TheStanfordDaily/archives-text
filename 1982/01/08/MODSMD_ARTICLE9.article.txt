Hong Kong (AP) â€” Living on borrowed time, Hong
Kong is haunted by the specter of the year 1997.
Then, Britain's lease on most of this colony will ex
pire. With 15 years to go, the issue has become the
focus of increasing anxiety here. China and Britain,
however, have said nothing.
The problem centers on the Convention of Peking
signed on June 9,1898 by the Chinese and British gov
ernments.
Under it, China leased 365 square miles of territory
to Britain for 99 years. The area, known as the New
Territories, comprises 90 percent of present-day
Hong Kong.
Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated
places in the world, with most of its 5 million people
living in the twin cities of Victoria on Hong Kong Is

land and Kowloon on the mainland.
The British government says it takes the treaty seri
ously. All crown land in the New Territories are sold
by the Hong Kong government for a period up to
three days before expiration of the lease.
The communist regime in Peking does not recog
nize the treaty, saying it was imposed on the country
at a time when China was weak. However, recently,
they have offerred assurances to businessmen here
about the colony's future.
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping told British Foreign
Secretary Lord Carrington in Peking last year that
businessmen in Hong Kong have nothing to fear re
garding the colony's future.
Both Hong Kong shipping magnate Sir Yue Kong
Pao and Lord Kadoorie, chairman of China Light and

Power Co., have expressed optimism that China will
come to an arrangement with Britain over the issue.
China Light is already discussing with authorities in
the neighboring Chinese Guanddong province for
the construction of a nuclear power plant there.
Jimmy McGregor, director of the Hong Kong
Chamber of Commerce, also envisages no changes in
the status quo after 1997.
He said there was every likelihood of Britain and
China reaching an agreement on the territory "con
sidering the high level of confidence displayed by ov
erseas investments in the colony."
One China expert at Hong Kong University, said he
expects the Chinese and British governments to sign a
document next year extending Britain's control for
another 30 years.
