ATEX is a fast-growing company founded to apply technology to solve special
problems in the graphic arts and publishing industry. In eight years, our PDP
11/34 systems have become benchmarks in the newspaper, magazine and in
plant printing markets. This success is a result of a team effort by people who
are the best in their professions. We are looking for people who will become
major contributors in the development of our future products. We seek
individuals who want an opportunity to grow and develop in a technical
environment that rewards demonstrated ability and offers continuing
challenges.
