# NATO views Polish sanctions

Brussels, Belgium (AP) —The Western alliance
plans toagain demand martial law be lifted in Po
land, but NATO foreign ministers meeting here
today are unlikely to impose any joint economic
sanctions against Warsaw or Moscow.
U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig was
scheduled to arrive here last night and meet with
his 14 NATO counterparts today to put the fin
ishing touches on a declaration aimed at restor
ing the freedoms which existed in Poland before
martial law was declared Dec. 13.
"The alliance, for the most part, has agreed
that the Soviet Union is highly responsible for
the Polish situation and is ready to say so," said a
NATO official familiar with the declaration.
"The main thing is to show that the alliance is
unified, at least on its perception of the prob
lem, and what should be done," he said
The West wants the Polish government to free
political prisoners, resume negotiations with
Solidarity and rescind martial law decrees, he
said.
The official, who asked that he not be identi
fied by name or country, said NATO am
bassadors had received assurances that Greece
would not block a strongly-worded statement,
even though the Socialist government disagrees
with the general view that the Soviet Union is to

blame for the Polish situation. Greece will be
able to abstain from the declaration if its chooses
to do so, he said.
Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
last week fired a high-ranking diplomat who
signed an anti-Soviet statement by the 10-nation
European Common Market.
The official said the ministers are unlikely to
agree on economic sanctions against the Soviet
Union or Poland. He said there is still disagree
ment between European governments and Pres
ident Ronald Reagan on that question.
On Dec. 29, Reagan announced an American
ban on the sale of high technology equipment to
the Soviet Union, which has not been joined by
other NATO countries.
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
in a BBC interview broadcast yesterday that she
believes the Common Market nations will even
tually agree on some unspecified joint action.
However, she said that action likely will not in
clude economic sanctions.
Common Market foreign ministers last week
ordered a study of the impact import sanctions
would have if member states stopped buying
from the Soviets. There is a $25 billion trade be
tween the Soviet Union and the Common Mar
ket.
