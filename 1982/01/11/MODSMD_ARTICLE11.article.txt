## LAC concerned with helping students help themselves 
### Heather Millar 
As things came down to the wire during
Dead Week last quarter, many students
found themselves complaining: "I'm
wasting my time," "I can't read my
notes!" or "I can't remember what I've
read!"

'Stanford is a competitive
place. Students who were
stars in high school get
into a class with 150 other
stars and it's tough.'
— LAC instructor Bernie
Rihn

Now that life is once again settling
down to a never-ending series of prob
lem sets and papers, the Learning As
sistance Center (LAC), located in room
123 of Meyer Library, can help to get stu
dents organized, according to LAC Direc

tor Carolyn Walker.
Through a variety of courses funded by
the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, LAC instructors help students in
areas such as time management, note-tak
ing, critical reading and writing, and peer
counseling. The LAC also sponsors a
network of over 70 tutors and offers
courses for graduate students in the
schools of Law and Education and for Uni
versity staff.
The LAC reaches as many as 2000 peo
ple a year, according to Walker.
She emphasized that the LAC is not a
remedial service and added that this is a
unique distinction among university
learning programs. "It's truly a wrong im
pression that you have to be in serious
trouble to come to the Center," said
Walker. "We pertain to problems that ef
fect everyone."
"Stanford is a competitive place," said
instructor Bernie Rihn. "Students who
were stars in high school get into a class
with 150 other stars and it's tough."
The classes offered by the LAC operate
under the ethic of self -help, according to
Rihn. "Students do what they discuss in
class," he said. When students complain

they aren't getting enough done, Rihn
has them write down everything they do
for four daysand, using this indicator, de
cide how to alter their habits. If a students
finds his notes incoherent, Rihn has the
student practice a variety of note-taking
methods.
"It's more a process of osmosis than
anything else," said junior Paul Kroner,
who has taken the critical reading and
writing class, LAC 8. "At first I consciously
used the things I had learned in the
course. But now the things I've learned
are pretty much automatic."
Rihn stresses time management as the
matrix into which all other LAC methods
are fit. "There are many predominant
problems students come to us with," said
Rihn. "But they all fit into slots of time."
Even the LAC instructors can profit
from the techniques they teach, accord
ing to intructor Joan Johnstone. "Until I
started working at the LAC I didn't really
manage my time well," said Johnstone.
"Now I've begun to realize how much
time I really have. I get my paperwork
done and I've started playing the piano
again."
The program gets rave reviews from

students as well. "The one thing I regret is
that I didn't take it earlier!," said senior
Mary Beth Arnett, who took the LAC 1
"Learning Skills" class last quarter. "I did
much better last quarter," she added.
"It works," said Rihn. "I see changes in
people." Rihn estimated when students
first come to the LAC they score 20 to 30
percent on the "Survey of Study Habit
and Attitudes" distributed by the Psy
chological Corporation in New York.
When they leave, Rihn says most students
bring up their scores by 40 percent or
more.
However, Rihn said the tutoring pro
gram might be developed more fully.
Johnstone said she would like to see more
help given to students in the areas of math
and science. The LAC now caters to stu
dents who wish to improve their reading
and writing skills.
Walker said the friendly atmosphere of
the LAC makes the program "truly en
joyable." LAC instructors take a personal
approach to their classes, said Walker.
Some classes, like the speed-reading
course, are largely self-structured. In LAC
8, students meet in a tutorial with their in
structor once a week. "Learning Skills"

students have three sessions with a peer
counselor during the course of the quar
ter.

"It's mostly just listening to people,
bouncing ideas off people," said Brian
Copple, who has been a peer counselor
for the last three years. "We help people
to help themselves."

"It works," said Rihn. "I see changes in
people." Rihn estimated when students
first come to the LAC they score 20 to 30
percent on the "Survey of Study Habit
and Attitudes" distributed by the Psy
chological Corporation in New York.
When they leave, Rihn says most students
bring up their scores by 40 percent or
more.
However, Rihn said the tutoring pro
gram might be developed more fully.
Johnstone said she would like to see more
help given to students in the areas of math
and science. The LAC now caters to stu
dents who wish to improve their reading
and writing skills.
Walker said the friendly atmosphere of
the LAC makes the program "truly en
joyable." LAC instructors take a personal
approach to their classes, said Walker.
Some classes, like the speed-reading
course, are largely self-structured. In LAC
8, students meet in a tutorial with their in
structor once a week. "Learning Skills"

students have three sessions with a peer
counselor during the course of the quar
ter.

osmosis than anything

"It's mostly just listening to people,
bouncing ideas off people," said Brian
Copple, who has been a peer counselor
for the last three years. "We help people
to help themselves."
As things came down to the wire during
Dead Week last quarter, many students
found themselves complaining: "I'm
wasting my time," "I can't read my
notes!" or "I can't remember what I've
read!"

Now that life is once again settling
down to a never-ending series of prob
lem sets and papers, the Learning As
sistance Center (LAC), located in room
123 of Meyer Library, can help to get stu
dents organized, according to LAC Direc

tor Carolyn Walker.
Through a variety of courses funded by
the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, LAC instructors help students in
areas such as time management, note-tak
ing, critical reading and writing, and peer
counseling. The LAC also sponsors a
network of over 70 tutors and offers
courses for graduate students in the
schools of Law and Education and for Uni
versity staff.
The LAC reaches as many as 2000 peo
ple a year, according to Walker.
She emphasized that the LAC is not a
remedial service and added that this is a
unique distinction among university
learning programs. "It's truly a wrong im
pression that you have to be in serious
trouble to come to the Center," said
Walker. "We pertain to problems that ef
fect everyone."
"Stanford is a competitive place," said
instructor Bernie Rihn. "Students who
were stars in high school get into a class
with 150 other stars and it's tough."
The classes offered by the LAC operate
under the ethic of self -help, according to
Rihn. "Students do what they discuss in
class," he said. When students complain

they aren't getting enough done, Rihn
has them write down everything they do
for four daysand, using this indicator, de
cide how to alter their habits. If a students
finds his notes incoherent, Rihn has the
student practice a variety of note-taking
methods.
"It's more a process of osmosis than
anything else," said junior Paul Kroner,
who has taken the critical reading and
writing class, LAC 8. "At first I consciously
used the things I had learned in the
course. But now the things I've learned
are pretty much automatic."
Rihn stresses time management as the
matrix into which all other LAC methods
are fit. "There are many predominant
problems students come to us with," said
Rihn. "But they all fit into slots of time."
Even the LAC instructors can profit
from the techniques they teach, accord
ing to intructor Joan Johnstone. "Until I
started working at the LAC I didn't really
manage my time well," said Johnstone.
"Now I've begun to realize how much
time I really have. I get my paperwork
done and I've started playing the piano
again."
The program gets rave reviews from

students as well. "The one thing I regret is
that I didn't take it earlier!," said senior
Mary Beth Arnett, who took the LAC 1
"Learning Skills" class last quarter. "I did
much better last quarter," she added.
