## Jerry Wertheim We are what we treat aliens 
### 
I have always considered illegal al
iens my pet oppressed part of hu
manity. Like any good Volvo liberal, I
stomped, shouted and nearly
dropped my tuition check in con
sternation over my pets.
I wrote proposals to solve "the il
legal alien problem." I gave
speeches, brimming with conviction
that railed against America's unfair
treatment of Haitian refugees and
Mexican nationals. I quoted Emma
Lazarus until an already tired cliche
became nauseating (Give me your
tired . . .)
But now, as they say back on the
ranches where many of those aliens
work, I done got education ... or at
least a smattering of imperfect im
perfection that allows for a more
complex examination of the illegal al
ien question.
That question, while certainly sus
ceptible to Statue of Liberty rhetoric
or long-faced statements about the
need to insulate American workers
from foreign competition, runs far
deeper than any platitude. Every al
ien who wades across the Rio Grande
or comes ashore on a Florida beach
suggests profound questions about
America's responsibility to the poor
of other nations, dwindling global re
sources, and even the validity of na
tionalism.
For some Americans, the first in
clination is to denounce restrictive
immigration policies as fundamental
ly wrong. Many, myself included,
have ancestors who emigrated from
foreign lands. There is something
counterintuitive about incarcerating
Haitian refugees, ostensibly because
they come from an economically but
not politically repressive nation, sim
ply because they came to the United
States in search of a better life. Ours
was a frontier nation, borne upon
seemingly endless tracts of land, able
to welcome wave upon wave of new
comers.
But manifest destiny is dead and

those immense tracts now team with
suburban sprawl that eats whatever
farmland is in its path. The intuitions
that make refugee camps distasteful
are partially obsolete.
They are partially obsolete because
America cannot reasonably expect to
assauge a major portion of Latin
America's economic woes by open
ing borders.
The carrying capacity of the U.S.
limits the number of people who can
live comfortably here. If we aretofol
low purely isolationist and utilitarian
reasoning, then the borders should
be choked off, the marginal carrying
capacity protected.
While we protect our own carrying
capacity, we could assist under
develped nations in protecting their
own fragile resource bases. Ap
propriate agricultural technologies
could be provided, massive birth
control programs established. On
the bottom line, this modeof reason
ing calls for a recognition of the
worlds limited resources and a con
certed effort to make those resources
benefit the greatest number.
It rejects the impractical niceties of
armchair liberalism for a determined
pragmatism; as controversial human
ecologist Garret Hardin has said,
"with distribution systems, as with in
dividual morality, good intentions
are no substitute for good per
formance.
Utilitarian reasoning has its pitfalls,
though, not the least of which is self
ishness. Though the closing of
borders and the transfer of technolo
gy seems perfectly logical, it ignores
both the cultural benefits of immi
gration and, more important, it tacit
ly implies that we have some sort of
national right to protect our relative
ly high standard of living.
The thousands who would immi
grate to the United States finally ask
whether national isolationism is cor
rect. Surely Hardin is correct, our car
rying capacity is limited. Yes, Paul

Ehrlich is right: the deep Midwestern
topsoil is washing away. But these
problems pale when compared to
those of Mexico, Haiti, the Domini
can Republic and a score of other na
tions in Central and South America.
America's duty to curb the misery of
other nations should equal her duty
to protect U.S. citizens from marginal
hardship and U.S. resources from
added strain.
If we could somehow lower our
standard of living and use the new
surplus to ease the plight of some
Latin American and Caribbean poor
then we should do so. If that process
would come about through open
borders then the fates should come
down. Ideally, we could protect
those near or at the poverty level
from housing or job displacement
while taking from the middle or up
per classes.
In a world of scarce resources, na
tional boundaries are useless and
even dangerous; indeed, survival will
require unified efforts that transcend
the limits of race and nationality. We
must start thinking of ourselves as
earthlings before we think of
ourselves as Americans.
Somehow I know nationalism will
persist until a crisis arrives: we will
continue restricting immigrationself
ishly, no global resource plan will be
instituted, misery will remain un
equally distributed. Humans will
continue to be penalized simply be
cause they live on the wrong side of a
line.
In the end, that's the way I want it
and you want it. I mean, I realize the
alien situation points to some critical
problems, but they aren't my person
al responsibility. And you know, the
snow is great at Squaw. Let's not take
the Volvo though, I hate getting mud
on my Greenpeace sticker.

work, I done got education ... or at
least a smattering of imperfect im
perfection that allows for a more
complex examination of the illegal al
ien question.
That question, while certainly sus
ceptible to Statue of Liberty rhetoric
or long-faced statements about the
need to insulate American workers
from foreign competition, runs far
deeper than any platitude. Every al
ien who wades across the Rio Grande
or comes ashore on a Florida beach
suggests profound questions about
America's responsibility to the poor
of other nations, dwindling global re
sources, and even the validity of na
tionalism.
For some Americans, the first in
clination is to denounce restrictive
immigration policies as fundamental
ly wrong. Many, myself included,
have ancestors who emigrated from
foreign lands. There is something
counterintuitive about incarcerating
Haitian refugees, ostensibly because
they come from an economically but
not politically repressive nation, sim
ply because they came to the United
States in search of a better life. Ours
was a frontier nation, borne upon
seemingly endless tracts of land, able
to welcome wave upon wave of new
comers.
But manifest destiny is dead and

those immense tracts now team with
suburban sprawl that eats whatever
farmland is in its path. The intuitions
that make refugee camps distasteful
are partially obsolete.
They are partially obsolete because
America cannot reasonably expect to
assauge a major portion of Latin
America's economic woes by open
ing borders.
The carrying capacity of the U.S.
limits the number of people who can
live comfortably here. If we aretofol
low purely isolationist and utilitarian
reasoning, then the borders should
be choked off, the marginal carrying
capacity protected.
While we protect our own carrying
capacity, we could assist under
develped nations in protecting their
own fragile resource bases. Ap
propriate agricultural technologies
could be provided, massive birth
control programs established. On
the bottom line, this modeof reason
ing calls for a recognition of the
worlds limited resources and a con
certed effort to make those resources
benefit the greatest number.
It rejects the impractical niceties of
armchair liberalism for a determined
pragmatism; as controversial human
ecologist Garret Hardin has said,
"with distribution systems, as with in
dividual morality, good intentions
are no substitute for good per
formance.
Utilitarian reasoning has its pitfalls,
though, not the least of which is self
ishness. Though the closing of
borders and the transfer of technolo
gy seems perfectly logical, it ignores
both the cultural benefits of immi
gration and, more important, it tacit
ly implies that we have some sort of
national right to protect our relative
ly high standard of living.
The thousands who would immi
grate to the United States finally ask
whether national isolationism is cor
rect. Surely Hardin is correct, our car
rying capacity is limited. Yes, Paul

Ehrlich is right: the deep Midwestern
topsoil is washing away. But these
problems pale when compared to
those of Mexico, Haiti, the Domini
can Republic and a score of other na
tions in Central and South America.
America's duty to curb the misery of
other nations should equal her duty
to protect U.S. citizens from marginal
hardship and U.S. resources from
added strain.
If we could somehow lower our
standard of living and use the new
surplus to ease the plight of some
Latin American and Caribbean poor
then we should do so. If that process
would come about through open
borders then the fates should come
down. Ideally, we could protect
those near or at the poverty level
from housing or job displacement
while taking from the middle or up
per classes.
In a world of scarce resources, na
tional boundaries are useless and
even dangerous; indeed, survival will
require unified efforts that transcend
the limits of race and nationality. We
must start thinking of ourselves as
earthlings before we think of
ourselves as Americans.
Somehow I know nationalism will
persist until a crisis arrives: we will
continue restricting immigrationself
ishly, no global resource plan will be
instituted, misery will remain un
equally distributed. Humans will
continue to be penalized simply be
cause they live on the wrong side of a
line.
In the end, that's the way I want it
and you want it. I mean, I realize the
alien situation points to some critical
problems, but they aren't my person
al responsibility. And you know, the
snow is great at Squaw. Let's not take
the Volvo though, I hate getting mud
on my Greenpeace sticker.

I have always considered illegal al
iens my pet oppressed part of hu
manity. Like any good Volvo liberal, I
stomped, shouted and nearly
dropped my tuition check in con
sternation over my pets.
I wrote proposals to solve "the il
legal alien problem." I gave
speeches, brimming with conviction
that railed against America's unfair
treatment of Haitian refugees and
Mexican nationals. I quoted Emma
Lazarus until an already tired cliche
became nauseating (Give me your
tired . . .)
