## Study abroad worth any price 
### 
It is certainly possible to attain a
fine education at Stanford, however,
in order to attain the true worth of a
Stanford education one must go out
side the limits of Palo Alto and into
the mythical land of "Overseas Stud
ies." (And at these prices anything
less than the true worth is not worth
it.)
For any student who desires to
compliment his education it is im
perative to take advantage of Stan
ford's Overseas program — one of
the best programs in the country. It
does not matter where one goes —
just go. You won't be sorry.
At some time in our lives we all
must immerse ourselves in a foreign
culture where we can view the Unit
ed States through a foreign eye, and
take the time to learn about
ourselves and our values. These ex
periences, although always impor
tant, are undeniably more beneficial
when undertaken as a student while
still impressionable, eager, and will
ing.
Students are in a position to enjoy
the subtle moments of Europe such
as sipping an afternoon espresso in
Italy while waiting for the stores to
open, arguing with the French in
their native tongue, or trying to de
cipher your own language as uttered
by an Englishman from the country.
On a hurried vacation in a later
stage of life these little pleasures
often turn into moments of frustra
tion.
Moreover, it is not possible to ap
preciate truly a country and its cul
ture in a short vacation. In order to
learn a particular language or an ap
preciation for a culture one must live
in a country. Cn a short visit, few
people bother to visit the small towns
or the countryside which often com
prise the most enjoyable and authen
tic part of a country.
An equally important reason for
going overseas is the opportunity to
learn about the United States.
Locked safely within our national
confines our world status and sophis
tication are easily misperceived.

However, looking from afar one can
understand and appreciate our im
mense power and advanced society.
In Europe there is a general feeling
of impotency because everything the
European nations do is dependent
on the United States, and, more im
portantly, every move the United
States makes drastically influences all
other nations.
A girl I met from Finland first
brought this idea to my attention
when she told me of our importance
and influence in Finland. I was a bit
surprised considering I did not even
know where Finland was, and yet I
began to understand how other na
tions must feel about our power
which simply dwarfs all other na
tions.
In a different perspective, many of
the things we take for granted at
home such as hot showers and our
considerably free and more liberal
nation become more treasured after
they are missing for awhile. A certain
appreciation and respect, as well as a
better understanding, is gained over
seas.
There is also a personal reason
which justifies all the schedule-shuf
fling and extra expenses that are in
volved in going overseas, and that is
to learn about ourselves.
Living abroad, thousands of miles
from home where parents are no
longer accessible even by phone,
fosters an ambivalent feeling of inde
pendence and insufficiency. For the
first time one must confront difficult
language and cultural barriers. You
also learn to trust people while being
skeptical, and to make decisions
often based on imperfect knowl
edge. It is almost like living in the real
world.
But overseas, where school is ad
mittedly easier, the time exists to be
alone whether it is travelling or just
walking inthe country ona misty day.
The time we spend alone is particu
larly important for students when
change is still a reality and our inner
thoughts are still important.
And regardless of whether one is

conscious of the change, everyone
returns a little bit different. No, we
do not all come back in the spirit of
Johnathan Livingston Seagull or even
Marco Polo, but change we will.
It is odd, when I arrived in Florence
for my quarter overseas I was desper
ately homesick and now that I am
home, I am homesick once again,
only this time it is for a different
home. It is hard to express properly
the feeling of satisfaction and the ex
tent of the learning experience that is
attained from going overseas.
But where else can one learn about
other parts of the world, the United
States, and oneself, while traveling
and having a lot of fun?
That may not sound much like the
Stanford you know, but it exists. All I
can say is if you have ever considered
going overseas, or even if you
haven't, no matter how tight your
schedule may be — Go! It will proba
bly be the best experience you will
have in college, and it is certainly the
best bargain you will find at Stanford.

States makes drastically influences all
other nations.
A girl I met from Finland first
brought this idea to my attention
when she told me of our importance
and influence in Finland. I was a bit
surprised considering I did not even
know where Finland was, and yet I
began to understand how other na
tions must feel about our power
which simply dwarfs all other na
tions.
In a different perspective, many of
the things we take for granted at
home such as hot showers and our
considerably free and more liberal
nation become more treasured after
they are missing for awhile. A certain
appreciation and respect, as well as a
better understanding, is gained over
seas.
There is also a personal reason
which justifies all the schedule-shuf
fling and extra expenses that are in
volved in going overseas, and that is
to learn about ourselves.
Living abroad, thousands of miles
from home where parents are no
longer accessible even by phone,
fosters an ambivalent feeling of inde
pendence and insufficiency. For the
first time one must confront difficult
language and cultural barriers. You
also learn to trust people while being
skeptical, and to make decisions
often based on imperfect knowl
edge. It is almost like living in the real
world.
But overseas, where school is ad
mittedly easier, the time exists to be
alone whether it is travelling or just
walking inthe country ona misty day.
The time we spend alone is particu
larly important for students when
change is still a reality and our inner
thoughts are still important.
And regardless of whether one is

conscious of the change, everyone
returns a little bit different. No, we
do not all come back in the spirit of
Johnathan Livingston Seagull or even
Marco Polo, but change we will.
It is odd, when I arrived in Florence
for my quarter overseas I was desper
ately homesick and now that I am
home, I am homesick once again,
only this time it is for a different
home. It is hard to express properly
the feeling of satisfaction and the ex
tent of the learning experience that is
attained from going overseas.
But where else can one learn about
other parts of the world, the United
States, and oneself, while traveling
and having a lot of fun?
That may not sound much like the
Stanford you know, but it exists. All I
can say is if you have ever considered
going overseas, or even if you
haven't, no matter how tight your
schedule may be — Go! It will proba
bly be the best experience you will
have in college, and it is certainly the
best bargain you will find at Stanford.

It is certainly possible to attain a
fine education at Stanford, however,
in order to attain the true worth of a
Stanford education one must go out
side the limits of Palo Alto and into
the mythical land of "Overseas Stud
ies." (And at these prices anything
less than the true worth is not worth
it.)
For any student who desires to
compliment his education it is im
perative to take advantage of Stan
ford's Overseas program — one of
the best programs in the country. It
does not matter where one goes —
just go. You won't be sorry.
At some time in our lives we all
must immerse ourselves in a foreign
culture where we can view the Unit
ed States through a foreign eye, and
take the time to learn about
ourselves and our values. These ex
periences, although always impor
tant, are undeniably more beneficial
when undertaken as a student while
still impressionable, eager, and will
ing.
Students are in a position to enjoy
the subtle moments of Europe such
as sipping an afternoon espresso in
Italy while waiting for the stores to
open, arguing with the French in
their native tongue, or trying to de
cipher your own language as uttered
by an Englishman from the country.
On a hurried vacation in a later
stage of life these little pleasures
often turn into moments of frustra
tion.
Moreover, it is not possible to ap
preciate truly a country and its cul
ture in a short vacation. In order to
learn a particular language or an ap
preciation for a culture one must live
in a country. Cn a short visit, few
people bother to visit the small towns
or the countryside which often com
prise the most enjoyable and authen
tic part of a country.
An equally important reason for
going overseas is the opportunity to
learn about the United States.
Locked safely within our national
confines our world status and sophis
tication are easily misperceived.

However, looking from afar one can
understand and appreciate our im
mense power and advanced society.
In Europe there is a general feeling
of impotency because everything the
European nations do is dependent
on the United States, and, more im
portantly, every move the United
States makes drastically influences all
other nations.
