## Publicity, work might better COP 
### 
Dedication, perserverance, hard work, and attention
to procedure certainly constitute prerequisites for effec
tive governance. However, these attributes alone do not
guarantee inspired or creative leadership.
Sincere and successful public service requires a sense
of vision, a desire for accomplishment, a predisposition
towards activism, the enunciation of worthy goals, the
tapping of constituent opinion and resources, and the
imaginative communication of the goings-on of the gov
ernment.
After a quarter in office, the incumbent Council of
Presidents (COP) has demonstrated that these latter
qualities are characteristics they conspicuously lack.
Public relations is one visible shortcoming of the pres
ent administration. One must assume that since the COP
is rarely mentioned in the Daily, it is accomplishing little
that is newsworthy. Few freshmen know what the COP is,
or what it does (although Mariann Byerwalter should be
commended for her much-maligned lone attempt to
bridge this gap by simultaneously serving as a COP mem
ber and as an R.A. in Branner).
There has been no systematic campaign to publicize
the many useful services the ASSU provides (short of a
premature "Harvest" which not only cost the students
money for tickets but was too early in the year. It did not
have much impact on frosh, for they were already del
uged bythe reamsof informational material churned out
by the University).
Such an all-out publicity blitz advertising the ASSU's
services and soliciting suggestions on the expansion of
services would have a tremendously salutary effect. It
would increase student's knowledge of the ASSU, in
form them of opportunities for involvement, and open
the operations of the ASSU to constructive discussion.
This year's COP seems content to grease the wheels of
the rusty machinery of the ASSU, doing little more than
preserving the status quo. The presidents' lack of com
mitment to representation of the student body is il
lustrated by the fact that in last April's election, the mem
bers did not bother to campaign door-to-door.
As a result of both that and to student apathy with their
cause, a joke slate sponsored by the Chapparal came
close to tying them. Although the presidents do repre
sent students on various administrative bodies, such as
the Undergraduate Cabinet and the Faculty Senate,
there is no systematic method of assessing student opin
ion. The opinions they expresson University committees
can be none other than their own.
Do the presidents ever have news conferences, in
which they are queried by Daily staffers about how they
are meeting their responsibilities? No. Have they estab
lished any broad objectives for the year? None that the
student body is aware of.
Do they seek to expand the achievements of Dick But
terfield, ef al. in bringing more of Tresidder Union under
student control? No, despite the fact that Stanford has
one of the only non-student operated "student" unions
in the nation.
Of course, many of these defects are institutionally in

evitable. Constitutionally, the COP serves as an adminis
trative organ, charged with the coordination of day-to
day functions of the ASSU. Bureaucratic in function, the
COP probably would find it difficult to escape a conser
vative, laissez-faire approach. Furthermore, the minor
"perqs" of dealing with major University officials en
courage presidents to "play" the administration's
"game," in order to retain the confidence of President
Donald Kennedy, Dean of Student Affairs Jim Lyons, or
Tresidder Director Ellie Oppenheim. Nevertheless, the
fact that the COP also serves as the executive of the ASSU
should empower it with enough independence to em
bark upon some useful, new, exciting projects that will
serve student needs.
The failure of the COP in years past to project the im
age that being a president was rewarding, worthwhile,
and adventurous is reflected in the number of people
who decide to run for the post.
Two years ago, the Butterfield slate won by a landslide
in a race with only one other team running. Last year,
only five or six serious candidates expressed interest in
four positions.
And through political manipulation, discussions remi
niscent of smoke-filled rooms from the days of Warren
Harding, and bad-mouthing, outgoing Councils of Presi
dents actively participate in the selection and grooming
of "pet" slates. Last year's COP's concern with the "qual
ity" of prospective candidates caused at least one of
them to consider running for re-election on a new slate.
Thank heaven for little favors.
The one bright spot in the ASSU this year is the
diligent, competent and conscientious work of the Sen
ate. This is unquestionably the most qualified group of
students in at least four years. Their refreshing approach,
exemplified by last spring's "Friday at Frost," which was
free to the students (which ASSU Senators paid for by
selling ads), needs to be continued. Their Facul
ty/Student day, organized by Senator Rod Beckstrom,
their districting proposal sponsored by Senators jon
Blum and Andy Benn (a noteworthy first step towards in
creased accountability to students), and their expanded
Senate intern program, are impressive achievements for
autumn quarter. Given the committment of these sena
tors, as attested by their attendance levels at meetings,
the student body can look forward to an unequalled rec
ord of hard work and accomplishment, undiluted by
cynicism or excessive ego-boosting.
This is not meant to be an ad hominem attack, nor a
negative, deterministic assessment of the possibilities of
change for the ASSU presidents. The problem is largely
one of vision and image; the members are committed to
doing a good job. The presidents may be severely limited
in their grasp or conception of the possibilities of the of
fice. But by projecting a picture of lasitude (or by failing
to convey even the fact that they exist), they do not en
courage students to run for the office that is in such need
of leadership.
