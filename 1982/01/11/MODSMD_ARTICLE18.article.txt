# Commentary
## Gary Ferries A 						year of amazing sameness 
### 
It began with a fierce rattling of
sabers, as Al Haig went berserk, or
dering a demonstration nuclear blast
on Gdansk. It ended in shocked si
lence, when President Ronald Rea
gan and his entire cabinet resigned
because "our programs just don't
work and we're sorry."
In between, Jerry Lewis won the
Oscar for best actor, James Watt filled
in the Grand Canyon, and the Chica
go Cubs won the World Series.
Yes, 1982 was indeed a year full of
surprises.
But in the world of arts, there were
no surprises. As the decade develops,
it appears that the watchwords for
the '80s will be "more of the same."
With the advent of huge multi-me
dia conglomerates like Warner Com
munications and Time, Inc., art for
the sake of art has been replaced by
art for the sake of profit. Safety may
be the death of creativity, but it
almost always ensures a profit.
In light of this, the most popular
works of 1982, measured in terms of
units sold, bear a striking re
semblance to last year's winners.
Best Books ot 1982
•Garfield Gets Gassed — The inex
plicable popularity of the oafish cat
with the less than bright owner con
tinued in 1982. At one time, no less
than seven Garfield books were on
the paperback top-ten list simultane
ously. The most popular of the Gar
field collections issued in 1982, Gar
field Gets Gassed left Garfield with
only eight more lives, but his future
earning potential was undiminished.
•Billions and Billions of Stars —
Carl Sagan followed his runaway
best-seller, Cosmos, with this in
teresting departure, a novel set in
Hollywood. It is unclear what made
Sagan think he could pull this off, but
one suspects that it was the promise
of "thousands and thousands" of
dollars.
•Love's Ravishing Indifference —
Phyllis Whitney retained her crown
as the queen of the romance "nov
el." This would seem a bit of a con
tradiction, since in real life, Whitney
is a man. Ernest Schwartz, aka Phyllis
Whitney, tends a bar at a Rhode Is
land bowling alley during the day
and writes his/her romances at night.
, In this one, a beautiful young vir
gin is about to be tickled to death by a
tribe of rampaging Tartars when she
is rescued by a dashing old count
with severe halitosis. He misin
terprets her repulsion as disinterest,
while she mistakes his affections for
pedophilia.
Will true love win out? Is Barbara
Cartland old?

•Two Thousand Things A Dead Cat
and Elvis Have In Common — The
trend toward lurid biographies col
lided with the backlash to the cute
cat/preppy phenomenon and this
book was the illegitimate product of
their union. An extremely cruel
book, it features similarities which
range from the mundane to the un
printable. Yes, people buy this stuff,
but they also buy Rubik's cubes.
•Never Say Riot — A number of six
ties revolutionaries finally came in
from the cold in 1982, copping a plea,
writing a book, and joining the John
ny/Phil/Merv circuit. As Bob Dylan
might have said, it don't take a
Weatherman to see a mass of hot air.
In Never Say Riot, former Weath
er-Underground person Jane Alpert
tries to combine politics and exercise
with only mixed success. Among her
pearls of wisdom: "push-ups are

conglomerates like Warner Communications

replaced by art tor the sake ot protit.

hard to do while hiding in a closet"
and "shot-putting is excellent prac
tice for Molotov cocktail throwing."
Somewhat obscure.
•Quikbuc — The one-man horror
conglomerate, Stephen King, con
tinued to crank them out in 1982. In
Quikbuc, a pudgy adolescent sci-fi
buff is tormented by his peers until
he develops the strange ability to
write horror stories and make a lot of
money. As usual, the only likable
character dies on page 178.
•The Ramada New Jersey — In
John Irving's latest, a dancing polar
bear runs amok in a New Jersey con
vention center. The janitor and his
family have a lot of psychological
problems, which they solve by be
coming professional wrestlers.
Best Albums ot 1982
•Listen To Your Elders — The Roll
ing Stones — The Stones finally come
to grips with advancing senility.
Stand-out cuts include "Waiting For
A Bus," "Sympathy For Your Grand
parents," "Start My Pacemaker," and
"Let's Watch TV Together."
•No Escape — Journey — In this
aptly named album, the popular S.F.
band follows its usual formula with
the usual results. State of the art
A.0.R..
•Ten Cents A Dance — Willie
Nelson — This collection of old stan
dards represents Willie's latest at

tempt to cover all the musical bases.
While his belief in the validity of all
musical forms is admirable, his
choice of tunes can be somewhat dis
concerting. This is especially true
when he sings'Tm Gonna Wash That
Man Right Out Of My Hair," and
"You Are Sixteen, Going On Seven
teen." And his attempt at the aria
from "Carmen" is more laughable
than noble.
•Excess! — The Clash — This six
record set features their successive
takes of every song, offering listeners
the chance to choose the version
they like best. The sixth side is blank,
forcing listeners to use their imagina
tions. Another bold heroic effort by
"the only band that matters."
•Cynical — Olivia Newton-John —
In the most radical attempt yet to
trash her goody-goody image, Olivia
pushes her voice beyond the break-

ing point while exposing her body
beyond the point of good taste. The
jaded lyrics of the title cut, with its sly
references to "knowing each other-
Biblically" have gotten the song
banned in Utah, but not fromtheTop
Forty.
•Lather In Leather — AC/DC —
Proof, some claim, that Australian
aborigines can play rock and roll.
Others believe they're just a phase of
adolescence. Only their hairdressers
know for sure.
•Dis-tor-tion — Neil Young and
Crazy Horse — "Ain't got no ideas,
got mashed potatoes," go the lyrics
of one ten-minute song, yet Young
still manages to pull it off. Tie a few
quarters to the old tonearm and
crank it up.
•I Eat With This Mouth — Prince —
Prince continued to shock, threaten
ing to usurp Frank Zappa's place as
the dirtiest lyricist in rock.
•Stop Slobbering On Me — Pat
Benatar — The spandex pixie with
the big voice continues to demand
that she be taken seriously. The
critics continue however, to exercise
their option to refuse. The lady doth
protest too much, me thinks.
(In 1982, Gary Ferries was a graduate
student in electrical engineering. He
took up commentary writing to sup

•Two Thousand Things A Dead Cat
and Elvis Have In Common — The
trend toward lurid biographies col
lided with the backlash to the cute
cat/preppy phenomenon and this
book was the illegitimate product of
their union. An extremely cruel
book, it features similarities which
range from the mundane to the un
printable. Yes, people buy this stuff,
but they also buy Rubik's cubes.
•Never Say Riot — A number of six
ties revolutionaries finally came in
from the cold in 1982, copping a plea,
writing a book, and joining the John
ny/Phil/Merv circuit. As Bob Dylan
might have said, it don't take a
Weatherman to see a mass of hot air.
In Never Say Riot, former Weath

and "shot-putting is excellent prac
tice for Molotov cocktail throwing."
Somewhat obscure.
•Quikbuc — The one-man horror
conglomerate, Stephen King, con
tinued to crank them out in 1982. In
Quikbuc, a pudgy adolescent sci-fi
buff is tormented by his peers until
he develops the strange ability to
write horror stories and make a lot of
money. As usual, the only likable
character dies on page 178.
•The Ramada New Jersey — In
John Irving's latest, a dancing polar
bear runs amok in a New Jersey con
vention center. The janitor and his
family have a lot of psychological
problems, which they solve by be
coming professional wrestlers.
Best Albums ot 1982
•Listen To Your Elders — The Roll
ing Stones — The Stones finally come
to grips with advancing senility.
Stand-out cuts include "Waiting For
A Bus," "Sympathy For Your Grand
parents," "Start My Pacemaker," and
"Let's Watch TV Together."
•No Escape — Journey — In this
aptly named album, the popular S.F.
band follows its usual formula with
the usual results. State of the art
A.0.R..
•Ten Cents A Dance — Willie
Nelson — This collection of old stan
dards represents Willie's latest at

tempt to cover all the musical bases.
While his belief in the validity of all
musical forms is admirable, his
choice of tunes can be somewhat dis
concerting. This is especially true
when he sings'Tm Gonna Wash That
Man Right Out Of My Hair," and
"You Are Sixteen, Going On Seven
teen." And his attempt at the aria
from "Carmen" is more laughable
than noble.
•Excess! — The Clash — This six
record set features their successive
takes of every song, offering listeners
the chance to choose the version
they like best. The sixth side is blank,
forcing listeners to use their imagina
tions. Another bold heroic effort by
"the only band that matters."
•Cynical — Olivia Newton-John —
In the most radical attempt yet to
trash her goody-goody image, Olivia
pushes her voice beyond the break-

ing point while exposing her body
beyond the point of good taste. The
jaded lyrics of the title cut, with its sly
references to "knowing each other-
Biblically" have gotten the song
banned in Utah, but not fromtheTop
Forty.
•Lather In Leather — AC/DC —
Proof, some claim, that Australian
aborigines can play rock and roll.
Others believe they're just a phase of
adolescence. Only their hairdressers
know for sure.
•Dis-tor-tion — Neil Young and
Crazy Horse — "Ain't got no ideas,
got mashed potatoes," go the lyrics
of one ten-minute song, yet Young
still manages to pull it off. Tie a few
quarters to the old tonearm and
crank it up.
•I Eat With This Mouth — Prince —
Prince continued to shock, threaten
ing to usurp Frank Zappa's place as
the dirtiest lyricist in rock.
•Stop Slobbering On Me — Pat
Benatar — The spandex pixie with
the big voice continues to demand
that she be taken seriously. The
critics continue however, to exercise
their option to refuse. The lady doth
protest too much, me thinks.
(In 1982, Gary Ferries was a graduate
student in electrical engineering. He
took up commentary writing to sup
plement his income as an opinions
colunmnist.)

It began with a fierce rattling of
sabers, as Al Haig went berserk, or
dering a demonstration nuclear blast
on Gdansk. It ended in shocked si
lence, when President Ronald Rea
gan and his entire cabinet resigned
because "our programs just don't
work and we're sorry."
In between, Jerry Lewis won the
Oscar for best actor, James Watt filled
in the Grand Canyon, and the Chica
go Cubs won the World Series.
Yes, 1982 was indeed a year full of
surprises.
But in the world of arts, there were
no surprises. As the decade develops,
it appears that the watchwords for
the '80s will be "more of the same."
With the advent of huge multi-me
dia conglomerates like Warner Com
munications and Time, Inc., art for
the sake of art has been replaced by
art for the sake of profit. Safety may
be the death of creativity, but it
almost always ensures a profit.
In light of this, the most popular
works of 1982, measured in terms of
units sold, bear a striking re
semblance to last year's winners.
Best Books ot 1982
•Garfield Gets Gassed — The inex
plicable popularity of the oafish cat
with the less than bright owner con
tinued in 1982. At one time, no less
than seven Garfield books were on
the paperback top-ten list simultane
ously. The most popular of the Gar
field collections issued in 1982, Gar
field Gets Gassed left Garfield with
only eight more lives, but his future
earning potential was undiminished.
•Billions and Billions of Stars —
Carl Sagan followed his runaway
best-seller, Cosmos, with this in
teresting departure, a novel set in
Hollywood. It is unclear what made
Sagan think he could pull this off, but
one suspects that it was the promise
of "thousands and thousands" of
dollars.
•Love's Ravishing Indifference —
Phyllis Whitney retained her crown
as the queen of the romance "nov
el." This would seem a bit of a con
tradiction, since in real life, Whitney
is a man. Ernest Schwartz, aka Phyllis
Whitney, tends a bar at a Rhode Is
land bowling alley during the day
and writes his/her romances at night.
, In this one, a beautiful young vir
gin is about to be tickled to death by a
tribe of rampaging Tartars when she

tempt to cover all the musical bases.
While his belief in the validity of all
musical forms is admirable, his
choice of tunes can be somewhat dis
concerting. This is especially true
when he sings'Tm Gonna Wash That
Man Right Out Of My Hair," and
"You Are Sixteen, Going On Seven
teen." And his attempt at the aria
from "Carmen" is more laughable
than noble.
•Excess! — The Clash — This six
record set features their successive
takes of every song, offering listeners
the chance to choose the version
they like best. The sixth side is blank,
forcing listeners to use their imagina
tions. Another bold heroic effort by
"the only band that matters."
•Cynical — Olivia Newton-John —
In the most radical attempt yet to
trash her goody-goody image, Olivia
pushes her voice beyond the break-

ing point while exposing her body
beyond the point of good taste. The
jaded lyrics of the title cut, with its sly
references to "knowing each other-
Biblically" have gotten the song
banned in Utah, but not fromtheTop
Forty.
•Lather In Leather — AC/DC —
Proof, some claim, that Australian
aborigines can play rock and roll.
Others believe they're just a phase of
adolescence. Only their hairdressers
know for sure.
•Dis-tor-tion — Neil Young and
Crazy Horse — "Ain't got no ideas,
got mashed potatoes," go the lyrics
of one ten-minute song, yet Young
still manages to pull it off. Tie a few
quarters to the old tonearm and
crank it up.
•I Eat With This Mouth — Prince —
Prince continued to shock, threaten
ing to usurp Frank Zappa's place as
the dirtiest lyricist in rock.
•Stop Slobbering On Me — Pat
Benatar — The spandex pixie with
the big voice continues to demand
that she be taken seriously. The
critics continue however, to exercise
their option to refuse. The lady doth
protest too much, me thinks.
