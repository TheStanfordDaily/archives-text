Santa Clara — Ted Bruinsma, a rela
tively unknown candidate for the
U.S. Senate seat held by Republican
S.I. Hayakawa, is still awaiting word
on a complaint he filed with the Fed
eral Elections Committee (FEC) over
Governor Jerry Brown's appearances
on California talk shows.

Bruinsma filed his complaint
against Brown, the American Broad
casting Company, McClatchy Broad
casting and the Gannett Company on
Dec. 16. He claims radio stations
owned by these companies have giv
en Brown illegal corporate campaign
contributions in the form of free air
time.
"It doesn't matter that Jerry Brown
hasn't (formally) announced his can
didacy for the U.S. Senate," Bruinsma
said during a December campaign
stop in Santa Clara. "No one doubts
that he is a candidate.

"It is clear the press and the public
see (Brown's appearances on radio
shows) in connection with a federal
election," Bruinsma said.
It is generally acknowledged that
Brown is seeking the senate seat held
by Hayakawa, whose term ends this
year. Hayakawa has said he will seek
reelection.
Others seek election
Eight other Republicans also seek
Hayakawa's seat: Reps. Robert
Dornan, Barry Goldwater Jr., Pete
McCloskey and John Rousselot, state
Sen. John Schmitz, San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson and Maureen Reagan.
Candidates for the Senate's June 8
primary must file candidacy by Feb.
25. They must pay a $1213 filing fee or
submit a Senate petition with 10,000
registered voters' signatures.
Bruinsma is the first Senate can
didate to file a complaint over
Brown's radio appearances. Pre
viously, Hayakawa complained about
the radio spots to the Federal Com
munications Commission on "equal
time" provisions. But those rulesapp
ly only to officially declared can
didates.
Several appearances
Brown has appeared as a radio talk
show host — fielding questions from
listeners calling in — on KGO radio in
San Francisco, KABC radio in Los An
geles, as well as on several radio pro

grams in the Central Valley owned by
McClatchy, and a radio station in San
Diego owned by Gannett.
Bruinsma claims Brown has aver
aged 23 hours of free airtime that

sources to our credit."
In other areas, Bruinsma supports
increasing U.S. exports to foreign
countries and establishing close rela
tionships with developing countries.
Bruinsma also wants to cut gov
ernmental red tape which, he said,
beleaguers small businesses.
"Eighty percent of all new jobs
comes from small businesses,"

Bruinsma said. "These businesses are
going bankrupt because of govern
ment regulations which should be
handled in the private sector, not the
government."
would have cost approximately
$250,000 if purchased by an individ
ual for commercial messages.
Je.i lette Boudreau, a producer of
KO9 radio, Brown's appearance
was related to his role as governor,
not as a potential Senate candidate.
Legal training credited
Nonetheless, Bruinsma hopes to
win his FEC appeal on the grounds
that the public perceives Brown to be
a Senate candidate. He credits his ex
tensive legal training as the reason
for his being the first Senate can
didate to attempt to stop Brown's ra
dio appearances.
Bruinsma, 60, was the dean of
Loyola Law School from 1979 to 1981.
He has a degree from Harvard Busi
ness School and Harvard Law School,
has served in the Navy and has ex
tensive business experience. (He has
been president of Learjet Industries,
Systematics — a data processing
company — and Harvest Industries.)
Bruinsma's Senate campaign plat

government and business in inner
cities," Bruinsma said. "California

Santa Clara — Ted Bruinsma, a rela
tively unknown candidate for the
U.S. Senate seat held by Republican
S.I. Hayakawa, is still awaiting word
on a complaint he filed with the Fed
eral Elections Committee (FEC) over
Governor Jerry Brown's appearances
on California talk shows.

Bruinsma filed his complaint
against Brown, the American Broad
casting Company, McClatchy Broad
casting and the Gannett Company on
Dec. 16. He claims radio stations
owned by these companies have giv
en Brown illegal corporate campaign
contributions in the form of free air
time.
"It doesn't matter that Jerry Brown
hasn't (formally) announced his can
didacy for the U.S. Senate," Bruinsma
said during a December campaign
stop in Santa Clara. "No one doubts
that he is a candidate.

"It is clear the press and the public
see (Brown's appearances on radio
shows) in connection with a federal
election," Bruinsma said.
It is generally acknowledged that
Brown is seeking the senate seat held
by Hayakawa, whose term ends this
year. Hayakawa has said he will seek
reelection.
Others seek election
Eight other Republicans also seek
Hayakawa's seat: Reps. Robert
Dornan, Barry Goldwater Jr., Pete
McCloskey and John Rousselot, state
Sen. John Schmitz, San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson and Maureen Reagan.
Candidates for the Senate's June 8
primary must file candidacy by Feb.
25. They must pay a $1213 filing fee or
submit a Senate petition with 10,000
registered voters' signatures.
Bruinsma is the first Senate can
didate to file a complaint over
Brown's radio appearances. Pre
viously, Hayakawa complained about
the radio spots to the Federal Com
munications Commission on "equal
time" provisions. But those rulesapp
ly only to officially declared can
didates.
Several appearances
Brown has appeared as a radio talk
show host — fielding questions from
listeners calling in — on KGO radio in
San Francisco, KABC radio in Los An
geles, as well as on several radio pro

grams in the Central Valley owned by
McClatchy, and a radio station in San
Diego owned by Gannett.
Bruinsma claims Brown has aver
aged 23 hours of free airtime that

sources to our credit."
In other areas, Bruinsma supports
increasing U.S. exports to foreign
countries and establishing close rela
tionships with developing countries.
Bruinsma also wants to cut gov
ernmental red tape which, he said,
beleaguers small businesses.
"Eighty percent of all new jobs
comes from small businesses,"

Bruinsma said. "These businesses are
going bankrupt because of govern
ment regulations which should be
handled in the private sector, not the
government."
would have cost approximately
$250,000 if purchased by an individ
ual for commercial messages.
Je.i lette Boudreau, a producer of
KO9 radio, Brown's appearance
was related to his role as governor,
not as a potential Senate candidate.
Legal training credited
Nonetheless, Bruinsma hopes to
win his FEC appeal on the grounds
that the public perceives Brown to be
a Senate candidate. He credits his ex
tensive legal training as the reason
for his being the first Senate can
didate to attempt to stop Brown's ra
dio appearances.
Bruinsma, 60, was the dean of
Loyola Law School from 1979 to 1981.
He has a degree from Harvard Busi
ness School and Harvard Law School,
has served in the Navy and has ex
tensive business experience. (He has
been president of Learjet Industries,
Systematics — a data processing
company — and Harvest Industries.)
