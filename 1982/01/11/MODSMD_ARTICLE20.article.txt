## If the joke isn't funny, don't laugh 
### 
During the hectic exam period last
quarter, I found myself drawn to see
professors for academic advice out of
necessity, despite my disinclination
generally to speak with them.
Like most students in such situ
ations, I am inevitably confronted by
the idiot wind known as faculty jokes.
The real problem with faculty jokes
is that when students find themselves
the recipients of such a joke, they
have no choice except to politely
laugh.
Thus professors keep repeating the
same bad jokes year after year, over
and over again, because they're con
vinced they're the most clever ones
in their department.
Once, several years ago, I decided
to use a certain sort of academic hon
esty and to laugh only when I was tru
ly amused. The professor of my semi
nar made witticism after witticism
while I sat there with a straight face.
Later, a co-student of mine told me
that the professor had privately con
fessed that he didn't like our class,
because we didn't appreciate his
sense of humor.
I felt certain that forced laughter
would be detectable but nonethe
less, in the next class period, de
liberately guffawed the first time
Prof. X made a wisecrack. Since I was

the only one in the room who
laughed, everyone turned their
heads to give me that sort of stare
which meant, "Is he all right?"
Subsequently, I reverted to my
deadpan strategy, and received a "c"
in the class.

One professor told
me about five or ten
jokes within the span
ot a ten minute visit to
his office.

One professor told me about five
or ten jokes within the span of a ten
minute visit to his office. All of them
were decidedly not funny. Yet like
many students, I politely produced a
chuckle. My reward — more such
jokes.
Students in the sciences have
proved more honest in their ability to
give professors feedback on their
jokes and thus spare future classes
that particular sort of torture. In a
physics class I took students"booed"
a professor each time he unsuc
cessfully attempted a joke.
I approve of such behavior
becuase it confirms what I have long
feared — that the faculty here is there

not to teach but to entertain.
Why not require, then, give each
professor a fifteen minute turn on an
open microphone in Kresge? Stu
dents' response could dictate which
things are and aren't funny and profs
could incorporate the feedback
within their lectures. Moreover, stu
dentscould bring tomatoes to Kresge
comedy show, and this would pro
vide an additional gauge by which
students could choose their classes.
Students would know that profs
with tomato stains on their clothes
probably are not funny, and can take
someone else's class instead.
Students could then judge profs on
the basis of such criteria as timing, or
iginality and clarity of presentation.
Those students who feel that such a
show has no place in a serious aca
demic institution like Stanford could
take their act elsewhere.
If the program proves successful,
the professors could all be replaced
by professional comedians. * Steve
Martin, for example, might serve as
an ASSU guest professor while Lily
Tomlin is certainly funnier than any
one in the philosophy department.
Then we could get some real
laughs.
