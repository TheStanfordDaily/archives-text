## 'Videozation' is fun, but remember that real world exists too 
### 
Washington — America is unwit
tingly surrendering to "Mr. Blip and
Mr. Bong."
These two characters, who stand
for the Great American Video Game,
have been moving their battle for the
nation's leisure-time attention from
the sidewalk arcades to humble
American homes. Their victory
seems assured.
This holiday buying season has
hardly been full of good cheer for re
tailers. But video games are finding a
niche in thousands of household gift
budgets. And yet the delirium over
computerized games didn't end Dec.
25: Industry analysts estimate that the
number of video-gaming house
holds will jump from two million to
five million during 1982.

Some might say that video games,
like air hockey tables and suitcase
sized tape players, will fall out of fash
ion.
Yet the video game is not just any
amusement. With a television in
almost every U.S. home, it stands to
become an outright alternative to
network programming. Moreover, as
long as computer programmers de
vise new ways to puzzle players, their
games will probably never prove bor
ing.
So far, the "videozation" of the
household has been lauded. Forone,
it's helped parents steer their chil
dren away from less seemly arcades
to the more-controlled livingroom
atmosphere. It's also helped make
computer technology somewhat ex

citing and useful to the layman.
Video game-makers are quick to
applaud the active nature of their
products, pointing to the number of
potential players and ever-increasing
list of available game cartridges.
And then there are the clinical
benefits. William Lynch, who has
used video games to treat patients at
a Veterans Administration hospital in
Palo Alto, told us how games such as
"Pong," one of the originals, have
helped improve patients' peripheral
vision and hand-eye coordination.
Lynch also hastens to reaffirm what
other psychologists have suggested:
that speed and finesse at electronic
baseball, "Asteroids," and "Pac-
Man" can enhance the self-esteem
of players who are otherwise athletic

or social misfits.
Indeed, quite a few of our contem
poraries — many of them serious
professionals and business people —
have succumbed to the powers of
Blip and Bong. While they haven't
lost their jobs as a result, they've let
the video game become among their
best and most demanding friends.
Video games can be as habit-forming
as shooting craps but still lack the
negative connotations of gambling.
Unfortunately, the video game
may bring out the worst of our gener
ation's self-absorbing tendencies.
For the many among us who, after a
hard day's work, seek ever-increas
ing levels of stimulation and self-ag
grandizement, it has nearly narcotic
qualities, for which there are no

known controls other than pulling
the plug.
Where social interplay is con
cerned, the video-game's benefits
may be double-edged. One's
fascination with conquering the ma
chine might lower one's tolerance
for personal contact and serve as a
substitute for the frivolity that makes
us human — and them machines.
Anyone who's played Atari's
"Asteroids" understands that noth
ing less than a no-holds-barred ap
proach to the game is required.
Similar "toys" cause similar in
versions. The Sony "Walkman," one
of the many hi-fi, pocket-sized tape
players, does an equally good job of
blotting out earthly concerns. Col
lectively, such cheap escapes could

eventually lead to detached behavior
in ourselves and our children.
We won't squabble with
purchasers who sense the dangers as
well as the benefits of this year's most
wanted gift. If played with clinical
temperance, the new games could
help instill self-doubters with feel
ings of success, bring our households
closer together and build computer
literacy.
But since most homes aren't run
like clinics, even the most sophisti
cated among us should understand
the powers of Mr. Blip and Mr. Bong
before these two gamesters start
playing with them.

Washington — America is unwit
tingly surrendering to "Mr. Blip and
Mr. Bong."
These two characters, who stand
for the Great American Video Game,
have been moving their battle for the
nation's leisure-time attention from
the sidewalk arcades to humble
American homes. Their victory
seems assured.
This holiday buying season has
hardly been full of good cheer for re
tailers. But video games are finding a
niche in thousands of household gift
budgets. And yet the delirium over
computerized games didn't end Dec.
25: Industry analysts estimate that the
number of video-gaming house
holds will jump from two million to
five million during 1982.

Some might say that video games,
like air hockey tables and suitcase
sized tape players, will fall out of fash
ion.
Yet the video game is not just any
amusement. With a television in
almost every U.S. home, it stands to
become an outright alternative to
network programming. Moreover, as
long as computer programmers de
vise new ways to puzzle players, their
games will probably never prove bor
ing.
So far, the "videozation" of the
household has been lauded. Forone,
it's helped parents steer their chil
dren away from less seemly arcades
to the more-controlled livingroom
atmosphere. It's also helped make
computer technology somewhat ex

citing and useful to the layman.
Video game-makers are quick to
applaud the active nature of their
products, pointing to the number of
potential players and ever-increasing
list of available game cartridges.
And then there are the clinical
benefits. William Lynch, who has
used video games to treat patients at
a Veterans Administration hospital in
Palo Alto, told us how games such as
"Pong," one of the originals, have
helped improve patients' peripheral
vision and hand-eye coordination.
Lynch also hastens to reaffirm what
other psychologists have suggested:
that speed and finesse at electronic
baseball, "Asteroids," and "Pac-
Man" can enhance the self-esteem
of players who are otherwise athletic

or social misfits.
Indeed, quite a few of our contem
poraries — many of them serious
professionals and business people —
have succumbed to the powers of
Blip and Bong. While they haven't
lost their jobs as a result, they've let
the video game become among their
best and most demanding friends.

as shooting craps but still lack the
