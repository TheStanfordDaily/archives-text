# Commentary/John Halamka
## Guilty of penultimate offense 
### 
Last week I was booked for
possession. I didn't mean to do it; it's
a disease, an incurable mania . . .
Stopped on thestreet by plainclothes
detectives, I was found with three
arid a half kilos of Bic pens in the bot
tom of my pack. I told the thugs that
I'd never seen the pens before in my
life.
They took me down to the station
and lined me up on the wall. I looked
out at the audience. My destiny lay in
the words of 25 accusers, staring at
the line-up I was in. First the Book
store Clerk, "Him, that's him. He
asked me if he could borrow a pen to
write a check. Well sir, that was the
last day I saw my Bic." She pointed
down the center of my vision as a
sickening feeling filled my stomach.
Nivens was next, "Yeah, that face,
that diabolical look, the kind that we
need to chain pens to the counters
for. I remember the little twerp, writ
ing a check, putting the pen in his
pocket then running out of the store,
dragging the chain next to his over
stuffed blue backpack." I stood ac
cused. Not even Joseph K. could
have had it this bad.
I was innocent, I pleaded. They

dumped the evidence on the desk.
There were reds, blues, greens, and
blacks. There were felt tips, hard
points, rolling writers, and the hor
rible brown ones, marked "Office
Property-do not remove."
Could I plead insanity? Could I
plead ignorance? OK, so a few times
I've caught myself asking to borrow a
pen to write a check, sign a Credit
Card receipt, or take notes and
walked off with it, grasping it proudly
in my right hand. It's subconscious.
We all do it. I'm a pen pilferer, I'm
chronic, I need help.
They looked at me with a twisted
glare. Kleptomania, no; too extreme
for my PENultimate disease. I broke
down. I'm the guy they chain the
pens to counters for, I'm the guy they
make "Office Property-Do Not Re
move" pens for, I'm the guy with pen
stains on my shirts from forgetting to
put the caps on. So I go through a few
hundred pens a week, borrowing,
losing, dropping, sinking into the
black hole I carry on my back.
Yet, all was not lost. I glanced at my
interlocutor: at last, my long lost
Schaeffer I used weeks ago signing
for my parking permit. Pentel to the

right of me, Parker to the left of me; I
knew a Stanford student could do no
wrong.
I was let off with a suspended sen
tence and a warning. I'm down to
number two pencils now, with
monogrammed erasers to be really
sure. Still though, when I walk
around campus, the logistics of the
problem really startle me. How many
pens have disappeared from their
rightful owners? How many pilfered
Parkers and borrowed Bics covered
the face of White Plaza?
Are we becoming a nation where
man is not entitled to life, liberty and
the pursuit of an ultra fine roll
ingwriter? Pens are inherently free,
yet everywhere on chains.
Think twice before you finish writ
ing that next check, that pen may
belong on the counter, not leaking in
your pocket. Consider your future,
check the bottom of your pack,
check your dresser drawers, check
your neighbor's desk drawers. The
future of Western Civilization may
depend on it.

Schaeffer I used weeks ago signing
for my parking permit. Pentel to the

right of me, Parker to the left of me; I
knew a Stanford student could do no
wrong.
I was let off with a suspended sen
tence and a warning. I'm down to
number two pencils now, with
monogrammed erasers to be really
sure. Still though, when I walk
around campus, the logistics of the
problem really startle me. How many
pens have disappeared from their
rightful owners? How many pilfered
Parkers and borrowed Bics covered
the face of White Plaza?
Are we becoming a nation where
man is not entitled to life, liberty and
the pursuit of an ultra fine roll
ingwriter? Pens are inherently free,
yet everywhere on chains.
Think twice before you finish writ
ing that next check, that pen may
belong on the counter, not leaking in
your pocket. Consider your future,
check the bottom of your pack,
check your dresser drawers, check
your neighbor's desk drawers. The
future of Western Civilization may
depend on it.
