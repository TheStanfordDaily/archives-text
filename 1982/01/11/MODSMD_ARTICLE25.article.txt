New York — The dismissal of
an antitrust suit against IBM,
coupled with a settlement that
will break up AT&T, ends an era
that saw the government large
ly fail in efforts to restructure
major industries.
Beginning in the late 19605,
the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission set
out to break up dominant firms
in industries ranging from oil to
breakfast cereals.
"It looked like a very signifi
cant challenge," said Harvey
Goldschmid, a law professor at
Columbia University.
Encouraged by the apparent
trend, numerous private suits
were filed by small competitors
against such dominant com
panies as International Businss
Machines Corp., Xerox Corp.
and Eastman Kodak Co.
Now all the government's
cases have been settled or dis
missed, with the dominant
companies winning in every
case except American Tele
phone & Telegraph Co. and
generally prevailing in private
cases.
"In terms of the bottom line,
these cases have produced a
very limited return," said Gold
schmid after Friday's actions
were announced.
At the heart of the cases was

the government's attitude
toward domination of an in
dustry by one company or a
handful of companies, particu
larly if that domination was ac
quired legally.
Court decisions starting in
the mid-1940s and continuing
through the 1960s held that a
company with monopoly
power could take few actions
to protect that position without
running afoul of the antitrust
laws.
In one case, Alcoa's
monopoly in aluminum, which
had been obtained through a
patented process and sus
tained through techniques that
a lower court said were normal
business practices, was ruled il
legal.
The idea was that normal
practices, such as price cutting
or building new plants to meet
anticipated demand, might be
reasonable in a competitive in
dustry but could be used to
drive competitors out of busi
ness or keep them from enter
ing if used by a monopoly.
But beginning in the 19705,
the courts moved away from
that position, particularly in a
case involving Kodak and
Berkey Photo, a small com
petitor. Berkey lost most major
issues on appeal.

Assistant Attorney General
William Baxter, the head of the
antitrust division, cited the
Berkey casein droppingthe 12-
year-old suit against IBM: "You
can't bring (the antitrust laws)
to bear against a company just
because it is large, successful,
and captures a very big market
share."
"There's far more freedom
now for a company, once it ob
tains a monopoly, to defend
that position," said
Georgetown University pro
fessor Robert Pitofsky, who ap
proved of the move away from
the Alcoa decision but feared
the administration may have
gone too far.
"Bigness is an opportunity
for abuse," he said, "and the
same practice used by a small
company can be an abuse in
the hands of an IBM."
A major reason for the trend
away from the harsh attitude
toward monopolies was a feel
ing that antitrust action was
making American business less
competitive in international

markets.
"It's part of a realization that
we can't afford to hurt our
companies anymore," said
George Thompson, a business
professor at Columbia and co
author of a text on antitrust
law. "If IBM were severely
handicapped, they'd lose out
very rapidly to the Japanese,
who are already threatening
the computer industry."
Some think the opposite
might be true, and point to
studies indicating that most in
novations come not from big
companies but from smaller
entrepreneurs.
Neither the AT&T nor the
IBM actions set a precedent
that will be binding on future
administrations, since there
was no judicial decision.
Goldschmid said he thinks
the IBM case probably should
have been allowed to go to a
decision. But Baxter said the
appeals would have taken
years, and that the government
was all but sure to lose.

New York — The dismissal of
an antitrust suit against IBM,
coupled with a settlement that
will break up AT&T, ends an era
that saw the government large
ly fail in efforts to restructure
major industries.
Beginning in the late 19605,
the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission set
out to break up dominant firms
in industries ranging from oil to
breakfast cereals.
"It looked like a very signifi
cant challenge," said Harvey
Goldschmid, a law professor at
Columbia University.
Encouraged by the apparent
trend, numerous private suits
were filed by small competitors
against such dominant com
panies as International Businss
Machines Corp., Xerox Corp.
and Eastman Kodak Co.
Now all the government's
cases have been settled or dis
missed, with the dominant
companies winning in every
case except American Tele
phone & Telegraph Co. and
generally prevailing in private
cases.
"In terms of the bottom line,
these cases have produced a
very limited return," said Gold
schmid after Friday's actions
were announced.
At the heart of the cases was

the government's attitude
toward domination of an in
dustry by one company or a
handful of companies, particu
larly if that domination was ac
quired legally.
Court decisions starting in
the mid-1940s and continuing
through the 1960s held that a
company with monopoly
power could take few actions
to protect that position without
running afoul of the antitrust
laws.
In one case, Alcoa's
monopoly in aluminum, which
had been obtained through a
patented process and sus
tained through techniques that
a lower court said were normal
business practices, was ruled il
legal.
The idea was that normal
practices, such as price cutting
or building new plants to meet
anticipated demand, might be
reasonable in a competitive in
dustry but could be used to
drive competitors out of busi
ness or keep them from enter
ing if used by a monopoly.
But beginning in the 19705,
the courts moved away from
that position, particularly in a
case involving Kodak and
Berkey Photo, a small com
petitor. Berkey lost most major
issues on appeal.

Assistant Attorney General
William Baxter, the head of the
antitrust division, cited the
Berkey casein droppingthe 12-
year-old suit against IBM: "You
can't bring (the antitrust laws)
to bear against a company just
because it is large, successful,
and captures a very big market
share."
"There's far more freedom
now for a company, once it ob
tains a monopoly, to defend
that position," said
Georgetown University pro
fessor Robert Pitofsky, who ap
proved of the move away from
the Alcoa decision but feared
the administration may have
gone too far.
"Bigness is an opportunity
for abuse," he said, "and the
same practice used by a small
company can be an abuse in
the hands of an IBM."
A major reason for the trend
away from the harsh attitude
toward monopolies was a feel
ing that antitrust action was
making American business less
competitive in international

markets.
"It's part of a realization that
we can't afford to hurt our
companies anymore," said
George Thompson, a business
professor at Columbia and co
author of a text on antitrust
law. "If IBM were severely
handicapped, they'd lose out
very rapidly to the Japanese,
who are already threatening
the computer industry."

was all but sure to lose.
