# Economy teeters near recession
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Inflation is coming down in
the United Statesand unemployment is going
up. For all the Reagan administration's
rhetoric about how an adroit combination of
supply-side economics and monetarism
could avoid the necessary pain of a recession,
the policies followed by the Reagan adminis
tration and the Federal Reserve in 1981 in the
name of fighting inflation have produced the
traditional result.
Slack in the economy, an unemployment
rate now only 0.1 percentage point below its
post World War II high, and stable or falling
oil and food prices combined to lop nearly
three percentage points off consumer price
inflation in 1981. An additional drop of more
than a percentage point — to a rate of about 8
percent — is likely this year.
This progress has been achieved at a very
high cost in terms of lost output, idle workers
and severe financial strains on many busi
nesses. The housing and auto industries are in
their own versions of depressions. Incomes,
savingand investmentareall lower,offsetting
part of the punch from the tax cuts the admin
istration is counting on to boost economic
growth in a non-inflationary way in the
future.

More importantly, however, the evidence
of the past year indicates that unless either
President Reagan changes his fiscal policy or
the Federal Reserve raises its money growth
targets for the next two years, it is an odds-on
bet for either a weak recovery from the cur
rent recession or another recession in 1983.
The Reagan administration does not accept
the notion that the recession is in any way a
consequence of its policy of seeking to stimu
late economic growth with personal and
business tax cuts while simultaneously trying
to hold down inflation through a steady re
duction in the rate of expansion of the money
supply.
Federal Reserve officials, on the other
hand, have never been under any misap
prehension about what a collision between a
stimulative fiscal policy and a highly restric
tive monetary policy would produce. At best,
they have said, their monetary policy would
provide room only for slow growth in a credit
strained economy.
The key question is whether a tight mone
tary policy, record borrowing needs by a defi
cit-ridden federal government, and the rising
credit demands of an expanding private sec
tor can co-exist. Last year they could not.
