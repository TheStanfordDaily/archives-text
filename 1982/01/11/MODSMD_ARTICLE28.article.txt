## Take NFC title in 28-27 thriller 49ers bound for Super Bowl 
### 
San Francisco (AP) — For one
breathless moment, a moment
none of the San Francisco 49ers
will ever forget, time stood still
at Candlestick Park yesterday.
In that moment, Dwight
Clark hung 3 feet in the air,
alone in the end zone, with the
ball clasped in his hands like a
golden treasure.
Freddie Solomon, the prima
ry receiver on the play, was on
the other side of the end zone
where he had lured several
Dallas defenders to free Clark.
Solomon looked across to
Clark and hollered, "Catch it,
Dwight, catch it."
joe Montana, the49ersquar
terback, was running toward
the right side of the field and
couldn't see the catch. But he
heard the crowd and knew
what he had done. He put the

49ers into Super Bowl XVI and
clinched the first National Con
ference championship in San
Francisco history with a 28-27
victory over the Cowboys.
Keith Fahnhorst, an of
fensive tackle who helped
keep the fearsome Dallas front
line away from Montana,
looked up from a pile just in
time to see Clark jump for the
ball.
"I wanted to get up to con
gratulate him, but I was para
lyzed," Fahnhorst said. "I've
never been through something
like this."
In that one moment, nearly
everyone in Candlestick Park
seemed paralyzed. Only
minutes before, 49ers fans
watched Dallas surge ahead to
a 27-21 lead. The final 91-yard
drive that would culminate in a

28-27 victory seemed more a
dream than a good bet.
The winning play, called a
sprint right option, was sup
posed to be the same pass to
Solomon that had worked on
an 8-yard touchdown pass in
the first period. But with
Solomon smothered by defen
ders, Montana found Clark
wide open.
The pass to Clark seemed too
high, even to Clark.
"The throw was high, just
like it had to be," Clark said. "I
didn't think Joe was gonna get
it off. I thought it was too high
and I'm not much of a jumper.
But I guess I can go just as high
as I need to in a championship
game."
"I didn't see the catch until I
came back to the locker room
and saw it on television," Mon

tana said. "It was unbelievable.
He jumped 3 feet off the
ground. It was just a great
catch."
Before that play, in the
middle of the 49ers' 91-yard
march, the San Francisco de
fense paced the sidelines ner
vously.
"We knew we were gonna
win, but yeah, we were ner
vous," said defensive end Jim
Stuckey, who shut off Dallas'
last effort by recovering a
fumble. "We were confident.
But we needed to see it hap
pen."
"We knew we had a long way
to go when we started that
drive, but there was a feeling
we could do it," said Montana.
"It was a feeling you could
sense in the huddle and on the
sidelines. We never lost con
fidence."

The pass to Clark seemed too
high, even to Clark.
"The throw was high, just
like it had to be," Clark said. "I
didn't think Joe was gonna get
it off. I thought it was too high
and I'm not much of a jumper.
But I guess I can go just as high
as I need to in a championship
game."
"I didn't see the catch until I
came back to the locker room
and saw it on television," Mon

tana said. "It was unbelievable.
He jumped 3 feet off the
ground. It was just a great
catch."
Before that play, in the
middle of the 49ers' 91-yard
march, the San Francisco de
fense paced the sidelines ner
vously.
"We knew we were gonna
win, but yeah, we were ner
vous," said defensive end Jim
Stuckey, who shut off Dallas'
last effort by recovering a
fumble. "We were confident.
But we needed to see it hap
pen."
"We knew we had a long way
to go when we started that
drive, but there was a feeling
we could do it," said Montana.
"It was a feeling you could
sense in the huddle and on the
sidelines. We never lost con
fidence."
