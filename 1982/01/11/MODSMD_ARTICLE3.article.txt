# Mud blocks Santa Cruz searches

Santa Cruz, C'alit. (AP) — Geologists surveyed a storm
devastated area yesterday to determine whether rescue
crews could resume the search for at least five people
still missing and feared dead in killer mudslides.
At Ben Lomond, the mud-ravaged little mountain
town a few miles north of Santa Cruz, weary towns
people and survivors with shovels, saws and bulldozers
had clawed at tons of muck to recover bodies.
Three more bodies were pulled from the brutalized
area during the weekend, pushing the storm death toll to
29 before geologists declared the region unsafe late Sat
urday, sheriff's Sgt. Bruce Simpson said. Fifteen of the
deaths were in Santa Cruz County.
"No crews are going out until we get the geologists'
next report," Simpson said. That report was due early this
morning.
The slide area along Love Creek Road was cordoned
off after a team of five geologists deemed the land "un
stable," said sheriff's Deputy Byron Hoffman. Residents
of at least eight houses along the edge of the slide were
advised to leave.
The victims, each found trapped in crushed, mud-cov
ered homes, were identified as Lester Eugene Rumrill,
47; Yvonne Renne Blount, 32, and Patricia Nelson, 42, ac
cording to sheriff's Lt. Phil Kirkland.
Nevertheless, the spirits of storm-weary residents
were bolstered by sunny skies, moderate temperatures
and forecasts predicting more of the same.
"We're on the road to recovery here," Simpson said.
"We're over the shock of it, and now we realize the task
we have before us."
Federal Disaster Assistance Centers were scheduled to
open today in Santa Cruz, Marin, San Mateo, Sonoma
and Contra Costa counties. At least 2000 storm victims
were expected to seek emergency aid from food to
clothing, interim housing to low-interest loans, said Alex
Cunningham, director of the State Office of Emergency
Services.
Federal officials declared Solano County a disaster
area Saturday after Gov. Jerry Brown asked that Solano
and three other counties — San Joaquin, Santa Clara and
Alameda — be added to the federal list of counties
eligible ' disaster aid. San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Marin,

Sonoma, Humboldt and Contra Costa counties have al
ready gained disaster status, and officials from the Feder
al Emergency Management Agency said the others
might be added later.
Approximately 539 people were reported injured, and
property damage approached $300 million for the dura
tion of the storm. At least 6023 homes were damaged and
439 destroyed, according to Nels Rasmussen, chief ad
ministrative officer of the state Office of Emergency Ser
vices.
All homes in the Santa Cruz area had water Sunday,
but the 70,000 residents in the Santa Cruz Water District
were being asked to cut their consumption in half while
efforts continued to repair the area's main pipeline.
Southern Pacific Railroad hauled 100,000 gallons of
drinking water to the tiny Santa Cruz County town of
Felton on Saturday, easing the critical water shortage
there, Southern Pacific spokesman Henry Ortez said.
Santa Cruz County sheriff's deputies arrested a man
suspected of looting a flooded home in Felton. Deputies
said that 22-year-old Jeffrey Scofield of Felton was
booked into the county jail on suspicion of grand theft.
Offcials in Daly City were monitoring two oceanfront
homes that were threatening to collapse, Deputy City
Manager Ray Letsinger said Sunday.
He said three families were evacuated from the houses
after "large pieces of the backyards fell onto the ocean
bluffs below."
Clean-up efforts continued in other hard-hit com
munities, including the Marin County town of Inverness,
where spectators have hampered a crew of 65 National
Guardsmen clearing mud and trees from the main high
way.
The guardsmen closed the coastal highway Sunday to
keep out "truckloads of rubberneckers," Sgt. Stephen
Gallant said.
Three houses were destroyed in mudslides in the area,
and most of the town still was without water and elec
tricity Sunday. There had been no deaths, however.
"In fact, we're plus one," said medic Michael Sidle, re
ferring to the birth of a girl late Friday night at an Inver
ness home.
