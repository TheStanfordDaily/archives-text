## An afternoon at Candlestick 
### 
It was a matter of ar
rogance. It was in the air,
smokey like the haze that
settled on Candlestick Park
at mid-morning.
Sometime during the day,
somebody threw down a
gauntlet. What happened
was, Bill Walsh's curious
crew seized it and plain out
arroganced Tom Landry's
mechanistic marvels. The
result was one of those rare
occassions when you said,
"Just once, please, let the
terrible happen to some
body else." And it did.
The 49ers played a game
yesterday that surely must
be unrivalled for all-out gall.
Apparently no one told
them that it really doesn't
matter if you beat the Cow
boys during the regular sea
son because something
strange happens to them in
a playoff, like they don't get
beat.
No one informed Walsh
that when you are six points
down, on your last drive of
the day and there is not a
great deal of time on the
clock, you do not call
double reverses that work.
And then Joe Montana re

fused to fall down in the
muck when Ed "Too Tall"
Jones, D.D. Lewis and
Harvey Martin tried to play
tag. Instead he skipped
towards the sideline and
lofted an almost lack
adasical pass that Dwight
Clark leaped for and caught
to win the game, making it
the prettiest thing ever
thrown at Candlestick.

"Montana has to
be the key.
There's nothing
else there but
him."
â€” Tom Landry
atter the game

Apparently it mattered to
no one that Roger Staubach
favored the Cowboys by
two touchdowns. Least of all
Walsh, who said Friday night
that the winner would have
to score 28 points.
None of this is to say that
Dallas didn't almost make
the terrible happen. Bedlam
never had a chance to reach
a crescendo after the Mon

tana-Clark connection be
cause Danny White and
Drew Pearson defined ar
rogance with a 30-yard pass
play that put the Cowboys in
field goal range with only 30
seconds remaining in the
game.
But unbeknownst to
60,000 silenced and heart
sick souls, the 49ers were
still fighting over the
gauntlet as White fell back
to pass again. Or maybe it
was just that Lawrence
Pillers had an unused turn
over left from an earlier
game, or some unjust zebra
call in his past, that allowed
him to hit White the way he
did, knocking the ball lose
and into the hands of john
Stuckey who fell on top of it
into the muck, smiling.
Tony Hill could only stand
very still in the place near
the sideline where he had
been so open. Pearson
walked slowly by him, star
ing stonily at nothing in par
ticular.
"Dallas really had them
there for a minute," said
one of the 60,000.
"Not if you considered
Fate," said another.
