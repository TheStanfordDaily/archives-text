# East-West Shrine Game fits into collegiate All-Star mold
## 
### Steve Odell 
It had the usual pageantry that is by now ex
pected from collegiate football all-star games. It
had professional scouts in abundance, peering
through their binoculars and then scribbling
down notes on tiny pads, notes that would affect
the future of the men on the field below. It even
had The Bear.
In fact, the 57th Annual East-West Shrine
Game, played Saturday at Stanford Stadium, had
everything that a college all-star game should
have.
More than all of this, though, it featured a little
known wide receiver and an even littler known
quarterback, hooking up for two touchdowns in
leading the West to a 20-13 victory.
The game's Most Valuable Offensive Player,
Brigham Young's Dan Plater, turned morethan a
few scout's heads with his performance. Plater
pulled in nine catches — one shy of the Shrine

record — for 120 yards and two touchdowns.
San Diego State quarterback Matt Kofler was
the man throwing primarily to Plater, and he hit
on 11 completions in 19 attempts for 131 yards.
The duo connected mostly on well timed side
line patterns, plays which looked as though
Plater and Kofler had been working on them
throughout their entire collegiate careers.
This was not entirely without reason. While
the two were unaquaintable to the most of the
76,000 fans, the second biggest crowd in Shrine
history, they were far from unfamiliar with each
other, or at least, each other's games. Doug
Scovil, offensive coordinator Plater's junior year
at BYU, went to San Diego State in 1981 to as
sume the head coaching post.
The West got their winning points midway
through the third quarter on the second of
Kofler-to-Plater touchdowns. With second and
five on the East 20-yard line, Kofler rolled right
and lofted a pass over East defensive back Jim
Bob Harris to a leaping Plater in u'he end zone to
give the West a 17-7 lead.
The East retaliated quickly. Wit h 1:38 remain
ing in the third period, Georgia quarterback
Buck Belue found Larry Brodsky of Miami on a
fly pattern down the left sideline for a 48-yard
gain. Four plays later, Belue got another of his
five completions (in 17 attempts), throwing a
four-yard touchdown pass to Michigan's Stanley
Edwards. When kicker Don Sturnp's extra point
attempt hit the right upright and bounced out,
the score remained 17-13, West.
The East threatened once more'. On the ensu
ing kickoff return, San Jose (State's Gerald
Willhite broke through a wave of would-be
tacklers all the way up to the t:ast 48, only to
fumble into open territory. After a scramble for
the loose ball, the East's John Krimm of Notre
Dame, fell on it at the East 43.

The East proceeded to move the ball into West
territory until Stanford's Doug Rogers, who had
five tackles and two sacks in the game, came up
with the West's biggest defensive play. With
13:07 remaining, Rogers got by Penn State's All-
America guard, Sean Farrell, and leveled East
quarterback Rick Stockstill. The Florida State
quarterback fumbled, and Utah's Steve Clark re
covered for the West at its own 42.
Nine plays and 27 yards later, kicker John
Goodson of Texas drilled his second field goal of
the day, from 48 yards out, to give the West its
final margin of 20-13, with 9:13 left to play.
While Stanford's Rogers and center John
Macaulay performed admirably for the West, it
was another long afternoon of sitting on the
sideline for the Cardinal's Andre Tyler. Tyler
strained his left hamstring in practice Thursday,
and was unable to play. He will get a shot to
prove himself next week, however, in the Olym
pia Gold Bowl.

have.
More than all of this, though, it featured a little
known wide receiver and an even littler known
quarterback, hooking up for two touchdowns in
leading the West to a 20-13 victory.
The game's Most Valuable Offensive Player,
Brigham Young's Dan Plater, turned morethan a
few scout's heads with his performance. Plater
pulled in nine catches — one shy of the Shrine

record — for 120 yards and two touchdowns.
San Diego State quarterback Matt Kofler was
the man throwing primarily to Plater, and he hit
on 11 completions in 19 attempts for 131 yards.
The duo connected mostly on well timed side
line patterns, plays which looked as though
Plater and Kofler had been working on them
throughout their entire collegiate careers.
This was not entirely without reason. While
the two were unaquaintable to the most of the
76,000 fans, the second biggest crowd in Shrine
history, they were far from unfamiliar with each
other, or at least, each other's games. Doug
Scovil, offensive coordinator Plater's junior year
at BYU, went to San Diego State in 1981 to as
sume the head coaching post.
The West got their winning points midway
through the third quarter on the second of
Kofler-to-Plater touchdowns. With second and
five on the East 20-yard line, Kofler rolled right
and lofted a pass over East defensive back Jim
Bob Harris to a leaping Plater in u'he end zone to
give the West a 17-7 lead.
The East retaliated quickly. Wit h 1:38 remain
ing in the third period, Georgia quarterback
Buck Belue found Larry Brodsky of Miami on a
fly pattern down the left sideline for a 48-yard
gain. Four plays later, Belue got another of his
five completions (in 17 attempts), throwing a
four-yard touchdown pass to Michigan's Stanley
Edwards. When kicker Don Sturnp's extra point
attempt hit the right upright and bounced out,
the score remained 17-13, West.
The East threatened once more'. On the ensu
ing kickoff return, San Jose (State's Gerald
Willhite broke through a wave of would-be
tacklers all the way up to the t:ast 48, only to
fumble into open territory. After a scramble for
the loose ball, the East's John Krimm of Notre
Dame, fell on it at the East 43.

The East proceeded to move the ball into West
territory until Stanford's Doug Rogers, who had
five tackles and two sacks in the game, came up
with the West's biggest defensive play. With
13:07 remaining, Rogers got by Penn State's All-
America guard, Sean Farrell, and leveled East
quarterback Rick Stockstill. The Florida State
quarterback fumbled, and Utah's Steve Clark re
covered for the West at its own 42.
Nine plays and 27 yards later, kicker John
Goodson of Texas drilled his second field goal of
the day, from 48 yards out, to give the West its
final margin of 20-13, with 9:13 left to play.
While Stanford's Rogers and center John
Macaulay performed admirably for the West, it
was another long afternoon of sitting on the
sideline for the Cardinal's Andre Tyler. Tyler
strained his left hamstring in practice Thursday,
and was unable to play. He will get a shot to
prove himself next week, however, in the Olym
pia Gold Bowl.
