It had the usual pageantry that is by now ex
pected from collegiate football all-star games. It
had professional scouts in abundance, peering
through their binoculars and then scribbling
down notes on tiny pads, notes that would affect
the future of the men on the field below. It even

In fact, the 57th Annual East-West Shrine

The game's Most Valuable Offensive Player,
Brigham Young's Dan Plater, turned morethan a

pulled in nine catches — one shy of the Shrine

record — for 120 yards and two touchdowns.
San Diego State quarterback Matt Kofler was
the man throwing primarily to Plater, and he hit

The duo connected mostly on well timed side
line patterns, plays which looked as though
Plater and Kofler had been working on them
throughout their entire collegiate careers.
This was not entirely without reason. While

76,000 fans, the second biggest crowd in Shrine
history, they were far from unfamiliar with each

Scovil, offensive coordinator Plater's junior year
at BYU, went to San Diego State in 1981 to as
sume the head coaching post.
The West got their winning points midway
through the third quarter on the second of
Kofler-to-Plater touchdowns. With second and
five on the East 20-yard line, Kofler rolled right
