## A
						look at the best and worst of the vacation sports scene

"His elevator doesn't go
to the top floor, Pat." —
John Madden to Pat Sum
merall, last month.
Was my Christmas vaca
tion just an extended box
score? It sure felt that way at
times. Too many ballgames
in too few days. From Shea
Stadium in Queens (N.Y.) to
Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe
(Ariz.), from The
Meadowlands to my tele
vision set — my brain began
to drain from too many
jumpshots, too many bowl
games, too much exposure

to the "CBS chalkboard."
Evidently my elevator
doesn't go to the top floor
either.
"Ever read a book?," my
father asked me.
"At school."
"How about here?"
"Too many games, Dad
dy."
While I allegedly get to
the books, here's the best
and worst of my break:
THt NEW YOKK GIANTS
— Words can describe what
it was like to be a Giants' fan
during the 19705. Bleak.
Hapless. Hopeless. A full

decade given over to "The
Fumble," to Craig Morton,
to John ("Trade Me!") Men
denhall, to Dan Goich (heof
the perpetually immaculate
uniform — no matter the
conditions), to bad seasons
that ended 4-10, to worse
ones that ended 2-12.
Last month though, it all
changed. Suddenly the
Giants were no longer
crack-ups. Suddenly the
Giants had real players —
like outside linebacker Law
rence Taylor and running
back Rob Carpenter. Sud
denly the Giants were stick

ing it to the Cowboys to
make the playoffs (with a 9-7
record), and then blowing
away the Eagles to reach the
final eight.
Did all this vindicate the
Dismal Decade? Never. But
the Giants in the playoffs. . .
ah, Christmas did come to
New York this year!!
WORST BOWL GAME: —
The Blue-Gray game. Ac
cording to Steve Harvey of
the L.A. Times, anyone with
a helmet can play in this
one. Truth be told though,
my dad logged even more
winks during the Lakers-

Suns telecast that followed.
WOKSI MAJOR COL
LEGE NICKNAME: — You
got it,"The Cardinal." So
much for the intellectual
elite. Give the sporstwriter a
break, bring back the Indi
an. Do something! Any
thing but "The Cardinal."
NORTH CAROLINA VS.
KENTUCKY (Dec. 26): —
The Brendan Byrne Arena is
the nicest basketball
pavillion you'd ever want to
find in the middle of a
swamp. Swamp or no
swamp, The Meadowlands
had quite an attraction

when North Carolina and
Kentucky (the nation's top
two teams at that point)
brought their wares for a na
tionally televised shootout.
Future number one draft
picks dotted the floor. But
while Kentucky ran its give
me-the-ball-and-go-to-hell
offense to perfection, the
Tar Heels — a more mature
and amiable lot — quietly
salted the game away. James
Worthy (26 points and eight
rebounds) and Sam Perkins
(21 and 11) locked up the
middle, and N.C.'s newest
prize, freshman Micahel

Jordan dazzled from the pe
rimeter (hitting 9 of his last
eleven shots and finishing
with 19).
Afterwards, outside the
unhappy Kentucky locker
room, reporters flocked to
the Wildcat's injured star
Sam Bowie. Would the out
come have been different
had he played?, Sam was
asked. "Yeah," he said, lean
ing on crutches bigger than
most people. "It would have
been worse."
AFC PLAYOFF: NEW
YORK JETS VS. BUFFALO
