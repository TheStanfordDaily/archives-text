## A 						look at the best and worst of the vacation sports scene

"His elevator doesn't go
to the top floor, Pat." —
John Madden to Pat Sum
merall, last month.
Was my Christmas vaca
tion just an extended box
score? It sure felt that way at
times. Too many ballgames
in too few days. From Shea
Stadium in Queens (N.Y.) to
Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe
(Ariz.), from The
Meadowlands to my tele
vision set — my brain began
to drain from too many
jumpshots, too many bowl
games, too much exposure

to the "CBS chalkboard."
Evidently my elevator
doesn't go to the top floor
either.
"Ever read a book?," my
father asked me.
"At school."
"How about here?"
"Too many games, Dad
dy."
While I allegedly get to
the books, here's the best
and worst of my break:
THt NEW YOKK GIANTS
— Words can describe what
it was like to be a Giants' fan
during the 19705. Bleak.
Hapless. Hopeless. A full

decade given over to "The
Fumble," to Craig Morton,
to John ("Trade Me!") Men
denhall, to Dan Goich (heof
the perpetually immaculate
uniform — no matter the
conditions), to bad seasons
that ended 4-10, to worse
ones that ended 2-12.
Last month though, it all
changed. Suddenly the
Giants were no longer
crack-ups. Suddenly the
Giants had real players —
like outside linebacker Law
rence Taylor and running
back Rob Carpenter. Sud
denly the Giants were stick

ing it to the Cowboys to
make the playoffs (with a 9-7
record), and then blowing
away the Eagles to reach the
final eight.
Did all this vindicate the
Dismal Decade? Never. But
the Giants in the playoffs. . .
ah, Christmas did come to
New York this year!!
WORST BOWL GAME: —
The Blue-Gray game. Ac
cording to Steve Harvey of
the L.A. Times, anyone with
a helmet can play in this
one. Truth be told though,
my dad logged even more
winks during the Lakers-

Suns telecast that followed.
WOKSI MAJOR COL
LEGE NICKNAME: — You
got it,"The Cardinal." So
much for the intellectual
elite. Give the sporstwriter a
break, bring back the Indi
an. Do something! Any
thing but "The Cardinal."
NORTH CAROLINA VS.
KENTUCKY (Dec. 26): —
The Brendan Byrne Arena is
the nicest basketball
pavillion you'd ever want to
find in the middle of a
swamp. Swamp or no
swamp, The Meadowlands
had quite an attraction

when North Carolina and
Kentucky (the nation's top
two teams at that point)
brought their wares for a na
tionally televised shootout.
Future number one draft
picks dotted the floor. But
while Kentucky ran its give
me-the-ball-and-go-to-hell
offense to perfection, the
Tar Heels — a more mature
and amiable lot — quietly
salted the game away. James
Worthy (26 points and eight
rebounds) and Sam Perkins
(21 and 11) locked up the
middle, and N.C.'s newest
prize, freshman Micahel

Jordan dazzled from the pe
rimeter (hitting 9 of his last
eleven shots and finishing
with 19).
Afterwards, outside the
unhappy Kentucky locker
room, reporters flocked to
the Wildcat's injured star
Sam Bowie. Would the out
come have been different
had he played?, Sam was
asked. "Yeah," he said, lean
ing on crutches bigger than
most people. "It would have
been worse."
AFC PLAYOFF: NEW
YORK JETS VS. BUFFALO
(Dec. 27):—Cold, cold. The
winds at Shea are killers in
December. But no one
complained today. The Jets
were in the playoffs for the
first time since joe Namath
and that championship sea
son of 1969.
Buffalo scored its first
touchdown while my friend
and I were still on the sub
way. The Jets never really re
covered. Richard Todd was
off the mark, and his big
name burners let him down.
The ballyhooed "New York
Sack Exchange" — darling
of the local media — was
never a factor. On a gray,
frigid afternoon (the lights
were on from the start), the
Bills were simply better.
They won by four.
I could sympathize with

the Jets though. I didn't get
the feeling back in my legs
until I was home — watch
ing the Giants. And I was a
spectator.
FIESTA BOWL: USC VS.
PENN STATE (|an. 1): —
"How much experience do
you have as a stage man
ager?," the NBC producer
asked me on New Year's Eve
in Pheonix.
"None."
"Oh." He didn't seem to
fazed. I supposed in TV you
see almost everything in
time.
My main responsibility
the following day was to
make sure that our sideline
announcer, Mike Haffner,
got on and off the air
smoothly. I was equipped
with a P.L. (a production line
connecting me with the
NBC truck) and, as it turned
out, a staff of five.

"Where do we put the
NBC Sports banners, Mr.
Kosner," one of them asked
me.
"Gee ..."
All week long, Marcus Al
len, USC's Heisman Trophy
winning tailback, had been
the star of the Scottsdale
Registry Resort. Greetings
from"The Trojan Family"
flowed freely from his lips,
just as autographs seemed
to float off his fingers.
Had he known what was
awaiting him on New Year's
Day in Tempe, Marcus
might well have stayed at
the Registry. The Nittany
Lions stuffed him (M.A.
managed only 85 yards on 30
carried) and converted his
two fumbles into 10 big
points.
The Penn State assistant
coaches warned their
players not to associate with

the TV people (and for some
reasons the P.L.s on the USC
sideline didn't work). Many
though couldn't resist.
"We're just kicking their
butts/' one of the Lions
growled in my general
direction. Haffner, who
claims to have been the last
single-wing halfback (he
played at UCLA in the early
'60s), was rarely short on
company.
My P.L. kept me constant
company. "How much time
left on the clock?," the man
in the truck roared in my
ear. "Down and yardage?"
After a while I wised up and
began offering the informa
tion first. When I finally got
to take the headset off
(some three and a half hours
after I had first put it on), my
head was spinning. I knew
what Marcus must have felt
like.

me-the-ball-and-go-to-hell
offense to perfection, the
Tar Heels — a more mature
and amiable lot — quietly
salted the game away. James
Worthy (26 points and eight
rebounds) and Sam Perkins
(21 and 11) locked up the
middle, and N.C.'s newest
prize, freshman Micahel

Jordan dazzled from the pe
rimeter (hitting 9 of his last
eleven shots and finishing
with 19).
Afterwards, outside the
unhappy Kentucky locker
room, reporters flocked to
the Wildcat's injured star
Sam Bowie. Would the out
come have been different
had he played?, Sam was
asked. "Yeah," he said, lean
ing on crutches bigger than
most people. "It would have
been worse."
AFC PLAYOFF: NEW
YORK JETS VS. BUFFALO
(Dec. 27):—Cold, cold. The
winds at Shea are killers in
December. But no one
complained today. The Jets
were in the playoffs for the
first time since joe Namath
and that championship sea
son of 1969.
Buffalo scored its first
touchdown while my friend
and I were still on the sub
way. The Jets never really re
covered. Richard Todd was
off the mark, and his big
name burners let him down.
The ballyhooed "New York
Sack Exchange" — darling
of the local media — was
never a factor. On a gray,
frigid afternoon (the lights
were on from the start), the
Bills were simply better.
They won by four.
I could sympathize with

the Jets though. I didn't get
the feeling back in my legs
until I was home — watch
ing the Giants. And I was a
spectator.
FIESTA BOWL: USC VS.
PENN STATE (|an. 1): —
"How much experience do
you have as a stage man
ager?," the NBC producer
asked me on New Year's Eve
in Pheonix.
"None."
"Oh." He didn't seem to
fazed. I supposed in TV you
see almost everything in
time.
My main responsibility
the following day was to
make sure that our sideline
announcer, Mike Haffner,
got on and off the air
smoothly. I was equipped
with a P.L. (a production line
connecting me with the
NBC truck) and, as it turned
out, a staff of five.

"Where do we put the
NBC Sports banners, Mr.
Kosner," one of them asked
me.
"Gee ..."
All week long, Marcus Al
len, USC's Heisman Trophy
winning tailback, had been
the star of the Scottsdale
Registry Resort. Greetings
from"The Trojan Family"
flowed freely from his lips,
just as autographs seemed
to float off his fingers.
Had he known what was
awaiting him on New Year's
Day in Tempe, Marcus
might well have stayed at
the Registry. The Nittany
Lions stuffed him (M.A.
managed only 85 yards on 30
carried) and converted his
two fumbles into 10 big
points.
The Penn State assistant
coaches warned their
players not to associate with

the TV people (and for some
reasons the P.L.s on the USC
sideline didn't work). Many
though couldn't resist.
"We're just kicking their
butts/' one of the Lions
growled in my general
direction. Haffner, who
claims to have been the last
single-wing halfback (he
played at UCLA in the early
'60s), was rarely short on
company.
My P.L. kept me constant
company. "How much time
left on the clock?," the man
in the truck roared in my
ear. "Down and yardage?"
After a while I wised up and
began offering the informa
tion first. When I finally got
to take the headset off
(some three and a half hours
after I had first put it on), my
head was spinning. I knew
what Marcus must have felt
like.
"His elevator doesn't go
to the top floor, Pat." —
John Madden to Pat Sum
merall, last month.
Was my Christmas vaca
tion just an extended box
score? It sure felt that way at
times. Too many ballgames
in too few days. From Shea
Stadium in Queens (N.Y.) to
Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe
(Ariz.), from The
Meadowlands to my tele
vision set — my brain began
to drain from too many
jumpshots, too many bowl
games, too much exposure

to the "CBS chalkboard."
Evidently my elevator
doesn't go to the top floor
either.
"Ever read a book?," my
father asked me.
"At school."
"How about here?"
"Too many games, Dad
dy."
While I allegedly get to
the books, here's the best
and worst of my break:
THt NEW YOKK GIANTS
— Words can describe what
it was like to be a Giants' fan
during the 19705. Bleak.
Hapless. Hopeless. A full

decade given over to "The
Fumble," to Craig Morton,
to John ("Trade Me!") Men
denhall, to Dan Goich (heof
the perpetually immaculate
uniform — no matter the
conditions), to bad seasons
that ended 4-10, to worse
ones that ended 2-12.
Last month though, it all
changed. Suddenly the
Giants were no longer
crack-ups. Suddenly the
Giants had real players —
like outside linebacker Law
rence Taylor and running
back Rob Carpenter. Sud
denly the Giants were stick

ing it to the Cowboys to
make the playoffs (with a 9-7
record), and then blowing
away the Eagles to reach the
final eight.
Did all this vindicate the
Dismal Decade? Never. But
the Giants in the playoffs. . .
ah, Christmas did come to
New York this year!!
WORST BOWL GAME: —
The Blue-Gray game. Ac
cording to Steve Harvey of
the L.A. Times, anyone with
a helmet can play in this
one. Truth be told though,
my dad logged even more
winks during the Lakers-

Suns telecast that followed.
WOKSI MAJOR COL

got it,"The Cardinal." So
much for the intellectual
elite. Give the sporstwriter a
break, bring back the Indi
an. Do something! Any
thing but "The Cardinal."
NORTH CAROLINA VS.
KENTUCKY (Dec. 26): —
The Brendan Byrne Arena is
the nicest basketball
pavillion you'd ever want to
find in the middle of a
swamp. Swamp or no
swamp, The Meadowlands
had quite an attraction

when North Carolina and
Kentucky (the nation's top
two teams at that point)
brought their wares for a na
tionally televised shootout.
Future number one draft
picks dotted the floor. But
while Kentucky ran its give
