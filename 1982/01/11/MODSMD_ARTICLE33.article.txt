# Seniors spark hoop win
## 
### Sieve Odell 
It was senior hoop night at
Maples Pavilion Saturday
night. Or at least it seemed that
way, judging by the per
formances of the three elder
statesmen on the Stanford
team.
Seniors Brian Welch, Doug
Marty, and Orlando Ward
combined for 49 points and led
the Cardinal to a 97-88 victory
over Oregon in a Pacific-10
Conference basketball game
over the weekend.
"Those three veterans led
us," agreed Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso. "They have since
the Santa Clara loss (Dec. 19)
during our practices, and
they've kept the team's spirits
up during some of our close
losses."
Stanford fell behind midway
through the first half after a
27-10 spurt by the Ducks put
Oregon ahead, 29-18. The
Cardinal fought their way back
into the game, though, by reel
ing off spurts of six, four, five,
and five points. The last of
these runs gave Stanford the
lead at 38-37 with 2:11 remain
ing in the first period and 44-41
at the intermission.
In the second half, Oregon
came out smokin' and out
scored the Cardinal 6-2 to take

a 47-46 lead. It was the last time
the Ducks would lead. How
ever, led by forward John
Greig, the game's leading
scorer with 24 points, Oregon
would threaten.
The Ducks came to within
one point with 8:44 remaining
at 67-66, when Greig banked in
a jumper from the right side.
After a Cardinal time-out, Stan
ford regrouped and scored six
straight points, taking advan
tage of two Oregon turnovers.
Marty hit a bomb, and fol
lowed it up by scoring a fast
break lay-in off a fullcourt pass
from Welch. Freshman forward
Johnny Rogers, who had 18
points including a perfect 8-
for-8 performance at the line,
netted two free throws to con
clude the burst and put Stan
ford up, 73-66 with 6:52 to go.
The Cardinal pulled away at
that point, due mainly to the
spirited play of forward Orlan
do Ward, who came off the
bench to score 16 points, 13 of
them in the last six minutes.
The spurt certainly was not due
to Stanford's foul shooting, as
the Cardinal missed the front
end of one-and-ones three
times in the final two minutes.
Oregon was in foul trouble
throughout the night, ac
cumulating 33 fouls in the
game, and having three starters

foul out. As a result, the Ducks
went to a 2-3 zone in the sec
ond half, but the Cardinal shot
well enough to counter. Stan
ford shot 57 percent from the
field, mainly by getting the ball
inside and working on the foul
plagued Oregon front line.
But the Cardinal also hit well
from the outside, allowing
them to score a season-high 97
points. Welch was 8-for-14
from the floor and ended up
with a team-high 21 points,
most of them coming from the
perimeter. Marty hit on 6-of-10
shots from the floor, a com
bination of mid-range jump
shots and penetrating lay-ins.
He also dished out five assists,
before fouling out with 56 sec
onds left.
Orlando Ward put the game
in perspective best, especially
with nationally-ranked Ore
gon State invading Maples Pa
vilion tonight. "We needed
something like this," he said.
"We needed to keep our in
tensity on defense and con
fidence on offense. We
needed to dig inside. And I
guess we did."
The Cardinal is now 1-1 in
Pac-10 play and 6-5 overall,
while the Ducks fell to 2-2 in
the conference and 7-6 overall.
Tip-off time for the game
with the Beavers is 8 p.m.

went to a 2-3 zone in the sec
ond half, but the Cardinal shot
well enough to counter. Stan
ford shot 57 percent from the
field, mainly by getting the ball
inside and working on the foul
plagued Oregon front line.
But the Cardinal also hit well
from the outside, allowing
them to score a season-high 97
points. Welch was 8-for-14
from the floor and ended up
with a team-high 21 points,
most of them coming from the
perimeter. Marty hit on 6-of-10
shots from the floor, a com
bination of mid-range jump
shots and penetrating lay-ins.
He also dished out five assists,
before fouling out with 56 sec
onds left.
Orlando Ward put the game
in perspective best, especially
with nationally-ranked Ore
gon State invading Maples Pa
vilion tonight. "We needed
something like this," he said.
"We needed to keep our in
tensity on defense and con
fidence on offense. We
needed to dig inside. And I
guess we did."
The Cardinal is now 1-1 in
Pac-10 play and 6-5 overall,
while the Ducks fell to 2-2 in
the conference and 7-6 overall.
Tip-off time for the game
with the Beavers is 8 p.m.
It was senior hoop night at
Maples Pavilion Saturday
night. Or at least it seemed that
way, judging by the per
formances of the three elder
statesmen on the Stanford
team.
Seniors Brian Welch, Doug
Marty, and Orlando Ward
combined for 49 points and led
the Cardinal to a 97-88 victory
over Oregon in a Pacific-10
Conference basketball game
over the weekend.
"Those three veterans led
us," agreed Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso. "They have since
the Santa Clara loss (Dec. 19)
during our practices, and
they've kept the team's spirits
up during some of our close
losses."
Stanford fell behind midway
through the first half after a
27-10 spurt by the Ducks put
Oregon ahead, 29-18. The
Cardinal fought their way back
into the game, though, by reel
ing off spurts of six, four, five,
and five points. The last of
these runs gave Stanford the
lead at 38-37 with 2:11 remain
ing in the first period and 44-41
at the intermission.
In the second half, Oregon
came out smokin' and out
scored the Cardinal 6-2 to take

a 47-46 lead. It was the last time
the Ducks would lead. How
ever, led by forward John
Greig, the game's leading
scorer with 24 points, Oregon
would threaten.
The Ducks came to within
one point with 8:44 remaining
at 67-66, when Greig banked in
a jumper from the right side.
After a Cardinal time-out, Stan
ford regrouped and scored six
straight points, taking advan
tage of two Oregon turnovers.
Marty hit a bomb, and fol
lowed it up by scoring a fast
break lay-in off a fullcourt pass
from Welch. Freshman forward
Johnny Rogers, who had 18
points including a perfect 8-
for-8 performance at the line,
netted two free throws to con
clude the burst and put Stan
ford up, 73-66 with 6:52 to go.
The Cardinal pulled away at
that point, due mainly to the
spirited play of forward Orlan
do Ward, who came off the
bench to score 16 points, 13 of
them in the last six minutes.
The spurt certainly was not due
to Stanford's foul shooting, as
the Cardinal missed the front
end of one-and-ones three
times in the final two minutes.
Oregon was in foul trouble
throughout the night, ac
cumulating 33 fouls in the
game, and having three starters

foul out. As a result, the Ducks
went to a 2-3 zone in the sec
ond half, but the Cardinal shot
well enough to counter. Stan
ford shot 57 percent from the
field, mainly by getting the ball
inside and working on the foul
plagued Oregon front line.
But the Cardinal also hit well
from the outside, allowing
them to score a season-high 97
points. Welch was 8-for-14
