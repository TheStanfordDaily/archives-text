# Women sweep, men split
## Tank teams splash into Winter season 
### Nick Ferguson 
The women swimmers completed a very
successful weekend by thrashing the Uni
versity of Arizona 97-46, and Arizona State
University 108-41 at deGuerre complex.
Their season record now stands at seven
wins without a defeat.
"It was a lesson in swimming," said ASU
coach Bill Gillet ruefully.
The victory over the Sun Devils had to be
the most satisfying, as ASU was ranked
fourth in the nation going into the meet,
and prior to the meet Cardinal coach
George Haines said he envisioned a good
test for his team.
As it turned out, the meet was more of a
showcase for a talent-laden Stanford team
than a contest. This was not due to any in
adequacies on the part of the Sun Devils,
but rather emphasized the incredible
strength of Stanford, ranked No. 1 in the
nation. Ten Cardinal women made cutoff
times for the NCAA individual cham
pionships in 14 different events, including
two relays.

Trying to find distinctly superlative per
formances on a day when everyone swam
well, Haines cited Lisa Buese in the butterf
ly and Kim Carlisle in the backstroke as
having lowered their times by three and
four seconds, respectively.
All of this points to the fact that the Stan
ford women have yet to find a team in their
class. This challenge will come on Feb. 6,
when the University of Texas Longhorns
charge in.
"There are three teams in the country
that on any given day could be the best:
Texas, the University of Florida and Stan
ford," said Gillet.
For the men, the weekend was a dif
ferent story.
They started out with impressive wins
over Calgary and Nebraska and, although
they were missing three key swimmers,
they had good reason to believe they
could do the same with ASU. They were
swimming with good speed, the freshmen
were coming along, and the home crowd
was in their favor. They even had a new
scoreboard.

Coach Skip Kenney said before the
event ( "lf you hadtoldmethreeweeksago
that we would be swimming against ASU
without Flemons, Weick and Bodor, I
would have said we had no chance to win,
but now I think we've got a shot."
As it was, they had a very good shot, and
almost pulled it off before losing the last
event. There is little doubt that with Wade
Flemons, a great backstroker, Bari Weick,
one of their best distance swimmers, and
Ricky Bodor, an all-around performer,
they would have won. Without them the
score was 57-56 ASU.
Kenney made no excuses, praising both
his swimmers and ASU's, "I feel we learned
a lot from this meet," he said, adding that
he found out his freshmen could step in
place of the missing upperclassmen and do
the job. He cited Jon Denney and Dave
Bottom as giving particularly pleasing per
formances; Denney was voted Most Valu
able Player of the meet and captured two
firsts and a second.
Looking forward, the men will face the
University of Arizona Thursday.
