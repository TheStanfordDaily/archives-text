Prelate pans Pole pledges
Warsaw — The head of Poland's Roman Catholic Church,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp, told Poles yesterday they should
listen to their consciences in deciding whether to sign loyalty
pledges demanded by the communist authorities.
Echoing the words of Pope John Paul II in a sermon in the
Vatican Sunday, Glemp said no one has the right to force
people to go against their consciences. It was the second
time in less than a week that he attacked Poland's martial-law
authorities for suppression of human rights.
The issue of loyalty pledges and the dismissals of Solidarity
activists from their jobs is believed to have figured promi
nently in talks yesterday between Glemp and Poland's mili
tary leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. Apart from a brief
communique saying that the two had discussed the situation
in Poland, no details have emerged from the talks.
With the independent Solidarity trade union suspended,
the Catholic Church has emerged as a focal point of opposi
tion to the new martial-law decrees. But, while Glemp and
other church leaders have expressed their abhorrence at the
measures, they also have appealed to Poles to avoid further
bloodshed and violence.
Speaking in the church of St. Augustine in central Warsaw,
Glemp said the church was doing everything possible to help
detained Solidarity activists and their families, including
holding talks with the government.
According to official figures, more than 5000 Solidarity ac
tivists are being held in 47 internment camps around the
country. In addition, another 3000 were arrested and
charged or sentenced under specific martial-law regu
lations.
Glemp said that pressure by the authoritiesnto extract loy
alty oaths created a "problem of conscience for very many
people."
Senior Polish officials have said that "ideological veri
fication" is under way in government offices and news
papers. They defend the practice on the grounds that the
state has the right to demand loyalty from its employes.
Meanwhile, in a slight relaxation of martial law, tele
phones throughout Poland were reconnected Sunday for lo
cal calls. Poles were warned that the calls would be censored
and interrupted if conversations turned subversive.
Callers dialingsome numbers, including the Polish Roman
Catholic bishops' office, heard recorded messages saying:
"This call is being monitored."
A visitor to Bialoleka Prison in northern Warsaw, where
about 350 Solidarity activists were being held, reported
seeing dissident Jacek Kuron, who was recently transferred
from an internment camp in northern Poland. Tight police
security was enforced when Kuron and several other senior
Solidarity officials and advisers, were transferred.
Radio Warsaw Sunday reported a state of emergency
caused by heavy snow and rain west of Warsaw. The Vistula
River overflowed its banks, and thousands of residents were
being evacuated from their homes by troops, police and fire
fighters.
Haig heads tor Brussels
Brussels — Secretary of State Alexander Haig gave notice
yesterday that the United States still intended to press for al
lied sanctions against the Soviet Union as punishment for the
Soviet role in the martial-law crackdown in Poland.
And while Haig has said publicly that he did not expect the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to go as far toward
the U.S. view of the crisis as to agree now on concrete steps
to punish the Soviets, he reiterated Sunday that he would be
satisfied with what he called a "strategic framework" in
which NATO could adopt economic and political sanctions
in the future.
Speaking to reporters while en route to Brussels for today's
special meeting of NATO foreign ministers on the Poland
crisis, Haig cautioned the Europeans against being misled by
"phony moderation" by the Polish authorities, which have
recently taken steps to ease some aspects of their repressive
rule.
"We hope to set in motion a framework for active con
sideration of economic and political sanctions," Haig said.
"We do hope to discuss concrete steps."

Although the NATO talks are unlikely to yield agreement
on a single policy of trade and economic sanctions against
either the Soviet Union or Poland, a strong political declara
tion is expected to emerge. That is expected to be followed
by various measures from NATO governments in the weeks
ahead to show that business as usual with the Eastern Bloc is
impossible as long as martial law continues in Poland.
Among members of the European Common Market, sup
port is growing for a "carrot and stick" policy. This would in
volve promising Common Market aid for Poland's recovery
as soon as martail law is lifted and other political conditions
are fulfilled. Meantime, new credits would not be given and
trade would be held to a minimum.
The Europeans are also studying a suggestion that they re
duce their imports from the Soviet Union and tighten up on
loans and credits to Moscow. Such measures would even
tually affect Soviet purchases from the West. Meantime, they
would affect the Soviet balance of payments, which is al
ready in deficit.
Haig on Sunday repeated the administration view that it
would be a tragedy if the situation in Poland led to splitting
the United States from its West European allies. But Haig
made clear the administration would act alone if it had to.
Polish Minister arrives in Moscow
Moscow — Polish Foreign Minister Jozef Czyrek arrived in
Moscow yesterday on an official visit that is expected to
focus on consultations with Kremlin leaders.
Diplomatic observers here said the trip, coupled with the
easing of martial-law restrictions in Poland, seemed to be an
effort to demonstrate a gradual restoration of normalcy in
the country.
East European sources said Czyrek's visit could also be in
terpreted as reflecting the need to coordinate policies be
tween Moscow and Warsaw in the face of continued
Western criticism and President Reagan's economic sanc
tions.
The Soviets have repeatedly denounced the Reagan ad
ministration for allegedly seeking to use Poland to increase
international tensions. Moscow had warned that it would
take retaliatory action against those NATO countries that
"succumb" to U.S. pressure for economic sanctions.
An authoritative Kremlin commentary yesterday, how
ever, clearly stated that Moscow was interested in the lower
ing of the international temperature.
It was not known which side initiated Czyrek's visit, but it is
expected that the Polish official will publicly reject the
Western contention that Moscow, rather than the Polish
leadership, was responsible for the military crackdown.
Czyrek was met yesterday by Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko.
While they have sought to avoid any impression of in
terferring in Polish affairs, the Soviets have made it abun
dantly clear that they would like to see the Polish Communist
Party regenerate itself, assume its leading role and take back
the reins of power from the armed forces.
Republicans reappraise revenue
Washington — House Republican leaders, jarred by stag
gering budget deficit projections into a reappraisal of their
opposition to tax increases, are urging the Reagan adminis
tration to consider some major revenue-raising measures to
keep deficits below $100 billion over the next few years.
Among their suggestions are a tax on the proceeds from
further decontrol of natural-gas prices, a tightening of the
minimum income tax, repeal of the tax provision approved
last year allowing corporations to sell their tax breaks and a
tax on imported oil, according to several of the leaders.
They reportedly have mixed feelings about proposals by
presidential aides to increase federal excise taxes on Alcohol,
tobacco and gasoline.
A group of leading House Republicans, including Minor
ity Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.) met Thursday with Office of
Management and Budget Director David Stockman. Accord
ing to three of the participants, they came away with the con
clusion that raising taxes may be the only way to avoid politi
cally intolerable deficits for the foreseeable future.
Some were also described as favoring a slow-down in the

huge planned increase in defense spending, along with con
tinued cutbacks in domestic spending, especially for basic
benefit entitlement programs.
But as one of the leaders described the prevailing view,
this may not be enough.
While the other House GOP leaders stopped short of pub
licly calling for tax increases to contain the deficit, their will
ingness to consider revenue measures is significant in light of
their resistance last year even to Reagan's modest package of
$3 billion in "revenue enhancements" for fiscal 1982. Last
fall, when deficit projections began soaring, Senate Re
publican leaders pushed for at least that much in tax in
creases but couldn't win over their House colleagues.
Eventually the administration postponed any revenue
raising action until this year.
The House Republican leaders who were interviewed
Sunday said they, too, would oppose any rollback of the 1981
tax cuts, except the provision for sale of corporate tax breaks.
But House Budget Committee Chairman James Jones (D-
Okla.) said yesterday on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation" that the
third year of the individual income tax cut, due in mid-1983,
should probably be postponed. Jones also criticized what he
called the "regressive" nature of the Reagan aides' proposals
for increased taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol.
Vets may get medical axe
Washington — The government may stop offering no
strings-attached treatment to all veterans over 65, the head
of the Veterans Administation says.
VA Administrator Robert Nimmo said he has drawn up no
specific plan for abandoning the policy, in existence since
World War 11, of treating all veterans once they reach retire
ment age. Even those who served only a few months, those
who can afford to pay and those whose ailments do not arise
from service-connected conditions are treated at no charge.
In an interview, Nimmo said he was aware his idea would
provoke a cry of protest from veterans organizations.
Currently, there are 3.3 million veterans over 65, but in 15
years there will be another 11 million, VA statistics show.
With President Reagan preparing to propose increased
charges for Medicare hospital insurance, veterans can be ex
pected to turn in increasing numbers to the VA's hospitals
for free care, Nimmo said.
Nimmo said raising the age of eligiblity to 70 was one op
tion, and offering care only to veterans with limited means is
another, but there are others.
Chilly scenes of winter
The coldest Jan. 10th on record chilled cities from Nebras
ka to New York yesterday, and cutting winds made it feel as
frigid as 80 below zero in the upper Plains and Midwest.
The wind chill factor, which combines the effect of tem
perature and wind, was calculated at 59 below zero in St.
Louis and 80 below zero in Chicago.
The extreme cold temperatures extended across the
Midwest into Pennsylvania and New York, western Maryland
and the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia.
Omaha, Neb., at 23 below zero, and Beckley, W.Va., at 13
below, were among the more than a dozen cities with record
lows for the date.
Snow fell near the Great Lakes and winter storm warnings
were posted for northern Indiana and southwestern Michi
gan.
Winter storm warnings for locally heavy snow were issued
over northern Indiana, southwestern Lower Michigan and
the shores of Lake Ontario.
Gale warnings were in effect along the New England coast.
Temperatures at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 23 below zero at
Glasgow, Mont., to 68 at Brownsville and McAllen, Texas.
For Monday, snow was forecast from central Montana to
the northern Rockies, and from from New England to Dela
ware and across the Ohio Valley.
Weather
Local weather should be fair through tomorrow with hazy
afternoons and afew patches of morning fog.

Prelate pans Pole pledges
Warsaw — The head of Poland's Roman Catholic Church,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp, told Poles yesterday they should
listen to their consciences in deciding whether to sign loyalty
pledges demanded by the communist authorities.
Echoing the words of Pope John Paul II in a sermon in the
Vatican Sunday, Glemp said no one has the right to force
people to go against their consciences. It was the second
time in less than a week that he attacked Poland's martial-law
authorities for suppression of human rights.
The issue of loyalty pledges and the dismissals of Solidarity
activists from their jobs is believed to have figured promi
nently in talks yesterday between Glemp and Poland's mili
tary leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. Apart from a brief
communique saying that the two had discussed the situation
in Poland, no details have emerged from the talks.
With the independent Solidarity trade union suspended,
the Catholic Church has emerged as a focal point of opposi
tion to the new martial-law decrees. But, while Glemp and
other church leaders have expressed their abhorrence at the
measures, they also have appealed to Poles to avoid further
bloodshed and violence.
Speaking in the church of St. Augustine in central Warsaw,
Glemp said the church was doing everything possible to help
detained Solidarity activists and their families, including
holding talks with the government.
According to official figures, more than 5000 Solidarity ac
tivists are being held in 47 internment camps around the
country. In addition, another 3000 were arrested and
charged or sentenced under specific martial-law regu
lations.
Glemp said that pressure by the authoritiesnto extract loy
alty oaths created a "problem of conscience for very many
people."
Senior Polish officials have said that "ideological veri
fication" is under way in government offices and news
papers. They defend the practice on the grounds that the
state has the right to demand loyalty from its employes.
Meanwhile, in a slight relaxation of martial law, tele
phones throughout Poland were reconnected Sunday for lo
cal calls. Poles were warned that the calls would be censored
and interrupted if conversations turned subversive.
Callers dialingsome numbers, including the Polish Roman
Catholic bishops' office, heard recorded messages saying:
"This call is being monitored."
A visitor to Bialoleka Prison in northern Warsaw, where
about 350 Solidarity activists were being held, reported
seeing dissident Jacek Kuron, who was recently transferred
from an internment camp in northern Poland. Tight police
security was enforced when Kuron and several other senior
Solidarity officials and advisers, were transferred.
Radio Warsaw Sunday reported a state of emergency
caused by heavy snow and rain west of Warsaw. The Vistula
River overflowed its banks, and thousands of residents were
being evacuated from their homes by troops, police and fire
fighters.
Haig heads tor Brussels
Brussels — Secretary of State Alexander Haig gave notice
yesterday that the United States still intended to press for al
lied sanctions against the Soviet Union as punishment for the
Soviet role in the martial-law crackdown in Poland.
And while Haig has said publicly that he did not expect the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to go as far toward
the U.S. view of the crisis as to agree now on concrete steps
to punish the Soviets, he reiterated Sunday that he would be
satisfied with what he called a "strategic framework" in
which NATO could adopt economic and political sanctions
in the future.
Speaking to reporters while en route to Brussels for today's
special meeting of NATO foreign ministers on the Poland
crisis, Haig cautioned the Europeans against being misled by
"phony moderation" by the Polish authorities, which have
recently taken steps to ease some aspects of their repressive
rule.
"We hope to set in motion a framework for active con
sideration of economic and political sanctions," Haig said.
"We do hope to discuss concrete steps."

Although the NATO talks are unlikely to yield agreement
on a single policy of trade and economic sanctions against
either the Soviet Union or Poland, a strong political declara
tion is expected to emerge. That is expected to be followed
by various measures from NATO governments in the weeks
ahead to show that business as usual with the Eastern Bloc is
impossible as long as martial law continues in Poland.
Among members of the European Common Market, sup
port is growing for a "carrot and stick" policy. This would in
volve promising Common Market aid for Poland's recovery
as soon as martail law is lifted and other political conditions
are fulfilled. Meantime, new credits would not be given and
trade would be held to a minimum.
The Europeans are also studying a suggestion that they re
duce their imports from the Soviet Union and tighten up on
loans and credits to Moscow. Such measures would even
tually affect Soviet purchases from the West. Meantime, they
would affect the Soviet balance of payments, which is al
ready in deficit.
Haig on Sunday repeated the administration view that it
would be a tragedy if the situation in Poland led to splitting
the United States from its West European allies. But Haig
made clear the administration would act alone if it had to.
Polish Minister arrives in Moscow
Moscow — Polish Foreign Minister Jozef Czyrek arrived in
Moscow yesterday on an official visit that is expected to
focus on consultations with Kremlin leaders.
Diplomatic observers here said the trip, coupled with the
easing of martial-law restrictions in Poland, seemed to be an
effort to demonstrate a gradual restoration of normalcy in
the country.
East European sources said Czyrek's visit could also be in
terpreted as reflecting the need to coordinate policies be
tween Moscow and Warsaw in the face of continued
Western criticism and President Reagan's economic sanc
tions.
The Soviets have repeatedly denounced the Reagan ad
ministration for allegedly seeking to use Poland to increase
international tensions. Moscow had warned that it would
take retaliatory action against those NATO countries that
"succumb" to U.S. pressure for economic sanctions.
An authoritative Kremlin commentary yesterday, how
ever, clearly stated that Moscow was interested in the lower
ing of the international temperature.
It was not known which side initiated Czyrek's visit, but it is
expected that the Polish official will publicly reject the
Western contention that Moscow, rather than the Polish
leadership, was responsible for the military crackdown.
Czyrek was met yesterday by Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko.
While they have sought to avoid any impression of in
terferring in Polish affairs, the Soviets have made it abun
dantly clear that they would like to see the Polish Communist
Party regenerate itself, assume its leading role and take back
the reins of power from the armed forces.
Republicans reappraise revenue
Washington — House Republican leaders, jarred by stag
gering budget deficit projections into a reappraisal of their
opposition to tax increases, are urging the Reagan adminis
tration to consider some major revenue-raising measures to
keep deficits below $100 billion over the next few years.
Among their suggestions are a tax on the proceeds from
further decontrol of natural-gas prices, a tightening of the
minimum income tax, repeal of the tax provision approved
last year allowing corporations to sell their tax breaks and a
tax on imported oil, according to several of the leaders.
They reportedly have mixed feelings about proposals by
presidential aides to increase federal excise taxes on Alcohol,
tobacco and gasoline.
A group of leading House Republicans, including Minor
ity Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.) met Thursday with Office of
Management and Budget Director David Stockman. Accord
ing to three of the participants, they came away with the con
clusion that raising taxes may be the only way to avoid politi
cally intolerable deficits for the foreseeable future.
Some were also described as favoring a slow-down in the

huge planned increase in defense spending, along with con
tinued cutbacks in domestic spending, especially for basic
benefit entitlement programs.
But as one of the leaders described the prevailing view,
this may not be enough.
While the other House GOP leaders stopped short of pub
licly calling for tax increases to contain the deficit, their will
ingness to consider revenue measures is significant in light of
their resistance last year even to Reagan's modest package of
$3 billion in "revenue enhancements" for fiscal 1982. Last
fall, when deficit projections began soaring, Senate Re
publican leaders pushed for at least that much in tax in
creases but couldn't win over their House colleagues.
Eventually the administration postponed any revenue
raising action until this year.
The House Republican leaders who were interviewed
Sunday said they, too, would oppose any rollback of the 1981
tax cuts, except the provision for sale of corporate tax breaks.
But House Budget Committee Chairman James Jones (D-
Okla.) said yesterday on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation" that the
third year of the individual income tax cut, due in mid-1983,
should probably be postponed. Jones also criticized what he
called the "regressive" nature of the Reagan aides' proposals
for increased taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol.
Vets may get medical axe
Washington — The government may stop offering no
strings-attached treatment to all veterans over 65, the head
of the Veterans Administation says.
VA Administrator Robert Nimmo said he has drawn up no
specific plan for abandoning the policy, in existence since
World War 11, of treating all veterans once they reach retire
ment age. Even those who served only a few months, those
who can afford to pay and those whose ailments do not arise
from service-connected conditions are treated at no charge.
In an interview, Nimmo said he was aware his idea would
provoke a cry of protest from veterans organizations.
Currently, there are 3.3 million veterans over 65, but in 15
years there will be another 11 million, VA statistics show.
With President Reagan preparing to propose increased
charges for Medicare hospital insurance, veterans can be ex
pected to turn in increasing numbers to the VA's hospitals
for free care, Nimmo said.
Nimmo said raising the age of eligiblity to 70 was one op
tion, and offering care only to veterans with limited means is
another, but there are others.
Chilly scenes of winter
The coldest Jan. 10th on record chilled cities from Nebras
ka to New York yesterday, and cutting winds made it feel as
frigid as 80 below zero in the upper Plains and Midwest.
The wind chill factor, which combines the effect of tem
perature and wind, was calculated at 59 below zero in St.
Louis and 80 below zero in Chicago.
The extreme cold temperatures extended across the
Midwest into Pennsylvania and New York, western Maryland
and the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia.
Omaha, Neb., at 23 below zero, and Beckley, W.Va., at 13
below, were among the more than a dozen cities with record

Prelate pans Pole pledges
Warsaw — The head of Poland's Roman Catholic Church,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp, told Poles yesterday they should
listen to their consciences in deciding whether to sign loyalty
pledges demanded by the communist authorities.
Echoing the words of Pope John Paul II in a sermon in the
Vatican Sunday, Glemp said no one has the right to force
people to go against their consciences. It was the second
time in less than a week that he attacked Poland's martial-law
authorities for suppression of human rights.
The issue of loyalty pledges and the dismissals of Solidarity
activists from their jobs is believed to have figured promi
nently in talks yesterday between Glemp and Poland's mili
tary leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. Apart from a brief
communique saying that the two had discussed the situation
in Poland, no details have emerged from the talks.
With the independent Solidarity trade union suspended,
the Catholic Church has emerged as a focal point of opposi
tion to the new martial-law decrees. But, while Glemp and
other church leaders have expressed their abhorrence at the
measures, they also have appealed to Poles to avoid further
bloodshed and violence.
Speaking in the church of St. Augustine in central Warsaw,
Glemp said the church was doing everything possible to help
detained Solidarity activists and their families, including
holding talks with the government.
According to official figures, more than 5000 Solidarity ac
tivists are being held in 47 internment camps around the
country. In addition, another 3000 were arrested and
charged or sentenced under specific martial-law regu
lations.
Glemp said that pressure by the authoritiesnto extract loy
alty oaths created a "problem of conscience for very many
people."
Senior Polish officials have said that "ideological veri
fication" is under way in government offices and news
papers. They defend the practice on the grounds that the
state has the right to demand loyalty from its employes.
Meanwhile, in a slight relaxation of martial law, tele
phones throughout Poland were reconnected Sunday for lo
cal calls. Poles were warned that the calls would be censored
and interrupted if conversations turned subversive.
Callers dialingsome numbers, including the Polish Roman
Catholic bishops' office, heard recorded messages saying:
"This call is being monitored."
A visitor to Bialoleka Prison in northern Warsaw, where
about 350 Solidarity activists were being held, reported
seeing dissident Jacek Kuron, who was recently transferred
from an internment camp in northern Poland. Tight police
security was enforced when Kuron and several other senior
Solidarity officials and advisers, were transferred.
Radio Warsaw Sunday reported a state of emergency
caused by heavy snow and rain west of Warsaw. The Vistula
River overflowed its banks, and thousands of residents were
being evacuated from their homes by troops, police and fire
fighters.
Haig heads tor Brussels
Brussels — Secretary of State Alexander Haig gave notice
yesterday that the United States still intended to press for al
lied sanctions against the Soviet Union as punishment for the
Soviet role in the martial-law crackdown in Poland.
And while Haig has said publicly that he did not expect the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies to go as far toward
the U.S. view of the crisis as to agree now on concrete steps
to punish the Soviets, he reiterated Sunday that he would be
satisfied with what he called a "strategic framework" in
which NATO could adopt economic and political sanctions
in the future.
Speaking to reporters while en route to Brussels for today's
special meeting of NATO foreign ministers on the Poland
crisis, Haig cautioned the Europeans against being misled by
"phony moderation" by the Polish authorities, which have
recently taken steps to ease some aspects of their repressive
rule.
"We hope to set in motion a framework for active con
sideration of economic and political sanctions," Haig said.
"We do hope to discuss concrete steps."

Although the NATO talks are unlikely to yield agreement
on a single policy of trade and economic sanctions against
either the Soviet Union or Poland, a strong political declara
tion is expected to emerge. That is expected to be followed
by various measures from NATO governments in the weeks
ahead to show that business as usual with the Eastern Bloc is
impossible as long as martial law continues in Poland.
Among members of the European Common Market, sup
port is growing for a "carrot and stick" policy. This would in
volve promising Common Market aid for Poland's recovery
as soon as martail law is lifted and other political conditions
are fulfilled. Meantime, new credits would not be given and
trade would be held to a minimum.
The Europeans are also studying a suggestion that they re
duce their imports from the Soviet Union and tighten up on
loans and credits to Moscow. Such measures would even
tually affect Soviet purchases from the West. Meantime, they
would affect the Soviet balance of payments, which is al
ready in deficit.
Haig on Sunday repeated the administration view that it
would be a tragedy if the situation in Poland led to splitting
the United States from its West European allies. But Haig
made clear the administration would act alone if it had to.
Polish Minister arrives in Moscow
Moscow — Polish Foreign Minister Jozef Czyrek arrived in
Moscow yesterday on an official visit that is expected to
focus on consultations with Kremlin leaders.
Diplomatic observers here said the trip, coupled with the
easing of martial-law restrictions in Poland, seemed to be an
effort to demonstrate a gradual restoration of normalcy in
the country.
East European sources said Czyrek's visit could also be in
terpreted as reflecting the need to coordinate policies be
tween Moscow and Warsaw in the face of continued
Western criticism and President Reagan's economic sanc
tions.
The Soviets have repeatedly denounced the Reagan ad
ministration for allegedly seeking to use Poland to increase
international tensions. Moscow had warned that it would
take retaliatory action against those NATO countries that
"succumb" to U.S. pressure for economic sanctions.
An authoritative Kremlin commentary yesterday, how
ever, clearly stated that Moscow was interested in the lower
ing of the international temperature.
It was not known which side initiated Czyrek's visit, but it is
expected that the Polish official will publicly reject the
Western contention that Moscow, rather than the Polish
leadership, was responsible for the military crackdown.
Czyrek was met yesterday by Soviet Foreign Minister An
drei Gromyko.
While they have sought to avoid any impression of in
terferring in Polish affairs, the Soviets have made it abun
dantly clear that they would like to see the Polish Communist
Party regenerate itself, assume its leading role and take back
the reins of power from the armed forces.
Republicans reappraise revenue
Washington — House Republican leaders, jarred by stag
gering budget deficit projections into a reappraisal of their
opposition to tax increases, are urging the Reagan adminis
tration to consider some major revenue-raising measures to
keep deficits below $100 billion over the next few years.
Among their suggestions are a tax on the proceeds from
further decontrol of natural-gas prices, a tightening of the
minimum income tax, repeal of the tax provision approved
last year allowing corporations to sell their tax breaks and a
tax on imported oil, according to several of the leaders.
They reportedly have mixed feelings about proposals by
presidential aides to increase federal excise taxes on Alcohol,
tobacco and gasoline.
A group of leading House Republicans, including Minor
ity Leader Robert Michel (R-lll.) met Thursday with Office of
Management and Budget Director David Stockman. Accord
ing to three of the participants, they came away with the con
clusion that raising taxes may be the only way to avoid politi
cally intolerable deficits for the foreseeable future.
Some were also described as favoring a slow-down in the

huge planned increase in defense spending, along with con
tinued cutbacks in domestic spending, especially for basic
benefit entitlement programs.
But as one of the leaders described the prevailing view,
this may not be enough.
While the other House GOP leaders stopped short of pub
licly calling for tax increases to contain the deficit, their will
ingness to consider revenue measures is significant in light of
their resistance last year even to Reagan's modest package of
$3 billion in "revenue enhancements" for fiscal 1982. Last
fall, when deficit projections began soaring, Senate Re
publican leaders pushed for at least that much in tax in
creases but couldn't win over their House colleagues.
Eventually the administration postponed any revenue
raising action until this year.
The House Republican leaders who were interviewed
Sunday said they, too, would oppose any rollback of the 1981
tax cuts, except the provision for sale of corporate tax breaks.
But House Budget Committee Chairman James Jones (D-
Okla.) said yesterday on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation" that the
third year of the individual income tax cut, due in mid-1983,
should probably be postponed. Jones also criticized what he
called the "regressive" nature of the Reagan aides' proposals
for increased taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol.
Vets may get medical axe
Washington — The government may stop offering no
strings-attached treatment to all veterans over 65, the head
of the Veterans Administation says.
VA Administrator Robert Nimmo said he has drawn up no
specific plan for abandoning the policy, in existence since
World War 11, of treating all veterans once they reach retire
ment age. Even those who served only a few months, those
who can afford to pay and those whose ailments do not arise
from service-connected conditions are treated at no charge.
In an interview, Nimmo said he was aware his idea would
provoke a cry of protest from veterans organizations.
Currently, there are 3.3 million veterans over 65, but in 15
years there will be another 11 million, VA statistics show.
With President Reagan preparing to propose increased
charges for Medicare hospital insurance, veterans can be ex
pected to turn in increasing numbers to the VA's hospitals
for free care, Nimmo said.

for increased taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol.
Vets may get medical axe
Washington — The government may stop offering no
strings-attached treatment to all veterans over 65, the head
of the Veterans Administation says.
VA Administrator Robert Nimmo said he has drawn up no
specific plan for abandoning the policy, in existence since
World War 11, of treating all veterans once they reach retire
ment age. Even those who served only a few months, those
who can afford to pay and those whose ailments do not arise
from service-connected conditions are treated at no charge.
In an interview, Nimmo said he was aware his idea would
provoke a cry of protest from veterans organizations.
Currently, there are 3.3 million veterans over 65, but in 15
years there will be another 11 million, VA statistics show.
With President Reagan preparing to propose increased
charges for Medicare hospital insurance, veterans can be ex
pected to turn in increasing numbers to the VA's hospitals
for free care, Nimmo said.
Nimmo said raising the age of eligiblity to 70 was one op
tion, and offering care only to veterans with limited means is
another, but there are others.
