# Student groups attack decision on registration
## 
### Todd Pickett 
President Ronald Reagan's de
cision Thursday to continue draft reg
istration has drawn sharp criticisms
and vows of continued re-istance
from Stanford Against Conscription
(SAC) and other campus organiza
tions that support non-registrants.
Thursday's announcement by Rea
gan is a reversal of his previous stand
which labeled draft registration as
destructive to the values of American
society.
In flyers hastily prepared and dis
tributed on Friday, SAC denounced
Reagan's policy as contradictory and
dishonest. The flyers also included a
portion of a letter to Senator Mark
Hatfield (R-Ore.) in which Reagan
stated, "Only in the most severe na
tional emergency does the govern
ment have a claim to the mandatory
service of its young peole. In any oth
er time, a draft or draft registration
destroys the very values that our soci
ety is committed to defending." The
letter was written in March 1980.
SAC member Paul Bare speculated
that Reagan's initial position against
registration may have been sincere
but pressure from Secretary of State
Alexander Haig and Secretary of De
fense Caspar Weinberger forced the
announcement as a response to Rus
sian intervention in Poland.
Initial criticism
Bare added that Reagan had
criticized the initial enactment of
registration by former President Jim
my Carter as an empty response to
the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.
SAC member Larry Ausubel said
the move didn't surprise him. "Rea

gan has kept his promises only to the
rich and powerful," he said. "He nev
er had any intention of eliminating
registration."
According to Ausubel, SAC plans
to continue its opposition to regis
tration by distributing leaflets, spon
soring rallies and educating students
through its publication, The Draft
Times.
Registration rejected
He said approximately 20 percent
of the students here who have been
required to register since July 1980
have not done so. He said this is evi
dence that SAC's efforts have suc
ceeded to some degree.
Phil Ansell, a member of the Dem
ocratic Socialist Organizing Commit
tee (DSOC), said his organization
would continue to support those stu
dents who are non-registrants,
though DSOC has been prohibited
by national headquarters from open
ly encouraging resistance.
According to Ansell, an American
foreign policy based on corporate in
terests, rather than on the interests of
the American people, has been the
motivating force behind increased
militarism and a reinstatement of reg
istration.
Corporate link
Ansell stressed that DSOC opposi
tion to the draft exists because of this
suspected link with corporate in
fluence. Another political and his
torical context might make an in
voluntary army legitimate, he said.
The Stanford Libertarians main
tain, according to a statement read at
the Dec. 11 rally on behalf of non-
registrants, that "the draft is nothing
other than involuntary servitude, or,
in a word, slavery."
"It is a philosophical objection,"
said Stanford Libertarian coordinator
Glenn Pullen. The defense of a free
society with a slave army remains a
gross contradiction, he said. Pullen
said the Stanford Libertarians would
continue to aid in educating students
on tho issues of draft registration.
Minstries supportive
Campus minister Byron Bland,
speaking for the United Campus
Christian Ministries (UCCM), said
that t he UCCM supports those stu
dents who, as a matter of conscience,
refuse to register. Although the
UCCM actively campaigns for world
peact? through lectures and films
probing the theology of peace and
the dangers of a nuclear arms
build up, the coalition of ministries
does not advocate draft resistance,
said Uland.
He said that although registration
is a crucial decision for the individ
ual, i.he UCCM does not view re
sistance as a major means of ac
complishing world peace.
