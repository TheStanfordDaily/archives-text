Initial reports that a suspect meet
ing the description of the campus
rapist was arrested late Saturday
night were denied by Stanford police
yesterday.
Officer Theodore Hopgood, the
officer on duty at the Santa Clara
North County communications cen
ter this morning, said that although
the police arrested a person whom
they initially believed to match the
composite drawing, they did not
charge him with the rapes, because
he "just doesn't meet the descrip
tion."
The man was charged with resist
ing an officer in performance of his
duty and then released on bail, ac
cording to Hopgood.

The man wasapprehended outside
of Stern Hall at the corner nearest the
Law School after a foot chase, accord
ing to David Lempert, a law/business
graduate student who witnessed the
arrest.
The police were assisted in the ar
rest by Terry Jackson, a freshman
who was on his way to a party when
he heard the police shouting and saw
signs of a chase. "As I came out of the
building, I heard a siren and saw a
black guy running. I heard the police
yelling, 'Stop him! Stop him!' " said
Jackson, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall, 240
lbs., and the starting noseguard on
the football team. "So I turned
around and ran and grabbed him."
Jackson said the police told the
man to lie down on the ground and
then handcuffed him. "When I asked
the police what he had done, they
wouldn't tell me anything," Jackson
said.
Ac cording to Jackson, one of the
officers asked the suspect why he had
run I' rom them, and the man replied
by s<lying that he had been smoking
marijuana.
Th e police were unwilling to give
any iinformation about the arrest or
the reasons for suspecting the indi
vidual in the first place.
However, they maintained that the
man in question was not arrested be
cause he was a rape suspect.
Jackson said that one of the officers
than ked him for his assistance, asked
for !n,is name, and promised to write
to "the dean and the president of the
Unit ed States about him. I didn't take
that seriously though," said Jackson.
