# Report of captured rapist unfounded
## 
### 
Initial reports that a suspect meet
ing the description of the campus
rapist was arrested late Saturday
night were denied by Stanford police
yesterday.
Officer Theodore Hopgood, the
officer on duty at the Santa Clara
North County communications cen
ter this morning, said that although
the police arrested a person whom
they initially believed to match the
composite drawing, they did not
charge him with the rapes, because
he "just doesn't meet the descrip
tion."
The man was charged with resist
ing an officer in performance of his
duty and then released on bail, ac
cording to Hopgood.

The man wasapprehended outside
of Stern Hall at the corner nearest the
Law School after a foot chase, accord
ing to David Lempert, a law/business
graduate student who witnessed the
arrest.
The police were assisted in the ar
rest by Terry Jackson, a freshman
who was on his way to a party when
he heard the police shouting and saw
signs of a chase. "As I came out of the
building, I heard a siren and saw a
black guy running. I heard the police
yelling, 'Stop him! Stop him!' " said
Jackson, who is 6 feet 7 inches tall, 240
lbs., and the starting noseguard on
the football team. "So I turned
around and ran and grabbed him."
