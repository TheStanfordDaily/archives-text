# Attempt to steal axe foiled; Card retains coveted prize
## 
### 
Two unidentified men with a
sledge hammer attempted Satur
day to steal the coveted axe, sym
bol of the annual football rivalry
between Stanford and UC-
Berkeley (Cal), from its display
case in Tresidder Union, accord
ing to Sgt Philip Love of the Stan
ford police.
The University regained the
axe, which annually goes to the
winner of the Big Game, in No
vember after the Cardinals
crushed the Bears (otherwise
known as the "Cal Weenies")
42-21. Berkeley had held the axe
since November 1979.
Love said that the police re
ceived an alarm call around 3:30
p.m. "We found that someone
had taken a sledge hammer and
attempted to break into the dis
play case and take the axe," he
said.
Love called it a "very crude at
tempt" to get the axe. He said the
whole case and the axe have been
temoved, but declined to say
where it is being held while the
case is being repaired.
He asked that anyone who saw
anything suspicious in the Tres
idder area Saturday to inform the
police.
The axe was originally brought
out by a Stanford cheeleader at a

mained at Cal for the next 31 years
before being retrieved in a
gangster-style raid and returned
to the Farm on April 3, 1930. In
1933, both schools decided to
award the axe to the annual win
ner of the Big Game.
The tradition of keeping or re
claiming the axe is only part of the
activity associated with Big Game
week here. Events include noon

baseball game in 1879. It was sto
len by Berkeley that day and re
concerts at Tresidder, a fireworks
display at Lake Lagunita on the
Thursday before Big Game,
Gaieties, the annual student musi
cal production which humorously
portrays University life and the Big
Game rivalry, and the Friday night
rally and march in San Francisco
with the Band.
