### 
Beirut, Lebanon (AP) â€” The
Iranian government has pub
lished in book form what it de
scribes as secret U.S. docu
ments seized by militant stu
dents who took over the Amer
ican Embassy in Tehran in No
vember, 1979, travelers from
Iran report.
They say the 12-volume
series in Farsi, the language of
Iran, is being sold in bookshops
in Tehran. The publications are
finding their way abroad as
well, with some having been
seized by the FBI from travelers
entering the United States.
One volume of the series is

an English-language version
entitled "Documents from the
American Spy Den in Tehran,"
printed by the Iranian Embassy
in Beirut. That volume and oth
ers in Farsi were obtained by
The Associated Press.
An Iranian official in Beirut,
who declined to be identified,
said the embassy planned to
distribute the booklets to for
eign embassies, news organiza
tions and students in the Leba
nese capital.
In a preface to one Farsi-lan
guage volume, Moslem stu
dent followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini give their

reasons for assembling the
documents. "We ... find it our
duty to publish these docu
ments which are proofs of the
all-side political, military and
economic sovereignty of the
great satan over our country,"
it said.
The English-language vol
ume, numbered 11 in the series
with a yellow cover and the
eagle seal of the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency, is 95
pages concentrating on Israel
and its relations with Iran dur
ing the reign of the late-Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Secret messages
The book includes what are
described as telexes coded "se
cret" from the U.S. State De
partment to various missions
around the world, accounts of
conversations held in Tehran
between U.S. diplomats and Is
raeli officials, confidential re
ports and biographies and the
correspondence of the last U.S.

ambassador in Tehran, William
Sullivan.
One document, presented
as a letter dated Feb. 19, 1978,
has Sullivan sending a U.S.
State Department evaluation of
a Washington visit by (the late)
Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe
Dayan to Amir Abbas Hoveyda,
a former Iranian prime minister
who was then minister to the
imperial court.
The booklet also contains
what is identified as a U.S. gov
ernment biography of Yitzhak
Rabin, then Israel's prime min
ister. Another document pre
sented in the collection is a 47-
page profile of Israel's in
telligence agencies and their
leading figures.
When the U.S. Embassy was
seized Nov. 4,1979, some clas
sified documents were known
to have been hurriedly burned
or shredded by U.S. personnel
but others were seized intact.
