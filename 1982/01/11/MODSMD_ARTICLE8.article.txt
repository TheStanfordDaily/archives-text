# Ghana has murky future

### 
Abidjan, Ivory Coast (AP) —
More than a week after Gha
na's civilian government was
overthrown, it is still unclear
who is running the West
African nation and how its stag
gering economic problems will
solved.
Former Air Force Lt. Jerry
Rawlings, the apparent head of
the new regime, said after the
Dec. 31 coup that it would
transform Ghana's economic
and social order.
The tone of subsequent an
nouncements has led diplo
matic observers here to believe
Ghana's ruling Provisional Na
tional Defense Council favors a
radical approach and scrap
ping European-style parlia
mentary democracy.
Ghana, a nation of more than
12 million, was the first African
colony to become independ
ent when Britain relinquished
its rule 25 years ago. Political
parties have now been banned,
the constitution suspended
and the Parliament dismissed.
Former President Hilla
Limann is under arrest. Former
Vice President William De
graft-Johnson, at least 11 gov
ernment ministers and more
than 60 other leading political
figures have turned themselves
over to police "for their own
protection," according to Ac

cra radio. Their financial assets
have been frozen.
The PNDC has announced
that people's tribunals would
try former officials accused of
corruption, and that people's
defense councils would be or
ganized to defend the revolu
tion. Rawlings' politics seem to
bea mixtureof Third World na
tionalism, Marxism and Chris
tian morality.
In his first publicappearance
since the coup, Rawlings told a
rally Friday broadcasted over
radio, that "no one in society
has a right to have more than
his basic needs when other
productive workers can hardly
get their's."
Inflation has been running at
over 120 percent and the cedi,
the national currency, is nearly
worthless. As of last June, Gha
na had only $80 million in for
eign reserves and an outstand
ing oil import bill of $350 mil
lion.
At one time, Ghana was the
world's leading cocoa pro
ducer, but production has
fallen 50 percent in the past 10
years because of aging stock,
falling prices and poor market
ing facilities. Lack of capital and
management expertise also
prevent Ghana from being a
major world gold producer.
