# Palo Alto City Council votes in new mayor, rent measure
## Landlords must offer 1-yr. leases 
### Tim Lundergan 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night approved an ordinance requir
ing landlords to offer prospective
tenants a minimum one-year lease.
The ordinance, which passed by a 5
to 3 vote with one abstention, re
quires landlords to "offer a written
lease which has a minimum term of
one year." City Council member
Betsy Bechtel, who supported the
measure during its first reading in
December 1980, said the tenant does
not have to accept a minimum one
year lease and can opt for a shorter
lease.
Stanford students looking for off
campus housing and other renters
would have to reject the one-year of
fer in writing before negotiating
either a written or oral agreement on
a shorter lease.
Bechtel said the measure was de
signed to "give tenants an idea of
what to expect so they can plan for
any rent increases." Under this new
ordinance, landlords will have to
notifytheirtenantswell in advance of
any rent hike.
Increase notice required
The ordinance states that the land
lord must specify the rent he will
charge during the term of the lease,
and, if the landlord intends to in
crease the rent when the lease ex
pires, 60 days notice is required. This
provision will not protect renters in
owner-occupied residences who
take out leases for less than a year.
The purpose of the rental housing
stabilization ordinance, 4s. written, is
to offer "some assurance of stability
under the terms of a written lease so
as to minimize displacement of ten
ants into a rental housing market
which affords them few and ex
pensive options."
New Palo Alto Mayor Fred Eyerly
called the measure "self-defeating."
He said Palo Alto has constructed no
new rental housing for several years,
and that a mandatory lease require
ment is a step toward rent control,
which potential builders oppose.
Therefore, by discouraging new con
struction, the measure will ex
acerbate the tight housing situation
as, in part, it was designed.
Discouragement to builders?
Eyerly also said that between 60
and 70 percent of the city's rental
stock consisted of single family resi
dential units. In many cases, residents
who move from Palo Alto rent their
houses with the intention of return
ing someday. Eyerly said that while
large renters who have offices do not
mind the extra paperwork, single
unit renters "don't want to speak to a
bureaucracy."


THREE BALLOTS, ONE STEP â€” Newly-elected Palo Alto Mayor Fred Eyerly took his seat in the City Coun
cil chambers last night after what some say was an upset over fellow council member Leland Levy. Eyerly
has been a member of the council for almost seven years.
