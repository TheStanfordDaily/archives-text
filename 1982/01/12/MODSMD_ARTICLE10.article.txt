# I-Center's Australian week: learning through food, fun
## 
### Bob Cohn 
If you think Australia is merely kangaroos
and koalas, a visit to Stanford's Bechtel In
ternational Center sometime this week will
prove you wrong. The l-Center is sponsoring
various activities, lectures, films and artwork
on Australia this week.
"We're kicking off the winter quarter pro
grams with 'Australia Week,'" said Lee
Ziegler, director of the l-Center. He ex
plained that the purpose of the week is to
"draw attention to Australia — a major ally
and country that we know all too little
about."
Besides an Australian art exhibit, which will
remain at Stanford through January, the I-
Center is hosting a luncheon lecture today
that features L. Gerald Sellars, Australia's con
sul general, a film series on Thursday evening,
and a special Australian supper on Sunday.
The art exhibit features ink drawings of
Australia by Louis Frangione, a Stanford mas
ter of Fine Arts and resident of Australia since
1971. "His ink drawings of scenes from Aus
tralia," according to Ziegler, "are a very
pleasant and original show depicting the di
versity of the country."
The highlight of the week, according to
Ziegler, will be today's luncheon lecture.
Sellars, a man with experience as Australian
ambassador to Portugal, foreign service of
ficer and chief of protocol in the Australian

Department of Foreign Affairs besides his
present role as consul general, will speak on
Australian foreign policy.
The "Other Cultures Thursday Film Series"
will offer three Australian movies — "Fron
tiers Downunder," "Alice Springs — Red
Heart, Blue Center," and"The Land My
Mother." Zieglersaid that these are "outstan
ding documentaries of Australian cinemato
graphies."
The final event of the week will be a stu
dent-prepared meal of Australian cuisine
served at the l-Center.
Among those who will be attending will be
some of Stanford's resident Australian "ex
perts." The University has 33 Australian stu
dents and an additional 30 presently doing
post-graduate work. Ziegler said he hopes to
attract between 75 and 100 students, staff and
faculty to each of the varied events.
Australia Week is only the first of a series at
the Bechtel IntemationalCenter this quarter.
Ziegler said that Bechtel is "the major center
for international activity on campus; it offers
a chance to get American students and for
eign scholars together," The center will be
showing films on China, Kenya, Austria,
Japan, International Art, European Architec
ture and the environmental issues in upcom
ing months along with its Tuesday luncheons,
discussion groups, classes in English and the
arts, and excursions.
