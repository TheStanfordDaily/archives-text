At a time when fraternities here receive
attention for possessing stolen furniture or
being disciplined by the University, it is
important to praise a fraternity when it acts
positively. The Kappa Sigma fraternity acted as
any Stanford organization should by forfeiting
its charter rather than reinstate what it
considered the objectionable passages of its
initiation ceremony.
The entire University communityshould
support the fraternity's display of independence
and sensitivity toward its current and future
members who might be offended by the
disputed passages. While it is difficult to
determine exactly how noble this well
publicized action was because details of the
rituals remain obscure, it is nevertheless
significant that the local chapter was willing to
break its ties with the national organization over

the issue.
While Stanford members of the Kappa Sigma
fraternity have been spared the insulting parts of
the ritual, it is unfortunate that the campus
chapter did not assume a leading role in
deleting the passages from all Kappa Sigma
chapters' rituals. The campus chapter recently
had that opportunity when the M.I.T. Kappa
Sigma chapter sponsored a resolution to delete
the passages altogether, but the Stanford
chapter declined to support the resolution.
The Kappa Sigma decision should serve as an
example to all fraternities that still possess
initiation ceremonies. The Kappa Sigma
fraternity sincerely examined the merits of the
language of its oath, and all fraternities should
take the same action to remove any appearance
of discrimination or arbitrary social exclusion.
