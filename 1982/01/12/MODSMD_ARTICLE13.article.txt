# Safety comes first
## 
### 
The recent series of assaults and rapes on
campus has greatly unsettled many local
residents. While the University has pledged to
do all that it can to ensure the safety of the
campus, much frustration and anxiety remain at
the inability to adequately protect the members
of our community.
In light of these concerns, we find the recent
decision by President Donald Kennedy to
reduce the hours of service provided by the
campus Marguerite shuttle to be a very untimely
move and one which does not live up to the
University's stated commitment. The president
has accepted the economic arguments
presented in the 1980-81 report from the
Committee on Parking and Transportation
without weighing the safety concerns that

currently face the campus.
In our opinion the University should instead
consider the potential effectiveness of
additional (well-publicized) evening hours to
better serve students in Escondido Village and
the Medical Center who need to attend classes
or use campus libraries at night.
We appreciate the University's concern for
increasing the financial effectiveness of the
Marguerite service. But to accomplish this goal,
administrators should consider usingsmaller,
more economical vehicles such as small vans
during low usage periods ratherthan slashing
the hours of the system as a whole.
Even in a time of financial constraints, safety
considerations must not be overlooked when
setting policy.
