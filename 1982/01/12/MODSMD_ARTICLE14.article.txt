## Take precautions to avoid assaults 
### 
Rape is any sexual act carried out
against a victim's will. Myths about
rape say that this violent crime is real
ly an act of lust, that women secretly
enjoy being raped, that it happens
because women ask for it. In the ster
eotypical scenario of rape, an un
known attacker lurks in dark bushes,
awaiting an unsuspecting lone wom
an. But the facts are that most victims
know their attackers, and most rapes
occur in either the victim's or the

maiming or even death, since a rapist knows
a live victim could describe him to the police.

rapist's home. Daylight rapes are as
common as night rapes. In fact, this
form of mass terrorism against wom
en is consistent with the socialization
of men and women in our society.
Men are encouraged to compete
and dominate through aggression in
athletic, political, financial, social or
sexual situations. Socialized to be
passive, women often must depend
on men for their livelihood, security
or status. Women are culturally de
graded tarjtn inferior role as men's
possessions, as the objects of male
aggression. Any woman who has ever
walked alone past a group of men
yelling, whistling or honking car

horns knows the dehumanization of
this cultural process.
Ideally, a woman should not have
to fear for her body and life every
time she goes anywhere alone. But
realistically, a woman must take more
care for her security than a man
would take.
Women, make sure that garages,
hallways, entrances and grounds
where you live are well-lit. Get a bike
light. Only take paths and park in

well-lit areas. If you must go to an
isolated area, day or night, at least tell
a friend where you will be. Lock car
doors when you are driving, and
always check the back seat before
you get in. Make repair or sales
persons, police and survey-takers at
your door show identification. Lock
ground-floor windows, and list only
initials on your mailbox or in the
phone book.
Just as it is in a woman's own in
terest to take safety precautions, it is
in her interest to be strong. Sub
mission to a rapist is no guarantee
against maiming or even death, since
a rapist knows a live victim could de

scribe him to the police. Self-defense
skills provide a woman with more op
tions for dealing with the situation.
They also give women confidence.
If you are confronted by an at
tacker, drop objects you are carrying
unless they can be used offensively.
Yell strongly from the diaphragm to
startle the rapist and alert people
nearby. Yelling "Help!" or "Fire!" is
more likely to produce results than
yelling "Rape!" Run away if you can.
Never drop to the ground volun
tarily, and get up quickly if you are
knocked down. If you are on the
ground, kick. Your legs are strong.
Your whole body can be used as a
weapon. Use fists to the face, stom
ach and groin. Kick the shin with the
toe of your shoe. Stomp or kick with
your heel, strike someone behind
you with an elbow jab. Keys or a
comb in your fist can scratch your at
tacker. Don't be afraid to bite, claw,
pinch, poke eyes and pull hair.
The suggestions above are no sub
stitute for a long-term self defense
class. In many classes, you will have to
deal with sexism from the instructor
or classmates, but you can still get
strong, skilled and confident if you
are willing to commit the time and
money necessary.
