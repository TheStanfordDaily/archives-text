## ASSU expenditures not extravagant 
### 
I was amused to read Dan Fiduc
cia's letter (Daily, Jan. 4) which ac
cused the ASSU of negotiating its
1982-4 budget on the basis of "his
torically incorrect, legally invalid and
politically outrageous" principles.
My amusement stems from the fact
that Fiduccia's letter itself contains
historically inaccurate, legally invalid
and politically outrageous
statements.
His letter is historically inaccurate
in three ways. First, although Fiduccia
corrects President Chris Greene's
statement that ASSU Special Events
made a profit in 1975 — claiming that
profits were made in 1976 — we have
written documentation to prove that

the profits were made in fiscal year
1974-1975. Second, the statement
that ASSU Travel Service encoun
tered complications in 1975 is mis
leading and of no consequence to
the ASSU's current financial position.
The fact of the matter is that in 1975
ASSU Travel Service made $36,000
and ASSU Special Events made
$50,000 — $86,000 which we do not
have today.
Finally, Fiduccia's statement that
ASSU senior officers receive in excess
of $15,000 a year is misleading and in
accurate. In fact, they earn $22,000 —
which breaks down to $2.00 per hour
per officer; half the wages of a uni
versity hasher.

Fiduccia's letter is legally mislead
ing in three ways. First, he calls upon
the ASSU to use its "$400,000" en
dowment (actually $350,000) to cover
its costs, when we are prohibited
from spending the principle both by
agreement and by common sense.
Instead, we may only spend the in
terest of the endowment which, after
re-investment, amounts to $25,000,
one-quarter of the operating budget.
Second, Fiduccia insists that a former
president intended that the ASSU
should not continue receiving fund
ing from the University. Why then, I
ask, is there an explicit provision for
budget negotiation and the augmen
tation of the $123,000 originally
agreed upon by the Board of Trustees
and the student body. Finally, Fiduc
cia treats the Constitution as if it were
not a legally binding contract, al
though legal counsel has specified
that it is. We have only asked that the
stipulations of the contract be met
and that the University reconsider
the fact that the ASSU receives less
money for operating expenses today
than it did in 1971 — not compensat
ing for the depreciation of the U.S.
dollar.
Perhaps the most disturbing part of
Fiduccia's letter is his failure to see
student representation as an in
herent part of a democratic Univer
sity in a democratic society. Current
ly student representation exists be
cause of the relative success of As
sociation projects. The University has

an obligation to insure the long-term
existence of the representative arms
of all three University constituencies
— the students, faculty and staff.

Marguerite cutbacks
I would like to criticize the further
reductions in Marguerite service.
Those responsible would do well to
consider expanding rather than re
ducing service if they truly wish to aid
frustrated drivers and anxious poten
tial rape victims.
Parking in the less-congested out
lying lots used to be acceptable when
one could catch a Marguerite to cen
tral campus. If I could benefit from
the bus service in this way I would
certainly not object to supporting it
with my parking fee. In fact, what else
is the fee for?
Furthermore, evening service
would greatly contribute to campus
safety here as it has at other univer
sities.
I can understand that the present
infrequent service, in one direction
around an inconveniently long route
by generally empty smoke-belching
behemoths is uneconomical and un
derused. Better service should be de
manded.

ask, is there an explicit provision for
budget negotiation and the augmen
tation of the $123,000 originally
agreed upon by the Board of Trustees
and the student body. Finally, Fiduc

not a legally binding contract, al
though legal counsel has specified
that it is. We have only asked that the
stipulations of the contract be met
and that the University reconsider
the fact that the ASSU receives less
money for operating expenses today
than it did in 1971 — not compensat
ing for the depreciation of the U.S.
dollar.
Perhaps the most disturbing part of
Fiduccia's letter is his failure to see
student representation as an in

ly student representation exists be
cause of the relative success of As

an obligation to insure the long-term
existence of the representative arms
of all three University constituencies
— the students, faculty and staff.

I was amused to read Dan Fiduc
cia's letter (Daily, Jan. 4) which ac
cused the ASSU of negotiating its
1982-4 budget on the basis of "his
torically incorrect, legally invalid and
politically outrageous" principles.
My amusement stems from the fact
that Fiduccia's letter itself contains
historically inaccurate, legally invalid
and politically outrageous
statements.
His letter is historically inaccurate
in three ways. First, although Fiduccia
corrects President Chris Greene's
statement that ASSU Special Events
made a profit in 1975 — claiming that
profits were made in 1976 — we have
written documentation to prove that

the profits were made in fiscal year
1974-1975. Second, the statement
that ASSU Travel Service encoun
tered complications in 1975 is mis
leading and of no consequence to
the ASSU's current financial position.
The fact of the matter is that in 1975
ASSU Travel Service made $36,000
and ASSU Special Events made
$50,000 — $86,000 which we do not
have today.
Finally, Fiduccia's statement that
ASSU senior officers receive in excess
of $15,000 a year is misleading and in
accurate. In fact, they earn $22,000 —
which breaks down to $2.00 per hour
per officer; half the wages of a uni
versity hasher.

Fiduccia's letter is legally mislead
ing in three ways. First, he calls upon
the ASSU to use its "$400,000" en
dowment (actually $350,000) to cover
its costs, when we are prohibited
from spending the principle both by
agreement and by common sense.
Instead, we may only spend the in
terest of the endowment which, after
re-investment, amounts to $25,000,
one-quarter of the operating budget.
Second, Fiduccia insists that a former
president intended that the ASSU
should not continue receiving fund
ing from the University. Why then, I
ask, is there an explicit provision for
budget negotiation and the augmen
tation of the $123,000 originally
agreed upon by the Board of Trustees
and the student body. Finally, Fiduc
cia treats the Constitution as if it were
not a legally binding contract, al
though legal counsel has specified
that it is. We have only asked that the
stipulations of the contract be met
and that the University reconsider
the fact that the ASSU receives less
money for operating expenses today
than it did in 1971 — not compensat
ing for the depreciation of the U.S.
dollar.
