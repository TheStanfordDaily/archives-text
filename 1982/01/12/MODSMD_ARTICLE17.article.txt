## What motivates candidates? 
### 
When Senator Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) announced Thursday the for
mation of a committee to explore the
possibility of his running for presi
dent in 1984, he cited as reasons for
his decision both his horror at Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's performance
to date and his lack of "awe" regard
ing other possible Democratic con
tenders. Hisclaim that his "abilities to
do the job at least match theirs" is
surprisingly modest, but for the most
part this is a standard explanation giv
en in declaring candidacy for the of
fice.
Why, in fact, does a person make
the decision to run for president?
Leaving aside those who do so simply
to build name recognition for the
future, is it truly the professed sense
of duty which gives the incentive to
launch a political campaign, as op
posed to personal ambition, or is it
some combination of the two?
Certainly it is possible to be
motivated by duty absent of ambi
tion. The latter is necessary to suc
cess, and of course no one would
take on the onerous job of the presi
dency unless they truly wished to do
so. Perhaps less obviously, neither is
personal ambition likely to be unac
companied by some sense of an
altruistic mission. Politics is an attrac
tive field to many due to its goal of
improving the state of the world.
Even the most power-hungry politi
cians must, in the midst of a cam
paign, believe (or have convinced
themselves) that they are the right
person for the job.
But if a sense of duty is inherent in a
candidate's motivations, exactly
which duty is implied? To one's
country? One's party? One's prin
ciples? Unfortunately, the three are
at times mutually exclusive. The
dilemma is that the best candidate
does not always the best president
make. In other words, the most quali
fied are often not those with the best
chances for election.
Assuming that politicians are

motivated a least partly by their de
sire for the common good, the re
sponsibilites of a candidate making a
bid for party nomination are to a
large extent unclear. If one enters a
race due to a perceived lack of viable
choices, this implies the responsi
bility to recognize a superior can
didate if one declares him or herself.
But though early in every primary
there are candidates who later
withdraw in favor of another, this is
determined by their relative levels of

Realistically, the motivation to run for
president probably derives foremost from a
personal desire for the job. Vef especially in
times of hardship when the government is
plagued by an array of problems, the necessity
of curing the nation's ills can create a
contagious sense of crusade.

support, not by a qualitative
assessment of their presidential
potential. Furthermore, in a system
like ours with weak party discipline,
such early acquiesence is not always
the case.
At the 1980 Democratic Conven
tion, for example, Senator Ted Ken
nedy of Massachusets was criticized
by some for putting personal ambi
tion ahead of the good of the Demo
cratic Party and thus weakening its
position in the November general
election. Though with hindsight Rea
gan's landslide was probably in
evitable, the disorganization of the
Democrats undoubtedly added to
their debacle. Once it became prob
able that former President jimmy
Carter would get the nomination (a
point of course never conceded by
Kennedy) was it Kennedy's responsi
bility as a good Democrat to step
back and unify the party instead of

fighting to the bitter end?
On the other hand, does a can
didate have the duty to remain true
to his or her convictions, even when
doing so may pave the way for the
victory of the opposing party? How is
it possible for anyone of integrity to
vocally oppose a rival contender, and
then suddenly to acquiesce and pro
fess total support? Modern politics
demand that candidates distinguish
themselves from rivals, emphasizing
differences even where these may be

slight. But where a person is truly
convinced of the merits of his or her
program or the dangers of that of the
opposition, he or she may feel moral
ly compelled to continue the cam
paign, even when it may to others ap
pear futile.

for president probably derives fore
most from a personal desire for the
job. Yet especially in times of hard
ship when the government is

crusade.
I'm too humble ever to run for
president. My ambition is not that
great, and I could never convince
myself that I was superhuman.

When Senator Alan Cranston (D-
Calif.) announced Thursday the for
mation of a committee to explore the
possibility of his running for presi
dent in 1984, he cited as reasons for
his decision both his horror at Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's performance
to date and his lack of "awe" regard
ing other possible Democratic con
tenders. Hisclaim that his "abilities to
do the job at least match theirs" is
surprisingly modest, but for the most
part this is a standard explanation giv
en in declaring candidacy for the of
fice.
Why, in fact, does a person make
the decision to run for president?
Leaving aside those who do so simply
to build name recognition for the
future, is it truly the professed sense
of duty which gives the incentive to
launch a political campaign, as op
posed to personal ambition, or is it
some combination of the two?
Certainly it is possible to be
motivated by duty absent of ambi
tion. The latter is necessary to suc
cess, and of course no one would
take on the onerous job of the presi
dency unless they truly wished to do
so. Perhaps less obviously, neither is
personal ambition likely to be unac
companied by some sense of an
altruistic mission. Politics is an attrac
tive field to many due to its goal of
improving the state of the world.
Even the most power-hungry politi
cians must, in the midst of a cam
paign, believe (or have convinced
themselves) that they are the right
person for the job.
But if a sense of duty is inherent in a
candidate's motivations, exactly
which duty is implied? To one's
country? One's party? One's prin
ciples? Unfortunately, the three are
at times mutually exclusive. The
dilemma is that the best candidate
does not always the best president
make. In other words, the most quali
fied are often not those with the best
chances for election.
Assuming that politicians are

motivated a least partly by their de
sire for the common good, the re
sponsibilites of a candidate making a
bid for party nomination are to a
large extent unclear. If one enters a
race due to a perceived lack of viable
choices, this implies the responsi
bility to recognize a superior can
didate if one declares him or herself.
But though early in every primary

support, not by a qualitative
assessment of their presidential
potential. Furthermore, in a system
like ours with weak party discipline,
such early acquiesence is not always
the case.
At the 1980 Democratic Conven

nedy of Massachusets was criticized
by some for putting personal ambi
tion ahead of the good of the Demo
cratic Party and thus weakening its
position in the November general
election. Though with hindsight Rea
gan's landslide was probably in
evitable, the disorganization of the
Democrats undoubtedly added to
their debacle. Once it became prob
able that former President jimmy
Carter would get the nomination (a
point of course never conceded by
Kennedy) was it Kennedy's responsi
