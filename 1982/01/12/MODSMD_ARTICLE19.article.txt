## Castro celebrates movie musicals 
### 
Musicals may be the most
fatuous of all movie genres,
and yet they provide more
kinds of pleasure than any oth
er kind of film. Whenever
someone tells me he doesn't
care for musicals, I suspect he's
really referring to maudlin,
self-conscious blockbusters
like West Side Story and The
Sound of Music and Oklaho
ma! — the ones we're always
told are the highest achieve
ments of the musical comedy
form but really give musicals a
bad name. You can consider
yourself irretrievably beyond
the lure of musicals only if you
don't enjoy watching Fred
Astaire dance, or if you can't
succumb to The Wizard of Oz

and Singin' in the Rain and
Cabaret.
The Castro Theatre in San
Francisco (at the corner of
Castro and Market) is in the
fifth week of a two-month fes
tival of movie musicals. Their
program is impressively ex
tensive, including not only all
of the most famous musicals
but several unusual choices
that one doesn't have much
opportunity to see in the Bay
like the 1929 Sunny Side
Up (Jan. 19) with Janet Gaynor
dnd Charles Farrell, and Gene
Kelly's ill-fated Invitation to the
Dance (Jan. 31 and Feb. 1). I
couldn't find many con
spicuous omissions, though
they might have included a few
I've always wanted to see —
"Fanny Brice in Be Yourself, Par
amount on Parade, This Is the
Army, the 1947 Good News —
and perhaps some little-known
pictures that I've enjoyed —
Where's Charleyf with Ray
Bolger, Bing Crosby and W. C.
Fields in Mississippi, and The
Big Broadcast of 1938, which, as
a child, I watched whenever it
showed up on a local television
station. But the Castro sched
ule should provide a source of
much delight for musical buffs.
Because of the pastiche
structure of musical comedies,
it's possible to sit through a
very bad movie and find some
thing worthwhile in it — one
memorable song or one inven
tively staged number. Not ev
ery film being screened at the
Castro is admirable, but the
vast majority offer at least a few

minutes of joy. There are the
pas de deux Astaire dances
with Audrey Hepburn to
Gershwin's "He Loves and She
Loves" in Funny Face (tonight),
and the Gene Kelly-Judy Gar
land duets in For Me and My
Gal (Feb. 6); the "Be a Clown"
number in The Pirate (Feb.
7-8); Frank Sinatra's renditions
of the Rodgers and Hart tunes
in Pal Joey (Feb. 10) and the lyr
ical, evanescent Guenevere of
Vanessa Redgrave in Camelot
(Feb. 3); the DeSylva, Brown,
and Henderson songs in Sunny
Side Up and the Jerome Kern-
Johnny Mercer score for You
Were Never Lovelier (Feb. 13).
The following is a personal
selection of 25 musicals being

shown in the next few weeks:
Whoopee (1930; Jan. 19): Ed
die Cantor gave Ziegfeld one
of his biggest stage hits in 1927;
in the early days of the talkies,
when studios were churning
out enough lavish musicals to
suffocate audiences, Ziegfeld
arranged for Whoopee to be
preserved on film. It is the only
movie he ever supervised. (He
died not long after.) This is an
authentic time piece; if you
ever wanted to know what the
musical theater of the '20s was
like, this film will tell you. Your
reaction to it will depend on
how much you warm up to
Cantor's rather heavy charm,
but the score is pleasant
("Makin' Whoopee," "My
Baby Just Cares for Me," etc.).
Busby Berkeley staged the
dance numbers.
Flying Down to Rio (1933;
Feb. 18): The nominal leads are
Dolores del Rio, Gene Ray
mond, and Raul Roulien, but
this is the movie in which Fred
first danced with Ginger, and
their teamwork even in this
early phase eclipses everything
else in the picture. In the title
number, chorus girls dance on
the wings of planes. (This ec
centric concept inspired the
movie director Peter O'Toole
played in The Stunt Man.)
42nd Street (1933; Feb.
14-15): This most celebrated of
backstage musicals, based in
part on the 1929 On with the
Show, is a lot more fun in the
original than it is in the fairly
unimaginative Broadway re
vival — and it won't cost you

$35 to get in. Warner Baxter
plays the harried director who
barrels his show ahead against
all odds, and his cast and crew
include many of the Warner
Brothers stock company —
Ruby Keeler, Una Merkel,
George Brent, Dick Powell,
Ned Sparks, George E. Stone,
Allen Jenkins — as well as Bebe
Daniels as the bitch star and
Ginger Rogers as Anytime An
nie. The songs are by Al Dubin
and Harry Warren, and Busby
Berkeley choreographed the
showstoppers — "Young and
Healthy," "Shuffle Off to Buf
falo," and the title number.
Gold Diggers of 7933 (1933;
Feb. 14-15): The great Depres
sion musical. Ginger Rogers
sings "We're in the Money"
while chorines dance behind
huge coins — this is the faous
number excerpted in Bonnie
and Clyde and alluded to in the
first dance number in Pennies
from Heaven. The finale, "Re
member My Forgotten Man,"
sung by Joan Blondell and Etta
Motten, is the most unusual
evocation of the political and
social milieu in any musical of
this period, and it may be
Busby Berkeley's finest hour.
Footlight Parade (1933; Jan.
21-22): The feeling of
backstage excitement in this
Busby Berkeley musical is very
touching, and the numbers are
very good. Dick Powell
serenades Ruby Keeler with
"By a Waterfall," and in
"Shanghai Lil," set — strangely
enough — in a Chinese bar that
seems to be a combination
whorehouse and opium den,
we get to watch Jimmy Cagney
dance.
Dames (1934; Feb. 14-15):
Not as good as the three
Berkeley films of the previous
year, but endearingly silly.
Dubin and Warren were start
ing to repeat themselves —
"Dames" sounds a lot like
"Young and Healthy" — but
it's worth the price of ad
mission to watch an army of
chorus dancers turn into a
giant jigsaw puzzle photo
graph of that ingenuous in
competent Ruby Keeler in "I
Only Have Eyes for You."
The Merry Widow (1934;
Feb. 9): Lorenz Hart had a hand
in the touching upof the libret
to of the grand old Lehar
operetta, and Ernst Lubitsch
directed; it's easily the best of
the Maurice Chevalier-
Jeanette Mac Donald series.
Her foggy soprano isn't as pain
ful as usual in the exquisitely
shot "Vilia" number.
Roberta (1935; tonight): The
plot is some impossible clap
trap about Randolph Scott tak
ing over his aunt's Paris dress
shop and falling in love with
Irene Dunne, but Astaire and
Rogers dance divinely to the
graceful Jerome Kern songs.
This picture has never been
shown on television, so it's well
worth a trip.
Top Hat (1935; Jan. 16): Su
perlative. Irving Berlin wrote
the songs, and there are four
unforgettable numbers — "No
Strings," which Astaire reprises
as a "sandman" dance to lull
Rogers to sleep; "Isn't It a Love
ly Day," performed in a gazebo
in the rain; "Cheek to Cheek";
and "Top Hat, White Tie and

Tails," which ends with Astaire,
his cane transformed into a
shotgun, mowing down the
gentlemen of the chorus.
Swing Time (1936; Jan. 16):
Possibly the best of the Astaire-
Rogers films. Fred dances an
amazing tribute to Bill "Bo
jangles" Robinson and
serenades Ginger with the Os
car-winning "The Way You
Look Tonight" while she
washes her hair in the adjacent
room. The climactic "Never
Gonna Dance" is the most
startling pas de deux they ever
did. Songs by Jerome Kern and
Dorothy Fields.
Show Boat (1936; Feb. 16):
The most satisfying film version
(there have been three) of the
Kern-Hammerstein musical.
Helen Morgan and Paul Rob
eson make up for the soap op
eratics and the dim per
formances of the romantic
leads, Irene Dunne and Allan
Jones.

Movie Musicals

The Wizard of Oz (1939; Feb.
7-8): Judy Garland and those
great vaudevillians Ray Bolger
and Bert Lahr in the most
beloved of all musicals.
Babes in Arms (1939; Feb. 2):
M-G-M was unwise to retain so
few of the songs from the
Rodgers and Hart stage show,
but the movie has its own pe
culiarly cornball appeal. By
1939 the elaborate backstage
concoctions of Busby Berkeley
had given way to the Mickey
Rooney-Judy Garland shows,
which were less sophisticated
and less inventive. This is the
most famous one.
Yankee Doodle Dandy
(1942; Jan. 21-22): Michael
Curtiz directed this polished,
tasteful display of wartime pa
triotism. As George M. Cohan,
James Cagney gives one of the
four or five greatest musical
comedy performances in mov
ies.
Girl Crazy (1943; Feb. 2): The
best of the Garland-Rooney
pictures. The Gershwin score
helps a great deal; it includes
"Embraceable You," "I Got
Rhythm," "Bidin' My Time,"
"Could You Use Me?," and
"But Not for Me," which Gar
land delivers almost entirely in
close-up.
Cover Girl (1944; Feb. 13):
The wartime musicals had a
characteristic speed and tacki
ness and economy; this is one
of the few that audiences can
watch today without cringing,
though there's a Gay Nineties
flashback sequence that may
drive you into the lobby for a
smoke. Jerome Kern and Ira
Gershwin penned the songs,
the best of which is "Long Ago
and Far Away," and the most
unusual dance is Gene Kelly's
"Alter Ego" number. With Rita
Hayworth and Phil Silvers.
The Harvey Girls (1946; Jan.
14-15): A very strange musical
comedy, in which the forces of
good — the virginal waitresses
known as the Harvey Girls —
and the forces of evil — the
saloon show girls — battle for
the soul of a western town. The

top-notch cast includes Judy
Garland, Angela Lansbury, Ray
Bolger, Virginia O'Brien, and
Marjorie Main, and the under
rated songs are by Harry
Warren and Johnny Mercer.
The "Atchison, Topeka and the
Santa Fe" number goes on for

nearly 10 glorious minutes.
Easter Parade (1948; jan. 30):
Not first-rate, really — the Irv
ing Berlin songs are a mixed
batch, and the cast includes
tirelessly tapping Ann Miller
and dreary Peter Lawford —
but some of the numbers are

wonderful. The best are Fred
Astaire's "Steppin' Out with
My Baby" and his duet with
Judy Garland, "A Couple of
Swells."
Summer Stock (1950; Feb. 6):
Judy Garland and Gene Kelly

Brothers; bottom: Topol in fiddler on the Roof.

work marvelously together in
this slight, enjoyable musical.
Harry Warren and Mack
Gordon wrote most of the
songs, which are extremely
pleasant, but the most famous,
"Get Happy," is a Harold Arlen
tune resurrected from the Cot
ton Club revues of the '30s.
The Band Wagon (1953; Feb.
4-5): Indispensable satire of
Broadway types by Betty Com
den and Adolph Green — per
haps half a notch below Singin'
in the Rain on the Richter scale
of musical comedies. Fred
Astaire and Jack Buchanan do a
fine top hat and cane duet;
Astaire parodies mickey Spill
ane; he and Cyd Charisse
dance in Central Park; and he
dazzles 42nd Street. Vincente
Minnelli directed (and you can

tell), and the songs are the best
of Arthur Schwartz and How
ard Dietz.
A Star Is Born (1954; Jan.
24-25): Judy Garland's intense
comeback performance is
often terrible but always com
pelling, and so is the movie.
Garland's naked intensity
draws most people to the film,
but there's actually a better
reason to see it: James Mason's
portrait of an alcoholic has
been. His suicide scene is
hauntingly directed (by
George Cukor) and has in
spired filmmakers as disparate
as Robert Altman and Woody
Allen.
Seven Brides for Seven
Brothers (1954; Jan. 14-15): If
you ignore Jane Powell's
whipped-cream coloratura,
you'll have a great time at this

Stanley Donen musical
western, based on a story by (of
all people) Steven Vincent
Benet. Howard Keel's baritone
has never been warmer, and
the dancing of his six brothers
represents the apex of the full
blooded M-G-M choreo
graphic style of the period.
Michael Kidd staged the num
bers, the most extraordinary of
which are the barn raising and
the"Lonesome Polecat" pas de
six in the snow.
It's Always Fair Weather
(1955; Jan. 28-29): An almost
forgotten gem. Gene Kelly,
Dan Dailey, and Michael Kidd
play army buddies who dis
cover at their 10th-year re
union that they can't stand
each other. This must be the
first cynical musical ever to
come out of Hollywood, and

it's certainly one of the best.
Comden and Green wrote the
script and Kelly directed with
Stanley Donen.
Funny Girl (1968; Feb. 17):
Barbara Streisand is magnif
icent as Fanny Brice in William
Wyler's film of the Broadway
hit. It's a vastly entertaining
movie, though the second half
is heavily weighted on the
show biz heartbreak side, and
Omar Sharif is a pathetic ro
mantic hero.
Fiddler on the Roof (1971;
Jan. 27): Topol gives a huge,
generous performance in Nor
man Jewison's wonderful film
of the Bock and Harnick stage
show. This triumphant musical
was cruelly truncated in its re
release a few years ago; I hope
the Castro shows the uncut
version.
