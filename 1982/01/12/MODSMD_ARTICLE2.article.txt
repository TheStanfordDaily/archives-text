# Udall: Begin Soviet arms talks, stop madness
## 
### Bill Ainsworth Kathy Olmsted 
The United States should begin arms limitations talks
with the Soviet Union as soon as possible, Rep. Morris
Udall (D-Arizona) told more than 750 people in Memori
al Auditorium last night.
"It is madness to keep piling weapons on weapons the
way we've been doing," said Udall.
Earlier in the day Udall expressed his opposition to a
variety of President Ronald Reagan's policies in front of a
small crowd at an informal reception held in the Branner
Hall lounge.
"-I'm-fte fanofWenry Krs9inger or Richard Nixon/but at
least they were talking to the Soviets," said Udall. "(Sec
retary of State Alexander) Haig and some others in the
present administration seem to have the attitude that
we'll talk to the Soviets later and maybe something will
happen between now and then."
'Limited war' policy questioned
Udall criticized the Reagan administration's talk of a
limited nuclear war. "Once you've been vaporized,
there's no place to hide," he said.
Speaking from notes jotted "on the back of a little old
envelope," Udall commented on what he called the
"Mickey Mouse economics" of the Reagan adminis
tration. "We're talking about a president of the party of
Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover racking up larger
federal deficits than all the budget deficits under Wash
ington to Nixon combined," he said.
"Clearly this thing (Reaganomics) was a disaster," said
Udall. "The president has to face it."
Reaganomics 'a disaster'
The large Kemp-Roth tax cuts passed last summer, ac
cording to Udall, represent "the most outrageous eco
nomic policy of the last half-century."
The noted House environmentalist and former presi
dential candidate also told his Branner audience that the
failures of Reagan's economic policies should help the
Democrats gain seats in Congress in this year's midterm
elections.
Reagan's economic policies, according to Udall, are
causing the misplacement of capital. To remedy this situ
ation Udall proposed that tax deductions for interest on

capital used for corporate takeovers, and other un
productive economic activity, be eliminated.
Udall cited a successful lawyer friend of his who an
nually goes to Europe to buy paintings for his office and
deducts the entire trip as a business expense as an exam
ple of a tax deduction which should be eliminated.
Watt criticized
Appointing James Watt as secretary of the interior is a
strategy that Reagan is using to undermine the work of
that department, said Udall.
Instead of seeking legislation that would repeal or
change laws protecting the environment, Watt is skirting
that process by misapplying existing laws or finding
loopholes which nullify them, said Udall.
"Watt is not coming up with a lot of legislation. He's
appointing people to head agencies who don't believe
in the work the agency does," according to Udall.
Watt will receive such strong opposition to his efforts
to open the California coast for offshore drilling that he
probably won't be succesful, according to Udall.
Because only 2 percent of the nation's land is pro
tected as wilderness, Watt's attempts at opening the wil
derness to oil and gas exploration affects only a tiny per
centage of the potential sources of energy.
"His logic is that any dumb secretary can get approval
for looking through sagebrush for energy, so we ought
to spend our time looking through the wilderness," he
said.
The petitions circulated by the Sierra Club last year
that called for the removal of Watt from office and
gained over a million signatures had a positive effect, ac
cording to Udall.
Human rights
Udall said he opposes the Reagan administration's pol
icies in Latin America, especially his human rights policy.
"Whatever his other problems in office were, Jimmy
Carter was damn good on human rights," Udall said.
Instead of supporting governments that violate human
rights such as El Salvador and Argentina, Udall said the
United Statese ought to "practice what it preaches."
