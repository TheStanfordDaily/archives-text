U.S. nixes Taiwan plane sale
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, in a
move clearly aimed at bolstering his sagging re
lationship with mainland China, has rejected a
longstanding request from Taiwan for ad
vanced U.S. fighter planes.
Instead, the State Department said yesterday,
the president believes that the island nation's
defense needs can be met by replacing its aging
jet fighters with new versions of the same
models.
Taiwan had sought, at the least, to replace its
fleet of F-5E fighters with the more advanced
F5-G Tigershark, a version with more speed,
agility and range. The Peking government
vehemently opposed the sale, viewing the issue
as a litmus test of its fledgling ties with the Unit
ed States.
Thus, Reagan's decision was taken as a signal
that despite his pro-Taiwanese rhetoric of the
1980 presidential campaign, he now views the
link with the communist mainland of equal or
more importance to the United States.
China yesterday called the decision to con
tinue sales of the F-sEfighterplanetoTaiwanan
"obstinate stand" as Assistant Secretary of State
John Holdridge opened talks with Chinese of
ficials and signs of a China-U.S. showdown over
the issue increased.
China, in increasingly strident tones, has
threatened to downgrade its relations with the
United States if the Reagan administration sells
sophisticated weapons to Taiwan, which broke
away from the mainland after the Communist
victory in 1949.
Diplomatic analysts here believe that China
has recently mortgaged too much of its
credibility and national pride to back down
from its public warnings unless Washington
agrees at least in principle to stop arms sales to
Taiwan and sets a cutoff date.
Deputy State Department spokesman Alan
Romberg told reporters that a lengthy adminis
tration study had concluded that "no sale of ad
vanced fighter aircraft to Taiwan is required be
cause no military need for such aircraft exists.
"Taiwan's defense needs can be met as they
arise, and for the foreseeable future, by replac
ing aging aircraft now in the Taiwan inventory
with comparable aircraft," he said.
Last summer, the Reagan administration
agreed for the first time to sell military equip
ment to mainland China. But Beijing has re
fused to conclude any sales agreement, prefer
ring to await a final decision on the Taiwanese
request.
Taiwan's supporters here have maintained
that the Chinese should not have veto power
over U.S. defense relations with Taiwan. They
have argued that the Chinese will accept vir
tually any type of U.S. military relationship with
Taiwan because of Peking's hostility toward the
Soviet Union.
The American Council for Free Asia, a pro-
Taiwan lobby, called Reagan's decision a
"pusillanimous actanda major leap backward."
NATO pressures Poland
Brussels — The United States and Western Eu
rope tightened their economic pressure on the
Polish military government and set the stage for
possible future sanctions against both Warsaw
and Moscow.
These actions were spelled out in a toughly
worded communique issued by the foreign
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion following a special meeting here called at
the urging of the United States.

After condemning "the massive violation of
human rights" in Poland, the communique
called on the Polish military government of
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski "to live up to its de
clared intention to re-establsh civil liberties and
the process of reform." It also pointed an accus
ing finger directly at the Soviet Union and said
Moscow should "respect Poland's fundamental
right to solve its own problems free from for
eign interference."
As one spur to forcing moderation in Poland,
the allies agreed to strike at the economically
hard-pressed government there by putting in
abeyance future commercial credits for goods
other than food and suspending a decision on
negotiations to reschedule Poland's 1982
payments on its debts to NATO governments.
In addition, after warning that "economic re
lations with Poland and the Soviet Union are
bound to be affected" if the crisis continues,
the NATO partners agreed to study possible
long-term sanctions involving energy, agricul
tural commodities and other goods including
high-technology exports.
This threat of economic retaliation, which has
been a sticking point between the United States
and those West European countries that have
substantial trade with the Soviet Bloc, was stated
in terms allowing each ally to act "in ac
cordance with its own situation and legisla
tion."
That left unanswered the question of how ex
tensive and uniform any economic measures
taken by NATO are likely to be. But the United
States is known to regard yesterday's com
munique as laying the groundwork for sanc
tions if the repression in Poland continues.
Sinai evacuation conflict
Jerusalem — Prospects for a peaceful evac
uation of Israeli settlers from the northern Sinai
Peninsula appeared to have dimmed yesterday
with the dissolution of the negotiating commit
tees of the government and settlers after they
failed to reach agreement on property com
pensation to be paid when Israel completes its
scheduled withdrawal on April 25.
Militant leaders of the Mediterranean resort
town of Yamit, announcing the breakup of their
negotiating committee, predicted a "national
catastrophe" if the government attempts to re
move them by force.
Yosi Sela, chairman of the Yamit Action Com
mittee, warned in a news conference that "we
will use all our force and not only with our
hands. We will stay until April 26 and then there
will be a tragedy." He did not elaborate on what
kind of force the settlers might use but some
Yamit residents have talked about an armed
confrontation with the army.
While the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty froze
the population of Yamit at about 500 families,
about 300 ultranationalist squatters have moved
into the town to oppose its evacuation.
The government said its offer of $270 million
compensation — ranging from $132,000 to
$437,500 per family — was final and that no
further negotiations will be held.
Reagan begins budget talks
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
began talks yesterday with congressional allies
on his 1983 budget, and says he has not yet en
dorsed proposed increases in a variety of con
sumer taxes.
House Republican Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois said after conferring with the president
he was "not altogether sure" the president was

convinced about the need to raise government
revenue.
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.) predicted that de
spite the advice the president is getting from
top assistants to opt for some form of tax in
crease, "he will come down on the side of no
tax increase."
GM,Ford, to talk with UAW
Detroit — Bargainers for Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors opened emergency talks with
the United Auto Workers yesterday by demand
ing immediate contract concessions to help
them compete with foreign automakers.
The union said it will have some demands of
its own.
The extraordinary talks, which come six
months before traditional mid-summerauto in
dustry negotiations, are taking place amid the
worst industry slump in half a century.
Bargainers from both sides hope to have in less
than two weeks an agreement that would re
place portions of the current contracts, which
don't expire until Sept. 14.
"To fail to do anything is to write the death
knell for a good part of this industry," said Peter
Pestillo, Ford Motor Co.'s vice president for la
bor relations
UAW President Douglas Fraser said the union
would seek gains during the talks, especially
protection of members' jobs. The union also
will try to win a seat on Ford and GM's boards of
directors, will seek a greater voice in the com
pany's decision-making process and will seek
some kind of profit-sharing program, said
Fraser and Don Ephlin, UAW vice president and
head of the union's Ford Department.
VA chief favors medical cuts
Washington — The chief of the Veterans Ad
ministration says the government has no re
alistic choice but to stop automatically offering
unlimited free medical care to any veteran over
65 who asks for it.
Under existing law, all veterans become
eligible at 65 — even those who can afford to
pay for treatment, served in uniform only brief
ly or have ailments unconnected totheirtime in
service.
The problem, says VA Administrator Robert
Nimmo, is that the 12 million World War II vet
erans who will reach age 65 in the next 15 years
threaten to overwhelm the VA's hospital system
— and the VA budget — if all remain eligible for
free care.
Stock market down
New York — The stock market trembled yes
terday under heightened investor concern
about higher interest rates, with the stock in
dexes falling to their lowest points since last fall.
Even brisk trading in AT&T and IBM stock was
unable to stimulate the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials. The Dow tumbled 16.07 points to
850.46, its lowest level since Nov. 19 when it fin
ished at 844.75.
Among the most active issues on the NYSE,
AT&T gained 1 7 /e to 60V2, and IBM rose 1 /b to
56 7 /b. But the performances were below the ex
pectations of many analysts who had predicted
healthier advances.
Today's weather
Mostly fair except for a few clouds in the
north. Patchy night and morning valley fog.
Highs in the 50s to low 60s and lows in the 30s to
mid 40s at lower elevations.
