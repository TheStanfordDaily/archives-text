The man arrested Saturday night
near Stern Hall does not fit the de
scription of the campus rapist, Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
said yesterday.
Herrington said the man was "too
old" to fit the police description of
the person believed responsible for
three rapes here this year. But he
added that the police will check
things out with the victims to be sure.
The man was apprehended after a
foot chase by officers and was
stopped with the assistance of a Stan
ford student. The man was charged
with resisting an officer in the per
formance of his duty and released on
bail.
According to Herrington, the of
ficers were investigating a call that a
man fitting the description of the
campus rapist was seen "in and
around the dorms." Herrington said

the man was on parole and had run
from the officers because he had a
small amount of marijuana that he
threw away during the chase.
Herrington said the police had re
ceived "three or four" calls this
weekend reporting suspicious activi
ty by men fitting the rapist's descrip
tion. He said the police had followed
up on the calls but had not found
anyone that closely met the descrip
tion.
Herrington refused to comment
on the possibility that more than one
person had committed the rapes on
campus. "I don't know and I'm not
going to speculate," he said.
The assailant in all three rapes,
however, has been described in ex
tremely similar ways. He is described
as a black male in his 20s, about six
feet tall, 180 pounds, with a thin
mustache, short hair and a muscular
build.
