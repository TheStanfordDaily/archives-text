Fred Eyerly emerged as the new
mayor of Palo Alto last night after
three rounds of balloting by the City
Council.
Eyerly, a senior member of the
council with a conservative reputa
tion, won the five votes needed for
election from the nine-member
council when Emily Renzel provided
the swing vote, switching from Betsy
Bechtel to Eyerly.
Mayor Eyerly, reached by phone
late last night, said Renzel had lob
bied him to vote for Bechtel. Bechtel
was elected vice mayor on the fourth
ballot.
Bechtel told the Daily it was "hard
to say" why Eyerly beat Levy. How
ever, she said, Eyerly has been a
council member for nearly seven
years and "deserves his chance."
A former hardware store owner,
Eyerly, 59, succeeds Mayor Alan Hen
derson, who retired from the council
Dec. 31. First elected to the council in
1975, Eyerly was reelected to a four
year term in 1979.
Eyerly's victory was an upset over

Leland Levy, a centrist, who many
called the predicted favorite before
balloting.
Under Palo Alto's city manager
form of government, the position of
mayor is considered ceremonial by
some, as the job consists of appoint
ing council members to committees,
running meetings and planning
council agendas with City Manager
Bill Zaner.
However, Vice Mayor Bechtel con
siders the post much more signifi
cant: "How a person runs a meeting
is very important," she said. Eyerly
will be "actually setting policies," as
well as managing "intergovernmen
tal relations" between Palo Alto and
other cities, she added.
"The mayor represents the council
as far as bringing together its ideas
and policies," Eyerly said. "That
doesn't mean the mayor should use
the position for his own pet ideas. . .
You should be a facilitator for the
council and staff."
"Fred should do a good job," said
