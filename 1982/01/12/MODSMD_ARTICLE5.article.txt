# Storm victims seek federal assistance
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Some carried
snapshots of their crushed homes
and broken furniture. Others
brought nothing but a sad descrip
tion of how everything they owned
was destroyed in last week's devas
tating floods and mudslides.
Hours before the five federal dis
aster assistance centers set up around
the San Francisco Bay Area opened
yesterday afternoon, the victims
began to line up and wait for help.
The intensive storm Jan. 3 through
Jan. 5 dumped more than a foot of
rain on a 250-mile area north and
south of San Francisco and caused an
estimated $280 million in damage.
The death toll from the storm was
reduced from 29 to 28 Monday after a
Marin County coroner's ruling that
Charlotte Irwin, 88, of San Anselmo
died of causes unrelated to the
storm.
The wait continued at Ben Lomond
in Santa Cruz County, where rescue
workers were stalled in their search
for at least five more bodies believed
to be buried in the mud anddebrisof
eight fallen houses.
"The search has been suspended
and there's no telling when it might
resume," said Sgt. Bruce Simpson of
the county Sheriff's Department.
"We had to stop digging Saturday
night because the land is very un
stable. There was a danger to rescue
workers from falling trees and
rocks."

Digging was stopped when geolo
gists said the land around Love Creek
was still moving.
"We're recommending a halt to
the excavations for at least two or
three weeks and possibly until the
end of winter," said Tom Burns, chief
of the county environmental agency.
'We've already lost a lot of lives and
we don't need to lose 30 or 40 more."
Burns said geologists surveyed the
area with field and aerial photo
graphs and determined it was too
dangerous to continue the search for
victims.
"The rescuers were using a lot of
heavy equipment up there and that
could be asking for trouble," Burns
said. "The problem is we're now
moving into the heaviest part of the
rainfall season. There could be more
heavy storms between now and
March that could cause an accelera
tion of the movement of that land
mass."
Burns said he expected the sheriff's
department to follow the recom
mendations of the geologists.
"It's very hard to get 10 geologists
to agree on anything, but they're all
unanimous about this," Burns said.
Although 20,000 customers in San
ta Cruz were still without phones,
power was returned throughout
most of the county, schools were
open and roads were clear. Simpson
said looting was no longera problem.
Some 20 looting incidents were re
ported over the weekend.
With the initial shock of the dis
aster behind them, the victims began
to look for help from federal disaster
aid centers. Each of the five centers
had staffs of about 30 officials and
volunteers. Hotline phones were
busy from early in the morning. The
offices were open from 1 to 7 p.m.
but will be open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
the rest of the week.
"Some of the victims are bringing
in photos of their homes and dam
aged furnishings and that's the best
documentation they can have," said
Cammie Conlon, a spokesman at the
disaster coordinating center. "But
many don't know to bring anything.
They come in, some of them just
wiped out, and we'll try to help them

the best we can."
After introductory interviews, the
victims were routed to different
desks at the centers where they re
ceived advice about housing, health,
taxes, insurance, Red Cross as
sistance and legal problems.
President Ronald Reagan has de
clared Santa Cruz, Marin, San Mateo,
Sonoma, Solano and Contra Costa
counties eligible for emergency re
lief funds under the Federal Disaster
Relief Act. In addition to being
eligible for low interest loans, victims
can amend their 1981 taxes to deduct
the loss in 1981 rather than waiting
until filing their 1982 taxes. This can
give them immediate tax relief.
Gov. Jerry Brown has asked that
San Joaquin, Santa Clara and
Alameda counties be added to the
list for emergency relief.
