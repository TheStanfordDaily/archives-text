## French losing 'expense-account' lunch 
### Washington Post 
Paris — One of France's most glorious
traditions, the expense-account lunch in
fine restaurants, has suffered a fiscal blow
from the Socialist government, and the
princes of haute cuisine are groaning.
The cause of their stewing is a new, 30
percent tax on entertainment and other
business expenses that Budget Minister
Laurent Fabius says will bring almost a
billion dollars a year into the state treasury
to help pay for social welfare programs
enacted by President Francois Mitter
rand's Socialist cabinet.
Some of France's top chefs complain
that the measure also has led businessmen
to cut back drastically on the amount of
money their companies authorize for tak
ing clients to lunch. As a result, they say,
some of the classiest tables in a nation fa
mous for fine eating are sitting empty from
1 to 3 in the afternoon.
"It is catastrophic," said Gilbert Lejeune
of Le Doyen, one of Paris' best known res
taurants. "It is the economic ruin of the
country."
Besides its stiff rate, the tax has disturbed
Parisian restaurant owners because, in
their eyes, it seems directed at one of the
pillars of French renown — fine food.
"The very future of restaurants could be

made questionable by the tax on business
expenses," said Bernard Fournier, owner
of Le Petit Colombier, in a letter to mem
bers of the Parisian Syndicate of Pro
fessional Restauranteurs. "It is a direct at
tack on the hospitality and prestige of our
country's gastronomy," he added.
Another restaurant owner active in the
profession said the new tax hits the entire
range of services surrounding the care and
feeding of prospective clients visiting Paris
— from expensive restaurants to luxury
hotels to entertainment.
Estimates vary on how much business
the new tax actually is costing fancy restau
rants. Lejeune said his lunch business is off
by half at Le Doyen, down to about 140
servings a day, while evening service has
slumped only slightly. Francois reported a
similar drop. Fournier's group surveyed
100 top Paris restaurants and found busi
ness off by 12 percent overall, with the
noontime lunch business hardest hit by
far.
But Jean-Claude Vrinatof Taillevent, an
other of Paris' most prestigious restau
rants, said the new tax has changed noth
ing so far in his business. Without smiling,
he added:
"You know, I don't think great restau

rants or little cafes will be hit. But medium
restauraunts that set very high prices
without necessarily taking quality into ac
count — and they are numerous — will suf
fer the heaviest consequences. The
number of these restaurants is fright
ening."
In any case, it is fear of what will happen
during the new year that has the restau
ranteurs most worried. On coming to
power last June, the Socialist government
immediately imposed a special 10 percent
tax on business expenses, causing a first
chill.
Fournier said 60 restaurant owners in his
syndicate made an informal survey of their
business clients and found 90 percent
planned to trim expense accounts this year
by approximately as much as the 30 per
cent tax.
Government officials argue that the tax
is necessary not only for extra revenues,
but also because under previous legisla
tion French businesses could deduct ex
pense-account expenditures from their
tax bills. This meant, they contend, that the
government was subsidizing good lunches
for businessmen while facing budget defi
cits for health insurance and unemploy
ment benefits.

Another restaurant owner active in the
profession said the new tax hits the entire
range of services surrounding the care and
feeding of prospective clients visiting Paris
— from expensive restaurants to luxury
hotels to entertainment.
Estimates vary on how much business
the new tax actually is costing fancy restau
rants. Lejeune said his lunch business is off
by half at Le Doyen, down to about 140
servings a day, while evening service has
slumped only slightly. Francois reported a
similar drop. Fournier's group surveyed
100 top Paris restaurants and found busi
ness off by 12 percent overall, with the
noontime lunch business hardest hit by
far.
But Jean-Claude Vrinatof Taillevent, an
other of Paris' most prestigious restau
rants, said the new tax has changed noth
ing so far in his business. Without smiling,
he added:
"You know, I don't think great restau

rants or little cafes will be hit. But medium
restauraunts that set very high prices
without necessarily taking quality into ac
count — and they are numerous — will suf
fer the heaviest consequences. The
number of these restaurants is fright
ening."
In any case, it is fear of what will happen
during the new year that has the restau
ranteurs most worried. On coming to
power last June, the Socialist government
immediately imposed a special 10 percent
tax on business expenses, causing a first
chill.
Fournier said 60 restaurant owners in his
syndicate made an informal survey of their
business clients and found 90 percent
planned to trim expense accounts this year
by approximately as much as the 30 per
cent tax.
Government officials argue that the tax
is necessary not only for extra revenues,
but also because under previous legisla
tion French businesses could deduct ex
pense-account expenditures from their
tax bills. This meant, they contend, that the
government was subsidizing good lunches
for businessmen while facing budget defi
cits for health insurance and unemploy
ment benefits.

DECEMBER'S SNOWS CAUSE FLOODS — In a photo that only recently reached the
West, Polish citizens in a blizzard overturn a police car in a Dec. 16 martial law protest
near the Gdansk shipyards. A recent rise in the temperature has worsened conditions for
Polish citizens under martial law, as flooding from melted snow has exacerbated food
shortages and displaced many from their homes.
