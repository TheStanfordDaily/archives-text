Bonn, West Germany (AP) — East
Germany's Communist leaders, learn
ing a lesson from Poland, are purging
party members who drift away from of
ficial trade unions, Der Spiegel maga
zine reported Sunday.
In an article it said was written by an
unidentified member of East Germany's
Communist Party, the magazine said
there had been mass defections from
the ranks of the Communist trade

unions in several parts of the country.
The article said 500 railway workers in
the Polish border town of Frankfurt an
der Oder quit their trade union in a
group, and it said there were "similar
occurrences" within the Socialist Unity
Party, as East Germany's Communist
Party is officially known.
The party responded with a sweeping
purge of local officials, a move thought
likely to arouse public anger, the article

said.
The writer said East German leaders
knew in November that the military
would assume control in Poland, but
they were caught off guard when
martial law was declared earlier than
they had expected.
The article said information reaching
East Germany "indicates that resistance
in Poland, active and passive, is much
greater than one suspects in the West."
