# Poland hit by flooding
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland â€” Still reel
ing from the economic and po
litical crisis that led to a pro
clamation of martial law almost
one month ago, Poland was
confronted yesterday by the
spread of terrible flooding.
Thousands have been evac
uated and scores injured in the
floods, centered near Plock,
lessthan 100 miles west of War
sawon the banks of the swollen
Vistula River. Radio Warsaw
said yesterday that flood waters
were threatening a key
pipeline that supplies Poland
and East Germany with oil from
the Soviet Union.
It also reported flood alerts
near Szczecin on the Baltic
coast near the East German
border, at Konin west of War
saw, around Sulejow,
southwest of the capital, and at
Koszalin, also on the Baltic
coast.
The Vistula overflowed
when a sudden thaw several
days ago melted a deep snow
cover left by the same mid-De
cember storm that has been
credited with aiding martial
lawauthorities in quickly estab
lishing control over the coun
try. That storm was followed by
another cold snap, forming ice
packs that are blocking the
normal flow of the river and
flooding low-lying villages and
fields in central Poland.
Still rising
The level of the Vistula was

reported nearly 10 feet above
the alert level and rising by one
centimeter per hour. About
6000 Poles have already been
evacuated from their homes in
the Plock area, and 4000 more
were being evacuated yester
day. At noon yesterday, War
saw Radio quoted the Plock
province governor as warning
that "within the next few
hours" many more villages
would be flooded. He advised
residents to evacuate "using
their own means of transporta
tion" rather than waiting for as
sistance from military and civil
ian disaster workers.
Martial law chief Gen. Wo
jciech Jaruzelski sent acting de
fense minister Gen. Florian
Siwicki to the Plock area Sun
day to take command of relief
operations. Siwicki is a mem
ber of the ruling Military
Council of National Salvation
and the man who directed the
imposition of martial law.
The official PAP news agency
said that 3000 soldiers and po
lice were participating in the
rescue effort, using am
phibious troop carriers and
helicopters to evacuate people
and livestock.
On Saturday, a train evac
uating people from the
flooded town of Radziwie was
derailed as it passed over an
embankment. No one was
killed, but hundreds were in
jured. Polish television showed
film of the derailed train in a

special flood report yesterday.
Road and rail links with many
towns in the region are cut, ac
cording to the official news
agency. Foreign correspon
dents were unable to visit the
area because they remain re
stricted to Warsaw under
martial-law regulations.
Food shortages
Warsaw Radio said yesterday
that flood damages are "im
possible as yet to assess," but
added that they would be
"enormous." The impact will
be even more severe given Po
land's already crippled econo
my. With no hard currency to
import food and grain from the
West and new Western credits
unlikely with the country's cur-_
rent heavy debt load and U.S.
economic sanctions, Poland al
ready faces serious food short
ages.
Polish farmers, meanwhile,
are reportedly withholding
food supplies from the martial
law regime. The authorities al
ready have cut meat rationsthis
month.
The floods threaten a bridge
that supports four oil pipelines
originating in the Soviet Union.
Two of the lines supply oil to
East Germany, and destruction
of the bridge would cost Berlin
50,000 tons of oil per day, ac
cording to a television report
here.
