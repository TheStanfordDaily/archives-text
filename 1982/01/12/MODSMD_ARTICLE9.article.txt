## Calypso music linked to freedom 
### Heather Millar 
The growing hardship in the West In
dies, caused by inflation and the many
problems inherent in any young country,
have inspired performers of calypso, a
Caribbean musical style characterized by
satirical ballads and syncopated rhythms,
to write an increasing number of reflective
calypso songs in the last 10 years, accord
ing to Gordon Rohlehr, University of the
West Indies professor.
Rohlehr, described by Stanford
Linguistics Prof. John Rickford as a "world
authority on calypso music" spoke yester
day on "The Language of Calypso" and will
lecture tonight in the Meyer Forum Room
on "Calypso and Caribbean Politics
1970-1980." Rohlehr has published several
articles about calypso music, and has had
three series of lectures broadcast over ra
dio stations in the Caribbean.
"Calypso is hardly ever sentimental,"
said Rohlehr. "It tends to be more cynical;
it deals with the hard facts of life."
Rohlehr said political comment is pre
dominant in the repertoire of current
calypso performers, or "calysonians." If
bribery is a problem in Trinidad, if there
are accusations of nepotism among the
elite, if there is concern over how govern
ment oil revenues are being spent — these
themes will filter into popular songs, he
said.
But the commentary is not always inde
pendent, according to Rohlehr. "Politi
cians use calypsonians in their cam
paigns," he said. "In the general elections

last year in Trinidad, calysonians portrayed
a certain party in a bad light and that party
lost the election. Of course, the losing par
ty also employed calysonians."
Rohlehr also portrayed calypso as a
guardian of free speech. "For the politi
cians, the problem is this: "Once you
censor a calypso song, it becomes popular
even if no one had paid any attention to it
before." However, if radio stations impose
censorship out of caution, Rohlehr has
noted that the singers will employ an im
age such as "devil" or "darkness" rather
than attack the politician or the problem
directly.
Rohlehr feels that calypso's traditional
concern with politics stems in part from its
roots in West Africa where the populace is
similiarly concerned with governance and
in part from its development during the
19th century and the emancipation of
black slaves.
Calypso, which developed primarily in
Trinidad, was originally a seasonal music
sung between Christmas and "Carnival," a
festival corresponding to Mardi Gras in
New Orleans. The white population cele
brated Carnival as a pre-Lenten holiday,
the black population as time when they
could be truly free, according to Rohlehr.
Behind a Carnival mask, a black man could
say what he wished with impunity. After
emancipation, Rohlehr feels this sense of
freedom was linked in the minds of the
people with Carnival, and Carnival music:
calypso.
"You grow up with calypso," said the

Guyana native. "It's a part of (the people)."
Calypsonians are, in turn, of the people.
Taxi-drivers, waiters, university graduates
— calypsonians have been drawn from all
these backgrounds. "The range of aware
ness and of education is very great," said
Rohlehr, who played in a steel band while
doing his graduate work at the University
of Birmingham.
Calysonians have a heightened aware
ness, Rohlehr said, and, according to their
diverse backgrounds, they reflect what
they know.
"They (calypsonians) set the vocabulary,
the catch-words of the day," said Rohlehr.
"You retain a sense of a language that is
alive. There is a delight in language, a de
light of which calypsonians are the expo
nents." Trinidad's changing of its official
language from French to English in the
1920s may have contributed to this joy in
language, the professor proposed.
Due to lack of time, Rohlehr said he has
not taught many calypso classes recently.
He is presently teaching a class on calypso
at Harvard University where he will be a
visiting scholar until the end of January.
"The topic became so immmense," said
Rohlehr. "I think it's a sufficiently interest
ing subject to justify a school of music."
Rohlehr expressed a desire to preserve
calypso, suggesting that archives be
created. "I'd like to see the government
take responsibility for calypso as a part of
our culture. When I try to imagine a
Trinidad without calypso, I see a tragedy."
