# Police records not completely private
## 
### Suzi Alexander 
As crime on the Stanford campus
increasingly requires news con
verage, the first source of informa
tion is inevitably the local police.
Though police logs of daily criminal
activity are not public records, local
departments will release daily bulle
tins and statistical analyses upon re
quest.
In the Bay Area, the Peninsula
Times Tribune and the San Jose
Mercury publish crime reports, in
cluding crimes that did not warrant
individual coverage. The Daily occa
sionally runs a police blotter, as well.
Newspapers are not the only
parties who seek crime reports. The
Stanford Police Department and the
Santa Clara County Sheriff make rec
ords available to specific individuals
involved in the case and in special sit
uations to other interested individ
uals.
At the Stanford Police Depart
ment, information is coordinated in
the form of a daily bulletin summariz
ing each day's cases. While individual
case reports may be several pages
long, the synopsis is usually a short
paragraph, since it excludes the spe
cific details of how the arrest was
made.
The bulletin is organized in three
parts: 1) a statement of the type of
case (e.g. burglary) and the case
number, 2) a summary of the case, in
cluding the date and time of the
crime, the date and time of the re
port, the suspect, and significant in
formation about the crime, (e.g. val
ue of goods stolen in a burglary), and
3) the reporting officer.
The names of juvenile victims and
assault victims are excluded from the
log as a courtesy, in addition to other
information which the victim might
prefer not to publicize, such as the

value of goods taken in a burglary.
In sum, Stanford Police Capt. John
Wullschleger said, "anything which
would hinder the prosecution proc
ess, we would want to avoid."
Asked why the department makes
its bulletins available on request to
any news organization, Wullschleger
said the department "likes to coop
erate with the media."
The bulletins are not, however,
available to anyone who wants them.
Wullschleger claimed this policy not
only saves time for the department,
but also protects the public. He ex
plained "it is hard to determine the
motive of the person asking for in
formation."
And Sargeant Philip Love added
that "it might be an individual who
had committed a crime and wanted
to see how much information we had
on him." Because the Stanford police
department is private property
(owned by Stanford University), it is
not required to give out any informa
tion, according to Wullschleger.
There are, however, many legit
imate requests for access to a particu
lar case file, Wullschleger said. The
department policy is always to give
reports to the victims of crime, at a
nominal fee of $1, since they may
need the report for insurance
purposes. Policy directs that the logs
not be given to arrestees; however,
they are advised to work through the
District Attorney or their attorney.
Wullschleger added that he reviews
individual situations on their own
merits.
Wullschleger said he does not be
lieve that a more public system
would deter crime, or would help
citizens to protect themselves better.
If there is a heavy concentration of a
particular crime in one area, the de-
