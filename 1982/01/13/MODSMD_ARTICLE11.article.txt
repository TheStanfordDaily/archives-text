Last August, a representative from the the
Kappa Sigma fraternity here did lobby in favor of
an amendment sponsored by the M.I.T. chapter
that would have abolished language in their
initiation ritual that the fraternity considered
offensive. However, the amendment was killed
in committee and the Stanford representative
was not permitted to cast a vote. A Daily
editorial reported yesterday that the local
chapter had declined tosupporttheM.l.T.
resolution.
The Daily regrets the error.
