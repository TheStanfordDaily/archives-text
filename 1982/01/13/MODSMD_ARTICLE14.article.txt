## Apartheid in South Africa must end—one way or another 
### 
it is a dry white season brother,
only the trees know the pain as they
still stand erect dry like steel, their
branches dry like wire, indeed, it is a
dry white season but seasons come to
pass. — Morgane Wally Serote
Racism in any form is abhorrent
but even more so when it enters the
realms of legislated action and gov
ernment policy as it has in South
Africa. The ruling National Party's of
ficial policy of apartheid (in effect
since 1948) relegates blacks to so
called "black townships" like
Soweto, limits their opportunities to
work and live as they choose, and de
nies them most political freedoms. In
a nation where blacks outnumber
whites four to one, this oppressive
policy is clearly insupportable.
Nevertheless, many of South
Africa's 4.6 million whites can and
will continue to support apartheid.
South Africa is not so fragile as the
news media have led us to believe.
The military and police forces are
powerful, well equipped and well in
formed. Still, there are other factors
which are often overlooked and may
be more important.
The simple truth is that the blacks,,
while not satisfied with the current
situation, are not entirely dissatisfied.

Of all the black African populations,
South African blacks have the highest
literacy rate (over 60 percent), the
most opportunities for higher educa
tion, the best health care and the
highest standard of living. A growing
black middle class has been estab
lished which has much at stake in
maintaining the status quo and which
would have little to gain from revolu
tion. The violence of the Soweto riots
in the 1970's came as a result of
mounting social pressures but it
wasn't necessarily indicative of the
imminent collapse of white rule.
Not only is the blacks' reluctance
to mount a full scale attack against
apartheid underestimated, so is the
resolve of the whites to maintain
their position. South African whites
point to a 300-year history of de
velopment and emphasize the fact
that many black tribes migrated to
the area long after the whites were
established. They are decided patri
ots and feel that they have just as
much right to be Africans as Ameri
cans have to be Americans. In short,
they love their country and, as they
have neither the desire nor the
means to resettle somewhere else,
they will fight to keep it.
While these three factors — estab

lished military power, black reluc
tance and white resolve — do in
dicate that whites will be able to hold
their position far longer than is now
believed, they do not indicate that
the status quo will be tenable for
much longer than 20 years. The day
will come when it will no longer be
possible to satisfy black expectations
(the black population, now 20 mil
lion, will double by the year 2025). If,
at that time, whites have not fully re
linquished their control and brought
real democracy to the country, revo
lution will be unavoidable.
The cost in human terms would be
staggering: a bloody holocaust for
the whites and economic disaster for
the country as a whole. Further com
plicating such a situation is the fact
that the South African military is
almost certainly in possession of nu
clear weapons which could be used
in a desperate final bid for control.
All is not lost, though. Other likely
scenarios do exist. The most favor
able of these would begin with the
dismantling of the apartheid system.
At the same time, educational op
portunities available to whites would
be opened to blacks and an end to
mandatory segregation would be

made. Then increased political free
dom could be phased in for both
whites and blacks with a one man,
one vote, Western style democracy
as the final goal. If all this sounds too
good to ever come true, it is perhaps
best to look to the political situation
as it exists and at the direction in
which it is headed.
The ruling National Party is sup
ported largely by Afrikaners, the ul
tra-conservative descendants of early
Dutch settlers, which make up 60
percent of the white population. It is
their language, Afrikans, which
spawned the word "apartheid" and
their way of thinking which gener
ated its policies.
On the other hand, the descen
dants of early English settlers (40 per
cent of the white population) hold
more liberal views. They are general
ly in favor of the removal of apartheid
laws and the eventual extension of
the voting franchise to blacks.
The realization that a large per
centage of South African whites are
progressive thinkers, and that their
numbers are increasing is important.
Led by such forward looking intellec
tuals as authors Alan Patton and An
dre Brink (significantly, an
Afrikaner), both segments of the

white population are moving slowly
from right to center. More and more
activists are turning up among white
college students and nearly everyone
agrees that "a change is coming.'
Whether the progress now being
made will come fast enough and be
significant enough depends largely
on the Western world's policy
toward South Africa. Better than cut
ting back on cultural and business
ties, more interchange should be en
couraged while diplomatic pressures
against apartheid are maintained. At
tempts to restrict foreign investment
and industrial development only
hurt the blacks. A prosperous econo
my creates an environment much
more conducive to liberalization and
progress. Already, an increased de
mand for skilled workers has been
met by blacks.
As for cultural exchange, it is clear
that the more South African blacks
and whites are exposed to Western
democracies, the more likely they

will be to understand the possibilities
which exist in their own country.
A Johannesburg banker recently
expressed his biggest concern for the
future to me: "Sure they'll get their
'one man, one vote' some day but it'll
be just like all these other 'liberated'
African states; one man, one vote,
once."
Still, one Soweto resident had an
even more compelling argument:
"All I want is to be treated like a hu
man being."
One way or another, South Africa's
"dry white season" will come to pass.
Whether the next season will bring
the death of winter or the renewed
life of spring will depend heavily
upon the amount of insight and un
derstanding with which South
African whites and the Western
world meet today's challenges.

Racism in any form is abhorrent
but even more so when it enters the
realms of legislated action and gov
ernment policy as it has in South
Africa. The ruling National Party's of
ficial policy of apartheid (in effect
since 1948) relegates blacks to so
called "black townships" like
Soweto, limits their opportunities to
work and live as they choose, and de
nies them most political freedoms. In
a nation where blacks outnumber
whites four to one, this oppressive
policy is clearly insupportable.
Nevertheless, many of South
Africa's 4.6 million whites can and
will continue to support apartheid.
South Africa is not so fragile as the
news media have led us to believe.
The military and police forces are
powerful, well equipped and well in
formed. Still, there are other factors
which are often overlooked and may
be more important.
The simple truth is that the blacks,,
while not satisfied with the current
situation, are not entirely dissatisfied.

Of all the black African populations,
South African blacks have the highest
literacy rate (over 60 percent), the
most opportunities for higher educa
tion, the best health care and the
highest standard of living. A growing
black middle class has been estab
lished which has much at stake in
maintaining the status quo and which
would have little to gain from revolu
tion. The violence of the Soweto riots
in the 1970's came as a result of
mounting social pressures but it
wasn't necessarily indicative of the
imminent collapse of white rule.
Not only is the blacks' reluctance
to mount a full scale attack against
apartheid underestimated, so is the
resolve of the whites to maintain
their position. South African whites
point to a 300-year history of de
velopment and emphasize the fact
that many black tribes migrated to
the area long after the whites were
established. They are decided patri
ots and feel that they have just as
much right to be Africans as Ameri
cans have to be Americans. In short,
they love their country and, as they
have neither the desire nor the
means to resettle somewhere else,
they will fight to keep it.
While these three factors — estab

lished military power, black reluc
tance and white resolve — do in
dicate that whites will be able to hold
their position far longer than is now
believed, they do not indicate that
the status quo will be tenable for
much longer than 20 years. The day
will come when it will no longer be
possible to satisfy black expectations
(the black population, now 20 mil
lion, will double by the year 2025). If,
at that time, whites have not fully re
linquished their control and brought
real democracy to the country, revo
lution will be unavoidable.
The cost in human terms would be
staggering: a bloody holocaust for
the whites and economic disaster for
the country as a whole. Further com
plicating such a situation is the fact
that the South African military is
almost certainly in possession of nu
clear weapons which could be used
in a desperate final bid for control.
All is not lost, though. Other likely
scenarios do exist. The most favor
able of these would begin with the
dismantling of the apartheid system.
At the same time, educational op
portunities available to whites would
be opened to blacks and an end to
mandatory segregation would be

made. Then increased political free
dom could be phased in for both
whites and blacks with a one man,
one vote, Western style democracy
as the final goal. If all this sounds too
good to ever come true, it is perhaps
best to look to the political situation
as it exists and at the direction in
which it is headed.
The ruling National Party is sup
ported largely by Afrikaners, the ul
tra-conservative descendants of early
Dutch settlers, which make up 60
percent of the white population. It is
their language, Afrikans, which
spawned the word "apartheid" and
their way of thinking which gener
ated its policies.
On the other hand, the descen
dants of early English settlers (40 per
cent of the white population) hold
more liberal views. They are general
ly in favor of the removal of apartheid
laws and the eventual extension of
the voting franchise to blacks.
The realization that a large per
centage of South African whites are
progressive thinkers, and that their
numbers are increasing is important.
Led by such forward looking intellec
tuals as authors Alan Patton and An
dre Brink (significantly, an
Afrikaner), both segments of the

white population are moving slowly
from right to center. More and more
activists are turning up among white
college students and nearly everyone
agrees that "a change is coming.'
Whether the progress now being
made will come fast enough and be
significant enough depends largely
on the Western world's policy
toward South Africa. Better than cut
ting back on cultural and business
ties, more interchange should be en
couraged while diplomatic pressures
against apartheid are maintained. At
tempts to restrict foreign investment
and industrial development only
hurt the blacks. A prosperous econo
my creates an environment much
more conducive to liberalization and
progress. Already, an increased de
mand for skilled workers has been
met by blacks.
As for cultural exchange, it is clear
that the more South African blacks
and whites are exposed to Western
democracies, the more likely they

will be to understand the possibilities
which exist in their own country.
A Johannesburg banker recently
expressed his biggest concern for the
future to me: "Sure they'll get their
'one man, one vote' some day but it'll
be just like all these other 'liberated'
African states; one man, one vote,
once."
Still, one Soweto resident had an
even more compelling argument:
