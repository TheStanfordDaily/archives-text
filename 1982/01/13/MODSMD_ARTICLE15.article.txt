## Reagan only keeps promises to rich 
### 
"Perhaps the most fundamental objection to
draft registration is moral. Only in the most se
vere national emergency does the government
have a claim to the mandatory service of its
young people. In any other time, a draft or draft
registration destroys the very values that our so
ciety is committed to defending."
— Ronald Reagan, 5/5/80.
"I have decided to continue our registration.
Make no mistake: The continuation of peace
time registration does not foreshadow a return to
the draft. I remain firm in my conviction, stated in
1980, that 'only in the most severe national emer
gency does the Government have a claim to the
mandatory service of its young people.' No such
emergency now exists..."
— Ronald Reagan, 1/7/82.
President Ronald Reagan keeps his campaign
promises — to the rich. But to the poor, the
middle class, the young, the powerless, and in
short, the bulk of the American populous, Year
One of the Reagan Era has just brought one bro
ken promise after another.
The most blatant example of this is indicated
above During the 1980 Presidential campaign,
Reagan ridiculed then-President Jimmy Carter's
resumption of draft registration as an empty re
sDonse to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Yet last Thursday, Reagan explicitly con
tradicted his campaign stand by continuing the
hated draft legislation. His advisors daimed at
suspending registration would send the wrong

signal to the Russians about Poland." What is in
fact the case is that the Reagan administration
used the Polish crisis as a pretext for reneging on
a campaign promise it hoped never to carry out.
To add insult to duplicity, Reagan selectively
quoted from his famous 1980 statement in revers
ing his stand last week. While noting that "only in
the most severe national emergency does the
government have a claim to the mandatory ser
vice of its young people/' he omits the very next
sentence that "draft registration destroys the
very values that our society is committed to de
fending."
Reagan's reversal came as little surprise to us in
the anti-draft movement. When asked about the
seeming contradiction between my stand against
Reagan in the 1980 election, and my vehement
opposition to the draft, I usually responded,
"Sure, Reagan's against a peacetime draft, but
he's in favor of war." Look out for both in 1983.
It must be emphasized that the draft is not the
only arena of broken promises. One only has to
look as far as the December unemployment fig
ure of 8.9 percent announced last week to find
another area in which millions of Americans
have been deceived. Reagan repeatedly prom
ised in his campaign to "get America moving
again," but the latest economic news would bet
ter indicate that America is stumbling and falling.
At the same time, Reagan pledged to Ameri
cans on fixed incomes to gain control of inflation
by balancing the budget Yet already, the admin

istration has renounced the goal of a balanced
budget, and record deficits are anticipated for
the foreseeable future. Another promise to
America gone by the wayside.
Nevertheless, Ronald Reagan has a con
siderably better track record in keeping his
promises to the very rich and to the largest cor
porations. The president promised massive tax
breaks to the rich and he has delivered: the gov
ernment has slashed the maximum tax rate on
unearned income from 70 percent to 50 percent.
(The tax cut to the podt was much less spec
tacular, and has been almost entirely offset by an
increase in social security taxes and by inflation
sponsored "bracket creep.")
And finally, Reagan promised the armaments
and aerospace industry a major shot-in-the-arm
through massive increases in government de
fense procurement. In this case, he delivered
even more than he pledged, by personally
pushing through the record AWACS sale to
Saudi Arabia in addition to boosting American
government arms purchases.
Alas, Year One of the Reagan era has brought
what we all expected: the rich keep getting
richer, the poor keep getting poorer, and the
young keep getting drafted. The only response
one can make is to organize an opposition to
these policies; and try to change them.

by balancing the budget Yet already, the admin

istration has renounced the goal of a balanced
budget, and record deficits are anticipated for
the foreseeable future. Another promise to
America gone by the wayside.
Nevertheless, Ronald Reagan has a con
siderably better track record in keeping his
promises to the very rich and to the largest cor
porations. The president promised massive tax
breaks to the rich and he has delivered: the gov
ernment has slashed the maximum tax rate on
unearned income from 70 percent to 50 percent.
(The tax cut to the podt was much less spec
tacular, and has been almost entirely offset by an
increase in social security taxes and by inflation
sponsored "bracket creep.")
And finally, Reagan promised the armaments
and aerospace industry a major shot-in-the-arm
through massive increases in government de
fense procurement. In this case, he delivered
even more than he pledged, by personally
pushing through the record AWACS sale to
Saudi Arabia in addition to boosting American
government arms purchases.
Alas, Year One of the Reagan era has brought
what we all expected: the rich keep getting
richer, the poor keep getting poorer, and the
young keep getting drafted. The only response
one can make is to organize an opposition to
these policies; and try to change them.

"Perhaps the most fundamental objection to
draft registration is moral. Only in the most se
vere national emergency does the government
have a claim to the mandatory service of its
young people. In any other time, a draft or draft
registration destroys the very values that our so
ciety is committed to defending."
— Ronald Reagan, 5/5/80.
"I have decided to continue our registration.
Make no mistake: The continuation of peace
time registration does not foreshadow a return to
the draft. I remain firm in my conviction, stated in
1980, that 'only in the most severe national emer
gency does the Government have a claim to the
mandatory service of its young people.' No such
emergency now exists..."
— Ronald Reagan, 1/7/82.
President Ronald Reagan keeps his campaign
promises — to the rich. But to the poor, the
middle class, the young, the powerless, and in
short, the bulk of the American populous, Year
One of the Reagan Era has just brought one bro
ken promise after another.
The most blatant example of this is indicated
above During the 1980 Presidential campaign,
Reagan ridiculed then-President Jimmy Carter's
resumption of draft registration as an empty re
sDonse to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Yet last Thursday, Reagan explicitly con
tradicted his campaign stand by continuing the
hated draft legislation. His advisors daimed at
suspending registration would send the wrong

signal to the Russians about Poland." What is in
fact the case is that the Reagan administration
used the Polish crisis as a pretext for reneging on
a campaign promise it hoped never to carry out.
To add insult to duplicity, Reagan selectively
quoted from his famous 1980 statement in revers
ing his stand last week. While noting that "only in
the most severe national emergency does the
government have a claim to the mandatory ser
vice of its young people/' he omits the very next
sentence that "draft registration destroys the
very values that our society is committed to de
fending."
Reagan's reversal came as little surprise to us in
the anti-draft movement. When asked about the
seeming contradiction between my stand against
Reagan in the 1980 election, and my vehement
opposition to the draft, I usually responded,
"Sure, Reagan's against a peacetime draft, but
he's in favor of war." Look out for both in 1983.
It must be emphasized that the draft is not the
only arena of broken promises. One only has to
look as far as the December unemployment fig
ure of 8.9 percent announced last week to find
another area in which millions of Americans
have been deceived. Reagan repeatedly prom
ised in his campaign to "get America moving
again," but the latest economic news would bet
ter indicate that America is stumbling and falling.
At the same time, Reagan pledged to Ameri
cans on fixed incomes to gain control of inflation
by balancing the budget Yet already, the admin

istration has renounced the goal of a balanced
budget, and record deficits are anticipated for
the foreseeable future. Another promise to
America gone by the wayside.
