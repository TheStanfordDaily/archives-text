# Storm victims seek aid after Bay Area deluge
## 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” Hundreds of
storm victims lined up for federal dis
aster aid yesterday in the San Francis
co Bay Area, while rescue teams
hunted for people still stranded a
week after a storm so intense that
new mudslides still threatened addi
tional homes.
More than 1000 people had ap
plied for aid at the five centers set up
in the 200-mile-long area of
Northern California stunned by the
fierce storm of Jan. 3-5 that claimed at
least 28 lives, with seven others pre
sumed dead.
"I would guess, just off-hand,
there would be in excess of 5000 ap
plicants" before the centers close
down, said Jim Kean, spokesman for
the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. Centers will remain open
until all have been helped.
The pounding winds and rain,
worst in a quarter century here, de
stroyed about 200 homes and dam
aged another 8000, displacing about
5457 people, said Anita Garcia,
spokeswoman for the state Office of
Emergency Services. The preliminary
property damage estimate of about
$280 million is expected to go higher
when more information is available,
officials say.
Seven Bay Area counties are
eligible for disaster relief. Kean said
that Humboldt County in far
northwest California was added to

the disaster list yesterday. That coun
ty, which suffered about $2.8 million
in damage from a December storm, is
eligible only for federal aid to local
government, Kean said.
Rescue teams tried to reach 37 re
mote areas in the Santa Cruz Moun
tains. Some of the areas have not
been heard from since they were
isolated by mudslides and flooding a
week ago, said Ben Angove, deputy
emergency services officer for Santa
Cruz County.
"There's no power; there's no
phone ... and they apparently
haven't gotten out," Angove said.
Six bodies are believed to remain
buried beneath a massive mudslide
that buried seven or eight houses in
the Love Creek area of Ben Lomond,
north of Santa Cruz.
But Angove said "It may not be un
til the weather dries out in the sum
mer" that they are recovered. Of
ficials called off the search, fearful
that excavation work could trigger a
new slide in the steep canyon, killing
the workers.
In other parts of the country, freez
ing rain and sleet spread along much
of the Gulf Coast yesterday and snow
spread from the Rockies through the
northern Mississippi Valley, but skies
were sunny through much of the rest
of the nation.
