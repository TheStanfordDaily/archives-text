# Cal Dean vetoes Fed censorship

### Los Angeles Times 
Berkeley, Calif.— A Univer
sity of California dean refused
to participate in a proposal by a
state agency to publish a style
manual telling reporters how
their stories can have
"positive" or "negative" ef
fects on community race rela
tions.
Dean Edwin Bayley of the
Graduate School of Journalism
at UC Berkeley denounced the
proposal as "outrageous,"
saying that it violates freedom
of the press and represents a
"step toward censorship."
"What is proposed here is
that a government agency tell
newspapers and the media
what words to use and what not
to use, to tell the media how to
report and what to report,"
Bayley said in a letter declining
to participate.
The dean noted that, in the

past, private organizations
have proposed voluntary re
strictions on the press. "This,
however, is a far more serious
matter," he said. "This is gov
ernment proposing such rules.
It is outrageous."
The proposal was made last
month in a letter to 120 college
and university journalism,
communications and ethnic
studies departments from the
State and Consumer Services
Agency, acting in behalf of the
Governor's Task Force on Civil
Rights.
The letter cited complaints
to the task force that "the news
media is not doing an adequate
job of covering minority com
munities, and news reporting
practices tend to add to already
existing community problems
of racial, ethnic and religious
intolerance."
The agency proposed a joint

project with one or more in
stitutions to study reporting
"styles" used to cover racial or
religious violence and in
tolerance.
It also suggested that college
students, working with the task
force, prepare a "style manual
or bulletin" to "alert news me
dia professionals to the ele
ments of reporting style that
have either positive or negative
effects" on racial or religious
intolerance and violence.
Secretary Van Der Volgen
defended the proposal, deny
ing that it represents govern
ment intrusion on freedom of
the press or other constitu
tional guarantees. "Our intent
is not to censor the press or in
fringe on the role of colleges or
universities," he said. "We just
felt there ought to be an ex
amination of the elements of
style of reporting to notify the

profession what things might
cause serious problems among
minorities."
Van Der Volgen said in
earlier hearings the task force
received complaints that news
media paid too much attention
to Ku Klux Klan meetingsat the
expense of minority communi
ty coverage and that news ac
counts sometimes included ra
cial references irrelevant to the
story.
"Instead of saying, 'A black
man held up a service station
last night,' it would be just as
accurate — and less inflam
matory — to say, 'A man held
up a service station last night,'
or 'A service station was held
up last night,' " he said. A bul
letin or style manual, he said,
could help reporters avoid
"adverse effects on the com
munity."
