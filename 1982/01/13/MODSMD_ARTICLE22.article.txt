# Mistake creates justice's holiday
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles— The author of
the law said it was designed to
give schoolchildren a holiday
on Martin Luther King's birth
day. But it turns out that most
of the state's judges will be get
ting the day off, too — at the
taxpayers' expense.
Due to an apparent mixup
that neither the author nor the
legislative analyst's office —
which is supposed to explain
such things — can explain, Cal
ifornia's Superior and Munici
pal Court judges will be getting
a 12th paid holiday this year —
a holiday on Friday that may
cost as much as $500,000.
Republican Assemblyman

Dave Stirling said partisan
bickering made it impossible to
push any corrective measure
through before Friday.
The whole thing started last
year when Elihu Harris, a Dem
ocrat from Berkeley, in
troduced the original bill in the
Legislature.
"We started with the intent
of a holiday for everybody,"
Harris said.
But he explained that when it
became apparent that the bill
could cost the state a good deal
of money — in terms of paid
days off, reimbursements and
the like — "we confined it to
the schools for fiscal reasons."
"The intent as written was sim

ply to close the schools."
Frank Zolin, the Los Angeles
County Superior Court's ex
ecutive officer, said that at that
time, he presumed the legisla
tion applied only to schools.
"But then somebody put a
copy of it on my desk," he said.
"Buried right in the middle of
the bill was an amendment to
Government Code 6700."
Somehow — and it seems
that nobody's quite sure how,
yet — the new law had been
written to amend the govern
ment code to include, right be
tween Jan. 1 and Lincoln's
Birthday, a new holiday,
"known as Dr. Martin Luther
King Day." Not just a school

holiday — a full-blown, state
wide holiday.
In most cases, government
supervisors can use some dis
cretion as to how to handle a
holiday. That, apparently, is not
the case with the courts.
The Code of Civil Pro
cedures, Section 134, specifies
that 'No Court... shall be open
for the transaction of judicial
business on any day specified
or provided as a holiday by
Chapter 7 (of the Government
Code), commencing with Sec
tion 6700.'
"Therefore," L.A. County
Counsel John Larson said, "Jan.
15,1982, will be a day on which
no court shall be opened for
the transaction of business."
