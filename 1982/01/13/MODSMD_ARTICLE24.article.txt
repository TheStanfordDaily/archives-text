# OSU turns Cardinal red

"The Orange Express" — that's what they call
themselves.
Sure it's a little cocky, but then Oregon State
has never been shy about its basketball team.
Stanford got a chance to find out why Monday
night in Maples Pavilion when the Beavers out
ran, outclassed and outscored the Cardinal
81-38. The humiliation was almost un
precedented. This was the second worst loss in
Stanford basketball history — home or away.
"Mother Nature brought a storm to the Bay
Area eight days ago," Stanford head coach Dick
Dißiaso said after the game, "and they predicted
another storm for Sunday's 49ers game. But it
held off a day and didn't come until tonight here
at Stanford."
So it goes.
What Oregon State did Monday night was
show, by contrast, how far Stanford is from
playing Top-20 basketball. Suie the Cardinal
held close for five orsix minutesof the game, but
then its deficiencies became blatant.
With the score tight at 11-10 OSU in the first
half and 13:31 remaining, Stanford's johnny
Rogers hit a fine 16-foot jumper from center to
pull the Card ahead at 12-11. But then the dam
broke. All it took was an A.C. Green reverse
layup and two Lester Conner steals-converted
to-points and Oregon State took the game away
from Stanford. After that (despite an almost
surge by Stanford with seven minutes left, high
lighted by a spectacular fast break slam-dunk by
Orlando Ward) the Cardinal drifted to a 35-21
halftime deficit.
The fact that Stanford only scored 17 points in
the entire second half says a lot about the rest of
the game. But the fact that no Beaver scored
over 20 points in the contest says more. Oregon

State denied Stanford an offense during the half
with its quickness. But then it showed the ability
to be patient, a trait so characteristic of head
coach Ralph Miller's teams. OSU will fast break
when the opportunity is there but the Beavers
will also work the ball around incessantly. No
player had 20 points in the game but four of
them scored more than 10.
In contrast, Rogers was the only Cardinal to
post double figures with 16 points. John Revelli,
Stanford's high scoring center only had nine and
Brian Welch failed to score a point. Stanford sim
ply could not move the ball, let alone get it in
side. It had 30 turnovers Monday night.
"They played super and we didn't," Dißiaso
said. "They took advantage of their great transi
tion game and quickness and forced us com
pletely out of our offense. Turnovers broke our
rhythm. They forced us to go one-on-one and
we aren't one-on-one players."
This is not a great Oregon State team by any
means. It is quick but inexperienced, fundamen
tally sound but also a touch green. As Miller said,
"We don't have any power players." They miss
Mark Radford, Ray Bloom and Steve Johnson
from the last two Pacific-10 Conference cham
pion teams, but they still have what it takes to
compete well nationally. They are 4-0 in the con
ference now and 11-2 overall which comes as
somewhat of a surprise after their shakey start.
If Monday's game was a tale of two teams,
Stanford fills out the darker half of the spectrum.
The program simply doesn't stand up to that of a
national power — not by a long shot. Never
theless, Miller sees Stanford as a valid com
petitor.
"I think we hit Stanford with a great game to
night," he said. "When you take them out of
what they want to do, you can make them look
worse than they really are."

coach Ralph Miller's teams. OSU will fast break
when the opportunity is there but the Beavers
will also work the ball around incessantly. No
player had 20 points in the game but four of
them scored more than 10.
In contrast, Rogers was the only Cardinal to
post double figures with 16 points. John Revelli,
Stanford's high scoring center only had nine and
Brian Welch failed to score a point. Stanford sim
ply could not move the ball, let alone get it in
side. It had 30 turnovers Monday night.
"They played super and we didn't," Dißiaso
said. "They took advantage of their great transi
tion game and quickness and forced us com
pletely out of our offense. Turnovers broke our
rhythm. They forced us to go one-on-one and
we aren't one-on-one players."
This is not a great Oregon State team by any
means. It is quick but inexperienced, fundamen
tally sound but also a touch green. As Miller said,
"We don't have any power players." They miss
Mark Radford, Ray Bloom and Steve Johnson
from the last two Pacific-10 Conference cham
pion teams, but they still have what it takes to
compete well nationally. They are 4-0 in the con
ference now and 11-2 overall which comes as
somewhat of a surprise after their shakey start.
If Monday's game was a tale of two teams,
Stanford fills out the darker half of the spectrum.
The program simply doesn't stand up to that of a
national power — not by a long shot. Never
theless, Miller sees Stanford as a valid com
petitor.
"I think we hit Stanford with a great game to
night," he said. "When you take them out of
what they want to do, you can make them look
worse than they really are."
