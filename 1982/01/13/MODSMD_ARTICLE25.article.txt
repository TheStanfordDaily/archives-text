# Some Deanian thoughts on 49er fever

### 
San Francisco (AP) — Fred
Dean of the San Francisco 49ers
obviously took the old one
game-at-time philosophy to
the limit on the last step before
Super Bowl XVI.
"I guess it's going to be a real
cold game," the All-Pro de
fensive end said after the 49ers
earned the trip to Pontiac,
Mich., by beating Dallas 28-27
in the National Football Con
ference title game Sunday.
When reminded that Pon
tiac's Silverdome has an
enclosed, well-heated field,
Dean smiled with relief.
' Dean, a seven-year National
Football League veteran, also
earned All-Pro recognition a
year ago with the San Diego
Chargers. But, feeling under
paid, he demanded a trade ear
ly this season and the Chargers
obliged by sending him to the
49ers, who gave him a new con
tract.
"I was glad to come here. I'd
been staying home watching
Super Bowl games on tele
vision too long," Dean re
called.
The Chargers were stopped
just short of the Super Bowl last
season, losing to Oakland in

the American Conference
championship game. This sea
son's San Diego hopes also
ended in the AFC title game,
with a 27-7 loss to the Cincin
nati Bengals.
Dean insists he was glad to
come to San Francisco even
though the 49ers were not con
sidered serious playoff conten
ders when he joined them.
In the first game Dean
played, the 49ers proved that
they would have to be taken
seriously. They trounced the
Cowboys 45-14, with Dean col
lecting three sacks, to make
their record 4-2, and they went
on to finish 13-3.
"I've changed a lot, I think,
from being in this kind of an
environment," he said, calling
Bill Walsh, the head coach and
general manager, the man re
sponsible for creating such an
enjoyable, winning at
mosphere.
John Jefferson, another All-
Pro who left the Chargers this
season because of money
hassles with management, vis
ited Dean after the 49ers' NFC
title victory. The talented re
ceiver sounded like a man who
would love to play for Walsh.

"That final drive was some
thing beautiful to watch. The
man (Walsh) is just a genius,"
said Jefferson.
The 49ers, trailing 27-21 with
under five minutes remaining,
drove 89 yards and scored the
winning touchdown on Joe
Montana's 6-yard touchdown
pass to Dwight Clark with 51
seconds left.
"We're going to go into that

Super Bowl game relaxed, I'm
sure, because we've been re
laxed all season," said Dean.
"We proved we can make
things happen. We came from
behind, and that's what it takes
to make the Super Bowl," he
added. "I don't drink cham
pagne, but if we win at Pontiac I
might make an exception and
take a few sips."
