The Stanford women's
basketball team slipped past
the Santa Clara Broncos last
night in Santa Clara, winning a
close fought match 73-70.
Senior reserve guard Angie
Paccione provided the heroics
for the Cardinal as she posted
20 points on 9-10 shooting and
had 7 rebounds in only 23
minutes of play.
"Angie really rose to the oc
casion," head coach Dotty

McCrea said.
Down nine points early in
the first half, the Cardinal
rallied back to take a 42-40 half
time lead.
The second half remained
close throughout, McCrea
said, but Stanford pulled up by
five points with minutes re
maining and held on to win by
three. Ann Miller, who had 14
Cardinal points scored the final
two winning buckets.
"Santa Clara played excep
tionally well," McCrea said.

"They shot 53 percent from the
floor but I'd say 90 percent of
the shots came from 10,12 or 15
feet. They just shot the lights
out of the basket. But we main
tained our poise."
This was the Northern Cali
fornia Athletic Conference
season opener for both teams
and McCrea felt the win was a
shot in the arm for the 11-4
Cardinal — particularly since
Stanford meets its toughest
NorCal competitor, UC-
Berkeley, this Friday.
