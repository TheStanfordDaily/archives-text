# Tankmen to face Wildcats
## 
### Nick Ferguson 
The waters of the Farm's
deGuerre pool should be
whipped to a frenzy tomor
row afternoon as the Stan
ford men's swimming team
takes on the University of
Arizona at 2 p.m. in an im
portant Pacific-10 Con
ference meet.
The Cardinal will be look
ing to avenge last year's nar
row defeat suffered in
Tucson. There, the Wildcats
clinched an exciting 58-55
victory with the very last
event, the 400-yard freestyle

relay. This year, with every
member from last year's
team back, Arizona is set to
try and do the same in Stan
ford's home pool.
Stanford coach Skip Ken
ney says he feels the Wild
cats have quality performers
in many areas, especially the
distance, breaststroke and
butterfly events. Doug
Towne leads Arizona with
his prowess in the 500- and
1650-yard freestyle events,
while Peter Evans made the
1980 Australian Olympic

team in the breaststroke and
Dennis Baker is strong in the
200-yard butterlfy.
To counter these threats,
Kenney says he feels a vic
tory in both relays, the 400-
yard medley and freestyle, is
a necessity. In addition, he
says the difference between
the two teams will come in
the performance of the
freshman swimmers.
Whatever the outcome,
the meet should prove to be
a thrilling matchup between
two of the nation's strongest
teams.
