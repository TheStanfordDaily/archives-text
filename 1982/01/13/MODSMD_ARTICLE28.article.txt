Soviets give Poland support
Moscow— Indicating satisfaction with the course of
martial law in Poland, the Soviet leadership yesterday
pledged full support for Poland and expressed confidence
that, with Soviet help, it would overcome its "difficulties."
The two countries formally denounced Western sanctions
against both Moscow and the military government in War
saw and <aid that the imposition of martial law on Dec. 13,
was a "purely internal, national affair of the Poles."
The declarations came in a joint statement issued by the
Soviet Tass news agency following two days of talks between
Polish foreign minister Josef Czyrek and Soviet officials — in
cluding, Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Mikhail Sus
lov, the formidable, 79-year old ideologist of the ruling Sovi
et party Politburo.
The talks with Suslov, a pivotal figure in Soviet relations
with Eastern Europe since the end of World War 11, are likely
to have focused on the future of Poland's seriously weak
ened Communist Party, which military rule has almost
eclipsed.
Czyrek, the first senior Polish official to visit Moscow since
the imposition of martial law on Dec. 13, met on Monday
with Nikolai Pegov, the 76-year-old Soviet party official who
oversees communist membership in foreign countries and
who, like Suslov, is a veteran of Stalin's regime. Western
diplomats said yesterday that Czyrek's chief mission may
have been to carry messages on party and economic matters
between Poland's military and party leader, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, and the Soviet leadership.
The communique issued yesterday quoted Soviet Foreign
Minister Gromyko as promising that Poland and its people,
"as before, could be certain of the Soviet Union's support for
their efforts in overcoming the dificulties facing Poland."
"The conviction was expressed," the Soviet-Polish
statement continued, that Poland "will, with the assistance of
its friends and allies, cope successfully with these dif
ficulties."
Suggesting a degree of harmony between Moscow and
Warsaw that has not existed for many months, the statement
returned to phrases customary between Soviet and other
Communist nofficials on formal occasions. It said Czyrek's
talks with Gromyko took place in an "atmosphere of cor
diality and full mutual understanding."
Although there has been little reason to doubt that the
Kremlin was pleased with the manner in which Poland's mili
tary leaders suppressed the Solidarity independent trade
movement under martial law, Moscow has refrained before
this from formal endorsements of the new regime in War
saw, apparently to avoid drawing attention to itself as the in
stigator of martial law in Poland.
Haig urges Europe to action
Brussels, Belgium— Secretary of State Alexander Haig
warned Europeans yesterday that the West "stands at a
crossroads" in the Polish crisis, and that failure to act now
"would not only assist the repression of the Polish people
but also diminish confidence about our reactions to future
events elsewhere."
In a formal address delivered before the International
Press Association of Brussels, following Monday's special
meeting of 15 foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Haig declared:
"We have spoken with one voice about these events. Yes
terday, we created a clear and united framework for action.
Now we must act. If we cannot take steps commensurate
with our words, then what shall remain of our self-respect
and the respect of others for our values, our rights, our
purposes? Do we imagine that we can purchase peace by si
lence and inaction?"
Haig's address and a question-and-answer period that fol
lowed was clearly aimed at confronting European public
opinion with the deep seriousness with which the United
States views the Polish situation, and also maintaining pres
sure on European governments to follow up Monday's
NATO communique with concrete decisions.
Meanwhile, it was learned that as a first step in carrying
forward the agreed NATO guidelines for political, diplomat
ic and economic measures against both Poland and the Sovi
et Union, there will be a meeting of economic experts from
the capital's of the alliance. They will begin detailed dis
cussions on implementation of coordinated action against
imports from the Soviet Union, air agreements, the size of
soviet purchasing missions in the West, export credit ar
rangements for Soviet purchases, maritime agreements, and
conditions of access for Soviet ships to Western ports.
Haig, meanwhile, said that the United States "is prepared
to go further" in economic actions to penalize the Soviet
Union, but "at the same time, Moscow has been informed of
our desire to pursue a more constructive path, if the Soviet
Union will reciprocate."
Brushing aside what he called "the myth that Poland's mis
fortunes are strictly an internal affair, and the West has no

right to take any action that might affect it,"the secretary
said: "The Soviet Union and Poland both signed the Helsinki
final act of 1975. The standards of freedom and diversity es
tablished at Helsinki have been violated. The process begun
at Helsinki has been put in jeopardy. We have both a right
and an obligation to point out this danger."
Court restricts appeal rights
Washington — The Supreme Court, siding with the Rea
gan administration in a crucial case, yesterday sharply
curtailed the ability of citizens' groups to use the federal
courts as a way of enforcing the separation of church and
state.
The 5-4 court said that Americans United for Separation of
Church and State, a prominent nationwide organization de
voted to challenging government benefits for religion, had
no right to sue in federal court to block transfer of a surplus
military hospital to a Christian college in Pennsylvania. The
court said the transfer had not directly hurt the group's
90,000 members.
In making its ruling, the court issued one of its strongest
denunciations to date of judicial activism, saying that the
courts were not "constituted as ombudsmen of the general
welfare," "college debating forums," or podiums for those
who would "roam the country in search of governmental
wrongdoing."
Yesterday's case was closely watched by the administration
as part of its campaign for "judicial restraint." Keeping such
groups out of the courts is central to the administration's ef
fort to limit the judiciary's power to intervene with the other
branches of government and with the states.
It also was watched as a test of Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor's commitment to Reagan conservatism, and she
did not fail the president yesterday. O'Connor voted with
the majority, joining an opinion written by Justice William
Rehnquist.
Lawyers interviewed yesterday said the decision clearly
would create a new obstacle for those contesting church
state issues, such as the use of government property for re
ligious exercises. Beyond that, many suggested that the rul
ing would send a clear message to the lower courts to shut
the door on many kinds of "public interest" suits brought
under the Constitution.
Solicitor General Rex Lee called it"the most significant"
ruling in a decade concerning the right to sue. "It will sub
stantially affect the extent to which citizens can raise public
interest issues in court,"he said.
Puerto Rico may be state
Washington — President Ronald Reagan endorsed state
hood for Puerto Rico yesterday, declaring that a new status
for the island commonwealth "would benefit both the peo
ple of Puerto Rico and their fellow American citizens in the
50 states."
The president chose a meeting with Puerto Rican political
leaders to reaffirm his campaign pledge to support state
hood if a majority of Puerto Ricans vote for it at a special elec
tion.
Gov. Carlos Romero-Barcelo of Puerto Rico told reporters
after his meeting at the White House that he hoped a refer
endum could be held by 1985 and that statehood could be
achieved "in this decade."
Romero said he doubted that a referendum could be held
earlier because the island's senate is controlled by members
who favor the present commonwealth status. The governor
called Reagan's remarks "the strongest statement any presi
dent has made."
If the people of Puerto Rico chose statehood, Congress
would be asked to approve the island's entry as the 51st state.
Reagan said that "while I believe the Congress and the
people of this country would welcome Puerto Rican state
hood, this administration will accept whatever choice is
made by a majority of the island's population."
Shortly before he left office, in January, 1977, former Presi
dent Gerald Ford sent legislation to Congress that would
have led to statehood if the island's 3 million residents ap
proved it in a referendum. But Ford's successor, Jimmy
Carter, opposed the measure and it died in Congress.
Puerto Ricans do not vote in presidential or congressional
elections, but those who move to the mainland may do so,
subject to local electoral laws. The island's residents are not
subject to federal taxes, because they are not represented in
Congress.
In his 1980 campaign, Reagan said: "As a commonwealth,
Puerto Rico is now neither a state nor independent, and
thereby has a historically unnatural status. There is this raw
nerve to rub, and our Marxist-Leninist competitors rub it."
Poland set to lift martial law
Warsaw, Poland — Polish authorities said yesterday they
would like to end martial law by Feb. 1 and include Solidarity

leader Lech Walesa in talks on the future of trade unions.
At the same time, the official media criticized farmers for
withholding food from market, and said the Soviet Union
would be Poland's "sole source of import supplies" in many
areas of the beleaguered economy.
Deputy Prime Minister Jerzy Ozdowski said at a news con
ference for Western reporters that Poland's authorities
"would like to end" martial law by Feb. 1.
However, Ozdowski said there was no timetable for end
ing the state of emergency declared Dec. 13, and a decision
on lifting military rule "depends on the situation."
After an initial period in which Gdansk dock workers and
Silesian miners clashed with security forces, official an
nouncements claim that workers have returned to their jobs.
But there have been unofficial reports of passive resistance
in factories and mines.
At the same news conference, government spokesman
Jerzy Urban said although Walesa's future is"unknown, he is
such a personality that a place will be found for him in future
agreements."
Urban and Ozdowski refused to say where Walesa has
been held since the martial law crackdown, which has led to
the internment of more than 5000 Solidarity activists.
Several hundred have been sentenced in trials by martial
law courts. But martial law authorities have not indicated
they planned action against Walesa. Official statements
about him have been deferential, probably reflecting his
high standing with Polish workers.
There have been various unconfirmed reports that Walesa
staged a two-day hunger strike, that he had been moved
from place to place to foil any attempts to free him and that
the government was considering banishing him to a
monastery.
Urban said talks had begun with "activists" of the inde
pendent union, but not with Solidarity as a whole. He also
refused to identify those said to be negotiating with martial
law authorities.
AT&T case may get hearing
Washington — A federal judge refused yesterday to dis
miss the government's antitrust suit against American Tele
phone and Telegraph Co., charging that both sides had tried
to "escape" submitting their proposed settlement to a full
public hearing.
"This court must make certain" that the public interest is
satisfied, "and I expect to do just that," U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene said. "The case is not dismissed."
The judge emphasized that he was not commenting on the
merits of the settlement agreement, saying that "I am de
lighted that a settlement has been reached." But he said he
was "somewhat concerned" lest strict legal procedures may
not have been followed in reaching the agreement.
Greene ordered both parties to advise him Monday
whether they will submit the matter to a public hearing that
the judge could conduct under the 1974 Tunney Act that al
lows third parties to challenge consent agreements during a
60-day comment period. The act is named after its sponsor,
former Sen. John Tunney (D-Calif.).
Attorneys for both AT&T and the Department of Justice
said they were willing to have the settlement explained in a
public hearing, although they disagreed with Greene that
they are legally required to do so.
If the law does require such submission under theTunney
Act, then Greene would have the power — after the public
hearing — to declare the settlement not in the public interest
— a power that neither AT&T or the Department of Justice
will concede.
Greene said that if the government and the giant com
munications company do not file the agreement under the
Tunney Act, he then will decide whether to resume the trial
and the taking of testimony that were cut off by the settle
ment agreement.
Stocks mixed, slip lower
Ne%v York — After several feeble attempts to steady, stock
prices drifted lower yesterday as investors continued to be
cautious about the direction of the economy and interest
rates.
Computer and oil issues were mixed after steep losses dur
ing the previous trading session, but American Telephone
and Telegraph Co. gave up some of its gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 2.76 to 847.70,
remaining at its lowest point since Nov. 19 when the index
finished at 844.75.
