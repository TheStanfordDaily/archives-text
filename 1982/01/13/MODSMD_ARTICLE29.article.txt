Photo meeting
Artie and Jae request — no, de
mand — the presence of all lab peo
ple (be ye night or afternoon lab min
ions) Friday at 3:00 at The Daily.
Party
Tradition has its place at even a
newspaper, and it is once again time
for the biweekly (that's once every
two weeks, not twice per week, how
ever hard some of us try) cocktail par
ty. All staffers are encouraged to at
tend; black tie optional. There will,
of course, be attractive — very attrac
tive, by the latest consensus — non
alcoholic alternatives as well as
harder fare. Friday, 5:00.
