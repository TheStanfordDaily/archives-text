# US foreign policy called simplistic
## 
### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
A Michigan congressman, who
chairs the House subcomittee on
African affairs, yesterday attacked
the Reagan's administration's failure
to understand that economic aid to
Africa ultimately serves the security
interests of the United States.
In two separate talks here yester
day — one during an international re
lations class and the other during an
evening speech in the History corner
— Congressman Howard Wolpe (D-
Michigan) emphasized that the Rea
gan administration's policies may be
counterproductive to U.S. national
security interests and to African sta
bility.
In an effort to differentiate itself
from the Carter administration,
Wolpe said the Reagan adminis
tration has shifted its emphasis in for
eign aid from economic to military
aid, which he said is contrary to U.S.
national security interests.
According to Wolpe, the Reagan
administration applies "the most
simplistic kind of labeling one can
imagine in determining who to sup
port and who not to support in
Africa."
Speaking before Political Science
Prof. David Abernethy's "Ethical
Dimensions of Foreign Aid" class,
Wolpe said that the long reading list
in the class contrasted greatly to the

much simpler methods used by the
Reagan administration in de
termining African policy.
The Reagan administration's out
look, which, according to Wolpe, ov
erlooks the complexities inherent in
individual African nations in favor of
a "good guys vs. bad guys approach,"
has led to some "silly decisions," in
U.S. policy toward Africa.
Wolpe criticized the Reagan ad
ministration's overt friendliness
toward South Africa because, he
claimed, the Reagan attitude signals
U.S. support for the South African ra
cial policy of apartheid.
The Reagan administration's South
African policy — which includes
slightly increasing the ties between
the two nations through such meas
ures as increasing the number of mili
tary attaches in the two U.S. em
bassies in South Africa and the train
ing of South African personnel in the
U.S. — is called "constructive en
gagement" by the administration, ac
cording to Wolpe.
Wolpe called the U.S. policy
toward South Africa "an enormous
high stakes gamble which could
jeopordize the interests of Africa and
the U.S."
On a trip through Africa last sum
mer Wolpe said that he found that
most of Africa viewed U.S. policy
toward South Africa as accomoda
tion towards its policies.
"The consequences of our actions
have been to reinforce the most in
transigent forces within the govern
ment of South Africa and to undercut
the reformist movements there," he
said.
The invasion of Angola is an exam
ple of the greater aggression prac
ticed by South Africa as a result of its
perception of U.S. accomodation
towards its policies, Wolpe said.
According to Wolpe, the U.S.
vetoed a United Nation's resolution
condemning the invasion.
The Reagan administration's ac
cession to power last year coincides
with a perceptible swing to the right
by the Botha government in South
Africa, which according to Wolpe,
was close to initiating internal re
forms last year but now is not con
sidering them. But, he added, there
are other internal reasons for the
Botha government's swing to the
right.
Even though Reagan's policies
toward South Africa are viewed by
the African community as an accom
modation towards South Africa, the
Reagan administration will deny this
and point to its formal opposition to
apartheid as evidence of its dislike for
apartheid, according to Wolpe.
Wolpe blamed South Africa for
causing instability within the region
because of its refusal to settle the
question of Namibia, where its
troops are battling a guerrilla na
tional liberation movement.
To counter South African apart
heid, Wolpe advocated a policy of
sanctions.
"Cumulative pressure can have an
impact on South African policies. I
think if we really did some things that
have bite such as prohibiting new
U.S. corporate investment in South
Africa we could have an impact on
policies there," Wolpe said.
"Even if those things make no dif
ference they advance U.S. in
terestsbecause they eliminate am
biguity in the U.S. policy,"he added.
