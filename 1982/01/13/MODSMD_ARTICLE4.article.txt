# Teller says disaster looms for America

### Heather Millar 
The United States, pushed by an
energy crisis it does not fully ap
preciate and competing with a rival
superpower of which it knows too lit
tle, may be facing "catastrophic
times," according to Hoover Senior
Research Fellow Edward Teller, who
spoke yesterday to an audience of 75
packed into the Lou Henry Hoover
Room.
Teller, a long-time proponent of
nuclear energy who was responsible
for some of the conceptual advances
that led to the development of the
hydrogen bomb, spoke primarily on
the theme of Energy from Heaven
and Earth, one of his latest books.
The "Tower Talk" was sponsored
by the Hoover Institution.
"The energy shortage is extremely
serious and could turn into a full
scale and catastrophic energy crisis
any day," Teller said. "Unless we get
more thoughtful people into Wash
ington, unless there is further great
change, we are facing not only hard
times, but catastrophic times from
which I do not think we will ever re
cover."
Teller said he thinks the Soviet
Union will precipitate the crisis he
sees coming. In Teller's view, the
USSR has made all the necessary
preparations for a military takeover
in the Persian Gulf: destabilizing Iran
and Afghanistan, making a client of
South Yemen. In such a takeover, the
Free World would lose 45 percent of
its oil supply, according to the physi
cist.
"They are stronger, much
stronger, than us," he said, "And the
Persian Gulf is in their backyard."
Teller expressed confidence that
the United States would weather
such a disaster "when" it arrives, but
said that the rest of NATO and the
Third World would not. Teller pro
posed that this would shatter the
NATO alliance and leave the Soviets
free to determine the nature of the

governance of much of the Third
World. "It would represent a quan
tum jump in the power of the Soviet
Union," he said.
The scientist, who was one of the
initial group of physicists to begin de
signing nuclear reactors in this coun
try, stressed energy, especially nucle
ar energy, as the key to bolstering
America's power.
"We must get energy from wher
ever we can. It's vital," Teller said.
Responding to objections about
reactor defects like those at Three
Mile Island and Diablo Canyon, he
contended, as he has repeatedly,
"There are 200 reactors in the Free
World, working for 10 years. In that
time, not one person has been hurt.
This proves that the safety of nuclear
reactors isn't a political question or
one of technology, but one of ex
perience!"
Teller also said he still opposed the
treaty banning nuclear weapons tes
ting in the atmosphere, saying un
derground testing made it difficult to
maintain the national defense. He
conceded that because of "scientists'
ingenuity," underground testing has
proved less hampering to weapons
development than he had expected.
But, he said undergroundtestingalso
has the disadvantage of making "the
rapid progress of the Soviets" dif
ficult to monitor.
"Today, we are facing an unknown
danger," Teller said.
However, the "Father of the
Hydrogen Bomb," as he has been
called, said he did not support a mili
tary counter-measure to the alleged
Soviet threat. "I don't like war,"
Teller said. "I don't like at all a war
that we are bound to lose."
Rather than military aggression,
Teller suggested subsidization of the
auto and steel industries, as well as
severe conservation measures. He
said auto traffic could be reduced by
one-third, air conditioning cut ex
cept in hospitals, and home heating

limited to one room.
"We must win by economics," the
speaker said. "We can win by great
sacrifice, but this is still not greater
than the sacrifice of blood."
The fact that these reforms have
not been adopted Teller attributes to
the government's lack of technical
understanding, what he calls "a tradi
tion unbroken ... . since Jefferson."
Among his acquaintances in Wash
ington, Teller claimed the ratio of
politicians to "good scientists" is

about 1000 to three.
"If this continues," he warned.
"The younger among you will live to
see. . . the United States as an under
developed country."
Teller voiced concern over what
he considers youths' "turn away from
science since 1945."
"It is absolutely necessary," he
said, "that we recognize that people
don't live by ideas alone; people
don't live by economics alone. Tech
nology has its place."
