# Stanford graduate Werner Disse wins Rhodes scholarship

### Cici Oremland 
Though he has achieved perhaps the
highest honor for which any college student
in the United States can hope, Werner Dis
se, a 1981 economics graduate, remains
modest and low-key about his Rhodes
Scholarship.
"I felt psyched then (when he heard he
received the two year scholarship to Oxford
University), but now that I'm working I've
kind of settled down," said the soft-spoken
Disse, who is currently working for a con
sulting firm in San Francisco until he leaves
for Oxford next October.
The Rhodes Scholarship is awarded to
citizens of English-speaking countries and
represents extraordinary achievement in
academics and athletics. The scholarship
was founded by Cecil Rhodes, whose goal
was to promote world understanding and
peace.
Hoping eventually to work in some area
of international business, Disse said he plans
to study British law at Oxford.
A native San Franciscan, Disse has spent

much of his life overseas. He attended an in
ternational school in Switzerland, where he
became fluent in both French and German
and then attended high school in Cape
Town, South Africa, where he was nomi
nated for his future Rhodes.
Disse graduated both from high school
and from Stanford one year early. Before
enrolling as a freshman here, he took off
two years to travel and to work. His ex
periences included working in a German
pain clinic and as a model in Paris.
"I used to think I had to do everything by
the time I was 30. But, now I'm beginning to
think more long term. I didn't even think
again about applying (for the Rhodes Schol
arship) until last year," he said.
The scholarship selection process con
sisted of both a written application and a
series of interviews conducted by previous
Rhodes Scholars. Though the process is
considered rigorous, Disse said he did not
find it too strenuous.
"Basically they ask you to submit an essay
about what you've done, about what you

want to do at Oxford and about what you
want to do after Oxford," Disse said of the
written part of the application.
He stressed that the interviewers were
primarily looking for an applicant's sincerity
in discussing ambitions and achievements.
"They (the interviewers) just want to get a
feel for you . . . they don't want you to say
what you think they want to hear. They want
to see if you really have Rhodes' points (in
tellect, character, leadership and "physical
vigor" for selection)," he said.
"Funny, Cecil Rhodes never had any of
those points," he joked.
While at Stanford, Disse was actively in
volved in the Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) Program during his freshman year.
One of his instructors, Jon Reider, recalls
being impressed by his maturity. "He was
always willing to extend himself, challenge
himself with classes that went beyond his
major," Reider said.
Disse also worked as assistant to Univer
sity Ombudsman John Goheen, whom he
met during his involvement with SLE.

Goheen remembers how Disse dist
inguished himself through his sensitive and
innovative ways in dealing with student
complaints.
"He was always full of ideas. He would
make an appointment to see the highest of
ficials at Stanford if he thought they could
help him. That's the kind of initiative he
had," Goheen said.
While working for the Ombudsman's of
fice, Disse helped to developthecurrent in
terview procedures utilized by the Career
Plannning and Placement Center.
But academic achievements are not the
only requisite of a Rhodes Scholar. Athletic
achievement is also required. Disse played
intramural tennis and basketball and was a
sprinter for the track team.
He said he hopes to continue his athletic
interests at Oxford and had considered
trying out for the Oxford tennis team. But,
he said, "I haven't really gotten to play for a
long time now that I'm working. I'll just
have to see."
