## Genetic material isolated 
### Kristen Christopher 
A team of scientists at
Stanford University has
isolated from a living cell
the clusterof genesand pro
teins that are necessary for
cell replication, an advance
which may eventually lead
tothe discoveryofacurefor
cancer.
The team is composed of
Nobel Laureate Prof. Arthur
Kornberg, Robert Fuller, a
Ph.D. candidate in
biochemistry, and Jon
Kaguni, a biochemistry
post-doctoral fellow.
Kaguni said their recent ex
periments have taken a sig
nificant step "by under

standing the initiation event
in simple cell replication."
This step, according to
Kaguni, may help to de
termine what causes the un
regulated growth of can
cerous cells.
The team's research has
involved a common bac
terium, Escherichia coli, re
ferred to as E. coli. Accord
ingto Kaguni, E. coli isa pro
karyote, a cell with only one
chromosome which is not
separated from the rest of
the cell by a membrane.
Two types of the bacterium
have been used for the ex
periments — a normal and a
mutant. "Other people

have isolated mutants that
are defective in replica
tion," Kaguni said. This
means that the mutant 112.
coli lack the specific genes
and proteins they produce
which allow the cell to make
copies of itself.
DNA, a complex protein,
contains all the information
needed for cell replication.
In a recent telephone in
terview, Kornbergsaid, "For
10 years now I've been
trying to figure out how you
start building a copy of that
DNA," according to the As
sociated Press.
The researchers proved

that they had isolated the
correct clump of genes and
proteins when replication
of the mutant type occured,
after the cluster was placed
in the cell.
The next step of research,
Kaguni said, will be attempt
ing to define the exact role
of each gene and protein in
the clump. While other re
searchers are studying the
replication process of more
complicated cells, Kaguni
said the Kornberg research
team will continue studying
E. coli because "even
though it is a simple system,
it is still not easy to ob
serve."

WILL IT LEAD TO A CURE FOR CANCER? — That's what many scientists are
speculating about now in the wake of the most recent success of the Kornberg
research team. Shown above left is Jon Kaguni, middle is Arthur Kornberg, and
