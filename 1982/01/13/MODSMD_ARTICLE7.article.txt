## Nuclear energy: unconstitutional and unsafe 
### (This is the first of a two-part interview) by Michael Abramson 
Peter Faulkner, an instructor in Stanford's
SWOPSI program, has spent much of his life
in the nuclear field. In a recent interview
with Daily reporter Michael Abramson,
Faulkner described his role in nuclear
energy, its history and its future.
After graduating from Yale and attending
Stanford Law School, Faulkner served as a
flying officer with the Strategic Air Com
mand. Following a six-year military stint, he
worked as an engineering consultant for
energy companies and NASA, and later as a
systems applications engineer for the Nucle
ar Services Corporation, where he designed
and developed quality assurance programs.
In 1974, he presented a paper to a U.S. Senate
subcommittee alleging unsafe practice in
the nuclear industry. Three weeks later, he
was fired and began working for the Nader
Public Citizen group, Friends of the Earth,
and other activist organizations. His book,
The Silent Bomb, published in 1977, details
the nuclear energy controversy in depth.
Q: How would you describe your position
on nuclear power?
A: I'm a skeptic. A lot of the technical
problems will never be solved — embrittle
ment of reactor pressure vessels, for exam
ple — and the economics are very dubious.
But much more important is the constitu
tional issue. Most of the legislation enabling
nuclear power was sponsored, marked up,
voted on by congressmen — membersof the
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy — who
received illegal contributions from energy
companies who stood to make a lot of mon
ey. It's clear that most of this legislation failed
due process because senators and con
gressmen were subject to undue influence.
People flinch when I document this. They
can't accept illegitimacy on this massive a
scale.
Q: Is it your opinion now that nuclear
power is unconstitutional?
A: In my opinion only, yes. We're debat
ing an illegitimate technology that was
deployed before the ethical problems were
addressed. There was never informed con
sent of the American people in any mean
ingful sense. The technology was never
tested properly before commercialization
and much testing going on today should
have been done long before the first reac
tors were built for electric power companies.
Take nuclear waste as a prime example.
Finally, it's clear that the American people
will end up holding the bag if there's a major
accident. The public takes the risks and
energy companies take the profits.
Q: Nuclear critics like yourself have been
accused of demanding an impossibly high
standard of safety. How do you respond to
'that?
A: By pointing to Three Mile Island and
asking people to put themselves in the shoes
of people in and around Harrisburg. If there
was a nuclear reactor out of control on the
Pacific coast just south of us and expectant
mothers and children were encouraged to

evacuate, you can be sure that several
thousands of others would get out of the
area and forever after demand a very high
standard of safety, certainly before that reac
tor ever started up again. Now if that safety
standard is hard or uneconomical for the in
dustry to attain, that's their problem. They
created the technology. Let them solve it.
Q: You've been criticized for being ex
cessively sharp, even biased in your com
ments about nuclear technology. Do these
criticisms bother you?
A: My SWOPSI class presents both sides of
the issue as fairly as possible. We've invited
several industry people to come and speak.
I've stressed that nuclear power does and
will continue to play a prominent role in our
society.
Now, outside of class I'm free to speak my
mind and I do. The fact that I'm teaching a
Stanford energy class shouldn't place any
constraints on my freedom to express con
troversial opinions. In fact, Stanford is prob
ably a healthier place to the extent that peo

pie are free to criticize certain technologies.
This is a perfectly legitimate part of the proc

should be the standard of legitimate tech
nologies in the first place.
The fundamental problem I see on this
campus is that technology is treated reveren
tly. There is little or no questioning by one
professor of what might be another's pet
project. I haven't heard much recently about
how laser enrichment methods for nuclear
fuel might contribute to nuclear weapons
proliferation, for example. The university is
an ideal place for debating these things and
Stanford would be. a very exciting place if
there ,were more debates of this type. But
questioning, being skeptical of technology
here tends to be treated as heresy, for rea
sons I accept and understand.

Q: SWOPSI has a liberal tradition on cam
pus. Is that justified?
A: Probably, but all the more reason for
nurturing courses on a campus with a very
strong conservative tradition. It's essential to
have a healthy balance of perspectives. Now,
that's not necessarily going to make Stanford
a comfortable place. But the last dean of the
Stanford Business School commented, as he
was leaving, that Stanford was, in his view,
becoming too comfortable. I'm not sure
what he meant. I am sure that SWOPSI pro
vides a very important counterweight to
male-oriented, technology-enthusiastic,
conservatively-taught courses and that Stan
ford is much better for it.
Q: How did you become interested in
technology assessment?
A: Dealing with nuclear weapons in the
Air Force and working for the nuclear in
dustry as an engineer. I'm looking at the
point where people and technology con
verge. By itself, nuclear power is not unsafe
— the plants are designed to heat water and
produce electricity. Nuclear weapons, on
the other hand, are designed to explode. Be
cause of this, I'm a great deal more worried
about nuclear weaponsthan plants. But both
technologies have been scaled up very
quickly without full testing in intermediate
stages. We have very little hard data on how
fallible people can and will cause these
sytems to malfunction while, at the same
time, our lives and environment are com
pletely at their mercy. In the case of both nu
clear weapons and plants, a lot of technical
and political problems were set aside so that
the technology could be deployed as fast as
possible.
Q: Could you give some examples?
A: The Manhattan Project was developed
without any debate over the ethical issues at
all, at least no public debates too place. Nu
clear fission plants were built starting in 1957
for commercial generation of electricity with
nearly all skeptical debate suppressed by
Chet Holified and Craig Hosmer on the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy. In the case of
both weapons and plants, the politicians
made a decision without consulting their
constituents — for national security reasons,
in the weapons case — to proceed as fast as
possible with technological deployment.
Most important was the assumption that it
was in the best interests of the American
people to limit debate to a minimum. The
democratic process simply broke down
completely. And now, several decades after
the key decisions were made, people are re
alizing they've been had. They are challeng
ing the technology in state initiatives, they
are staging sit-ins and nonviolent disobe
dient sit-ins at Seabrooke and Dio Diablo Ca
nyon, and setting up a network of affinity
groups — the Alliances — throughout the
United States. The debate is finally getting
underway, but it may be too late so far as nu
clear weapons are concerned.
Q: Why do you say that?
A: Nuclear weapons are, at least right now,
beyond control of the political process as it

exists. The American people are not in con
trol of weapons — the military is. It's true that
the President has sole authority for giving
the launch message, but who maintains,
deploys, launches and inventories these
weapons? Not the civilian sector. Now the
American public comforts itself with the
myth that the Department of Defense, Con
gress and the President are completely in
control of nuclear weapons and that our
country can go on indefinitely building and
deploying these weapons and using them as
diplomatic chips. Underlying this myth is the
assumption that somehow, someone will
come up with a way of dismantling this
absolutely insane armada. In the meantime,
most people have lost sight of the fact that
the military is in all but the launch aspect,
completely in control of nuclear weapons
and will probably resist any efforts to dilute
their control.
Q: What are the political problems here?
A: The problem turns on just how and
whether the American people can regain
control over nuclear technology in general
and weapons in particular. Both the civilian
nuclear industry and the military have very
effective ways of retaining control and limit
ing interference. Both can frame the issue,
when it goes up for debate, as one of eco
nomic expediency in the first case, and patri
otism or national security in the second. The
first argument has substantial basis in fact: if
the public wants more plants and increased
safety at the same time, it's going to have to
pay for them. Increased safety means more
federal regulations, interference, bureau
cratic control. In the case of nuclear weap
ons, the military will strenuously object to
being deprived of its trump card. A
thermonuclear bomb is the ultimate weap
on, one that gives the military un
precedented power and power once ac
quired is not lightly given up. I can see a na
tional referendum putting an upper limit on
the number of nuclear weapons funded by
Congress, or requiring the military to accept
the third-party inspection of weapons sys
tems. But neither of these amount fo sub
stantive disarmament steps. If the country
decides it is time to disarm and expresses this
in legislative form, the military is going to
feel very threatened. It's possible that a
small, patriotic group of colonels might try to
stage a coup, suspecting a Soviet plot.
Q: Do you really suspect that the military
might react in this extreme a way?
A: You have to understand that there are a

great many dedicated career people, many
with combat experience, who see them
selves as the last point of resistance to com
munist expansionism. At the line level, they
served on combat alert for a couple of tours
in missiles, subs or aircraft — all with nuclear
launch capability. They've been training for
the equivalent of an international 49er game
for the last 30 years. Every second or third day
the klaxon rings and they go running out to
their aircraft, start up and taxi down the end
of the runway, and then some referee comes
out and says, "Hold it, folks! Go back to the
dressing room. It's just an exercise." If you
look at the thousands of military officers who
have spent their entire lives getting ready for
nuclear war and whose lives might be said to
have been wasted unless there was some
kind of war to justify all this preparation,
then you can understand the psychic pres
sure that has built up. If the public votes to
take nuclear weapons from these people,
they are going to react in ways not altogether
predictable.
Q: Setting aside for a moment the prob
lems of military leaders' responses to dis
armament, what other problems do you see?
A: I'm very worried about the problem of
accidental weapons release. For the last 20
years or so, we've had subs off the coasts of
Russia and Russian subs have been on-sta
tion with missiles for exchange. The main dif
ference is in the success Russian subs have
had with missile technology and submarine
performance. You've noticed the recent
publicity given to Russian subs, presumably
with weapons on board, that had had to sur
face due to fires, mechanical failures and so
forth. Well, that is only the tip of the iceberg.
It's well-known throughout the Defense De
partment that Russian quality assurance —
planes, missiles, subs, computers — across
the board is substantially inferior to ours.
And this can be drawn from Russian per
formance in every deployed technology. For
example, how many high technology Rus
sian products do we import into this country
and depend on? Absolutely none to my
knowledge. Now, a reasonable inference
might be that Russian quality assurance in
sofar as nuclear weapons launch controls is
concerned is likewise inferior. A reasonable
conclusion would be that, if there was a
weapons release likely, it would probably be
a Russian weapon, assuming near parity in
the numbers of weapons deployed.

clear fission plants were built starting in 1957
for commercial generation of electricity with
nearly all skeptical debate suppressed by
Chet Holified and Craig Hosmer on the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy. In the case of
both weapons and plants, the politicians
made a decision without consulting their
constituents — for national security reasons,
in the weapons case — to proceed as fast as
possible with technological deployment.
Most important was the assumption that it
was in the best interests of the American
people to limit debate to a minimum. The
democratic process simply broke down
completely. And now, several decades after
the key decisions were made, people are re
alizing they've been had. They are challeng
ing the technology in state initiatives, they
are staging sit-ins and nonviolent disobe
dient sit-ins at Seabrooke and Dio Diablo Ca
nyon, and setting up a network of affinity
groups — the Alliances — throughout the
United States. The debate is finally getting
underway, but it may be too late so far as nu
clear weapons are concerned.
Q: Why do you say that?
A: Nuclear weapons are, at least right now,
beyond control of the political process as it

exists. The American people are not in con
trol of weapons — the military is. It's true that
the President has sole authority for giving
the launch message, but who maintains,
deploys, launches and inventories these
weapons? Not the civilian sector. Now the
American public comforts itself with the
myth that the Department of Defense, Con
gress and the President are completely in
control of nuclear weapons and that our
country can go on indefinitely building and
deploying these weapons and using them as
diplomatic chips. Underlying this myth is the
assumption that somehow, someone will
come up with a way of dismantling this
absolutely insane armada. In the meantime,
most people have lost sight of the fact that
the military is in all but the launch aspect,
completely in control of nuclear weapons
and will probably resist any efforts to dilute
their control.
Q: What are the political problems here?
A: The problem turns on just how and
whether the American people can regain
control over nuclear technology in general
and weapons in particular. Both the civilian
nuclear industry and the military have very
effective ways of retaining control and limit
ing interference. Both can frame the issue,
when it goes up for debate, as one of eco
nomic expediency in the first case, and patri
otism or national security in the second. The
first argument has substantial basis in fact: if
the public wants more plants and increased
safety at the same time, it's going to have to
pay for them. Increased safety means more
federal regulations, interference, bureau
cratic control. In the case of nuclear weap
ons, the military will strenuously object to
being deprived of its trump card. A
thermonuclear bomb is the ultimate weap
on, one that gives the military un
precedented power and power once ac
quired is not lightly given up. I can see a na
tional referendum putting an upper limit on
the number of nuclear weapons funded by
Congress, or requiring the military to accept
the third-party inspection of weapons sys
tems. But neither of these amount fo sub
stantive disarmament steps. If the country
decides it is time to disarm and expresses this
in legislative form, the military is going to
feel very threatened. It's possible that a
small, patriotic group of colonels might try to
stage a coup, suspecting a Soviet plot.
Q: Do you really suspect that the military
might react in this extreme a way?
A: You have to understand that there are a

great many dedicated career people, many
with combat experience, who see them
selves as the last point of resistance to com
munist expansionism. At the line level, they
served on combat alert for a couple of tours
in missiles, subs or aircraft — all with nuclear
launch capability. They've been training for
the equivalent of an international 49er game
for the last 30 years. Every second or third day
the klaxon rings and they go running out to
their aircraft, start up and taxi down the end
of the runway, and then some referee comes
out and says, "Hold it, folks! Go back to the
dressing room. It's just an exercise." If you
look at the thousands of military officers who
have spent their entire lives getting ready for
nuclear war and whose lives might be said to
have been wasted unless there was some
kind of war to justify all this preparation,
then you can understand the psychic pres
sure that has built up. If the public votes to
take nuclear weapons from these people,
they are going to react in ways not altogether
predictable.
Q: Setting aside for a moment the prob
lems of military leaders' responses to dis
armament, what other problems do you see?
A: I'm very worried about the problem of
accidental weapons release. For the last 20
years or so, we've had subs off the coasts of
Russia and Russian subs have been on-sta
tion with missiles for exchange. The main dif
ference is in the success Russian subs have
had with missile technology and submarine
performance. You've noticed the recent
publicity given to Russian subs, presumably
with weapons on board, that had had to sur
face due to fires, mechanical failures and so
forth. Well, that is only the tip of the iceberg.
It's well-known throughout the Defense De
partment that Russian quality assurance —
planes, missiles, subs, computers — across
the board is substantially inferior to ours.
And this can be drawn from Russian per
formance in every deployed technology. For
example, how many high technology Rus
sian products do we import into this country
and depend on? Absolutely none to my
knowledge. Now, a reasonable inference
might be that Russian quality assurance in
sofar as nuclear weapons launch controls is
concerned is likewise inferior. A reasonable

Faulkner
Peter Faulkner, an instructor in Stanford's
SWOPSI program, has spent much of his life
in the nuclear field. In a recent interview
with Daily reporter Michael Abramson,
Faulkner described his role in nuclear
energy, its history and its future.
After graduating from Yale and attending
Stanford Law School, Faulkner served as a
flying officer with the Strategic Air Com
mand. Following a six-year military stint, he
worked as an engineering consultant for
energy companies and NASA, and later as a
systems applications engineer for the Nucle
ar Services Corporation, where he designed
and developed quality assurance programs.
In 1974, he presented a paper to a U.S. Senate
subcommittee alleging unsafe practice in
the nuclear industry. Three weeks later, he
was fired and began working for the Nader
Public Citizen group, Friends of the Earth,
and other activist organizations. His book,
The Silent Bomb, published in 1977, details
the nuclear energy controversy in depth.
Q: How would you describe your position
on nuclear power?
A: I'm a skeptic. A lot of the technical
problems will never be solved — embrittle
ment of reactor pressure vessels, for exam
ple — and the economics are very dubious.
But much more important is the constitu
tional issue. Most of the legislation enabling
nuclear power was sponsored, marked up,
voted on by congressmen — membersof the
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy — who
received illegal contributions from energy
companies who stood to make a lot of mon
ey. It's clear that most of this legislation failed
due process because senators and con
gressmen were subject to undue influence.
People flinch when I document this. They
can't accept illegitimacy on this massive a
scale.
Q: Is it your opinion now that nuclear
power is unconstitutional?
A: In my opinion only, yes. We're debat
ing an illegitimate technology that was
deployed before the ethical problems were
addressed. There was never informed con
sent of the American people in any mean
ingful sense. The technology was never
tested properly before commercialization
and much testing going on today should
have been done long before the first reac
tors were built for electric power companies.
Take nuclear waste as a prime example.
Finally, it's clear that the American people
will end up holding the bag if there's a major
accident. The public takes the risks and
energy companies take the profits.
Q: Nuclear critics like yourself have been
accused of demanding an impossibly high
standard of safety. How do you respond to
'that?
A: By pointing to Three Mile Island and
asking people to put themselves in the shoes
of people in and around Harrisburg. If there
was a nuclear reactor out of control on the
Pacific coast just south of us and expectant
mothers and children were encouraged to

evacuate, you can be sure that several
thousands of others would get out of the
area and forever after demand a very high
standard of safety, certainly before that reac
tor ever started up again. Now if that safety
standard is hard or uneconomical for the in
dustry to attain, that's their problem. They
created the technology. Let them solve it.
Q: You've been criticized for being ex
cessively sharp, even biased in your com
ments about nuclear technology. Do these
criticisms bother you?
A: My SWOPSI class presents both sides of
the issue as fairly as possible. We've invited
several industry people to come and speak.
I've stressed that nuclear power does and
will continue to play a prominent role in our
society.
Now, outside of class I'm free to speak my
mind and I do. The fact that I'm teaching a
Stanford energy class shouldn't place any
constraints on my freedom to express con
troversial opinions. In fact, Stanford is prob
ably a healthier place to the extent that peo

pie are free to criticize certain technologies.
This is a perfectly legitimate part of the proc
ess of developing values for technology
assessment, for establishing what are or
should be the standard of legitimate tech
nologies in the first place.
The fundamental problem I see on this
campus is that technology is treated reveren
tly. There is little or no questioning by one
professor of what might be another's pet
project. I haven't heard much recently about
how laser enrichment methods for nuclear
fuel might contribute to nuclear weapons
proliferation, for example. The university is
an ideal place for debating these things and
Stanford would be. a very exciting place if
there ,were more debates of this type. But
questioning, being skeptical of technology
here tends to be treated as heresy, for rea
sons I accept and understand.

Q: SWOPSI has a liberal tradition on cam
pus. Is that justified?
A: Probably, but all the more reason for
nurturing courses on a campus with a very
strong conservative tradition. It's essential to
have a healthy balance of perspectives. Now,
that's not necessarily going to make Stanford
a comfortable place. But the last dean of the
Stanford Business School commented, as he
was leaving, that Stanford was, in his view,
becoming too comfortable. I'm not sure
what he meant. I am sure that SWOPSI pro
vides a very important counterweight to
male-oriented, technology-enthusiastic,
conservatively-taught courses and that Stan
ford is much better for it.
Q: How did you become interested in
technology assessment?
A: Dealing with nuclear weapons in the
Air Force and working for the nuclear in
dustry as an engineer. I'm looking at the
point where people and technology con
verge. By itself, nuclear power is not unsafe
— the plants are designed to heat water and
produce electricity. Nuclear weapons, on
the other hand, are designed to explode. Be
cause of this, I'm a great deal more worried
about nuclear weaponsthan plants. But both
technologies have been scaled up very
quickly without full testing in intermediate
stages. We have very little hard data on how
fallible people can and will cause these
sytems to malfunction while, at the same
time, our lives and environment are com
pletely at their mercy. In the case of both nu
clear weapons and plants, a lot of technical
and political problems were set aside so that
the technology could be deployed as fast as
possible.
Q: Could you give some examples?
A: The Manhattan Project was developed
without any debate over the ethical issues at
all, at least no public debates too place. Nu
clear fission plants were built starting in 1957
for commercial generation of electricity with
nearly all skeptical debate suppressed by
Chet Holified and Craig Hosmer on the Joint

was fired and began working for the Nader
Public Citizen group, Friends of the Earth,
and other activist organizations. His book,
The Silent Bomb, published in 1977, details
the nuclear energy controversy in depth.
Q: How would you describe your position
on nuclear power?
A: I'm a skeptic. A lot of the technical
problems will never be solved — embrittle
ment of reactor pressure vessels, for exam
ple — and the economics are very dubious.
But much more important is the constitu
tional issue. Most of the legislation enabling
nuclear power was sponsored, marked up,
voted on by congressmen — membersof the
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy — who
received illegal contributions from energy
companies who stood to make a lot of mon
ey. It's clear that most of this legislation failed
due process because senators and con
gressmen were subject to undue influence.
People flinch when I document this. They
can't accept illegitimacy on this massive a
scale.
Q: Is it your opinion now that nuclear
power is unconstitutional?
A: In my opinion only, yes. We're debat
ing an illegitimate technology that was
deployed before the ethical problems were
addressed. There was never informed con
sent of the American people in any mean
ingful sense. The technology was never
tested properly before commercialization
and much testing going on today should
have been done long before the first reac
tors were built for electric power companies.
Take nuclear waste as a prime example.
Finally, it's clear that the American people
will end up holding the bag if there's a major
accident. The public takes the risks and
energy companies take the profits.
Q: Nuclear critics like yourself have been
accused of demanding an impossibly high
standard of safety. How do you respond to
'that?
A: By pointing to Three Mile Island and
asking people to put themselves in the shoes
of people in and around Harrisburg. If there
was a nuclear reactor out of control on the
Pacific coast just south of us and expectant
mothers and children were encouraged to

evacuate, you can be sure that several
thousands of others would get out of the
area and forever after demand a very high
standard of safety, certainly before that reac
tor ever started up again. Now if that safety
standard is hard or uneconomical for the in
dustry to attain, that's their problem. They
created the technology. Let them solve it.
Q: You've been criticized for being ex
cessively sharp, even biased in your com
ments about nuclear technology. Do these
criticisms bother you?
A: My SWOPSI class presents both sides of
the issue as fairly as possible. We've invited
several industry people to come and speak.
I've stressed that nuclear power does and
will continue to play a prominent role in our
society.
Now, outside of class I'm free to speak my

conservatively-taught courses and that Stan
ford is much better for it.
Q: How did you become interested in
technology assessment?
A: Dealing with nuclear weapons in the
Air Force and working for the nuclear in
dustry as an engineer. I'm looking at the
point where people and technology con
verge. By itself, nuclear power is not unsafe
— the plants are designed to heat water and
produce electricity. Nuclear weapons, on
the other hand, are designed to explode. Be
cause of this, I'm a great deal more worried
about nuclear weaponsthan plants. But both
technologies have been scaled up very
quickly without full testing in intermediate
stages. We have very little hard data on how
fallible people can and will cause these
sytems to malfunction while, at the same
time, our lives and environment are com
pletely at their mercy. In the case of both nu
clear weapons and plants, a lot of technical
and political problems were set aside so that
the technology could be deployed as fast as
possible.
Q: Could you give some examples?
A: The Manhattan Project was developed
without any debate over the ethical issues at
all, at least no public debates too place. Nu
clear fission plants were built starting in 1957
for commercial generation of electricity with
nearly all skeptical debate suppressed by
Chet Holified and Craig Hosmer on the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy. In the case of
both weapons and plants, the politicians
made a decision without consulting their
constituents — for national security reasons,
in the weapons case — to proceed as fast as
possible with technological deployment.
Most important was the assumption that it
was in the best interests of the American
people to limit debate to a minimum. The
democratic process simply broke down
completely. And now, several decades after
the key decisions were made, people are re
alizing they've been had. They are challeng
ing the technology in state initiatives, they
are staging sit-ins and nonviolent disobe
dient sit-ins at Seabrooke and Dio Diablo Ca
nyon, and setting up a network of affinity
groups — the Alliances — throughout the
United States. The debate is finally getting
underway, but it may be too late so far as nu
clear weapons are concerned.
Q: Why do you say that?
A: Nuclear weapons are, at least right now,
beyond control of the political process as it

exists. The American people are not in con
trol of weapons — the military is. It's true that
the President has sole authority for giving
the launch message, but who maintains,
deploys, launches and inventories these
weapons? Not the civilian sector. Now the
American public comforts itself with the
myth that the Department of Defense, Con
gress and the President are completely in
control of nuclear weapons and that our
country can go on indefinitely building and
deploying these weapons and using them as
diplomatic chips. Underlying this myth is the
assumption that somehow, someone will
come up with a way of dismantling this
absolutely insane armada. In the meantime,
most people have lost sight of the fact that
the military is in all but the launch aspect,
completely in control of nuclear weapons
and will probably resist any efforts to dilute
their control.
Q: What are the political problems here?
A: The problem turns on just how and
whether the American people can regain
control over nuclear technology in general
and weapons in particular. Both the civilian
nuclear industry and the military have very
effective ways of retaining control and limit
ing interference. Both can frame the issue,
when it goes up for debate, as one of eco
nomic expediency in the first case, and patri
otism or national security in the second. The
first argument has substantial basis in fact: if
the public wants more plants and increased
safety at the same time, it's going to have to
pay for them. Increased safety means more
federal regulations, interference, bureau
cratic control. In the case of nuclear weap
ons, the military will strenuously object to
being deprived of its trump card. A
thermonuclear bomb is the ultimate weap
on, one that gives the military un
precedented power and power once ac
quired is not lightly given up. I can see a na
tional referendum putting an upper limit on
the number of nuclear weapons funded by
Congress, or requiring the military to accept
the third-party inspection of weapons sys
tems. But neither of these amount fo sub
stantive disarmament steps. If the country
decides it is time to disarm and expresses this
in legislative form, the military is going to
feel very threatened. It's possible that a
small, patriotic group of colonels might try to
stage a coup, suspecting a Soviet plot.
Q: Do you really suspect that the military
might react in this extreme a way?
A: You have to understand that there are a

great many dedicated career people, many
with combat experience, who see them
selves as the last point of resistance to com
munist expansionism. At the line level, they
served on combat alert for a couple of tours
in missiles, subs or aircraft — all with nuclear
launch capability. They've been training for
the equivalent of an international 49er game
for the last 30 years. Every second or third day
the klaxon rings and they go running out to
their aircraft, start up and taxi down the end
of the runway, and then some referee comes
out and says, "Hold it, folks! Go back to the
dressing room. It's just an exercise." If you
look at the thousands of military officers who
have spent their entire lives getting ready for
nuclear war and whose lives might be said to
have been wasted unless there was some
kind of war to justify all this preparation,
then you can understand the psychic pres
sure that has built up. If the public votes to
take nuclear weapons from these people,
they are going to react in ways not altogether
predictable.
Q: Setting aside for a moment the prob
lems of military leaders' responses to dis
armament, what other problems do you see?
A: I'm very worried about the problem of
accidental weapons release. For the last 20
years or so, we've had subs off the coasts of
Russia and Russian subs have been on-sta
tion with missiles for exchange. The main dif
ference is in the success Russian subs have
had with missile technology and submarine
performance. You've noticed the recent
publicity given to Russian subs, presumably
with weapons on board, that had had to sur
face due to fires, mechanical failures and so
forth. Well, that is only the tip of the iceberg.
It's well-known throughout the Defense De
partment that Russian quality assurance —
planes, missiles, subs, computers — across
the board is substantially inferior to ours.
And this can be drawn from Russian per
formance in every deployed technology. For
example, how many high technology Rus
sian products do we import into this country
and depend on? Absolutely none to my
knowledge. Now, a reasonable inference
might be that Russian quality assurance in
sofar as nuclear weapons launch controls is
concerned is likewise inferior. A reasonable
conclusion would be that, if there was a
weapons release likely, it would probably be
a Russian weapon, assuming near parity in
the numbers of weapons deployed.

nyon, and setting up a network of affinity
groups — the Alliances — throughout the
United States. The debate is finally getting
underway, but it may be too late so far as nu
clear weapons are concerned.
Q: Why do you say that?
A: Nuclear weapons are, at least right now,
beyond control of the political process as it

exists. The American people are not in con
trol of weapons — the military is. It's true that
the President has sole authority for giving
the launch message, but who maintains,
deploys, launches and inventories these
weapons? Not the civilian sector. Now the
American public comforts itself with the
myth that the Department of Defense, Con
gress and the President are completely in
control of nuclear weapons and that our
country can go on indefinitely building and
deploying these weapons and using them as
diplomatic chips. Underlying this myth is the
assumption that somehow, someone will
come up with a way of dismantling this
absolutely insane armada. In the meantime,
most people have lost sight of the fact that
the military is in all but the launch aspect,
completely in control of nuclear weapons
and will probably resist any efforts to dilute
their control.
Q: What are the political problems here?
A: The problem turns on just how and
whether the American people can regain
control over nuclear technology in general
and weapons in particular. Both the civilian
nuclear industry and the military have very
effective ways of retaining control and limit
ing interference. Both can frame the issue,
when it goes up for debate, as one of eco
nomic expediency in the first case, and patri
otism or national security in the second. The
first argument has substantial basis in fact: if
the public wants more plants and increased
safety at the same time, it's going to have to
pay for them. Increased safety means more
federal regulations, interference, bureau
cratic control. In the case of nuclear weap
ons, the military will strenuously object to
being deprived of its trump card. A
thermonuclear bomb is the ultimate weap
on, one that gives the military un
precedented power and power once ac
quired is not lightly given up. I can see a na
tional referendum putting an upper limit on
the number of nuclear weapons funded by
Congress, or requiring the military to accept
the third-party inspection of weapons sys
tems. But neither of these amount fo sub
stantive disarmament steps. If the country
decides it is time to disarm and expresses this
in legislative form, the military is going to
feel very threatened. It's possible that a
small, patriotic group of colonels might try to
stage a coup, suspecting a Soviet plot.
Q: Do you really suspect that the military
might react in this extreme a way?
A: You have to understand that there are a

great many dedicated career people, many
with combat experience, who see them
selves as the last point of resistance to com
munist expansionism. At the line level, they
served on combat alert for a couple of tours
in missiles, subs or aircraft — all with nuclear
launch capability. They've been training for
the equivalent of an international 49er game
for the last 30 years. Every second or third day
the klaxon rings and they go running out to
their aircraft, start up and taxi down the end
of the runway, and then some referee comes
out and says, "Hold it, folks! Go back to the
dressing room. It's just an exercise." If you
look at the thousands of military officers who
have spent their entire lives getting ready for
nuclear war and whose lives might be said to
have been wasted unless there was some
kind of war to justify all this preparation,
then you can understand the psychic pres
sure that has built up. If the public votes to
take nuclear weapons from these people,
they are going to react in ways not altogether
predictable.
Q: Setting aside for a moment the prob
lems of military leaders' responses to dis
armament, what other problems do you see?
A: I'm very worried about the problem of
accidental weapons release. For the last 20
years or so, we've had subs off the coasts of
Russia and Russian subs have been on-sta
tion with missiles for exchange. The main dif
ference is in the success Russian subs have
had with missile technology and submarine
performance. You've noticed the recent
publicity given to Russian subs, presumably
with weapons on board, that had had to sur
face due to fires, mechanical failures and so
forth. Well, that is only the tip of the iceberg.
It's well-known throughout the Defense De
partment that Russian quality assurance —
planes, missiles, subs, computers — across
the board is substantially inferior to ours.
And this can be drawn from Russian per
formance in every deployed technology. For
example, how many high technology Rus
sian products do we import into this country
and depend on? Absolutely none to my
knowledge. Now, a reasonable inference
might be that Russian quality assurance in
sofar as nuclear weapons launch controls is
concerned is likewise inferior. A reasonable
conclusion would be that, if there was a
weapons release likely, it would probably be
a Russian weapon, assuming near parity in
the numbers of weapons deployed.

Faulkner
Peter Faulkner, an instructor in Stanford's
SWOPSI program, has spent much of his life
in the nuclear field. In a recent interview
with Daily reporter Michael Abramson,
Faulkner described his role in nuclear
energy, its history and its future.
After graduating from Yale and attending
Stanford Law School, Faulkner served as a
flying officer with the Strategic Air Com
mand. Following a six-year military stint, he
worked as an engineering consultant for
energy companies and NASA, and later as a
systems applications engineer for the Nucle
ar Services Corporation, where he designed
and developed quality assurance programs.
In 1974, he presented a paper to a U.S. Senate
subcommittee alleging unsafe practice in
the nuclear industry. Three weeks later, he
was fired and began working for the Nader
Public Citizen group, Friends of the Earth,
and other activist organizations. His book,
The Silent Bomb, published in 1977, details
the nuclear energy controversy in depth.
Q: How would you describe your position
on nuclear power?
A: I'm a skeptic. A lot of the technical
problems will never be solved — embrittle
ment of reactor pressure vessels, for exam
ple — and the economics are very dubious.
But much more important is the constitu
tional issue. Most of the legislation enabling
nuclear power was sponsored, marked up,
voted on by congressmen — membersof the
Joint Committee on Atomic Energy — who
received illegal contributions from energy
companies who stood to make a lot of mon
ey. It's clear that most of this legislation failed
due process because senators and con
gressmen were subject to undue influence.
People flinch when I document this. They
can't accept illegitimacy on this massive a
scale.
Q: Is it your opinion now that nuclear
power is unconstitutional?
A: In my opinion only, yes. We're debat
ing an illegitimate technology that was
deployed before the ethical problems were
addressed. There was never informed con
sent of the American people in any mean
ingful sense. The technology was never
tested properly before commercialization
and much testing going on today should
have been done long before the first reac
tors were built for electric power companies.
Take nuclear waste as a prime example.
Finally, it's clear that the American people
will end up holding the bag if there's a major
accident. The public takes the risks and
energy companies take the profits.
Q: Nuclear critics like yourself have been
accused of demanding an impossibly high
standard of safety. How do you respond to
'that?
A: By pointing to Three Mile Island and
asking people to put themselves in the shoes
of people in and around Harrisburg. If there
was a nuclear reactor out of control on the
Pacific coast just south of us and expectant
mothers and children were encouraged to

evacuate, you can be sure that several
thousands of others would get out of the
area and forever after demand a very high
standard of safety, certainly before that reac
tor ever started up again. Now if that safety
standard is hard or uneconomical for the in
dustry to attain, that's their problem. They
created the technology. Let them solve it.
Q: You've been criticized for being ex
cessively sharp, even biased in your com
ments about nuclear technology. Do these
criticisms bother you?
A: My SWOPSI class presents both sides of
the issue as fairly as possible. We've invited
several industry people to come and speak.
I've stressed that nuclear power does and
will continue to play a prominent role in our
society.
Now, outside of class I'm free to speak my
mind and I do. The fact that I'm teaching a
Stanford energy class shouldn't place any
constraints on my freedom to express con
troversial opinions. In fact, Stanford is prob
ably a healthier place to the extent that peo

pie are free to criticize certain technologies.
This is a perfectly legitimate part of the proc
ess of developing values for technology
assessment, for establishing what are or
should be the standard of legitimate tech
nologies in the first place.
The fundamental problem I see on this
campus is that technology is treated reveren
tly. There is little or no questioning by one
professor of what might be another's pet
project. I haven't heard much recently about
how laser enrichment methods for nuclear
fuel might contribute to nuclear weapons
proliferation, for example. The university is
an ideal place for debating these things and
Stanford would be. a very exciting place if
there ,were more debates of this type. But
questioning, being skeptical of technology
here tends to be treated as heresy, for rea
sons I accept and understand.

Q: SWOPSI has a liberal tradition on cam
pus. Is that justified?
A: Probably, but all the more reason for
nurturing courses on a campus with a very
strong conservative tradition. It's essential to
have a healthy balance of perspectives. Now,
that's not necessarily going to make Stanford
a comfortable place. But the last dean of the
Stanford Business School commented, as he
was leaving, that Stanford was, in his view,
becoming too comfortable. I'm not sure
what he meant. I am sure that SWOPSI pro
vides a very important counterweight to
male-oriented, technology-enthusiastic,
conservatively-taught courses and that Stan
ford is much better for it.
Q: How did you become interested in
technology assessment?
A: Dealing with nuclear weapons in the
Air Force and working for the nuclear in
dustry as an engineer. I'm looking at the
point where people and technology con
verge. By itself, nuclear power is not unsafe
— the plants are designed to heat water and
produce electricity. Nuclear weapons, on
the other hand, are designed to explode. Be
cause of this, I'm a great deal more worried
about nuclear weaponsthan plants. But both
technologies have been scaled up very
quickly without full testing in intermediate
stages. We have very little hard data on how
fallible people can and will cause these
sytems to malfunction while, at the same
time, our lives and environment are com
pletely at their mercy. In the case of both nu
clear weapons and plants, a lot of technical
and political problems were set aside so that
the technology could be deployed as fast as
possible.
Q: Could you give some examples?
A: The Manhattan Project was developed
without any debate over the ethical issues at
all, at least no public debates too place. Nu
clear fission plants were built starting in 1957
for commercial generation of electricity with
nearly all skeptical debate suppressed by
Chet Holified and Craig Hosmer on the Joint
Committee on Atomic Energy. In the case of
both weapons and plants, the politicians
made a decision without consulting their
constituents — for national security reasons,
in the weapons case — to proceed as fast as
possible with technological deployment.
Most important was the assumption that it
was in the best interests of the American
people to limit debate to a minimum. The
democratic process simply broke down
completely. And now, several decades after
the key decisions were made, people are re
alizing they've been had. They are challeng
ing the technology in state initiatives, they
are staging sit-ins and nonviolent disobe
dient sit-ins at Seabrooke and Dio Diablo Ca
nyon, and setting up a network of affinity
groups — the Alliances — throughout the
United States. The debate is finally getting
underway, but it may be too late so far as nu
clear weapons are concerned.
