## Editorials Grads: attend meetings 
### 
While we must agree with ASSU Senate
Chairman Dave Phelps that compared to,past
years, the attendance by this year's
undergraduate senators has been
"spectacular," the upside-down timberline
effect of the accompanying chart as one
ventures into graduate and alternate graduate
senator zones, is nonetheless disturbing.
The Graduate Student Association (GSA) won
a fee assessment this fall, largely on the
argument that graduate students here feel
isolated and not a part of the University
environment. All programs seem designed for
undergraduates, they say, while graduate
students only this year received so much as an
orientation program. These complaints, while
likely quite justified, should serve as a source of
incentive and a mandate for those graduate
students who chose to run and wereelected to
the ASSU Senate — but clearly it hasn't. With the
exception of Dennis Romero, James McGrath,
Tad Hogg and Charlie Jackson, the graduate
senators have failed to utilize a means of
representing the needs of roughly 6000 fellow
students in an organization with at least some
power to address and satisfy their needs. While
it seems ridiculousto point outthat no one
forced them to run, apparently those senators
who feel the meetings not worthy of theirtime
need to be reminded that they assumed a
responsibility which they claimed to be
prepared to handle.
Perhaps the GSA should attempt to seek a
bigger role in the nominating of graduate
student senators inthefuture. Likely the best
solution, however, would be for graduate
students to put pressure on their elected
representatives to in fact, represent them.
In addition to adding volume to the voices of a
good half of the students here within one of the
few organizations in which they ostensibly carry
equal weight, full graduate student involvement
in the ASSU Senate would also beasign tothe
University that graduate students do not intend
to play a perennial backseat role to
undergraduates and would likely add weight to
any future requestsorcomplaints regarding
their status here.
