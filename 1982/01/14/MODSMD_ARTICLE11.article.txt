## Alec Rawls Redirect corporate taxation 
### 
Supply side economics, as Presi
dent Ronald Reagan has im
plemented it, needs some major re
working. Two problems stand out:
Reagan's view of taxation, and the
impact of his policies on the small
business and emerging high technol
ogy sectors of the economy.
Concerning taxes, the contention
is that cutting taxes will remove disin
centives to work and stimulate the
economy. But the focus is wrong. The
tax burden per se is not the most
damaging aspect of taxation. Rather,
damage is incurred when taxpayers
can squirm out from undertaxes, dis
torting economic activity in ways that
policy-makers did not intend. There
are presently, for example, huge in
centives to invest in tax shelters. Very
few economists believe that, if the tax
burden were watertight, changes in
the tax burden per se would have
much effect on economic activity.
On the personal income side,
however, Reagan has allowed
loopholes to run wild in Congress'
disgraceful partisan bidding war for
tax votes. We would be much better
off if Reagan believed his mandate
were to clean up the tax system rath
er than merely shrink the tax burden.
Clinging to his misguided priority,
Reagan wants to allow huge budget
deficits rather than raise the tax
burden. Budget deficits require the
government to borrow, competing
with other borrowers for the supply
of loanable funds. The result is higher
interest rates. The Fed has estimated
that in 1981 government agencies ab
sorbed 80 percent of all savings gen
erated by individual Americans. This
figure will increase in '82. Real in
terest rates, meanwhile, will not
abate.
Thus, budget deficits undermine
one key pillar of Reaganomics. What
is the point of massive tax cuts to pro
mote private lending if the govern
ment takes 80 percent of it back
again? On the other hand, the high
interest rates caused by deficits are
destructive to the economy.
Among the hardest hit is the small
business sector. The ill effects are
compounded in an era when the Fed
is already inducing high interest rates
with its tight money policies. Budget
deficits are far more costly than the
taxes to cover them, right from the
first dollar.
According to consumer advocate
Ralph Nader's research, small com
panies created 86.7 percent of all new

jobs between 1967 and 1976, while
the Fortune 1000 companies con
tributed less than one percent. Clear
ly, small business must be central to
any plan purporting to "revitalize"
the economy. But high interest rates
are not the only burden Reagan's
policies lay on small enterprise.
On the budget side, subsidized
loan programs have been cut 37 per
cent. Research and development
(R&D) funds drop in small firms while
similar projects undertaken by large
firms remain funded — this in the
face of a National Science Founda
tion study reporting that small firms
produce four times as many innova
tions per R&D dollar as medium
sized firms and 24 times as many as

large firms. Worst of all, basic re
search, the foundation of long-term
economic health, has been cut
drastically.
On the tax side, most cuts are
aimed at big business. Worse,
though, the corporate profits tax is
still in place. Equitable taxation does
not require a corporate profits tax,
which can be perfectly well effected
with the personal income tax alone.
Rather, the primary effect of the
corporate profits tax is to provide an
incentive for firms to reinvest out of
profits instead of returning profits to
shareholders who might invest it
elsewhere. The preponderance of
profits in the economy accrue to the
largest firms, and this tax tends to cut
this large source of capital off from
smaller firms.
At present, firms can reinvest
about $2 for every dollar they

withhold from shareholders. This is a
huge capital market imperfection for
small business to suffer.
Another problem is Reagan's poli
cy of not enforcing anti-trust laws.
The case against IBM, for instance,
accused of selling at a loss to drive
small competitors out of business,
was dismissed by William Baxter,
Stanford law professor and former
assistant attorney general, anti-trust
division, as "flimsy." Previous anti
trust prosecutors did not think so.
Equally worrisome is the present
trend of mergers, which Reagan con
dones. Small, medium, and even
large firms are combining at a fan
tastic rate, more than 60 billion
dollars worth in '81. The mergers are
testimony to the availability of funds
to large firms while small firms re
main parched.
The rate at which acquisitions go
from profitable enterprises to fail
ures is equally fantastic.
We should heed a recent New
York Time admonition, "When the
history of our times is written, the un
restrained mergers of recent decades
will replace the debacle of the stock
market of the 1920s as the cataclysm
most destructive to the nation's fi
nancial and economic foundations."
To counter the trend of mergers,
tax incentives to merge should be
eliminated. Eliminating the corpo
rate income tax would help. Anti
trust laws should be vigorously en
forced, and perhaps a moratorium
on mergers called.
Reagan seems to identify "laissez
faire" with his cherished "competi
tion." On the contrary, though, a
laissez-faire (hands off) economy
tends to create monopolies. Com
petition is the province of small
dynamic firms, not large stagnant
ones, allowed to throw their weight
around in any way to protect their
fiefs.
With typical flair, Reagan has
driven this glossy supply side eco
nomics straight from the showroom
floor — without working out the nuts
and bolts. If some mechanics don't
set to work on it soon, this ride may
last just long enough to leave us very
stranded.

government to borrow, competing
with other borrowers for the supply
of loanable funds. The result is higher
interest rates. The Fed has estimated
that in 1981 government agencies ab
sorbed 80 percent of all savings gen
erated by individual Americans. This
figure will increase in '82. Real in
terest rates, meanwhile, will not
abate.
Thus, budget deficits undermine
one key pillar of Reaganomics. What
is the point of massive tax cuts to pro
mote private lending if the govern
ment takes 80 percent of it back
again? On the other hand, the high
interest rates caused by deficits are
destructive to the economy.
Among the hardest hit is the small
business sector. The ill effects are
compounded in an era when the Fed
is already inducing high interest rates
with its tight money policies. Budget
deficits are far more costly than the
taxes to cover them, right from the
first dollar.
According to consumer advocate
Ralph Nader's research, small com
panies created 86.7 percent of all new

jobs between 1967 and 1976, while
the Fortune 1000 companies con
tributed less than one percent. Clear
ly, small business must be central to
any plan purporting to "revitalize"
the economy. But high interest rates
are not the only burden Reagan's
policies lay on small enterprise.
On the budget side, subsidized
loan programs have been cut 37 per
cent. Research and development
(R&D) funds drop in small firms while
similar projects undertaken by large
firms remain funded — this in the
face of a National Science Founda
tion study reporting that small firms
produce four times as many innova
tions per R&D dollar as medium
sized firms and 24 times as many as

large firms. Worst of all, basic re
search, the foundation of long-term
economic health, has been cut
drastically.
On the tax side, most cuts are
aimed at big business. Worse,
though, the corporate profits tax is
still in place. Equitable taxation does
not require a corporate profits tax,
which can be perfectly well effected
with the personal income tax alone.
Rather, the primary effect of the
corporate profits tax is to provide an
incentive for firms to reinvest out of
profits instead of returning profits to
shareholders who might invest it
elsewhere. The preponderance of
profits in the economy accrue to the
largest firms, and this tax tends to cut
this large source of capital off from
smaller firms.
At present, firms can reinvest
about $2 for every dollar they

withhold from shareholders. This is a
huge capital market imperfection for
small business to suffer.
Another problem is Reagan's poli
cy of not enforcing anti-trust laws.
The case against IBM, for instance,
accused of selling at a loss to drive
small competitors out of business,
was dismissed by William Baxter,
Stanford law professor and former
assistant attorney general, anti-trust
division, as "flimsy." Previous anti
trust prosecutors did not think so.
Equally worrisome is the present
trend of mergers, which Reagan con
dones. Small, medium, and even
large firms are combining at a fan
tastic rate, more than 60 billion
dollars worth in '81. The mergers are
testimony to the availability of funds
to large firms while small firms re
main parched.
The rate at which acquisitions go
from profitable enterprises to fail
ures is equally fantastic.
We should heed a recent New
York Time admonition, "When the
history of our times is written, the un
restrained mergers of recent decades
will replace the debacle of the stock
market of the 1920s as the cataclysm
most destructive to the nation's fi
nancial and economic foundations."
To counter the trend of mergers,
tax incentives to merge should be
eliminated. Eliminating the corpo
rate income tax would help. Anti
trust laws should be vigorously en
forced, and perhaps a moratorium
on mergers called.
Reagan seems to identify "laissez
faire" with his cherished "competi
tion." On the contrary, though, a
laissez-faire (hands off) economy
tends to create monopolies. Com
petition is the province of small
dynamic firms, not large stagnant
ones, allowed to throw their weight
around in any way to protect their
fiefs.
With typical flair, Reagan has
driven this glossy supply side eco
nomics straight from the showroom
floor — without working out the nuts
and bolts. If some mechanics don't
set to work on it soon, this ride may
last just long enough to leave us very
stranded.

Supply side economics, as Presi
dent Ronald Reagan has im
plemented it, needs some major re
working. Two problems stand out:
Reagan's view of taxation, and the
impact of his policies on the small
business and emerging high technol
ogy sectors of the economy.
Concerning taxes, the contention
is that cutting taxes will remove disin
centives to work and stimulate the
economy. But the focus is wrong. The
tax burden per se is not the most
damaging aspect of taxation. Rather,
damage is incurred when taxpayers
can squirm out from undertaxes, dis
torting economic activity in ways that
policy-makers did not intend. There
are presently, for example, huge in
centives to invest in tax shelters. Very
few economists believe that, if the tax
burden were watertight, changes in
the tax burden per se would have
much effect on economic activity.
On the personal income side,
however, Reagan has allowed
loopholes to run wild in Congress'
disgraceful partisan bidding war for
tax votes. We would be much better
off if Reagan believed his mandate
were to clean up the tax system rath
er than merely shrink the tax burden.
Clinging to his misguided priority,
Reagan wants to allow huge budget
deficits rather than raise the tax
burden. Budget deficits require the
government to borrow, competing
with other borrowers for the supply
of loanable funds. The result is higher
interest rates. The Fed has estimated
