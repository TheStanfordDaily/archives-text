## Khomeini foes oppose U.S. as well 
### 
Most Americans would gladly sup
port anyone working to bounce
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from
power. It would seem logical that
such an anti-Khomeini group would
welcome U.S. backing.
As is often the case with Iran, how
ever, the opposite is true. The 17-
year-old "People's Mujahedin," the
most formidable opposition to Kho
meini's ruling clique, doesn't want
our help, according to group leader
Massoud Radjavi.
For starters, the Mujahedin or
ganized grassroots resistance against
the American-backed Shah of Iran
arid has a long-standing grudge
against the U.S. government.
Moreover, the group is financially se

cure.
According to Radjavi, the mere ap
pearance of collaboration with the
U.S. would only play into the hands
of Khomeini's propagandists, who
have been characterizing the 34-
year-old exile as an American "pup
pet." And less than a year after the re
lease of the hostages, anti-American
rhetoric still plays well in Iran.
Despite its socialist leanings, the
"progressive Islamic" Mujahedin
isn't saddling up to the Soviet Union
either. In fact, Iran's Tudeh Com
munist Party, which has minimal
popular support, is one of the Mu
jahedin's chief nemeses. Moreover,
according to Radjavi, Tudeh mem
bers have been able to infiltrate Kho

meini's ruling power structure.
"What we want not only from the
U.S., not only from the Soviets, not
only from Pakistan .. . Iraq .. . Tur
key, Afghanistan," said Radjavi in an
interview with us at hissuburban Par
is residence, "is please not to in
terfere in our internal affairs."
Unfortunately, the Mujahedin's
quiet non-alignment hasn't en
couraged the United States to publi
cize the executions (including re
ported killings of children and preg
nant women), torture and other hu
man rights violations in Iran. Accord
ing to Mansour Farhand, a confidant
of former Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, "There are an
estimated 50,000 political prisoners in
Iran ... It is also estimated that an
other 50,000 dissidents are forced to
live underground."
