## Party politics fall way short 
### 
Back in the summer of 1980, under the proverbial
smoke-filled dome of Madison Square Garden in New
York, the Democrats came together in celebration of
their lackluster candidate Jimmy Carter and the ineffec
tual political platform put together then with the rueful
aid of Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
In fact, Kennedy's speech after Carter had been nomi
nated was acclaimed to be the most memorable event of
the convention — proving, if nothing else, that America
loves the Kennedys more in martyrdom than it does in
actual political activity.
At one point in the convention the lights dimmed and
a giant video screen was lowered. Delegates and millions
of Americans watching television were treated to a
somewhat tedious biography of Hubert Humphrey, who
unfortunately having died of cancer some time before,
was not there to view the film.
That he was dead was probably reason enough to pick
him as the subject; silently ensconced beneath six feet of
good cold earth, Humphrey wasn't likely to protest at the
rewriting of his little bit of history for the purposes of
Democratic propoganda.
The movie, accompanied by an effusive narrative,
showed Humphrey at different stages of his career: his
earliest days in political life when he was still a cherubic
and healthy politician, the latter days after his failed bids
for the presidency when he began to suffer from cancer,
and finally during his last days in the Senate, a frail,
emaciated old man, waiting for death.
The film was meant as a moral fable depicting, for the
edification of America, what it means to be a good
citizen and Democrat. But, blasphemy of blasphemies,
perhaps the most heroic thing Humphrey did was die —
and we all do that. A protege of Lyndon Johnson, Hum
phrey probably would have carried through the
bellicose Texan's Vietnam War policies had he been
elected president in 1968.
Humphrey was no great party leader. A great party
leader needs to be both a political compromiser and a
policy articulator, a man who draws together and helps
create a party's central vision of what America should be.
Unfortunately for the Democratic party, the unofficial
heir to whatever is liberal and progressive in mainstream
American political thought, for a long time there have
been no such leaders.
A more insidious reason for the film was to stimulate
emotional resonance among the Democratic Party
members, as there was little in the platform outside of in
dividual planks for individual interest groups around
which to unify a party.
The movie, a symptom of the declining American par
ty system, was typical of the Orwellian tendency in Amer
ican politics to rely on propaganda rather than on the
traditional building of a broadly based coalition of lead
ing citizens who have formed a consensus as to what pol
icy should be. Unfortunately for the hacks who weld this
kind of political newspeak, the allegiances stimulated
are as superficial as they are volatile.
The Republican Party also employs such dissimulation
oy using the tired rhetoric of individualism and free en
terprise when they are advancing great incorporated in
terests. The very word incorporation — the fnany in one
body — is opposed to individualism as Reagan under
stands it. We associate Reagan with the American west,
as if a Technicolored gunslinger from his erstwhile pro
fession were to have sprung to life and come to do

Mobil's bidding in Washington.
Beneath the semantic veneer of free enterprise, the
achievements of Reagan's administration are a re
markable memorial to the short-lived historical con
sciousness of the American people, representing a leap
back to the days of social Darwinism and economic sur
vival of the fittest.
Alas, the Republicans have an infinite advantage in af
fecting economic change because they have only one
special interest group to please — the rich — whereas
the Democrats have a whole legion of demons to satisfy.
Reagan has achieved what Carter never could have in
trimming the social programs. Still, though Reagan rea
sons that government spending contributes to inflation,
the president has merely substituted spending on social
programs, which is a way of redistributing wealth, for
spending on defense, which verily burns capital away.
Democrats, on the other hand, suffer not from policy
dementia but from lack of any clear policy. The Demo
crats were thrust into the central position as the most
powerful national party with the Depression. Fueled by
the desperation of that era Democrats were able to
dynamize American economic thought: private proper
ty was no longer to be sacrosanct.
But since then Democrats have failed to adapt to
changing economic conditions and have allowed plat
forms to evolve out of political expediency rather than as
response to economic necessity.
The Democratic party has grown into a dissimilar col
lection of malcontents, interest groups ranging from the
black man to the gay liberationist. Such a house divided
cannot stand — at the very least it promises to be a very
ineffectual house.
Social issues — Vietnam, racial prejudice, Watergate
— have become the foundation of the party. Further, the
Republican Party has had no trouble co-opting the Dem
ocrat's concern with social issues.
Reagan personifies the new Republican, who is rela
tively liberal on social issues but thoroughly conservative
on economic matters. Thus he readily appointsa woman
to the Supreme Court and the Democrats are left hold
ing.an empty bag of tricks.
If the Democratic Party is to reassert its control of the
direction of the American economy it must first develop
a unifying policy for economic development. It must
give up its effort to be all things to all men, to worry less
about alienating specific interest groups. Nor can the
Democratic Party afford to do less than homage to the
free enterprise system where it has proven effective —
for instance, agriculture.
And lastly, because the Democrat's central problem is
devising ways in which to coerce industry into social re
sponsibility — something the invisible and indifferent
hand of the market is not apt to do — it must pick its bat
tles carefully, to control only those segments of the
economy which free enterprise has clearly failed to ade
quately maintain: transportation, energy and health.
A party hack might respond that political expediency
always comes before the good in dictating policy, but the
future of the Democratic Party itself depends on its abili
ty to mobilize cohesive action. Such is political expe
diency enough.
