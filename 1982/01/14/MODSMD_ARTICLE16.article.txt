## Stanford men: thanks for awareness 
### 
I would like to express a heartfelt
thanks to Stanford men for their
awareness and consideration con
cerning the rape issue. There have
been several occasions in the past
few days when, for whatever reason,
I have found myself somewhere on
campus without an escort home.
As a liberated woman, the odious
choice between having to ask for
help or the very real fear of walking
alone is a difficult choice to make. It
is hard to overcome the mental bar
riers of being dependent on others
for something as simple as a walk
from Cubberley to Stern.
Amazingly, every single man I have
tentatively approached ("Where are
you walking?") has immediately of
fered assistance ("Where are you
going â€” let me walk you there.")
This offer accomplishes two major
purposes: most obviously it il
lustrates concern over the past at
tacks on women, and second, and I
would argue equally important, it al
leviates women from having to make
the difficult decision of whether or
not to ask for help. Instead of patron
izingly waiting for me to mentally
struggle with the repugnance of be

coming a burden, these men im
mediately volunteered their time.
I feel that on this and several other
women's issues, Stanford men have
shown a commendable amount of
awareness and consideration; an ex
traordinary willingness to make
"women's problems" "our prob
lems." Thank you Stanford men,
keep up the awesome job!

Values, objects differ
Peter Bachetti, a graduate student
in statistics, suggested (Daily, Jan. 5)
that we should cease to subordinate
our personal moral values to objec
tive measures of success like money.
It was a special pleasure to read
that a statistician emphasizes the dif
ference between values and objec
tive measures. I had blamed statisti
cians for such misleading measures as
the GPA (grade point average) or the
numerical averages of student eval
uations of teaching as indicators of
achievement in learning or in
teaching.

The average total of pinecones
plus pineapples plus horseapples per
year is no measure of the value of a
field, although each of those prod
ucts has its own use and value, as
has each course taught at Stanford
and each facet of teaching.

Perhaps statistics, like di'ugs, can
be pernicious in th 6 hands of laymen
although they are valuable in the
hands of careful practioners.
