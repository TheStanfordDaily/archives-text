Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers
Straight Ahead
Concord Records
Art Blakey may be a little older and a lit
tle greyer than he was when he started his
group, the Jazz Messengers, over two dec
ades ago, but one thing has definitely not
changed at all — he remains one of the
finest drummers, if not the finest, of
modern jazz.
Bebop drumming is a peculiar art. It
takes an indefinable combination of su
perb control and all out recklessness, a
combination that Blakey's playing
epitomizes. A few of Blakey's contem
poraries, such as Max Roach or Jo Jones,
may equal or surpass Blakey's technique,
but none is as good in creating a frenzied
sense of undiminishing swing. One half
believes that Blakey's drumming must be
the irresistible force that physicists
speculate about; certainly even a
lugubrious melody like "Taps" would
swing if Blakey were tapping his drum kit
in the background.
But though Blakey's position as a drum
mer is well established it may well be that
future generations of jazz fans will re
member him not asa musician, but as a tal
ent scout. The number of premier jazz fig
ures who first gained wide exposure
through Blakey's group is staggering —
Freddie Hubbard, Chuck Mangione, keith
Jarrett, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, and
Cedar Walton are only a few of the jazz ar
tists who can lay claim to having once been
"jazz messengers."

Yet Blakey may have outdone himself
with his latest find — the2o-year-old trum
peter Wynton Marsalis. Blakey can no
doubt lay claim to being group leader of
his new album, but just as clearly Marsalis
stands out as the main attraction.
There is little Marsalis can't do on his in
strument — his technique is formidable;
his use of dynamics tokens a musical
maturity far beyond his years; his improvis
ing shows great thought. But it is his tone
that may be most impressive.
Jazz trumpeters in general are careless
about the purity of their sound. They are
willing to risk an occasional screech if by
being careless they can increase the speed
and range of their playing. Long ago the
classical composer Czerny wrote a book of
exercises intended to help musicians play
faster; his book had the evocative title The
School of Velocity. I long wondered why
any musician would work towards playing
fast, if he were unable to play cleanly at
that pace. Nonetheless my doubts have
certainly not been shared by a whole gen
eration of trumpeters who have apparent
ly graduated from this selfsame "school of
velocity."
Probably the main culprit here was the
bebop master Dizzy Gillespie, who taught
the younger musicians that by giving up a
little of their tone, they could broaden the
range of their technique. Gillespie, make
no mistake, has recorded some of the
hottest trumpet music ever to be pressed
on vinyl; the problem was that his cavalier
attitude towards tone was imitated by
those unable to match his improvisational

prowess. The result was a lot of sad
screeching up and down 52nd Street. The
two trumpeters who promised to halt this
trend with their purer playing, Fats
Navarro and Clifford Brown, both died
before their influence could make itself
felt.
Wynton Marsalis has acknowledged his
debt to Clifford Brown, but really it was
unnecessary for Marsalis to say a word —
his playing is a greater tribute to Brownie
than the most eloquent testimonial. Onlya
handful of jazz trumpeters — Freddie
Hubbard, Oscar Brashear and Valeri
Pondmareu come to mind — have as
similated Brown's legacy, but none as fully
as Marsalis. Marsalis displays total control
over his sound: he can let loose a barrage
of notes, each articulated clearly, or he can
muster up a melancholy whimper remi
niscent of Miles. In either case his playing
demonstrates that fine sense of musical
taste that one does not expect to find in a
musician so young.
Marsalis, who has been signed by Co
lumbia Records, will have his first album
out as a leader in the near future. Marsalis
will be fronting a group of jazz heavy
weights on that disc — his rhythm section
will be Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and
Tony Williams. At the same time one hopes
that Marsalis will stay on with Blakey for
some time — bebop played this well is not
an everyday find. If Blakey can continue to
find musicians this good, we should hope
for at least a couple more decades of the
Jazz Messengers.

combination that Blakey's playing
epitomizes. A few of Blakey's contem
poraries, such as Max Roach or Jo Jones,
may equal or surpass Blakey's technique,
but none is as good in creating a frenzied
sense of undiminishing swing. One half
believes that Blakey's drumming must be
the irresistible force that physicists
speculate about; certainly even a
lugubrious melody like "Taps" would
swing if Blakey were tapping his drum kit
in the background.
But though Blakey's position as a drum
mer is well established it may well be that
future generations of jazz fans will re
member him not asa musician, but as a tal
ent scout. The number of premier jazz fig
ures who first gained wide exposure
through Blakey's group is staggering —
Freddie Hubbard, Chuck Mangione, keith
Jarrett, Wayne Shorter, Lee Morgan, and
Cedar Walton are only a few of the jazz ar
tists who can lay claim to having once been
"jazz messengers."

Yet Blakey may have outdone himself
with his latest find — the2o-year-old trum
peter Wynton Marsalis. Blakey can no
doubt lay claim to being group leader of
his new album, but just as clearly Marsalis
stands out as the main attraction.
There is little Marsalis can't do on his in
strument — his technique is formidable;
his use of dynamics tokens a musical
maturity far beyond his years; his improvis
ing shows great thought. But it is his tone
that may be most impressive.
Jazz trumpeters in general are careless
about the purity of their sound. They are
willing to risk an occasional screech if by
being careless they can increase the speed
and range of their playing. Long ago the
classical composer Czerny wrote a book of
exercises intended to help musicians play
faster; his book had the evocative title The
School of Velocity. I long wondered why
any musician would work towards playing
fast, if he were unable to play cleanly at
that pace. Nonetheless my doubts have
certainly not been shared by a whole gen
eration of trumpeters who have apparent
ly graduated from this selfsame "school of
velocity."
Probably the main culprit here was the
bebop master Dizzy Gillespie, who taught
the younger musicians that by giving up a
little of their tone, they could broaden the
range of their technique. Gillespie, make
no mistake, has recorded some of the
hottest trumpet music ever to be pressed
on vinyl; the problem was that his cavalier
attitude towards tone was imitated by
those unable to match his improvisational

prowess. The result was a lot of sad
screeching up and down 52nd Street. The
two trumpeters who promised to halt this
trend with their purer playing, Fats
Navarro and Clifford Brown, both died
before their influence could make itself
felt.
Wynton Marsalis has acknowledged his
debt to Clifford Brown, but really it was
unnecessary for Marsalis to say a word —
his playing is a greater tribute to Brownie
than the most eloquent testimonial. Onlya
handful of jazz trumpeters — Freddie
Hubbard, Oscar Brashear and Valeri
Pondmareu come to mind — have as
similated Brown's legacy, but none as fully
as Marsalis. Marsalis displays total control
over his sound: he can let loose a barrage
of notes, each articulated clearly, or he can
muster up a melancholy whimper remi
niscent of Miles. In either case his playing
demonstrates that fine sense of musical
taste that one does not expect to find in a
musician so young.
Marsalis, who has been signed by Co
lumbia Records, will have his first album
out as a leader in the near future. Marsalis
will be fronting a group of jazz heavy
weights on that disc — his rhythm section
will be Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter, and
Tony Williams. At the same time one hopes
that Marsalis will stay on with Blakey for
some time — bebop played this well is not
an everyday find. If Blakey can continue to
find musicians this good, we should hope
for at least a couple more decades of the
Jazz Messengers.

Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers
Straight Ahead
Concord Records
Art Blakey may be a little older and a lit
tle greyer than he was when he started his
group, the Jazz Messengers, over two dec
ades ago, but one thing has definitely not
changed at all — he remains one of the
finest drummers, if not the finest, of
modern jazz.
Bebop drumming is a peculiar art. It
takes an indefinable combination of su
perb control and all out recklessness, a
combination that Blakey's playing
epitomizes. A few of Blakey's contem
poraries, such as Max Roach or Jo Jones,
may equal or surpass Blakey's technique,
but none is as good in creating a frenzied
sense of undiminishing swing. One half
believes that Blakey's drumming must be
