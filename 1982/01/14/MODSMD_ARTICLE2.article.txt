# Fraternities respect members' views
## No biased ceremonies here 
### Kathy Olmsted 
No fraternities here force members or pledges to com
ply with secret intiation rituals, oaths or ceremonies
which promote discriminatory practices on the basis of
race or religion, an informal survey of all houses shows.
House officers of chapters of national fraternities here
said the Kappa Sigma fraternity— which had its national
charter revoked last month after it refused to reinstate a
ritual said to be religiously discriminatory — was the only
Stanford chapter that had discriminatory initiation rit
uals.
The officers insisted that their national organizations
do not require them to religiously discriminate against
potential members.
"We do not discriminate in any way, shape or form,"
said Tom Friedberg, admiral of the Alpha Delta Phi
fraternity, "not on the basis of national origin, ethnicity
or any other reason."
"We have no reason to stray too far from the national
organization," said Tom Blaisdell, secretary of Theta Xi.
"We don't see any reason to challenge it."
The Kappa Sigs had said their national ritual excluded
some Jews, atheists and agnostics from membership in
the fraternity. For the last eight years they had deleted
the segments of the ritual that they felt were dis
criminatory. When they refused to reinstate the national
version of the ritual, their charter was revoked.
"The Kappa Sigs charter didn't suit their needs," said
Mike Pepper, vice-president of Phi Delta Theta. "Ours
does. We have no reason to consider challenging it."
Richard Pops, president of Theta Delta Chi, com
mented that he thought most Stanford chapters have a
large amount of local autonomy.

"We've told national that we do anything we want to,
and they let us do it,"he said. "There's some measure of
prestige in having a Stanford chapter and it's a source of
revenue for them."
All the fraternity officers declined to discuss the nature
or content of their rituals.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student affairs, said
he believed the fraternity rituals were not dis
criminatory. "If that's what they say, I have no reason to
question it,"he said.
Robinson said Diana Conklin, director of the row,
read all of the fraternity constitutions to determine that
they do not violate the University's standards of "subjec
tive selectivity." But he said the fraternities have the right
to keep their initiation rituals private.
The only form of discimination that fraternities here
claim to practice is the barring of women from member
ship. The Theta Chi chapter is currently negotiating with
its national organization over the admission of female
members.
According to Theta Chi President William Atkins, the
national organization is pressuring the co-ed chapter to
comply with the national guidelines prohibiting the in
itiation of women.
"Right now we're in the process of negotiating to get
ourselves out of this dilemma," said Atkins. " We hope
that we can remain part of the national organization."
However, most of the other fraternities said they had
no intention of admitting women so they did not antici
pate problems with their national organizations.
"We will never allow women," said Marty Fuentes,
pledge trainer of Delta Kappa Epsilon. "That is one thing
we will never do."
