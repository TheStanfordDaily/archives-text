# Isleys try to play for everyone, while Jaco plays for himself
## 
### Mark Zeigler Isley Brothers 
Circle Star Theater
2 January 1982
The Isley Brothers have a
problem: they have to play for
two different audiences at
once.
The Isleys' concert per
formance has to appeal to both
young and old, filling that ever
so abysmal generation gap. But
in trying to please both parties,
they failed on both counts.
The older members of the
audience came to hear their
older, usually slower and
mellower songs. The teenage
crowd at the Circle Star Theater
wanted the legendary Isley
Bros, to play their faster,
funk/rock tunes. As a com
promise, the Isleys had a little
of both in their 90-minute
show. But it was painfully ob
vious that they played many of
these songs just for the sake of
pleasing certain audience
members. The fast tunes were
sloppy, while the slower ones
dragged on and on and on.
Nevertheless, there was
some gold to mine from the
Isleys' ore. The class and utter
professionalism with which
they deliver a concert is ad
mirable. The word ostentatious
simply does not exist in their
dictionary. Furthermore, their
poor showing was not all their
fault.
Many of the Isleys' problems
developed before they
stepped onto the Circle Star's
famous rotating stage. The the
ater's management got the
wrong "warm-up" band to
open the show, not to take any
thing away from Zoom's fine
performance. Zoom is a pre

dominantly funk/soul group
that appeals more to teenagers
than 40-year-old adults, who
made up the majority of the au
dience.
The Isley Bros, opened with a
speeded up version of "That
Lady," upholding that old
adage: haste makes waste.
They followed it with "Here
We Go Again," an extremely
deliberate tune, and it was time
to grab a pillow and catch some
shuteye.
The show dragged on until
the group's fifth song, "Sum
mer Breeze." The studio ver
sion contains a magnificent
Ernie Isley guitar solo. I im
mediately woke from my
dreams and eagerly awaited a
break in the singing.
Finally, with E. Isley's back to
me on the circling stage, I
heard the melodic whine of his
guitar. At first he stuck to the
melody of "Summer Breeze,"
but soon graduated to playing
complex, intricate riffs. As if to
say that what he played was too
easy, Ernie picked his guitar
with his teeth and behind his
back and neck with just as
much accuracy.
Ernie had the distinction of
playing with Jimi Hendrix
himself for a spell and the in
fluence is obvious. His style,
sound, and antics all reflect the
late great guitarist. If there is
such a thing as a Hendrix clone,
Ernie Isley is it. Dressed in
white with his brothers clad in
black leather, Ernie was cer
tainly the man of the hour.
But this Isley and his guitar
playing abilities are similar to a
star running back. If you don't
give him the ball, he won't gain
yardage and score touch
downs. Ernie's only opportuni
ty to solo at any great length

was during "Summer Breeze"
and relatively little was heard
from him for the rest of the
evening. Without Ernie, by far
the most talented Isley, playing
a key role in the game plan, the
Isleys are as flat as beer at a frat
party.
Next the group performed a
melody of old hits. They coax
ed ex-Spinner Philipe (who
happened to be in the au
dience that evening) to help
them "do some reminiscingto
gether." Lead singer Gerald
Isley and Philipe sang bits and
pieces of tunes from the late
'50s and early '60s. After the
reminiscing was concluded,
the two left no doubt in any
one's mind that they are truly
superb vocalists.
Two of the final three songs
were of the faster, funk/rock
variety that have drawn praise
from today's youth. The Isleys
possess a unique ability to syn
thesize funk and rock quite
successfully, without losing the
key elements of either entity.
One of these songs, "Fight the
Power," however, was played
so fast that it sounded like 45
rpm rather than the usual 33.
By the time they were fin
ished with "Stay With Me," the
final song, the Isley Bros, as
well as the audience had had
enough and hence there were
no encores.
The Isleys' performance
clearly demonstrated that they
have but a few options open to
them before they plunge into
the gorge of musical wash
outs. First, Ernie should break
with family tradition and start
up a solo career, one that
should hold success based on
his guitar playing abilities. Sec
ond, the Isleys should either
quite while they're still ahead

(i.e. retire) or figure out a way
to please everyone in the au
dience.
Perhaps they could have two
shows every time they visit a
city: one for the older folks
with lots of "reminiscing" and
one for the teens, including all
their fast hit songs from the last
five years. This way everyone
would leave the concert hall
fully pleased, not just partially
happy.
Jaco Pastorius — Word of
Mouth Quintet
The Old Waldorf/San Francis
co
7 January 1982
Some people are born with
silver spoons in their mouths.
However, a select few are for
tunate enough to be born with
a golden bass.
One of these elite is Jaco
Pastorius, the bassist supreme
of the jazz/fusion group
Weather Report. In the past
few years, Pastorius has formed
the Word of Mouth Quintet as
sort of a sidelight from Weath
er Report to further display his
awesome talents.
But like the small, quaint vil
lage that is discovered and con
sequently ruined by tourists
(e.g. Carmel, California),
Pastorius has abused his talent
by training the spot light on
himself in the Word of Mouth
Quintet. He has tasted the big
bucks and wants more. He has
seenthe limelightandcravesto
inflate his head with egotistical
air. Unfortunately, this is the
wrong way to go about becom
ing a legend in his own time, a
status he definitely possesses
the talent to achieve.
Pastorius' first mistake was to

recruit too good musicians to
accompany him in his Search
for the Holy Dollar Bill. But
Pastorius' loss is the audience's
gain. Don Alias (percussion),
Bob Mintzer (saxophones),
Michael Brecker (trumpet),
and Peter Erskine (drums) all
are far above the level of ade
quate. In fact, except for
Mintzer, the Word of Mouth
Quintet might contain the best
jazz musicians at their respec
tive instruments.
The quintet plays avante
garde fusion much closer to
jazz than rock, as Pastorius'
bass is the only electric instru
ment. A good deal of the con
cert material was drawn from
Pastorius' two solo albums. But
since Pastorius often plays the
melody of a song, the music
tends to be difficult to follow
with the absence of a consis
tent bass line.
The Word of Mouth Quintet
began with a few songs from
the two LPs. All the tunes fea
tured bass solos, which often
required extremely quick fin
ger movement, Pastorius'
trademark. He used all parts of
his bass with such accuracy that
it indicated he is always in com
plete control.
During the first song,
Brecker had his first solo in
which he displayed utter

brilliance with quick, but lucid
trumpeteering. And above all,
Brecker performed unpreten
tiously. He knows he is great
and thus is not compelled to try
too hard in improving this to
the audience.
But what is Brecker's
strength is Pastorius' weakness.
Pastorius is a superb bassist and
knows it as well. However, here
is where age and experience,
both on Brecker's side, come
into play. When putting his
abilities on exhibit to the
crowd, Pastorius acted like an
obnoxious kid — like a little
twerp, if you know what I
mean. Instead of simply
playing his bass in the awesome
fashion for which he is known,
Pastorius pretended he was im
pressed with every note he
strummed, like a child wanting
more and more attention.
And making Pastorius look
even younger was his behavior
when another member of the
quintet was soloing, especially
Brecker. While the spotlight
focused on the trumpeteer,
Pastorius would try to distract
the audience's attention to
himself by playing quick riffs.
But little Jaco will grow up —
let's hope.
The best song of the evening
by Pastorius et. al. was "The
Jacket" by James Brown, an up

beat, rhythmy tune with a rela
tively simple baseline. The
song featured a Pastorius bass
solo, with just drummer
Erskine accompanying. At this
time it became clear as day who
was the evening's best per
former.
Erskine kept the rhythm of
Pastorius' solo with superior
precision. He did not miss a
beat during the entire show, as
every lash of his sticks on a
drum or a symbol was right on
time. In a word, he was perfect.-
Two songs later, Erskine re
ceived his long overdue ap
plause after a brilliant solo in
which he played both quietly
and loudly, adding anotheifl
dimension to his already vast
repertoire of drumming abili
ties. The name Erskine should
be mentioned in the same
breath as De Johnette,
Cobham, and Gadd.
The audience's obvious dis
appointment with Pastorius
was evidenced by anemic ap
plause after the last song, re
sulting in the prompt con
clusion of the show without an
encore. If one had closed his
eyes, just listening to Pastorius,
the concert was great. But
open them up and view his on
stage antics, and the show was
mediocre at best.

professionalism with which
they deliver a concert is ad
mirable. The word ostentatious
simply does not exist in their
dictionary. Furthermore, their
poor showing was not all their
fault.
Many of the Isleys' problems
developed before they
stepped onto the Circle Star's
famous rotating stage. The the
ater's management got the
wrong "warm-up" band to
open the show, not to take any
thing away from Zoom's fine
performance. Zoom is a pre

dominantly funk/soul group
that appeals more to teenagers
than 40-year-old adults, who
made up the majority of the au
dience.
The Isley Bros, opened with a
speeded up version of "That
Lady," upholding that old
adage: haste makes waste.
They followed it with "Here
We Go Again," an extremely
deliberate tune, and it was time
to grab a pillow and catch some
shuteye.
The show dragged on until
the group's fifth song, "Sum
mer Breeze." The studio ver
sion contains a magnificent
Ernie Isley guitar solo. I im
mediately woke from my
dreams and eagerly awaited a
break in the singing.
Finally, with E. Isley's back to
me on the circling stage, I
heard the melodic whine of his
guitar. At first he stuck to the
melody of "Summer Breeze,"
but soon graduated to playing
complex, intricate riffs. As if to
say that what he played was too
easy, Ernie picked his guitar
with his teeth and behind his
back and neck with just as
much accuracy.
Ernie had the distinction of
playing with Jimi Hendrix
himself for a spell and the in
fluence is obvious. His style,
sound, and antics all reflect the
late great guitarist. If there is
such a thing as a Hendrix clone,
Ernie Isley is it. Dressed in
white with his brothers clad in
black leather, Ernie was cer
tainly the man of the hour.
But this Isley and his guitar
playing abilities are similar to a
star running back. If you don't
give him the ball, he won't gain
yardage and score touch
downs. Ernie's only opportuni
ty to solo at any great length

was during "Summer Breeze"
and relatively little was heard
from him for the rest of the
evening. Without Ernie, by far
the most talented Isley, playing
a key role in the game plan, the
Isleys are as flat as beer at a frat
party.
Next the group performed a
melody of old hits. They coax
ed ex-Spinner Philipe (who
happened to be in the au
dience that evening) to help
them "do some reminiscingto
gether." Lead singer Gerald
Isley and Philipe sang bits and
pieces of tunes from the late
'50s and early '60s. After the
reminiscing was concluded,
the two left no doubt in any
one's mind that they are truly
superb vocalists.
Two of the final three songs
were of the faster, funk/rock
variety that have drawn praise
from today's youth. The Isleys
possess a unique ability to syn
thesize funk and rock quite
successfully, without losing the
key elements of either entity.
One of these songs, "Fight the
Power," however, was played
so fast that it sounded like 45
rpm rather than the usual 33.
By the time they were fin
ished with "Stay With Me," the
final song, the Isley Bros, as
well as the audience had had
enough and hence there were
no encores.
The Isleys' performance
clearly demonstrated that they
have but a few options open to
them before they plunge into
the gorge of musical wash
outs. First, Ernie should break
with family tradition and start
up a solo career, one that
should hold success based on
his guitar playing abilities. Sec
ond, the Isleys should either
quite while they're still ahead

(i.e. retire) or figure out a way
to please everyone in the au
dience.
Perhaps they could have two
shows every time they visit a
city: one for the older folks
with lots of "reminiscing" and
one for the teens, including all
their fast hit songs from the last
five years. This way everyone
would leave the concert hall
fully pleased, not just partially
happy.
Jaco Pastorius — Word of
Mouth Quintet
The Old Waldorf/San Francis
co
7 January 1982
Some people are born with
silver spoons in their mouths.
However, a select few are for
tunate enough to be born with
a golden bass.
One of these elite is Jaco
Pastorius, the bassist supreme
of the jazz/fusion group
Weather Report. In the past
few years, Pastorius has formed
the Word of Mouth Quintet as
sort of a sidelight from Weath
er Report to further display his
awesome talents.
But like the small, quaint vil
lage that is discovered and con
sequently ruined by tourists
(e.g. Carmel, California),
Pastorius has abused his talent
by training the spot light on
himself in the Word of Mouth
Quintet. He has tasted the big
bucks and wants more. He has
seenthe limelightandcravesto
inflate his head with egotistical
air. Unfortunately, this is the
wrong way to go about becom
ing a legend in his own time, a
status he definitely possesses
the talent to achieve.
Pastorius' first mistake was to

recruit too good musicians to
accompany him in his Search
for the Holy Dollar Bill. But
Pastorius' loss is the audience's
gain. Don Alias (percussion),
Bob Mintzer (saxophones),
Michael Brecker (trumpet),
and Peter Erskine (drums) all
are far above the level of ade
quate. In fact, except for
Mintzer, the Word of Mouth
Quintet might contain the best
jazz musicians at their respec
tive instruments.
The quintet plays avante
garde fusion much closer to
jazz than rock, as Pastorius'
bass is the only electric instru
ment. A good deal of the con
cert material was drawn from
Pastorius' two solo albums. But
since Pastorius often plays the
melody of a song, the music
tends to be difficult to follow
with the absence of a consis
tent bass line.
The Word of Mouth Quintet
began with a few songs from
the two LPs. All the tunes fea
tured bass solos, which often
required extremely quick fin
ger movement, Pastorius'
trademark. He used all parts of
his bass with such accuracy that
it indicated he is always in com
plete control.
During the first song,
Brecker had his first solo in
which he displayed utter

brilliance with quick, but lucid
trumpeteering. And above all,
Brecker performed unpreten
tiously. He knows he is great
and thus is not compelled to try
too hard in improving this to
the audience.
But what is Brecker's
strength is Pastorius' weakness.
Pastorius is a superb bassist and
knows it as well. However, here
is where age and experience,
both on Brecker's side, come
into play. When putting his
abilities on exhibit to the
crowd, Pastorius acted like an
obnoxious kid — like a little
twerp, if you know what I
mean. Instead of simply
playing his bass in the awesome
fashion for which he is known,
Pastorius pretended he was im
pressed with every note he
strummed, like a child wanting
more and more attention.
And making Pastorius look
even younger was his behavior
when another member of the
quintet was soloing, especially
Brecker. While the spotlight
focused on the trumpeteer,
Pastorius would try to distract
the audience's attention to
himself by playing quick riffs.
But little Jaco will grow up —
let's hope.
The best song of the evening
by Pastorius et. al. was "The
Jacket" by James Brown, an up

beat, rhythmy tune with a rela
tively simple baseline. The
song featured a Pastorius bass
solo, with just drummer
Erskine accompanying. At this
time it became clear as day who
was the evening's best per
former.
Erskine kept the rhythm of
Pastorius' solo with superior
precision. He did not miss a
beat during the entire show, as
every lash of his sticks on a
drum or a symbol was right on
time. In a word, he was perfect.-
Two songs later, Erskine re
ceived his long overdue ap
plause after a brilliant solo in
which he played both quietly
and loudly, adding anotheifl
dimension to his already vast
repertoire of drumming abili
ties. The name Erskine should
be mentioned in the same
breath as De Johnette,
Cobham, and Gadd.
The audience's obvious dis
appointment with Pastorius
was evidenced by anemic ap
plause after the last song, re
sulting in the prompt con
clusion of the show without an
encore. If one had closed his
eyes, just listening to Pastorius,
the concert was great. But
open them up and view his on
stage antics, and the show was
mediocre at best.
Circle Star Theater
2 January 1982
The Isley Brothers have a
problem: they have to play for
two different audiences at
once.
The Isleys' concert per
formance has to appeal to both
young and old, filling that ever
so abysmal generation gap. But
in trying to please both parties,
they failed on both counts.
The older members of the
audience came to hear their
older, usually slower and
mellower songs. The teenage
crowd at the Circle Star Theater
wanted the legendary Isley
Bros, to play their faster,
funk/rock tunes. As a com
promise, the Isleys had a little
of both in their 90-minute
show. But it was painfully ob
vious that they played many of
these songs just for the sake of
pleasing certain audience
members. The fast tunes were
sloppy, while the slower ones
dragged on and on and on.
Nevertheless, there was
some gold to mine from the
Isleys' ore. The class and utter
professionalism with which
they deliver a concert is ad
mirable. The word ostentatious
simply does not exist in their
dictionary. Furthermore, their

sion contains a magnificent
Ernie Isley guitar solo. I im
mediately woke from my
dreams and eagerly awaited a
break in the singing.
Finally, with E. Isley's back to
me on the circling stage, I
heard the melodic whine of his
guitar. At first he stuck to the
melody of "Summer Breeze,"
but soon graduated to playing
complex, intricate riffs. As if to
say that what he played was too
easy, Ernie picked his guitar
with his teeth and behind his
back and neck with just as
much accuracy.
Ernie had the distinction of
playing with Jimi Hendrix
himself for a spell and the in
fluence is obvious. His style,
sound, and antics all reflect the
late great guitarist. If there is
such a thing as a Hendrix clone,
Ernie Isley is it. Dressed in
white with his brothers clad in
black leather, Ernie was cer
tainly the man of the hour.
But this Isley and his guitar
playing abilities are similar to a
star running back. If you don't
give him the ball, he won't gain
yardage and score touch
downs. Ernie's only opportuni
ty to solo at any great length

was during "Summer Breeze"
and relatively little was heard
from him for the rest of the
evening. Without Ernie, by far
the most talented Isley, playing
a key role in the game plan, the
Isleys are as flat as beer at a frat
party.
Next the group performed a
melody of old hits. They coax
ed ex-Spinner Philipe (who
happened to be in the au
dience that evening) to help
them "do some reminiscingto
gether." Lead singer Gerald
Isley and Philipe sang bits and
pieces of tunes from the late
'50s and early '60s. After the
reminiscing was concluded,
the two left no doubt in any
one's mind that they are truly
superb vocalists.
Two of the final three songs
were of the faster, funk/rock
variety that have drawn praise
from today's youth. The Isleys
possess a unique ability to syn
thesize funk and rock quite
successfully, without losing the
key elements of either entity.
One of these songs, "Fight the
Power," however, was played
so fast that it sounded like 45
rpm rather than the usual 33.
By the time they were fin
ished with "Stay With Me," the
final song, the Isley Bros, as
well as the audience had had
enough and hence there were
no encores.
The Isleys' performance
clearly demonstrated that they
have but a few options open to
them before they plunge into
the gorge of musical wash
outs. First, Ernie should break
with family tradition and start
up a solo career, one that
should hold success based on
his guitar playing abilities. Sec
ond, the Isleys should either
quite while they're still ahead

(i.e. retire) or figure out a way
to please everyone in the au
dience.
Perhaps they could have two
shows every time they visit a
city: one for the older folks
with lots of "reminiscing" and
one for the teens, including all
their fast hit songs from the last
five years. This way everyone
would leave the concert hall
fully pleased, not just partially
happy.
Jaco Pastorius — Word of
Mouth Quintet
The Old Waldorf/San Francis
co
7 January 1982
Some people are born with
silver spoons in their mouths.
However, a select few are for
tunate enough to be born with
a golden bass.
One of these elite is Jaco
Pastorius, the bassist supreme
of the jazz/fusion group
Weather Report. In the past
few years, Pastorius has formed
the Word of Mouth Quintet as
sort of a sidelight from Weath
er Report to further display his
awesome talents.
But like the small, quaint vil
lage that is discovered and con
sequently ruined by tourists
(e.g. Carmel, California),
Pastorius has abused his talent
by training the spot light on
himself in the Word of Mouth
Quintet. He has tasted the big
bucks and wants more. He has
seenthe limelightandcravesto
inflate his head with egotistical
air. Unfortunately, this is the
wrong way to go about becom
ing a legend in his own time, a
status he definitely possesses
the talent to achieve.
Pastorius' first mistake was to

recruit too good musicians to
accompany him in his Search
for the Holy Dollar Bill. But
Pastorius' loss is the audience's
gain. Don Alias (percussion),
Bob Mintzer (saxophones),
Michael Brecker (trumpet),
and Peter Erskine (drums) all
are far above the level of ade
quate. In fact, except for
Mintzer, the Word of Mouth
Quintet might contain the best
jazz musicians at their respec
tive instruments.
The quintet plays avante
garde fusion much closer to
jazz than rock, as Pastorius'
bass is the only electric instru
ment. A good deal of the con
cert material was drawn from
Pastorius' two solo albums. But
since Pastorius often plays the
melody of a song, the music
tends to be difficult to follow
with the absence of a consis
tent bass line.
The Word of Mouth Quintet
began with a few songs from
the two LPs. All the tunes fea
tured bass solos, which often
required extremely quick fin
ger movement, Pastorius'
trademark. He used all parts of
his bass with such accuracy that
it indicated he is always in com
plete control.
During the first song,
Brecker had his first solo in
which he displayed utter

brilliance with quick, but lucid
trumpeteering. And above all,
Brecker performed unpreten
tiously. He knows he is great
and thus is not compelled to try
too hard in improving this to
the audience.
But what is Brecker's
strength is Pastorius' weakness.
Pastorius is a superb bassist and
knows it as well. However, here
is where age and experience,
both on Brecker's side, come
into play. When putting his
abilities on exhibit to the
crowd, Pastorius acted like an
obnoxious kid — like a little
twerp, if you know what I
mean. Instead of simply
playing his bass in the awesome
fashion for which he is known,
Pastorius pretended he was im
pressed with every note he
strummed, like a child wanting
more and more attention.
And making Pastorius look
even younger was his behavior
when another member of the
quintet was soloing, especially
Brecker. While the spotlight
focused on the trumpeteer,
Pastorius would try to distract
the audience's attention to
himself by playing quick riffs.
But little Jaco will grow up —
let's hope.
The best song of the evening
by Pastorius et. al. was "The
Jacket" by James Brown, an up

beat, rhythmy tune with a rela
tively simple baseline. The
song featured a Pastorius bass
solo, with just drummer
Erskine accompanying. At this
time it became clear as day who
was the evening's best per
former.
Erskine kept the rhythm of
Pastorius' solo with superior
precision. He did not miss a
beat during the entire show, as
every lash of his sticks on a
drum or a symbol was right on
time. In a word, he was perfect.-
Two songs later, Erskine re
ceived his long overdue ap
plause after a brilliant solo in
which he played both quietly
and loudly, adding anotheifl
dimension to his already vast
repertoire of drumming abili
ties. The name Erskine should
be mentioned in the same
breath as De Johnette,
Cobham, and Gadd.
The audience's obvious dis
appointment with Pastorius
was evidenced by anemic ap
plause after the last song, re
sulting in the prompt con
clusion of the show without an
encore. If one had closed his
eyes, just listening to Pastorius,
the concert was great. But
open them up and view his on
stage antics, and the show was
mediocre at best.
Circle Star Theater
2 January 1982
The Isley Brothers have a
problem: they have to play for
two different audiences at
once.
The Isleys' concert per
formance has to appeal to both
young and old, filling that ever
so abysmal generation gap. But
in trying to please both parties,
they failed on both counts.
The older members of the
audience came to hear their
older, usually slower and
mellower songs. The teenage
crowd at the Circle Star Theater
wanted the legendary Isley
Bros, to play their faster,
funk/rock tunes. As a com
promise, the Isleys had a little
of both in their 90-minute
show. But it was painfully ob
vious that they played many of
these songs just for the sake of
pleasing certain audience
members. The fast tunes were
sloppy, while the slower ones
dragged on and on and on.
Nevertheless, there was
some gold to mine from the
Isleys' ore. The class and utter
professionalism with which
they deliver a concert is ad
mirable. The word ostentatious
simply does not exist in their
dictionary. Furthermore, their
poor showing was not all their
fault.
Many of the Isleys' problems
developed before they
stepped onto the Circle Star's
famous rotating stage. The the
ater's management got the
wrong "warm-up" band to
open the show, not to take any
thing away from Zoom's fine
performance. Zoom is a pre

dominantly funk/soul group
that appeals more to teenagers
than 40-year-old adults, who
made up the majority of the au
dience.
The Isley Bros, opened with a
speeded up version of "That
Lady," upholding that old
adage: haste makes waste.
They followed it with "Here
We Go Again," an extremely
deliberate tune, and it was time
to grab a pillow and catch some
shuteye.
The show dragged on until
the group's fifth song, "Sum
mer Breeze." The studio ver
sion contains a magnificent
Ernie Isley guitar solo. I im
mediately woke from my
