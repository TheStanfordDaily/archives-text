Solidarity leader recants support
Warsaw, Poland — A leader of Poland's independ
ent trade union federation, Solidarity, yesterday pub
licly recanted a statement supporting the declaration
of martial law and attacking alleged political ex
tremism in the union.
Zdzislaw Rozwalak, the chairman of Solidarity's
branch in the western city of Poznan, told a surprised
group of Western journalists that his earlier statement
had been made under duress. The journalists were
visiting Poznan on the first organized trip outside
Warsaw by the Foreign Ministry press center since the
military crackdown Dec. 13.
Rozwalak's public disavowal will severely embar
rass Poland's military authorities as they have been at
tempting to present a picture of rank-and-file Solidar
ity activists disassociating themselves from the ex
cesses of the leadership. Extensive publicity was given
to Rozwalak's original statement alleging that Solidar
ity had transformed itself into a political movement.
Poland's premier, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and his
ruling military council briefed members of Solidarity
and other unions yesterday on the situation in Poland
and the activity of the armed forces under martial law,
Warsaw television reported.
"The discussion was characterized by a feeling of
patriotic responsibility for the fate of the nation and
the socialist state and keen concern to lead the coun
try out of the economic and political crisis," the
broadcast said. The Associated Press, which
monitored the program in London, said the names of
those attending were not given.
Talking to the journalists yesterday, Rozwalak said
that he had not been aware of what he was doing
when he made the statement. "I regret it. I was not
aware of what I was doing and acted under duress,"
he said.
Business spurns Reagan's plea
Washington — The nation's businesses, starting the
year mired in recession, intend to ignore the Reagan
administration's plea for a 1982 surge in expansion, a
government survey showed yesterday.
A Commerce Department poll of executives con
cluded that they now plan to actually cut back spend
ing for new plants and equipment by 0.5 percent this
year, not counting increases due only to inflation.
Such plans can change quickly, but if "real" capital
spending actually falls this year, it would be the first
such decline since the severe 1974 recession.
Top Reagan officials have said repeatedly that in
centives in the multiyear tax cut enacted in 1981

should spur investment this year and help pull the na
tional economy out of its second recession in two
years.
But executives apparently remained unswayed by
such arguments when they were surveyed in Novem
ber and December.
"I don't think it means the Reagan program isn't
working; it just hasn't picked up steam yet," said
Commerce's chief economist, Robert Ortner.
Considering that the survey was taken as the re
cession was really beginning to bite, "these capital
spending plans aren't that bad actually," he said.
Many businesses have cut production and laid off
workers as the recession has deepened, shelving at
least for the present any plans to expand.
Spending to expand U.S. plants and buy new equip
ment rose only an inflation-adjusted 0.3 percent last
year and 0.8 percent in 1980, the Commerce report in
dicated.
By comparison, such spending rose 7.7 percent in
1979 — the latest non-recessionary year.
GOP chairman may lose job
Washington — The disclosure that Republican Na
tional Chairman Richard Richards has been delin
quent in repaying $300,000 in federally guaranteed
loans stirred new speculation yesterday that he may
be forced out of his job.
White House aides insisted President Ronald Rea
gan felt Richards "should continue as party chair
man."
But Richards' difficulties repaying the loans was
seen by some of his critics as one more reason for re
placing him.
One official who plays a key role in designing the
GOP's 1982 election strategy said "I don't believe you
can have the titular head of the Republican Party lead
ing that party into the campaign of 1982 with the kinds
of clouds that now cover Dick Richards." The official
asked not to be identified.
The story of Richards' failure to keep up payments
on $292,000 in loans guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration was published yesterday in The Wash
ington Post.
A spokesman for Richards confirmed the details of
the story and said the chairman would not comment
on the matter.
The loans were used by Richards and a partner to
purchase the American Health and Sports spa in Roy,
Utah in 1977. His original partner in the venture was a
Utah neighbor, Lew Wangsgard, who later sold his in
terest to Alex Hutardo, who now heads the political

division of the Republican National Committee.
Gov't, clamps down on press
Washington — While the White House sought yes
terday to assure reporters that its new clampdown on
"national security" information was not meant "to
stop the free flow of information," a new directive
turned up at the Agriculture Department requesting
all senior officials there to clear all interviews with
"major media" with the White House in advance.
The directive was signed last Friday by John Ochs,
assistant to Agriculture Secretary John Block, and is
addressed to undersecretaries, assistant secretaries,
top staff and administrators of the department.
"As we enter the new year," the directive says,"it is
important to the president that all of us help him con
vey his message to the public as effectively as possible.
"Specifically," the memo says,"it is requested that
whenever you or anyone under your jurisdiction re
ceives an invitation for an interview on a Sunday talk
show, morning network television, Nightline,
McNeil-Lehrer or other major press appearance (in
cluding print interviews) that you consult with me so
that I may clear it with the White House prior to your
acceptance."
At the White House earlier in the day spokesmen
Larry Speakes and David Gergen said Cabinet mem
bers had been told to clear their appearances on tele
vision interview programs, but that this was not a new
policy and that it was "a coordination process and not
a clearance process."
The Agriculture Department directive, however,
appears to go beyond that, extending to officials well
below Cabinet rank and including "print," or news
paper, interviews as well as television appearances.
The sudden interest in controls on media access to
government officials stems from the announcement
Tuesday evening by the White House of tough new
directives aimed at limiting reporters' access to of
ficials who have "national security" information and
threatening such officials with investigation by "all le
gal methods" if information they have is leaked to the
press.
Dixie storm death toll at 134
A Dixie snowstorm that left almost a million people
without power yesterday laid siege to the big cities of
the Northeast as the death toll in the week's record

cold wave reached 134.
Georgia Gov. George Busbee declared a state of
emergency in Atlanta which was immobilized by half
a foot of snow and ordered out 230 National
Guardsmen to aid stranded motorists and help clear
out thousands of abandoned cars.
The storm that had charged out of Texas swung up
the Eastern Seaboard, closing schools in Washington,
Baltimore, Philadelphia and the suburbs of New York
City.
Up to 10 inches of snow was forecast in some areas
around New York City.
In the West, snowdrifts 40 feet high were hamper
ing efforts to recover the bodies of two men from Bill
ings, Mont., who were spotted Saturday from the air
near the wreckage of their small plane atop 9472-foot
Mount Baldy in western Montana.
Florida farmers in the meantime were toting up
losses from Tuesday's record freeze that caused ex
tensive damage to the state's billion-dollar citrus
crop. They said the price of orange juice was sure to
go up.
The Deep South, hit by a triple barrage of snow,
sleet and freezing rain, was an icy mess from Texas
through the Carolinas, with Arkansas getting up to 7
inches of snow. Most schools in the region were
closed.
Meanwhile, a new storm in the Southwest that pro
duced a foot of snow in parts of New Mexico and Ari
zona was spreading more ice over Texas, Louisiana
and Mississippi.
Wall Street continues decline
Stock prices lifted briefly yesterday before skidding
into decline for the third straight day as the govern
ment reported a paltry increase in retail sales for De
cember and domestic automakers released mixed
news about their industry.
Retail, oil, drug and utility stocks — including
American Telephone and Telegraph Co. — showed
some of the sharpest declines.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 8.75
points to 838.95, its lowest level since Oct. 29 when the
index was 832.95. Since Monday, the Dow has de
clined 27.58 points.
Today's weather
The forecast calls for occasional high clouds and
patchy dense fog nights and mornings. Lows in the 30s
and mid 40s, highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.

turned up at the Agriculture Department requesting
all senior officials there to clear all interviews with
"major media" with the White House in advance.
The directive was signed last Friday by John Ochs,
assistant to Agriculture Secretary John Block, and is
addressed to undersecretaries, assistant secretaries,
top staff and administrators of the department.
"As we enter the new year," the directive says,"it is
important to the president that all of us help him con
vey his message to the public as effectively as possible.
"Specifically," the memo says,"it is requested that
whenever you or anyone under your jurisdiction re
ceives an invitation for an interview on a Sunday talk
show, morning network television, Nightline,
McNeil-Lehrer or other major press appearance (in
cluding print interviews) that you consult with me so
that I may clear it with the White House prior to your
acceptance."
At the White House earlier in the day spokesmen
Larry Speakes and David Gergen said Cabinet mem
bers had been told to clear their appearances on tele
vision interview programs, but that this was not a new
policy and that it was "a coordination process and not
a clearance process."
The Agriculture Department directive, however,
appears to go beyond that, extending to officials well
below Cabinet rank and including "print," or news
paper, interviews as well as television appearances.
The sudden interest in controls on media access to
government officials stems from the announcement
Tuesday evening by the White House of tough new
directives aimed at limiting reporters' access to of
ficials who have "national security" information and
threatening such officials with investigation by "all le
gal methods" if information they have is leaked to the
press.
Dixie storm death toll at 134
A Dixie snowstorm that left almost a million people
without power yesterday laid siege to the big cities of
the Northeast as the death toll in the week's record

cold wave reached 134.
Georgia Gov. George Busbee declared a state of
emergency in Atlanta which was immobilized by half
a foot of snow and ordered out 230 National
Guardsmen to aid stranded motorists and help clear
out thousands of abandoned cars.
The storm that had charged out of Texas swung up
the Eastern Seaboard, closing schools in Washington,
Baltimore, Philadelphia and the suburbs of New York
City.
Up to 10 inches of snow was forecast in some areas
around New York City.
In the West, snowdrifts 40 feet high were hamper
ing efforts to recover the bodies of two men from Bill
ings, Mont., who were spotted Saturday from the air
near the wreckage of their small plane atop 9472-foot
Mount Baldy in western Montana.
Florida farmers in the meantime were toting up
losses from Tuesday's record freeze that caused ex
tensive damage to the state's billion-dollar citrus
crop. They said the price of orange juice was sure to
go up.
The Deep South, hit by a triple barrage of snow,
sleet and freezing rain, was an icy mess from Texas
through the Carolinas, with Arkansas getting up to 7
inches of snow. Most schools in the region were
closed.
Meanwhile, a new storm in the Southwest that pro
duced a foot of snow in parts of New Mexico and Ari
zona was spreading more ice over Texas, Louisiana
and Mississippi.
Wall Street continues decline
Stock prices lifted briefly yesterday before skidding
into decline for the third straight day as the govern
ment reported a paltry increase in retail sales for De
cember and domestic automakers released mixed
news about their industry.
Retail, oil, drug and utility stocks — including
American Telephone and Telegraph Co. — showed
some of the sharpest declines.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 8.75
points to 838.95, its lowest level since Oct. 29 when the
index was 832.95. Since Monday, the Dow has de
clined 27.58 points.
Today's weather
The forecast calls for occasional high clouds and
patchy dense fog nights and mornings. Lows in the 30s
and mid 40s, highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.

Solidarity leader recants support
Warsaw, Poland — A leader of Poland's independ
ent trade union federation, Solidarity, yesterday pub
licly recanted a statement supporting the declaration
of martial law and attacking alleged political ex
tremism in the union.
Zdzislaw Rozwalak, the chairman of Solidarity's
branch in the western city of Poznan, told a surprised
group of Western journalists that his earlier statement
had been made under duress. The journalists were
visiting Poznan on the first organized trip outside
Warsaw by the Foreign Ministry press center since the
military crackdown Dec. 13.
Rozwalak's public disavowal will severely embar
rass Poland's military authorities as they have been at
tempting to present a picture of rank-and-file Solidar
ity activists disassociating themselves from the ex
cesses of the leadership. Extensive publicity was given
to Rozwalak's original statement alleging that Solidar
ity had transformed itself into a political movement.
Poland's premier, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and his
ruling military council briefed members of Solidarity
and other unions yesterday on the situation in Poland
and the activity of the armed forces under martial law,
Warsaw television reported.
"The discussion was characterized by a feeling of
patriotic responsibility for the fate of the nation and
the socialist state and keen concern to lead the coun
try out of the economic and political crisis," the
broadcast said. The Associated Press, which
monitored the program in London, said the names of
those attending were not given.
Talking to the journalists yesterday, Rozwalak said
that he had not been aware of what he was doing
when he made the statement. "I regret it. I was not
aware of what I was doing and acted under duress,"
he said.
Business spurns Reagan's plea
Washington — The nation's businesses, starting the
year mired in recession, intend to ignore the Reagan
administration's plea for a 1982 surge in expansion, a
government survey showed yesterday.
A Commerce Department poll of executives con
cluded that they now plan to actually cut back spend
ing for new plants and equipment by 0.5 percent this
year, not counting increases due only to inflation.
Such plans can change quickly, but if "real" capital
spending actually falls this year, it would be the first
such decline since the severe 1974 recession.
Top Reagan officials have said repeatedly that in
centives in the multiyear tax cut enacted in 1981

should spur investment this year and help pull the na
tional economy out of its second recession in two
years.
But executives apparently remained unswayed by
such arguments when they were surveyed in Novem
ber and December.
"I don't think it means the Reagan program isn't
working; it just hasn't picked up steam yet," said
Commerce's chief economist, Robert Ortner.
Considering that the survey was taken as the re
cession was really beginning to bite, "these capital
spending plans aren't that bad actually," he said.
Many businesses have cut production and laid off
workers as the recession has deepened, shelving at
least for the present any plans to expand.
Spending to expand U.S. plants and buy new equip
ment rose only an inflation-adjusted 0.3 percent last
year and 0.8 percent in 1980, the Commerce report in
dicated.
By comparison, such spending rose 7.7 percent in
1979 — the latest non-recessionary year.
GOP chairman may lose job
Washington — The disclosure that Republican Na
tional Chairman Richard Richards has been delin
quent in repaying $300,000 in federally guaranteed
loans stirred new speculation yesterday that he may
be forced out of his job.
White House aides insisted President Ronald Rea
gan felt Richards "should continue as party chair
man."
But Richards' difficulties repaying the loans was
seen by some of his critics as one more reason for re
placing him.
One official who plays a key role in designing the
GOP's 1982 election strategy said "I don't believe you
can have the titular head of the Republican Party lead
ing that party into the campaign of 1982 with the kinds
of clouds that now cover Dick Richards." The official
asked not to be identified.
The story of Richards' failure to keep up payments
on $292,000 in loans guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration was published yesterday in The Wash
ington Post.
A spokesman for Richards confirmed the details of
the story and said the chairman would not comment
on the matter.
The loans were used by Richards and a partner to
purchase the American Health and Sports spa in Roy,
Utah in 1977. His original partner in the venture was a
Utah neighbor, Lew Wangsgard, who later sold his in
terest to Alex Hutardo, who now heads the political

division of the Republican National Committee.

ity had transformed itself into a political movement.
Poland's premier, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, and his
ruling military council briefed members of Solidarity
and other unions yesterday on the situation in Poland
and the activity of the armed forces under martial law,
Warsaw television reported.
"The discussion was characterized by a feeling of
patriotic responsibility for the fate of the nation and
the socialist state and keen concern to lead the coun
try out of the economic and political crisis," the
broadcast said. The Associated Press, which
monitored the program in London, said the names of
those attending were not given.
Talking to the journalists yesterday, Rozwalak said
that he had not been aware of what he was doing
when he made the statement. "I regret it. I was not
aware of what I was doing and acted under duress,"
he said.
Business spurns Reagan's plea
Washington — The nation's businesses, starting the
year mired in recession, intend to ignore the Reagan
administration's plea for a 1982 surge in expansion, a
government survey showed yesterday.
A Commerce Department poll of executives con
cluded that they now plan to actually cut back spend
ing for new plants and equipment by 0.5 percent this
year, not counting increases due only to inflation.
Such plans can change quickly, but if "real" capital
spending actually falls this year, it would be the first
such decline since the severe 1974 recession.
Top Reagan officials have said repeatedly that in
centives in the multiyear tax cut enacted in 1981

should spur investment this year and help pull the na
tional economy out of its second recession in two
years.
But executives apparently remained unswayed by
such arguments when they were surveyed in Novem
ber and December.
"I don't think it means the Reagan program isn't
working; it just hasn't picked up steam yet," said
Commerce's chief economist, Robert Ortner.
Considering that the survey was taken as the re
cession was really beginning to bite, "these capital
spending plans aren't that bad actually," he said.
Many businesses have cut production and laid off
workers as the recession has deepened, shelving at
least for the present any plans to expand.
Spending to expand U.S. plants and buy new equip
ment rose only an inflation-adjusted 0.3 percent last
year and 0.8 percent in 1980, the Commerce report in
dicated.
By comparison, such spending rose 7.7 percent in
1979 — the latest non-recessionary year.
GOP chairman may lose job
Washington — The disclosure that Republican Na
tional Chairman Richard Richards has been delin
quent in repaying $300,000 in federally guaranteed
loans stirred new speculation yesterday that he may
be forced out of his job.
White House aides insisted President Ronald Rea
gan felt Richards "should continue as party chair
man."
But Richards' difficulties repaying the loans was
seen by some of his critics as one more reason for re
placing him.
One official who plays a key role in designing the
GOP's 1982 election strategy said "I don't believe you
can have the titular head of the Republican Party lead
ing that party into the campaign of 1982 with the kinds
of clouds that now cover Dick Richards." The official
asked not to be identified.
The story of Richards' failure to keep up payments
on $292,000 in loans guaranteed by the Small Business
Administration was published yesterday in The Wash
ington Post.
A spokesman for Richards confirmed the details of
the story and said the chairman would not comment
on the matter.
The loans were used by Richards and a partner to
purchase the American Health and Sports spa in Roy,
Utah in 1977. His original partner in the venture was a
Utah neighbor, Lew Wangsgard, who later sold his in
terest to Alex Hutardo, who now heads the political

division of the Republican National Committee.
Gov't, clamps down on press
Washington — While the White House sought yes
terday to assure reporters that its new clampdown on
"national security" information was not meant "to
stop the free flow of information," a new directive
turned up at the Agriculture Department requesting
all senior officials there to clear all interviews with
"major media" with the White House in advance.
The directive was signed last Friday by John Ochs,
assistant to Agriculture Secretary John Block, and is
addressed to undersecretaries, assistant secretaries,
top staff and administrators of the department.
"As we enter the new year," the directive says,"it is
important to the president that all of us help him con
vey his message to the public as effectively as possible.
"Specifically," the memo says,"it is requested that
whenever you or anyone under your jurisdiction re
ceives an invitation for an interview on a Sunday talk
show, morning network television, Nightline,
McNeil-Lehrer or other major press appearance (in
cluding print interviews) that you consult with me so
that I may clear it with the White House prior to your
acceptance."
At the White House earlier in the day spokesmen
Larry Speakes and David Gergen said Cabinet mem
bers had been told to clear their appearances on tele
vision interview programs, but that this was not a new
policy and that it was "a coordination process and not
a clearance process."
The Agriculture Department directive, however,
appears to go beyond that, extending to officials well
below Cabinet rank and including "print," or news
paper, interviews as well as television appearances.
The sudden interest in controls on media access to
government officials stems from the announcement
Tuesday evening by the White House of tough new
directives aimed at limiting reporters' access to of
ficials who have "national security" information and
threatening such officials with investigation by "all le
gal methods" if information they have is leaked to the
press.
Dixie storm death toll at 134
A Dixie snowstorm that left almost a million people
without power yesterday laid siege to the big cities of
the Northeast as the death toll in the week's record

cold wave reached 134.
Georgia Gov. George Busbee declared a state of
emergency in Atlanta which was immobilized by half
a foot of snow and ordered out 230 National
Guardsmen to aid stranded motorists and help clear
out thousands of abandoned cars.
The storm that had charged out of Texas swung up
the Eastern Seaboard, closing schools in Washington,
Baltimore, Philadelphia and the suburbs of New York
City.
Up to 10 inches of snow was forecast in some areas
around New York City.
In the West, snowdrifts 40 feet high were hamper
ing efforts to recover the bodies of two men from Bill
ings, Mont., who were spotted Saturday from the air
near the wreckage of their small plane atop 9472-foot
Mount Baldy in western Montana.
Florida farmers in the meantime were toting up
losses from Tuesday's record freeze that caused ex
tensive damage to the state's billion-dollar citrus
crop. They said the price of orange juice was sure to
go up.
The Deep South, hit by a triple barrage of snow,
sleet and freezing rain, was an icy mess from Texas
through the Carolinas, with Arkansas getting up to 7
inches of snow. Most schools in the region were
closed.
Meanwhile, a new storm in the Southwest that pro
duced a foot of snow in parts of New Mexico and Ari
zona was spreading more ice over Texas, Louisiana
and Mississippi.
Wall Street continues decline
Stock prices lifted briefly yesterday before skidding
into decline for the third straight day as the govern
ment reported a paltry increase in retail sales for De
cember and domestic automakers released mixed
news about their industry.
Retail, oil, drug and utility stocks — including
American Telephone and Telegraph Co. — showed
some of the sharpest declines.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 8.75
points to 838.95, its lowest level since Oct. 29 when the
index was 832.95. Since Monday, the Dow has de
clined 27.58 points.
Today's weather
The forecast calls for occasional high clouds and
patchy dense fog nights and mornings. Lows in the 30s
and mid 40s, highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.

Solidarity leader recants support
Warsaw, Poland — A leader of Poland's independ
ent trade union federation, Solidarity, yesterday pub
licly recanted a statement supporting the declaration
of martial law and attacking alleged political ex
tremism in the union.
Zdzislaw Rozwalak, the chairman of Solidarity's
branch in the western city of Poznan, told a surprised
group of Western journalists that his earlier statement
had been made under duress. The journalists were
visiting Poznan on the first organized trip outside
Warsaw by the Foreign Ministry press center since the
military crackdown Dec. 13.
Rozwalak's public disavowal will severely embar
rass Poland's military authorities as they have been at
tempting to present a picture of rank-and-file Solidar
ity activists disassociating themselves from the ex
cesses of the leadership. Extensive publicity was given
to Rozwalak's original statement alleging that Solidar
ity had transformed itself into a political movement.
