# Jetliner crashes into Potomac bridge
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” A Florida-bound
jetliner taking off from National Air
port in a snowstorm slammed into a
commuter-packed bridge and
plunged into the ice-choked
Potomac River yesterday. About 65
people were reported killed but per
haps a dozen people aboard the
plane survived, some of them
plucked from the freezing water in
daring helicopter rescues.
It was unclear how many of the
dead were on the twin-engine Air
Florida Boeing 737 and how many
were in cars on the 14th Street
Bridge, an interstate highway link be
tween Washington and suburban
Northern Virginia. The cause of the

crash was not immediately known, al
though some aviation specialists said
that icing of the plane's wings or en
gines may have been involved.
When the plane neared the bridge
"it looked like it was landing" rather
than taking off, one witness said.
Hours after the 4:04 p.m. EST crash,
helicopters with spotlights hovered
in the chill night over the plane's
fuselage, which broke into at least
two pieces before sinking into the
river. Rescue boats smashed their
way through ice jams to reach the
scene while ambulances and fire
trucks crept through a massive traffic
jam to reach the bridge.
Divers attempted to enter the bro
ken fuselage, where witnesses said
they saw bodies still strapped in seats.
Bodies were being brought to the
river's Virginia shore. A temporary
morgue was set up on the bridge.
A spokesman at the mayor's com
mand center said that at least 40 per
sons were killed, and Ted Marr, an
FAA spokesman, gave an unofficial
estimate that 65 were dead. U.S. Park
Police said at least 16 survivors were
taken to hospitals.
In the minutes after the crash, sur
vivors were seen trying to cling to ex
posed portions of the plane's tail and
wings and to ice blocks in the water.
Experts said the water was cold
enough to cause quick death.
At the time of the crash, air tem
peratures were in the 20s and a snow
storm had cut visibility to half a mile
at National Airport, which had closed
down periodically throughout the
day because of the weather.
While the precise cause of the
crash was not immediately clear, a
source with access to personnel in
the National Airport control tower
told the Los Angeles Times that the
pilot never said a word to the tower
once the plane was cleared for

takeoff just after 4 p.m. EST.
"They didn't hear a word from
him," the source said. "They sur
mised he was so busy in the cockpit."
The plane never appeared on the
tower's radar scope, the source said,
and when no one heard from the pi
lot "they knew he was in trouble
right away."
A flight attendant who survived the
crash and was rescued from the river
told a doctor, "The plane started to
shake and the next thing I knew I was
in the water."
None of the witnesses interviewed
soon after the crash reported seeing
flames, smoke or explosion. Ira
Furman, a spokesman for the Na
tional Transportation Safety Board,
said, "We have a big goose-egg in
terms of what we know .. . We can
not begin to factor in what effect the
weather had . . ."
David Keshavarz, a 21-year-old stu
dent from Arlington, Va., said he was
driving across the bridge toward
Washington when he saw the plane
in the air "very close ... I thought it
was going up but I realized it was
coming down fast.
"The wheels were not all the way
up, and the wheels hit as many as
three or four cars in front of me and
pushed them right over the edge,"
Keshavarz said. "The plane went
down into the water. It looked like
the left wing was broken off. The
plane was 1 Vi or 2 minutes in the wa
ter right side up, then it just sank."
The crash occurred just as tens of
thousands of government employ
ees, released from their jobs early be
cause of the snow storm, were jam
ming the capital's highways and
bridges. Sharon Holroyd, a man
power specialist who works at the
Pentagon, within sight of the bridge,
said "I heard a big noise as I came out
of the door. I thought it was an Army

cannon."
The airport is barely two miles from
the White House and within view of
the Capitol dome. Because of its loca
tion, noise abatement regulations re
quire planes landing or taking off to
generally follow a twisting course
directly over the river, rather than a
more direct route over populated
areas. Pilots have complained about
those requirements, although the
last major commercial airliner crash
linked to the airport was in 1949,
when 51 people were killed in the
collision of an Eastern Airlines DC-4
and a military plane.
Yesterday's crash was the first ma
jor commercial airline accident since
11,500 air traffic controllers went on
strike last August and were fired by
President Ronald Reagan. FAA
spokesman Ted Maher said that
"from preliminary information, it
(the Air Florida crash) has absolutely
nothing to do with air traffic con
trollers."
Reagan, in a statement issued by
the White House two hours after the
crash, made no reference to the con
trollers but said he had ordered "the
full resources of the federal govern
ment ... be utilized to rescue the vic
tims."
Navy Ensign Lloyd Shelton said his
car was stuck in the traffic on the
bridge when "there was this big roar
and all of a sudden everything shat
tered .... I looked around and these
cars were shattered ... and I said 'Oh
God.' "
Another witness, Air Force Sgt.
Jerome Lancaster, said he saw the
plane's wheels hit a truck, turning the
vehicle over. "It looked like he lost
his direction," Lancaster said of the
craft.
The driver of the truck, Marion
Grant, said he heard "a swishing
noise, then a large crash."
