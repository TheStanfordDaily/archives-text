# Village Council argues pending 17% rent hikes
## 
### Sally Newman 
Irate members of the Escondido
Village Council last night suggested
that the University is being "hypocrit
ical" in calling for a 17 percent rent
increase, the proceeds from which
will not directly benefit any graduate
students.
If approved by the Board of
Trustees next month, the rate hike
will help offset rising costs for the
whole housing system and help
amortize the cost of the new
dormitory, Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson, Housing
Director Edward Scoles and Housing
Project Director Robin Hamill told
about 40 Village representatives at
their monthly meeting.
However, residents charged that
this policy was "downright unfair" to
Village residents who would not
directly benefit from the new facility.
One posible way of easing the
graduate housing crunch — solic
iting gift money for housing con
struction — was quickly rejected by
Robinson.
"Gift money is extremely hard to
come by at this time," he said. Hamill
added that "people don't die happy
knowing they've given money to
build a dorm the way they would if
they gave money for something like
cardiovascular research."
At the same time, though, some of
the revenues from Escondido rents,
which could go toward constructing
new graduate housing, goes into the
University's general fund — and are
used for purposes for which gift
money is plentiful, hence the term
"hypocritical," used by one Council
member.
Scoles also admitted that some of
the profit from dorms which, like
Escondido, operate in the black,
would be earmarked to offset other
losses within the housing system.
The housing systems, under
graduate and graduate, were merged
several years ago to "break an
artificial boundary," said Scoles, as
well as to have more available funds
to build new housing. But instead
graduates find themselves paying for
undergraduate housing, residents
complained.
According to Robinson, "the very
earliest one can expect new graduate
housing is the beginning of 1985."
