# High court gives police new power
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” The United States Supreme Court held
6-3 yesterday that following an arrest, police may
monitor the actions of an individual and follow him into
his private home or apartment, using evidence they see
there against other persons as well.
In a decision by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the high
court said the risks of danger involved whenever a police
officer makes an arrest justify the officer's entry into
areas that might otherwise be considered private.
"The officer's need to ensure his own safety, as well as
the integrity of the arrest, is compelling," the chief jus
tice said.
The ruling gives police somewhat more authority to
enter private homes or apartments without a warrant.
However, because of the unusual nature and circum
stances of the case in which the court ruled, the impact
of the ruling may be limited.
The case arose when campus police at Washington
State University stopped a student named Carl Overdahl
outside his dormitory. Overdahl was carrying a half
gallon bottle of gin. A police officer thought Overdahl
appeared to be under 21, the legal drinking age in Wash
ington, and asked him for proof of age.
Overdahl said his identification cards were in his dorm
room. The police officer allowed him to get the cards,
but accompanied him to the 11 th-floor dorm room.
From outside Overdahl's room, the policeman no
ticed seeds and a small pipe lying on a desk inside. One
of Overdahl's roommates, Neil Chrisman, was inside the
room and the policeman throught heappeared nervous.
Growing suspicious of possible drug use, the police
man entered the room and found that the seeds were
marijuana seeds. A subsequent search of the room
turned up plastic bags with marijuana and some LSD

pills.
Chrisman was eventually found guilty of possessing
marijuana and LSD, but the Washington Supreme Court
reversed the conviction. The state court said the campus
police officer who arrested Overdahl had no right to
enter the dorm room without a warrant.
The high court disagreed and reinstated Chrisman's
conviction. It decided that once Overdahl was stopped
and asked for identification, he was legally under arrest.
Because he was under arrest, the court reasoned, police
had the right to accompany him into his room. And once
in the room, the officer had a right to seize any con
traband that was in plain view.
Joining in Burger's decision were Justices William
Rehnquist, Sandra Day O'Connor, Lewis Powell, John
Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun. The dissenters were
Justices Byron White, William Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
In his dissent, White said the court should not have
adopted a flat rule that an officer may always stay "at the
arrestee's elbow." He said the lower courts should have
been ordered to examine whether the officer had some
special reason for staying so close to Overdahl and enter
ing the dorm room. " The Court should move with some
care where the home or living quarters are involved,"
White said.
Also yesterday the high court dismissed an appeal by
Princeton University from a New Jersey court ruling that
the university said violated its rights.
Princeton had claimed that a state court decision that
required it to permit persons to distribute political
leaflets on its campus violated what the university called
its First Amendment right to academic freedom. The jus
tices did not rule on the issue. Instead, they dismissed the
case on grounds that Princeton had no legal standing to
appeal.
