# Donnie' recovering after survival ordeal
## 
### Katherine Brown 
He survived five days of sub
zero temperatures by huddling in
sleeping bags in the wreckage of
the small plane in which he had
been traveling.
Now, after the gruelling ordeal
which led to his admission to the
Stanford Medical Centerand
amputation of his frostbitten feet
yesterday morning, Id-year-old
Donnie Priest isawake, alert and
comfortable, according to his
doctors.
The story began Jan. 3 when the
light plane which was carrying
Donnie and his mother and
stepfather, Lee and Ronald
Vaughn, both of Orinda, crashed
near the 11,000-foot-high Tioga
Pass in Yosemite. Both his mother
and stepfather were killed, but
Donnie managed tostayaliveby
covering himself with sleeping
bags.
Donnie was flown by helicopter
from the crash site to the Valley
Medical Center in Fresno. He was
immediately immersed in a tub of
hot water heated to 100 degrees.
Blood began tocirculatein his
hands, but not his feet.
Using a procedure known as an
isotope scan — very low doses of
radioactive material are injected
into the leg to determine if and
where blood isflowing in the
frostbitten area — the doctors in
Fresno determined that the blood
was not flowing into his feet. They
speculated that his feet had frozen
and thawed several times while he
awaited rescue.
Surgeon John Mehigan, who
operated on the boy, said that
despite good care at the Valley
Medical Center, "Donnie arrived
here pretty sick. Sometime
yesterday (Tuesday), a fever had
occurred and it looked like
infection had set in. His
temperature reached 39 degrees
centigrade, and this indicated that

surgery should be performed
quickly." Mehigan performed a
20-minute operation yesterday,
the first of two which allowed for
the draining of the gangrenous
infection.
"The doctors are very optimistic
that the closure will be belowthe
knees,"said Mike Goodkind, a
Med Center spokesman.
<Jlh.'ar\unately the extensive
media coverage which has
followed Donnie's admission to
the Med CenteronTuesday"is
much more than he wants or
needs at this point. He realizes
that friends and relatives are
wondering how he's doing, but he
doesn't like being famous," his
father, Donald Priest Sr., told a
group of reporters gathered at the
Med Center yesterday.
Theelder Priest told reporters
that his son had been well
prepared for the surgery and had
asked about family and friends.
"He has also been greatly
interested in what the doctors had
to say about the amputation," said
Priest.
"He's a pretty great kid,"
Mehigan commented. "I told him
he would be the bionic kid and he
just laughed and agreed."
Mehigan saidthe boy would
probably be fitted with an artificial
leg in about four to six weeks.
Physical therapist Sandy Kasura
told reportersthat Donnie's
recovery program would include
extensive exercise and eventually,
the implementation of prosthetic
devices that, it is hoped, will
enable him to walk again.
After his release, Donnie will go
to his natural father's home in
Portola Valley. He has one brother
there who is"looking forward to
getting Donnie home," said
Priest. "The family is prepared to
move ahead. We're facing these
problems with a positive
outlook."
