## Pakistan denies human rights findings 
### Los Angeles Times 
Islamabad, Pakistan â€” President Zia
ul-Haq's martial-law regime Tuesday re
jected allegations by Amnesty Interna
tional that it used mass arrests and sys
tematic torture to terrorize political op
ponents into submission.
The charge were contained in a 50-
page report compiled by the London
based human rights organization and
officially released yesterday.
The document alleged that between
several hundred to several thousand
political prisoners have been detained
at any one time during Zia's four years
of military rule.
Systematic ill-treatment and torture
of political prisoners had increased
since early last year and between Janu
ary, 1980 and August, 1981, three pris
oners died of torture, the report said.
It also alleged that respect for basic
human rights in Pakistan had deterio
rated sharply during the last year. It
cited increased flogging, torture, secret
trials and general erosion of the coun
try's one independent judiciary as evi
dence of the decline.
The Amnesty International report
was based mainly on interviews with
former political prisoners, their rela
tives and news reports in the domestic

and international press.
An official Pakistan government
spokesman denied the allegations of
torture and said there had been no
erosion of human rights during the last
year. He said the report is "totally incor
rect and riddled with lies." He
challenged its findings, saying, "In fact,
the movement has been in the other
direction."
Pakistan's interior ministry spokes
man said 62 political prisoners are pres
ently under detention.
The most prominent of these pris
oners is Benazir Bhutto, daughter of
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan's last
elected leader. Zia deposed Bhutto in
1967 in a bloodless coup and two years
later ordered Bhutto's execution after
he was convicted of murder conspiracy.
Berazir Bhutto, de facto head of her
father's political party, has spent more
than two years under arrest since Zia
came to power. She was last arrested in
March, 1981.
Bhutto's widow, Nusrat, was released
last July after 28 months of imprison
ment.
Another political leader, retired Air
Marshal Asghar Khan, whose centrist
Tehrik-istiqlal party is considered a
potential influential force, has spent

nearly two years in preventive deten
tion.
There have been no reports of tor
ture relating to these figures, although
Bhutto and Khan are reproted de
teriorating health.
In its report, Amnesty International
said that a series of martial law regu
lations issued under Zia rule has seri
ously eroded Pakistan's once-inde
pendent judiciary and paved the way
for further violation of human rights, in
timidation and terror.
It named three political prisoners
who allegedly died after being tor
tured. One of the alleged victims 25-
year-old Nazir Abbasi was described as
a student leader.
Sources outside Pakistan's martial
law regime, including some of its strong
opponents, believe the arrest and tor
ture of political prisoners does take
place, but believe the amnesty report
may be exaggerated.
While describing the regime's figure
of 62 political prisoners as too low, they
also rejected the estimate of several
thousand suggested by the report.
Despite this routine cycle of arrests,
Zia is viewed generally as less severe
than previous military regimes.
