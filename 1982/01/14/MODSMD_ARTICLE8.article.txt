# French have lower-grade fuel in plans for new Iraqi reactor
## 
### Washington Post 
Paris — The French government has given the
clearest public indication so far that it will insist
on a special low-grade fuel for any nuclear reac
tor it builds in Iraq to replace the one destroyed
by Israel last June.
Use of the fuel, called "caramel," would mean
that uranium for the Iraqi reactor could be kept
to an enrichment level as low as seven percent,
well below widely recognized requirements for
production of nuclear weapons yet sufficient to
allow the reactor to serve as the research and
training center Iraq and France say it is designed
to be.
Israel cited fears that Iraq intended to make
nuclear bombs as the reason for its June 7 raid on
the French-built reactor at Tamuz, near Bagh
dad. Prime Minister Menachem Begin has men
tioned the same fears in his warnings that any at
tempt to rebuild the reactor will bring on anoth
er Israeli bombing raid.
It is unclear whether Iraq will accept French
conditions. According to reports in the French
press, Iraqi officials have warned they will shop
elsewhere, possibly in Italy, if they are unable to
get the kind of reactor they want from Paris.
French officials said talks on rebuildingTamuz
have not come to a conclusion and Iraq has not
been forced to make a clear-cut decision on
what type of controls it would accept.
Cavern site
Meanwhile, French and Iraqi scientists are
considering the possibility of a bomb-resistant
cavern as the site for any new reactor, a knowl
edgeable source reported. The site, which has
not yet been chosen, could be a natural cave or it
could be carved into the side of a mountain
deeply enough to offer protection against any
new attack by Israeli planes, he said.
President Francois Mitterrand's government
last fall announced a willingness in principle to
rebuild the reactor despite Begin's warnings. At
the same time, Mitterrand's ministers have been
careful to add assurances that they will require
increased safeguards against the possibility of us
ing the reactor to build nuclear weaponry. Be
cause of secrecy surrounding negotiations un
derway with President Saddam Hussein's gov
ernment in Baghdad, however, the assurances
have remained expressions of principle.
But in a written answer to a question onTamuz
in the French Senate last Friday, Foreign Minister
Claude Cheysson made what French sources de
scribed Tuesday as a clear allusion to insistence
on use of the caramel fuel.
"The French government intends to develop
cooperation in the area of peaceful nuclear
energy use with different countries," he said. "It
is obvious," the note continued, "that Franco-

Iraqi cooperation will take into account the pos
sibilities offered by the most recent engineering,
including in the area of fuel, so as to assure that
the use of this reactor is exclusively peaceful."
The council, which groups Mitterrand's key
ministers along with government nuclear ex
perts, held a secret meeting just before Christ
mas in what the sources said was an effort to de
fine the socialist government's policy on nuclear
exports, including the Tamuz issue.

The fuel can function only to a
10 percent enrichment level
... a2O percent enrichment
level is necessary for weapons
production.

Although nothing has filtered out about what
the council decided, Cheysson's declaration —
the first such statement since the meeting —
seemed to indicate that strong controls and the
low-grade fuel will be part of any new deal with
Iraq, a said a source in the nuclear field.
French presence
French sources said another condition being
discussed is an extension of the period during
which French technicians would be present at
any new reactor.
The low-grade carmel fuel takes the form of
small brown squares resembling caramel candy.
A French development, it has been hailed as giv
ing non-nuclear countries the possibility of nu
clear research without raising fears of expanding
the nuclear-weaoons club.
The fuel can function only to a 10 percent en
richment level. French nuclear scientists say a 20
percent enrichment level is necessary for weap
ons production, thus ruling out possible diver
sion of highly-enriched uranium fuel from re
search reactors to bomb producton, they say.
The uranium level at Tamuz was enriched to
about 80 percent, although officials at the
French Atomic Energy Commission insist it was
not being diverted for weapons production and
French technicians would have been present for
a number of years to monitor its use by Iraq.
The Tamuz facility, called Osirak, did not use
caramel fuel because the system had not been
developed when France and Iraq contracted for
the reactor in 1975. After development of
caramel, French officials proposed switching to
it but Iraq refused.
