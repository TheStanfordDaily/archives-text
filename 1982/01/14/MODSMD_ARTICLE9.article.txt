## Engineer fired after testifying that nuclear plant safety was Inadequate 
### (Second of two parts) by Michael Abramson 
In a recent interview, Stanford SWOPSI instructor Pe
ter Faulkner described his personal role in the nuclear
power plant safety controversy.
Question: You've had some experiences in develop
ing quality assurance (QA)programs for nuclear power
plants. How did this affect your view of nuclear prob
lems?
Answer: Until 1974 I designed QA programs for sever
al nuclear plants across the United States. The essence of
QA is the process of making sure that critical jobs get
done properly by the right people by assigning responsi
bility and defining procedures exactly. In the process of
setting up these programs I had a chance to get to know a
great many engineers and executivesand began forming
opinions, privately, not so much of the plants but of the
people who had the responsibility for operating these
plants. I found the quality of people in the electric power
industry distressingly uneven. I compared people quality
here to people quality in NASA and the military and de
cided that electric power company engineers and man
agers just didn't take engineering quality seriously
enough.
Q: On March 12, 1974, Anthony Roisman, a Washing
ton, D.C. attorney, presented your paper to a Senate sub
committee. What was the essence of that paper?
A: I told them that nuclear plants were producing
electricity 20 percent less than had been promised
earlier in utility Environmental Impact Statements. Plants
were producing less electricity because they were down
for repairs more than anticipated. This, because they had
not been built properly in the first place and because the
technology was turning out to have many more prob
lems than anyone dreamed of originally. If these prob
lems emanated from careless construction, then that was
a clear indication that quality assurance during the con
struction phase and earlier was inadequate. Most impor
tant of all, there was — and still is — no third-party in
spection of nuclear plants. I concluded that we should
question the inherent safety of these plants and restruc
ture the QA program for nuclear power.
Q: What was your objective in presenting this paper?
A: To slow down the industry, give people time to ad
dress some of the very grave problems I saw on the
horizon. I knew that the industry would be slowed if

people woke up to the truth — the plants had been sold
before they were properly designed. I think I was suc
cessful. It took Three Mile Island to convince people, but
the truth is out. All of my allegations were confirmed by
that accident.
Q: What were the subcommittees' findings?
A: That was in 1974 and they didn't do anything. They
didn't even respond to my paper. They just printed it and
let it stand. It challenged so many of the prevailing as
sumptions about nuclear power that it may have been an
overdose.
Q: There have been no recent reactions?
A: That's because so many Washington politicians
know they can't win if they take a stand on nuclear
power. If they come out against it, as Sens. Gary Hart and
Mike Gravel did, they're going to lose the support of the
large corporations. You have to realize there are hun
dreds of billions of dollars committed to nuclear tech
nology. Anyone who speaks out against it is likely to get
zapped. In this culture, one either plays the game ac
cording to the rules, supports American technology and
jobs, or gets out. There is too much money at stake.
Q: After you published the Senate paper, what hap
pened in the energy industry hierarchy?
A: The industry was so upset about it that they im
mediately circulated copies. Several electric power com
pany presidents called my president and started putting
pressure on him. He tried to get me to retract the paper
and, when I refused to back off from the Senate paper,
he fired me.
Q: Subsequently you turned over to Ralph Nader sev
eral confidential industry documents on reactor defi
ciencies. What did Nader do with these papers?
A: I'm not sure if Nader was the one but they all ended
up on Wall Street at investment banking firms. You've
got to understand that I was pretty paranoid at the time. I
had the evidence, but I couldn't get anyone to listen. I
could see an accident coming, but all anyone could think
of was protecting their investments. It was just un
believable. Anyway, when Wall Street got the docu
ments, they started to realize that General Electric had
marketed their reactor systems before they were proper
ly designed. Question: Do we, Wall Street, want to go on
loaning billions of dollars to electric power companies

who need capital to buy nuclear plants when these
plants may not turn out to be profitable after all? An
swer: No. And at that point the capital markets for nucle
ar power started drying up very quickly, both for design
reasons and because the cost overruns from nuclear
plants under construction started getting out of hand.
Q: Did you pursue any legal avenues to retain your
job?
A: Once I was fired, there wasn't much I could do
about it. I notified the FBI that I had been fired after pres
enting the paper and alleged that federal laws protecting
congressional witnesses had been violated. Certainly my
civil liberties had been abridged. But the Department of
Justice called off the FBI investigation after ruling that I
wasn't protected because I hadn't appeared before the
committee in person. I really hit the ceiling on that one.
My main objection is that my firing had, and will have, a
depressing effect on other people who might come for
ward with objections. And my premise is that every
citizen ought to be able to appear, without fear of repris
al, before government representatives, especially when
matters of public safety are at issue.
Q: Your second book, The Silent Bomb, documents
information about unsafe practices in the nuclear in
dustry. It also details bribery information that seems
quite alarming.
A: Yes, several members of the joint Committee on
Atomic Energy were bribed by Gulf Oil. We have the
documents, following an investigation and suit by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The suit was filed
in federal court of the District of Columbia in 1974. No
one has taken action on the documents and the reasons
are somewhat elusive. Most of these documents came
out during Watergate. It turns out that not just Gulf Oil,
but most of the major oil companies channelled some
thing like $14 to $100 million in illegal political contribu
tions to important people on Capitol Hill.
Q: What implications does this have for nuclear
power?
A: The oil companies own a substantial amount of the
uranium in the world and they had a very strong interest
in recovering that investment, in getting the uranium out
of the ground and converted into cash. Now the federal

government was the only possible purchaser of the ura
nium. The documents show that oil companies paid off
members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and
subsequently garnered enormous sums from the sale of
uranium.
Q: Why weren't these contributions publicized?
A: They were once, but the story was never followed
up nor were the constitutional implications analyzed.
Remember that all this took place right after Nixon had
resigned and the executive branch of the government
had come under a cloud. There is some reason to believe
that the prevailing system of power in this society de
cided that the public's faith in the federal government
had been bruised enough and that, if this evidence of
congressional bribery were to come out, two-thirds of
the government would be under criticism. We're talking
about the public's faith in democratic process.
Q: You're writing a new book. Is it likely to be as con
troversial as the lasti'
A: The book deals withthe rightsof future generations
— posterity rights — and resource policy. There has been
some important work done on the idea of public trusts
and the need for setting aside substantial amounts of re
source for the next thousand or so generations. These
proposals are not likely to please energy companies who
would like to liquidate their resource holdings in the
next 50 years or so. But if industrial society — or whatever
society that follows out — is to have any future, it may be
necessary to adopt a stewardship role to what resources
remain, regardless of the short run economic costs of
conserving. I'm interested in examining the almost ex
clusive role that economics plays in public policy de
cisions and how and whether there may be conflicts re
garding rights of people present and future. The prob
lem, as in the nuclear case, is that our society has de
veloped its industrial base so rapidly that we haven't had
time to examine the long run effects. There are problems
with high-consumption ethics that go beyond pollution,
beyond reaching into the future to grab our childrens'
and our childrens' childens' share of oil, coal and non
renewables. But the greatest problem is that people are
unable to come to terms with these problems without
setting their material concerns aside.

of the ground and converted into cash. Now the federal

government was the only possible purchaser of the ura
nium. The documents show that oil companies paid off
members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and
subsequently garnered enormous sums from the sale of
uranium.
Q: Why weren't these contributions publicized?
A: They were once, but the story was never followed
up nor were the constitutional implications analyzed.
Remember that all this took place right after Nixon had
resigned and the executive branch of the government
had come under a cloud. There is some reason to believe
that the prevailing system of power in this society de
cided that the public's faith in the federal government
had been bruised enough and that, if this evidence of
congressional bribery were to come out, two-thirds of
the government would be under criticism. We're talking
about the public's faith in democratic process.
Q: You're writing a new book. Is it likely to be as con
troversial as the lasti'
A: The book deals withthe rightsof future generations
— posterity rights — and resource policy. There has been
some important work done on the idea of public trusts
and the need for setting aside substantial amounts of re
source for the next thousand or so generations. These
proposals are not likely to please energy companies who
would like to liquidate their resource holdings in the
next 50 years or so. But if industrial society — or whatever
society that follows out — is to have any future, it may be
necessary to adopt a stewardship role to what resources
remain, regardless of the short run economic costs of
conserving. I'm interested in examining the almost ex
clusive role that economics plays in public policy de
cisions and how and whether there may be conflicts re
garding rights of people present and future. The prob
lem, as in the nuclear case, is that our society has de
veloped its industrial base so rapidly that we haven't had
time to examine the long run effects. There are problems
with high-consumption ethics that go beyond pollution,
beyond reaching into the future to grab our childrens'
and our childrens' childens' share of oil, coal and non
renewables. But the greatest problem is that people are
unable to come to terms with these problems without
setting their material concerns aside.
In a recent interview, Stanford SWOPSI instructor Pe
ter Faulkner described his personal role in the nuclear
power plant safety controversy.
Question: You've had some experiences in develop
ing quality assurance (QA)programs for nuclear power
plants. How did this affect your view of nuclear prob
lems?
Answer: Until 1974 I designed QA programs for sever
al nuclear plants across the United States. The essence of
QA is the process of making sure that critical jobs get
done properly by the right people by assigning responsi
bility and defining procedures exactly. In the process of
setting up these programs I had a chance to get to know a
great many engineers and executivesand began forming
opinions, privately, not so much of the plants but of the
people who had the responsibility for operating these
plants. I found the quality of people in the electric power
industry distressingly uneven. I compared people quality
here to people quality in NASA and the military and de
cided that electric power company engineers and man
agers just didn't take engineering quality seriously
enough.
Q: On March 12, 1974, Anthony Roisman, a Washing
ton, D.C. attorney, presented your paper to a Senate sub
committee. What was the essence of that paper?
A: I told them that nuclear plants were producing
electricity 20 percent less than had been promised
earlier in utility Environmental Impact Statements. Plants
were producing less electricity because they were down
for repairs more than anticipated. This, because they had
not been built properly in the first place and because the
technology was turning out to have many more prob
lems than anyone dreamed of originally. If these prob
lems emanated from careless construction, then that was
a clear indication that quality assurance during the con
struction phase and earlier was inadequate. Most impor
tant of all, there was — and still is — no third-party in
spection of nuclear plants. I concluded that we should
question the inherent safety of these plants and restruc
ture the QA program for nuclear power.
Q: What was your objective in presenting this paper?
A: To slow down the industry, give people time to ad
dress some of the very grave problems I saw on the
horizon. I knew that the industry would be slowed if

people woke up to the truth — the plants had been sold
before they were properly designed. I think I was suc
cessful. It took Three Mile Island to convince people, but
the truth is out. All of my allegations were confirmed by
that accident.
Q: What were the subcommittees' findings?
A: That was in 1974 and they didn't do anything. They
didn't even respond to my paper. They just printed it and
let it stand. It challenged so many of the prevailing as
sumptions about nuclear power that it may have been an
overdose.
Q: There have been no recent reactions?
A: That's because so many Washington politicians
know they can't win if they take a stand on nuclear
power. If they come out against it, as Sens. Gary Hart and
Mike Gravel did, they're going to lose the support of the
large corporations. You have to realize there are hun
dreds of billions of dollars committed to nuclear tech
nology. Anyone who speaks out against it is likely to get
zapped. In this culture, one either plays the game ac
cording to the rules, supports American technology and
jobs, or gets out. There is too much money at stake.
Q: After you published the Senate paper, what hap
pened in the energy industry hierarchy?
A: The industry was so upset about it that they im
mediately circulated copies. Several electric power com
pany presidents called my president and started putting
pressure on him. He tried to get me to retract the paper
and, when I refused to back off from the Senate paper,
he fired me.
Q: Subsequently you turned over to Ralph Nader sev
eral confidential industry documents on reactor defi
ciencies. What did Nader do with these papers?
A: I'm not sure if Nader was the one but they all ended
up on Wall Street at investment banking firms. You've
got to understand that I was pretty paranoid at the time. I
had the evidence, but I couldn't get anyone to listen. I
could see an accident coming, but all anyone could think
of was protecting their investments. It was just un
believable. Anyway, when Wall Street got the docu
ments, they started to realize that General Electric had
marketed their reactor systems before they were proper
ly designed. Question: Do we, Wall Street, want to go on
loaning billions of dollars to electric power companies

who need capital to buy nuclear plants when these
plants may not turn out to be profitable after all? An
swer: No. And at that point the capital markets for nucle
ar power started drying up very quickly, both for design
reasons and because the cost overruns from nuclear
plants under construction started getting out of hand.
Q: Did you pursue any legal avenues to retain your
job?
A: Once I was fired, there wasn't much I could do
about it. I notified the FBI that I had been fired after pres
enting the paper and alleged that federal laws protecting
congressional witnesses had been violated. Certainly my
civil liberties had been abridged. But the Department of
Justice called off the FBI investigation after ruling that I
wasn't protected because I hadn't appeared before the
committee in person. I really hit the ceiling on that one.
My main objection is that my firing had, and will have, a
depressing effect on other people who might come for
ward with objections. And my premise is that every
citizen ought to be able to appear, without fear of repris
al, before government representatives, especially when
matters of public safety are at issue.
Q: Your second book, The Silent Bomb, documents
information about unsafe practices in the nuclear in
dustry. It also details bribery information that seems
quite alarming.
A: Yes, several members of the joint Committee on
Atomic Energy were bribed by Gulf Oil. We have the
documents, following an investigation and suit by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The suit was filed
in federal court of the District of Columbia in 1974. No
one has taken action on the documents and the reasons
are somewhat elusive. Most of these documents came
out during Watergate. It turns out that not just Gulf Oil,
but most of the major oil companies channelled some
thing like $14 to $100 million in illegal political contribu
tions to important people on Capitol Hill.
Q: What implications does this have for nuclear
power?
A: The oil companies own a substantial amount of the
uranium in the world and they had a very strong interest
in recovering that investment, in getting the uranium out
of the ground and converted into cash. Now the federal

government was the only possible purchaser of the ura
nium. The documents show that oil companies paid off
members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and
subsequently garnered enormous sums from the sale of
uranium.
Q: Why weren't these contributions publicized?
A: They were once, but the story was never followed
up nor were the constitutional implications analyzed.

ly designed. Question: Do we, Wall Street, want to go on
loaning billions of dollars to electric power companies

who need capital to buy nuclear plants when these
plants may not turn out to be profitable after all? An
swer: No. And at that point the capital markets for nucle
ar power started drying up very quickly, both for design
reasons and because the cost overruns from nuclear
plants under construction started getting out of hand.
Q: Did you pursue any legal avenues to retain your
job?
A: Once I was fired, there wasn't much I could do
about it. I notified the FBI that I had been fired after pres
enting the paper and alleged that federal laws protecting
congressional witnesses had been violated. Certainly my
civil liberties had been abridged. But the Department of
Justice called off the FBI investigation after ruling that I
wasn't protected because I hadn't appeared before the
committee in person. I really hit the ceiling on that one.
My main objection is that my firing had, and will have, a
depressing effect on other people who might come for
ward with objections. And my premise is that every
citizen ought to be able to appear, without fear of repris
al, before government representatives, especially when
matters of public safety are at issue.
Q: Your second book, The Silent Bomb, documents
information about unsafe practices in the nuclear in
dustry. It also details bribery information that seems
quite alarming.
A: Yes, several members of the joint Committee on
Atomic Energy were bribed by Gulf Oil. We have the
documents, following an investigation and suit by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The suit was filed
in federal court of the District of Columbia in 1974. No
one has taken action on the documents and the reasons
are somewhat elusive. Most of these documents came
out during Watergate. It turns out that not just Gulf Oil,
but most of the major oil companies channelled some
thing like $14 to $100 million in illegal political contribu
tions to important people on Capitol Hill.
Q: What implications does this have for nuclear
power?
A: The oil companies own a substantial amount of the
uranium in the world and they had a very strong interest
in recovering that investment, in getting the uranium out
of the ground and converted into cash. Now the federal

government was the only possible purchaser of the ura
nium. The documents show that oil companies paid off
members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and
subsequently garnered enormous sums from the sale of
uranium.
Q: Why weren't these contributions publicized?
A: They were once, but the story was never followed
up nor were the constitutional implications analyzed.
Remember that all this took place right after Nixon had
resigned and the executive branch of the government
had come under a cloud. There is some reason to believe
that the prevailing system of power in this society de
cided that the public's faith in the federal government
had been bruised enough and that, if this evidence of
congressional bribery were to come out, two-thirds of
the government would be under criticism. We're talking
about the public's faith in democratic process.
Q: You're writing a new book. Is it likely to be as con
troversial as the lasti'
A: The book deals withthe rightsof future generations
— posterity rights — and resource policy. There has been
some important work done on the idea of public trusts
and the need for setting aside substantial amounts of re
source for the next thousand or so generations. These
proposals are not likely to please energy companies who
would like to liquidate their resource holdings in the
next 50 years or so. But if industrial society — or whatever
society that follows out — is to have any future, it may be
necessary to adopt a stewardship role to what resources
remain, regardless of the short run economic costs of
conserving. I'm interested in examining the almost ex
clusive role that economics plays in public policy de
cisions and how and whether there may be conflicts re
garding rights of people present and future. The prob
lem, as in the nuclear case, is that our society has de
veloped its industrial base so rapidly that we haven't had
time to examine the long run effects. There are problems
with high-consumption ethics that go beyond pollution,
beyond reaching into the future to grab our childrens'
and our childrens' childens' share of oil, coal and non
renewables. But the greatest problem is that people are
unable to come to terms with these problems without
setting their material concerns aside.
In a recent interview, Stanford SWOPSI instructor Pe
ter Faulkner described his personal role in the nuclear
power plant safety controversy.
Question: You've had some experiences in develop
ing quality assurance (QA)programs for nuclear power
plants. How did this affect your view of nuclear prob
lems?
Answer: Until 1974 I designed QA programs for sever
al nuclear plants across the United States. The essence of
QA is the process of making sure that critical jobs get
done properly by the right people by assigning responsi
bility and defining procedures exactly. In the process of
setting up these programs I had a chance to get to know a
great many engineers and executivesand began forming
opinions, privately, not so much of the plants but of the
people who had the responsibility for operating these
plants. I found the quality of people in the electric power
industry distressingly uneven. I compared people quality
here to people quality in NASA and the military and de
cided that electric power company engineers and man
agers just didn't take engineering quality seriously
enough.
Q: On March 12, 1974, Anthony Roisman, a Washing
ton, D.C. attorney, presented your paper to a Senate sub
committee. What was the essence of that paper?
A: I told them that nuclear plants were producing
electricity 20 percent less than had been promised
earlier in utility Environmental Impact Statements. Plants
were producing less electricity because they were down
for repairs more than anticipated. This, because they had
not been built properly in the first place and because the
technology was turning out to have many more prob
lems than anyone dreamed of originally. If these prob
lems emanated from careless construction, then that was
a clear indication that quality assurance during the con
struction phase and earlier was inadequate. Most impor
tant of all, there was — and still is — no third-party in
spection of nuclear plants. I concluded that we should
question the inherent safety of these plants and restruc
ture the QA program for nuclear power.
Q: What was your objective in presenting this paper?
A: To slow down the industry, give people time to ad
dress some of the very grave problems I saw on the
horizon. I knew that the industry would be slowed if

people woke up to the truth — the plants had been sold
before they were properly designed. I think I was suc
cessful. It took Three Mile Island to convince people, but
the truth is out. All of my allegations were confirmed by
that accident.
Q: What were the subcommittees' findings?
A: That was in 1974 and they didn't do anything. They
didn't even respond to my paper. They just printed it and
let it stand. It challenged so many of the prevailing as
sumptions about nuclear power that it may have been an
overdose.
Q: There have been no recent reactions?
A: That's because so many Washington politicians
know they can't win if they take a stand on nuclear
power. If they come out against it, as Sens. Gary Hart and
Mike Gravel did, they're going to lose the support of the
large corporations. You have to realize there are hun
dreds of billions of dollars committed to nuclear tech
nology. Anyone who speaks out against it is likely to get
zapped. In this culture, one either plays the game ac
cording to the rules, supports American technology and
jobs, or gets out. There is too much money at stake.
Q: After you published the Senate paper, what hap
pened in the energy industry hierarchy?
A: The industry was so upset about it that they im
mediately circulated copies. Several electric power com
pany presidents called my president and started putting
pressure on him. He tried to get me to retract the paper
and, when I refused to back off from the Senate paper,
he fired me.
Q: Subsequently you turned over to Ralph Nader sev
eral confidential industry documents on reactor defi
ciencies. What did Nader do with these papers?
A: I'm not sure if Nader was the one but they all ended
up on Wall Street at investment banking firms. You've
got to understand that I was pretty paranoid at the time. I
had the evidence, but I couldn't get anyone to listen. I
could see an accident coming, but all anyone could think
of was protecting their investments. It was just un
believable. Anyway, when Wall Street got the docu
ments, they started to realize that General Electric had
marketed their reactor systems before they were proper
ly designed. Question: Do we, Wall Street, want to go on
loaning billions of dollars to electric power companies

who need capital to buy nuclear plants when these
plants may not turn out to be profitable after all? An
swer: No. And at that point the capital markets for nucle
ar power started drying up very quickly, both for design
reasons and because the cost overruns from nuclear
plants under construction started getting out of hand.

enting the paper and alleged that federal laws protecting
congressional witnesses had been violated. Certainly my
civil liberties had been abridged. But the Department of
