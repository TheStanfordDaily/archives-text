My doctor
pronounced
me cured
of cancer.
My boss
didnt.
My boss didn't under
stand that 1 was healthy
again
So I was let go
A lot of people are like
my boss They think that
everyone dies of cancer 1
thought so. too Until the
American Cancer Society,
through one of its service
and rehabilitation programs,
helped me return to a
normal life
The ACS also has local
Units that help Americans
who've never had cancer
understand it better
Today, more and more,
cancer is a curable disease
Ignorance about cancer is
curable, too
