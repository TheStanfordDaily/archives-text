A memorial ceremony, a rally in White Plaza anda film
of civil rights history highlight the commemoration here
today of Martin Luther King Jr."s birthday.
According to Ronald Hudson, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs, it is "imperative" that the slain civil rights
leader's birthday be remembered "in a very active way.
"We do him a disservice and we do ourselves a dis
service if we don't remember him," he said. "It's impor
tant to keep alive the legacy that he left us — a legacy of
love for everyone, a legacy of the struggle for the op
pressed, and a legacy of human rights and civil rights. In a
time when people were hesitant to speak out, he spoke
the loudest and most articulately."
Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice agreed that
the commemoration of King's birthday is necessary. "I
think he was one of the great leaders of our. country,"
she said. "He stood for civil rights for all human beings,

and to do that peaceably is the most important message
that we've had in the 20th century."
Hudson and Rice will join Anthropology Prof. James
Gibbs and Doris Wilson, Black Student Union co-chair
person, in reading selections from King's works at the
memorial service in Kresge Auditorium at 4:15 p.m.
Other campus events scheduled today to com
memorate King's birthday include a noon rally in White
Plaza which will feature student speakers; a film depict
ing the story of King's life, "From Montgomery to Mem
phis," at 6 p.m. in Ujamaa House lounge; and the movie
"Coolie High," sponsored by the Law School Film Socie
ty, at 8 p.m. in Kresge Auditorium.
The commemorative events began last night in Cub
berley Auditorium with a traditional African dance
matanga signifying the end of the mourning period.
Authentic Congolese dancers and music were used in

man is believed to unite with the participants.
