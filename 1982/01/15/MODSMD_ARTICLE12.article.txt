## Editorial Creationism: no science 
### 
Last week's decision by U.S. District Judge
William Overton overturning an Arkansas law
requiring creationism to be taught alongside
evolution was courageous, comprehensive and
constitutionally correct. Judge Overton was not
deceived by the attempt to label these biblically
inspired teachings as "creation science." Citing
the "inescapable religiosity" and "fallacious
pedagogy" of the lawand its supporters,
Overton's opinion detailed the history of
fundamentalist Christianity in this country and
rejected its latest attempts to force "the biblical
version of creation intothe publicschool
curricula."
The case has obvious parallels to the famous
Scopes monkey trial of the 19205, in which a
Tennessee schoolteacher was put on trial for
teaching evolution to his students. Creationists
argue that the same issue — student access to
competing theories — isat stake in the Arkansas
case. Pundits have dubbed the case "Scopes II"
in recognition of the latest confrontation
between fundamentalistsand the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The differences, however, are many and
significant. Scopes was stripped of his job and
subjected to criminal sanctions; no one is
suggesting the same treatment of
fundamentalists. More importantly, the
Arkansas law required creationism to be taught
in science classes, ratherthan the comparative

religion classes publicschoolscan, should, but
all too infrequently offer. Judge Overton
recognized that creationism, unlike evolution,
does not accept empirical refutation or
modification — the defining feature of scientific
inquiry.
Arkansas Attorney General Steve Clark,
saddled with the difficult responsibility of
defending the law, hassaid that hisoffice may
not appeal Judge Overton's decision. This has
been cited by the Rev. Jerry Falwell and others as
evidence supporting the unfaircriticism that
Clark has been lax in defending a lawthat clearly
violatesthe principleof separation of church
and state.
Without wishing to spend any more taxpayer
money on this issue, the Daily recognizes that
resolution by a higher court might serve as a
stronger precedent to preclude legislators in
other states from passing similar laws. We hope
that no furthercourt action is necessary to
persuade fundamentalist Christians to redirect
their efforts outside the arena of science in the
publicschools. Such billsare pending in more
than half the states, and a similar attempt was
defeated in California only last year. Matters of
faith are only tarnished and lessened by
claiming status as empiric science: in an age
where America needs both, the public
educational system should be able to teach its
students to clearly distinguish them.
