## Courts don't have last word 
### 
Washington — Federal judges
have been doing their best recently
to confirm a widespread suspicion
that "the courts run the country." A
flurry of notable decisions by a hand
ful of fellows has caught Americans
by surprise and, in some cases, left
them in shock.
On Christmas Eve, a federal court
judge in Boise, Idaho, single
handedly voided, as unconstitu
tional, Congress' 1978 extension of
the Equal Rights Amendment ratifi
cation deadline and upheld the "au
thority" of states to rescind their rati
fication decisions. Unless the Su
preme Court speedily overturns the
ruling, the amendment can be given
up for lost.
Four days later, a senior District
Court judge in Chicago ruled that the
suburban village of Morton Grove, Il
linois, had a right to ban the sale and
possession of handguns. Gun control
fans lauded the decision as a victory
for a civilized society.
And on Tuesday, jan. 5, a federal
judge in Little Rock threw out a state
law requiring equal treament of
evolutionary theory and "creation
science" in the Arkansas public
schools. Despite considerable local
support for the teachings of Genesis,
separation of church and state was
reaffirmed.
It would be negligent, of course, to
underestimate the import of these
decisions for both the players in
volved and the times in which we
live. In each case, a black-robed St.
George has scotched the dragons of
feminism, firearms and fundamen
talism. Forthe moment, America may
be better off as a result of the latter
two verdicts.
Yet even these rulings may prove
that it's unfair to accuse the judiciary
of wielding too much power.
To begin with, Americans tend to
be more interested in who wins and
who loses than in the merits of the is
sues at hand. As a result, judges ap
pear to hold more power than they
actually do.
As average court-watchers, for ex

ample, we care less about the fine
points of congressional authority
than whetherthe National Organiza
tion for Women will overcome the
Phyllis Schlaflys of the world. We also
cheer when the underdog gun-con
trol folks ring up a hit against the
well-financed National Rifle Associa
tion; whether or not to bear arms
seems a secondary consideration.
And though the rivals in Little Rock
seem as strong in their convictions as
ever, the case might have pleased
spectators best by ending in a draw.
Yet, in our passion for final scores,
we act as if a judge's decision can't be
challenged and possibly overturned
in other arenas. The judge in Idaho,
Marion Callister (who moonlights as
a bishop in the anti-ERA Mormon

fudges seem all-powerful in part because they
preside over the busiest social and political
battleground in America today. We've asked
them to resolve all kinds of conflicts and
personal disagreements; it's reached the
point where some college graduates are suing
their schools for failing to educate them
adequately.

church), seems to have not cared that
the courts have, in the past, tacitly al
lowed Congress to set its own dead
lines for ratification of constitutional
amendments.
By the same token, residents of
Friendship Heights, a Washington
suburb which recently banned the
possession of bullets, probably rec
ognize that the Morton grove ruling
— and by extension its own or
dinance — isn't safe from an appeal
by the NRA. Sometimes judges are
ignored entirely: On the same day of
the Arkansas ruling, the Mississippi
Senate overwhelmingly approved a
"creation science" provision for that
state's public schools.

because they preside over the busiest
social and political battleground in
America today. We've asked them to
resolve all kinds of conflicts and per
sonal disagreements; it's reached the
point where some college graduates
are suing their schools for failing to
educate them adequately. Not sur
prisingly, as the late Yale University
legal scholar Alexander Bickel wrote:
"All too many federal judges have
been induced to view themselves as
problem solvers, as charged with a
duty to act when majoritarian institu
tions do not." If the courts are pow
erful, we have only ourselves to
blame.
Of course, some judges are legal
lightweights who lack training but
possess political connections.

But even Supreme Court justices
have learned that they don't always
have the last word. The High Court's
1954 desegregation and 1973 abor
tion rulings, for example, have been
undermined or ignored across the
country. And the judiciary's conser
vative critics in Congress have
pledged to limit the Court's juris
diction further in 1982 with action on
anti-busing and anti-abortion
amendments to the Constitution.
When rulings on emotional issues
are handed down, Americans will
temporarily acquiesce as good
citizens. But they know there'll
always be another round.

Yet even these rulings may prove
that it's unfair to accuse the judiciary
of wielding too much power.
To begin with, Americans tend to
be more interested in who wins and
who loses than in the merits of the is

pear to hold more power than they
actually do.
As average court-watchers, for ex

Phyllis Schlaflys of the world. We also
cheer when the underdog gun-con

well-financed National Rifle Associa

seems a secondary consideration.

Of course, some judges are legal
lightweights who lack training but
possess political connections.

But even Supreme Court justices
have learned that they don't always
have the last word. The High Court's
1954 desegregation and 1973 abor

undermined or ignored across the
country. And the judiciary's conser
vative critics in Congress have
pledged to limit the Court's juris

anti-busing and anti-abortion
amendments to the Constitution.
When rulings on emotional issues
are handed down, Americans will
temporarily acquiesce as good
citizens. But they know there'll
always be another round.

Washington — Federal judges
have been doing their best recently
to confirm a widespread suspicion
that "the courts run the country." A
flurry of notable decisions by a hand
ful of fellows has caught Americans
by surprise and, in some cases, left
them in shock.
On Christmas Eve, a federal court
judge in Boise, Idaho, single
handedly voided, as unconstitu
tional, Congress' 1978 extension of
the Equal Rights Amendment ratifi
cation deadline and upheld the "au
thority" of states to rescind their rati
fication decisions. Unless the Su
preme Court speedily overturns the
ruling, the amendment can be given
up for lost.
Four days later, a senior District
Court judge in Chicago ruled that the
suburban village of Morton Grove, Il
linois, had a right to ban the sale and
possession of handguns. Gun control
fans lauded the decision as a victory
for a civilized society.
And on Tuesday, jan. 5, a federal
judge in Little Rock threw out a state
law requiring equal treament of
evolutionary theory and "creation
science" in the Arkansas public
schools. Despite considerable local
support for the teachings of Genesis,
separation of church and state was
reaffirmed.
It would be negligent, of course, to
underestimate the import of these
decisions for both the players in
volved and the times in which we
live. In each case, a black-robed St.
George has scotched the dragons of
feminism, firearms and fundamen
talism. Forthe moment, America may
be better off as a result of the latter
two verdicts.
