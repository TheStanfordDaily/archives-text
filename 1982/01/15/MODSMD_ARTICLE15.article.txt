## Guinea pigs lose self-destiny 
### 
In the new movie "Rollover," a character tries to de
scribe the catastrophic effects of a complicated financial
transaction by stating that "within a few days there will
be breadlines in Detroit." In a suburban Detroit theater,
10 people instantly responded to that line as if on cue.
"There already are breadlines in Detroit!," they shouted,
and they were deadly serious.
In Detroit, the nationwide recession takes the form of
a depression, and the Laffer curve is no longer a laughing
matter. What is often overlooked about President
Ronald Reagan's grand supply-side experiment is that it
is being carried out with human guinea pigs. Spending a
few days in Detroit tends to illustrate that point most em
phatically.
On closer inspection, the role of guinea pig pervades
our lives. Consider for example the breakfast you had
this morning. No doubt it was laced with preservatives.
Aside from salt, preservatives are largely a 20th-century
invention. Are they safe? Who knows?! As a politican
might say, all the returns are not in yet. Your great
grandchildren may have the answer, but you are going to
provide it by being the involuntary subject of a quasi-sci
entific experiment.
This is not necessarily bad. As Grace Slick once sang,
"Preservatives might just be preserving you, I think that's
something you missed."
Nevertheless, the chemical industry has used us all as
"volunteers" to conduct a wide variety of experiments.
Many people believe that the government, through
agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, pro
tects them from this type of experimentation. This is an
unrealistic assumption. There are far too many new com
pounds being synthesized to exhaustively test each one,
much less to determine the effects of all the possible
combinations. When a public utility processes water, not
all the impurities can be filtered out. Nor can they take
the time to test for the presence of any but the most com
mon of toxic compounds.
Often, the experiment begins inadvertently when
some chemical is used in a manner for which it was not
intended. A classic example of this occurred in my native
Michigan. Bags of fire retardant chemical, PBB, were
switched with bags of cattle food pellets. Consequently,
the cattle ate the PBB, which then went into their milk
and their meat. As a result, it is estimated that 98 percent
of Michigan residentsnowhavePßßintheirtissues. How
much (or how little) PBB constitutes a harmful amount?
The verdict is not in yet. Ask me when I'm 64.
The government and the chemical industry provide
the best examples of experimentation with unwitting
human subjects, but not the only ones by any means. In
Canada and the Midwest, the effects of electromagnetic
fields from very high voltage transmission lines are the
cause of some concern. In Pennsylvania, each time a
"small" amount of radioactive gas is"harmlessly vented"
into the atmosphere at Three Mile Island, a new experi
ment begins. In Moscow, microwave radiation is aimed

at the U.S embassy continuously. Do the Soviets know
something about this that we don't?
Since we are made to function as guinea pigs in so
many aspects of our lives, is it any wonder that most
Americans feel so helpless? We hear complaints that life
has become too bureaucratic and too impersonal; that
one man can no longer make a difference. Former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, in one of the few statements he ever
made which I agreed with, said we were suffering from
"a national malaise of the spirit." I attribute this directly
to the loss of self-destiny which results from being a hu
man guinea pig. Self-destiny controls self-esteem.

We cannot and should not eliminate involuntary risks.
A stagnant society which refuses to take risks is no better
off than a reckless one composed of fools who rush in
where angels fear to tread. However, involuntary risks
should be undertaken for the proper reasons. Risks
which have the potential to genuinely improve the quali
ty of our lives should be encouraged, but risks which will
merely add convenience should not. For example, ex
perimentation with miracle drugs should be en
couraged, but the use of aerosol cans, which may or may
not destroy the earth's ozone layer, should not.
There is no free lunch. This was ignored by the men
who started many of the experiments which we now find
ourselves to be the subjects of. Their intentions may have
been good, but in their quest to reap the short-term ben
efits of some new-found knowledge, they were blind to
the penalties which future generations would have to
pay for their actions. We should learn from their mis
takes.

human subjects, but not the only ones by any means. In
Canada and the Midwest, the effects of electromagnetic
fields from very high voltage transmission lines are the
cause of some concern. In Pennsylvania, each time a
"small" amount of radioactive gas is"harmlessly vented"
into the atmosphere at Three Mile Island, a new experi
ment begins. In Moscow, microwave radiation is aimed

at the U.S embassy continuously. Do the Soviets know
something about this that we don't?
Since we are made to function as guinea pigs in so
many aspects of our lives, is it any wonder that most
Americans feel so helpless? We hear complaints that life
has become too bureaucratic and too impersonal; that
one man can no longer make a difference. Former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, in one of the few statements he ever
made which I agreed with, said we were suffering from
"a national malaise of the spirit." I attribute this directly
to the loss of self-destiny which results from being a hu
man guinea pig. Self-destiny controls self-esteem.

We cannot and should not eliminate involuntary risks.
A stagnant society which refuses to take risks is no better
off than a reckless one composed of fools who rush in
where angels fear to tread. However, involuntary risks
should be undertaken for the proper reasons. Risks
which have the potential to genuinely improve the quali
ty of our lives should be encouraged, but risks which will
merely add convenience should not. For example, ex
perimentation with miracle drugs should be en
couraged, but the use of aerosol cans, which may or may
not destroy the earth's ozone layer, should not.
There is no free lunch. This was ignored by the men
who started many of the experiments which we now find
ourselves to be the subjects of. Their intentions may have
been good, but in their quest to reap the short-term ben
efits of some new-found knowledge, they were blind to
the penalties which future generations would have to
pay for their actions. We should learn from their mis
takes.

In the new movie "Rollover," a character tries to de
scribe the catastrophic effects of a complicated financial
transaction by stating that "within a few days there will
be breadlines in Detroit." In a suburban Detroit theater,
10 people instantly responded to that line as if on cue.
"There already are breadlines in Detroit!," they shouted,
and they were deadly serious.
In Detroit, the nationwide recession takes the form of
a depression, and the Laffer curve is no longer a laughing
matter. What is often overlooked about President
Ronald Reagan's grand supply-side experiment is that it
is being carried out with human guinea pigs. Spending a
few days in Detroit tends to illustrate that point most em
phatically.
On closer inspection, the role of guinea pig pervades
our lives. Consider for example the breakfast you had
this morning. No doubt it was laced with preservatives.
Aside from salt, preservatives are largely a 20th-century
invention. Are they safe? Who knows?! As a politican
might say, all the returns are not in yet. Your great
grandchildren may have the answer, but you are going to
provide it by being the involuntary subject of a quasi-sci
entific experiment.
This is not necessarily bad. As Grace Slick once sang,
"Preservatives might just be preserving you, I think that's
something you missed."
Nevertheless, the chemical industry has used us all as
"volunteers" to conduct a wide variety of experiments.
Many people believe that the government, through
agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, pro
tects them from this type of experimentation. This is an
unrealistic assumption. There are far too many new com
pounds being synthesized to exhaustively test each one,
much less to determine the effects of all the possible
combinations. When a public utility processes water, not
all the impurities can be filtered out. Nor can they take
the time to test for the presence of any but the most com
mon of toxic compounds.
Often, the experiment begins inadvertently when
some chemical is used in a manner for which it was not
intended. A classic example of this occurred in my native
Michigan. Bags of fire retardant chemical, PBB, were
switched with bags of cattle food pellets. Consequently,
the cattle ate the PBB, which then went into their milk
and their meat. As a result, it is estimated that 98 percent
of Michigan residentsnowhavePßßintheirtissues. How
much (or how little) PBB constitutes a harmful amount?
The verdict is not in yet. Ask me when I'm 64.
