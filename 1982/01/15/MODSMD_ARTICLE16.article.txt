## Caffeine confession from Zion 
### 
I confess, I confess! Bill Deverell
(Daily, Jan. 5), I am one of those peo
ple who drinks coffee in classl Yes, I
know who I am, but, please kind sir,
let me explain. My shameful vice is
the result of a deprived childhood.
Every morning in Salt Lake City, my
styrofoam cup of the Devil's brew vi
olated the Words of Wisdom. The
prophet Joseph Smith spun in his
grave! And as my childish hands
clung desperately to my cup of sin,
the vision of a perfect society in
which all persons conformed to stan
dards from on high rose before my
eyes through the steam of my caf
feine fix. In this perfect city, the
broad streets were laid out in a per
fectly square grid. The people abs
tained from alcohol, tobacco, caf
feineand birth control. Wiseold men
had visions which guided the people.
And everyone wore a special kind of
underwear.
So now, exiled from Zion, I can
only recapture my childhood vision
in the lethargy-dispelling mist of my
morning cup of coffee.
