## Card comeback fails Huskies whip hoopsters 
### Mike Oneal 
Seattle — Life can be harsh in
the north woods.
Facing it's second un
defeated team this week, the
Stanford basketball team
tripped again last night and fell
to the Pacific-10 Conference
leading Washington Huskies,
75-70 in Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion.
The game had it's bright
spots for Stanford, unlike the
team's 81-38 debacle against
Oregon State Monday night.
But the Cardinal showed that it
still has a hard time putting a
solid effort together.
"You would think that as
Stanford people, we're sup
posed to have good SAT scores,
particularly in math. You'd
think we would be able to fig
ure out that a game lasts 40
minutes," head coach Dick
Dißiaso said after the game.
What he was referring to was
a first half which looked very
much like an extension of
Monday's tragi-comedy.
Shooting 37 percent from the
floor, Stanford had 11 turn
overs in the half, while the
Huskies systematically ran the
Cards off the court.
The half was close (though
sloppy) for all of five minutes,
until Washington forward Ken
ny Lyles stuffed a tip-in of an
errant Brad Watson shot, forc
ing a Stanford time-out with
14:57 remaining. After that, the
Huskies settled into their pro
foundly patient offense and
worked towards their 34-21
halftime lead.
The second half saw Stanford
improve in shooting to 70 per
cent, which helped to chip the
deficit down to ten points with
17:33 remaining. Guard Steve
Brown, who finished with nine

points, led the early charge
with two quick buckets, but
then the Huskiesthrew in elev
en unanswered points to step
back up by 20 with 13:48 left.
Stanford took an 11 point run
itself with 9:33 left, sparked by
three Doug Marty jumpshots,
but was unable to finish the kill.
Washington kept to it's steady
offense, stayed agressive on
defense, and taking advantage
of 15 second half Cardinal turn
overs, held on to win 75-70.
What Stanford did in the sec
ond half was move the ball to a
variety of players. Whereas
Monday the Cardinal had only
one player, Johnny Rogers, in
double figures, last night Rog
ers had 19, Marty had 10, and
center John Revelli had 16.
Forward Brian Welch con
tinued his Washington slump,
shooting 2-9 from the floor,
making his Hec Edmundson to
tal for the last two years 3-23.
A problem in both games has
been the constant double
teaming of Revelli, which in
hibits the ball from flowing eas
ily inside and back out on of
fense. According to Dißiaso,
with two men on him Revelli
has to concentrate on fighting
underneath instead of passing.
Consequently he has trouble
dealing the ball off to different
men outside and fewer people
get a chance to shoot.
Husky head coach Marv
Harshman agreed.
"Stanford is more effective
when they play openly,"
Harshman said. "They have to
have a lot of players shooting
the ball. When they slow down
and become deliberate they
don't shoot very well."
Harshman's team, on the
other hand, plays deliberately
very well. The Huskies play

very much like Orgon State in
that they are quick and op
portunistic, but are also willing
to work the cover off the ball.
Neither Washington nor Or
egon State has a big star, and
both spread out their scoring
among a bevy of players. Wash
ington had five players in
double figures last night, led by
the agressive and street smart
senior guard Steve Burks, who
finished with 15.
Stanford travels to Pullman,
Washington today in prepara
tion for tomorrow night's
matchup with Washington
State University. Led by 6-9 for
ward Guy Williams, George
Raveling's Cougars barely
fought off UC-Berkeley last
night in overtime, 57-55.
Another deliberate team,
WSU has been yielding an av
erage of only 58.3 points per
game this season. 3-1 in Pac-10
play, it is currently in a tie for
second place.

particularly in math. You'd
think we would be able to fig
ure out that a game lasts 40
minutes," head coach Dick
Dißiaso said after the game.
What he was referring to was
a first half which looked very
much like an extension of
Monday's tragi-comedy.
Shooting 37 percent from the
floor, Stanford had 11 turn
overs in the half, while the
Huskies systematically ran the
Cards off the court.
The half was close (though
sloppy) for all of five minutes,
until Washington forward Ken
ny Lyles stuffed a tip-in of an
errant Brad Watson shot, forc
ing a Stanford time-out with
14:57 remaining. After that, the
Huskies settled into their pro
foundly patient offense and
worked towards their 34-21
halftime lead.
The second half saw Stanford
improve in shooting to 70 per
cent, which helped to chip the
deficit down to ten points with
17:33 remaining. Guard Steve
Brown, who finished with nine

points, led the early charge
with two quick buckets, but
then the Huskiesthrew in elev
en unanswered points to step
back up by 20 with 13:48 left.
Stanford took an 11 point run
itself with 9:33 left, sparked by
three Doug Marty jumpshots,
but was unable to finish the kill.
Washington kept to it's steady
offense, stayed agressive on
defense, and taking advantage
of 15 second half Cardinal turn
overs, held on to win 75-70.
What Stanford did in the sec
ond half was move the ball to a
variety of players. Whereas
Monday the Cardinal had only
one player, Johnny Rogers, in
double figures, last night Rog
ers had 19, Marty had 10, and
center John Revelli had 16.
Forward Brian Welch con
tinued his Washington slump,
shooting 2-9 from the floor,
making his Hec Edmundson to
tal for the last two years 3-23.
A problem in both games has
been the constant double
teaming of Revelli, which in
hibits the ball from flowing eas
ily inside and back out on of
fense. According to Dißiaso,
with two men on him Revelli
has to concentrate on fighting
underneath instead of passing.
Consequently he has trouble
dealing the ball off to different
men outside and fewer people
get a chance to shoot.
Husky head coach Marv
Harshman agreed.
"Stanford is more effective
when they play openly,"
Harshman said. "They have to
have a lot of players shooting
the ball. When they slow down
and become deliberate they
don't shoot very well."
Harshman's team, on the
other hand, plays deliberately
very well. The Huskies play

very much like Orgon State in
that they are quick and op
portunistic, but are also willing
to work the cover off the ball.
Neither Washington nor Or
egon State has a big star, and
both spread out their scoring
among a bevy of players. Wash
ington had five players in
double figures last night, led by
the agressive and street smart
senior guard Steve Burks, who
finished with 15.
Stanford travels to Pullman,
Washington today in prepara
tion for tomorrow night's
matchup with Washington
State University. Led by 6-9 for
ward Guy Williams, George
Raveling's Cougars barely
fought off UC-Berkeley last
night in overtime, 57-55.
Another deliberate team,
WSU has been yielding an av
erage of only 58.3 points per
game this season. 3-1 in Pac-10
play, it is currently in a tie for
second place.
Seattle — Life can be harsh in
the north woods.
Facing it's second un
defeated team this week, the
Stanford basketball team
tripped again last night and fell
to the Pacific-10 Conference
leading Washington Huskies,
75-70 in Hec Edmundson Pavil
ion.
The game had it's bright
spots for Stanford, unlike the
team's 81-38 debacle against
Oregon State Monday night.
But the Cardinal showed that it
still has a hard time putting a
solid effort together.
"You would think that as
Stanford people, we're sup
posed to have good SAT scores,
particularly in math. You'd
think we would be able to fig
ure out that a game lasts 40
minutes," head coach Dick
Dißiaso said after the game.
