# Tankers destroy Arizona

### Nick Ferguson 
The men's swim team tuned up for a tough up
coming schedule yesterday with a blow-out vic
tory over last year's No. 11 team in the nation, Ar
izona University..
Stanford's 80-33 win at deGuerre pool
avenged last year's three-point loss in Tuscon
when the Wildcats won on the very last event.
This time around the outcome was never in
doubt as the Cardinal took the meet-opening
400 medley-relay event by three seconds, and
never looked back.
Stanford won much more easily than was ex
pected, in part because the Wildcats brought
only nine swimmers to the competition.
Cardinal Coach Skip Kenney said prior to the
meet that he thought it might hinge on the last
event, since Arizona has all of last year's swim
mers back, including NCAA champion Doug
Towne.
Instead Stanford dominated, winning 10 of the
14 events and sweeping two of them. In many of
the races Stanford went virtually unchallenged.
Arizona coach Dick Jouchums appeared to
expect as much before the meet. "We just hope
to keep it close, because we're going to get
beat," was the way he put it.
Jouchum's pessimism can be attributed to
some teams' lack of concern with regular season
competition. Instead of coveting the conference
championship, most teams use the regular sea
son as a training period and time to test their
swimmers for the national championships.
Jouchums put forward that philosophy for his

squad yesterday.
"You coach for the end of the year," he said,
adding that much of his team was sick in Novem
ber and fell behind in training. For this reason,
he said he simply wanted to see at what stage his
team was, and wasn't concerned with winning.
The men took a big step toward ac
complishing their post-season goals. Kenney
said he was very pleased in particular with the
improvement over the last week in turn and fin
ishes. He added that he felt his team members
kept their concentration in races even when
they weren't pushed by the Wildcats. This was
most evident in the 400-yard individual medley
and the 200-yard backstroke.
In the medley, the four top finishers were
John Simons, Todd Lincoln, Carter Cast and Jim
Anderson, all from Stanford.
In the backstroke, Wade Flemons, Mike Con
aton, Cast and Anderson took the top three
spots, plus a fifth. In addition the Cardinal took
both relays, and finished well against a strong
Wildcat diving team.
The lopsided victory and dominant swimming
by Stanford indicated one more revealing fact:
the Cardinal is steadily working it's way into top
playoff form. An example is long distance swim
mer Bari Weick, who made his return to com
petition yesterday with firsts in the 500 and 1000-
yard freestyle events after sitting out for academ
ic reasons.
Weick was generally pleased with his per
formance. "I wasn't sure what I had in me so I
decided to take it a little smooth," he said.


TANKERS TRIUMPH â€” The Stanford men's swim team de
molished the University of Arizona yesterday at deGuerre
pool, and in doing so avenged a narrow three-point loss to

Bill Phelps/Daily
the Wildcats last year in Tuscon. The Cardinal took 10 of 14
events in cruising to the 80-33 blow-out final score.
