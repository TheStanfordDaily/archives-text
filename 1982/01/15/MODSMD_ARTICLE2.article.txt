# University fights research limits on Soviet scholar
## 
### Todd Pickett Senior staff writer 
University officials have notified
the National Academy of Sciences
that they will not comply with State
Department restrictions on Soviet
scholar Nikolay Umnov's access to
University programs and research
during his planned visit to the Uni
versity in May.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost
and dean of graduate studies and re
search, told the N AS that he was "sur
prised and disturbed" at the NAS
memorandum which suggested ap
plying the restrictions to the visiting
scholar. Umnov plans to study re
search in roboticsatfourother Amer
ican universities besides Stanford,
said Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth, who will host the
scholar.
The restrictions, as outlined in the
NAS memorandum sent Dec. 14,
would prohibit the scholar from ob
taining access to University research
funded by the Department of De
fense. In addition, the Soviet scientist
would be excluded from visiting in
dustries and observing the program
ming and control techniques em
ployed in robot operation.
In the letter to the NAS, Lieberman
wrote, "It is the University's position
that federal export regulations
should not apply to any of Stanford's
activities on the grounds that our re
search programs represent basic and
unclassified investigations, the re
sults of which are generally available
to the public."
Security fears?
"It is incumbent upon the State
Department not to let him enter if
they are concerned about security,"
Lieberman told The Stanford Daily.
"They should not put the policing on
the shoulders of the universities," he
said.
Even if the University had the
r eans of carrying out such policing,
Lieberman wrote the NAS, "such ac

tions would drastically disrupt the ac
ademic environment which is essen
tial in fostering creative research en
deavors."
In the letter, Lieberman said the
Defense Department funded about
one-sixth of the more than 1000 re
search grants and contracts received
by the University. He said the Univer
sity has no means of monitoring this
vast amount of research, totaling
more than $120 million. He also
stressed that it was against University
policy to conduct classified research.
Contradiction in terms
Arthur Schawlow, J.G. Jackson-C.J.
Wood Professor of Physics and a 1981
Nobel prize winner, said restrictions
placed on viewing unclassified re
search is a contradiction in terms.
Usually, State Department export
restrictions have applied to the sale
of such items as computers to certain
foreign countries, said Roth.
"Now they're trying to restrict
ideas," he said. "There's no reason
for it." Roth added that robotics
presently has little or no military use
and that its potential for military use
is limited. Walking robots, Umnov's
special interest, exist only in the most
primitive forms and remain more a
scientific fascination than a useful
tool for the immediate future, said
Roth.
"If you imaginea hundred ofthese
things walking across a battlefield at
you, forget it," added Roth. Soviet
researchers pioneered much of the
work in walking robots, he said.
"Guys in the U.S. who know some
thing about it learned it from the
Russians â€” and freely admit it," Roth
told the University News Service.
Stanford is not alone in its re
sistance to restrictions on incoming
foreign scholars. University President
Donald Kennedy, along with other
university presidents, opposed simi
lar restrictions on research and
teaching last year, said Roth. More
recently, the University of Minnesota

and MIT shunned similar restrictions.
The increasing number of govern
ment restrictions seems part of a re
cent trend to clamp down on the
transfer of information from the
United States to foreign countries,
said Political Science Prof. Alexander
Dallin. Restrictions on a Soviet schol
ar might restrict opportunities for
U.S. scholars to participate in ex
change programs, one of the few
ways for Americans to view Soviet
technology, said Dallin.
Computer Science Prof. John Mc-
Carthy, who has visited the Soviet
Union many times on similar re
search opportunities, maintains that
some restrictions should exist as
bargaining chips to pressure coun
tries such as the Soviet Union into al
lowing U.S. scholars greater ex
posure to Soviet technology. "We
have very little access there now," he
said.
Bargaining chips
The University previously ex
perienced similar restrictions on two
scholars from China, said Lieberman.
The University refused to place limits
on the scholars' research, and the re
strictions were not enforced by the
State Department, he said.
Lieberman said he hoped the NAS
would reconsider its endorsement of
the restrictions and wrote, "We be
lieve that the best interests of Ameri
can science and technology are
served by open exchanges of univer
sity research activities and hope that
the Academy will visibly support uni
versities' position on this critical is
sue."
Schawlow suggested the restric
tion might have been passed along
by the National Research Council,
which administers details of such ex
changes and seldom receives close
scrutiny from other NAS officials.
Both Roth and Lieberman said they
doubted that NAS President Frank
Press has seen and approved the
memorandum.
