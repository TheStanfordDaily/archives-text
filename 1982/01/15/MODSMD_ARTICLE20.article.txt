# Stanford takes on European amateur champs
## Water poloists host Yugoslavs 
### Chris Addington 
Last fall when the Stan
ford water polo team went
31 games without a loss, cul
minating in an NCAA cham
pionship, people stopped
and paid attention. Well,
once again it's time to stop
and check out what's going
on in the world of water
polo.
Tomorrow afternoon at
deGuerre pool the Stanford
Water Polo Club (Stanford's
American Athletic Union af
filiated team) will take on
the best in European water
polo in the form of the Jug-
Bubrovnick club team from
Yugoslavia.
Who can forget that game
last spring when the
Cardinal tied the Yugo
slavian Nationals 10-10?
Well, this match promises to

be an almost identical and
exciting face-off.
Pacing the Stanford squad
will be players familiar to all
water polo fans. Leading the
pack will be All-America
seniors jody Campbell and
Alan Mouchawar, and jun
ior James Bergeson.
Also appearing will be
Stanford graduates Doug
Burke, an Olympic team
member and memberofthe
Cardinal NCAA title teams
in 1976 and 1978, and Drew
McDonald, who also played
for the 1976 championship
team.
Making their first ap
pearances for Stanford will
be red-shirt transfer stu
dents Curtis Hanst from UC-
Santa Barbara, and Kirk
Jensen from UC-Berkeley.
Both these players were reg

ular starters for their respec
tive teams before coming to
the Farm.
The Yugoslavian team
won the European Club
championships last year,
and has consistently been
on top of the European wa
ter polo circuit. Last year,
they defeated the US Na
tional team while the Amer
icans were on their Europe
an tour.
Five members of the Yu
goslavian National team
play for Jug, including Bos
co, the National team cap
tain and hole man.
Typical of European-style
water polo, the smallest
player on the Jug team is 6-
foot-1. Their big man stands
6-6, and tips the scale at 250
pounds.
Stanford coach Dante

Dettamanti commented on
the size of the Yugoslavs.
"In Europe they don't have
football, so all the big guys
go out for water polo," he
said. The popularity of the
sport on the continent has
lead to an overall European
dominance of the sport in
the last few decades.
Dettamanti promised an
excellent game. "This shoud
really be a good chance to
watch someofthefinestwa
ter polo in the world," he
said.
The match will sprint off
at 3 p.m. Admission-dona
tions will help support the
Jug team during it's Califor
nia tour, which will include
a stop Sunday in Vallejo to
play the Northern California
Olympic squad.
