# Women cagers face conference rival Cal
## 
### 
The Stanford women's basketball team will face
conference arch-rival and defending champion Cal
tonight at Maples Pavilion beginning at 7:30. Both
teams are favorites to take the Norcal title this season.
Thell-4Cardinal women have won 10of the last 11
games, their best start since 1978. Their only losses
came against nationally ranked teams: Texas (No. 16),
Montana (No. 8), USC (No. 2), and Cal-State Long
Beach (No. 6).
Cal's 11-6 record seems a lot stronger than it really
is. The Bears have fluctuated, winning their first five
games only to lose the next six in a row. They come
into tommorow's game on top of a six-game winning
streak, however.
The Cardinal will have to contend with 6-foot-6 Cal
center Sarah Thamer, the tallest player in the con
ference and leading scorer for the Bears with a 13.1
point average. But Thamer does most of her work off
the bench, performing better in substitution situ

ations than as a starter.
Starting at center for the Bears is Chris Sellin. At 6-2,
she is the second-leading scorer with a 12.6 average.
Also a scoring threat is guard Karen Smith, who has
been averaging 11.5 points an outing.
But the Bears face an experienced Cardinal squad
that presently leads the conference statistically in
both offense and defense. Stanford is ranked No.ll
nationally on defense, and has out-rebounded it's op
position 43-37.
