STICKNEY'S HICK'RY
HOUSE
Four locations —
1852 El Camino Real,
Redwood City
1 Town & Country Village,
Palo Alto
3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto
3041 Stevens Creek Road,
Santa Clara
In the Good Old Days, when
El Camino Real (the King's
Highway) was still the only
coastal highway on the Penin
sula, and the leisurely trip from
San Francisco to San Jose was a
favorite Sunday family pastime,
Adrian "Red" Stickney opened
his first Hick'ry House restau
rant in Redwood City at a junc
tion of five roads, across the
street from the Five Points
motel.
That was back in 1950, and
quite a lot has changed since
then: Highways 101 and 280
now dominate the area, the
Five Points motel has vanished,
El Camino has been widened,
the Woodside Road Overpass
has been built. .. and Stickney
now runs a quartet of Western
style restaurants dotting the
commercial pathway of El
Camino down to the edge of
San Jose.
The Old West theme fea
tures prominently in ail four
"Stickney's Hick'ry House" res
taurants (actually the southern
Palo Alto location is called
"Stickney's Flamingo"), all
serving a "typically American"
menu: hamburgers, fried
chicken, shrimp, scallops, hot

sandwiches and in the tradition
of "Stickney's" since 1950, the
specialty of the house is still
wood-fire barbequed meat —
spareribs, chicken, pork,
sirloin of beef — prepared in
the hickory pit designed and
patented by Stickney himself.
Stickney's entrance into the
restaurant business followed 10
years of experience in the meat
business; he worked his way up
from delivery boy to butcherto
owner of three meat markets in
Alameda (where he was born
and raised). Four years after he
opened the original "Stick
ney's" in Redwood City, Stick
ney opened up his second lo
cation in Town & Country Vil
lage, with a menu that featured
BBQ ribs and chicken forabout
$2 a portion. By this time, Stick
ney had expanded his reper
toire to include a variety of
baked goods, having learned
about baking the hard way;
personnel problems with his
bakers forced him to teach
himself pie-baking from a
book called Pie Marches On.
Eventually the original
Redwood City location also be
came the headquarters for
Stickney's Central Baking Plant
which supplies all four "Stick
ney's" with their burger buns
(one of the special attractions
of Stickney's hamburgers), as
well as an extraordinary variety
of pastries, cookies, pure
whipped cream cakes, pies,
and more. (I'm a devoted fan of
the pineapple-bran muffins
myself.) Today "Stickney's" is
as well known for its quality
meats as it is for its baked

goods; in recent years, "Stick
ney's" has received a number
of awards for outstanding
achievement in the food in
dustry, and in a San lose
Mercury article on South Bay
barbeque spots, Stickney's ribs
were ranked among the top 10
BBQ spots (with a rack of eight
costing $6.25).
The decor of all four "Stick
ney's" reflects a nostalgia for
the Old West: in the Town &
Country location, for example,
there are enormous wooden
beams from Northern Califor
nia bridges supporting the
building, and some of the orig
inal bolts are still embedded
in the wood. Hanging on the
wall is Stickney's own branding
iron — an original Stickney de
sign that he admits has never
been registered, or burned
into a single hide. . .
The Stanford Room of the
Town & Country "Stickney's"
tells the story of a long-stand
ing relationship with Stanford

athletics. The establishment of
this restaurant in 1954 (making
ittheoldest resident of Town &
Country Village) also marked
the beginning of the Stickney
Sports Foundation, which hon
orsa topStanfordathleteofthe
month (recent recipients in

clude Tim Mayotte, Anne
Tweedy, Darrin Nelson), and
an athlete of the year (Milt
McColl was the most recent
winner). The Foundation also
supports the Buck Club, the
Cardinal Club and variousath
letic events throughout Stan

ford's season.
This Stanford connection
dates back to Stickney's friend
ship with coach Chuck Taylor,
and Stickney recalls the days of
limited scholarship arrange
ments when players often
worked at "Stickney's" for

their meals. Because Stickney's
own athletic career was cut
short when he had to start
working to support himself,
Stickney feels a personal com
mitment to help other athletes
whenever he can. He is cur
rently a sponsor of a number of
Little League teams, Babe Ruth
baseball teams and Police
Youth Leagues, as well as an ac
tive member of the Palo Club.
Clearly "Stickney's" is much
more than any old coffee shop
offering convenience and long
hours; it'salandmarkinitsown
right and a loyal Stanford
friend of nearly three decades.
Perhaps the best testament to
"Stickney's" popularity lies in
the simple fact of its lasting suc
cess over these past 32 years on
the South Peninsula. That's
quite a bit longer than most of
us have been at Stanford, and it
looks like "Stickney's" will still
be around long after we're
gone.

The decor of all four "Stick

This Stanford connection
dates back to Stickney's friend

their meals. Because Stickney's
own athletic career was cut
short when he had to start

Stickney feels a personal com

Little League teams, Babe Ruth
baseball teams and Police

more than any old coffee shop

"Stickney's" popularity lies in
the simple fact of its lasting suc

looks like "Stickney's" will still
be around long after we're

STICKNEY'S HICK'RY
HOUSE
Four locations —
1852 El Camino Real,
Redwood City
1 Town & Country Village,
Palo Alto
3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto
3041 Stevens Creek Road,
Santa Clara
In the Good Old Days, when
El Camino Real (the King's
Highway) was still the only
coastal highway on the Penin
sula, and the leisurely trip from
San Francisco to San Jose was a
favorite Sunday family pastime,
Adrian "Red" Stickney opened
his first Hick'ry House restau
rant in Redwood City at a junc
tion of five roads, across the
street from the Five Points
motel.
That was back in 1950, and
quite a lot has changed since
then: Highways 101 and 280
now dominate the area, the
Five Points motel has vanished,
El Camino has been widened,
the Woodside Road Overpass
has been built. .. and Stickney
now runs a quartet of Western
style restaurants dotting the
commercial pathway of El
Camino down to the edge of
San Jose.
The Old West theme fea
tures prominently in ail four
"Stickney's Hick'ry House" res
taurants (actually the southern
Palo Alto location is called
"Stickney's Flamingo"), all
serving a "typically American"
menu: hamburgers, fried
chicken, shrimp, scallops, hot

sandwiches and in the tradition
of "Stickney's" since 1950, the
specialty of the house is still
wood-fire barbequed meat —
spareribs, chicken, pork,
sirloin of beef — prepared in
the hickory pit designed and
patented by Stickney himself.
Stickney's entrance into the
restaurant business followed 10
years of experience in the meat
business; he worked his way up
from delivery boy to butcherto
owner of three meat markets in
Alameda (where he was born
and raised). Four years after he
opened the original "Stick
ney's" in Redwood City, Stick
ney opened up his second lo
cation in Town & Country Vil
lage, with a menu that featured
BBQ ribs and chicken forabout
$2 a portion. By this time, Stick
ney had expanded his reper
toire to include a variety of
baked goods, having learned
about baking the hard way;
personnel problems with his
bakers forced him to teach
himself pie-baking from a
book called Pie Marches On.
Eventually the original
Redwood City location also be
came the headquarters for
Stickney's Central Baking Plant
which supplies all four "Stick
ney's" with their burger buns
(one of the special attractions
of Stickney's hamburgers), as
well as an extraordinary variety
of pastries, cookies, pure
whipped cream cakes, pies,
and more. (I'm a devoted fan of
the pineapple-bran muffins
myself.) Today "Stickney's" is
as well known for its quality
meats as it is for its baked

goods; in recent years, "Stick
