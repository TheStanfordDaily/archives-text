TWO SISTERS — Country French Cuisine
355 State Street
Los Altos
941-2782
Once upon a time, a Stanford student returned
from the Tours campus and decided to open a French
restaurant in Los Altos; she enlisted the help of her sis
ter, and "Two Sisters" was born.
Now owned by Jean Wolfgram, "Two Sisters" is lo
cated in the peaceful downtown shopping area of Los
Altos, and the restaurant mirrors this peacefulness
even on busy nights. The atmosphere is both cheerful
and intimate; sectioned-off dining areas are deco
rated with French posters, plants and some country
side objects, and there is quiet music playing in the
background. Customers here are dressed casually as
well as formally.
If you've never tried crepes before, this is a great
place to start; the nine different crepe choices are
sure to appeal to crepe gourmets as well. And if you
aren't in the mood for crepes, "Two Sisters" has a di
verse offering of six non-crepe entrees, two quiche
dinners, or a choice of six dinner-size salads.
We decided to be courageous and arrived without
a reservation, spur-of-the-moment style, at 8 p.m. on
a Friday. Although we were told the place wasfull and
we would have a 10- to 15-minute wait, we were sur
prised to find ourselves seated after only 5 minutes —
before we even received our cocktails.
French bread and real butter were brought to our
table as soon as we were seated. I must say I was
pleased to find the butter was soft and spreadable; I

have never understood why butter is served on ice in
so many fancy restaurants — you always end up tear
ing your bread to shreds trying to spread an iced pat
of butter on it. Thank you, "Two Sisters/' for bucking
tradition!
My companion ordered one of the dinner entrees,
Filet of Beef Bearnaise ($9), a cut of top sirloin in tar
ragon sauce that was very tender and well-prepared.
As with the other dinners, it was served with rice pilaf,
vegetables, and a choice of soup or the make-your
own salad bar. I had a terrible time deciding which
crepe to try, and asked our waitress for recommenda
tions. She was friendly and helpful, and I finally de
cided on the Paysanne Stroganoff ($7.50), a crepe
filled with slices of top sirloin, mushrooms and on
ions, and covered with a sour cream and sherry sauce.
It was as delicious as it was filling. I chose the salad bar
to go with my meal; and made-my-own with all fresh
vegetables and my choice of three homemade salad
dressings. My companion ordered the soup of the day
— a homemade, thick seafood chowder.
Owner Jean Wolfgram has been making food her
hobby for many years: she majored in food science in
college and taught it at Cubberley High School for
eight years. Wolfgram is the "Two Sisters" gourmet
and mastermind; she personally trains all of her chefs
and is responsible for the many crepe combinations
by which I was so tempted. The eight varieties I didn't
get to try are stuffed with every delicacy imaginable:
ratatouille, spinach with cheeses, chicken, beef with
tomatoes, fresh salmon with hollandaise, scallops
with shrimp, and so on. The non-crepe dinner entrees
also feature a variety of seafood and meat dishes, all in

the "country French" tradition.
To accompany our meal, we tried a half liter of the
house Chablis ($3.75) and found it very heavy for a
white wine. We then ordered a half liter of 1979
Rutherford Hill Chardonnay (a special) from the Napa
Valley ($5). I would recommend splurging on some
thing from the wine list rather than drinking the
house wine; for a little more money, we got a far su
perior wine.
Even after a filling dinner, the dessert list at "Two
Sisters" can still make your mouth water. The selec
tions are all delectable, with names like Jamaican
Pleasure, Mocha Surprise and Fantasy Fudge Crepe
($3 each), all filled with various combinations of ice
creams, sauces and whipped cream. Or you can try
Chocolate Mousse, a cheesecake crepe, or even
Crepes Suzette ($3.50) — two royal crepes of Coin
treau and orange butter served flaming at your table.
If your appetite is calling for something a little less
challenging, you can order a Mini Pleasure ($1.75)
which is any of the ice cream combinations served as a
sundae ("You design your own little dessert").
And for specialty coffee lovers, "Two Sisters" will
send you home with a tasty nightcap. You have your
choice of Irish Coffee, Athenian Coffee (with amaret
to), Empress Coffee (with Cream de Cacao), or the
more unusual Tuaca Coffee (with a semi-sweet li
queur from Italy).
Whether you're looking for a special lunch, Sunday
brunch, a quiet dinner or an unusual dessert treat,
"Two Sisters" is a charming restaurant worth visiting.

to go with my meal; and made-my-own with all fresh
vegetables and my choice of three homemade salad
dressings. My companion ordered the soup of the day
— a homemade, thick seafood chowder.
Owner Jean Wolfgram has been making food her
hobby for many years: she majored in food science in
college and taught it at Cubberley High School for
eight years. Wolfgram is the "Two Sisters" gourmet
and mastermind; she personally trains all of her chefs
and is responsible for the many crepe combinations
by which I was so tempted. The eight varieties I didn't
get to try are stuffed with every delicacy imaginable:
ratatouille, spinach with cheeses, chicken, beef with
tomatoes, fresh salmon with hollandaise, scallops
with shrimp, and so on. The non-crepe dinner entrees
also feature a variety of seafood and meat dishes, all in

the "country French" tradition.
To accompany our meal, we tried a half liter of the
house Chablis ($3.75) and found it very heavy for a
white wine. We then ordered a half liter of 1979
Rutherford Hill Chardonnay (a special) from the Napa
Valley ($5). I would recommend splurging on some
thing from the wine list rather than drinking the
house wine; for a little more money, we got a far su
perior wine.
Even after a filling dinner, the dessert list at "Two
Sisters" can still make your mouth water. The selec
tions are all delectable, with names like Jamaican
Pleasure, Mocha Surprise and Fantasy Fudge Crepe
($3 each), all filled with various combinations of ice
creams, sauces and whipped cream. Or you can try
Chocolate Mousse, a cheesecake crepe, or even
Crepes Suzette ($3.50) — two royal crepes of Coin
treau and orange butter served flaming at your table.
If your appetite is calling for something a little less
challenging, you can order a Mini Pleasure ($1.75)
which is any of the ice cream combinations served as a
sundae ("You design your own little dessert").
And for specialty coffee lovers, "Two Sisters" will
send you home with a tasty nightcap. You have your
choice of Irish Coffee, Athenian Coffee (with amaret
to), Empress Coffee (with Cream de Cacao), or the
more unusual Tuaca Coffee (with a semi-sweet li
queur from Italy).
Whether you're looking for a special lunch, Sunday
brunch, a quiet dinner or an unusual dessert treat,
"Two Sisters" is a charming restaurant worth visiting.

TWO SISTERS — Country French Cuisine
355 State Street
Los Altos
941-2782
Once upon a time, a Stanford student returned
from the Tours campus and decided to open a French
restaurant in Los Altos; she enlisted the help of her sis
ter, and "Two Sisters" was born.
Now owned by Jean Wolfgram, "Two Sisters" is lo
cated in the peaceful downtown shopping area of Los
Altos, and the restaurant mirrors this peacefulness
even on busy nights. The atmosphere is both cheerful
and intimate; sectioned-off dining areas are deco
rated with French posters, plants and some country
side objects, and there is quiet music playing in the
background. Customers here are dressed casually as
well as formally.
If you've never tried crepes before, this is a great
place to start; the nine different crepe choices are
sure to appeal to crepe gourmets as well. And if you
aren't in the mood for crepes, "Two Sisters" has a di
verse offering of six non-crepe entrees, two quiche
dinners, or a choice of six dinner-size salads.
We decided to be courageous and arrived without
a reservation, spur-of-the-moment style, at 8 p.m. on
a Friday. Although we were told the place wasfull and
we would have a 10- to 15-minute wait, we were sur
prised to find ourselves seated after only 5 minutes —
before we even received our cocktails.
French bread and real butter were brought to our
table as soon as we were seated. I must say I was
pleased to find the butter was soft and spreadable; I

have never understood why butter is served on ice in
so many fancy restaurants — you always end up tear
ing your bread to shreds trying to spread an iced pat
of butter on it. Thank you, "Two Sisters/' for bucking
tradition!
My companion ordered one of the dinner entrees,
Filet of Beef Bearnaise ($9), a cut of top sirloin in tar
ragon sauce that was very tender and well-prepared.
As with the other dinners, it was served with rice pilaf,
vegetables, and a choice of soup or the make-your
own salad bar. I had a terrible time deciding which
crepe to try, and asked our waitress for recommenda
tions. She was friendly and helpful, and I finally de
cided on the Paysanne Stroganoff ($7.50), a crepe
filled with slices of top sirloin, mushrooms and on
ions, and covered with a sour cream and sherry sauce.
