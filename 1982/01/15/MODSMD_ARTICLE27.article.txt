An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris. The plot is featherweight in
the best boy-meets-girl tradition,
but it does what it's intended to
do: it gives an excuse for a series
of numbers built around George
Gershwin tunes. Minnelli's eye
for color and movement was nev
er more assured than here. This is
a Paris conceived on the sound
stage and brought to life through
song and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
Singin'in the Rain.
— Jim Mattson
Singin' in the Rain****
Fox, Redwood City
Singin' in the Rain is the
Hamlet of musicals. It's a virtually
perfect movie. The script, by Bet
ty Comden and Adolph Green, is
funny and tight — it's also his
torically accurate in its telling of
the troubles that beset the mov
ies when they learned to talk. The
music, by Arthur Freed and Nacio
Herb Brown, is wonderful — the
songs include "You are My Lucky
Star," "Broadway Rhythm,"
"Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Sup
poses" (a great nonsense lyric
which starts out "Moses supposes
his toeses are roses but Moses
supposes erroneously"), and, of
course, the title tune. And the
performers are splendid. Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor
dance and sing a lot; Debbie Rey
nold sings quite a bitanddancesa
little; Cyd Charisse just dances;
and Jean Hagen plays Lena La
mont, a screen star who can't
sing, can't dance, and can't act.
Lena Lamont's awful, and
Hagen's marvelous.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
An American in Paris.

Pennies from Heaven****
Guild, Menlo Park
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s. This is a mov
ie of incredible emotional in
tensity, written by Dennis Potter
and shot and designed in the style
of Edward Hopper.
— Steve Vineberg
The Woman Next Door** 1 /:
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a
house next door to Bernard's.

This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
clinches — it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

Modern Problems ★
Old Milt, Mountain View
There's a funny opening scene
in which zonked-out air traffic
controllers bungle their way
through a busy afternoon, and a
takeoff on Manhattan that has
Dabney Coleman as a self-impor
tant pop psychologist reciting a
list of his favorite things into a
tape recorder. Couldn't three
writers — Tom Sherohman,
Arthur Sellers, and the director,
Ken Shapiro — think of more
than two funny ideas? A very bad
comedy, starring that unsurpris
ing comedian Chevy Chase, Patti
D'Arbanville and with Nell Carter
in the most offensively conceived
conceived role for a black per
former in many years.
— S.V.
Absence of Malice **V2
Old Mill, Mountain View
Visually, Sidney Pollock's mov
ie is flat and conventional, and
Kurt Luedtke's script, an indict
ment of irresponsible journalism
and incidious methods of crimi
nal investigation, lacks punch,
too. The story is plausible, but the
filmmakers don't ask us to weigh
the issues: they've already de
cided who's to blame and how
the characters should have be
haved. As the journalist, Sally
Field gives a bland, unnuanced
performance. The movie's only
real substance is Paul Newman's
acting in the role of the man un
fairly implicated in the disap
pearance of a union leader.

Key Largo **
Festival, Palo Alto
Bogart and Bacall star in a film
that tries to be noir but ends up
being only claustrophobic.
Bogart, back from the war, ap
pears at a hotel in the Florida Keys
run by the wife (Bacall) of a dead
Army buddy, only to find it taken
over by Johnny Rocco (Edward G.
Robinson) and his gang, the most
neurotic bunch of toughseveras
sembled. Bogart takes an uncons
cionably long time saving the
day; the monotony is broken up
by a number of killings and a
howling typhoon. Also stars
Lionel Barrymore and Elisha
Cook Jr.
Plays with Brother Orchid.

Rollover *
Palo Alto Square
Jane Fonda produced and Alan
Pakula directed this "interna
tional" thriller. It's bad in unex
pected ways — I don't think I've
ever seen a movie vary in tone so
much from scene toscene. Some
times it's a brittle love story about
a wealthy widow (Fonda) and her
financier lover (Kris Kristof
ferson), and sometimes it's a tale
of shady bank dealings which
threaten to devastate the world
economy. When an attempt is
made to bring the two plots to
gether at the end in a bizarre hap
py postscript to a disaster movie
climax, the movie self-destructs.
It's like trying to make change
from a quarter by blasting it with
a shotgun.

Raiders af the Lost Ark**
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center, For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie. y

Fox, Redwood City
I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the

only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston as a
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill
ing to give up any method of
making life more comfortable.
Double-billed next Thursday
with Arthur.

Montenegro
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan (Golden Girl) Anspach
stars in this pointless Swedish
production about a frustrated
housewife who takes up with a
band of free-loving Yugoslavs
who strive to show her how life
should really be lived. She's too
messed up to go for it, and so's
the movie. Montenegro, in case
you're wondering, is the name of
the Yugoslav she has an.affair
with. No, I don't know why they
named the movie after him. (For
weeks I thought this was a movie
about a Caribbean resort. It looks
like I was right, though — Mon
tenegro is the name of the place
that movies go when they die.)
— J.M.
Arthur ***
Fox, Redwood City
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon

us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Fox, Redwood City
Brian de Palma, who directed
1980's Dressed to Kill, here
proves once again that he's an in
spired technician, a lousy
screenwriter, and totally ob
livious to concepts like com
passion or taste. I wouldn't call
him a misogynist, as many have —
misanthrope is a better word: he
doesn't betray any affection even
from those he's stealing from.
John Travolta, who's quite good,
stars as a sound technician in
search of the perfect scream;
Nancy Allen plays the woman
whose life he accidentally saves.
Things whip themselves up into a
fine post-Watergate frenzy
before fizzling out at the end.
The impressive cinematography
is by Vilmos Zsigmond.
Double-billed with Eyewitness
tonight and tomorrow.

An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.

An American Werewolf in
London *•
Saturday, Cubberley
David Naughton and Griffin
Dunne give pleasing per
formances as a pair of Jewish boys
from Long Island whose friendly

werewolf attack turns Naughton
into the next werewolf gener
ation and Jack into the undead.
John Landis' movie is cheerfully
adolescent, but whenever he has
to focus on the horror film plot,
he loses his style. The picture is a
series of gags, some of the
moronic, a number of them clev

John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd
star in a tiresome film version of
the Thomas Berger novel, a
bewildering mix of suburban
Kafka and slapstick silliness. Larry
Gelbart, who wrote the script,
must have thought he was writing
a black comedy about a middle
class schlemiel (Belushi) whose
quiet, dead end lane is invaded
by a pair of unrestrainable luna
tics (Aykroyd and Kathy Moriar
ty), but the indignities Belushi
suffers are more aggravating than
horrific. Director John G.
Avildsen's notion of style seems
to be to keep everyone bottled
up — the worst possible ap
proach to this kind of material.

The Woman Next Door** 1 /:
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a
house next door to Bernard's.

This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
clinches — it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

Visually, Sidney Pollock's mov

Kurt Luedtke's script, an indict

filmmakers don't ask us to weigh
the issues: they've already de
cided who's to blame and how
the characters should have be

Raiders af the Lost Ark**
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center, For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie. y

I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the

only performance worth watch

messed up to go for it, and so's
the movie. Montenegro, in case
you're wondering, is the name of
the Yugoslav she has an.affair

named the movie after him. (For

Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,

more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon

us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when

him a misogynist, as many have —
misanthrope is a better word: he

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris. The plot is featherweight in
the best boy-meets-girl tradition,
but it does what it's intended to
do: it gives an excuse for a series
of numbers built around George
Gershwin tunes. Minnelli's eye
for color and movement was nev
er more assured than here. This is
a Paris conceived on the sound
stage and brought to life through
song and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.

Singin' in the Rain****

Singin' in the Rain is the

funny and tight — it's also his
torically accurate in its telling of
the troubles that beset the mov
ies when they learned to talk. The
music, by Arthur Freed and Nacio
Herb Brown, is wonderful — the
songs include "You are My Lucky
Star," "Broadway Rhythm,"
"Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Sup
poses" (a great nonsense lyric
which starts out "Moses supposes
his toeses are roses but Moses
supposes erroneously"), and, of
course, the title tune. And the
performers are splendid. Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor
dance and sing a lot; Debbie Rey
nold sings quite a bitanddancesa
little; Cyd Charisse just dances;
and Jean Hagen plays Lena La

A great movie musical — per

The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,

stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu

they mouth popular songs of the

in all directions from Busby

Raiders af the Lost Ark**
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center, For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie. y

I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the

only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston as a
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill
ing to give up any method of
making life more comfortable.

Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan (Golden Girl) Anspach
stars in this pointless Swedish
production about a frustrated
housewife who takes up with a
band of free-loving Yugoslavs
who strive to show her how life
should really be lived. She's too
messed up to go for it, and so's
the movie. Montenegro, in case
you're wondering, is the name of
the Yugoslav she has an.affair
with. No, I don't know why they
named the movie after him. (For
weeks I thought this was a movie
about a Caribbean resort. It looks
like I was right, though — Mon

Fox, Redwood City
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warped enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon

us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.

Brian de Palma, who directed

him a misogynist, as many have —
misanthrope is a better word: he
doesn't betray any affection even
from those he's stealing from.
John Travolta, who's quite good,
stars as a sound technician in

Nancy Allen plays the woman
whose life he accidentally saves.
Things whip themselves up into a

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris. The plot is featherweight in
the best boy-meets-girl tradition,
but it does what it's intended to
do: it gives an excuse for a series
of numbers built around George
Gershwin tunes. Minnelli's eye
for color and movement was nev
er more assured than here. This is
a Paris conceived on the sound
stage and brought to life through
song and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.

Singin' in the Rain****
Fox, Redwood City
Singin' in the Rain is the
Hamlet of musicals. It's a virtually
perfect movie. The script, by Bet

funny and tight — it's also his
torically accurate in its telling of
the troubles that beset the mov
ies when they learned to talk. The
music, by Arthur Freed and Nacio
Herb Brown, is wonderful — the
songs include "You are My Lucky
Star," "Broadway Rhythm,"
"Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Sup
poses" (a great nonsense lyric
which starts out "Moses supposes
his toeses are roses but Moses
supposes erroneously"), and, of
course, the title tune. And the
performers are splendid. Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor
dance and sing a lot; Debbie Rey
nold sings quite a bitanddancesa
little; Cyd Charisse just dances;
and Jean Hagen plays Lena La
mont, a screen star who can't
sing, can't dance, and can't act.
Lena Lamont's awful, and

Pennies from Heaven****
Guild, Menlo Park
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and

ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s. This is a mov

Aquarius, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)

when fate moves Mathilde into a

This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in

of high spots and yet never quite
clinches — it's more the promise

proves once again that he's an in

him a misogynist, as many have —
misanthrope is a better word: he

An American in Paris ****
Fox, Redwood City
The team of director Vincente
Minnelli, producer Arthur Freed
and studio Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer produced some great mu
sicals, including The Band Wag
on, The Pirate, and the most
lavish of them all, An American in
Paris. The plot is featherweight in
the best boy-meets-girl tradition,
but it does what it's intended to
do: it gives an excuse for a series
of numbers built around George
Gershwin tunes. Minnelli's eye
for color and movement was nev
er more assured than here. This is
a Paris conceived on the sound
stage and brought to life through
song and dance.
Gene Kelly plays the American
painter in Paris; he gets to sing
and dance to S'Wonderful, Our
Love is Here to Stay, I got
Rhythm, and many others. Leslie
Caron plays the French woman
the American painter falls for;
Oscar Levant (who, in a fantasy
number, plays the Concerto in F
before an enthusiastic audience
composed of his own doubles)
plays his best friend; and Georges
Guetary, who gets to sing I'll
Build a Stairway to Paradise, plays
the painter's rival in love.

Singin' in the Rain****
Fox, Redwood City
Singin' in the Rain is the
Hamlet of musicals. It's a virtually
perfect movie. The script, by Bet
ty Comden and Adolph Green, is
funny and tight — it's also his
torically accurate in its telling of
the troubles that beset the mov
ies when they learned to talk. The
music, by Arthur Freed and Nacio
Herb Brown, is wonderful — the
songs include "You are My Lucky
Star," "Broadway Rhythm,"
"Make 'Em Laugh," "Moses Sup
poses" (a great nonsense lyric
which starts out "Moses supposes
his toeses are roses but Moses
supposes erroneously"), and, of
course, the title tune. And the
performers are splendid. Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor
dance and sing a lot; Debbie Rey
nold sings quite a bitanddancesa
little; Cyd Charisse just dances;
and Jean Hagen plays Lena La
mont, a screen star who can't
sing, can't dance, and can't act.
Lena Lamont's awful, and

Pennies from Heaven****
Guild, Menlo Park
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s. This is a mov
ie of incredible emotional in
tensity, written by Dennis Potter

of Edward Hopper.

The Woman Next Door** 1 /:
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a
house next door to Bernard's.

This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
clinches — it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

Raiders af the Lost Ark**
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad

represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (laws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center, For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a

producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core

up — the worst possible ap
proach to this kind of material.
