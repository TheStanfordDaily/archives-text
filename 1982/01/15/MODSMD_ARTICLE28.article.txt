Searches continue in jetliner crash
Washington — Divers plunged into the frozen
Potomac yesterday, searching for 70 bodies in a
crumpled Air Florida jetliner which investigators sus
pect was heavy with ice when it fell upon a bridge
loaded with rush-hour motorists.
The crumpled fuselage of the Boeing 737 lay a mere
20 feet from the river bank and 25 feet from the sur
face, but it proved tragically difficult to bring up.
Investigators focused on how ready the plane was
to take off in subfreezing weather Wednesday — how
long it stood on the runway, whether it was properly
deiced and what caused it to slam into the 14th Street
Bridge within seconds of liftoff Wednesday from Na
tional Airport.
Chief investigator Francis McAdams said it could
take three days to as long as two weeks to raise the
100,000-pound fuselage.
A study of the airplane's past troubles, which a top
FAA analyst termed "not unusual," was turned over
to officials of the National Transportation Safety
Board as they sought clues to the cause of the crash.
Meanwhile, accident investigators said that re
covery of two orange-colored boxes about the size of
large briefcases would be critical to determining what
caused the tragedy.
The waterproof steel boxes, located in the tail sec
tion of the Boeing jet, record conversations in the
cockpit as well as details of the aircraft's altitude, ac
celeration and engine performance.
The frozen bodies of an infant and a woman were
pulled by boat crews from the river, bringing to nine
the number of bodies in the morgue. Air Florida said
its Boeing 737 carried 79 people, leaving 70 still to be
pulled from the river. Four passengers and a stew
ardess were the only known survivors.
Two men in cars on the bridge were killed and
three other commuters were seriously injured in the
first fatal American airline accident since Oct. 31,
1979, when a Western airlines plane crashed in Mexi
co City.
President Ronald Reagan circled the crash site yes
terday in a helicopter, then flew by plane to New York
City where he told an audience of business leaders
that modern-day heroism still exists.
He described the bravery of one of the passengers:
"The helicopter pilot tells of him. He was one of the
group that was clinging to the wreckage out there in
the icy waters. Time after time ... the life ring (from
the helicopter) came to him and each time time he
picked out someone else and worked to get the ring
around them."
The president added, "Four people are alive today
because he did this. We don't know who he is be
cause he gave his life in doing that. He sank beneath
the waves before it could come back for him ...
Greater glory hath no man."
Reagan says recession not his fault
New York— President Ronald Reagan pronounced
himself blameless yesterday for the recession, saying
"our administration is a cleanup crew for those who
wenf on a non-stop binge and left the tab for us to
pick up."
Reagan's assertion to 1600 business and civic lead
ers came six days after his spokesman contended the
recession actually began while President Jimmy
Carter was still in office, then admitted he was wrong.
Reagan, who promised the recession would end
"faster than expected," sandwiched his economic re
marks between calls for the private sector to volun
tarily take over some of the social services long per
formed by government. That, for Reagan, has been a
longstanding theme, but it has yet to catch fire across
the nation.
But Reagan made clear that he hopes the group he
addressed, called the New York City Partnership, will
serve as a model of things to come. The coalition of
civic and business leaders, headed by former Chase
Manhattan Bank Chairman David Rockefeller, is

privately sponsoring nearly 14,000 jobs for disadvan
taged youth.
"You are that tough little tug that can pull our ship
of state off the shoals and out into open water," he
told his audience. "You believe private-sector in
itiatives are essential to economic and social progress.
So do all of us in our administration."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes told re
porters Jan. 8 that the recession began in July 1980,
during Carter's term. Speakes said he received his in
formation from the National Bureau of Economic Re
search. Minutes later, aides handed Speakes a note
that corrected the date to July 1981 — the middle of
Reagan's first year in office.
But Reagan said unspecified "big spenders" were
to blame for economic woes, even though he's been
at the helm for nearly a year.
With unemployment at a near-record 8.9 percent
and federal deficits soaring, Reagan again defended
his economic program of huge tax and spending cuts
and promised they would eventually bring relief. At
the same time, he issued a thinly disguised attack on
Democrats.
Haig expects Palestine agreement
Jerusalem — Secretary of State Alexander Haig told
Israel and Egypt yesterday that the Reagan adminis
tration wants them to break their deadlock on Palesti
nian autonomy and work out an agreement before
April.
A senior U.S. official said Haig was pushing Israel
and Egypt toward "a major effort" which they are re
luctant to make.
"We don't share their judgment that it's best to
wait," he told reporters during the flight from Cairo
to Israel. He requested anonymity.
April 25 is the date on which Israel is to withdraw
from the eastern Sinai Desert, restoring the entire
peninsula to Egyptian rule.
Haig met with Prime Minister Menachem Begin af
ter conferring with Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir
and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon and questioning
them closely on what shape Palestinian self-rule in the
West Bank of the Jordan and Gaza Strip will take.
An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, briefing re
porters on the Haig-Shamir talk, said while Haig was
careful not to set a deadline, "he said it would be a
good thing to get an agreement before April.
"If we can reach an agreement before April, fine,"
said the official, who requested anonymity. "If we
can't get an agreement before April, we will try to get
one later on."
Haig, the official said, fired off a long list of ques
tions at Shamir, beginning with the issue of whether
Jerusalem Arabs will be included in the autonomous
area and going on to problems like who will control
West Bank and Gaza land and water resources.
On whether Jerusalem Arabs could vote for the au
tonomous bodies he got a flat "no" from Shamir, who
said Israel regards the Arab sector of the city as Israel's
sovereign territory outside the area to become self
governing, Israeli media reports said. The replies to
Haig's other questions were not reported.
From Sharon, Haig wanted to know how the Israeli
army would deploy in the autonomous areas and
what type of police would handle internal security,
the reports said.
Price hikes may bring protests
Warsaw — Poland's martial law authorities in
dicated concern yesterday that huge price increases
planned for food, services, and consumer goods may
spark new protests.
The public indications were confirmed privately by
a well-informed Communist Party source who said
that the price hikes are planned for about Feb. 1 and
thatthe government is worried that they could leadto
mass demonstrations by Polish women.
"Even riot police are apprehensive to crack the
heads of hysterical women," the source said.

Meanwhile, both the Army daily Soldier of Free
dom and a new government newspaper that ap
peared for the first time yesterday, Polish Republic,
reported that an explosion had destroyed a tele
phone booth neartheCommunist Party headquarters
in downtown Warsaw. The blast also shattered win
dows in a nearby cafe and in two parked cars, the
newspapers quoted a Warsaw police spokesman as
saying. The cause of the explosion, which occured
Wednesday, was under investigation.
The report of the explosion was overshadowed in
the Polish media by articles and broadcasts aimed at
convincing the public that coming price increases are
inevitable, an economic necessity, and that they will
be offset for the poorest Poles by wage increases.
The government published proposed price in
creases earlier that showed hikes of 300 percent to 500
percent on many foods and increases of 200 percent
to 300 percent for essential utilities.
Reagan for reversing ERA ruling
Washington — The Reagan administration sug
gested yesterday that the Supreme Court consider
wiping out on technical grounds a ruling that throws a
legal cloud over a final push to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment.
Justice Department lawyers at the same time did
not give up their previously stated opposition to
quick Supreme Court review of the substance of the
ruling.
While contending that it would be improper to
consider, at this point, the constitutional issues de
cided Dec. 23 by a federal judge in Idaho, the Justice
Department said it did not oppose expedited con
sideration of whether the judge should have issued a
ruling in the first place.
The National Organization for Women has asked
the Supreme Court for a quick ruling on those con
stitutional issues lest the approach of the June 30
deadline for ratifying the ERA make ratification im
possible.
If the Supreme Court follows the Justice Depart
ment suggestion, it could set aside U.S. District Judge
Marion Callister's ruling within a few weeks, perhaps
sooner.
Callister ruled that Congress acted unconstitu
tionally when itextended theoriginal ERA ratification
deadline of March 22,1979 and that five state legisla
tures could validly rescind previous votes to ratify the
amendment.
If those recission votes are invalid, 35 of the re
quired 38 states have ratified the measure that would
add a 27th amendment to the Constitution banning
discrimination based on sex.
NOW is in the midst of a multi-million dollar cam
paign aimed at obtaining ratification votes in three
more state legislatures. Callister's ruling, although it
allowed the ratification process to continue, is viewed
by ERA backers as a major psychological stumbling
block.
Storms and record cold continue
Chicago — A "potentially dangerous" new storm
hit the Midwest yesterday, plunging temperatures
back below zero, while the South reeled under a third
straight day of snow and ice that coated highways and
power lines. Since Saturday, 189 deaths have been
blamed on the weather.
The snowstorm that pelted parts of the South with
the highest accumulations in nearly a half-century
soon will assault the East Coast states.
Traffic was hazardous from Texas to New England,
and scattered power outages were reported across
the Deep South as the snow moved north.
In Alabama, 750,000 people — nearly a fourth of the
state's people — were powerless after snow
burdened tree limbs snapped power lines.
Low temperature records were set yesterday in
Minnesota, Michigan and Texas, and forecasters said
there was no end in sight.

U.S. blocking Soviet gas pipeline
Bonn, West Germany— By blocking the export of
specialized parts made by General Electric, the Unit
ed States appears to have blocked — at least tem
porarily — the multibillion-dollar natural gas pipeline
construction project between the Soviet Union and
Western Europe.
The pipeline project, viewed as extremely impor
tant by Western European governments, has been re
garded skeptically by U.S. officials from its inception,
even before the Reagan administration decided to
impose sanctions on the Soviet Union in response to
the declaration of martial law in Poland.
Two possible substitutes for GE's participation,
both involving a switch to European manufacturers,
have been cited by industry experts. The alternatives,
however, present a number of uncertainties and risks
for the project and would also make it difficult for Eu
ropean governments to hold firm on their pledge not
to allow moves that would undercut U.S. sanctions.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, whose
country has a major share in financing and building
the pipeline and has contracted to receive a quarter
of the annual 40 billion cubic meters of gas due to start
flowing in 1984, said in Washington last week that he
remained firmly in favor of the deal.
French and Italian officials have sounded some
what less definite, indicating that they would review
their planned participation in the $15 billion project.
But all six of the West European nations initially in
volved in the deal eventually are expected to go
ahead with it.
Stocks 'jittery/ manage weak rise
New York — Stock prices crept upward yesterday
after a mauling earlier in the week, sparked by a
strengthening in oil, drug and financial issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.33 to
842.28, an improvement from the first three days of
the week when it fell a total 27.58 points. The index
still is at its lowest level since Oct. 29 when it was
838.95.
Today's weather
Widespread fog through tomorrow, clearing to
hazy sunshine in the afternoon. Lows in the 30s to mid
40s. Highs will be in the upper 40s to 50s. Light winds.
