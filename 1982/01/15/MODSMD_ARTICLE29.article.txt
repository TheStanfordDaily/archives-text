Corrections
Revenues from Escondido rents remain within the
residence system and do not go into the University's
general fund, as was reported yesterday. Also, Theta
Chi fraternity does not have female members, al
though women do live in the Theta Chi house. The
Daily regrets the errors.
Earnings
Uncle Andrew says W-2 earning statements can be
picked up from Martha on the Biz Side from now until
Friday, Jan. 22. If you don't pick yours up, it will be
mailed home â€” "home home," as the Uncle puts it.
Photogs
Before not getting work done a bit later (see
below), all photographers should meet at the office
today at 3:00 to get some work done while meeting
with Artie and jae.
Happy hour(s)
All staffers: the Daily happy hour you have come to
know and love will give an encore performance today
at 5:00 at the office. Good people, good food (well,
close enough), and plenty of good extras. 'Nuff said?
