# Teller, Drell clash over national defense
## 
### Dan Labov 
Proposed changes in the na
tion's defense system were the
subject which sparked heated dis
agreement in a debate between
Edward Teller, Hoover Institution
senior fellow, and Dr. Sidney
Drell, deputy director of the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), yesterday in Branner Hall.
During the debate, Teller and
Drell addressed the question of
whether NATO allies should
deploy theatre nuclear weapons
in Western Europe.
Freshmen Claude Millman (sid
ing with Drell) and Debby
Swenson (siding with Teller) also
participated in the debate. Both
teams criticized the current de
fense strategy but advocated
widely different solutions.
Claiming he was privy to classi
fied information which would

serve to substantiate his view,
Teller said he advocated the land
based deployment of new nuclear
weapons — neutron bombs — in
Western Europe as opposed to
Drell's proposal of modernization
of existing weapons and their
placement on submarines.
Teller argued that missiles at sea
are "not survivable .... It's very
probable subs can be destroyed.."
He told Drell, "You don't realize
how much you don't know. A lot
of secrets are so well kept you
don't even know they exist.
"I know a lot of highly classified
information of which I'm not al
lowed to breathe a word .... A lot
of wrong, confusing statements
have been made, not by bad in
tentions but because secrecy bad
ly confused the issue."
Drell interjected during Teller's
speech, saying, "That's just not a

fair and honest statement, Ed
ward."
After the debate Drell told
Teller, "I happen to know the
basis for the technical work just as
well as you do," and accused him
of unethical debate tactics.
Teller began his presentation
saying that although NATO has
many weapons in Western Eu
rope, they are mostly obsolete
and are highly concentrated —
therefore an easy target for the
Soviets..
Teller maintained that unless
changes were implemented, the
Soviets would win in a nuclear
war. He advocated two proposals
to upgrade NATO defense. The
first calls for redistribution of all
nuclear weapons "into the hands
of those who would use them."

Danger is reduced, he said, by a
system whereby the bombs would
only be activiated upon receipt of
signals from more than one high
ranking source.
Teller's second proposal ad
vocated the production and
deployment of 50- to 100-ton neu
tron bombs.
Drell said he believes the only
possible role of nuclear weapons
is that of deterrence. He said he
opposes all offensive use. His defi
nition, unlike Teller's, includes
any nuclear response to a conven
tional force attack.
Drell said, however, that the
only alternatives available in the
case of a conventional attack by
the Soviets are to surtender or to
begin a full-scale nuclear war —
"a prospect which terrifies me."


TELLER DEBATES DRELL — In a debate held in the Branner Lounge
yesterday, Hoover Senior Research Fellow Edward Teller sup
ported the deployment of land-based nuclear weapons in Western
Europe, opposing SLAC Director Sidney Drell's call for the mod
ernization of existing weapons and their placement on submarines.
Teller claimed he possessed "highly classified information" indicat
ing that missies at sea may be destroyed.
