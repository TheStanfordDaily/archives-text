# Registration 'grace period' extended
## 
### 
by The Washington Post
Washington — Despite President Ronald Rea
gan's order last week that draft registration for 18-
year-old males be continued indefinitely, the Jus
tice Department will not begin before March its
prosecution of young men who have not regis
tered.
"Our objective is not to prosecute; our objec
tive is to get people to comply with the law," said
Maj. Gen. Thomas Turnage, director of the Selec
tive Service System. "We therefore think this grace
period for people who have not registered should
be extended to the end of February."
Justice Department sources confirmed confer
ring with Selective Service officials about extend
ing the grace period, in part to give non-registrants
a chance to sign up and in part because the Justice
Department is reluctant to start prosecution pro
ceedings against more than 800,000 young Ameri
cans.
"We think there are as many as 1 million who
have not registered," said David Landau, legisla
tive counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLLJ). "This would make it the largest single
mass resistance to a law in this country since Pro
hibition in the 19205."
The Selective Service System says 6.6 million
young men have registered for the draft since July
1980, when former President Jimmy Carter re
sumed the draft registration process that former
President Gerald Ford suspended in 1975. Selective
Service said it does not know how many have regis
tered since Reagan's order last week.
"We're talking about a process where 35,000
post offices around the country send us their regis
trant forms periodically," Turnage said. "The
forms then go to Chicago where they're compiled
by computer and then sent to us. It will be a while
before we know how the president's message has
been received."

According to organizers of resistance to the
draft, the president's announcement of continued
compulsory draft registration will have little im
pact on the nation's young men.
"Carter resumed registration when the Russians
invaded Afghanistan. Now Reagan keeps it be
cause he thinks that if he ends it he'd send the
wrongsignalstothe Russiansabout Poland," Land
au said. "This is a feeble attempt to justify draft reg
istration."
Barry Lynn, president of the anti-registration
group Draft Action, said, "The size and scope of
this protest among the young men of America sur
prises me. I never expected it would be this big."
Neither did the Selective Service System, which
nevertheless downplays the estimate of 1 million
non-registrants used by the ACLU and Draft Ac
tion. Turnage said, "We have the figures, they
don't. I don't believe their figures. If they have
something we don't have, I wish they'd give it to
us."
Whatever the numbers, they still comprise the
lowest compliance rate in the history of Selective
Service. Almost as worrisome as the 800,000 or
more who have not registered are the numbers
who have registered but have moved and not
notified Selective Service of their address change.
Not only is non-registration a felony punishable
by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, it is
also a felony not to notify Selective Service of a
change of address. So far, 1 million of the 6.6 mil
lion registrants have told the Selective Service they
have moved. This is far below the number of peo
ple in the 18-to-20 age bracket who might be ex
pected to move.
"We've had moving notices from 15 percent of
our registrant population and the Census Bureau
tells us we should expect 25 percent to move," said
Joan Lamb, Selective Service public affairs officer.

"This concerns us enough that we are about to
start a verification procedure to make sure our reg
istrants still live where they said they did."
Emotions run high among people resisting draft
registration. Forms have been burned outside post
offices, rallies have been held at colleges and
threats have been made to public personalities
who support draft registration.
"There is a lot of anger involved here because
these kids feel the draft is irrelevant, an imposition
in their lives they don't comprehend," says Dr.
Steven Pieczinik, a psychiatrist in Washington who
studied draft evasion during the Vietnam War.
"The kids today don't want to get into anything
they feel is irrelevant to their career lives. The con
cepts of ideology and loyalty are very foreign to
them, and they don't understand why they have to
spend two years of their lives where they might get
killed for something that has no meaning to
them."
Inside the Reagan administration, mixed feel
ings are reported about when to prosecute non
registrants, whom to prosecute, and even whether
to prosecute at all. One Justice Department source
said it would strain the department's budget to
prosecute more than a handful and would be im
possible to prosecute 800,000.
"It cost as much as $25,000 a case when the de
partment was prosecuting deserters and draft
evaders during the Vietnam War," the source said.
"It might cost more to pursue the non-registrant
cases."
Draft-resister organizations say they were told
that the department was preparing eases last De
cember against as many as 40 men who publicly ac
knowledged that they had not registered, and had
sent letters of warning to as many as 183 who had
not registered.

change of address. So far, 1 million of the 6.6 mil
lion registrants have told the Selective Service they
have moved. This is far below the number of peo
ple in the 18-to-20 age bracket who might be ex
pected to move.
"We've had moving notices from 15 percent of
our registrant population and the Census Bureau
tells us we should expect 25 percent to move," said
Joan Lamb, Selective Service public affairs officer.

"This concerns us enough that we are about to
start a verification procedure to make sure our reg
istrants still live where they said they did."
Emotions run high among people resisting draft
registration. Forms have been burned outside post
offices, rallies have been held at colleges and
threats have been made to public personalities
who support draft registration.
"There is a lot of anger involved here because
these kids feel the draft is irrelevant, an imposition
in their lives they don't comprehend," says Dr.
Steven Pieczinik, a psychiatrist in Washington who
studied draft evasion during the Vietnam War.
"The kids today don't want to get into anything
they feel is irrelevant to their career lives. The con
cepts of ideology and loyalty are very foreign to
them, and they don't understand why they have to
spend two years of their lives where they might get
killed for something that has no meaning to
them."
Inside the Reagan administration, mixed feel
ings are reported about when to prosecute non
registrants, whom to prosecute, and even whether
to prosecute at all. One Justice Department source
said it would strain the department's budget to
prosecute more than a handful and would be im
possible to prosecute 800,000.
"It cost as much as $25,000 a case when the de
partment was prosecuting deserters and draft
evaders during the Vietnam War," the source said.
"It might cost more to pursue the non-registrant
cases."
Draft-resister organizations say they were told
that the department was preparing eases last De
cember against as many as 40 men who publicly ac
knowledged that they had not registered, and had
sent letters of warning to as many as 183 who had
not registered.

STUDENTS PROTEST REGISTRATION — The day following former
President Jimmy Carter's announcement in January 1980 of his
plans to impose registration, students gathered at a rally in White
Plaza to show their concern. At least 800,000 registration-age men
have not registered, according to Selective Service figures, while
the American Civil Liberties Union claims the figure is 1 million.
by The Washington Post
Washington — Despite President Ronald Rea
gan's order last week that draft registration for 18-
year-old males be continued indefinitely, the Jus
tice Department will not begin before March its
prosecution of young men who have not regis
tered.
"Our objective is not to prosecute; our objec
tive is to get people to comply with the law," said
Maj. Gen. Thomas Turnage, director of the Selec
tive Service System. "We therefore think this grace
period for people who have not registered should
be extended to the end of February."
Justice Department sources confirmed confer
ring with Selective Service officials about extend
ing the grace period, in part to give non-registrants
a chance to sign up and in part because the Justice
Department is reluctant to start prosecution pro
ceedings against more than 800,000 young Ameri
cans.
"We think there are as many as 1 million who
have not registered," said David Landau, legisla
tive counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLLJ). "This would make it the largest single
mass resistance to a law in this country since Pro
hibition in the 19205."
The Selective Service System says 6.6 million
young men have registered for the draft since July
1980, when former President Jimmy Carter re
sumed the draft registration process that former
President Gerald Ford suspended in 1975. Selective
Service said it does not know how many have regis
tered since Reagan's order last week.
"We're talking about a process where 35,000
post offices around the country send us their regis
trant forms periodically," Turnage said. "The
forms then go to Chicago where they're compiled
by computer and then sent to us. It will be a while
before we know how the president's message has
been received."

According to organizers of resistance to the
draft, the president's announcement of continued
compulsory draft registration will have little im
pact on the nation's young men.
"Carter resumed registration when the Russians
invaded Afghanistan. Now Reagan keeps it be
cause he thinks that if he ends it he'd send the
wrongsignalstothe Russiansabout Poland," Land
au said. "This is a feeble attempt to justify draft reg
istration."
Barry Lynn, president of the anti-registration
group Draft Action, said, "The size and scope of
this protest among the young men of America sur
prises me. I never expected it would be this big."
Neither did the Selective Service System, which
nevertheless downplays the estimate of 1 million
non-registrants used by the ACLU and Draft Ac
tion. Turnage said, "We have the figures, they
don't. I don't believe their figures. If they have
something we don't have, I wish they'd give it to
us."
Whatever the numbers, they still comprise the
lowest compliance rate in the history of Selective
Service. Almost as worrisome as the 800,000 or
more who have not registered are the numbers
who have registered but have moved and not
notified Selective Service of their address change.
Not only is non-registration a felony punishable
by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine, it is
also a felony not to notify Selective Service of a
change of address. So far, 1 million of the 6.6 mil
