## Chinese students face future in dictated state assignments 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — It came like a sentence of death.
"TeacherChi would like to see you to discuss
work assignments," Xiao Li was told. Chi, the
graduating class' political advisor, was very
solicitous and invited Li to sit and have some
tea.
Li recalled, "Then he began talking about
patriotism and serving the motherland, and I
knew the rumor was true — I would be sent
to a border area to work."
For Li, 23, a history student at one of Bei
jing's major universities, this amounts to vir
tual exile in the undeveloped far reaches of
China where the climate is hard, supplies are
short and the cultural level is low. She would
probably be assigned to work as a junior of
ficial in a local government office.
While most Chinese are preparing to cele
brate the lunar new year and what they call
the spring festival later this month, this is a
time of great anxiety for the country's gradu
ating college students, whose first job assign
ments are being decided now.
"I don't know what I will do," Li said. "I
wanted a job in Beijing in the central govern
ment, and I would have been satisfied with
something in a smaller city. But going to the
frontier is like being sent to a labor camp un
til you are lucky enough to die," she said.
A teacher at Beijing's People's University
said, "For many students, this may be their
last spring festival at home." He continued,
"They are very tense, very apprehensive, and
those who already know that they are going

to difficult places are really distraught. Two
students at another school have already at
tempted suicide."
State resources
Those anxieties stem from the inflexible
nature of the Chinese labor system. All ur
ban workers, particularly trained personnel
like college graduates, are regarded as state
resources, to be allocated wherever they are
needed. Although a worker may be moved
from job to job throughout his career, in
practice most remain with the organizations
where they are first assigned.
"It is not like going into the army for two
or three or four years to do national service,"
an engineering student from Qinghua Uni
versity here said. "For us, national service
lasts an entire lifetime, and that means the
first assignment is incredibly important. A
good assignment sets you up for life, and a
bad one can take years to undo, if it ever can
be."
As an electrical engineer graduating near
the top of his class from China's most presti
gious science and engineering school, he
has few worries about his future — in fact, he
is pondering a choice between graduate
studies and going to work immediately in a
defense industry research institute.
He said his job prospect was a "good unit,"
very important for a Chinese. The "working
unit," perhaps a steel plant with as many as
20,000 employees or a small collective en
terprise with only 10, is responsible for its
workers' welfare — their housing, medical

care, food supplies, children's educations
and recreation facilities, virtually everything.
Most of China's graduating college stu
dents hope to be assigned to big, well-fi
nanced units, such as the central govern
ment ministries, large industrial enterprises,
defense plants, top universities and research

"I would go to an undeveloped border
area for three, even five years, but only if I
knew I could return to the capital," said a
Russian-language student, who is hoping for
a job as a technical translator although his
specialty also makes him a prime candidate
for assignment to a military unit along the

institutes that can assure them a good stan
dard of living as well as some prospects of
promotion.
A Chinese-American economist who has
been teaching in Beijing and Shanghai said,
"In the United States, seniors typically look
at the challenge a job offers and, of course,
the pay, and they usually don't mind moving
across the country for a good job. Students
here are quite different, and the last thing
they seem to want is an adventure of any
sort. A good student will try everything to re
main at home and to get a job that locks him
into the bureaucracy for life."
Conservative mood
Students here acknowledge that they are
conservative, attributing that equally to trad
itional Chinese attitudes toward family and
work and to the rigidity of socialism's labor
system.

Sino-Soviet frontier.
The apprehension results from the limited
voice a student has in his assignment and the
requirement that he subordinate himself to
state orders. "We feel quite helpless, as if we
were some sort of educated serfs to be
moved here and there at the state's pleas
ure," a Beijing University student said bitter
ly-
The assignment process began last sum
mer when students filled out forms listing
personal details, desired assignments and
any special family conditions that should be
taken into account, such as being an only
child whose elderly parents may need help.
The requests for new graduates totaled
nearly two million, but China in 1981 had
only 190,000 college graduates and 100,000
graduates from technical institutes.
Asa result, the State Planning Commission
set priorities for the assignment of graduates
in line with overall development goals.
The best students were to go into graduate

work and become teachers. Light industry,
transport, energy and other key economic
sectors were to get priority in the assignment
of scientists, technicians and economists.
'Duty' to serve
Anticipating widespread student reluc
tance to accept certain assignments, the gov
ernment began a propaganda campaign six
months ago to remind the graduates that
they had been educated at state expense and
had opportunities very few young Chinese
have. Only one percent or two percent of
the population is accepted to college or
polytechnical study. Now it was their duty,
they were told, to serve the country.
Those refusing their assignments, gam
bling that China's shortage of trained per
sonnel will bring them something better lat
er, will be barred from state employment for
five years and then will be treated as ordinary
job-seekers, not college graduates eligible
for official appointments, authorities have
recently warned.
Good jobs with prospects for rapid pro
motion can be spotted, however, as they are
usually tagged for Communist Party mem
bers only. This presents a problem of cons
cience to many graduating students who un
til now had regarded party members as hyp
ocrites trying to get ahead through their po
litical connections — and now find them
selves faced with the decision of whether to
do the same.
Strict regulations have been laid down to
stop the widespread bribery that marked the
assignment procedures in previous years.

The best students were to go into graduate

'Duty' to serve
Anticipating widespread student reluc
tance to accept certain assignments, the gov
ernment began a propaganda campaign six
months ago to remind the graduates that
they had been educated at state expense and
had opportunities very few young Chinese
have. Only one percent or two percent of
the population is accepted to college or
polytechnical study. Now it was their duty,
they were told, to serve the country.
Those refusing their assignments, gam
bling that China's shortage of trained per
sonnel will bring them something better lat
er, will be barred from state employment for
five years and then will be treated as ordinary
job-seekers, not college graduates eligible
for official appointments, authorities have
recently warned.
Good jobs with prospects for rapid pro
motion can be spotted, however, as they are
usually tagged for Communist Party mem
bers only. This presents a problem of cons
cience to many graduating students who un
til now had regarded party members as hyp
ocrites trying to get ahead through their po
litical connections — and now find them
selves faced with the decision of whether to
do the same.
Strict regulations have been laid down to
stop the widespread bribery that marked the
assignment procedures in previous years.
Beijing — It came like a sentence of death.
"TeacherChi would like to see you to discuss
work assignments," Xiao Li was told. Chi, the
graduating class' political advisor, was very
solicitous and invited Li to sit and have some
tea.
Li recalled, "Then he began talking about
patriotism and serving the motherland, and I
knew the rumor was true — I would be sent
to a border area to work."
For Li, 23, a history student at one of Bei
jing's major universities, this amounts to vir
tual exile in the undeveloped far reaches of
China where the climate is hard, supplies are
short and the cultural level is low. She would
probably be assigned to work as a junior of
ficial in a local government office.
While most Chinese are preparing to cele
brate the lunar new year and what they call
the spring festival later this month, this is a
time of great anxiety for the country's gradu
ating college students, whose first job assign
ments are being decided now.
"I don't know what I will do," Li said. "I
wanted a job in Beijing in the central govern
ment, and I would have been satisfied with
something in a smaller city. But going to the
frontier is like being sent to a labor camp un
til you are lucky enough to die," she said.
A teacher at Beijing's People's University
said, "For many students, this may be their
last spring festival at home." He continued,
"They are very tense, very apprehensive, and
those who already know that they are going

to difficult places are really distraught. Two
students at another school have already at
tempted suicide."
State resources
Those anxieties stem from the inflexible
nature of the Chinese labor system. All ur
ban workers, particularly trained personnel
like college graduates, are regarded as state
resources, to be allocated wherever they are
needed. Although a worker may be moved
from job to job throughout his career, in
practice most remain with the organizations
where they are first assigned.
"It is not like going into the army for two
or three or four years to do national service,"
an engineering student from Qinghua Uni
versity here said. "For us, national service
lasts an entire lifetime, and that means the
first assignment is incredibly important. A
good assignment sets you up for life, and a
bad one can take years to undo, if it ever can
be."
As an electrical engineer graduating near
the top of his class from China's most presti
gious science and engineering school, he
has few worries about his future — in fact, he
is pondering a choice between graduate
studies and going to work immediately in a
defense industry research institute.
He said his job prospect was a "good unit,"
very important for a Chinese. The "working
unit," perhaps a steel plant with as many as
20,000 employees or a small collective en
terprise with only 10, is responsible for its
workers' welfare — their housing, medical

care, food supplies, children's educations
and recreation facilities, virtually everything.
Most of China's graduating college stu
dents hope to be assigned to big, well-fi
nanced units, such as the central govern
ment ministries, large industrial enterprises,
defense plants, top universities and research

"I would go to an undeveloped border
area for three, even five years, but only if I

Russian-language student, who is hoping for
a job as a technical translator although his
specialty also makes him a prime candidate
for assignment to a military unit along the

institutes that can assure them a good stan
dard of living as well as some prospects of
promotion.
A Chinese-American economist who has
been teaching in Beijing and Shanghai said,
"In the United States, seniors typically look
at the challenge a job offers and, of course,
the pay, and they usually don't mind moving
across the country for a good job. Students
here are quite different, and the last thing
they seem to want is an adventure of any
sort. A good student will try everything to re
main at home and to get a job that locks him
into the bureaucracy for life."

conservative, attributing that equally to trad

system.
