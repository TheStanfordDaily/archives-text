## American women's lifestyles: constant changes over time 
### Katrina Visser 
Harriet Beecher Stowe made the conscious de
cision, 140 years ago, to take control of her own desti
ny and stop bearing children at age 35. Though not
atypical of many women of her generation, she was
still considered a radical to limit her offspring to five.
Today many women choose not to start child
bearing until their 30s, and fewer and fewer women
are making a career out of child-bearing and caretak
ing, according to Katherine Kish Sklar, professor of
history at UCLA, who spoke here Wednesday on
"American Women's Changing Life Cycles,
1800-1980."
Sklar's speech was the first in this quarter's weekly
Jing Lyman Lecture Series. Sponsored by the Center
for Research on Women (CROW), the series focuses
on the theme, "The Ages of Women: A Look at Wom
en's Life Cycle Development."
According to Sklar, the concept of life cycle meas
urement as a way of approaching historical observa
tion was introduced in the 19505, but has an older his
tory in literature and art. The human life cycle from
birth to death can be a convenient organizing princi
ple that allows historians to "examine the interaction
of diverse sectors of human experience, such as fami
ly, work, and politics," said Sklar.
In the history of women, the primary process in this
cycle is reproduction. According to Sklar, this process
ran be broken down into three basic cycles which
have changed dramatically since 1800: the decreasing
number of the drop in maternal and infant death
rates, and the changing ages of women participating
in the paid labor force.
Racial and cultural variations among women in
fluence each cycle.
"Many of these cultural changes have tended to
support or encourage the demographic changes.
Moreover, many of these cultural changes support
the personal autonomy of women .. . increasing the
degrees to which they are able to exist as independ
ent entities," Sklar said.
She distributed a seven-page pamphlet of graphs
and tables to illustrate these changes. The data depict
ing the fertility decline shows the sharpest drop in
birth rates around 1850. This pre-civil war drop con
tradicts the traditional socio-economic position that
birth declines were caused by the migration from ru
ral lifestyles to urban, factory-centered lives after the
Civil War.
Focusing on the experience of middle class white
families, Sklar attributed the decline to two fun
damental cultural changes: "a shift from quantitative
to qualitative mothering, and secondly a shift in
middle class family values from male to female con
trol or sexuality."

Sklar explains this increasing homegeneity of wom
en's life cycles to the growth of women's magazines,
such as the Ladies Home Journal, indicating an as
sumption of common family structures and ex
periences. She also noted a decline in infant mortality
rates, which occur after and later than the decline of
fertility rates. With fewer children, women were bet
ter able to commit themselves to keeping them alive
and healthy.
A startling trend shows up in a comparison of the
statistical changes in maternal mortality across racial
lines, according to Sklar. Despite an overall down
ward trend, "there is a tremendous difference be
tween white and non-white groups, and this dif
ference increases over time. Non-white mothers and
children continue to die at much higher rates today,"
she said.
In another study noted, the proportion of black
women participating in the labor force has been sub
stantially higher than white women; 54 percent of
black wives worked outside the home between
1896-1911 compared to 12 percent of white wives. Al
though over time the presence of women in all age
groups, black and white, increased in the labor force,
especially after 1940, "black women were still more
likely than white women to spend their entire lives
working," said Sklar.
In explaining the influx of women into the labor
market, Sklar pointed to two factors. First, an increas
ing supply of women available due to the declining
fertility and mortality rates, and also the cultural fac
tor of women's increasing need or desire to work, has
led to more working women. Second, there has been
rapid growth in the clerical and service sectors of the
economy, with jobs traditionally held by women
workers. In 1979 two out of three new jobs in the
clerical and service field were filled by women.
The result of this upsurge of economic and family
options for women has not necessarily made their
lives easier, according to Sklar. "While women have
taken on new responsibilities in the labor force, their
domestic responsibilities have not diminished . . .
while many cultural changes have made it easier for
women to join men in the labor force, very few cul
tural changes have made it easy for men to join wom
en in the household work responsibilities," she said.
The option of single motherhood is another new
stage in the increasing autonomy of working women.
Using a 1979 study of the Bureau of the Census, Sklar
pointed out the recent substantial increases in in
come for working women which allow women forthe
first time in history the economic freedom to support
not only themselves but their children. Children now
have a fifty-fifty chance of spending at least part of
their lives in a female-headed household, she said.
