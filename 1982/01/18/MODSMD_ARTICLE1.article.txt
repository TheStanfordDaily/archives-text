# Disarmament petitions circulating

### Tim Lundergan 
Proponents of a referendum call
ing for a bilateral nuclear arms peti
tion say they are confident they will
collect the 346,119 signatures they
need to place the issue on Califor
nia's November ballot.
The referendum reads, "The peo
ple of California. .. request that the
President of the United States pro
pose to the Soviet Union a mutual
nuclear weapons moratorium to im
mediately halt the testing, produc
tion, and deployment of all nuclear
warheads, missies, and delivery sys
tems."
A state referendum question has
no binding power on the president.
Supporters of the drive say they hope
to apply political pressure to per
suade the government to begin arms
negotiations.
"Governments only change policy
if a significant number of people put
pressure on them to change," said
Kristine Peterson, the volunteer co
ordinator for the Campaign for a
Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze for
San Mateo and northern Santa Clara
counties.
The Campaign has allied with a
number of local anti-nuclear weap
ons groups in conducting its petition
drive. Protest and Survive, a campus
based organization, collects signa
tures on campus through a booth it
sets up during lunch time in White
Plaza and by speaking to other cam
pus volunteer organizations.

Protest and Survive's Scott Elrod
said the group collected 300 to 400
signatures here before winter break
and has gotten another 120 since
then.
In Palo Alto, the Women's Party for
Survival concentrates on setting up
tables in shopping areas. Women's
Party member Maya Spector said the
group has 50 active members and 500
people on its mailing list. The Cam
paign also has its own volunteers col
lecting signatures.
December's Dance for Disarma
ment, which featured Joan Baez and
members of the Grateful Dead, was
designed to benefit the Campaign
and generated about 1500 signatures
for the petition.
The Women's Party is sponsoring
the documentary film "Eight Minutes
to Midnight" at the New Varsity next
Sunday. The film describes the efforts
of Harvard Medical School's Helen
Caldicott, a founder of Physicians for
Social Responsibility, who describes
nuclear weapons as "the greatest
public health hazard the world has
ever known."
The film's title refers to the hands
of the clock on the cover of the Bul
letin of the Atomic Scientists, a maga
zine published by scientists opposed
to nuclear weaponry. The clock
hands approaching midnight in
dicates their view of the imminent
danger of nuclear catastrophe.
The groups involved in the petition
drive appear confident they will get

the number of signatures they need
by their April deadline, although Pe
terson notes that "only 15 percent of
the people who begin the initiative
process ever really make it."
Spector said the groups collected
30,000 supporters in the Bay Area
over the last few weeks. Peterson de
scribed the statewide drive as "doing
well" and this area's effort as "doing
great."
Although Peterson says the cam
paign is well-financed because of its
broad-based support, it did not have
the resources to hire a firm which
guarantees it will collect enough sig
natures to put a petition on the
ballot. Nor could it finance a mail-out
petition of the kind she said was used
by the Jarvis-Ganns petition."That
method is enormously successful,
but enormously expensive," Peter
son said.
Proponents hope their efforts will
have the national impact of the
jarvis-Ganns proposition which lim
ited government spending. They say
California was chosen to kick off a na
tional weapons freeze drive because
it contains 10 percent of American
voters, it is known as a trend setting
state, and because it leads the nation
in the amount of money it receives
from defense contracts.
Petitions for California referen
dum questions require approximate
ly 350,000 signatures to get on the
ballot. The campaign is seeking half a
million to compensate for dupli
cations and ineligible signers.
The statewide organization is re
serving the money it is collecting for
a media advertising and educational
campaign between April and the No
vember elections.
Elrod feels a call for the bilateral
freeze is important because "the is
sue is not being addressed by politi
cians." He said that although the
world now has weapons containing
one million times the explosive
power of the Hiroshima bomb, Con
gressman Tom Lantosdid not include
nuclear arms control on the list of the
fifteen priorities he recently sent lo
cal constituents.
Weapons control is increasingly
important, Elrod said, because new,
more accurate generations of nucle
ar weapons now coming on-line will
act to destabilize the arms race. The

increased capacity of either side to
launch an effective first strike, wiping
out the other's weapons, would
enourage the superpowers to launch
on warning, striking first to keep
from being annihilated.
This tendency would make a crisis
more serious by increasing the risk of
an outbreak of nuclear war. It would
also make a war started by accident
more likely. Last year, for example,
the computer which warns American
commanders of attacks, malfunc
tioned and twice indicated that the
Soviet Union had launched a first
strike.
Peterson says the Campaign is
composed of members of all political
and philosophical persuasions. She
said her group includes a broad
range of people — from "a couple of
hippie-type women" to a "very
proper, religious, middle-class wom
an with pictures of Jesus on herwall."

sue is not being addressed by politi
cians." He said that although the
world now has weapons containing
one million times the explosive
power of the Hiroshima bomb, Con
gressman Tom Lantosdid not include
nuclear arms control on the list of the
fifteen priorities he recently sent lo
cal constituents.
Weapons control is increasingly
important, Elrod said, because new,
more accurate generations of nucle
ar weapons now coming on-line will
act to destabilize the arms race. The

increased capacity of either side to
launch an effective first strike, wiping
out the other's weapons, would
enourage the superpowers to launch
on warning, striking first to keep
from being annihilated.
This tendency would make a crisis
more serious by increasing the risk of
an outbreak of nuclear war. It would
also make a war started by accident
more likely. Last year, for example,
the computer which warns American
commanders of attacks, malfunc
tioned and twice indicated that the
Soviet Union had launched a first
strike.
Peterson says the Campaign is
composed of members of all political
and philosophical persuasions. She
said her group includes a broad
range of people — from "a couple of
hippie-type women" to a "very
proper, religious, middle-class wom
an with pictures of Jesus on herwall."
Proponents of a referendum call
ing for a bilateral nuclear arms peti
tion say they are confident they will
collect the 346,119 signatures they
need to place the issue on Califor
nia's November ballot.
The referendum reads, "The peo
ple of California. .. request that the
President of the United States pro
pose to the Soviet Union a mutual
nuclear weapons moratorium to im
mediately halt the testing, produc
tion, and deployment of all nuclear
warheads, missies, and delivery sys
tems."
A state referendum question has
no binding power on the president.
Supporters of the drive say they hope
to apply political pressure to per
suade the government to begin arms
negotiations.
"Governments only change policy
if a significant number of people put
pressure on them to change," said
Kristine Peterson, the volunteer co
ordinator for the Campaign for a
Bilateral Nuclear Weapons Freeze for
San Mateo and northern Santa Clara
counties.
The Campaign has allied with a
number of local anti-nuclear weap
ons groups in conducting its petition
drive. Protest and Survive, a campus
based organization, collects signa
tures on campus through a booth it
sets up during lunch time in White
Plaza and by speaking to other cam
pus volunteer organizations.

Protest and Survive's Scott Elrod
said the group collected 300 to 400
signatures here before winter break
and has gotten another 120 since
then.
In Palo Alto, the Women's Party for
Survival concentrates on setting up
tables in shopping areas. Women's
Party member Maya Spector said the
group has 50 active members and 500
people on its mailing list. The Cam
paign also has its own volunteers col
lecting signatures.
December's Dance for Disarma
ment, which featured Joan Baez and
members of the Grateful Dead, was
designed to benefit the Campaign
and generated about 1500 signatures
for the petition.
The Women's Party is sponsoring
the documentary film "Eight Minutes
to Midnight" at the New Varsity next
Sunday. The film describes the efforts
of Harvard Medical School's Helen
Caldicott, a founder of Physicians for
Social Responsibility, who describes
nuclear weapons as "the greatest
public health hazard the world has
ever known."
The film's title refers to the hands
of the clock on the cover of the Bul
letin of the Atomic Scientists, a maga
zine published by scientists opposed
to nuclear weaponry. The clock
hands approaching midnight in
dicates their view of the imminent
danger of nuclear catastrophe.
The groups involved in the petition
drive appear confident they will get

the number of signatures they need
by their April deadline, although Pe
terson notes that "only 15 percent of
the people who begin the initiative
process ever really make it."
Spector said the groups collected
30,000 supporters in the Bay Area
over the last few weeks. Peterson de
scribed the statewide drive as "doing
well" and this area's effort as "doing
great."
Although Peterson says the cam
paign is well-financed because of its
broad-based support, it did not have
the resources to hire a firm which
guarantees it will collect enough sig
natures to put a petition on the
ballot. Nor could it finance a mail-out
petition of the kind she said was used
by the Jarvis-Ganns petition."That
method is enormously successful,
but enormously expensive," Peter
son said.
Proponents hope their efforts will
have the national impact of the
jarvis-Ganns proposition which lim
ited government spending. They say
California was chosen to kick off a na
tional weapons freeze drive because
it contains 10 percent of American
voters, it is known as a trend setting
state, and because it leads the nation
in the amount of money it receives
from defense contracts.
Petitions for California referen
dum questions require approximate
ly 350,000 signatures to get on the
ballot. The campaign is seeking half a
million to compensate for dupli
cations and ineligible signers.
The statewide organization is re
serving the money it is collecting for
a media advertising and educational
campaign between April and the No
vember elections.
