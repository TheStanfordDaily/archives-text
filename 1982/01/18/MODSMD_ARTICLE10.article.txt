# A 						Preppy weekend away from Mummy
## 
### 
New Paltz, N.Y. (AP) — In a majestic
old mountain inn that Mummy would
love, preppies and non-preppies
donned their khakis and tweeds,
pointed their tongues firmly into their
cheeks and threw a blow-out for Prep.
It was ab-so-lutely to die. Really.
Sitting in Victorian armchairs and
warming their hands before wood
carved fireplaces (just like at the Club),
more than 50 of the hotel's 300 guests
talked — and experienced — Prep for
most of three days. Then on Sunday
they packed their LaCoste alligators and
Bass Weejuns and headed for home.

There were classes for
the hardcore: the
importance of

monogramming, making
corsages and

cheerleading tryouts.
There was a mixer, a
formal and a
homecoming queen.

It was easier for some than others.
Some had it in their blood.
Lake Mohonk Mountain House's
preppy weekend included advice from
two authors of "The Preppy Hand
book," which has sold more than 1.5
million copies, and an official from
Nantucket Island — the preppiest is
land in the world, by some accounts.
"Casablanca," which the preppy pro
gram calls "our favorite movie," was

shown. So was "Love Story." Yale's
Redhot & Blue singing group was sing
ing "Scotch and Water" all over the
place.
There were classes for the hardcore:

a homecoming queen: Allison Cooper,
a freshman at Smith.
Carol McD. Wallace, one of the prep
py handbook authors who describes
herself as a "lapsed preppy," emceed a
fashion show.

"This is your basic, practical outfit for
a football game and tailgate," she ad
vised. "Those knee socks may look rath
er girlish, but you can wear them all
your life."
Wallace came for publicity, "some
thing I always have an eye out for... al
though it's sort of tacky to admit it."
The biggest problem was figuring out
who was serious and who wasn't.

advice from the two
authors of "The Preppy
Handbook/' which had
sold more than 1.5
million copies, and an
official from Nantucket
Island — the preppiest
island in the world, by
some accounts.

Karen Strain, a Vassar College senior,
certainly was one of the serious ones.
People who dress in preppy clothing
can't be confused with the real thing,
she said. "If someone's a real preppy,
you can tell. They just exude preppi
ness."
Haydi Reinhard and Pam Feuerstein,
both 35-year-old Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
prep school graduates who grew up on
Nantucket, heard about the special
weekend and rushed to the hotel.
"My husband is constantly accusing
me of being preppy," said Feuerstein,
who brought her school ring.
"Until recently, we never realized
preppiness was such a big deal," added
Reinhard. "It's fun."
The whole affair ended with a debate
Sunday, where such weighty issues as
the relative preppiness of L.L. Bean and
Eddie Bauer clothing was discussed. But
the preppy exam of Saturday was the
true test of the color of their blood.
Some samples: "Preppy girls sleep in
(a) button-down shirts, (b) alligator
swamps or (c) Lanz nighties?" (Lanz
nighties, of course.)
True or False. "Pale blue boxer shorts
with a monogram are preppy." (True).

fashion show.

"This is your basic, practical outfit for
a football game and tailgate," she ad
vised. "Those knee socks may look rath
er girlish, but you can wear them all
your life."
Wallace came for publicity, "some
thing I always have an eye out for... al
though it's sort of tacky to admit it."
The biggest problem was figuring out
who was serious and who wasn't.

Lake Mohonk Mountain
House's preppy
weekend included
advice from the two
authors of "The Preppy
Handbook/' which had
sold more than 1.5
million copies, and an
official from Nantucket
Island — the preppiest
island in the world, by
some accounts.

Karen Strain, a Vassar College senior,
certainly was one of the serious ones.
People who dress in preppy clothing
can't be confused with the real thing,
she said. "If someone's a real preppy,
you can tell. They just exude preppi
ness."
Haydi Reinhard and Pam Feuerstein,
both 35-year-old Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
prep school graduates who grew up on
Nantucket, heard about the special
weekend and rushed to the hotel.
"My husband is constantly accusing
me of being preppy," said Feuerstein,
who brought her school ring.
"Until recently, we never realized
preppiness was such a big deal," added
Reinhard. "It's fun."
The whole affair ended with a debate
Sunday, where such weighty issues as
the relative preppiness of L.L. Bean and
Eddie Bauer clothing was discussed. But
the preppy exam of Saturday was the
true test of the color of their blood.
Some samples: "Preppy girls sleep in
(a) button-down shirts, (b) alligator
swamps or (c) Lanz nighties?" (Lanz
nighties, of course.)
True or False. "Pale blue boxer shorts
with a monogram are preppy." (True).
