## Editorials 911 
### 
911 is the number to call in the case of anon
campus emergency which requiresthe
assistance of police, fire or ambulance. Dialing
this number — or 9-911 from a University line —
will put the caller in contact with a central
dispatcher with jurisdiction over the Menlo
Park, Palo Alto, Mountain Viewand Stanford
areas.
The number listed in the Stanford directory is

sometimes confused with this main emergency
line. This has caused considerable problems.
This business number puts one in contact with a
clerk who is supposed to handle calls from those
seeking parking or business information. The
police are currently promoting a campaign to
inform the Stanford community that it should
dial 911 or 9-911 in an emergency, and notthe
listed business number. We applaud this effort.
