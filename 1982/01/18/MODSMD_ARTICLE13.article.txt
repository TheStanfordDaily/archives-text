# Police communications
## 
### 
In addition to the confusion about the correct
emergency number, there are other disturbing
communications problems which must be
addressed by the police and University
administrators.
• Daily reporters have attempted several times
this year to get information from the police on
weekends, only to be told, "A report will be
ready Monday." To cite a recent example, a man
roughly fitting the description of the "campus
rapist" was apprehended near Stern Hall on a
Saturday night. Rumors circulated that this man
was in fact the rapist.
When we attempted Sunday to get more
information from the police, we were told it
would be impossible until the next day. We
finally got in touch with an officer who released
some information about the case, but the Daily
was still unable to detail the full circumstances
of the arrest.
One reason forthe problem in getting
information on weekends isthat there are no
clerks to answer records lines. Why? Police say
they don't have the personnel. Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington said even he has had
difficulty —as long as a two-hour time lag — in
reaching his own men on patrol on the
weekends.
• Sketchy reports about the rapist's modus
operandi have been provided through the
University News Service; there have been,
however, significant gaps. Did he carry a
weapon? How did he approach his victims? Is
there any particular advice the police could

offer women to avoid future attacks? We have
asked these questions of the police, many times
to no avail.
Herrington explained that victims are often
promised that information which could
conceivably identify them to the community or
the rapist will not be released. While we are
sensitive to the victims' ordeal, we do not
believe they should exercise an unqualified veto
over the release of information that might allow
others to protect themselves from violent crime.
The dangerto potential victims notalerted to
the full story must not block the release of
important information.
We question the policy of directly releasing
information only through the University News
Service. This practice lends the sanitized aura of
a public relations release tothe information and
prompts justifiable skepticism on the part of
editors and the public.
Both the department and the University
should consider these communications
problems as significant enough weaknesses in
the present police services structure to take
immediate steps to correct them. And finally, we
urge University President Donald Kennedy to
provide financial support to police efforts to
make the campus safer. We find it ironic that the
University's financial priorities may be
providing for carefully pruned, watered and
landscaped bushes behind which attackers may
hide, without providing adequate police
protection for people using the campus.
