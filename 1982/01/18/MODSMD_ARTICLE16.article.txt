## Even threat of global destruction can't standardize morality 
### 
In his recent letter to the (Daily,
Jan. 5), Peter Bachetti lashes out at a
group of people he calls
"absolutists" — those who claim
"that people must have an objective,
absolute standard of morality."
Bachetti blames those who profess
the existence of such a moral code
for exploiting people's "ingrained"
abhorrence to subjective moralities
by using terms like "arbitrary
choice," and "personal whim" to de
scribe someone's self-created moral
beliefs.
First of all, I would like to suggest
that Bachetti tends to load his own
language with rather negative con
notations. Bachetti lumps all those
who stand by an objective moral
code under the name "absolutists."
Later in his letter, Bachetti connects
this "absolutism" with some other
less than attractive references to
phenomena like the Inquisition,
Iran's Ayatollah Rubollah Khomeini,
and the Moral Majority.

Bachetti castigates Andy Hartwell
(Daily, Dec. 2) for proposing that if no
set of moral ideas were truer or bet
ter than any other, then there would
be no sense in preferring the morali
ty of Martin Luther King Jr. to the mo
rality of Charles Manson. Respond
ing to Hartwell, Bachetti says simply
that since "King dedicated his life to
fighting injustice," while Manson
spent his time "causing hideous mi
sery," it is just obviousthat"King was
morally superior to Manson."
I agree with Bachetti's conclusion
that King was morally more correct
than Manson was. I do not agree,
though, that this stance can be hon
estly sustained without the use of
some moral standard to measure the
two moralities. What I, and I think
Hartwell also, would say, is merely
that there exists a certain way in
which human beings are intended to
behave — a human nature if you will
— and that Martin Luther King un
derstood this ideal human behavior

better than Charles Manson did.
The moment we say that one set of
moral ideas can be better than anoth
er set of moral ideas, we are, in fact,
measuring them both by a standard,
claiming that one set of values con
forms to this standard better than the
other set of values. Without such a
standard — if morality only meant
what each person happens to ap
prove of as permissable, there would
be no sense in saying that a person
had ever been more correct in hisap
proval than anyone else.
Perhaps I am not being clear
enough. Suppose that two people
are attempting to describe Hoover
Tower. One person says that Hoover
Tower is a tall, thin building full of big
men who study big ideas. The other
person says that Hoover Tower is a
low, squalid structure used to store
toilet seats.
The way we know that the first de
scription of Hoover Tower is truer tan

the second, is because Hoover Tower
is a real building, existing independ
ently of each person's description of
it. Thus we have a standard by which
to compare the two descriptions of
Hoover Tower. Similarly, perhaps
there is a real right and wrong, exist
ing independently of whatever I or
Bachetti think, some moral ideas will
draw nearertothe real right than will
others.
Bachetti ends his article with the
claim that "personal morality pro
motes humility." Frankly, I see little
of such humility in his letter. When
he declares that his "choice to value
caring about others is as valid as any
other value position, Bachetti seems
to make a rather bold claim — that his
ideas, arising out of the sheer power
of his imagination, are as good as any
ideas about morality.
On the contrary, those who hold to
an external moral code, to a sort of
objective rule of right behavior,

claim not to have managed to get the
truth on their side; instead, they
claim only to have managed to get on
the right side of the truth. Morality is
to be a guide by which we can correct
the incorrect; the incorrect are not to
shape morality according to their
own.
On jan. 6, the Daily ran a letter by
Tom Pratt, who suggested that, as a
generation, we have become "de
moralized." Perhaps he's right: we
watch, silently, from our living rooms
as 500 million people starve. We also
watch the increasing proliferation of
nuclear arms. On the same page,
Judy Anderson proclaimed that
"America is a nation of many re
ligions, and many ideas. It is this di
versity which makes our nation what
it is today."
Perhaps Pratt's conception of "de
moralization" can be translated to
Anderson's and Bachetti's espousals
of "overmoralization" — the more

moralities we have, the better off we
are. If it is true, as Bachetti says, that
everyone "has total faith in different
dogmas," and that all such dogmas
are coequally true, then we can bet
ter explain this difficulty that we have
in writing to condemn the nuclear
armament of the world. Nuclear
deployment is but one of many avail
able dogmas in which we may place
total faith.
Until we decide that there is some
thing very seriously wrong with this
"dogma," and with other world
views that belittle the value of human
life, we'll have to resign ourselves to
watching our country prepare for its
own annihilation. For as it stands
now, we have managed to develop,
and accept, the threat of global de
struction. And we are very close to
translating that threat into reality.
