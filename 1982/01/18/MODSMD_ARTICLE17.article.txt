## Foreign aid only prolongs dependence 
### 
As Americans have been told many times, this
country, while the largest single giver of aid to the
poorer countries, is far down the list in terms of the
proportions of wealth that goes to help the needy
of the world. The United States gives only 0.26 per
cent of its national product.
Sixteen other nations, headed by such unselfish
powers as the Netherlands and Scandinavian
countries, give more, up to nearly three times as
large a fraction. Worse, the bulk of what is called
U.S. economic aid goes as an adjunct of military aid
to a few strategic states, currently chiefly Israel and
Egypt. Aid is an adjunct to foreign policy, and little
is directed toward lifting the Third World from
poverty.
Yet Americans need not groan in penitence, be
cause it has never been shown that foreign eco
nomic aid (capital transfer, as opposed to techno
logical tranfer) is really helpful for economic
growth. It is good for Western consciences and for
the administrators on both the giving and receiv
ing ends, and Third World governments clamor for
it. But it has negative as well as positive effects.
Various countries have prospered with little or
none, and others have languished despite very
generous aid. The best example is Tanzania. The
idealistic socialism of Julius Nyerere has appealed
to welfare-oriented European governments, and
they have tried to make it successful by under
writing Tanzania like no other African state. The
result has been something approaching economic
breakdown.
The United States also has the excuse that it
helps poorer countries in ways other than con
tinual aid programs. This country is the leader in
technical assistance and also in help by private or
ganizations, which is usually, perhaps always, bet
ter managed than official aid. The United States
nrovided more than its share of investment capital,
which is certainly welcomed by host countries, al

though decried by some parties.
The United States also, most importantly, is not
only the biggest but the openest market for the
products of the less developed countries, both raw
materials and manufactured goods.
European countries that provide more official
aid and call for the rapid transfer of tens of billions
of dollars to the Third World have much more re
strictive trade policies. They would give charitably
but make it difficult for the Third World nations to
earn their way.
The ability to produce and sell is stimulating,
does encourage enterprise, and raises self-re
liance. Aid, on the contrary, causes a sense of de
pendence and leads nations (or governments,
which are most interested in aid) to see improve
ment in terms of what they can wheedle from the
rich, rather than in terms of what they can do for
themselves.
It is patronizing and demeaning. It rewards at
titudes of complaint, making the wealthy feel guil
ty. More or less of the attention of the state is
turned from self-improvement to the seeking of
benefits from abroad, the easier way to raise in
comes for the bureaucracy without reform at
home.
It might be better if the United States renounced
the notion of foreign aid altogether, stating that we
owe nothing, that we will extend a hand in emer
gencies and disasters, but that otherwise we will
simply cooperate with any state prepared to coop
erate with us for mutual benefit.
The Soviet Union disclaims responsibility for
world poverty and the Third World, apparently ac
cepting this, lays its claim against the nations,
headed by the United Staes, that accept more or
less responsbility (and that have more to give).
Yet this country can urge that it has not had co
lonies (except chiefly the Philippines) but has co
operated in the liberation of colonies, that most

Third World states have in fact been prospering
rapidly (in health standards as well as GNP) despite
population growth, and that the countries suffer
ing most poverty are generally those with least par
ticipation in the international commercial system
headed by the United States. If the poorer coun
tries wish to be free and sovereign, they must be
responsible. If it were understood that there is no
charitable aid in principle, their morale would be
stronger, the international scene would be health
ier, and there would be less reason for the poorer
lands to blame the United States and other de
veloped countries for their woes.
On the other hand, much more could be done
for mutual benefit. The United States is relatively
open to imports from the Third World, but there
remain many barriers, some trivial, some insur
mountable. It is especially discouraging to pro
ducers that, if they do as they are encouraged to do
and raise production importantly, producers in the
United States complain about the invasion of the
market, and duties are raised, or the exporting
country is forced by a threat of duties to impose a
quota and stifle further growth.
Tropical agriculture is largely undeveloped, and
the lands of the Third World have been only very
partially explored for minerals. In these and many
other ways, the United States could do much to
help poorer nations help themselves while bene
fiting from enlarged markets and sources of both
raw materials (including petroleum), and manu
factured imports while assisting in making a more
livable world. Leaving charity or "reparations"
aside, what really helps the poorer nations helps us
also. The world will prosper not by efforts to
transfer wealth but by spreading the ability to pro
duce wealth.
