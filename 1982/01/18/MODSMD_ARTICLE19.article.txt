## Andrew Bennett Uncle Sam's Armory has it all 
### 
"Uncle Sam's Armory, we sell 'em,
you shell 'em. This is Ron speaking,
can I help you?"
"Well Leonid, how are you? Say,
Leo, my people are pretty upset over
. .. no, I'm sorry, there's no way I can
sell you any high technology right
now, but I have some grain you might
be interested in ... Rope? What on
earth would you want rope for?
What's that?. . . About 225 million of
us by the last census ... five feet of
rope for each? I don't see why, but I
don't see why not. Say, I have this
friend looking for work in the na
tional security business ... Hello?
Hello?"
"Miss Jones .. . Miss Jones — I
seem to have been cut off. Could you
get the USSR back on the line for
me?"
"Hello, U.S.A., this is Ron speak
ing. Well Deng, how are things on
the mainland? . . . Yes, I know how
you feel about my selling planes to
Taiwan, but. . . Downgrade your em
bassy? I hardly think that's necessary.
Look, Deng, could you hold a
minute? I've got another call ...
Thanks."
"Hello, U.S.A., this is Ron, can I
help you? Chiang, I'm sorry to have
to say this but it looks like I'm going
to have to back off on this F-5G deal
. . . Well how do you think / feel? You
know I'd love to make the deal but
the Chinese, er, the Reds are giving
me all sorts of flak. I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do — why don't I sell you
an improved version of this year's
model? I'll even throw in all sorts of
options — radial tires, reclining
bucket seats, air to air missiles —
what do you say? Well, think it over.
Hey, I've got this friend in the na
tional security business who's look
ing for work and I understand that
he's got great connections in your
part of the world . . . Not interested?
... I see. Well, give me a call when
you decide on this airplane deal.
Sayonara."
"Hello, Deng? Look, before you
start in, I've decided not to sell the
F-5G to the Chinese, er, Nationalistic
Imperialists. . . that's right. I knew we
could work things out. Yessir, I just
told old Chiang straight to his face:
"Chiangold buddy, no F-sGsforyou.
Only an improved version of the
F-5E." . . . Why, Deng, there's no
need to be so upset. . . End of formal
diplomatic relations?
Look, Deng, just because I'm sell
ing planes to them doesn't mean that
I can't sell anything to you. As a mat

ter of fact, if you're so worried about
Taiwan, I've got some surface to air
missiles that would be just the thing
. . . That's right, we tested them on
our own F-5Es. Give me a call when
you've settled down and we can
work something out."
"Miss Jones, how many times do I
have to tell you that it's Jose Garcia
that I want to speak with? That's right,
Duarte is the president, but Garcia
runs the country — now get me Gar
cia on the line. What's that?
Nicaragua calling about financial aid?
Keep them on hold until they hang
up. Venezuela? Put them on."
"Luis, how are things on the Carib
bean? Some F-16s? Sure they're a
good deal — zero to sixty like you
wouldn't believe — but I don't see
what you want them for... Recrea-

tion?... I see. Well, I guess you know
what you're doing. Send some oil my
way and you've got a deal.
Say, could I interest you in some
tanks? We've got this new Chrysler
model . . . No? Well, if you change
your mind, you know who to call.
Great to do business with you."
"Hello, U.S.A., this is Ron. Men
achem, how are you?... Of course I
know you're upset about the
AWACS, but. . . Look, let me make it
up to you. Let's sign a defense agree
ment, maybe I'll throw in a few mis
siles so you can shoot at the AWACS
if you feel the need, and everybody's
happy, OK? Great. Now about this
Golan Heights annexation thing . . .
Hello? Hello?"
"Jose, sorry you had to wait so
long. I understand you've been hav
ing some problems with guerillas . . .
I see. Are you sure they're under
Cuban guidance? . . . Yes, I suppose
those cigars are a sure tip-off. About
this request for helicopters and small

arms; I was looking around earlier for
my list of who's been naughty and
who's been nice, but I can't seem to
find it.
Let's see .. ! 1981 No Deficit
Budget Plan' ... 'I will not endorse
the draft campaign promise' . . ! So
cial Program Safety Net' .. . no, it's
not in the wastebasket. How about
this: 'Do you promise, cross your
heart and hope to die, not to torture
or murder any more innocent men,
women, and children?'
You do? Great. Just send me a list of
whatever you need and it's yours,
compliments of the U.S. taxpayers
.. . Sure, anytime. Don't be a
strangler, er, stranger. Bye now."
"Miss Jones, have you got Leonid
yet? Great, put him on."
"Hello, Leo. Sorry we got cut off
before. Look, I need to have a word
with you about Poland ... Leo?
Hello?"
"Mr. President, a Mr. Allen wants
to speak with you."
"All right, put him on."
"Hello, Richard ... No, I'm sorry,
but I've been trying all over and
things are really tight, you know?
Stock market tips? Well, I don't know
that. . . hold on just a minute, I've got
another call .. . Hello? Well Alan
Cranston, what a surprise ... What
do you mean, you just wanted to
know if I intend to come up with a
coherent and unified foreign policy?
I've already got one, based on the
simple principle of.. . just a minute,
I've got somebody on hold .. .
Allen? Yes, as I was saying, sell ev
erything ... That's right, sell ev
erything and anything. To whom? It
really doesn't matter; anyone who
can come up with the money. That's
right.
Yes . . . goodbye .. . Hello,
Cranston? Oh, this is Richard Allen?
You mean I was just talking to ... oh
well, I guess it really doesn't matter.
Look, can you call me when I'm not
so busy? . . . Uh huh ... I will. Good
bye."
"Hello, Uncle Sam's Armory, this is
Ron, can I help you?"
