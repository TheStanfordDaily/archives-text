Martin Luther King was hailed as
an "idealist with a sense of translating
his ideals into a concrete reality" Fri
day at the service in Kresge
Auditorium commemorating his
birthday.
The service, during which Kennell
Jackson, associate professor of his
tory, addressed several hundred
people, was only one of the activities
on campus held in honor of King. A
noon rally in White Plaza and the
showing of a movie depicting King's
life wereincluded in the day's events.
Jackson called King "a churchman
who thought that Heaven had a
chance, even here on Earth. It is the
nobility of human struggling that
makes his life important," he said.
During the service, Jackson lauded
the Voting Rights Act of 1964 and ac
cused the Reagan administration of
seeking to "water down voting rights
provisions (in the Senate) to accom

modate Southern anti-voting senti
ment.
"Today," he said, "The Voting
Rights Act not only assures some
fairness in this most basic process of
the country we live in, not only for
blacks but. . . in the extension of the
franchise to Hispanic Americans,
new Asian Americans and others."
At the noon rally, Frederick Buhl,
member of the ASSU Council of Pres
idents, urged the University to "live
up to its responsibilities to minority
students." He said that as "we find
that the national and world econom
ic picture is one that is worsening ev
ery day. . . we find that racism and
narrow minded prejudice are on the
rise and that even an institution as
reputable as Stanford University con
tinues to perpetuate an inverted pyr
amid of priorities where principle is
taught as being secondary to expe
dience, conscience takes a back seat

to indifference, and the training of
peacemakers remains subordinate to
the creation of money barons and
wealthy magnates."
He said that change can be ef
fected with knowledge, stamina and
perseverance. "In our studies," he
said, "we should learn our respective
cultures and understand how ours
differs from the culture in which we
find ourselves immersed.
"As historians we must protray a
more accurate history of the world.
As political scientists we must be
come better statespeople for our
communities. As engineers we must
build a better society," he said.
Buhl announced that the ASSU will
create a Task Force on Minority Af
fairs to take the place of the formerly
University-operated Committee on
Student Services for Minority Affairs.
"For if the University neglects its re-
sponsibilities, students have recourse
but to act in their own best interests,"
he said.
"Let us follow Dr. King's positivism
and fight hatred with love, war with
peace and blindness with a vision of

how America ought to be.
"Our concept of Stanford must
always be not simply that of a corpo
ration producing degrees, but as an
institution of higher learning â€”
teaching us how to lift mankind to a
higher level of human existence."
