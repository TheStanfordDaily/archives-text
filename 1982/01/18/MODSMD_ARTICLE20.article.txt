## Highs and lows of Farm life 
### 
The recent holiday vacation has
provided me with the chance to re
flect on various lows and highs of fall
quarter, and of Stanford life in gener
al. Before fall quarter, 1981, becomes
just another file in some faceless clut
ter, it needs to be closely scrutinized
and reviewed.
A vast amount of Stanford-related
news and information is processed
by students every quarter. By quar
ter's end, students seem to have an
opinion about every aspect of the
University. And while these opinions
may be ill-conceived, ill-advised, and
composed of four-letter words, they
are often quite humorous and pro
vide interesting insight.
The students who voice these opin
ions the loudest can usually be iden
tified by their low grades. These stu
dents will often try to convince their
parents to get a divorce. They are the
resident cynics of Stanford Univer
sity. Yet few of these resident cynics
actually express their criticism
through any of the large public com-

munication channels. These cynics
prefer to express their sentiments
while waiting in long Registration
week lines or while using campus
restroom facilities.
And now for the critical synposis:
The Stanford Image — The Univer
sity suffers from somewhat of an in
feriority complex. I had previously
thought that Stanford's identity as
'The Harvard-of-the-West' stems
from some latent fear of castration.
But the way in which Stanford seem
to walk in Harvard's shadow rather
than make its own interesting path
would indicate that Stanford was
probably castrated some time ago.
The Cardinal Mascot — The Stan
ford Observer's red-colored head
line, "It's official: We're the
Cardinal," is the latest Mascot farce.
Having a color for a mascot is about
as unique as having a paint brush for
a pet. The University's desire to end
the Mascot controversy is a mistake.
The yearly Mascot controversy adds

more color to this University than the
colorless Cardinal could ever hope to
provide.
The University's Handling of the
Zeta Psi Suspension — The manner in
which the University handled the
Zete issue tasted as bad as University
food service. Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig could not have made
such a big mess of the whole affair.
Every time I picked up the Daily to
read about the Zetes I kept imagining
the pages were Chronicle green.
The Women's Center — The wom
en/men involved may mean well, but
these people take themselves a little
too seriously. Granted, rape is a seri
ous problem. However, students
now have to watch over their shoul
ders for militant feminists as well as
rapists. The Center has created a new
problem on campus: mental rape.
And by the way, how was your
vacation?
