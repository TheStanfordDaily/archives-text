## Felinist studies examine cattiness 
### 
I was sitting at the breakfast table across from my cat
the other morning, and we fell to talking. I asked
Meischa how it felt to have recently become so much in
the publiceye, what with the recent deluge of cat books,
calendars, posters, and all. My cat became surprisingly
serious.
"Exploitation," he growled. "We cats have been com
pletely manipulated by big business. I mean people
seem to enjoy cattiness lately, and so all you see are tails
and whiskers, whiskers and tails, all over the place. It
used to be o.k. to have a small set of whiskers, but now —
every cat thinks he's inadequate if he doesn't measure
up to the glamour felines on television and in films. Big
sets of whiskers, sleek little tails . .. whole thing makes
me sick."
"What about the Kliban cats?" I queried.
"The ones on the calendars? Pin-up pussies. ]ust as
bad. Selling your fur for some quick exposure, maybe a
promise of some good catnip. I tell you, it's cats like that
who send our movement back a hundred years."
"Movement?"
"Look," Meischa said, stretching his claws out,
scrutinizing them, and slowly retracting them, "we cats
have been at everyone's mercy since the beginning of
time. Who got domesticated way back at the dawn of
man? Cats."
"But horses and dogs were too," I offered, trying to
keep pace.
"Sure, they got domesticated," he conceded, "but
who's at the bottom of the domestic totem pole? Think
about it. The barn animals get their own stalls and pens,
even dogs get dog houses — what do we get? Nothing.
'Declawed and in the kitchen,' they say. And when we
try and express our true identity, our real cattiness, like
catching a bird or a lizard, we're chastised — humiliated,
outcast, alienated. So we're trapped in the house with no
way to express our self — it's no wonder so many cats lie
around the house and get fat — they're so repressed . . .
"So hence the movement," I interrupted.
"Ah yes, the movement." Meischa straightened up
and looked at me squarely over his saucer of milk, which
I then noticed was dry.
"Let me get you some more milk," I interrupted.
"No!" he shrieked, leaping to the table, "that's pre
cisely the thingwe're fighting! Always getting us milk,
opening cans for us — we can take care of ourselves!
And why does everyone assume we want milk?!" His tail
whipped down against the table. "Did anyone think we
might like a sipof water along with the dogs? No. Always
a little condescending saucer of milk!"
"But I always thought cats hated dogs."
"See, there you are!" he said slapping down his tail tri
umphantly, "Another misassumption about cats! But if
dogs are pigs," he continued, "then so are horses, and
fish, and humans especially. None of you try to really un
derstand us or allow us the freedom to be ourselves.
How can we help but hate you all!"
His tail whipping dangerously close to the leftover syr
up on my plate, Meischa sighed and jumped back to his
chair.
"So, it's all the pigs in this world that we're fighting. But
before we can strike out," Meischa gave a long stretch,
arching his back, "we have to reaffirm our identities, de
marcate ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom.
So we have consciousness-raising groups," he purred,
and settled back onto the chair.
"Consciousness-raising? But when? And where?"

Somehow I couldn't see cats renting out a hall some
where.
"It's a grass roots thing," he explained, "cats are com
ing together on back fences all over the country, we're
putting our paws around one another and rejoicing as
one about our unity, yet great and wondrous diversity."
"But not diverse enough to include dogs?"
"Dogs are pigs!!" Meischa snapped.
"Oh."
"So we sing a lot and really talk about ourselves. It's
terribly uplifting."
"Is that that caterwauling I hear out in the back at three
in the morning?"
"Precisely." Meischa beamed. He licked the back of a
paw and smoothed the fur between his ears. "It sounds
ugly to you because you're not a cat. Which brings me to
another part of the movement — education of the ig
norant masses.

You see, cats have been
contributing to civilization since
the beginning. It's only in the past
few years that we're being
noticed. Felinist studies, it's called.
There's a wealth of literature by
cats about cats that's finally
receiving the attention it deserves.

artistic renaissance, cats everywhere are pouring their
felinist existence; their hardships, their sorrows, their
joys, into music and art and poetry."
"Is anyone catching on?" I suddenly remembered that
most local bookstores now had small sections devoted to
cat literature.
"Welllll.. . keepingin mind that we're reachingoutat
a belligerent and traditionalist world, some have broken
through. You've seen the big play, I assume."
"Big play?"
" 'I'm Getting My Cat Together and Taking It On The
Road.' I believe it's playing in San Francisco now — ac
tually getting critical acclaim." Meischa wiped a tear
from his eye. "It makes it all worth something, you
know? What with kitty-porn, the jeers at the pro-choice
for spaying and neutering marches, the endless cat jokes,
it's a lot of idiocy to put up with.
"You all don't understand yet the seriousness of our
cause. It's hard to be afeline in a world of pigs. You've got
to be tough. And you wonder why cats never smile."
"What about the Cheshire Cat?" I challenged, sensing
some futility in this breakfast debate.
"Sold out. Turned pig." He yawned. "Look, let's deal
with this more another time. I've got to get to my ana
lyst." He dropped down to the floor, stretched again,
and sauntered toward the back door. "Hey," he called
out, "this just about kills me, but, could you open the
door?"
"Sure," I smiled.

"Welllll.. . keepingin mind that we're reachingoutat
a belligerent and traditionalist world, some have broken
through. You've seen the big play, I assume."
"Big play?"
" 'I'm Getting My Cat Together and Taking It On The
Road.' I believe it's playing in San Francisco now — ac
tually getting critical acclaim." Meischa wiped a tear
from his eye. "It makes it all worth something, you
know? What with kitty-porn, the jeers at the pro-choice
for spaying and neutering marches, the endless cat jokes,
it's a lot of idiocy to put up with.
"You all don't understand yet the seriousness of our
cause. It's hard to be afeline in a world of pigs. You've got
to be tough. And you wonder why cats never smile."
"What about the Cheshire Cat?" I challenged, sensing
some futility in this breakfast debate.
"Sold out. Turned pig." He yawned. "Look, let's deal
with this more another time. I've got to get to my ana
lyst." He dropped down to the floor, stretched again,
and sauntered toward the back door. "Hey," he called
out, "this just about kills me, but, could you open the
door?"
"Sure," I smiled.

I was sitting at the breakfast table across from my cat
the other morning, and we fell to talking. I asked
Meischa how it felt to have recently become so much in
the publiceye, what with the recent deluge of cat books,
calendars, posters, and all. My cat became surprisingly
serious.
"Exploitation," he growled. "We cats have been com
pletely manipulated by big business. I mean people
seem to enjoy cattiness lately, and so all you see are tails
and whiskers, whiskers and tails, all over the place. It
used to be o.k. to have a small set of whiskers, but now —
every cat thinks he's inadequate if he doesn't measure
up to the glamour felines on television and in films. Big
sets of whiskers, sleek little tails . .. whole thing makes
me sick."
"What about the Kliban cats?" I queried.
"The ones on the calendars? Pin-up pussies. ]ust as
bad. Selling your fur for some quick exposure, maybe a
promise of some good catnip. I tell you, it's cats like that
who send our movement back a hundred years."
"Movement?"
"Look," Meischa said, stretching his claws out,
scrutinizing them, and slowly retracting them, "we cats
have been at everyone's mercy since the beginning of
time. Who got domesticated way back at the dawn of
man? Cats."
"But horses and dogs were too," I offered, trying to
keep pace.
"Sure, they got domesticated," he conceded, "but
who's at the bottom of the domestic totem pole? Think
about it. The barn animals get their own stalls and pens,
even dogs get dog houses — what do we get? Nothing.
'Declawed and in the kitchen,' they say. And when we
try and express our true identity, our real cattiness, like
catching a bird or a lizard, we're chastised — humiliated,
outcast, alienated. So we're trapped in the house with no
way to express our self — it's no wonder so many cats lie
around the house and get fat — they're so repressed . . .
"So hence the movement," I interrupted.
"Ah yes, the movement." Meischa straightened up
and looked at me squarely over his saucer of milk, which
I then noticed was dry.
"Let me get you some more milk," I interrupted.
"No!" he shrieked, leaping to the table, "that's pre
cisely the thingwe're fighting! Always getting us milk,
opening cans for us — we can take care of ourselves!
And why does everyone assume we want milk?!" His tail
whipped down against the table. "Did anyone think we
might like a sipof water along with the dogs? No. Always
a little condescending saucer of milk!"
"But I always thought cats hated dogs."
"See, there you are!" he said slapping down his tail tri
umphantly, "Another misassumption about cats! But if
dogs are pigs," he continued, "then so are horses, and
fish, and humans especially. None of you try to really un
derstand us or allow us the freedom to be ourselves.
How can we help but hate you all!"
His tail whipping dangerously close to the leftover syr
up on my plate, Meischa sighed and jumped back to his
chair.
"So, it's all the pigs in this world that we're fighting. But
before we can strike out," Meischa gave a long stretch,
arching his back, "we have to reaffirm our identities, de
marcate ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom.
So we have consciousness-raising groups," he purred,
and settled back onto the chair.
"Consciousness-raising? But when? And where?"

Somehow I couldn't see cats renting out a hall some
where.
"It's a grass roots thing," he explained, "cats are com
ing together on back fences all over the country, we're
putting our paws around one another and rejoicing as
one about our unity, yet great and wondrous diversity."
"But not diverse enough to include dogs?"
"Dogs are pigs!!" Meischa snapped.
"Oh."
"So we sing a lot and really talk about ourselves. It's
terribly uplifting."
"Is that that caterwauling I hear out in the back at three
in the morning?"
"Precisely." Meischa beamed. He licked the back of a
paw and smoothed the fur between his ears. "It sounds
ugly to you because you're not a cat. Which brings me to
another part of the movement — education of the ig
norant masses.

You see, cats have been
contributing to civilization since
the beginning. It's only in the past
few years that we're being
noticed. Felinist studies, it's called.
There's a wealth of literature by
cats about cats that's finally
receiving the attention it deserves.
