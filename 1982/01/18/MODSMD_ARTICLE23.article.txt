## Health clubs provide both emotional and physical training 
### 
Los Angeles — We knew that visit
ing a health club would be an eye
opening experience — and then
some. But we never suspected how
much the encounter would teach us
about ourselves.
Though newspaper advertise
ments across the country have been
telling us to "get with it" for several
years, we decided to take the cure in
Southern California, where "exercise
centers" have become as indigenous
to the landscape as freeways and Dis
neyland.
It was just after 5 p.m. recently
when we joined a wave of young
business people, school teachers and
.self-professed actors and actresses at
"The Sports Connection" in body
conscious Santa Monica. Many of
our cohorts had paid several hun
dred dollars for annual memberships
to enjoy access to Universal weight
machines, racquetball courts and a
wide array of co-educational slim
ming courses.
We quickly realized that a single
visit would only scratch the surface of

this club's means of getting in shape.
It also dawned on us that the boom
ing exercise business said more
about our generation's emotional
health than about its physical well
being.
Piped-in rock and roll, a juice bar
and plush changing rooms helped
make this more than the average
gym. The conditions were perfect,
the mood relaxed. An hour or two
here eased one's nerves in ways pref
erable to those of a scotch on the
rocks.
Whether on the aerobic dance
floor or in the weight room, the quest
for physical perfection seemed to
transcend sexual lines. With both
men and women donning bright,
"liquid skin" togs, it almost appeared
that the sexes were competing for
the unofficial honor of "Best Human
Specimen."
But there should be no mistake.
Sexuality is the active ingredient in a
fitness center's ability to attract and
mix young singles.
One female physician's remarks

spoke for many fellow participants:
"I don't have much time to fool
around," she said. "I came here to
exercise and check out the guys. It's
one of the few places in town where
you know what you're getting."
It would be difficult to measure

only scratch the surface of this club's means of

boomin exercice business said more about
our generation's emotional health than about
its physical well-being.

whether health clubs are most effec
tive meeting grounds for young peo
ple than singles bars or dating ser
vices. But the drift toward them may
indicate that many Americans find
such oases more natural, fresh and
comfortably within their realm of ex
perience. Indeed, health clubs might
be the logical recourse for a gener

ation that has enjoyed many social
freedoms but hasn't found fulfilling
solutions.
Even the most gregarious among
us can't deny that the opportunities
to meet men and women after col
lege often seem limited. Co-workers

and neighbors don't always make up
for the untold numbers of interest
ing-looking people one encounters,
but never meets, on the street, in the
supermarket, or on the bus.
Many of us who went through col
lege believing it to be the perfect
training ground for post-graduate
life have also found that the less-self

conscious social environment on
campus isn't easily duplicated in the
real world.
Perhaps many of our contem
poraries moved too quickly from
freshman orientation to "man
agement trainee," missing some of
the lessons along the way. A recent
article in The New York Times sug
gested an even worse situation today,
reporting concern among college
deans that this fall's freshman class
has given an unhealthy low priority
to socializing. Unfortunately, these
grinds are likely to find themselves,
as many of their predecessors already
have, woefully unprepared for man
aging their personal lives to satisfac
tion.
The decision to join an exercise
center, then, is almost as if to say,
"I'm getting my act together." It's
taking the initiative to spend a por
tion of the day socializing behind the
veil of physical fitness. That so many
young American adults are pumping
and grinding may indicate that health
clubs are helping in the search for an

"organized" way for single adults to
meet one another.
Perhaps the average "Sports Con
nection" client has discovered that
professional status and big salary are
meaningless when one's self-worth is
so muddled that conversation with
strangers is virtually impossible. Or,
after years of hanging out at singles
bars, many more may have joined
their local exercise studio knowing
that electronic bucking bulls don't
make the world go 'round.
It's ironic that one's emotional
well-being may be the real focus of
physically-oriented health clubs. Yet,
we too, left the Santa Monica spa
with an expanded sense of
"healthy." But there's more to get
ting in shape than toning one's
muscles. As beneficial as regular ex
ercise can be for a good disposition,
no amount of leg-lifting alone can
cure an undernourished demand for
companionship.

We quickly realized that a single
visit would only scratch the surface of

this club's means of getting in shape.
It also dawned on us that the boom

about our generation's emotional
health than about its physical well

Piped-in rock and roll, a juice bar
and plush changing rooms helped
make this more than the average
gym. The conditions were perfect,
the mood relaxed. An hour or two
here eased one's nerves in ways pref
erable to those of a scotch on the
rocks.
Whether on the aerobic dance
floor or in the weight room, the quest
for physical perfection seemed to
transcend sexual lines. With both
men and women donning bright,
"liquid skin" togs, it almost appeared
that the sexes were competing for
the unofficial honor of "Best Human
Specimen."
But there should be no mistake.
Sexuality is the active ingredient in a
fitness center's ability to attract and
mix young singles.
One female physician's remarks

spoke for many fellow participants:
"I don't have much time to fool
around," she said. "I came here to

whether health clubs are most effec
tive meeting grounds for young peo
ple than singles bars or dating ser
vices. But the drift toward them may
indicate that many Americans find
such oases more natural, fresh and
comfortably within their realm of ex
perience. Indeed, health clubs might
be the logical recourse for a gener

ation that has enjoyed many social
freedoms but hasn't found fulfilling
solutions.
Even the most gregarious among
us can't deny that the opportunities
to meet men and women after col
lege often seem limited. Co-workers

and neighbors don't always make up
for the untold numbers of interest
ing-looking people one encounters,
but never meets, on the street, in the
supermarket, or on the bus.
Many of us who went through col
lege believing it to be the perfect
training ground for post-graduate
life have also found that the less-self

conscious social environment on
campus isn't easily duplicated in the
real world.
Perhaps many of our contem
poraries moved too quickly from
freshman orientation to "man
agement trainee," missing some of
the lessons along the way. A recent
article in The New York Times sug
gested an even worse situation today,
reporting concern among college
deans that this fall's freshman class
has given an unhealthy low priority
to socializing. Unfortunately, these
grinds are likely to find themselves,
as many of their predecessors already
have, woefully unprepared for man
aging their personal lives to satisfac
tion.
The decision to join an exercise
center, then, is almost as if to say,
"I'm getting my act together." It's
taking the initiative to spend a por

veil of physical fitness. That so many
young American adults are pumping
and grinding may indicate that health
clubs are helping in the search for an

"organized" way for single adults to
meet one another.
Perhaps the average "Sports Con
nection" client has discovered that
professional status and big salary are
meaningless when one's self-worth is
so muddled that conversation with
strangers is virtually impossible. Or,
after years of hanging out at singles
bars, many more may have joined
their local exercise studio knowing
that electronic bucking bulls don't
make the world go 'round.
It's ironic that one's emotional
well-being may be the real focus of
physically-oriented health clubs. Yet,
we too, left the Santa Monica spa
with an expanded sense of
"healthy." But there's more to get
ting in shape than toning one's
muscles. As beneficial as regular ex
ercise can be for a good disposition,
no amount of leg-lifting alone can
cure an undernourished demand for
companionship.

Los Angeles — We knew that visit
ing a health club would be an eye
opening experience — and then
some. But we never suspected how
much the encounter would teach us
about ourselves.
Though newspaper advertise
ments across the country have been
telling us to "get with it" for several
years, we decided to take the cure in
Southern California, where "exercise
centers" have become as indigenous
to the landscape as freeways and Dis
neyland.
It was just after 5 p.m. recently
when we joined a wave of young
business people, school teachers and

"The Sports Connection" in body
