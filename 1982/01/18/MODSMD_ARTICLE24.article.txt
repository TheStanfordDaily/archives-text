Washington — As tension in
creases between the super
powers, a macabre question is
becoming central to a growing
national debate over the im
plications of the nuclear arms
race: Can the United States
survive a nuclear war with the
Soviet Union?
There seems to be an inclina
tion, at least within the Reagan
administration, to look upon
nuclear conflict as something
less than a terminal holocaust.
Statements about attaining a
nuclear war-fighting capabili
ty, limited nuclear war, the de
velopment of tactical nuclear
weapons and an increased em
phasis on civil defense all as
sume that "nuclear war-fight
ing," as it has come to be
known, is compatible with the
continuance, after a brief and
manageable interruption, of
civilization more or less as we
know it.
T.K. Jones, deputy under
secretary of defense for
strategic and nuclear forces,
said that with proper civil de
fense, it would take only two to
four years for the United States
to fully recover from an all-out
nuclear war with the soviet
Union.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA),
which is in charge of the U.S.
civil defense program that the
Reagan administration plans to
expand, has declared that "the
United States could survive nu
clear attack and go on to re
covery within a relatively few
years."
In columns and commen
taries prepared for publication
in local newspapers, the agen
cy has argued that "Americans
would not be helpless. . . .They
could meet and overcome all

the challenges of the post-at
tack environment" by taking
such protective measures as
evacuation of urban popu
lations, survival training and
the constrution of simple
fallout shelters.
William Chipman, chief of
FEMA's civil defense division,
likens what his agency calls
"post-attack recovery" to the
problems encountered in oth
er major but survivable his
torical disasters.

'Can the seriously injured be treated
at George Washington
University Hospitalllt no longer
exists.'

His comments were directed
at the increasing number of
doctors who have organized in
groups, such as Physicians for
Social Responsibility, to call at
tention to the implications of
nuclear war. Chipman took
particular umbrage over testi
mony by Dr. Howard Hiatt,
dean of the Harvard School of
Public Health.
Hiatt told a Senate commit
tee last year: "Recent talk by
public figures about winning
or even surviving a nuclear war
must reflect a widespread fail
ure to appreciate a medical re
ality: Any nuclear war would
inevitably cause death, disease
and suffering of epidemic pro
portions, and effective medical
intervention on any realistic
scale would be impossible."
Hiatt cited an Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency
study that postulated a one
megaton attack on the city of
Washington. The result would

be that of the area's 2.5 million
inhabitants, more than 600,000
would be killed and 800,000 in
jured. Hiatt said he doubted
there would be the one-week
notice to evacuate the popu
lation on which Chipman and
other civil defense officials
base their projections. And be
cause medical facilities and
supplies are concentrated in
the urban area, the surviving
population would not be
treated.

"Can the seriously injured
be treated at George Washing
ton University Hospital?," Hiatt
asks, somehat rhetorically. "It
no longer exists. Georgetown
University Hospital? It, too, has
been destroyed. In ruins, as
well, are Howard Univeristy
Hospital, D.C. General, Capital
Hospital and several others."
But the answer, the agency
said, is that "people would
have to help each other during
the emergency" by depending
upon their own knowledge of
first aid.
Further detail has been pro
vided in another agency publi
cation, which offers a seven
point plan for dealing with
burn victims. It suggested giv
ing the patient water and cov
ering the burned area with dry
gauze.
Because burn victims will be
numerous, Hiatt does not find
the agency manual's suggested
care adequate.
"Let me cite one reason for

my pessimism by describing
the case of a 20-year-old man
who was hospitalized last week
in the burn unit of Boston's
Massachusetts General Hospi
tal," he said. "In the first eight
days of hospitalization, this pa
tient needed 102 units of fresh
frozen plasma, 42 units of
fresh-frozen red blood cells
and 12 units of platelets to
compensate for losses from the
burned areas. He had two four
hour operations, each requir
ing four surgeons, two
anesthetists and several nurses.
He was on a respirator con
stantly and required highly
specialized nursing care
around the clock. This type of
taxing care could not be per
formed by non-professionals."
Mass deaths also would pres
ent hazards to the survivors.
Physicians argue that
pestilence, for example, would
be a problem even if tens of
millions should manage to sur
vive the effects of the initial
blase, fire and radiation.
Dr. Herbert Abrams of the
Harvard Medical School sug
gested in a report last month to
the American Association for
the Advancement of Science
that "insects, many of which
have an unexplained immunity
to radiation, would thrive on
the unburied corpses, infest
surviving animals, and, even
tually, man."
The emergency man
agement agency takes the op
posite position. A pamphlet
supplied by Chipman assures
readers that "the specter of
pestilence and disease stalking
the land in the aftermath of nu
clear war is probably just that
— a specter, not a realistic
probability. It need not, and
probably would not, occur."

or even surviving a nuclear war
must reflect a widespread fail
ure to appreciate a medical re
ality: Any nuclear war would
inevitably cause death, disease
and suffering of epidemic pro
portions, and effective medical
intervention on any realistic
scale would be impossible."
Hiatt cited an Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency
study that postulated a one
megaton attack on the city of
Washington. The result would

be that of the area's 2.5 million
inhabitants, more than 600,000
would be killed and 800,000 in
jured. Hiatt said he doubted
there would be the one-week
notice to evacuate the popu
lation on which Chipman and
other civil defense officials
base their projections. And be
cause medical facilities and
supplies are concentrated in
the urban area, the surviving
population would not be
treated.

"Can the seriously injured
be treated at George Washing
ton University Hospital?," Hiatt
asks, somehat rhetorically. "It
no longer exists. Georgetown
University Hospital? It, too, has
been destroyed. In ruins, as
well, are Howard Univeristy
Hospital, D.C. General, Capital
Hospital and several others."
But the answer, the agency
said, is that "people would
have to help each other during
the emergency" by depending
upon their own knowledge of
first aid.
Further detail has been pro
vided in another agency publi
cation, which offers a seven
point plan for dealing with
burn victims. It suggested giv
ing the patient water and cov

Because burn victims will be
numerous, Hiatt does not find
the agency manual's suggested
care adequate.
"Let me cite one reason for

my pessimism by describing
the case of a 20-year-old man
who was hospitalized last week
in the burn unit of Boston's
Massachusetts General Hospi
tal," he said. "In the first eight
days of hospitalization, this pa
tient needed 102 units of fresh
frozen plasma, 42 units of
fresh-frozen red blood cells
and 12 units of platelets to
compensate for losses from the
burned areas. He had two four
hour operations, each requir
ing four surgeons, two
anesthetists and several nurses.
He was on a respirator con
stantly and required highly
specialized nursing care
around the clock. This type of
taxing care could not be per
formed by non-professionals."
Mass deaths also would pres
ent hazards to the survivors.
Physicians argue that
pestilence, for example, would
be a problem even if tens of
millions should manage to sur
vive the effects of the initial
blase, fire and radiation.
Dr. Herbert Abrams of the
Harvard Medical School sug
gested in a report last month to
the American Association for
the Advancement of Science
that "insects, many of which
have an unexplained immunity
to radiation, would thrive on
the unburied corpses, infest
surviving animals, and, even
tually, man."
The emergency man
agement agency takes the op
posite position. A pamphlet
supplied by Chipman assures
readers that "the specter of
pestilence and disease stalking
the land in the aftermath of nu
clear war is probably just that
— a specter, not a realistic
probability. It need not, and
probably would not, occur."
Washington — As tension in
creases between the super
powers, a macabre question is
becoming central to a growing
national debate over the im
plications of the nuclear arms
race: Can the United States
survive a nuclear war with the
Soviet Union?
There seems to be an inclina
tion, at least within the Reagan
administration, to look upon
nuclear conflict as something
less than a terminal holocaust.
Statements about attaining a
nuclear war-fighting capabili
ty, limited nuclear war, the de
velopment of tactical nuclear
weapons and an increased em
phasis on civil defense all as
sume that "nuclear war-fight
ing," as it has come to be
known, is compatible with the
continuance, after a brief and
manageable interruption, of
civilization more or less as we
know it.
T.K. Jones, deputy under
secretary of defense for
strategic and nuclear forces,
said that with proper civil de
fense, it would take only two to
four years for the United States
to fully recover from an all-out
nuclear war with the soviet
Union.
The Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA),
which is in charge of the U.S.
civil defense program that the
Reagan administration plans to
expand, has declared that "the
United States could survive nu
clear attack and go on to re
covery within a relatively few
years."
In columns and commen
taries prepared for publication
in local newspapers, the agen
cy has argued that "Americans
would not be helpless. . . .They
could meet and overcome all

the challenges of the post-at
tack environment" by taking
such protective measures as
evacuation of urban popu
lations, survival training and
the constrution of simple
fallout shelters.

FEMA's civil defense division,
likens what his agency calls
"post-attack recovery" to the
problems encountered in oth

His comments were directed
at the increasing number of
doctors who have organized in
groups, such as Physicians for
Social Responsibility, to call at
tention to the implications of
nuclear war. Chipman took
particular umbrage over testi
mony by Dr. Howard Hiatt,
dean of the Harvard School of
Public Health.
Hiatt told a Senate commit
