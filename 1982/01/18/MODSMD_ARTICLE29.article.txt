## Rejuvenated squad comes close WSU edges out Cardinal 63-58 
### Mike Oneal 
Pullman, Wash. — It looked like a brand
new basketball team Saturday night, but
unfortunately for Stanford, the rejuvina
tion wasn't quite complete.
After Monday night's humiliation in
Maples Pavilion at the hands of Oregon
State and Thursday's half-game with Wash
ington in Seattle, the Cardinal came to
Friel Court seemingly tired of looking
tired. The Washington State Cougars,
however, were not tired of what they've
been doing lately and pulled out their
fourth win in a row 63-58.
Despite the loss, Stanford's fifth this year
by five or less points, the game was a shot
in the arm for the Cardinal which is now
1-4 in Pacific-10 Conference play and 6-8
overall. The team shot better, rebounded
strongly, passed more effectively and at
tacked the game more vigorously than it
has done in weeks.
As head coach Dick Dißiaso said, "For
the most part I thought we played a much
improved ball game. I'm disappointed we
lost but not at how we played."
Even Cougar coach George Raveling
said after the game that he was impressed
with Stanford.
"That's the worst we've been out-re
bounded all year (28-14)," he said. Then,
seemingly overlooking freshman guard
Steve Brown's solid 10-assist, four-point ef
fort, the coach added, "They need (Keith)
Jones back. (Jones, a sophomore guard has
been deemed academically ineligible and
is out for an undetermined length of time.)
"With Jones they have the potential to
beat a really good team, Dick is justa guard
or two away," Raveling added. "With
(sophomore forward Hans) Wichary (out
with an injury) back, they'll have a very

good front line — but they need to com
plement it with speed."
Aggressiveness in the backcourt, if not
speed, was evident Saturday night as Stan
ford took control of the game right off the
bat — in stark contrast to the two previous
contests.
The Cougars, playing a stout zone de
fense, challenged well from the start but
Stanford passed effectively around them
and, sparked by two Brian Welch 15-
footers, jumped to a 10-4 lead with 14:12
remaining.
Washington State answered with a
ferocious man press, however, which
forced three crucial Cardinal turnovers
and kept Stanford from extending its lead
any further. The Card kept scoring, but the
press slowed its momentum by making it
struggle for every basket.
At 7:05 in the first half and the score
22-16 Stanford, the momentum switched
completely as the Cougars loosed a pre
viously unseen scoring machine, guard
Ken McFadden. McFadden, who hadn't
seen action for three weeks until Thurs
day's game with California due to a pulled
hamstring, threw in six points from outside
of 15 feet, creating a furor in the home
crowd and forcing a Stanford time-out
with 5:17 left.
Then, as if to spite everything but the
spirit of college basketball, the 6-2 senior
came out and scored four more for a total
of 10 straight points. University of San
Francisco transfer forward Guy Williams
added another bucket after stealing the
ball and Stanford called a second time-out
with WSU leading 26-22 and 4:30 remain
ing.
The ball changed hands a couple of
times after the time-out and with about

three minutes remaining, Raveling or
dered up his slowdown offense in an at
tempt to pull Stanford out of its zone de
fense, or at least hoping that the Cougars
could extend the lead to six with a last shot
before going into the lockerroom
Working the ball, WSU ate the clock
down to :11 when Marty fouled guard
Tyrone Brown and Dißiaso pulled one of
his patented you-can't-fire-me-yet
coaching moves.
Realizing that the Cardinal was two fouls
short of the seven needed to put the
Cougars in a bonus shooting situation,
Dißiaso inserted a whole new lineup and
ordered it to foul. Guard Charles Hunt did
the honors and confused, Washington
State was unable to set up for a last shot
upon taking the ball out before the clock
ran out.
Stanford came out firing again in the
second half and regained the lead 34-32
with 15:26 remaining after three Marty 10-
footers, a Welch bomb and a rare John
Revelli shot from outside.
Cougar forward Steve Harriel tied the
score at 34-34 with a jumpshot from the left
baseline, but Welch came back and pulled
Stanford up again. WSU's Arron Haskings
then scored from the top of the key, Revel
li was fouled but missed both free throws
and Tyrone Brown layed in a transition
basket to put the Cougars ahead again
38-36 at 13:07.
Stanford's last gasp came at 12:43 when
freshman forward Johnny Rogers hit a
turnaround and dunked inside to give the
Cardinal a 40-38 edge.
Williams, who finished with 13 points,
then tied the game with a sweet 15-foot
bankshot and after that, Stanford began to
falter, lost momentum and WSU pulled
ahead to the 63-58 win.

times after the time-out and with about

three minutes remaining, Raveling or
dered up his slowdown offense in an at
tempt to pull Stanford out of its zone de
fense, or at least hoping that the Cougars
could extend the lead to six with a last shot
before going into the lockerroom
Working the ball, WSU ate the clock
down to :11 when Marty fouled guard
Tyrone Brown and Dißiaso pulled one of
his patented you-can't-fire-me-yet
coaching moves.
Realizing that the Cardinal was two fouls
short of the seven needed to put the
Cougars in a bonus shooting situation,
Dißiaso inserted a whole new lineup and
ordered it to foul. Guard Charles Hunt did
the honors and confused, Washington
State was unable to set up for a last shot
upon taking the ball out before the clock
ran out.
Stanford came out firing again in the
second half and regained the lead 34-32
with 15:26 remaining after three Marty 10-
footers, a Welch bomb and a rare John
Revelli shot from outside.
Cougar forward Steve Harriel tied the
score at 34-34 with a jumpshot from the left
baseline, but Welch came back and pulled
Stanford up again. WSU's Arron Haskings
then scored from the top of the key, Revel
li was fouled but missed both free throws
and Tyrone Brown layed in a transition
basket to put the Cougars ahead again
38-36 at 13:07.
Stanford's last gasp came at 12:43 when
freshman forward Johnny Rogers hit a
turnaround and dunked inside to give the
Cardinal a 40-38 edge.
Williams, who finished with 13 points,
then tied the game with a sweet 15-foot
bankshot and after that, Stanford began to
falter, lost momentum and WSU pulled
ahead to the 63-58 win.

POLOISTS DUNK YUGOSLAVS — The Stanford water polo club, comprised of pres
ent and former Cardinal standout players, defeated the Yugoslavian Jug-Dobrovnik
team 15-13 Saturday at deCuerre pool. Hole-man Jody Campbell, shown here, was
instrumental in the victory. It was the senior Olympian's last game at the Farm.
Pullman, Wash. — It looked like a brand
new basketball team Saturday night, but
unfortunately for Stanford, the rejuvina
tion wasn't quite complete.
After Monday night's humiliation in
Maples Pavilion at the hands of Oregon
State and Thursday's half-game with Wash
ington in Seattle, the Cardinal came to
Friel Court seemingly tired of looking
tired. The Washington State Cougars,
however, were not tired of what they've
been doing lately and pulled out their
fourth win in a row 63-58.
Despite the loss, Stanford's fifth this year
by five or less points, the game was a shot
in the arm for the Cardinal which is now
1-4 in Pacific-10 Conference play and 6-8
overall. The team shot better, rebounded
strongly, passed more effectively and at
tacked the game more vigorously than it
has done in weeks.
As head coach Dick Dißiaso said, "For
the most part I thought we played a much
improved ball game. I'm disappointed we
lost but not at how we played."
Even Cougar coach George Raveling
said after the game that he was impressed
with Stanford.
"That's the worst we've been out-re
bounded all year (28-14)," he said. Then,
seemingly overlooking freshman guard
Steve Brown's solid 10-assist, four-point ef
fort, the coach added, "They need (Keith)
Jones back. (Jones, a sophomore guard has
been deemed academically ineligible and
is out for an undetermined length of time.)
"With Jones they have the potential to
beat a really good team, Dick is justa guard
or two away," Raveling added. "With
(sophomore forward Hans) Wichary (out
with an injury) back, they'll have a very

good front line — but they need to com
plement it with speed."
Aggressiveness in the backcourt, if not
speed, was evident Saturday night as Stan
ford took control of the game right off the
bat — in stark contrast to the two previous
contests.
The Cougars, playing a stout zone de
fense, challenged well from the start but
Stanford passed effectively around them
and, sparked by two Brian Welch 15-
footers, jumped to a 10-4 lead with 14:12
remaining.
Washington State answered with a
ferocious man press, however, which
forced three crucial Cardinal turnovers
and kept Stanford from extending its lead
any further. The Card kept scoring, but the
press slowed its momentum by making it
struggle for every basket.
At 7:05 in the first half and the score
22-16 Stanford, the momentum switched
completely as the Cougars loosed a pre
viously unseen scoring machine, guard
Ken McFadden. McFadden, who hadn't
seen action for three weeks until Thurs
day's game with California due to a pulled
hamstring, threw in six points from outside
of 15 feet, creating a furor in the home
crowd and forcing a Stanford time-out
with 5:17 left.
Then, as if to spite everything but the
spirit of college basketball, the 6-2 senior
came out and scored four more for a total
of 10 straight points. University of San
Francisco transfer forward Guy Williams
added another bucket after stealing the
ball and Stanford called a second time-out
with WSU leading 26-22 and 4:30 remain
ing.
