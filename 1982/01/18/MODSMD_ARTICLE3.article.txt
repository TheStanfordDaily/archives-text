# Economics helps archeologists

Economics and archaeology seldom draw closer to
each other than the few hundred metersthat separate
their departments on campus. However, University
lecturer Dr. Curtis Runnels has borrowed modern ec
onomic principles to dig up some realities of ancient
life.
Runnels, who received his doctorate from Indiana
University, is a post-doctoral scholar in classics and
anthropology and currently teaches a class on the
archaeology of Europe.
Theories of supply and demand and organized pro
duction have become far more useful than previously
supposed in unlocking some possible answers as to
the social and economic makeup of ancient sites in
Greece, said Runnels.
Runnels has applied his combined knowledge of
economics and classics to archeological evidence
from the Bronze Age site of Lerna in the Argolid re
gion of Greece. For example, millstones — tools used
by cultures for grinding wheat — seemed to evolve at
Lerna from smaller types with limited production
capability to larger types meant for mass production.
This suggests to Runnels that a greater degree of
specialization had sprouted in the community. The
more efficient millstone at Lerna allowed a few peo
ple to produce grain for the many, freeing up the so
ciety's labor to pursue other more specialized pro
duction, he said.
Runnels, though new to the faculty here, has
worked closely with Classics Prof. Michael Jameson
and Geology Prof. Tjeerd VanAndel in Stanford
archaeological research in the southern Argolid in
Greece.
Jameson, who heads the summer expedition to
Greece which has recently completed its third season,
has employed the aid of undergraduates and scholars

such as Runnels to trace the habitation patterns of
man from ancient times to the present. Runnels
served as assistant director of the Argolid Exploration
Project this past summer.
In the southern Argolid, an oscillation of larger nu
cleated settlements and smaller dispersed ones
through the region's history may reflect the rises and
falls in trade in the Mediterranean region; "it's a kind
of macroeconomic model," said Runnels.
The Argolid project has in three seasons located ap
proximately 178 ancient sites in the region from dif
ferent periods of ancient history, according to a pre
liminary report by Jameson and Runnels. The tracing
of the habitation patterns of ancient man provides im
portant information for the study of the social and ec
onomic history of rural society in ancient Greece, the
report indicated.
Finds in the last three summers of field work in the
southern Argolid have dated the earliest inhabitants
of the region to about 45,000 years ago, said Runnels.
Additional work at the Francthi cave by Runnels, un
der the leadership of Indiana University classicist Tom
Jacobson, proved the site to be the only one thus far
discovered in Europe with continual habitation from
25,000 to 5,000 8.C., said Runnels.
From the evidence of the type of stone tools dis
covered, Runnefs has conjectured that an early form
of Homo sapiens may have existed in the Argolid
some 7,000 years before their mysterious appearance
in Europe.
"If you dressed them up and put them in a sweat
suit and jogging shoes you wouldn't be able to tell the
difference from us," said Runnels. The existence of
Homo sapiens in Greece at that period would suggest
their migration to Europe from the Mediterranean,
he said.
