# Cal wins with scoring flurry 80-69
## Women hoopsters bow to Bears 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford women's
basketball team had NorCal
conference rival UC-Berkeley
on it's own turf Friday night at
Maples Pavilion, but a second
half scoring surge by the Bears
turned the tables and put the
game out of reach, 80-69.
Stanford, *11-4 overall going
into the game and on top of a
10 game winning streak, has
been on the edge of a national
ranking since the start of the
season. The Cardinal's only
four losses had come against
ranked teams in the University
of Montana (No. 8), the Uni
versity of Texas (No. 16), Cal-
State Longbeach (No. 6) and
USC (No. 2).
Cal, 13-6 after Friday's con

test, represents the best of the
NorCal league as last year's de
fending champion.
Cal leaped to a 36-28 half
time lead, largely by surprising
the Cardinal with an almost un
canny scoring exhibition from
the floor. Hitting a series a 20-
footers, the Bears put Stanford
in a catch-up ball game which it
never recovered from.
"We did what we had to do,"
said Stanford assistant coach
Sue Roicewijcz. "But they beat
us from 20 feet. We were scor
ing from three feet, but they
were scoring from 20."
The Bears are not reputed as
outside shooters. Their
strengths are rather in a strong,
steady running squad with
plenty of back-up material on

the bench.
But on this particular night
Cal wound up with a 50-per
cent field goal effectiveness,
enough to run away with the
game in spite of three outstan
ding scoring efforts from
Cardinal center Louise Smith,
forward Jeanne Ruark-Hoff,
and forward Meg Metzger.
The three stalwarts led a sec
ond half comeback effort that
brought Stanford to within one
point of the Bears midway in
the second half, making the
score 54-53 Cal. But the effort
spluttered when a scoring
slump set in, and Cal never
loked back.
"There was a lapse of about
five minutes," said Roicewijcz.
"We were really disorganized
on offense, not taking good
shots, and we let them run
away with it."
Leading the Cal barrage was
forward Cynthia Cooke, who
opened up for 20 points. She
was only one of four Bears in

double figures for the evening:
following her up were forward
Stephanie Guinn with 16,
guard Karen Smith with 14, and
reserve center Sarah Thamer
with 12. Only Smith and
Thamer have been among the
consistently high Bear scorers
for the season.
The Cardinal offensive attack
was marked by three individual
performances rather than a
team effort. Hoff and Smith
posted two season-high per
formances with 20 points each,
and Metzger was right behind
them with 16 of her own.
Rounding off the Stanford
scoring were Anne Miller with
seven, and guards Angie Pa
cione and Debi Gore with four
each.
Stanford's next opponent
will the University of Pacific, on
the road tommorow. Saturday
the Card returns to Maples Pa
vilion for another important
conference game against San
Jose State.
