# Lendl wins Masters title

### 
New York (AP) â€” Czech
oslovakia's Ivan Lendl
roared back from two sets
down and match point to
defeat Vitas Gerulaitis 6-7,
2-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 yesterday
and win the $400,000 Volvo
Masters tennis cham
pionships.
The victory was worth
$100,000 for Lendl, who
came into this eight-man,
year-ending tournament as
the No. 1 seed.
With his mother and
father looking on, Lendl
captured the Masters, the
finale of the year-long
Grand Prix circuit, for the
first time. Last year he lost in
the finals to Sweden's Bjorn
Borg.
Gerulaitis was in this

year's elite Masters field
only because Borg decided
to take a five-month hiatus
from tennis, thus making
room for the blond New
Yorker. He made the most
of his chance, advancing to
the semifinals from his
round-robin group, then
beating Eliot Teltscher in the
semis.
Lendl faced match point
in the third-set tiebreaker
when Gerulaitis was up 6-5,
won the next three points to
grab the set and begin his
surge to the title.
Gerulaitis, who pocketed
the runners-up purse of
$50,000, had found a
weakness in Lendl's for
midable arsenal, repeatedly
slicing to the Czech's

backhand. The tactic
worked until Lendl began
running around his
backhand and drilling his
powerful forehand to the
far reaches of the court,
passing Gerulaitis every
time he tried to come to the
net.
Ranked third in the world
behind John McEnroe and
Jimmy Connors, Lendl de
feated McEnroe in the semi
finals. He had also beaten
Gerulaitis earlier in the
week in the round-robin
portion of the tournament.
Gerulaitis fought off a
break point in the match's
first game and two break
points in the seventh game
before finding the strategy
he was to employ suc
cessfully through the first
half of the match.
Time and again, Gerulaitis
attacked Lendl's backhand
with slices. And time and
again, Lendl would either
put the ball into the net, hit
wide when he tried to go
down the line, or set up
Gerulaitis for put-away vol
leys.
The two went into the
first-set tiebreaker without a

loss of serve. But after Lendl
pulled ahead 4-3, Gerulaitis
reeled off four straight
points to win 7-5.
Gerulaitis then broke
Lendl to open the second
set, Lendl double-faulting
to give Gerulaitisthe advan
tage, then netting his
backhand for the game. The
New Yorker broke Lendl
again inthe sixth game, then
held serve to take a two-set
lead.
