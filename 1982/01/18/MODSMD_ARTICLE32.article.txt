# Cardinal matmen slip to Fresno St. Bulldogs
## 
### Andrew Messing 
The Stanford matmen lost
their third dual meet this
season Saturday to a potent
Fresno State team by a score
of 16-27.
Senior Tim Daniels
opened up the match with a
14-7 decision, putting the
Cardinal ahead by a score of
3-0.
Daniels' only loss this sea
son has been to arch-rival
Ashian Tevexier, a cham
pion wrestler from San Fran
cisco State. Daniels has been
showing more promise with
each match, and is the key
wrestler in the lighter
weights for Stanford.
Unfortunately, the
Cardinal lost the next four
matches in a row, and suf
fered a 21-point setback as a
result.
But things were far from

over for the Cardinal. At 169
pounds, Tom Mullen won
an 8-1 decision that sig
nalled a Stanford comeback
in the wings.
Two consecutive wins
prior to Mullen's victory
seemed to indicate some
momentum for the
Cardinal: team stalwart
Doug Perkins triumphed at
190-pounds, and freshman
Ed Katz also came through
at heavy-weight.
However, Stanford had to
forfeit in the 179-pound
division, and that point-loss
combined with the earlier
defeats at the hands of the
Bulldogs proved to be an in
surmountable deficit, so
finally the Cardinal was not
able to muster enough
points for team victory.
Perkins, the first Stanford
wrestler in 14yearsto win an
individual championship —

at the prestigious Munby
Tournament — won his
match against Bulldog
Malcolm Scott by a major
decision, the strongest
Cardinal victory of the day.
Perkin's win raised his ov
erall record to 10-1, and his
unorthodox style has gained
him recognition as one of
the best wrestlers on the
West coast.
Katz, Stanford's outstand
ing freshman, won the
heavy-weight match by pin
ning Tim Hawler of Fresno
State in 2:18. It was Katz'first
match since he suffered a
rib injury at the Munby In
vitational.
He has won four of his five
matches on the season, two
of which were pins.
The team's next match is
against Ohio State, to be
held at UC-Davis this Satur
day..
