## 
### Jack Clark 
Using speed and endurance,
the Stanford men's rugby team
humiliatd UC-Santa Cruz 47-6
Saturday at Harry Maloney
Field, improving it's record to
2-0 for the season.
The team comes off a highly
successful but disappointing
1981 season, in which the
Cardinal went 7-0 and gained a
No. 1 national ranking at one
point. However, a hard-fought
loss to a physical Brigham
Young University team in the
Western Regional playoffs kept
them from reaching the col
legiate championships.
With returning starters Pete
Frost, Td Eigner, Frank Hicks,
Rich Bridgeford and Dave An
drews in the backfield, along
with Rick Putnam and Keller
Strother in the scrum and a tal
ented group of others, the
squad is optimistic about this
year's campaign for the title.
Senior Ned Fleming and
sophomore Dave Andrews led
the balanced Stanford scoring
attack with 12 and 13 points re
spectively. Most of the
Cardinal scores came out of
smooth passestothewings,but
on the eighth try of the game,
forward Strother plowed in
from the ten yardline to cap a
beautiful 50-yard play.
Head coach Tom O'Grady
was generally pleased with his

team's performance.
"They showed signs of
playing complete rugby in the
second half," he said. "But we
are still not tight enough in the
set scrum. And we are not in
good enough shape."
Led by Morgan L. Morgan
and Craig Albrieght, the Stan
ford second team was also vic
torious, as it crushed the Santa
Cruz second team 39-0.
Expecting a far more com
petitive opponent, Stanford
will travel to St. Mary's college
thissaturdayforit's next match.
