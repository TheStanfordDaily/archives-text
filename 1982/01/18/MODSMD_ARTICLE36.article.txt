Walesa may be freed
London — Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will
be freed "in the very near future" and martial
law will be lifted in two or three weeks, Poland's
ambassador to Britain said yesterday. Officials
in Warsaw reportedly said the ambassador was
mistaken.
Ambassador Stefan Staniszewski told re
porters at London's Heathrow Airport he had
"good news about Lech Walesa." Staniszewski
was at the airport to meet his wife, who was re
turning from Warsaw.
"The decision has been made," he said. "He
is going to be released in the very near future. I
cannot tell you the exact day, but it will be
soon."
Staniszewski's comments were not reported
by Radio Warsaw or other official Polish news
media but were broadcast into Poland by
Western stations. An official at the press center
in Warsaw declined yesterday afternoon tocon
firm or deny the ambassador's statements.
Later, a Polish government official denied
that Walesa's release was imminent, Britain's In
dependent Television Network reported. The
network said the official, whom it did not iden
tify, said the "ambassador was wrong."
West Germany's national radio station,
Deutschlandfunk, reported that a spokesman
for Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski denied
Staniszewski's statement, offering no explana
tion but saying he "had been empowered" to
issue the denial.
The ambassador's estimate of when martial
law would end also seemed to contradict Polish
government spokesman Jerzy Urban, who on
Saturday said military rule would remain in
force until the conditions that led to its imposi
tion had been eliminated.
Campaign coffers swell
Orlando, Fla. — The Republican Party and
friendly interest groups plan to pour $500,000
into campaigns against each of 40 incumbent
Democratic congressmen this year, but the
GOP has all but given up hope of taking over
the House, the new White House political di
rector said Saturday.
In an attempt to lower election expectations,
Ed Rollins said the party has gained House seats
only once in 18 off-year elections when it had a
Republican president.
"I'm not going to sit up here and say we're
going to win the House," Rollins said.
The White House, he said, plans to "throw all
our resources" into campaigns against 40 Dem
ocratic House members, whom he did not iden
tify.
To gain control of the House, the Re
publicans would need to pick up 26 seats.
Democrats now outnumber Republicans, 243
to 192, in the House but the Republican Party
has assembled an unprecedented war chest and
a sophisticated campaign apparatus to reduce
that margin.
Rollins said he expects friendly independent
political action committees will donate an addi
tional $500,000 in each of the 40 targeted races.
Rollins said he expects Democrats to match
Republicans dollar for dollar in many races.
There is no limit to how much money a con
gressional candidate can receive.
Rollins, who succeeded Lyn Nofziger as polit
ical director, made his comments at a southern
Republican leadership conference here in
which an undercurrent of fears about the na
tion's economy dampened otherwise op
timistic election-year hopes.
The Reagan administration sent three Cabi

net members, Interior Secretary James Watt, La
bor Secretary Raymond Donovan and Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr., White House chief of staff James
Baker 111, and national party chairman Richard
Richards here to give pep talks to the party loy
alists.
But persistent questions about unemploy
ment, high interest rates and Reagan's econom
ic program kept cropping up.
Some of the most pointed remarks came from
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), coauthor of the
Kemp-Roth tax cut bill and a long-time Reagan
supporter.
In private meetings with state party leaders,
Kemp directed harsh criticism at budget direc
tor David Stockman and his budget projections.
In public, he was somewhat muted. But in a
speech Saturday morning, Kemp called for res
ignation of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker and criticized those in the adminis
tration who have been lobbying for tax in
creases.
No oil price hikes forseen
Nicosia, Cyprus — There can be no "real price"
increase in crude oil until demand picks up and
coal ceases to be competitive, possibly not until
the 19905, Saudi Arabia's oil minister said in an
interview published Monday.
Oil minister Ahmed Yamani was quoted in
Middle East Economy Survey, a weekly oil jour
nal, as saying a strong economic recovery
would have to precede a substantial price hike.
However, he did not rule out smaller increases
to offset inflation.
Yamani said the price of medium and heavy
types of crude oil may be cut this year.
"Even with the severe winter we are having
right now, which creates a high demand for oil,
I think we still have some room for further cuts
in the prices of heavy and medium crudes. This
will become evident sometime during the sum
mer of 1982 when demand for fuel oil will be
lower," he was quoted as saying.
Yamani said he thinks the current "soft" mar
ket for oil will continue into the second half of
the year. He said the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has two choices in 1982: it
can either continue the current price freeze
beyond the end of the year or raise prices slight
ly to compensate for inflation.
Asked about pricing philosophy within
OPEC, Yamani said 1981 tayght the cartel a valu
able lesson about flexibility.
"During 1979 and part of 1980 .. .we were
almost intoxicated by the fact that we could
raise our prices as we wanted, so it took us some
time to get over this," he said.
Gas bills could skyrocket
Washington — Consumers could end up
paying $18 billion more for their natural gas bills
over the next three years because of a proposed
action by a little-known government com
mission, a consumer group charged yesterday.
The Energy Action Project said that a proposal
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
threatens to hike the average residential bill by
$35 a year on top of 20 percent annual increases
already projected.
Congress in the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act
set up a seven-year timetable for price controls
to be lifted on certain categories of natural gas.
In addition, Congress gave the commission
authority to speed up decontrol if it determined
such action would prompt further exploration
in "high-risk" areas.

Weapons deployment studied
Washington — The Army is studying the
feasibility of putting chemical warheads on
ground-launched cruise missiles of the kind
now scheduled to be based in Western Europe,
according to recently released congressional
testimony.
The cruise missile, with a range of 1,500 miles,
is one of a number of weapons being studied as
possible carriers of a controversial new gener
ation of binary chemicat munitions, according
to the testimony.
By law, President Ronald Reagan must certify
to Congress that production of new chemical
weapons is in the national interest. Although he
has not yet done so, the Pentagon has received
White House approval for more than $1 billion
in the fiscal 1982 and 1983 budgets that would
allow one kind of chemical weapon — the first
new nerve gas artillery shell — to be turned out
in fiscal 1984.
A Reagan decision to resume building
chemical weapons could set off new political
turmoil in the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion, since these weapons would be primarily
designed for use in Western Europe.
At a hearing before the House Appropria
tions subcommittee on defense last September,
Maj. Gen. Niles Fulwyler, director of the Army's
nuclear and chemical weapons directorate, said
that the concern of the NATO governments
over chemical weapons "derives in a great deal
from the civilian population. If chemicals are
used, the civilian population would be greatly
affected. Neither we nor they provide protec
tion to the civilians."
The Pentagon maintains a stockpile of aging
chemical weapons in West Germany and the
United States. They are of an old design that has
the nerve gases and other chemicals already
mixed.
The new binary weapons are considered safer
by Pentagon officials since their two non-lethal
chemicals that make upthe eventual toxicor in
capacitating agent are not mixed together until
the weapon is fired.
Subway service resumes
Washington — Full subway service was
scheduled to resume yesterday through the
tunnel beneath the Washington Mall where a
packed rush-hour train was backed into a pillar
in an accident that killed three passengers, tran
sit officials said Saturday.
Workers succeeded in cutting apart and haul
ing away the damaged subway car earlier than
expected and started tests of the power and
communications systems, said Cody Pfanstiehl,
spokesman for the Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority.
Four downtown subway stations had been
closed since Wednesday's accident, adding to
transportation difficulties caused by salvage op
erations a mile and a half away at the site of an
airliner crash in the Potomac River that killed 78
people the same day.
Before it plunged into the river, the plane
struck the 14th Street Bridge, a major artery to
the Virginia suburbs.
The bridge was closed for inspection and re
pairs. The last closed lanes were re-opened Sat
urday afternoon.
Today's weather
Unsettled weather today and tomorrow with
periods of showers likely. Lows in the 30s to
night. Highs in the low to mid 50s.

In public, he was somewhat muted. But in a

No oil price hikes forseen
Nicosia, Cyprus — There can be no "real price"
increase in crude oil until demand picks up and
coal ceases to be competitive, possibly not until
the 19905, Saudi Arabia's oil minister said in an
interview published Monday.
Oil minister Ahmed Yamani was quoted in
Middle East Economy Survey, a weekly oil jour
nal, as saying a strong economic recovery
would have to precede a substantial price hike.
However, he did not rule out smaller increases
to offset inflation.
Yamani said the price of medium and heavy
types of crude oil may be cut this year.
"Even with the severe winter we are having
right now, which creates a high demand for oil,
I think we still have some room for further cuts
in the prices of heavy and medium crudes. This
will become evident sometime during the sum
mer of 1982 when demand for fuel oil will be
lower," he was quoted as saying.
Yamani said he thinks the current "soft" mar
ket for oil will continue into the second half of
the year. He said the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has two choices in 1982: it
can either continue the current price freeze
beyond the end of the year or raise prices slight
ly to compensate for inflation.
Asked about pricing philosophy within
OPEC, Yamani said 1981 tayght the cartel a valu
able lesson about flexibility.
"During 1979 and part of 1980 .. .we were
almost intoxicated by the fact that we could
raise our prices as we wanted, so it took us some
time to get over this," he said.
Gas bills could skyrocket
Washington — Consumers could end up
paying $18 billion more for their natural gas bills
over the next three years because of a proposed
action by a little-known government com
mission, a consumer group charged yesterday.
The Energy Action Project said that a proposal
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
threatens to hike the average residential bill by
$35 a year on top of 20 percent annual increases
already projected.
Congress in the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act
set up a seven-year timetable for price controls
to be lifted on certain categories of natural gas.
In addition, Congress gave the commission
authority to speed up decontrol if it determined
such action would prompt further exploration
in "high-risk" areas.

Weapons deployment studied
Washington — The Army is studying the
feasibility of putting chemical warheads on
ground-launched cruise missiles of the kind
now scheduled to be based in Western Europe,
according to recently released congressional
testimony.
The cruise missile, with a range of 1,500 miles,
is one of a number of weapons being studied as
possible carriers of a controversial new gener
ation of binary chemicat munitions, according
to the testimony.
By law, President Ronald Reagan must certify
to Congress that production of new chemical
weapons is in the national interest. Although he
has not yet done so, the Pentagon has received
White House approval for more than $1 billion
in the fiscal 1982 and 1983 budgets that would
allow one kind of chemical weapon — the first
new nerve gas artillery shell — to be turned out
in fiscal 1984.
A Reagan decision to resume building
chemical weapons could set off new political
turmoil in the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion, since these weapons would be primarily
designed for use in Western Europe.
At a hearing before the House Appropria
tions subcommittee on defense last September,
Maj. Gen. Niles Fulwyler, director of the Army's
nuclear and chemical weapons directorate, said
that the concern of the NATO governments
over chemical weapons "derives in a great deal
from the civilian population. If chemicals are
used, the civilian population would be greatly
affected. Neither we nor they provide protec
tion to the civilians."
The Pentagon maintains a stockpile of aging
chemical weapons in West Germany and the
United States. They are of an old design that has
the nerve gases and other chemicals already
mixed.
The new binary weapons are considered safer
by Pentagon officials since their two non-lethal
chemicals that make upthe eventual toxicor in
capacitating agent are not mixed together until
the weapon is fired.
Subway service resumes
Washington — Full subway service was
scheduled to resume yesterday through the
tunnel beneath the Washington Mall where a
packed rush-hour train was backed into a pillar
in an accident that killed three passengers, tran
sit officials said Saturday.
Workers succeeded in cutting apart and haul
ing away the damaged subway car earlier than
expected and started tests of the power and
communications systems, said Cody Pfanstiehl,
spokesman for the Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority.
Four downtown subway stations had been
closed since Wednesday's accident, adding to
transportation difficulties caused by salvage op
erations a mile and a half away at the site of an
airliner crash in the Potomac River that killed 78
people the same day.
Before it plunged into the river, the plane
struck the 14th Street Bridge, a major artery to
the Virginia suburbs.
The bridge was closed for inspection and re
pairs. The last closed lanes were re-opened Sat
urday afternoon.
Today's weather
Unsettled weather today and tomorrow with
periods of showers likely. Lows in the 30s to

Walesa may be freed
London — Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will
be freed "in the very near future" and martial
law will be lifted in two or three weeks, Poland's
ambassador to Britain said yesterday. Officials
in Warsaw reportedly said the ambassador was
mistaken.
Ambassador Stefan Staniszewski told re
porters at London's Heathrow Airport he had
"good news about Lech Walesa." Staniszewski
was at the airport to meet his wife, who was re
turning from Warsaw.
"The decision has been made," he said. "He
is going to be released in the very near future. I
cannot tell you the exact day, but it will be
soon."
Staniszewski's comments were not reported
by Radio Warsaw or other official Polish news
media but were broadcast into Poland by
Western stations. An official at the press center
in Warsaw declined yesterday afternoon tocon
firm or deny the ambassador's statements.
Later, a Polish government official denied
that Walesa's release was imminent, Britain's In
dependent Television Network reported. The
network said the official, whom it did not iden
tify, said the "ambassador was wrong."
West Germany's national radio station,
Deutschlandfunk, reported that a spokesman
for Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski denied
Staniszewski's statement, offering no explana
tion but saying he "had been empowered" to
issue the denial.
The ambassador's estimate of when martial
law would end also seemed to contradict Polish
government spokesman Jerzy Urban, who on
Saturday said military rule would remain in
force until the conditions that led to its imposi
tion had been eliminated.
Campaign coffers swell
Orlando, Fla. — The Republican Party and
friendly interest groups plan to pour $500,000
into campaigns against each of 40 incumbent
Democratic congressmen this year, but the
GOP has all but given up hope of taking over
the House, the new White House political di
rector said Saturday.
In an attempt to lower election expectations,
Ed Rollins said the party has gained House seats
only once in 18 off-year elections when it had a
Republican president.
"I'm not going to sit up here and say we're
going to win the House," Rollins said.
The White House, he said, plans to "throw all
our resources" into campaigns against 40 Dem
ocratic House members, whom he did not iden
tify.
To gain control of the House, the Re
publicans would need to pick up 26 seats.
Democrats now outnumber Republicans, 243
to 192, in the House but the Republican Party
has assembled an unprecedented war chest and
a sophisticated campaign apparatus to reduce
that margin.
Rollins said he expects friendly independent
political action committees will donate an addi
tional $500,000 in each of the 40 targeted races.
Rollins said he expects Democrats to match
Republicans dollar for dollar in many races.
There is no limit to how much money a con
gressional candidate can receive.
Rollins, who succeeded Lyn Nofziger as polit
ical director, made his comments at a southern
Republican leadership conference here in
which an undercurrent of fears about the na
tion's economy dampened otherwise op
timistic election-year hopes.
The Reagan administration sent three Cabi

net members, Interior Secretary James Watt, La
bor Secretary Raymond Donovan and Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr., White House chief of staff James
Baker 111, and national party chairman Richard
Richards here to give pep talks to the party loy
alists.
But persistent questions about unemploy
ment, high interest rates and Reagan's econom
ic program kept cropping up.
Some of the most pointed remarks came from
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), coauthor of the
Kemp-Roth tax cut bill and a long-time Reagan
supporter.
In private meetings with state party leaders,
Kemp directed harsh criticism at budget direc
tor David Stockman and his budget projections.
In public, he was somewhat muted. But in a
speech Saturday morning, Kemp called for res

affected. Neither we nor they provide protec
tion to the civilians."
The Pentagon maintains a stockpile of aging
chemical weapons in West Germany and the
United States. They are of an old design that has
the nerve gases and other chemicals already
mixed.
The new binary weapons are considered safer
by Pentagon officials since their two non-lethal
chemicals that make upthe eventual toxicor in
capacitating agent are not mixed together until
the weapon is fired.
Subway service resumes
Washington — Full subway service was
scheduled to resume yesterday through the
tunnel beneath the Washington Mall where a
packed rush-hour train was backed into a pillar
in an accident that killed three passengers, tran
sit officials said Saturday.
Workers succeeded in cutting apart and haul
ing away the damaged subway car earlier than
expected and started tests of the power and
communications systems, said Cody Pfanstiehl,
spokesman for the Washington Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority.
Four downtown subway stations had been
closed since Wednesday's accident, adding to
transportation difficulties caused by salvage op
erations a mile and a half away at the site of an
airliner crash in the Potomac River that killed 78
people the same day.
Before it plunged into the river, the plane
struck the 14th Street Bridge, a major artery to
the Virginia suburbs.
The bridge was closed for inspection and re
pairs. The last closed lanes were re-opened Sat
urday afternoon.
Today's weather
Unsettled weather today and tomorrow with
periods of showers likely. Lows in the 30s to
night. Highs in the low to mid 50s.

Walesa may be freed
London — Solidarity leader Lech Walesa will
be freed "in the very near future" and martial
law will be lifted in two or three weeks, Poland's
ambassador to Britain said yesterday. Officials
in Warsaw reportedly said the ambassador was
mistaken.
Ambassador Stefan Staniszewski told re
porters at London's Heathrow Airport he had
"good news about Lech Walesa." Staniszewski
was at the airport to meet his wife, who was re
turning from Warsaw.
"The decision has been made," he said. "He
is going to be released in the very near future. I
cannot tell you the exact day, but it will be
soon."
Staniszewski's comments were not reported
by Radio Warsaw or other official Polish news
media but were broadcast into Poland by
Western stations. An official at the press center
in Warsaw declined yesterday afternoon tocon
firm or deny the ambassador's statements.
Later, a Polish government official denied
that Walesa's release was imminent, Britain's In
dependent Television Network reported. The
network said the official, whom it did not iden
tify, said the "ambassador was wrong."
West Germany's national radio station,
Deutschlandfunk, reported that a spokesman
for Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski denied
Staniszewski's statement, offering no explana
tion but saying he "had been empowered" to
issue the denial.
The ambassador's estimate of when martial
law would end also seemed to contradict Polish
government spokesman Jerzy Urban, who on
Saturday said military rule would remain in
force until the conditions that led to its imposi
tion had been eliminated.
Campaign coffers swell
Orlando, Fla. — The Republican Party and
friendly interest groups plan to pour $500,000
into campaigns against each of 40 incumbent
Democratic congressmen this year, but the
GOP has all but given up hope of taking over
the House, the new White House political di
rector said Saturday.
In an attempt to lower election expectations,
Ed Rollins said the party has gained House seats
only once in 18 off-year elections when it had a
Republican president.
"I'm not going to sit up here and say we're
going to win the House," Rollins said.
The White House, he said, plans to "throw all
our resources" into campaigns against 40 Dem
ocratic House members, whom he did not iden
tify.
To gain control of the House, the Re
publicans would need to pick up 26 seats.
Democrats now outnumber Republicans, 243
to 192, in the House but the Republican Party
has assembled an unprecedented war chest and
a sophisticated campaign apparatus to reduce
that margin.
Rollins said he expects friendly independent
political action committees will donate an addi
tional $500,000 in each of the 40 targeted races.
Rollins said he expects Democrats to match
Republicans dollar for dollar in many races.
There is no limit to how much money a con
gressional candidate can receive.
Rollins, who succeeded Lyn Nofziger as polit
ical director, made his comments at a southern
Republican leadership conference here in
which an undercurrent of fears about the na
tion's economy dampened otherwise op
timistic election-year hopes.
The Reagan administration sent three Cabi

net members, Interior Secretary James Watt, La
bor Secretary Raymond Donovan and Housing
and Urban Development Secretary Samuel
Pierce Jr., White House chief of staff James
Baker 111, and national party chairman Richard
Richards here to give pep talks to the party loy
alists.
But persistent questions about unemploy
ment, high interest rates and Reagan's econom
ic program kept cropping up.
Some of the most pointed remarks came from
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), coauthor of the
Kemp-Roth tax cut bill and a long-time Reagan
supporter.
In private meetings with state party leaders,
Kemp directed harsh criticism at budget direc
tor David Stockman and his budget projections.
In public, he was somewhat muted. But in a
speech Saturday morning, Kemp called for res
ignation of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker and criticized those in the adminis
tration who have been lobbying for tax in
creases.
No oil price hikes forseen
Nicosia, Cyprus — There can be no "real price"
increase in crude oil until demand picks up and
coal ceases to be competitive, possibly not until
the 19905, Saudi Arabia's oil minister said in an
interview published Monday.
Oil minister Ahmed Yamani was quoted in
Middle East Economy Survey, a weekly oil jour
nal, as saying a strong economic recovery
would have to precede a substantial price hike.
However, he did not rule out smaller increases
to offset inflation.
Yamani said the price of medium and heavy
types of crude oil may be cut this year.
"Even with the severe winter we are having
right now, which creates a high demand for oil,
I think we still have some room for further cuts
in the prices of heavy and medium crudes. This
will become evident sometime during the sum
mer of 1982 when demand for fuel oil will be
lower," he was quoted as saying.
Yamani said he thinks the current "soft" mar
ket for oil will continue into the second half of
the year. He said the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries has two choices in 1982: it
can either continue the current price freeze
beyond the end of the year or raise prices slight
ly to compensate for inflation.
Asked about pricing philosophy within
OPEC, Yamani said 1981 tayght the cartel a valu
able lesson about flexibility.
"During 1979 and part of 1980 .. .we were
almost intoxicated by the fact that we could
raise our prices as we wanted, so it took us some
time to get over this," he said.
Gas bills could skyrocket
Washington — Consumers could end up
paying $18 billion more for their natural gas bills
over the next three years because of a proposed
action by a little-known government com
mission, a consumer group charged yesterday.
The Energy Action Project said that a proposal
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
threatens to hike the average residential bill by
$35 a year on top of 20 percent annual increases
already projected.
Congress in the 1978 Natural Gas Policy Act
set up a seven-year timetable for price controls
to be lifted on certain categories of natural gas.
In addition, Congress gave the commission
authority to speed up decontrol if it determined
such action would prompt further exploration
in "high-risk" areas.

Weapons deployment studied
Washington — The Army is studying the
feasibility of putting chemical warheads on
ground-launched cruise missiles of the kind
now scheduled to be based in Western Europe,
according to recently released congressional
testimony.
The cruise missile, with a range of 1,500 miles,
is one of a number of weapons being studied as
possible carriers of a controversial new gener
ation of binary chemicat munitions, according
to the testimony.
By law, President Ronald Reagan must certify
to Congress that production of new chemical
weapons is in the national interest. Although he
has not yet done so, the Pentagon has received
White House approval for more than $1 billion
in the fiscal 1982 and 1983 budgets that would
allow one kind of chemical weapon — the first
new nerve gas artillery shell — to be turned out
in fiscal 1984.
A Reagan decision to resume building
chemical weapons could set off new political
turmoil in the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion, since these weapons would be primarily
designed for use in Western Europe.
At a hearing before the House Appropria
tions subcommittee on defense last September,
Maj. Gen. Niles Fulwyler, director of the Army's
nuclear and chemical weapons directorate, said
that the concern of the NATO governments
over chemical weapons "derives in a great deal
from the civilian population. If chemicals are
used, the civilian population would be greatly
affected. Neither we nor they provide protec
tion to the civilians."
The Pentagon maintains a stockpile of aging
chemical weapons in West Germany and the
