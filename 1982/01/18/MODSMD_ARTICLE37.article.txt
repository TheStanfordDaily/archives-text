Friday's story about the defense
debate between SLAC Director Sid
Drell and Dr. Edward Tellerattributes
Drell as saying the only alternatives in
case of an attack by the Soviets are
surrender or a full-scale nuclear war.
This statement was unfortunately
taken out of context. The jist of what
Drell said , was that the NATO forces
should improve their conventional
capabilities so that in case of a con
ventional attack by the Soviets, they
may defend vital interests without

having to resort to surrender or a nu
clear response. The Daily regrets the
error.

yours, it will be mailed to your home
and likely reviewed by the same folks
to whom your "please send money"
letters are mailed.
