# Storms hinder airline rescue attempt, winter worst in years
## Wind, storms wreak havoc 
### Associated Press 
Powerful chinook winds gusting to
125 mph yesterday wrecked homes
artd businesses in Colorado while
persistent Siberian cold dropped
temperatures to all-time lows in
some Midwestern cities.
The death toll reached 261 in more
than a week of harsh winter weather,
called the coldest of the century.
The city of Milwaukee, at 26
degrees below zero, suffered its
coldest day since the weather service
started keeping records 111 years ago
as temperatures fell below zero from
Dixie to New England and across the
Midwest.
The mercury dipped to 22 below at
Akron, Ohio, breaking the all-time
record of minus 21 set in 1963.
Thousands of people were without
power and many highways were im
passable across the Midwest. Many
people spent the night in emergency
shelters.
The mercury hit five degrees
below zero in Washington for the
coldest day in the nation's capital in
48 years.
It was so cold in Embarrass, Minn.,
that the thermometer broke at 44
degrees below zero and the local
weather watcher could only estimate
the temperature at minus 52. Interna
tional Falls, Minn., had an official
reading of 45 degrees below zero.
In Chicago, where it was 23 below,
Mayor Jane Byrne ordered the city
parks department to open all field
houses as emergency shelters.
In New York City, where it was a
relatively mild one below, city of
ficials got 2300 complaints yesterday
morning from apartment dwellers
with no heat.
But in Colorado, it was like some
one turned on a giant blow dryer as
warm Chinook winds howled out of
the canyons on the eastern slopes of
the Rockies with destructive hur
ricane force, causing widespread
damage in the cities of Boulder and
Loveland.
Similar winds were gusting to 100
mph in neighboring Wyoming.
Power was out in most of Boulder,
a city of 75,000 residents about 20
miles northwest of Denver, where
some buildings under construction
were demolished, roofs, walls and
windows were torn from shopping
centers and streets were blocked by
debris.
In Loveland, 60 miles north of Den
ver, two small mobile homes were
knocked several yards off their foun
dations and three others, along with
two traditional houses, were serious
ly damaged. About 25 people had to
spend the night at friends' homes, ac
cording to Larimer County Sheriff
Sgt. Pat McCosh.
Officials closed a 30-mile section of
U.S. Highway 287 north of Longmont,

Colo., because power lines were
lying across the roadway.
The high winds, which warmed
Denver from 22 degrees at 1 a.m. to
56 degrees at 4:30 a.m., also flipped
over four single-engine planes at
Boulder Airport and left one Boulder
County sheriff's deputy with minor
injuries when the windshield of his
car blew out.
The National Weather Service
didn't get an official lowtemperature
reading Sunday from its reporting
station in Embarrass. It got so cold
that the thermometer broke.
Other cities reporting record
below zero readings included:
Duluth, Minn., 37 below; Green
Bay, Wis., 28 below; Toledo, Ohio, 17
below; Flint, Mich., 15 below; De
troit, 15 below; Lexington, Ky., 13
below; Charleston W. Va., 11 below;
Detroit 11 below; and Wilmington,
Del., 10 below.
