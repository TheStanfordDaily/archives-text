# Heavy rains flood Stanford golf course

Though Stanford suffered only mi
nor damages in the wake of heavy
rains two weeks ago, a landslide at
the golf course has closed the 14th
green until University officials can
evaluate the problem.
The landslide, which occurred last
week, washed four to six feet along
the top of the green into San Francis
quito creek, said Joe Carrington,
University water and sewer super
intendent.
"The green proper is okay," said
Tim Baldwin, assistant pro at the golf

course, "but the area in front (of the
green) is about to slide into the
creek."
Baldwin said golfers have been re
routed to a practice hole so a full 18
hole golf game can still be played. He
said he has received no complaints
from golfers, but there has been
some confusion among players as to
the course sequence of holes.
The landslide was triggered by
buildup of water pressure inside the
hillside due to the rains and from un
dercutting of the hill from rushing
creek waters along the hole, said Car

rington.
The slide also exposed part of a
pipeline beneath the hillside which
feeds Lake Lagunita. Any further
movement of the hillside will proba
bly rupture the pipeline, he said.
The gate at the entry to the
pipeline has been closed to prevent a
possible break from completely
washing away the hillside.
Lake Lagunita will be filled by ir
rigation waters from Felt Lake, which
was filled in the recent storm, via a
"blowoff" valve in the University ir
rigation system that connects to the

Lagunita pipeline near the stables.
Carrington said the hillside will
have to be replaced in order to re
open the 14th hole. "To fix it right
will not be cheap," he said.
Baldwin said, "The concern is that
the land is still moving. If the land
continues to move, we'll really be in
trouble."
Carrington said there has been no
other slide damage on campus. A
meeting today with the Office of
Maps and Records will determine
what needs to be done to buttress the
land and reopen the green.
