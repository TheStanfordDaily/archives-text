# Deep freeze delays efforts to raise jet

Washington (AP) â€” Faced with
sub-zero temperatures and biting
winds, recovery teams temporarily
abandoned efforts yesterday to raise
the tail section of an Air Florida jet
liner from under the frozen Potomac
River, delaying the investigation of
last week's air disaster in which 78
persons were killed when the plane
struck a crowded commuter bridge
spanning the Potomac and plunged
into the icy water.
Temperatures were minus five
degrees when the salvage operation
resumed at dawn on the ice-covered
river, and had risen to only seven
above at midafternoon.
"We're operating at best at 30 per
cent of what we were capable of
doing," Police Inspector James
Shugart, spokesman for the recovery
effort, told reporters near the re
covery site.
No additional victims were pulled
from the crumpled Boeing 737, al
though one diver at a time probed
the icy waters. Police spokesmen said
46 bodies had been recovered since
the salvage operation began.
Meanwhile, the National Trans
portation Safety Board continued in
vestigating other aspects of last
Wednesday's crash.
Maintenance records on the plane
were being examined and individ
uals who saw the plane shortly after it
took off from National Airport con
tinued to be interviewed.
At the same time, the question of
whether too much ice had ac
cumulated on the plane before
takeoff remained a subject of intense
interest for the federal investigators.
It was learned that Boeing Co., the
737's manufacturer, warned opera
tors of the plane last June to take cer
tain precautions because of a ten
dency of the aircraft to experience a
"severe roll. .. or pitch just after lif
toff" when there are icy conditions.
