## Soviet Jews face tightening emigration 
### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — After a decade in
which nearly 260,000 Jews were
allowed to leave the Soviet
Union, the authorities here
have reduced Jewish emigra
tion to a trickle, frustrating the
dreams of tens of thousands.
Many Soviet jews who have
applied to leave and have been
refused permission, have been
fired from their jobs or de
moted. Their children have
been barred from the better
universities and technical in
stitutes.
The KGB security police,
thought to be primarily re
sponsible for carrying out of
ficial policy toward Soviet Jews,
are conducting a nationwide
campaign to suppress informal
instruction in the Hebrew lan
guage — Hebrew is banned
from state schools — along
with other unofficial cultural
and religious activities among
Jews.
According to the National-
Conference on Soviet Jewry in
New York, only 434 Jews left
the Soviet Union last month,
bringing the 1981 total to 9447

— down about 80 percent from
the peak year of 1979, when
51,320 Jews were allowed to
emigrate. If the present month
ly number of departures is
maintained through 1982, the
total will drop by about half, to
5000 or fewer.

"The numbers are declining
dramatically," a respected fig
ure in Moscow's Jewish com
munity said.
Israeli officials have con
tended that the Soviets may
have decided to restrict emi

gration partly because many
Jews who apply to leave, os
tensibly to be reunited with
family members in Israel, go in
stead to the United States once
they receive Soviet exit visas.
The only basis for emigration
under Soviet law is the re-

unification of families. But in
1980, for example, Western fig
ures show that only 34 percent
of Jews leaving the Soviet
Union went to Israel, even
though most had applied to
leave using formal invitations
from family members in Israel.
With this "dropout" prob
lem in mind, Israel has urged
American Jewish groups to
curtail their assistance to emi
grating Soviet Jews who have
no relatives in the United
States, in the hope that fewer
will drop out of the stream to
Israel and Soviet restrictions
will be eased. •
The preponderance of evi
dence, however, suggests that
the Kremlin regards Jews and
other ethnic groups with rela
tives in the West largely as po
litical pawns, to be dealt with as
a way of rewarding and punish
ing selected Western coun
tries, depending on their at
titudes toward the Soviet
Union.
The flow of ethnic Germans
to West Germany, declined
during most of last year, then
surged last month, immediate
ly after President Leonid
Brezhnev's November con

ference in Bonn with Chan
cellor Helmut Schmidt, a meet
ing that Soviet officials con
sidered highly successful.
Figures for Jewish emigra
tion from the Soviet Union also
show a remarkably steady de
cline, one more consistent with
steady political pressure on the
West than with an abrupt de
termination that many Jews
were violating the terms of
their visas. From the peak of
51,320 in 1979, the number of
emigres dropped 58 percent,
to 21,471, in 1980 and another
56 percent in 1981 to 9447. Cur
rent monthly averages indicate
a similar percentage decline
for 1982.
The decline in the number of
visas granted to Jewish appli
cants began in the summer of
1979, about the time Moscow
apparently concluded that the
U.S. Senate would never ratify
the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty known as SALT 11.
Arab countries have com
plained to the Soviets that they
were bolstering the Israeli
economy with emigre scien
tists and technicians.
Two U.S. congressmen who
met recently with Alexander
Bovin, a senior commentator
for the government newspaper
Izvestia, said Bovin spelled out
a clear connection between
Jewish emigration policy and
Moscow's unhappiness with
the Reagan Administration.
The sharp restriction of Jew
ish emigration has been ac
companied by an intense, year
long, nationwide campaign by
the KGB to suppress unofficial
cultural, scientificand religious
activities by Jews.
In addition to nearly 30,000
families who have been re
fused once, Jewish sources es
timate that even under present
circumstances between
100,000 and 200,000 of the 1.8
million Jews counted in the
1979 census would apply to"
leave if they could obtain in
vitations.
