# Court ruling hits French plan
## 
### Washington Post 
Paris — France's highest constitutional
court ruled late Saturday that several impor
tant sections of the Socialist government's
bitterly disputed nationalization program are
unconstitutional.
The decision means President Francois Mi
tterrand and his Cabinet must make signifi
cant changes in the way they apply the cen
terpiece of their platform — the nationaliza
tion of eight key industries and 36 private
banks. The court's decision cannot be ap
pealed.
Although the ruling does not question the
nationalization program as a whole, it refuses
a plan forreimbursingstockholdersand takes
issue with the choice of banks to be na-,
tionalized, preventing Prime Minister Pierre
Mauroy from promulgating the new laws
next week as he had confidently predicted.
"This is a serious affair that requires a pro
found reexamination, not only judicial but
also political," said Pierre Joxe, head of the
Socialist Party caucus in parliament.
Mauroy's statement said, however, "The
government confirms its will to proceed with
the nationalizations that have been an
nounced. The Cabinet meeting Wednesday
will decide on what to do for a final vote of
the law in the briefest delays."
The ruling represented a setback for
Mauroy, in overall charge of the nationaliza

tions. On Thursday, he had predicted with
seeming confidence that he would get ap
proval from the court.
Conversely, the decision marks at least a
symbolic victory for the right-wing and cen
trist opposition that had vainly fought the na
tionalization laws in parliament, outnum
bered by a comfortable Socialist majority
backed by an allied Communist Party.
By ruling some provisions unconstitu
tional, the court legitimized some of the busi
ness community's complaints and lent
strength to opposition arguments that the
government is pushing ahead without
enough caution.
The court said the compensation levels for
nationalized businesses were unconstitu
tional "because of the unsatisfactory charac
ter of the evaluation method and failure to
take into account dividends on 1981 profits."
This means the government will have to re
vise its complicated compensation plans,
counting stockholders' claims to dividends
for last year's operations and payable this
year.
The Court also ruled unconstitutional the
choice of 36 major banks for nationalization,
saying an exclusion for cooperative banks
was unfair if these banks were similar in size
and operations to those picked for na
tionalization.
