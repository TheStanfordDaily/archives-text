## New ASSU limo service: cheap ride to the airport 
### Steve Mitchel 
The scenario is familiar: you need a ride to the
airport because you don't have a car or you want
to avoid the high cost of parking your car at the
airport over a long period of time. Cabs are ex
pensive, and dragging your luggage to the bus
terminal is not exactly your idea of the ideal way
to start a vacation.
According to Andy Midler, assistant ASSU fi
nancial manager, the new ASSU limousine ser
vice can provide a low-cost, convenient solution
to your problem.
"We did a marketing survey last May," said
Midler, "and we asked students to list the most
important services that the ASSU provided or
could provide. Transportation to the airport
came in fourth."
Originally, ASSU planned to operate the ser
vice through an existing carrier. But as Midler
explained, "The problem with the existing car
rier was that it only picked up at Hoover Tower.
To come to your dorm, they charged $20, and
that's no service.
Rather than using the carrier, ASSU decided to
charter directly from a private company, and
now use the San Francisco-based company Van
Trams. ASSU pays a flat rate for their vehicles,
which include station wagons, vans and 21-pas
senger buses, and sells tickets to students ($5 for
a ride to or from the airport).
The company receives a daily list from ASSU,
and picks up students at 11 different on-campus
locations. The service covers both the San Fran
cisco and San lose airports, and even makes one
run to Oakland. "There's a real popular World
Airways flight that gets into Oakland around
midnight. We pick that up because it's a pain to

coine all the way from Oakland that late at
night," said Midler.
Having completed its initial quarter of opera
tion, the service is already a big success, accord
ing to Midler. "We had about 3500 riders last
quarter," he said, "and we ended up making
about a 3 percent profit (roughly $300 to $400).
That's about what we wanted, since we're non
profit in spirit."
According to Midler, the money will go into
the limousine account this year to be used to
cover any unexpected future costs. "For exam
ple, we had one run to San Jose where only one
person was on the van. Obviously, in that kind of

situation, we'd take a loss," he explained. Any
remaining profits at the end of the year will go
into the ASSU general account.
Winter vacation proved to be the most popu
lar time for the service, with more than 900 using
it to and from the airport. According to Midler,
that tremendous popularity caused some prob
lems.
"The basic problem was that the system was
not equipped to handle the amount of people
that we had," he said.
However, Midler believes that the service
could have handled the large numbers if the
weather, which caused delays and resulted in
mobs of students waiting for rides on a limited
number of vans, had been less severe.
"A vehicle was only supposed to pick up a
load on every other run, but with the delays,
sometimes a driver would find 25 people waiting
for him. He'd have to get help from another van,
and the whole schedule would get thrown off,"
said Midler. As a result of the scheduling mix up,
some students faced delays of three or four
hours.
Midler said the ASSU is already taking steps to
prevent these types of problems in the future.
"First," he said, "we want to work with a bigger
company. One that has a lot of vehicles, a lot of
drivers and radio communication. We also want
to put somebody from the company at each ter
minal. And we are also going to mark our vehi
cles better. We want to get it to the point where
we don't have people saying, 'I had to wait too
long.' "
For the most part, according to Midler, the re
action to the limo service has been favorable.
Freshman Scott Newar, who used the service at
the end of fall quarter, said he was very pleased
with the operation. "It was on time, the guy was
out here before I was out with my bags, and he
was courteous as well. It worked out perfectly. I
had no complaints." ,
Heather Hawkins, who also used the service at
the end of fall quarter, was also very satisfied. "I

have a car here," she said, "but I didn't want to
leave it in the airport parking lot because it's too
expensive. So I'm sure I'll be using it again some
time."
The service has been so successful that Midler
said the ASSU plans to extend its range of ser
vices this quarter. Tentative plans include using
charters to take students to fraternity formals, or
to take groups on tours of the wine country.
There are even plans to take groups into San
Francisco on Saturday nights. "We'd have a drop
off at Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square, and
we'd pick people up at the end of the night,"
said Midler.
