# T.A.s find responsibilities rewarding

Being a teaching assistant (T.A.) can often be
an exhausting job, but most T.A.s find it a very
rewarding experience.
It's a chance to meet new people and a chance
to learn. "Working one-on-one with students is
my favorite part (of the job)/' said Julie Knier, a
biology T.A.
It's also a bit of an experiment, according to
some T.A.s. Not only can it test one's teaching
ability, but it can give one practice in, or steer
one away from a teaching career.
"After I served as a T.A. (for a second time) ev
erything came into balance," said Jim Conrad, a
political science T.A. "When I'menthusedabout
what I'm doing, it's really fun. It's a good feeling
when you're on top of a subject."
Since a working knowledge of the subject is
required, T.A.s are generally graduate students,
or students with graduate standing. Assigning a
student to a T.A. position is the result of a
mutually beneficial agreement based upon the
needs of the course and the professor, the stu
dent's qualifications and preferences, and the
department's budget and financial support
commitments.
The Center for Teaching and Learning offers
an orientation program for T.A.s at the begin
ning of autumn quarter. But the actual selection
and assignment of T.A.s, as well as their responsi
bilities, vary by department and by professor.
A T.A. may be assigned either to assist a pro
fessor with all of his or her courses, or to assist in
a specific course. Responsibilities range from
grading papers to teaching entire sections. Some
students hold "half-time" T.A. positions which
require extensive time commitments that re
strict students from carrying a full course load.
Students become T.A.s either because of de
partmental requirements or as a means of finan
cial aid.
There is a lot of responsibility and work as

sociated with being a T.A., and many find re
sponsibilities to be rewarding in the long run.
"In retrospect, I enjoyed it more than I did at the
time," Richard Gerring, a psychology T.A., remi
nisced.
Some T.A.s complained that they were not
being given enough guidance by the professors.
They resented being used as graders, and some
times found the time commitment to excessive.
"Around finals time, it's impossible. No one
realized that I had my own work to do. I ended
hiding," one T.A. said.
Prof. Ernest Chilton and Theresa Marie Rhyne,
a graduate student at the time, conducted an ex
tensive "T.A. survey" for the school of engineer
ing during the winter quarter of 1980. They
found that, overall, most T.A.s were enthusiastic
about, and happy with, their job.
Fourteen T.A.s, 27 professors, eight students,
and nine administrative and staff members, all
within the school of engineering, were in
terviewed in order to assess how well various de
partments were using their T.A.s, to collect sug
gestions for improvements and to hear what
people had to say.
Each unstructured interview took anywhere
from 20 minutes to two hours. The responses
were then analyzed "by hand." According to
Chilton, "It was an anthropological type of sur
vey, similar to studies done by Margaret Meade
... not really done in the social sciences
before."
The majority of the T.A.s who were in
terviewed just loved the job. "Even without the
pay I would still do it," said one. Most depart
ments in the school of engineering had de
veloped a T.A. program that served the needs of
the students, T.A.s and professors well.
Chilton said he would like to see all depart
ments at Stanford perform similar evaluations so
that the T.A.s may be used to their greatest
potential.
