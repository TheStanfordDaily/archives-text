## Editorial No tax cut for racists 
### 
The Reagan administration's recent about
face on the issue of tax exemptions for racially
discriminatory private schools renews fears
about the administration's insensitivity to racial
issues. This"reversal" seems halfhearted and
more a response to publicand Congressional
outcry than a reconsideration based on the
principles and discriminatory effects
involved.Claiming that the administrative
decision to grant the exemptions was
"misunderstood," President Ronald Reagan has
allowed that initial decision to stand while
supporting a bill by Senator Robert Dole (R —
Kansas) which would strip these institutions of
their newly-given tax free status.
Tax exemptions have been denied to schools
practicing racial discrimination under
Department of the Treasury regulations dating
back to the Nixon era. The rationale supplied by
administration apologists for invalidating these
restrictions is that only Congress should have
the power to determine who will and who will
not receive tax exemptions. This is either an
exceedingly disingenuous rationalization ora
more myopicexaltation of form oversubstance
than one would expect from the seasoned
political insiders closest to the president.
It is hard to believe that the administration
wanted to give Congress the credit for taking
away administration-sponsored tax subsidies
from openly racist schools. Surely those
responsible were aware of the substantive effect
of their decision to rescind the regulations.
The administration's lack of concern for the
principles involved in grantingtheexemptions
is illustrated in a comment by White House
Chief of Staff James Baker, who was not
consulted on the matter. Baker complained that
"none of the blacks in the administration was
asked his opinion, and if that had happened the
president would have been better advised."
Had the issue at hand been simply the
distribution of power between the executive
and legislative branches of government, the
race of the advisor would have been immaterial.
It should be immaterial in deciding whetheror
not to give tax subsidies to racist schools: Baker's
comment indicates that responsibility for
preventing racially discriminatory policies has
been shifted to minorities alone. Black and
white advisers should be equally capable of
telling the president that a decision to grant tax
exempt status to racist schools would be morally
wrong and constitutionally impermissible.
The administration has already received
justified criticism for increasing defense
spending and tax benefits tothe rich while
reducing the federal role in programs designed

to benefit minorities. This tax exemption,
however, goes one step further. Tax exemptions
actually transfer money out of the public
revenue base to the (non)taxpayer. That an
administration dedicated to reducing public
expenditures should in effect subsidize racist
institutions is a violation of the public financial
trust as well as a slur upon the conscience of a
nation that shudders against a current
recrudescence of racial hatred.
Many of the affected schools are run under
the auspices of various fundamentalist Christiar
religous organizations, which justify
discriminatory policies as part of their religous
teachings. They and other proponents of the
exemptions argue that to grant tax exemptions
to some religous schools and not to others
constitutes an unwarranted government
interference with freedom of religion.
The effect of the tax exemptions looks all the
more ominous when one recognizes that many
of the beneficiaries are staunch Reagan
supporters and firm members oftheNew Right
coalition. By sticking by its initial decision while
paying lip service tothe Dole bill, the Reagan
administration looks like a little boy caught with
his hand in the cookie jar and protesting that he
didn't mean to take any.
This argument mischaracterizes both the
meaning of religous freedom and the nature of
federal tax policy. Exemptions are special
privileges, exceptions to the general rule that all
income received by organizations and
individuals under federal jurisdiction is subject
to taxation at a progressive rate. The rescinded
Treasury Department regulations merely
withhold this privilege from a narrowly defined
category of institutions which, but for the
regulations, might be eligible fortax-exempt
status. The regulationsdo not punish individuals
for their beliefs, dictate that certain beliefs be
held, or interfere in the internal administration
of any religous organization — the traditional
and well-considered tests for unwarranted
government intrusion intothe religous sphere.
Neither lack of coordination in the White
House or any of the specious rationalizations
offered justify or excuse tax exemptions to
racially discriminatory private schools. We are
confident that Congress will act quickly enough
to deny these schools any benefit from the
administration's ill-considered course of action.
In the meantime, the exemptions represent a
travesty to the millions of white and nonwhite
citizens who recognize racism, no less than
despotism, as the very antithesis of the
American ideal of equality under law.

Chief of Staff James Baker, who was not
consulted on the matter. Baker complained that
"none of the blacks in the administration was
asked his opinion, and if that had happened the
president would have been better advised."
Had the issue at hand been simply the
distribution of power between the executive
and legislative branches of government, the
race of the advisor would have been immaterial.
It should be immaterial in deciding whetheror
not to give tax subsidies to racist schools: Baker's
comment indicates that responsibility for
preventing racially discriminatory policies has
been shifted to minorities alone. Black and
white advisers should be equally capable of
telling the president that a decision to grant tax
exempt status to racist schools would be morally
wrong and constitutionally impermissible.
The administration has already received
justified criticism for increasing defense
spending and tax benefits tothe rich while
reducing the federal role in programs designed

to benefit minorities. This tax exemption,
however, goes one step further. Tax exemptions
actually transfer money out of the public
revenue base to the (non)taxpayer. That an
administration dedicated to reducing public
expenditures should in effect subsidize racist
institutions is a violation of the public financial
trust as well as a slur upon the conscience of a
nation that shudders against a current
recrudescence of racial hatred.
Many of the affected schools are run under
the auspices of various fundamentalist Christiar
religous organizations, which justify
discriminatory policies as part of their religous
teachings. They and other proponents of the
exemptions argue that to grant tax exemptions
to some religous schools and not to others
constitutes an unwarranted government
interference with freedom of religion.
The effect of the tax exemptions looks all the
more ominous when one recognizes that many
of the beneficiaries are staunch Reagan
supporters and firm members oftheNew Right
coalition. By sticking by its initial decision while
paying lip service tothe Dole bill, the Reagan
administration looks like a little boy caught with
his hand in the cookie jar and protesting that he
didn't mean to take any.
This argument mischaracterizes both the
meaning of religous freedom and the nature of
federal tax policy. Exemptions are special
privileges, exceptions to the general rule that all
income received by organizations and
individuals under federal jurisdiction is subject
to taxation at a progressive rate. The rescinded
Treasury Department regulations merely
withhold this privilege from a narrowly defined
category of institutions which, but for the
regulations, might be eligible fortax-exempt
status. The regulationsdo not punish individuals
for their beliefs, dictate that certain beliefs be
held, or interfere in the internal administration
of any religous organization — the traditional
and well-considered tests for unwarranted
government intrusion intothe religous sphere.
Neither lack of coordination in the White
House or any of the specious rationalizations
offered justify or excuse tax exemptions to
racially discriminatory private schools. We are
confident that Congress will act quickly enough
to deny these schools any benefit from the
administration's ill-considered course of action.
In the meantime, the exemptions represent a
travesty to the millions of white and nonwhite
citizens who recognize racism, no less than
despotism, as the very antithesis of the
American ideal of equality under law.
The Reagan administration's recent about
face on the issue of tax exemptions for racially
discriminatory private schools renews fears
about the administration's insensitivity to racial
issues. This"reversal" seems halfhearted and
more a response to publicand Congressional
outcry than a reconsideration based on the
principles and discriminatory effects
involved.Claiming that the administrative
decision to grant the exemptions was
"misunderstood," President Ronald Reagan has
allowed that initial decision to stand while
supporting a bill by Senator Robert Dole (R —
Kansas) which would strip these institutions of
their newly-given tax free status.
Tax exemptions have been denied to schools
practicing racial discrimination under
Department of the Treasury regulations dating
back to the Nixon era. The rationale supplied by
administration apologists for invalidating these
restrictions is that only Congress should have
the power to determine who will and who will
not receive tax exemptions. This is either an
exceedingly disingenuous rationalization ora
more myopicexaltation of form oversubstance
than one would expect from the seasoned
political insiders closest to the president.
It is hard to believe that the administration
wanted to give Congress the credit for taking
away administration-sponsored tax subsidies
from openly racist schools. Surely those
responsible were aware of the substantive effect
of their decision to rescind the regulations.
The administration's lack of concern for the
principles involved in grantingtheexemptions
is illustrated in a comment by White House
Chief of Staff James Baker, who was not
consulted on the matter. Baker complained that
"none of the blacks in the administration was
asked his opinion, and if that had happened the
