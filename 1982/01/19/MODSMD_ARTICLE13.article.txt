## Levy tax on Social Security 
### 
The best way to solve the short
term funding crisis of the Social Se
curity system is to include Social Se
curity benefits in taxable income. Net
outflows from the Social Security
trust funds would be reduced be
cause the taxes could be transferred
to the trust funds from the Treasury;
yet a well-designed system would not
harm the poorer elderly and would
not be unfair to any retired person.
It would, in addition, undo the ef
fect of the Social Security legislation
that, in the early 19705, increased
substantially the transfer of income
from the young to the elderly and
caused the funding crisis. The pro
posal, therefore, should command
the support of the Administration
because the security net of the needy
would remain in place even as the
unfair results of past policy are re
duced.
A good tax program would exempt
from taxation part of the Social Secur
ity benefits so that, when the person
al exemption and standard deduc
tion are added in, retirees whose
only income is Social Security bene
fits would pay no tax. Retirees with
substantial outside income would
pay tax, but the outside income in
sures that reducing the Social Secur
ity benefits would not cause econom
ic hardship.
Two main objections are made to

the proposal. First, benefits should
not be taxed because the contribu
tions to Social Security come from af
ter-tax income. Taxing benefits
would then amount to double taxa
tion. Second, taxing benefits is the
same thing as reducing benefits, but
benefits should not be reduced be
cause they are an earned right. These
objections, however, are not valid.
It is true that contributions come
from after-tax income, but benefits
are far greater than contributions,
and underourtax laws the difference
between the two should be taxed.
For example, a man who retired in
1978 and paid the maximum con
tribution to Social Security during his
working life, paid only $4807 in total
contributions; yet if he lives to his life
expectancy 15.8 years and inflation is
eight percent, he will draw about
$141,000 in benefits.
Of course, the reason total benefits
are so much larger than contribu
tions is that no adjustment was made
for inflation; but our income tax laws
require that this dollar difference be
taxed. Suppose, for instance, one
holds an asset that appreciates at ex
actly the rate of inflation. Capital
gains tax must be paid on the dollar
capitalgain, notthe gain in excess of
inflation. This is a defect in the tax
law.
The second objection is that bene

fits are an earned right and should
not be reduced. But, from 1968
through 1972 Congress increased
benefits much faster than the growth
of income. One result of this gener
osity is that everyone who is currently
retired will, if he lives to his life ex
pectancy, receive benefits that are
substantially greater than what he
would be entitled to had his con
tributions been invested and ac
cumulated with interest.
Because of the age distribution of
the population a fundamental re
form of the Social Security system is
required over the long run. But the
short-term funding crisis can be met
by taxing benefits. The argument is
not that all gains should be taxed
away. The argument is that a substan
tial fraction of benefits have not been
earned in an economic sense and
that it is not unfair to reduce some
benefits.
By subjecting benefits to the Fed
eral income tax the windfall gains of
the well-to-do elderly could be re
duced without touching the benefits
of the poorer elderly. We could pre
serve the Social Security system, give
back to everyone now retired more
than he put into the system, and
maintain a decent standard of living
for all beneficiaries.

pay tax, but the outside income in
sures that reducing the Social Secur
ity benefits would not cause econom
ic hardship.
Two main objections are made to

the proposal. First, benefits should
not be taxed because the contribu
tions to Social Security come from af
ter-tax income. Taxing benefits
would then amount to double taxa
tion. Second, taxing benefits is the
same thing as reducing benefits, but
benefits should not be reduced be
cause they are an earned right. These
objections, however, are not valid.
It is true that contributions come
from after-tax income, but benefits
are far greater than contributions,
and underourtax laws the difference
between the two should be taxed.
For example, a man who retired in
1978 and paid the maximum con
tribution to Social Security during his
working life, paid only $4807 in total
contributions; yet if he lives to his life
expectancy 15.8 years and inflation is
eight percent, he will draw about
$141,000 in benefits.
Of course, the reason total benefits
are so much larger than contribu
tions is that no adjustment was made
for inflation; but our income tax laws
require that this dollar difference be
taxed. Suppose, for instance, one
holds an asset that appreciates at ex
actly the rate of inflation. Capital
gains tax must be paid on the dollar
capitalgain, notthe gain in excess of
inflation. This is a defect in the tax
law.
The second objection is that bene

fits are an earned right and should
not be reduced. But, from 1968
through 1972 Congress increased
benefits much faster than the growth
of income. One result of this gener
osity is that everyone who is currently
retired will, if he lives to his life ex
pectancy, receive benefits that are
substantially greater than what he
would be entitled to had his con
tributions been invested and ac
cumulated with interest.
Because of the age distribution of
the population a fundamental re
form of the Social Security system is
required over the long run. But the
short-term funding crisis can be met
by taxing benefits. The argument is
not that all gains should be taxed
away. The argument is that a substan
tial fraction of benefits have not been
earned in an economic sense and
that it is not unfair to reduce some
benefits.
By subjecting benefits to the Fed
eral income tax the windfall gains of
the well-to-do elderly could be re
duced without touching the benefits
of the poorer elderly. We could pre
serve the Social Security system, give
back to everyone now retired more
than he put into the system, and
maintain a decent standard of living
for all beneficiaries.
