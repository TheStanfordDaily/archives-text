## Government control overacademia: how much is too much? 
### 
These days, it seems as if the gov
ernment is everywhere. Federal rules
and regulations circumscribe daily
life, directing and influencing behav
ior. It would be nigh imposible to go
through one day without coming
into contact, either directly or in
directly, with the effects of some fed
eral directive.
Instead of a chicken in every pot,
the philosophy is a finger in every
pie. Even the most basic of human
functions — eating and drinking —
are affected by regulation. The pa
rade of regulatory agencies isendless
— a veritable alphabet of acronyms:
EPA, FCC, FJC, ICC, NLRB, SEC . ..
The list is endless.
These agencies serve mainly to
protect us from ourselves. In our
highly mechanized society, there
must be some central arbitrator.

Without this centralized federal con
trol, public welfare could be sacri
ficed to the profit motive. Even the
government, however, can overstep
its bounds.
Recently, the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) issued a memo
randum to Stanford, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Ohio State,
Wisconsin, and Auburn Universities
concerning the proposed visit of a
Soviet scholar.
The memorandum relays State De
partment instructions for restrictions
on Nikolay Umnov, a scholar in ro
botics. The State Department was
concerned that information vital to
national security would be threat
ened by Umnov's visit. They re
quested that Umnov not be allowed
to visit any industries and be shown
only documents available to the gen

eral public.
The State Department's juris
diction over the matter came
through the Export Control Act. This
act of Congress seeks to prevent the
dissemination of vital information
and technology abroad. It essentially
represents the central government's
recognition that ideas may be the
most powerful weapons in our
arsenal.
The plot thickens at this point. It
just so happens that the Defense De
partment contributes one-sixth
(more than $20 million) of Stanford's
scientific research budget. This fiscal
reality gives the government some
measure of control over University
actions. That power has yet to be ex
ercised. Federal funding supports a
large proportion of the pure research
done in universities. Without this

magnanimity, Stanford could not af
ford the excellence of its current re
search.
Umnov's area of expertise is the
field of robotics, or walking ma
chines. It is estimated that the Soviets
are five to 10 years ahead of the Unit
ed States in this science. Prof. James
Roth, department of mechanical en
gineering, said the Russians "have
got much better stuff in Leningrad
than we'll ever have." It seems that
much of the State Department's con
cern is based on xenophobia.
The restrictions were relayed by
the NAS. The Academy is a legally in
dependent organization, with no
business passing on State Depart
ment instructions. Furthermore, the
restriction and regulation of foreign
scientists is a State Department func
tion, not the concern of a private uni

versity.
Without a doubt, information and
research that is classified as vital to
national security must be protected.
No country can expect to allow de
fense information to be a matter of
public record. Certain restrictions
and limitations guard against whole
sale technology swaps among coun
tries. However, it is Stanford Univer
sity's stated policy not to undertake
classified research.
Umnov's visit could represent a
break away from the Adminis

tration's isolationist stance on the
free flow of information. The ex
change of ideas between nations is
perhaps more important than na
tional defense. The first step in un
derstanding is communication. Um
nov's visit at least is an attempt by sci
entists to establish a "common made
of discourse," which is more than the
current administration can say for
itself.

Without this centralized federal con
trol, public welfare could be sacri
ficed to the profit motive. Even the
government, however, can overstep
its bounds.
Recently, the National Academy of
Sciences (NAS) issued a memo
randum to Stanford, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Ohio State,
Wisconsin, and Auburn Universities
concerning the proposed visit of a
Soviet scholar.
The memorandum relays State De
partment instructions for restrictions
on Nikolay Umnov, a scholar in ro
botics. The State Department was
concerned that information vital to
national security would be threat
ened by Umnov's visit. They re
quested that Umnov not be allowed
to visit any industries and be shown
only documents available to the gen

eral public.
The State Department's juris
diction over the matter came
through the Export Control Act. This
act of Congress seeks to prevent the
dissemination of vital information
and technology abroad. It essentially
represents the central government's
recognition that ideas may be the
most powerful weapons in our
arsenal.
The plot thickens at this point. It
just so happens that the Defense De
partment contributes one-sixth
(more than $20 million) of Stanford's
scientific research budget. This fiscal
reality gives the government some
measure of control over University
actions. That power has yet to be ex
ercised. Federal funding supports a
large proportion of the pure research
done in universities. Without this

magnanimity, Stanford could not af
ford the excellence of its current re
search.
Umnov's area of expertise is the
field of robotics, or walking ma
chines. It is estimated that the Soviets
are five to 10 years ahead of the Unit
ed States in this science. Prof. James
Roth, department of mechanical en
gineering, said the Russians "have
got much better stuff in Leningrad
than we'll ever have." It seems that
much of the State Department's con
cern is based on xenophobia.
The restrictions were relayed by
the NAS. The Academy is a legally in
dependent organization, with no
business passing on State Depart
ment instructions. Furthermore, the
restriction and regulation of foreign
scientists is a State Department func
tion, not the concern of a private uni

versity.
Without a doubt, information and
research that is classified as vital to
national security must be protected.
No country can expect to allow de
fense information to be a matter of
public record. Certain restrictions
and limitations guard against whole
sale technology swaps among coun
tries. However, it is Stanford Univer
sity's stated policy not to undertake
classified research.
Umnov's visit could represent a
break away from the Adminis

tration's isolationist stance on the
free flow of information. The ex
change of ideas between nations is
perhaps more important than na
tional defense. The first step in un
derstanding is communication. Um
nov's visit at least is an attempt by sci
entists to establish a "common made
of discourse," which is more than the
current administration can say for
itself.
