## Kappa Sigs uphold values, moral belief 
### 
The recent decision by the Kappa
Sigma national fraternity to suspend
the charter of Stanford Kappa Sigmas
presents us with an opportunity to
reaffirm the principles of subjectively
selective groups here. It is also an oc
casion to give public honor and rec
ognition to a fraternity that took a
sound moral position (refusal to
swear falsely to a statement many
members did not accept) and stuck
to it in the face of strong outside
pressures.
The University's central expecta
tion of any subjectively selective stu
dents group that has or is seeking
University recognition is that the
group must be free of external con
trol in matters of membership selec
tion and group governance.
While many universities, and many
fraternal organizations, continue to
play an in loco parentis role, Stanford
views students as responsible adults
capable of making decisions for
themselves and accepting the conse
quences of those decisions. That phi
losophy extends to student groups,
whose members are expected to
govern their collective behavior in
accordance with the principles em
bodied in the University's Fun
damental St ndard.

Some national fraternal organiza
tions find it hard to understand that,
while we encourage them to offer
advice and counsel to their Stanford
chapters, we draw the line short of
controlling the decisions of Stanford
students.
Fraternities here have continued
to be a part of Stanford life to a large
extend because they reflect the val
ues, beliefs, and attitudes prevalent
at the University and not because of
unquestioning adherence to a set of
strictures established by individuals
who have no affiliation with the Uni
versity.
We regret that the current mem
bers of Kappa Sigma have had to suf
fer the loss of an association that they
valued but at the same time we feel
great pride in their willingness to
stand firm for their principles and to
assert their independence from ex
ternal control.

Rhodes scholars
We were delighted to see the re
cent article (Daily, Jan. 5) announcing
Mark Kramer's selection as a Rhodes
Scholar. However, we were con

cerned about several inaccuracies in
the article that might discourage
prospective applicants.
Most importantly, the university
does not "select" anyone to partici
pate in the scholarship competition.
The Overseas Resource Center be
gins publicizing both the Rhodesand
Marshall Scholarships in early spring
quarter each year. We encourage all
interested students to consider ap
plying for both awards as the terms
and application process are similar.
Marshall applicants must receive
university endorsement based on a
preliminary written application and a
campus interview. Rhodes can
didates do not need endorsement
but should submit preliminary ap
plications to the campus committee
The Rhodes and Marshall Scholar
ships provide excellent op
portunities for graduate study in Brit
ain. Even those candidates who are
unsuccessful feel that the application
process in itself is a valuable ex
perience.
We want to clarify that the Over
seas Resource Center staff members
and the Rhodes/Marshall panelists
are committed to identifying and en
couraging more Stanford aDDlicants
and to giving them our full support.

Tucson!
As a longtime resident of Tucson,
Arizona, I am becoming quite ir
ritated at the frequency with which
the Daily misspells the name of my
city. I would have thought that a rep
utable university like Stanford could
find a newspaper staff that could at
least spell the names of cities correct
ly.
Wrong. Almost every time the
word Tucson appears in the Daily it is
spelled with the "s"first. "Cardinal to
travel to Tuscon," said a football sea
son headline. In the swimming article
of Jan. 15, the word is misspelled
twice. I have no idea as to why this
happens, maybe it is spelled correctly
at first, and the proofreader goes
back and changes it.
All I know is that it makes the
"Stamford Daily" look like a sloppily
run organization.
