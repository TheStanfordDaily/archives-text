Elvis Costello and the Attractions
The Sports Arena/Los Angeles
29 December 1981
Elvis Costello, the iconoclast's iconoclast.
More than any other member of the new
wave Class (for want of a better term) of 1977,
Declan McManus (I can't resist ratting on his
real name) has depended on being misun
derstood as a vital component of his appeal.
Anyone who sings "When I said I was lying I
might have been lying" (as on "The Im
poster" from Get Happy!!) obviously isn't to
be trusted and enjoys it that way. Adding to
the El's mystique is the somewhat chancy ex
perience of hearing him perform live —
stories of 45-minute sets and chillingly terse
stage movements fill the hearts and minds of
the nearly 20,000 occupants of Beetles and
Dusters and Mustangs and Volvos filling the
Sports Arena Garage of No Return in antici
pation of Costello's only 1982 show west of
the Mississippi.
Even so, I can't help remembering Elvis'
last show in San Francisco in January 1981,
where he seemed cordial and friendly (and
very very fat) while premiering the songs
from Trust. There, the immediacy of the
songs seemed to belie the opacity of the lyr
ics — "Clubland's" smoky cabaret piano in
particular sounding a simultaneous death
knell for angry-young-mannerisms and a
dinner bell for accessibility.
Over the holidays in Los Angeles, Costello
continued the trend of gentility by treating
the enthusiastic audience to a 2 1 /2-hour

show of the material that established him as
the most sophisticated songwriter to emerge
from — or is that help define? — the new
wave influence on pop music. Indeed, he in
troduced one of his songs to the crowd by
saying, "This one's for you who we love so
much." Truly Elvis' legendary distaste for au
diences has become a thing of the past — can
this be the same Costello who refused to talk
between songs, hurrying through per
formances so he could go backstage and
concentrate on his prolific songwriting out
put?
Though kinder to his concert audiences,
Costello has retained the creative tensions
and bitter edges that motivate him to write
songs with less of a passion than a ven
geance. While focusing on the distaff side of
romance and breakup, Costello does not in
dulge in either the manic screams and anar
chic yelps that lesser musicians call rebellion
or the maudlin sentiment that others call ro
mance.
Almost as if to emphasize this point, Elvis
has been spending an inordinate amount of
time recently indulging his love of country
music, devoting all of his latest album,
Almost Blue, to his versions of others' coun
try standards. While the record itself isn't
great — the arrangements lack a certain
punch that hits from all over on Elvis' other
works, and the steel guitar (provided by the
Doobies' John McFee, who played guitar on
My Aim is True) has never been a favorite —
the motivations behind it make the slab of
wax interesting as a cultural artifact. The rea
soning of Almost Blue could be the same as
why there are no restrooms in banks — it

runs into money. Now that Elvis Costello is
considered a hot item, he has the chance to
experiment and fantasize to his heart's con
tent, for us ignorant slobs will pay to hear
him all the same.
Indeed, many have voiced fears that the
El's preoccupation with country music on
Almost Blue signals an end to his creativity
and sophistication. However, the Los Angel
es show proved them wrong. Indeed, Cos
tello may be only beginning to mature as a
performer. In "I'm Your Toy," an old Gram
Parsons ballad, he even sings the line, "I
wouldn't lie — you know I'm notthat kindof
guy." Hmm. Either that's more ambiguity
than I care to discuss, or there's a softening in
the maturing punk. I'm inclined toward the
latter view.
In another act of maturity (and common
sense), Elvis acknowledged that many of
those present were not there to hear his
country songs by asking the audience to sit
back and relax through his first, almost en
tirely country set (the most notable excep
tion was a rousing opening of "Watching the
Detectives") and that he would come back
to play a second set of traditional Costello fa
vorites. But even during the less conven
tional songs, Costello marked himself as a
vocal stylist with few peers. His performance
of "Almost Blue," with its languorous piano
background and smoke-and-bourbon lyrics,
was so stunning as to belie the image of
country songs as simplistic paeans to rustic
values of rural ignorance. Costello managed
to take the traumatic power of a song like
"Alison" and magnify it through Almost
Blue's country idiom, as if the distinction be-

tween the uncommon despair of the lyrics
and the common, familiar musical patterns
did not offset each other but rather em
phasized the feeling behind Costello's mas
terful vocal performance. It is no wonder
that Costello, a kid who used to sing as funny
as he looks, has as his country heroes stars
like George Jones, for whom the lyrics and
music of any particular song were always in
cidental to the power of an emotion-laden
voice.
Costello's vocal mastery was not limited to
the country portion of the show. He sang his
old songs, from Get Happy!! and Armed
Forces and My Aim is True, with a sense of
clarity and attack that improved even on the
familiar recorded versions of those songs.
His new material — he performed at least an
hour's wo/th of songs written since the re
lease of Almost Blue only four monthsago —
seemed written to take advantage of this

newfound concentration on voice while re
taining Costello's clever and imaginative lyr
icism. Unfortunately, much of the audience
will have to await Costello's next album to
fully appreciate the new lyrics — the
cavernous Sports Arena swallowed much of
the nuance and crispness that mark his
songs.
The sound problems were not fully re
solved until Costello's third and final encore.
Perhaps his business manager told him that
since fans were now paying $8 to $12 a ticket
instead of the $3 shows in the
late '70s, he had to play longer than he used
to. Still, Costello seemed to be motivated less
by financial responsibility than
by a general desire to keep the fun and mag
ic rolling. At one point in the encore, the
arena house lights came up, flooding the en
tire scene in brightness and briefly lending a
high-school-gym-sock-hop atmosphere to
what was truly a holiday occasion.
In any event, the final encore improved on
the first two in sound quality, length (four
songs instead of two), and impeccable selec
tion of songs. Elvis and the Attractions got
everyone dancing with his early "Red
Shoes", then settled into a treatment of
"Alison" that would bring tears to a stone.
Not one to leave on a sorrowful note, Cos
tello swung into "Mystery Dance" — a song
he can still do and leave no one unsatisfied.
In anticipation of the New Year, Elvis Cos
tello left a parting message to Los Angeles:
"What's So Funny About Peace, Love, and
I Understanding?" The answer? Nothing, and
there's no better songwriter in popular mu
sic today.
