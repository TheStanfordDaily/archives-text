In 1967, the Beatles ori
ginated the term "art-rock" by
putting out the Sgt. Pepper
album. It was quite different in
contrast with the music that
would be labeled "art-rock" in
the 19705, but its innovative or
chestration and instrumenta
tion and rich lyricism paved the
way for the art-rock bands to

come. As early as 1968, The
Moody Blues had put out Days
of Future Passed, the first of a
long line of art-conceived
albums. Many more groups
would emerge in the early '70s
as a combination of hard rock
with arty lyricism, such as Em
erson, Lake and Palmer, and
Genesis. However, the two
most popular art-rock bands in
the 70s would be groups that
initially were formed in the late
'60s aftermath of Sgt. Pepper.
These two groups were Pink
Floyd and Yes.
Personally, I am not a strong
advocate of the art-rock genre.
On too many occasions the
need to be arty has led to "arty
overkill," which leads to the lis
tener's displeasure. One only
has to listen to King Crimson's
In the Court of the Crimson

King, or half of the Emerson,
Lake and Palmer catalog before
you have to ask yourself what
ever happened to albums that
were understandable without
massive amounts of LSD.
Thankfully for me, Pink
Floyd and Yes have each re
leased a greatest hits package
that avoids the arty excess that
both groups have at one point
in their careers fallen party to.
Instead, these albums em-

phasize each group's most
straightforward rock songs,
thusmakingthemeach group's
most accessible and listenable
albums.
First off, the Pink Floyd pack
age is sarcastically titled A Col
lection of Great Dance Songs,
since the songs are hardly typi
cal of those songs labeled
"danceable." As a group, Pink
Floyd evolved from a late-'6os
drug demented, psychedelic
bunch into the most popular
band to mix straight ahead rock
and roll with arty lyricism and
sound effects. Therefore, this
album concentrates not on the
group's early spaced-out art
rock but on their more recent
rocking albums of the 70s.
As the album contains only
six cuts, there is not time for
any filler material. Instead, vye
get the driving rock instrumen
tal "One of These Days" and
the beautiful jazz-influenced
art-rock of "Shine On Your
Crazy Diamond" (from Med

die and Wish You Were Here,
respectively). Even the lyrics of
the songs are not too mind-ex
panding, as they reflect the
pessimistic and violent attitude
that Pink Floyd has continually
showcased in their latter-day
albums. We can see this best on
the musically excellent "An
other Brick in the Wall, Part 2,"
"Wish You Were Here," and
"Money" (which is a newly
recorded version of that classic

song), as their lyrics are easily
comprehensible as protests
against the inherent dangers of
a cruel outside world. The mu
sic, therefore, is a means of es
cape from the confines of ev
eryday rules and regulations in
order to shake loose these
destructive chains.
Yes is the other popular band
that emerged from the late '60s
art-rock movement. On their
album, Classic Yes, we are giv
en a broad range of Yes's
best material plus a bonus sin
gle of rousing live versions of
the group's classics, "Round
about" and "I've Seen All
Good People." Like Pink
Floyd's, the Yes album em
phasizes their best straight rock
songs, tes' lyrics may at times
be more arty and complex than
Pink Floyd's but the richness of
the tunes themselves keeps the
lyrics from becoming obstruc
tive.
The songs found on this
album are more arty in a sense

than Floyd's, because they
make a greater use of in
strumentation and orchestra
tion. This need for greater or
chestration has eventually led
the group to unproductive arty
failures (i.e. Tales from Topo
graphic Oceans), but on this
greatest hits package, we get
the best-orchestrated cuts
from the group's best albums
â€” Fragile, The Yes Album,
Close to the Edge, and Going
For the One. On this album's
cuts, therefore, the rich or
chestration leads to an uplift
ing, mystical quality in the
songs. Instrumentally, Chris
Squire's prominent bass in
combination with the high har
monies of lan Anderson and
Rick Wakeman's floating key
boards, turn most of the cuts
into celestial adventures. The
hard art-rock of "Long Dis
tance Runaround" and "Yours
Is No Disgrace" is excellently
contrasted with the ethereal
beauty of "Wonderous
Stories" and"And You and I,"
and both styles of music suc
ceed.
Therefore, by keeping Yes
arty weaknesses to a minimum
(as was done with Pink Floyd),
the listener is not subjected to
any arty excess at all. These two
packages therefore show that
straight rock and arty effects
can be combined successfully
to create an excellent art-rock
sound. Therefore, on a person
al level, I am forced to con
cede that art-rock can be just as
uplifting and engaging as the
best straight-ahead rock of my
own personal taste. If you have
any doubts (as I did) about this,
give these albums a try. You
may be surprised.

The other day I was listening
to KZSU with a girlfriend of
mine. We were talking about
the plight of rock music from
the '50s through the '60s and
70s, and what was to be in store
for the '80s. Her argument cen
tered around the fact that rock
had lost its freshness and in
nocence ever since the late '50s
when Buddy Holly died, Elvis
went into the army, and Chuck
Berry was thrown in jail. Al
though I tried to prove that the
Beatles and Stones had only ex
panded on the initial format of
