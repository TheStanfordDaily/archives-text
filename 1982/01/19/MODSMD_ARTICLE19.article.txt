# Genesis just not the same

Those of us weaned on early
70s Genesis know better than
to rush right out and buy the
latest release from the boys —
it's just not the same anymore.
All of you who have been
swept away by the adventures
of Rael or the lawnmower
know what I'm talking about.
I mean, since Peter left the
band, there is no more colony
of Slipper Men, no more bat
tles between heaven and hell,
and definitely no more
shooby-doobies. What's a guy
to do?
So, of course, I ran right out
and bought the new Genesis
album. I suppose I hold within
my being a tiny little grain of
hope for a return to the old
ways. But alas.. .we get the
Earth, Wind, and Fire horn sec
tion. C'mon guys, a boogie
tune on a Genesis album? It's
like Frank Sinatra doing Prince.
Don't get me wrong, "No Re
ply At All" is a good tune, but
anybody with a couple of horns
could do it. Only Genesis can
do Genesis.
What we have here are three
incredibly talented, technically
brilliant musicians and song
writers who have the potential
to play music like no one else.
Thing is, they could play like
Zeppelin, they could play like
the Stones, and goodness

knows they could play like
Journey, and at the risk of los
ing my head, I'd say they could
probably do it better than all
three. Fortunately, with all due
respect, they don't try to play
like any of those bands.
What Genesis has done is fall
into a rather formulaic pattern
of producing albums with just
enough elements of the old to
keep the faithful happy, com
bined with poppish accessibili
ty and hooks to gather in a new
audience which I'm afraid does
include many pre-pubescent
females. That's the price of suc
cess, I suppose.
So what about the matter at
hand, the new album Abacab.
0.K., here goes. Side One: title
track rock? with the best of
them, "No Reply At All"
boogies with the best of them,
"Me. and Sarah Jane" sounds
like Phil Collins' solo album,
"Keep It Dark" is really dumb.
Side Two: "Dodo/Lurker"
sounds good, but I haven't real
ly figured out what they're
saying yet, "Who Dunnit" is a
waste of time, "Man on the
Corner" is a fine bit of social
commentary, "Like It or Not" is
a grand Michael Rutherford
ballad, and finally "Another
Record": really dumb.
Do I like the album? Well,
that's like asking Oedipus if he
likes his mom. The album is
okay, but I wish we could go
back about 10 years and start
over again.
Actually, I like Abacab an
awful lot; what I'm afraid of is

not liking it a month from now.
What separates old Genesis
music from the new is its lasting
value. Before Peter Gabriel left,
and even on the band's first
album after his departure,
Genesis music was an adven
ture — sort of the Tolkien of
rock. I still go nuts when I hear
Tony Banks' piano intro on
"The Lamb Lies Down on
Broadway," or when Gabriel
matter of factly states, on "Sell
ing England By the Pound,"
that "me, I'm just a lawn
mower, you can tell me by the
way I walk." That's the stuff

classics are made ofl So, natu
rally, their biggest hit until
"Abacab" was a ballad titled
"Your Own Special Way." It's a
nice tune but.. .oh, never
mind.
So go out and get a copy of
Abacab if you can. Genesis
freak from ages ago or not, I
don't think you'll be disap
pointed. You'll find three in
credible musicians at work
here, as well as a finely pro
duced album. Besides, it's bet
ter than 90 percent of ev
erything else on the record
shelves these days.
