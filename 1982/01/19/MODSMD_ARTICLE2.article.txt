# SLAC submits revisions to neighbors

Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter (SLAC) officials held a public
meeting last night to reassure area
residents that a plan to redesign the
new Stanford Linear Collider would
not spoil the landscape.
Residents objected to the fact that
the initial collider plans called forthe
location of the underground half
mile diameter ring and an access
road adjacent to Alpine Road, a large
experimental hall to be located atop
a scenic hillside, and for the destruc
tion of 50 oak trees. The plans were
unveiled at a similar meeting last
March.
"We got a real earful at that first
meeting, and learned a lot about
SLAC's problems with its neighbors,"
Dr. Burton Richter, Nobel laureate
and collider project leader, said.
"As a result, we've done a major
redesign," Richter said. The ex
perimental hall is now below the
crest of the hill and its top will be the
only part of the project visible from
Alpine or Sand Hill Roads or nearby
residential areas. Access will be
through existing SLAC roads and
only two trees will be lost.
However, the collider will now
tunnel 20-50 feet below a small park
at the entrance to the Stanford Hills
residential area off Sand Hill Road.
In response to one resident's ques
tion about radiation exposure to chil
dren playing in the park, Richter
maintained that the increase from
the new collider would be less than
the minimum measurable increment
of 10 milliroentgens a year more than
the 80-100 area residents currently
experience.
Most of the 30 or so residents at
tending the meeting seemed satis
fied with the changes and SLAC's ef
forts to be a better neighbor.
Maureen Sollman, a resident of Stan
ford Hills, said "I feel better because
Richter has made a big effort to be

honest."
There was a complaint about
SLAC's failure to provide landscaping
as promised around an existing build
ing, however.
Construction isscheduledto begin
in 1983 if final approval is obtained
from the Department of Energy,
which will fund the $87 million
project.
This project is the third in a series
which collide beams of electrons and
positrons, or anti-electrons, gener
ated by the linear accelerator. When
a collision takes place the particles
annihilate, leaving behind an in
termediate state of pure energy. This
energy then quickly rematerializes
into combinations of subnuclear par
ticles.
The collider will achieve a collision
energy of up to to 100 GeV (billion
electron volts) compared to 36 GeV
for the Positon Electron Project (PEP),
completed in 1980.
Scientists expect that at this energy
level they can demonstrate that two
fundamental forces of the universe,
electromagnetic force and the "weak
interaction" are the same.
The new collider differs from PEP
and a previous system, SPEAR, in that
it is not a storage ring and therefore is
more power efficient at higher col
lision energies.
Nevertheless, when the linear col
lider is completed, SLAC as a whole
will consume 90 megawatts of power
during peak operation. About 179
million gallons of water, about 13
percent of the Menlo Park Water De
partment's capacity, will be used an
nually, primarily for cooling.
As for the future, one resident
asked if "as the years pass we are
going to have more of SLAC around
and under us?"
Richter responded "Will there be a
need for a next step? Yes. Will it fit
here? I don't know. But if so, in 5-10
years we'll have another meeting."

through existing SLAC roads and
only two trees will be lost.
However, the collider will now
tunnel 20-50 feet below a small park
at the entrance to the Stanford Hills
residential area off Sand Hill Road.
In response to one resident's ques
tion about radiation exposure to chil
dren playing in the park, Richter
maintained that the increase from
the new collider would be less than
the minimum measurable increment
of 10 milliroentgens a year more than
the 80-100 area residents currently
experience.
Most of the 30 or so residents at
tending the meeting seemed satis
fied with the changes and SLAC's ef
forts to be a better neighbor.
Maureen Sollman, a resident of Stan
ford Hills, said "I feel better because
Richter has made a big effort to be

honest."
There was a complaint about
SLAC's failure to provide landscaping
as promised around an existing build
ing, however.
Construction isscheduledto begin
in 1983 if final approval is obtained
from the Department of Energy,
which will fund the $87 million
project.
This project is the third in a series
which collide beams of electrons and
positrons, or anti-electrons, gener
ated by the linear accelerator. When
a collision takes place the particles
annihilate, leaving behind an in
termediate state of pure energy. This
energy then quickly rematerializes
into combinations of subnuclear par
ticles.
The collider will achieve a collision
energy of up to to 100 GeV (billion
electron volts) compared to 36 GeV
for the Positon Electron Project (PEP),
completed in 1980.
Scientists expect that at this energy
level they can demonstrate that two
fundamental forces of the universe,
electromagnetic force and the "weak
interaction" are the same.
The new collider differs from PEP
and a previous system, SPEAR, in that
it is not a storage ring and therefore is
more power efficient at higher col
lision energies.
Nevertheless, when the linear col
lider is completed, SLAC as a whole
will consume 90 megawatts of power
during peak operation. About 179
million gallons of water, about 13
percent of the Menlo Park Water De
partment's capacity, will be used an
nually, primarily for cooling.
As for the future, one resident
asked if "as the years pass we are
going to have more of SLAC around
and under us?"
Richter responded "Will there be a
need for a next step? Yes. Will it fit
here? I don't know. But if so, in 5-10
years we'll have another meeting."

plans for a proposed Linear Collider addition to the plant.
