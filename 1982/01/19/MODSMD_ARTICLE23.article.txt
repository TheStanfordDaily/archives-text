# Singing the Christmas-movie blues
## 
### 
I can't remember a gloomier
Christmas for movie lovers.
Aside from Pennies from
Heaven, I didn't see a single
memorable film; I wasn't sur
prised to read that box office
sales were historically disap
pointing and audiences were
sticking to Reds and Time Ban
dits and deserting the new crop
of pictures. Time Bandits may
be a small movie, but when
you've sat through Neighbors,
Modern Problems, Taps,
Heartbeeps, Ghost Story, and
Shock Treatment ,you can easi
ly become nostalgic about a
film that displays both a little
narrative imagination and a
slightly offbeat sense of humor.

On advice, I caught a pair of
movies that had vanished
quickly on their initial release
last summer — The Great Mup
pet Caper and The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia —
and were now making the
rounds on the lower half of
double bills, and derived more
pleasure from them than from
almost any of the Christmas re
leases, though strictly speaking
neither is very good. However,
The Great Muppet Caper has a
fairly sustained musical-spoof
buoyancy, and The Night the
Lights Went Out has a trio of
unaffected, absolutely believ
able performers (Dennis
Quaid, Kristy McNichol, and

Mark Hamill) who set up such
an easy rapport that you actual
ly go home thinking about the
characters. All I thought about
after Taps was how bad the
young actors' diction was and
how shamelessly the director,
Harold Becker, had manipu
lated the audience.
I'd happily trade all of
Modern Problems for one
number in The Great Muppet
Caper in which Miss Piggy stars
in a burlesque of old Esther
Williams musicals. There are
only two funny bits in Modern
Problems, and they are both
very brief: the opening scene,
in which zonked-out air traffic
controllers bungle their way
through a busy afternoon, and
a take-off on Manhattan that
has Dabney Coleman as a self
important pop psychologist
standing on a beach in a flow
ing white bathrobe reciting a
list of his favorite things into a
tape recorder. Couldn't three
writers — Tom Sherohman,
Arthur Sellers, and the direc
tor, Ken Shapiro — think of
more than two funny ideas?
That's two-thirds of a good
thought per writer. I'd like to
know which one was respon
sible for the central plot device
— the telekinetic powers
which Chevy Chase is blessed
and cursed with when a truck
sprays an unidentified green
substance into his face.
The pieces of Carrie and Al
tered States and A Star Is Born
that float through this picture
might passas parody, but isn't it
rather early to rework ideas
from other comedies like The
Incredible Shrinking Woman
and Modern Romance that are
less than a year old — even if
nobody went to see those mov
ies? Chase's affliction is a vari
ation on Lily Tomlin's in Shrink
ing Woman, and the bare
bones of the plot, about
Chase's on-again, off-again af
fair with Patti D'Arbanville and
his fits of jealousy, exactly par

allel Modern Romance (which
was infinitely funnier). Chevy
Chase is such an unsurprising
comedian — at least on the big
screen — that everything he
does seems familiar anyway.
He's also the most passive of
leading men; he's extremely
amiable, but one can't help
feeling that he'd be more fun
to get drunk with than to watch
in a movie.
Dabney Coleman has the
comic spring Chase lacks, and
his introduction as the author
of the bestselling books Gef
Behind Me and Stay There and
You Are Who You Lay is prom
ising, but the writers have neg
lected to work out a philoso
phy for this character, and so
Coleman hasn't anything to
play. If fact, the movie can't
seem to make up its mind how
to deal with him: he's an object
of ridicule until Chase turns his
powers on him — in a long
scene that can't have been
meant to be as unpleasant as it
is — and then, if I'm reading
the film correctly, we're sup
posed to feel sorry for Cole
man. Even more bewildering
— and much more offensive —
is the treatment given to Nell
Carter, the explosive star of
Broadway's Ain't Misbehavin'.
Carter plays a Haitian house
keeper who speaks a brand of
English that harkens back to
Aunt Jemima, keeps voodoo
dolls and white mice in her
room, and in one terribly em
barrassing scene executes a
tribal dance while dusting the
floor around Chevy Chase's
bed with white demon
powder. I don't know a black
person who wouldn't be ap
palled by the conception of
this character. This whole mov
ie looks like it was made under
the influence of white demon
powder.

There's a perverse quality to
Francois Truffaut's recent mov
ies — a resistance to the poten

tial in them for great filmmak
ing. The Woman Next Door
could have been a first-rate
movie, I think, and it keeps
threatening to turn into one,
but Truffaut seems to be so
much in love with the com
monplace elements in the story
that he refuses to rise above
them. The Woman Next Door
concerns a pair of ex-lovers,
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant),
both now married, who re
sume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into
a house next door to Bernard's.
It's Noel Coward's Private Lives
with an extra comic-romantic
kicker: these two are so com
pletely engrossed in their de
sire for each otherthatthey de
stroy themselves with it, as the
Isabelle Adjani character did in
Truffaut's phenomenal The
Story of Adele H. The Woman
Next Door is reminiscent of
Adele H., especially in his use
of Fanny Ardant in some se
quences, but the dialogue (by
Truffaut and Suzanne Schif
fman and Jean Aurel) is frustrat
ingly earthbound, and the
direction rarely moves far
beyond banality.
Fanny Ardant has high, full
cheeks and a too-pronounced
nose; her face is too wide, and
in the late scenes, when her
neurotic lovesickness drives
her into the hospital, she man
ages to look gaunt and fleshy at
the same time. Her unusual
looks hold the camera, and so
does the intensity of her acting,
which is full of high spots and
yet never quite clinches — it's
more the promise of a wonder
ful performance. When she
sinks to her knees and begs her
unimaginative husband Phil
ippe (Henri Garcin) to protect
her — from her own impulses,
though she doesn't articulate
this — she really does recall Ad
jani's Adele H., and that is
praise indeed. But Truffaut
doesn't seem to realize how

exciting she can be; he doesn't
shape the movie around her.
The other characters are
much less interesting. Gerard
Depardieu plays Bernard main
ly as a funny bumbler; he's
charming but after a while we
catch on that he's merely re
cycling bits from his Bertrand
Blier pictures and we register
the significance of his facial ex
pressions almost before he can
get them out. As Depardieu
plays him, Bernard's passion is
the stuff of farce, just as it was in
last year's The Last Metro. It
seems bizarre that Truffaut
can't find a better way to em
ploy the best intuitive young
movie actor in France since
Belmondo. And the other peo
ple in the lives of the pro
tagonists — Philippe, Bernard's
wife Arlette, the owner of the
local tennis club, Odile, who
narrates the story, her pub
lisher friend Roland — are a
dull suburban bunch. Odile is
given a prosthesis and an in
triguing biography: she once
threw herself out of a window
over a lost lover. Her story is
clearly intended as a variation
on the Mathilde-Bernard love
theme, but it is curiously
muted so that we don't care
about her and begin to wonder
whether we should even be
lieve what we're told about
her.
The narrative is surprisingly
clumsy in places, and one set
piece — a violent outburst at a
garden party — is so poorly
staged that it looks like an er
ror, but generally The Woman
Next Door is, in visual terms,

characteristic of Truffaut — im
peccably fluid and unhurried,
with warm, painterly lighting
(by William Lubtchansky). The
very perfection of Truffaut's
style is becoming a liability,
though; it's almost the visual
equivalent of glibness. The
high-gloss professionalism of
The Last Metro lulled many
moviegoers, who didn't seem
to mind that Truffaut had
chosen an incendiary setting —
the Paris of the Occupation —
for a film peculiarly lacking in
tension, a sweet-natured trifle
that might just as easily never
have been made at all. The
Woman Next Door hasa similar
sleepy quality in most of its
scenes, as if stretching beyond
melodrama required too much
effort. On paper most of Truf
faut's movies would look like
melodrama — certainly Jules
and Jim and Adele H. would —
but when you watch the truly
inspired ones, they pull you
into new, often discomforting
realms. The Woman Next Door
is cosy enough to be a hit.
A note of apology: in my re
view of Pennies from Heaven
in last Thursday's Daily, I made
fwo errors. The Edward Hop
per painting alluded to before
the "Let's Face the Music and
Dance" number is called "New
York Movie," not "Movie Pal
ace,and the actress in D.W.
Griffith's movies to whom I
meant to compare Eliksa
Krupka is Mae Marsh and not
Mae Murray, whose beauty
was much less fragile. (She
starred in Erich von Stroheim's
The Merry Widow.)
