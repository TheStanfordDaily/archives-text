# "Moonchild" premieres
## 
### Waldo Lydecker 
Anne Makepeace's documentary-drama
Moonchild will have its world premiere atthe
Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco on Friday,
Jan. 22, at 8 p.m. Moonchild is the true story
of Chris Carlson, a young man who was
drawn into Reverend Moon's Unification
Church and subsequently deprogrammed.
Carlson pLays himself in the film, and several
other ex-moonies — Mike and Anne Daly,
Gary Scharff, and deprogrammer Judy Powell
— also have prominent roles.
Makepeace, a Master's student in the
Communications department here, first be
came interested in the Moonies as a potential
film subject in 1974, when she heard about
the involvement of the Greene family in what
she calls the "anti-cult network." Daphne
Greene's daughter had become a Moonie,
and in the course of several unsuccessful at

tempts to extricate her, the rest of the family
became active in assisting other families in
dealing with the entrapment of their own
children in the Unification Church. Ford
Greene, Daphne's son, was the deprogram
mer in the case on which Josh Freed based his
book Moonwebs, which was the source of
the recent commercial film Ticket to Heaven.
It was Daphne Greene who steered Anne
Makepeace toward the ex-Moonies who
would become some of the principal players
in Moonchild: the Dalys and Gary Scharff.
Scharff's wife, Barbara Underwood, who had
been his deprogramrner, was the subject of a
play by James Bierman called In Re: Under
wood, one of the earliest dramatizations of
this subject. Makepeace saw the play, met
Bierman — who teaches drama at Santa Cruz
— and he agreed to co-author the screenplay
for Moonchild.
