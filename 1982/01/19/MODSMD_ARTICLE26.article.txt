U.S. military attache shot in Paris
Paris —Assistant U.S. Military Attache Lt. Col. Charles Rob
ert Ray was assassinated yesterday by a lurking gunman who
police said fired a single shot into Ray's forehead and fled as
the victim collapsed on a Paris sidewalk.
The U.S. ambassador to France, Evan Galbraith, said the
gunman was "probably a professional and undoubtedly an
experienced killer."
Police said Ray was shot about 9 a.m. (3 a.m. EST) as he
walked alone to his parked car near his apartment in a fash
ionable distict. He wore civilian clothes and carried a small
attache case found by his body.
The only witness police found was a woman who saw the
shooting from a distance on her way to work. She said she
caught a back view of the killer fleeing on foot and described
him as short with long hair and casual clothes.
In Washington, President Ronald Reagan decried the as
sassination as an act of international terrorism, saying Ray
"gave his life in the line of duty as surely as if he had fallen in
battle.
"Our hearts go out to his family in their bereavement, and
the wanton act of his murderers reinforces our de
termination to stamp out international terrorism and pre
vent similar tragedies in the future," Reagan said.
Polish gov't asks Church's cooperation
Warsaw, Poland —Despite the Roman Catholic Church's
sharp criticism of martial law, the Polish government said
yesterday cooperation was needed from the church to pull
Poland out of its crisis.
In other developments, the Polish news agency PAP called
for an increase in food and other prices to save the economy
from total collapse. Officials of both the army and the Com
munist Party demanded a purge of the "enemies of social
ism."
Polish primate Archbishop Jozef Glemp issued his third at
tack on Poland's military rulers Sunday. But yesterday the
daily government newspaper Rzeczpospolita spoke of the
church's "important social role" in mediating "even the
most difficult problems."
It appeared the government was taking a conciliatory line
toward the church despite repeated denunciations by the
church of mass arrests.
Warsaw radio reported new talks between the church and
the martial law authorities and said the church supported the
government's criticism of foreign economic sanctions. The
broadcast said there was agreement that state-church coop
eration was an important factor "in speeding up the emer
gence from martial law."
President Ronald Reagan cut off about $750 million in
direct food aid to Poland in response to imposition of martial
law. According to Warsaw radio, the church joined the gov
ernment in a statement saying "economic aid is in
despensible for the nation and economic sanctions make it
more difficult to overcome the crisis."
France suspends trading
Paris —The French government yesterday suspended
stock market trading in companies about to be nationalized
and moved swiftly to rewrite portions of its takeover pro
gram that were rejected as unconstitutional by the nation's
highest court.
The freeze was designed to prevent an avalanche of buy
orders on the affected companies, whose stockholders stand
to receive substantially higher compensation as a result of
the court's decision Saturday attacking the Socialist govern
ment's reimbursement plan as unfair.
Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy called in several ministers
and their chief aides for two urgent sessions to work out new
legislation to meet the court's objections. Despite his de
termination to get the changes passed speedily, however,
the ruling has imposed at least three weeks' delay in pro
mulgation of nationalization laws that are the mainstay of
President Francois Mitterrand's economic platform.
This setback was accompanied by the loss Sunday of four
by-elections to the conservative opposition. Mitterrand's
Socialists still enjoy an absolute majority — 284, including 19
affiliated members, in the 491-seat National Assembly. But
the defeats in the first electoral test since its rise to power

marked a highly visible loss of face for a government that had
been riding high on the momentum of presidential and legis
lative sweeps last May and June.
Record cold shifts to northeast
The worst cold wave of the century shifted its grip to the
Northeast yesterday, stranding thousands of city commuters
as trains quit running and cars refused to start in tem
peratures at record lows.
Temperatures were on the rise in the Midwest and the
Deep South, hard hit last week, but more extreme cold may
be on the way. The National Weather Service forecast below
normal temperatures across the eastern two-thirds of the na
tion over the next 30 days.
At least 283 deaths have been attributed to the polar air
mass that first pushed into the country on Jan. 9 and dealt
cities such as Chicago, Milwaukee and Akron, Ohio, their
coldest temperatures since the weather service started keep
ing track.
The cold wave set record lows for the date yesterday from
Pennsylvania through New England, where Chester, Mass.,
posted a minus 34 degrees.
Millions of Americans trying to get back to work after a
largely snowbound weekend found the going rough.
Thousands of commuters were stranded in temperatures
hovering around zero at the morning rush hour in New York,
Boston and Philadelphia as the bitter cold disabled subways
and trains.
Search fails to recover flight recorders
Washington —Salvage crews hoisted the tail of an Air Flor
ida jetliner from the frigid grime of the Potomac River yester
day, but the achievement turned sour when the crumpled
section failed to yield two flight recorders which could un
ravel the causes of last week's crash.
Investigators were initially exultant when, after battling
the frozen river for five days, divers managed to tie straps un
der the Boeing 737's tail and lift it from a crane on the bridge
overhead.
As the 15-foot section was pulled up, it broke away from
parts of the jetliner's fuselage. An Associated Press photogra
pher said he saw one body drop back to the water, as did
much debris.
Still, authorities expected to find the voice and data rec
orders, each contained in heavy metal boxes, within the re
covered section. But when they probed the wreckage, they
came up empty handed. A disappointed Jim Burnett, acting
chief of the National Transportation Safety Board, told re
porters, "We don't have either one of them," when asked if
the recorders were found. He said divers would try anew to
find the recorders in the 27-foot-deep water.
Police Inspector James Shugard said it was possible the
recorders dropped back into the ice-caked water as the blue,
green and white tail section was being hoisted onto the
bridge.
Reagan's civil rights policies attacked
Washington —John Jacob, president of the National Ur
ban League, charged yesterday that the civil rights positions
of the Reagan administration "created a feeling among many
blacks that they were forgotten people."
Issuing the league's annual report on "The State of Black
America," Jacob said that the administration's policies had
created "an unhealthy and dangerous situation" in the black
community. Noting that the league began issuing its reports
in 1976, he said that "never in that time have so many black
people been so alienated from their government."
Despite his attack on the Republican administration, Jacob
said in response to a question that "I would not say President
Reagan is running a racist administration." But he added that
the effect of the Reagan administration has been negative on
the black community."
Jacob was especially critical of the administration's an
nouncement on Jan. 8 that the Internal Revenue Service
would no longer deny tax exemptions to schools that engage
in racial discrimination pending passage of legislation mak
ing clear that the IRS can deny such exemptions. Jacob said
this announcement was a comfort to "racists."
Late yesterday the administration announced it would

consider no more applications for such tax exemptions until
Congress acts.
Jacob said Reagan's civil rights actions "can only be in
terpreted as attempts to dismantle the process of desegregat
ing America."
Reagan clamps down on media
Washington —White House Communications Director
David Gergen called in the top public information officers
from throughout the government yesterday for a meeting to
"clarify" controversial new rules for contacts with the news
media.
And defense officials said the Pentagon is considering ad
ministering lie-detector tests to its employees on a regular
basis before giving them access to sensitive information that
could leak to the press or result in other unauthorized dis
closures.
On jan. 12, President Ronald Reagan ordered a sharp
crackdown on official contacts with the news media on na
tional security matters. Yesterday, administration officials ac
knowledged that White House chief of staff James Baker had
sent a memo Jan. 6 to all top officials requiring them or any
one under their jurisdiction to clear all major television ap
pearances or major print interviews on any subject with the
White House beforehand.
Deputy White House Press Secretary Larry Speakes yester
day stressed that the Baker memo was clearly separate from
the national security directives. He said it was not an attempt
tocontrol the flowof information, but reflected the adminis
tration's desire to know in advance when senior officials
were to appear on television or discuss major policy issues in
interviews. The policy, Speakes said, was a traditional one
that needed to be restated.
GOP leaders criticize Reagan
Washington —In an apparent split within GOP ranks, two
top House Republicans say the Reagan administration is
courting "economic and political defeat" if it goes after "the
little guy" with increases in excise taxes.
"We are deeply disturbed by the lack of political and eco
nomic common sense demonstrated in the current tax-in
crease campaign," said House GOP Whip Trent Lott of Mis
sissippi and Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, chairman of the
House Republican Conference.
Their remarks were addressed to budget director David
Stockman in a letter which also contained a charge that the
budget office is withholding a secret list of corporate sub
sidies.
A copy of their letter was obtained by The Associated
Press.
Congressional sources have said President Ronald Reagan
is considering calling for increased excise taxes on a variety
of consumer goods as well as a proposal for a minimum in
come tax on individuals and corporations in order to shrink
projected ballooning budget deficits.
One Republican House aide who asked to remain anony
mous said yesterday that a number of House members are
sympathetic to the sentiments expressed in the letter.
Market gains slightly
New York —Led by blue-chip industrials and electronic is
sues, the stock market erased an opening slide and closed
slightly higher yesterday as interest-rate fears temporarily
abated.
Among the gainers were retail, financial and entertain
ment stocks, while some aircraft, chemical and oil-service is
sues lost ground.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 5.90 at 11
a.m. EST, led the rebound and closed up 7.52 to 855.12 —
matching its best one-day gain of the new year on Jan. 4. The
transportation and utility measures also moved higher.
Gainers led losers 7 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange,
whose composite index rose 0.43 to 67.84.
