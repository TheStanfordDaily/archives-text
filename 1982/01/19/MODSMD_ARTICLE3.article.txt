Testifying in front of a field hearing
of the California House Ways and
Means Committee in Sacramento
yesterday, University President
Donald Kennedy warned that federal
cuts in university research and stu
dent aid, as well as those resulting
from other administration-sup
ported laws, will have a "devas
tating" effect on universities na
tionwide.
Kennedy was one of a number of
prominent witnesses, including Gov
ernor Jerry Brown, other govern
ment officials and representatives of
various interest groups, who at
tacked all or part of Reagan's eco
nomic program.
Brown predicted that President
Ronald Reagan's cuts in social pro
grams would "rip apart" American
society, and that the tax cuts for big
corporations will soon be offset by
tax increases for the poor.
According to Kennedy, Reagan's
policies toward higher education
represent an "abandonment " of the
federal government's commitment
to higher education.
Kennedy said that while the entire
higher education community will
suffer as a result of the Reagan cuts,
private institutions will be particular
ly hurt because they rely more heav
ily on student-generated revenues.
Under last year's budget cuts fed
eral funding for various student aid
programs was reduced between nine
and 30 percent, Kennedy said.
These reductions in student aid,
according to Kennedy, were viewed
by college administrators as the
cause of a two percent decline in

freshman enrollment at private col
leges nationwide.
"For those institutions unable to
replace lost federal funds, the cut
backs will unjustly discriminate
against lower to middle income stu
dents academically, but not financial
ly, able to attend the school of their
choice," Kennedy said.
He added, however, that although
Stanford was one of the few institu
tions that would be able to substitute
its own revenues for lost federal stu
dent aid funds, the University would
have to compensate by charging
higher tutition and scaling down
some programs.
The cutbacks in federal aid pro
posed for this year by the Reagan ad
ministration, according to Kennedy,
will be even more damaging to
higher education.
Among the cuts proposed by the
Department of Education andthe Of
fice of Management and Budget, ac
cording to Kennedy, are a 54 percent
reduction'in three campus-based
loan programs and severe cutbacks
in the Guaranteed Student Loan Pro
gram (GSL), including disqualifying
graduate students from GSL partici
pation, raising the loan origination
fee from five to 10 percent and forc
. ing students to repay loans at market
interest rates two years after leaving
school.
Committee Chairman Daniel
Rostenkonwski (D-lll.) described the
purpose of his committee's field
hearings around the nation as a fact
finding effort to "find out if we've
made a mistake" in enacting Rea
gan's economic proposals.
