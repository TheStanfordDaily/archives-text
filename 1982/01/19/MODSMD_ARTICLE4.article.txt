From the Daily wire services
Washington — The Supreme Court granted the
Reagan administration permission yestefday to
participate in its hearing later this year on school
desegregation in Los Angeles, but rejected a simi
lar request by California Attorney General George
Deukmejian.
In a written order issued yesterday, the justices
said U.S. Solicitor General Rex Lee will be allowed
to join with the Los Angeles school board at the
hearing in defending the constitutionality of Prop
osition 1, the 1979 ballot measure that ended
court-ordered busing in the city.
The high court agreed last fall to decide whether
Proposition 1 violates the 14th Amendment guar
antee of the equal protection of the laws. The jus
tices have not set a date for a hearing in the case
yet, but it is expected this hearing will be held in
March or early April, with a ruling expected by ear
ly July.
The court announced yesterday it will hear 70
minutes of arguments in the Los Angeles case.
The Supreme Court also heard debate yesterday
on the sensitive issue of preventive detention,
amid signs that the justices would just as soon
avoid the whole controversy this year.
At issue isan amendmentto Nebraska'sconstitu

tion denying pretrial bail to those accused of forci
ble rape when the evidence against them is great.
The amendment, one of the strongest anti-crime
measures enacted by a state, was passed in 1979 af
ter a brutal rape-murder was committed by a man
released on bail after pleading guilty to a previous
sexual assault. An appellate court declared the
amendment unconstitutional.
The question of whether the U.S. Constitution
guarantees a right to bail is central to a current de
bate in Congress and many states on whether
judges may lock up defendants deemed "danger
ous" while they await trial.
But in oral arguments yesterday, some justices
questioned both sides closely in search of pro
cedural defects or legal peculiarities that would
either make a substantive ruling unnecessary or
isolate any ruling from the general debate over
preventive detention.
If the court does "dump the case," as one of the
participating lawyers put it, the Nebraska bail case
would join an increasing number of sensitive cases
dropped by the court in the past two years for pro
cedural reasons.
In another significant case, the high court in
dicated yesterday it will let Unification Church
members use an 1871 law aimed at protecting

freed slaves from the Ku Klux Klan to sue people
who try to "deprogram" them.
The court, without comment, cleared the way
for one member of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
controversial church to sue 11 people for $51 mil
lion under the law.
In other matters yesterday, the justices took
these actions:
—Left intact the criminal conviction of former Il
linois Attorney General William Scott for under
stating his taxable federal income in 1972. Scott
now must begin a one-year-and-one-day prison
sentence.
—Refused, with only Justice William Brennan
dissenting, to revive a Birmingham, Ala., or
dinance that required all construction contractors
on city projects to give 10 percent of all subcon
tract jobs to minority-owned firms. The Alabama
Supreme Court struck down the ordinance as un
lawful discrimination against whites.
—Left intact a $1.7 million fine against Reader's
Digest stemming from its mass-mailing of allegedly
misleading contest material.
—Rejected an attempt by the Oglala tribe of
Sioux Indians to regain possession of South Dako
ta's Black Hills.
