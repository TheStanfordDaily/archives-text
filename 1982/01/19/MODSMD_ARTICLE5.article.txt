# Rising crime rate puts a strain on prison system
## 
### Jeffrey Golden 
There is a pressure building up
in the California criminal justice
system that deeply troubles Palo
Alto's chief prosecutor Randy
Hey. Hey, Santa Clara County
deputy district attorney, fears that
increasingly severe criminal sen
tences — a trend that by itself en
courages him — will further
burden already overcrowded jails.
"I'm very pleased that the legis
lature has been increasing the
sentences for violent crime," said
Hey, who supervises the northern
branch of the county's district at
torney's office. The state has
doubled standard sentences for
rape and second degree murder
in recent years with the effect,
Hey thinks, of deterring many
who consider committing those
crimes.
But in another sense this new
statutory toughness may be mak
ing a bad situation worse. Longer
sentences will put an additional
strain on prison facilities.
"The number one problem fac
ing us down here, beyond the
slightest doubt," he said, "is the
jails. The system is busting at the
seams. "It's serious, even more se
rious than the papers say."
The three county jails — a main
facility in San Jose and branches in
Elmwood and Palo Alto — are le
gally authorized to hold up to 600
prisoners. Hey said that even
when the jail population sinks that
low, a rare occasion in recent
years, conditions are far too

crowded.
He estimated that there were
about 900 prisoners last month
when Superior Court Judge David
Leahy ordered the jails to cut back
to the 600 limit.
Hey described the dilemma
with a sigh. "So now that we've
finally got the state to impose sen
tences that mean something,
we're letting people go before
they can serve the sentences be
cause we don't have anywhere to
put them. There are a lot of peo
ple being released right now who
shouldn't be."
, He is more inclined than ever to
keep young convicts in the county
jails rather than send them to state
prison, where conditions are just
as crowded and far more danger
ous. "If you have to go to Folsom
or Soledad these days, forget it,"
said Hey. "I just don't want to
know that some kid I send up
there gets raped or ends up with a
knife in his back."
The jail problem has had a lesser
effect on the bargaining Hey does
with defense attorneys to secure
guilty pleas. Although his
caseload is demanding (especially
since last August, when an econo
my move took one lawyer from his
office), plea bargaining is some
what restricted.
County policy prohibits
bargaining over sentences, but
Hey is free to lower the charge in a
given case in return for a guilty
plea. Bargaining guidelines are
confidential, according to Hey.

"We don't want the defense bar
coming in here knowing right off
the bat what they can get from
us," he said.
Sometimes common sense
guides the negotiations — Hey of
fered the example of petty theft
cases, which technically involve
less than $200 worth of stolen
goods. If the value exceeds that
amount, the prosecutor can still
file a petty theft charge. Since the
$200 figure was established by a

19th century law, Hey said his of
fice has come to use a $500 cut-off
for purposes of plea bargaining.
Hey said that 90-95 percent of
the cases issued by his office end
in guilty pleas before they reach
trial. Of those that are tried, he es
timated that 80-85 percent end in
conviction. The figures reflect
how much care goes into the filing
of a charge.
There are, he said, four grounds
for filing charges. The prosecutor

must be certain that (1) a crime has
been committed, (2) the suspect
committed it, (3) the first two
grounds can be proven beyond a
doubt in court, and (4) the cause
of justice will be served by prose
cuting.
Hey said he can only think of
two or three "very unusual" cases
in his 10 years as a deputy district
attorney when the last of these
was the determining factor; in
one, a defendant about to die of
cancer was released.
But if doubt is cast on any of the
first three grounds before or dur
ing a trial, Hey will immediately
drop the charges. "My job," he
said, "is not to gain convictions. It
is to see that justice is done."
He added that he would be
fired and disbarred for prose
cuting someone he knew to be in
nocent. Any of his attorneys who
ignore the four grounds can be re
moved from a case and, if neces
sary, transferred or fired.
Hey's guidelines can also lead to
friction between his office and po
lice. "People seem to think we
work with the police in some kind
of partnership all the time," he
said, "which isn't true. They want
us to go after all kinds of people
that we can't. So they accuse us
sometimes of only prosecuting
cases we know we can win. But
both the state and this office insist
on the four grounds."
In addition to the regional
division in the county D.A.'s of
fice, senior deputies are assigned

particular kinds of cases. Hey is re
sponsible for processing all the
rape cases in Santa Clara County.
"Actually, it's a relatively easy as
signment," he said. "Rape is such
a sensitive area that our best at
torneys are assigned to it, people
who need very little supervision."
The recent focus on rape, he
said, indicates an increase not so
much in episodes as in publicity,
which probably moves more vic
tims to report the crime than
before. Part of Hey's job is to hold
bi-monthly training sessions for
police and private groups like
Women Against Rape to help
them counsel victims about what
lies ahead.
"I'm not a psychologist, and I
don't train people psy
chologically," he said. "But it's im
portant to give women a factual
idea of what their experience will
be like when they get to court."
Based on the cases that cross his
desk, he said he senses no dramat
ic increase in rape and other ma
jor crimes. Even so, he thinks
there are too many. "The best
thing we can do about violent
crime," he said, "is to outlaw
handguns."
He said he strongly supports a
statewide initiative promoted by
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey that
would do just that. He cites a pre
liminary survey that shows 60-70
percent popular approval for the
measure as a very hopeful sign.

But Hey said he will not campaign
publicly for the initiative.
"I have my first amendment
rights like anyone else," he said.
"But you have to understand, this
is a very sensitive kind of political
job. You have to use a lot of com
mon sense in your public affilia
tions."
But, Hey still regards insuffi
cient prison space as his primary
nemesis. He said he sees as his
strongest ally in the fight for more
jails the growing determination of
the public to face criminal pun
ishment head on.
"People just aren't going to put
up w th this early release of dan
gerous criminals," he said,
He said he thinks the county su
pervisors will make good on their
declaration to build new facilities,
but worries that the earliest that
any could be ready is 1985 or 1986.
"And it will cost us four times what
it would have 10 years ago," he
said, "when we first realized we
needed it."
Even more important to Hey is
the expansion of state penal facil
ities, so he can prosecute hard
criminals with full confidence that
they will be adequately punished.
He said is pleased that Governor
Jerry Brown proposed bonds for
new prisons in his last official ad
dress, but is uncertain that more
cells are actually forthcoming. As
soon as the discussion returns to
the state prisons, he shakes his
head again, and the words are the
same as before.
"It's a serious situation. Very,
very serious."
