## Poles cope with martial law limits 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw — On their first day
back to school since classes
were suspended under martial
law, Polish children last week
were greeted with presents
from the children of the Soviet
Union and East Germany.
Some children received toys
and candy, others brought
home clothing. And many an
gry parents returned the gifts
the next day, complaining bit
terly to school authorities over
what they viewed as a particu
larly humiliating gesture.
There were other changes
on that first day of school early
this month. A teacher said that
when she arrived there was a
bemedaled army veteran on
guard in the faculty coat room.
Tape recorders and slide
projectors had been locked
away and the staff's private
classroom keys confiscated.
Techers were instructed to
lock aH doors and windows
upon leaving the classroom
and to escort their students out
of the building at the end of the
day. At an after school faculty

meeting, an army major told
the staff that it was necessary to
tighten discipline and em
phasize "patriotic content" in
teaching programs.
An underground bulletin
from the independent trade
union Solidarity reported that
in Wroclaw, in southwestern
Poland, representatives of the
ruling military council sug
gested to kindergraten direc
tors that they should elicit in
formation from the children
about parents who seemed to
use their typewriters a lot.
Fewer restrictions
Polish officials keep saying
that the government is intent
on ending martial law as soon
as possible, and they point to
the relaxation of many restric
tions already. The day after
street clashes in Warsaw and
the announcement that seven
miners had been killed during
a strike-breaking action near
Katowice, the nationwide
curfew was shortened by two
hours in all but six of the coun
try's 49 regions. Limited alco
hol sales were resumed a day

after that.
A week ago, intra-city tele
phone communications were
restored. Newspapers that
were closed in mid-December
are slowly beginning to reap
pear as their staffs are "ideol
ogically verified." Some movie
theaters have reopened, and
the ban on sporting events has
been lifted. Police and military
presence in the capital has
been reduced substantially.
But things are far from normal.
When a person makes a tele
phone call in Warsaw these
days, he is reminded by a rec
ording that "this conversation
is being monitored."
Mail and telegrams arrive
with purple censor's stamps on
the outside. "Ocenzurowano"
means it has been read and
"nie ocenzurowano" sup
posedly that it has not. Occa
sionally, however, the "un
censored" stamp appears on a
letter that obviously has been
opened.
Letter seized
One Pole said hegotanemp
ty envelope in the mail the oth
er day with a stamp on it advis
ing that the contents had been
confiscated. He has no idea
what the offending material
might have been.
Polish night life — which
consists almost solelyin visiting
friends these days — is domi
nated by the clock. The curfew
begins at 11 p.m., and being
caught on the streets any later
means at least an unpleasant
confrontation with the street
patrolsand possiblyacoupleof
days in jail.
One of the many "martial
law jokes" that have emerged
here tells of two soldiers watch
ing a man trudge along the
street at 10:45 p.m. Suddenly,

one soldier raises his rifle and
shoots the pedestrian. "Why
did you do that?" his
astonished- companioa
"He had 19 m
before curfew."
"I know him," replies the
first soldier. "And he still had a
20-minute walk to his house."
At a central Warsaw gasoline
station the other night, an at
tendant refused to service a
customer who could not prove
he was exempted from the
martial law ban on gas sales to
private motorists.
But his attitude quickly
changed at the sight of an
American $20 bill, and he dis
pensed triple the legal five
gallons per sale, pocketing the
money.
Move on economy
In addition to the crackdown
on political freedoms, the
martial law authorities have
pledged a war on profiteering,
speculation, and black market
eering. They have succeeded
for the moment in stopping
some of the most flagrant
abuses — the prostitutes who
used to congregate openly in
the lobby of the Victoria Hotel
are gone. So are the money
changers who used to deal out
side the nerby branch of the
Bank Handlowy.
However, a Western busi
nessman commented, "Poles
will be Poles." Having worked
for many years in Eastern Eu
rope he said, "They're the most
corrupt and liberal people of
the Soviet bloc."
One Pole took exception to
references to the petty larceny
that is still apparent in the sys
tem. "It's not petty larceny," he
said. "It's adaptations to the
conditions of life. That's the
sign of an intelligent nation."
