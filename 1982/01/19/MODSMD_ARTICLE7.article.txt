# Pope seeks close British ties

### 
Vatican City (AP) — Pope
John Paul II prayed Sunday
that his trip to Britain in May
will help end nearly 450
years of division between
Roman Catholicism and the
Church of England.
"May this voyage serve
the cause of bringing to
gether the Catholic Church
and the Anglican Commu
nion, and of accelerating
their much-desired union,"
the pontiff told a crowd of
30,000 at his weekly blessing
at St. Peter's Square.
The two churches split in
1534, when King Henry VIII
broke with the Vatican for
refusing to grant an annul
ment of his marriage to
Katharine of Aragon.
In recent years, leaders of
both churches have called
for closer cooperation. A
full reunification appears
unlikely, however, because
the Anglicans do not want
to accept the infallibility and
primacy of the pope.

John Paul will be the first
reigning pontiff ever to visit
Britain.
The pope's comments
marked the first time that he

had said publicly when he
would visit Britain. Church
officials there have said that
the pontiff's trip will be
from May 28 to June 2.
