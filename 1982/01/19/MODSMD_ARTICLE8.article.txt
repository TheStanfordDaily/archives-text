## Top Israeli journalist offers insights into Mideast conflicts 
### Jiri Weiss 
Neither the recent annexation of the
Golan Heights by Israel nor the ensuing
heated exchange between Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and U.S. lead
ers are likely to have any serious re
percussions on U.S. and Israeli relations
according to top Israeli journalist Matti
Golan.
"Certainly there is an element of per
sonal relationships between the two coun
tries — between the heads of these two
countries — but the significance of these
relations are limited," Golan said in an in
terview last Friday in his room at the San
Francisco Sheraton, "... I believe in my
experience as a political columnist. . . one
day they curse each other; the next day
they hug each other."
As far as the annexation itself is con
cerned, it looks as if most countries "re
alize that it (the annexation) did not have
any significance that should cause any spe
cial alarm," said Golan, who is Jerusalem
bureau chief and political columnist for
the Ha'aretz, a respected liberal news
paper.
The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, is
equally sovereign to pass the bill as it is to
withdraw it, Golan said, explaining that the
annexation was necessary for internal po
litical reasons.
There's been unrest among some Israeli
settlers as April 26 approaches — the date
of final Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai
under the Camp David agreement. Ac
cording to Golan, settlers in the Golan
Heights became afraid that the same thing
will happen to them. The annexation was a
way of pacifying them, he said.
There were concerns that the annexa
tion would hurt chances of peace with Syr
ia, but there have been no signs that Syria
will come to the negotiating table anyway,
Golan said. "On the contrary, President
(Haffez el-) Assad has made it clear that he

has no such intention. The only target he is
aiming for is the destruction of Israel.
"There was a dispute overthe Golan bill,
but the dispute was not over whether Is
rael should or should not withdraw . ..
there is a national consensus over keeping
the Golan Heights for security reasons.
Once you see the situation — you look
from the Golan Heights to the Galilee —
you realize how strategically important
this area is."
Most Israelis remain comitted to the
Camp David agreements, only very few —
including a group of settlers in the Sinai
that refuses to leave no matter what com
pensation the government offers — be
lieve that it has been a retreat.
"They are a very small minority but they
make the kind of noise that is out of pro
portion. There is no question in the minds
of most people that arguments over
whether we should or should not have giv
en up all of the Sinai should have ended
before the treaty was signed, and that we
should live up to the agreement provided
the Egyptiansdothesame." Until nowthey
have.
Golan believes that the Camp David
agreements show that Israel is willing to
compromise. "We are willing to com
promise. Once an Arab leader like (former
Egyptian President Anwar el-) Sadat came
to Jerusalem, we gave him what he
wanted. We did not argue over five kilo
meters here or there." The trouble is that
no other Arab leaders are willing to come
to the negotiating table, he said.
The withdrawal from the Sinai is "a very
painful process, especially for people who
live there. They were sent there 10 or 14
years ago with the promise that they would
never have to evacuate.
"The major question is whether it was
worth it. . . the question is whether Egypt
will still go on with the peace process to
the same extent they are today."
Golan argued that Israel is equally seri

ous about the other provisions of the
Camp David agreement even in the area of
Palestinian autonomy. "Israel is pressing
more for some kind of agreement over au
tonomy than the Egyptians .. But there
are also the Palestinians and without their
cooperation the agreement cannot be ex
ecuted.
According to Golan, most Palestinians
are too afraid to express support — they
are too intimidated by the Palestinian Lib
eration Organization (PLO). "It's not only
rhetorical pressure . . . only two or three
weeks ago a Palestinian was killed because
he voiced support of the autonomy plan.
"I have talked to many Palestinians on
the West Bank. Privately they will tell you
that they want the PLO like a pain in the
neck, but they will not dare to say so pub
licly," he said.
Golan believes that Palestinians would
like to have some autonomy — "maybe
not what they would eventually want" but
more then they have ever had under Jor
danian rule.
In his 1976 book The Secret Conversa
tions with Kissinger — a book which was
banned by the Israeli censor because it
contained classified transcripts of meet
ings between former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir — Golan im
plied that the United States pushed Israel
around.
"Well not the U.S. necessarily, but Kis
singer was the U.S. at the time because
Nixon was then so deeply involved in the
Watergate affair. He (Kissinger) was the
president of the U.S. for foreign relations
... he pushed Israel around and for no
good purpose."
Golan believes that peace could have
been achieved with Egypt as wll as Syria
right after the 1975 war. He said he would
not have minded Israel geting pushed
around if the final outcome would have
been more than a temporary agreement.

meters here or there." The trouble is that
no other Arab leaders are willing to come
to the negotiating table, he said.
The withdrawal from the Sinai is "a very
painful process, especially for people who
live there. They were sent there 10 or 14
years ago with the promise that they would
never have to evacuate.
"The major question is whether it was
worth it. . . the question is whether Egypt
will still go on with the peace process to
the same extent they are today."
Golan argued that Israel is equally seri

ous about the other provisions of the
Camp David agreement even in the area of
Palestinian autonomy. "Israel is pressing
more for some kind of agreement over au
tonomy than the Egyptians .. But there
are also the Palestinians and without their
cooperation the agreement cannot be ex
ecuted.
According to Golan, most Palestinians
are too afraid to express support — they
are too intimidated by the Palestinian Lib
eration Organization (PLO). "It's not only
rhetorical pressure . . . only two or three
weeks ago a Palestinian was killed because
he voiced support of the autonomy plan.
"I have talked to many Palestinians on
the West Bank. Privately they will tell you
that they want the PLO like a pain in the
neck, but they will not dare to say so pub
licly," he said.
Golan believes that Palestinians would
like to have some autonomy — "maybe
not what they would eventually want" but
more then they have ever had under Jor
danian rule.
In his 1976 book The Secret Conversa
tions with Kissinger — a book which was
banned by the Israeli censor because it
contained classified transcripts of meet
ings between former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir — Golan im
plied that the United States pushed Israel
around.
"Well not the U.S. necessarily, but Kis
singer was the U.S. at the time because
Nixon was then so deeply involved in the
Watergate affair. He (Kissinger) was the
president of the U.S. for foreign relations
... he pushed Israel around and for no
good purpose."
Golan believes that peace could have
been achieved with Egypt as wll as Syria
right after the 1975 war. He said he would
not have minded Israel geting pushed
around if the final outcome would have
been more than a temporary agreement.

ISRAELI JOURNALIST MATTI GOLAN — In a recent interview, Golan said that he did not
believe the United States and Israel's disagreement over the Golan Heights annexation
would seriously disrupt relations between the two countries: "One day they curse each
other, the next day they hug each other."
Neither the recent annexation of the
Golan Heights by Israel nor the ensuing
heated exchange between Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin and U.S. lead
ers are likely to have any serious re
percussions on U.S. and Israeli relations
according to top Israeli journalist Matti
Golan.
"Certainly there is an element of per
sonal relationships between the two coun
tries — between the heads of these two
countries — but the significance of these
relations are limited," Golan said in an in
terview last Friday in his room at the San
Francisco Sheraton, "... I believe in my
experience as a political columnist. . . one
day they curse each other; the next day
they hug each other."
As far as the annexation itself is con
cerned, it looks as if most countries "re
alize that it (the annexation) did not have
any significance that should cause any spe
cial alarm," said Golan, who is Jerusalem
bureau chief and political columnist for
the Ha'aretz, a respected liberal news
paper.
The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, is
equally sovereign to pass the bill as it is to
withdraw it, Golan said, explaining that the
annexation was necessary for internal po
litical reasons.
There's been unrest among some Israeli
settlers as April 26 approaches — the date
of final Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai
under the Camp David agreement. Ac
cording to Golan, settlers in the Golan
Heights became afraid that the same thing
will happen to them. The annexation was a
way of pacifying them, he said.
There were concerns that the annexa
tion would hurt chances of peace with Syr
ia, but there have been no signs that Syria
will come to the negotiating table anyway,
Golan said. "On the contrary, President
(Haffez el-) Assad has made it clear that he

has no such intention. The only target he is
aiming for is the destruction of Israel.
"There was a dispute overthe Golan bill,
but the dispute was not over whether Is
rael should or should not withdraw . ..
there is a national consensus over keeping
the Golan Heights for security reasons.
Once you see the situation — you look
from the Golan Heights to the Galilee —
you realize how strategically important
this area is."
Most Israelis remain comitted to the
Camp David agreements, only very few —
including a group of settlers in the Sinai
that refuses to leave no matter what com
pensation the government offers — be
lieve that it has been a retreat.
"They are a very small minority but they
make the kind of noise that is out of pro
portion. There is no question in the minds
of most people that arguments over
whether we should or should not have giv
en up all of the Sinai should have ended
before the treaty was signed, and that we
should live up to the agreement provided
the Egyptiansdothesame." Until nowthey
have.
Golan believes that the Camp David
agreements show that Israel is willing to
compromise. "We are willing to com
promise. Once an Arab leader like (former
Egyptian President Anwar el-) Sadat came
to Jerusalem, we gave him what he
wanted. We did not argue over five kilo
meters here or there." The trouble is that
no other Arab leaders are willing to come
to the negotiating table, he said.
