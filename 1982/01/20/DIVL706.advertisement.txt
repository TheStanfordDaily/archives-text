When many undergraduates
speak of "The Stanford
Experience" — a phrase so often
used that it has become a cliche —
they think of certain images that
have become associated with life at
Stanford University: Freshman
dorms, fraternity parties, Sunday
Flicks and sunny spring afternoons
at the lake.
A graduate student, however,
would describe another Stanford
experience, but its elements would
not be as universal as those of
undergrads. This is mainly because
there is so much diversity among
grad students here and because
most don't share the common
bonds of on-campus housing and
similar curricula that exist between
undergrads.
We don't claim to present every
experience. We realize that other
issues and concerns deserve
attention. But we have included the
images and experiences which our
reporters have found to be
important to many grad students
here.
