# Silence policy defended

President Donald Kennedy said yesterday his re
cent remarks that University representatives should
consider carefully the circumstances in which they
choose to speak out as the official voice of the Univer
sity were not sparked by any particular issue.
Rather, he said, his remarks were in response to
general queries from time to time about why the Uni
versity has or has not taken a stand on particular is
sues.
"I was trying to state some of the social costs and
benefitsthatcomefromspeakingout. . . totrytoclar
ify the matter of what is an institutional position and
from what authority that position is made," he said.
He said criteria for an official's formulating a Uni
versity opinion include the germaneness of the sub
ject and its particular interest to Stanford, the institu
tional need for making a public statement and the au
thority and expertise with which the official speaks.
"(The criteria include) knowledge, institutional in
volvement, degree of threat or potential benefit (to
the University) .. . (on) issues of importance to us.
These issues may often involve money, but other
things as well, such as the issue of (free) export of
ideas," he said.
This idea of free export of information is currently a
high priority for Kennedy, he says. He cited as an ex
ample the University's refusal to place restrictive limi
tations on information available to visiting scientists.
Strong stand
The University has refused to bar Soviet scientist
Nikolai Umnov from access to any research materials
Stanford has to offer, despite State Department re
strictions on free flow of research information to sci
entists from Soviet bloc countries.
But, Kennedy said the University is not afraid to
take a strong stand where a statement is warranted
and the criteria apply. "Where there is a vital institu
tional need and institutional expertise and involve
ment, the University will make an official statement,"
he said.
In his remarks to the Academic Council Jan. 8, Ken
nedy stressed that in his role as president there may
be times a University position must go "quite against
the consensus of the community-of-the-present."
Selective service
As a further example, he cited the pressures on him
and the University to come out with a statement on
the national selective service policy. He said draft reg
istration is clearly a germane subject because of the
extremely large numbers of draft-age students en
rolled here. But he said a University statement on
draft registration passes neither the expertise test, nor
the institutional need test for making a public
statement.
"Neither the president of Stanford nor the Univer
sity as a whole has any special expertise to pronounce

upon selective service policy," he said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president of public affairs,
echoed Kennedy's concerns on this issue of
statements with expertise. "You're asking for trouble
when you involve yourself in public issues when you
may not necessarily have the expertise to do so," he
said.
Kennedy also said that as the United States govern
ment has not requested the aid of universities in regis
tration, nor is the University involved in any other part
of the registration policy process, there is no institu
tional need for a University public statement at this
time.
Kennedy said other University representatives
besides himself can on the proper occasion come out
with an official University position. As University of
ficials, the central function of the Board of Trustees is
"to speak for the future against a chorus of voices that
lay claim to the present," he said.
Kennedy first discussed his views on appropriate
criteria for making a public statement with the Board
of Trustees last December. He received a consensus
of trustee approval, said William Kimball, president of
the Board of Trustees.
Trustees endorsement
"I wholeheartedly endorse Don's statement ...
The University isn't a homogenous matter and there
may be a tendency to speak out in a manner that
might be interpreted as the University's position," he
said.
There is inherently, Kennedy said, a certain am
biguity as to whether an individual is making a private
statement or an official University statement. "(The)
Stanford (name) adds weight to what an individual
says, but that person is also speaking as an individual,"
he said.
But the voice of the University extends beyond the
level of the president and the trustees. Other Univer
sity officials, faculty, staff and students, should con
sider their expertise in and reasoning for making a
public statement, said Kennedy.
Plenty of issues
Kennedy said there is never any difficulty in finding
causes to speak out upon. "The difficulty is in restrict
ing your appetite for that kind of thing," he said. He
also noted that he tends to speak out more often than
most university presidents, partly due to his expertise
as a biologist. But he said selectivity is necessary or
people will place less weight on each statement
made.
"As a person or an institution speaks out more and
more frequently, a point is reached at which less and
less attention is paid to each utterance," he said.
He said he is notawareof any other university presi
dent who has specifically addressed this problem of
when and who should make public university
statements.
