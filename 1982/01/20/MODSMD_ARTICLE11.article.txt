The protesters arrived early in the
morning, taking all of the best park
ing spaces.
They waited outside the El Rancho
Tropicana Convention Centerin San
ta Rosa, California, for Represent
ative Don Clausen, nine-term Re
publican congressman from Califor
nia, and David Stockman, the young
controversial director of the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB).
Asa gesture of thanks forClausen's
unflagging support, President
Ronald Reagan sent Stockman as the
featured speaker at the $100-a-plate
luncheon. This was Stockman's sec
ond try: the first luncheon, sched
uled for November, had been called
off in the aftermath of the Atlantic
Monthly interview.

As Stockman begins a new chapter in his
Washington career, his persona and his
policies deserve a second look. What in the
Atlantic Monthly proved so damaging? What
does Stockman plan to do in 1982?

A truck pulled up. The driver
beckoned to his colleagues for as
sistance and together they unloaded
a large wooden "trojan horse." On
its side they painted: "What's under
the horse is what you're giving us."
Another protester's sign wryly
added: "Talk about trickle down!"
Inside, Clausen and his staff paced
the lobby, praying foe the fog to lift
long enough to allow the budget di
rector's plane to land at the local air
port. Neither the faithful Republican
boosters nor the rag-tag demonstrat
ors were disappointed; Stockman
finally arrived and made his way
towards the podium. He surveyed his
captive audience, savoring his first
major speaking engagement since
the embarrassments of November.
By all appearances, it seemed that
Reagan's budget director was begin
ning to reclaim his former role as the
administration's chief economic pol
icy spokesman.
As Stockman begins a new chapter
in his Washington career, his persona
and his policies deserve a second
look. What in the Atlantic Monthly
proved so damaging? What does
Stockman p\an to do in 1982?
Stockman played a key role in the
administration's smashing budget
victories of 1981, establishing himself
as a prominent member of a winning
team. When the December issue of
the Atlantic Monthly hit the Presi

dent's desk, however, David Stock
man's career hit the fan.
"We cannot fund the Great Socie
ty," Stockman told the National jour
nal in September. "Substantial parts
of it will have to be heaved over
board." The director outlined the
three options then available to Con
gress: raise taxes, cut defense or re
duce domestic spending. Stockman
left little doubt where he thought the
cuts had to be made; he re-stated the
Administration's goal that domestic
spending be reduced by 30 percent
from the level when Reagan took of
fice. Stockman denied the prospects
of higher deficits. "At the present
time," he stated, "I don't think there
is any reason to change the estimate

As we now know, Stockman's con
fidence faded in private. He un
burdened himself to Washington
Post editor William Greider, with
damaging consequences. His most
memorable statements included the
shockers that "supply side is 'trickle
down' theory" and that "none of us
really understands what's going on
with all these numbers." Director
Stockman immediately offered to re
sign, but was instead placed on pro
bation. Two months later he was in
the public eye, and took the Santa
Rosa opportunity to expand upon
some of his comments in the Atlantic
and to lay some groundwork for the
future.
Stockman devoted most of his re
marks to the "preposterous, un
adulterated nonsense" voiced by the
critics of Reaganomics. He began
most sentences with the phrase: "I
wish the critics could remember.. . ,
" and listed the more glaring faultsof
the Carter years and the liberal
legacy. The cost of a youngster's year
in the Youth Conservation Corps ex
ceeded the cost of a year at Harvard,
"with a chauffeured limousine and
spring break in Rome." The Great So
ciety, according to David Stockman,
amounted to no more than the "un
conscionable squander of the tax
payer's dollar."
Fate smiled on David Stockman by
providing him with the fortuitous

publication of the latest inflation fig
ures. The OMB director cited the 7
percent annual inflation rate as evi
dence of "dramatic and long-over
due progress." He touched the
hearts of those assembled with his
uplifting statement that"our new be
ginning has started."
But Stockman's speech also con
tained significant qualifications. He
redefined "trickle-down" to mean
that everyone would benefit by put
ting more money into the "produc
tive mainstream." He described this
group as not simply the very rich, but
a group whose median member was
a middle-class family with two wage
earners and a combined income of
$30,000 to $40,000. They will get two
thirds of the benefit from the tax cuts.
The effect on the economy will not
be "trickle-down," Stockman ex
plained, but a "flood tide" of pros
perity. He reminded everyone that
there was still a long way to go. "But,"
he added, "the plan is sound." Try as
he might, Stockman could not con
vince his listeners of his sincerity. The
words were largely right, but would
have been better spoken by some
one else.
David Stockman's West Coast tour
was planned as a dress rehearsal for
the introduction of the 1983 budget
to Congress this month. Judging
from the response of the Santa Rosa
crowd, Stockman may soon be seek
ing gainful employment. Contrary to
George Will's predicton, the OMB
director has not emerged from the
Atlantic rubble "an enhanced asset
of the administration."
What next? David Stockman will
dutifully introduce Reagan's fiscal
1983 budget and then quietly resign.
Insiders speculate that Stockman
may run for Senate from his home
state of Michigan.
Under new leadership, the Reagan
economic program will enter the
"phase two" which Stockman de
scribed in the Atlantic: a gentle par
ing of the defense budget, much
needed Social Security reforms, a
Medicaid "cap," and subtle revisions
of the tax cut plan.
His first campaign events was a
great success, largely due to the
curiosity which the enigmatic Stock
man can still arouse. As the budget
director left for Bakersfield, Clausen
aides began planning for the next
step on the road to re-election.
