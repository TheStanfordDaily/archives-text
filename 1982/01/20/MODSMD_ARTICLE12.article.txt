Raffle, I feel that I must correct Mark
Swanson's statement (Daily, Jan. 11)
that Harvest was a "premature" ef
fort "which not only cost the stu
dents money for tickets — but was
too early in the year." Swanson's
statement is misJeading
Traditionally Harvest has taken
place during orientation week. How
ever, in ordertoallowboth returning
and new students to participate it was
moved up a week later in the quarter.
Thanks t6 a summer of careful plan
ning, Dragan Popov, COP member
and director of Harvest, was able to
make Harvest the most successful

ever. The COP publicity attracted an
estimated 3500 participants, and ap
proximately HOstudentandacadem
ic groups were able to "show their
wares" at no cost. The free food and
entertainment at Harvest was very
much enjoyed by freshmen, especial
ly after being bombarded by the
reams of information material
churned out by the University. Har
vest was a free service for student
groups to publicize themselves for
present and new students. No fee
was charged and all tables, publicity
and planning were provided by the
ASSU and Tresidder Union.
To bring the facuity and adminis

trators closer to students, the Harvest
Raffle was created — most prizes,
gathered by the COP, were dinners
or meetings with professors or Stan
ford officials. The only students who
purchased tickets were those who
were interested in participating in
the raffle by itself. Approximately
one out of three tickets won a prize
— 50 cents turned out to be a good
deal for a luncheon with President
Kennedy or Rolling Stones Tickets.
Tickets were sold to cover expenses
only for the Harvest Raffle.
