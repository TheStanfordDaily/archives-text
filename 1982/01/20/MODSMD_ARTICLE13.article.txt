## Repression in Latin America merits attention 
### 
I have been involved with Amnesty
International, a human rights or
ganization which tries to intervene in
cases which violate the United Na
tions International Declaration of
Human Rights, for some time now. In
recent months I have been con
fronted by the argument that we, as
Americans, should concern
ourselves with our own national
problems and leave it to each foreign
country to handle its own internal
strife.
Unfortunately, at a time when our
economic allegiences to foreign
countries so apparently override the
human rights policies of those coun
tries, we must strive to re-prioritize
our concerns. Human rights can only

be an international concern because
without external pressure internal
oppression cannot rise against the
very government forces which
censor it. We owe it to ourselves as
world citizens to be informed, con
cerned, and act in our capacity as in
dividuals to counteract the gross de
nial of self-expression and human
dignity which these three countries
represent. The subject of human
rights violation in the southern cone
of South America, in Chile, Uruguay
and Argentina, will be the topic of a
symposium to be held today and
tomorrow at both Kresge
Auditorium and the History Corner.
Amnesty International has re
ceived many reports which the me

dia at large has chosen not to cover.
In Chile, since the rule of Allende in
1973, the Central Nacional Informa
ciones (Chilean secret police) has
been implicated in large-scale arbi
trary detentions, torture, ban
ishment, political killings and disap
pearances of non-violent dissidents.
Between 1973-77 there was an esti
mated 1500 'disappearances" — the
government has refused to cooper
ate when implicated, and the military
courts have ruled the government
immune by the Amnesty Law of 1978.
Since 1973 all political parties and ac
tivities have been banned, which has
resulted in thousands of arrests for
demonstrating, distributing sub
sersive literature, and other peaceful
activities which the government con
siders political. Treatment and condi
tions of political prisoners include
harassment, solitary confinement,
lack of medical treatment, beatings
and banishment.
Uruguay's perpetration of abuses
are much the same: For its small size,
Uruguay has one of most heavily po
liced populations in the world. There
exists a large number of political pris
oners, prison conditions fall short of
international! recognized standards,
detainees lack legal safeguards, use
of torture is widespread, and trials
before military tribunals do not con
form to recognized standards for a
fair trial. The November 1980 Con
stitution was drafted by the Political
Commission of the Armed Forces in

secrecy. The three political parties
were banned from political activity in
1973 for 15 years. There are 1200
known political prisoners in
Uruguay. Brutal interrogation and
torture techniques are routine and
systematic, and prison conditions in
clude inadequate medical attention,
harassment, deterioration of food
quality, suspension of recreation,
and failure to release prisoners on
time. Recently, President Ronald
Reagan asserted that Uruguay is
pursuing a policy which seeks the
"restoration of a democratic system
and human rights and liberties."
The state of seige was enforced in
November 1974 in Argentina and has
been used to justify arbitrary deten
tion without trial of nonviolent op
ponents of the government. 6800 Ar
gentinians are registered as "disap
peared" by the Permanent Assembly
of Human Rights. The adminstration
of President Videla has made no ac
count for them.
The overwhelming disregard for
human rights in these countries il
licits our response and action. If we
do not take a stand as individualsand
allign our foreign policy accordingly,
we make no effort to curb the abuses.
The situation in Poland arouses our
indignation — and we need only
look closer to home to see much
more.
