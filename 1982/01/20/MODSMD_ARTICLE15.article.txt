## Reaction to death squad 'cynical' 
### 
It wasn't really so very long ago. Some of those who
lived through it are still alive today. A squad of Libyan fa
natics was stalking the country with orders to assassinate
President Ronald Reagan or, failing that, other top of
ficials. The steady rhythmic thud of media headlines
pounded the message out for us every day for a week in
early December. The frightening noise echoed through
our national life, until the president was forced to light
the White House Christmas tree by remote control for
his own protection. We're talking the national Christmas
tree, now. It was the highest of Yuletide theatre, starring
Moammar Khadafy as Scrooge and Ronald Reagan as
Tiny Tim.
And it had a long, well-scripted prologue. On Dec. 4,
the State Department anounced what the San Francisco
Chronicle headlined as "Fresh Proof of Libyan Death
Squads." The proof? Well, said State, it's unassailable in
formation from a witness with first-hand contact with the
terrorists. The Libyans were here, determined to a.)
shoot down Air Force One with ground-to-air missiles,
b.) blow up the presidential limousine with a hand-fired
rocket, or c.) attack Reagan with small arms at close
range.The proof? We have it, said State.
Libyan President Moammar Khadafy denied the
charge the next day. He called Reagan "silly and ig
norant" for believing the reports and a "liar" for spread
ing them.
At this point the dialogue sounded very much like
arguments I had with my brother when I was five. Did
not. Did too. Did not. Did too. Not-not-not-notnotnot
notnot. To-to-to-totototototo. Reagan came back and
siiid "We have the evidence and he (Khadafy) knows it."
The fight, like those with my brother, reached a very bor
ing impasse, so it dropped out of the headlines. Re
porters brought it up again at Reagan's Dec. 17 news con
ference, and the president smiled. "The threat was real,"
he began, though questioners hadn't said itwasn't." Our
information on this matter has come from not one, but
several widespread sources ... we have complete con
fidence in it." What information? Our information. The
president claimed that the pumping of the story for spec
tacular proportions was entirely the media's work ("We
won't put that shoe one,") that he wanted very much to
keep the whole thing secret. And behind a tight, irritated
grin there was a plain touch of hurt that people would
doubt their very own president on a matter so awesome
ly serious.
Then they were gone, these proven would-be as
sassins. They didn't exactly disappear; one back-page
government comment had them sneaking off to Mexico,
probably frustrated by the snappy new security meas
ures. Maybe they had planned to napalm the Christmas
tree.
Maybe not. Maybe those rude journalists can be for
given their skepticism. Maybe we're lucky that a few of

them have memories that span more than a week's head
lines. On his Jan. 3 interview program, David Brinkley
asked FBI Director William Webster the same old ques
tion. What proof? Webster, according to a UPI piece
buried deep in the next morning's papers, said that "the
FBI has never confirmed reports of a Libyan hit squad
being in the United States" and that "the information
may have been planted to make U.S. officials look silly."
"Silly" is not the word that leaps to mind when I think
about how the administration played this one. "Cynical"
and "ruthless" come closer, and they might be chari
table. There are at least four reasons why the adminis
tration might have decided to feed us this line of gar
bage:
• It justifed a serious economic campaign against
Khadafy, who has rankled the presidential buttocks for a
long time.
• It promoted what is sometimes called a rally-round- I
the-flag response from the American people, who didn't
and don't seem to be wholly tickled with the Reagan
economy.
• It provided a tighter quarantine of the president,
shielding him from more than Libyan rockets, missiles,
and bullets. The Reagan handlers have successfully kept
the boss away from scheduled encounters with the press,
but he just can't seem to shake that costly habit of slow
ing down for reporters' questions when he walks from
the helicopter to the White Flouse portico or from lim
ousine to Palm Springs mansion.
• It softened up Americans for a frightening new ex
pansion of the government's secret police powers. Here,
I think, is the meat. On Dec. 4, the president issued a 17-
page executive order that for the first time in history au
thorized the CIA to conduct covert operations in the
United States. The order completely and officially re
versed policy of the past decade. It was limited by terms
that, for our purposes, are most interesting: Covert op
erations must relate to "commercial information" or
"data about American residents and corporations be
lieved to be acting on behalf of a foreign power." The
emphasis is mine; no groundrules for this "belief" were
suggested.
An alarming number of political heavyweights warmly
greeted the order, but a fair number objected. The days
that followed brought the news blitz on the Libyan death
squad, and congressional critics of the new CIA order
have been quiet ever since. And the order is securely in
place, just as if it had always been there.
This kind of speculation strikes some people as para
noia. But I think I prefer my paranoia to other kinds of
prisons I can imagine. A few more executive orders like
the last one and I think we'll be able to imagine someof
them very clearly.
