## Repression in Turkey can't be overlooked 
### 
For the past 10 months the Ameri
can press has allocated remarkable
coverage to the events in Poland.
Since the Dec. 13 declaration of
martial law by the Polish govern
ment, detention of labor leaders and
apprehension of 15,000 labor ac
tivists, press censorship and shooting
of eight workers have been followed
very closely. "Solidarity" has become
a household word.
Interestingly enough, however,
the reaction of the U.S. policy makers
andthe mediatotheeventsinTurkey
have been totally inconsistent with
the response to the Polish situation.
The double standard imposed by the
U.S. can clearly be seen by the recent
increase in the military and econom
ic aid to Turkey, disregarding the uni
versal human rights issue.
In the meantime, the U.S. adminis
tration has imposed economic sanc
tions against Poland and the Soviet
Union, claiming violation of human
rights in Poland and a possible Soviet
intervention. This intense attention
to Poland completely contrasts with
the distressing silence on human
right violations in countries such as El
Salvador, Taiwan, South Africa,
Guatamala, the Philippines, South
Korea, Haiti, Argentina, Pakistan and
Turkey.
After the September 1980 over

throw of the democratically elected
government of Turkey by the U.S.-
backed military junta, Parliament was

jailed. Since then, DISK, the second
largest union confederation of Tur
key, with 600,000 members, is on trial
as an organization and its 52 activists
including most of the leaders are fac
ing the death penalty. Moreover ac
cording to Amnesty International re
ports, more than 10 people were ex
ecuted, more than 15 people were
tortured to death in prisons and
more than 100,000 people are de
tained under custody.
