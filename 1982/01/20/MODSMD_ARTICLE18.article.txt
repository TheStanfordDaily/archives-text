# Forum: Poland— What next?
## Viewpoint/Mark Swanson Avoid provocative acts against USSR 
### 
General Wojcieh Jaruzelski's harsh crackdown
on Solidarity and his merciless pre-emption of the
swelling tide of populist activism in Poland was
deeply tragic. It once again demonstrated to the
Western world the insufferable limitations on hu
man freedom, expression and aspirations that still
exist in communist nations. Heightened expecta
tions in both the democratic states and within the
worker's movement in Poland itself astowhat con
cessions Solidarity under the stunning leadership
of Lech Walesa could gain from the disheveled
communist government were bound to result in
disappointment and disillusionment.
In fact, distressing as it may be to sympathizers of
unionists everywhere, Jaruzelski's imposition of
martial law was predictable. The Polish govern
ment acted when it did because it desired to fore
stall an even more active, interventionist Soviet
role in resolving the internal crisis. It acted during
the bitter winter so that suppression of insurgency
or worker retaliation could be effected more swift
ly and easily. And it intended to capitalize on the
ideological split between the moderates and the
radicals within the ranks of Solidarity itself.
Nevertheless, the Polish crisis still appeared
almost to take the Reagan administration by sur
prise. This might in part be due to the mass exodus
of qualified career specialists in the State Depart
ment that began with President Ronald Reagan's
inauguration a year ago. It also might be due to the
disunity within the president's foreign policy es
tablishment itself, heightened by the Richard Al
len fiasco and the naming of the inexperienced
William Clark as national security adviser. It further
might be due to the Reagan administration's ten
dency to freeze up during international crises — as

dramatized by its incompetence and inaction
when Israel annexed the Golan Heights. In any
case, the Reagan administration's response to the
situation in Poland has been unnecessarily pro
vocative, and is likely to prevent any improvement
in Soviet-American relations in the near future. In
announcing sanctions against the Soviet Union for
their involvement in Poland (which had been hasti
ly decided upon during an 18-minute telephone
call from Vice President George Bush), Reagan ig
nored historical precedents which suggest that he
severely overreacted.
Franklin Roosevelt conceded to Stalin in 1945 at
Yalta domination of Eastern Europe; Russia's con
trol over the Warsaw Pact was internationally rec
ognized in the Helsinki Accords of 1975.
Furthermore, when Imre Nagy announced Hunga
ry's withdrawal from the Pact in 1956, Russian tanks
stormed across the border and crushed the upris
ing, capturing Nagy and executing him in Russia
the next year. Fear of liberalization and disorder in
Czechoslovakia led Prime Minister Leonid
Brezhnev to follow a similar course of action in
1968, when the "Prague Spring" was violently and
abruptly pre-empted by an invasion of Soviet
troops. In neither 1956 nor 1968 did the American
government respond with anything stronger than
diplomatic protests. A high official in the State De
partment under John Foster Dulles remarked, ..
(we) were terribly distressed . . . (but) none of us
had whatever imagination it took to discover an
other solution. Wejust were boxed." 1n1968 Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson merely canceled a summit
meeting with Brezhnev in response to Czechoslo
vakia. Yet in 1981 in Poland the Soviets never dis
patched troops, nor did they attempt to execute

Walesa. The reaction of the Reagan administration
thus, in light of recent history, is inconsistent with
long-run American policy and disproportionate to
the extent of overt Soviet intervention.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, on the other
hand, was a clear violation of international law;
sanctions imposed by the Carter administration
were carefully tailored to the provocation. In fact,
many of Reagan's actions are merely follow-ups to
what Carter imposed during 1980. However, by
suspending Aeroflot service; curtailing access to
American shipping lanes and ports; preventing the
export of high technology such as computers and
other electronic equipment; refusing to sell
pipelines; and postponing agreement on the sale
of grain to Russia, Reagan has limited his options
for retaliation in case a true crisis with the Soviet
Union should arise. Reagan isalso now discovering
that the allies' increasingly independent foreign
policy tacks were not due to any lack of com
petence on the part of Jimmy Carter (who was
often unfairly maligned by the nationalistic
Helmut Schmidt), but is due to their appreciation
of the prosperity detente brings — economic ben
efits they are not willing to jeopardize for the pres
ervation of sovereign boundaries.
Therefore, Reagan's policy towards the Soviet
Union in light of Poland is excessively provocative,
and inconsistent with historical trends. It will only
serve to further convince the Soviet Union that the
imperialist West is bent on world domination, and
may be willing to risk war for uncertain gains.

vakia. Yet in 1981 in Poland the Soviets never dis
patched troops, nor did they attempt to execute

Walesa. The reaction of the Reagan administration
thus, in light of recent history, is inconsistent with
long-run American policy and disproportionate to
the extent of overt Soviet intervention.
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, on the other
hand, was a clear violation of international law;
sanctions imposed by the Carter administration
were carefully tailored to the provocation. In fact,
many of Reagan's actions are merely follow-ups to
what Carter imposed during 1980. However, by
suspending Aeroflot service; curtailing access to
American shipping lanes and ports; preventing the
export of high technology such as computers and
other electronic equipment; refusing to sell
pipelines; and postponing agreement on the sale
of grain to Russia, Reagan has limited his options
for retaliation in case a true crisis with the Soviet
Union should arise. Reagan isalso now discovering
that the allies' increasingly independent foreign
policy tacks were not due to any lack of com
petence on the part of Jimmy Carter (who was
often unfairly maligned by the nationalistic
Helmut Schmidt), but is due to their appreciation
of the prosperity detente brings — economic ben
efits they are not willing to jeopardize for the pres
ervation of sovereign boundaries.
Therefore, Reagan's policy towards the Soviet
Union in light of Poland is excessively provocative,
and inconsistent with historical trends. It will only
serve to further convince the Soviet Union that the
imperialist West is bent on world domination, and
may be willing to risk war for uncertain gains.

General Wojcieh Jaruzelski's harsh crackdown
on Solidarity and his merciless pre-emption of the
swelling tide of populist activism in Poland was
deeply tragic. It once again demonstrated to the
Western world the insufferable limitations on hu
man freedom, expression and aspirations that still
exist in communist nations. Heightened expecta
tions in both the democratic states and within the
worker's movement in Poland itself astowhat con
cessions Solidarity under the stunning leadership
of Lech Walesa could gain from the disheveled
communist government were bound to result in
disappointment and disillusionment.
In fact, distressing as it may be to sympathizers of
unionists everywhere, Jaruzelski's imposition of
martial law was predictable. The Polish govern
ment acted when it did because it desired to fore
stall an even more active, interventionist Soviet
role in resolving the internal crisis. It acted during
the bitter winter so that suppression of insurgency
or worker retaliation could be effected more swift
ly and easily. And it intended to capitalize on the
ideological split between the moderates and the
radicals within the ranks of Solidarity itself.
Nevertheless, the Polish crisis still appeared
almost to take the Reagan administration by sur
prise. This might in part be due to the mass exodus
of qualified career specialists in the State Depart
ment that began with President Ronald Reagan's
inauguration a year ago. It also might be due to the
disunity within the president's foreign policy es
tablishment itself, heightened by the Richard Al
len fiasco and the naming of the inexperienced
William Clark as national security adviser. It further
might be due to the Reagan administration's ten
dency to freeze up during international crises — as

dramatized by its incompetence and inaction
when Israel annexed the Golan Heights. In any
case, the Reagan administration's response to the
situation in Poland has been unnecessarily pro
vocative, and is likely to prevent any improvement
in Soviet-American relations in the near future. In
announcing sanctions against the Soviet Union for
their involvement in Poland (which had been hasti
ly decided upon during an 18-minute telephone
call from Vice President George Bush), Reagan ig
nored historical precedents which suggest that he
severely overreacted.
Franklin Roosevelt conceded to Stalin in 1945 at
Yalta domination of Eastern Europe; Russia's con
trol over the Warsaw Pact was internationally rec
ognized in the Helsinki Accords of 1975.
Furthermore, when Imre Nagy announced Hunga
ry's withdrawal from the Pact in 1956, Russian tanks
stormed across the border and crushed the upris
ing, capturing Nagy and executing him in Russia
the next year. Fear of liberalization and disorder in
Czechoslovakia led Prime Minister Leonid
Brezhnev to follow a similar course of action in
1968, when the "Prague Spring" was violently and
abruptly pre-empted by an invasion of Soviet
troops. In neither 1956 nor 1968 did the American
government respond with anything stronger than
diplomatic protests. A high official in the State De
partment under John Foster Dulles remarked, ..
(we) were terribly distressed . . . (but) none of us
had whatever imagination it took to discover an
other solution. Wejust were boxed." 1n1968 Presi
