## Pundits wrong: No danger of Soviet intervention in Poland 
### 
There never was a danger of Soviet in
vasion or occupation of Poland. Moscow's
concern is with its security. In December
1979, NATO agreed to accept U.S. cruise mis
siles and Pershing H's in Europe. Moscow re
gards that as a fundamental threat to its se
curity by changing the strategic balance. Its
interest was and remains to keep those
weaponsout of Europe. It can only do that by
convincing Europe that it does not present a
danger, but those weapons do. Soviet action
in Poland would convince Western Europe
that the weapons are a lesser evil than the
danger of Soviet action moving still farther
West. So invasion of Poland was never a
viable option for Moscow.
Washington wanted the Soviet Union to
invade Poland to provide justification for its
cruise and Pershing II missiles, so that the
United States would have first-strike
capability. Concern for the Polish people
plays no role in Washington's hardnosed
reasoning. This is demonstrated by the pres

ent cutoff in trade and aid, whose purpose
(never mind the rhetoric) is to create such
hardship as to cause revolt and bring the
Russians in. Precisely such destabilization
tactics were used to bring down the Allende
government in Chile in 1973.

Union. Most Polish farming is private, as is a

great deal of urban retail trade. That is not
only counter to Moscow's belief in complete
socialization but to its view of the political
consequences. When the children of private

farmers take factory jobs, they carry with
them the values they were raised under: in
dividualist and not collectivism Their attitude
is consumerist: I work now, I want mine
now. That came through very clearly in in
terviews, particularly with the Gdansk ship
yard workers: "Look at how well the Swedes
and West Germans live. Why can't I?" The
fact that Poland's economy cannot sustain
that didn't interest them. Sweden was neu
tral in World War II and got rich out of it.
West Germany had zillions pumped into it
by the United States for a dozen years after
the war. Poland, totally ruined, one-fourth
of its population dead, had to pull itself up by
its own bootstraps with the help of whatever
the Soviet Union, itself devasted by the war,
could spare. Gierek tried to resolve the
dilemma by immense borrowing from the
West, making Poland's solvency dependent
upon Western markets for its goods. The So
viet Union would never do that, or approvp
of it. A depression came to Europe, and Po

land's markets collapsed.
The Soviet Union understood Poland far
better than the West did. Moscow based its

policy on the belief that indigenous Polish

to get it going again.
Frankly, the nice thing about writing about
Poland is that the accepted pundits were so
wrong. They were all so cocksure that Polish
society was a single entity so totally disgusted
with Stalinism, with "the Soviet model," that
it could not be pulled together again, so
Moscow would have to intervene, and

stomp the Poles under its Iron Heel; and the
brave Poles who would never be timid
Czechs, who would fight in mines and
mills and the farmlands; and the West —
from Reagan to our own nice clean AFL-CIO
and Social-Democrats — would weep
crocodile tears, and nobody would ever
have to worry about detente again. And
Weinberger would pile up his arms for First-
Strike Day in 1988 (last week the Pentagon
told us they'll cost $750 billion more than
previously admitted), and the rest of us
would docilely accustom ourselves to
breadlines and souplines because you can't
have guns and butter at the same time, and
you'd rather be Dead than Red.

portunity to save ourselves from this. Chew
on that.
