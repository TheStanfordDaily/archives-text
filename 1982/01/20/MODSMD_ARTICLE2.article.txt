# Police chief cautions on rape attacks
## 
### Mike Thurman 
In the first of three Rape Preven
tion meetings to be held this week,
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington yesterday spoke of the im
portance of taking precautions
against rape without stereotyping all
black men as possible rapists. In the
three reported rapes on campus this
school year, the victims said the as
sailant was black.
"Be cautious, but don't stereotype
and don't panic," said Herrington to
an audience of about 60 people in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Held in response to the eight at
tacks (including three rapes) re
ported on campus since September,
the meeting consisted of a review of
the facts and suspect descriptions
provided by the victims in each case;
a showing of the women's safety film,
"Nobody's Victim"; a discussion of
ways to avoid and escape a rape at
tempt; and an open question-and
answer period by Herrington.
According to the Herrington, also
the University director of public safe
ty, similar suspect descriptions have
been reported in five of the attacks: a
black man in his early 20s, standing

5-10 to 6 feet tall, with short hair and a
possible thin mustache.
Four of the attacks occurred dur
ing daylight hours in unpopulated
areas near the Stanford Stadium or
the Mausoleum, two were in White
Plaza, one was behind Memorial
Church and one occurred in a park
ing lot near the Varian Physics Labo
ratory.
Herrington said no weapon re
portedly has been used in any of the
attacks.
According to Herrington, when
the assailant threatened the victims
he made "generalized threats, such
as 'If you don't quit struggling, I'll
hurt you.'
"In each of these cases there was
little verbal communication," said
Herrington. "In several of the as
saults the assailant used friendly con
versation in order to seize the op
portunity to assault the victim."
In response to the film, "Nobody's
Victim," Herrington emphasized that
women should take precautions such
as checking the identification of a
calling repair worker or police of
ficer, keeping car doors locked when
driving alone and generally being

alert to possible danger situations.
"Frankly," said Herrington, "I
don't recommend people arming
themselves," explaining that weap
ons in inexperienced hands can be
taken away and used by an assailant
against the victim.
If faced with a threatening situ
ation, Herrington recommended
that women "try to take advantage of
the first opportunity you get (to es
cape). Don't wait â€” the best chance
to get away is at the beginning of the
attack. Try to use it because you may
not have another."
The chief asked that victims report
any incident of rape or sexual assault
without being concerned about the
release of the information.
"We will take the information on
the victim's terms," said Herrington.
"My first responsibility is to the vic
tim. We will release whatever in
formation the victim allows us to re
lease."
Herrington will conduct similar
Rape Prevention meetings today in
the Little Theatre and on Thursday in
Kresge Auditorium. Both begin at
12:15 p.m.
