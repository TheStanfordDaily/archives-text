## Sanctions would hurt Solidarity 
### 
It is important to realize that up to 1975 Poland was not
in bad shape economically. The problem was largely of a
political nature. There were no organized forces either
within the party or outside of it capable of shaping the
events, and there were no alternative programs of ac
tion. It was impossible to stop the self-perpetuating in
vestments or to dispose of the crippling food subsidies. It
was necessary to feed the industry and feed the livestock,
both with imports. It was necessary to pay off the debts.
The only course of action left was to take more loans â€”
high-interest rate loans that were literally consumed by
the Poles, their cattle, their industry and interest
payments on previous credits. Then came even higher
rate loans to pay off those loans and the vicious circle was
closed. In four years the foreign debt nearly doubled,
reaching $25 billion. The Western bankers were only too
happy to extend those credits. It was expected that com
munist governments would pay off their debts regardless
of the burden it might impose on their nations.
The last four years of Gierek's rule were totally lost for
the economy. The GNP levelled off and then, for the first
time in East Bloc history, showed a decrease. Never
theless, sacrificing the prime minister, Gierek and his
team managed to get re-elected for a third five-year term
starting in 1980. The spreading party rank and file discon
tent was never aired publicly. The stage was set for the
summer strikes.
An unprecedented economic crisis must result in a po
litical crisis of major proportions. The Polish economy
came to a standstill because the foreign currency needed
to buy raw supplies had to be spent on interest
payments.
The Jaruzelski government had some very real prob
lems to solve. Poland witnessed a total breakdown of its

consumer market in the last year, which was caused by a
substantial imbalance in the price of goods and the
wages further increased after the 1980 strikes. The price
of food was at the 1960 level, the average wage had in
creased threefold in the last decade alone. The farmers
stopped raising livestock for lack of profit, and what they
did raise they did not sell, waiting for the inevitable price
increases. Money not spent on food was spent on other
goods already not very abundant due to decreasing pro
duction and increasing exports. Virtually everything that
could be bought was bought immediately. The infla
tionary pressure was most sever* 3
It is quite likely that this in itself seemed ground
enough for imposing martial law. The recent political de
mands of Solidarity made the decision so much easier. It
is equally likely that the operation will prove a success.
The outstanding question is: Is the patient going to sur
vive?
Martial law brings severe dangers of its own. The situ
ation is highly unstable. It is not yet clear which road Po
land will take. Neither the party nor Solidarity has said
the final word.
To impose effective economic sanctions against Po
land now is to increase Polish reliance on the Soviets; it is
to strangle Solidarity and democracy. To impose sanc
tions on the whole East Bloc is to risk a bloodbath in Po
land.
The Helsinki accord is not only a human rights agree
ment. It is also a recognition of sovereignty within pres
ent borders. To renounce Helsinki is to say to Poland:
Gdansk, Szczecin, Wrocaw are not Polish cities. To re
pudiate Yalta means to go to war.
