## Help union regain political rights 
### 
No union member can condone or
justify martial law traditionally used
to subjugate workers. Yet it is incum
bent on us union members to ex
amine events leading to martial law
in Poland and what the future holds.
Only then can we determine how to
help Polish workers reestablish Soli
darity as a trade union and regain the
economic and political rights won in
August 1980.
For more than a decade, gross na
tional production failed to meet the
demandsof workers for better condi
tions. To overcome this, the govern
ment borrowed billions to cover
costs not only for industrial and agri
cultural development but largely to
cover consumer subsidies required
to keep prices down. It expected to
repay the debts as production and
trade increased. This was precluded
with the slump in economy of all Eu
rope. As a result, not only was the
government unable to continue its
food subsidies but was also unable to
meet its foreign financial obligations.
Solidarity came into being when
the Polish government removed sub
sidies and raised prices to meet pro
duction costs. Under the leadership
of Lech Walesa, Solidarity drew up 21

demands to which the government
was supposed to capitulate.
Walesa, despite the vote of con
fidence given him for moderation
and negotiations, lost control to the
extremists. Jurczyk, his chief rival,
urged workers "to shed blood and
start civil war" in a national radio
broadcast. He had previously called
for building gallows for communists.
On Dec. 3, Bujak called for the estab
lishment of paramilitary units to take
over the radio and television. Kuron
of KOR called for the seizure of all
areas of social life and creation of
self-government. These elements in
stituted their own reign of terror.
Jaworski threatened even Walesa
with physical violence unless he con
formed and he too succumbed call
ing for a "lightening maneuver" to
seize power.
Civil war and its attendant mass
bloodshed was imminent when
Prime Minister Gen. Jaruzelski im
posed martial law, banning strikes
and suspending economic and politi
cal rights gained by Solidarity.
At the same time, Jaruzelski ap
pealed to Solidarity and the Catholic
church to join in a "Front for Na
tional Agreement" with the Polish

United Workers Party, the United
Peasants Party and the Democratic
Party to work on a plan to overcome
the economic and political crisis. He
continues to assure "there is no turn
ing back to false methods and prac
tices before August 1980" when the
Gdansk accords were signed. He
pledged to honor all reforms.
Georgie Ann Geyer, a nationally
syndicated columnist who recently
returned from Poland, wrote in an
article entitled "Saving Solidarity
from Itself": "The Soviets are not in
terfering with internal reforms so
long as strategic interests are not
touched ... The Polish Army is a
popular, nationalist one and, in the
increasing anarchy, the army has
been the only force holding together
... So while the military takeover is
certainly not the best thing, it is
equally not the worst thing that can
happen ... and may be the only way
of pulling the country together and
maintaining the greatest movement
for democratic change in Eastern Eu
rope since World War 11.
