## U.S. industries face foreign siege 
### 
from the Daily wire services
New York — Two weeks ago
when the National Bureau of
Economic Research pro
claimed that "the U.S. econo
my is currently undergoing a
recession," most people al
ready were looking for the re
covery.
To automakers, home
builders and the unemployed,
to name just a few of the af
fected parties, the obvious
need not be underscored. In
stead, in the fine American
tradition, it was better to put
the bad behind.
"We're loaded for bear,"
said James McDonald, General
Motors president. According
to him, the nation's biggest
manufacturer was ready to take
full advantage of a rebound in
car and truck sales.
Jack Carlson, executive vice
president of the National As
sociation of Realtors, was

almost as enthusiastic. He de
clared the worst was over for
housing. Interest rates will fall
through spring, he declared.
There was less enthusiasm
among the unemployed, but
labor and business economists
were widely quoted as looking

In other words, the U.S. manufacturers
are not able to compete in pricing, and
they won't be unless government
intervenes.

for an increase in employment,
slow though it might be, as the
economy recovered in the sec
ond half.
Was it whistling in the dark?
Hard to say — but there was a
quality to the sound that re
minded you of the time when
you were a kid and you had to
walk right through the

toughest part of town in order
to get home.
GM, for example, might be
loaded for bear but it is the
Japanese that they and other
domestic manufacturers have
to deal with, and everyone in
Detroit knows it. Chrysler has

distributed a pamphlet that be
gins with the stark admission
that "the Japanese can place a
car in the United States for
about $1800 less than a U.S.
manufacturer."
Equally shocking is another
admission. "No action by
ChrysleroranyotherU.S. man
ufacturer can offset the addi

tional permanent tax advan
tage which results from
Japanese government policy/'
it states.
In other words, the U.S.
manufacturers are not able to
compete in pricing, and they
won't be unless government
intervenes. "No U.S. manufac
turer," says Chrysler, "will be
able to overcome Japan's clear
advantage as long as U.S. gov
ernment policy allows it to per
sist."
It concedes that $600 is ac
counted for by poorer prod
uctivity, and $550 because of
wages, fringes and work rules.
But $650 of the difference,
Chrysler contends, comes from
the tax differenial between the
United States and Japan. It
claims that taxes on the average
U.S. vehicle are about $2500,
on a Japanese vehicle about
$1850.
