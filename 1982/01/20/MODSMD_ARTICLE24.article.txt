# Faltering economy ups GOP infighting

from the Daily wire services
Washington—As the government re
ported the nation's lowest factory use in
nearly seven years, dissension
heightened among Republicans over
proposals to raise taxes to reduce soar
ing federal deficits that many econo
mists fear threaten economic recovery.
The Federal Reserve Board has re
ported that factory utilization plunged
to 72.9 percent of capacity in December
from 74.8 percent the previous month,
while factory use in the depressed auto
mobile industry slid below 50 percent.
Factory use never fell below 75 per
cent during the 1980 recession, but
dropped as low as 69 percent of capaci
ty in March 1975, during the depths of
the 1974-75 recession. The normal fig
ure for factory use is generally around

85 percent.
Sluggish sales, attributed in part to
high interest rates, have prompted
manufacturers to idle workers and curb
production in an attempt to reduce
stocks of unsold inventory. The latest
factory use figures heightened pros
pects for further increases in the un
employment rate, which stood at 8.9
percent in December.
Projections of record federal deficits
have raised fears that heavy Treasury
borrowing during a period when the
Federal Reserve is following a restric
tive monetary policy will lead to anoth
er surge in interest rates, dampening
prospects for sustained economic re
covery.
Two top House Republicans — Trent

Lott of Mississippi, the House GOP
whip, and jack Kemp of New York,
chairman of the House Republican
Conference — complained about tax
policy in a letter to budget director
David Stockman.
Tax proposals being considered by
Reagan include an increase in taxes on
gasoline, alcohol and tobacco, and a
minimum income tax on individuals
and corporations, according to con
gressional sources.
Lott and Kemp complained the ad
ministration was ignoring "corporate
welfare," such as spending to finance
construction of synthetic fuel plants for
oil companies. "To continue the pres
ent course is to court economic and po
litical defeat in 1982 and beyond," they
wrote.
