# The 						Stanford Daily
## Report of Operations 
### 
In 1973, The Stanford Daily
became independent of the
University and the ASSU. To ef
fect this independence, The
Stanford Daily Publishing Cor
poration, a not-for-profit cor
poration organized under the
laws of California, was created
to publish The Stanford Daily.
Since independent opera
tions commenced in Sep
tember, 1974, The Stanford
Daily Publishing Corporation
has earned a cumulative
$102,700. In our first year of in
dependent operations the
paper experienced a large
operating loss and almost went
bankrupt. It was decided at
that time, in order to insurethe
survival of the Daily, that a re
serve fund, equal to one-third
of the Daily's annual operating
budget, be maintained to cush
ion it against economic insta
bility.
Through fiscal year 1980, this
goal was accomplished. How
ever, due to a significant capi
tal investment made during fis
cal 1981, a substantial operat
ing loss was incurred that year.
As the Daily enters fiscal year
1982, it is confronted with a re
serve fund which has deviated
from the one-third annual
operating budget goal. This
deviation has clouded the fi
nancial outlook of the Daily. In
order to maintain an adequate
reserve fund during 1982, the
Daily should have a fund ba
lance of approximately
$215,000. This represents a
short fall from our current pos
ition of $50,000.

The 1981 capital expenditure
discussed above was an elec
tronic typesetting system re
ferred to as the visual display
terminal system. The VDT sys
tem enables reporters' stories
and wire service copy to be
edited and typeset without
having to be retyped into a
typesetting machine. The costs
of the system exceeded
$146,000. Part of this was fi
nanced from our reserve fund
and part through a $130,000
three-year loan from the Uni
versity. As the purpose of The
Stanford Daily is not to make
money, but rather to promote
the educational experiences of
its members, the purchase of
this VDT system, although pos
sibly not financially sound, is,
in the opinion of the Board of
Directors, appropriate.
Although the VDT system
does somewhat reduce the
typesetting costs to the Daily,
its annual operating costs, de
preciation and interest charges
have imposed significant cash
requirements on the corpora
tion. These cash requirements
are in addition to the operating
cash requirements that any
newspaper encounters.
The nature of a newspaper
such as The Stanford Daily re
quires current expenditures to
pay for printing, typesetting
and salaries. Receipt of ad re
venues, which are 95 percent
of the revenues The Stanford
Daily receives, are usually de
ferred by the advertisor for a
two to three month period.
Therefore, it is necessary for
The Stanford Daily to maintain
significant cash working capital

balances in order to fund its
operation.
Now that the VDT system is
installed and operational, we
expect the financial perfor
mance of the Daily to improve.
For fiscal year 1982 and 1983 we
project a small profit and for
fiscal year 1984 we project a re
turn to our normal profit
levels. To help return The Stan
ford Daily to financial strength
we have undertaken certain
steps. We have negotiated with
a new printer to print The Stan
ford Daily and have im
plemented certain expense re
strictions to help reduce our
current expenses. We have
held salary levels below where
inflation would have dictated
them to rise to, and we are ac
tively promoting the Daily's
services to advertisers both
within the community and on a
national basis.
The Stanford Daily is com
mitted to providing its readers
with thorough coverage of
events that affect the Stanford
community. We are striving to
fulfill our commitment to the
community and to continue
the 90-year tradition of The
Stanford Daily. The future fi
nancial stability of the news
paper is dependent on our abil
ity to provide the community
with a quality publication in
such a way as to cover our costs
and expenses in doing so.
