						49ers vs. Bengals analysis Last year's sleepers could make XVI best Super Bowl ever 
### Los Angeles Times 
Detroit — During Bill
Walsh's second season as their
coach in 1980, the San Francico
49ers lost 10 of their 16 games,
after losing 14 of 16 the pre
vious season. (In 1979 under
Homer Rice the Bengals had
lost 12 of 16.)
The Cincinnati Bengals were
just as bad last year when, in
Forrest Gregg's first season as
their coach, they matched San
Francisco's 6-10 won-lost rec
ord. (In 1979 under Homer Rice
the Bengals had lost 12 of 16.)
The sudden rise of San Fran
cisco and Cincinnati this year is
a unique pro football
phenomenon. Neither club
has ever played for the Na
tional Football League cham
pionship — yet here they are in
Super Bowl XVI.
Both, what's more, have be
come good, solid football
teams — the best in their con
ferences. They may have got
ten here in a rush, but there
was nothing unsound about
the way they did it in a season
when 13-3 San Francisco won
the NFC and 12-4 Cincinnati
the AFC.
In the decisive four games,
each twice whipped the sec
ond-best teams in their con
ferences, Dallas and San Diego.
Of the 28 NFL teams, the 49ers
and Bengals are clearly the
class this time — unlike the
years when the top two Ameri
can Conference teams could
be rated one-two in the pros.
Assuming the winner of the
Super Bowl is the better team,
that would be San Francisco.
The 49ers are as effective as the
Bengals on offense and

stronger defensively.
Making it interesting, these
are teams with different per
sonalities but similar strengths
in the offensive departments
(passing, running, catching,
blocking) and in two of the
three places on defense: line
and linebacking.
The one place of measurable
difference is the secondary,
where the 49ers are younger
but conspicuously more active
and more gifted. .
There are two reasons to be
lieve Cincinnati will make it a
game. It has the greater long
ball capability and it represents
the AFC, which is 11-4 in the
Super Bowl series, 8-1 in the
last nine and 3-0 since 1978.
Only one NFC team, Dallas,
has won it in the last 13 winters.
The 49ers would become only
the third NFC winner in the 16-
year series.
If a new trend is starting it
was signaled during the 1981
regular season when, for the
first time in a decade, NFC
teams won the intercon
ference battle, 28-24.
One other assumption is in
applicable in this game, the
theory that the most-ex
perienced Super Bowl team
will win. In the last 15 years,
what San Francisco and Cincin
nati have experienced the most
of, in and out of the playoffs, is
defeat.
The Quarterbacks: In the
earliest years of the Super Bowl
and until the recent past, the
objective of the competing
coaches was not to lose. Put
ting their faith in defense, and
throwing only a few passes in
the first two or three quarters,

they sought to win by controll
ing the ball — and thus in en
tertainment terms, most Super
Bowl games have been per
ceived as dull.
With quarterbacks Ken An
derson and Joe Montana
throwing for Cincinnati and
San Francisco, that label isn't
likely to be attached to game
XVI. These are passing teams
led by the passing champions
of the American and National
Conferences.
The strange thing about
them as pro quarterbacks is
that they could hardly be more
different.

u

Anderson, 32, 6-3, 208, is
stable, disciplined and well-or
ganized — a classic NFL quar
terback who can throw ac
curately at all ranges from the
shortest to the longest and
who, running with the ball, has
the instincts of a good NFL half
back. He is the league's best
running quarterback since
Roger Staubach.
Montana, 25, 6-2, 200, is
basically a short-range passer
who runs even more often than
Anderson but seldom crosses
the scrimmage line. Quick out
of the pocket — with super
quick hands and feet — Mon

tana on a scramble has one
goal: to make something hap
pen, that is, to get the ball to
somebody, anybody any
where, for a first down.
In other words, Montana is
an athlete, one of the league's
best, and Anderson is a quar
terback, the NFL model at his
position.
Anderson, a third-round
draft choice from Augustana
(III.) College, doubtless would
have been a first if he had at
tended Notre Dame. He has
every quality the scouts look
for.
Montana, also a third-round

choice who did go to Notre
Dame, drew this comment
from the scouts (including
those who finally drafted him):
"Great athlete; can't do it in
the pros."
He fooled them; or rather
Bill Walsh fooled them. An
derson and Montana are both
Walsh products — but the San
Francisco coach merely
polished Anderson. He created
Montana.
Cincinnati Game Plan: The
Bengals on offense are a con
ventional AFC champion ex
cept for the unusual size of
their fullback, Pete Johnson,

who is 6-0 and 249.
Against San Francisco, as
against the AFC teams they
beat to get here, the Bengals
can be expected to pound
away with Johnson and test the
enemy's secondary with the
many kinds of passes Anderson
can throw.
Their game plan is to hit so
hard with their massive full
back and so accurately with
short- to medium-range passes
that they can pull the San Fran
cisco defense forward — then
throw over it.
Anderson will want to
launch three or four bombs

early.
The bomb is a realistic weap
on for the Bengals because, un
like other teams, they have two
receivers with the speed to go
deep — the venerable Isaac
Curtis and a rookie, Cris Col
linsworth — along with two of
the most underrated catchers
in the league, Steve Kreider
and tight end Dan Ross.
The 49ers on Defense: The
strength of the 49ers is that they
have power in all three de
fensive departments. Thought
of as a passing team because of
Bill Walsh's reputation and'

Montana's accomplishments,
the 49ers are intrinsically a de
fensive team — like most
champions.
In an earlier Super Bowl —
against an old AFC champion
like Pittsburgh or Oakland —
this 49er lineup would have
been in trouble because of the
three rookie backs, cor
nerbacks Ronnie Lott and Eric
Wright and safety Carlton Wil
liamson.
But because Cincinnati also
lacks Super Bowl playing time,
the49ers immaturity isn't much
of a handicap. Indeed, after
starting 20 exhibition and regu
lar season and two playoff
games, they're old pros now.
No fewer than 16 players are
considered regulars for the ag
gressively multiple-defense
49ers, who are seldom in the
same defense on consecutive
plays.
San Francisco Game Plan:
On offense, the 49ers will open
Super Bowl XVI by probing and
stabbing with Montana's short
passes and a cleverly coached
running attack that gets the
most out of some of the worst
runners ever to reach the NFL's
final round.
The most visible character
istic of the San Francisco of
fense is that its receivers are so
often so wide open, frequently
surprising both the defensive
players and those watching on
television. It is the design of the
offense, as conceived by Bill
Walsh, that makes this happen.
For each new defense San
Francisco comes up against,
Walsh builds a new offense, us
ing many of the same compo
nents, to be sure, but in dif

ferent mixtures. Thus, facing
Dallas, which has one of foot
ball's few remaining front
fours, Walsh resurrected the
old slow-developing handoff
sweep with two pulling guards.
With this and other innova
tions he proved that it is pos
sible, after all, to run on the
Cowboys.
The Bengals on Defense: Be
ginning the game in its basic
3-4 alignment, Cincinnati will
attack desperately to win the
first-down battle and get into a
tougher pass defense on sec
ond down — either the 4-3
(with four down linemen) or
the nickel (with five deep
backs).
The Bengals don't have
much confidence in their start
ing secondary, which is vulner
able to passes whenever
they're in their 3-4 defense.
Their two best defensive
players, ends Eddie Edwards
and Ross Browner, are typically
double-teamed by the offense
when the Bengals come out in
a three-man line. It is only
when Cincinnati shifts to a
front four (on second or third
and long) that the defensive
ends can count on man-for
man blocking from San Fran
cisco offensive tackles Dan
Audick and Keith Fahnhorst.
Cincinnati's governing de
fensive strategy, therefore, will
be to stop San Francisco on first
down and unleash Edwards
and Browner on second down.
In passing situations the
Bengals have a third defensive
force named Reggie Williams,
a fast, nimble linebacker from
Dartmouth, who led the club in
sacks this season.
