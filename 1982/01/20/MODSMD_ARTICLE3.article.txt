# Malamud reads from new work
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Pulitzer Prize-winning author
Bernard Malamud's reading last
night of a chapter from God's
Grace — his recently completed
novel — was warmly received by a
capacity crowd at Kresge
Auditorium.
The chapter, entitled "The
Flood," is the Bible'sNoahandthe
Ark story revisited. It follows the
adventures of the last human sur
vivor after a man-created nuclear
holocaust kills off the vast majority
of humanity, leaving the mopping
up to the wrath of God.
The hero, Calvin Cohen, some
how slipped through the cracks.
Cohen was busy surveying the
ocean floor in a submersible vehi
cle when the missiles hit. Some
lied in the ocean "like smoking
turds."
"Through a miniscule error you
have escaped destruction," an un
compromising God tells him, but
instead of the expected lightning
bolt, Cohen receives an indefinite

time to live. He thinks he is alone
on the listing oceanographic
vessel "Rebecca Q," and pleading
and arguing seems to do no good.
So, Cohen — a paleontologist
who thought at one point of be
coming a rabbi — finds himself
the only man, possibly the only
being, alive in a rottingsea that for
all he knows covers the entire sur
face of the planet.
To keep himself company he
plays records and talks to himself,
"Do you see yourself as Adam?...
If the job is open."
But Cohen hears noises, and
when he notices his water rations
disappearing, he searches the ship
and discovers a scared and hoot
ing chimpanzee hiding under
neath a sink among the detergent
bottles. The chimp, he remem
bers, belonged to a colleague of
his on the vessel — a German pro
fessor who took pains to educate
his boy with sign language.
The two quickly become
friends, assuming something akin

to a father-son relationship.
In spite of the book's somber
core, Malamud is optimistic about
the human condition.
"Isn't it in the nature of human
beings to survive?" he retorted to
a question that pointed out the
apparent futility of Cohen's con
tinued existence. "The book is as
much a celebration of life as my
other books are," he said.
Why is he so optimistic? "That's
another book," he told the au
dience.
Malamud got the idea for the
novel from a number of sources.
He became interested in chim
panzees by reading works by an
thropologist Jane Goodall. That
combined with his interest in the
Bible and the Isaac and Abraham
story started him off.
Malamud said he is more in
terested in ideas than inspiration.
"I am most productive when I
have a decent idea to work with,"
he said. Malamud has worked on
his most recent "decent idea" in

the past months here at the Cen
ter for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences.
Besides writing, Malamud
teaches writing at Bennington
College in Vermont. But he does
not believe that it is possible to
teach someone how to write. You
can only give advice and "act as a
cathartic agent" to talented peo
ple, he said.
Malamud said he decided to
become a writer at "under 10
years of age. I was a storyteller
from the word 'go.' "
Malamud has written many
novels as well as short stories. His
The Magic Barrel won the Na
tional Book Award for fiction in
1959, his The Fixer won the
Pulitzer Prize as well as his second
National Book Award in 1967.
Malamud is the first speaker in
an ASSU Speakers Bureau Winter
Writer series that will feature Ray
Bradbury, Adrienne Rich, John
Hawkes, Gore Vidal and a panel of
publishers.

fessor who took pains to educate
his boy with sign language.
The two quickly become
friends, assuming something akin

to a father-son relationship.
In spite of the book's somber
core, Malamud is optimistic about
the human condition.
"Isn't it in the nature of human
beings to survive?" he retorted to
a question that pointed out the
apparent futility of Cohen's con
tinued existence. "The book is as
much a celebration of life as my
other books are," he said.
Why is he so optimistic? "That's
another book," he told the au
dience.
Malamud got the idea for the
novel from a number of sources.
He became interested in chim
panzees by reading works by an
thropologist Jane Goodall. That
combined with his interest in the
Bible and the Isaac and Abraham
story started him off.
Malamud said he is more in
terested in ideas than inspiration.
"I am most productive when I
have a decent idea to work with,"
he said. Malamud has worked on
his most recent "decent idea" in

the past months here at the Cen
ter for Advanced Study in the Be
havioral Sciences.
Besides writing, Malamud
teaches writing at Bennington
College in Vermont. But he does
not believe that it is possible to
teach someone how to write. You
can only give advice and "act as a
cathartic agent" to talented peo
ple, he said.
Malamud said he decided to
become a writer at "under 10
years of age. I was a storyteller
from the word 'go.' "
Malamud has written many
novels as well as short stories. His
The Magic Barrel won the Na
tional Book Award for fiction in
1959, his The Fixer won the
Pulitzer Prize as well as his second
National Book Award in 1967.
Malamud is the first speaker in
an ASSU Speakers Bureau Winter
Writer series that will feature Ray
Bradbury, Adrienne Rich, John
Hawkes, Gore Vidal and a panel of
publishers.
