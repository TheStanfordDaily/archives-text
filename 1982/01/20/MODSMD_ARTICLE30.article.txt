"Experience is the best
teacher. If we can develop our
young talent, we can become
more competitive in our
league," assessed Stanford
head coach Fred Sturm.
The men's volleyball squad
opens its regular season sched
ule against conference rival
UCLA at home on Wednesday,
Feb. 3 at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
The Bruins, the defending
NCAA champions, have won
eight of the past 12 national
titles. Pre-season pollsters
again have rated the team as
the favorites to repeat their
reign.
The Card, which finished in
last place in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation conference last year,
is ranked tenth in the nation.
Seven of the other nine top
rated teams belong to the
CIVA, including N0.2 USC and
N0.3 UC-Santa Barbara.
"The conference is definitely
the strongest in the country,"
said asst. coach Don Shaw.
"Northern Californians have
the opportunity to see the best
volleyball in the nation at our 7
home matches this winter."
Stanford lost two lettermen
to graduation last June and,
thus, will boast a young team:
six of the 13 squad members
are freshmen. Two probable
frosh starters include middle
blocker Dan Parr and 6-6 setter
Craig Lauchner. Both players
were last spring's top recruits in
the nation, and both have im
pressed Stanford coaches on
the practice court.
"The key to our success this
year will be the rate at which
our young players develop,"
explained Sturm, who added
that it takes time to learn the
style of college play and to ad
just to the Stanford system.
Both Sturm and Shaw agree
that the Cardinal men have
shown dedication and the abil
ity to work hard in pre-season

drills.
"We're stronger this year in
blocking and passing," Shaw
said, "and our first line of de
fense is much improved."
Sturm believes that the
strength of the UCLA team lies
primarily in their depth and es
tablished program.
"Coach Al Scates has built
the UCLA squad into a winning
power in the 23 years since he
took over the position. There is
no doubt that until very recent
ly, only the finest student ath
letes went to UCLA to play for
him. Finally I believe that tradi
tion may be changing."
Stanford will continue to
work on drills designed to de
velop the consistency which
often evades a young squad.
Sturm said that he is hesitant to
comment on his teams chances
this year.
Short Sets: The Northern
California Athletic Conference
recently announced its all-con
fernce picks, including Stan
ford outside hitter Deanna
Boyette, who captured a berth
on the first team. Boyette, a
junior, was joined by team
mates Chris Anderson and Jan
Linden, both seniors, who re
ceived second team hon
ors. . .In a move that head
coach Sturm called "The most
significant event in women's
athletics since I've been here,"
the Western Collegiate Athlet
ic Association admitted Stan
ford women's volleyball into
the league effective July of this
year. Stanford joins defending
NCAA champs UCLA and run
nerup USC in the division
which sported three of the four
national semi-finalists last De
cember in Los Angeles.

six of the 13 squad members
are freshmen. Two probable
frosh starters include middle
blocker Dan Parr and 6-6 setter
Craig Lauchner. Both players
were last spring's top recruits in
the nation, and both have im
pressed Stanford coaches on
the practice court.
"The key to our success this
year will be the rate at which
our young players develop,"
explained Sturm, who added
that it takes time to learn the
style of college play and to ad
just to the Stanford system.
Both Sturm and Shaw agree
that the Cardinal men have
shown dedication and the abil
ity to work hard in pre-season

drills.
"We're stronger this year in
blocking and passing," Shaw
said, "and our first line of de
fense is much improved."
Sturm believes that the
strength of the UCLA team lies
primarily in their depth and es
tablished program.
"Coach Al Scates has built
the UCLA squad into a winning
power in the 23 years since he
took over the position. There is
no doubt that until very recent
ly, only the finest student ath
letes went to UCLA to play for
him. Finally I believe that tradi
tion may be changing."
Stanford will continue to
work on drills designed to de
velop the consistency which
often evades a young squad.
Sturm said that he is hesitant to
comment on his teams chances
this year.
Short Sets: The Northern
California Athletic Conference

junior, was joined by team

Linden, both seniors, who re
ceived second team hon
ors. . .In a move that head
coach Sturm called "The most
significant event in women's
athletics since I've been here,"
the Western Collegiate Athlet
ic Association admitted Stan
ford women's volleyball into
the league effective July of this
year. Stanford joins defending
NCAA champs UCLA and run
nerup USC in the division
