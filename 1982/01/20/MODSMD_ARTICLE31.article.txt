# Golden Gophers eat up hoop poll
## 
### Associated Press 
Minnesota has moved
into college basketball's
high-rent district, but
Coach Jim Dutcher is not
sure whether to celebrate or
take cover.
The Gophers moved from
No. 11 to No. 5 in this week's
Associated Press poll, re
leased yesterday, while the
top four teams — North
Carolina, Missouri, Virginia
and DePaul — remained the
same.
"That's been a bad spot
for us," Dutcher said. "We
got up to fifth twice and lost
the next game both times.
We don't like No. 5."
Dutcher didn't feel the
lofty ranking would affect
his players.
"They talked about it the
first time we got up there (in
the fourth week of the sea
son)," Dutcher said. "The
next time it happened, I
don't think anybody men
tioned it, and this time, I
don't think anybody will."
Texas, Idaho and Tulsa
also took giant strides. The
Longhorns moved from
19th to seventh behind
lowa, which dropped one
place to sixth. Idaho moved
up from 14th to eighth, and
Tulsa leaped from 18th to
10th. Kentucky, sixth a week
ago, fell to ninth.
North Carolina got 60
first-place votes, one short
of being unanimous, in the
balloting by a nationwide
panel of sports writers and

broadcasters. The Tar Heels
finished with 1,219 points.
Missouri again got the other
first-place ballot and re
ceived 1,126 points.
North Carolina beat
North Carolina State and
Duke last week, while Mis
souri defeated Oklahoma
State, Nebraska and Louis
ville.
Virginia compiled 1,115
points, DePaul 997 and Min
nesota 857.
Minnesota's advance
came after victories over
lowa and Michigan. Texas
defeated Houston, Arkansas
and Texas Christian, and
Idaho beat Idaho State and
Weber State.
Wichita State and Virginia
Tech fell out of the Top
Twenty, being replaced by
Kansas State and Tennessee.
Virginia Tech lost twice,
to Florida State and Mem
phis State, while beating
Tulane, and Wichita State
stopped Creighton before
losing to Tulane.
The Second Ten, in order,
are San Francisco, Oregon
State, Georgetown, North
Carolina State, Arkansas, Al
abama, Louisville, Kansas
State, Houston and Tennes
see.
