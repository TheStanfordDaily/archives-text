Reagan to ask tax hikes, shifts to state control
Washington — President Ronald Reagan will ask Congress in his State
of the Union message Jan. 26 to raise some federal taxes and earmark
part of the proceeds for aid to states and cities, Congressional sources
said yesterday.
The comprehensive "New Federalism" proposal calls for shifting rev
enues and responsibility for major federal welfare, education and trans
portation programs from Washington to the states.
The president was not asked directly at his news conference yesterday
about reports that he had approved in principle a plan that would make
sweeping changes in long-established government programs, and, con
trary to his past statements, seek higher taxes to help lower a projected
deficit of $100 billion or more.
In reply to a related question, however, he said: I believe that many
of the things that the federal government has usurped in the last halt
century . . . could be better run at the state level.
There have been reports that the president will ask Congress to ap
prove a federal takeover of state costs for providing Medicaid, now run
ning at $13.5 billion a year, as well as state costs for Supplemental Secur
ity Income, a program for the needy <3ged, blind and disabled.
In return, according to the reports, the $7 billion annual federal share
of Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the basic welfare program,
would be turned over to the states.
No-strings federal aid to cities also would be increased in return tor
cancellation of some federal urban aid programs.
Reagan was expected to propose increases in so-called sin taxes on
cigarettes and liquor and seek new taxes on some luxury goods, Con
gressional sources said. An administration official said in that connec
tion that the president had decided against a tentative plan to double
the four-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax.
Congressional sources said that excise taxes would be increased by
about $10 billion to $15 billion a year to provide funds for the states and
to reduce the federal budget deficit.
Allies meet on trade restrictions with Soviets
Paris — Senior U.S. and allied officials, under pressure from Washing
ton for economic action against the Soviet Union, yesterday opened a
two-day meeting designed to update and toughen the inventory of
high-technology goods blacklisted for sale to Moscow.
The session of Cocom, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls, coincides with a campaign by the Reagan adminis
tration to counter what U.S. officials describe as a concerted Soviet pro
gram to obtain the latest Western technology to improve the Red
Army's military capabilities.
As a result, the usually obscure organization, based in a nondescript
office building that also houses Marine guards for the U.S. Embassy
here, has become a focus of attention in the administration's drive to
organize an allied response to the Soviet role in Poland.
The United States has clearly indicated it wants Cocom members
Japan and the NATO allies, except Iceland — to cut back on sales of ad
vanced equipment, even nonstrategic, that could bolster Soviet might
by direct military application or by freeing other resources for the
armed forces.
"We will present new evidence to our allies on how the Soviet Union
and Warsaw Pact are using Western technology to strengthen their of
fensive military capabilities," Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week. "We want to conclude at that
meeting a redefinition of the Cocom international control program."
Thousands of strikers arrested in India
New Delhi, India — With more than 6000 trade union activists under
arrest, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government yesterday appeared
to have at least partially blunted the impact of a national general strike
call.
Two deaths were reported in scattered incidents of violence.
Participation of the country's two major news agencies in the strike
made it impossible to accurately assess the extent of the shutdown.
However, fragmented reports from major cities and towns indicated
that many workers joined the strike call, but few of the called-for dem
onstrations took place. "Many just stayed home because they feared vi
olence." said one Bombay businessman.
Government-controlled all-India radio, the only national news
gathering organization working, reported normal or near normal con
ditions in most cities.
Both the government and strikers claimed victory in the one-day pro
test against tough preventive detention and anti-strike laws ago. Strikers
said they were also protesting rising prices and declining living stan
dards.
Representatives from a large trade union federation linked with
Gandhi's ruling Congress Party (the only party that did not honor the
strike call), claimed only 5 million to 6 million of India's estimated 20
million member organized labor force participated.
FHowever, strike organizers and some of Gandhi's political opponents
claimed as many as 15 million workers walked off the job nationwide.
The vast majority of India's 200 million-plus laborers work in agricul
ture and were not involved in the action.
The work stoppage was called by eight of the country's major trade
union federations encompassing roughly 9 million workers. All eight
are linked to political parties opposed to Gandhi.
After failing to head off the strike, state governments began rounding
up trade union activists last weekend.

Poland announces huge price hikes
Warsaw — Communist Poland's martial law government announced
that food prices will increase as much as fourfold Feb. 1, and warned of a
drastic shortage of meat.
The government daily Rzeczypospolita said that purchases of animals
tor slaughter for January-March would be about 400,000 tons, 180,000
tons less than the same period in 1981.
The article was based on projections, and blamed the predicted short
fall on poor delivery by farmers, who it said were also withholding grain
from market in hopes of higher prices.
Authorities also said police in southwestern Wroclaw uncovered an
"illegal" Solidarity publishing house that contained printing presses
and leaflets calling for "insubordination . . . and undertaking activities
against existing law."
The report was an implicit admission that underground union ac
tivities are going on and was seen as a warning to other rebel unionists
to cease their actions.
The latest price hikes will be the first opportunity to gauge the meas
ure of control held by the authorities who imposed martial law on Po
land Dec. 13 to halt what was seen by authorities as a slide into anarchy
and economic and social chaos.
The government, while admitting that the hikes are steep, said in an
open letter published yesterday that they are so high because previous
attempts to raise prices had been rolled back under public pressure.
"The tact that it had been put off many times in the past for political
reasons was one of the causes of the deepening economic dise
quilibrium," the official letter said.
Split court orders new sentence for youth
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday threw out a death sen
tence imposed on a defendant under the age of 18 without deciding
whether the U.S. Constitution bars the execution of all juveniles.
By a slim margin, 5-4, the court voted to release Monty Lee Eddings
from Oklahoma's death row and ordered a new sentencing for him. Ed
dings has been convicted of shooting a state patrolman on a highway
outside Tulsa when he was 16 years old.
The ruling leaves the Oklahoma courts free to sentence Eddings to
death again if they choose. But the justices ordered the state judges to
consider all relevant factors, including Eddings' family history and the
fact that at the time of the crime, he was a juvenile with "serious emo
tional problems."
In dissent, Chief Justice Warren Burger criticized the court for failing
to settle the only legal question it had agreed to resolve: whether the
Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment for
bids imposing the death penalty on someone who was 16 years old
when the crime was committed. Justices William Rehnquist, Byron
White and Harry Blackmun signed Burger's dissent.
The majority opinion throwing out Eddings' sentence was written by
Justice Lewis Powell, and was endorsed by Justices William Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.
O'Connor not only cast a decisive vote in the case but also wrote a
separate opinion defending the court's action, contradicting the chief
justice.
In their appeal to the Supreme Court, lawyers for Eddings contended
that standards and values in this country have now evolved to the point
where the execution of a juvenile should be considered "cruel and un
usual" under the Eighth Amendment.
However, the court decided not to rule on this broad Eighth Amend
ment question. Instead, it held that the Oklahoma courts erred by limit
ing the kinds of evidence that could be taken into account in sentencing
Eddings.
Reagan says unemployment rate will drop
Washington — Expressing "the greatest sympathy" for the rising
number of unemployed, President Ronald Reagan declared yesterday
that his economic program would ultimately stimulate the nation's
economy and force the unemployment rate to drop.
Unlike other recessions "of the past decade or so," Reagan said, the
government now has in place a program "that is just getting under way
that is designed to reduce the unemployment and to resolve these
problems that are so bothersome today."
With the December jobless rate at 8.9 percent — the nation's highest
since May 1975 — Reagan portrayed the problem as a continuation of a
steadily increasing rate inherited from the Carter administration.
The 1981 unemployment rate averaged 8.1 per cent, compared with
7.4 per cent for 1980, he said, and added, "But that is kind of unfair com
parison beause it was increasing very much more in the last six months
of 1980."
Moreover, the president said in his seventh press conference, since
taking office a year ago, "there are a million people more working than
there were in 1980," despite the high unemployment rate, because of
economic growth.
Reagan's comments on both the unemployment rate during former
President Carter's last year in office and on the increase in the number
of people currently employed as compared with last year are con
tradicted by official figures of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Surviving pilot calls jet show important
Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. — Air Force Capt. Dale Cooke, one of the
two surviving Thunderbird stunt pilots, said the deaths of four of his
comrades in a training accident Monday should not be the death of the

Thunderbirds.
"We have 8 million spectators," Cooke said. "The show renews a pa
triotic feeling. It is extremely important to our country."
"We're a proud unit," Cooke said. "This is a devastating blow. The
primary concern is for our families."
Cooke and other official Air Force spokesmen said they had no idea
how or why the accident happened. A board of inquiry started its in
vestigation yesterday.
The accident was the worst disaster in the 29-year history of the Thun
derbirds.
Is it worthwhile to risk your lives like this? Cooke was asked.
"We don't view it as risking our lives," he said. "Accidents can hap
pen everywhere ... I've done that maneuver maybe 300 times. I fail to
see any one facet of it that would be dangerous."
The thing that is hard about stunt flying, he said, is making it look
good. "It's harder from the point of view of aesthetics," he said, "not
risk."
The maneuver the four pilots were flying at the time of the accident is
called a "line abreast loop" and is not considered one of the more dif
ficult stunts. The four planes fly wingtip to wingtip, just a few feet apart,
at 400 miles per hour about 100 feet above the ground. Then they climb
up and loop back inside and should return to a wings-level position at
the same altitude they were when they started.
But on Monday, they looped back over and into the ground. It is pos
sible, some witnesses said, that there was a collision, but Air Force of
ficials say they just don't know.
Israel sees problem with Sinai agreements
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin is holding back Israeli
approval of the participation of four European countries in the U.S.-
sponsored multinational peace-keeping force in theSinai Peninsula un
til Israel receives additional changes in the countries' written commit
ments to join the force.
When Great Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands agreed last
Wednesday to contribute forces to the Sinai pea :e-keeping contingent,
they pulled back significantly from their original contention that partic
ipation would be linked to the European Community's Venice Declara
tion of June 1980, and its tenet that the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion must be involved in a Middle East peace agreement.
But Israeli government sources said yesterday that the new European
declarations, although an improvement over the original responses, are
"still problematical" and in need of "further clarifications or possibly
changes."
"Although they (the statements) are not polemics like the first ones,
they are still not without problems. It's not exactly what we asked for,
and we are trying to work it out quietly," an informed Israeli govern
ment official said. He said the question could be brought before the Is
raeli Cabinet on Sunday, although even more time may be needed.
"It took five weeks for the Europeans to give their answer. I don't
want to give the impression that we are dealing with this with any sense
of urgency," the Israeli official, who asked not to be identified, said.
The issue is of growing concern to the United States — which under
the Camp David accords agreed to form the 2500-member multi
national force — because only three months remain before Israel is
scheduled to complete its withdrawal from the Sinai on April 25.
Stocks decline after modest rally
New York — Underlying weakness in the stock market and extreme
uncertainty about interest rates pushed prices down yesterday, quickly
cutting short a modest one-day rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished the day off 7.71
points to 847.41. In earlier trading, the Dow was up as much as 3.33
points after gaining 7.52 points Monday.
Today's weather
