Proof positive
Proof-readers are always welcome and, of course, needed at the
Daily, but staffers are especially encouraged to peruse the reams of
magnificent magazine copy for tomorrow's special issue. Kathy

had by all.

life. (Suicide joke here censored by editor, who hasn't learned that
pretentions to good taste will get him nowhere in this business).
Pick up whatever form it is, anyway.
