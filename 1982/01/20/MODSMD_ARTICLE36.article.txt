Stanford graduate students are a diverse
lot.
The diversity can be attributed to the sheer
number of grad students — 5500 — who are
each enrolled in one of seven schools:
Business. Earth Sciences. Education.
Engineering. Humanities and Sciences. Law
and Medicine.
The essence of graduate work is studying, a
routine which leaves time for little else. But
there are common denominators between the
thousands of graduates: manv worry about
the lack of available on-campus housing and
spiraline off-campus costs, tuition costs are
depressing and dwindling research funds
plague most departments.
Grad students can be characterized by
three traits, said Jean Fetter, associate dean
of the graduate division: talent, diversity and
multi-faceted roles. (Stanford's graduate
administration iscomprisedofonedean, four
associate deans and five assistant deans.)
The "talent" aspect is self—evident, she
said and "diversity" is attributed to the
number of students from all over the world.
It is the "multi-faceted" role which is the
most complex. Fetter said. "Graduates are
students, teachers, researchers, often parents
and a lot of them work." she said. "The
graduate phase of your life is complex
because vou have so manv roles to plav. No
other clement ofStanford hasthat number of
facets."

This mav coincide with an announcement
recently made bv Cowell Health Center. The
majoritv of patients using the Counseling and
Psvcholoeical Services at Cowell are erad
students. Dr. David Dorosin. director of
those services, said.
"It is the graduates who have the greatest
pressures and problems." said Dr. Dorosin.
" Verv often these people have worked
extremely hard in order to get into their
highly-rated professional school and now
that they have succeeded it seems less
important to be there." he said. "They find
themselves doubting whether this was the
right choice for them."
Another denominator is a grad's feelings
about the Stanford community. Some grads
love the relaxed aura generated by the people
and environment which constitute the
Stanford community, while others berate the
community for its lack of social and political
awareness.
But the major common denominator
among grads seems to be that few are able to
make the attempt to get to know grads in
other schools, let alone Stanford's 6590
undergrads. Many grads meet undergrads
while serving as teacher's assistants, but Gail
Perez, a Ph.D. English candidate, said, "We
don't socialize with the undergraduates
because, as teachers, it seems inappropriate."
The lack of graduate communication
between the various schools is something
Stanford's administration says it is accutely
aware of and is trying to overcome. It's
something grads think about, maybe worry
about and regret, but it's something which is
not high on their list of priorities. The priority
is Stanford University in the academic sense.
"The general philosophv of graduate
education is that it is a salient part of this
institution's educational program," said
Albert Hastorf. vice president and provost.
He said Stanford strives to balance graduate
and undergraduate education so that the two
complement one another.
Nonetheless, Hastorf also said Stanford
"looks at graduate studentsas organized and
operated by departments" and that most
grads have little opportunity for taking
courses outside of their departments.
Another key to understanding graduate
students is separating the masters candidates
— "professionals," as Hastorf calls them —
from the doctorate candidates. The
professional programs are found in law ,
business, medicine, engineering and
communications. But most advanced degree
programs incorporate the masters program
into the doctorate program because the
University has relatively few masters
programs in its seven schools. (The number of
"professional" students, though, far
outweighs the number of doctorate
candidates.)
This separation of graduate from graduate
and graduate from undergraduate begins
ith the admissions process. All undergrads
are admitted through the dean of admissions'
office while grads applv to and are admitted
bv one department. All students, however,
receive a degree from Stanford University.
At East Coast schools such as Harvard and
Princeton, the grads and undergrads are
enrolled in separate colleges in those
institutions. Hastorf said the difference
between Stanford and Harvard and
Princeton is in name onlv. The admissions
process is identical, he said.
It's not onlv the admissions process which
is identical to East Coast schools: the quality
ofeducation is as superb and. in manvcases.
better. In a 1978 studv published bv the
American Council on Education. "Rating of
Graduate Programs." the qualitv of
Stanford's facultv was ranked among the top
five nationallv in 16 fields, a total exceeded
onl> by Berkelev and Harvard.
While man> grads said they came to
Stanford because it's a beautiful campus and
because thev w anted to live in California, the

bottom line is Stanford's reputation. "It's a
namethat rinesthe bell." Perez said.
It's a bell Terry O'Toole opted for.
O'Toole was accepted bv Harvard Law
School and received a two-year deferred
admission because he wanted to work before
beginning graduate studies — a trait common
toa growing number ofgraduate students
and desired bv businesses. O'Toole, 23,
graduated as an economics major from
Villanova University in Pennsvlvania in 1980.
Harvard seemed ideal because his family was
from Massachusetts. Then he began working
for a Philadelphia management consulting
firm and decided he would rather work on a
M BA degree.
"I chose Stanford because it had the name
and the teaching methods." O'T oole, a first
vear M BA candidate, said. "The emphasis
seemed to be on learning rather than the
competition element at Harvard."
O'Toole's decision was enhanced by
conversations with business personnel and
Stanford alumni. He's satisfied with his
choice.
"I love Stanford because it fulfills my
expectations of graduate education,"
O'T oole said. "The professors are excellent
and for the most part the program is
outstanding."
But O'Toole said the MBA program isso
intensive and self-contained that he doesn't
have much time to enjoy the aesthetic
experiences of Stanford. "There comes a time
w hen you get sick of graduate students,"
O'Toole said. But "there isa real separation
of graduates and undergraduates by the
nature of our classes.

"Sometimes we sit around and say. "Why
don't we meet more undergraduate women?"
he said. "We trv to go to Tresidder to see the
other world."
Tresidder Union, and particularlvthe
Coffee House, is frequented bv grad students.
But Gail Perez thinks the Coffee House is an
inadequate facilit\ for grad students to
socialize. She'd like to see a pubor barset up
for grads. This way. perhaps, more
interaction between grad students will occur,
she said.
There is no one place grad students meet,
either on or off campus. Most grads studv in
their respective department's libraries and
socialize at private parties or at deparment
functions.
"The chief consequence of this is that we're
ineffective politicalK." Perez said.

Gradlife is an illusion — it's
what you make of it.
We often wonder why we 're
here.
The graduate orientation
materials? I blew it off.
Between moving, registration
and exemption exams, I didn't
have time for orientation.
Undergraduates have a real
preconceived notion that all
graduates are serious. That's
true loan extent, but we're
human too and we're
interesting.
I was a grad student, an E. E.,
and from Cro Mem — that was
three strikes against me.
I have 550 compatriots. Thank
God I'm not in a department of
eight!
Everywhere else, people go to
the union — it's a forum. Here
it's just a cafeteria that
everyone avoids.
We have no class unity.
A lot of graduate students have
their own lives and are more
focused on things outside of the
University than
undergraduates.
I'm having a blast here!

But the major common
denominator among grads
seems to be that few are able
to make the attempt to get
to know grads in other
schools. . .


The lack of graduate
communication between the
various schools is something
Stanford's administration
says it is acutely aware of
and is trying to overcome.
