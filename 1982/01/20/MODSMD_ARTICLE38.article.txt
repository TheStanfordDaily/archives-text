Is there life in Cro Mem?
"There can't be much," sighed one graduate
student.
"Well, there's a movie every Thursday night —
but that's not life, that's two hours out of the week,"
said Joe Altmaier, a first-year graduate in electrical
engineering.
"You put 200 engineering grad students together
and expect it to be fun?" asked former Cro Mem
resident Jane Stepak.
Faced with such heartening responses, it was
understandably a bit difficult to muster the
fortitude needed to prove the hypothesis (only a
hypothesis, mind you) that life does indeed exist in
Cro Mem. Cro Mem, however, is a textbook case of
how deceiving appearances can be.
The dormitory founded by Harry Crothers with

the stipulation that it be used to house engineering
graduate students is not exactly as lively as a
frontier saloon. But neither is it the fearsome place
its reputation implies. "Last year," Stepak recalled,
"they had these T-shirts made up that said 'Cro
Mem Leper Colony.'"
Contrary to popular belief, Cro Mem residents
do occasionally take time out for diversions. Study
breaks every Wednesday night regularly attract 40
to 50 people, and Saturday night poker games are a
hallowed tradition.
The dorm boasts active IM football and soccer
teams, and "you can always find someone to go to
the Goose or the Commons with," said industrial
engineer Jon Johnston.
Mealtime antics also belie the ultra-intense
atmosphere which pervades Cro
Mem itself. Once, a group of Cro
Mem engineers, obviously in a
spirit of scientific inquiry, threw
a banana peel up on the light
fixture of a Wilbur dining hall.
They then proceeded to take bets
on how long it would stay up
there.
Mild surprise turned to
astonishment as days turned to
weeks, and"it was still there,
rotting away."
No, Cro Mem definitely
couldn't compete with a
fraternity for Saturday night

'merriment — though Stepak
thinks that "if you stuck 200
engineering undergrads together
the result would be about the
same."
In-house entertainment might
not be quite as noticeable as in
undergraduate dorms, but life is
active in Cro Mem. Forevery
setback like a beach party for
which no one signs up there is an
equivalent advance. One recent
(and presumably exciting) party
featured a guest who brought
along his Apple computer and
played computer games with the
merrymakers.
Yes, Virginia, there is life in
