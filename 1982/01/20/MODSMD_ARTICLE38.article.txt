said Joe Altmaier, a first-year graduate in electrical
engineering.
"You put 200 engineering grad students together
and expect it to be fun?" asked former Cro Mem
resident Jane Stepak.
Faced with such heartening responses, it was
understandably a bit difficult to muster the
fortitude needed to prove the hypothesis (only a
hypothesis, mind you) that life does indeed exist in
Cro Mem. Cro Mem, however, is a textbook case of
how deceiving appearances can be.
The dormitory founded by Harry Crothers with

the stipulation that it be used to house engineering
graduate students is not exactly as lively as a
frontier saloon. But neither is it the fearsome place
its reputation implies. "Last year," Stepak recalled,
"they had these T-shirts made up that said 'Cro
