# Money: Tuition and living costs are increasing, but students face cuts in federal funding
## 
### HEATHER MILLAR 
Graduate students trying to plan
their budget for the next year walk
a tightrope over quicksand.
The prime sources for graduate student
aid — fellowships, grants, independent
scholarships and teaching and research
assistantships — have weathered cuts in
the past and are expected to endure further
reductions this year.
In Washington, there is more talk of
proposed federal budget cuts in the
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
program, as well as general budget cuts
which would jeopardize grantstht fund
research in various University
departments. Several million dollars in
federal funds available to the University
and graduate students may be in jeopardy.
But nothing is certain until President

Ronald Reagan's budget for 1982-83, to
be announced later this month, is
approved by Congress.
"What's going to happen with the
federal government is up in the air," said
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean
of graduate studies and research.
"Funding is very volatile."
At the University level gradutes also
encounter uncertainty. The University
makes no committment to meet the full
financial need of graduate students. It
does make this committment to
undergraduates. Although the University
provided more than 3 million dollars in
fellowships to graduates last year, this aid
is not guaranteed after the fourth year in

the humanities and social sciences
programs.
"This really worries me," said Larry
Wu, a member of the Social Sciences
Graduate Student Association (SSGSA).
"How is the University going to recruit
top-notch students. . . if these conditions
continue?"
Graduate students also face
uncertainties at home. In the schools of
Businessand LawandintheM.D.
program ofthe Medical School, parents
are expected to help students financially.
In accordance with this policy, parents'
income and resources are considered in
determining the amount of financial aid.
In addition, financial aid only supports
the student, not his dependents.
"The student should make those
considerations (concerning family and
finances) before deciding to go to grad
school," said Dickey.
"It's hard to ask parents for help when
you're 25 years old and out on your own,"
said Jon Siegel, a political science student
"For little thingstheycan helpout,"said
Siegel. "But for big things, no."
Graduate students have already had to
contend with the loss of several cuts in
possible outside funding sources. "The
single biggest decrease has been outside
funding," said Dickey. "We have lost the
Ford Foundation grants, and the
Danforth Fellowships. There have been
cutbacks in others." Federal Graduate
Work-Study money was cut in half last
year. Next year it is not certain there will
be any funds from that source. The GSL
program has made its requirements more
stringent and interest rates for the loans
have gone from 7 percent last year to 9
percent this year. It has been proposed
that graduates be excluded from the GSL
program. While to date no cuts have been
made in the NSF Fellowships, last year it
was proposed that the program be
discontinued.
"It's been getting tougher and tougher,
and it's been tough; so that means it's
getting real tough," said Scott Hortstien, a
humanities student.
Among all the academic and financial
diversities of the graduate student body,
the housing problem forms a common
denominator. "I'm looking for housing
and it (costs) more than my stipend
(provides)," said Leslie Rosenberg, a
graduate student in physics. Mountain
View, a 45-minute bike ride from SLAC
where he works as a research assistant, is
the closest place Rosenberg said he could

afford to rent. This can be a "real hassle"
when SLAC is running experiments which
have shifts that run until 3 a.m.,
Rosenberg said.
Bill Kleppinger, a grad student in the
Physics Department, emphasized the
urgency of the need. "(Graduates) simply
can't afford to rent houses in this area on
the stipend the University gives them," he
said.
Last year, the University gave graduate
fellows in the humanities and sciences a
stipend of $357 a month. A survey
conducted by Lieberman's office last year
determined $242, or 68 percent of the
stipend, as the average rent graduates paid
per month last year.
Since 1976, stipends for teaching
assistants and research assistants have
fallen from more than 100 percent to less
than 80 percent of the average cost of
living as estimated by the University,
according to a Campus Report article last
spring. Four-year graduate fellowships
fell from 80 percent of living costs to less
than 60 percent, the article added.
Dickey, however, estimates this figure
to be 76 percent.
In protest of this decline, the Stanford
Fellows Association and the SSGSA
circulated a position paper around the
Stanford community last spring seeking
SI .8 million more in aid. Later, the
University increased the stipend level by
16.8 percent.
Provost A 1 Hastorf said he plans to
increase the stipends by a similiar amount
next year, but said thateven so "we're
losing ground to inflation."
"I think the fellowship level haseroded
with time," said Lieberman. "I think the
days of providing fellowship stipends that
are enough to live on are over."
Lieberman said in reference to the
proposed budget cuts that the University
is considering establishing a research
protection fund to help out "if disaster
should befall us." He described this fund
as a "nest-egg" the University would set
aside to support graduate students if
current sources of revenue are cut off. But
he emphasized that this fund is not
established vet and even if it is, the fund
will only be "one-time money" and a long
term solution would still have to be found.
"As the budget cuts hit University
funds, (the responsibility) fallson the
departments," said Hastorf. In some
departments, the shifting enrollments
decrease the need for graduate teaching
assistants, a major source of income for

most graduates. In others, administrators
have to cut corners rather than
discontinue graduate support.
In turn, students get the pinch. Eric
Berg, treasurer of the Graduate Students'
Association, estimates that graduate
students may incurasmuchasSlO.OOOin
outstanding loans by the time they finish
their program. Students complain of being
caught in a Catch-22: they're in debt
because they're in school yet it's hard to
get out of school because working for
living expenses as an RAoraTA takes
time away from working on a dissertation.
"There's a lot of statistics and charts,"


71's hard to ask parents
for help when you 're 25
years old and out on your
own. .

said Harry Mairson, a social sciences
graduate student. " But basically people
are getting screwed over. That's what the
charts say."
"What's worrying meisthat the cuts
proposed will affect the quality of the
programs... the research," said Wu. "It's
frightening for a grad student."
The areas ofhumanitiesand social
sciences arouse particular concern. "If the
recent trend in graduate support
continues," a report by the Faculty Senate

committee on graduate study said, "there
is danger that it will lead to further
shrinking of national pool of qualified
candidates for graduate study in the
humanities and social sciences, a process
that is already quite noticeable in some
departments that train graduate students
primarily to become teachers and
scholars."
Yet the "hard sciences" have not been
spared reductions. In physics, the
department has lost 8 to 12 percent of its
contract and grant funds. While the NSF

has not cut renewals in physics, it has
funded them at a lower level.
Amid the turmoil surrounding graduate
finances, some have raised the question of
whether graduates students really deserve
complete financial support. "Certainly the
students are having to put some of their
own resources intotheireducation," said
Engineering Prof. Arthur Bryson, a
member of the Faculty Senate committee
on graduate study. "But noone
guaranteed them a free ride. I think it's a
new attitude, since World War 11, that the

government owes you a free education."
"There's a lot of work done by grads,"
said Mairson in reference to current
stipend levels. "They read your term
papers; they teach your courses. They do a
lot of shit-work of the University, those
little gremlins, and they deserve to be
paid."
"Graduate students are important to
the academic life around here," said
Hastorf. "The University would like to
help them, but a 'no-cost' ride is
impossible. The pot is never bigenough.
The problem is to divide it fairly."

departments," said Hastorf. In some
departments, the shifting enrollments
decrease the need for graduate teaching
assistants, a major source of income for

most graduates. In others, administrators
have to cut corners rather than
discontinue graduate support.
In turn, students get the pinch. Eric
Berg, treasurer of the Graduate Students'
Association, estimates that graduate
students may incurasmuchasSlO.OOOin
outstanding loans by the time they finish
their program. Students complain of being
caught in a Catch-22: they're in debt
because they're in school yet it's hard to
get out of school because working for

time away from working on a dissertation.
"There's a lot of statistics and charts,"


71's hard to ask parents
for help when you 're 25
years old and out on your

said Harry Mairson, a social sciences
graduate student. " But basically people
are getting screwed over. That's what the
charts say."
"What's worrying meisthat the cuts
proposed will affect the quality of the
programs... the research," said Wu. "It's
frightening for a grad student."
The areas ofhumanitiesand social
sciences arouse particular concern. "If the
recent trend in graduate support
continues," a report by the Faculty Senate

committee on graduate study said, "there
is danger that it will lead to further
shrinking of national pool of qualified
candidates for graduate study in the
humanities and social sciences, a process
that is already quite noticeable in some
departments that train graduate students
primarily to become teachers and
scholars."
Yet the "hard sciences" have not been
spared reductions. In physics, the
department has lost 8 to 12 percent of its
contract and grant funds. While the NSF

has not cut renewals in physics, it has
funded them at a lower level.
Amid the turmoil surrounding graduate
finances, some have raised the question of
whether graduates students really deserve
complete financial support. "Certainly the
students are having to put some of their
own resources intotheireducation," said
Engineering Prof. Arthur Bryson, a
member of the Faculty Senate committee
on graduate study. "But noone
guaranteed them a free ride. I think it's a
new attitude, since World War 11, that the

government owes you a free education."
"There's a lot of work done by grads,"
said Mairson in reference to current
stipend levels. "They read your term
papers; they teach your courses. They do a
lot of shit-work of the University, those
little gremlins, and they deserve to be
paid."
"Graduate students are important to
the academic life around here," said
Hastorf. "The University would like to
help them, but a 'no-cost' ride is
impossible. The pot is never bigenough.
The problem is to divide it fairly."
Graduate students trying to plan
their budget for the next year walk
a tightrope over quicksand.
The prime sources for graduate student
aid — fellowships, grants, independent
scholarships and teaching and research
assistantships — have weathered cuts in
the past and are expected to endure further
reductions this year.
In Washington, there is more talk of
proposed federal budget cuts in the
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
program, as well as general budget cuts
which would jeopardize grantstht fund
research in various University
departments. Several million dollars in
federal funds available to the University
and graduate students may be in jeopardy.
But nothing is certain until President

Ronald Reagan's budget for 1982-83, to
be announced later this month, is
approved by Congress.
"What's going to happen with the
federal government is up in the air," said
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean
of graduate studies and research.
"Funding is very volatile."
At the University level gradutes also
encounter uncertainty. The University
makes no committment to meet the full
financial need of graduate students. It
does make this committment to
undergraduates. Although the University
provided more than 3 million dollars in
fellowships to graduates last year, this aid
is not guaranteed after the fourth year in

the humanities and social sciences
programs.
"This really worries me," said Larry
Wu, a member of the Social Sciences
Graduate Student Association (SSGSA).
"How is the University going to recruit
top-notch students. . . if these conditions
continue?"
Graduate students also face
uncertainties at home. In the schools of
Businessand LawandintheM.D.
program ofthe Medical School, parents
are expected to help students financially.
In accordance with this policy, parents'
income and resources are considered in
determining the amount of financial aid.
In addition, financial aid only supports
the student, not his dependents.
"The student should make those
considerations (concerning family and
finances) before deciding to go to grad
school," said Dickey.
"It's hard to ask parents for help when
you're 25 years old and out on your own,"
said Jon Siegel, a political science student
"For little thingstheycan helpout,"said
Siegel. "But for big things, no."
Graduate students have already had to
contend with the loss of several cuts in
possible outside funding sources. "The
single biggest decrease has been outside
funding," said Dickey. "We have lost the
Ford Foundation grants, and the
Danforth Fellowships. There have been
cutbacks in others." Federal Graduate
Work-Study money was cut in half last
year. Next year it is not certain there will
be any funds from that source. The GSL
program has made its requirements more
stringent and interest rates for the loans
have gone from 7 percent last year to 9
percent this year. It has been proposed
that graduates be excluded from the GSL
program. While to date no cuts have been
made in the NSF Fellowships, last year it
was proposed that the program be
discontinued.
"It's been getting tougher and tougher,
and it's been tough; so that means it's
getting real tough," said Scott Hortstien, a
humanities student.
Among all the academic and financial
diversities of the graduate student body,
the housing problem forms a common
denominator. "I'm looking for housing
and it (costs) more than my stipend
(provides)," said Leslie Rosenberg, a
graduate student in physics. Mountain
View, a 45-minute bike ride from SLAC
where he works as a research assistant, is
the closest place Rosenberg said he could

afford to rent. This can be a "real hassle"
when SLAC is running experiments which
have shifts that run until 3 a.m.,
Rosenberg said.
Bill Kleppinger, a grad student in the
Physics Department, emphasized the
urgency of the need. "(Graduates) simply
can't afford to rent houses in this area on
the stipend the University gives them," he
said.
Last year, the University gave graduate
fellows in the humanities and sciences a
stipend of $357 a month. A survey
conducted by Lieberman's office last year
determined $242, or 68 percent of the
stipend, as the average rent graduates paid
per month last year.
Since 1976, stipends for teaching
assistants and research assistants have
fallen from more than 100 percent to less
than 80 percent of the average cost of
living as estimated by the University,
according to a Campus Report article last
spring. Four-year graduate fellowships
fell from 80 percent of living costs to less
than 60 percent, the article added.
Dickey, however, estimates this figure
to be 76 percent.
In protest of this decline, the Stanford
Fellows Association and the SSGSA
circulated a position paper around the
Stanford community last spring seeking
SI .8 million more in aid. Later, the
University increased the stipend level by
16.8 percent.
Provost A 1 Hastorf said he plans to
increase the stipends by a similiar amount
next year, but said thateven so "we're
losing ground to inflation."
"I think the fellowship level haseroded
with time," said Lieberman. "I think the
days of providing fellowship stipends that
are enough to live on are over."
Lieberman said in reference to the
proposed budget cuts that the University
is considering establishing a research
protection fund to help out "if disaster
should befall us." He described this fund
as a "nest-egg" the University would set
aside to support graduate students if
current sources of revenue are cut off. But
he emphasized that this fund is not
established vet and even if it is, the fund
will only be "one-time money" and a long
term solution would still have to be found.
"As the budget cuts hit University
funds, (the responsibility) fallson the
departments," said Hastorf. In some
departments, the shifting enrollments
decrease the need for graduate teaching

"It's been getting tougher and tougher,
and it's been tough; so that means it's
getting real tough," said Scott Hortstien, a
humanities student.
Among all the academic and financial
diversities of the graduate student body,
the housing problem forms a common
denominator. "I'm looking for housing
and it (costs) more than my stipend
(provides)," said Leslie Rosenberg, a
graduate student in physics. Mountain
View, a 45-minute bike ride from SLAC
where he works as a research assistant, is
the closest place Rosenberg said he could

afford to rent. This can be a "real hassle"
when SLAC is running experiments which
have shifts that run until 3 a.m.,
Rosenberg said.
Bill Kleppinger, a grad student in the
Physics Department, emphasized the
urgency of the need. "(Graduates) simply
can't afford to rent houses in this area on
the stipend the University gives them," he
said.
Last year, the University gave graduate
fellows in the humanities and sciences a
stipend of $357 a month. A survey
conducted by Lieberman's office last year
determined $242, or 68 percent of the
stipend, as the average rent graduates paid
per month last year.
Since 1976, stipends for teaching
assistants and research assistants have
fallen from more than 100 percent to less
than 80 percent of the average cost of
living as estimated by the University,
according to a Campus Report article last
spring. Four-year graduate fellowships
fell from 80 percent of living costs to less
than 60 percent, the article added.
Dickey, however, estimates this figure
to be 76 percent.
In protest of this decline, the Stanford
Fellows Association and the SSGSA
circulated a position paper around the
Stanford community last spring seeking
SI .8 million more in aid. Later, the
University increased the stipend level by
16.8 percent.
Provost A 1 Hastorf said he plans to
increase the stipends by a similiar amount
next year, but said thateven so "we're
losing ground to inflation."
"I think the fellowship level haseroded
with time," said Lieberman. "I think the
days of providing fellowship stipends that
are enough to live on are over."
Lieberman said in reference to the
proposed budget cuts that the University
is considering establishing a research
protection fund to help out "if disaster
should befall us." He described this fund
as a "nest-egg" the University would set
aside to support graduate students if
current sources of revenue are cut off. But
he emphasized that this fund is not
established vet and even if it is, the fund
will only be "one-time money" and a long
term solution would still have to be found.
"As the budget cuts hit University
funds, (the responsibility) fallson the
departments," said Hastorf. In some
departments, the shifting enrollments
decrease the need for graduate teaching
assistants, a major source of income for

most graduates. In others, administrators
have to cut corners rather than
discontinue graduate support.
In turn, students get the pinch. Eric
Berg, treasurer of the Graduate Students'
Association, estimates that graduate
students may incurasmuchasSlO.OOOin
outstanding loans by the time they finish
their program. Students complain of being
caught in a Catch-22: they're in debt
because they're in school yet it's hard to
get out of school because working for
living expenses as an RAoraTA takes
time away from working on a dissertation.
"There's a lot of statistics and charts,"


71's hard to ask parents
for help when you 're 25
years old and out on your
own. .

said Harry Mairson, a social sciences
graduate student. " But basically people
are getting screwed over. That's what the
charts say."
"What's worrying meisthat the cuts
proposed will affect the quality of the
programs... the research," said Wu. "It's
frightening for a grad student."
The areas ofhumanitiesand social
sciences arouse particular concern. "If the
recent trend in graduate support
continues," a report by the Faculty Senate

committee on graduate study said, "there
is danger that it will lead to further
shrinking of national pool of qualified
candidates for graduate study in the
humanities and social sciences, a process
that is already quite noticeable in some
departments that train graduate students
primarily to become teachers and
scholars."
Yet the "hard sciences" have not been
spared reductions. In physics, the
department has lost 8 to 12 percent of its
contract and grant funds. While the NSF

has not cut renewals in physics, it has
funded them at a lower level.
Amid the turmoil surrounding graduate
finances, some have raised the question of
whether graduates students really deserve
complete financial support. "Certainly the
students are having to put some of their
own resources intotheireducation," said
Engineering Prof. Arthur Bryson, a
member of the Faculty Senate committee
on graduate study. "But noone
guaranteed them a free ride. I think it's a
new attitude, since World War 11, that the

government owes you a free education."
"There's a lot of work done by grads,"
said Mairson in reference to current
stipend levels. "They read your term
papers; they teach your courses. They do a
lot of shit-work of the University, those
little gremlins, and they deserve to be
paid."
"Graduate students are important to
the academic life around here," said
Hastorf. "The University would like to
help them, but a 'no-cost' ride is
impossible. The pot is never bigenough.
The problem is to divide it fairly."
Graduate students trying to plan
their budget for the next year walk
a tightrope over quicksand.
The prime sources for graduate student
aid — fellowships, grants, independent
scholarships and teaching and research
assistantships — have weathered cuts in
the past and are expected to endure further
reductions this year.
In Washington, there is more talk of
proposed federal budget cuts in the
Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL)
program, as well as general budget cuts
which would jeopardize grantstht fund
research in various University
departments. Several million dollars in
federal funds available to the University
and graduate students may be in jeopardy.
But nothing is certain until President

Ronald Reagan's budget for 1982-83, to
be announced later this month, is
approved by Congress.
"What's going to happen with the
federal government is up in the air," said
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean
of graduate studies and research.
"Funding is very volatile."
At the University level gradutes also
encounter uncertainty. The University
makes no committment to meet the full
financial need of graduate students. It
does make this committment to
undergraduates. Although the University
provided more than 3 million dollars in
fellowships to graduates last year, this aid
is not guaranteed after the fourth year in

the humanities and social sciences
programs.
"This really worries me," said Larry
Wu, a member of the Social Sciences
Graduate Student Association (SSGSA).
"How is the University going to recruit
top-notch students. . . if these conditions
continue?"
Graduate students also face
uncertainties at home. In the schools of
Businessand LawandintheM.D.
program ofthe Medical School, parents
are expected to help students financially.
In accordance with this policy, parents'
income and resources are considered in
determining the amount of financial aid.
In addition, financial aid only supports
the student, not his dependents.
"The student should make those
considerations (concerning family and
finances) before deciding to go to grad
school," said Dickey.
"It's hard to ask parents for help when
you're 25 years old and out on your own,"
said Jon Siegel, a political science student
"For little thingstheycan helpout,"said
Siegel. "But for big things, no."
Graduate students have already had to
contend with the loss of several cuts in
possible outside funding sources. "The
single biggest decrease has been outside
funding," said Dickey. "We have lost the
Ford Foundation grants, and the
Danforth Fellowships. There have been
cutbacks in others." Federal Graduate
Work-Study money was cut in half last
year. Next year it is not certain there will
be any funds from that source. The GSL
program has made its requirements more
stringent and interest rates for the loans
have gone from 7 percent last year to 9
percent this year. It has been proposed
that graduates be excluded from the GSL
program. While to date no cuts have been
made in the NSF Fellowships, last year it
was proposed that the program be
discontinued.
"It's been getting tougher and tougher,
and it's been tough; so that means it's
getting real tough," said Scott Hortstien, a
humanities student.
