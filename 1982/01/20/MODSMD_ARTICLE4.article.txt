# Kennedy paints money woes
## 
### Adam Goodman 
The next two years will be "very
difficult" financially for the Univer
sity, but no dramatic cuts are ex
pected for major academic programs
this year, President Donald Kennedy
told the ASSU Senate last night.
Kennedy criticized the Reagan ad
ministration's financial policies and
said he was "concerned but not dis
mayed" by the government's actions.
"Nothing is going our way now in
terms of federal policy," Kennedy
said. "It is not something which can
be done without hurting the hell out
of us (the University)."
According to Kennedy, to meet its
economictroubles the University not
only will have to raise student tuition,
but also will have to search for funds
elsewhere. Kennedy said this will be
especially difficult if the University
wishes to retain its current financial
aid efforts for students, efforts Ken
nedy says he "will defend to the very
last ditch.
"We must reallocate general funds
for other purposes. You don't specif
ically make up the financial aid losses
by raising tuition," he said.
Kennedy said he had to admit the
possibility existed for University pro
grams to be cut in the University's
belt-tightening measures. He said he
would probably be "much more
worried a year from now."
When asked how to prioritize Uni
versity programs, Kennedy replied,
"Only the things we care most about
are going to survive."
The University's increasing ties
with business, as in the area of genet
ic licensing, would not provide "a
quick fix" to its money woes, Ken
nedy said. He said such opportunities
are "very long term" and that in fact
he sees no dramatic revenue increas
ing opportunities for the University
to take.
Student groups may be experienc
ing similar financial difficulties, as
ASSU Student Financial Manager
Cynthia Mathewson reported that
approximately 380 students re
quested winter quarter fee
assessment refunds yesterday. She
estimated that more than $7500 in re
funds were given out yesterday and
about $6000 in refunds were handed

back Monday.
Kennedy's comments come in the
midst of the ASSU-University finan
cial negotiations. Kennedy declined
to specifically comment on the nego
tiations since he has not been in
volved in them.
However, Kennedy said he would
be receptive to the idea of some stu
dent-run programs replacing Uni
versity-run programs. "I am en
couraging the ASSU to investigate
areas where students could provide a
service in which now the service is
provided to them," he said.
Kennedy said an "administrational
skepticism" of dealings with the
ASSU existed because the organiza
tion suffered from "a generational
problem.
"The students whom you are asked
to believe today are not the ones
(who are) going to be around tomor
row (to carry out the terms of the
agreement)," he said.
While Kennedy praised the Uni

versity's committee system which al
lows the ASSU to appoint student
representatives, he was critical of the
belief "that every particular subset of
the student population must be pres
ent there."
He said he believed students were
most effective when they repre
sented themselves as students and
not as representatives of certain
groups. "Effectiveness has nothing to
do with representativeness," he said.
Also at their meeting last night,
ASSU senators approved a graduate
districting bill which would divide
the 10 graduate senatorial and alter
nate seats among six districts. The dis
tricts would include the schools of
business; education; engineering;
humanities/sciences/earth sciences;
law; and medicine. Human
ities/sciences/earth sciences and en
gineering would receive three senate
and three alternate positions while
other schools would have one senate
and alternate seat.
