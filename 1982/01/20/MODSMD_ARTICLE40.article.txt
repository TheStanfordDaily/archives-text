# Politics: Graduate senators' absence from meetings may indicate problem in representation system
## 
### ADAM GOODMAN 
Second-year law student Michael
Calabrese has an understanding of
student government. In fact, back at
Harvard as an undergraduate Calabrese
savs he was in charge of organizing the
student association. Last spring he was the
second highest vote-getter among
graduate students in the ASSU senate
elections.
Yet as of today, Calabrese has not
attended a single ASSU senate meeting.
And he is not alone among graduate
senators and alternates with poor
attendance records.
Calabrese is only one of many graduate
senators over the past years who have
failed to attend meetings after being
elected. In an election with only nine
candidates listed on the ballot, in which
the top vote-getter only received 174 votes
and in which the last seven senate
alternates elected were write-ins tied with
two votes each, Calabrese said he did not
have difficulty gettingelected. He points
to this lack of interest in electionsto
explain whvthe turnout of graduate
senators at meetings is so low.
"I think one of the reasons for the
sparse attendance is that (graduate
senators) are just filling seats that would
otherwise be vacant. I feel as if I didn't
even run," Calabrese said.
Calabrese said he and some fellow law
students decided to run for the senate in
last spring's election only 10 minutes
before senate petitions were due because
they heard so few people were running for
office. "A lot of people run who wouldn't
if (the election) was competitive. It's sort
of a volunteer thing."
According to Eric Berg, treasurer of the
Graduate Student Association (GSA), the
weak representative relationship between
graduate students and the ASSU is a "self
perpetuating process."
"The ASSU isn't seen as doing a lot of
things for graduate students. . .and not
seen as having power over graduate issues.

It's not an attractive thing for graduate
students to be involved in."
Berg says one of the reasons the ASSU
senate is not attractive to graduate
students is because it performs so many
"housekeeping" duties. "The senate
spendsa lot ofitstime dealing with the
functions and structure of the ASSU in
particular. A graduate student who wants
to be involved in the University would
rather do something with immediate
effects on specific issues."
Berg said grad students may join
University committees, such as the
Committee on Graduate Studies, on
which thev can have a "direct" effect.
"There are so few graduate students
anyway who want to be involved that it's
hard to completely condemn that
attitude," he said.

Without participation from grad
students the senate has difficulty in trying
to deal with graduate issues, as evidenced
by a senate student affairs committee
report last quarter. In an effort to improve
communication between students and the
senate, the committee asked for the
voluntary districting of the entire senate
by residential areas. Since few grad
students live on campus, grad senators
would not have been able to represent
their peers very well.
"It (residential representation) was
totally wrong from the graduate
viewpoint," explains graduate Senator
Jim McGrath. "But then (the) student
affairs (committee) had no graduates on

it."
Instead, the senate adopted Tuesday a
bill for departmental representation,
thereby implementing the graduate
districting constitutional amendment
passed in last spring's election. The plan
will divide the 10 senate and 10 alternate
graduate seats among six districts.
The new districts include the
professional schools of Business,
Education, Law, and Medicine, as well as
the schools of Engineering and of
Humanities/Sciences /Earth Sciences.
The professional schools will each get one
senator and one alternate seat, while the
other two schools will each elect three
senators and three alternates.
The senate decided that departmental
districts will aid communication between
graduates and the ASSU better than

geographic districts since graduate
students live in so many different areas on
and off campus. "It's a lot more difficult
to get in touch with graduate students.
Communication is directly related with
community. While there is that feeling (of
community) at the undergraduate level,
from the graduate perspective there is
not," Jackson said.
According to Deputy Senate Chair Roc
Blumenthal, it's not easy foran
undergraduate to try to represent
graduate students' views. "It's hard for me
as an undergraduate to fight for graduate
issues. Undergraduates don't have the
perspective and so it's hard for the
(University) administration to respect our

opinion.
"I really believe the ASSU is not
recognized by the graduate community as
being able to do anything for them, and I
really think that is true of the University as
well. It makes our position even more
treacherous when both the group we're
representing and who we're representing
them to don't recognize us."
Some graduate senators see additional
reasons for the distinct contrast in the
ASSU involvement of undergraduate and
graduate students. "Undergraduate
senators are in it for the resume to a
certain extent," said graduate Senator
Charlie Jackson. "The reason I show up is
because I like to be in on what's going on
on campus. There's a lot of bickering and
long meetings that is part and parcel of
what goes on . . . Being a senator is not for
everybody."
As for improving representation,
Blumenthal said he believes, "Districting
(by department) will help promote a
community spirit, campaigning, and issue
development," but said he is unsure of
how much it will actually helpout the
situation. He blames the strained
relationship on the ASSU's inability to
"adapt to the growth of the graduate
student population during the 19605."
Blumenthal said he foresees the possible
creation of a separate student association
for grad students, and said that this might
be the best way to increase graduate
involvement. This group, he said, could be
political in nature and would not
necessarily be the the current GSA.
Blumenthal said he sees the feasibility of
the ASSU linking separate undergraduate
and graduate political bodies. "At other
schools graduate students and
undergraduate students are linked by a
board. I think districting will provide the
ASSU with enough information to better
base a decision in the future."
Berg, however, says he does not think
the GSA would currently want to become
a separate student government.

representation) was
