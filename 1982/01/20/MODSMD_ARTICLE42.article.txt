# Gerald Lieberman:
## The 						man responsible for grad student affairs here proves to be an enthusiastic administrator 
### DOUGLAS JEHL 
Vice Provost and Dean of Graduate
Studies and Research. Like many
within the University, the title is
quitea mouthful.
The job itself would be better described
as a handful. Gerald Lieberman, the man
behind the label, must juggle
responsibility for the affairs of 5500
graduate students and countless research
projects here.
Evidently, Lieberman carries the
burden with ease. Colleagues like Jean
Fetter, associate dean of graduate studies,
have said Lieberman "wears a number of
hats" but never appears overworked or
pressured. "I have never seen him without
a smile on his face. . . and I've never had a
question he couldn't answer," Fetter said.
Lieberman even volunteered to wear an
"extra hat" when he was named to his
present post in the fall of 1980: he took on
the dual responsibility for grad students
and research. The posts had been separate
for the 10 years preceding his
administration.
"I admire him tremendously," Fetter
said. "He's one of the most experienced
administrators at Stanford."
Lieberman's experience must have
looked good to those who named him to
his present post in the fall of 1980. A
professor of statistics and operations
research, Lieberman had served as acting
provost under President Richard Lyman,
and had been a Stanford graduate student
himself.
Lieberman played down the complexity
of his job during a recent interview ("I

spend most of my time writing memos,"
he quipped) but said later that it is
simplistic to call him the advocate for
graduate affairs at Stanford.
For one thing, Lieberman, a tall,
graying man, insists that he is just as
concerned with undergraduate education
as with graduate. Two reasons for this are
his children: Daughter Joanne and son
Michael are currently undergraduates at
Stanford. Another is hisexperience within
the University: Lieberman served as a
freshman adviser until this year and said
that his present duties as vice provost in
charge of faculty relations prevent him
from having any parochial interest in
graduateeducation.
In fact, Lieberman said, there is
virtually no inter-administration conflict
about budget allocations for graduate as

opposed to undergraduate studies. "We're
sympathetic to each other's needs," he
said, "and 'Katch'(Deanof
Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian) and I have a close
working relationship — we're good
friends."
Diane Middlebrook, associate dean of
undergraduate studies and the acting dean
during Katchadourian's sabbatical,
agreed with Lieberman's assessment of the
relationship between the two
departments, saying that they keep in
close contact and have "congruent
concerns."
Recently, these concerns have mostly
been financial ones. Budget cuts proposed
by the Reagan administration have "very,
very serious implications on Stanford,"
Lieberman said, and will especially hurt
financial aid and research. He said that the
federal allocations for Stanford's work
study program for grad students were
halved to $60,000 this year, and expressed
deep concern that these allocations might
not exist at all next year. He also worried
about possible cuts in research grants
which currently fund more than 1000
research assistant jobs here. "We are very
dependent on the federal government" for
research funding, Lieberman said. He
explained that a cut would hurt grad
students because virtually every research
proposal here involves grads.
To try to maintain the flowof federal
funds to the University, Lieberman travels
to Washington ("much more often than
I'd like," he said) but has also had to spend
time investigating alternate sources of

revenue if he and others are unable to
persuade federal officials to modify their
proposal.
Not all of Lieberman's duties are
finance-related. The refusal by Stanford
and other universities to continuing
requests from the federal government that
t he schools restrict the research done by
foreign students has placed pressure on
Lieberman to function as a University
spokesman on the issue.
Lieberman said that most of the time his
primary concern is graduate students
themselves. "I'm here to resolve problems
that can't be solved at a lower level —
within the department or school." When
the problems deal with money — as they
often do in this inflationary time of rising
tuition, housing, and food — Lieberman
shows a great deal of sensitivity to the

plight of thegrad student, although he
joked that some grad students might find
that hard to believe.
He emphasized that it was ridiculous to
assume that grad students could live in the
Stanford area on the stipends the
University was providing when he took
over, Lieberman said. "We've made some
inroads, such as a 17.6 percent increase in
stipends last year. But with inflation, that
doesn't make up for much of the original
problem. I'm fighting hard to bring about
another increase, but I can't promise
anything."
Lieberman said that comments that
grad students don't really get involved in
the University during their time here
might seem true from some perspectives.
But he said this is because most of them
don't have time for much besides
academics.
"In most cases," Lieberman said, "a
grad student's home is his department, by
and large. . . For example, I don't think
that many M.B.A. candidates get much
beyond the biz school." He said that what
many perceive as apathy is merely a
"concentration of energy" into the
department or school.
As for the Graduate Students
Association, the one graduate student
group that has made inroads in becoming
involved with the University as a whole,
Lieberman offered, "I don't know if it will
ever be an important part of graduate
student life, but it would be nice if it were."
His cumbersome title doesn't seem to
have much burden on Lieberman's
energy. And even the multi-faceted
Jim Backer/Daily

responsibilities of his job don't take up all
his time. Although he sometimes has to
take his work home with him
("unfortunately!" he said) he has a
plethora of other things that take up his
time.
Fetter calls him a "sportsman," and,
judging from his activities and interests,
this label seems as good as his official one
within the University.
He chairs the University committee on
Athletics, Physical Education, and
Recreation, an advisory group that
reports to both President Donald
Kennedy and Athletic Director Andy
Geiger. One of the things the group is
doing now, Lieberman said, is
investigating the possibilities of upgrading
various sports from club to varsity status
or vice versa.

Perhaps it is one of his office
decorations that best portrays Lieberman
as the "sportsman" that his colleagues
describe him as. Hung on the wall of the
office — a comfortable, well-decorated
room hidden away on the second floor of
an Inner Quad building — is a huge blow
up of a Daily photograph taken as time
ran out in the 1979 Stanford — UCLA
football game. Cardinal kicker Ken Naber
has just drilled a 56-yard field goal to beat
the Bruins and he and quarterback John
Elway are jubilantly hugging each other.
Lieberman stands on the sidelines,
wearing a huge floppy hat over his balding
head and grinning from ear to ear.
"I've always felt that that picture
captures the essence of the man: always
enthusiastic, always smiling," said Fetter.
This enthusiasm is a Lieberman
trademark: Middlebrook recalled that she
truly enjoyed Lieberman's "enthusaistic
style of government."
Lieberman, a San Francisco resident,
insists that he isn't merely a Cardinal fan.
Like many in the Bay Area this week, he
insists that he has been a San Francisco
49er fan for many years. "Don't ask me
how many times I gave the tickets away,"
Lieberman pleaded.
Besides sports, Lieberman enjoys
gadgets ("My children call me a
'gadgeteer,' " he said) like the new home
microcomputer on which he does virtually
all his writing. He complains, however,
that the computer won't handle the
mathematical writing necessary for his
work in statistics and operations research.
His textbook, Introduction to Operations
Research, is in its fourth edition.
Although he seems to be enjoying his
job, Lieberman doesn't intend to be a dean
forever. The average term is about five
years, he said. "Any more than that and
you don't make it back to what's really
important — teaching."
He did have a hint as to the identity of
the next occupant of his office. "It will be
an English professor," he said with a
twinkle in his eye. How does he know? It's
just an educated guess: Lieberman is fifth
in a succession of deans of graduate
studies who have been, in order: a
professor of statistics, of English, of
statistics, of English and of statistics.
