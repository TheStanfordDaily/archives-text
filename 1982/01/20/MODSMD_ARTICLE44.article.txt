# RDT fights the past, present and themselves

### MARTHA CARTER CATHY POLING 
As the lights started to fade in Memorial Auditorium for the
beginning of Repertory Dance Theatre's Friday night performance, I
sat back to see if they couldpossiblv live up to the standards that they
maintained as written in the program notes. Without hesitation, they
describe themselves as a "unique phenomenon" among modern dance
companies: a company that has held and achieved goals beyond those
of anv other company in the West: a "Living National Treasure."
And granted, they have achieved one very unique goal. In 1979, they
began a compilation of some of the early treasures of modern
American dance heritage. This program, performed Friday night and
entitled Then . . . the Early Years of Modern Dance is a unified
presentation of works characterizing the choreography of the most
prominent pilgrimsof modern dance. Starting with Isadora Duncan,
R DT explores in dance and narration, the works of Ruth St. Denis,
Ted Shawn. Helen Tamiris, Rudolph Laben. Hanva Holm, Doris
Humphrey, and ( harles Weidman. It is an attempt to educate
audiences of the evolution of technique, styles, and attitudes in
modern dance and it works pretty well. They do not recreate exactly
the steps, music or costumes, feeling that it would be both impossible
and blasphemous. Instead, they try to perform the dances with the
sincerity and conviction of dancers today, recreating the vision and
the emotional content of the works.
The first pieces, reconstruction of Isadora Duncan's choreography.

were a good indication of the succesl of the company's historical
program. The impact of the women pressed in floating white costumes
with their hair long down their backland pale skin with make-up
accentuating their features, carried ifreaudience back to the early
I9oo's as if they were watching an oil film. It occurred to me how
much easier it is to learn and understand something like historical
modern dance b\ watching. hearingjand feeling rather than reading a
drv encyclopedia. The music startedvuh clear Chopin and Schubert
piano waltzes and preludes, and the movement was simple, yet flowing
in the rh> thm of nature's waves — afciythm that was the basis of
Isadora's sty le. Regardless of my initial doubts, it was easy to slip into
RDT's vision of the past.
Still, there were a few problems Tie show was smoothly, almost
too smoothly rehearsed as the nine lancers took turns dancing and
narrating. I imagine that the compaiy has performed this program
repeatedh since it was conceived, hijvever. this is no excuse for the
narrators to become mechanical anifor the dancers, portraying
dancers of another time, to dance utihout emotion. After all. if they,
wish to perform with the conviction Ind sincerity of dancers today,
then the\ should also reveal their personal emotions of today.
Repertors Dance Theatre's seconidperformance entitled A
Program of Contemporary Choreogmphers, exemplified the more
contemporary diversity of style andkchnique in the company.
Completely different than the previous evening. Saturday's
performance was pure entertainmeitrather than a documentary.

The% performed four long and varied works indicating strength, unity
and a good sense of humor. "Presto." the first piece on the program
was the onl> selection created by an RDT dancer. And. although the
other three pieces by Viola Farber. Kathryn Posin and Bill Evans were
technicallv precise and appealing to the audience, there was. like the
night before, a slight lack of presence — of warmth. Although the
com pans is technically strong and unified, it seems as if their attempt
to build a diverse repertory of the works of American choreographers
detracts from their own. personal self identity.
The\ alluded to this problem in their Thursday evening lecture
demonstration. B> comparing the dancers to musicians who are
expected to interpret, in their own style, the music of many different
eras and composers, they explained that dancers are not as ready to
give a personal interpretation. Togain enough confidence with
another person's movements so as to interpret it with both accuracy
and personal flair is one of the most difficult goals for a dancer to
achieve. Unfortunately. with RDT's ambitious goals of establishing a
w ide and varied repertory of both historical and contemporary
modern dance, the company may be facing these challenges for a
while.
Repertorx Dance Theatre is presenting a unique program, and I
suppose that their historical achievements are a kind of a
phenomenon. The> have a great deal to offer, but they didn't quite
convince me that they are America's "Living National Treasure."
Well, not >et. anyway. But. they are certainly on the right track.

As the lights started to fade in Memorial Auditorium for the
beginning of Repertory Dance Theatre's Friday night performance, I
sat back to see if they couldpossiblv live up to the standards that they
maintained as written in the program notes. Without hesitation, they
describe themselves as a "unique phenomenon" among modern dance
companies: a company that has held and achieved goals beyond those
of anv other company in the West: a "Living National Treasure."
And granted, they have achieved one very unique goal. In 1979, they
began a compilation of some of the early treasures of modern
American dance heritage. This program, performed Friday night and
entitled Then . . . the Early Years of Modern Dance is a unified
presentation of works characterizing the choreography of the most
prominent pilgrimsof modern dance. Starting with Isadora Duncan,
R DT explores in dance and narration, the works of Ruth St. Denis,
Ted Shawn. Helen Tamiris, Rudolph Laben. Hanva Holm, Doris
Humphrey, and ( harles Weidman. It is an attempt to educate
audiences of the evolution of technique, styles, and attitudes in
modern dance and it works pretty well. They do not recreate exactly
the steps, music or costumes, feeling that it would be both impossible
and blasphemous. Instead, they try to perform the dances with the
sincerity and conviction of dancers today, recreating the vision and
the emotional content of the works.
The first pieces, reconstruction of Isadora Duncan's choreography.

were a good indication of the succesl of the company's historical
program. The impact of the women pressed in floating white costumes
with their hair long down their backland pale skin with make-up
accentuating their features, carried ifreaudience back to the early
I9oo's as if they were watching an oil film. It occurred to me how
