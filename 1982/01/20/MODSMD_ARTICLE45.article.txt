# Singing the praises of B.B.'s blues

B. B. King and Bobby "Blue" Bland
Circle Star Theater/San Carlos
15 January 1982
It was a blues bonanza. Bobby "Blue"
Bland and B. B. King played blues bluer
than California skies last Friday night at
San Carlos' Circle Star Theater. The show
was also hotter than a summer afternoon
in this state. Bland was anything but bland
and King wasevery bit of a regal figure
himself.
B. B. wasted no time revealing his secret
to the audience. In his first song he
shouted, "Every day I hear the blues."
And the packed house heard the blues, too
— like they'd never heard them before.
King's regality was two-fold. First, his
hearty voice told and sung humorous tales
always involving human relationships
with that unmistakable B. B. King blues
rhythm as a backdrop. Second, when he
wasn't using his voice, B. B. stepped back
from the microphone and communicated
through "Lucille," his famed guitar.
Despite his age (50 plus), King still plays a
mean guitar and has not lost an ounce of
speed or accuracy.
Hence, his performance was two treats
in one — like that double scoop ice cream
cone your father never bought for you.
What makes King and Lucille so high
and mighty is the emotional element he
employs so eloquently. After a few quick
solos, one begins to believe that King was
born with his guitar as a third leg or arm.
Or, better yet, as a second heart.
Bland opened the blues bonanza with
an hour's worth of his greatest hits. Bland
does not play guitar, but is the owner of a
voice that was created with singing the
blues in mind. He is famous for a sort of
gurgling trill he makes from his throat and
took full advantage of this unique ability.
Furthermore, blues singers all seem to fit
the same mold — tall, overweight frames
with vocal cords like barbed wires. Bland
is no exception.

King, however, a short, stocky
character, was built in a refrigerator <
factory with only one major defect. He is /
not a cold person, but the type of guy you jj
can't help but admire. Every time he sang J
a note or played one on Lucille, one's
immediate reaction was to break out a
huge, gaping smile — almost as wide as the
one tattooed on King's face.
King and the B. B. King Orchestra
alternated fast and slow blues tunes
throughout their 90-minute set. At one
point, he described how women "fire"
their aged husbands, a statement met with
"I'll hire you, B. 8.," by some of the older
female members of the audience. In the
middle of the show, King and company
did some "reminiscing" of his older hits,
going back as far as the 19505, the first of
which was"Darling I Love You." You
can just imagine the crowd response; the
old ladies young at heart had a field day.

The B. B. King Orchestra is almost as |
talented as B. B. himself. The back-up
group directed by trumpet player Calvin
Owen consists of a three-man horn
section, a drummer, a rhythm guitarist, a
bassist, and a keyboard player. Unlike
many so-called orchestras, King's back
ups each possess a unique onstage

character, which they do not hesitate to
express. For example, trumpeteer James
Bowden, a rather large man, danced quite
enthusiastically from start to finish. King
introduced him as follows: "Some people
like to shake their booty some of the time,
but he likes to shake his booty a//the
time!" The overall effect of such
individualism was a much closer
band/audience relationship.
Near the end of the concert, King
coaxed Bland to come on stage and help
him with a few more tunes. "Blue" obliged
and sang some magnificent duets with
King. It was a sight to behold, a feeling to
remember. The amount of excitement and
pure joy generated by these two musical
magicians sent a tingle down one's spine
that traveled down to the tips of his toes.
Smiles were mandatory.
