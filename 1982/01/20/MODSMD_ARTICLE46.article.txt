"In a hav his pictures are like a transcendent juggling act
in which it seems that the whole universe is in exquisite
flying motion and the one point of repose is the juggler's
effortless, uninterested face.
— James Agee
Busier Keaton — all of whose major films are being
shown at the Cento Cedar Theatre in San Francisco
between Januarv22 and February 16 — was bom in a
trunk. His parents, Joseph Hallie and Myrna Cutler
Keaton, were vaudevillians, performing in Piqua, Kansas
at the time of his birth, in October of 1895; he made his
first stage appearance the following year when he crawled
unexpectedly on stage during his parents' act, and joined
it officially in 1898. "Buster" was a nickname awarded
him by Harry Houdini when, asa six-month-old child,
Keaton fell down a flight of stairs in a theatrical
boardinghouse and emerged unscathed. This was the first
example of his legendary resilience — which became a
staple of his screen persona — but not the last in his
childhood, or even the most outlandish. David Robinson
in his monograph on Keaton tells of the day in July 1898
when "in r jick succession he tangled his fingers in the
cogs of a wringer, brained himself with a rock which he
had thrown up to dislodge a peach from a tree, and was
sucked by a cyclone out of his hotel room and carried a
block or more to be deposited in the street, unharmed."
Imagine the vision of the world evolved by a child so
batted about bv it, and yet so seemingly immune to its
disasters. The character Keaton played in all but his early
two-reelers (in which he supported his mentor, the gifted
and ill-fated Fattv Arbuckle) was tossed by floods and
cyclones, shot at by feuding southerners, chased by cops
and cattle — and yet he always resurfaced, only slightly
rumpled, and without a crinkle in that celebrated
deadpan. If Chaplin dealt with a hostile world by
remaining its sweetest and most delicate victim, and
Harold Lloyd conquered it by his particular brand of
Horatio Alger go-getterism, Keaton's answer was simply
to survive — to bob up again no matter how severe the
trial. This may make his movies more emotionally
satisfying than either Chaplin's or Lloyd's; it is a great
comfort to us to know that Keaton can't be suppressed
for long.
James Agee has pointed out that Keaton is the least
sentimental of the silent comedians, but he isn't cold;
there is an emotional current running through his best
movies. In Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928; to be screened Feb.
4-6) his efforts to win the respect and affection of his
father (Ernest Torrence), hilarious as they are, are
touchinglv truthful. (There's a famous scene in which he
tries to heip the crusty old steamboat captain to escape
from jail by bringing him a bread with a file hidden in it.
The old man refuses it, not understanding the intent, and
Keaton says sadly to himself, "My father is ashamed of
my baking.") His friendship with a lion in The Three
Ages, his first full-length feature (1923; Jan. 22-24), and
with a cow in the lovely, underrated Go West (1925; Feb.
2-3) are models of comic restraint. And the romance in
his movies is so lightweight and soars so high above the
maudlin realm to which Chaplin sinks on occasion that
the love affairs seem dizzy — delirious. His ideal mate is
Kathrvn McGuirein The Navigaior(\924\ Feb. 7-8),
whose poker face matches his; they are like a pair of

marionettes fashioned in the image of lovers from a
Shakespearean comedy and brought to life by a magic
wand — slightly dazed and set unerringly upon a straight
path. Their response to the cockeyed world to which they
have been born is to plod through it, unhesitating, wide
eyed, and hand in hand.
Much has been written about the mathematical
complexity and precision of the gags in Keaton's movies.
Even the simplest one to describe — the scene in which he
and McGuire hunt foreach other, always just missing
each other, on two decks of a ship in The Navigator— is
so cleverly constructed that he is able to keep it going for
much longer than we would have suspected. Like all great
comics, Keaton knew how to build a joke so that it grew
funnier and funnier as he unravelled all its threads; that
was the heritage of his vaudeville childhood. His intricacy
and inventiveness, however, were all his own. In The
Electric House (\922: i an. 31-Feb. 1) he wiresa cottage
for electricity but is thwarted by a villain — the engineer
who was supposed to be hired for the job — who rewires
it; the result is a series of mishaps that touch each other
off like the runners in an apache relay race. In The
Scarecrow (1920; Feb. 14-15), Keaton shares a one-room
shack with a friend; they transform their living quarters
from a bedroom to a livingroom by flying furniture in
and out on strings. The objects of their daily existence
dash on and off this tiny stage like frenzied dancers in a
fairly tale ballet who are under the thumb of a willful
wizard.
The period of Buster Keaton's success was far too
brief: his great earlv shorts were in 1920 and 1921; the last
film on which he exercised full artistic contropjtfw
Steamboat Bill Jr. in 1928. Then he allo\ypdliirnself—
against his better judgment and agajjrifthe advjce-eftrolh 1

Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd — to be sucked into
the MGM whirlpool, and the two films he made under
the studio system, The Cameraman (1928; Feb. 16) and
Spite Marriage (1929; Feb. 16), met the kind of obstacles
that might have defeated even a Keaton hero. He
couldn't assemble his old crew and his story ideas were
often rejected by higher-ups (like Irving Thalberg
himself) who clearly didn't understand his comedy. Asa
result, these pictures are far less inspired than the earlier
features, though they contain some marvelous sequences
— like the scene in Spite Marriage in which Keaton, wed
by an actress (Dorothy Sebastian) for convenience alone,
must carry her, after she has drunk too much and passed
out, into her room and put her to bed without waking her.
The films that the Cento Cedar will be presenting in the
next few weeks represent a golden epoch, for Keaton and
for film comedy — the most sophisticated hour of the
silent clowns, before sound came in, and the happiest
time of Keaton's life, before he became inactive and
unappreciated and alcoholic. Few moviegoers after 1930
knew much about his movies until James Agee wrote his
famous article "Comedy's Greatest Era" in 1947, and few
directors ever used Keaton after his decline in 1929,
though he hasa few glowing moments with Chaplin in the
1952 Limelight and you can spot him running around the
seven hills of Rome in A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum, the last movie he made before he died
in 1966. When you see the amazing, surreal Sherlock Jr.
(1924; Jan. 22-24)0r Our Hospitality Feb. 9-10),
his treatment of the McCoy-Hatfield feud, which begins
as a straight drama, or the astonishingly beautiful,
keTTrmgl^n-inspired The General(l927; Jan. 28-30), you
may so brilliant a talent could ever have
J!TTn*4jjt^noticedfoivsp long.
That's Brown Eyes on
the right, costarring
with Buster Keaton in
the 1925 comedy Go
West.
