### Katherine Brown 
President Ronald Reagan said in a
nationally televised press conference
yesterday that sanctions against the
Soviet Union and Poland on trade,
aviation and fishing rights are in
tended toshowthat"we're not going
to wait forever for improvement."
Reagan said communication must
be restored between the Polish mili
tary government and Solidarity, the
independent Polish trade union. The
president said he has received a letter
from Pope John Paul 11, a Pole, in
dicating his approval of the sanc
tions.
Reagan said the purpose of in
creased defense spending was to in
sure a better bargaining position at
the arms reductions table. "It is bet
ter when the alternative faced by the
adversary is a build-up on our side
commensurate with their arms
capabilities," he said. He maintained
that "weapons produced are not
necessarily weapons used," and that
the primary goal is "to rebuild that
which has been allowed to deterio
rate."
Reagan also took full responsibility
for the widely criticized decision to
grant a tax-exempt status to private
schools which racially discriminate.
"No one put anything over on me"
he said. "The widespread and en
couraged confusion in the media was
over a perceived policy change on
the issue of discrimination," Reagan
said.
He explained that the Internal Rev
enue Service had formed a social rule
that had no basis in law. When asked
if this procedural change could be
taken by blacks as an example of ig
noring their interests, Reagan re
sponded, "It isn't true, I'm for af
firmative action . .. I've always been
in opposition to prejudice and
bigotry." A week after the original
announcement by the IRS extending
exemptions, Reagan asked Congress
to outlaw tax exemptions for schools
that discriminate.
On the Middle East, the president
said the issue of autonomy for the
Palestinians "is the toughest ques
tion" for U.S. policy. Israel is sup
posed to withdraw from the Sinai by
April 25. Talks between Israel and

Egypt on the Palestinian autonomy
are stalled. Reagan said that the Unit
ed States won't set a deadline, but
"we are hopeful that by the Sinai
(withdrawal) time they will get down
to a plan for proceeding."
The need to protect national secur
ity and the ability to conduct foreign
policy were cited by the president as
reasons for National Security Advisor
William Clark's stricter rules on me
dia access to classified government
information. "We're simply abiding
with existing law ... these measures
will not interfere with information
that properly belongs to the press"
he said. Reagan declined to give an
example of a leak that had actually
endangered national security,
saying, "I would be leaking if I did."
The president was asked to explain
why his personal tax returns do not
show many donations to charitable
organizations. "I also believe in
tithing — giving of a tenth (of one's
income) to charity. For years I have
given to individuals . . . these dona
tions are not tax-deductible" he said.
Reagan indicated he would be giving
to organizations in a "public way"
next year.
Reagan disputed the comment
that his incentives for capital invest
ment by businesses have failed. "I
think there's caution at work," he
said; "the increased money supply
has sent out the wrong signals and
American businesses are waiting for
additional signals from the Federal
Reserve." He said the steel industry
was one of many ready and waiting to
implement plans for modernization
and expansion.
The president's anti-abortion posi
tion was not compromised when
asked if he would allow one of his
daughters to carry a pregnancy re
sulting from rape to full term. He
wouldn't answer in personal terms
but underscored that rape and incest
exemptions to anti-abortion law "be
come gigantic loopholes equal to
abortion on demand." He said that
the exact point at which life begins is
not yet resolved, and offered this
analogy: "If you stumbled upon a
motionless body in the road would
you take it for dead and cover it up?
Shouldn't we morally opt for the
hope that it is alive?"

additional signals from the Federal
Reserve." He said the steel industry
was one of many ready and waiting to
implement plans for modernization
and expansion.
The president's anti-abortion posi
tion was not compromised when
asked if he would allow one of his
daughters to carry a pregnancy re
sulting from rape to full term. He
wouldn't answer in personal terms
but underscored that rape and incest
exemptions to anti-abortion law "be
come gigantic loopholes equal to
abortion on demand." He said that
the exact point at which life begins is
not yet resolved, and offered this
analogy: "If you stumbled upon a
motionless body in the road would
you take it for dead and cover it up?
Shouldn't we morally opt for the
hope that it is alive?"
President Ronald Reagan said in a
nationally televised press conference
yesterday that sanctions against the
Soviet Union and Poland on trade,
aviation and fishing rights are in
tended toshowthat"we're not going
to wait forever for improvement."
Reagan said communication must
be restored between the Polish mili
tary government and Solidarity, the
independent Polish trade union. The
president said he has received a letter
from Pope John Paul 11, a Pole, in
dicating his approval of the sanc
tions.
Reagan said the purpose of in
creased defense spending was to in
sure a better bargaining position at
the arms reductions table. "It is bet
ter when the alternative faced by the
adversary is a build-up on our side
commensurate with their arms
capabilities," he said. He maintained
that "weapons produced are not
necessarily weapons used," and that
the primary goal is "to rebuild that
which has been allowed to deterio
rate."
Reagan also took full responsibility
for the widely criticized decision to
grant a tax-exempt status to private
schools which racially discriminate.
"No one put anything over on me"
he said. "The widespread and en
couraged confusion in the media was
over a perceived policy change on
the issue of discrimination," Reagan
said.
He explained that the Internal Rev
enue Service had formed a social rule
that had no basis in law. When asked
if this procedural change could be
taken by blacks as an example of ig
noring their interests, Reagan re
sponded, "It isn't true, I'm for af
firmative action . .. I've always been
in opposition to prejudice and
bigotry." A week after the original
announcement by the IRS extending
exemptions, Reagan asked Congress
to outlaw tax exemptions for schools
that discriminate.
On the Middle East, the president
said the issue of autonomy for the
Palestinians "is the toughest ques
tion" for U.S. policy. Israel is sup
posed to withdraw from the Sinai by
April 25. Talks between Israel and

Egypt on the Palestinian autonomy
are stalled. Reagan said that the Unit
ed States won't set a deadline, but
"we are hopeful that by the Sinai
(withdrawal) time they will get down
to a plan for proceeding."
The need to protect national secur
ity and the ability to conduct foreign
policy were cited by the president as
reasons for National Security Advisor
William Clark's stricter rules on me
dia access to classified government
information. "We're simply abiding
with existing law ... these measures
will not interfere with information
that properly belongs to the press"
he said. Reagan declined to give an
example of a leak that had actually
endangered national security,
saying, "I would be leaking if I did."
The president was asked to explain
why his personal tax returns do not
show many donations to charitable
organizations. "I also believe in
tithing — giving of a tenth (of one's
income) to charity. For years I have
given to individuals . . . these dona
tions are not tax-deductible" he said.
Reagan indicated he would be giving
to organizations in a "public way"
next year.
Reagan disputed the comment
that his incentives for capital invest
ment by businesses have failed. "I
think there's caution at work," he
said; "the increased money supply
has sent out the wrong signals and
American businesses are waiting for
additional signals from the Federal
Reserve." He said the steel industry
was one of many ready and waiting to
implement plans for modernization
and expansion.
