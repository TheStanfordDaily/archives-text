Haig sets meeting with Gromyko
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
will take U.S. objections to Soviet pressures on Poland
in person to the Kremlin's leadership in a meeting ear
ly next week with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, official sources said yesterday.
The planned discussions in Geneva between Haig
and Gromyko, to be announced formally by the two
governments today, are also expected to cover a pos
sible Soviet-American summit meeting and the begin
ning of a new round of talks on the limitation of
strategic arms.
However, an early summit meeting between Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev does not seem likely under present circum
stances, according to U.S. sources, and it is no longer a
matter of course that next week's Haig-Gromyko talks
will set a date for the beginning of the long-awaited
strategic arms control talks.
Word of Haig's intention to take up the Polish is
sues with Gromyko next week came from Canadian
Foreign Minister Mark MacGuigan, who conferred
with the U.S. secretary of state here Tuesday.
MacGuigan said Haig regards Poland as being on the
agenda of his sessions with Gromyko, as well as "ques
tions of arms control" that were originally planned as
the centerpiece of the sessions.
UAW breaks off contract talks
Detroit — United Auto Workers negotiators broke
off emergency contract talks with General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. yesterday, amid predic
tions the breakdown might furthur depress new-car
sales.
UAW President Douglas Fraser announced the col
lapse of the GM talks shortly after noon, saying the
two sides were deadlocked on economic and job secur
ity issues. He refused to elaborate.
Following the lead of the union's GM committee,
the Ford negotiators decided to recess their talks pend
ing a meeting of the entire council Saturday in Wash
ington, said Don Ephlin, UAW vice president and
head of the union's Ford Department.
Ephlin said he did not believe the breakdown meant
an end to the negotiations.
Divers recover flight recorders
Washington — Federal safety investigators re
covered electronic recordings yesterday of the last
minutes of ill-fated Air Florida Flight 90, and a Cali
fornia congressman said the tapes indicated the jet
liner's crew was unaware of any potential problems.
Rep. Norman Mineta (D-Calif.), who was briefed
on the tapes bv federal authorities, said that comments
bv the pilot and first officer showed "nothing that
points to any significant probable cause."
Mineta, who is chairman of the aviation subcom
mittee of the House Public Works and Transportation
Committee, said the cockpit recording of the Boeing
737 will be analyzed for "background noises" of the
engines to determine if engine failure was a factor in
last week's crash, which killed 78 persons here.
But Mineta said authorities told him there were no
dramatic exclamations or comments by the crew while
the aircraft was taxiing on the runway at National Air
port or during its approximately 15-second flight

before it crashed into the Potomac River.
Francis McAdams, the National Transporation
Safety Board member who is coordinating the inquiry,
declined to discuss the tapes with reporters. "The
board does not want to give out misleading informa
tion or information that later would turn out to have
nothing to do with the cause of the accident," he said.
Registration deadline extended
Washington — Young men who were required to
register for the draft bv Jan. 8, but failed to do so, will
be given until Feb. 28 to comply with the law, Selective
Service director Thomas Turnage said yesterday.
The announcement followed a statement by Presi
dent Ronald Reagan Jan. 7 in which he called for the
continuation of draft registration with a grace period
for the estimated 800,000 young men born since Jan. 1,
1960, who have not met the registration deadline.
Turnage said that after Feb. 28, however, his agency
would pursue "an active compliance program" in co
operation v/ith the Justice Department to identify and
prosecute those who have not registered. Failure to
register is a felony, punishable by up to five years in
prison, a $ 10,000 fine, or both.
But Turnage said he does not expect such enforce
ment to be necessary. "We have every reason to believe
that once the thing is clearly defined, we will get com
pliance from the vast majority of people," he said.
"First, we're pragmatists. Second, we're optimists.
And third, all the evidence we have indicates this is
supported by the country."
Jury asks death for Freeway Killer
Los Angeles — The jury in the Freeway Killer case
recommended the death penalty yesterday for William
Bonin, convicted of 10 homosexual murders of youths
whose nude bodies were found dumped near freeways.
Bonin, 35, is a twice-paroled sex offender whose
lawyer, William Charvet, sought a life sentence on
grounds the truck driver had suffered a personality
change because of his military service with the Army in
Vietnam in the late 19605. Deputy District Attorney
Sterling Norris had asked for the death penalty.
Interest rate concerns drop market
New York — The stock market posted its second
straight loss yesterday, still beset by concern over ris
ing interest rates and the recession.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, coming
off a 7.71-point loss Tuesday, dropped 1.52 to 845.89.
Since New Year's the average has fallen almost 30
points.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached 48.86
million shares, against 45.07 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Showers tapering off through the day. Snow on the
hills above about 1,500 feet lowering to 1,000 feet by

Committee, said the cockpit recording of the Boeing
737 will be analyzed for "background noises" of the
engines to determine if engine failure was a factor in
last week's crash, which killed 78 persons here.
But Mineta said authorities told him there were no
dramatic exclamations or comments by the crew while
the aircraft was taxiing on the runway at National Air
port or during its approximately 15-second flight

before it crashed into the Potomac River.
Francis McAdams, the National Transporation
Safety Board member who is coordinating the inquiry,
declined to discuss the tapes with reporters. "The
board does not want to give out misleading informa
tion or information that later would turn out to have
nothing to do with the cause of the accident," he said.
Registration deadline extended
Washington — Young men who were required to
register for the draft bv Jan. 8, but failed to do so, will
be given until Feb. 28 to comply with the law, Selective
Service director Thomas Turnage said yesterday.
The announcement followed a statement by Presi
dent Ronald Reagan Jan. 7 in which he called for the
continuation of draft registration with a grace period
for the estimated 800,000 young men born since Jan. 1,
1960, who have not met the registration deadline.
Turnage said that after Feb. 28, however, his agency
would pursue "an active compliance program" in co
operation v/ith the Justice Department to identify and
prosecute those who have not registered. Failure to
register is a felony, punishable by up to five years in
prison, a $ 10,000 fine, or both.
But Turnage said he does not expect such enforce
ment to be necessary. "We have every reason to believe
that once the thing is clearly defined, we will get com
pliance from the vast majority of people," he said.
"First, we're pragmatists. Second, we're optimists.
And third, all the evidence we have indicates this is
supported by the country."

Haig sets meeting with Gromyko
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
will take U.S. objections to Soviet pressures on Poland
in person to the Kremlin's leadership in a meeting ear
ly next week with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, official sources said yesterday.
The planned discussions in Geneva between Haig
and Gromyko, to be announced formally by the two
governments today, are also expected to cover a pos
sible Soviet-American summit meeting and the begin
ning of a new round of talks on the limitation of
strategic arms.
However, an early summit meeting between Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev does not seem likely under present circum
stances, according to U.S. sources, and it is no longer a
matter of course that next week's Haig-Gromyko talks
will set a date for the beginning of the long-awaited
strategic arms control talks.
Word of Haig's intention to take up the Polish is
sues with Gromyko next week came from Canadian
Foreign Minister Mark MacGuigan, who conferred
with the U.S. secretary of state here Tuesday.
MacGuigan said Haig regards Poland as being on the
agenda of his sessions with Gromyko, as well as "ques
tions of arms control" that were originally planned as
the centerpiece of the sessions.

ing a meeting of the entire council Saturday in Wash
ington, said Don Ephlin, UAW vice president and

Divers recover flight recorders
Washington — Federal safety investigators re

Rep. Norman Mineta (D-Calif.), who was briefed
on the tapes bv federal authorities, said that comments
bv the pilot and first officer showed "nothing that
