# Soviet scholar's research access affirmed

In the wake of determined opposition here, the Na
tional Academy of Sciences announced Monday it
will halt — at least temporarily — sending letters to
the University outlining State Department restrictions
that would bar a visiting Soviet scientist from accessto
certain research facilities.
The source of the conflict is the scheduled visit of
Dr. Nikolai Umnov, a Soviet expert on robot develop
ment, to Stanford and three other universities.
Frank Press, academy president, ordered the "no
letters" policy after Stanford officials told him that
they would not comply with State Department rules
relayed by theacademy. Press also said that a final pol
icy decision will be made on the issue when the
academy's governing councils meet atthe end of Feb
ruary.
The academy, a private institution, is sponsoring
Umnov's tour of the four universities this spring as
part of an established exchange with the Soviet
Academy of Science. In addition to Stanford, Umnov
is scheduled to visit the University of Wisconsin, Ohio
State University and Auburn University.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth, who is
supposed to host Umnov, praised the academy's de
cision as"a good step. I hope it will influence the gov
ernment not to impose these senseless restrictions."
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost and dean of gradu
ate studies and research, also reacted favorably to the
academy's move. "It will certainly encourage scien
tific interchange. I would hope that we would have
something to gain from Dr. Umnov, and also vice ver-

sa."
The State Department, however, may not allow
Umnov to visit the University if the restrictions are not
followed. According to an article in yesterday's Los
Angeles Times, a State Department official said Tues
day that the department was concerned about "pos
sible technology transfer risks," meaning the flow of
technological information to the Soviet Union which
could endanger the United State's national security.
But Roth countered, "I think that there is zero dan
ger in technology leakage." Roth contended that in
dividual "secrets" cannot be used to improve a coun
try's "general level of technological expertise."
The State Department restrictions were set forth in
a letter last month from the academy to Roth. They
prohibit the Soviet scholar from obtaining access to
University research funded by the Department of De
fense, from observing the programming and control
techniques employed in robot operation, from visit
ing local industries, and from discussing research in
formation that has not already been published in
open literature.
The State Department imposed these restrictions as
part of the Export Control Act, which the department
interprets as applying to all scientific knowledge and
research, not just strategic commodities and equip
ment.
Stanford's negative reaction to the restrictions was
relayed to the academy last week by Lieberman. In his
letter Lieberman said that the University was pre
pared to host Umnov, but not to take responsibility

for his actions during the visit.
In an interview with the Daily, Lieberman com
mented that "It would be to the detriment of what we
do best, namely teaching and research," to have to do
police work. He said that the University's position is
that it is up to the State Department to handle that
kind of work.
Lieberman pointed out the the campus environ
ment is "completely open," and that federal export
regulations should notapplytoanyofthe University's
activities "on the grounds that our research programs
represent basic and unclassified investigations."
Arthur Schawlow, J.G. Jackson-C.J. Wood Professor
of Physics and a 1981 Nobel Prize winner, said last
week that restrictions placed on viewing unclassified
research represent a contradiction in terms.
Roth noted that robotics has presently little or no
military use, and limited potential for military use.
Walking robots, Umnov's speciality, exist only in the
most primitive forms, and are more of a scientific
fascination than a useful tool in the immediate future.
Furthermore, Roth told the University News Ser
vice that "the Soviet Union did a lot of pioneering
work in this field. Guys in the U.S. who know some
thing about it learned from the Russians — and freely
admit it."
Stanford is not the only major university to recently
oppose federal restrictions on visiting foreign schol
ars. A year ago University President Donald Kennedy
was joined by four other presidents in expressing
"grave concern" over federal attempts to apply ex
port controls to academic teaching and research.
