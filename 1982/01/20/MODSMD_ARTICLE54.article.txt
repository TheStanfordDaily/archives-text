feels very at home and very at ease in that sort of
context."

Junior Doug Kave commented that Lantos was
"a very articulate speaker. He seemed to know what
he was talking about. Even though I didn't agree
with him on every issue, it seemed he had done a lot
of research in making his conclusions. I think he'll
serve the constituency here very well."
