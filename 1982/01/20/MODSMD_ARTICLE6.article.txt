## Next space shuttle to carry plants 
### Jennifer Seymour 
NASA's Space Shuttle No. 3 will carry on
it the first biology experiment ever de
signed specifically for outer space.
The test will study the formation of
lignin in plants. Lignin is the woody sub
stance giving plants their structural stabil
ity against the force of the Earth's gravity.
The study is managed by NASA Ames re
searcher John Tremor, who works at
nearby Moffett Field and engineer Ronald
Mancini, in conjunction with principle in
vestigator Joe Cowles at the University of
Houston.
Scientists seek an understanding of the
steps plant enzymes go through in making
lignin. By watching how seedlings grow in
the gravity-less environment of space, they
expect to learn more about how wood is
formed.
"The experiment is pure science on this
level," said Trerpor. "This synthesis is a
very complex one which we want to learn
about. But the experiment is also applied
research, as we will be watching what hap
pens to plants grown in O-g (zero gravity),
where light is the only orienting stimulus."
Tremor and other scientists believe that
the plants will grow upwards in response
to the attraction of the artificial sunlight,
despite a lack of gravity. But because roots
are less responsive to light, scientists are
unsure how the roots will grow.
"It may bethatthe rootsgrow virtually in
any direction while the sprouts turn
towards the light regardless of the

germinating seed's original position," said
Tremor. "We've never been able to main
tain a O-g environment long enough to
run such a test, so it's hard to really say
what we expect. However, the Russians
have reported that shoots and roots in
weightlessness and dark conditions will
grow along the line determined by the
seeds' original placement on the medi
um."
Scientists hypothesize that in space,
plants will respond tothe lack of gravity by
manufacturing less lignin. Although lignin
is vital to producing the wood of trees, for
instance, it is considered a nuisance in
some applications; it must be removed
before conversion of certain wood prod
ucts into paper and plastics, and it com
petes with food production in many
plants.
This sort of information may someday be
useful to space colonizers who will want to
know of plant growth patterns under O-g
conditions and to maximize the food they
can grow.
"Who knows? Someday we may be eat
ing pine trees. That is very hypothetical,
even improbable, and a long way off in any
case," said Tremor.
The experiment itself will occur in a
breadbox-sized Plant Growth Unit (PGU)
containing six 10-inch-high Plant Growth
Chambers which resemble thin, rec
tangular terrariums.
The six receptacles, built from
aluminum and a special heat-resistant

poly-carbonate material, will house two
rows of eight seeds each, in sandwiches of
sponge and filter paper. There will be oat
and bean seeds, and pine seedlings which
have already been germinated (Pine
sprouts take more time to germinate than
the Shuttle orbit can provide).
During the Shuttle's eight-day sojourn
in Earth orbit, the six chambers will recieve
14 hours of "sunlight" (artificial sunlamps)
a day. Scientists foresee a six-inch growth
under these conditions.
The seedlings must feel as little gravity as
possible in order to truly test the effects of
zero gravity. Thus, the seeds will be
planted as short a time before launch as
possible, six to eight hours.
"And," said Tremor, "the sprouts will be
pulled from the Shuttle for examination
first thing after landing — possibly even
before the astronauts are out."
The orbiting greenhouse will be closely
monitored; researchers will be able to tell
whether growth directions varied under
light or nighttime conditions and
thermostat control will guard against pos
sible fluctuations in the spacecraft tem
perature.
Information will focus on changes in
growth patterns, and on the relationship
between growth and lignin production.
The scientists feel that the pines will proba
bly offer the most useful data about such
links because they contain significantly
more lignin than the other two shoots.

before conversion of certain wood prod
ucts into paper and plastics, and it com
petes with food production in many
plants.
This sort of information may someday be
useful to space colonizers who will want to
know of plant growth patterns under O-g
conditions and to maximize the food they
can grow.
"Who knows? Someday we may be eat
ing pine trees. That is very hypothetical,
even improbable, and a long way off in any
case," said Tremor.
The experiment itself will occur in a
breadbox-sized Plant Growth Unit (PGU)
containing six 10-inch-high Plant Growth
Chambers which resemble thin, rec
tangular terrariums.
The six receptacles, built from
aluminum and a special heat-resistant

poly-carbonate material, will house two
rows of eight seeds each, in sandwiches of
sponge and filter paper. There will be oat
and bean seeds, and pine seedlings which
have already been germinated (Pine
sprouts take more time to germinate than
the Shuttle orbit can provide).
During the Shuttle's eight-day sojourn
in Earth orbit, the six chambers will recieve
14 hours of "sunlight" (artificial sunlamps)
a day. Scientists foresee a six-inch growth
under these conditions.
The seedlings must feel as little gravity as
possible in order to truly test the effects of
zero gravity. Thus, the seeds will be
planted as short a time before launch as
possible, six to eight hours.
"And," said Tremor, "the sprouts will be
pulled from the Shuttle for examination
first thing after landing — possibly even
before the astronauts are out."
The orbiting greenhouse will be closely
monitored; researchers will be able to tell
whether growth directions varied under
light or nighttime conditions and
thermostat control will guard against pos
sible fluctuations in the spacecraft tem
perature.
Information will focus on changes in
growth patterns, and on the relationship
between growth and lignin production.
The scientists feel that the pines will proba
bly offer the most useful data about such
links because they contain significantly
more lignin than the other two shoots.

PLANTS IN SPACE? — The next time the Space Shuttle
goes into orbit, it will take a host of scientific experi

NASA's Space Shuttle No. 3 will carry on
it the first biology experiment ever de
signed specifically for outer space.
The test will study the formation of
lignin in plants. Lignin is the woody sub
stance giving plants their structural stabil
ity against the force of the Earth's gravity.
The study is managed by NASA Ames re
searcher John Tremor, who works at
nearby Moffett Field and engineer Ronald
Mancini, in conjunction with principle in
vestigator Joe Cowles at the University of
Houston.
Scientists seek an understanding of the
steps plant enzymes go through in making
lignin. By watching how seedlings grow in
the gravity-less environment of space, they
expect to learn more about how wood is
formed.
"The experiment is pure science on this
level," said Trerpor. "This synthesis is a
very complex one which we want to learn
about. But the experiment is also applied
research, as we will be watching what hap
pens to plants grown in O-g (zero gravity),
where light is the only orienting stimulus."
Tremor and other scientists believe that
the plants will grow upwards in response
to the attraction of the artificial sunlight,
despite a lack of gravity. But because roots
are less responsive to light, scientists are
unsure how the roots will grow.
"It may bethatthe rootsgrow virtually in
any direction while the sprouts turn
towards the light regardless of the

germinating seed's original position," said
Tremor. "We've never been able to main
tain a O-g environment long enough to
run such a test, so it's hard to really say
what we expect. However, the Russians
have reported that shoots and roots in
weightlessness and dark conditions will
grow along the line determined by the
seeds' original placement on the medi
um."
Scientists hypothesize that in space,
plants will respond tothe lack of gravity by
manufacturing less lignin. Although lignin
is vital to producing the wood of trees, for
instance, it is considered a nuisance in
some applications; it must be removed
before conversion of certain wood prod
ucts into paper and plastics, and it com
petes with food production in many
plants.
This sort of information may someday be
useful to space colonizers who will want to
