# Anorexia and Bulimia: The deadly diets
## 
### Steven Fisher-Jones 
Many people, especially
women of college age, are
secretly suffering from the
eating disorders anorexia
nervosa and bulimia in
which people starve them
selves because of their
phobia of becoming obese.
People with anorexia
nervosa usually refuse to eat
substantial amounts of food,
because they continually
think that they are over
weight, even when they
have lost as much as 25 per
cent or more of their natural
body weight. Anorexia usu
ally results, despite continu
ing hyperactivity, in a loss of
the menstrual period in
women, dizziness and
weakness, and occasionally
even death.
According to John
Bachman, director of the
Stanford University Behav
ioral Medicine Clinic,
bulimia patients, who also
have a fear of becoming
obese, tend to have a body
weight that fluctuates
drastically around normal
levels. They have a high
calorie diet, however, eat
ing massive amounts of food
of which they rid them
selves by inducing vomiting,
taking laxitives, or taking
urinating-inducing drugs
before digestion is com
pleted.
"The scientific evidence
indicates that these dis
orders arise from social
problems, especially con
flicts in one's family and dif
ficulties in adjusting to soci
etal pressures," Bachman
said, in reference to patients
he had seen. "The evidence
suggests that biochemical
inbalances are only secon
dary."
Both anorexia nervosa
and bulimia occur mostly in
young women, typically 14
to 18 years of age for anorex
ia victims and 18 to 25 years
of age for those with
bulimia, Bachman said. This
seems to be due to the social
pressure placed upon wom
en concerning their ap
pearance. Bachman said of
the patients he has seen,
"They tend to come from

families where accomplish
ment, achievement and ap
pearance are very important
and stressed very much.
They are usually from very
affluent families in which
food has never been in short
supply. They tend to have
very authoritarian parents,
who are sometimes very
punitive . ..
"It usually takes a long
while for parents of anorex
ia or bulimia victims to re
alize what is happening,"
Bachman said, because such
victims "get very good
grades, are very per
fectionistic, tend to be in
volved in sports, and are ex
tremely concerned with
keeping their condition a
secret."
In general, sufferers of
bulimia and anorexia
nervosa appear outwardly
as normal individuals
monitoring their health
through exercise and diet
ing.
It is important, however,
that people who are ex
cessively concerned with
reducing their body weight
by continually dieting or
otherwise purging them
selves of food seek pro
fessional help before they
seriously endanger their
health. Bachman said that
these eating disorders do
not disappear by themselves
and will continue through

out one's life if left un
treated, causing physical
and emotional difficulties.
For anorexia nervosa, the
therapy usually begins with
hospitalization for malnutri
tion and continues with psy
chological, behavioral and
physical counseling involv
ing both the individual and
the family. Exstensive treat
ment is also given in time
management, because "it
appears that many people
find it very stressful when
they are not sure what to
do," Bachman said.
"Bulimia patientsare usu
ally treated with group psy
chotherapy designed to
modify their eating behav
ior and to enable them to
more easily express love and
anger feelings." Bachman
said. They also undergo
therapy designed to
eliminate their desire forse
cretiveness.
A recent study done in
England concluded that one
in every 200 people suffer
from anorexia nervosa,
Bachman said, while no
such figures are available for
those with bulimia. Never
theless, few people with
these conditions seek help,
needlessly threatening their
physical and mental health.
For this reason, Bachman
urges those desiring help to
call the University Behav
ioral Medicine Clinic.
