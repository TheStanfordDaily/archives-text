## Is saying 'hello' difficult? You may suffer from shyness... 
### Dan Turner 
All of us have suffered from some form of
shyness at one point or another, but for
some people shyness becomes an inhibiting
factor that places severe limits on the way
they live their lives. Shy children grow up to
be encased within a prison of self-conscious
ness, so that they are prevented from per
forming necessary actions even though they
have the ability and motivation to manage
them.
Philip Zimbardo, a psychology professor
here, has worked extensively in research and
treatment of this common but elusive prob
lem. Zimbardo's latest book, The Shy Child,
is the result of five years of experience here
at his Stanford Shyness Clinic.
"Shyness results from a fear of being re
jected," says Zimbardo. "At the core of shy
ness is a sensitivity to being evaluated by oth
ers. Other people are constantly evaluating
the way you look and perform, and the shy
person becomes overly concerned with
this."
Zimbardo's clinic, which he and a group of
students formed in 1972, attempts to treat
shy people both from inside and outside the
University. This means that Stanford students
and staff as well as outside citizens can enroll
in a group therapy session for a minimal fee.
Zimbardo maintains that treatment of shy
ness involves the attempt to influence a
change in the following four categories:
1.) Social skills — Many shy people need
training in basic skills such as knowing what
to do in a given social situation, when to do
it, how, etc.
2.) Concept of self — Shy people tend to
have a very low self-esteem, being very
critical of themselves while at the same time
maintaining overly high standards for their
own performance. This can be treated by
boosting a shy person's self-confidence and
by helping him to build more realistic ideals

both for himself and others.
3.) Social anxiety — Even when a shy per
son may have the necessary skills to manage
a position, he may be so anxious that his
ideas cannot be put into practice. In this case
Zimbardo and his staff try to teach anxiety
management, a system of showing the per
son how not to be so upset over everyday sit
uations.
4.) Cognitive restructuring — Perhaps the
most important barrier a shy person must ov
ercome is to change in the way he thinks
about various aspects of life, including what
he thinks about shyness itself. He must begin
to think of shyness as a way of reacting to sit
uations rather than as a personal defect.
Another important part of cognitive
restructuring is the process of convincing
the shy person to take risks, to expose them
selves in socially risky situations such as
saying hello, asking for a date, criticizing the
service, etc.
Finally and most importantly, the shy per
son must be encouraged to be as concerned
with the hurts and pains of other people as
with his own. If shyness can be defined as a
preoccupation with the self, then a preoc
cupation with others is certainly a major step
in the right direction.
Shyness can take many forms, says Zim
bardo, and thus every case involves a dif
ferent form of treatment. For example, there
are people who are very outgoing in group
situations but who become extremely shy on
a one-on-one basis. Others are perfectly
able to handle close relationships but find
themselves incapable of dealing with
strangers.
Zimbardo says that many shy professors
have great difficulty teaching seminars and
prefer to give lectures, since lectures are
more structured and lack the uncertainty
and spontaneity of open discussion. Thus
even people whose jobs force them to corn

municate every day with fellow human
beings can in fact be very shy on an individ
ual basis.
Recently Zimbardo was involved in a
series of interviews with the man who was
convicted of being the "College Terrace
Rapist," who committed a series of assaults
here between 1971 and 1979. According to
Zimbardo, this man is an example of one of
the extreme forms that shyness can take.

"Here was a man whose shyness pre
vented him from having normal relations
with women, and thus rape became a means
of gaining control over them, of getting re
spect through fear," explains Zimbardo.
Cases such as this, of course, are rare, but
the percentage of American adults who de
scribe themselves as being shy is surprisingly
high. Surveys show that as many as 40 per
cent fall into this category.
In Zimbardo's surveys at Stanford during
the last 10 years, the number of studentswho
described themselves as being shy has never
been less than 38 percent or more than 43
percent.

"One of the saddest statistics," says Zim
bardo, "is that in one survey here 25 percent
of those questioned reported being more
shy since coming to Stanford. In other
words, something about their Stanford ex
perience caused them to become more
shy."
Whether this fact can be attributed simply
to the change of environment and lifestyle
that most incoming freshmen go through, or
whether it is caused by some situation within
the University itself, is unknown. But it iscer
tainly evident that something about college
life contributes to the formation of mental
barriers against other people, concludes
Zimbardo.
Shyness, according to Zimbardo, needs to
be treated only when the person suffering
from it considers it to be an undesirable trait
that prevents him from doing or achieving
some important thing. About two-thirds of
those who consider themselves shy describe
their affliction as a serious one for which
they could use help. Unfortunately, there is
almost no place for them to go.
Probably more is known about shyness as a
result of the research done here at Stanford
by Zimbardo and his staff than from any
where else in the United States. While Zim
bardo continues to offer treatment at his
clinic, he also frequently refers people to a
therapist in Palo Alto who leads groupthera
py sessions.
The ironic thing about treating shy people
is that in many cases the afflicted person is
too shy to ask for help. Another problem in
volves the fact that it is difficult to get a shy
person to communicate in a group therapy
situation.
Zimbardo believes that shyness Is
ing in modern American society. People
have become very competitive, so that chil
dren grow up being pitted against others
rather than cooperating. The emphasis we

place on future success tends to deflect at
tention from the joys of social interaction for
its own sake rather than for what it can get
for you.
In addition, there are the problems of the
impersonal "electronic age" — an obsession
with television teaches children to be pas
sive, entertaining themselves with recorded
plots rather than active conversation. Video
games allow children to play with a machine
any time they wish, so there is no need to
find a human opponent.
The best way to treat shyness is to prevent
it from occurring at all, and this must be
done while the subject is a child. The best
way for parents to accomplish this is by fol
lowing Zimbardo's three strategies or tac
tics: sharing, caring and daring.
The parent must break through egocentric
attitudes; conceptions involving me and
mine, you and yours must be discouraged.
Parents should teach the child to share not
only material objects but ideas, compliments
and good feelings.
From the earliest days parents must let
their child know that they love him uncondi
tionally, that he doesn't have to perform in
order to gain their affections. One of the
main problems of shy people is that they
don't believe that anybody loves them.
Finally, the child must be encouraged to
take risks, both social and intellectual as well
as physical. He should be taught to accept
failure as a necessary part of risk, and thus he
will not be obsessed with a fear of failure.
Shyness is perhaps the most common of all
psychological disorders. Almost everyone is
or knows someone who is shy. The trouble is
that few consider it a serious problem.
"Many people see shyness as being a mild
bashfulness in childhood that you eventually
outgrow," says Zimbardo. "This is a myth.
Shyness is seldom mild, nor is it childish, and
some people never outgrow it."

lowing Zimbardo's three strategies or tac
tics: sharing, caring and daring.
The parent must break through egocentric
attitudes; conceptions involving me and
mine, you and yours must be discouraged.
Parents should teach the child to share not
only material objects but ideas, compliments
and good feelings.
From the earliest days parents must let
their child know that they love him uncondi
tionally, that he doesn't have to perform in
order to gain their affections. One of the
main problems of shy people is that they
don't believe that anybody loves them.
Finally, the child must be encouraged to
take risks, both social and intellectual as well
as physical. He should be taught to accept
failure as a necessary part of risk, and thus he
will not be obsessed with a fear of failure.
Shyness is perhaps the most common of all
psychological disorders. Almost everyone is
or knows someone who is shy. The trouble is
that few consider it a serious problem.
"Many people see shyness as being a mild
bashfulness in childhood that you eventually
outgrow," says Zimbardo. "This is a myth.
Shyness is seldom mild, nor is it childish, and
some people never outgrow it."
All of us have suffered from some form of
shyness at one point or another, but for
some people shyness becomes an inhibiting
factor that places severe limits on the way
they live their lives. Shy children grow up to
be encased within a prison of self-conscious
ness, so that they are prevented from per
forming necessary actions even though they
have the ability and motivation to manage
them.
Philip Zimbardo, a psychology professor
here, has worked extensively in research and
treatment of this common but elusive prob
lem. Zimbardo's latest book, The Shy Child,
is the result of five years of experience here
at his Stanford Shyness Clinic.
"Shyness results from a fear of being re
jected," says Zimbardo. "At the core of shy
ness is a sensitivity to being evaluated by oth
ers. Other people are constantly evaluating
the way you look and perform, and the shy
person becomes overly concerned with
this."
Zimbardo's clinic, which he and a group of
students formed in 1972, attempts to treat
shy people both from inside and outside the
University. This means that Stanford students
and staff as well as outside citizens can enroll
in a group therapy session for a minimal fee.
Zimbardo maintains that treatment of shy
ness involves the attempt to influence a
change in the following four categories:
1.) Social skills — Many shy people need
training in basic skills such as knowing what
to do in a given social situation, when to do
it, how, etc.
2.) Concept of self — Shy people tend to
have a very low self-esteem, being very
critical of themselves while at the same time
maintaining overly high standards for their
own performance. This can be treated by
boosting a shy person's self-confidence and
by helping him to build more realistic ideals

both for himself and others.
3.) Social anxiety — Even when a shy per
son may have the necessary skills to manage
a position, he may be so anxious that his
ideas cannot be put into practice. In this case
Zimbardo and his staff try to teach anxiety
management, a system of showing the per
son how not to be so upset over everyday sit
uations.
4.) Cognitive restructuring — Perhaps the
most important barrier a shy person must ov
ercome is to change in the way he thinks
about various aspects of life, including what
he thinks about shyness itself. He must begin
to think of shyness as a way of reacting to sit
uations rather than as a personal defect.
Another important part of cognitive
restructuring is the process of convincing
the shy person to take risks, to expose them
selves in socially risky situations such as
saying hello, asking for a date, criticizing the
service, etc.
Finally and most importantly, the shy per
son must be encouraged to be as concerned
with the hurts and pains of other people as
with his own. If shyness can be defined as a
preoccupation with the self, then a preoc
cupation with others is certainly a major step
in the right direction.
Shyness can take many forms, says Zim
bardo, and thus every case involves a dif
ferent form of treatment. For example, there
are people who are very outgoing in group
situations but who become extremely shy on
a one-on-one basis. Others are perfectly
able to handle close relationships but find
themselves incapable of dealing with
strangers.
Zimbardo says that many shy professors
have great difficulty teaching seminars and
prefer to give lectures, since lectures are
more structured and lack the uncertainty
and spontaneity of open discussion. Thus
even people whose jobs force them to corn

municate every day with fellow human
beings can in fact be very shy on an individ
ual basis.
Recently Zimbardo was involved in a
series of interviews with the man who was
convicted of being the "College Terrace
Rapist," who committed a series of assaults
here between 1971 and 1979. According to
Zimbardo, this man is an example of one of
the extreme forms that shyness can take.

— Philip Zimbardo,
Psychology professor

"Here was a man whose shyness pre
vented him from having normal relations
with women, and thus rape became a means
of gaining control over them, of getting re
spect through fear," explains Zimbardo.
Cases such as this, of course, are rare, but
the percentage of American adults who de
scribe themselves as being shy is surprisingly
high. Surveys show that as many as 40 per
cent fall into this category.
In Zimbardo's surveys at Stanford during
the last 10 years, the number of studentswho
described themselves as being shy has never
been less than 38 percent or more than 43
percent.

"One of the saddest statistics," says Zim
bardo, "is that in one survey here 25 percent
of those questioned reported being more
shy since coming to Stanford. In other
words, something about their Stanford ex
perience caused them to become more
shy."
Whether this fact can be attributed simply
to the change of environment and lifestyle
that most incoming freshmen go through, or
whether it is caused by some situation within
the University itself, is unknown. But it iscer
tainly evident that something about college
life contributes to the formation of mental
barriers against other people, concludes
Zimbardo.
Shyness, according to Zimbardo, needs to
be treated only when the person suffering
from it considers it to be an undesirable trait
that prevents him from doing or achieving
some important thing. About two-thirds of
those who consider themselves shy describe
their affliction as a serious one for which
they could use help. Unfortunately, there is
almost no place for them to go.
Probably more is known about shyness as a
result of the research done here at Stanford
by Zimbardo and his staff than from any
where else in the United States. While Zim
bardo continues to offer treatment at his
clinic, he also frequently refers people to a
therapist in Palo Alto who leads groupthera
py sessions.
The ironic thing about treating shy people
is that in many cases the afflicted person is
too shy to ask for help. Another problem in
volves the fact that it is difficult to get a shy
person to communicate in a group therapy
situation.
Zimbardo believes that shyness Is
ing in modern American society. People
have become very competitive, so that chil
dren grow up being pitted against others
rather than cooperating. The emphasis we

place on future success tends to deflect at
tention from the joys of social interaction for
its own sake rather than for what it can get
for you.
In addition, there are the problems of the
impersonal "electronic age" — an obsession
with television teaches children to be pas
sive, entertaining themselves with recorded
plots rather than active conversation. Video
games allow children to play with a machine
any time they wish, so there is no need to
find a human opponent.
The best way to treat shyness is to prevent
it from occurring at all, and this must be
done while the subject is a child. The best
way for parents to accomplish this is by fol
lowing Zimbardo's three strategies or tac
tics: sharing, caring and daring.
The parent must break through egocentric
attitudes; conceptions involving me and

The ironic thing about treating shy people
is that in many cases the afflicted person is
too shy to ask for help. Another problem in

Zimbardo believes that shyness Is
ing in modern American society. People
have become very competitive, so that chil
dren grow up being pitted against others
rather than cooperating. The emphasis we

place on future success tends to deflect at
tention from the joys of social interaction for
its own sake rather than for what it can get
for you.
In addition, there are the problems of the
impersonal "electronic age" — an obsession
with television teaches children to be pas

find a human opponent.
The best way to treat shyness is to prevent
it from occurring at all, and this must be
done while the subject is a child. The best
way for parents to accomplish this is by fol
lowing Zimbardo's three strategies or tac
tics: sharing, caring and daring.
The parent must break through egocentric
attitudes; conceptions involving me and
mine, you and yours must be discouraged.
Parents should teach the child to share not
only material objects but ideas, compliments
and good feelings.
From the earliest days parents must let
their child know that they love him uncondi
tionally, that he doesn't have to perform in
order to gain their affections. One of the
main problems of shy people is that they
don't believe that anybody loves them.
Finally, the child must be encouraged to
take risks, both social and intellectual as well
as physical. He should be taught to accept
failure as a necessary part of risk, and thus he
will not be obsessed with a fear of failure.
Shyness is perhaps the most common of all
psychological disorders. Almost everyone is
or knows someone who is shy. The trouble is
that few consider it a serious problem.
"Many people see shyness as being a mild
bashfulness in childhood that you eventually
outgrow," says Zimbardo. "This is a myth.
Shyness is seldom mild, nor is it childish, and
some people never outgrow it."
All of us have suffered from some form of
shyness at one point or another, but for
some people shyness becomes an inhibiting
factor that places severe limits on the way
they live their lives. Shy children grow up to
be encased within a prison of self-conscious
ness, so that they are prevented from per
forming necessary actions even though they
have the ability and motivation to manage
them.
Philip Zimbardo, a psychology professor
here, has worked extensively in research and
treatment of this common but elusive prob
lem. Zimbardo's latest book, The Shy Child,
is the result of five years of experience here
at his Stanford Shyness Clinic.
"Shyness results from a fear of being re
jected," says Zimbardo. "At the core of shy
ness is a sensitivity to being evaluated by oth
ers. Other people are constantly evaluating
the way you look and perform, and the shy
person becomes overly concerned with
this."
Zimbardo's clinic, which he and a group of
students formed in 1972, attempts to treat
shy people both from inside and outside the
University. This means that Stanford students
and staff as well as outside citizens can enroll
in a group therapy session for a minimal fee.
Zimbardo maintains that treatment of shy
ness involves the attempt to influence a
change in the following four categories:
1.) Social skills — Many shy people need
training in basic skills such as knowing what
to do in a given social situation, when to do
it, how, etc.
2.) Concept of self — Shy people tend to
have a very low self-esteem, being very
critical of themselves while at the same time
maintaining overly high standards for their
own performance. This can be treated by
boosting a shy person's self-confidence and
by helping him to build more realistic ideals

both for himself and others.
3.) Social anxiety — Even when a shy per
son may have the necessary skills to manage
a position, he may be so anxious that his
ideas cannot be put into practice. In this case
Zimbardo and his staff try to teach anxiety
management, a system of showing the per
son how not to be so upset over everyday sit
uations.
4.) Cognitive restructuring — Perhaps the
most important barrier a shy person must ov
ercome is to change in the way he thinks
about various aspects of life, including what
he thinks about shyness itself. He must begin
to think of shyness as a way of reacting to sit
uations rather than as a personal defect.
Another important part of cognitive
restructuring is the process of convincing
the shy person to take risks, to expose them
selves in socially risky situations such as
saying hello, asking for a date, criticizing the
service, etc.
Finally and most importantly, the shy per
son must be encouraged to be as concerned
with the hurts and pains of other people as
with his own. If shyness can be defined as a
preoccupation with the self, then a preoc
cupation with others is certainly a major step
in the right direction.
Shyness can take many forms, says Zim
bardo, and thus every case involves a dif
ferent form of treatment. For example, there
are people who are very outgoing in group
situations but who become extremely shy on
a one-on-one basis. Others are perfectly
able to handle close relationships but find
themselves incapable of dealing with
strangers.
Zimbardo says that many shy professors
have great difficulty teaching seminars and
prefer to give lectures, since lectures are
more structured and lack the uncertainty
and spontaneity of open discussion. Thus
even people whose jobs force them to corn

municate every day with fellow human
beings can in fact be very shy on an individ
ual basis.
Recently Zimbardo was involved in a
series of interviews with the man who was
convicted of being the "College Terrace
Rapist," who committed a series of assaults
here between 1971 and 1979. According to
Zimbardo, this man is an example of one of
the extreme forms that shyness can take.

4 Shyness results from a fear
of being rejected. At the
core of shyness is a
sensitivity to being
evaluated by others... The
shy person becomes overly
concerned with this/
— Philip Zimbardo,
Psychology professor

"Here was a man whose shyness pre
vented him from having normal relations
with women, and thus rape became a means
of gaining control over them, of getting re
spect through fear," explains Zimbardo.
Cases such as this, of course, are rare, but
the percentage of American adults who de
scribe themselves as being shy is surprisingly
high. Surveys show that as many as 40 per
cent fall into this category.
In Zimbardo's surveys at Stanford during
the last 10 years, the number of studentswho
described themselves as being shy has never
been less than 38 percent or more than 43
percent.

"One of the saddest statistics," says Zim
bardo, "is that in one survey here 25 percent
of those questioned reported being more
shy since coming to Stanford. In other
words, something about their Stanford ex
perience caused them to become more
shy."
Whether this fact can be attributed simply
to the change of environment and lifestyle
that most incoming freshmen go through, or
whether it is caused by some situation within
the University itself, is unknown. But it iscer
tainly evident that something about college
life contributes to the formation of mental
barriers against other people, concludes
Zimbardo.
Shyness, according to Zimbardo, needs to
be treated only when the person suffering
from it considers it to be an undesirable trait
that prevents him from doing or achieving
some important thing. About two-thirds of
those who consider themselves shy describe
their affliction as a serious one for which
they could use help. Unfortunately, there is
almost no place for them to go.
Probably more is known about shyness as a
result of the research done here at Stanford
by Zimbardo and his staff than from any
where else in the United States. While Zim
bardo continues to offer treatment at his
clinic, he also frequently refers people to a
therapist in Palo Alto who leads groupthera
py sessions.
