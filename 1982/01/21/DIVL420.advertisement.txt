High above Stanford the ultimate adventure between
man and machine takes place: Learning to Fly!!
It is an education ... a freedom ... an investment that
can benefit you throughout your life. For just as with
walking and running, flying once learned, becomes part
of you.
Your time in the Stanford area may be your best
opportunity to learn to fly.
You're not locked in a 9 to 5 job; your
flexible schedule and age provide you an op
portunity to learn to fly in a relaxed manner.
The Stanford Flying Club is a non-profit
organization and offers the lowest possible
rates. You can fly for less than 22 cents per
mile. That's less than a car costs. And could you
afford not to leam to drive?
The unparalleled beauty of California from
the sea to the Sierra's, the ideal climate, and
airports close to campus provide the ideal op
portunity to experience the ultimate adventure.
Many members completed a Solo-License for less than
$432 with only 9 to 18 hours of flight time. Call
today to schedule or just to get information.
