# RDT fights the past, we sent and themselves

### MARTHA CARTER CATHY POLING 
As the lights started to fade in Memorial Auditorium for the
beginning of Repertory Dance Theatre's Friday night performance, I
sat back to see if they couldpossibly live up to the standards that they
maintained as written in the program notes. Without hesitation, they
describe themselves as a "unique phenomenon" among modern dance
companies: a company that has held and achieved goals beyond those
of any other company in the West: a "Living National Treasure."
And granted, they have achieved one very unique goal. In 1979, they
began a compilation of some of the early treasures of modern
American dance heritage. This program, performed Friday night and
entitled Then . . . the Early Years of Modern Dance is a unified
presentation of works characterizing the choreography of the most
prominent pilgrims of modern dance. Starting with Isadora Duncan,
RDT explores in dance and narration, the works of Ruth St. Denis,
Ted Shawn. Helen Tamiris, Rudolph Laben, Hanya Holm, Doris
Humphrey, and Charles Weidman. It is an attempt to educate
audiences of the evolution of technique, styles, and attitudes in
modern dance — and it works pretty well. They do not recreate exactly
the steps, music or costumes, feeling that it would be both impossible
and blasphemous. Instead, they try to perform the dances with the
sincerity and conviction of dancers today, recreating the vision and
the emotional content of the works.

They performed four long and varied works indicating strength, unity
and a good sense of humor. "Presto." the first piece on the program
was the only selection created by an RDT dancer. And. although the
other three pieces by Viola Farber. Kathryn Posin and Bill Evans were
technically precise and appealing to the audience, there was, like the
night before, a slight lack of presence of warmth. Although the
company is technically strong and unified, it seems as if their attempt
to build a diverse repertory of the works of American choreographers
detracts from their own. personal self identity.
They alluded to this problem in their Thursday evening lecture
demonstration. By comparing the dancers to musicians who are
expected to interpret, in their own style, the music of many different
eras and composers, they explained that dancers are not as ready to
give a personal interpretation. To gain enough confidence with
another person's movements so as to interpret it with both accuracy
and personal flair is one of the most difficult goals for a dancer to
achieve. Unfortunately, with RDT's ambitious goals of establishing a
w ide and varied repertory of both historical and contemporary
modern dance, the company may be facing these challenges for a
while.
Repertory Dance Theatre is presenting a unique program, and I
suppose that their historical achievements are a kind of a
phenomenon. They have a great deal to offer, but they didn't quite
convince me that they are America's "Living National Treasure."
Well, not yet. anyway. But. they are certainly on the right track.

Ted Shawn. Helen Tamiris, Rudolph Laben, Hanya Holm, Doris
Humphrey, and Charles Weidman. It is an attempt to educate
audiences of the evolution of technique, styles, and attitudes in
modern dance — and it works pretty well. They do not recreate exactly
the steps, music or costumes, feeling that it would be both impossible
and blasphemous. Instead, they try to perform the dances with the
sincerity and conviction of dancers today, recreating the vision and
the emotional content of the works.

another person's movements so as to interpret it with both accuracy
and personal flair is one of the most difficult goals for a dancer to
achieve. Unfortunately, with RDT's ambitious goals of establishing a

modern dance, the company may be facing these challenges for a

As the lights started to fade in Memorial Auditorium for the
beginning of Repertory Dance Theatre's Friday night performance, I
sat back to see if they couldpossibly live up to the standards that they
maintained as written in the program notes. Without hesitation, they
describe themselves as a "unique phenomenon" among modern dance
companies: a company that has held and achieved goals beyond those
of any other company in the West: a "Living National Treasure."
And granted, they have achieved one very unique goal. In 1979, they
began a compilation of some of the early treasures of modern
American dance heritage. This program, performed Friday night and
entitled Then . . . the Early Years of Modern Dance is a unified
presentation of works characterizing the choreography of the most
prominent pilgrims of modern dance. Starting with Isadora Duncan,
