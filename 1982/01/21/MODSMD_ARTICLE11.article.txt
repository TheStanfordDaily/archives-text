# RDT fights the past, we sent and themselves

As the lights started to fade in Memorial Auditorium for the
beginning of Repertory Dance Theatre's Friday night performance, I
sat back to see if they couldpossibly live up to the standards that they
maintained as written in the program notes. Without hesitation, they
describe themselves as a "unique phenomenon" among modern dance
companies: a company that has held and achieved goals beyond those
of any other company in the West: a "Living National Treasure."
And granted, they have achieved one very unique goal. In 1979, they
began a compilation of some of the early treasures of modern
American dance heritage. This program, performed Friday night and
entitled Then . . . the Early Years of Modern Dance is a unified
presentation of works characterizing the choreography of the most
prominent pilgrims of modern dance. Starting with Isadora Duncan,
RDT explores in dance and narration, the works of Ruth St. Denis,
Ted Shawn. Helen Tamiris, Rudolph Laben, Hanya Holm, Doris
Humphrey, and Charles Weidman. It is an attempt to educate
audiences of the evolution of technique, styles, and attitudes in
modern dance â€” and it works pretty well. They do not recreate exactly
the steps, music or costumes, feeling that it would be both impossible
and blasphemous. Instead, they try to perform the dances with the
sincerity and conviction of dancers today, recreating the vision and
the emotional content of the works.
