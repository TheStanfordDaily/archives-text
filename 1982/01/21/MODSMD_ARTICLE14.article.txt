# Fee assessments: Plans are underway to improve system
## 
### TIM LUNDERGAN 
As students line up over the next few
weeks to ask for a refund of their
fee assessments, representatives of
the ASSU are looking to change the way
those assessments are made.
For openers, the current system
penalizes those who do pay their fees
because, with the exception of Legal
Services, groups funded by the
assessments also serve students who
choose not to fund them. "People take
things like movies and speeches for
granted,"said ASSU alternate Senator
Jordan Bender, noting that many students
fail to associate these services with the fees
which finance them. The inequity is more
noticable now that fees have risen to $2O
this term.
Campus groups have complained to the
ASSU, as some of them fear they will lose
unprecedented amounts of money to those
seeking refunds. "It's the easiest twenty
bucks you'll ever earn, and that buys a lot
of beer," one student said.
Even the University balks at having to
place a widely fluctuating fee on Permits
to Register (PTRs) every term.
ASSU Senate Rules Committee
chairman Jim McGrath is worried that the
system is too loosely organized. "As it
stands now," he said, "there is no reason
why you and five friends can't go out and
organize a group, get a fee assessment, and
divide up the money." ,
Stanford originally followed other
universities in collecting a mandatory
student activities fee. In the 19605, that fee
was $3 (which would be about $lO or $l2
per quarter now, allowing for inflation.)
But during the late '6os, the ASSU was re
organized with an emphasis on
decentralization and direct student
participation. The mandatory system was
replaced by the present one, in which
elections are held to determine which
groups will receive funds, and students
who oppose giving their money to any of
those groups are free to get a refund.
McGrath said he feels the current
system has never worked very well, not
only because it allocates money
inefficiently, but because it is not as
democratic as its designers probably
intended.
Now all organizations receiving fee
assessments collect the same amount of
money, although the smallest may have
relatively few operating expenses, while
the largest has an operating budget of half
a million dollars per year. The ASSU has
grouped some of the smaller organizations
into its program fee (one of the current
assessments), but inequities remain.
McGrath estimates that $30,000 a year
could easily be saved with a more efficient

system.
To get on the ballot, a group needs to
either have 10 percent of Stanford
students sign a petition, or to demonstrate
to the Seante that it will be financially
responsible in using the funds. In practice,
McGrath said, no one uses the petition
method. "Would you go out and try to
organize a petition drive when you could
sit down with (ASSU senator) Mark
Epstein for two hours and work it all out?"
he asked.

There are few checks to ensure that a
group will use the money the way it said it
would, McGrath contends. He said that
although the ASSU was empowered to
review organization budgets, it "has not
been a paragon of virtue" in this regard.
Final authority for deciding which
groups get money and which do not rests
with students who vote in the fee
assessment election. But it is a curious
election process in which the most
effective way to vote against an
organization is not to show up at the polls
T wentv percent of the student population
must vote to make the ballot valid.
Groups need a majority of that vote. Not

voting either way means an organization
has less chance of getting the needed
quorum of 20. As McGrath pointed out,
an organization which gets "Yes" votes
from 53 percent of voters may actually
have minority support because those most
violently opposed to it may not have voted
on it in order to deny it the necessary
quorum.
McGrath's rules committee is meeting
to discuss changes in the way fee
assessments are made. He said there will

definitely be a change in the way the
election results reflect voter preferences.
"It's the most trashy feature in the entire
mechanism," he said.
Other changes may be made as well.
"We won't consider anything sacred,"
McGrath said. "Not elections, not
refunds, not arbitrary group fee
assessments. Everything is open to
question."
The rules chairman is trying to develop
a "pre-screening" plan. He said he feels
that the ASSU, as the students'
representative body, should make some
sort of recommendation of the worth as

well as the financial competence of
applicants for fee assessments before
elections take place in order to inform
students who do not have the time to make
a detailed evaluation themselves. "Don't
make it tougher on the student voter," he
said. "We want to give them lots of
information in readable form. Nothing
too complex or detailed." He added that if
students do not have time to look
thoroughly into each organization before
voting on it, then "the ASSU has to pick
up where they can't. That's delegate
theory."
Although McGrath said he views any
pre-screening board to be strictly an
advisory group, Daily business manager
Andrew Preston is worried that the Senate
will pick up too much power if the rules
are changed. He said he is uneasy about
having "political control over an
independent newspaper." He raised the
possibility that a future newspaper staff
could write uncomplimentaryarticles
about the ASSU and suddenly find it was
not recommended for funding. That kind
of inhibiting pressure, he said, could be
serious.
McGrath considers that scenario
unlikely. He pointed out that the ASSU
called for a special election when another
independent group, the Band, failed to get
majority support. Although the Senate
received criticism for allowing a group to
have a second chance, "We just didn't
think students really wanted to cripple the
band," McGrath said.
ASSU Alternate Senator Jordan
Bender said some possible changes, like
instituting a mandatory fee, could give the
ASSU "almost too much power" in
allocating the money. He said the current
process of seeing 20 groups half an hour at
a time and then deciding if they are
financially competent is already extremely
demanding on ASSU members.
The problem of escalating costs
remains. A mandatory fee limiting the
number of groups receiving funding
would keep the assessment low, but at the
loss of student autonomy.
The rules committee will make
recommendations to the Senate in
February on the assessment issue. The
Senate is expected to act on them before
the end of spring term. Then, according to
Bender, students will have to approve any
changes in a referendum.
The committee will hold a public
meeting Jan. 26 in Tresidder Union to
consider ways of changing the present
system in which groups depend on beirrg
funded bv elections in which potentially
ill-informed students vote or have their
vote count more by not voting and then
ask for their money back.

a "pre-screening" plan. He said he feels
that the ASSU, as the students'
representative body, should make some
sort of recommendation of the worth as

well as the financial competence of
applicants for fee assessments before
elections take place in order to inform
students who do not have the time to make
a detailed evaluation themselves. "Don't
make it tougher on the student voter," he
said. "We want to give them lots of
information in readable form. Nothing
too complex or detailed." He added that if
students do not have time to look
thoroughly into each organization before
voting on it, then "the ASSU has to pick
up where they can't. That's delegate
theory."
Although McGrath said he views any
pre-screening board to be strictly an
advisory group, Daily business manager
Andrew Preston is worried that the Senate
will pick up too much power if the rules
are changed. He said he is uneasy about
having "political control over an
independent newspaper." He raised the
possibility that a future newspaper staff
could write uncomplimentaryarticles
about the ASSU and suddenly find it was
not recommended for funding. That kind
of inhibiting pressure, he said, could be
serious.
McGrath considers that scenario
unlikely. He pointed out that the ASSU
called for a special election when another
independent group, the Band, failed to get
majority support. Although the Senate
received criticism for allowing a group to
have a second chance, "We just didn't
think students really wanted to cripple the
band," McGrath said.
ASSU Alternate Senator Jordan
Bender said some possible changes, like
instituting a mandatory fee, could give the
ASSU "almost too much power" in
allocating the money. He said the current
process of seeing 20 groups half an hour at
a time and then deciding if they are
financially competent is already extremely
demanding on ASSU members.
The problem of escalating costs
remains. A mandatory fee limiting the
number of groups receiving funding
would keep the assessment low, but at the
loss of student autonomy.
The rules committee will make
recommendations to the Senate in
February on the assessment issue. The
Senate is expected to act on them before
the end of spring term. Then, according to
Bender, students will have to approve any
changes in a referendum.
The committee will hold a public
meeting Jan. 26 in Tresidder Union to
consider ways of changing the present
system in which groups depend on beirrg
funded bv elections in which potentially
ill-informed students vote or have their
vote count more by not voting and then
ask for their money back.

As students line up over the next few
weeks to ask for a refund of their
fee assessments, representatives of
the ASSU are looking to change the way
those assessments are made.
For openers, the current system
penalizes those who do pay their fees
because, with the exception of Legal
Services, groups funded by the
assessments also serve students who
choose not to fund them. "People take
things like movies and speeches for
granted,"said ASSU alternate Senator
Jordan Bender, noting that many students
fail to associate these services with the fees
which finance them. The inequity is more
noticable now that fees have risen to $2O
this term.
Campus groups have complained to the
ASSU, as some of them fear they will lose
unprecedented amounts of money to those
seeking refunds. "It's the easiest twenty
bucks you'll ever earn, and that buys a lot
of beer," one student said.
Even the University balks at having to
place a widely fluctuating fee on Permits
to Register (PTRs) every term.
ASSU Senate Rules Committee
chairman Jim McGrath is worried that the
system is too loosely organized. "As it
stands now," he said, "there is no reason
why you and five friends can't go out and
organize a group, get a fee assessment, and
divide up the money." ,
Stanford originally followed other
universities in collecting a mandatory
student activities fee. In the 19605, that fee
was $3 (which would be about $lO or $l2
per quarter now, allowing for inflation.)
But during the late '6os, the ASSU was re
organized with an emphasis on
decentralization and direct student
participation. The mandatory system was
replaced by the present one, in which
elections are held to determine which
groups will receive funds, and students
who oppose giving their money to any of
those groups are free to get a refund.
McGrath said he feels the current
system has never worked very well, not
only because it allocates money
inefficiently, but because it is not as
democratic as its designers probably
intended.
Now all organizations receiving fee
assessments collect the same amount of
money, although the smallest may have
relatively few operating expenses, while
the largest has an operating budget of half
a million dollars per year. The ASSU has
grouped some of the smaller organizations
into its program fee (one of the current
assessments), but inequities remain.
McGrath estimates that $30,000 a year
could easily be saved with a more efficient

system.
To get on the ballot, a group needs to
either have 10 percent of Stanford
students sign a petition, or to demonstrate
to the Seante that it will be financially
responsible in using the funds. In practice,
McGrath said, no one uses the petition
method. "Would you go out and try to
organize a petition drive when you could
sit down with (ASSU senator) Mark
Epstein for two hours and work it all out?"
he asked.

There are few checks to ensure that a
group will use the money the way it said it
would, McGrath contends. He said that
although the ASSU was empowered to
review organization budgets, it "has not
been a paragon of virtue" in this regard.
Final authority for deciding which
groups get money and which do not rests
with students who vote in the fee
assessment election. But it is a curious
election process in which the most
effective way to vote against an
organization is not to show up at the polls
T wentv percent of the student population
must vote to make the ballot valid.
Groups need a majority of that vote. Not

voting either way means an organization
has less chance of getting the needed
quorum of 20. As McGrath pointed out,
an organization which gets "Yes" votes
from 53 percent of voters may actually
have minority support because those most
violently opposed to it may not have voted
on it in order to deny it the necessary
quorum.
McGrath's rules committee is meeting
to discuss changes in the way fee
assessments are made. He said there will

definitely be a change in the way the
election results reflect voter preferences.
"It's the most trashy feature in the entire
mechanism," he said.
Other changes may be made as well.
"We won't consider anything sacred,"
McGrath said. "Not elections, not
refunds, not arbitrary group fee
assessments. Everything is open to
question."
