drive to get as many Stanford students
as possible registered to vote locally. I think
through personal door-to-door contact we can
generate enough concern that there is a reason to
vote here." she said.
According to Katrina Lantos. the congressman
expects support from professorsas well as students.
"We already have a lot of very key and prominent
faculty members who are very supportive, and are
eager to become active and involved in the
campaign." she said.
Last night. Lantos was given "an initial
opportunity to meet certain people on the faculty,"
according to his daughter, by attending a reception
co-hosted by eight Stanford professors.
Lantos was formerly a professor of economics at
San Francisco State University. "Being a university
professor himself, he has spent much of his life on
university campuses," said Katrina Lantos. "He
feels very at home and very at ease in that sort of
context."

Lantos plans to speak on campus again several
times in the near future, according to Zaroff. "If
there's a big consciousness-raising week, like an
'Earth Week." and we think he might be a good
speaker, we'd try to get him."
In general, according to his daughter, the
congressman and his staff believe the addition of
Stanford to the congressional district will prove a
great asset in the upcoming campaign.
"We're very eager to make maximum use of the
Stanford campus as a tremendous reservoir that
any congressman can draw on, not just politically,
but also in terms of its substantive value." she said.
Several students in the audience approached
Zaroff afterwards and offered to help in the
campaign.
Junior Doug Kaye commented that Lantos was
"a very articulate speaker. He seemed to know what
he was talking about. Even though I didn't agree
with him on every issue, it seemed he had done a lot
of research in making his conclusions. I think he'll
serve the constituency here very well."
With mid-term con
gressional elections still 10
months away, Congressman
Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo)
is already working toward
becoming a familiar figure
to the Stanford community.
Speaking yesterday in
Florence Moore Hall, Lan
tos told a crowd of about 50
students he was "delighted
that Stanford University and
the Palo Alto community
have been added to (my)
district. I expect that Stan
ford will be an important
part of the campaign." But,
Lantos charged both Re
publicans and Democrats of
unethical "gerrymander
ing" tactics in the redisrict
ing process and called for a
new system of remapping
whereby computers would
formulate district bound
aries. Lantos claimed he was
"adversly affected" by the
latest rounds of redisrict
ing.

"I lost 86 percent of the
largest Democratic town in
the district (Daly City) and
that's a very serious matter/'
he said.
Lantos called the Polish
crisis the "single most signif
icant international event

since the Red army put
down the Czechoslovakian
attempt at independence."
He stressed, however, the
need to continue nuclear
weapons reductions talks
with the Soviet Union.
"Reducing the threat of
nuclear war transcends the
developments in Warsaw.
When we talk in Geneva we
move somewhat closer to
sanity.
Katrina Lantos, the con
gressman's daughter and
campaign manager, ap
peared optimistic about
about the campaign on
campus. "We are now in the
process of getting our stu
dent volunteer force geared
up."
Coordinating the Stan
ford branch of the "Tom
Lantos for Congress Com
mittee" is junior Sue Zaroff.
Zaroff, who worked as an in
tern for Lantos in Washing
ton last summer, said she be
lieves that her job is to make
Lantos a well-known figure
on campus. "I think once
we educate the Stanford
group, we'll get a lot of sup
port," she said. To generate
that support, Zaroff is plan
ning a major registration
