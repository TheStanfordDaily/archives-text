drive to get as many Stanford students
as possible registered to vote locally. I think
through personal door-to-door contact we can
generate enough concern that there is a reason to
vote here." she said.
According to Katrina Lantos. the congressman
expects support from professorsas well as students.
"We already have a lot of very key and prominent
faculty members who are very supportive, and are
eager to become active and involved in the
campaign." she said.
Last night. Lantos was given "an initial
opportunity to meet certain people on the faculty,"
according to his daughter, by attending a reception
co-hosted by eight Stanford professors.
Lantos was formerly a professor of economics at
San Francisco State University. "Being a university
professor himself, he has spent much of his life on
university campuses," said Katrina Lantos. "He
feels very at home and very at ease in that sort of
context."

Lantos plans to speak on campus again several
times in the near future, according to Zaroff. "If
there's a big consciousness-raising week, like an
'Earth Week." and we think he might be a good
speaker, we'd try to get him."
In general, according to his daughter, the
congressman and his staff believe the addition of
Stanford to the congressional district will prove a
great asset in the upcoming campaign.
"We're very eager to make maximum use of the
Stanford campus as a tremendous reservoir that
any congressman can draw on, not just politically,
but also in terms of its substantive value." she said.
Several students in the audience approached
Zaroff afterwards and offered to help in the
campaign.
Junior Doug Kaye commented that Lantos was
"a very articulate speaker. He seemed to know what
he was talking about. Even though I didn't agree
with him on every issue, it seemed he had done a lot
of research in making his conclusions. I think he'll
serve the constituency here very well."
