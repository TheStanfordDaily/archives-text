## Battle against Watt foreseen

Reaction against Secretary of
the Interior James Watt's ef
forts at rescinding environ
mental protections has led to
membership increases in or
ganizations dedicated to pre
serving the environment, said
Congressman Tom Lantos yes
terday at a ceremony com
memorating the 15,000 th per
son to join the Loma Prieta
chapter of the Sierra Club.
Lantos cautioned the hand
ful of people at the ceremony
that the battle against Watt's
environmentally destructive
policies will be long.
"We have had some initial
successes in blunting the thrust
of James Watt and his cohorts,
but their ability to commit mis
chief is unending," Lantos said.
Lantos said the ceremony
was lacking in one important
player Watt. "He has con
tributed enormously to
strengthening environmental
awareness. He should be given
a book and a t-shirt," Lantos

said with tongue in cheek.
Lantos, who has been heavily
involved in efforts to preserve
Sweeney Ridge, an un
developed area on the Penin
sula where San Francisco Bay
was first sighted by the
Spaniards, invited everyone
present at the meeting to testi
fy at a congressional hearing on
the issue to be held next week.
This year legislation was
passed by Congress that
directed the purchase of
Sweeney Ridge and ap
propriated $lO million for that
purchase, but so far Watt has
refused to make the acquisi
tion.
Lantos called Sweeney Ridge
"the Plymouth Rock of the
West. It is a fabulously beau
tiful piece of land in a densely
populated area," he said.
" We finally succeeded in
passing it through the legisla
ture and James Watt has the ar
rogance to tell the Congress
and the people that he does
not want to purchase it," said
Lantos.

The only strategy being fol
lowed by members of the
House who are concerned with
preserving the environmental
gains made in the past is, ac
cording to Lantos, "to present
our committment to a civilized
and aesthetically pleasing en
vironment to the public."
Chris Daniels, membership
chairman of the Loma Prieta
chapter of the Sierra Club,
called the increase in the Sierra
Club which has occurred since
the new administration took
office last year "phenomenal."
The Loma Prieta chapter of
the Sierra Club, which includes
Santa Clara, San Mateo and San
Benito counties has, according
to Daniels, added 3000 new
members in the last year.
The growth in membership
in this chapter reflects a na
tionwide increase in the Sierra
Club, which has added 82,0000
new members in the last year
and now has more than 250,000
members, according to
Daniels.
