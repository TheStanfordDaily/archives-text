amounts to "theft from the poor,
he added.
Richard Meehan, a consulting
professor in the Values,
Technology and Society
program, approached the
problem as a participant in the
production of nuclear arms. He
said his engineering firm in the
last decade had hired about 100
engineers, geologists and
architects typical of a cross
section of the University. Yet
only three of those people
resigned or refused to participate
in the production of nuclear arms
components.
Philosophy Prof. Lan Hacking,
a proponent of unilateral

disarmament, called for a
"popular front" to protest the
arms race.
Citizens of California support
the arms race by allowing
research in the area to take place
at public universities. Hacking
said.
A number of questioners after
the discussion ended appeared
agitated. While the panelists did
not agree on how the problem
could be solved, they agreed that
no easy solution was likely in the
near future.
The panel discussion was
sponsored by the Stanford Arms
Control And Disarmament
Forum.
It is time ethical considerations in nuclear
arms decisions dominated planners, Thomas
Ambrogi of the Catholic Church's Commission
on Social Justice said last night.
Yet his panel's discussion of "Ethics and the
Arms Race" demonstrated a lack of cohesive
ness among non-military thinkers on the issue.
Stanford Law Prof. John Barton told a Bishop
Auditorium audience that conventional weap
ons posed the greatest threat to humankind. He
said that while the consequences of nuclear war
were vast, the probability of such a catastrophe
occuring was small. In contrast, a number of
countries are now involved in wars using con
ventional arms supplied by the superpowers. He
suggested concentrating on limiting conven
tional arms exports.
Expanding cultural contacts, promoting un
derstanding between the superpowers and mak
ing the United Nations a more effective body
would serve to reduce tensions which foster the
arms race, he said.

Ambrogi, a former Jesuit now in the
Archdiocese of San Francisco, said numerous
Catholic bishops had spoken out against nuclear
weapons because the weapons are incompatible
with the Church's philosophy of a just war.
Because nuclear weapons indiscriminately
destroy non-combatants as well as soldiers and
because the good achieved from nuclear de
struction could not possibly outweigh the evil
created, Ambrosi said, nuclear war was con
demned by the second Vatican Council which
reviewed Church policies in the 1960s as a
"crime against God and mankind."
"These are not just a few freaky bishops"
speaking out against the arms race, but the en
tire church, Ambrogi said.
Military planners who speak of "megadeaths"
(a unit of measure representing one million
deaths) have too much influence in decision
making, he said.
Spending vast sums of money on arms while
much of the world remains impoverished
amounts to "theft from the poor,
he added.
