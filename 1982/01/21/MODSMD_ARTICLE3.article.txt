## Graduate life: A graduate 'Stanford Experience'? What are some grad concerns? 
### PEGGY HERNANDEZ 
Tierry Friedemann is a third-year
graduate student at Stanford. She is
working on a degree in genetic studies
and is currently trying to put together a thesis
on genetics and population genetics. In her
free time. Friedemann likes to bike ride, visit
friends, party and spend time with Stanford's
yacht club, of which she's a member.
Friedemann. 24, estimates it will be 2
years before she completes her Ph.D. studies
and begins her post-doctoral work.

Mark Aaker works as a computer assistant
design engineer at NASA. He's also a part
time graduate student in the Engineering
Department. The masters program in
industrial engineering and engineering
management typically takes a full-time grad
student 1 1 : to complete. It will take Aaker,
25.2 1 : years.
Stanford graduate students are a diverse
lot.
The diversity can be attributed to the sheer
number of grad students 5500 who are
each enrolled in one of seven schools:
Business. Earth Sciences. Education.
Engineering. Humanities and Sciences. Law
and Medicine.
The essence of graduate work is studying, a
routine which leaves time for little else. But
there are common denominators between the
thousands of graduates: many worry about
the lack of available on-campus housing and
spiraling off-campus costs, tuition costs are
depressing and dwindling research funds
plague most departments.
Grad students can be characterized by
three traits, said Jean Fetter, associate dean
of the graduate division: talent, diversity and
multi-faceted roles. (Stanford's graduate
administration is comprised of one dean, four
associate deans and five assistant deans.)
The "talent" aspect is selfâ€”evident, she
said and "diversity" is attributed to the
number of students from all over the world.
It is the "multi-faceted" role which is the
most complex. Fetter said. "Graduates are
students, teachers, researchers, often parents
and a lot of them work." she said. "The
graduate phase of your life is complex
because you have so many roles to play. No
other element of Stanford has that number of
facets."

This may coincide with an announcement
recently made by Cowell Health Center. The
majority of patients using the Counseling and
Psychological Services at Cowell are grad
students. Dr. David Dorosin, director of
those services, said.
"It is the graduates who have the greatest
pressures and problems," said Dr. Dorosin.
"Very often these people have worked
extremely hard in order to get into their
highly-rated professional school and now
that they have succeeded it seems less
important to be there." he said. "They find
themselves doubting whether this was the
right choice for them."
Another denominator is a grad's feelings
about the Stanford community. Some grads
love the relaxed aura generated by the people
and environment w hieh constitute the
Stanford community, while others berate the
community for its lack of social and political
awareness.
But the major common denominator
among grads seems to be that few are able to
make the attempt to get to know grads in
other schools, let alone Stanford's 6590
undergrads. Many grads meet undergrads
while serving as teacher's assistants, but Gail
Perez, a Ph.D. English candidate, said, "We
don't socialize with the undergraduates
because, as teachers, it seems inappropriate."
The lack of graduate communication
between the various schools is something
Stanford's administration savs it is accutely
aw are of and is trying to overcome. It's
something grads think about, maybe worry
about and regret, but it's something which is
not high on their list of priorities. The priority
is Stanford University in the academic sense.
"The general philosophy of graduate
education is that it is a salient part of this
institution's educational program," said
Albert Hastorf. vice president and provost.
He said Stanford strives to balance graduate
and undergraduate education so that the two
complement one another.
Nonetheless, Hastorf also said Stanford
"looks at graduate students as organized and
operated by departments" and that most
grads have little opportunity for taking
courses outside of their departments.
Another key to understanding graduate
students is separating the masters candidates
"professionals," as Hastorf calls them
from the doctorate candidates. The
professional programs are found in law,
business, medicine, engineering and
communications. But most advanced degree
programs incorporate the masters program
into the doctorate program because the
University has relatively few masters
programs in its seven schools. (The number of
"professional" students, though, far
outweighs the number of doctorate
candidates.)
This separation of graduate from graduate
and graduate from undergraduate begins
with the admissions process. All undergrads
are admitted through the dean of admissions'
office while grads apply to and are admitted
by one department. All students, however,
receive a degree from Stanford University.
At East Coast schools such as Harvard and
Princeton, the grads and undergrads are
enrolled in separate colleges in those
institutions. Hastorf said the difference
between Stanford and Harvard and
Princeton is in name only. The admissions
process is identical, he said.
It's not only the admissions process which
is identical to East Coast schools: the quality
of education is as superb and. in many cases,
better. In a 1978 study published by the
American Council on Education. "Rating of
Graduate Programs." the quality of
Stanford's faculty was ranked among the top
five nationally in 16 fields, a total exceeded
only by Berkeley and Harvard.
While many grads said they came to
Stanford because it's a beautiful campus and
because thev w anted to live in California, the

bottom line is Stanford's reputation. "It's a
name that rings the bell." Perez said.
It's a bell Terry O'Toole opted for.
O'Toole was accepted by Harvard Law
School and received a two-year deferred
admission because he w anted to work before
beginning graduate studies a trait common
to a growing number of graduate students
and desired by businesses. O'Toole, 23,
graduated as an economics major from
Villanova University in Pennsylvania in 1980.
Harvard seemed ideal because his family was
from Massachusetts. Then he began working
for a Philadelphia management consulting
firm and decided he would rather work on a
MBA degree.
"I chose Stanford because it had the name
and the teaching methods." O'Toole, a first
year MBA candidate, said. "Theemphasis
seemed to be on learning rather than the
competition element at Harvard."
O'Toole's decision w as enhanced by
conversations with business personnel and
Stanford alumni. He's satisfied with his
choice.
"I love Stanford because it fulfills my
expectations of graduate education,"
O'T oole said. "The professors are excellent
and for the most part the program is
outstanding."
But O'Toole said the M BA program is so
intensive and self-contained that he doesn't
have much time to enjoy the aesthetic
experiences of Stanford. "There comes a time
when you get sick of graduate students,"
O'T oole said. But "there is a real separation
of graduates and undergraduates by the
nature of our classes.

"Sometimes we sit around and say, "Why
don't we meet more undergraduate women?"
he said. "We try to go to Tresidder to see the
other world."
Tresidder Union, and particularly the
Coffee House, is frequented by grad students.
But Gail Perez thinks the Coffee House is an
inadequate facility for grad students to
socialize. She'd like to see a pub or bar set up
for grads. This way. perhaps, more
interaction between grad students w ill occur,
she said.
There is no one place grad students meet,
either on or off campus. Most grads study in
their respective department's libraries and
socialize at private parties or at deparment
functions.
"The chief consequence of this is that we're
ineffective politicallv." Perez said.

Gradlife is an illusion it's
what you make of it.
We often wonder why we're
here.
The graduate orientation
materials? I blew it off
Between moving, registration
and exemption exams, I didn't
have time for orientation.
Undergraduates have a real
preconceived notion that all
graduates are serious. That's
true to an extent, but we're
human too and we're
interesting.
I was a grad student, an E. E.,
and from Cro Mem that was
three strikes against me.
I have 550 compatriots. Thank
God I'm not in a department of
eight!
Everywhere else, people go to
the union it's a forum. Here
it's just a cafeteria that
everyone avoids.
We have no class unity.
A lot of graduate students have
their own lives and are more
focused on things outside of the
University than
undergraduates.
I'm having a blast here!

dating a woman 14 years
younger.


But the major common
denominator among grads
seems to be thatfew are able
to make the attempt to get
to know grads in other
schools...


The lack of graduate
communication between the
various schools is something
Stanford*s administration
says it is acutely aware of
and is trying to overcome.
Tl he lack of political clout may be due in
part to the high mobility of grad
students. Depending on the program
and department they enter, grads can be here
for a one-vear masters program or four years
or more for a doctorate. This year alone, 2152
of the total graduate population are in their
first year at Stanford.
The lack of clout is evident in poor grad
turnout at the Graduate Student
Association's Monday meetings. An average
of 15 students attend. Worse, the ASSU
recently announced that the 10 graduate
senators had a far worse attendance record
than the 10 undergraduate senators from
May through December 1981. This, said
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps, makes it
difficult for the ASSU to serve graduate
students.
It is the Stanford administration's hope
that these needs are being met by the grad
students' departments. Perez said the English
Department is effective in assisting her
through her program, but O'Toole said that,
while the Business School attempts to meet
his needs, the number of students in the MBA
program limits successful interaction
between students and faculty.
Hastorf is aware of the problem. "I feel
some departments do a lot to make the
student feel a part of the departmfental family,
but I can think of many departments which
don't do much," he said. Ultimately,
however, Hastorf said, it is up to the
department to reach graduate students.
The departmental family role doesn't stop
the administration from trying to make grad
students feel a part of Stanford University.
Last fall, for the first time, the University's
graduate division held orientation programs
for all incoming grad students. They were
held from Sept. 25 through Sept. 27 and
included teaching assistant workshops, a
graduate information fair, guided tours,
dinners and concerts.
The graduate division offices also sent out

a booklet. "Guide to University Resources
for Graduate Students," which included an
introduction to student services, a dictionary
on "The Stanford Dialect" ("Hoo Tow":
Hoover Tower, "The Village": Escondido
Village) and an overview of Stanford's
organizational stucture. The graduate
division office plans to make both the
orientation and booklet permanent facets
available to grad students.
The University also sponsors various clubs
and organizations designed specifically for

grads. Many of these groups, some with the
aid of the GS A. are attempting to sponsor
mutual functions to facilitate awareness of
graduate needs.
Ultimately, however, it is up to the grad
student to make the most of Stanford. While
the undergrad relies on the University as a
whole to make him feel a part of Stanford, the
grad experience depends on the size and
nature of his department. This is the key
difference between Stanford's graduate and
undergraduate experience.

I often find it useful andfun to
masquerade as an
undergraduate.
Without knowing it, grad
students begin facing deep
philosophical problems.
Who's Gerald Lieberman?
There's no visible social life
here except jogging.
My complaint is, tight and
friendly as departments are,
there is nowhere to meet other
graduate students. I don't
think a yearly beer bash would
do it.
Grad students are over
educated and under-loved.
We need a forum for graduate
students to find out about one
another. Maybe a column in
the Daily. All we hear is
unfriendly gossip from the
freshmen.
