# Housing: Grad students demand better conditions, more space in on-campus housing facilities
## 
### SALLY NEWMAN 
Statistically speaking, a Stanford graduate
student's chances are almost one in three of
being assigned space in the University housing
system, and it's a sure bet that these
accommodations will be both less expensive and
more centrally located than anything available off
campus.
But what exactly do graduates get for their
money? Why do they choose to live on campus? Is it
worth the sacrifice of privacy which must be made?
Do graduate residences really fill the bill, or are
students counting the minutes until they can move
off-campus?
The answers to these questions are as varied as
the nearly 1800 students the residences house.
Because graduates' expectations of their residences
and dorm life in general are more realistic than
undergraduates', they generally find themselves,
though not ecstatic, able to accept their situation
with good humor.
"Structurally, the housing is very austere," said
Dan Cohen, a second-year law student who is
midway through his second year in Crothers Hall,
"but it's cheap, and it's convenient."
Price and proximity are probably the two most
frequently cited reasons for living on campus. "The
rent is decent compared to outside," commented
Rod Sinks, a master's student in electrical
engineering who lives in Blackwelder, one of the
Escondido Village high-rises.
The figures bear him out. A one-bedroom
apartment in the Palo Alto-Menlo Park area starts
at $3OO per month. Depending on its location,
available amenities, and whether it is a lease or a
sub-let, that figure may reach $650 to $7OO per
month. A typical Oak Creek apartment runs $6OO
per month, according to average figures supplied by
the Rental Housing Office to students looking for
off-campus housing.
Not surprisingly, Palo Alto ranks in the top five
in nationwide surveys of rental housing costs. And
even an expensive apartment is difficult to come by:
vacancy rates in Palo Alto and surrounding
communities are consistently under 1 percent.
"Living in Crothers Memorial, I'm close to the
dining halls, libraries and classes," said one
resident, a doctoral student in mechanical
engineering. "Other things would be nice, but
they're not as important as convenience, especially
since we spend so much time studying," he added.
While the residences are hardly deluxe
accommodations, graduates ranked custom
furnished interiors considerably less important
than privacy. And the administration's goal is
simply to house the maximum number of students
at the most reasonable prices possible. "When
you're in the business of allocating a scarce
resource, equity rules the day," said Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons.
"Cro Mem is a convenient place to live, but don't
expect a social life there," said resident Ralph
Samuelson.
To graduate students, fear of isolation parallels
undergraduate apprehensions albout loneliness.
However, the symptoms may be more acute and
more painful to the graduate student, since most
of his time revolves around his studies, and back in
the dorm, "everyone lives with his door closed,"
according to Cro Mem resident Joe Altmaier.

"You have to really work at getting to know
someone," said Ron Majewski, a graduate in
electrical engineering. "The problem is that
everyone is so busy; the graduate school curriculum
is just so demanding."
Escondido Village is not immune to this malady;
if anything, feelings of isolation are more common
there.
On the other hand, accomodations can be too
close for comfort. Many grads assigned to Crothers
and Cro Mem were chagrined to discover that most
of the rooms there were one-room doubles. "Grad
students shouldn't be made to live in doubles!"
declared first-year law student John Olson, a
resident of Crothers.
A number of engineers from Cro Mem elected to
move to an apartment in Escondido Village rather
than live in a one-room double. Floyd Chadee, an
operations research student from Trinidad, lived in
Cro Mem for one quarter before moving to
Escondido Village. "You shouldn't have to share a
room with someone when you're 24," he said.
In spite of the complaints, students are clamoring
for more graduate student housing. Demand
constantly exceeds supply. After 1070 students were
housed, there were approximately 1900 people on
Escondido Village waiting lists last autumn.
In the early 1970s the Village, which until then
had housed only married students, was opened to
single students. Although Escondido still
emphasizes family housing, just over half of its 1300
apartment units are now occupied by students
without children.
When priorities for Escondido Village are
granted, the University openly discriminates in
favor of students with children, according to Lyons,
for several reasons. "One problem is that the damn
local housing market discriminates against kids,"
he said. "Most places around here won't rent to
families and the few that do charge outrageous
sums."
"Even if this weren't the case, "singles would still
have the edge over couples." Lyons explained that
by pooling resources, four or five single students
would have more money at their disposal and
would thus "effectively squeeze families out."
What can be done to ease the graduate housing
crunch? Not very much at least not in the near
future according to associate Dean of
Residential Education Norm Robinson. Once the
new undergraduate dormitory is completed,
though, grad students will occupy most of
Manzanita Park.

"While a trailer isn't as bad as being shanghaied
off campus somewhere, it sure as hell isn't as nice as
some of the other residences," commented Lyons.
Fortunately, he added, the trailers are compatible
"programmatically" with graduates' needs,
especially the need for privacy.
One plan which is currently being implememnted
at Escondido is a one-year limit on single student
housing. Unless a single student draws extremely
well in the Escondido housing lottery, he will have
to move out of Escondido at the end of his first year
to make way for new students. Robinson said that
the plan wouldallow new students to "get
organized," become familiar with their
surroundings, and meet people with whom they
