# GSA: A core of active members tries to represent graduate student needs but faces a plethora of difficulties
## 
### TODD PICKETT 
Altogether, they compose nearly
half of the University enrollment.
Yet seldom are graduate students
all together a fact that has made their
representation a difficult task. Divided by
departments and diverse living situations,
grad students' needs are often distinct
from one another and removed from those
of the undergraduate population. For the
administration, graduate student
representation is an enigma; for some grad
students, it is a frustration.

A child of this frustration is the
Graduate Student Association (GSA).
Officially, they are a student volunteef
organization a club. The ASSU
remains the only body of students that can
officially govern graduate affairs. Thus
the GSA is primarily a lobbying group for
graduates, said Eric Berg, treasurer of the
GSA.
"We try to represent what we think
interests are as we perceive them," said
Berg.
For the last two academic years, the
GSA has gotten a push from fee
assessments which have equipped the
organization with a combined total of
more than $20,000. After being rejected in
last spring's election because less than 20
percent of the student body voted on the
GSA assessment, the GSA campaigned
hard before the fall election and received,
of 16 organizations on the ballot, the
fourth highest number of "yes" votes from
the student body. Perhaps the most
effective campaign device was a poster
depicting a grad student living and
working in the Quad under the protection
of only an umbrella. The caption asked
undergraduates, "Do you want your
exams graded under these conditions?"
The answer from the students seemed to
be "no."
Those involved with the GSA see their
job as defining the issues that affect
graduate students and lobbying for
effective solutions, said Berg. "We're not
trying to be an alternative student

government,"
he said. Yet
members of the
GSA feel that current
graduate needs cannot be
met effectively by the ASSU.
/ "The ASSU has been helpful to
us," said Berg, "but being the ASSU
they have a lot of housecleaning chores.
They spend a lot of time just being the
ASSU. They can't put the time into the
specific issues."

Graduate ASSU senator Dennis
Romero views the GSA as an important
voice of graduate student concerns. "The
ASSU tends to be primarily for
undergraduate students . . .it just works
out that way," he added.
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps, an
undergraduate, welcomes the GSA as an
additional campus lobbying group on
campus that could help in coordinating
student interests and passing them on to
the ASSU to be acted on. With regard to
the ASSU's ability to act on graduate
student issues, Phelps said, "We should be
able to if we can get the grad students in
the ASSU who would put in the time."
"Like it or not, the ASSU is the only
official represenative for graduate
students," said undergraduate ASSU
senator Mark Epstein, who has
encouraged the GSA to establish better
rapport with the grad student senators.
Among the more pertinent issues that
the GSA has adopted are: graduate
student housing, social integration of
graduate students and graduate student
issues in research. Encouraged by the
positive influence the GSA has had on
issues like graduate housing, Berg said,
"There's a growing awareness that grad
students are being slighted."
While other grad student organizations
exist, many of them cater to the needs of
women, minorities or a specialized field of
academic study, said Jean Fetter,
associate dean of graduate studies.
According to Fetter, the GSA has greatly
improved under the leadership of Berg.
She said she expects the organization to be
an important source for the
administration's understanding of
graduate needs, and added that "the
administrative offices should take the full
burden of services to graduate students."
Referring to the difficulty of accurately
representing graduates with the small
number of those currently attending GSA
meetings, she said, "It's a labor of love and

it's at its beginning stages of
development."
Presently, the GSA draws about 15 to
20 graduate students to each of its
meetings, said Berg. The number is an all
time high for the GSA, said Berg.
He recognizes that the pressure placed on
graduate students severely limits their
involvement in extra-curricular activities.
"For graduate students, going to school is
like a job," he said. Academic demands
from departments and the concerns of
supporting a family often do not allow
many grad students to join committees
that work to improve graduate student
living, he said.
From among the GSA regulars, Five
members are elected quarterly to the
Finance committee which determines the
allocation of GSA funds. According to
Berg, the budget divides this year's
$ 10,000 assessment into roughly into three
equal categories: graduate student social
events, allocations for groups sponsoring
different events, and publicity as well as
sponsoring miscellaneous programs like
graduate orientation. Last year's GSA
expenditures primarly funded social
activities and groups planning activities
that would beneFit grad students. These
groups included the philosophy
department, the Black American Law
Students, the El Salvador Solidarity
Committee, the committee sponsoring
World Hunger week, and other groups,
said Berg.
Smaller budget allocations went toward
publicity and to organizations like the
Career Planning and Placement Center,
the Center for Teaching and Learning,
and the Bechtel International Center's
Holiday House, which provides activities
for graduate students who stay on
over the holidays.
The need for social integration might be
the need most consistently voiced among
graduate students. "I feel very isolated,"
said one graduate student. "I usually
associate with only the people in my
department," said another.
To alleviate this problem, the GSA has
sponsored TGIF parties at Encina Station
and various other gatherings. Graduate
students in the Law, Business and Medical
schools, where student groups already
exist for governing the academic and
social life of the graduate student and the
need for social activities like those offered
by the GSA, are not as great, said a
graduate student in the Business School.

However, the student did see the need for
the integration of business students into
University life in general. "It is something
maybe impossible to do, but what's
needed is to get them involved in the
University. They're kindof off campus."
Romero said he thought that even if
steps toward social integration were the
GSA's only accomplishment, the
organization's existence would be
justified.
Through its social events, the GS A has
acquired much of its current popularity
among graduate students many of
whom are ignorant of the other issues
GSA is tackling. "It seemed like those
parties were just to get dates for
engineers," said one graduate student.
Recent lobbying for more graduate
housing and a calendar of GSA events that
was distributed to graduate students has
given many students the impression that
the GSA has become more active.
"They have been a very active body in
the last two months," said Mike Perez,
assistant dean of student affairs. "Anyone
who criticizes them must be naive," he
said. Perez added that he did not think
that the ASSU alone can adequately
represent graduate students.
Recently, the GSA's major thrust has
been to ameliorate graduate housing
conditions. GSA member Bill Smith
spearheads the lobbying that has
concentrated on expediting the
construction of graduate housing and the
lessening of rent increases in the
meantime. Smith maintains that graduate
housing ranks third in the University's
housing priorities, behind undergraduate
and faculty. "It should at least be equal
with faculty," he said.
Smith and the GSA have met numerous
times with Norman Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, to work on
means of alleviating the housing costs.
These costs threaten to put the grad
students in dire straits in a year of budget
cuts that have revoked other financial
support, said Smith. In addition, the GSA
is attempting to organize the Village
Council from among the residences at
Escondido Village. A petition opposing
the proposed annual 17 percent rent
increase is being circulated in the Village.
According to Robinson, the GSA has
had a positive effect on making students
aware of the housing issues. He added,
"The success of the GSA depends largely
on who the officers are."

Altogether, they compose nearly
half of the University enrollment.

students in dire straits in a year of budget
cuts that have revoked other financial
support, said Smith. In addition, the GSA
is attempting to organize the Village
Council from among the residences at
Escondido Village. A petition opposing
the proposed annual 17 percent rent
increase is being circulated in the Village.
According to Robinson, the GSA has
had a positive effect on making students
aware of the housing issues. He added,
"The success of the GSA depends largely
on who the officers are."

Altogether, they compose nearly
half of the University enrollment.
Yet seldom are graduate students
all together a fact that has made their
representation a difficult task. Divided by
departments and diverse living situations,
grad students' needs are often distinct
from one another and removed from those
of the undergraduate population. For the
administration, graduate student
representation is an enigma; for some grad
students, it is a frustration.

A child of this frustration is the
Graduate Student Association (GSA).
Officially, they are a student volunteef
organization a club. The ASSU
remains the only body of students that can
officially govern graduate affairs. Thus
the GSA is primarily a lobbying group for
graduates, said Eric Berg, treasurer of the
GSA.
"We try to represent what we think
interests are as we perceive them," said
Berg.
For the last two academic years, the
GSA has gotten a push from fee
assessments which have equipped the
organization with a combined total of
more than $20,000. After being rejected in
last spring's election because less than 20
percent of the student body voted on the
GSA assessment, the GSA campaigned
hard before the fall election and received,
of 16 organizations on the ballot, the
fourth highest number of "yes" votes from
the student body. Perhaps the most
effective campaign device was a poster
depicting a grad student living and
working in the Quad under the protection
of only an umbrella. The caption asked
undergraduates, "Do you want your
exams graded under these conditions?"
The answer from the students seemed to
be "no."
Those involved with the GSA see their
job as defining the issues that affect
graduate students and lobbying for
effective solutions, said Berg. "We're not
trying to be an alternative student

government,"
he said. Yet
members of the
GSA feel that current
graduate needs cannot be
met effectively by the ASSU.
/ "The ASSU has been helpful to
us," said Berg, "but being the ASSU
they have a lot of housecleaning chores.
They spend a lot of time just being the
ASSU. They can't put the time into the
specific issues."

Graduate ASSU senator Dennis
Romero views the GSA as an important
voice of graduate student concerns. "The
ASSU tends to be primarily for
undergraduate students . . .it just works
out that way," he added.
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps, an
undergraduate, welcomes the GSA as an
additional campus lobbying group on
campus that could help in coordinating
student interests and passing them on to
the ASSU to be acted on. With regard to
the ASSU's ability to act on graduate
student issues, Phelps said, "We should be
able to if we can get the grad students in
the ASSU who would put in the time."
"Like it or not, the ASSU is the only
official represenative for graduate
students," said undergraduate ASSU
senator Mark Epstein, who has
encouraged the GSA to establish better
rapport with the grad student senators.
Among the more pertinent issues that
the GSA has adopted are: graduate
student housing, social integration of
graduate students and graduate student
issues in research. Encouraged by the
positive influence the GSA has had on
issues like graduate housing, Berg said,
"There's a growing awareness that grad
students are being slighted."
While other grad student organizations
exist, many of them cater to the needs of
women, minorities or a specialized field of
academic study, said Jean Fetter,
associate dean of graduate studies.
According to Fetter, the GSA has greatly
improved under the leadership of Berg.
She said she expects the organization to be
an important source for the
administration's understanding of
graduate needs, and added that "the
administrative offices should take the full
burden of services to graduate students."
Referring to the difficulty of accurately
representing graduates with the small
number of those currently attending GSA
meetings, she said, "It's a labor of love and

it's at its beginning stages of
development."
Presently, the GSA draws about 15 to
20 graduate students to each of its
meetings, said Berg. The number is an all
time high for the GSA, said Berg.
He recognizes that the pressure placed on
graduate students severely limits their
involvement in extra-curricular activities.
"For graduate students, going to school is
like a job," he said. Academic demands
from departments and the concerns of
supporting a family often do not allow
many grad students to join committees
that work to improve graduate student
living, he said.
From among the GSA regulars, Five
members are elected quarterly to the
Finance committee which determines the
allocation of GSA funds. According to
Berg, the budget divides this year's
$ 10,000 assessment into roughly into three
equal categories: graduate student social
events, allocations for groups sponsoring
different events, and publicity as well as
sponsoring miscellaneous programs like
graduate orientation. Last year's GSA
expenditures primarly funded social
activities and groups planning activities
that would beneFit grad students. These
groups included the philosophy
department, the Black American Law
Students, the El Salvador Solidarity
Committee, the committee sponsoring
World Hunger week, and other groups,
said Berg.
Smaller budget allocations went toward
publicity and to organizations like the
Career Planning and Placement Center,
the Center for Teaching and Learning,
and the Bechtel International Center's
Holiday House, which provides activities
for graduate students who stay on
over the holidays.
The need for social integration might be
the need most consistently voiced among
graduate students. "I feel very isolated,"
said one graduate student. "I usually
associate with only the people in my
department," said another.
To alleviate this problem, the GSA has
sponsored TGIF parties at Encina Station
and various other gatherings. Graduate
students in the Law, Business and Medical
schools, where student groups already
exist for governing the academic and
social life of the graduate student and the
need for social activities like those offered
by the GSA, are not as great, said a
graduate student in the Business School.

However, the student did see the need for
the integration of business students into
University life in general. "It is something
maybe impossible to do, but what's
needed is to get them involved in the
University. They're kindof off campus."
Romero said he thought that even if
steps toward social integration were the
GSA's only accomplishment, the
organization's existence would be
justified.
Through its social events, the GS A has
acquired much of its current popularity
among graduate students many of
whom are ignorant of the other issues
GSA is tackling. "It seemed like those
parties were just to get dates for
engineers," said one graduate student.
Recent lobbying for more graduate
housing and a calendar of GSA events that
was distributed to graduate students has
given many students the impression that
the GSA has become more active.
"They have been a very active body in
the last two months," said Mike Perez,
assistant dean of student affairs. "Anyone
who criticizes them must be naive," he
said. Perez added that he did not think
that the ASSU alone can adequately
represent graduate students.
Recently, the GSA's major thrust has
been to ameliorate graduate housing
conditions. GSA member Bill Smith
spearheads the lobbying that has
concentrated on expediting the
construction of graduate housing and the
lessening of rent increases in the
meantime. Smith maintains that graduate
housing ranks third in the University's
housing priorities, behind undergraduate
and faculty. "It should at least be equal
with faculty," he said.
Smith and the GSA have met numerous
times with Norman Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, to work on
means of alleviating the housing costs.
These costs threaten to put the grad
students in dire straits in a year of budget
cuts that have revoked other financial
support, said Smith. In addition, the GSA
is attempting to organize the Village
Council from among the residences at
Escondido Village. A petition opposing
the proposed annual 17 percent rent

construction of graduate housing and the
lessening of rent increases in the
meantime. Smith maintains that graduate
housing ranks third in the University's
housing priorities, behind undergraduate
and faculty. "It should at least be equal
with faculty," he said.
Smith and the GSA have met numerous
times with Norman Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, to work on
means of alleviating the housing costs.
These costs threaten to put the grad
students in dire straits in a year of budget
cuts that have revoked other financial
support, said Smith. In addition, the GSA
is attempting to organize the Village
Council from among the residences at
Escondido Village. A petition opposing
the proposed annual 17 percent rent
increase is being circulated in the Village.
According to Robinson, the GSA has
had a positive effect on making students
aware of the housing issues. He added,
"The success of the GSA depends largely
on who the officers are."

Altogether, they compose nearly
half of the University enrollment.
Yet seldom are graduate students
all together a fact that has made their
representation a difficult task. Divided by
departments and diverse living situations,
grad students' needs are often distinct
from one another and removed from those
of the undergraduate population. For the
administration, graduate student
representation is an enigma; for some grad
students, it is a frustration.

A child of this frustration is the
Graduate Student Association (GSA).
Officially, they are a student volunteef
organization a club. The ASSU
remains the only body of students that can
officially govern graduate affairs. Thus
the GSA is primarily a lobbying group for
graduates, said Eric Berg, treasurer of the
GSA.
"We try to represent what we think
interests are as we perceive them," said
Berg.
For the last two academic years, the
GSA has gotten a push from fee
assessments which have equipped the
organization with a combined total of
more than $20,000. After being rejected in
last spring's election because less than 20
percent of the student body voted on the
GSA assessment, the GSA campaigned
hard before the fall election and received,
of 16 organizations on the ballot, the
fourth highest number of "yes" votes from
the student body. Perhaps the most
effective campaign device was a poster
depicting a grad student living and
working in the Quad under the protection
of only an umbrella. The caption asked
undergraduates, "Do you want your
exams graded under these conditions?"
The answer from the students seemed to
be "no."
Those involved with the GSA see their
job as defining the issues that affect
graduate students and lobbying for
effective solutions, said Berg. "We're not
trying to be an alternative student

government,"
he said. Yet
members of the
GSA feel that current
graduate needs cannot be
met effectively by the ASSU.
/ "The ASSU has been helpful to
us," said Berg, "but being the ASSU
they have a lot of housecleaning chores.
They spend a lot of time just being the
ASSU. They can't put the time into the
specific issues."

Graduate ASSU senator Dennis
Romero views the GSA as an important
voice of graduate student concerns. "The
ASSU tends to be primarily for
undergraduate students . . .it just works
out that way," he added.
ASSU Senate Chair Dave Phelps, an
undergraduate, welcomes the GSA as an
additional campus lobbying group on
campus that could help in coordinating
student interests and passing them on to
the ASSU to be acted on. With regard to
the ASSU's ability to act on graduate
student issues, Phelps said, "We should be
able to if we can get the grad students in
the ASSU who would put in the time."
"Like it or not, the ASSU is the only
official represenative for graduate
students," said undergraduate ASSU
senator Mark Epstein, who has
encouraged the GSA to establish better
rapport with the grad student senators.
Among the more pertinent issues that
the GSA has adopted are: graduate
student housing, social integration of
graduate students and graduate student
issues in research. Encouraged by the
positive influence the GSA has had on
issues like graduate housing, Berg said,
"There's a growing awareness that grad
students are being slighted."
While other grad student organizations
exist, many of them cater to the needs of
women, minorities or a specialized field of
academic study, said Jean Fetter,
associate dean of graduate studies.
According to Fetter, the GSA has greatly
improved under the leadership of Berg.
She said she expects the organization to be
an important source for the
administration's understanding of
graduate needs, and added that "the
administrative offices should take the full
burden of services to graduate students."
Referring to the difficulty of accurately
representing graduates with the small
number of those currently attending GSA
meetings, she said, "It's a labor of love and

it's at its beginning stages of
development."
Presently, the GSA draws about 15 to
20 graduate students to each of its
meetings, said Berg. The number is an all
time high for the GSA, said Berg.
He recognizes that the pressure placed on
graduate students severely limits their
involvement in extra-curricular activities.
"For graduate students, going to school is
like a job," he said. Academic demands
from departments and the concerns of
supporting a family often do not allow
many grad students to join committees
that work to improve graduate student
living, he said.
From among the GSA regulars, Five
members are elected quarterly to the
Finance committee which determines the
allocation of GSA funds. According to
Berg, the budget divides this year's
$ 10,000 assessment into roughly into three
equal categories: graduate student social
events, allocations for groups sponsoring
different events, and publicity as well as
sponsoring miscellaneous programs like
graduate orientation. Last year's GSA
expenditures primarly funded social
activities and groups planning activities
that would beneFit grad students. These
groups included the philosophy
department, the Black American Law
Students, the El Salvador Solidarity
Committee, the committee sponsoring
World Hunger week, and other groups,
said Berg.
Smaller budget allocations went toward
publicity and to organizations like the
Career Planning and Placement Center,
the Center for Teaching and Learning,
and the Bechtel International Center's
Holiday House, which provides activities
for graduate students who stay on
over the holidays.
The need for social integration might be
the need most consistently voiced among
graduate students. "I feel very isolated,"
said one graduate student. "I usually
associate with only the people in my
department," said another.
To alleviate this problem, the GSA has
sponsored TGIF parties at Encina Station
and various other gatherings. Graduate
students in the Law, Business and Medical
schools, where student groups already
exist for governing the academic and
social life of the graduate student and the
need for social activities like those offered
by the GSA, are not as great, said a
graduate student in the Business School.

However, the student did see the need for
the integration of business students into
University life in general. "It is something
maybe impossible to do, but what's
needed is to get them involved in the
University. They're kindof off campus."
Romero said he thought that even if
steps toward social integration were the
GSA's only accomplishment, the
organization's existence would be
justified.
Through its social events, the GS A has
acquired much of its current popularity
among graduate students many of
whom are ignorant of the other issues
GSA is tackling. "It seemed like those
parties were just to get dates for
engineers," said one graduate student.
Recent lobbying for more graduate
housing and a calendar of GSA events that
was distributed to graduate students has
given many students the impression that
the GSA has become more active.
"They have been a very active body in
the last two months," said Mike Perez,
assistant dean of student affairs. "Anyone
who criticizes them must be naive," he
said. Perez added that he did not think
that the ASSU alone can adequately
represent graduate students.
Recently, the GSA's major thrust has
been to ameliorate graduate housing
conditions. GSA member Bill Smith
spearheads the lobbying that has
concentrated on expediting the
construction of graduate housing and the
lessening of rent increases in the
meantime. Smith maintains that graduate
housing ranks third in the University's
housing priorities, behind undergraduate
and faculty. "It should at least be equal
with faculty," he said.
Smith and the GSA have met numerous
times with Norman Robinson, associate
dean of residential education, to work on
means of alleviating the housing costs.
These costs threaten to put the grad
students in dire straits in a year of budget
cuts that have revoked other financial
support, said Smith. In addition, the GSA
is attempting to organize the Village
Council from among the residences at
Escondido Village. A petition opposing
the proposed annual 17 percent rent
increase is being circulated in the Village.
According to Robinson, the GSA has
had a positive effect on making students
aware of the housing issues. He added,
"The success of the GSA depends largely
on who the officers are."
