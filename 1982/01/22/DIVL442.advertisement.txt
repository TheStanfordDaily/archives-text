{" ESTRELLITA (
l RESTAURANT I
) The Stanford Daily says:
1 "La Estrellita features a classic Mexican
C menu which includes everything fioin I
I exquisite tacos to exotic: dishes like chalupas. ,
% The restaurant specializes in five different \
I kinds of burritos. These are not, however, the
\ average Taco Bell variety which can be eaten
i in four bites. These burritos are well over a
\ foot long and a meal by themselves. In
| addition to their famous burritos, the owner
j recommends suizas, enchiladas made with
112 chile sauce and covered with guacamole and I
j sour cream; chimichangas, a flour tortilla 1
112 filled with shredded beef and topped with I
1 guacamole and sour cream; and for 1
I vegetarians, one of their many tostadas, all %
I served on large platters in very generous I
112 portions guaranteed to satisfy even big 1
J appetites. /
I This restaurant has an informal, relaxed <
I atmosphere. The white-walled interior,
C candlelit tables and handmade Mexican decor
/ create the unpretentious ambience found
% south of the border. We highly recommed
I Estrellita."
