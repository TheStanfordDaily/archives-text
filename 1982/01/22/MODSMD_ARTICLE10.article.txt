# Assad rallies Arabs with limited gains

### Washington Post 
Damascus, Syria â€” Syrian
President Hafez Assad, isolated
abroad and facing persistent
political trouble on the home
front, has seized on the Israeli
annexation of Syria's Golan
Heights to try to rally renewed
Arab, Soviet and internal sup
port. But his initial efforts have
produced mixed results.
This is partly because of Syr
ian extremism and partly, too,
because inter-Arab feuds and
the debilitating political effects
of the Iran-Iraq war on the
Arab world are proving ex
tremely difficult to overcome.
The U.N. Security Council
debate on the Israeli action is
shaping up as a "major Syrian
diplomatic fiasco," said a
Palestinian scholar in Beirut
prior to Wednesday's vote on a
diluted Jordanian resolution
substituted for a previous,
hard-line Syrian-inspired call
for mandatory sanctions
against Israel. In addition,
there is no indication that Mos
cow is ready to meet Assad's re
quest for a greater direct com
mitment to Syrian defenses in
case of an Israeli attack.
In addition, Assad has not
succeeded in mending his bad
ly frayed relations with his two
Arab neighbors, Iraq and Jor
dan, a step judged even by the
Syrians as crucial to a more
credible pan-Arab stand

against Israel.
The one major success Assad
has scored in his latest gambit
for Arab world backing has
been a surprising reconcil
iation with Saudi Arabian lead
ers who previously were
furious with him for his refusal
late last year to endorse the
Saudi eight-point Middle East
peace plan.
"The Golan has pushed the
Saudis and Syrians closer to
gether, and both further from
the United States," remarked
one Arab political analyst here.
The Saudis, according to
Palestinian and Syrian sources,
are now ready to provide Assad
with the additional funds he
sought to buy more sophisti
cated Soviet arms to bolster
Syria's already considerable
military might.
The 53-year-old former pilot
and air force commander has
repeatedly stated his goal of es
tablishing a "strategic balance"
with Israel and his moves, such
as now wishing to sign a
strategic cooperation accord
with Moscow, are often a mir
ror image of those of Tel Aviv in
its relations with Washington.
The major danger of Assad's
policy, according to many out
side observers here, is that it
may trigger an Israeli reaction
to thwart Assad's achieving his
proposed strategic balance.
