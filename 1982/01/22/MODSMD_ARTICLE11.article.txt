French nuclear plant stable after attack
The Creys-Malville nuclear plant near Lyons, France, is reported to have suffered
only minor damage after being struck Tuesday by four old, Soviet-made anti-tank
rockets, launched by an anti-nuclear ecologist group. The plant is still two years
away from completion and officials said there is no danger of radioactive leakage.
