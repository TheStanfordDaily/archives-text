# Employee of 40 years has
## observed many changes here 
### Anthea Stratigos 
The Stanford campus today is vastly different
than the one that Karl Steck, a University steam
fitter, sought employment from as a high school
graduate in 1941.
Marking his 40-year anniversary with the Uni
versity last July, he is one of the few people on
campus whose recollections of Stanford history
go back that far.
He remembers President Donald Kennedy's
lab in the old biology building. Recently, he paid
a visit to the president's office where Kennedy
talked with Steck and thanked him for his years
of service.
Not only has he seen administrations change
under six of Stanford's eight presidents, he has
worked long enough to see vast changes in the
physical appearance of the campus.
The Old Union was the equivalent of what
Tresidder Memorial Union is today. Besides
being a women's dormitory, the Old Union
served as a public dining room.
Encina and Sequoia Halls were men's
dormitories and Roble Hall housed only wom
en. Each housing facility boarded only one sex,
as co-educational living was not allowed.
The Bookstore was located in the building
where Stanford's Career Planning and Place
ment Center is today. A little post office sat just
to.the right of the entrance to the road which
runs into Mayfield Avenue.
Campus Drive didn't exist, and Palm Drive was
the main entrance to the University. Off in the
distance Hoover Tower stood, almost complete.
"The scaffolding was still on the outside," said
Steck.
Students during finals, or any other time,
didn't have a choice of which main library to
study in. The older section of Green Library was
the only library. But then again, it only needed to
accommodate approximately 3000 students, the
total enrollment at that time.
Hay grew in Manzanita Trailer Park, Escon
dido Village and other open fields. "Pheasant
and peacocks flew around feeding on grain," re
called Steck.
The Med Center, once the location of a nurs

ery, was also the home of jack rabbits and cot
tontails. "You don't see them anymore, but
there was an awfully lot in those days. Around
the Quad, early morning, you'd see them,"
Steck said.
Steck also spoke of the Athletic Department's
use of sheep grazing the fields to keep the weeds
down.
Steck believes students are more serious today
about their studies, placing social life second.
Thereappear to be fewer practical jokes â€” per
haps the cost of tuition has something to do with
it, said Steck.
Relationships have also altered over the years,
accordig to Steck. Today's students find it dif
ficult to understand the social restrictions faced
by alums. "We couldn't go in a women's
dormitory to work unless there were signs all
over warning (the women). You couldn't come
out until the house mother would come and get
you," he said.
The friendships Steck has made with people
throughout campus, past and present, are what
he likes most about his job. "Being around the
young and all types of people keeps you think
ing young," he said.
Steck has no regrets about working so long in
one place, or qualms about his job or the cam
pus. "I just like it, that's all. There's no problems.
I've always enjoyed it out here, otherwise, I
wouldn't have stayed 40 years." Given the
choice he would do it all over again, he said.
Steck explained that it's hard to find people
who stay at jobs for so long. "Experience has a lot
to do with anything," he said. "Knowing the
campus helps. Newcomers have such a time."
He explained the complexities of modern Stan
ford's machine rooms, steam systems, turn-off
valves and the like. "Everything's complicated
here," he said.
What does his future hold? Steck said he will
probably retire in a few years and "travel if my
wife's and my health hold up." They'll continue
residing in the Bay Area, but asked where he
wants to visit, said Hawaii and New Orleans are
tops on his list.
