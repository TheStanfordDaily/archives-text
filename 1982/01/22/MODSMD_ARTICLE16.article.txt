# Black adolescent females must cope with 'double trouble'
## 
### Katrina Visser 
Growing up black in a white-dominated
world is difficult, but the pressure of being
young, black and a woman is "double trou
ble" for black female adolescents. This was
the topic addressed by Grace Massey and
Valarta Jenkins-Monroe in last Wednesday's
noop lecture, the second of the Jing Lyman
series on "The Ages of Women: A Look at
Women's Life Cycle Development," spon
sored by the Center for Research on Women
(CROW).
Massey and Jenkins-Monroe, both from
the Institute for Developmental Studies in
Oakland, shared the podium for the dis
cussion of their research in the relationships
and roles in black families. Massey, who
holds a Stanford doctorate in education and
sociology, discussed her recently completed
project, "Toddler and Infant Experiences
Study" (TIES), in which 30 black families with
children born in late 1977 were observed
monthly for two years in an attempt to iden
tify the cultural-specific values of black pa
rents.
The findings of Massey's research clarify
much of the earlier literature concerned
with these issues, presenting the black ex
perience of parenting from a more neutral
perspective than other studies, which
Massey contended were often "simplistic
and perjorative," misrepresenting the ma
jority of black families in their focus on

"problem groups" within the black popu
lation.
Early studies also described their observa
tions through middle class white values, a
cultural bias that newer studies are trying to
avoid. These recent studies, according to

These themes are not that
different from those all
adolescents confront, but
'the stress reactions of black
girls differ substantially from
their white counterparts/
The black girl has a 'sense of
shame for being born a
black female and the belief
that the black woman is
subordinate both to men
and to whites, and thus born
to suffer/

Massey, "recognize cultural variations as the
validity of black lifestyle is being accepted."
More recent studies also emphasize the
dual existence of black families who struggle

to preserve their Afro-American culture
while conforming to Euro-American society.
This duality gives both a richness to the black
lifestyle and a difficult "set of stresses and
constraints involved in existing as an op
pressed minority," said Massey.
One very clear message in the TIES study is
the immense variation within the group of
families observed, a group which would
seem to have much in common. Massey said
that it is impossible to develop a comparison
model between black and other cultural
groups before understanding the variation
within the groups.
The areas documented in the TIES study
included parental views and behavior re
garding discipline, perception of the chil
dren's individuality, expectations of respon
sibilities and roles, participation within the
extended family, and perception and ex*
periencesof race identification and confron
tations of racism.
Surprisingly, there was little or no gender
differentiation within the infant-toddler age
group. Demonstrations of affection — hug
ging, kissing, caressing — were bestowed
equally on boys and girls, and roughhousing
and active play was also equal. Likewise,
"discipline and control — both physical and
verbal — was not hahdled differently with
sons and daughters," although there was
much variation from family to family as to the
extent and forms of discipline.

All parents believed their children "must
be taught coping strategies to survive in a
white world." Many fathers thought "the
world would be tough on their sons: there
fore it was necessary for their sons to be
tough." Mothers feared the double burden
of being both black and female for their
daughters.
This issue led to Jenkins-Monroe's dis
cussion of her work with adolescent black
girls, the victims of "double trouble." The
themes Jenkins-Monroe addresses in her
clinical research are the mother and mother
substitute relationships, peer expectations
and interaction, sexuality and male-female
relationships, the roles of fathers and adult
males, and the roles of siblings.
According to Jenkins-Monroe, these
themes are not that different from those all
adolescents confront, but "the stress reac
tions of black girls differ substantially from
their white counterparts." The black girl has
a "sense of shame for being born a black
female and the belief that the black woman
is subordinate both to men and to whites,
and thus born to suffer."
The behavioral pattern of black girls takes
the form of a "depressive reaction," evident
in passive compliance and quiet suffering or
a sudden change in behavioral patterns at
home and in school. Although these reac
tions are often brushed aside as "adolescent
crises," they are critically important in "the

fusion of identity as black and female," said
Jenkins-Monroe.
The uniqueness of the TIES study and the
research techniques of the Institute for De
velopmental Studies lies in their approach to
black individuals and families in the collec-

tion of data. According to Massey, the key
element here is trust; the researchers
worked hard to develop strong rapport with
the parents well before formal observation
began, allowing a level of honesty and dis
closure unattainable in many earlier studies,
where the researchers were viewed with sus
picion and not allowed to view the natural
interaction of the family.
Massey and Jenkins-Monroe are currently
working on funding to follow their study
through the children's entry into the school
environment and on to adolescence, areas
still neglected in developmental research.
