## Editorial Refunds: Think first 
### 
Long lines of Stanford students — in spite of
the rain — outside the ASSU office. Why? Are
elections being held? is it time to sign up for a
University committee?
No. Rather, the longqueuesare made upof
students waiting to take back their fee
assessment dollars, and many of them, we fear,
are taking back all or nearly all of the money
available with nary a second thought.
Many student organizations are learning this
week that they stand to lose as much as one
third or more of the fee assessment money
which was voted to them in a student election,
and which they had expected when planning
their budgets.
It's not so much that students are deciding en
masse to claim fee assessment refunds this week
— after all, that currently is a right explicitly
granted to each student by the ASSU
Constitution. We do object, however, to the
idea of going up to the ASSU office and
collecting $20 simply because it's there.
The sudden interest in fee assessments is badly
mistimed. These long lines were nowhere to be
seen at the elections last quarter which
determined which organizations would receive
fee assessments — and when information about
the services of these groups and their budgets
was most available.
One can oppose forcing students to support
organizations whose services they can
legitimately say they do not use (though in the
interest of the community's common good,sl
per group is hardly unreasonable). At the same
time, though, we question the practice of
allowing students who never even bothered to
vote against the objectionable assessments to

blithely claim refunds.
Furthermore, students who indiscriminately
take back their money are turning the fee
refund system into a farce.
Obviously, asthesystem stands, it is
impossible to police students to make sure that
they are only getting refunds for organizations
which they honestlyfeel are not worthy of
financial support from the student body.
We call for students not to abuse the current
system; moreover, we suggest that the ASSU
effect a remedy, posthaste, to prevent such a
situation from recurring. Possible solutions
include, but are not limited to:
• Not allowing students who did not vote in
the previous fee assessment elections to secure
any refunds; or
• Instituting a policy of mandatory fees.
The latter option would, we hope, cause
students to treat the elections more seriously
and take some care in deciding which
organizations really do deserve fee assessment
dollars.
Students think especially carefully before
claiming a refund from ASSU Legal Counseling,
because that organization requires those who
take their dollar back to forfeit any right to use
the service.
With all other dollarsto which they could lay
claim, we urge students, before they march off
with a couple of fast and easy bucks, to question,
in terms of student services, just how fast and
easy they really are. We ask them to use sound
judgment in deciding whether the
organizations, duly supported in a student
election, really deserve such a mass withdrawal
of support.
