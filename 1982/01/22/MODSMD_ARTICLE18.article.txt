## And now, public affairs office 
### 
A recent column (Daily, Jan. 11)
charged that public relations is a vis
ible shortcoming of the present
Council of Presidents (COP). As di
rector of the present Office of Public
Affairs I would like to take this op
portunity to tell how this short
coming is being remedied.
In the past, the ASSU has been
plagued by the problem of finding
effective ways to promote itself to the
student body. For the first time in a
number of years both the Senate and
the COP have worked together to
mitigate this nagging problem. Last
summer, senators and presidents
drew up a proposal establishing the
Office of Public Affairs.
Autumn quarter was dedicated to
selecting a director as well as staffing
the 15 new positions created by the
office. The office has been in full op
eration since the first week of winter
quarter.
The primary function of the Office
of Public Affairs is to promote and
publicize the ASSU to the Stanford
community. As the column pointed
out, there is a gap between members
of the ASSU and the student body. It
is our hope to narrow this distance
considerably and make the ASSU
more accessible to interested stu
dents.
Specifically, there are four dif
ferent departments in the Office of
Public Affairs: Advertisement, News
letter, Outreach and Distribution.
Probably the two departments which

will be most visible to Stanford stu
dents are Outreach and Newsletter.
Outreach is committed to pres
enting members of the ASSU on a
personal level to students. For exam
ple, sherry hours in student resi
dences,particularly freshman dorms,
with COP and Senate members will
be planned to familiarize students
with the function of these officers as
well as give them the opportunity to
question officers on student con
cerns.
Outreach has also already begun
scheduling press conferences with
COP and Senate members where
Daily staffers may query officers
about meeting their responsibilities.
Open debates between ASSU of
ficers and Faculty Senate members is
another activity Outreach intends to
establish.
The Newsletter staff, too, will at
tempt to promote the ASSU to the
Stanford community.
This publication will provide stu
dents with written material about the
ASSU, outlining its many services.
The newsletter will include profiles
on the COP and Senate, discussing
their role in the ASSU and current is
sues under discussion.
For the first time there will be a
complete and updated calendar in
each issue which will list upcoming
ASSU events. Also included will be a
list of application due dates for posi
tions available for students. We hope

that by the second issue, student
opinion will filter back to the ASSU
through the question and answer
and point/counterpoint sections.
It is true the ASSU has not been
publicized as well as it could be,
however, this does not mean the
Senate and the COP have not ac
complished anything since they were
elected.
On the contrary, the COP and
ASSU Senate have worked hard to
gether to create many new offices,
services, and task forces that have al
ready benefitted students. For exam
ple, they created the Office of In
terns which opened up 55 new posi
tions available in the ASSU (for which
the COP and Senate received over 80
applications).
They set up a forum on rape and es
tablished a Safety Commission. The
Campus Entertainment Board is a
new committee dedicated to bring
ing entertainment on both a small
and large scale to the Stanford com
munity.
One issue in particular both the
COP and Senate have fought vigor
ously over was the proposal to re
institute the "F."
They argued at length before the
Faculty Senate in order to defeat the
proposal. Because of their work, stu
dents have retained the freedom to
drop a class 24 hours before the final,
and not have the "F" recorded on
their transcript.
Many times it might appear to stu
dents that ASSU officers have done
little to meet their needs. In actuality,
the COP and Senate have worked
hard this year to fulfill student needs.
Unfortunately, their work is not pub
licized as well as it should be. Last
week's editorial was constructive in
pointing out this weakness in the
ASSU, however, the student body
should know that the Office of Public
Affairs has been established specifi
cally to correct the problem.

the 15 new positions created by the
office. The office has been in full op
eration since the first week of winter
quarter.
The primary function of the Office
of Public Affairs is to promote and
publicize the ASSU to the Stanford
community. As the column pointed
out, there is a gap between members
of the ASSU and the student body. It
is our hope to narrow this distance
considerably and make the ASSU
more accessible to interested stu
dents.
Specifically, there are four dif
ferent departments in the Office of
Public Affairs: Advertisement, News
letter, Outreach and Distribution.
Probably the two departments which

will be most visible to Stanford stu
dents are Outreach and Newsletter.
Outreach is committed to pres
enting members of the ASSU on a
personal level to students. For exam
ple, sherry hours in student resi
dences,particularly freshman dorms,
with COP and Senate members will
be planned to familiarize students
with the function of these officers as
well as give them the opportunity to
question officers on student con
cerns.
Outreach has also already begun
scheduling press conferences with
COP and Senate members where
Daily staffers may query officers
about meeting their responsibilities.
Open debates between ASSU of
ficers and Faculty Senate members is
another activity Outreach intends to
establish.
The Newsletter staff, too, will at
tempt to promote the ASSU to the
Stanford community.
This publication will provide stu
dents with written material about the
ASSU, outlining its many services.
The newsletter will include profiles
on the COP and Senate, discussing
their role in the ASSU and current is
sues under discussion.
For the first time there will be a
complete and updated calendar in
each issue which will list upcoming
ASSU events. Also included will be a
list of application due dates for posi
tions available for students. We hope

that by the second issue, student
opinion will filter back to the ASSU
through the question and answer
and point/counterpoint sections.
It is true the ASSU has not been
publicized as well as it could be,
however, this does not mean the
Senate and the COP have not ac
complished anything since they were
elected.
On the contrary, the COP and
ASSU Senate have worked hard to
gether to create many new offices,
services, and task forces that have al
ready benefitted students. For exam
ple, they created the Office of In
terns which opened up 55 new posi
tions available in the ASSU (for which
the COP and Senate received over 80
applications).
They set up a forum on rape and es
tablished a Safety Commission. The
Campus Entertainment Board is a
new committee dedicated to bring
ing entertainment on both a small
and large scale to the Stanford com
munity.
One issue in particular both the
COP and Senate have fought vigor
ously over was the proposal to re
institute the "F."
They argued at length before the
Faculty Senate in order to defeat the
proposal. Because of their work, stu
dents have retained the freedom to
drop a class 24 hours before the final,
and not have the "F" recorded on
their transcript.
Many times it might appear to stu
dents that ASSU officers have done
little to meet their needs. In actuality,
the COP and Senate have worked
hard this year to fulfill student needs.
Unfortunately, their work is not pub
licized as well as it should be. Last
week's editorial was constructive in
pointing out this weakness in the
ASSU, however, the student body
should know that the Office of Public
Affairs has been established specifi
cally to correct the problem.

A recent column (Daily, Jan. 11)
charged that public relations is a vis
ible shortcoming of the present
Council of Presidents (COP). As di
rector of the present Office of Public
Affairs I would like to take this op
portunity to tell how this short
coming is being remedied.
In the past, the ASSU has been
plagued by the problem of finding
effective ways to promote itself to the
student body. For the first time in a
number of years both the Senate and
the COP have worked together to
mitigate this nagging problem. Last
summer, senators and presidents
drew up a proposal establishing the
Office of Public Affairs.
Autumn quarter was dedicated to
selecting a director as well as staffing
the 15 new positions created by the
office. The office has been in full op
eration since the first week of winter
quarter.
