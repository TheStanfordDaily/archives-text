# Scholar's visit cancelled

University officials have learned
that the National Academy of Sci
ences (NAS) has cancelled the visit of
a Soviet scholar to Stanford in the
wake of the University's refusal to
bow to State Department restrictions
on his research here.
The visit was scheduled for this
spring.
Unless the University or the State
Department changes its current poli
cies, the NAS will reroute scientist
Nikolay Umnov on his trip to re
search robotics at several major U.S.
universities, NAS spokesman How
ard Lewis told University Press Direc
tor Bob Beyers.
Gerald Lieberman, vice-provost
and dean of graduate studies and re
search, told faculty senate members
in a brief statement yesterday, "Um
nov will not be coming to Stanford;
the University is not prepared to re
ceive him." He called the cancelled
visit "unfortunate."
Increased restrictions by the State
Department on the visitations of for
eign scholars to U.S. universities
come in a wave of governmental
concern over the amount of Western

technology (lowing into Soviet
hands.
Recently, CIA director Bobby Ray
Inman addressed American scien
tists, requesting them to submit their
research for review by intelligence
agencies. Also, according to
Lieberman, a series of talks and
articles by Asst. Secretary of Defense
Frank Carluc ci has reflected the gov
ernment's rigid policies bent against
the transfer of information to the So
viet Union.
As a result, confrontations be
tween university officials and the
State Department have also in
creased in recent years as many uni
versities have fought against govern
ment efforts to impose restrictions.
University President Donald Ken
nedy joined with four other univer
sity presidents a year ago in express
ing "grave concern" over the at
tempts to apply federal export re
strictions to unclassified research.
General opposition to mounting
government restrictions on research
has prompted the Commerce De
partment to consider drafting a bill
that would make it a felony to dis
close potentially vital information

witnout first obtaining a government
license. Lieberman called such a law
"dangerous" adding, "it's bad
enough to have things as they already
are."
Stanford policy in the face of gov
ernment restrictions has firmly de
clared that University programs rep
resent basic and unclassified re
search, according to Lieberman. Al
lowing such restraints could seriously
disrupt the environment necessary to
foster research, a crippling which
might inevitably hurt U.S. technolo
gy more than restrictions would pro
tect it, said Lieberman.
Among U.S. universities, Stanford
is one of the top three in funding re
ceived through contracts from the
Department of Defense, said Bernard
Roth, professor of mechanical engi
neering and Umnov's previously
planned host. Concern over the easy
access to University research should
result in the classifying of the re
search by the State Department, in
which case Stanford would most like
ly remain true to its policy and dis
continue the work, said Roth.
