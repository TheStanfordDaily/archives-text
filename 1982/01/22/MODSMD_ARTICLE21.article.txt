## As costs rise, so does tuition 
### 
Last year, Stanford raised its tuition
13.6 percent and announced that
during the next two years tuition
would have to be moved up to an
even faster rate — about six percent
faster than inflation — if Stanford isto
continue to produce a balanced
budget and maintain the quality of its
academic programs and services.
True to these expectations, the
Long Range Financial Forecast re
leased late in Fall Quarter predicted a
tuition increase of about 15 percent.
That is a forecast, and not a budget;
but the actual number is unlikely to
differ significantly from that value.
It is natural that such decisions
raise troubled or even angry ques
tions. Why is Stanford tuition grow
ing so fast? Is it, in fact, growing faster
than that of comparable places? Is
tuition behaving differently from
other costs in our inflationary econo
my? And — perhaps most important
of all — what are we doing at Stan
ford to mitigate the effects of tuition
increases, so as to preserve access to
the University from all sectors of our
society and so retain the diversity
which we think is so important?
The simple answer, obviously, is
that Stanford's costs are rising, so we
have to charge more to support the
same level of service. Answers at that
level of specificity are never very sat
isfying, and there is a strong im
pression abroad that in fact tuition is
rising faster than comparable costs in
our economy.
In fact, that is not true. Tuition at all
selective private colleges and univer
sities is rising, on the average, at
about the same rate. Historically, it is
a rate slightly higher than the in
crease in the cost of, say, a mid-sized
automobile.
As a consequence, the costs of ser
vices tend to follow the rise in wages.
In short, universitiesare behavingac
cording to economic prediction:
they are raising prices as needed to
counteract increases in costs and to
maintain budgets in which income is
equal to expense.
But, it may be asked, do we really
have to do that? There are, after all,
alternative ways of achieving a bal
anced budget.
• First, could we find other signifi
cant sources of revenue? The answer,
unfortunately, is that we cannot. Of
the other main sources of revenue in
the Stanford operating budget, in
direct cost recovery on sponsored re
search is limited by government
agreement, and although we work
hard to increase the total of gifts for
current use, it is difficult to improve
that by very much in any particular
year. Other strategies (land develop
ment, other new kindsof investment,
and the like) are long — but not short
range ways of changing income.
• Why can't we reduce expenses?

Stanford's main expenditures are for
faculty and staff salaries. Academic
salaries in general have increased
more slowly than those in the other
professions, and we are troubled by
that. To achieve further economies
by retarding the growth in salaries
would worsen an already unfair situ
ation, and would also cause us to suf
fer losses of valuable people to other
institutions and to industry.
Since the quality of our faculty and
staff is one of Stanford's main claims
to distinction, this would be an unac
ceptable strategy. The "controllable"
(i.e. non-salary) items in the Stanford
budget were the subject of signifi
cant economies throughout most of
the early 19705, and are being pared
again in the present round of budget
planning. There is little room for
further reduction.
On the contrary, the cost of utili
ties (to take a single example) has in
creased more than 30 percent over
last year. Even with our best efforts at
conservation and reductions, the
costs of energy and certain other ex
penditure items are thus largely
beyond our control.
We could, of course, pursue a defi
cit budget strategy, but that is to seek
the mythical free lunch.
We can also ask whether Stanford's
tuition increases have been out of
line with those experienced at other
institutions. The answer is that they
have not; indeed, over the past 10
years, Stanford's increases have been
comparable to those of other institu
tions which resemble us in quality.
(In fact, in a tightly clustered group
ours have been among the lowest).
Stanford tuition has not risen un
reasonably fast, either by comparison
with that at other institutions or by
comparison with the cost of other
items in the economy.
Given that Stanford is in the grip of
the same economic circumstances
that drive similar cost increases
elsewhere, and given that these may
not be solved in the near future, it
seems likely that tuition will continue
to grow at a rate faster than inflation.
What can Stanford do to maintain its
openness to students from all socio
economic levels in this society?
This year approximately 4450 Stan
ford undergraduates (68 percent of
the undergraduate student body) re
ceive some form of financial as
sistance. Of this group roughly three
quarters qualify for aid based on
demonstrated financial need. The to
tal amount of this assistance — from
Stanford and non-Stanford sources
in 1981-82 — is $25,870,000. Of this to
tal, 1300 students qualify only for a
job or a loan, representing $9,700,000
of assistance.
In addition, 3150 students qualify
for grant and scholarship aid of
$16,170,000. Of this amount,

$10,695,000 is provided from Univer
sity funds, and $5,475,000 comes from
outside scholarship awards. Along
with a small handful of other institu
tions, Stanford maintains a policy of
"aid-blind" admissions: that is, ad
missions decisions are made without
reference to the economic circum
stances of theapplicant, and Stanford
makes a commitment to meet the full
demonstrated need of each student
it admits.
Of course, the national need for
mula under which such need is dem
onstrated is a stringent one, requir
ing a considerable stretch by the stu
dent and his or her family. Never
theless, the formula does make it
possible for student, family, and oth
er sources of aid to combine to make
it possible to attend Stanford.
Overall, about seven cents of every
tuition dollar received at here goes
into undergraduate financial aid.
This figure has been increasing
steadily over the past three years be
cause our tuition has risen faster than
the rate of growth of federal and state
financial aid programs. We have had
to fill in this difference with Stanford
dollars-
We are, nonetheless, determined
to do so. Will that be adequate? What
about the students with a large "felt
need," that is, those who barely fail
to qualify for aid under the national
need formula, or who qualify for less
aid than they believe they need?
We are sensitive to the needs of
those students, and hope to help by
providing more access to loan capital
in the face of reduced federal sup
port for loans. Fortunately, however,
it does seem that these students are
continuing to be interested in pursu
ing admission to Stanford and in
coming if accepted. Our applicant
pool has shown consistent growth in
recent years and there is no evidence
that Stanford has become less at
trctive to able students whatever
their socio-economic background.
Does this mean there is no cause
for concern? Of course it does not.
Like other private institutions which
are determined to offer broad access
to a quality education, we worry a lot
about price and choice. That is why
we watch the outcome of the ad
missions and financial aid processes
so carefully, and that is why we look
so hard for alternatives to tuition in
creases.
At this point, however, this much
seems fairly certain: although tuition
has risen more than you and we
would like it to, we have no alter
native but to permit those increases
to occur; and despite them, we have
preserved access to a Stanford educa
tion for the full range of our appli
cants.

would like it to, we have no alter
native but to permit those increases
to occur; and despite them, we have
preserved access to a Stanford educa
tion for the full range of our appli
cants.
(Donald Kennedy is the president of
the University.)
Last year, Stanford raised its tuition
13.6 percent and announced that
during the next two years tuition
would have to be moved up to an
even faster rate — about six percent
faster than inflation — if Stanford isto
continue to produce a balanced
budget and maintain the quality of its
academic programs and services.
True to these expectations, the
Long Range Financial Forecast re
leased late in Fall Quarter predicted a
tuition increase of about 15 percent.
That is a forecast, and not a budget;
but the actual number is unlikely to
differ significantly from that value.
It is natural that such decisions
raise troubled or even angry ques
tions. Why is Stanford tuition grow
ing so fast? Is it, in fact, growing faster
than that of comparable places? Is
tuition behaving differently from
other costs in our inflationary econo
my? And — perhaps most important
of all — what are we doing at Stan
ford to mitigate the effects of tuition
increases, so as to preserve access to
the University from all sectors of our
society and so retain the diversity
which we think is so important?
The simple answer, obviously, is
that Stanford's costs are rising, so we
have to charge more to support the
same level of service. Answers at that
level of specificity are never very sat
isfying, and there is a strong im
pression abroad that in fact tuition is
rising faster than comparable costs in
our economy.
In fact, that is not true. Tuition at all
selective private colleges and univer
sities is rising, on the average, at
about the same rate. Historically, it is
a rate slightly higher than the in
crease in the cost of, say, a mid-sized
automobile.
As a consequence, the costs of ser
vices tend to follow the rise in wages.
In short, universitiesare behavingac
cording to economic prediction:
they are raising prices as needed to
counteract increases in costs and to
maintain budgets in which income is
equal to expense.
But, it may be asked, do we really
have to do that? There are, after all,
alternative ways of achieving a bal
anced budget.
• First, could we find other signifi
cant sources of revenue? The answer,
unfortunately, is that we cannot. Of
the other main sources of revenue in
the Stanford operating budget, in
direct cost recovery on sponsored re
search is limited by government
agreement, and although we work
hard to increase the total of gifts for
current use, it is difficult to improve
that by very much in any particular
year. Other strategies (land develop
ment, other new kindsof investment,
and the like) are long — but not short
range ways of changing income.
• Why can't we reduce expenses?

Stanford's main expenditures are for
faculty and staff salaries. Academic
salaries in general have increased
more slowly than those in the other
professions, and we are troubled by
that. To achieve further economies
by retarding the growth in salaries
would worsen an already unfair situ
ation, and would also cause us to suf
fer losses of valuable people to other
institutions and to industry.
Since the quality of our faculty and
staff is one of Stanford's main claims
to distinction, this would be an unac
ceptable strategy. The "controllable"
(i.e. non-salary) items in the Stanford
budget were the subject of signifi
cant economies throughout most of
the early 19705, and are being pared
again in the present round of budget
planning. There is little room for
further reduction.
On the contrary, the cost of utili
ties (to take a single example) has in
creased more than 30 percent over
last year. Even with our best efforts at
conservation and reductions, the
costs of energy and certain other ex
penditure items are thus largely
beyond our control.
We could, of course, pursue a defi
cit budget strategy, but that is to seek
the mythical free lunch.
We can also ask whether Stanford's
tuition increases have been out of
line with those experienced at other
institutions. The answer is that they
have not; indeed, over the past 10
years, Stanford's increases have been
comparable to those of other institu
tions which resemble us in quality.
(In fact, in a tightly clustered group
ours have been among the lowest).
Stanford tuition has not risen un
reasonably fast, either by comparison
with that at other institutions or by
comparison with the cost of other
items in the economy.
Given that Stanford is in the grip of
the same economic circumstances
that drive similar cost increases
elsewhere, and given that these may
not be solved in the near future, it
seems likely that tuition will continue
to grow at a rate faster than inflation.
What can Stanford do to maintain its
openness to students from all socio
economic levels in this society?
This year approximately 4450 Stan
ford undergraduates (68 percent of
the undergraduate student body) re
ceive some form of financial as
sistance. Of this group roughly three
quarters qualify for aid based on
demonstrated financial need. The to
tal amount of this assistance — from
Stanford and non-Stanford sources
in 1981-82 — is $25,870,000. Of this to
tal, 1300 students qualify only for a
job or a loan, representing $9,700,000
of assistance.
In addition, 3150 students qualify
for grant and scholarship aid of
$16,170,000. Of this amount,

$10,695,000 is provided from Univer
sity funds, and $5,475,000 comes from
outside scholarship awards. Along
with a small handful of other institu
tions, Stanford maintains a policy of
"aid-blind" admissions: that is, ad
missions decisions are made without
reference to the economic circum
stances of theapplicant, and Stanford
makes a commitment to meet the full
demonstrated need of each student
it admits.
Of course, the national need for
mula under which such need is dem
onstrated is a stringent one, requir
ing a considerable stretch by the stu
dent and his or her family. Never
theless, the formula does make it
possible for student, family, and oth
er sources of aid to combine to make
it possible to attend Stanford.
Overall, about seven cents of every
tuition dollar received at here goes
into undergraduate financial aid.
This figure has been increasing
steadily over the past three years be
cause our tuition has risen faster than
the rate of growth of federal and state
financial aid programs. We have had
to fill in this difference with Stanford
dollars-
We are, nonetheless, determined
to do so. Will that be adequate? What
about the students with a large "felt
need," that is, those who barely fail
to qualify for aid under the national
need formula, or who qualify for less
aid than they believe they need?
We are sensitive to the needs of
those students, and hope to help by
providing more access to loan capital
in the face of reduced federal sup
port for loans. Fortunately, however,
it does seem that these students are
continuing to be interested in pursu
ing admission to Stanford and in
coming if accepted. Our applicant
pool has shown consistent growth in
recent years and there is no evidence
that Stanford has become less at
trctive to able students whatever
their socio-economic background.
Does this mean there is no cause
for concern? Of course it does not.
Like other private institutions which
are determined to offer broad access
to a quality education, we worry a lot
about price and choice. That is why
we watch the outcome of the ad
missions and financial aid processes
so carefully, and that is why we look
so hard for alternatives to tuition in
creases.
At this point, however, this much
seems fairly certain: although tuition
has risen more than you and we
would like it to, we have no alter
native but to permit those increases
to occur; and despite them, we have

we watch the outcome of the ad
missions and financial aid processes
so carefully, and that is why we look
so hard for alternatives to tuition in
creases.
At this point, however, this much
seems fairly certain: although tuition
has risen more than you and we
would like it to, we have no alter
native but to permit those increases
to occur; and despite them, we have
preserved access to a Stanford educa
tion for the full range of our appli
cants.

Last year, Stanford raised its tuition
13.6 percent and announced that
during the next two years tuition
would have to be moved up to an
even faster rate — about six percent
faster than inflation — if Stanford isto
continue to produce a balanced
budget and maintain the quality of its
academic programs and services.
True to these expectations, the
Long Range Financial Forecast re
leased late in Fall Quarter predicted a
tuition increase of about 15 percent.
That is a forecast, and not a budget;
but the actual number is unlikely to
differ significantly from that value.
It is natural that such decisions
raise troubled or even angry ques
tions. Why is Stanford tuition grow
ing so fast? Is it, in fact, growing faster
than that of comparable places? Is
tuition behaving differently from
other costs in our inflationary econo
my? And — perhaps most important
of all — what are we doing at Stan
ford to mitigate the effects of tuition
increases, so as to preserve access to
the University from all sectors of our
society and so retain the diversity
which we think is so important?
The simple answer, obviously, is
that Stanford's costs are rising, so we
have to charge more to support the
same level of service. Answers at that
level of specificity are never very sat
isfying, and there is a strong im
pression abroad that in fact tuition is
rising faster than comparable costs in
our economy.
In fact, that is not true. Tuition at all
selective private colleges and univer
sities is rising, on the average, at
about the same rate. Historically, it is
a rate slightly higher than the in
crease in the cost of, say, a mid-sized
automobile.
As a consequence, the costs of ser
vices tend to follow the rise in wages.
In short, universitiesare behavingac
cording to economic prediction:
they are raising prices as needed to
counteract increases in costs and to
maintain budgets in which income is
equal to expense.
But, it may be asked, do we really
have to do that? There are, after all,
alternative ways of achieving a bal
anced budget.
• First, could we find other signifi
cant sources of revenue? The answer,
unfortunately, is that we cannot. Of
the other main sources of revenue in
the Stanford operating budget, in
direct cost recovery on sponsored re
search is limited by government
agreement, and although we work
hard to increase the total of gifts for
current use, it is difficult to improve
that by very much in any particular
year. Other strategies (land develop
ment, other new kindsof investment,
and the like) are long — but not short
range ways of changing income.
• Why can't we reduce expenses?

Stanford's main expenditures are for
faculty and staff salaries. Academic
salaries in general have increased
more slowly than those in the other
professions, and we are troubled by
that. To achieve further economies
by retarding the growth in salaries
would worsen an already unfair situ
ation, and would also cause us to suf
fer losses of valuable people to other
institutions and to industry.
Since the quality of our faculty and
staff is one of Stanford's main claims
to distinction, this would be an unac
ceptable strategy. The "controllable"
(i.e. non-salary) items in the Stanford
budget were the subject of signifi
cant economies throughout most of
the early 19705, and are being pared
again in the present round of budget
planning. There is little room for
further reduction.
On the contrary, the cost of utili
ties (to take a single example) has in
creased more than 30 percent over
last year. Even with our best efforts at
conservation and reductions, the
costs of energy and certain other ex
penditure items are thus largely
beyond our control.
We could, of course, pursue a defi
cit budget strategy, but that is to seek
the mythical free lunch.
We can also ask whether Stanford's
tuition increases have been out of
line with those experienced at other
institutions. The answer is that they
have not; indeed, over the past 10
years, Stanford's increases have been
comparable to those of other institu
tions which resemble us in quality.
(In fact, in a tightly clustered group
ours have been among the lowest).
Stanford tuition has not risen un
reasonably fast, either by comparison
with that at other institutions or by
comparison with the cost of other
items in the economy.
Given that Stanford is in the grip of
the same economic circumstances
that drive similar cost increases
elsewhere, and given that these may
not be solved in the near future, it
seems likely that tuition will continue
to grow at a rate faster than inflation.
What can Stanford do to maintain its
openness to students from all socio
economic levels in this society?
This year approximately 4450 Stan
ford undergraduates (68 percent of
the undergraduate student body) re
ceive some form of financial as
sistance. Of this group roughly three
quarters qualify for aid based on
demonstrated financial need. The to
tal amount of this assistance — from
Stanford and non-Stanford sources
in 1981-82 — is $25,870,000. Of this to
tal, 1300 students qualify only for a
job or a loan, representing $9,700,000
of assistance.
In addition, 3150 students qualify
for grant and scholarship aid of
$16,170,000. Of this amount,

$10,695,000 is provided from Univer
sity funds, and $5,475,000 comes from
outside scholarship awards. Along
with a small handful of other institu
tions, Stanford maintains a policy of
"aid-blind" admissions: that is, ad
missions decisions are made without
reference to the economic circum
stances of theapplicant, and Stanford
makes a commitment to meet the full
demonstrated need of each student
it admits.
Of course, the national need for
mula under which such need is dem
onstrated is a stringent one, requir
ing a considerable stretch by the stu
dent and his or her family. Never
theless, the formula does make it
possible for student, family, and oth
er sources of aid to combine to make
it possible to attend Stanford.
Overall, about seven cents of every
tuition dollar received at here goes
into undergraduate financial aid.
This figure has been increasing
steadily over the past three years be
cause our tuition has risen faster than
the rate of growth of federal and state
financial aid programs. We have had
to fill in this difference with Stanford
dollars-
We are, nonetheless, determined
to do so. Will that be adequate? What
about the students with a large "felt
need," that is, those who barely fail
to qualify for aid under the national
need formula, or who qualify for less
aid than they believe they need?
We are sensitive to the needs of
those students, and hope to help by
providing more access to loan capital
in the face of reduced federal sup
port for loans. Fortunately, however,
it does seem that these students are
continuing to be interested in pursu
ing admission to Stanford and in
coming if accepted. Our applicant
pool has shown consistent growth in
recent years and there is no evidence
that Stanford has become less at
trctive to able students whatever
their socio-economic background.
Does this mean there is no cause
for concern? Of course it does not.
Like other private institutions which
are determined to offer broad access
to a quality education, we worry a lot
about price and choice. That is why
we watch the outcome of the ad
missions and financial aid processes
so carefully, and that is why we look
so hard for alternatives to tuition in
creases.
At this point, however, this much
seems fairly certain: although tuition
has risen more than you and we
would like it to, we have no alter
native but to permit those increases
to occur; and despite them, we have
preserved access to a Stanford educa
tion for the full range of our appli
cants.
