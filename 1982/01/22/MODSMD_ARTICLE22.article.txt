## Hoover does represent 'diversified spectrum' 
### 
Recent comments from two department pro
fessors in political science and a well-intentioned
undergraduate have publicized an important is
sue: What should be the role of the Hoover Institu
tion at Stanford? I see the current controversy as
the result of irresponsible journalism, professional
sour grapes, and imprudent student appraisal.
Seymour Martin Lipset correctly pinpointed ir
responsible journalism as a problem in a letter
printed recently (Daily, Dec. 9). Though, as Lipset
noted, Hoover fellows are more conservative, on
the average, than other groups of social scientists,
they still represent a more diversified ideological
spectrum than any other similar institution in the
country.
The press, however, including the Daily, has
continually nurtured the distortion of Hoover's ac
tual ideological make-up. Perhaps journalists
should actually research the political beliefs of
Hoover scholars before brandishing such catchy
titles as "the conservative think tank."
Though conservatives have the limelight now,
there are also notable numbers of moderates, lib
erals, and socialists at Hoover. In 1981-82, conser

vatives are attracting the attention, but in 1977-78,
moderates and liberals produced similar volumes
of scholarship to aid the Jimmy Carter presidency.
Liberals should be willing to respect the current
scholarship just as conservatives have respected
liberal scholarship in the past.
The complaints from certain political science
and history professors concerning Hoover's cur
rent conservative bent are, in my opinion, a bit sus
pect. Considering that at at least two professors
who are voicing opposition to Hoover's conserva
tive stance were once denied Hoover fellowships,
one must wonder whether such opposition is little
more than sour grapes.
Hoover's critics have sought to form the debate
around non-pertinent issues. First, they have
argued that Hoover should not be the political
voice of the University. Such a contention can be
agreed to by even the most ardent Hoover conser
vative. Hoover is not, nor has ever claimed to be,
Stanford's political voice.
Second, the critics have asserted that Hoover's
scholarship should remain free of political bias if it
is to be regarded as a "distinguished" institution.

But no one in the social sciences conducts research
except through the lens of his/her own bias.
In the past, liberal academics have consistently
belittled conservative complaints that most aca
demic research is conducted within the
framework of liberal political beliefs. To chastise
Hoover for its current conservative leanings, and
to argue for removing University financial support
would be similar to promoting the disenfranchise
ment of the sociology, philosophy, or political sci
ence department for representing "liberal" views
in books and articles.
Is such an analogy plausible? Certainly. Each
University entity has a role to fill. Hoover's role is
public and policy-oriented. As such, it naturally
draws fire.
It is the quality of Hoover's scholarship, not the
particular bias evident in a given political term; the
achievements of its scholars, not professional sour
grapes; and well-considered student opinions, not
off-the-cuff analyses which should form the foun
dation for objective appraisal Hoover's role here.
