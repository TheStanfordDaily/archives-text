# Rape victim treatment improved at Stanford
## 
### Anthea Stratigos 
Many women are hesitant about reporting a
rape, for fear of judgment by those from whom
they're seeking help. But changes have been
made at the Stanford University Medical Center
and in the surrounding Palo Alto/Stanford com
munity to encourage victims to obtain pro
fessional care.
In the past 10 years, recognition that the rape
victim has undergone an emotional as well as
physical trauma has set a precedent for the treat
ment she will receive.
Pat Taylor, R.N., assistant director of emer
gency services at the hospital, says the staff has
realized there is more than just medicine to
treating victims. Callous judgemental
statements of "she asked for it" or "look how
she was dressed," are no longer verbalized, she
said.
A rape victim in the Stanford community has a
number of options when seeking help.
Dr. James McClenahan, director of Cowell
Student Health Center says that women are wel
comed and encouraged to use the Center's ser
vices. Emotional counseling, provided by wom
en volunteers, is available as well as medical
treatment by trained professionals. Complete
medical and follow-up care is offered by the
center.
Taylor said the victim may choose where she
would like to seek help, though institutions are
required to report the crime. Sergeant Ron
Louie of the Palo Alto Police Department,
Marvin Moore, Stanford police field service cap
tain, McClenahan and Taylor all stressed the
greater facilities for treatment at the Med Cen
ter, where there are private rooms and nurses to
aid with patient examinations.
Also, because of their broader encounters
with rape victims, the staff is better equipped to
collect evidence. All four organizations work in
conjunction with one another whenever pos
sible in dealing with sexual assault cases.
Palo Alto and Stanford police officers have re
ceived extensive training for sexual assault vic
tims. Although female officers handle cases
whenever possible, Taylor says the police have
become so good in handling these situations
that women are beginning to realize that men
can be equally supportive.
In 1975 the Palo Alto Police Department re
ceived a grant to study rape, making them fore
runners in the field. They then worked with
health professionals, especially in dealing with
the emotions of victims and in making it as com
fortable as possible to obtain proper evidence.
Attitudes of the police have changed greatly.

According to Louie, the department will not to
lerate judgments by an officer showing his prej
udices.
Stanford officers are also supportive, helping
victims regain composure and begin talking of
the trauma. This often leads to case develop
ment and can improve an investigation, accord
ing to Moore.
At the Med Center itself, attitudes and sensi
tivity toward victims have been the greatest
change, according to Taylor. She believes that a
whole national movement for human and wom
en's rights has had the greatest effect toward
bringing on these changes.
The written Stanford University Hospital
Emergency Department Rape Protocol lists spe
cific instructions for the treatment of rape vic
tims. "At all times it is our function NOT to be
moralistic," it reads. Throughout, it emphasizes
the need for reassurance and comfort of the pa
tient.
Cases cannot be discussed with anyone
without specific victim consent, according to the
protocol. Nurses stay with the victim throughout
the hospital experience and the victim will be
able to talk as she wishes.
A social history of the assault is taken by nurse
and/or doctor. If the doctor is not present, the
history is presented in consultation. "Don't ask
victim to repeat the history," the protocol in
structs.
The staff does not delve into the past sexual
history of the victim except to ask if she is on
birth control pills. This is solely to establish if the
possibility of pregnancy is present, according to
Taylor.
The Emergency Department, upon comple
tion of treatment, arranges for an escort home if
needed, as well as for temporary housing and
clothing. Take-home information is given to vic
tims, even if they feel they don't need it. In this
way, they'll have information available, if and
when they are faced with trauma days later.
All departments said they believe that more
women are reporting rapes, but no one can say
for sure whether this is the sole reason for the
statistical increase of rapes.
"I am well satisfied with the way both sides
have responded to the needs of the victim," said
Louie in reference to health and law enforce
ment officials.
It is believed by many local professionals that
any victim of rape in the Stanford community
can expect an atmosphere of encouragement,
moral support and warmth when seeking help
after a rape assault.
