# Kennedy testifies against small business development act
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Hailed by its proponents as a vehicle to
stimulate innovation within the small busi
ness community, the Small Business Innova
tion Development Act, HR 4236, has drawn
strong criticism from universities na
tionwide, which view the law as another
throat to their already scaled down research
budgets.
University President Donald Kennedy ex
pressed his opposition to the bill last Mon
day at a House Ways and Means Committee
in Sacramento and is scheduled to testify in
Washington D.C. against the bill in front of
the House Committee on Science and Tech
nology next week.
HR 4236 requires that three percent of fed
eral agency research and devlopment
budgets over $100 million be set aside in
each agency to fund research and develop
ment projects for small businesses in a Small
Business Innovation Research program
(SBIR).
So far the bill has enjoyed overwhelming
support in Congress where it passed the Sen
ate in a rare 90-0 vote and gained the ap
proval of the House Committe on Small Busi
nesses in another unprecedented unani
mous vote.
Part of the reason for the bill's success was

because of the absence of any organized op
position and because of small business's fa
vored position in Washington according to
Larry Horton, director of government rela
tions in the Office of Public Affairs here.
"Now the opposition is more or
ganized,"said Horton, who added that the
University did not hear about the bill until
November, a few weeks before it was passed
by the Senate.
Don Dubane, aide to Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-San Mateo),saidthatanytime
a bill passes with that large a margin "nobody
has taken a look at it.
"When you have a bill supported by small
business groups, Congress tends to go along
with it without much scrutiny," said Dubane.
"Any guy who votes against small business
sticks his neck under the chopping block,"
he added.
Dubane said that he is "fairly certain" that
McCloskey will oppose the bill.
The University first voiced his opposition
to the bill as early as December 11 when Ken
nedy joined three other California university
presidents in criticizing the bill in a letter
sent to the bill's sponsor.
According to Horton, the University ob
jects to the law because it will change the
purpose of research and development funds
and because it is a reallocation of funds

which has not been obtained through the
proper procedure.
"It's a reappropriation without the ap
proval of any authorization or appropriation
committee," said Horton.
Horton said that the bill is written in a way
that skirts the legislative process bcause the
allocation of funds for SBIR would not be
listed on the budget.
Instead, legislators would approve a re
search budget and not have any control over
how closely that budget is followed because,
according to Horton, the individual agencies
would have discretion to take the three per
cent set aside from any part of the budget.
Since the money does not have to result
from an across-the-board cut, Horton said
the University fears that the three percent
taken from research and development will
come disproportionately from basic re
search.
Basic research, which is defined by the
University as research into the nature of fun
damental processes which is not conducted
with a commercial application in mind, rep
resents only a small fraction of the research
and development budget, said Horton.
Out of a total research and development
budget of $40 billion, Horton said that half of
that is in the Department of Defense (DOD)
and out of that total only $700 million is al

located tor basic research.
"DOD could elect to set aside up to $600
million of the basic research budget in order
to fund the SBIR," Kennedy said in his testi
mony on Monday.
Norton said he doubted that all of the
money would be taken from basic research
but said that in the context of federal budg
etary cuts which have decreased non-de
fense research by 16 percent, any further
budget cuts would severely hurt the Univer
sity.
"The DOD is not going to take away funds
from applied national defense research
projects such as the MX and the Stealth,"
Horton said."So the fund may cut basic re
search as much as 10 percent."
However, in a letter to Kennedy, one of
the bill's sponsors, Rep. )ohn Lafalce (D-
N.V.), cited studies which showed that there
are enough funds within the federal agen
cies involved so that none of the money trad
itionally used to fund university or medical
school research would have to be trans
ferred to the SBIR programs.
"If that is true why did they specifically say
that no programs would be protected?"
asked Horton.
Cuts in basic research will reduce the
number of graduate students at the Univer
sity and will particularly hurt high-energy

physics programs such as the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SLAC), said Norton.
The fixed costs of operating SLAC are so
high, according to Morton, that any one per
cent reduction in funding represents a three
and a half percent reduction in productivity.
Basic research, including high-energy
physics, is almost exclusively federally
funded, which means, according to Horton,
that funding losses from the federal govern
ment will not be made up from other
sources.
Another concern expressed by the Uni
versity in objection to the bill is that funds
taken away from basic research programs
will not be channelled into small businesses
to do the same research; rather they will be
devoted to a new purpose.
According to Lafalce and the other spon
sors, the bill has the strong support of the
business community and has been endorsed
by such groups as the National Small Busi
ness Association ar\d the Federation of Inde
pendent Businesss.
However,the American Electronic As
sociation (AEA), with 72 percent of its mem
bership composed of small businesses, has
come out against the measure.
"The AEA would be benefitted by it. The
only reason they're opposing it is be
cause they think it's a lousy device,"
Dubane said. "When the AEA says
they don't need it something is
screwy," he added.
Dubane said that it would be better
to eliminate the encumbrances in the
procurement process that prevent
small businesses from getting in
volved with the federal government
than to set up a new fund.
The Reagan administration which
initially opposed the bill hasreversed
its stance for political reasons, ac

cording to Horton, and now favors
the bill.The reason behind the re
' versal, according to Dubane, was to
; gain a vote for the sale of the Air
; Warning and Control Systems
(AWACS) to Saudi Arabia, which suc
cessfully passed the Senate last fall.
Dubane said that in exchange for a
yes vote on the AWACS vote last fall
( from Warren Redland (R-N.H.), one
of bill's important sponsors, the Rea
* gan administraion switched its posi
tion.
i The administration's support for
j the bill, however, is not strong,
- Dubane said.
