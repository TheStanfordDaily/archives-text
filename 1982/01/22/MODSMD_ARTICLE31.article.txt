# Tight-money bonus angers employee
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Chicago — An office of the government
agency responsible for maintaining the so
called "safety net" of social programs for
the needy found it had a small budget sur
plus when the fiscal year ended last fall —
so it gave thousands of dollars in salary
bonuses to employees, including some
who make as much as $50,000 a year.
The Midwest regional office of the De
partment of Health and Human Services
handed out $28,000 to 48 employees — but
one of them was more outraged than
grateful.
The bonuses were paid in the face of
such severe fiscal austerity that drastic ser
vice cutbacks have been forced on the
agency along with heavy employee layoffs,
and Tom Dodson, a career bureaucrat,
simply refused to accept his bonus check
for $1000.
He returned it, protesting that the bonus
was an improper use of taxpayer money
under the circumstances. Dodson's rejec
tion startled the officials who gave him the
bonus.
"We thought he was thrilled, like ev
erybody else," said Wayne Stanton, the
agency's regional director and former
head of the Indiana state welfare depart
ment until President Ronald Reagan ap

pointed him to head the six-state regional
office last August.
Dodson, head of personnel in the agen
cy's Chicago office, has been on the front
line of the Reagan administration-ordered
budget-cutting that has trimmed agency
services and jobs.
Although he declined to be interviewed
and his letter of protest has not been made

The bonuses were paid in
the face of such severe
fiscal austerity that drastic
service cut hacks have been
forced on the agency along
with heavy employee
layoffs.

public, the /.os Angeles Times has learned
that Dodson objected to being reimbursed
for his role in putting people out of jobs,
and was critical of bonuses at a time of ser
vice cuts to the poor.
But Stanton and health and human ser
vices officials in Washington defended the
awards and said they have been given rou
tinely over the years.
"Our people are working harder than

ever before," Stanton said. "We've vir
tually eliminated overtime. We've left job
openings vacant ... It ends up people are
working longer and harder. This was one
way to recognize the efforts of our out
standing employees. It's good for morale."
In Washington, where an internal in
quiry by agency personnel investigators is
under way, a spokesman for Health and
Human Services Secretary Richard
Schweiker said the money spent on
bonuses is money saved through efficient
management. He said the funds come out
of budget savings from unspent salaries
and travel expenses, for example — not
from social program cutbacks.
"We call it 'lapse money,' " said Herbert
Fowler, an agency spokesman in the capi
tal. "That's money left over in the budget
because of good management."
Stanton said the rest of the bonuses
ranged from $100 to $750 and went to a
broad range of employees — from top
management people to clerk typists. He
said he plans to repeat the bonus awards
next year.
Not all of the budget leftover was spent
on bonuses. Stanton said about $12,000
was returned to the federal Treasury.
"No, it won't affect the national debt
much," he said.
