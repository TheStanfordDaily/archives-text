# Reagan's plan may be backfiring

New York — Can success in
one area cause problems in an
other? It might, if you're talk
ing about President Ronald
Reagan's economic program.
One of his obvious successes
has been in spreading the word
about the dangersof overspen
ding. People listened, and have
been cutting back on
purchases and raising their sav
ings rate over the past few
months.
High interest rates also have
played a big role in discourag

ing people from buying, but
there seems little doubt either
that Reagan's ideas on govern
ment budgets have been ap
plied to household budgets
too.
And perhaps to corporate
matters as well. Recent govern
ment reports indicate no surge
in capital spending this year in
spite of tax incentives aimed at
stimulating such investments.
And that means, of course, a
setback of Reagan's hopes to

make industry more produc
tive.
As seen by Richrd Nen
neman, investment strategist
for the Girard Bank trust de
partment, Reagan's goals indi
vidually and eventually are
achievable. But, he observed,
"it seems fairly clear that . . .
the pieces do not add up to a
coherent whole within the
same time frame."
Otherobservers feel, despite
a widely publicized tax cut, tax
es might still be rising, said

Martin Lefkowitz of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce. By his
reckoning, "Federal tax reven
ues for the first two months fol
lowing the 5 percent tax reduc
tion are running 15 percent
abovethe levelsa yearearlier."
He explained: "October's
personal income tax cut was
not great enough to wipe out
the 'inflation profit' that the
federal government 'earns' as
inflation pushes individuals
into higher tax brackets."
