## Card looking for 2nd Pac-10 trump Cagers face UCLA,USC 
### Stephen John Odell 
A lot of things have changed
since the last time UCLA played
the Stanford basketball team at
Maples Pavilion. Last year, the
Cardinal came up with their
best effort of the year and de
feated the then sixth-ranked
Bruins, 74-72.
Guard Keith Jones was in
strumental in the upset, hitting
on nine-of-10 shots from the
floor and five-of-six from the
line to lead the Cardinal in
scoring with 23 points, and he
also picked up four assists and
three steals.
The other key role was
played by forward Hans
Wichary, who had 14 points
and blocked a Rod Foster jump
shot with eight seconds re
maining to preserve the victory
for Stanford and send the near
capacity Maples Pavilion
crowd into a frenzy.
A lotofthings have changed.
The most important of those
changes is that Jones and
Wichary will not be playing for
Stanford tonight against UCLA
at 8 p.m., nor the next after
noon against USC. In fact, they
will not play again all year.
Jones, who was ruled aca
demically ineligible Jan. 2, was
unsuccessful in appealing the
verdict this week. And Wichary
is, for all intents and purposes,
gone for the season due to a
foot stress fracture. He will
redshirt, while Jones will sim

ply lose a year of eligibility.
Which, with two conference
champion contenders coming
to town, makes the task of Card
coach Dick Dißiaso, one of ad
justment."We have to now be
much more conscious of game
tempo," he said. "We don't
have the depth that we thought
we had at the beginning of the
season. A game is not to our ad
vantage anymore if it gets up in
the 70s or the '80s."
And this is precisely the kind
of game plan that both USC
and UCLA will try to imple
ment this weekend, for three
reasons.
•Both USC and UCLA like to
run anyway and are very quick,
while Wichary, the quickest
forward for Stanford, and
Jones, the quickest Card guard
will not play.

•Stanford no longer has the
depth they once had, which
means a fast tempo game will
both tire the Cardinal out and
put them into a troublesome
foul situation.
•Saturday's game against
USC is scheduled for 12:30
p.m., roughly 15 hours after
Stanford gets done battling the
Bruins. The Cardinal will have
to be feeling the effects.
"Both teams present quite a
few problems for you," ad
mitted Dißiaso. "Both play a
tough fullcourt defense and
they both approach the game
the same way — run, gun, and
have fun.
"We, on the other hand will
have to have good shot selec
tion and play good defense in
order to win. And we cannot
let the games get out of hand."


ALL YOU NEED IS SPEED - To beat UCLA that is. The Card
had it a year ago m guard Keith Jones, shown here dribbl
,ng past the Bruins 'Rocket' Rod Foster during last sea
son's 74-72 upset of UCLA in Maples Pavilion. Jones, who

academically ineligible. The game will pass-in at 8 p.m.
