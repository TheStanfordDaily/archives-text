# Cagewomen pounce on Pacific
## 
### Sarah Carrel 
The Stanford women's
basketball team glided to an
easy 73-57 victory at the Uni
versity of Pacific Tuesday night.
Stanford took the lead early
and dominated throughout the
game, with everyone playing
well and contributing to the
lopsided score.
Outstanding individual play
came from senior center Lou
ise Smith, who was the high
scorer with 21 points. Smith
also pulled down eight re
bounds, another high for the

evening, despite sitting out for
a good deal of the game.
Another fine performance
came from Mary Bradach, a
promising freshman from
Frankfort, Germany. Bradach
started in her first game at Pa-
cific, scoring an admirable 10
points and tagging six re-
bounds.
The victory leaves the
Cardinal with a fine 12-5 record
overall and a 2-1 count in
Northern California Athletic
Conference play.
All in all, head coach Dotty
McCrea was quite pleased with

her team's performance
against UOP and with the tal
ent her younger players dis
played in particular. She
viewed the game as "a good
warm-up for San Jose," she
said.
The San Jose State Spartans
come to Maples Pavilion
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. to pro
vide the Cardinal women with
a tougher opponent than UOP.
The Spartans have an overall
mark of 10-7, placing them in a
tie with the University of Cali
fornia for the top spot in the
NorCal Conference. They are

known for their fast-moving
and high-pressure offensive
game, which will provide a
challenge for Stanford's stub
born defense.
This should provide a well
matched game and McCrea is
aware that her team will have
to play hard and well for a vic
tory. Nevertheless, the coach
has plenty of confidence in her
team's ability, remarking that
in her six years of coaching
Cardinal basketball, the
1981-82 team is "the best team
I've ever had at Stanford."
