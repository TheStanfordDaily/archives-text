# Walsh waltzes to a drumbeat of his own
## 
### 
fiom the Daily wire services
Pontiac, Mich. — It was con
sidered a revolutionary move
at the time, but then in just two
seasons, Bill Walsh already was
established as a gent who pre
ferred his own drumbeat.
Walsh's Folly was staged at
the last collegiate livestock
auction, when NFLscoutsstand
at attention, place hands over
hearts and recite the pledge or
iginating in the sainted Dallas
Cowboy credo: "When thy
time so cometh, picketh ye the
best athlete available."
This has become the ac
cepted pattern, since the Cow
boy drafting system has been
installed in the Hall of Fame.
Regardless of your team
weakness at the moment, you
choose the most talented ath
lete still on the board, no mat
ter which position he plays. In
theory, a team could wind up
choosing nine wide receivers,
even though it has two all-pro
catchers already on the roster
and Butch Johnson in the hole.
Walsh broke the mold. In es
sence, he said to hell with that
noise. His San Francisco secon
dary was in tatters, so he picked
defensive backs until his col
leagues glanced at each other,
raised forefingers to temples
and rotated them in small
circles. Four of Walsh's first five
draft choices he spent on col

lege defensive backs, including
the first three: Ronnie Lott of
Southern Cal, Eric Wright of
Missouri, Carlton Williamson
of Pittsburgh. In the fifth
round, the 49er coach named
Lynn Thomas, a cornerback
from Pittsburgh.
"No, I've never heard of any
body doing that before," he
says now.
The odds are high against
any rookie earning starting sta
tus in the secondary, the most
pressurized locale in defense.
You can hide a raw defensive
lineman and perhaps even a
linebacker. But a cornerback
or safety is naked on a down
town streetcorner at high
noon. The odds against two
first-year men making the start
ing secondary are roughly the
same as Miss Sophia Loren
making an obscene phone call
to me within the next 15
minutes. Tom Landry was
forced to start two rookies in
the Dallas secondary this past
season and worried so much,
his hair fell out.
But the odds against three?
Las Vegas would close its books
and become a monastery.
Yet this is exactly what High-
Roller Walsh did. He took Lott,
Wright and Williamson and
wrapped them around a one
year veteran he salvaged from a
junk heap, and threw them to
the wolves. Opposing quarter

backs read the lineup and
drooled like a beagle in a
sausage factory. Usually just
one rookie in a secondary
causes a passer to collapse with
the giggles, butthree? He had a
smorgasbord.
What Walsh had in mind was
installation of new techniques
in secondary play, changing
stances, varying depths,
teaching feints.
"I think the coach figured
you can't teach an old dog new
tricks," said Dwight Hicks, the
junk heap survivor, "so he
went out and got new dogs. I
guess he thought it was best to
start out fresh with guys who
didn't have old habits."
"They just let us get in the
water," said Lott. "If we took a
dive, we'd just take a dive. But
sooner or later, we'd be able to
breathe."
Hicks was lounging around
San Francisco when he heard
of the draft. Generally, you
would think a safety (even if he
had a Michigan background)
would feel job security twinges
when he learned of all the hot
shots drafted in his line of
work. After all, fie had flunked
tryouts at Philadelphia and De
troit and served a short term in
Canadian football. At the time
Walsh summoned him to uni
form two years ago, he was
managing a health food store

in Michigan.
"Well, I didn't worry about
the draft because I knew I was
going to be there. It was just a
question of where I was going
to play. But I was a little skep
tical about these guys. I knew
anybody drafted that high was
going to start and they would
be under a lot of pressure. But
when I saw them at our mini
camp, all my doubt was wiped
away. When I saw the way they
moved and reacted, I knew
they could play. You can usual
ly tell."
Indeed, the fuzzcheeks are
now hailed as the coming at
traction in Superbowl XVI and
perhaps several other Super
bowls to come. Despite their
inexperience, they intercepted
27 passes, fourth highest in the
league. When you add the re
covered fumbles in there, the
49ers led the circuit in turn
overs gained.
The secondary has been
tabbed "Dwight Hicks and His
Hot Licks."
Of course, the supreme test
is just ahead. Hicks and His Hot
Licks will face "possibly the
greatest football player today
in the league," according to
Walsh. This is his accolade for
Cincinnati passer Ken An
derson, whom Walsh de
veloped when he was a Bengal
assistant.

lete still on the board, no mat
ter which position he plays. In
theory, a team could wind up
choosing nine wide receivers,
even though it has two all-pro
catchers already on the roster
and Butch Johnson in the hole.
Walsh broke the mold. In es
sence, he said to hell with that
noise. His San Francisco secon
dary was in tatters, so he picked
defensive backs until his col
leagues glanced at each other,
raised forefingers to temples
and rotated them in small
circles. Four of Walsh's first five
draft choices he spent on col

lege defensive backs, including
the first three: Ronnie Lott of
Southern Cal, Eric Wright of
Missouri, Carlton Williamson
of Pittsburgh. In the fifth
round, the 49er coach named
Lynn Thomas, a cornerback
from Pittsburgh.
"No, I've never heard of any
body doing that before," he
says now.
The odds are high against
any rookie earning starting sta
tus in the secondary, the most
pressurized locale in defense.
You can hide a raw defensive
lineman and perhaps even a
linebacker. But a cornerback
or safety is naked on a down
town streetcorner at high
noon. The odds against two
first-year men making the start
ing secondary are roughly the
same as Miss Sophia Loren
making an obscene phone call
to me within the next 15
minutes. Tom Landry was
forced to start two rookies in
the Dallas secondary this past
season and worried so much,
his hair fell out.
But the odds against three?
Las Vegas would close its books
and become a monastery.
Yet this is exactly what High-
Roller Walsh did. He took Lott,
Wright and Williamson and
wrapped them around a one
year veteran he salvaged from a
junk heap, and threw them to
the wolves. Opposing quarter

backs read the lineup and
drooled like a beagle in a
sausage factory. Usually just
one rookie in a secondary
causes a passer to collapse with
the giggles, butthree? He had a
smorgasbord.
What Walsh had in mind was
installation of new techniques
in secondary play, changing
stances, varying depths,
teaching feints.
"I think the coach figured
you can't teach an old dog new
tricks," said Dwight Hicks, the
junk heap survivor, "so he
went out and got new dogs. I
guess he thought it was best to
start out fresh with guys who
didn't have old habits."
"They just let us get in the
water," said Lott. "If we took a
dive, we'd just take a dive. But
sooner or later, we'd be able to
breathe."
Hicks was lounging around
San Francisco when he heard
of the draft. Generally, you
would think a safety (even if he
had a Michigan background)
would feel job security twinges
when he learned of all the hot
shots drafted in his line of
work. After all, fie had flunked
tryouts at Philadelphia and De
troit and served a short term in
Canadian football. At the time
Walsh summoned him to uni
form two years ago, he was
managing a health food store

in Michigan.
"Well, I didn't worry about
the draft because I knew I was
going to be there. It was just a
question of where I was going
to play. But I was a little skep
tical about these guys. I knew
anybody drafted that high was
going to start and they would
be under a lot of pressure. But
when I saw them at our mini
camp, all my doubt was wiped
away. When I saw the way they
moved and reacted, I knew
they could play. You can usual
ly tell."
Indeed, the fuzzcheeks are
now hailed as the coming at
traction in Superbowl XVI and
perhaps several other Super
bowls to come. Despite their
inexperience, they intercepted
27 passes, fourth highest in the
league. When you add the re
covered fumbles in there, the
49ers led the circuit in turn
overs gained.
The secondary has been
tabbed "Dwight Hicks and His
Hot Licks."
Of course, the supreme test
is just ahead. Hicks and His Hot
Licks will face "possibly the
greatest football player today
in the league," according to
Walsh. This is his accolade for
Cincinnati passer Ken An
derson, whom Walsh de
veloped when he was a Bengal
assistant.
