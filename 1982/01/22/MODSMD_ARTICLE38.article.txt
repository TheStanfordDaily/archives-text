## Kosnac picks Niners

If the San Francisco 49ers can wait until
Monday to fall hopelessly — and deservedly
in love with themselves, with their cham
pionship season and with that stunning 28-27
victory over Dallas 12 days ago, then they will
leave the. Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich, on
Sunday night with a whole bunch of Super
Bowl rings to pass out.
If, however, the 49ers start celebrating
themselves earlier, look out. Cincinnati quar
terback Kenny Anderson will start throwing
the touchdown passes, the Bengals will turn
Super Hype XVI into a spectacle in stripes,
and the 49ers will return home to screaming
"WHAT HAPPENED?" headlines in Monday
morning's Chronicle.
Destiny's Darlings to Detroit's Duds? No
more comparisons to the 1969 New York
Mets? Surely this all can't come to pass?!
And it won't. "I just can't believe we'll play
a poor game," Niner coach Bill Walsh told the
teeming media earlier this week. I agree with
him. For the record, I like San Francisco by six
points. The bookies say it's the49ers by a field
goal. Interestingly enough, 15 of 21 NFL
coaches polled like the Bengals — by the av
erage spread of five points.
But why? The 49ers have won 15 of their 18
games this season, and have been the best
team in the sport since October. San Francis
co executes coach Walsh's intricate ball-con
trol passing game with peerless consistency
and finesse, hits ferociously on defense, and
turns opponents' turnovers into points with
championship regularity.
On Dec. 6 in the Bengals' own Riverfront
Stadium, the 49ers gave Cincinnati a preview
of what is to come on Sunday. The Niners
crunched the Bengals 21-3 that day. An
nihilated them. Savage sticking caused four
Cincy fumbles (three of which the 49ers re
covered) and three Bengal interceptions. A
furious pass rush drove Ken Anderson to his
knees, and eventually to the bench with an in
jury. San Francisco quarterback Joe Montana
ran for one score and passed for two others. It
couldn't have been much easier for the 49ers.
Sunday's contest should be tighter. The
Bengals move the ball well both on the
ground (with the bull-elephant backfield of
Pete Johnson and Charles Alexander) and in
the air (Anderson's receiving corps — includ
ing veteran burner Isaac Curtis and rookie
flash Cris Collinsworth — is as good as there
is) and defend it smartly as well. The 49ers
caught Cincinnati fat and complacent the first

lime around; it won't happen again.
So what will happen on Sunday? Well, for
one thing, the 49ers will score points. Lots of
them. Montana, wide receiver Dwight Clark,
and flanker Freddie Solomon are a prize
threesome and Walsh's neatly disguised
rushing attack continually gets the most out
of the least. Upfront — where all these games
are really decided anyhow — San Francisco
has heen consistently superb.
Playoff victims New York and Dallas each
brought hot-shot defenses into Candlestick
Park and each got shelled (the Giants giving
up 38 points, the Cowboys 28). Is there any
reason to believe that the Bengals will do
considerably better? Not really.
Thus the key to Supe XVI is the Bengal of
fense. Can Anderson and company score
enough points to keep Cincy in contention?
The Bengal backs are big but slow. Johnson
and Alexander are perfect for a ball-control
attack, but the AFC champs won't win a ball
control game against the 49ers. Instead, they
must get the youthful Niners in a hole and
then let the big-game pressure take its toll.
The 49er secondary — so strong in the regu
lar season — has had its rough moments in
the post-season. The Giants' Scott Brunner,
hardly a fancy passer, tortured the Niners for
281 yards, including touchdown strikes of 59
and 72-yards. Against Dallas, rookie killer
Ronnie Lott was twice flagged for pass in
terference, all but handing Dallas 10 points
himself.
Forrest Gregg's Bengals are 14-4 this year.
They are a good, tough team. They also enter
their biggest game with history firmly on their
side. AFC teams have won eight of the last
nine Super Bowls — the average margin of
victory, an eye-opening 11 points.
Much is being made this week about the
49ers lack of depth (especially at quarterback
where Guy Benjamin is the backup) and over
all inexperience, particularly in the secon
dary. Nonetheless, Anderson is far more in
jury-prone than Montana, and Cincy's
backup Jack Thompson is nothing special. If
the 49ers are green then they certainly
haven't played that way. Experience can be
overrated anyhow.
The feeling here is that if the Niners were
going to fold up they would have done so
against Dallas. They were given ample op
portunity. Against the Cowboys, the 49ers
committed six turnovers and still won. They
have the right stuff, as Cincinnati will find out
Sunday.
