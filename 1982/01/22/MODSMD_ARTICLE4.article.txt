# Members being trained
## Draft boards would review deferments 
### Kathy Olmsted 
Statewide, 187 draft boards which would con
sider exemptions if the draft is reinstated have
been established.
The draft boards have been formed so that they
will be prepared in case the draft is reinstated, ac
cording to Col. John Abrahamson, Selective Ser
vice regional manager.
If the boards are activated, their function will not
be to actually conscript individuals but to review
requests for hardship and conscientious objection
deferments from military service.
Although Abrahamson said he was certain the
draft boards would not be activated "short of a na
tional emergency," Matt Nicodemus of Stanford
Against Conscription said he saw the formation of
the boards as "one more sign that registration is
not just registration but the draft being broug t
back step by step.
"Reagan used the Polish crisis as an excuse for
registration," he said. "It's very possible that he
could use some other crisis in the world as an ex

cuse to go to a full-scale draft."
Joel Pomerantz of the Central Committee of
Conscientious Objectors, based in San Francisco,
said he believed the selection of draft board mem
bers was a prelude to the reinstatement of the
draft. "There's no point in having draft boards
without having a draft," he said. The draft would
probably be activated during the summer, he said,
so college students wouldn't have the opportunity
to organize.
Beginning in April, draft board members will be
required to complete a 12-hour training program.
Abrahamson stressed that these individuals are
only being "trained to be maintained" in the event
that they are necessary.
Abrahamson said the members volunteered
their services directly to the Selective Service or
submitted their names through various civic or
ganizations. The Selective Service screened the ap
proximately 4000 applicants in California to de
termine that they were adult Americans who lived
within the required jurisdictional boundaries and
were not members of the armed forces.

After their eligibility was ascertained, the volun
teers were interviewed by Selective Service panels.
On the basisof those interviews, the panels recom
mended potential draft board members to the
state director of the Selective Service who then
drew up a list of nominees for the governor. The
governor then nominated the members to the
president, who formally appointed them.
Abrahamson said the Selective Service con
sidered the "full demographics of the various
areas" in order to attain draft board members who
accurately represented the population of their re
gions. Hesaidtheinterviewsandapplication forms
of the volunteers were scrutinized to determine
that they were "free from bias."
Pomerantz said his organization is dissatisfied
with the selection process because the panel
members were reserve military personnel. He said
the Selective Service only instructed the panels to
encourage what he called "token" minority repre
sentation on the draft boards and otherwise gave
no definite guidelines.
