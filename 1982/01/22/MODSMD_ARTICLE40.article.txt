I Me Mine
By George Harrison
Simon & Schuster
$12.95, 398p.
George Harrison wrote the
song "I Me Mine" for the
Beatles' Let it Be Album. The
song dealt with the ego prob
lem found within us all, includ
ing Harrison, and is the title of
his first book.
Harrison, through his deeply
felt appreciation and dedi
cation to Indian spiritual be
liefs, has always tried to come
to terms with his own "ego"
problem. However, after the
break-up of the Beatles,
George's heartfelt observance
of these beliefs has caused this
ex-Beatle's fall from grace
bacause he has let the spiritual
dogma dominate his music
Now, in an untypical Har
rison act, he has written an au
tobiographical book. I Me
Mine is divided into two parts.
The first is a narrative by
George Harrison as told to De
rek Taylor (the former "hip"
Beatle press officer). The sec
ond part is a compendium of
the majority of George's songs
which includes a short sum
mary dealing with the "story"
behind the writing of the
songs, and a reprint of the ori
ginal lyrics of the songs.
The narrative part, covering
about one-fifth of the book, is
short in size and short in fact.
Therefore, it is a disappoint
ment. The narrative is well writ
ten with Liverpool slang and
humor but it lacks any informa
tion about the element that
gave Harrison the power to
write the book — the Beatles.
The author merely skims
over the Beatles' history — his
reluctance to talk about this
aspect of their relationship
stems from the fact that the
group ultimately led Harrison
to much displeasure with his
own self.

He deals only with the horrid
aspects of "Beatlemania" —
the dangerous extended tours,
the caged-up atmosphere of
the group, and the need to
please everyone at all times.
Harrison ignores the great
music, and fails to mention any
of the recording sessions. He
leaves out the fame and fan ap
preciation which the Beatles
achieved, instead calling it all
like a scene from Cuckoo's
Nest.
More importantly, he com
pletely dismisses any mention
of his part in the Beatles' break
upand his subsequent feelings.
He does not discuss his rela
tions with the other ex-Beatles
and barely mentions Ringo
Starr and Paul McCartney. In
fact, he doesn't mention John
Lennon at all.

To complete this lack of in
formation, he also avoids any
discussion of the split-up of his
marriage or his relationship
with guitarist Eric Clapton.
(Clapton was in love with
George's wife, Patti, and
caused the split.)
Thus I Me Mine focuses on
Harrison's spirtual experiences
which are interesting to a
Beatles fan but mostly irrele
vant to other readers. Instead,
we learn only about George's
love of motor racing, Monty
Python, and Sir Frankic Crisp
(the eccentric Englishman who
built George's home).
The only real informative
part of this section, though, is
one that perhaps makes up for
the narrative's lack of sub
stance. It's a short passage that

sums up Harrison's true feel
ings about the group. These
lines show the closeness and
love within the group that
made it possible for them to ra
diate love and happiness onto
the world at a time of war and
hate.
"That's why the fab four
were good, . . . We protected
each other. So now, you have
to be more on your guard
when you're alone. I miss them
at times. We had great love for
each other."
The treasure of this book is
the second part — the listing of
the lyrics of George's songs in
cluding a reprint of original
copies of the songs (written on
napkins, envelopes, airline
tickets, etc.), and a summary
into the meanings and stories
behind the songs.
Included are the majority of
George's songs from the early
"Don't Bother Me" to "Here
Comes the Sun" (written in Eric
Clapton's garden after the
Beatles' business problems
with Apple), to his post-Beatles
smashes such as "My Sweet
Lord."
Through the lyrics and the
pain that they imply, we see the
transformation of a young, en
thusiastic musician into a dis
satisfied individual who wants
to break away from the group.
We can understand how Har
rison's eventual release from
the group led him to personal
happiness and self-discovery,
only to be hurt again by the
break-up of his marriage.
Finally, we witness through
the lyrics the author's re-af
firmation of self through his
new love and wife, Olivia Arias.
In short, it is the music that
tells the story which again at
tests to the fact of why the
Beatles are taken so seriously. It
was their words and music that
expressed the joys, hopes, and
pains of everyday life.
Music is the true narrative to
Harrison's life, and similarly it is
this part to the book that is to
be considered the "true auto
biography." I Me Mine adds
nothing new to the Beatles
myth, it merely affirms it. The
book proves the greatness of
the music of George Harrison
and leaves us respecting the
man although perhaps still not
fully understanding him.
Yet, if the entire "Beatles'
story" and George's life were
told directly, there would be
nothing left to ponder.
As George Harrison con
cludes, "Tell not all that you
know because he who tells all
that he knows, often tells more
than he knows."!

Starr and Paul McCartney. In
fact, he doesn't mention John
Lennon at all.

To complete this lack of in
formation, he also avoids any
discussion of the split-up of his
marriage or his relationship
with guitarist Eric Clapton.
(Clapton was in love with
George's wife, Patti, and
caused the split.)
Thus I Me Mine focuses on
Harrison's spirtual experiences
which are interesting to a
Beatles fan but mostly irrele
vant to other readers. Instead,
we learn only about George's
love of motor racing, Monty
Python, and Sir Frankic Crisp
(the eccentric Englishman who
built George's home).
The only real informative
part of this section, though, is
one that perhaps makes up for
the narrative's lack of sub
stance. It's a short passage that

sums up Harrison's true feel
ings about the group. These
lines show the closeness and
love within the group that
made it possible for them to ra
diate love and happiness onto
the world at a time of war and
hate.
"That's why the fab four
were good, . . . We protected
each other. So now, you have
to be more on your guard
when you're alone. I miss them
at times. We had great love for
each other."
The treasure of this book is
the second part — the listing of
the lyrics of George's songs in
cluding a reprint of original
copies of the songs (written on
napkins, envelopes, airline
tickets, etc.), and a summary
into the meanings and stories
behind the songs.
Included are the majority of
George's songs from the early
"Don't Bother Me" to "Here
Comes the Sun" (written in Eric
Clapton's garden after the
Beatles' business problems
with Apple), to his post-Beatles
smashes such as "My Sweet
Lord."
Through the lyrics and the
pain that they imply, we see the
transformation of a young, en
thusiastic musician into a dis
satisfied individual who wants
to break away from the group.
We can understand how Har
rison's eventual release from
the group led him to personal
happiness and self-discovery,
only to be hurt again by the
break-up of his marriage.
Finally, we witness through
the lyrics the author's re-af
firmation of self through his
new love and wife, Olivia Arias.
In short, it is the music that
tells the story which again at
tests to the fact of why the
Beatles are taken so seriously. It
was their words and music that
expressed the joys, hopes, and
pains of everyday life.
Music is the true narrative to
Harrison's life, and similarly it is
this part to the book that is to
be considered the "true auto
biography." I Me Mine adds
nothing new to the Beatles
myth, it merely affirms it. The
book proves the greatness of
the music of George Harrison
and leaves us respecting the
man although perhaps still not
fully understanding him.
Yet, if the entire "Beatles'
story" and George's life were
told directly, there would be
nothing left to ponder.
As George Harrison con
cludes, "Tell not all that you
know because he who tells all
that he knows, often tells more
than he knows."!

I Me Mine
By George Harrison
Simon & Schuster
$12.95, 398p.
George Harrison wrote the
song "I Me Mine" for the
Beatles' Let it Be Album. The
song dealt with the ego prob
lem found within us all, includ
ing Harrison, and is the title of
his first book.
Harrison, through his deeply
felt appreciation and dedi
cation to Indian spiritual be
liefs, has always tried to come
to terms with his own "ego"
problem. However, after the
break-up of the Beatles,
George's heartfelt observance
of these beliefs has caused this
ex-Beatle's fall from grace
bacause he has let the spiritual
dogma dominate his music
Now, in an untypical Har
rison act, he has written an au
tobiographical book. I Me
Mine is divided into two parts.
The first is a narrative by
George Harrison as told to De
rek Taylor (the former "hip"
Beatle press officer). The sec
ond part is a compendium of
the majority of George's songs
which includes a short sum
mary dealing with the "story"
behind the writing of the
songs, and a reprint of the ori
ginal lyrics of the songs.
The narrative part, covering
about one-fifth of the book, is
short in size and short in fact.
Therefore, it is a disappoint
ment. The narrative is well writ
ten with Liverpool slang and
humor but it lacks any informa
tion about the element that
gave Harrison the power to
write the book — the Beatles.
The author merely skims
over the Beatles' history — his
reluctance to talk about this
aspect of their relationship
stems from the fact that the
group ultimately led Harrison
to much displeasure with his
own self.

He deals only with the horrid
aspects of "Beatlemania" —
the dangerous extended tours,
the caged-up atmosphere of
the group, and the need to
please everyone at all times.
Harrison ignores the great
music, and fails to mention any
of the recording sessions. He
leaves out the fame and fan ap
preciation which the Beatles
achieved, instead calling it all
like a scene from Cuckoo's
Nest.
More importantly, he com
pletely dismisses any mention
of his part in the Beatles' break
upand his subsequent feelings.
He does not discuss his rela
tions with the other ex-Beatles
and barely mentions Ringo
Starr and Paul McCartney. In
fact, he doesn't mention John
Lennon at all.
