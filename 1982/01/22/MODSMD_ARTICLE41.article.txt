The Right Stuff
By Tom Wolfe
Bantam Books
$3.50, 368 p.
There are those individuals in life who by
habit and desire hang their hides on the edge
of danger day after day, pushing the limits of
their experience — knowing they enjoy the
confidence and the superiority of "The Right
Stuff."
Tom Wolfe's book The Right Stuff captures
the unique machoism (beyond the "Saturday
night version") of the military test pilots and
astronauts during the late 1950s and 19605.
Wolfe details not only the supreme egoism
necessary for a career in which statistically a
man faced a 23 percent chance that he would
die in an aircraft (not including combat
deaths) but also the feeling of an era. This
feeling is that of a fearful country put into
frantic motion by a 184-pound satellite called
Sputnik.
Wolfe originally became involved with the
subject of astronauts while reporting on the
last moon shot. As he said in a recent in
terview, "I was interested in whom you get to
sit on top of these enormous rockets . . . The
Saturn rocket, as I remember, was 36 stories
high. You just light a match and Varooml it
goes up. My God, I wondered, how do they
sit there"?
The book is the result of six years of re
search and interviews. Wolfe poured through
the NASA history office in Houston, review
ing recently declassified files on the early
flights.
Wolfe's intriguing theory of "The Right
Stuff" evolved as he was traversing the conti
nent to talk to test pilots, ex-test pilots,
former astronauts and failed astronauts.
Tom Wolfe begins The Right Stuff by read
ing back into the roots of Right Stuff
Bretheren during the days of secret flight tes
ting at Edwards Air Force Base. The young
men of this period — the fresh fighter jocks
returned from the Korean War — were filled
with the right stuff.
Despite the strict rules of their initial train
ing, they were expected to push theenvelope
of safety and to test the limits of their planes
and their skills, as their flight instructors
smiled and looked the other way.
As Wolfe describes, the only fear they had
was being left behind as others continued up
the pyramid containing those with the right
stuff. In the minds of the pilots, there were
neither accidents nor fatal mechanical flaws
— only fighters with the wrong stuff.
These were the men who enjoyed the cycle
of Flying and Drinking and Drinking and Driv
ing as they pushed the limits both in the air
and on the ground. "I don't advise it you un
derstand," they would say, "but it can be
done (provided you have the right stuff, you
miserable pudnocker)."
Wolfe details in wonderfully colorful lan
guage the amazing ego of the military pilot —
the ultra-righteous right stuff — a feeling so
exalted it could be religious.
From the book emerges the epitome of the
right stuff, Chuck Yeager. The airline pilot's
voice is characterized by Wolfe as a "particu
lar drawl, a particular foolishness, a particular

down-home calmness that is so exaggerated
it begins to parody itself." Yeager embodies
the right stuff — the man who first broke the
sound barrier while secretly nursing two bro
ken ribs from a drunken horseback ride two
nights before — the man who first tested a So
viet M-15 by taking it up to 50,000 feet and
then down to 12,000 feet on a power dive
without so much as an instruction manual.
Wolfe additionally captures the lives of the
fighter jock wives. We glimpse the poor wives
waiting alone on display in front of the press
as their husbands raced across the sky. They
waited hoping never to hear that "something
has happened" — the official wife lingo for
the subject which cannot be articulated.
The wives sat back in fear as their husbands
talked about other men who had "bought it"

The only fear they had was
being left behind as others
continued up the pyramid
... there were neither
accidents nor fatal
mechanical flaws — only
fighters with the wrong stuff

or "crunched" — sat quietly as the men
talked about that "something" the way they
talked about sports.
Following an insightful introduction into
the men and their egos the book takes a
fascinating historical look at the early NASA
program launched in the wake of Sputnik.
Wolfe sets aside the American apple pie im
age surrounding this period.
"I had always felt that the stories originally
written about the Mercury astronauts were
not objective. The Cold War was on — people
really believed there was danger from the
Russians in space and the press was uniformly
patriotic.
Wolfe provides an interesting and amusing
look into the men and episodes of the early
part of the space race. He contrasts the dif
ferent astronauts who were originally pro
tected from wrongdoing by an imaginary pa
triotic halo.
Though the boys back at The Edwards base
would never admit that the Mercury program
required any of the right stuff (the first flights
were to be made by monkeys), the NASA pro
gram became a new path for fighter jocks
continually seeking to move up the ladder.
Despite the lack of flying, the same qualities
of stamina, guts and fast neural synapses were
required — and in addition the heroic pay-off
was immense.
The Right Stuff contains a fascinating slice
of male egoism and history revealing many
known and unknown heroes in their boxer
shorts. There is also much pure flying in the
book that any Walter Mitty pilot would thor
oughly enjoy (that is provided he or she has
some of the right stuff — you miserable pud
nocker).
