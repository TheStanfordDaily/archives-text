dramatic or psychological terms

who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice

Not a great movie, but often

John Gregory Dunne and loan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks foctis;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and

foreground. The director, Ulu

good film sense, hut he does have
a gift for working with actors, and

Deliverance ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Director john Boorman's im
personal style is distancing and
the acting lacks the Southern feel
that's needed, but Boorman's
ability to create an atmosphere of
terror is hypnotic; after the first
few minutes, you're hooked. A
group of city slickers take a canoe
trip down a primitive backwoods
river; before long, their adven
ture goes horribly wrong. This
adaptation of James Dickey's tale
has stick figures for characters,
but |on Voight, Ned Beatty and
(especially) Burt Reynolds (who
can't quite take his macho role
seriously) feverishly try to give
them some life. The great Vilmos
Zsigmond is the cinemato

Director john Boorman's im

jane Fonda produced and Alan

ever seen a movie vary in tone so
much from scene toscene. Some
times it's a brittle love story a bout
a Wealthy widow (Fonda) and her
financier lover (Kris Kristof
fersori), and sometimes it's a tale
of shady bank dealings which
threaten to devastate the world
economy. When an attempt is
made to bring the two plots to
gether at the end in a bizarre hap
py postscript to a disaster movie
climax, the movie self-destructs.
It's like trying to make change

True Confessions ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Gregory Dunne and loan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks foctis;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the

foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, hut he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances — especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may

Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,

comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and

that the movie dies a little when

I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was

because he tries to put down Hol

The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the

Arthur ***
Fox, Redwood City
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warpetl enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and
best friend. Gielgud's so good
that the movie dies a little when
ever he's offscreen.
Plays through Saturday with

I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the
only performance worth watch
ing is given by Robert Preston as a
Los Angeles doctor who's unwill

Saturday, Cubberley
Exploding heads — which also

a high art in this grim, not particu
larly convincing updatingof High
Noon. Sean Connery plays the
neo-sheriff who races against
time to beat the bad guys on the
moons of lupiter. The bad guys
are responsible for the produc
tion of a drug which makes peo
ple think it's fun to take off their
helmets in deep space (that's why
their heads explode). Connery

(his accent has never sounded

John Gregory Dunne and loan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks foctis;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy

a priest) is never moved into the

foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, hut he does have
a gift for working with actors, and

ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a

This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth

moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Ardant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity 0? her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
finches — it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

quiet, dead end lane is invaded
by a pair of unrestrainable luna

Arthur ***
Fox, Redwood City
Not a great movie, but often
quick enough, and witty enough,
and warpetl enough to make it
more enjoyable than the other
comedies that were foisted upon
us last summer. Dudley Moore, in
the title role, plays a wealthy alco
holic who falls in love with Liza
Minnelli, who spends her time
shoplifting and dreaming of
being an actress. The movie's real
love match, however, is between
Moore and John Gielgud, who
plays Arthur's aging valet and

that the movie dies a little when

I get the idea that director
Blake Edwards thought he was
making a satire. It's hard to tell,
because he tries to put down Hol
lywood at the same time he's cel
ebrating Hollywood methods.
The movie, which deals with a
producer's attempt to save a flop
movie by turning it into soft core
porn, is so mean-spirited (like Ed
wards' last movie, 10) that it sput
ters itself away. Julie Andrews
and William Holden star, but the
only performance worth watch

Absence of Malice **'/;
Old Mill, Mountain View
Visually, Sidney Pollock's mov
ie is Hat and conventional, and
Kurt Luedtke's script, an indict
ment of irresponsible journalism
and incidious methods of crimi
nal investigation, lacks punch,
too. The story is plausible, but the
filmmakers don't ask us to weigh
the issues: they've already de
cided who's to blame and how
the characters should have be
haved. As the journalist, Sally
Field gives a bland, unnuanced,
performance. The movie's only
real substance is Paul Newman's
acting in the role of the man un

As a movie, Who guitarist Pete

ail huge and loud: they splatter
all over the place Some of the re

while others are right yn the
mark. Although the Who get the
message across better live (as you

made the greatest possible movie

Mommie Dearest seems to

warp: it isn't a pit Hire about Joan

i wood life. Since Director Frank
r Perry doesn't direct Joan's
J notorious attacks on her daugh
-1 ter Christina from the girl's per
spective, and most of them aren't
explained, they make no sense in

dramatic or psychological terms
— and they never seem,to have
consequences. Neither faye
Dunaway nor the child who plays
the young Christina, Mara Hobet,
betrays any tension between real
life, and play acting. Dunaway,
who has studied Crawford's mov
ies so closely that she can repro
duce her way of raising one eye
brow and her tears-in-the-voice
routine (and is made up to look
creepiiy like Crawford in some
scenes), accomplishes something
that I would never have sus
pected any actress of wanting to
do — she gives an accurate ren
dering of the way Joan Crawford
would have played this role.

of Grand Guignol. Bette Davis,
wearing a fright wig seemingly
stolen from Harpo Marx, and
Joan Crawford, emoting furious

parodies. It's hard not to feel em
barassed for them: they're partic

been something unwholesome
about star-worship — it seems to
be tied to a desire to prove that

and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a

This variation on Noel Coward's
Private Lives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been a first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
