Reagan stalls arms talks
Washington — The Reagan administration,
citing the crisis in Poland, has all but ruled out
earlier plans to set a date for strategic arms con
trol talks with the Soviet Union when Secretary
of State Alexander Haig Jr. meets with Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko in Geneva next
week.
"I would not encourage a belief that an
agreement to begin START (strategic arms re
duction talks) will be reached in Geneva," an
administration official said yesterday. Last fall,
President Ronald Reagan announced a decision
to seek Soviet agreement to begin the talks "a;
soon as possible" this year.
The Haig-Gromyko meeting, originally to lasi
two days, was jointly announced in Moscov\
and Washington as scheduled only for Jan. 26
State Department spokesman Alan Romberg
explained yesterday that in the "curreni
climate" of East-West relations, "we are confi
dent we can accomplish our objectives in a sin
gle day." Romberg said the "primary focus ol
the talks will be on Poland."
Haig himself had declared this at a news con
ference in Brussels Jan. 12. But Soviet Am
bassador Anatoly Dobrynin reportedly was in
formed of Haig's intentions during a meeting
Wednesday with Undersecretary of State
Walter Stoessel Jr. just before his return to Mos
cow to help prepare for the Geneva Talks.
The joint announcement said merely that
Haig and Gromyko would meet "to continue
the exchange of views begun in New York in
September."
The administration's public attitude toward
the Gromyko meeting has turned markedly
chilly in recent days, as criticism sharpened
against Reagan and Haig for conducting "busi
ness as usual" with the Russians despite the
Polish crisis.
Oil royalties to increase
Washington — The Reagan administration
announced yesterday a new effort aimed at
halting underpayments by oil companies and
theft that deprive the federal government,
states and Indian tribes of hundreds of millions
of dollars each year.
Interior Secretary James Watt said the
changes, many of them already in place, will

bring the nation $200 million to $650 million
more annually in royalties the companies pay
for the right to produce oil and gas on federal
and Indian lands.
The collection of these royalties "is on the
honor system," said David Linowes, chairman
of a commission that Watt named to study the
issue, and the system is not working.
The government has no way of verifying how
much oH and gas is pumped, Linowes said.
"Only a handful of audits have been conducted
and they have revealed significant under
payments. Site security is deficient. Theft of oil
is common," he said.
The Interior Department also will double its
force of inspectors and take other measures to
improve its checks on royalty payments and se
curity on the leases.
End to martial law demanded
Warsaw — Poland's Roman Catholic bishops
reportedly have drafted a strongly worded let
ter to the nation demanding the lifting of
martial law, the prompt release of all persons in
terned by the military government and an end
to "ideological pressure" against members of
the suspended independent trade union Soli
darity.
Meanwhile it was disclosed that the wife of
Polish labor leader Lech Walesa has accused the
military authorities of holding her husband il
legally and complained that she has never re
ceived formal notification of his detention.
The bishops' letter, drawn up earlier this
week in the first meeting of the Polish
episcopate since martial law was declared Dec.
13, is said to warn of possible protests, revolts
and civil strife unless dialogue is resumed be
tween the government and society.
It also reportedly demands restoration of the
right of workers to organize into "independent,
self-governing trade unions."
The text of the pastoral letter, which is ex
pected to be read in churches soon, has not yet
been published. But sources close to the church
said it was intended to express forcefully the
church's opposition to the military crackdown
while restating earlier appeals for calm.
About 90 percent of Poland's population is
Catholic and the church is considered one of

the most powerful institutions in the Com
munist-ruled nation of 32 million. Its position of
strength is recognized by the martial law gov
ernment of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski and it has
emerged as a key intermediary between the
government and Solidarity.
The bishops' letter comes as private nego
tiations between the church and the govern
ment continue for the release of Lech Walesa
and other interned Solidarity leaders.
Arabs call for Golan debate
United Nations — Jordan and Syria are calling
for an emergency General Assembly session to
debate Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights
because the United States vetoed a Security
Council resolution calling for sanctions against
the Jewish state.
Jordanian Ambassador Hazem Nuseibeh,
who sponsored the sanctions resolutions, said
after Wednesday's vote that he would ask the
15-nation council to convene the assembly ses
sion. The 157-nation assembly's Third World
majority probably would censure Israel, but the
assembly is not empowered to take punitive ac
tion against a member.
Meanwhile militant Arabs today called for re
capture of the Syrian Golan Heights annexed by
Israel and an oil blockade of the United States
because it vetoed U.N. sanctions against the
Jewish state.

2.38 to 848.27. At its early-afternoon peak, the
widely recognized average had been up about 7
