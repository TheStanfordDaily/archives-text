# San Jose chief defends police conduct

Police can go as far in their duties
as law allows, and should go as far as
the public asks, said San Jose Police
Chief Joseph McNamara at a panel
discussion Wednesday in Toyon Hall.
McNamara shared the podium
with Thomas Nolan, a criminal law
specialist whose views on the proper
limitations of police power differed
from McNamara's, resulting in
heated debate.
Nolan, a member of the California
Bar Criminal Law Advisory Commit
tee, argued that the protection of in
dividual rights from abuses of police
power justifed letting some criminals
go free.
Debate focused on the ex
clusionary rule, which prevents il
legally obtained evidence from
being introduced in court, and
whether this rule protects falsely ac
cused citizens and abused prisoners,
or guilty criminals who are acquitted
through a legal loophole.
McNamara cited a number of the
complicated and profuse regulations
that cover search and seizure. When
stopping a car, for example, an of-
I

ficer might be allowed to search a
grocery bag sitting oh the front seat,
buj not a closed knapsack sitting next
to it or a grocery bag in the back of
the car, out of reach of the driver.
After an arrest is made, said
McNamara, it is often the police of
ficer who "goes on trial" for his con
duct during the arrest.
Careful restrictions on police
power are necessary, said Nolan, to
protect our rights and our personal
freedom in what he said he thinks is
becoming an American police state.
Nolan said he has seen clients
beaten in jail with no investigation
ever made of the incident, that he is
harassed personally by police, and
that he is now being sued for libel by
police "to keep me quiet" about
abuses.
Nolan said the exclusionary rule
and other restrictions are necessary
to check the "raw power" of police,
even if it means letting a few crimi
nals slip through the fingers of the le
gal system.
"I'd rather face the possibility of
being killed (by a released criminal)

than live in a society where we lock
up innocent people to protect
ourselves," said Nolan.
He added that the goal for Ameri
can law enforcement systems should
be to treat every person in society the
same way. If there were no dis
crimination or selectivity in the ac
tions of police officers, he said, there
would be no need for many of the
cumbersome procedural restrictions
on police actions.
As it is, Nolan said, police often use
their discretion in a prejudiced
manner or carry the law to unneces
sary and harmful extremes.
He cited the example of a small
number of Stanford students ar
rested at the Big Game (Stanford vs.
UC-Berkeley) last year for urinating
in the stadium. For these virtually
harmless antics, the students could
receive permanently damaging crim
inal records, he said.
A student in the audience
Wednesday commented that his sis
ter had been stopped for traffic vio
lations seven times by a male police
man and received seven warnings,

while he has been stopped three
times and ticketed on each occasion.
McNamara said police are allowed
a certain amount of discretion in ex
ercising their duties. He also ad
mitted that police do abuse their dis
cretionary powers and even commit
much graver offenses.
"I don't have the answer (to these
problems)," said Nolan. "The jury
does, using established rules of evi
dence."
McNamara concluded, however,
that many restrictions on police ac
tions, including the exclusionary
rule, fail to prevent police miscon
duct, and allow the release of some
guilty men and women. "Justice," he
said, "is when every man gets his
due."
Wednesday's discussion, "The Po
lice: how far can they go?, how far
should they go?" was moderated by
William Keough, adjunct professorat
the Stanford Law School. It was the
first of four panel forums onthe crim
inal justice system in America,
planned for the Toyon Lecture series
in conjuction with Residential Educa
tion.
