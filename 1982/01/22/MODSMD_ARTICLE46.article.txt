Staff lunch
There is a time for all things, and the time for yet another in a wonderful
series of staff lunches is Tuesday at noon. Turn, turn to some wonderful com
pany, but don't curse the apolitical, non-conscious hierarchy if there isn't any
food. If that catastrophe happens it's for a good reason: the money will be
redirected to a wee bash the following Friday.
