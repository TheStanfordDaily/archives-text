# University retirement policy debated faculty says older professors still able
##

A University policy which de
mands that faculty members who are
currently 66 to 68 years old take part
time teaching jobs instead of keeping
their full-time jobs sparked heated
debate yesterdav afternoon in the
Faculty Senate.
The rise in the national mandatory
retirement age from 65 to 70, which
was approved in 1979 takes effect
here this year. The University, in an
attempt to compromise with the fac
ulty, had decided, soon after the
change, that instead of retiring the
66- to 68-year-old faculty members, it
would give them the opportunity to
work part-time.
A few of the senators disagreed,
however, with this policy and the
University's adoption of the man
datory retirement plan in general.

Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth accused the University
of "agism" and prejudice. "Should
our students learn that when our pro
fessors get older they are put on a
farm?" he asked.
Despite vehement disapproval of
the mandatory retirement plan no
proposals were made to alter the sen
ate's stand in favor of the policy.
The senators did acknowledge,
however, the numerous problems
which emerge because of the na
tional rise in the retirement age.
According to a report to the senate
by a task force on retirement policies,
by 1985 this rise will cause an ex
tensive decline in faculty members
under the age of 40 and also put addi
tional financial pressures on the Uni
versity.
In 1980 35 percent of the faculty

were under the age of 40, and in 1985
only 23 percent will be in this age cat
egory, the report says. The University
also expects 26 percent fewer faculty
hirings by 1985
In 1974, 42 percent of the faculty
were under the age of 40.
Most older faculty members also
have more tenure and, therefore, re
ceive larger salaries than their young
er colleagues. The University must
pay more per professor, and if there
is a larger number of older professors
the University must meet an increas
ingly large financial commitment.
The University paid $28.4 million
for faculty salaries last year and ex
pects to pay, discluding a nine per
cent inflation rate, $29.8 million in
1985
Many faculty members were dis
mayed at this trend toward an older

faculty.
"It is a biological fact that a 70-
year-old has fewer brain cells than a
30-year-old," said Norman Wessells,
dean of humanities and sciences.
Roth retorted to this, however, by
claiming that "there are a hell of a lot
of 70-year-olds using what little brain
cells they have and there are a lot of
30-year-olds who aren't using all of
their brain cells which haven't died
yet."
English Prof. Herbert Linden
berger stressed the need for young
professors.
"We have to keep ourselves in
tellectually vital," he said. "There are
so many young professors just out of
graduate school who are enthusiastic
and have so many new ideas ... we
have to recruit more of these kinds of
professors."
