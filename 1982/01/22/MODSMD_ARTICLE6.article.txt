# Human rights panel denounces policies
## 
### Mike Thurman 
Panel members last night
criticized the Reagan adminis
tration for overlooking extensive
human rights violations in South
ern Cone countries (Argentina,
Chile and Uruguay) and con
demned similar abuses in Poland
and the Soviet Union.
The charges were made in
Kresge Auditorium before an au
dience of about 70 as human
rights advocates concluded a two
day conference sponsored by the
Center for Latin American Studies
and Amnesty International.
"The way the current adminis
tration has implemented its hu
man rights policy is simplistic,
short-sighted and cynical," said Jo
Marie Griesgraber, deputy direc
tor of the Washington Office on
Latin America (WOLA).
"We have difficulty dist
inguishing between how the gov
ernments in the Southern Cone
operate and the governments of
the Soviet Union and the People's

Republic of China when it comes
to the curtailment of all human
rights," said Griesgraber. "There
is a need for a strong human rights
policy that would criticize our
friends as well as our enemies on
human rights violations."
"Nothing in the history or the
recent polarization of Argentina
can justify an abandonment of
fundamental and basic human
rights and liberties," said )uan
Mendez, Argentinean exile and
director of Chile Liaison Informa
tion Office to the United Nations.
Mendez spoke of regular disap
pearances of citizens perceived as
political opponents of the Argen
tinean government. He said that
"once someone has been de
tained without the acknowl
edgement of the government,
there are no limits to the torture
that can take place on govern
ment facilities that become con
centration or extermination

camps.
"Everybody is a potential ene
my (in the eyes of the govern
ment)," said Mendez. "Their ob
ject is the annihilation of the ene
my."
Robert Goldman, a law pro
fessor at American University in
Washington and former consul
tant to the Inter-American Com
mission on Human Rights,
focused on the Uruguayan gov
ernment's intervention into the
country's legal institutions.
"Under this doctrine," said
Goldman, "a lawyer practicing his
profession is, in the eyes of the
military, aiding and abetting the
subversive he defends and thus
becomes a subversive himself."
Goldman called for "the resto
ration of an independent func
tioning judicial system. You can
not talk about improvements in
these areas (Southern Cone coun

tries) until this happens."
Documentary filmmaker and
Amnesty International (U.S.)
board member Jaime Barrios dis
cussed the military takeoverof the
Chilean educational system as
well as the recent crackdown by
the country's government.
"It is a new offensive of repres
sion," said Barrios in an interview
yesterday. "But this time it uses
more sophisticated means of re
pression and more systematic tor
ture."
"The junta has tried to trans
form the institutions of Chile,"
said Barrios. "This includes the
military control of the daily opera
tions and curriculum of Chilean
universities."
Barrios said the government has
reduced the number of fields of
study in college curriculums,
eliminating the study of many lib
eral arts as well as scientific re
search projects.
