# Libyans as nations sign pact Iranian oil advisors to assist
## 
### 
from the Daily wire services
Tehran, Iran — Iran and Libya, drawn together
by a common dependence on oil revenues and
Islamic religion and revolution, signed an agree
ment this week marking a spectacular improve
ment in their relations.
The agreement provides for 2000 Iranians to
go to Libya to replace American oil technicians
working in the North African country. A first
contingent of 200 will leave shortly to be fol
lowed by a further 1800 before March 20.
Iran first decided to send experts to Libya on
Dec. 13 in what was seen as a gesture of "Islamic
solidarity" following a decision by the United
States to withdraw its personnel from Libya in re
taliation for alleged Libyan support for interna
tional terrorism.
The move was also seen as a way of proving
that Iran is a "great regional power" capable of
replacing experts from a superpower despite
problems generated by the current war with
Iraq.
It is also good publicity for Iran in the Arab
world, where Tehran is often the butt of
criticism, and where Iraq is making some suc
cessful overtures to improve its links with other
governments, notably Saudi Arabia and Libya.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akhbar Velayati
apparently wishes to consolidate friendship with
existing allies, to avoid losing support, as hap
pened with the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion. Trips are planned to the Algerian and Lib

yan capitals as a follow up to a visit he made to
Damascus, Syria, on Dec. 31.
Not everyone in Tehran wants friendly ties
with Libya, however. Certain members of the
clergy still want to know what happened to Leb
anese Shiite Imam Moussa Sadr — a follower of
Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini — who they suspect disappeared in
September 1978 in Libya.
But the pro-Libyan lobby is powerful, with
strong support in the ruling Islamic Republican
Party and in the government.
The case of Moussa Sadr explains many of the
ups and downs in relations between Tehran and
Tripoli. Because of it, Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy was unable to visit Iran after the success
of the Iranian revolution. Then in the middle of
last year, Libyan representative Saad Mujber was
recalled for several months.
It was in December that relations began to
warm up between Tripoli and Tehran. The test
came on Dec. 9 when a Libyan jetliner hijacked
in the name of Imam Moussa Sadr by a Lebanese
commando group landed in Iran. The Iranians
refused the hijackers' demands to condemn the
Libyan regime and instead settled the plane's
fate through negotiations with Libyan
diplomats.
The improvement in relations, although eco
nomically beneficial to both sides, cannot totally
erase from memory the Imam Sadr case or the
fact that Iran is at war with an Arab state.
