# Soviet media reports U.S. disasters—not its own
## 
### 
Moscow (AP) — Soviet air
planes do tumble from the
skies, Soviet trains sometimes
collide and workers die in fac
tory disasters. But the ordinary
Russian would not know it.
On two consecutive nights
last week, Moscow television
showed film from the jetliner
crash in Washington, D.C., in
which 78 people were killed,
and Soviet newspapers sug
gested the accident was linked
to President Ronald Reagan's
dismissal of striking air con
trollers last summer, an action
the Soviets denounced.
But when a Soviet jetliner
crashed near the southern city
of Alma Ata 18 monthsago, kill
ing more than 160 people, the
Moscow media ignored it.
Sketchy word of the crash, one
of the worst in Soviet history,
came from a provincial news
paper.
Soviet citizens know that
aviation and other disasters
happen, but are led by the
state-controlled media to be
lieve they are much more fre
quent in the West than in the
Soviet Union.
"When there's a major crash
here, red-faced officials
wouldn't wan* us to focus on

it," one Soviet media official
explained recently.
No social purpose
Under Soviet-style Com
munist ideology, such news is
said to serve no useful social
purpose. The media is a tool of
the party, and although the
press sometimes carries
"negative" news, such as re
ports on alcoholism and poor
work habits, it generally con
fines itself to patriotic exhorta
tions.

Soviet citizens know that aviation and
other disasters happen, but are led by the
state-controlled media to believe they are
much more frequent in the West than in
the Soviet Union.
'W/ien there's a major crash here, red
faced officials don't want us to focus on it/
— Soviet media official

The official news outlets are
not so reluctant, however, to
report near-accidents that ex
emplify heroism and pro
fessionalism. A newspaper told
yesterday of a Sovietairliner pi
lot who managed to make an
emergency landing despite
almost being overcome by
fumes leaking from a chemical
substance carried by a passen
ger.
In the past two years alone,
unofficial reports have sur
faced of a major outbreak of
anthrax after an industrial acci
dent at a biological warfare
plant in the Soviet city of
Sverdlovsk; a subway accident
in Moscow in which seven
people were reported killed,
and a military plane crash in
Leningrad said to have killed as
many as 70 generals and other
Soviet military men.
The official media did not re
port the military crash until
three days after it happened,
and then did not say how many
died or where it occurred. The
other disaster reports were
either ignored or dealt with in
the briefest terms, without
mention of casualties.
Further obscuring the evi
dence about accidents here is
the reluctance of Soviet
citizens to talk to foreign re
porters about them.
That may stem from knowl
edge that passing information
damaging to the state is pun
ishable by imprisonment, or it
may simply reflect hesitancy to

spread information that some
how might prove embarrassing
to a country always conscious
of its image.
The information
"brownout" spawns rumors,
which often prove impossible
to pin down. A recent case il
lustrates the problem.
At least 10 people were re
ported by private sources to
have been killed at an un
specified factory somewhere in
Moscow earlier this month.

Soviet newspapers, radio
and television carried no such
story, and the Moscow's mayor
office, local police and fire of
ficials, after being queried, all
denied knowledge of an acci
dent.
Days later, Western re
porters learned from sources
the name and address of the
plant, which turned out to be a
machine tool factory. The re
porters drove to the site and
found workmen clearing rub
ble from a collapsed roof and
twisted pieces of machinery.
Even then, a Soviet man at the
scene insisted nothing out of
the ordinary had happened.
The press and officials are
just as reluctant to talk about
fires or crime as they are about
air crashes.
When fire broke out in Feb
ruary 1977 at the modern Hotel
Rossiya on Moscow's Red
Square, police and fire officials

hindered Western reporters
trying to cover the story. Up to
30' people may have been killed
in the blaze. Soviet authorities
later told Western diplomats
that foreigners were among
the dead, but announced no
details.
Last March, Western journal
ists heard that a schoolgirl was

being held hostage by an
armed man in a Moscow apart
ment building. An American
reporter rushed to the scene,
saw a large number of po
licemen and asked one what
was happening. "A luncheon,"
he replied.
It later turned out that the
girl was killed.
