CHARLES R. BLYTH
FUND OF STANFORD
UNIVERSITY
An autonomous student-managed investment fund is now
accepting applications for membership on the Board of
Directors to serve from April 1, 1982-March 31, 1983.
The Blyth fund is designed to provide undergraduate students interested in
finance and investments with a practical education in the workings of the stock,
bond and securities markets. The Board of Directors has approximately $93,000
at its disposal and is in exclusive control of all investment decisions.
The Fund has been in operation since 1979 and has provided valuable investment
experience for the students involved.
Interest in learning how to manage investments and commitment to the project
will weigh equally with experience in the selection of students.
Applications may be picked up at the
Office of Dean of Student Affairs, 323 Old Union
DEADLINE: FEBRUARY 8
