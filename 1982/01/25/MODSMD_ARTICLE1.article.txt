# 49ers triumph in Super Bowl XVI
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
It was a spent and broken man I
spoke to that afternoon so long ago.
Actually it wasn't all that long ago,
but there was another losing season
ahead of him, and another.
His voice was cracked with weari
ness then, his visage was not a smiling
one. He was a rookie head coach
who was supposed to be a boy gen
ius, but his team was 2-12.
My question was a simple one, but
I asked it with the utmost trepidation
because I was a Bill Walsh fan for life
after he took the Stanford Cardinals
to two straight bowl games. And the
quiver in his voice made me nervous.
"How long would you say it's going
to take to turn the 49ers into a win

mng team?"
"Honey, you'll be married with
three kids."
End of conversation. What Bill
Walsh did next, probably as soon as
the conversation ended, was put on
his headset and start figuring out
some tricky things he could throw at
a bunch of increasingly conservative
football teams. He went 2-12 again
the next year and 6-10 the next. With
every loss I remembered that fateful
reply.
So there was a certain gladness in
my heart and a lightness in my step as
I tripped gaily off to watch yester
day's game at the Emerson Street Bar
& Grill in Palo Alto. It's an enchanting

little place just off University Avenue
which I chose mainly because a sign
promised two television sets, 49-cent
beer and Bengal Burgers.
What I saw through a haze of beer
and exultation was a man about to
become beloved. It was evident from
the moment the 49ers ran on to the
field, laughing instead of twitching
nervously.
It was evident even before that,
when Walsh appeared dressed up as
a bellhop ready to carry the 49ers'
bags as they checked into their hotel
in Detroit. It was evident when he let
his players go to a Diana Ross concert
the Friday night before the big game,
and let them practice to rock and roll.

It was evident when he called that
flea flicker on third down and two in
the Super Bowl, and when it worked
he simply went on chatting with his
headset.
Pretty soon that headset is going to
turn into one of those comfortable
pieces of football folklore, maybe
like Bear Bryant's hat or Jim Thorpe's
leather helmet.
With yesterday's Super Bowl vic
tory the NFL saw the beginning of a
dynasty, something that was sup
posed to be going on in Philadelphia
and New York and Cincinnati and
just about every other place but here.
So the boy genius came through,
and I'm not even engaged.


Bill Walsh
