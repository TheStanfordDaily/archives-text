## Jane Fonda at New Varsity a political performance 
### Joan O'Connell 
It started raining harder. The
line in front of the New Varsity
snaked in and out of drier areas
of the courtyard. The crowd
was soaked and people were
grumbling about parking, or
lack of same, as the downpour
increased. One woman de
manded entry to the theater
"because I own part of this
place." Press people waved
their passes to the dismay of
those standing under dripping
spots beneath the gutters. The
lobby was packed. What we
had here was an honest-to
goodness, pre-planned and
publicized media event.
Perched behind a podium a
few yards into the lobby, ac
tress and political activist Jane
Fonda, pen in hand, promo
tional materials all about her,
signed autographs and met the
folks who paid $10 a head for
that privilege and to view the
Palo Alto premier of her new
movie, On Golden Pond.
First we might as well dis
pense with the list of qualities
you've come to look for in a
Fonda feature: Ves, she's slim,
trim, energetic, directed, in
formed, poised. She's every bit
as beautiful in person. She does
not dress like a movie star —
the plaid cowboy shirt, suede
skirt and boots were ap
propriate, both for the weather
and the occasion. She looks a
lot like her father. Every move
she made was orchestrated bya
crew of advance people; her
smile is automatic, her gaze
direct, her"just plain folks" ap
proach to "just plain folks" ef
fected with ease.
The New Varsity, which has
through the years been the
scene of many such events sev
eral times previously with the
Fonda corps, was the picture of
celebrated confusion: volun
teers from the Campaign for an
Economic Democracy (CED) —
the Santa Monica-based politi
cal action organization which
Fonda and her husband, Tom
Hayden founded, were posi
tioned in alcoves and aisles,
handing out materials and so
liciting contributions which
they stuffed into mayonnaise
jar banks.
There were, it seemed, two
kinds of folks on hand: those
who crowded around the front
lobby, still shaking the water
from their umbrellas, com
menting that she was so friend
ly and so much better looking
in person; and those in the bar
in the back, the designer
labeled set who sneeked peeks
over the tops of steaming cups
of Cafe Royale, not daring to
be deemed curious, yet too in
trigued to miss out on material
for later critiques of the way
the masses act on their night
out.
I he star stood signing auto
graphs and shaking hands for
an hour. Was it worth it to wait
in line?
You bet, said most.
"She was just like any one of
us," said Laverne Popken, a
schoolteacher from San Jose,
who with her friend, Gerd
Salmonson, had driven up de
spite the foul weather because
"Henry Fonda is about my age
and I've followed Jane
throughout the years. I admire
what she and her husband are
doing.
"When I went through the
line I even went like this (she

reached out and pinched my
chin) and Jane just smiled and
said 'Are you from the
Midwest?' Now I am from Min
nesota and that was so nice to
hear. And then she said, 'You
know, all the good people are
from the Midwest' " Popken
recalled, smiling, as Salmonson
nodded.
So they were there because
they supported her politics?
"No, we came up to see the
movie."
As CED's main publicity
grabbing attraction, Fonda re
lies heavily on interview
tested, stock phrases, giving
her an aura of insincerity.
Crisp, clever lines quoted
verbatim in numerous publica
tions and television talk shows
pepper her spiel. The mainly
30- to 50-year-ranged audience
seemed to be well briefed al
ready in the Ladies Home Jour
nal-style Fonda biography:
many said they were glad to
observe for themselves that
she's abandoned her down
with-the-government, 60s ap
proach, glad that she's getting
along with her dad, glad that
she still manages to take her

There were, it seemed, two kinds of
folks on hand: those who crowded

commenting that she was so friendly
and so much better looking in person;
and those in the bar in the back, the

"I thought what she said on
the 'John Davidson Show' gave
some insight," said Popken.
"She said when she was young
she went along with the crowd
and that now she's found
herself."
Obviously sbe had scoped
out her audierfte as they filed
by and her 20-minute speech
showed it — tonight was
Mom's night.
Fhe Politically Aware Moth
er repeatedly found a cham
pion as Fonda's CED agenda in
vited her to fight for tenant's
rights, anti-nuclear causes, so
lar energy, health.
"Studies are now showing
that 80 percent of all cancers
are caused by environmental
factors," she said, recalling
Love Canal and the women
who have been politicized by it
and other poisonous-waste
dump issues. She glorified the
efforts of the common woman,
the kind of woman for whom
"the parameters of life used to
be taking the kids to and from
school, cooking dinner. . .
"Women who never
dreamed they'd get involved
with CEDor Jane FondaorTorn
Hayden" have joined their
cause, she said. "Where you
can harness local frustration
and anger, there's no stopping
us."
Fonda and Hayden have

spent considerable time back
ing political candidates across
the state because "we want to
see people elected who have
guts," she said.
"We don't want to see just
rich people get elected,"said
Fonda. She may not want them
in office, but she was glad to
see them in the audience Tues
day. One gentleman dropped
$550 for an autographed script
signed by Fonda and her father
and more than $200 for a movie
poster during an auction she
conducted right after the
speech.
One aide estimated the eve
ning's total receipts for CED at
$12,000 — between the 200-
strong, $15-a-head wine recep
tion before the speech, the 750
$10 seats sold, and the $1200

gleaned from the auction, not
to mention checks dutifully
sifineti and delivered In the re
ception line.
"I love being an auctioneer,"
Fonda whooped into the mi
crophone, as bidding for the
movie memorobilia heated up.
"Now this (8-by-10 auto
graphed pictured of her father,
Henry Fonda) is very special,"
she said. Jane reassured the au
dience that her father — who
has recently been ill — was
now home from the hospital
and feeling angry, a sure sign of
an impending recovery, ac
cording to Fonda.
She noted that the auto
graphed items were particular
ly special, because he was"hav
ing so much difficulty writing
lately ... so let's start that bid
ding at $10." A few people
shifted uncomfortably in their
seats and someone remarked
that perhaps we would next see
his intravenous tubes or hospi
tal charts on the auction block.
But Fonda soon won the au
dience back with a snappy per
formance.
Pitting aisle against aisle,
back against front — "What,
the rich are sitting in the
back?" "I haven't heard any
bids from this side . . . must be
students" — she juggled items
and microphone, identifying
bidders with a snaking, slender
hand.

"Why now?" she asks of a
$250 bidder who'cJ delayed his
entry to the foray well after the
intial $10 bid. "This is fascinat
ing to me."
Before hurrying off to sign
the auctioned items, Fonda let
the audience in on a few inside
notes on the movie: she said
she had always wanted to work
with her father, but the quality
of scripts they'd been sent
"had me playing his mistress or
his maid." But in the script for
On Golden Pond, "I could just
hear my father saying those
lines."
"To hear him say suckface
. . I really did it (accepted the
script) because I wanted to
hear my dad say suckface," she
revealed, to hearty laughter
and applause from the au
dience.
Finally Fonda had pitched
her last item and left the thea
ter amid her entourage with
the press in hot pursuit, as the
movie began.
"Hi, Jane," one called, with
the alcohol-enhanced as
surance of an old friend as she
was ushered out the door.
"Hello, I can't see anything,"
Fonda called back. The TV klieg
lights from which she'd been
requesting a respite all evening
had been set up, blinding the
main attraction who was now
seated — or rather stranded —
behind a low table, nervously
clasping her hands.
The TV folks got first crack,
wanting to know what she
thought of President Ronald
Reagan.
"He's probably a very good
man and a good father, but I
don't think the politics of 1900
jrc jpp//cd6/f? now. VVc Vc
to say 'enough already' to the
politics of Hollywood" said the
actress/activist.
She graced the next question
with a more thoughtful answer
than it probably deserved, after
the TV man asked who asked
how Reagan and CED econom
ic/political policies differed.
"Where we do feel the Re
publicans are onto something
is in feeling that more and
more money is being thrown at
problems," when there are
other solutions, she said with a
look indicating that that was
about the extent of their com
mon ground.
I asked Fonda about senior
citizens and how CED could
benefit them. She said CED was
fighting to maintain the $122
per month minimum Social Se
curity benefit and also to main
tain rent control for areas
where seniors live.
"But do you think senior
citzens might be scared of
CED?" (After all, we are talking
about the 1900-1920s set —
Reagan's peers, Red-haters.)
She looked puzzled.
"Maybe some. Not general
ly." Pause. Press lady to the
rescue. "I'm sorry, no more
questions." Jane looked down,
then moved aside and looked
back at me. "Not for the most
part, I don't think."
