Usually we think of the beginning
of a new quarter as a fresh start, a
chance to try new things, different
classes and other interests. We also
tend to forget events of last quarter
(like grades) as we get caught up in
our new ventures. The usual trend is
to come back from Christmas break
and become complacent about such
things as property security and per-

sonal safety. It is fairly easy to do this
since when we are at home we usual
ly don't have to worry about walking
alone or leaving our rooms un
locked. However, this type of think
ing is a luxury we cannot let ourselves
afford.
Two days after most of us returned
to school a woman was raped â€” the
seventh sexual assault this school
year. However, we should think of
the attack as more than a rape; we
should think of it as a warning that
the events of last quarter cannot be

ignored. An effort must be made
again this quarter to confront the
threat of sexual assault.
Because of campus concern, com
munity rape awareness was extreme
ly high fall quarter. It was an aware
ness which covered a broad area of
the rape problem, socially as well as
practically, and which educated the
campus as a whole to a great degree.

Sexual assault was seen as a com
munity problem and Stanford, as a
community, made a concerted effort
to fight back, not only against the
problem of sexual assault, but also
against the type of thinking which to
lerates it in any form. Yet even
though campus awareness was at its
peak, the danger was unfortunately
still with us, then and now. In the
midst of all this concern and danger
were people who still did not put the
awareness into action and many
more who won't this quarter.
The level of campus awareness is

critical to the prevention of attacks,
but more so is the responsibility of
each of us to take the concern one
step further and put it into action on
an individual level. Unfortunately,

men. It means that we have to avoid
places or situations which may be
dangerous, such as walking alone at
night. It means that we may have to
extend ourselves a little more so that
our friends and the people around us
do not have to travel alone if they do
not wish to. But most importantly, it
means that each of us must take an
individual initiative to fight the prob
lem. Be observant! Call 911 (or 9-911
from University phones) if you see
anything suspicious anywhere. The
police would rather respond to a to

formed after it is too late.
It is not enough simply to be aware
of the problem and all of its aspects.
Each of us has a responsibility to
ourselves and those around us to
make our lives safer, even if it does
tend to be inconvenient at times. It
shouldn't have to be that way, but it is
and we must deal with it. The Stan
ford community as a whole has risen
to an important level of concern and
awareness. Let us not lose this level of
concern, but extend it into action.
