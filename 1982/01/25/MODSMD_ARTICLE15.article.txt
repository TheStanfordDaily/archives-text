## Uranium standard: impertinent, quick-fix — but why not? 
### 
One would think that William Jennings
Bryan, or at least Richard Nixon, would put
the idea to rest, but we now see Rep. Jack
Kemp (R-New York) and other conservatives
proposing a return to the gold standard.
Most economists see the standard as a silly
idea that artifically and arbitrarily limits the
size of the money supply. The essential con
cept behind the gold standard is not that the
currency be redeemable for a specific
amount of gold, but rather that it be fixed to
any scarce, slowly produced commodity.
Though the gold standard seems to be an
anachronism and not a serious proposal for
controling the money supply, the idea of
making currency redeemable for a given
amount of something had merit, provided
the right something is chosen. Nothing writ
ten by Edmund Burke, Milton Friedman or
Voltaire says only gold would work asthe an
nointed previous commodity, so why not
use my choice: uranium.
Since the United States contains large ura
nium deposits, we would not be compelled
to secure foreign lines of supply for our cur
rency backer (as we would with gold).

Granted, other major foreign sources of ura
nium such as Czechoslovakia and South
Africa would gain some undue economic
power from the uranium standard, but the
United States could greatly increase her sup
ply if necessary and not import a single
pound of the stuff.
Further, a system to control the domestic
enriched uranium supply already exists. Al
though mining and refining are done by
private industry, the final enriching process
takes place at a government facility. If only
enriched uranium was used to back the
dollar, the federal government could easily
control the supply. (Of course, private own
ership of enriched uranium would be illegal
under the plan anyway.)
The plan also follows President Ronald
Reagan's policy of promoting private in
dustry. Following a boom period during the
1960s and early 19705, uranium prices
plunged to industry-paralyzing lows. Further
stunned by a massive antitrust suit and the
Three Mile Island incident, production com
panies such as Anaconda and Gulf laid off
large numbers of workers and radically

curtailed mining activity in the late 19705. By
giving uranium a new purpose the industry
could be resurrected, the miners re-em
ployed and, if you believe in David Stock
man's magic trickle-down theory, the poor
would enjoy economic prosperity.
All superficial sarcasm aside, the revival of
the uranium industry would directly benefit
an impoverished minority. A vast majority of
American uranium comes from the Navajo

Imagine a latter-day
William Jennings Bryan —
'Von shall not crucify
mankind upon a cross of
uranium/

Indian Reservation region of northwestern
New Mexico. Before the price plunge min
ing corporations employed native Ameri
cans as miners.
The entire scene looks like the Reagan

dream of private industry moving vigorously
into a previously abandoned market and re
employing thousands of destitute minority
members — all this using neither transfer
payment nor endowment.
The secondary benefits of a uranium stan
dard are even more intriguing than the pri
mary ones. The federal government could
relax security around enriched uranium
storage as its natural radioactivity would de
ter theives.
Terrorist attempts at stealing the uranium
would present some problems, though. Af
ter all, the uranium could still be used in a
bomb. But preventing weapons prolifera
tion has never been a Reagan priority.
Additionally, the threat of domestic nucle
ar power would disappear as uranium be
came valuable as a currency backing com
modity. A conventional nuclear reactor un
der the uranium standard makes as much
sense as a gold-fired generator (if there
could be such a thing) during the 19205,
when the gold standard wasacommon mon
etary policy.
Of course, none of this makes much sense

because pegging a currency, whether to
gold, uranium or the number of presidential
advisors from the Hoover Institution makes
no sense. This proposal is now what it has
always been: an impertinent, economically
depressive quick-fix scheme for serious
problems. Kemp would do better to spend
his time restructuring the Social Security Sys
tems and trying to cut real growth in the fed
eral deficit.
Somehow though, I still find myself
wedded to the idea of a uranium standard, if
only to open the door for some stellar
rhetoric in 1984. Imagine a latter-day William
Jennings Bryan standing before a throng at
the Democratic National Convention. The
crowd is hushed as he concludes an im
passioned speech; "you shall not press down
upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns,
you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of
uranium."
Nomination would undoubtedly come on
the first ballot.
