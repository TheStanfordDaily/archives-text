## Hang banner to protest nuclear warfare

"The splitting of the atom has
changed everything save our modes
of thinking, and thus we drift toward
unparalleled catastrophe."
— Albert Einstein
Man's drift toward catastrophe has
become a race. In 1982, countries of
the world will spend more than $600
billion on military and arms build
up; that's $150 for every man, woman
and child on earth. Yet a look back
upon modern history offers no ex
ample of rival powers arming on such
a massive scale without hostility as
the outcome. All that sets us apart
from pre-World War II history is that
today we possess a force much
greater than any we have ever
known; that, if used, could destroy us
in numbers so staggering that we can
hardly grasp their significance.
The Hiroshima bomb, a "fire
cracker" by today's standards, killed
an estimated 100,000 people out of a
population of 250,000. The United
States presently has 9000 nuclear
weapons in its strategic forces, the
smallest of which is three times the
size of the A-bombs that fell on
Hiroshima.
In the years since Hiroshima, every
president from Dwight Eisenhower
to Jimmy Carter has reminded us that
there are no winners in a nuclear war.
But the Reagan administration has
broken from that traditional attitude;
the new administration talks more
about preparing for World War 111
than workingto preserve the delicate
balance of post-World War II peace.
Eugene Rostow, the man selected by
President Ronald Reagan to head the
Nuclear Arms and Disarmament
Agency, recently said, "We are living
in a pre-war and not a post-war
world."
When asked by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee if either super
power could survive a nuclear ex
change, Rostow replied, "Japan, af
ter all, not only survived but
flourished after the attack." Later, a
senator asked what would likely be
left of the two superpowers in the

event of such a war; Rostow replied
that there would be "10 million
(dead) on one side and 100 million
dead on the other side, but that is not
the whole population."
We are left to conclude, as did
Alexander Haig and George Bush
(though Bush later retracted), that
the side which lost only 10 million be
considered the "winner."
Such talk has not fallen on deaf
ears. In November 1981, 500,000
gathered in Amsterdam to rally
against the presence of U.S. nuclear
missiles on Dutch soil. Similar rallies
have taken place all across the conti
nent, in both Eastern and Western
Europe. Opposition in the United
States is beginning to grow. Here in
California, for example, 200,000 sig
natures have been collected in the
first six weeks in a petition drive
aimed at placing an invitiative on this
November's ballot, calling for a
bilateral freeze on nuclear weapons
production and testing.
One organization that has
emerged as a significant voice of op
position in this country is a group of
doctors called Physicians for Social
Responsibility. PSR's objective is to
"reduce the likelihood of nuclear
war by raising public consciousness
about its medical consequences."

Stanford is a highly respected university, in
many senses a national leader; local and
national press will not miss such a spectacle,
and our message to the country and the world
will not go unheard.

Group membership has grown from
just a few hundred two years ago to
more than 8000 today. An important
reason behind that exponential
growth is that the group is neither
liberal nor conservative. Its members
are instead pragmatists, whose views
have been shaped not by ideology or
political philosophy but by rational
examination of the facts.

Those facts are both astonishing
and terrifying: two 20-megatons
dropped on the San Francisco Bay
Area — the Bay Area, by the way, is a
prime nuclear target, as we are the
home of much of the nation's de
fense technology — would kill 3.4
out of the region's 3.6 million people
(that includes Palo Alto!). Of the sur
vivors, a majority of whom would suf
fer a combination of third-degree
burns, broken limbs, blindness and
ruptured eardrums, few would re
ceive medical attention, for the doc
tors not killed by the blast would be
in the same condition as everyone
else. Survivors would then face the
task of disposing of thousands of hu
man corpses.
Again, Einstein said that "the split
ting of the atom has changed ev
erything, save our modes of think
ing"; the task of our generation, if it
is to survive, is to adjust our modes of
thinking to the level dictated by the
nearly limitless destructive power of
our nuclear capabilities.
Reagan recently said he'd "nego
tiate as long as necessary to reduce
the numbers of nuclear weapons to a
point where neither side threatens
the other." I urge that we, the people
of the Stanford community, makeev
ery effort to see that Reagan initiates
such negotiations.

To this end, I suggest: 1.) that each
Stanford residence make up a large
banner proclaiming house opposi
tion to the proliferation of nuclear
arms in America and throughout the
world, and that it say MUTUAL NU
CLEAR DISARMAMENT FOR WE
THE PEOPLE; and 2.) that this banner
hang in a visible area on each Univer
sity house (I urge off-campus houses

to do the same).
hnally, and perhaps most impor
tant: 3.) that those houses choosing
not to hang a banner be considered
endorsing the present nuclear arms
status quo. I see two reasons for not
hanginga banner: actually endorsing
the status quo or being apathetic.
The second reason is wholly unac
ceptable. This issue is so pressing and
so all-encompassing that apathy can
only be interpreted as not caring
enough to strive for change. As the
old maxim goes, if you are not part of
the solution, you are part of the prob
lem.
You may ask, "What will a banner
do?"
Indian leader Mohandas Ghandi
once said that "almost anything you
do will be insignificant; but it is very
important that you do it." Likewise, a
single banner will be, in itself, in
significant. But combined with simi
lar banners all over campus, yours
will contribute to a force that in its
unity of message will be irresistibly
powerful. Stanford is a highly re
spected university, in many senses a
national leader; local and national
press will not miss such a spectacle,
and our message to the country and
to the world will not go unheard.
My most urgent request is that you
and your house make a decision:
either decide to put up a banner or
not to put up a banner. Do not let this
proposal die an apathetic death!
I also urge you to set aside an hour
or two this week to research the is
sue. Your R. A. has the literature: seek
him or her outl Bring literature to
your house meeting, so your house
can make decisions based on fact and
not on hearsay or political per
suasion. If you study this predica
ment in earnest and aspire to true vi
sion of what a nuclear war really is
and how perilously close we are to
such a war, then I think you will re
alize how desperately important it is
that we work to end our race toward
unparalleled catastrophe.

event of such a war; Rostow replied
that there would be "10 million
(dead) on one side and 100 million
dead on the other side, but that is not
the whole population."
We are left to conclude, as did
Alexander Haig and George Bush
(though Bush later retracted), that
the side which lost only 10 million be
considered the "winner."
Such talk has not fallen on deaf
ears. In November 1981, 500,000
gathered in Amsterdam to rally
against the presence of U.S. nuclear
missiles on Dutch soil. Similar rallies
have taken place all across the conti
nent, in both Eastern and Western
Europe. Opposition in the United
States is beginning to grow. Here in
California, for example, 200,000 sig
natures have been collected in the
first six weeks in a petition drive
aimed at placing an invitiative on this
November's ballot, calling for a
bilateral freeze on nuclear weapons
production and testing.
One organization that has
emerged as a significant voice of op
position in this country is a group of
doctors called Physicians for Social
Responsibility. PSR's objective is to
"reduce the likelihood of nuclear
war by raising public consciousness
about its medical consequences."

Stanford is a highly respected university, in
many senses a national leader; local and
national press will not miss such a spectacle,
and our message to the country and the world
will not go unheard.

Group membership has grown from
just a few hundred two years ago to
more than 8000 today. An important
reason behind that exponential
growth is that the group is neither
liberal nor conservative. Its members
are instead pragmatists, whose views
have been shaped not by ideology or
political philosophy but by rational
examination of the facts.

Those facts are both astonishing
and terrifying: two 20-megatons
dropped on the San Francisco Bay
Area — the Bay Area, by the way, is a
prime nuclear target, as we are the
home of much of the nation's de
fense technology — would kill 3.4
out of the region's 3.6 million people
(that includes Palo Alto!). Of the sur
vivors, a majority of whom would suf
fer a combination of third-degree
burns, broken limbs, blindness and
ruptured eardrums, few would re
ceive medical attention, for the doc
tors not killed by the blast would be
in the same condition as everyone
else. Survivors would then face the
task of disposing of thousands of hu
man corpses.
Again, Einstein said that "the split
ting of the atom has changed ev
erything, save our modes of think
ing"; the task of our generation, if it
is to survive, is to adjust our modes of
thinking to the level dictated by the
nearly limitless destructive power of
our nuclear capabilities.
Reagan recently said he'd "nego
tiate as long as necessary to reduce
the numbers of nuclear weapons to a
point where neither side threatens
the other." I urge that we, the people
of the Stanford community, makeev
ery effort to see that Reagan initiates
such negotiations.

To this end, I suggest: 1.) that each
Stanford residence make up a large
banner proclaiming house opposi
tion to the proliferation of nuclear
arms in America and throughout the
world, and that it say MUTUAL NU
CLEAR DISARMAMENT FOR WE
THE PEOPLE; and 2.) that this banner
hang in a visible area on each Univer
sity house (I urge off-campus houses

to do the same).
hnally, and perhaps most impor
tant: 3.) that those houses choosing
not to hang a banner be considered
endorsing the present nuclear arms
status quo. I see two reasons for not
hanginga banner: actually endorsing
the status quo or being apathetic.
The second reason is wholly unac
ceptable. This issue is so pressing and
so all-encompassing that apathy can
only be interpreted as not caring
enough to strive for change. As the
old maxim goes, if you are not part of
the solution, you are part of the prob
lem.
You may ask, "What will a banner
do?"
Indian leader Mohandas Ghandi
once said that "almost anything you
do will be insignificant; but it is very
important that you do it." Likewise, a
single banner will be, in itself, in
significant. But combined with simi
lar banners all over campus, yours
will contribute to a force that in its
unity of message will be irresistibly
powerful. Stanford is a highly re
spected university, in many senses a
national leader; local and national
press will not miss such a spectacle,
and our message to the country and
to the world will not go unheard.
My most urgent request is that you
and your house make a decision:
either decide to put up a banner or
not to put up a banner. Do not let this
proposal die an apathetic death!
I also urge you to set aside an hour
or two this week to research the is
sue. Your R. A. has the literature: seek
him or her outl Bring literature to
your house meeting, so your house
can make decisions based on fact and
not on hearsay or political per
suasion. If you study this predica
ment in earnest and aspire to true vi
sion of what a nuclear war really is
and how perilously close we are to
such a war, then I think you will re
alize how desperately important it is
that we work to end our race toward
unparalleled catastrophe.

political science.)
"The splitting of the atom has
changed everything save our modes
of thinking, and thus we drift toward
unparalleled catastrophe."
— Albert Einstein
Man's drift toward catastrophe has
become a race. In 1982, countries of
the world will spend more than $600
billion on military and arms build
up; that's $150 for every man, woman
and child on earth. Yet a look back
upon modern history offers no ex
ample of rival powers arming on such
a massive scale without hostility as
the outcome. All that sets us apart
from pre-World War II history is that
today we possess a force much
greater than any we have ever
known; that, if used, could destroy us
in numbers so staggering that we can
hardly grasp their significance.
The Hiroshima bomb, a "fire
cracker" by today's standards, killed
an estimated 100,000 people out of a
population of 250,000. The United
States presently has 9000 nuclear
weapons in its strategic forces, the
smallest of which is three times the
size of the A-bombs that fell on
Hiroshima.
In the years since Hiroshima, every
president from Dwight Eisenhower
to Jimmy Carter has reminded us that
there are no winners in a nuclear war.
But the Reagan administration has
broken from that traditional attitude;
the new administration talks more
about preparing for World War 111
than workingto preserve the delicate
balance of post-World War II peace.
Eugene Rostow, the man selected by
President Ronald Reagan to head the
Nuclear Arms and Disarmament
Agency, recently said, "We are living
in a pre-war and not a post-war
world."
When asked by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee if either super
power could survive a nuclear ex
change, Rostow replied, "Japan, af
ter all, not only survived but
flourished after the attack." Later, a
senator asked what would likely be
left of the two superpowers in the

home of much of the nation's de
fense technology — would kill 3.4
out of the region's 3.6 million people
(that includes Palo Alto!). Of the sur
vivors, a majority of whom would suf
fer a combination of third-degree
burns, broken limbs, blindness and
ruptured eardrums, few would re
ceive medical attention, for the doc
tors not killed by the blast would be
in the same condition as everyone
else. Survivors would then face the
task of disposing of thousands of hu
man corpses.
Again, Einstein said that "the split
ting of the atom has changed ev
erything, save our modes of think
ing"; the task of our generation, if it
is to survive, is to adjust our modes of
thinking to the level dictated by the
nearly limitless destructive power of
our nuclear capabilities.
Reagan recently said he'd "nego
tiate as long as necessary to reduce
the numbers of nuclear weapons to a
point where neither side threatens
the other." I urge that we, the people
of the Stanford community, makeev
ery effort to see that Reagan initiates
such negotiations.

To this end, I suggest: 1.) that each
Stanford residence make up a large
banner proclaiming house opposi
tion to the proliferation of nuclear
arms in America and throughout the
world, and that it say MUTUAL NU
CLEAR DISARMAMENT FOR WE
THE PEOPLE; and 2.) that this banner
hang in a visible area on each Univer
sity house (I urge off-campus houses

to do the same).
hnally, and perhaps most impor
tant: 3.) that those houses choosing
not to hang a banner be considered
endorsing the present nuclear arms
status quo. I see two reasons for not
hanginga banner: actually endorsing
the status quo or being apathetic.
The second reason is wholly unac
ceptable. This issue is so pressing and
so all-encompassing that apathy can
only be interpreted as not caring
enough to strive for change. As the
old maxim goes, if you are not part of
the solution, you are part of the prob
lem.
You may ask, "What will a banner
do?"
Indian leader Mohandas Ghandi
once said that "almost anything you
do will be insignificant; but it is very
important that you do it." Likewise, a
single banner will be, in itself, in
significant. But combined with simi
lar banners all over campus, yours
will contribute to a force that in its
unity of message will be irresistibly
powerful. Stanford is a highly re
spected university, in many senses a
national leader; local and national
press will not miss such a spectacle,
and our message to the country and
to the world will not go unheard.
My most urgent request is that you
and your house make a decision:
either decide to put up a banner or
not to put up a banner. Do not let this
proposal die an apathetic death!
I also urge you to set aside an hour
or two this week to research the is
sue. Your R. A. has the literature: seek
him or her outl Bring literature to
your house meeting, so your house
can make decisions based on fact and
not on hearsay or political per
suasion. If you study this predica
ment in earnest and aspire to true vi
sion of what a nuclear war really is
and how perilously close we are to
such a war, then I think you will re
alize how desperately important it is
that we work to end our race toward
unparalleled catastrophe.
