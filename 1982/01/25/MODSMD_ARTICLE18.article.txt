## Conflicting policy sparks jobdrop 
### Washington Post 
Washington— Has economic policy
turned upside down?
Unemployment, already 8.9 percent of
the work force at the end of last year, is
likely to be higher this year than in any oth
er since 1941, while inflation is clearly com
ing down from the peaks of the Carter
years. What the economy needs, one
might think, is stimulus, pump-priming.
Yet the Congress returning to town this
week will be asked by President Ronald
Reagan to act in the opposite way and
make further deep cuts in domestic spend
ing in fiscal 1983, which begins Oct. 1.
These cuts are likely to hit particularly
hard at social programs that have been the
traditional balm of the poor and un
employed in recessions. Policy-makers
also are considering higher taxes.
It is, on the face of it, an extraordinary
response to economic weakness in an
election year. But underneath the Reagan
budget policy may, in these broad eco
nomic terms, be less restrictive than than it
/seems.
One main reason is that last year was ex
traordinary, too. Congress voted the larg
est tax cut in history, worth almost $750
billion between now and 1986. It also ap
proved the beginning of a defense buildup
that will add more than $20 billion to the
military budget this year, fiscal 1982, and
almost $35 billion next year if Reagan has
his way.
These past acts mean that without new
spending cuts or tax increases, fiscal policy
in 1983 and 1984 will be strongly ex
pansionary; even with them it will be
somewhat so. The shift toward stimulus
will get underway in earnestwith thissum
mer's scheduled individual income tax
cuts.
But why should the president and Con
gress be moving to offset that stimulus in

an economy where idle factories and poor
sales outlooks mean that businessmen are
not investing — despite generous new tax
incentives — and the job market is shrink
ing?
Persistent high interest rates are the rea
son.
There has been a basic contradiction in
administration economic policy from the
outset. Budget policy was made expansive
with the 1981 tax cut and defense spending
increases — but money policy as adminis
tered by the Federal Reserve Board was
kept restrictive.
The result of the contradictory policies,
the one feeding demand for funds, the
other constricting their supply, has been
high interest rates. These have in turn
helped bring on the recession.
It is to reduce these rates and help the
economy expand that the president's ad
visers are now urging limited budget re
straint. Without spending cuts and some
tax increase, the likely deficits in fiscal 1983
and 1984 will be quite large; it is the pros
pect of these large future federal credit de
mands that is helping keep long-term rates
high, administration economists say they
believe.
Yet these spending cuts and tax in
creases, whatever they do to long-term in
terest rates, will also have another effect:
they will reduce overall spending power in
the economy, dampening total demand.
They will thus also serve to exacerbate the
recession they are intended to overcome.
The point, in a way, is that money policy
is dominant; fiscal policy is in a box. The
administration and Congress can now
fine-tune the budget all they want but can
not greatly expand the economy while
money remains tight. By this view, even if
budget policy is slightly upside down, it
may not decisively matter.
Almost no one is suggesting that tax in

creases should take effect in this recession
year, although the president wants new
spending cuts to begin in October. But re
strictive policy measures — including tax
increases — should be put in place to nar
row the out-year deficits, according to
those who are seeking to combat high in
terest rates.
The president already has begun to
chafe under the Fed': tight money rule.
But he has not yet made clear whether he
wants more or less money growth.
Last week the president and Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan castigated the Fed
for letting the money supply grow too
rapidly at the end of last year and the be
ginning of this year. It was this upsurge that
has sent interest rates climbing, they say.
But Regan also has complained that
money growth was too slow last year, and
warned that there must be "sufficient"
money expansion this year to allow the
economy to recover strongly.
Most experts believe that this would re
quire a substantial relaxation of money
policy. The president may yet argue for
this. It is high interest rates that Reagan re
ally dislikes, and with the Fed and its mon
ey policy as a handy scapegoat he is likely
to blame uncomfortably high rates on
whatever it is that is happening to the
money supply at any given time, some ob
servers say.
This ambivalence over money policy
probably reflects a fundamental uncer
tainty over the goal of economic policy:
whether the fight against inflation should
take precedence over creating jobs and
holding down unemployment.
Last year Reagan promised Congress
that it could have both more growth and
less inflation. This year it is clear it cannot,
or at least not with present policies, any
more than the Fed can make money grow
both more slowly and more quickly.

Salvaging the pieces
A crane raised aloft last Monday the tail section of the crashed Air Florida jet from
the Potomac River in Washington. The cause of the crash, which killed 78 people, is
still unknown, as flight recorders recovered by divers have failed to disclose clues.
