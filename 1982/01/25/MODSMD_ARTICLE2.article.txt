# ASSU angry at Women's Center over rape whistles
## 
### Cici Oremland 
The ASSU and the Women's Cen
ter are engaged in a heated dispute
over the funding of rape whistles
purchased and distributed on cam
pus last quarter.
Representatives of the ASSU are
upset with the Women's Center for
refusing to help fund the ASSU
project to distribute rape whistles at
no charge to campus women, and for
breaking a "verbal commitment" to
contribute $250 to the project, said
Mark Epstein, senate finance com
mittee chair.
However,the Women's Center
never promised the ASSU any money
for the project and is angry with the
ASSU for buying the whistles before
the group had reached a decision on
the donation, said Trini Tonies,
Women's Center member.
"We (the Women's Center) felt
weird that they hadn't consulted us
first. And (after discussing the issue)
we decided the whistles were not an
effective way to deal with the prob
lem of rape," said Tonies.
Before the ASSU bought the 3000
rape whistles in an effort to combat
the rash of street rapes and at
tempted rapes on campus this year,
Epstein said representatives ap
proached various campus organiza
tions, including the Women's Cen
ter, for contribution commitments to
help offset costs.
Epstein said he approached Sharon
Silverstein, a member of the Wom
en's Center, with the funding pro
posal and that she seemed in favor of
the project. He said he then received
a verbal commitment by telephone
from the center for $250.
"I told Mark (Epstein) I personally
thought it was a good idea," said Sil
verstein. But Silverstein said she told
Epstein she could not speak for the
Women's Center and that no com
mitment was made.
Tonies said the Women's Center
rejected the whistle project because
the members felt they could better
combat the rape problem by starting
a running collective and a self-de
fense class for women, and through
pamphlets and dormitory outreach
programs on rape awareness.
The whistles cost 85 cents each,
and the total cost to the ASSU was
more than $2500. All but 480 whistles
were distributed. The remaining
whistles were sold for $1 each to the
University for its women personnel.
Council of Presidents member
Mariann Byerwalter said, "We
thought about asking the University
for a donation, but they were looking
to buy some whistles so I made them
a deal. At that time I didn't know the
exact cost of the whistles, so we
ended up making a few cents."
The Graduate Student Association
pledged $100 to the project, said Eps
tein. The ASSU assumed, he con
tinued, the whistle project was "a
logical program for the Women's
Center to contribute to."
"We (the Women's Center) felt
community awareness and other
rape safety projects were a better way
to combat the rape problem," said
Tonies.
Silverstein said, "We (the Women's
Center) are dealing with this issue by
looking at the social factors involved
in the business of rape, but we are
also looking at the problem of street
rape through projects like the self
defense class and the running collec
tive."
Byerwalter said the Women's Cen
ter and the ASSU were both trying to
deal with the same issue but were us
ing different methods. "They (the
Women's Center) find measures like
the whistles an insult to women's in
dependence. They have a different
way of looking at the problem. It's
political," she said.
