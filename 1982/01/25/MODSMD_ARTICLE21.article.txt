## Niners take the Super Bowl!

Pontiac, Mich. (AP) — Joe
Montana, displaying the guile
and flair of a riverboat gambler,
engineered two long touch
down drives after San Francis
co's youthful secondary
swiped the ball from the Cin
cinnati Bengals, and the 49ers
rolled to a 26-21 victory Sunday
in Super Bowl XVI.
Montana, executing Coach
Bill Walsh's innovative offense
with electrifying ease, and a
spate of turnovers which kept
Cincinnati off the scoreboard,
helped the 49ers roll to a rec
ord 20-point halftime lead.
The Bengals roared to life
behind quarterback Ken An
derson in the second half, scor
ing on his 5-yard run and two
passes to tight end Dan Ross.
But the difference was a
goal-line stand of epic propor
tions in the third period by the
San Francisco defense — the

third time Cincinnati had been
denied so much as a point
within 10 yards of the 49ers'
end zone.
Ultimately, it was that de
fense, a heady mix of grizzled
veterans and kids just a year off
campus, that carried the 49ers
to one of the most remarkable
turnarounds in National Foot
ball League history. The team,
which just two years ago had
staggered through its second
consecutive 2-14 season,
reached the pinnacle this time
— its first Super Bowl cham
pionship.
Montana, in only his third
year in the NFL, outplayed An
derson, his veteran coun
terpart on the Bengals, in the
first half. He scored the 49ers'
first touchdown on a 1-yard
dive, then passed 10 yards to
fullback Earl Cooper for a sec
ond score.

Each was set up by a Cincin
nati turnover deep in San Fran
cisco territory. Free safety
Dwight Hicks, the only veteran
in the 49ers' secondary, in
tercepted an Anderson pass at
the 5-yard line and ran it out of
danger to the 32. In 11 plays,
one of them a flea-flicker pass
good for 14 yards, Montana put
the 49ers on the scoreboard
with 5:52 remaining in the
opening period.
And 2Vt minutes into the
second quarter, after An
derson had drilled a pass to Cris
Collinsworth at the 49ers' 8-
yard line, Eric Wright stripped
the ball from the Cincinnati
wide receiver and fellow
rookie cornerback Lynn Thom
as pounced on the fumble.
Twelve plays later, Mon
tana's flare pass to Cooper,
who bowled over two Bengals
at the goal line, climaxed the

92-yard scoring drive, the long
est in Super Bowl history.
Having broken one Super
Howl record, the 49ers pro
ceeded to shatter another,
scoring on two Ray Wersching
field goals just 13 seconds apart
in the final minute of the first
half.
The first, a 26-yarder, came
15 seconds short of halftime.
Then, on the kickoff, Cincin
nati's Archie Griffin fumbled
the ball, and so did his brother
Ray. Milt McColl fell on it for
the 49ers, and after an illegal
procedure penalty pushed
them back 5 yards to the 10,
Wersching kicked a 22-yarder
with two seconds left on the
clock.
The two field goals gave the
49ers a 20-0 lead, the most
lopsided halftime score in Su
per Bowl history.
