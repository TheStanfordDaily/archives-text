# Spartans edge out cagewomen

The Cardinal women gave up a hard
fought basketball game Saturday night,
74-65 to the San Jose State lady Spartans at
Maples Pavilion.
In dropping the game Stanford also suf
fered the losses of junior center Kim Kup
ferer and senior forward Jeanne Ruark-
Hoff to injuries. Both players were starters
and extremely valuable for their scoring
power.
Nevertheless, head coach Dotty
McCrea's team rose to the occasion
against the speedy Spartans, playing a fast,
agressive game throughout.
Senior veteran Louise Smith led the first
half and overall scoring, followed closely
by forward Meg Metzger, guard Anne
Miller, and forward Leigh Pederson.
Pederson, not usually a starter, had a par

ticularly outstanding game.
McCrea "needed someone to take up
the slack," said Pederson, commenting on
her new role in view of the absence of Hoff
and Kupferer.
The junior from Sparks, Nev. certainly
accomplished that, racking up eight re
bounds in the first half in assisting the
Cardinal to a close 32-35 halftime score.
The second half was equally as fast, with
San Jose State putting to good use their
outstanding ball-handling and field goal
shooting. Stanford guards Angie Paccione
and Debi Gore played a steadily aggressive
defensive game, opening the door for a
Stanford rally.
At the high point of the scoring flurry
the Cardinal took over the lead by one
point, thanks to freshman Mary Bradach's
perfect foul shooting.

But early in the half speedy forward Meg
Metzger fouled out, putting extra pressure
on Pederson and Smith. Late in the half San
Jose increased the pressure even more.
The Spartans were prepared for battle
against Stanford. San jose head coach
Sharon Ghatman remarked that she re
garded the Cardinal as "the best team in
the NorCal conference," and was extreme
ly pleased with the victory.
Ghatman also remarked that her team
had been playing outstanding basketball
over the past week — she cited high scorer
Sheila Brown (26 points) as an example —
and was in a position to take disadvantage
of the reduced Stanford squad.
"We just needed someone else to put
points on the board," she said. "San Jose
State is known for their intimidating style.
They beat us and they played well."
