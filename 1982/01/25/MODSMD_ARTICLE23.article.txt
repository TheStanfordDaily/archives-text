# Bruins, Trojans shuffle Card hoopsters
## 
### Stevie "Wonder" Odell 
Anyway you look at it, it was
a Super weekend.
That is, unless you're the
Stanford basketball team and
you have just lost your fourth
and fifth straight games of the
season to UCLA and USC. The
Cardinal, which now stands at
1-6 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference and 6-10 overall, did
exactly that, losing to the
Bruins 42-34 Friday night in a
slow-tempo game, and then
getting muscled over by USC
85-74, 15 hours later Saturday
afternoon at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford was able to stay
close in both games, trailing
the Trojans by only two at half
time, and playing to a 20-20 tie
at the intermission against
UCLA. Nevertheless, Stanford,
as has been the case all year,
was hurt by costly turnovers
and hopes for upsets in both
cases were lost as the ball was.
The Cardinal turned the ball
over 15 more times than their
opponents over the weekend.
Saturday, Stanford was be
hind just 29-27 at halftime, only
to be outscored 10-2 by the
Trojans coming out of the
locker room in the regionally
televised contest. USC's
Maurice Williams hit a fast
break lay-up on a pass from
Jacque Hill and followed it up
with a 20-footer to complete
the run and make the score
39-29 with 17:09 remaining.
USC upped it's lead to 20
points midway through the
second half when Trojan guard
Dwight Anderson, who led all
scorers with 26 points, scored
inside and then fed the ball to
freshman forward Clayton
Olivier for a lay-in to make it

70-50. Stanford then put to
gether an eight-point streak,
but never seriously threatened
the Trojans again, whoare now
6-1 in the Pac-10, their best
conference start ffi nine years.
Anderson dissected Stan
ford's 2-3 zone defense, get
ting most of his points inside on
penetrating moves to the
basket. Stanford was led by
sophomore center John Revel
li, who had 22 points and 13 re
bounds. Revelli picked up 14of
his points at the free throw line
while only missing once, and
came within three fouls shots
of the school record.
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
thought the fact his team had
played UCLA less than 24 hours
before the USC game played a
role in the loss.
" The fatigue factor reared its
ugly head in the second half,"
he said."lt showed itself in that
they could penetrate and get
easy lay-ups, especially in the
second half."
But Dißiaso also wanted to

give credit to the outstanding
Trojan guard duo of Anderson
and Hill, calling them "the best
pentetrating guards we've seen
thus far this year." Anderson
and Hill, who combined for 11
assists in the win, also were the
keys by not allowing Stanford
to gain control of the tempo in
the game the way the Cardinal
had effectively done the night
before against UCLA.
Against the Bruins, Stanford
was able to come close to pull
ing a repeat of the upset in
Maples last year by employing
a very controlled and dis
ciplined offense and a
"packed" zone defense, there
by forcing UCLA outside. The
Bruins ignored this strategy in
the first half, shooting from the
perimeter and trying to run the
Cardinal out of the game.
After picking up a 33-30 lead
with 12:22 in the game, how
ever, UCLA decided they
would comply with their foes
and ran over eight minutes off
the clock to boos from the

crowd and snores from the
Band. After the teams traded
turnovers, UCLA finally broke
the ice with two minutes show
ing on the clock when guard
Rod Foster hit two foul shots to
put the Bruins up by a score of
35-30.
Card forward Johnny Rogers
retailitaed with an 18-footer
from the right side to make the
score 35-32 with 1:38 remain
ing and the Maples crowd of
7104 sensed another upset in
the offing.
But then came the play, or
rather misplay, of the game. Af
ter UCLA's Ralph Jackson had
missed the front end of a one
and-one free throw opportuni
ty, Revelli snared the rebound
and Dißiaso quickly called fora
time-out. On the inbounds
play at midcourt, Cardinal for
ward Brian Welch attempted a
pass to Revelli at the center
line.
But UCLA's Darren Daye an
ticipated the play, picked off
the lazy pass, and drove the re

maining half of the court for a
solo lay-in to put his team up by
five.
Welch countered with a driv?
irtg jump shot the other way to
make it 37-34 with 39 seconds
remaining, but the Bruins, now
3-3 in the conference and 9-5
overall, scored the last five
points to salt the game away.
Still, Dißiaso was pleased
with Stanford's effort. "Al
though we lost, I was proud of
our team," he said. "We played
well at Washington State and
again tonight. There are a lot of
ways to win a basketball game,
and this is one way."
"We went into the game
knowing we had to do two
things: control the tempo and
block out," Dißiaso said. "We
had some turnovers, and you
can't afford that in this type of
game. A lot of the turnovers
were by our front line, but we
felt they could do some things
against them."
