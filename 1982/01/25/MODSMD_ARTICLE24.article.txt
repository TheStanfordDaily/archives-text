## 
### Mark Kerber 
Lack of depth hurt the Cardinal wrestlers in
Friday night's 33-11 loss to Chico State, but there
were also individual performances which in
dicated great potential tournament efforts to
come.
The grapplers never quite got things going this
time as they fell behind 27-4 through the first
seven weights before picking up wins from
stalwart Doug Perkins and freshman sensation
Ed Katz.
The Cardinal forfeited 118 pounds, then Tim
Daniels took an unexpected beating at 126, add
ing to Chico's momentum. Daniels, who had run
his record up to 9-1, was shut out until the third
period in a 12-1 major decision to George
Acosta.
Derrick Strahorn temporarily turned the meet

around with a convincing 19-8 win at 134.
Strahorn grabbed a 7-0 lead early in the bout,
then scrambled through a wild third period for
the major decision.
Sophomore Tom Mullen lost a tough match in
the 167-pound bracket. Leading 4-3 entering the
final stanza, Mullen couldn't hold on to Chico
State's Bob McLaughlin.
Team captain and Munby Invitational cham
pion Perkins finally stopped the Chico run at
177. After losing the initial takedown, Perkins
used reversals and back points to wear down
Chico's John Gorman 10-4.
Katz tried out the 190-pound weight class for
the first time and it suited him well. He cruised to
a 13-3 lead before spluttering slightly in a 16-8
major decision.
