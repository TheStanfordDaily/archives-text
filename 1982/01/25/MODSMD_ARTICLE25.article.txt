Pontiac, Mich. (AP) —
Quarterback Joe Montana,
the Most Valuable Player in
Super Bowl XVI, gave
himself a passing grade but
not a high one for his per
formance in San Francisco's
26-21 victory over the Cin
cinnati Bengals yesterday.
Asked what he thought
his mark should be after
completing 14 of 22 passes
for 157 yards, Montana
grinned. "Oh, B-rninus,
maybe C," he said.
Why that low?
"There were times I
should have gotten out of
there on the blitz, times I
could have done better."
Montana said he felt that
the 49ers' Super Bowl vic
tory was a vindication of a
team which was underrated
all year.
"People around the
country still didn't believe
in us," he said, "even after
we beat Dallas, Pittsburgh,
Cincinnati and the others."

Montana was asked if he
ever thought that winning
the Super Bowl could be this
easy.
"Who said it was easy?"
he replied.
The 49ers' quarterback
said his team's poor field
position through much of
the second half dictated a
more conservative play
selection than San Francisco
had used in building a 20-
0 halftime lead.
"We did exactly what
(Coach) Bill (Walsh) told us
not to," he said. "At half
time, we said we can't get
big penalties and let the
momentum switch. But the
first four plays, there were
three penalties in the sec
ond half.
"After that, we had bad
field position and they dic
tated what we could do."
Montana said that the Su
per Bowl victory was not
something the 49ers had
thought about at the begin

ning of the year.
"It was tough to think Su
per Bowl," he said. "We
wanted to improve our rec
ord, that's all. We had three
rookies starting in the de
fensive backfield and me
starting for the first time."
The 49ers posted a 13-3
regular season record, the
best mark in the NFL.
"People didn't believe we
were a playoff team, let
alone where we are now,"
hesaid. "People still weren't
convinced. It was dis
heartening but we stuck to
gether as a unit."
He said that the emotion
of the victory was beginning
to sink in.
"I guess I'll feel it more
when I leave here," he said.
And what can the young
third-year quarterback do
for an encore?
"Hopefully," he said,
"come back here a few
more times."
