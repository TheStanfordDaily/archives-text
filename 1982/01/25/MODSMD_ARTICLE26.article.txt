Malathion study urged
Los Angeles — In the wake of millions of
dollars in damage claims and charges of a scien
tific cover-up, state officials have begun to con
sider a test of the long-term effects of 160,000
gallons of Mediterranean fruit fly insecticide
sprayed over Californians in the last year.
California faces enormous economic losses if
the Medfly is not eradicated, and government
officials, bolstered by reports from top scientists
that malathion does little harm in small doses,
have been unusually sensitive toanystatements
that might create more public protests to use of
the pesticide.
Melvin Reuber, a board-certified pathologist
whose work helped lead toa federal banon two
other pesticides, said he was forced to resign
from a government research laboratory last
year after he challenged research that led to a
National Cancer Institute conclusion that
malathion did not cause cancer.
A letter from Reuber's supervisor said his
"obstreperous actions" had a "multimillion
dollar implication" for California's agriculture
industry, the state's leading money-maker.
A California state pathologist, Marc Lappe,
was removed as head of the hazard evaluation
unit of the health services department after he
publicly disclosed an internal study that made
malathion look riskier than the department had
said it was.
Lappe's research unit had initially reported
that the spraying posed minimal risk to humans,
but he said in a recent interview that the
assessment was based on six malathion
sprayings, not the 15 sprayings that have been
carried out in some parts of the Bay Area.
Italian communists reproved
Moscow — The Kremlin yesterday virtually
excommunicated the leaders of the Italian
Communist Party from the world communist
movement by accusing them of having re
nounced Marxism-Leninism as well as "ev
erything that links them" to other Communist
parties, thus rendering "direct aid to im
perialism."
A Soviet Communist Party statement accused
the Italian Communist leaders of "monstrous"
and "truly sacrilegious" positions taken since
the Dec. 13 military crackdown in Poland. It sin
gled out Enrico Berlinguer, the party's general
secretary, and three other members of its lead
ership, Pietro Ingrad, Giorgio Napolitano and
Alfredo Reihlin.
The Soviet stand against the Italian party, the
largest in the West, was expected to produce a
new debate in the world communist move
ment.
The 2500-word statement issued yesterday
was similar in tone and content to major Soviet
ideological pronouncements such as the 1948
excommunication of MarshalTito of Yugoslavia
and the subsequent rift that opened with China
in the early 19605.
Yesterday's statement said the Italian Com
munist leaders in recent years have stated their
"special position" on various problems, advan
cing the notions of "Eurocommunism," "the al
liance of Euroleftists" and the "third way" to so
cialism.
The statement, published in the official party
newspaper Pravda, said these positions con
stituted a blow to the Italian Communist Party
because they "run counter to the interests of
peace, the interests of socialism."
The statement appears to be the climax of a
long ideological struggle between the Kremlin
and the Italian party over a new and more

modern mode of communism championed by
the Italians.
Archbishop reassures Poles
Warsaw — Roman Catholic Archbishop Jozef
Glemp yesterday pleaded with Poles not to de
spair about martial law and said church efforts
to free political prisoners were "not without
fruit."
Priests in pulpits across Poland read a church
letter condemning the Communist govern
ment and demanding freedom for interned
workers and dissidents.
"Brothers and sisters," said the archbishop,
"pray for those who suffer, pray for all de
tainees to be quickly released, lift up your
hearts."
In a homily broadcast from Warsaw's Holy
Cross Church, Glemp did not call for an end to
martial law, but told countrymen to "follow a
path of truth,"and said "we must lift ourselves
from the depths only by ourselves."
Communist Premier Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski imposed martial law Dec. 13 to ban
strikes, jail dissidents, curb civil rights and sus
pend the independent Solidarity union after 16
months of labor trouble and economic crisis.
Thousands remain detained and others have
been fired for refusing to resign from the union
or take loyalty oaths.
Since the crackdown, the church has
emerged as a major force of conciliation be
tween the government and Poland's 36 million
people, 95 percent of whom are devout Roman
Catholics.
Resistance group surfaces
Warsaw — An underground document sur
faced here yesterday, claiming that the leaders
of the suspended Solidarity independent trade
union still at large have formed an "All-Polish
Resistance Committee' to carry on the move
ment's cause until martial law is lifted and Solid
ritv can again operate legally.
The document, the authenticity of which was
impossible to verify, said that members of the
union's National Commission who have so far
avoided arrest met Jan. 13 and "selected the
most optimal form and ways of operation under
conspiratorial conditions."
It identified the leader of the underground
group as "Mieszko" — a pseudonym taken
from the name of the 10th-century Polish king
who brought Catholicism to the nation.
The document did not outline a specific pro
gram, but it said the group "takes the responsi
bility for coordinating the conspiratorial opera
tion in the country." It asked other top Solidar
ity leaders who did not attend the Jan. 13 meet
ing to make contact with the new organization.
There was no indication of how such contact
should be made, nor any hint about where the
resistance committee met.
The typescript announcement surfaced on
the eve of what is billed as a major speech by the
martial-law chief, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
before Parliament today. Jaruzelski is expected
to announce further relaxation of martial-law
rules and to suggest the kind of political solu
tion he sees for the country's continuing crisis.
Kissinger warns the West
Washington — Former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger suggested yesterday that the
Atlantic alliance could gradually disintegrate
unless it is able to demonstrate greater unity in
addressing global crises.
Kissinger said there are not even the "begin

nings of a consensus" within the alliance on
problems such as East-West relations, Central
America. Africa and the Middle East.
"How long can this continue?," Kissinger
asked. "We can let it drift, holding periodic
meetings, reaffirming liturgical unity, papering
over crises that exist and I dare say this can go on
for many years but it cannot go on forever."
He spoke to a gathering of The Committee
for a Free World, a private group which ad
vocates a conservative foreign policy.
Kissinger said a basic issue facing the alliance
is, "how much unity do we want and how much
diversity can we stand. There must be some lim
its that the necessity of common action places
on the unilateral decisions of the participants.
"If that limit leads to what I have described as
the consensus of the fearful, if it leads to paral
ysis and inaction, then the alliance will gradu
ally disintegrate because it will not be relevant
to most of the issues that arise."
As one possible option, he said the U.S. gov
ernment should consider proposing a review of
the alliance with a view toward redefining its
purposes.
Reagan to form policy council
Washington — President Ronald Reagan has
decided to establish a Cabinet council to coor
dinate legal and law enforcement policies that
affect several departments, a White House
spokesman said yesterday.
Although the decision comes after criticism
of the administration for appearing to change
signals on the Equal Rights Amendment and on
tax exemptions for private schools that racially
discriminate, both White House and Justice De
partment spokesmen said the idea had been
under discussion before those issues arose.
Arms sales show sharp rise
Washington — With the United States lead
ing the way, worldwide sales of military arms
have more than doubled in the last decade, and
have become, in many instances, the primary
instrument of diplomatic relations between ma
jor powers and the Third World.
This is the central conclusion of a four-year
study done under the auspices of the Council
on Foreign Relations by Andrew Pierre, a
former State Department official and re
searcher at the Brookings Institution and the
Hudson Institute.
"Arms sales...have become the common coin
of contemporary world politics," Pierre con
cludes in a 353-page book, The Global Politics
of Arms Sales.
He predicts that trends established in the
1970s and accelerated under the Reagan admin
istration will see continued escalation in de
mands by developing nations to buy more —
and ever more sophisticated — military hard
ware.
Between 1970 and 1980, according to Pierre's
research, worldwide arms deliveries escalated
from $9 billion a year to $20 billion. Total U.S.
sales during the decade — including both de
liveries and backlog — rose from $1.1 billion to
more than $16 billion. The United States now
has a backlog — weapons sold but not yet de
livered — totaling about $50 billion.
