Staff lunch
All writers, photogs and other staf
fers (editors of both the current and
upcoming volumes, for example) are
cordially invited to a brown-bag staff
lunch tomorrow at noon. There's lots
of business to get done, but the edi
tor promises special surprises to
more than make up for the lack of
food.
Edit board
Did you ever wonder who writes
the Daily editorials? You — that is,
anyone at all — can run foroneof the

three at-large positions on the Daily
editorial board, which determines
and produces the paper's editorials.
We encourage anyone — excep
tional students, brilliant professors,
outspoken staff or community mem
bers, daring administrators and "dark
genius" former presidents of the
United States — to present your case
to the staff. By Wednesday, submit a
statement of candidacy and anything
else you want posted. On Thursday,
speak to the staff at lunch (therefore,
folks, there will be a staff lunch on
Thursday, too) before the election on
the same day.
