# McCloskey questions the Israeli lobby

### Richard Zimler 
United States Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), a declared candidate for the U.S. Senate,
said yesterday that lobbying efforts in Congress
designed to promote unconditional support for Is
rael are not necessarily in America's best interest.
"My problem with the Jewish community ... is
that it is interested in only one thing — the survival
of Israel," he told the crowd of 125 in San Francisco
at the annual Symposium on Public Affairs of the
Zionist Organization of America. "But the United
States has much broader interests than this nation
we want to preserve. The interests of Israel and the
United States may not be the same."
McCloskey, debating fellow Rep. Philip Burton
(D-San Francisco), reiterated his belief that Arab

leaders tacitly recognize the right of Israel to exist,
and that lobbying efforts which do not accept this
premise are not realistic.
"The Saudi Emirate and Palestinian leaders, in
my judgment, all accept the right of Israel to exist,"
he said.
As to why these leaders publicly deny Israel's
statehood, McCloskey added, "The Arab leader
who concedes Israel's right to exist will be as
sassinated.
"I amnot privy to what Arafat has whispered, but
I do know what the PLO's (Palestinian Liberation
Organization) basic charter states — to eliminate
the state of Israel," Burton countered. "We ought
to accept their word ... that that is what they have
in mind ...

"How much can we ask of Israel until these
neighbors demonstrate by actions that Israel has
the right to exist?" he added. "I believe we must
judge people according to their actions."
McCloskey, who has received much recent an
tagonism for his criticism of groups lobbying for
support of Israel — the Israeli lobby, as he calls
them — expressed his belief that there has been a
softening of attitudes toward Israel since 1967 on
the part of Arab moderates such as Saudi Arabia.
He said that the United States needs to support
these moderates against the Soviet Union and its
radical Middle Eastern allies who pose the real
threat to Israel.
