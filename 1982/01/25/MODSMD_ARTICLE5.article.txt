Even though the price of land in the Bay Area is sky
rocketingand many feel that demand forhousingissuch
that large open spaces are disappearing faster than a cold
beer on a hot day, the need for "a certain amount of
space — room to breathe" has not abated.
It is this need that the Midpeninsula Regional Open
Space District (MROSD), founded 10 years ago, is trying
to fill, according to Phyllis Cangemi, organizer of last
night's "Community Forum on Open Space" in Menlo
Park.
The MROSD, which covers northwestern Santa Clara
and southern San Mateo counties, currently manages 15
"open space preserves" totaling more than 10,000 acres.
These include 180 acres of foothills along Page Mill Road
and the 40-acre San Mateo County Baylands Reserve in
East Palo Alto.
Most of the discussion at the meeting centered on one
piece of land known as "the hill." It is a 38-acre parcel in
Sharon Heights which is owned by a private en
trepreneur who wants to develop the land despite an En
vironmental Impact Report (EIR) which has raised
doubts about its safety and stability.
' Other questions cast shadows on the proposed de
velopment of both "the hill" and the Edgewood Park site
just north of Redwood City, according to Bruce Wilcox, a
research associate in the University's Biological Sciences
Department. "There are some animals indigenous to the
region which can't survive, for the most part, outside
their natural habitats."
As in most land-acquisition cases, though, money
which developers have in abundance and limited re
sources of which the MROSD must spend guardedly
will play a key role in determining the fate of "the hill"
and of the dozen or so state-endangered species which
inhabit the area, members of the organization said. One
of the indigenous plants which may be affected by the
decisions is the Toyon berry, an especially effective natu
ral protection against soil erosion.
Public opposition to development of this land is weak
ening now, however, because of poor land man
agement, according to Cangemi. Motorcyclists and four

wheel drive vehicles regularly disturb nearby residents,
and people want to "do anything, but get out of this state
of limbo," observed Cangemi.
"Strict new San Mateo County ordinances may al
leviate the problem," said ecologist Susan Sommers.
"They include impounding the offending vehicles and
possible fines and even short jail terms," she said.
Robert Augsberger, executive director for The Penin
sula Open Space Trust, and former vice president for
business and finance at Stanford, described the trust as
"the facilitator of the MROSD" and said it is charged
with "preserving and protecting the Peninsula land
scape."
Augsberger said the trust seeks to achieve these ends
through acquisition for open space uses, "voluntary
stewardship programs" (whereby private landowners
agree to place conservation restrictions upon their prop
erty), and "creative development" of land."
