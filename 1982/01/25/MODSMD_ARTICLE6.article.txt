A University administrator is dis
cussing with the FBI the un
authorized use of the Computer Sci
ence Department research computer
system, the Daily has learned.
Ralph Gorin, computer facilities
director of the department, said last
night the University is attempting to
investigate how an unauthorized
person has gained access to informa
tion which is contained in the Uni
versity computer system.
Both the Peninsula Times Tribune
and The Mercury News reported that
the FBI has begun preliminary in
vestigation of the unauthorized use
of the system. Gorin would not say
whether the FBI had begun an in
vestigation, announcing only that he
had met with FBI officials.
"The incident is still under in
vestigation (by the University)," said
Gorin.
FBI officials were not available for
comment.

used for general research by the De
partment of Defense, the National
Institute of Health and the National
Science Foundation, among others.
None of the information contained
in the system is classified, but some of
it may be "sensitive," according to
Gorin, who added, "you can define
sensitive information however you
want to."
Ralph Muerkle, a noted security
expert on the computer systems, said
it was unlikely that any classified in
formation was contained in the sys
tem.
