# Unauthorized computer use investigated
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
A University administrator is dis
cussing with the FBI the un
authorized use of the Computer Sci
ence Department research computer
system, the Daily has learned.
Ralph Gorin, computer facilities
director of the department, said last
night the University is attempting to
investigate how an unauthorized
person has gained access to informa
tion which is contained in the Uni
versity computer system.
Both the Peninsula Times Tribune
and The Mercury News reported that
the FBI has begun preliminary in
vestigation of the unauthorized use
of the system. Gorin would not say
whether the FBI had begun an in
vestigation, announcing only that he
had met with FBI officials.
"The incident is still under in
vestigation (by the University)," said
Gorin.
FBI officials were not available for
comment.

partment of Defense, the National
Institute of Health and the National
Science Foundation, among others.
None of the information contained
in the system is classified, but some of
it may be "sensitive," according to
Gorin, who added, "you can define
sensitive information however you
want to."
Ralph Muerkle, a noted security
expert on the computer systems, said
it was unlikely that any classified in
formation was contained in the sys
tem.
"Anyone who had information of a
sensitive nature would have rocks in
his head to put it in a campus com
puter," Muerkle said.
Computer Science Prof. John Mc-
Carthy speculated that the FBI is in
vestigating the theft because some of
the equipment involved belongs to
the government.
Gene Golub, chairman of the
Computer Science Department, ex
plained the incident by saying that
"someone of the East Coast" may
have used someone else's password
to connect into the University com
puter system, which is located in
Margaret Jacks Hall in the Quad.
"People are careless with their
passwords, and the system is broken
into," said McCarthy.
McCarthy also said that the system
is not very secure, but that it has no
"security-related" information. He

said 500 to 600 people have
passwords which could connect
them into the system.
According to McCarthy, the per
petrator probably used a telephone
to call in to the system, using some
one else's password.
McCarthy also said the University
had a similar occurrence seven or
eight years ago, when an un
authorized person used the system.
His calls into the system were traced
and the usage was stopped.
The University, in an effort to pre
vent similar incidents, "built a
stronger fence" around the system
following that infiltration, McCarthy
said.
The system is still not completely
secure, according to McCarthy.
"At great expense we could make
the system secure," Gorin said. "The
University is more interested in re
search, however."
