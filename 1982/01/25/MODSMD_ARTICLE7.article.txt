# Candidate Garamendi criticizes water policy
## 
### Helene Miale 
The state legislature's failure to
take a sound look at its water man
agement legislation — including the
Peripheral Canal project — could
create severe economic and environ
mental problems for California, a
state senator told environmental ac
tivists Saturday at the Peninsula Con
servation Center.
State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Sac
ramento), a gubernatorial candidate
in the June primary, met with several
representatives from local conserva
tion groups during a campaign swing
through the mid-Peninsula over the
weekend.
Garamendi sharply criticized the
bill now under consideration by the
legislature which calls for construc
tion of a major canal to transfer water
from the fertile Sacramento delta re
gion to the arid San Joaquin Valley.
The proposed $11.3 billion project
has encountered opposition from
conservationists who contend that
the bill, SB 200, doesn't contain
enough environmental guarantees.
The farmers in the delta region also
oppose the bill because they say it
would reduce the freshwater flow
from the Sacramento River and
A'ould increase the saltwater flow
from the Bay, making their land less
fertile.
Farmers in the San Joaquin Valley
also are not in favor of the bill, but for
a different reason. They fear the pro
posed canal would not provide
enough water to arid agricultural re
gions and would be used to spur
growth and development in com
mercial area<;
Diana Miller, a board member of
the Committee for Green Foothills,
said she is against building the Per
ipheral Canal primarily for financial
reasons. "The project could con
ceivably bankrupt the state. Propo

nents say only users will pay the costs,
but they wouldn't be able to afford it,
so we'd all have to pay."
Garamendi called the project a
"misallocation of resources" and said
that if the canal were built, thousands
of farmers would be forced out of
work because of the salt intrusion.
The senator, who lives in Walnut
Grove near the Sacramento delta, fa
vors construction of a channel
through the delta to prevent
saltwater inflow
The Sierra Club has said it would
support construction of the Per
ipheral Canal provided a com
prehensive set of water reform meas
ures is established to ensure high wa
ter quality standards. "If water law re
forms were combined with SB 200,
we could live with the whole pack
age," said Robert Mark, a Sierra Club
member and a computer applica
tions specialist for the U.S. Geologi
cal Survey.
Garamendi, often a supporter of
environmental causes, suggested
that a water management program
be implemented to include tapping
the Colorado River, reclamation and
conservation.
Although the environment is not
viewed as his highest campaign
priority, Garamendi has pushed for
much legislation to protect Lake
Tahoe and Mono Lake. He said he
would also like to see tougher regu
lations on toxic waste disposal and
said he supports measures which
would encourage chemical com
panies to reduce toxic waste through
economic incentives.
Garamendi was reelected to the
state senate two years ago and is sen
ate majority leader. In the upcoming
primary, he will oppose Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley, while Lt. Gov.
Mike Curb will oppose George
Duekmajian, the attorney general.
