## Guatemalan civil strife increases, guerilla organs active 
### Washington Post 
Guatemala City — The general's helicopter banked
hard over the clouded forest. The starboard gunner
threw open the door and blasted away with his M-60 ma
chine gun at the trails beneath us, hammering 30-caliber
bullets into fire-scarred Indian settlements and small
plots covered with broken cornstalks.
This was in return for an attack by two or three leftist
rebels on a a small government patrol near here, not far
from the Pan American Highway. Gen. Benedicto Lucas
Garcia's personal helicopter had taken the offensive,
with two journalists aboard.
It was one of countless raids in the guerilla war raging
through northwest Guatemala and rapidly spreading: a
fightforcontrolofthe largest, richest, most populous na
tion in Central America.
On one side is a conservative, military-dominated re
gime that has become an international pariah for its dis
mal human-rights record. On the other are leftist and
Marxist guerrillas, many of whom have links with Havana
and are working hard to win over this nation's Indian
population. The war already has taken on proportions
comparable to the Salvndoran conflict
The rugged countryside with its heavy foliage is
perfect for insurgents. The government's intransigence
on human-rights issues — including its refusal to re
spond substantively to widespread charges that it is re

sponsible for thousands of civilian deaths, or to allow
lecognized international human-rights agencies to visit
the country — has cut it off from military assistance from
the United States. Meanwhile, the economy that was
flourishing only three years ago is slowing down as vio
lence erodes investor confidence.
Disparities
The roots of the war are fixed in desperate economic,
social, cultural, even racial disparities.
Through more than 20 years, the conflict has gone on.
Tens of thousands have died, many of them abducted
and tortured. Some disappeared or simplv were shot
down in the streets bv "unknown men" or by "death
squads" often linked to the government.
Vet never has the war been like this, with the govern
ment waging what amounts to scorched-earth cam
paigns in some areas and the guerillas ever more ag
gressive. Last week guerillas hit a power station which
blacked out the capital and also mounted a full-scale at
tack on the heavily armed garrison in the town of San
Juan Cotzal.
Until last summer the Guatemalan army seemed fairly
confident of its ability to deal with the guerillas and re
mained in its "cuarteles," or garrisons. But after raids on
30 "safe" houses of the guerilla faction known as the
Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms, military
officials were stunned bv the level of organization, arma

ment and infrastructure they found.
In August, Lucas, the flamboyant brother of President
Romeo Lucas Garcia, was appointed chief of staff of the
armed forces. Trained at Sant-Cyr in France during the
Algerian war and a veteran of several field commands,
Benedicto Lucas transformed the army's tactics.
Major army drive
Bv November, the army had begun a major drive
through the province of Chimaltenango, just west of the
capital. Again, it found a high level of rebel entrench
ment and sophistication.
In much of the area, Vietnamese-style man-traps of
sharpened sticks had been laid; hillsides were riddled
with tunnels; as many as 200 storerooms were found.
What Lucas called "committed villages" were prepared
with trenches.
The rebels are led by the faction known as the Guerilla
Army of the Poor, or EGP for its Spanish initials, which
has its strongest units in the northwest.
"There are irregular local forces that also aid the
guerillas and warn them of the army's coming," Lucas
said. "Of course, these people are difficult to distinguish
from most of the rest of the local population, but these
organizational bases have to be won over or wiped out.
Because of that, well, the population suffers," said the
general
This week, coincident with the 10th anniversary of the

EGP's founding, guerilla activity increased dramatically.
Fhey stepped up ambushes and sabotage, bombing
several buildings in the capital and wrecking a key powei
station.
Early last Tuesday, a large force of uniformed guerilla l
made an unprecidented attack on a military head
quarters in the heart of El Quiche, the rough mountair
province where the guerillas are believed strongest.
Insurgents
The insurgents fought their way to the walls of the
cuartel using heavy-caliber machine guns, Chinese
mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.
Arriving on the scene shortly afterward, the chief o
staff said the guerillas would change out of their uni
forms into peasant clothes and bury their arms, but he
deployed 1500 men to track them down.
Terrorism has increased on both sides. Reportec
deaths that appear politically motivated surged from 10C
a month in 1980 to more than 300 a month in 1981. Most
recently it has been close to 500. Foreign officials con
cerned with human rights problems believe, moreover
that these reported figures are low.
There is little serious optimism here. Elections sched
uled for March may provide a slight opening for a politi
cal solution, but it is possible that not even a cosmetic
change will come about if, as expected, the official mili
tary candidate wins.

population. The war already has taken on proportions
comparable to the Salvndoran conflict
The rugged countryside with its heavy foliage is
perfect for insurgents. The government's intransigence
on human-rights issues — including its refusal to re
spond substantively to widespread charges that it is re

sponsible for thousands of civilian deaths, or to allow
lecognized international human-rights agencies to visit
the country — has cut it off from military assistance from
the United States. Meanwhile, the economy that was
flourishing only three years ago is slowing down as vio
lence erodes investor confidence.
Disparities
The roots of the war are fixed in desperate economic,
social, cultural, even racial disparities.
Through more than 20 years, the conflict has gone on.
Tens of thousands have died, many of them abducted
and tortured. Some disappeared or simplv were shot
down in the streets bv "unknown men" or by "death
squads" often linked to the government.
Vet never has the war been like this, with the govern
ment waging what amounts to scorched-earth cam
paigns in some areas and the guerillas ever more ag
gressive. Last week guerillas hit a power station which
blacked out the capital and also mounted a full-scale at
tack on the heavily armed garrison in the town of San
Juan Cotzal.
Until last summer the Guatemalan army seemed fairly
confident of its ability to deal with the guerillas and re
mained in its "cuarteles," or garrisons. But after raids on
30 "safe" houses of the guerilla faction known as the
Revolutionary Organization of People in Arms, military
officials were stunned bv the level of organization, arma

ment and infrastructure they found.
In August, Lucas, the flamboyant brother of President
Romeo Lucas Garcia, was appointed chief of staff of the
armed forces. Trained at Sant-Cyr in France during the
Algerian war and a veteran of several field commands,
Benedicto Lucas transformed the army's tactics.
Major army drive
Bv November, the army had begun a major drive
through the province of Chimaltenango, just west of the
capital. Again, it found a high level of rebel entrench
ment and sophistication.
In much of the area, Vietnamese-style man-traps of
sharpened sticks had been laid; hillsides were riddled
with tunnels; as many as 200 storerooms were found.
What Lucas called "committed villages" were prepared
with trenches.
The rebels are led by the faction known as the Guerilla
Army of the Poor, or EGP for its Spanish initials, which
has its strongest units in the northwest.
"There are irregular local forces that also aid the
guerillas and warn them of the army's coming," Lucas
said. "Of course, these people are difficult to distinguish
from most of the rest of the local population, but these
organizational bases have to be won over or wiped out.
Because of that, well, the population suffers," said the
general
This week, coincident with the 10th anniversary of the

EGP's founding, guerilla activity increased dramatically.
Fhey stepped up ambushes and sabotage, bombing
several buildings in the capital and wrecking a key powei
station.
Early last Tuesday, a large force of uniformed guerilla l
made an unprecidented attack on a military head
quarters in the heart of El Quiche, the rough mountair
province where the guerillas are believed strongest.
Insurgents
The insurgents fought their way to the walls of the
cuartel using heavy-caliber machine guns, Chinese
mortars and rocket-propelled grenades.
Arriving on the scene shortly afterward, the chief o
staff said the guerillas would change out of their uni
forms into peasant clothes and bury their arms, but he
deployed 1500 men to track them down.
Terrorism has increased on both sides. Reportec
deaths that appear politically motivated surged from 10C
a month in 1980 to more than 300 a month in 1981. Most
recently it has been close to 500. Foreign officials con
cerned with human rights problems believe, moreover
that these reported figures are low.
There is little serious optimism here. Elections sched
uled for March may provide a slight opening for a politi
cal solution, but it is possible that not even a cosmetic
change will come about if, as expected, the official mili
tary candidate wins.
Guatemala City — The general's helicopter banked
hard over the clouded forest. The starboard gunner
threw open the door and blasted away with his M-60 ma
chine gun at the trails beneath us, hammering 30-caliber
bullets into fire-scarred Indian settlements and small
plots covered with broken cornstalks.
This was in return for an attack by two or three leftist
rebels on a a small government patrol near here, not far
from the Pan American Highway. Gen. Benedicto Lucas
Garcia's personal helicopter had taken the offensive,
with two journalists aboard.
It was one of countless raids in the guerilla war raging
through northwest Guatemala and rapidly spreading: a
fightforcontrolofthe largest, richest, most populous na
tion in Central America.
On one side is a conservative, military-dominated re
