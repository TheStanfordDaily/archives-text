## Computer theft probe begun 
### Jeff Biddulph 
John Hawkes, supervisory senior
resident agent of the Palo Alto FBI,
confirmed yesterday that the bureau
has begun a preliminary investiga
tion into the the unauthorized use of
the reserch computer system
(SCORE) here.
The bureau will determine wheth
er the case falls within FBI juris
diction, Hawkes said.
Ralph Gorin, computer science
department director here, has
spoken with the FBI about the case,
but refused to disclose yesterday the
nature of his FBI discussion, how the
system was broken into, or what steps
the University will take next.

Hawkes said that one of the agents
in the bureau has discussed the case
with Gorin but that the agent would
not reveal any specifics to the press.
"Any comment made now might
interfere with any investigation in
progress or any investigation which
may start," said Gorin, in declining to
comment on the case.
The case, which involves the un
authorized use sometime earlier this
month of the University research
computer system has caused concern
among computer experts here. The
computer system is used for general
research by the Department of De
fense.
The person who gained illegal tele

phone access to the sytem used
someone else's password, according
to Computer Science Prof. John Mc-
Carthy. The Peninsula Times Tribune
reported Saturday that the per
petrator both extracted and placed
information in the computer system.
Gorin said he is "alarmed" by the
incident but refused to confirm that
information had been either ex
tracted or placed in the system. He
also declined to comment on the na
ture of the information in the system.
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost
and dean of graduate studies and re
search, said, "I'd be very surprised if
it (the information) were anything se
curity related.
Hawkes said only that the pre
liminary investigation may de
termine that the perpetrator "may
have stolen government property."
He said he was unsure what kind of
information may have been con
tained in the system which would
cause the FBI to have jurisdiction in
the case.
