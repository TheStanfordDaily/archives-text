## Editor's viewpoint A 						challenge to discuss 
### 
"Repose ye in peace, fortheerrorshallnot be
repeated."
The inscription, appearing on the monument
to those who died from the effects of atomic
bombs dropped in 1945 at Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, constantly serves as a challenge to
those of us alive today.
That mankind nowhastheabilitytodestroy
itself beyond recognition is no longer
questioned. Moreover, as much as we all
disagree on disarmament, deterrence and
detente, one thing on which rational people do
agree is that we must prevent this destruction.
For that reason I found myself particularly
interested in a column which appeared in
yesterday's Daily, challenging Stanford students
to discuss, within their residences, the presence
of nuclear weapons in the world and the
capability they possess to destroy civilization.
The author, Jim Morrison, further asked that
each residence put up a large banner in some
publicspace, advocating "mutual nuclear
disarmament for we, the people," or some
similarsentiment.
What appeals to me most about Morrison's
proposal is that it challenges students here to
react to an issue of critical importance: to
research it, think about it, discuss it, and, finally,
to resolve their feelings, one way or another,
about that issue. If residential education means
anything on this campus, proposals such as
Morrison's should be taken seriously.
There is no doubt that idealistic people
around the globe do in fact disagree on what the
species must do to save itself from annihilation.
It's entirely possible that membersof the houses
will fail to reach a consensuson whatthey want
to say on a banner; to me, that's okay.
What's not okay is avoidance of the issue.
Stanford students have been issued a challenge,
and as Morrison himself wrote, "My most
urgent request is that you and your house make
a decision: either decide to put up a banner or
not to put up a banner. Do not let this proposal
die an apathetic death!"

All I ask is that you come to the grips with the
question, because it is not going to go away.
Listen to your housemates, and allow your own
views to be altered or modified by theirs.
If you feel comfortable trusting our elected
officials not toengage us in a nuclear conflict,
say so. If you truly believe that we could fight
and survive a nuclear war, say so. If you believe
that unilateral, mutual ortotal nuclear
disarmament is within our reach and the answer
tothe problem at hand,sayso.
When your formal discussion is over, show
that you talked about the issue. If there is some
dominant sentiment you can all share —
whether or not it be the one Morrison proposed
— hang up a banner. If not, ask that each
member of the housewritea pageorsoof
thoughts which come out of the house meeting
at which the issue was discussed, and submit
those toorganizersof the bannerdrive.
Such a challenge is necessary in an
environment in which too often discussion of
such issues falls subservient to more insular
concerns. Your own decision about what we
shoulddo with nucleararms is an intensely
personal concern; but once you have made that
decision, living it out is your obligation to your
fellow human beings.
What appeals to me so much about the
column, as I have said, isthat it challenges usto
do something tangible, visible —and certainly
more active than avoiding a coming-to-grips
with the problem.
That challenge is and should be inherent in
what the Da/7y does for the Stanford
community, and that's probably why I found
myself excited about Morrison's column. As far
as controversial issues are concerned, our
business is not so much to give you the answers,
though occasionally we presume to do that in
our editorials. Ideally, our task is to present the
information and images you will use to decide
what you think — and how you will act.

die an apathetic death!"

All I ask is that you come to the grips with the
question, because it is not going to go away.
Listen to your housemates, and allow your own
views to be altered or modified by theirs.
If you feel comfortable trusting our elected
officials not toengage us in a nuclear conflict,
say so. If you truly believe that we could fight
and survive a nuclear war, say so. If you believe
that unilateral, mutual ortotal nuclear
disarmament is within our reach and the answer
tothe problem at hand,sayso.
When your formal discussion is over, show
that you talked about the issue. If there is some
dominant sentiment you can all share —
whether or not it be the one Morrison proposed
— hang up a banner. If not, ask that each
member of the housewritea pageorsoof
thoughts which come out of the house meeting
at which the issue was discussed, and submit
those toorganizersof the bannerdrive.
Such a challenge is necessary in an
environment in which too often discussion of
such issues falls subservient to more insular
concerns. Your own decision about what we
shoulddo with nucleararms is an intensely
personal concern; but once you have made that
decision, living it out is your obligation to your
fellow human beings.
What appeals to me so much about the
column, as I have said, isthat it challenges usto
do something tangible, visible —and certainly
more active than avoiding a coming-to-grips
with the problem.
That challenge is and should be inherent in
what the Da/7y does for the Stanford
community, and that's probably why I found
myself excited about Morrison's column. As far
as controversial issues are concerned, our
business is not so much to give you the answers,
though occasionally we presume to do that in
our editorials. Ideally, our task is to present the
information and images you will use to decide
what you think — and how you will act.
