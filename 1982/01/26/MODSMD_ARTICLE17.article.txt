## Even liberal PACs emphasize distasteful 'anti-campaigns' 
### 
I must be on every political mailing
list in the country. I had no idea that
there were so many public interest
and citizen groups in the country,
until my name somehow appeared
on one list and I soon became sub
jected to endless pleas for money
from a plethora of desperate liberal
groups.
There was one item in the pile a
couple of weeks ago which struck me
as especially interesting. Lamenting
the recent success of conservative hit
groups (i.e. NCPAC, the National
Conservative Political Action Com
mittee) in defeating several liberal
Congressmen such as Frank Church
(D-ldaho) or George McGovern (D-
S.D.), the letter proposed that liberals
must adopt similar tactics — they
must band together and raise money
to target conservative members of
Congress in upcoming elections.
My first reaction was one of mild
shock; I had previously (rather naive
ly) taken pride in the fact that only ul
tra-conservatives would stoop so low
as to raise money for the sole
purpose of campaigning against po-

litical enemies. Upon reflection,
however, I confessed that my own
adherence to a particular political
slant was not enough to ensure the
integrity of those who held similar
beliefs.
Nonetheless, I wasn't ready to give
up the flight so easily. I asked myself,
is there really anything ethically
wrong with campaigning against
rather than for a candidate? My in
stinct said "yes," but if it was being
done by fellow liberals, a re-eval
uation of the issue was called for.
In any election thereare numerous
groups distributed widely along the
political spectrum who participate in
order to help the candidate which
best represents their interests. If one
is convinced that an incumbant is so
abhorrent that his or her re
placement can certainly be no worse,
is this opinion any less valid or worthy
of expression than the belief that a
candidate is right for the job?
In theory, the purpose of cam
paigning in a congressional election
is to acquaint the electorate with the
stands and general characteristics of

the candidates, so that the voters can
make an informed choice. The politi
cian's faults are just as relevant to this
choice as his or her assets.
However, an "anti-campaign"
seeks to discredit its target in any way
it can, often bringing up matters
which are completely irrelevant to
the candidate's political quali
fications. Of course, the honesty of a
politician working to elect him or
herself is certainly not beyond ques
tion. But this problem is not inherent
in the system, whereas in an "anti
campaign" by definition has an ex
clusively negative focus, and tends to
breed mud-slinging tactics. Though
criticism has its place, it must be con-

structive to be useful. It is all tooeasy
to attack without proposing viable al
ternatives.
Furthermore, senators and repre
sentatives are ostensibly elected to
represent the interest of their own
constituencies. The money and sup
port for groups which target mem
bers of Congress for defeat generally
comes from sources nationwide, as
opposed to dissatisfied elements in
the relevant state or district. The ma
jor political parties, as well as many
interest groups, also have national
organizations, which does not neces
sarily their influence on
state or local elections (though per
haps it should).

But these groups do not interfere
so blatantly with regional interests.
The difference between a Southern
and a Northern Democrat reflects
their divergent environments. In
terest groups tend to support incum
bents, regardless of their political
philosophy, so as to gain leverage
with the probable winner of an elec
tion.
But whether conservative or liber
al, groups like NCPAC seek a uniform
Congress — despite the fact that
America is not so homogeneous.
Though I would love to see Sen. Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) defeated, as a liberal
Californian I respect the right of
more conservative North Carolinans

to elect him — and I would hope they
would regard Sen. Alan Cranston (D-
Ca.) likewise.
There is no particular tactic of hit
groups which is any less ethical than
those employed by other political ac
tion committees, nor which cannot
be encountered elsewhere. Perhaps
it is due to my relatively idealistic na
ture that I find their insistence on the
negative side of politics so distasteful.
Returning to the letter from the
liberal PAC awaiting my answer, I de
cided not to send a check. Yet, per
haps hypocritically, I wish them luck.
