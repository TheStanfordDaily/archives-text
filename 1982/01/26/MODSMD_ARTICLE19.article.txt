## Permit dorm residents to maintain living areas 
### 
As an ASSU senator and a resident of Serra
House, I am greatly disturbed that the Residential
Management Office pursues a policy that directly
discourages residents from accepting the respon
sibility of maintaining student living areas.
The implementation of this' policy has done
more than philosophically discourage awareness
of responsibility in regard to house damages; in
fact, it has discouraged even those house members
who have willingly accepted responsibility, de
spite the disincentives which the Residential Man
agement Office has imposed.
For example, when residents of Serra House be
came aware of damaged ceiling tiles and light
shades, they attempted to take responsibility for
the damages to the extent that they promptly and
efficiently repaired them. With the house returned
to its original condition, they did not believe there
would be any reasonable grounds of complaint
from the University.
Shortly thereafter, a message was forwarded to
their newly improved house informing them that
their acceptance of responsibility was not a matter

of concern to the Residential Management Office
and the unyielding wheels of bureaucracy.
The house was told that a bill would be for
warded, itemizing charges for 10 tiles at $9.50 each.
Charges of $10 to $15 for the lightshades were
mentioned. It was very difficult to explain to house
members at a house meeting why the university
should charge $9.50 for tiles that one can buy at a
hardware store for 58 cents each.
A certain amount of morbid admiration was ex
pressed in regard to the fierce entrepreneurial
spirit of the Residential Management Office. The
support of the Robber Baron as a mascot dwindled
to a small group of covert worshippers. Then the
serious discussion began.
No one could supply a satisfactory explanation
as to why a 58 cent panel cost $9.50, nor as to why
residents should be prohibited from maintaining
and enhancing student residences. We were in
formed, however, that the great heights and cum
bersome equipment might create a situation
where a student might be hurt.

Astonishingly, the chair and screwdrivers used
failed to inflict wounds on the house members. A
ladder was, however, used in replacing several
lounge lights when residents found that the
charges exacted by the Residential Management
Office would prohibit festivities including a holi
day party. No one was hurt.
We feel that the University should encourage
student maintenance of living facilities as a com
munity responsibility. If at the end of the year,
damages have been left unrepaired or repairs
made unsatisfactorily, then the house should be
charged and university maintenance employees
should be called in to complete any necessary
work. We also feel that dorms, when choosing not
between safety and money but between two possi
bilities, a $126 charge and a $58.80 charge, should
choose the lower charge. Weapologizetoany uni
versity employees who are hurt by this.
