## Continue refunds for fee assessments 
### 
Reading your editorial "Refunds:
Think first" (Daily, Jan. 22) left me
more than a little perturbed. Not
only'is your perception of the prob
lem badly flawed, but to carry out
either of the "solutions" you sug
gested without making additional —
and far more important — changes
would be a grave mistake.
AS things stand now, a student may
claim a refund of any fee assessment
for any reason whatever. This is en
tirely as it should be. It may be, per
haps, that "in the interest of the com
mon good, $1 per group is hardly un
reasonable," but I find it difficult to
make a case that any group which
could not collect the support of
much over 10 to 20 percent of said
community is so obviously acting for
the common good as the cause any
one to have second thoughts about

reclaiming his money for it. Although
several organizations may need to
scale back their budgets because of
this, they will still be far richer than
they would have been had their fee
assessment not passed at all.
Both solutions mentioned to deal
with the so-called problem of too
many students seeking refunds are
totally unnecessary and, in fact, com
pletely miss the point of all that is
happening. To punish a person for
not voting when the election rules
are so constituted as to make it pos
sible that not voting may be more ef
fective than a vote of no is to miss the
problem.
The solution is not to punish the
people who don't vote, but to
change the election rules so that the
"yes" votes cast must both
exceed a certain minimum per

centage of the total enrollment and
also be a majority of the votes cast.
This would make not voting into a
worthless strategy and increase the
value of actually voting "no."
This brings us to the root of the ac
tual problem, and to the reason why
mandatory fee assessments are
abhorrent to me, given the present
method of approval of fee
assessments. It is now far too easy for
a fee assessment to pass. The only
way one can justify the existence of
circumstances whereby 10 percent of
the students can force all to pay $1 to
support some organization or other
is to point out that, at present, any
one can ask that any or all of his mon
ey be refunded. Restriction or infr
ingement of this privilege would call
into question the justification for the
entire process whereby fee

assessments are enacted.
The problem that has surfaced this
quarter is not that too many people
are asking for refunds without given
them much thought. People who
normally would not care whether or
not they paid a few dollars to or
ganizations that might be worth
while, but that they have few deal
ings with, have suddenly found
themselves being asked to pay a full
$20, and they are balking at that. I
think they are fully justified. The
solution to this problem is not to pe
nalize the students who want their
money back, but to make it far more
difficult for their money to be taken
from them in the first place.
