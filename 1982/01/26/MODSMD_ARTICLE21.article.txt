## Hopper's vision defines American art and character 
### Samuel Howe 
Edward Hopper was a painter of two
worlds, a man who viewed his surroundings
with both a keen senseof detail and a haunt
ing sense of that world beyond what we ob
serve of each other day to day — the feelings
and fears which make up an unseen side of
human existence. At the same time that he
painted ordinary people doing ordinary
things, he captured them lost in thought and
encompassed by a world of their own which
bore no relation to the "other" world
around them; and at the same time that he
painted ordinary buildings in ordinary
towns, he usually portrayed them as some
how lost in the world of some other time or
meaning, seemingly as irrelevant to the peo
ple in them as those people seemed ob
livious to their own exisitence.
It is this contrast in his work, an almost per
vasive duality both of interpretation and
meaning, that make Hopper's art fascinating
to us, and worth seeing. Edward Hopper:
The Art and the Artist is a stunning show
whose final exhibition is in San Francisco fol
lowing appearances in New York, London,

Amsterdam, Dusseldorf and Chicago. The
show remains on exhibit through Feb. 14 at
the San Francisco Museu m of Modern Art.
Hopper's works contain more than artistic
contrast, to be sure. They are immensely
powerful statements about what it means to
be an American; yet they speak equally pow
erfully about what it means to be a human
being alive anywhere, anytime.
For most of us, an initial reaction to Hop
per's paintings is to comment, in one way or
another, on their insistent reality. People
and buildings are caught by the brush with
what seems to be an uncompromising eye
for detail and accuracy. Although Hopper
knew much of the Impressionists, and ex
perimented extensively with their style in his
early years, his mature works took nothing
for granted. Light, color, form — all of these
are important, but Hopper does not aug
ment them by sacrificing an almost photo
graphic faithfulness to the reproduction of
what he saw.
And yet, on another plane, his paintings
are totally unreal. They are fantasies, sim
plifications of scene designed to exaggerate
a central theme. More often than not, it
seems, his theme was isolation, either the
isolation of human beings from each other
or from their own surroundings.
Nighthawks (1942), probably his most fa
mous painting, is a classic example of this. In
it, we see four people in a coffee shop lo
cated in a deserted city neighborhood. The
rendering of the scene seems artistically
perfect, but it is unreal. The buildings are
pristine but devoid of any content — no
lights, no signs, no desks, nothing. The
streets are likewise empty of anything —
trash, cars, dirt — which could detract from
the simplicity of the setting and, by ex
tension, from the essential message of the
painting: the isolation of the characters.
They are four people, together but com
pletely alone, lost in four separate worlds of
their own minds' construction. All the ele
ments of the painting — such as the contrast
of light and shadow, the range of color —
contribute to the central theme.
The theme of isolation is repeated again

and again in his paintings — the people in
variably are either alone or they do not com
mmunicate with each other. In Gas (1940),
Pennsylvania Coal Town (1947), New York
Movie (1939), Sunlight in a Cafeteria (1958),
Sunday (1926), Hotel Lobby (1943), Chair Car
(1965) and many others, what is important is
that people exist together in the painting but
are totally unable to communicate with
each other.
They usually do not speak to each other;
and even if they do, those who speak are not
listened to. In one painting, Four Lane Road
(1956), which is unfortunately not part of the
exhibit, a woman leans out of a window call
ing to a man (presumably her husband) who
is just outside. He, meanwhile, seems
focused on something at least a million miles
away, utterly ignorantof her voice. The land
scape is stark, almost barren, the road be
hind their house stretching on forever.
There's no question, of course, of whether
he is able, physically, to hear her voice; he
sits not 10 feet away from the window. His in
ability is caused, instead, by some other rea
son, much more profound, that has its ex
planation in humanaloneness,notinthefail
ings of the human ear.
Even his houses, and other buildings,
share such isolation, as well as the haunting
paradox of reality and fantasy.
It must be said here that Hopper did not
consider himself any sort of a desperate out
cast of humanity, a sentiment that history has
indicated was felt by such artists as Vincent
Van Gogh and Edward Munch. Hopper was
an intensely personal figure, a man of few
words who relished his time alone at least as
much as his time with others. Yet he shared
none of the paranoia of those two artists, and
his art, while it often portrayed humans
alone in theirown worlds, did not reveal any
of the intense psychological isolation of
Munch in a painting such as The Scream. His
self-portraits depict him removed, almost
distant, but nevertheless have a strong air of
contentment about them.
Hopper received much of his schooling
from a group of American "realist" painters,
led by Robert Henri, whose inclination —

unlike those of the more sentimentalist
school which preceded them — was to paint
the United States in all its banality.
Their critics called them "the apostles of
ugliness," but Hopper was later to write of
Henri, "No single figure in recent American
art has been so instrumental in setting free
the hidden forces that can make of the art of
this country a living expression of its charac
ter and its people." He also expressed his
own belief that "a nation's art is greatest
when it reflects the chracter of its people."
The exhibit, full of paintings of gas stations,
empty motel rooms and isolated city streets,
clearly reflects Hopper's nationalistic (some
might say patriotic) impulses, and a far

greater interest in everyday life than in his
torical legends. He was a painter of the com
mon life, not of epics.
The paintings from Paris are a fascinating
reflection on some of Hopper's early ex
perimentation with light, as well as with
broad blocks of color: these early works,

painted during Hopper's three trips to Eu
rope, are an interesting source of the later
work of the artist.
After the Paris visits, his last being in 1910,
Hopper was never to leave the Western
Hemisphere, a fact clearly reflected in the
subjects of his later painting. He made a few
trips to the West Coast, and found there new
challenges — initially he considered them
almost insurmountable — to his artistic
sense. When he first visited New Mexico, he
painted not landscapes but locomotives,
though in time he took on the challenge of
the land around him.
A ongoing fascination of Hopper's was
with the New England coast. From 19300n he

spent most of his summers with his wife
Josephine in South Truro on Cape Cod.
There he found the rocky landscapes and
simple saltbox houses from which he was to
produce some of his stongest work, includ
ing Light at Two Lights (1929), Solitude (1944)
