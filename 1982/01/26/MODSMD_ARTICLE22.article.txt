Anyone who saw George C. Scott's Willy Loman in the
1975 New York revival of Death of a Salesman knows that
Scott is one of the four or five most commanding
actors in America, but he Has become an appallingly lazy
movie performer. With the exception of his old hand
hamminess in the already forgotten 1978 spoof Movie
Movie, I can't think of a single performance he's given in
a movie in the past 10 years that I would care to see again.
He's never been worse than in Taps, where he plays a
half-cracked old general who is headmaster at a military
academy until his shooting of a rambunctious townie at a
graduation ball gets the school closed down. The role of
General Bache, who imbues his students with a pre-
World War I chivalric code of soldierly conduct, is an un
fortunate one — Patton gone senile — but Scott's mech
anized delivery of speeches that all sound like memorial
services (though in fact only one is) really is unforgivable.
The screenwriters — Darryl Ponicsan, Robert Mark and
james Lindberger (working out of a novel by Deverey
Freeman called Father Sky) — may have intended Bache
to be a shell of a man, but Scott gives a shell of a per
formance, which isn't the same thing.

Taps
The Aviator's Wife

Taps is so poorly structured that you can't figure out
how the writers and the director, Harold Becker, intend
you to take Bache's teachings, which the boys — espe
cially the hero, Brian (Timothy Hutton), who has just
been appointed Cadet Major — revere. For the first half
of the film, we are suffocated with lengthy tributes to the
American military tradition — a roll call of the dead, a
dorm corridor demonstration of the swordsmanship of a
band of young Red Berets, a graduation parade — and
the boys at the academy are portrayed so sympathetically
that when, under Brian's command, they arm themselves
and take over the school to prevent its closing, we are
clearly meant to cheer. (Those of us in the audience who
grow queasy at the invocation of military virtues may re
sist, however.) Brian is fashioned as the model leader —
intelligent, charismatic and concerned about the indi
vidual problems of the cadets under his command. He is
also utterly lacking in foresight and so foolhardy that he
inevitably imperils himself and the other kids. But the
movie refrains from making that point until the second
half, when Ronny Cox as a Washington colonel appears
at the gates of the academy to tell Brian that he is in love
with death and to change the picture from a Reagan-era

drama of grand old ethics embattled to an indictment of
those who accept the code they are taught without
thinking to question it.
It would be nice to believe that the filmmakers
planned to draw us into Bache's vision and then under
cut it in the second half of the movie by showing us its
consequences. But Taps operates on such a sentimental
level that I suspect that Becker and the writers shifted
gears as another means of manipulating our emotions.
The characters are not complex, and at times they aren't
consistent; for example, Brian complains to Kerby (Cox)
that the army bigwigs want the cadets to grow up and
fight their wars rather than defending their own beliefs.
What kind of cadet would protest against the wars in
which his country gets involved? Certainly not this one.
This speech is included to score a point against the un
seen controllers in Washington; it's gratuitous. The mov
ie is full of such flourishes — like the cute-as-a-button
pre-adolescent, Charlie (Brendan Ward), who is so sweet
and zealous and affectionate that we know (especially
when we hear him talking on the phone to his parents
early in film) that he's sure to get picked off in the vio
lence that takes up most of the last third of the action. No
movie that goes in for this kind of maudlin pay-off can
honestly be called the work of deep thinkers.
I only liked one image in this picture — a massive tank
rolling up to the gate in the dark, shot in eerie blues and
whites. Most of Owen Roizman's photography is
somber, which must have been what Becker asked for,
because all the scenes have a solemn tone. It's an un
bearably pompous movie. When Brian visits Bache in his
office, Scott is standing alone at his window, gazing out;
watching this set-up, I asked myself why anyone would
want to make a movie in which characters brood at win
dows in largeempty rooms. Harold Beckershowed a flair
for film noir in the first half of his debut picture, The On
ion Field, but he doesn't seem to be interested in
straightforward narrative values here, or in mood or set
ting. (I never believed for an instant that the boys really
lived together in that school.) I wonder if he thinks that
Taps is high art.

"Other people's problems always sound ridiculous,"
one of the characters in The Aviator's Wife says, and the
movie, which was written and directd by Eric Rohmer,
sets out to prove that point. Anne (Marie Riviere) is in
love with Christian (Matheiu Carriere), an aviator who
sees her whenever his job takes him to Paris. One morn
ing he wakes her by slipping a note under her door; he
has come to tell her that he has decided to break off the
affair and commit himself to his marriage. Anne's day-to
day boyfriend, a student named Francois (Philippe
Marlaud), sees the two of them leaving her apartment

and assumes they have slept together, though Anne,
who is older than Francois and has begun to find him an
annoyance, tells him that she is finished with Christian.
Later that day, Francois spots Christian at a cafe with a
blond woman and shadows them, attracting the atten
tion of a curious teenager, Lucie (Anne-Laure Meury)
who flirts with him and helps him play detective. Is the
blond stranger Christian's wife or his new lover? Francois
learns the answe, as we do, at the end of the day, and it
turns out to be a joke on him.
The Aviator's Wife has a perfect circular structure; it's
very well made and well shot (by Bernard Lutic), full of
eloquent, painterly two-shots; the dialogue is in
telligent; and there isn't an unnatural moment in any of
the performances. But I'd forgotten almost all of it the
day after seeing it. Most of Rohmer's films pose intellec
tual problems and then spend a couple of hours debat
ing them, but in the best ones — My Night at Maud's and

Claire's Knee — the characters are so interesting to listen
to that their conversation fascinates us as we might be
fascinated by a brilliant discussion at a party. These char
acters don't come up to the mark. Marie Riviere has a
slight body and expressive shoulders, like a Degas, and
she's world-weary in every pore: she's a fine subject for
the camera, but by the last, long scene between her
and Marlaud, her mood has begun to depress us.
Her acting is just about impeccable, as far as it goes, but
the impression she makes on us wears off quickly — it's
slight, too. And mostly what Marlaud gives us is Fran
cois's immaturity; we understand both what in him ir
ritates Anne and why he has a much more relaxed time
with the adolescent who picks him up. Anne-Laure
Meury, who reminds one of a very young Tuesday Weld,
has more spirit than any of the other performers, but she
isn't the most riveting child in a Rohmer movie. (See
Beatrice romand in Claire's Knee to compare.) She's
merely a diversion, and so is the picture.
