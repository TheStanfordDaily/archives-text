# The 						Blasters give us a blast from the recent past

### Phil Moremen 
The Blasters
Keystone Palo Alto
19 January 1981
The so-called rockabilly re
vival — perhaps now just reach
ing its.peak with the popularity
of acts like The Blasters, The
Stray Cats and Dave Edmunds
— has actually been reviving
for quite a few years. Edmunds,
for example, has been playing
the same sort of stuff for ages;
popular taste has swung back
to his type of music, not vice
versa.
Indeed, rockabilly stands to
day as perhaps the remnant of
new wave, emotional and fun
rock and roll that anyone can
relate to, or, for that matter,
recreate in their garage with a
cheap guitar and a set of
trashcan lids. Actually, I exag
gerate. But that, I think, wasthe
underlying spirit of new wave,
and even of rock and roll: get
ting down to basics. I use the
past tense here on purpose.
Original new wave is, essential
ly, dead, the victim of musical

conservatism on the part of ra
dio stations in the formation of
their playlists, and, to a lesser
degree, the unwillingness of
major record companies to
take risks.
The successors to the "old"
new wave, in contrast, seem
rather bloodless and too
caught up with neat gizmos
that create ethereal echo ef
fects, and existential, angst-rid
den lyrics and vocals. In this in
stance I'm speaking mostly of
developments in England. In
America it seems as if, with a
few notable (mostly ignored)
exceptions, music is drifting
back into the same old com
fortable rut. Other musicians
of the avant-garde — David
Byrne, Gang of Four and the
new King Crimson, for exam
ple — are presently intrigued
with techno-funky, endlessly
repeating rhythms and sub
ordinated melodies. What
many of these "new" new
wave forms seem to have in
common is lack of emotion,
over-intellectualization, and,
for me, boring repetition. Oth
ers, of course, may enjoy bor

ing repetition. I, however,, just
find it. . . boring. My only com
fort is the knowledge that these
bands aren't too likely to re
ceive much radio exposure
either. On the other hand,
these musicians do seem to be
on the cutting edge of rock
music today; ai least they're
tryingsomethingnew. But,one
could ask, is it still rock and
roll?
The Blasters, in this case, pro
vide the answer. Following the
lackluster performance of an
all-girl band called the Con
tractions (draw your own in
ferences), they immediately
livened up a surprisingly thin

crowd at the Keystone Thurs
day night with a powerful, driv
ing performance. Although
voted best L. A. band of the year
in a survey of L.A. musicians,
narrowly edging X, their fame
obviously has not spread to the
hinterlands of Palo Alto.
The Blasters played one slow
song the whole evening, and
rattled off one up-beat number
right after the other. Phil Alvin,
the lead vocalist, must possess
the most natural rockabilly
voice around, screwing up his
face and belting out an emo
tionally intense sound that ren
dered him hoarse by night's
end. Accompanied by his

brother Dave, slashing at his
guitar with an obvious new
wave abandon, The Blasters ran
through many of the songs on
their first two albums, and
many old standards as well,
which I, youngster that I am,
am ashamed to admit I didn't
recognize. However, I'm sure
the youngish crowd shared my
ignorance, and neither did

they care, dancing vigorously
in front of the stage. By night's
endthat'swhere most of the au
dience was: it's almost im
possible to keep your feet still
for long during a Blasters show.
But the band always managed
to recapture any flagging^ L
momentum by ov^rSTT
abundant energy. All in all, a
great time.

The Blasters
Keystone Palo Alto
19 January 1981
The so-called rockabilly re
vival — perhaps now just reach
ing its.peak with the popularity
of acts like The Blasters, The
Stray Cats and Dave Edmunds
— has actually been reviving
for quite a few years. Edmunds,
for example, has been playing
the same sort of stuff for ages;
popular taste has swung back
to his type of music, not vice
versa.
Indeed, rockabilly stands to
day as perhaps the remnant of
new wave, emotional and fun
rock and roll that anyone can
relate to, or, for that matter,
recreate in their garage with a
cheap guitar and a set of
trashcan lids. Actually, I exag
gerate. But that, I think, wasthe
underlying spirit of new wave,
and even of rock and roll: get
ting down to basics. I use the
past tense here on purpose.
Original new wave is, essential
ly, dead, the victim of musical

conservatism on the part of ra
dio stations in the formation of
their playlists, and, to a lesser
degree, the unwillingness of
major record companies to
take risks.
The successors to the "old"
new wave, in contrast, seem
rather bloodless and too
caught up with neat gizmos
that create ethereal echo ef
fects, and existential, angst-rid
den lyrics and vocals. In this in
stance I'm speaking mostly of
developments in England. In
America it seems as if, with a
few notable (mostly ignored)
exceptions, music is drifting
back into the same old com
fortable rut. Other musicians
of the avant-garde — David
Byrne, Gang of Four and the
new King Crimson, for exam
ple — are presently intrigued
with techno-funky, endlessly
repeating rhythms and sub
ordinated melodies. What
many of these "new" new
wave forms seem to have in
common is lack of emotion,
over-intellectualization, and,
for me, boring repetition. Oth
ers, of course, may enjoy bor

ing repetition. I, however,, just
find it. . . boring. My only com
fort is the knowledge that these
bands aren't too likely to re
ceive much radio exposure
either. On the other hand,
these musicians do seem to be
on the cutting edge of rock
music today; ai least they're
tryingsomethingnew. But,one
could ask, is it still rock and
roll?
The Blasters, in this case, pro
vide the answer. Following the
lackluster performance of an
all-girl band called the Con
tractions (draw your own in
ferences), they immediately
livened up a surprisingly thin

crowd at the Keystone Thurs
day night with a powerful, driv
ing performance. Although
voted best L. A. band of the year
in a survey of L.A. musicians,
narrowly edging X, their fame
obviously has not spread to the
hinterlands of Palo Alto.
The Blasters played one slow
song the whole evening, and
rattled off one up-beat number
right after the other. Phil Alvin,
the lead vocalist, must possess
the most natural rockabilly
voice around, screwing up his
face and belting out an emo
tionally intense sound that ren
dered him hoarse by night's
end. Accompanied by his

brother Dave, slashing at his
guitar with an obvious new
wave abandon, The Blasters ran
through many of the songs on
their first two albums, and
many old standards as well,
which I, youngster that I am,
am ashamed to admit I didn't
recognize. However, I'm sure
the youngish crowd shared my
ignorance, and neither did

they care, dancing vigorously
