New York nuke mishap under control
Ontario, N.Y. — A tube ruptured in a cooling system at the
Ginna nuclear power plant yesterday, emitting radioactive
steam into the atmosphere and leaking thousands of gallons
of water into the reactor's containment sump before the
plant was stabilized, officials said.
The reactor of the plant, 18 miles northeast of Rochester,
New York's third-largest city, was shut down automatically
and was doused with water to keep it from overheating, said
Gary Sanborn, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
He said the plant "appears to be fairly stable."
Nemen Terc, an NRC emergency preparedness analyst,
said there was no damage to the reactor core. The reactor's
fuel elements were never uncovered, said Ebe McCabe,
NRC regional reactor projects section chief.
Harold Denton, director of the NRC, said in Washington
that "it might be expensive for the operator to clean up, but
in terms of public health consequences it wasn't very seri
ous."
Officials declared a "site emergency," the second most se
rious of four emergency classifications, within 75 minutes of
the tube rupture at 9:25 a.m.
NRC officials said the incident marked the first use of that
emergency classification since the March 28,1979, accident
at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa. TMI was
the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. The plant
remains shut.
Gromyko will not discuss Poland
Geneva — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, arriv
ing here yesterday for talks with Secretary of State Alexander
Haig, said he has "absolutely no intention" of discussing Po
land during today's talks.
"Well, it could be a short meeting then," Haig said when
informed of Gromyko's statement upon arrival at Geneva
airport.
Haig's observation appeared to augur a meeting in which
unreconcilable views would be declared by both sides with
little agreement on anything.
Gromyko, addressing reporters, expressed similarly low
expectations. "I certainly do feel that there will be no lack of
problems and questions for discussion," he said.

Then he added: "I have absolutely no intention of discuss
ing questions relating to Poland or the domestic situation in
Poland."
Haig, in his own airport arrival statement Sunday night had
declared his intention of expressing western "outrage" at
the Soviet role in the martial-law crackdown in Poland in his
talks with Gromyko.
Court grants ERA deadline review
Washington — The Supreme Court said yesterday it will
decide whether the proposed Equal Rights Amendment is
dead.
But the timing of the court's review could prove a crushing
blow to pro-ERA forces. According to court clerk Alexander
Stevis, the justices will not even hear arguments in the case
before next June 30 — the congressionally approved dead
line for ERA.
The justices, agreeing to speed ur their deliberations to
grant review, said they will review a ruling by a federal judge
in Idaho that the proposed amendment died three yearsago.
U.S. District Judge Marion Callister of Boise ruled Dec. 23
that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it extended the
ratification deadline from March 22,1979, to next June 30.
But the court's orders did not include any timetable for
hearings. Stevis said he did not expect the ERA case to be
argued this court term, which is expected to end in early July.
That means the case would not be scheduled for argument
until next October, at the earliest, and the controversy could
be moot by then.
Before the court rules on the issues involved, it must de
cide whether it has legal jurisdiction in the case. If the ERA is
not ratified by the required number of states by June 30, the
court most likely would rule that it does not have the neces
sary jurisdiction.
Jaruzelski: no early end for martial law
Warsaw — Polish Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski bitterly at
tacked the independent labor federation Solidarity, the
United States and its allies yesterday and hinted that military
control of Poland's mines and factories will continue for
some time.
In his first address to the Sejm, or Parliament, since martial

law was declared Dec. 13, Jaruzelski said some restrictions on
civil liberties could be lifted by the end of February, but only
if there are no "illegal activities" directed against the state,
Radio Warsaw reported.
"Before the 13th of December last year, the stability and
security of the state had been unhinged and the economy
was crashing," Warsaw radio quoted Jaruzelski as saying.
"The threat of fratricidal war was in the air."
He said lifting of martial law would depend "on the fulfill
ment of conditions which would secure a permanent, safe
and normal course of life, the smooth functioning of the
economy."
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said diplomatic reports contradict Jaruzelski's claim that re
pressive measures may soon be lifted. He said Jaruzelski's
speech seemed to be a justification of martial law, so it "sure
ly could not be characterized as positive in its implications."
Flight recorder findings disclosed
Washington — The Air Florida jetliner that plunged into
the Potomac River barely reached takeoff velocity after roar
ing down the runway 15 seconds longer than normal, then
lost speed almost as soon as it was airborne, according to in
strument readings revealed yesterday.
Medical examiners, meanwhile, concluded that all but
one of the 74 people who died aboard the plane Jan. 13 suf
fered severe injuries from impact and probably could not
have survived the accident even if rescue workers had
reached them immediately.
Stocks continue decline
New York — The stock market continued its decline yes
terday in another session dominated by interest rate de
velopments.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off nearly 9 points
at noontime, closed with a 2.28 loss at 842.75.

Gromyko, addressing reporters, expressed similarly low

Then he added: "I have absolutely no intention of discuss

Poland."
Haig, in his own airport arrival statement Sunday night had

talks with Gromyko.
Court grants ERA deadline review
Washington — The Supreme Court said yesterday it will
decide whether the proposed Equal Rights Amendment is
dead.
But the timing of the court's review could prove a crushing
blow to pro-ERA forces. According to court clerk Alexander
Stevis, the justices will not even hear arguments in the case
before next June 30 — the congressionally approved dead
line for ERA.
The justices, agreeing to speed ur their deliberations to
grant review, said they will review a ruling by a federal judge
in Idaho that the proposed amendment died three yearsago.
U.S. District Judge Marion Callister of Boise ruled Dec. 23
that Congress acted unconstitutionally when it extended the
ratification deadline from March 22,1979, to next June 30.
But the court's orders did not include any timetable for
hearings. Stevis said he did not expect the ERA case to be
argued this court term, which is expected to end in early July.
That means the case would not be scheduled for argument
until next October, at the earliest, and the controversy could
be moot by then.
Before the court rules on the issues involved, it must de
cide whether it has legal jurisdiction in the case. If the ERA is
not ratified by the required number of states by June 30, the
court most likely would rule that it does not have the neces
sary jurisdiction.
Jaruzelski: no early end for martial law
Warsaw — Polish Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski bitterly at
tacked the independent labor federation Solidarity, the
United States and its allies yesterday and hinted that military
control of Poland's mines and factories will continue for
some time.
In his first address to the Sejm, or Parliament, since martial

law was declared Dec. 13, Jaruzelski said some restrictions on
civil liberties could be lifted by the end of February, but only
if there are no "illegal activities" directed against the state,
Radio Warsaw reported.
"Before the 13th of December last year, the stability and
security of the state had been unhinged and the economy
was crashing," Warsaw radio quoted Jaruzelski as saying.
"The threat of fratricidal war was in the air."
He said lifting of martial law would depend "on the fulfill
ment of conditions which would secure a permanent, safe
and normal course of life, the smooth functioning of the
economy."
In Washington, White House spokesman Larry Speakes
said diplomatic reports contradict Jaruzelski's claim that re
pressive measures may soon be lifted. He said Jaruzelski's
speech seemed to be a justification of martial law, so it "sure
ly could not be characterized as positive in its implications."
Flight recorder findings disclosed
Washington — The Air Florida jetliner that plunged into
the Potomac River barely reached takeoff velocity after roar
ing down the runway 15 seconds longer than normal, then
lost speed almost as soon as it was airborne, according to in
strument readings revealed yesterday.
Medical examiners, meanwhile, concluded that all but
one of the 74 people who died aboard the plane Jan. 13 suf
fered severe injuries from impact and probably could not
have survived the accident even if rescue workers had
reached them immediately.

New York nuke mishap under control
Ontario, N.Y. — A tube ruptured in a cooling system at the
Ginna nuclear power plant yesterday, emitting radioactive
steam into the atmosphere and leaking thousands of gallons
of water into the reactor's containment sump before the
plant was stabilized, officials said.
The reactor of the plant, 18 miles northeast of Rochester,
New York's third-largest city, was shut down automatically
and was doused with water to keep it from overheating, said
Gary Sanborn, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
He said the plant "appears to be fairly stable."
Nemen Terc, an NRC emergency preparedness analyst,
said there was no damage to the reactor core. The reactor's
fuel elements were never uncovered, said Ebe McCabe,
NRC regional reactor projects section chief.
Harold Denton, director of the NRC, said in Washington
that "it might be expensive for the operator to clean up, but
in terms of public health consequences it wasn't very seri
ous."
Officials declared a "site emergency," the second most se
rious of four emergency classifications, within 75 minutes of
the tube rupture at 9:25 a.m.
NRC officials said the incident marked the first use of that
emergency classification since the March 28,1979, accident
at the Three Mile Island plant near Harrisburg, Pa. TMI was
the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident. The plant
remains shut.
Gromyko will not discuss Poland
Geneva — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, arriv

Haig, said he has "absolutely no intention" of discussing Po
land during today's talks.

informed of Gromyko's statement upon arrival at Geneva
airport.
Haig's observation appeared to augur a meeting in which
unreconcilable views would be declared by both sides with
