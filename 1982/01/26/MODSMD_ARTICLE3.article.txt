# Faculty woes heard in housing debate

Debate over a new faculty Housing Assistance
Program (HAP) at a meeting of 35 concerned Uni
versity faculty yesterday will probably have no im
mediate effect on the program, said James Rosse,
associate dean of humanities and sciences.
Rosse, chairman of the dean's subcommittee on
housing, said that present debate cannot influence
the HAP program, which is scheduled to begin in
the next academic year, but will be useful in de
veloping housing assistance programs in the
future.
"This is not the end of the road," said Rosse,
"there are going to be more housing programs de
veloped."
Two controversial parts of the HAP program are
causing the most tension among faculty.
First, no faculty member who came here before
1979 will be eligible for the program, which is de
signed to directly supplement house payments of
faculty who settle within 15 miles of campus.
Second, the size of housing subsidies will in

crease with the level of the faculty member's
salary.
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz, president of Stan
ford's chapter of the American Association of Uni
versity Professors, and other faculty members are
concerned that many older and lower-salaried fac
ulty will still be priced out of the exorbitant local
housing market.
"We feel that the lower ends of the pay scale
should receive more in terms of housing subsidy,"
said Diana Paul, assistant professor of religious
studies.
Rosse, however, said that the progressive level
of subsidy is necessary to the program's goal of
"recruitment and retention."
HAP would provide little incentive, he said, to
faculty who have established homes in cheaper
parts of the country if it did not offer substantial aid
at higher salary levels.
HAP subsidies are graduated, however.' so that
faculty in lower income orackets wtlf pay a smaller
percentage of their take-home salary each month

on house payments, said Rosse.
The University Board of Trustees budgeted $2.25
million for HAP's first year, which includes a small
amount of funds for faculty who are excepted from
eligibility requirements by the Provost.
Robin Hamill, director of housing programs,
said, however, that the University cannot guaran
tee housing to every faculty member.
The future availability of cheap faculty housing,
said Rosse, depends mainly on future fluctuations
in credit interest rates.
"This whole housing (shortage) kind of caught
the University by surprise," he said.
The goal of yesterday's meeting, held in the fo
rum room of Meyer Library at 4:30 p.m., said
Rebholz, was to arouse concern among faculty
about HAP's inadequacies.
