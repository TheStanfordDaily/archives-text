The call over the police radio in
volved a car burglary at Florence
Moore Hall. Deputy Sheriff Del
Bandy of the Stanford Police De
partment responded and within a
couple of minutes arrived at the
Flo Mo parking lot.
"Somebody just tried to rip off
my car stereo. I can't believe it,"
said a woman resident, who met
Bandy outside.
"Last month my room was bro
ken into, my bike stolen and now
my car," she said.
Bandy has been with the de
partment for four and a half years
and a deputy since May. He's fol
lowed up a lot of burglary reports
around the campus and in fact,
this one seems out of the or
dinary:
"It's really strange to have two
unsuccessful attempts at the same
place. Usually if the burglar is in
terrupted in one attempt he won't
come back,"said Bandy.

"This probably wasn't a pro
fessional — a professional car bur
glar would take about a minute to
a minute and a half for that job.
They are very hard to catch. Pro
fessionals hang around campus
for a few months, then move on to
new territory. When we finally
catch the guy, we can wrap up a
lot of cases all at once," he said.
This patrol had been slow for
Deputy Bandy, "there's been
three or four radio calls and a
wallet theft." A typical day, he
said, is one where there are two
officers on patrol, and duties are
split between answering radio
calls and what he called "self-in
tiated" actions such as stopping
vehicles for traffic violations or in

vestigating activities in progress.
Bandy returned to his car where
he received another report over
the radio: a Delta Upsilon mem
ber had reported a stolen bike.
On the way to the DU house,
Bandy noticed several traffic vio
lations but did not bother to stop
the cars. He turned the corner
onto Mayfield Avenue just in time
to see a station wagon attempting
a three-point turn in heavy traffic.
Bandy reached down and
flipped on his loudspeaker.
"You know that was bad," he
blared to the worried driver. But
this time, the warning would be
all.
"I have to prioritize. I have oth
er things to do first, and I just don't
have time to stop him," he ex
plained.
Bandy met the student who re
ported the stolen bike inside the
DU house.
"My bike was missing for about
two months," said the student. "I

found the bike and the guy who
was riding it by Kresge. I was really
inconvenienced for two months
and I'd like him to be inconve
nienced too."
"Was he a student?" asked Ban
dy.
"Yes, I got his name off his meal
card."
"That's funny. We usually like to
think that students aren't our
problem," said Bandy.
Bandy explained to the student
that the police would follow up
his report, and the possible
charges the suspect will face.
Throughout all his patrol, Bandy
is cordial and efficient.
"I enjoy working here. Most of
the students are really con

siderate," said Bandy.
These qualities make Bandy a
fairly typical member of the Stan
ford Police Department. Bandy is
also typical of the department be
cause he is young and because this
is his first job in law enforcement.
"Most officers haven't had po
lice experience. They're right out
of college, or going to col
lege,"said Sgt. Ernie Brooks, who
has been with the police depart
ment for 12 years.
Although many of the police of
ficers are new to the profession,
they have had quite a bit of train
ing, said Brooks.
According to Brooks, the appli
cants are required to pass agility
and written testsandanoral board
exam. They must also go through a
background investigation and an
interview with the chief.
If they pass these obstacles, the
applicants spend three months
training at a police academy and
then return hereforan"extended
field training program" in which
the applicants are on "probation
for a year," Brooks said.
During this time, a trainee
works with an experienced officer
who examines how the trainee
"handles situations, deals with
people, drives, everything," said
Brooks.
The rewards of working here
are well worth the obstacles, said
Brooks. "Stanford is a more attrac
tive place to work than metropoli
tan cities — it has a pleasant at
mosphere. Young people like to
start here and then move on to
other departments. But that's usu
al for law enforcement," he said.
Although the police depart
ment may have many well-trained
officers, the lack of experience on
the force may be its biggest liabil
ity.
"Young officers need about two
and a half to three years before
they really know what they are
doing. But officers here have a lot
of training .and more schooling
than most departments. We have
people with bachelor's and mas
ter's degrees," said Bandy.
Police Chief Marvin Herrington
maintained that his department is
as effective as other departments
its size. "With the reorganization
and upgrading that has taken
place during the last 10 years, we
are just like any srfiall city depart
ment."


"With the
reorganization and
upgrading that has
taken place during
the last ten years, ive
are just like any small
city department—

Chief Marv
Herrington.
