# New Palo Alto parklands set aside
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
The Palo Alto City Council voted
last night to preserve 77 acres off
Arastradero Rd. as open space and
approved the $9 million acquisition
of the Terman school.
Another 438 acres of the Arastra
lands, as the area is called, have al
ready been set aside as parkland by
the city. The move by the council not
to add the remaining 77 acres to the
parkland means that the city can de
cide to use that land to generate rev
enue if the need arises in the future.
One study commissioned by the
city government suggested the land
could be used for housing. The Sierra
Club and the Committee for the
Green Foothills asked that the land
be made into parkland.
Linda Grandmaison of the Com
mittee for the Green Foothills sug
gested that approving use of the land
for housing would set a precedent al
lowing neighboring Stanford to use
its adjoining land for development as
well.
The council adopted its wait-and

see attitude in part because of uncer
tainty over the city's future financial
commitments. Council member El
len Fletcher said Proposition 13 had
been "slow and uneven" in making
itself felt, and that the county had
suddenly felt the crunch of the tax
cutting resolution this year. She sug
gested the city not make any final de
cision on use of the land until it had a
better idea of its future needs. That
sentiment prevailed.
The council also agreed to acquire
the Terman school from the Palo Alto
Unified School District. Two million
dollars will be provided by the Jewish
Community Center, which will use
part of the site. Another $2 million
will come from the city's Housing
Land Bank Funds. Inaddition, the city
will use $5 million of its $7 million
capital reserves.
As Palo Alto's school population
declines, more schools will become
available for the city to purchase
from the school district. It is possible
that future councils may decide to
sell the Arastra land to finance the

purchase of other schools.
The city will pay "substantial in
terest" on the Terman property to
the school district during the first 12
years of the 20-year lease period,
Mayor Fred Eyerly said. Although
funds were not approved during this
meeting, funds for landscaping, park
ing, and operation of the property
will add to the price of the purchase.
Eyerly estimated the total cost of the
acquisition at $19 million during the
20-year period.
