# Wisconsin defies NAS, joins Stanford protest

The University of Wisconsin has
joined Stanford in opposing State
Department restrictions on a Soviet
scholar scheduled to research robot
ics at the two schools this spring, uni
versity officials there said.
The State Department restrictions
come in a wave of concern over the
alleged increase of Western techno
logical information flowing into Sovi
et controlled countries.
Late last week the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) relayed
the State Department decision to re
move Stanford from the itinerary of
Soviet scientist Nikolay Umnov.
The University had previously
notified the NAS that they would not
comply with the government restric
tions. Gerald Lieberman, vice prov
ost and dean of graduate studies,
stated in a letter to the NAS, "our
programs represent basic and un
classified investigations the results of
which are generally available to the
public ... such action (policing)
would drastically disrupt the academ
ic environment which is essential in
fostering creative research en
deavors."

The export restrictions placed on
Umnov require that he be kept from
gaining access to program controls of
robots, from visiting industries, and
from acquiring any unpublished in
formation during his tour of four
American universities.
"There's just no way to impose
these things," said Camden Coberly,
associate dean of theCollegeof Engi
neering at Wisconsin, of the restric
tions. "It's a function which is inap
propriate and one we're just not
going to do." Umnov is scheduled to
visit the university for four weeks.
Prof. Ali Seireg, Umnov's sched
uled host at Wisconsin, notified the
NAS that restricting areas of the cam
pus from students and scholars was
contrary to university policy, adding
that all university research was un
classified, said Coberly. The Defense
Department funds approximately 60
percent of the engineering research
at the university, he said.
Coberly disapproved in particular
of the restriction limiting Umnov's
research to published materials,
saying it defeated the purpose of the
exchange program. "He can read
those publications in the library in
Moscow; they probably have them
all anyway."
NAS spokesman Howard Lewis
said he had not heard from university
officials at Auburn or at Ohio State
where Umnov is also scheduled to
study. However, Prof. Robert
McGhee at Ohio State University,
where Umnovisscheduledtostayfor
more than five weeks, said Umnov
would be "welcome for two or three
days ... I'd accept restrictions for a
visit of that length, but not any long
er," according to the Stanford Uni
versity News Service.
Meanwhile, the NAS has sus
pended any further distribution of
the restrictions to universities until
the National Research Council and
the governing board of the NAS meet
to review its policies in late February,
Lewis said.
