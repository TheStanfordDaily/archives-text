# Schlafly, prof. will debate Equal Rights
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
Phylis Schlafly, outspoken oppo
nent of the Equal Rights Amend
ment, will debate visiting Stanford
Law Prof. Catherine McKinnon to
night at 7:30 in Kresge auditorium.
Aiming to bring someone to cam
pus who would spark dialogue, de
bate co-sponsors said, "Phylis Schlaf
ly is perfect."
The debate is being co-sponsored
by the Stanford Committee On Polit
ical Education (SCOPE) and the Stan
ford Conservative Political Alliance
(SCPA), a group formed last spring.
According to SCPA member Bill
Sneed, the group is "dedicated to
promoting campus dialogue on rele
vant social and political issues."
Sneed said SCPA began last No
vember in attempts to find other
campus groups to co-sponsor such a
debate, because SCPA could not
manage Schlafly's expenses alone.
SCOPE Director Jeff Gutman said
his group agreed to co-sponsor the
debate "so students and the Stanford
community could get a two-sided
view of the issue."
Sneed explained that the groups
had hoped to present the debate last
December but had a hard time find
ing a debate opponent whose ex
penses they could afford. A former
president of the National Organiza
tion of Women (NOW) was willing to
come, but the co-sponsors did not
have sufficient funds to pay her way.
Gutman said they then turned to
the Stanford community and asked
Catherine McKinnon, a law pro
fessor last semester, to debate Schlaf
ly. "McKinnon has a wide reputation
in the Stanford community," Gut
man said, "and we wanted to get a
formidable competitor."
