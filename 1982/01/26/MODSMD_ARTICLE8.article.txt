### 
Moscow (AP) — Two hunger strikers in the
U.S. embassy could die within a week, said a
medical source at the embassy, but another
J embassy official said they will be handed over
■ to the Soviets for hospitalization if their con
dition becomes critical.
The two women, who are Pentecostal
Christians, want U.S. officials to do more to
» get exit visas for them and five other mem-
I bers of theirsect who have been holed up in a
room in the embassy basement for three
and-a-half years. The embassy insists that it
has repeatedly pressed the case of the so
called "Siberian Seven" with Soviet author
ities to no avail.
Augustina Vashchenko and her 32-year
old daughter, Lydia, began their fast during
the Christmas holidays to publicize their fam
ily's 20-year struggle to leave the country.
On Sunday, they both refused to drink liq
uids for the first time.

"I don't know how many days I can sur
vive," Vashchenkov, 52, told the Associated
Press.
Her 19-year-old son, Lubov, said he and his
sister Lilia, 23, would begin a hunger strike if
their mother and sister were sent to a hospi
tal. Their father, who also lives at the embassy,
disapproves of the fasts, he said.
The five Vashchenkovs and two members
of the Chmykhalov family slipped past Soviet
guards into the embassy and were granted
humanitarian refugee status on June 27,1978.
The group is known in the West as the
"Siberian Seven" because they come from
the Siberian city of Chernogorsk, 2100 miles
east of Moscow.
Western sources estimate that there are at
least 250,000 Pentecostalists in the Soviet
Union who are defying a law requiring them
to register their congregations with the gov
ernment.
