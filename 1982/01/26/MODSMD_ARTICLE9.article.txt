## Poles flock to play, 'The Police' 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw — The Polish theatre
crowd guffawed when actor
Marian Kociniak, playing the
last political prisoner in an un
named military dictatorship,
tried to persuade the chief of
police that he had truly be
come a believer: "All that free
dom all the time — I couldn't
stand it."
The crowd at the capital's
Ateneum Theater wasenjoying
what has suddenly become the
hit of martial-law Warsaw,
"The Police," by the interna
tionally-renowned expatriate
Polish playwright, Slawomir
Mrozek.
Warsaw's cinemas and thea
ters reopened last week for the
first time since martial law was

proclaimed Dec. 13, featuring
an admittedly modified reper
toire, cleansed of those pro
ductions considered politically
unacceptable in the country's
new circumstances. The newly
banned plays include another
of Mrozek's efforts, "The Am
bassador," a biting political
satire set in the U.S. embassy in
Moscow.
But "The Police" has so far
survived the cultural
crackdown, much to the de
light of Warsaw audiences.
It is the story of a state that
has been so effective in wiping
out opposition that a single po
litical prisoner has become the
justification for the whole
network of policemen, jailers,
and prisons.

When that single prisoner re
forms, after 10 years behind
bars for trying to assassinate a
general with a bomb, the po
lice chief at first tries desper
ately to dissuade him from sign
ing a loyalty oath. When that
fails, the chief finally persuades
one of his own undercover of
ficers — who has been trying
unsuccessfully to provoke
some expression of dissent in a
"wildly loyal" citizenry — to
save the system by turning dis
sident himself.
They applauded when Jan
Swiderski, as the general ruling
as regent for an infant prince,
commented: "Everybody has
to throw a bomb at a general
sometime. It's in people's
blood."

In a country now ruled by
generals, in which some 5000
Solidarity free trade union
leaders and sympathizers are
interned, and where thousands
of others are being subjected
to "ideological verification"
and forced to sign loyalty oaths
or face losing their jobs, the
play has, as one prominent
Polish journalist put it, "sud
denly become very topical."
Saturday night's per
formance drew a capacity
crowd to the 300-seat Ateneum
Theater on the banks of the Vis
tula River near central Warsaw.
The audience was well-dressed
and mostly young.
"Jaruzelski should see this
play," a young woman com
mented to her boyfriend dur
ing an intermission, referring
to Poland's real-life martial-law
chief, Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
