# Schlafly, MacKinnon debate women's rights
## 
### Louise Solomon Senior staff writer 
Controversy and a heated dis
cussion were sparked last night in a
debate between Phyllis Schlafly, a na
tionally active opponent of the Equal
Rights Amendment, and Catherine
MacKinnon, a visiting law professor
and feminist.
The two women spoke to an over
flowing and vocal audience in Kresge
Auditorium on the present and
future situation of women in Ameri
can society.
Schlafly's main points were that
women have a wide range of op
portunities in the society; that they
are not physically equal to men; that
they should not be considered the
same as men; that the feminist move
ment tries to force one conception of
womanhood onto American wom
en; and finally, that the only hin
drance to personal success is the lack
of a sufficiently positive attitude.
Although MacKinnon agreed that
woinen and men are in different situ
ations within our society, she said
these differences are "fundamentally
social," rather than "natural or indi
vidual," and "unjust and imposed,"
rather than "just and inevitable.
"Feminism, embracing traditions
and wisdom coming from socialist
feminism, lesbian feminism and the
feminism of women of color defines
equality differently," said MacKin
non. "Equality to us means the
eradication not of gender differen
tiation, but of gender heirarchy. We
stand for an end to enforced sub
ordination, an end to limited options
and social powerlessness on the basis
of sex for starters. Differentiation for
femininism is just one step in keeping
women down."
"The young woman today has a
tremendous cafeteria display of op
tions for a career," said Schlafly.
"You have every type of possible ca
reer to look forward to. You also have
the opportunity to be a wife or moth
er. Or you have the opportunity to
do different careers at different times
in your life. You also have the great
good fortune to live in a country
where women are better off than in
any other country in the whle
world."
Schlafly called the women's rights
movement a "chip-on-the-shoulder
view of society." She said it offers a
view of society which "calls for the
government to provide some solu
tions to women's problems.
"Fundamentally the Equal Rights
Amendment is a device to change us
into a gender-free society in which
people are denied their rights to

make reasonable differences of
treatment between men and women
and which the power is given to the
federal government to coerce us into
thai type of society," she said. "It
would take away the traditional
rights that women have enjoyed
since the beginning of society."
MacKinnon said, "Feminism
criticizes male pursuits from a wom
en s point of view, from the point of
view of our social experience.
Feminism seeks to empower the
evaluation of women on our own
terms. We seek access to the process
of evaluation definition itself. In this
way our demand for access becomes
also a demand for change.
"Our issue is not gender dif
feerences," she said, "our issue is the
difference gender makes — its social
meaning. We do not seek sameness
with men. We criticize what men
have made of themselves and of the
world that we, too, inhabit. We also
do not seek dominance over men. To
us it is a male notion that power
means that someone must dominate.
We seek a transformation of the con
ditions of defintion, of power, of
heirarchy itself. Feminism is not for a
gender-free society; it is for one in
which sex does not equal inequali
ty."
MacKinnon cited the following
statistics: a recent random sampling
in San Francisco showed 41 percent
of all women said they had been
raped; it is estimated that a third to a
halt of married women experience
violence in their homes — 90 percent
perpetrated by men; and, 63 percent
of all murdered women are married
to their murderers.
"As to the important question of
why women remain in this situation,
many of Mrs. Schlafly's attitudes rein
force that remaining," said MacKin
non. "They tell us to stay, stick it out,
maybe it will get better. I say that the
family legitimizes violence against
women and calls that civilization."
Specific political issues which both
women addressed included the ERA,
abortion and pornography. Schlafly
and MacKinnon agreed that porno
graphy was a crime against women
and an issue which should concern
the women's movement.
The auditorium was packed
beyond normal capacity, with several
people standing and sittng in the
aisles of the lecture hall or listening
outside in the lobby.
Throughout MacKinnon's speech,
she was interrupted by applause and
sounds of approval, and at the end of
her closing remarks, she received a
standing ovation.
