Great seats, free tickets and the same
exhibitionist tendencies that make peo
ple wear lamp shades and dance on tables
at parties are all reasons why Hal
Mickelson, a 30-yearold corporate lawyer
for Hewlett Packard, loves announcing
Stanford Band football shows.
How did this conservative, tone deaf,
"book weanie" from San Pedro, Califor
nia come to be associated with the Stan
ford Band? It was in 1969, Mickelson's jun
ior year at Stanford, when regular band
announcer Don Piatt was drafted for the
Vietnam War and Mickelson was plucked
out of the Stanford undergraduate library
to try out. Thirteen years later, he is still
"the voice of the Stanford Band."
"As an undergraduate I always envied
my friends in the Band — they had a lot of
fun and went a lot of neat places." Be
cause he didn't play a musical instrument
and didn't qualify for Dolly tryouts,
Mickelson said for two years he was an
outsider, "a regular band groupee."
Mickelson plays an integral role in the
Band's performance. "What I try to do is
use my voice as a signature for the band,
they create the shows and present me
with the written formations and I just
make up the jokes,"Mickelson said.
In his current position as a corporate
lawyer, Mickelson says band announcing
was the best job-related training he ever
had. "My ability to clarify obscure legal
matters into simple witty presentations
stems from my announcing experience."
His close association with the band had
led even people at Hewlett Packard to
call him "Uncle Hal" (one of his common
band nicknames) and introduce him to
clients as Hal Mickelson, the infamous
Stanford Band announcer.
However, he's a conservative Re
publican who said he doesn't let his polit
ical viewpoints get in the way. "Today's

Band is really apolitical compared to the
radical nature of the Band in the sixties
and seventies when I first started announ
cing," said Mickelson. "I'd like to see
more shows like the Band's tribute to
Chairman Mao Tse Tung. We had the
most fun we could with the fact that Mao
had just died, and we received hate mail
from both sides (those who hated Mao
said he didn't deserve a tribute and those
who admired him said our tribute was dis
respectful). That's the type of show the
Band should be doing," he said.
"When I first started announcing I can
remember going back to the band shack
and chugging beers until everyone
passed out" Mickelson said, but the social
outlook of today's Band is different, too.
"Today there is less drinking for drink
ing's sake, drinking just to get drunk."
Certain he is tone deaf and thus in no
position to make any qualitative
judgments about the Band's current mu

sical performance, Mickelson does have
one reservation about the band's per
formance in recent years. "The priority
given to having a good time has begun to
overshadow the band working together
as a musical group and over the past five
years not enough attention has been giv
en to ensemble," he said.
Drum major Disco Ray Gruenewald
however is a tremendously talented musi
cian, according to Mickelson who pre
dicts beginning basketball season "we
can expect to hear some new and exciting
musical departures."
Though he hopes totrain another Sta
nford student to someday replace him as
announcer, Mickelson says,"I will stay as
long as I keep having fun and the Band
keeps asking me back. The Band and I
have a standing agreement — they can
fire me any time they want as long as they
tell me far enough in advance so I can still
buy next season's football tickets."
