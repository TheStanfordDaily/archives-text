Since she arrived from Yorkshire, England
two years ago, Anne Parry has been selling
flowers almost every day in White Plaza. And
as the many students who buy flowers from
her know, the "Flower Lady" does more

'You'd be surprised how
much you can learn about
people just from selling
them flowers. Sometimes I
see myself as a
psychoanalyst. Many
people pour out their
troubles to me / because
they know I'll stay and
listen/
— Anne Parry

than just sell flowers — she counsels students
on a wide range of topics.
"You'd be surprised how much you can
learn about people just from selling them
flowers," said Parry. "Sometimes I see myself
as a psychoanalyst. I think students find it

easy to talk to me because I'm not a student,
yet I can relate to their problems. Many peo
ple pour out their troubles to me, because
they know I'll stay and listen."
Parry, who graduated from Cambridge
with a degree in French and German, came
to California to be with her husband Neal,
who attends Stanford Business School.
Though she never dreamed she'd be sell
ing flowers, Parry said sheenjoys it because it
makes her feel like part of the University.
"I catch bitsand pieces of conversations as
people walk by which keep me informed.
And I can always tell when it's Secret Santa
time or the opening night of a play," she
said.
Parry finds the job can too often be amus
ing. "Like the time three naked boys ran up
to buy three red roses and then presented
them to three women walking through
White Plaza."
Besides selling flowers, Parry is also a
housewife and a professional masseuse, who
also makes house calls.
Parry does not own the flower stand, but
works for Larry Torquino, owner of "The
Flower Man," which has been located in
White Plaza for the last nine years.
According to Parry, business is so steady,
that "sometimes I don't even have time to
finish knitting a whole row in between cus
tomers!"
