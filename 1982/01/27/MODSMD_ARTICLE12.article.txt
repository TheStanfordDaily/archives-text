## Jack Wall

Jack Wall is a Stanford University Park
ing Violation officer who takes his job se
riously. "People don't even think about it
(where they park). If I were to stop ticket
ing, in less than one month there would
bo cars parked on top of Hoover Tower if
they could figure out a way to get them up
there," Wall said.
Suffering from the financial burden of
the 1971 recession, Wall was unable to
keep his small service station in Sunnyvale
and came to the Community Service De
partment at Stanford University where he
got his present job.
"Most vehicle owners on the Stanford
Campus are confronted with a serious
parking problem, and it's a problem that's
getting more and more critical," said
Wall, adding that the conduction of each
new building eliminates two to four hun
dred parking spots with no new ones

'People don't even think
about it (where they park).

in less than one month
there would be cars
parked on top of Hoover
Tower if they could figure
out a way to get them up
thereV

being built.
"The only way to remedy the parking
problem," Wall said, "is for everyone to
obey the rules." He said he believes ev
eryone has to give upsomething in life, so
it may as well be twenty dollars for a park
ing sticker.
"There are 20 to 25 regu
lars — cars I ticket every day. In fact, I
even write their tickets out ahead of time
knowing the cars will be illegally parked,"
he said, adding that students see the stack
of parking tickets piled under their wind
shields as a status symbol that must make
them feel good.
"It's like playing Chinese checkers,"
Wall said, describing one woman on his
Encina beat who used to move her car ev
ery hour to erase his chalk marks. "I used
to mark her tire up to eight times a day but
I got so sick of it I finally reported her to
her boss. Now she parks her car legally,"
he explained.
Wall says he gets all kinds of excuses,
but has a stock answer that's true. "Once I
write a ticket past the license number it
belongs to the Municipal Court and I
can't stop writing it."
Although Wall himself has received a
parking ticket or two, he says he has no
sympathy for violators. Although he re
fused to repeat many of the comments he
gets, he did say he was once asked wheth
er he sleeps well at night after giving out
tickets all day, and said he responded," I
certainly do because once I leave Stan
ford my jobstays here and that'sthe way it
should be."
