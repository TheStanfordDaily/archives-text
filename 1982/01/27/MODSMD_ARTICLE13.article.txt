# Always ready with an answer...
## Portia Holmes 
### Jane McConnell 
Not many people on campus are asked for
the quickest route to the airport, a schedule
of who is entertaining at the Coffee House
that evening, and the recipe for meatloaf, all
within a day's work. But Portia Holmes is.
As the coordinator of Tresidder Union's
information center, Holmes is expected to
know the answers to these and countless
other questions. And after 15 years here, she
rarely gets asked a question she can't answer.
Holmes began working at the information
center, located in the second floor lobby of
Tresidder Union, when it was still just a
check-cashing center. People would ask her
questions, and she would try her best to an
swer them. Later, when the check-cashing
services were moved to the bank, Holmes
began concentrating full-time on answering
questions and giving information.
"Someone would ask a question and I'd
want to be able to answer it next time
around, so I'd collect information. It's what
anyone with a grain of sense would have
done," she says.
