# Always ready with an answer...
## Portia Holmes 
### Jane McConnell 
Not many people on campus are asked for
the quickest route to the airport, a schedule
of who is entertaining at the Coffee House
that evening, and the recipe for meatloaf, all
within a day's work. But Portia Holmes is.
As the coordinator of Tresidder Union's
information center, Holmes is expected to
know the answers to these and countless
other questions. And after 15 years here, she
rarely gets asked a question she can't answer.
Holmes began working at the information
center, located in the second floor lobby of
Tresidder Union, when it was still just a
check-cashing center. People would ask her
questions, and she would try her best to an
swer them. Later, when the check-cashing
services were moved to the bank, Holmes
began concentrating full-time on answering
questions and giving information.
"Someone would ask a question and I'd
want to be able to answer it next time
around, so I'd collect information. It's what
anyone with a grain of sense would have
done," she says.

The center has since grown
into a central part of the cam
pus, "the hub of the Univer
sity," as Holmes puts it. From 8
a.m. to 10 p.m. information
seekers frequent the desk, and
always come away with either
an answer to their question, or
a referral to someone who can
answer it.
"I hardly ever get asked
something that hasn't been
asked before," says Holmes. "I
guess that comes from being
here so long."
Once, however, she admits
she was thrown off when
someone said they had gotten
an invitation from the
Bachelor's Club, and wanted to
know if it existed. "It finally
turned out to be a real or
ganization, run through
Bowman Alumni House," she
recalls.
In addition to inquiries like
this, the center provides daily,
up-to-date information on
what's going on around cam
pus. An events notebook, con
taining details on films, lec
tures and concerts,is updated
every day by Holmes. In addi

tion, she spends about a half
hour each morning making a
daily events tape which covers
just about everything going on
about campus for that particu
lar day. Holmes culls informa
tion from Once Around The
Quad, Daily ads, the Campus
Report, the weekly calendar,
and student flyers. The tape
can be reached by dialing
497-0336.
Not only does Holmes know
what's going on around Stan
ford, she also can direct people
to places surrounding the cam
pus. Local transit information,
train schedules and routes of
tours in the area are all at her
fingertips, and for questions
she cannot answer, there is a
courtesy phone which covers
the Bay Area.
Holmes is old-fashioned and
thorough in her methods. Her
information is contained on 3
by 5 index cards in a recipe file.
"None of these fancy com
puters for me!" she chuckles.
She always tries to give current,
accurate information, and is
constantly updating her
sources.
The interaction with people

is what Holmes cites as her fa
vorite part of the job. "I also en
joy doing the research and get
ting the satisfaction of finding
the right answers," she says.
Over the years, she has been
asked some memorable ques
tions. "There was once a
freshman who seemed kind of
lonely and kept coming back to
the desk," she says. "One day
he asked me to feel his fore
head and tell him if he had a
fever."
Another time â€” "The In
ternational Center sent the ov
erseas students on a treasure
hunt, and they had to locate a
statue of a gargoyle on campus.
I knew where the gryphons
were, but I had never seen a
gargoyle. Finally we found it,
under the corner eaves of the
International Center."
Holmes graduated from
Stanford herself in 1941, after
two years at a junior college. "I
come from a family very famil
iar with Stanford," she says.
Her former husband, three
children, two of their spouses,
both her brothers, a sister-in
law and a nephew all went to
Stanford as well.
