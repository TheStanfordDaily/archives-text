# Determined to get a smile...
## Dean Seldonridge 
### Debbie Appel 
Even after waiting in a long line at the cam
era supplies counter, Stanford Bookstore
shoppers are apt to walk away with a smile.
The pleasant atmosphere is provided by
Dean Seldonridge, whose hearty, "You're
welcome!" and cheerful disposition can
brighten even the most somber winter day.
Seldonridge has been working in various
departments at the Bookstore for the past
ten years. She fondly describes her em
ployers as "easy-going, lenient and under
standing. They're infinitely patient, and let
you have time off if you feel you need it."
Seldonridge especially enjoys the degree
of personal interaction her job entails. "I
love the people contact. Students here are so
open and natural. We rarely have a rude cus
tomer. By and large everyone is really nice."
This past holiday season, Seldonridge re
ceived a bottle of wine and a sheaf of greet

ing cards from admiring customers.
When asked about her secret for (cons
tant) geniality, Seldonridge shyly insists that
she, "treats people the way I'd like to be
treated. It's not a conscious thing. I guess I
just come across as cheerful, even when I'm
down or don't feel well. I don't take it out on
the customer. It's a challenge to me when I
see someone with a sour face — I'm de
termined to get a smile!"
Seldonridge has lived in the Palo Alto area
for most of her 34 years. She enjoys drawing
and singing although she hastily adds, "just
for my own pleasure!"
Seldonridge does not consider herself a
political activist. "I have a lot of opinions, I
just don't doanythingabout it," but she does
support the ERA movement. "I believe in
equal pay for equal jobs, but I'm not an ex
tremist. I'm not for women fighting on the
front line."
Seldonridge has no immediate plans for
the future but she says she does not want to
work at the Bookstore for the rest of her life.
"I'm sort of in a rut right now. Basically I'm
just concentrating on getting myself togeth
er. I want to make myself a better person."
Although she plans to seek a "better
paying job," Seldonridge is not sure in what
direction she will turn," I don't know what I
want to do except that I definitely want to
work with the public!"

'(I) treat people the way
I'd like to be treated. It's
not a conscious thing. /
guess I just come across as
very cheerful, even when
I'm down or don't feel
well. I don't take it out on
the customer. It's a
challenge to me when I
see someone with a sour
face — I'm determined to
get a smile!'
