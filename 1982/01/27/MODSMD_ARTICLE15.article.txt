An important battle between academic and
government officials over increased restrictions
by the State Departmenton the visitationsof
foreign scholars to U.S. universities came toa
head last week.
University officials made itcleartothe
National Academy of Science (NAS)and the
State Department that Stanford will not accept
responsibility for watchdogging the research of
Soviet robotics expert Nikolai Umnov, nor will it
allow government fearsof academicespionage
by visiting scholars interrupt the open research
atmosphere that is maintained here.
Although NAS responded by canceling the
portion of the scholar's visit to the United States
when he wastostudy here, the University's
unequivocal position on the issue served as a
significant statement of displeasure with
government attempts to impose restrictions on
academic research.
Granted, the State Department has an
important responsibility to safeguard the
secrecy of classified scientific advances which
contain potentially valuable military
applications. In the past the Soviet Union has
made extensive efforts, with a certain measure
of success, to swipe American technology using
ingenious techniques of espionage to get its
hands on U.S. blueprints and hardware.
However, the government has several
channels it can use to combat technological
espionage without infringing on the academic
community.
For a Soviet scientist to receive passage into
the United States, he now must passan interview
by a screening committee composed of
representatives from the CIA and the State,
Commerce and Defense Departments. It isthe
committee's responsibility to determine the

nature of the scholar's visit and whether he
should be considered a security threat. But it is
unnecessary to restrict access to American
research on a subject about which the foreign
scholar already knows more than we do. This is
the case in the State Department's ill-founded
concern over Umnov's visit.
The government also, of course, hasthe ability
to classify research it deems vital to the security
of America. Concern over easy access to
sensitive research in U.S. universities should
result in the classification of such projects by the
State Department rather than the
implementation of government-issued access
restrictions. As Physics Prof, and Nobel laureate
Arthur Schawlow put it, restrictions placed on
viewing unclassified research represent a
contradiction in terms.
In 1971, with the severance of Stanford
Research Institute (now SRI) and its often
classified, defense-related research, from the
University, Stanford established the policy that
its programs represent basicand unclassified
research. President Donald Kennedyandother
University officials have continued to defend
this position throughout the recent controversy,
arguing that the application of restrictions on
unclassified projects could seriously disrupt the
environment necessary to foster successful
research. Gaining the participation of a noted
scientist at the cost of the open research
environment he came to visit is no gain at all.
We support the firm stance the University has
taken to maintain a research environment free
from hindering governmental restrictions. The
free exchange of scientific knowledge is vital to
the institution of education and must be
defended at all costs when threatened by an
overprotective arm of the government.
