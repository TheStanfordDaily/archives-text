## Daily criticism of Stanford police unfounded 
### 
This will respond to several asser
tions in the recent (Daily, Jan. 18) edi
torial concernng police communica
tion at Stanford.
Assertion: "Sketchy reports about
the rapist's modus operandi have
been provided through University
News Service; there have been, how
ever, significant gaps. Did he carry a
weapon? How did he approach his
victims? Is there any particular advice
the police could offer women to
avoid future attacks? We have asked
these questions of the police, many
times to no avail."
Response: News Service has con
veyed all pertinent informatin avail
able to it from the police: when and
where the assaults occurred, and a
general description of the suspect(s)
and what happened. So far, for
tunately, no weapons have been
used, so far as we know. The assaults
often occur with such speed that vic
tims have difficulty describing pre
cisely what happened.
The police have frequently pro
vided advice on how to avoid attacks;
the main problem from a news stand
point is that the information is ex
tremely repetitive. As advertised
(Daily, Jan. 18), Chief Marvin Her
rington had scheduled a series of
public meetings, with a film, to go
over this information again.
we are sensitive
to the victims' ordeal, we do not be
lieve they should exercise an un

qualified veto over the release of in
formation that might allow others to
protect themselves from violent
crime The danger to potential
victims not alerted to the full story
must not block the release of impor
tant information."
Response: This implies that some
vital information has been withheld.
To the best of my knowledge, that
simply is not the case. \s it vital to
know the precise bush from which an
assailant appeared or the exact words
with which motorist accosted a
potential victim, provided she can re
call them?
Assertion: "We question the poli
cy of directly releasing information
only through the University News
Service. This practice lends the sani
tized aura of a public relations re
lease to the information on the part
of the editors and the public."
Response: Police have tried to dis
seminate information widely, rapid
ly, and accurately through News Ser
vice. Herrington and others have
spoken on many occasions to re
porters from the Daily and from oth
er news organizations. They may not
always be available, however, partic
ularly when conducting investiga
tions.
Assertion: "We urge University
President Donald Kennedy to pro
vide financial support to police ef

forts to make the campus safer."
Response: As noted in a recent
news release, President Kennedy has
authorized increased spending for
additional patrols.

Assessment refunds
I am astounded by the Dai/y's self
serving negative editorial (Daily, Jan.
22) on fee assessment refunds and
feel the issue should be put in proper
perspective and strongly rebutted.
The key point the Daily seems to
make is that the students may be out
for a few "fast and easy bucks" and
that they are "going to the ASSU of
fice and collecting $20 simply be
cause it's there." Wrong. They are
going through a lot of grief to re
cover money that they didn't want to
spend, and was and is theirs.
With a uniquely unfair voting sys
tem where a 20 percent turnout with
a simple majority (barely 10 percent
of the student body in most cases)
passes a fee assessment, not voting at
all is preferable to voting no on an
issue. Most students are very aware
that a "NO" vote may actually help
pass a proposal they don't want to
fund, therefore the large group who
purposely don't vote are actually vot
ing. Unfortunately, they are not ac
counted for in our ill-conceived vot
ing system.
Until our system actually registers
how many students are against a giv

en fee proposal fee refunds are not
just a necessity, but fortunately, a
guaranteed right. A simple majority,
witjh the unwitting help of the "NO"
voters may pass a fee assessment be
cause of a poorly designed system,
but happily because of a rare case of
legislative wisdom, we who don't
support a particular fee assessment,
may get our money back. The
audacious suggestion by the Daily
that utilizing this right is somehow
improper or rash, is ludicrous, and
obviously self-seeking.
The fact that we must go stand in
line (for upwards of an hour in many
cases), sign lists, etc, is unbelievable,
and dissuades many students from
getting a refund from those groups
they wish not to support. How about
paying us for our time doing this, as
well as interest on borrowing our
money for over a month? Don't like
that idea? Well how about this: If the
student body truly supports a fee
proposal, why not make the "hardly
unreasonable" $1 per group fee truly
democratic by letting us check off
and pay those whom we choose to
support during registration, just like
a meal plan?
It isn't the fee refund system which
is a farce, but the fee assessment sys
tem. Take the time to use your right
of refund to vote against those pro
grams which you don't want to fund
this week!
