## Develop healthy world view 
### 
Last week, I decided that I would
write this column on the issue of le
galized abortions. My inain goal, I re
solved, would be to try and deliver a
"pro-life" argument without seem
ing presumptuous or insensitive to
those for whom abortion has been a
very difficult and very painful reality.
After a while, though, the idea of
battling through the rigors of "pro
life" stance seemed silly. Who would
I be talking to, after all? Who is "anti
life?" But as I wrote, I kept thinking of
more and more attitudes, events, and

policies that seemed more"anti-life"
oriented than "pro-life" oriented.
First of all, I thought of the average
person's view towards abortion —
someone pretty much like myself.
Surely the average person is not
"anti-life." Perhaps not, but then I
began to examine my own attitude
towards people who have abortions
and, more appropriately, my attitude
towards people who don't have
abortions — unwed parents, their
children, etc. My first impulse is
always to see such people with some
contempt, and to see them as some
how sordid and unclean, and thus
less worthy of mine and others' atten
tin as members of society.
Secondly, I began to wonder why
abortion is less harsh a "reality" to
me than it is for those who actually
have their children aborted. That
such an alternative to pregnancy is
available, and that killing a fetus is
seen by many as a more attractive op
tion than is delivering arnd raising the
child, implicates all of us as partici
pants in a society that has allowed this
situation to occur.
From the first grade, I've been re
citing the American creeds that pro
claim humans' "inalienable rights,"
and that "all men are created equal."
Also, in church I've found that each
individual is God's highest creation
— the most valuable creature in the
universe — and that God treats each
of us as such.
In this light, the idea of being "pro
life" took on a new, more literal defi
nition; a definition filled with re
sponsibility. To be pro-life meansex
actly what it says — to be committed
to affirming and supporting human
life, wherever we may find it. To
merely clamor for the banning of
abortions seems short-sighted and
self-congratulatory. If every human
life is inalienably and supremely val
uable, then we should develop a so
cial climate where all people are
cherished, rather than one where
only the perfect are appreciated and
those of us who make mistakes are
chastized and ostracized.
Don't get me wrong — I'm still not
crazy about abortion. I am in favor of
life. But I am also realizing that to be
pro-life means more than forcing

people to raise undesired children.
We need consider every human life
as something extraordinary, and to
treat all people accordingly.
There are other areas in which
such a "pro-life" stance would elicit
changes in our attitudes. Toseesome
people starve to death should re
pulse someone committed to treat
ing every person as the most valuable
creature in the universe. We might
then, give out of our abundance to
help meet peoples' basic needs like
food, clothing and shelter; or we
might turn and say that some people
deserve to starve, but we certainly
don't, and go on as usual.
We could make a world hungeror
ganization our favorite national char
itv instead of having the Pentagon be
our favorite national charity. A
trillion dollar arms budget, not to
mention the drastic welfare cut
backs, hardly reflects our interest in
loving our neighbors as ourselves.
You may have noticed by now, that
there are more questions in this essay
than there are answers. I guess I'm
not quite sure where one should be
gin in trying to affirm human equal
ity, but I am sure that if we believe in
this equality, we should practice it.
Perhaps the most basic step would be
to begin to care about others as much
as we care about ourselves; others
meaning all the men and women that
we come into contact with, as well as
people who are hungry, and people
who do not always agree with our
government.
Unfortunately, this is probably the
most important change that we could
make — to develop an appreciation
of people's inherent worth, by treat
ing all people as inherently worthy of
our respect and service. Thus de
fined, being "pro-life" would be
come a healthy, practicable world
view in which everyone matters.
1 hen, our national policies regarding
matters like abortion, civil defense
and world hunger could arise out of
our national value position of in
alienable human dignity and equal
ity.

treat all people accordingly.
There are other areas in which
such a "pro-life" stance would elicit
changes in our attitudes. Toseesome
people starve to death should re
pulse someone committed to treat
ing every person as the most valuable
creature in the universe. We might
then, give out of our abundance to
help meet peoples' basic needs like
food, clothing and shelter; or we
might turn and say that some people
deserve to starve, but we certainly
don't, and go on as usual.
We could make a world hungeror
ganization our favorite national char
itv instead of having the Pentagon be
our favorite national charity. A
trillion dollar arms budget, not to
mention the drastic welfare cut
backs, hardly reflects our interest in
loving our neighbors as ourselves.
You may have noticed by now, that
there are more questions in this essay
than there are answers. I guess I'm
not quite sure where one should be
gin in trying to affirm human equal
ity, but I am sure that if we believe in
this equality, we should practice it.
Perhaps the most basic step would be
to begin to care about others as much
as we care about ourselves; others
meaning all the men and women that
we come into contact with, as well as
people who are hungry, and people
who do not always agree with our
government.
Unfortunately, this is probably the
most important change that we could
make — to develop an appreciation
of people's inherent worth, by treat
ing all people as inherently worthy of
our respect and service. Thus de
fined, being "pro-life" would be
come a healthy, practicable world
view in which everyone matters.
1 hen, our national policies regarding
matters like abortion, civil defense
and world hunger could arise out of
our national value position of in
alienable human dignity and equal
ity.

Last week, I decided that I would
write this column on the issue of le
galized abortions. My inain goal, I re
solved, would be to try and deliver a
"pro-life" argument without seem
ing presumptuous or insensitive to
those for whom abortion has been a
very difficult and very painful reality.
After a while, though, the idea of
battling through the rigors of "pro
life" stance seemed silly. Who would
I be talking to, after all? Who is "anti
life?" But as I wrote, I kept thinking of
more and more attitudes, events, and

policies that seemed more"anti-life"
oriented than "pro-life" oriented.
First of all, I thought of the average
person's view towards abortion —
someone pretty much like myself.
Surely the average person is not
"anti-life." Perhaps not, but then I
began to examine my own attitude
towards people who have abortions
and, more appropriately, my attitude
towards people who don't have
abortions — unwed parents, their
children, etc. My first impulse is
always to see such people with some
contempt, and to see them as some
how sordid and unclean, and thus
less worthy of mine and others' atten
tin as members of society.
Secondly, I began to wonder why
abortion is less harsh a "reality" to
me than it is for those who actually
have their children aborted. That
such an alternative to pregnancy is
available, and that killing a fetus is
seen by many as a more attractive op
tion than is delivering arnd raising the
child, implicates all of us as partici
pants in a society that has allowed this
situation to occur.
From the first grade, I've been re
citing the American creeds that pro
claim humans' "inalienable rights,"
and that "all men are created equal."
Also, in church I've found that each
individual is God's highest creation
— the most valuable creature in the
universe — and that God treats each
of us as such.
In this light, the idea of being "pro
life" took on a new, more literal defi
nition; a definition filled with re
sponsibility. To be pro-life meansex
actly what it says — to be committed
to affirming and supporting human
life, wherever we may find it. To
merely clamor for the banning of
abortions seems short-sighted and
self-congratulatory. If every human
life is inalienably and supremely val
uable, then we should develop a so
cial climate where all people are
cherished, rather than one where
only the perfect are appreciated and
those of us who make mistakes are
chastized and ostracized.
Don't get me wrong — I'm still not
crazy about abortion. I am in favor of
life. But I am also realizing that to be
pro-life means more than forcing

people to raise undesired children.
We need consider every human life
as something extraordinary, and to
treat all people accordingly.
