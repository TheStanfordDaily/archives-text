## Sioux tribe sues mining company 
### Peggy Hernandez 
A Sioux tribe filed a $6 billion suit
yesterday against the Homestake
Mining Company of San Francisco in
an attempt to gain compensation for
and regain ownership of Black Hills, a
mining site in South Dakota.
The Oglala Sioux Tribe of the Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation in South
Dakota filed their suit in United
States District Court in San Jose, and
lawyers of the tribe announced their
suit yesterday at a press conference
held at the University's Native Ameri
can Cultural Center.
Black Hills, which yields gold and
silver, is located on the Pine Ridge
reservation and is owned by Home
stake. The company is owned in part
by the Hearst Corporation.
History of attempts
The suit is the Oglala Sioux's latest
attempt to regain Black Hills. The
tribe has been appealing to Federal
courts for the past 105 years to regain
ownership.
On jan. 18, the Supreme Court re
fused to hear an appeal on a lower
court ruling that limited the Indians
to a $105 million compensation rath
er than the land itself. The tribe is
now appealing to the Supreme Court
on the basis of the Fifth Amendment.
The amendment states that". . . no
person shall be deprived of life, liber
ty or property without due process of
law, nor shall private property be
taken for public jse without just
compensation."
Billions gained from mining
The Oglala Sioux argue the gov
ernment's cash compensation is pro
portionately inadequate because
mining in the Black Hills has yeilded
$50 billion, said Sidney Flores, one of
the tribe's three lawyers.
"That means Black Hills' value was

$6 billion in the 1800s," Flores said.
The Oglala Sioux said government
deprivation of the mine has con
tributed to their poor economic and
physical health. Youngblood Hen
derson, another of the tribes' at
torneys, said they have filed the suit
to"unwind the mythology of why In
dians are poor, how they lost their
wealth and why."
Sacred site
The tribe also said the land is con
sidered a sacred site where allied In
dian tribes practice traditional and
contemporary religions. The lawyers
said the suit demands redress for
"larceny and trespass of the (Black
Hills) miners."
Black Hills was made a permanent
part of the Great Sioux Reservation in
the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. But,
in 1874, an expedition lead by Lieut.
Col. George Custer discovered gold
in the hills. In 1877, through an act of
Congress, the Federal Government
seized the land. The land was then
sold by prospectors to three San
Francisco men, one of whom was
George Hearst, father of publishing
magnate William Randolph Hearst.
'The facts of law'
The Oglala Sioux announced their
suit at Stanford because "Stanford
has always been close to the entire
Indian community," Henderson said.
"We have sent our children here to
be educated."
Henderson said he is confident the
tribe will win its suit "because the
facts of law favor us."
The Homestake Mining Company
called the suit "frivolous" in a pre
pared statement released by its San
Francisco headquarters. The release
said the company felt the suit has
been adequately settled in past court
action.
