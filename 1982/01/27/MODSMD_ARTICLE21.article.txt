## Five airlines nearing bankruptcy 
### Los Angeles Times 
New York — Concern is
mounting among lenders and
suppliers to the nation's air
lines that the rapidly de
teriorating financial condition
of half a dozen major carriers
threatens to force one or more
into bankruptcy, causing siz
able writeoffs at banks and in
surance companies and a pain
ful contraction of orders for
new aircraft.
"Do you realize," laments
one New York banker, "that
five major U.S. airlines right
now are flirting with
bankruptcy?" Adds another,
"Instead of worrying about our
Polish debt, you ought to be
asking about our airline debt."
According to analysts, the
domestic carriers fighting for
survival are Braniff Interna
tional, Continental Airlines,
Pan American World Airways,
Republic Airlines and Western
Airlines. The chairman of a
sixth, Frank Borman of Eastern
Air Lines, has told employees
that the carrier, which lost
$39.2 million in the first nine
months of 1981 and labors un
der a massive burden of debt,
must earn a profit in 1982 or it
will be cut drastically in size.
Despite their problems, the
airlines' creditors have thus far
continued to support the car
riers, in some cases by defer
ring payments on existing loans
or extending emergency new
loans. Ailing Braniff, with $161
million in principal and interest
due its lenders Feb. 1, on Friday
won extension of its debt re
payment schedule.
Last; year the world's major
airlines racked up a staggering
$2.1 billion in losses. U.S.-
based airlines — buffeted by
recession, rising costs, reduced
traffic from the air controllers
strike, increased competition
from deregulation and in some
cases nearly suicidal fare wars
— have chalked up an all-time
record loss that could climb to
$300 million for 1981.
George James, chief econo
mist for the Air Transport As
sociation in Washington, D.C.,
says: "When final 1981 results
are compiled, the industry
could show lis worst year ever.
Moreover, prospects for 1982
are not encouraging, making

the 1979-to-1982, four-year fi
nancial performance the worst
in the.history of scheduled air
line service."
All distressing news is
causing plenty of discomfort
for airline lenders. According
to the Air Transport Associa
tion, the nation's 16 largest car
riers in 1981 had $10.1 billion in
long-term debt, including
leases. Creditors are most con
cerned about possible
writeoffs, because they come
directly out of profits. But the
lenders are also unhappy about
the alternative — placing a siz
able number of loans in the
category of "nonperforming
assets," i.e, loans that collect
no interest.
1 he investment banking firm
Salomon Bros., in a recent re
port, identifies Braniff and Re
public as the most seriously
troubled U.S. airlines. Dallas
based Braniff, with more than
$650 million in debt and sub
stantial operating losses, no
longer has any equity — its lia
bilities are greater than its as
sets. The only reason its planes
continue to fly is that a group of
lenders have extended ex
traordinary support.

The creditors, which include
22 banks, 15 insurance com
panies and two suppliers,
Boeing Co. and United Tech
nologies Corp., deferred
payments of $83 million in
principal and $38 million in in
terest due last July, and have
forgiven all interest payments
through Feb. 1. The big ques
tion is whether they will agree
to similar terms for another
eight months. If any one of the
lenders refuses to go along,
Braniff could be forced into
bankruptcy.
Republic Airlines has been
hemorrhaging ever since the
Professional Air Traffic Con
trollers strike began last Au
gust. The Minneapolis-based
airline grew rapidly in the past
three years from three back-to
back mergers among North
Central Airlines Inc., Southern
Airways Inc. and Hughes
Airwest. The mergers, plus big
aircraft purchases, saddled the
carrier with debt and operating
problems that now threaten its
existence. Compounding its
problems is the fact that two
thirds of Republic's $700 mil
lion in debt is pegged toa float

ing rate V* to Vi percentage
points above prime.
So far Republic's lead lender,
Citibank, and other major
creditors including Continen
tal Illinois Bank, First National
Bank of Chicago, Bank of
America, Crocker National
Bank and Security Pacific Na
tional Bank are working with
Republic in an effort to cut
costs, defer new aircraft
purchases and sell some
planes. But the market for used
aircraft is already glutted, with
more than 100 wide-body jets
for sale.
Also on the critical list is New
York City-based Pan Am,
which ran out of cash last Au
gust only to be saved by a hasti
ly arranged loan from its len
ders. Pan Am was almost forced
into bankruptcy, however,
when Chase Manhattan Bank
refused to go along with a new
$475-million line of credit to
replace an older credit line.
Chase's move caused some
smaller banks in the 21-bank
consortium led by Citibank to
pull out, but the airline was
saved by an emergency loan of
$200 million.

in the.history of scheduled air
line service."
All distressing news is
causing plenty of discomfort
for airline lenders. According
to the Air Transport Associa
tion, the nation's 16 largest car
riers in 1981 had $10.1 billion in
long-term debt, including
leases. Creditors are most con
cerned about possible
writeoffs, because they come
directly out of profits. But the
lenders are also unhappy about
the alternative — placing a siz
able number of loans in the
category of "nonperforming
assets," i.e, loans that collect
no interest.

Salomon Bros., in a recent re

public as the most seriously
troubled U.S. airlines. Dallas
based Braniff, with more than
$650 million in debt and sub
stantial operating losses, no
longer has any equity — its lia
bilities are greater than its as
sets. The only reason its planes
continue to fly is that a group of
lenders have extended ex
traordinary support.

payments of $83 million in

forgiven all interest payments
through Feb. 1. The big ques

to similar terms for another
eight months. If any one of the
lenders refuses to go along,
Braniff could be forced into
bankruptcy.
Republic Airlines has been
hemorrhaging ever since the

airline grew rapidly in the past
three years from three back-to
back mergers among North
Central Airlines Inc., Southern
Airways Inc. and Hughes
Airwest. The mergers, plus big
aircraft purchases, saddled the
carrier with debt and operating
problems that now threaten its
existence. Compounding its
problems is the fact that two
thirds of Republic's $700 mil
lion in debt is pegged toa float

ing rate V* to Vi percentage
points above prime.
So far Republic's lead lender,
Citibank, and other major
creditors including Continen
tal Illinois Bank, First National
Bank of Chicago, Bank of
America, Crocker National
Bank and Security Pacific Na
tional Bank are working with
Republic in an effort to cut
costs, defer new aircraft
purchases and sell some
planes. But the market for used
aircraft is already glutted, with
more than 100 wide-body jets
for sale.
Also on the critical list is New
York City-based Pan Am,
which ran out of cash last Au
gust only to be saved by a hasti
ly arranged loan from its len
ders. Pan Am was almost forced
into bankruptcy, however,
when Chase Manhattan Bank
refused to go along with a new
$475-million line of credit to
replace an older credit line.
Chase's move caused some
smaller banks in the 21-bank
consortium led by Citibank to
pull out, but the airline was
saved by an emergency loan of
$200 million.

New York — Concern is
mounting among lenders and
suppliers to the nation's air
lines that the rapidly de
teriorating financial condition
of half a dozen major carriers
threatens to force one or more
into bankruptcy, causing siz
able writeoffs at banks and in
surance companies and a pain
ful contraction of orders for
new aircraft.
"Do you realize," laments
one New York banker, "that
five major U.S. airlines right
now are flirting with
bankruptcy?" Adds another,
"Instead of worrying about our
Polish debt, you ought to be
asking about our airline debt."
According to analysts, the
domestic carriers fighting for
survival are Braniff Interna
tional, Continental Airlines,
Pan American World Airways,
Republic Airlines and Western
Airlines. The chairman of a
sixth, Frank Borman of Eastern
Air Lines, has told employees
that the carrier, which lost
$39.2 million in the first nine
months of 1981 and labors un
der a massive burden of debt,
must earn a profit in 1982 or it
will be cut drastically in size.
Despite their problems, the
airlines' creditors have thus far
continued to support the car
riers, in some cases by defer
ring payments on existing loans
or extending emergency new
loans. Ailing Braniff, with $161
million in principal and interest
due its lenders Feb. 1, on Friday
won extension of its debt re
payment schedule.
Last; year the world's major
airlines racked up a staggering
$2.1 billion in losses. U.S.-
based airlines — buffeted by
recession, rising costs, reduced
traffic from the air controllers
strike, increased competition
from deregulation and in some
cases nearly suicidal fare wars
— have chalked up an all-time
record loss that could climb to
$300 million for 1981.
George James, chief econo
mist for the Air Transport As
sociation in Washington, D.C.,
says: "When final 1981 results
are compiled, the industry
could show lis worst year ever.
Moreover, prospects for 1982
are not encouraging, making
