# Poll vetoes school tax break

### 
New York — Three of four Americans think
private schools that practice racial discrimina
tion should not have tax-exempt status, ac
cording to the latest Associated Press-NBC
News poll.
The nationwide scientific telephone poll of
1597 adults said 75 percent think tax exemp
tions should not be available for private
schools that practice racial discrimination,
while 18 percent said the exemptions should
be available and 7 percent were not sure.
In the poll, 34 percent said President
Ronald Reagan is doing a good or excellent
job in handling civil rights issues, while 38
percent said he is doing an only fair job, 19
percent said a poor job and 9 percent were
not sure.
The Reagan administration's attitudes on
civil rights came into question earlier this
month after the Treasury and Justice depart
ments announced that the Internal Revenue
Service must end an 11-year-old policy of de
nying federal tax exemptions to private
schools which refuse to admit blacks or oth
erwise racially discriminate.
Reagan's 34 percent approval rating for civ
il rights was below his overall performance

rating; 46 percent said he is doing a good or
excellent job as president.
In a news conference last week, Reagan
said it had been his idea to end IRS denial of
tax exemptions. However, he said the de
cision had been misinterpreted as a policy
change when it was only a procedural move
to limit what he felt was an illegal extension of
IRS authority.
Amid protests by civil rights groups —
which had already criticized Reagan's posi
tions on the Voting Rights Act and various
budget cuts for social programs — the presi
dent urged Congress to pass legislation deny
ing tax breaks to racially discriminatory
schools.
In the latest AP-NBC News poll, Re
publicans were twice as likely as Democrats
to give the president a good or excellent rat
ing for his handling of civil rights.
More than half the black respondents said
they would give the president a poor rating.
And the more educated the respondent,
the more likely a response opposing tax ex
emptions for schools that racially dis
criminate.
