Ontario, N.Y. — The emer
gency caused by a steam tube
rupture at the R.E. Ginna nu
clear plant was declared at an
end yesterday as technicians
worked to bring the reactor to
cold shutdown.
The plant, run by Rochester
Gas & Electric Corp., had been
in emergency stages for 26
hours since the accident Mon
day morning.
"The emergency is over. The
situation is stable. Operators
are making preparations for
the cleanup of the spilled wa
ter," said Jan Strasma, spokes
man for the Nuclear Regu
latory Commission. "It's the
mop-up phase, if you will."
Officials said the reactor was
cooling down satisfactorily and
a cold shutdown — the process
of bringing the reactor's tem
perature below the boiling
point of 212 degrees at normal
pressure — was hoped for by
late morning today.
A site emergency, the sec
ond most serious in a four-level
classification system — and by
NRC definition a situation that
poses the potential of health
effects for the public had
gone into effect 75 minutes af
terthe9:2Ba.m. Mondayburst.
It was downgraded to an
alert, the third most serious

level, at 7:15 p.m. Monday, and
the alert was canceled at 11:15
a.m. yesterday.
"The industry is very con
cerned about it because it's an
operational problem," Strasma
said. There also is an in
dustrywide problem with pre
mature tube degradation.
There are 3260 steam tubes in
each of Ginna's two gener
ators, and they tend to become
corroded with caked up crud
and mineral deposits.
Other tube ruptures have
occurred at Point Beach in
northern Wisconsin on Feb. 26,
1975; Surry Point in Gravel
Neck, Va., in September of
1976; Prairie Island in Red
Wing, Minn., on Oct. 2, 1979;
and the Duke Power Co.'s
Oconee Unit in North Carolina
in September of 1981.
The biggest part of the Ginna
cleanup involved purification
of 11,000 gallons of radioactive
water in the containment
building.
"The bottom line is the plant
is stable. It's going to cold shut
down in an orderly manner.
There are no radiation releases
from the plant," said John
Oberlies, chief spokesman for
the utility, which serves one

million customers in the
Greater Rochester area.
By midday, the temperature
in the primary cooling system
was 325 degrees and falling.
Radiation monitoring away
from the plant, located 16 miles
northeast of Rochester, con
tinued to show only normal
background levels.
