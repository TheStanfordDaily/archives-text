## Sluggish ruggers whip winded Gaels 
### Jack Clark 
In a very physical, hard
fought game, the smaller,
faster Stanford Rugby first team
outlasted the St. Marv's Gaels
12-11 Saturday.on the Gaels'
home field in Moraga.
Due to the recent rains and a
previously played game, the
field was in poor condition as
the game started. The Cardinal
ruggers were sluggish and
lacked intensity while the
Gaels were fired up to avenge
an embarrassing 66-6 loss at the
hands of Stanford a year ago.
Stanford scored first, how
ever, on a 25-yard run by Ned
Fleming and, failing to convert
the kick-after, made the score
4-0. Soon after Stanford's
score, St. Mary's intercepted an
errant pass by the Cardinal out
side center and ran it in for a
try, leaving the game tied 4-4 at
halftime.
Spurred by its coach, Craig
Young, the Stanford side began
the second half with a notable
increase in intensity. The scrum
took control of the game as
hard nosed Tim Brehm and
other scrummers began jarring
the ball loose from Gael
players.
With the Stanford scrum in
control, scrum half Kurt Preis
ing passed the ball to Fleming

for the game's third score.
Then, on the best play of the
game, in which the ball was
passed by eight Cardinal
players, Rich Bridgeford
scored the try which gave Stan
ford a 12-4 lead and enough
points to fend off the Gael
comeback.
The Stanford second team
overcame a 9-7 halftime deficit
to round out a Cardinal after
noon and defeat the Gael sec
ond team 19-15. The second
team improved its record to 3-0
for the season. Stanford was led
by the sophomore scoring trio
of Morgan L. Morgan, Jeff
Scheel and Lou Rodriguez.
The Cardinal jumped out to a
4-0 lead on a beautifully ex
ecuted 25-yead play in which
Rodriguez touched the ball in
the endzone for the try. Jeff
Douglas of St. Mary's then
dodged two diving Stanford
players to put the Gaels in the
lead as the first half ended.
The second half was all Stan
ford's as the Cardinal scrum led
by Scott Lindvall and Al Revere
began taking control of the
match. Morgan's running and
Scheel's kicking were more
than the St. Mary's side could
handle as Stanford scored the
last try of the game for the vic
tory.
