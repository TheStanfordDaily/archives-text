# Duran-Benitez: Roberto's future on line in Vegas
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Las Vegas — Nothing really
changes, it's the same routine,
shadowboxing in the depths of
a corner where he has stalked
an imaginary opporient and is
putting him away with a flurry
of punches, whooping his fun
ny owl's cries. He's still happy
in his work, laughing and jok
ing with his cornermen as he
trains, keeping the light bag
going with his forehead, doing
his fancy jump-rope act to de
light and applause.
But it's not true; everything
is different. Once, not so long
ago, right up until the night of
Nov. 25, 1980, Roberto Duran
inspired respect bordering on
reverence. But on the posters
for this fight his name is listed
beneath that of Wilfred
Benitez, who holds the title
that falls into question Friday,
the WBC junior middleweight
championship.
Benitez visits camp
Benitez is the champion.
Benitez is younger. Benitez is a
slight betting favorite. Benitez
even has the gall to show up at
one of Duran's workouts, take
up a position in the aisle where
Duran will have to pass him,
and fix a regal glare upon him.
The publicists, sensing the
potential for a skirmish, are in
ecstasy. Duran sweeps by, in
the middle of his small army,
without even seeing Benitez.
Wilfred wastes his stare on the
entourage and is lost in its
wake. Duran, told later what
Benitez was about, laughs.
"He saw me, I didn't see
him," Duran says through his
interpreter, genuinely amused.
"What's he going to do to me?"
Duran has always been con
temptuous of opponents,
almost surprised that anyone

would dare oppose him. He
has- known fatigue and pain
and also a big tummy ache, but
never fear. Whatever he fears,
he has it buried so deep you
couldn't find it with micro
surgery. Maybe Leonard lo
cated it that night in New Or
leans. Or maybe it was nothing
but a stomach ache that led
Duran to quit. As Duran's man
ager, Ray Arcel, asks over and
over, who knows? Who will
ever really know?
Nobody, but then people
don't insist on knowing, they
form their own conclusions.
What Roberto Duran, the lion
of Panama, the perfect warrior,
is remembered for now is quit
ting.
Conceiving the inconceivable
Roberto Duran was the
fiercest fighter of his time and,
some suggested, pound for
pound the best, too. He was
74-1 before the evening of
Nov. 25, 1980, with 55
knockouts, two of them over
the only man who'd ever
beaten him. He'd been a cham
pion at two weights. It was in
conceivable that a fighter who
burned with his kind of fire
could ever disgrace himself in a
ring.
And then the inconceivable
was conceived. In the eighth
round of a fight he was losing,
Duran gave his most famous
speech — "No mas, no mas" —
and in an instant, all that pre
ceded it was gone, Duran's ti
tle, his legend, his good name,
vanished, departed, forgotten.
Did ever a man fall so com
pletely and suddenly from
grace? From where he is, is
there a comeback?
Arcel is back
"A tremendous tragedy, a
great tragedy," Arcel calls it."I

don't condemn him for it. But
it's a tremendous tragedy."
It was Arcel, kindly, sincere,
soft-spoken, 82-year-old Ray
Arcel, who stood up in New
Orleans, while the rest of the
Duran people were running
around yelling about stomach
cramps and bad water and the
inadequate menu at the Hyatt
Regency, and the Leonard
people were instructing the
writers not to use a word like
"quit" for a Duran, who used
that very word.
Arcel then retired. When
Duran came back last summer
against Nino Gonzalez and lat
er against Luigi Minchillo,
Arcel stayed retired, suggest
ing a continued skepticism. But
now Arcel is back, saying he
left only because of the im
mense strain and the sorrow.
He still sounds a little skeptical
in spots, but mostly he is de
voted.
An interview
Duran sitsedgilyon a folding
chair in his dressing room after
his workout, having agreed to
do an interview. He is wearing
a polo shirt, slacks and
sneakers.
This is part of the interview,
with Duran answering through
Henriquez:
Q: You have so many doub
ters now.
A: It doesn't bother me what
people think. That's their prob
lem, not my problem.

Q: Has your life changed
since the last Leonard fight?
A: Yes, I've been taking
things more seriously.
Q: Was losing to him hard to
live with.
A: Correcto.
Q: Was it because you lost or
the way you lost?
A: It's not a matter of how I
lost. I was sick. Leonard could
never have knocked me out.
My body didn't allow me to
continue. I know how I felt.
Nobody else knows how I felt.
Q: Was Leonard's clowning
making you angry?
Duran bounces six inches
out of his chair, not happily,
and talks rapidly to Henriquez.
"He says to ask about the
Benitez fight," Henriquez says.
"And if you want to ask about
Leonard, he says to ask why
Leonard won't fight him."
Q: Do you just want to fight,
or did you come back to fight
Leonard again?
A: That's the idea, to get to
Leonard.
Q: Are you concerned with
your place in boxing history?
A: I'm not dealing with that. I
don't think about what posi
tion, what place. One thing I
will say to you: I know where I
belong in the history of boxing.
Whatever they say about
throwing me out, putting me
back in, that's semantics. But I
knowwherel belong in the his
tory of boxing.

A few moments later, the in
terview ends. Duran offers his
hand and then talks to Hen
riquez. "He says he wants to
apologize for being so abrupt
with the questions about
Leonard," Henriquez says,
"but he's thinking about
Benitez."
Duran's last chance
But then Benitez is Duran's
last chance at attaining a stat
ure that would prevent
Leonard from avoiding him
forever, which is exactly what
Leonard has repeatedly prom
ised to do, in the name of box
ing's integrity.
Duran is nearly obsessed
with Leonard. Henriquez says
Duran is reconciled to the pos
sibility that Leonard will never
get back in a ring with him, but
meanwhile Duran tries to cut
the distance by taunting
Leonard publicly, calling him
chicken. Leonard has already
heard all that from Duran, at
closer quarters.
"Remember," Henriquez
says, "Duran is a multi
millionaire. He's not fighting
for money. He got $8 million
tax-free. He's not fighting for
money, he's fighting for
pride."
And if he loses to Benitez?
"I can't talk for him, but what
would be the reason to con
tinue?" Arcel says. "As just an
other fighter?

has- known fatigue and pain
and also a big tummy ache, but
never fear. Whatever he fears,
he has it buried so deep you
couldn't find it with micro
surgery. Maybe Leonard lo
cated it that night in New Or
leans. Or maybe it was nothing
but a stomach ache that led
Duran to quit. As Duran's man
ager, Ray Arcel, asks over and
over, who knows? Who will
ever really know?
Nobody, but then people
don't insist on knowing, they
form their own conclusions.
What Roberto Duran, the lion
of Panama, the perfect warrior,
is remembered for now is quit
ting.
Conceiving the inconceivable
Roberto Duran was the
fiercest fighter of his time and,
some suggested, pound for
pound the best, too. He was
74-1 before the evening of
Nov. 25, 1980, with 55
knockouts, two of them over
the only man who'd ever
beaten him. He'd been a cham
pion at two weights. It was in
conceivable that a fighter who
burned with his kind of fire
could ever disgrace himself in a
ring.
And then the inconceivable
was conceived. In the eighth
round of a fight he was losing,
Duran gave his most famous
speech — "No mas, no mas" —
and in an instant, all that pre
ceded it was gone, Duran's ti
tle, his legend, his good name,
vanished, departed, forgotten.
Did ever a man fall so com
pletely and suddenly from
grace? From where he is, is
there a comeback?
Arcel is back
"A tremendous tragedy, a
great tragedy," Arcel calls it."I

don't condemn him for it. But
it's a tremendous tragedy."
It was Arcel, kindly, sincere,
soft-spoken, 82-year-old Ray
Arcel, who stood up in New
Orleans, while the rest of the
Duran people were running
around yelling about stomach
cramps and bad water and the
inadequate menu at the Hyatt
Regency, and the Leonard
people were instructing the
writers not to use a word like
"quit" for a Duran, who used
that very word.
Arcel then retired. When
Duran came back last summer
against Nino Gonzalez and lat
er against Luigi Minchillo,
Arcel stayed retired, suggest
ing a continued skepticism. But
now Arcel is back, saying he
left only because of the im
mense strain and the sorrow.
He still sounds a little skeptical
in spots, but mostly he is de
voted.
An interview
Duran sitsedgilyon a folding
chair in his dressing room after
his workout, having agreed to
do an interview. He is wearing
a polo shirt, slacks and
sneakers.
This is part of the interview,
with Duran answering through
Henriquez:
Q: You have so many doub
ters now.
A: It doesn't bother me what
people think. That's their prob
lem, not my problem.

Q: Has your life changed
since the last Leonard fight?
A: Yes, I've been taking
things more seriously.
Q: Was losing to him hard to
live with.
A: Correcto.
Q: Was it because you lost or
the way you lost?
A: It's not a matter of how I
lost. I was sick. Leonard could
never have knocked me out.
My body didn't allow me to
continue. I know how I felt.
Nobody else knows how I felt.
Q: Was Leonard's clowning
making you angry?
Duran bounces six inches
out of his chair, not happily,
and talks rapidly to Henriquez.
"He says to ask about the
Benitez fight," Henriquez says.
"And if you want to ask about
Leonard, he says to ask why
Leonard won't fight him."
Q: Do you just want to fight,
or did you come back to fight
Leonard again?
A: That's the idea, to get to
Leonard.
Q: Are you concerned with
your place in boxing history?
A: I'm not dealing with that. I
don't think about what posi
tion, what place. One thing I
will say to you: I know where I
belong in the history of boxing.
Whatever they say about
throwing me out, putting me
back in, that's semantics. But I
knowwherel belong in the his
tory of boxing.

A few moments later, the in
terview ends. Duran offers his
hand and then talks to Hen
riquez. "He says he wants to
apologize for being so abrupt
with the questions about
Leonard," Henriquez says,
"but he's thinking about
Benitez."
Duran's last chance
But then Benitez is Duran's
last chance at attaining a stat
ure that would prevent
Leonard from avoiding him
forever, which is exactly what
Leonard has repeatedly prom
ised to do, in the name of box
ing's integrity.
Duran is nearly obsessed
with Leonard. Henriquez says
Duran is reconciled to the pos
sibility that Leonard will never
get back in a ring with him, but
meanwhile Duran tries to cut
the distance by taunting
Leonard publicly, calling him
chicken. Leonard has already
heard all that from Duran, at
closer quarters.
"Remember," Henriquez
says, "Duran is a multi
millionaire. He's not fighting
for money. He got $8 million
tax-free. He's not fighting for
money, he's fighting for
pride."
And if he loses to Benitez?
"I can't talk for him, but what
would be the reason to con
tinue?" Arcel says. "As just an
other fighter?
Las Vegas — Nothing really
changes, it's the same routine,
shadowboxing in the depths of
a corner where he has stalked
an imaginary opporient and is
putting him away with a flurry
of punches, whooping his fun
ny owl's cries. He's still happy
in his work, laughing and jok
ing with his cornermen as he
trains, keeping the light bag
going with his forehead, doing
his fancy jump-rope act to de
light and applause.
But it's not true; everything
is different. Once, not so long
ago, right up until the night of
Nov. 25, 1980, Roberto Duran
inspired respect bordering on
reverence. But on the posters
for this fight his name is listed
beneath that of Wilfred
Benitez, who holds the title
that falls into question Friday,
the WBC junior middleweight
championship.
Benitez visits camp
Benitez is the champion.
Benitez is younger. Benitez is a
slight betting favorite. Benitez
even has the gall to show up at
one of Duran's workouts, take
up a position in the aisle where
Duran will have to pass him,
and fix a regal glare upon him.
The publicists, sensing the
potential for a skirmish, are in
ecstasy. Duran sweeps by, in
the middle of his small army,
without even seeing Benitez.
Wilfred wastes his stare on the
entourage and is lost in its
wake. Duran, told later what
Benitez was about, laughs.
"He saw me, I didn't see
him," Duran says through his
interpreter, genuinely amused.
"What's he going to do to me?"
Duran has always been con
temptuous of opponents,
almost surprised that anyone

would dare oppose him. He
has- known fatigue and pain
and also a big tummy ache, but
never fear. Whatever he fears,
he has it buried so deep you

it's a tremendous tragedy."
It was Arcel, kindly, sincere,
soft-spoken, 82-year-old Ray
Arcel, who stood up in New
Orleans, while the rest of the
Duran people were running
around yelling about stomach
cramps and bad water and the
inadequate menu at the Hyatt
Regency, and the Leonard
people were instructing the
writers not to use a word like
"quit" for a Duran, who used
that very word.
Arcel then retired. When
Duran came back last summer
against Nino Gonzalez and lat
er against Luigi Minchillo,
Arcel stayed retired, suggest
ing a continued skepticism. But
now Arcel is back, saying he
left only because of the im
mense strain and the sorrow.
He still sounds a little skeptical
in spots, but mostly he is de
voted.
An interview
Duran sitsedgilyon a folding
chair in his dressing room after
his workout, having agreed to
do an interview. He is wearing
a polo shirt, slacks and
sneakers.
This is part of the interview,
with Duran answering through
Henriquez:
Q: You have so many doub
ters now.
A: It doesn't bother me what
people think. That's their prob
lem, not my problem.

Q: Has your life changed
since the last Leonard fight?
A: Yes, I've been taking
things more seriously.
Q: Was losing to him hard to
live with.
A: Correcto.
Q: Was it because you lost or
the way you lost?
A: It's not a matter of how I
lost. I was sick. Leonard could
never have knocked me out.
My body didn't allow me to
continue. I know how I felt.
Nobody else knows how I felt.
Q: Was Leonard's clowning
making you angry?
Duran bounces six inches
out of his chair, not happily,
and talks rapidly to Henriquez.
"He says to ask about the
Benitez fight," Henriquez says.
"And if you want to ask about
Leonard, he says to ask why
Leonard won't fight him."
Q: Do you just want to fight,
or did you come back to fight
Leonard again?
A: That's the idea, to get to
Leonard.
Q: Are you concerned with
your place in boxing history?
A: I'm not dealing with that. I
don't think about what posi
tion, what place. One thing I
will say to you: I know where I
belong in the history of boxing.
Whatever they say about
throwing me out, putting me
back in, that's semantics. But I
knowwherel belong in the his
tory of boxing.

A few moments later, the in
terview ends. Duran offers his
hand and then talks to Hen
riquez. "He says he wants to
apologize for being so abrupt
with the questions about
Leonard," Henriquez says,
"but he's thinking about
Benitez."
Duran's last chance
But then Benitez is Duran's
last chance at attaining a stat
ure that would prevent
Leonard from avoiding him
forever, which is exactly what
Leonard has repeatedly prom
ised to do, in the name of box
ing's integrity.
Duran is nearly obsessed
with Leonard. Henriquez says
Duran is reconciled to the pos
sibility that Leonard will never
get back in a ring with him, but
meanwhile Duran tries to cut
the distance by taunting
Leonard publicly, calling him
chicken. Leonard has already
heard all that from Duran, at
closer quarters.
"Remember," Henriquez
says, "Duran is a multi
millionaire. He's not fighting
for money. He got $8 million
tax-free. He's not fighting for
money, he's fighting for
pride."
And if he loses to Benitez?
"I can't talk for him, but what
would be the reason to con
tinue?" Arcel says. "As just an
other fighter?
