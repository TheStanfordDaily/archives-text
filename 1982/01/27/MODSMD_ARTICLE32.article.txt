## It's time for some joyous noise in SF 
### 
lust when you thought it was safe to read the sports
section again. . .Another story about the 49ers!
Let me hear you raise your voices on high, brothers and
sisters. Let me hearyou make joyful noise untoSan
Francisco!
Oh, praise be unto the glorious 49ers, the most-exalted
saviors of the City by the Bay. Praise be on high.
Let us give thanks for Bill Walsh, carrier of greatest
offensive wisdom. Let us give thanks for Joe Montana,
purveyor of all cool. Let us give thanks for Hacksaw
Reynolds and Ronnie Lott, both blessed with enough sense
to leave L.A. Amen, brothers and sisters.

A lot of people, I'm told, find all this 49er Fever business
ridiculous. But, you see, people who haven't lived here all
their lives don't realize what a great moment this really is.
And as such, many people don't understand all the hoopla
about winning a Super Bowl.
A friend of mine, a Dallas fan, complained that San
Francisco fans at the 'Stick were hostile towards him as he
watched his'Boys go down todefeat in the NFC playoff.
They called him names and they tugged at his clothing.
But can you blame them? Can you really blame them?? Of
course not. Those fans were hungry. They were whipped
into a frenzy by the hottest thing in town since sourdough
bread and they cametofaunt.
Remember, in both football and baseball San Francisco
has been victory-starved for far too long. (Editor's note: The
49ers and Giants teams of the early 70s saw plenty of
victories. But never mind, Finch is on a roll.)
It doesn't matter that nearby Oakland almost always fields
winners. It doesn't matterthatSan Francisco hasthenew
Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall. . .
San Franciscans needed the49ers. And if the fans wanted
to tug on some tacky Dallas (or Los Angeles, or Cincinnatti)
sweatshirts, that's fine with me. And it's fine with me if they
keep doing it.
Go ahead, San Francisco. Get ugly. Tug on any clothing
you want. Rip it to shreds and spit on it in the street. Hey, I'm
right behind you. Listen, I bought my Carl's Jr. 49er mug this
summer, just like you. / remember how it felt when the
pimply faced little punk behind the counter smirked and
asked if I didn't really want their Raiders mug.
It hurt, didn't it? Didn't you just want to take your Dr.
Pepper and pour it all over the slimy twerp? Didn't you just
want to take the little punk outside and "explain" why Bill
Walsh was going to turn the team around? You did, didn't
you?
Well, I certainly did. I was fed up to here with taking
garbage about the49ers and now I don't have toanymore.
"America's Team." Ha! Did you see if Dallas happened to
get a call from President Reagan this year? Noooo. Did
Randy White ever "win one for theGipper?" Uh-uh.
The 49ers are champions of the world! It's a dynasty!
They're unstoppable!! They're"Rocky." I WANT YOU,
APOLLO CREED!!! (Editor's note: See? I told you. This bad
boy is on a roll!)

I seem to have digressed a little here. Um, I originally
intended to talk about the keys to the 49ers'success this
year. Then I was going to add a little about what they should
keep in mind for the seasons to come. It looks, however, as
if I'm running out of room. Butthat's OK,you've probably
heard it all before anyway. . .
