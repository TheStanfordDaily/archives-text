Reagan won't raise taxes
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
surprise decision not to seek major tax in
creases, and totolerate record-high budget def
icits instead, runs the risk of inviting higher in
terest rates and aborting recovery from re
cession.
The existence of the risk has been raised not
only by Reagan's Democratic opponents but
also by respected Republican allies in the Sen
ate and by Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Paul Volcker.
In his State of the Union message, the presi
dent estimated that the deficit for the current
year 1982 will be "under $100 billion," with
smaller deficits in each of the succeeding years,
even without major additional taxes.
Experts in the Congressional Budget Office as
well as most private economists, however, be
lievethe deficits will rise in future years because
the tax cut of 1981 will reduce revenues far
more than spending is likely to be cut — even
under Reagan's austerity plan.
The divergence of the revenue and spending
trends, which were assumed by the Con
gressional Budget Office and by Volcker, means
that without drastic action to cut spending or
raise taxes, the budget never will be balanced
and deficits will keep climbing.
That is why Reagan's chief economic advisers
recommended that he propose a $15 billion tax
increase to cut the projected deficit from $90
billion to $75 billion.
Senate Republican leaders urged a $45 billion
tax increase over the next two fiscal years —
1983 and 1984 — to bring down the deficit even
further in hopes of reducing near-record in
terest rates and reviving the economy.
Haig, Gromyko meet
Geneva — Secretary of State Alexander Haig
concluded nearly eight hours of intense dis
cussions with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko last night and said martial law in Po
land had "cast a long and dark shadow" over
every aspect of their talks.
He said that Gromyko, while expressing the
view that the situation in Poland is a purely in
ternal matter, nonetheless took part with him in
a detailed "two-sided" discussion of the Polish
crisis.
At a news conference, Haig described the
talks as "very sober and extremely detailed,"
and said he told Gromyko the United States is
prepared to begin negotiations on the reduc
tion of strategic nuclear weapons"when condi
tions permit."
But he made clear that the Reagan adminis
tration believes such negotiations cannot take
place in an international atmosphere he said is
poisoned by events in Poland.
Haig told reportersthat Poland will not be the
only factor in deciding when the time is right to
begin the talks .
"\ am not giving you a litmus test of condi
tions but merely a broad statement of the in
fluence of the Polish situation on the current
environment," Haig said.
He said President Ronald Reagan is"anxious"
for the talks to begin because he genuinely
wants "meaningful reductions in strategic
armaments."
Haig said he and Gromyko did not discuss the
possibility of a summit meeting between Rea
gan and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev. Haig
and Gromyko did not agree to hold another
meeting, but Haig said such meetings could be
arranged on short notice.
He said he and the Soviet foreign minister dis

cussed the status of the talks in Geneva on re
ducing nuclear missiles in Europe, which Haig
called "the major source of nuclear tension
here in Europe."
Poles increase protests
Warsaw — A new protest letter from 27 in
tellectuals yesterday demanded Poland's
martial law authorities end "beating, maltreat
ment and harassment of people deprived of
their liberty."
The lettersurfaced after parliament approved
military rule and named a military historian to
run the universities.
The protest, signed by intellectuals, writers
and artists, said interned workers were getting
worse treatment than intellectuals and called
for publication of a full list of internees and the
sites where they are held.
(Informed sources estimate about 50,000
Polesare held underthe martial lawdecreethat
suspended the independent union Solidarity
Dec. 13 — more than 10 times the number the
Communist regime admits. Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa is believed held somewhere out
side Warsaw.)
(The International Committee of the Red
Cross in Geneva said Poland allowed it to visit
about 500 internees in two camps Friday and
Sunday in the first such operation in the Soviet
bloc. The Red Cross did not comment on the
conditions of the internees or the camps.)
Soviet leader dies
Moscow — Mikhail Suslov, the most influen
tial Kremlin figure after President Leonid
Brezhnev, died Monday after suffering a stroke,
the Soviet news agency Tass announced yester
day. He was 79.
The departure of Suslov, who was elected to
the top leadership while Stalin was still in
power, marks the end of an era. More than any
one else, he symbolized the continuity of Soviet
policy over the past three decades.
His death, which leaves a major gap in Soviet
leadership, is expected to have an impact on the
question of Kremlin succession, although it is
not expected to lead to any short-term changes
in Moscow's foreign and domestic policies.
Suslov, in length of continuous service, was
the senior member of the present leadership.
He had been a member of the Central Commit
tee since 1941 and one of its powerful national
secretaries since 1947. He was also the senior
member in the Politburo, having been admitted
in 1952, five years before Brezhnev.
As the guardian of communist orthodoxy, he
played a decisive role in all major shifts in the
Kremlin. He is believed by many to have engi
neered the downfall of Nikita Khrushchev in
1964 and to have proposed Brezhnev to replace
him.
Two missing in Boston crash
Boston — Two passengers from a World Air
ways DC-10 jet that slid off a runway into Boston
Harbor over the weekend are missing and
feared drowned, officials said yesterday, three
days after they said no one had been killed in
the accident.
Asked ifthe bodiesofthefatherandson were
believed to be in the harbor, Edward Ringo,
senior vice president of the airline, said, "It's
pretty obvious."
Divers immediately returned to the scene to
search for bodies.
It had been believed that all 196 passengers
and 12 crew members escaped serious injury

when the plane slid off the runway at Logan In
ternational Airport on Saturday night. Three
people remained hospitalized yesterday for mi
nor injuries.
But Ringo said a computer check of tickets
and the discovery of carry-on luggage showed
two passengers unaccounted for, and two rela
tives of the missing passengers told state police
at the airport they believed the men had been
on the plane.
"Everything matches that there are two peo
ple missing," he said.
Ringo identified the two as Walter Metcalf,
70, and his son, Leo, about 40, of the Boston sub
urb of Dedham.
AT&T promises quality
Washington — Local telephone service will
not deteriorate as the result of a settlement be
tween American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
and the Justice Department, AT&T chairman
Charles Brown told a House hearing yesterday.
In his second day of testimony before Con
gress on the impact of the antitrust settlement,
Brown rejected suggestions that under the con
sent decree, the 22 local telephone companies,
which AT&T has agreed to divest, will be unfair
ly restricted to businesses with a bleak earnings
potential.
Some critics contend that local companies
will wither and the nation's telephone network
decline if the agreement is not modified to al
low the Bell System companies to participate in
competitive growth businesses.
Said Brown, "There is no reason for (the com
panies to encounter) financial difficulty, .hey
have a wide market — almost a monopoly —
good management, and telephone service is
growing.
ACLU cites Ef Salvador abuses
Washington — The American Civil Liberties
Union, charging the government of El Salvador
with continuing repression, including responsi
bility for an estimated 12,501 murders during
1981, yesterday urged President Ronald Reagan
not to certify to Congress that the Salvadoran
regime is improving its human rights record.
The ACLU and another private organization,
the Americas Watch Committee, made publica
273-page report detailing charges of systematic
murder, torture, arbitrary arrests and denial of
rights by the U.S.-supported civilian-military
government headed by President jose
Napoleon Duarte.
State Department spokesman Alan Romberg
declined to comment on the report and said the
administration's position will be spelled out in
detail when the president sends the required
notification to Congress later this week.
