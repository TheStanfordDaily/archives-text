Staff lunch
Buckingham palace? The tomb of
the unknown soldier? No, but at the
staff lunch tomorrow at noon the
Daily will offer its own version of part
of its changing of the guard. There
will be important business, info on a
rather social week-end, and, above
all, a chance to listen to and question
the editorial board candidates.
Happy Hour
As part of the above-mentioned
social activities, there will be a happy
hour as the final issue of the volume
goes through production tomorrow
night. All staffers are invited to come
to reminisce (it was, after all, the best

of times, the worst of times), to plan
for another terrific volume, and,
before you are a bit dizzy (how about
that euphemism?), to proofread
copy. Don't count out the possibility
of caravan to Luv's for breakfast.
Edit Board
Today is the last day to submit dec
larations to run for one of three at
lafge positions on the editorial
board, whose members debate and
write Daily editorials. Anyone — Dai
ly staffer or not — can apply, and by
today you should submit your decla
rations and anything else you would
like posted. Candidate's presenta
tions and voting will be tomorrow.
