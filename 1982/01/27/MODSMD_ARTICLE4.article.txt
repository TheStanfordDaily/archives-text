### Kathy Olmsted 
Students who feel they do not ben
efit from groups supported by fee
assessments argued last night at an
ASSU Senate Rules Committee meet
ing against the institution of non-re
fundable fee assessments.
Approximately 10studentsshowed
up at the meeting to discuss possible
ASSU financial reforms, one of which
may be non-refundable assessments.
Under the present system, students
can demand the refund of their en
tire assessment, which amounted to
$20 for 20 individual groups this quar
ter.
Some graduate students said they

have different concerns from under
graduates and proposed that the fee
assessment ballot be split between
graduates and undergraduates.
However, Finance Committee
chairman Mark Epstein pointed out
that only about 400 grad students
voted in the last fee assessment elec
tion and that a split ballot would
probably mean the elimination of
graduate organzations. He said it
would also be difficult to determine
which organizations strictly bene
fitted grad students.
Although some grad students said
they did not benefit from student ac
tivities, others argued that they took

regular advantage of various student
organizations.
Another possible reform discussed
at the meeting was the exemption of
off-campus students, both graduate
and undergradate, from the payment
of assessments. However, senators
pointed out that many groups
funded by the assessments benefit
students who live both on and off
campus.
Epstein said he sensed a "general
hypocrisy" among 40 percent of the
student bodywhotook back their fee
assessments but continue to enjoy
the benefits of the various groups.
He said many of the groups sup

ported by the assessments had made
plans for speakers and other pro
grams servicing the entire student
body that were difficult to imple
ment because of the loss of fee
assessment funds. A student sug
gested that the groups deserved their
situation because they had "over
estimated their popularity."
Some students also opposed non
refundable assessments on the
grounds that it might lead to the
mandatory funding of political or
ganizations with which some stu
dents disagree.
Although senators said students
