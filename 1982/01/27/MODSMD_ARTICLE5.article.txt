# Med Center talk focuses on future of public health policy

If some conservative members of
Congress get their way, the federal
government will spend $30 million in
the next three years on the Adoles
cent Family Life Bill — also know as
the Teen Chastity Bill and the Cold
Shower Bill — to teach teenagers
"self-discipline and chastity" rather
than birth control.
Last year, federal funding for fami
ly planning services and population
research was cut 25 percent.
Those are two of the consequences
of the government's failure to de
velop a national health policy, ac
cording to Jane Zones, a consultant
to the California State Office of Fami
ly Planning. Zones spoke at the Med
ical School yesterday on the topic of
"Women and Health Policy in the
United States."
Instead of developing a "com
prehensive and internally consistent
system of policy," she said, the Unit
ed States hasa "fragmented, parochi

al, and incremental approach" to
health policy that is dominated by
various interest groups.
One of the strongest groups in
Washington is the block of "New
Right" congressmen who hold tradi
tional views on family issues, said
Zones. Most are against abortion and
against contraception. They support
legislation which — like the Adoles
cent Family Life Bill — "seeks to
shore up the idea of the nuclear fami
ly as it was portrayed on (television)
situation comedies in the 19505."
In the past year, conservative con
gressmen have introduced two pro
posals which would make it more dif
ficult for women to obtain abortions.
One is the Human Life Amend
ment, which has been considered in
a dozen different forms. It would out
law abortion except in cases where
the mother's life is endangered.
The second, the Human Life Bill,
seeks to "expand the term 'person'
.. . to include human life from the

moment of conception," said Zones.
It would allow abortion to be prose
cuted as murder. Zones said oppo
nentsof the bill fearit mayeven"out
law birth control that interferes with
conception."
According to Zones, statistics sug
gest that making abortion illegal does
not make it less widespread, just
more dangerous.
The United States Supreme Court
ruled in 1973 that states could not re
strict access to abortions performed
during the first two trimesters (the
first 24 weeks) of pregnancy. Zones
estimated that, before that ruling,
anywhere between several hundred
thousand and 1 million women had
illegal abortions each year.
Illegal abortions would become a
major problem in the United States if
strict abortion laws were passed, said
Zones. She said illegal abortions are
the "major cause of death among
women of child-bearing age" world
wide. According to Zones, 20 million
illegal abortions are performed
throughout the world each year, and
another 20 million are self-induced.
Neither the Human Life Amend
ment nor the Human Life Bill has yet
been passed. And so far, Congress
has not authorized the Family Life
Bill.
But Zones said she expects these
controversial family planning issues

to become more prominent in con
gressional debate.
Until now conservatives in Con
gress have "laid off" these issues,
upon President Ronald Reagan's re
quest, in order to push through his
economic policies, said Zones.
But since his budget has been
passed, Reagan is ready to give his
conservative supporters the signal to
go "full steam" on the family issues,
she calimed.
