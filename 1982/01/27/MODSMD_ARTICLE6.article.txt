# Reagan's 'new federalism' to transfer funds to states
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, vowing
not to retreat from his program of reducing taxes and
trimming the size of the federal government, called
on Congress yesterday to transfer to state and local
governments $47 billion in such federal programs as
food stamps and aid to dependent children.
Such grant programs have proliferated so rapidly
since 1960, he said, that neither Congress nor the pres
ident can properly oversee them.
"let us solve this problem with a single, bold stroke
— the return of some $47 billion in federal programs
to state and local government, together with the
means to finance them and a transition period of
nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption," he
said.
Reagan outlined his plan for what was billed as "a
major federalism initiative" before Congress and a
national television audience in his first State of the
Union speech. 112
He gave few details of the plan and White House of
ficials who briefed reporters on his address em
phasized that the administration has not yet worked
out details of the program nor how it will be carried
out.

They said it would require two months just to pre
pare legislation for the program. "I don't think any
body has designed the legislative process by which
this will be accomplished," one official said. Another
said, "There are a thousand little questions that have
to be ironed out."
The president's message dealt mostly with the
economy and other domestic concerns, with less than
a fifth of it devoted to foreign affairs. He said he would
deliver a major foreign policy address in the near
future. 1
Reagan, whose optimism of a year ago has been
tempered by the reality of a deepening recession and
rising unemployment, acknowledged that the econo
my faces ,some difficult times, but predicted better
days soon.
"The economy will face difficult moments in the
months ahead," he said. "But the program for eco-
that is in place will pull the economy
out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity
and stable growth by the latter half of this year."
Although some of his senior aides had urged him to
propose new tax measures to help bring down budget
deficits, Reagan argued that higher taxes would not
mean lower deficits.
Raising taxes, Reagan said, would
encourage more government spend
ing and less private investment. He
also said it would slow economic
growth, reduce production and in
crease unemployment.
"So I will not ask you to try to bal
ance the budget on the backs of the
American taxpayers," he said.
On foreign affairs, Reagan warned
that the United States "will act with
firmness" toward nations exporting
terrorism and subversion in the
Caribbean and elsewhere, "especial
, ly Cuba and Libya."
U.S sanctions against Poland and
the Soviet Union show that Washing
ton will not do "business as usual"
with oppressors, he said, and he
again promised to take "further
measures" if the Polish situation con
tinues to deteriorate.
"We have never needed walls,
mine fields and barbed wire to keep
our people in," he said. "Nor do we
declare martial law to prevent our
people from voting for the kind of

government they want."
In concluding his message, the
president quoted Abraham Lincoln,
"the greatest of all our presidents,"
who in a State of the Union message
120 years ago said: "We cannot es
cape history. We of this Congress and
this administration will be remem
bered in spite of ourselves. . .the trial
through which we pass will light us
down in honor or dishonor to the
latest generation."
"That president and that Con
gress," Reagan said, "did not fail the
American people. Together, they
weathered the storm and preserved
the Union.
"Let it be said of us that we, too, did
not fail; that we, too worked togeth
er to bring America through difficult
times. Let us so conduct ourselves
that two centuries from now, another
Congress and another president,
meeting in this Chamber as we are
meeting, will speak of us with pride,
saying that we met the test and pre
served for them in their day the sa
cred flame of liberty — this last, best
hope of man on Earth."

Washington — President Ronald Reagan, vowing
not to retreat from his program of reducing taxes and
trimming the size of the federal government, called
on Congress yesterday to transfer to state and local
governments $47 billion in such federal programs as
food stamps and aid to dependent children.
Such grant programs have proliferated so rapidly
since 1960, he said, that neither Congress nor the pres
ident can properly oversee them.
"let us solve this problem with a single, bold stroke
— the return of some $47 billion in federal programs
to state and local government, together with the
means to finance them and a transition period of
nearly 10 years to avoid unnecessary disruption," he
said.
Reagan outlined his plan for what was billed as "a
major federalism initiative" before Congress and a
national television audience in his first State of the
Union speech. 112
He gave few details of the plan and White House of
ficials who briefed reporters on his address em
phasized that the administration has not yet worked
out details of the program nor how it will be carried
out.

They said it would require two months just to pre
pare legislation for the program. "I don't think any
body has designed the legislative process by which
this will be accomplished," one official said. Another
said, "There are a thousand little questions that have
to be ironed out."
The president's message dealt mostly with the
economy and other domestic concerns, with less than
a fifth of it devoted to foreign affairs. He said he would
deliver a major foreign policy address in the near
future. 1
Reagan, whose optimism of a year ago has been
tempered by the reality of a deepening recession and
rising unemployment, acknowledged that the econo
my faces ,some difficult times, but predicted better
days soon.
"The economy will face difficult moments in the
months ahead," he said. "But the program for eco-
that is in place will pull the economy
out of its slump and put us on the road to prosperity
and stable growth by the latter half of this year."
Although some of his senior aides had urged him to
propose new tax measures to help bring down budget
deficits, Reagan argued that higher taxes would not
mean lower deficits.
Raising taxes, Reagan said, would
encourage more government spend
ing and less private investment. He
also said it would slow economic
growth, reduce production and in
crease unemployment.
"So I will not ask you to try to bal
ance the budget on the backs of the
American taxpayers," he said.
On foreign affairs, Reagan warned
that the United States "will act with
firmness" toward nations exporting
terrorism and subversion in the
Caribbean and elsewhere, "especial
, ly Cuba and Libya."
U.S sanctions against Poland and
the Soviet Union show that Washing
ton will not do "business as usual"
with oppressors, he said, and he
again promised to take "further
measures" if the Polish situation con
tinues to deteriorate.
"We have never needed walls,
mine fields and barbed wire to keep
our people in," he said. "Nor do we
declare martial law to prevent our
people from voting for the kind of

government they want."
In concluding his message, the
president quoted Abraham Lincoln,
"the greatest of all our presidents,"
who in a State of the Union message
120 years ago said: "We cannot es
cape history. We of this Congress and
this administration will be remem
bered in spite of ourselves. . .the trial
through which we pass will light us
down in honor or dishonor to the
latest generation."
"That president and that Con
gress," Reagan said, "did not fail the
American people. Together, they
weathered the storm and preserved
the Union.
"Let it be said of us that we, too, did
not fail; that we, too worked togeth
er to bring America through difficult
times. Let us so conduct ourselves
that two centuries from now, another
Congress and another president,
meeting in this Chamber as we are
meeting, will speak of us with pride,
saying that we met the test and pre
served for them in their day the sa
cred flame of liberty — this last, best
hope of man on Earth."
