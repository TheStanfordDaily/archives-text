## Saturn research continues 
### Kristen Christopher 
University researchers have
made great progress in de
termining the complex struc
ture of the rings of Saturn by
analyzing data sent back to
earth from Voyager 2.
Prof. Von Eshleman of the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment here said their research
team's most significant finding
was that the edges of the rings
are "a lot sharper than a razor
blade". Essam Marouf, a re
search associate, said that since
the edges are actually close to
1500 feet thick, this meas
urement is ' really just an
analogy — the razor blade
would have to be half the size
of a football field.
The data that provided the
measurements was received
through radio waves from Voy
ager 2 aimed at the rings in the
direction of Earth, according to
Marouf.
"It (the process) is like the
phenomenon known for peo
ple on Earth in which a light
source is aimed at an opaque
sheet of paper," Marouf said.
In this situation, the light is
completely blocked, whereas
some light leaks through if
aimed at a dark sheet, or gets
defracted if aimed at an edge.
By studying the radio waves
which reached Earthafterstrik
ing the rings, the researchers,
according to Marouf, were

able to determine not only the
sharpness of the edge, but also
the more complex structure of
the rings.
The researchers found that
the C ring, which is closest to
the planet, has a homogeneous
distribution of materials, but
also has certain regions on the
edges where particles are piled
up. These piles, called "con-

Asked if he thinks that the Voyager
program is in jeopardy due to President
Ronald Reagan's budget cuts, Eshleman
said, '/ don't think it will be cut, because
that would be non-sensical/ The
program may be hurt because less
money may be spent on it, but, he said,
'Stupidity is not so high that it will be
ended/

densations", according to
Marouf, are made of very
dense materials which try to
stick together, and occur at
regular intervals along the ring.
The data also showed that
the A ring, the farthest from the
planet, does not have con
densations, but does have gaps
where no material is present.
The B ring, according to
Marouf, is more opaque and
therefore, its exact structure is
more difficult to determine.

"We now have the pieces of
the puzzle," he said, "and so
we are toying with a theory to
see how to explain these
things."
According to Eshleman, a
very important question is
whether the structure of the
rings is static or changing.
"These things could last as long
as the solar system — for

billions of years — or could be
changing continually," he said.
"To determine this, however,
we need a spacecraft that stays
up there for a while."
Voyager 2 is presently mov
ing to Uranus, but Eshleman
said it will not get there until
1986. Uranus will be studied in
the same way that Saturn was,
"in order to help us to get a
basic understanding of the so
lar system," he said. "How we
will exactly use this informa

tion is more difficult, but
hopefully it will lead to more
general principles which will
help us to more thoroughly un
derstand Earth."
According to Eshleman, stu
dying what he calls "other
worlds" will provide informa
tion about how our at
mosphere is changing and may
indicate future problems. For
example, Eshleman is currently
studying acid rain on Venus to
help understand this
phenomenon on Earth.
When asked if he thinks that
the Voyager program is in
jeopardy due to President
Ronald Reagan's budget cuts,
Eshleman said, "I don't think it
will be cut, because that would
be non-sensical. We've already
spent too much money on it —
over a billion dollars." He also
said that even if the U.S.
stopped "listening" to the
spacecraft, "other countries,
like Russia or China, would try
to listen in on it." The program
may be hurt because less mon
ey may be spent on it, accord
ing to Eshleman, but he said,
"Stupidity is not so high that it
will be ended."

Surfers beware!

In the wake of the recent shark attack off the California coast, many surfers are ap
prehensive of the ominous, finned creatures. Shown below is the great white shark,
Known for its size and killing potential. Not all sharks, however, are as fearsome.
Shown above is a whale shark, as long as a city bus, yet a harmless plankton feeder.

densations, but does have gaps
where no material is present.
The B ring, according to
Marouf, is more opaque and
therefore, its exact structure is
more difficult to determine.

"We now have the pieces of
the puzzle," he said, "and so
we are toying with a theory to
see how to explain these
things."
According to Eshleman, a
very important question is
whether the structure of the
rings is static or changing.
"These things could last as long
as the solar system — for

billions of years — or could be
changing continually," he said.
"To determine this, however,
we need a spacecraft that stays
up there for a while."
Voyager 2 is presently mov
ing to Uranus, but Eshleman
said it will not get there until
1986. Uranus will be studied in
the same way that Saturn was,
"in order to help us to get a
basic understanding of the so
lar system," he said. "How we
will exactly use this informa

tion is more difficult, but
hopefully it will lead to more
general principles which will
help us to more thoroughly un
derstand Earth."
According to Eshleman, stu
dying what he calls "other
worlds" will provide informa
tion about how our at
mosphere is changing and may
indicate future problems. For
example, Eshleman is currently
studying acid rain on Venus to
help understand this
phenomenon on Earth.
When asked if he thinks that
the Voyager program is in
jeopardy due to President
Ronald Reagan's budget cuts,
Eshleman said, "I don't think it
will be cut, because that would
be non-sensical. We've already
spent too much money on it —
over a billion dollars." He also
said that even if the U.S.
stopped "listening" to the
spacecraft, "other countries,
like Russia or China, would try
to listen in on it." The program
may be hurt because less mon
ey may be spent on it, accord
ing to Eshleman, but he said,
"Stupidity is not so high that it
will be ended."

Surfers beware!

In the wake of the recent shark attack off the California coast, many surfers are ap
prehensive of the ominous, finned creatures. Shown below is the great white shark,
Known for its size and killing potential. Not all sharks, however, are as fearsome.
Shown above is a whale shark, as long as a city bus, yet a harmless plankton feeder.

University researchers have
made great progress in de
termining the complex struc
ture of the rings of Saturn by
analyzing data sent back to
earth from Voyager 2.
Prof. Von Eshleman of the
Electrical Engineering Depart
ment here said their research
team's most significant finding
was that the edges of the rings
are "a lot sharper than a razor
blade". Essam Marouf, a re
search associate, said that since
the edges are actually close to
1500 feet thick, this meas
urement is ' really just an
analogy — the razor blade
would have to be half the size
of a football field.
The data that provided the
measurements was received
through radio waves from Voy
ager 2 aimed at the rings in the
direction of Earth, according to
Marouf.
"It (the process) is like the
phenomenon known for peo
ple on Earth in which a light
source is aimed at an opaque
sheet of paper," Marouf said.
In this situation, the light is
completely blocked, whereas
some light leaks through if
aimed at a dark sheet, or gets
defracted if aimed at an edge.
By studying the radio waves
which reached Earthafterstrik
ing the rings, the researchers,
according to Marouf, were

able to determine not only the
sharpness of the edge, but also
the more complex structure of
the rings.
The researchers found that
the C ring, which is closest to
the planet, has a homogeneous
distribution of materials, but
also has certain regions on the
edges where particles are piled
up. These piles, called "con-

Marouf, are made of very
dense materials which try to
stick together, and occur at
regular intervals along the ring.
The data also showed that
the A ring, the farthest from the
planet, does not have con
densations, but does have gaps
where no material is present.
