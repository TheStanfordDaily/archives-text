# Doctors say life can be made better but not much longer

Our society's concepts of disease and ag
ing will have to undergo significant changes
in the next few years, according to two re
searchers at Stanford University Medical
Center.
Dr. James Fries and Dr. Lawrence Crapo
have marshalled both biomedical and de
mographic data to support their hypothesis
that the elimination of many chronic dis
eases will produce a population with greater
health and vitality into their 70s and 80s, al
though a natural "aging barrier" will be fatal
to most by age 90. Their view rejects the fear
that an increasing average lifespan could
lead to a much greater proportion of ex
tremely old people.
These findings, recently published as Vital
ity and Aging and presented by Fries, assoc.
prof, of medicine, to the American Associa
tion for the advancement of Science, have

attracted considerable media attention, in
cluding interviews on ABC's Good Morning,
America.
Fries and Crapo's arguments for a fixed
maximum lifespan range from studies of lab
oratory tissue cultures, which show a finite
number of cell divisions, to sociological and
anthropological studies showing claims of
super-centenarian populations to be hoax
es. In a recent interview, Crapo, who is
clinical director of the Geriatric Research
Center of the Palo Alto Veterans Medical
Centerand assistant professor of medicine at
Stanford, stressed the results of such
biological limits for a society increaingly able
to control many chronic illnesses.
"A host of people are moving into the
older age groups," Crapo said, "with the re
sult that we will be medically forced to con
front what natural aging is. For example, dur
ing an influenza epidemic, the mortality rate

among the elderly may rise. Should the
cause of death be viewed as a specific dis
ease, influenza, or as the nearly universal
frailty of the older individuals?"
According to Crapo, there are three major
classes of illness. The acute illnesses, such as
smallpox and tuberculosis, which were once
major causes of death, have now been vir
tually eliminated from many parts of the
world. Second, the major killers today,
chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis and
cancer, are becoming better understood
and more controllable. Death from these
chronic diseases can be considered pre
mature,since most of the body is still intact.
The third class is the universal illnesses,
which from steady and perhaps in
evitable decline in overall organ function
with advancing age. Fries and Crapo believe
that we may be beginning a transition period
during which universal illnesses will steadily

replace chronic illnesses as the leading cause
of death.
Most important is a growing body of evi
dence showing the role of personal lifestyle
choices in the development of athe
rosclerosis, lung cancer, and other chronic
illnesses, according to their book. For exam
ple, smoking, obesity and excess drinking
may lead not only to premature mortality,
but to many years of illness before death. V/-
tality and Aging states that, "the leading
lethal diseases of the past have been effec
tively combatted and are now being re
placed by universal, chronic conditions
which are not easily treated. Yet, much of the
current health care system is focused on the
diagnosis and treatment of these chronic dis
eases at the symptomatic stage, too late to ef
fect outcomes decisively."
In a Daily interview, Crapo stressed the

need for continued research into the
biological bases of chronic disease, along
with better understanding of the social ef
fects of compression of morbidity. He said
there is a strong relationship between re
search on chronic disease at a biological
level and social aspects of medicine. For ex
ample, increased biological knowledge of
disease processes may allow better
assessment of what personal lifestyle choices
are most influential in maintaining health.
He also emphasized the increasing need for
research into the little-understood
biological mechanisms of aging itself.
In order to promote such study, the Na
tional Institute of Aging was established in
1974. In addition, the Veterans Adminis
tration has established 12 geriatric research
centers across the nation, including a center
in Palo Alto.
