Here they are! — The people you've seen and heard about around campus but
have yet to formally meet. The Daily is using this page to introduce six members
of the community who provide various services for the campus... Next time you
encounter these people, greet them with a friendly 'Hi'.

Ever want to go to Italy? You may not have
to go as far as you think. Maria and Thomas
Dallas (the husband/wife team who sell fruit
in White Plaza) have brought the flavor of
"Roma" right here to Stanford.
According to both Maria and Tom, White
Plaza is actually reminiscent of their home in
Italy. Referring to the noontime tangle of bi
cycles and pedestrians, Maria said in a thick
accent, "This is like the square below my
window in Roma. There are the vendors, the
music, the people. I used to sit by the win
dow and watch the people pass by because it
was all so beautiful. Now, this is my win
dow."
Maria came to the United States with her
sister in 1932 in order to establish a dressmak

ing business in Boston.
Maria was 30 years old at this time, unmar
ried, and somewhat distressed because she
had left a boyfriend behind in Rome. She
met Tom on the boat coming over — he was
an Italian soldier returning to the United
States to assume his old job as a chef in an
Italian restaurant in Boston — and three
years later, the couple was married.
They lived comfortably in Boston, but after
four chilling Eastern winters their warm Ital
ian blood needed to thaw in a warmer
climate, and they moved to San Lorenzo,
California, in 1949.
Eleven years ago the Dallas' opened their
fruit stand in White Plaza.
"Originally we had two stands. Tom ran
the stand by Tresidder and I ran the stand

here by the Bookstore. Thisstand here made
more business. I told Tom it was a more
dignified place to sell the apples. The next
day he moved/' she said.
One of Maria's first concerns when they
opened business was that she wanted to feel
at home. Their trademark, the radio, pro
vided the solution. "Everything was here:
the trees, the sky, the people. I wanted it to
be like Roma so the first think I put was the
radio. Not just any music, but classical mu
sic," said Maria.
"I like to do anything creative. My mind is
a part of me. That is why I like beautiful
things to be a part of me. I like beautiful mu
sic, beautiful art and beautiful books. I read
literature three or four hours a day just for its
sheer beauty," she said.
Maria admires Stanford students for the
desire to learn. "Stanford students have a de
sire to live with their minds. They are in
telligent and many of them have brilliant im
aginations. When I have free time I go to the
Church and read what Mrs. Stanford has
written about serenity, love and beauty. She
had a wonderful imagination. And what she
wanted to create I see here in the students I
talk to," she said.
"I love Stanford students, although I am
very sad every (few) years when some of
them leave. Sometimes I get cards from
them. They tell me about what they are
doing, how many kids they have, and where
they are living. They remember me as part of
Stanford, and some have even called me
mother, which I take asa greatcompliment."
