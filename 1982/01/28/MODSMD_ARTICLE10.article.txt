## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — Calling the mood in the U.S.
Congress "dangerous," Shintaro Abe,
minister of international trade and in
dustry, has declared that Japan must take
strong action in the next two to three'
months to remove import barriers to fore
stall American protectionism.
Abe said that the government would an
nounce actions next Saturday to lift some
"67 or 68" non-tariff trade barriers that
had been cited by the United States and
Europe. But he indicated that no action
was being planned to remove any of
Japan's 27 remaining import quotas, 22 of
which limit imports of agricultural goods,
such as beef and citrus fruits.

Fresh from a seven-day trip to the Unit
ed States, Abe told a meeting of the Japan
National Press Club that with 10 million
unemployed and an "unprecedented re
cession" in the American auto industry, "a
feeling of helplessness" prevails in the
United States.
"The next two to three months is the
time for decision. If great action is not
taken by then (by Japan), I fear that the
free trade system which has been built up
until now may be upturned by the roots,"
he said.
Abe said Japan would dispatch special
envoys to both the United States and Eu
rope to explain the measures it will an
nounce Saturday lifting about two-thirds

of non-tariff trade barriers cited by Japan's
trading partners, as well as measures an
nounced last month. The December
measures, including a two-year speed-up
in planned tariff reductions on some 1600
import items, had so far been largely ig
nored by Congress, he complained.
He said new measures would also in
clude a lifting of present requirements for
separate Japanese testing of many U.S.
goods which had already passed safety
tests in the United States.
Asked about Japan's plans for its second
year of restraints on passenger car exports
to the United States, Abe said exports wi
depend on the success of U.S. car sales in
1982.
