## Stuffed cats and electronic dogs: novelty items capture the unusual 
### Susanne Lee 
Would you like an electronic dog that
walks in circles and barks, or a penguin on
a stick that waddles when you push it?
What about a pile of magnets or a book
about preppies? If any of these items
sounds appealing, then you are not alone.
Novelty gifts such as these were some of
the hottest-selling items this season.
Novelty items cross all age, cultural, so
cial and economic boundaries. The same
gift can be perfect for a grandfather yet
suit his grandson as well. Often the right
idea for the person who has everything is
equally great (especially these days) for
the person who has nothing but still
needs a good laugh.
Cute isa major characteristic of a whole
range of popular novelty items this year.
"People are into cute for some reason —
it just has mass appeal," said Gary Haney,
buyer for Thinker Toys in the Stanford
Shopping Center. This was his only at
tempt to explain the overwhelming de
mand for cute items like stuffed animals.
"Most of the stores around here just
sold out of stuffed animals, even the week
before Christmas many of the stores had
none left," agreed David Schump, assis
tant manager of The Company, an adult
novelty gift shop in the shopping center.
Garfield, that silly-looking fat orange
cat made famous by the Garfield comic
strip, was "by far the most popular of the
new stuffed animals," said Schump. "Gar
fields are so successful that Dakin, the
manufacturer, now rations out the
amount that it will supply to any one
store. It doesn't matter if you order 10 or
300; they still might only send you five."
When you are able to find Garfield you
will see why he has been so much in de
mand. Dakin has really captured the typi
cal Garfield personality in their creation,
which comes in four sizes from $5.95 to
$18.95. Also available are the Garfield
mugs, posters, t-shirts and many other
items.
As for a traditional favorite, "Anything
and everything that had to do with teddy
bears was sold out this year," said Cyndy
Peterson, supervisor at The Company.

Teddy bears of all shapes and sizes are
definitely a rage. People will pay any
where from $10 for standard bears to $500
for anniversary bears, which leads one to
believe that not only their cuteness but
also their value as collectibles has led to
this increased demand.
"Many adults today really get into col
lecting teddy bears. I bought one last year
for $450 and it will be worth $700 next
year," said Haney. " People basically just
like teddy bears because they've grown

up with them. This year we've by far sold
more bears than anything else."
"Danny" and "Mr. Waddles" were two
more of the line of cute novelty items.
"Danny" is an approximately nine
inch-high battery-operated little brown
dog. His main charm lies in his ability to
walk in circles, wag his tail and bark.
Even his retailers can't explain Danny's
huge appeal, selling more than 200 of the
dogs which go for $20 each.
"It's not even that his attraction is lim
ited to young children. Many grownups
will come in and say 'How cute this would
be for Johnny.' Nine out of 10 times you
know that little Johnny never even sees
his new toy because his parents are so
busy with it," laughed Haney.

" 'Mr. Waddles' met a similar fate in
that he was originally conceived as a toy
to appeal to youngsters, but when they
tried to sell him in toy stores kids wouldn't
buy him," explained Schump.
On the other hand, The Company has
ordered 12 dozen of these penguins on a
stick which waddle when pushed. They
cannot keep any in stock. These waddling
penguins sell for $6.50.
By far the biggest seller this season, in
fact, responsible for the entire increase in
business of one store, Games 'n Things, is
Rubik's Cube and other cubic puzzles.
This apparently innocuous-looking
cube has tantalized cubers for hours or
days on end trying to succeed in turning
the cube in such a way as to get all pieces
of the same color on each side. It was ori
ginally developed by a Hungarian pro
fessor as an exercise in three-dimensional
visualization.
Now original Rubik's cubes are no
longer imported, but a whole variety of
Rubik-type cubes, key chains, spheres,
pyramids, snakes, and missing links are
now available for from $1.99 to $8.
This cube been so successful that
Games 'n Things has sold approximately
10,000 to 12,000 cube or cube-like pieces.
Todd Hunt, manager and buyer for
Games 'n Things, said that if he knew the
key to the cubes' success he would be a
very rich man. He said all he could assume
was, "This is a highly technical society and
people find that, though they need to re
lax, their mind still needs stimulation of
the sort not provided by TV. The cube is a
well-thought-out game. It doesn't come
apart so there is nothing to put back to
gether — you merely fool with it."
As for who buys these games, Hunt
said, "All types of people buy cubes and
its almost an even break between gift
buyers and cubers. Almost everyone likes
the cubes and enjoys the challenge, but it
is true that the largest group of cubers is
the 14 to 21-year-olds. It's just that in this
age group they tend to be more dedi
cated to the challenge of a new game."

But with the inevitable emergence of
such books as Simple Solutions to Cubic
Puzzles and The Simple Solution to
Rubik's Cube both by Stanford chemist
James Nourse, one may wonder what
challenge still remains.
Hunt said the next challenge is speed,
using the example of one of his employ-

ees, who owns 20 cubes. "Although the
official record is 26 seconds, he has solved
the cube unofficially in 22 seconds."
"Public Assistant" is another novelty
game which is reexperiencing popu
larity." The board game is produced by
Hammerhead Industries whose watch
word is "Why work for a living?" said
Hunt.
"This game actually teaches you how to

survive totally off the welfare system.
Some people tried to prevent its manu
facturing, which only created controversy
causing its initial popularity," he said.
In order to win the game you must ma
neuver yourself around the board in such
a manner that you avoid having to work.
Whoever most successfully milks the wel-

fare system wins.
A recent Wall Street Journal article on
the game revived its popularity.
What novelty game list would be com
plete without the Stanford game?
"The game featuring a board map of
the campus is mainly popular with Stan
ford alumni and student body, but we sell
it to other people because buyers are
always looking for something new."


Even teddy bears are in on the
Rubik's cube craze!


Garfield, a favorite cartoon character, is now a huggable
stuffed animal.

know that little Johnny never even sees
his new toy because his parents are so
busy with it," laughed Haney.

" 'Mr. Waddles' met a similar fate in
that he was originally conceived as a toy
to appeal to youngsters, but when they
tried to sell him in toy stores kids wouldn't
buy him," explained Schump.
On the other hand, The Company has
ordered 12 dozen of these penguins on a
stick which waddle when pushed. They
cannot keep any in stock. These waddling
penguins sell for $6.50.
By far the biggest seller this season, in
fact, responsible for the entire increase in
business of one store, Games 'n Things, is
Rubik's Cube and other cubic puzzles.
This apparently innocuous-looking
cube has tantalized cubers for hours or
days on end trying to succeed in turning
the cube in such a way as to get all pieces
of the same color on each side. It was ori
ginally developed by a Hungarian pro
fessor as an exercise in three-dimensional
visualization.
Now original Rubik's cubes are no
longer imported, but a whole variety of
Rubik-type cubes, key chains, spheres,
pyramids, snakes, and missing links are
now available for from $1.99 to $8.
This cube been so successful that
Games 'n Things has sold approximately
10,000 to 12,000 cube or cube-like pieces.
Todd Hunt, manager and buyer for
Games 'n Things, said that if he knew the
key to the cubes' success he would be a
very rich man. He said all he could assume
was, "This is a highly technical society and
people find that, though they need to re
lax, their mind still needs stimulation of
the sort not provided by TV. The cube is a
well-thought-out game. It doesn't come
apart so there is nothing to put back to
gether — you merely fool with it."
As for who buys these games, Hunt
said, "All types of people buy cubes and
its almost an even break between gift
buyers and cubers. Almost everyone likes
the cubes and enjoys the challenge, but it
is true that the largest group of cubers is
the 14 to 21-year-olds. It's just that in this
age group they tend to be more dedi
cated to the challenge of a new game."

But with the inevitable emergence of
such books as Simple Solutions to Cubic
Puzzles and The Simple Solution to
Rubik's Cube both by Stanford chemist
James Nourse, one may wonder what
challenge still remains.
Hunt said the next challenge is speed,
using the example of one of his employ-

ees, who owns 20 cubes. "Although the
official record is 26 seconds, he has solved
the cube unofficially in 22 seconds."
"Public Assistant" is another novelty
game which is reexperiencing popu
larity." The board game is produced by
Hammerhead Industries whose watch
word is "Why work for a living?" said
Hunt.
"This game actually teaches you how to

survive totally off the welfare system.
Some people tried to prevent its manu
facturing, which only created controversy
causing its initial popularity," he said.
In order to win the game you must ma
neuver yourself around the board in such
a manner that you avoid having to work.
Whoever most successfully milks the wel-

fare system wins.
A recent Wall Street Journal article on
the game revived its popularity.
What novelty game list would be com
plete without the Stanford game?
"The game featuring a board map of
the campus is mainly popular with Stan
ford alumni and student body, but we sell
it to other people because buyers are
always looking for something new."


Even teddy bears are in on the
Rubik's cube craze!


Garfield, a favorite cartoon character, is now a huggable
stuffed animal.
Would you like an electronic dog that
walks in circles and barks, or a penguin on
a stick that waddles when you push it?
What about a pile of magnets or a book
about preppies? If any of these items
sounds appealing, then you are not alone.
Novelty gifts such as these were some of
the hottest-selling items this season.
Novelty items cross all age, cultural, so
cial and economic boundaries. The same
gift can be perfect for a grandfather yet
suit his grandson as well. Often the right
idea for the person who has everything is
equally great (especially these days) for
the person who has nothing but still
needs a good laugh.
Cute isa major characteristic of a whole
range of popular novelty items this year.
"People are into cute for some reason —
it just has mass appeal," said Gary Haney,
buyer for Thinker Toys in the Stanford
Shopping Center. This was his only at
tempt to explain the overwhelming de
mand for cute items like stuffed animals.
"Most of the stores around here just
sold out of stuffed animals, even the week
before Christmas many of the stores had
none left," agreed David Schump, assis
tant manager of The Company, an adult
novelty gift shop in the shopping center.
Garfield, that silly-looking fat orange
cat made famous by the Garfield comic
strip, was "by far the most popular of the
new stuffed animals," said Schump. "Gar
fields are so successful that Dakin, the
manufacturer, now rations out the
amount that it will supply to any one
store. It doesn't matter if you order 10 or
300; they still might only send you five."
When you are able to find Garfield you
will see why he has been so much in de
mand. Dakin has really captured the typi
cal Garfield personality in their creation,
which comes in four sizes from $5.95 to
$18.95. Also available are the Garfield
mugs, posters, t-shirts and many other
items.
As for a traditional favorite, "Anything
and everything that had to do with teddy
bears was sold out this year," said Cyndy
Peterson, supervisor at The Company.

Teddy bears of all shapes and sizes are
definitely a rage. People will pay any
where from $10 for standard bears to $500
for anniversary bears, which leads one to
believe that not only their cuteness but
also their value as collectibles has led to
this increased demand.
"Many adults today really get into col
lecting teddy bears. I bought one last year
for $450 and it will be worth $700 next
year," said Haney. " People basically just
like teddy bears because they've grown

up with them. This year we've by far sold
more bears than anything else."
"Danny" and "Mr. Waddles" were two
more of the line of cute novelty items.
"Danny" is an approximately nine
inch-high battery-operated little brown
dog. His main charm lies in his ability to
walk in circles, wag his tail and bark.
Even his retailers can't explain Danny's
huge appeal, selling more than 200 of the
dogs which go for $20 each.
"It's not even that his attraction is lim
ited to young children. Many grownups
will come in and say 'How cute this would
be for Johnny.' Nine out of 10 times you
know that little Johnny never even sees
his new toy because his parents are so
busy with it," laughed Haney.
