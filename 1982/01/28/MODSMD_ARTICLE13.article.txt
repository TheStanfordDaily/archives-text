## Editorial Details: assault antidote 
### 
In researching a recent Daily editorial
regarding police investigations of sexual
assaults, we spoke to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington aboutthe problems
involved in collecting evidence and testimony
from victims. Obviously, the information which
a rape orassault victim givestothe police
immediately following the incident is critical to
the investigation. Herrington pointedout that
often, because the victim fears retribution or
publicity, he must make "deals" with rape
victims in order to obtain any information at all.
While the police can use the information to
track down leads, the press and in turn the
community is sometimes not alerted to details
about the attack which may help potential
victims protect themselves. Important details
like the precise location, the modus operandi
and how the attacker approached the victim are
denied these potential victims and others
concerned with campus and community safety
on the grounds that the police have promised to
release only the sketchiest details.
Some victims may insist on these promises
because they fear that their names will be
published in the Daily orother newspapers. This
fear is ungrounded: like that of most other
responsible newspapers, the policy of the Daily
is to withhold the name of a rape victim unless
she specifically releases her name and
authorizes publication.
We are concerned that women might fear that
information regarding the crime — likp
location, time, etc. - might be used bv the Daily

to try to identify the victim. This is not the case.
Such details are important to others who might
otherwise find themselves in potentially
dangerous situations.
For example, afterone of this year's rapes we
reported that the victim had been attacked
while riding a bicycle. For years the police have
been saying that women riding bicycles are just
as vulnerable as women on foot. Many of us
were unpersuaded before we read about this
attack in the press. The victim's cooperation
made this warningcredible.
Two women who were sexually assaulted this
fall have released, through an interview with
University News Service writer Karen
Bartholomew, considerable details regarding
their experiences. This article — which
appeared in yesterday's edition of Campus
Report and will be reprinted in part in the Daily
next week — representsa courageous step, only
the first, we hope, toward more insightful,
complete information on rape.
We urge victims to release information about
attacks, and we join the police in discouraging
the kindsofdeals which threaten other women
on campus by not alerting them to information
which may protect them. We realize that victims
are traumatized by sexual assaults; we have no
desire to prolong the ordeal by publishing
details which mayallowthe rapist or others to
identify the victim. Publication of non
identifying details, on the other hand,
represents a chance for the victim and the press
to help other women avoid similar experiences.
