## Choose responsible morals, values 
### 
Institutions of higher learning such
as Stanford serve a vital function in
our society; they prepare most of our
future leaders, scientists, teachers,
business executives and other pro
fessionals. In affluence and academic
privilege, Stanford graduates are apt
to stand among the top half of one
percent of the entire world popu
lation.
It therefore seems appropriate that
the intrinsic responsibility of leader
ship be discussed and considered an
essential part of the academic proc
ess here. Decisions made several
years hence by today's students will
largely determine the fate of the
future of life on the planet — peace
and plenty or war and waste.
In recent interviews with individ
uals here there seems to be either
ambivalence or outright aversion to
teaching values and ethics. This at
titude may explain the existence of
some of the many social, ecological
and economic problems that beset us
today.
If we consider that we have a very
real responsibility to the life con
tinuum, then the principle of "doing
unto others" is particularly relevant,
i.e. "Leave for your children what
you would have your forefathers
leave for you."

Formerly, the church was respon
sible for teaching values. Although
they are still trying, religious leaders
have so far been unable to curb the
growth of nuclear weaponry — an act
clearly immoral to anyone who un
derstands the meaning of cold
blooded mass and indiscriminate
murder.
Many more Stanford graduates are
involved in the arms industry than
are actively seeking appropriate
peace with our adversaries. This
trend can be reversed.
Leadership in industrialized Amer
ica has made a host of errors, leading
to altering the oceans' pH, the Earth's
ambient temperature, the soil's
quantity and quality, the air's purity
and the inventory of resources in
Mother Nature's finite and tasl
diminishing pantry.
Much of this has been done in the
name of "national security" and to
day we find that immorality has
placed us in an incomparably in
secure position. With technological
malfunctions causing defense alerts
on almost a weekly basis, and with
overly macho men in power, how
long do we have to enjoy life? What
will our planet look like in 2000?
Many Native American cultures
possessed a deep spiritual connec

tion with the Earth, and their de
cisions were predicted on the effect
they would have on the next seven
generations. "What befalls the Earth
befalls the people of the Earth," they
taught.
American and other leaders in the
industrial age have been guilty of ir
responsible mismanagement of the
dominion over which they wield
great power. What are the values that
allowed this result and why aren't
these issues being confronted and
rectified in today's educational proc
ess?
I believe that we would all be en
hanced by placing greater emphasis
on values and ethics that better our
chance of survival. Caring about oth
ers and acting with the interests of
future generations are essential.
If the world's leading educators fail
to seek consensus on values and to
groom its youth for responsible lead
ership, then who will? If so few stand
up for appropriate values and ethics,
then everyone will suffer and the out
look for the future is grim. World dis
armament is eminently more de
sirable than total devastation by in
tentional or accidental nuclear war.
Where are you leading us, great
white teacher?
