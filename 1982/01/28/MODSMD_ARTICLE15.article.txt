## ASSU: satisfaction or your money back 
### 
This quarter, for the first time in the
five and a half years I've been here,
I'm going to get my money back from
the ASSU. It's a royal pain in the ass,
certainly not worth the $10 or so I'll
get, but I've always disliked the fee
assessment system here and for the
first time I see the chance of making
an effective protest.
Everybody's familiar with those re
volting record clubs which, once
they've got their hooks into you,
send you their hardest-to-sell disks
one after another and bill you for
them unless you take the time and
trouble to mail them back. At least in
that case, though, you had to sign an
agreement to let them impose on
you in that way.
The fee assessments here are worse
in every way. All of us are assessed
without ever having made a specific
engagement to allow it, we get little
or nothing in return, and must waste
considerably more time and effort to
get our money back.
Now an editorial (Daily, Jan. 22) is
suggesting that the imposition be in
cremented. At present they can take
our money without asking us (and
"they" does refer to the Daily as well
as others; the editorial is hardly disin
terested), but the Daily advocates
changing the rules so that unless we
waste more of our time every quarter
when elections are held, we won't be
able to get it back.
I gather the Daily editors, like all
good Americans, believe that people
who don't vote when there's an elec
tion are evil and deserve any kind of
screwing the voters decide on. What
they're missing is that every one of us
who is getting a refund is voting, and
in a much more effective wav tlvn
the fee assessment elections allow.

Reagan dangerous?
I used to think that President
Ronald Reagan was just asleep at the
wheel — relying on advisors to steer
the country on his vaguely defined
economic and political course. I had
reasoned that he had somehow de
veloped the erroneous notion that
Americans, and only Americans,
were good, and that life for these
good people could be made better
by the system unpolluted by govern
ment restriction and aid.
He saw a safety net, albeit very
loosely hung and close to the
ground, protecting the aged and des
perately poor, but giving them just
the appropriate bump on that
ground to get them up and working.
Basically, I thought our president had
well-meaning intentions marred by
paranoid, aggressive, and illogical
thinking and planning. But, they
were still well-meaning.
Then came David Stockman's in
terview in which the president's
budget director admitted that Rea
ganomics was a "trojan horse" de
signed to aid the rich. The trickle of
dollars that would sprinkle onto the
poor suddenly turned into a "golden
shower." Reagan's well-meaning in
tentions fit suddenly into political
dogma — the rich were enhancing
their position at the expense of the
poor. And with full knowledge and
intent!
I found myself doubting that it
could be so obvious. I mean, why was
I, a person above politics, thinking
along Marxist lines?
Thon came the recent annnmm
nient that schools with openly rdcist
politics would be receiving tax ex
emptions. Was this again only Rea
gan asleep at the wheel, blinded by

simplistic, laissez-faire attitudes
towards education, and kept in the
dark by incompetent advisors? Tne
press would certainly have us think
so. And maybe they're right.
But just maybe, this is the Reagan
who knows what he is doing — who
wants to turn the clock back on civil
rights. But then again, I'm not really
sure. Is anyone?
And which Reagan is more danger
ous?

Escondido Village
The Graduate Student Association
along with the Escondido Village
Council is now circulating a petition,
throughout the campus, concerning
the new rent increases of 17 percent.
This increase compounded with last
year's is more than 30 percent an
nually and is simply too much for
many students to bear.
We the students, and I say this from
my own experience canvassing in
Escondido Village, find that for a vast
majority of married students, espe
cially those with children, the burdn
is becoming increasingly hard to
manage. Stipends, salaries, loans, etc.
simply do not keep pace with this
type of increase and are contributing
to a degradation of quality of life,
again, especially for families. More
and more mothers are obliged to
work, many with very young children
(more than 500 under the age of five
in the Village), childcare facilities are
insufficient for the demand and
r U ■ n"pn n <;i V p
The cost of living in general here is
extremely high and so the economic
crunch on a family istremendousand

will only worsen. It is not uncommon
to go without meat, avoid buying
new clothes, put off dental or even
medical care until later and these
conditions in some instances lead to
neglect, and I am not exaggerating. Is
the only position here the good old
American idiom "love it or leave it"
or "If you can't afford it go to the
Midwest?" Is this truly the voice of
educated America?
We sincerely hope that the Univer
sity will hear our plea and pay atten
tion to graduate student demands as
well as those of undergraduates.
Now, our money is going to finance
the Sterling Quad, so that under
graduates can move out of Man
zanita. Why then is Associate Deanof
Residential Education Norm Rob
inson's idea, as expressed in the Dai
ly's graduate life section (Daily,
Jan. 22) to put graduate students into
these same trailers after having
helped finance a dorm? Why, when
Escondido Village is already operat
ing in the black and making a size
able profit, is it that villagers are sup
posed to find the money to use as
capital for construction?
This feudal concept of land man
agement is simply discriminatory;
soon only the wealthy will be able to
study at Stanford. Strangely enough
the opposite position is stated in its
policy position. Is this hypocrisy, or
simply a certain unwillingness to rec
ognize a serious problem?
My plea along with all those who
have voiced their concern, is that of
human being. I am a mother and a
child-care worker here in the Village
and if the voice of children does not
interest the University then I must
question for whom all the illustrious
rdtsearch is done?

the only position here the good old

or "If you can't afford it go to the

educated America?
We sincerely hope that the Univer
sity will hear our plea and pay atten

Now, our money is going to finance
the Sterling Quad, so that under
graduates can move out of Man
zanita. Why then is Associate Deanof
Residential Education Norm Rob
inson's idea, as expressed in the Dai
ly's graduate life section (Daily,
Jan. 22) to put graduate students into
these same trailers after having
helped finance a dorm? Why, when
Escondido Village is already operat
ing in the black and making a size
able profit, is it that villagers are sup
posed to find the money to use as
capital for construction?
This feudal concept of land man
agement is simply discriminatory;
soon only the wealthy will be able to
study at Stanford. Strangely enough
the opposite position is stated in its
policy position. Is this hypocrisy, or
simply a certain unwillingness to rec
ognize a serious problem?
My plea along with all those who
have voiced their concern, is that of
human being. I am a mother and a
child-care worker here in the Village
and if the voice of children does not
interest the University then I must
question for whom all the illustrious
rdtsearch is done?

This quarter, for the first time in the
five and a half years I've been here,
I'm going to get my money back from
the ASSU. It's a royal pain in the ass,
certainly not worth the $10 or so I'll
get, but I've always disliked the fee
assessment system here and for the
first time I see the chance of making
an effective protest.
Everybody's familiar with those re
volting record clubs which, once
they've got their hooks into you,
send you their hardest-to-sell disks
one after another and bill you for
them unless you take the time and
trouble to mail them back. At least in
that case, though, you had to sign an
agreement to let them impose on
you in that way.
The fee assessments here are worse
in every way. All of us are assessed
without ever having made a specific
engagement to allow it, we get little
or nothing in return, and must waste
considerably more time and effort to
get our money back.
Now an editorial (Daily, Jan. 22) is
suggesting that the imposition be in
cremented. At present they can take
our money without asking us (and
"they" does refer to the Daily as well
as others; the editorial is hardly disin
terested), but the Daily advocates
changing the rules so that unless we
waste more of our time every quarter
when elections are held, we won't be
able to get it back.
I gather the Daily editors, like all
good Americans, believe that people
who don't vote when there's an elec
tion are evil and deserve any kind of
screwing the voters decide on. What
they're missing is that every one of us
who is getting a refund is voting, and
in a much more effective wav tlvn
the fee assessment elections allow.

Reagan dangerous?
I used to think that President
Ronald Reagan was just asleep at the
wheel — relying on advisors to steer
the country on his vaguely defined
economic and political course. I had
reasoned that he had somehow de
veloped the erroneous notion that
Americans, and only Americans,
were good, and that life for these
good people could be made better
by the system unpolluted by govern
ment restriction and aid.
He saw a safety net, albeit very
loosely hung and close to the
ground, protecting the aged and des
perately poor, but giving them just
the appropriate bump on that
ground to get them up and working.
Basically, I thought our president had
well-meaning intentions marred by
paranoid, aggressive, and illogical
thinking and planning. But, they
were still well-meaning.
Then came David Stockman's in
terview in which the president's
budget director admitted that Rea
ganomics was a "trojan horse" de
signed to aid the rich. The trickle of
dollars that would sprinkle onto the
poor suddenly turned into a "golden
shower." Reagan's well-meaning in
tentions fit suddenly into political
dogma — the rich were enhancing
their position at the expense of the
poor. And with full knowledge and
intent!
I found myself doubting that it
could be so obvious. I mean, why was
I, a person above politics, thinking
along Marxist lines?
Thon came the recent annnmm
nient that schools with openly rdcist
politics would be receiving tax ex
emptions. Was this again only Rea
gan asleep at the wheel, blinded by

simplistic, laissez-faire attitudes
towards education, and kept in the
dark by incompetent advisors? Tne
press would certainly have us think
so. And maybe they're right.
But just maybe, this is the Reagan
who knows what he is doing — who
wants to turn the clock back on civil
rights. But then again, I'm not really
sure. Is anyone?
And which Reagan is more danger
ous?

The Graduate Student Association
along with the Escondido Village

throughout the campus, concerning
the new rent increases of 17 percent.
This increase compounded with last
year's is more than 30 percent an
nually and is simply too much for
many students to bear.
We the students, and I say this from
my own experience canvassing in
Escondido Village, find that for a vast
majority of married students, espe
cially those with children, the burdn
is becoming increasingly hard to
manage. Stipends, salaries, loans, etc.
simply do not keep pace with this
type of increase and are contributing
to a degradation of quality of life,
again, especially for families. More
and more mothers are obliged to
work, many with very young children
(more than 500 under the age of five
in the Village), childcare facilities are
insufficient for the demand and
