## White businessmen to the rescue? 
### 
Los Angeles — American presi
dents have a habit, in their annual
State of the Union messages, of de
manding an end to urban blight. This
week, it was President Ronald Rea
gan's turn.
Among other platitudes, the presi
dent re-endorsed the creation of
"enterprise zones" in impoverished
communities, proposed special tax
breaks that would encourage busi
nesses to move in and provide jobs.
It's been Reagan's belief that
"those who view poverty and un
employment as permanent afflic
tions of our cities fail to understand
how rapidly the poor can move up
the ladder of success. But to move up
that ladder, they must get on it. And
that's the concept behind enterprise
zones."
As developed by the best-known
enterprise-zoners in Congress, New
York Reps. Jack Kemp and Robert
Garcia, the particulars of the "con
cept" would transform designated
"ghettos" into Western Hong Kongs.
Participating retailers and manufac
turers would receive a variety of tax
credits, exclusions and write-offs.
Meanwhile, the men and women
embraced by these new employers
would earn refundable tax credits in
addition to their salaries.
To date, a myriad of prominent
U.S. corporations has expressed in
terest in the Reagan-Kemp-Garcia
combination. On a recent visit to
Watts in this city's south central sec
tion, however, we found residents
naturally skeptical.
People here don't expect white
businessmen to come running to
their rescue, whether the president
has offered them tax breaks or not.
Such black politicians as Los Angeles

Mayor Tom Bradley have spent years
buttonholing businessmen to invest
in the area that never quite re
covered from the flames of 1965, with
minimal success.
"They all rushed in for meetings af
ter the riots," recalled Ted Watkins,
executive chairman of the Watts La
bor Community Action Committee.
"But after a few years, poor blacks
were no longer the pet group for af
fluent whites to care about."
Indeed, almost 17 years since the
riots that left 34 dead and entire city
blocks burned to the ground, Watts
still cries for attention. Unemploy
ment hovers at 60 percent, gangs
roam the streets. Homes and schools
resemble any other riot-torn district,
and grocery and retail stores are dif
ficult to find. Such enduring prob
lems always seem to merit a few
words from the president each Janu
ary.
But the problems with Reagan's
enterprise zones run deeper than lo
cal mistrust of another federal pro
gram with fancy titles. Though zones
would encourage investment in de
pressed areas, the lure of lower taxes
would simply move jobs from one
area to another and, some critics fear,
create a new cycle of urban blight.
It's unclear, moreover, how new
companies, which normally lose
money during the first three to five
years (and can write off any losses),
would benefit from further tax ex
emption. And there's still confusion
over where enterprise zones are
most needed, how large an area they
would cover, and, finally, whether
businesses would bother moving
into areas of high crime and low skills
simply to reduce their tax burden.
The value of enterprise zones to
urban workers is no less in doubt. It's
worth pointing out that free-trade
areas don't address the structural
problems of unemployment, giving
unskilled laborers the tools to ad
vance on Reagan's "ladder." Ten
months after Great Britain launched
its first of 10 enterprise zones, mostly
low-wage, low-skill industries have
taken up the challenge.

Perhaps the most serious objection
stems from a fear that enterprise
zones will give politicians a justifi
cation for cutting older urban pro
grams. A yearago, Kemp proposed to
leave federal projects intact until Un
cle Sam could back out in the wake of
new-found prosperity.
Yet today, proponents may find

themselves on tougher turf than they
had planned. Reagan has already cut
the Small Business Administration
loan program and reduced funds un
der the Community Development
Block Grant. More cuts are planned
for fiscal 1983.
Judging from his actions, Reagan
has chosen to overlook the values of
locally-owned-and-managed minor
ity businesses. And that s a critical
mistake, according to Watkins,
whose organization employs about
1400 locals in a variety of jobs.
There should be no doubt that en
terprise zones are the logical ex
tension of the administration s supp
ly-side economic policy for the cities.
Ideal as they may sound, enterprise
zones are no replacement for a com
prehensive urban strategy.

"They all rushed in for meetings af
ter the riots," recalled Ted Watkins,
executive chairman of the Watts La
bor Community Action Committee.
"But after a few years, poor blacks
were no longer the pet group for af
fluent whites to care about."
Indeed, almost 17 years since the
riots that left 34 dead and entire city
blocks burned to the ground, Watts
still cries for attention. Unemploy
ment hovers at 60 percent, gangs
roam the streets. Homes and schools
resemble any other riot-torn district,
and grocery and retail stores are dif
ficult to find. Such enduring prob
lems always seem to merit a few
words from the president each Janu
ary.
But the problems with Reagan's
enterprise zones run deeper than lo
cal mistrust of another federal pro
gram with fancy titles. Though zones
would encourage investment in de
pressed areas, the lure of lower taxes
would simply move jobs from one
area to another and, some critics fear,
create a new cycle of urban blight.
It's unclear, moreover, how new
companies, which normally lose
money during the first three to five
years (and can write off any losses),
would benefit from further tax ex
emption. And there's still confusion
over where enterprise zones are
most needed, how large an area they
would cover, and, finally, whether
businesses would bother moving
into areas of high crime and low skills
simply to reduce their tax burden.
The value of enterprise zones to
urban workers is no less in doubt. It's
worth pointing out that free-trade
areas don't address the structural
problems of unemployment, giving
unskilled laborers the tools to ad
vance on Reagan's "ladder." Ten
months after Great Britain launched
its first of 10 enterprise zones, mostly
low-wage, low-skill industries have
taken up the challenge.

Perhaps the most serious objection
stems from a fear that enterprise
zones will give politicians a justifi
cation for cutting older urban pro
grams. A yearago, Kemp proposed to
leave federal projects intact until Un
cle Sam could back out in the wake of
new-found prosperity.
Yet today, proponents may find

had planned. Reagan has already cut
the Small Business Administration
loan program and reduced funds un

Block Grant. More cuts are planned
for fiscal 1983.

has chosen to overlook the values of

1400 locals in a variety of jobs.

zones are no replacement for a com
prehensive urban strategy.

Los Angeles — American presi
dents have a habit, in their annual
State of the Union messages, of de
manding an end to urban blight. This
week, it was President Ronald Rea
gan's turn.
Among other platitudes, the presi
dent re-endorsed the creation of
"enterprise zones" in impoverished
communities, proposed special tax
breaks that would encourage busi
nesses to move in and provide jobs.
It's been Reagan's belief that
"those who view poverty and un
employment as permanent afflic
tions of our cities fail to understand
how rapidly the poor can move up
the ladder of success. But to move up
that ladder, they must get on it. And
that's the concept behind enterprise
zones."
As developed by the best-known
enterprise-zoners in Congress, New
York Reps. Jack Kemp and Robert
Garcia, the particulars of the "con
cept" would transform designated
"ghettos" into Western Hong Kongs.
Participating retailers and manufac
turers would receive a variety of tax
credits, exclusions and write-offs.
Meanwhile, the men and women
embraced by these new employers
would earn refundable tax credits in
addition to their salaries.
To date, a myriad of prominent
U.S. corporations has expressed in
terest in the Reagan-Kemp-Garcia
combination. On a recent visit to
Watts in this city's south central sec
tion, however, we found residents
naturally skeptical.
People here don't expect white
businessmen to come running to
their rescue, whether the president
has offered them tax breaks or not.
Such black politicians as Los Angeles

Mayor Tom Bradley have spent years
buttonholing businessmen to invest
in the area that never quite re
covered from the flames of 1965, with
minimal success.
