What follows here is the
stoiy of a few people who
worked .it the Office of Ex
ploratory Research in EPA's Of
fit o of Research and Develop
ment. In three years the office
grew from a few part-time staff
to a flourishing group of 20
people. These people have
now left, or are packing their
bags.
Here is an office that, if any
thing, will receive only passing
mention in the national press.
This office will not be
eliminated in one clean stroke
of the budget cutter's pencil,
but in cutbacks and re
organizations over the span of
a few years. These goings on
capture well what must be hap
pening in hundreds of offices.
In 1979 Exploratory Research
was the darling of Congress's
plans to reform environmental
research. We were one of the
several new science offices in

government closely tied to an
11' A mission. I bus, not only
were we hoping to set .in ex
ample of better cju.flity rc,»-
search, but onr work had to
rri«• I the regulator's cjfrruiriris
of relevance, Our task was to
identify and nurture study of
new problems Any reasonable
proposal to that effect was ( on
sidered.
I he "ac ademic grants" pro
gram was one of our largest;
we funded nearly 100 projects
on topics ranging; from the
biologic al mechanisms of
< arte «• r o< c'urrenc e to the
< hemistry of < lean air. I li«»r
were international programs
mi a«id rain, the < oastal
"mussel watc It,"and partici
pation in drafting the "(ilobal
2000" report to the president.
()thcr projects were more
foe used on the need for de
s< libing benefits of a < lean en
vironment in economic terms,
in answer to those critiis who
saw only costs. In all this work
wr hoped to anticipate wh.it
new directions the agency's re
search would be turning to.
Our office was born out of a
confluence of agency, Con
gressional and academic in
terests. These were recorded in
a few lines of Congressional
committee recommendations
and budget items, and ocurred
about the time that President
Jimmy Carter was elected to of
fice. Carter's appointee for the
head of Research and De
velopment at the EPA, Steve
Cage, was part of this initiative.
Steve entered government
from a faculty position at the
University of Texas. He started
at the top, as a White House fel
low, and then worked his way
to a position managing energy
policy in EPA's Office of Re
search and Development. His
appointment by Carter to the
"ninth floor" placed him just
below the administrator, in

c harge of a few hundred mil
lion dollars of resources. Steve
inherited an oflice that was
about to be picked apart by the
agency's regulatory offices and
made it viable by reorganizing
the office several times.
Woven into the new pro
gram was concern about acid
rain. The problem sterns from
the increased burning of coal
in the Midwest that releases
smoke laden with sulfur. Sun
and rain transform the sulfur
into sulfuric acid and it blows
east. This contaminates the rain
and affects the soil and water in
places like New York's Adiron
dack Mountains, and the prob
lem was first discovered by
tracing the disappearance of
fish in Adirondack lakes.
Dennis Tirpak was the first
EPA scientist who appreciated
this problem. He rode it, savvy
of its political content, and

wound up on the ninth floor in
the position of leading Steve's
most visible projects. Dennis
hired Bob Barles as his first staff
person. For this opportunity,
Bob put aside doctoral studies
in toxicology at UC-Davis.
Bob acquired an amazing
perception of the ins and outs
of the budget process. Conse
quently he steered Dennis's
shop through the minefields of
forms and deadlines necessary
to assure our program from
year to year. Further, he and
Dennis always seemed to know
what deal could or would be
cut and so best set strategy for
the next round of budget wars.
Not surprisingly, we did well.
Similarly to Dennis, Jack
White was brought on as a
member of Steve's staff to sift
out what new kinds of prob
lems the EPA would have to
tackle. Originally a Navy pilot,

lack was at the University of
Oklahoma's Science Policy
program carrying out a study
on offshore chilling when the
energy crisis broke in 1974.
What had been a rather ob
scure study packed the halls in
Washington D.C. when he pre
sented it, and gave him a cer
tain notoriety.
Jack's staff began small; it
consisted of me, as a part-time
student assistant. The staff was
filled mainly with temporary
slots and people on detail, as
were much of the agency's
growing offices. Besides mak
ing cutbacks simpler, since
they were outside the Civil Ser
vice system, these hidden posi
tions disguise the extent of ac
tual cuts since they were never
counted among the EPA staff.



Features on the Environment
Bob the toxicologist, joined Jack's staff and
brought direction of the Mussel Watch program
with him. By monitoring a wide range of con
taminants concentrated by these übiquitous
shellfish, very low levels of ocean pollution
could be detected. When low levels of radio
active plutonium were suspected of leaking
from Navy disposal sites off of the San Francisco
(oast, Bobs mussels aided the tracing of its
source. At the same time Bob was explaining this
to the regional office in San Francisco, he was
furiously defending the program against cuts
from the budget".
Steve was the first to leave after the election,
along with half-dozen other top officials who
served at the pleasure of the president. In the fall
of 1980 the handwriting was on the wall and by
Ronald Reagan's election, Steve's move was
more or less firm. He accepted a vice-presidency
with International Harvester. Part of his family
remained in D.C. until summer, so that his
daughter could finish high school.
That September, a group of Republican sena
tors managed to hold off much of the govern
ment's appropriation of funds, giving the new

about various activities that I
recalled produced much
nervous laughter.

administration a say in previously set govern
ment spending levels for fiscal 1981. This was the
harbinger of the heavy-handed budget manipu
lations with which the executive side of govern
ment has been reined in since.
With no one in the front office after Steve's
departure, our office lost its initiative and the
rest of the group he selected drifted into other
areas. I lost touch with Jack for a while after he
left EPA — he moved into a permanent position
at Department of Interior before the election.
However, he was not prepared for the carnage
when Secretary James Watt reorganized the In
terior Department. But things have turned out
well for Jack; last I heard he was being con
sidered for the head of New York State Energy
Research and Development Administration.
Dennis announced his departure just two
weeks before he left at the end of this August.
He moved into a research directorship with Tex
aco, also in New York. This was when I left, also.
By October 1981, the EPA's 1982 budget was
still not appropriated by Congress. Also, the
books had not been closed on the 1981 budget.
By this maneuver, the president's budget office
had found an edge to shave 10 percent off of
monies appropriated before Reagan took of
fice. On top of this recension, the 1982 de facto
budget distributed a further series of cuts,
averaging through the agency about 10 percent.
Furthermore, a great deal of attention focused
on drafting and negotiating the 1983 budget: the
first "totally Reagan" budget. Usually out by
mid-January, Reagan has put off his fiscal budget
decisions until February. As a consequence
there are three annual budgets sitting in

complete and unresolved on Agency desks, an
unprecedented situation.
The uncertainty of more than a year without
an accepted operating plan has not been
without its effect on EPA's operations. The Rea
gan administration's new appointees came in
dedicated to regulatory reform. However, re
forming regulations takes resources and the cur
rent trend has, at times, seemed adequate only
for abandoning regulations, not reforming
them. At the proposed level of cuts, regulated
industries have feared no one would be left to
make changes for which they had hoped, and so
even the previous bitter opponents of the EPA
have argued .against the cuts.
Most of Reagan's appointees have seen their
roles dwindle from that of reform in the interests
of the private sector to refereeing about where
the ax should fall. In response, a few have left
and rumors about resignations among the rest
are rampant. Understandably, morale is non-ex
istent.
The man who took over Jack's position wrote
to tell me Steve's replacement has already come
and gone. He was a researcher from Denver Re
search Institute in his early 30s, and he must
have found his background of little help when
faced with the budget fights he found himself in
the middle of. Soon more and more key de
cisions were taking place without his involve
ment. There has been another name mentioned
for his replacement, but apparently this person
has reservations about taking the office. His ap
pointment is dragging on and on.
I visited the office just before Christmas. Work
has not gone ahead at all from what I remember
had been accomplished by this summer. We left
early on Friday, adjourning to a local bar. My
questions about various activities that I recalled
produced much nervous laughter. Everyone was
talking openly about their plans to leave. Bob
and John are both speaking of returning to Cali
fornia. The scuttlebutt is that a large reorganiza
tion, bringing substantial "reductions in force"
and "downgrades" is in the offingforthespring.
Those remaining from our office have scat
tered from the ninth floorthroughoutthe build
ing.
When a change in government occurs after an
election, the immediate response of a bureau
cracy is to enter into in-depth self-critical plan
ning. Each office considers its alternatives to an
ticipate what new mission the new adminis
tration will put it to. This planning and posturing
went on after the election.
But now, a year and then some later, this flurry
on activity has passed. The irony of the situation
is that offices such as the one described here are
less efficient than ever before, and certainly less
productive than the level of cuts would suggest.
With little institutional memory, leadership or
resources, EPA may be tested severely if another
Three Mile Island or Love Canal arises.
The new people brought in by the adminis
tration face the same bureaucracy as their pred
ecessors, but because many of their resources
and political bases have disappeared they are in
a frustrating and unworkable position. It re
minds me of a "New Yorker" cartoon: A young
couple is standing in front of the bare founda
tion of their house, looking somewhat
bewildered. They explain, "Our garage sale vast
ly exceeded out wildest expectations." Likewise
the new appointees try to figure out what they
have left, trying to recall how a dedication to a
smaller, more efficient government ever got
them into a position like this.

sented it, and gave him a cer
tain notoriety.
Jack's staff began small; it
consisted of me, as a part-time
student assistant. The staff was
filled mainly with temporary
slots and people on detail, as
were much of the agency's
growing offices. Besides mak
ing cutbacks simpler, since
they were outside the Civil Ser
vice system, these hidden posi
tions disguise the extent of ac
tual cuts since they were never
counted among the EPA staff.



Features on the Environment
Bob the toxicologist, joined Jack's staff and
brought direction of the Mussel Watch program
with him. By monitoring a wide range of con
taminants concentrated by these übiquitous
shellfish, very low levels of ocean pollution
could be detected. When low levels of radio
active plutonium were suspected of leaking
from Navy disposal sites off of the San Francisco
(oast, Bobs mussels aided the tracing of its
source. At the same time Bob was explaining this
to the regional office in San Francisco, he was
furiously defending the program against cuts
from the budget".
Steve was the first to leave after the election,
along with half-dozen other top officials who
served at the pleasure of the president. In the fall
of 1980 the handwriting was on the wall and by
Ronald Reagan's election, Steve's move was
more or less firm. He accepted a vice-presidency
with International Harvester. Part of his family
remained in D.C. until summer, so that his
daughter could finish high school.
That September, a group of Republican sena
tors managed to hold off much of the govern
ment's appropriation of funds, giving the new

administration a say in previously set govern
ment spending levels for fiscal 1981. This was the
harbinger of the heavy-handed budget manipu
lations with which the executive side of govern
ment has been reined in since.
With no one in the front office after Steve's
departure, our office lost its initiative and the
rest of the group he selected drifted into other
areas. I lost touch with Jack for a while after he
left EPA — he moved into a permanent position
at Department of Interior before the election.
However, he was not prepared for the carnage
when Secretary James Watt reorganized the In
terior Department. But things have turned out
well for Jack; last I heard he was being con
sidered for the head of New York State Energy
Research and Development Administration.
Dennis announced his departure just two
weeks before he left at the end of this August.
He moved into a research directorship with Tex
aco, also in New York. This was when I left, also.
By October 1981, the EPA's 1982 budget was
still not appropriated by Congress. Also, the
books had not been closed on the 1981 budget.
By this maneuver, the president's budget office
had found an edge to shave 10 percent off of
monies appropriated before Reagan took of
fice. On top of this recension, the 1982 de facto
budget distributed a further series of cuts,
averaging through the agency about 10 percent.
Furthermore, a great deal of attention focused
on drafting and negotiating the 1983 budget: the
first "totally Reagan" budget. Usually out by
mid-January, Reagan has put off his fiscal budget
decisions until February. As a consequence
there are three annual budgets sitting in

complete and unresolved on Agency desks, an
unprecedented situation.
The uncertainty of more than a year without
an accepted operating plan has not been
without its effect on EPA's operations. The Rea
gan administration's new appointees came in
dedicated to regulatory reform. However, re
forming regulations takes resources and the cur
rent trend has, at times, seemed adequate only
for abandoning regulations, not reforming
them. At the proposed level of cuts, regulated
industries have feared no one would be left to
make changes for which they had hoped, and so
even the previous bitter opponents of the EPA
have argued .against the cuts.
Most of Reagan's appointees have seen their
roles dwindle from that of reform in the interests
of the private sector to refereeing about where
the ax should fall. In response, a few have left
and rumors about resignations among the rest
are rampant. Understandably, morale is non-ex
istent.
The man who took over Jack's position wrote
to tell me Steve's replacement has already come
and gone. He was a researcher from Denver Re
search Institute in his early 30s, and he must
have found his background of little help when
faced with the budget fights he found himself in
the middle of. Soon more and more key de
cisions were taking place without his involve
ment. There has been another name mentioned
for his replacement, but apparently this person
has reservations about taking the office. His ap
pointment is dragging on and on.
I visited the office just before Christmas. Work
has not gone ahead at all from what I remember
had been accomplished by this summer. We left
early on Friday, adjourning to a local bar. My
questions about various activities that I recalled
produced much nervous laughter. Everyone was
talking openly about their plans to leave. Bob
and John are both speaking of returning to Cali
fornia. The scuttlebutt is that a large reorganiza
tion, bringing substantial "reductions in force"
and "downgrades" is in the offingforthespring.
Those remaining from our office have scat
tered from the ninth floorthroughoutthe build
ing.
When a change in government occurs after an
election, the immediate response of a bureau
cracy is to enter into in-depth self-critical plan
ning. Each office considers its alternatives to an
ticipate what new mission the new adminis
tration will put it to. This planning and posturing
went on after the election.
But now, a year and then some later, this flurry
on activity has passed. The irony of the situation
is that offices such as the one described here are
less efficient than ever before, and certainly less
productive than the level of cuts would suggest.
With little institutional memory, leadership or
resources, EPA may be tested severely if another
Three Mile Island or Love Canal arises.
The new people brought in by the adminis
tration face the same bureaucracy as their pred
ecessors, but because many of their resources
and political bases have disappeared they are in
a frustrating and unworkable position. It re
minds me of a "New Yorker" cartoon: A young
couple is standing in front of the bare founda
tion of their house, looking somewhat
bewildered. They explain, "Our garage sale vast
ly exceeded out wildest expectations." Likewise
the new appointees try to figure out what they
have left, trying to recall how a dedication to a
smaller, more efficient government ever got
them into a position like this.

What follows here is the
stoiy of a few people who
worked .it the Office of Ex
ploratory Research in EPA's Of
fit o of Research and Develop
ment. In three years the office
grew from a few part-time staff
to a flourishing group of 20
people. These people have
now left, or are packing their
bags.
Here is an office that, if any
thing, will receive only passing
mention in the national press.
This office will not be
eliminated in one clean stroke
of the budget cutter's pencil,
but in cutbacks and re
organizations over the span of
a few years. These goings on
capture well what must be hap
pening in hundreds of offices.
In 1979 Exploratory Research
was the darling of Congress's
plans to reform environmental
research. We were one of the
several new science offices in

government closely tied to an
11' A mission. I bus, not only
were we hoping to set .in ex
ample of better cju.flity rc,»-
search, but onr work had to
rri«• I the regulator's cjfrruiriris
of relevance, Our task was to
identify and nurture study of
new problems Any reasonable
proposal to that effect was ( on
sidered.
I he "ac ademic grants" pro
gram was one of our largest;
we funded nearly 100 projects
on topics ranging; from the
biologic al mechanisms of
< arte «• r o< c'urrenc e to the
< hemistry of < lean air. I li«»r
were international programs
mi a«id rain, the < oastal
"mussel watc It,"and partici
pation in drafting the "(ilobal
2000" report to the president.
()thcr projects were more
foe used on the need for de
s< libing benefits of a < lean en
vironment in economic terms,
in answer to those critiis who
saw only costs. In all this work
wr hoped to anticipate wh.it
new directions the agency's re
search would be turning to.
Our office was born out of a
confluence of agency, Con
gressional and academic in
terests. These were recorded in
a few lines of Congressional
committee recommendations
and budget items, and ocurred
about the time that President
Jimmy Carter was elected to of
fice. Carter's appointee for the
head of Research and De
velopment at the EPA, Steve
Cage, was part of this initiative.
Steve entered government
from a faculty position at the
University of Texas. He started
at the top, as a White House fel
low, and then worked his way
to a position managing energy
policy in EPA's Office of Re
search and Development. His
appointment by Carter to the
"ninth floor" placed him just
below the administrator, in

c harge of a few hundred mil
lion dollars of resources. Steve
inherited an oflice that was
about to be picked apart by the
agency's regulatory offices and
made it viable by reorganizing
the office several times.
Woven into the new pro
gram was concern about acid
rain. The problem sterns from
the increased burning of coal
in the Midwest that releases
smoke laden with sulfur. Sun
and rain transform the sulfur
into sulfuric acid and it blows
east. This contaminates the rain
and affects the soil and water in
places like New York's Adiron
dack Mountains, and the prob
lem was first discovered by
tracing the disappearance of
fish in Adirondack lakes.
Dennis Tirpak was the first
EPA scientist who appreciated
this problem. He rode it, savvy
of its political content, and

wound up on the ninth floor in
the position of leading Steve's
most visible projects. Dennis
hired Bob Barles as his first staff
person. For this opportunity,
Bob put aside doctoral studies
in toxicology at UC-Davis.
Bob acquired an amazing
perception of the ins and outs
of the budget process. Conse
quently he steered Dennis's
shop through the minefields of
forms and deadlines necessary
to assure our program from
year to year. Further, he and
Dennis always seemed to know
what deal could or would be
cut and so best set strategy for
the next round of budget wars.
Not surprisingly, we did well.
Similarly to Dennis, Jack
White was brought on as a
member of Steve's staff to sift
out what new kinds of prob
lems the EPA would have to
tackle. Originally a Navy pilot,

lack was at the University of
Oklahoma's Science Policy
program carrying out a study
on offshore chilling when the
energy crisis broke in 1974.
What had been a rather ob
scure study packed the halls in
Washington D.C. when he pre
sented it, and gave him a cer
tain notoriety.
Jack's staff began small; it
consisted of me, as a part-time
student assistant. The staff was
filled mainly with temporary
slots and people on detail, as
were much of the agency's
growing offices. Besides mak
ing cutbacks simpler, since
they were outside the Civil Ser

Three Mile Island or Love Canal arises.
The new people brought in by the adminis
tration face the same bureaucracy as their pred
ecessors, but because many of their resources
and political bases have disappeared they are in
a frustrating and unworkable position. It re
minds me of a "New Yorker" cartoon: A young
couple is standing in front of the bare founda
tion of their house, looking somewhat
bewildered. They explain, "Our garage sale vast
ly exceeded out wildest expectations." Likewise
the new appointees try to figure out what they
have left, trying to recall how a dedication to a
smaller, more efficient government ever got
them into a position like this.

What follows here is the
stoiy of a few people who
worked .it the Office of Ex
ploratory Research in EPA's Of
fit o of Research and Develop
ment. In three years the office
grew from a few part-time staff
to a flourishing group of 20
people. These people have
now left, or are packing their
bags.
Here is an office that, if any
thing, will receive only passing
mention in the national press.
This office will not be
eliminated in one clean stroke
of the budget cutter's pencil,
but in cutbacks and re
organizations over the span of
a few years. These goings on
capture well what must be hap
pening in hundreds of offices.
In 1979 Exploratory Research
was the darling of Congress's
plans to reform environmental
research. We were one of the
several new science offices in

government closely tied to an
11' A mission. I bus, not only
were we hoping to set .in ex

search, but onr work had to

of relevance, Our task was to
identify and nurture study of
new problems Any reasonable
proposal to that effect was ( on
sidered.
I he "ac ademic grants" pro
gram was one of our largest;
we funded nearly 100 projects
on topics ranging; from the
biologic al mechanisms of
< arte «• r o< c'urrenc e to the
< hemistry of < lean air. I li«»r
were international programs
mi a«id rain, the < oastal
"mussel watc It,"and partici
pation in drafting the "(ilobal
2000" report to the president.
()thcr projects were more
foe used on the need for de
s< libing benefits of a < lean en
vironment in economic terms,
in answer to those critiis who
saw only costs. In all this work
wr hoped to anticipate wh.it
new directions the agency's re
search would be turning to.
Our office was born out of a
confluence of agency, Con
gressional and academic in
terests. These were recorded in
a few lines of Congressional
committee recommendations
and budget items, and ocurred
about the time that President
Jimmy Carter was elected to of
fice. Carter's appointee for the
head of Research and De
velopment at the EPA, Steve
Cage, was part of this initiative.
Steve entered government
from a faculty position at the
University of Texas. He started
at the top, as a White House fel
low, and then worked his way
to a position managing energy
policy in EPA's Office of Re
search and Development. His
appointment by Carter to the
"ninth floor" placed him just
below the administrator, in

c harge of a few hundred mil
lion dollars of resources. Steve
inherited an oflice that was
about to be picked apart by the
agency's regulatory offices and
made it viable by reorganizing
the office several times.
Woven into the new pro
gram was concern about acid
rain. The problem sterns from
the increased burning of coal
in the Midwest that releases
smoke laden with sulfur. Sun
and rain transform the sulfur
into sulfuric acid and it blows
east. This contaminates the rain
and affects the soil and water in
places like New York's Adiron
dack Mountains, and the prob
lem was first discovered by
tracing the disappearance of
fish in Adirondack lakes.
Dennis Tirpak was the first
EPA scientist who appreciated
this problem. He rode it, savvy
of its political content, and

wound up on the ninth floor in
the position of leading Steve's
most visible projects. Dennis
hired Bob Barles as his first staff
person. For this opportunity,
Bob put aside doctoral studies
in toxicology at UC-Davis.
Bob acquired an amazing
perception of the ins and outs
of the budget process. Conse
quently he steered Dennis's
shop through the minefields of
forms and deadlines necessary
to assure our program from
year to year. Further, he and
Dennis always seemed to know
what deal could or would be
cut and so best set strategy for
the next round of budget wars.
Not surprisingly, we did well.
Similarly to Dennis, Jack
White was brought on as a
member of Steve's staff to sift
out what new kinds of prob
lems the EPA would have to
tackle. Originally a Navy pilot,

lack was at the University of
Oklahoma's Science Policy
program carrying out a study
on offshore chilling when the
energy crisis broke in 1974.
What had been a rather ob
scure study packed the halls in
Washington D.C. when he pre
sented it, and gave him a cer
tain notoriety.
Jack's staff began small; it
consisted of me, as a part-time
student assistant. The staff was
filled mainly with temporary
slots and people on detail, as
were much of the agency's
growing offices. Besides mak
ing cutbacks simpler, since
they were outside the Civil Ser
vice system, these hidden posi
tions disguise the extent of ac
tual cuts since they were never
counted among the EPA staff.



Features on the Environment
Bob the toxicologist, joined Jack's staff and
brought direction of the Mussel Watch program
with him. By monitoring a wide range of con
taminants concentrated by these übiquitous
shellfish, very low levels of ocean pollution
could be detected. When low levels of radio
active plutonium were suspected of leaking
from Navy disposal sites off of the San Francisco
(oast, Bobs mussels aided the tracing of its
source. At the same time Bob was explaining this
to the regional office in San Francisco, he was
furiously defending the program against cuts
from the budget".
Steve was the first to leave after the election,
along with half-dozen other top officials who
served at the pleasure of the president. In the fall
of 1980 the handwriting was on the wall and by
Ronald Reagan's election, Steve's move was
more or less firm. He accepted a vice-presidency
with International Harvester. Part of his family
remained in D.C. until summer, so that his
daughter could finish high school.
That September, a group of Republican sena
tors managed to hold off much of the govern
ment's appropriation of funds, giving the new

about various activities that I
recalled produced much
nervous laughter.

administration a say in previously set govern
ment spending levels for fiscal 1981. This was the
harbinger of the heavy-handed budget manipu
lations with which the executive side of govern
ment has been reined in since.
With no one in the front office after Steve's
departure, our office lost its initiative and the
rest of the group he selected drifted into other
areas. I lost touch with Jack for a while after he
left EPA — he moved into a permanent position
at Department of Interior before the election.
However, he was not prepared for the carnage
when Secretary James Watt reorganized the In
terior Department. But things have turned out
well for Jack; last I heard he was being con
sidered for the head of New York State Energy
Research and Development Administration.
Dennis announced his departure just two
weeks before he left at the end of this August.
He moved into a research directorship with Tex
aco, also in New York. This was when I left, also.
By October 1981, the EPA's 1982 budget was
still not appropriated by Congress. Also, the
books had not been closed on the 1981 budget.
By this maneuver, the president's budget office
had found an edge to shave 10 percent off of
monies appropriated before Reagan took of
fice. On top of this recension, the 1982 de facto
budget distributed a further series of cuts,
averaging through the agency about 10 percent.
Furthermore, a great deal of attention focused
on drafting and negotiating the 1983 budget: the
first "totally Reagan" budget. Usually out by
mid-January, Reagan has put off his fiscal budget
decisions until February. As a consequence
there are three annual budgets sitting in

complete and unresolved on Agency desks, an
unprecedented situation.
The uncertainty of more than a year without
an accepted operating plan has not been
without its effect on EPA's operations. The Rea
gan administration's new appointees came in
dedicated to regulatory reform. However, re
forming regulations takes resources and the cur
rent trend has, at times, seemed adequate only
for abandoning regulations, not reforming
them. At the proposed level of cuts, regulated
industries have feared no one would be left to
make changes for which they had hoped, and so
even the previous bitter opponents of the EPA
have argued .against the cuts.
Most of Reagan's appointees have seen their
roles dwindle from that of reform in the interests
of the private sector to refereeing about where
the ax should fall. In response, a few have left
and rumors about resignations among the rest
are rampant. Understandably, morale is non-ex
istent.
The man who took over Jack's position wrote
to tell me Steve's replacement has already come
and gone. He was a researcher from Denver Re
search Institute in his early 30s, and he must
have found his background of little help when
faced with the budget fights he found himself in
the middle of. Soon more and more key de
cisions were taking place without his involve
ment. There has been another name mentioned
for his replacement, but apparently this person
has reservations about taking the office. His ap
pointment is dragging on and on.
I visited the office just before Christmas. Work
has not gone ahead at all from what I remember
had been accomplished by this summer. We left
early on Friday, adjourning to a local bar. My
questions about various activities that I recalled
produced much nervous laughter. Everyone was
talking openly about their plans to leave. Bob
and John are both speaking of returning to Cali
fornia. The scuttlebutt is that a large reorganiza
tion, bringing substantial "reductions in force"
and "downgrades" is in the offingforthespring.
Those remaining from our office have scat
tered from the ninth floorthroughoutthe build
ing.
When a change in government occurs after an
election, the immediate response of a bureau
cracy is to enter into in-depth self-critical plan
ning. Each office considers its alternatives to an
ticipate what new mission the new adminis
tration will put it to. This planning and posturing
went on after the election.
But now, a year and then some later, this flurry
on activity has passed. The irony of the situation
is that offices such as the one described here are
less efficient than ever before, and certainly less
productive than the level of cuts would suggest.
With little institutional memory, leadership or
resources, EPA may be tested severely if another
Three Mile Island or Love Canal arises.
The new people brought in by the adminis
tration face the same bureaucracy as their pred
ecessors, but because many of their resources
and political bases have disappeared they are in
a frustrating and unworkable position. It re
minds me of a "New Yorker" cartoon: A young

what deal could or would be
cut and so best set strategy for
the next round of budget wars.
Not surprisingly, we did well.
Similarly to Dennis, Jack
White was brought on as a
member of Steve's staff to sift
out what new kinds of prob
lems the EPA would have to
tackle. Originally a Navy pilot,

lack was at the University of
Oklahoma's Science Policy
program carrying out a study
on offshore chilling when the
energy crisis broke in 1974.
What had been a rather ob
scure study packed the halls in
Washington D.C. when he pre
sented it, and gave him a cer
tain notoriety.
Jack's staff began small; it
consisted of me, as a part-time
student assistant. The staff was
filled mainly with temporary
slots and people on detail, as
were much of the agency's
growing offices. Besides mak
ing cutbacks simpler, since
they were outside the Civil Ser
vice system, these hidden posi
tions disguise the extent of ac
tual cuts since they were never
counted among the EPA staff.



Features on the Environment
Bob the toxicologist, joined Jack's staff and
brought direction of the Mussel Watch program
with him. By monitoring a wide range of con
taminants concentrated by these übiquitous
shellfish, very low levels of ocean pollution
could be detected. When low levels of radio
active plutonium were suspected of leaking
from Navy disposal sites off of the San Francisco
(oast, Bobs mussels aided the tracing of its
source. At the same time Bob was explaining this
to the regional office in San Francisco, he was
furiously defending the program against cuts
from the budget".
Steve was the first to leave after the election,
along with half-dozen other top officials who
served at the pleasure of the president. In the fall
of 1980 the handwriting was on the wall and by
Ronald Reagan's election, Steve's move was
more or less firm. He accepted a vice-presidency
with International Harvester. Part of his family
remained in D.C. until summer, so that his
daughter could finish high school.
That September, a group of Republican sena
tors managed to hold off much of the govern
ment's appropriation of funds, giving the new

administration a say in previously set govern
ment spending levels for fiscal 1981. This was the
harbinger of the heavy-handed budget manipu
lations with which the executive side of govern
ment has been reined in since.
With no one in the front office after Steve's
departure, our office lost its initiative and the
rest of the group he selected drifted into other
areas. I lost touch with Jack for a while after he
left EPA — he moved into a permanent position
at Department of Interior before the election.
However, he was not prepared for the carnage
when Secretary James Watt reorganized the In
terior Department. But things have turned out
well for Jack; last I heard he was being con
sidered for the head of New York State Energy
Research and Development Administration.
Dennis announced his departure just two
weeks before he left at the end of this August.
He moved into a research directorship with Tex
aco, also in New York. This was when I left, also.
By October 1981, the EPA's 1982 budget was
still not appropriated by Congress. Also, the
books had not been closed on the 1981 budget.
By this maneuver, the president's budget office
had found an edge to shave 10 percent off of
monies appropriated before Reagan took of
fice. On top of this recension, the 1982 de facto
budget distributed a further series of cuts,
averaging through the agency about 10 percent.
Furthermore, a great deal of attention focused
on drafting and negotiating the 1983 budget: the
first "totally Reagan" budget. Usually out by
mid-January, Reagan has put off his fiscal budget
decisions until February. As a consequence
there are three annual budgets sitting in

complete and unresolved on Agency desks, an
unprecedented situation.
The uncertainty of more than a year without
an accepted operating plan has not been
without its effect on EPA's operations. The Rea
gan administration's new appointees came in
dedicated to regulatory reform. However, re
forming regulations takes resources and the cur
rent trend has, at times, seemed adequate only
for abandoning regulations, not reforming
them. At the proposed level of cuts, regulated
industries have feared no one would be left to
make changes for which they had hoped, and so
even the previous bitter opponents of the EPA
have argued .against the cuts.
Most of Reagan's appointees have seen their
roles dwindle from that of reform in the interests
of the private sector to refereeing about where
the ax should fall. In response, a few have left
and rumors about resignations among the rest
are rampant. Understandably, morale is non-ex
istent.
The man who took over Jack's position wrote
to tell me Steve's replacement has already come
and gone. He was a researcher from Denver Re
search Institute in his early 30s, and he must
have found his background of little help when
faced with the budget fights he found himself in
the middle of. Soon more and more key de
cisions were taking place without his involve
ment. There has been another name mentioned
for his replacement, but apparently this person
has reservations about taking the office. His ap
pointment is dragging on and on.
I visited the office just before Christmas. Work
has not gone ahead at all from what I remember
had been accomplished by this summer. We left
early on Friday, adjourning to a local bar. My
questions about various activities that I recalled
produced much nervous laughter. Everyone was
talking openly about their plans to leave. Bob
and John are both speaking of returning to Cali
fornia. The scuttlebutt is that a large reorganiza
tion, bringing substantial "reductions in force"
and "downgrades" is in the offingforthespring.
Those remaining from our office have scat
tered from the ninth floorthroughoutthe build
ing.
When a change in government occurs after an
election, the immediate response of a bureau
cracy is to enter into in-depth self-critical plan
ning. Each office considers its alternatives to an
ticipate what new mission the new adminis
tration will put it to. This planning and posturing
went on after the election.
But now, a year and then some later, this flurry
on activity has passed. The irony of the situation
is that offices such as the one described here are
less efficient than ever before, and certainly less
productive than the level of cuts would suggest.
With little institutional memory, leadership or
resources, EPA may be tested severely if another
Three Mile Island or Love Canal arises.
The new people brought in by the adminis
tration face the same bureaucracy as their pred
ecessors, but because many of their resources
and political bases have disappeared they are in
a frustrating and unworkable position. It re
minds me of a "New Yorker" cartoon: A young
couple is standing in front of the bare founda
tion of their house, looking somewhat
bewildered. They explain, "Our garage sale vast
ly exceeded out wildest expectations." Likewise
the new appointees try to figure out what they
have left, trying to recall how a dedication to a
smaller, more efficient government ever got
them into a position like this.

What follows here is the
stoiy of a few people who
worked .it the Office of Ex
ploratory Research in EPA's Of
fit o of Research and Develop
ment. In three years the office
grew from a few part-time staff
to a flourishing group of 20
people. These people have
now left, or are packing their
bags.
Here is an office that, if any
thing, will receive only passing
mention in the national press.
This office will not be
eliminated in one clean stroke
of the budget cutter's pencil,
but in cutbacks and re
organizations over the span of
a few years. These goings on
capture well what must be hap
pening in hundreds of offices.
In 1979 Exploratory Research
was the darling of Congress's
plans to reform environmental
research. We were one of the
several new science offices in

government closely tied to an
11' A mission. I bus, not only
were we hoping to set .in ex
ample of better cju.flity rc,»-
search, but onr work had to

of relevance, Our task was to
identify and nurture study of
new problems Any reasonable
proposal to that effect was ( on
sidered.
I he "ac ademic grants" pro
gram was one of our largest;
we funded nearly 100 projects
on topics ranging; from the
biologic al mechanisms of
< arte «• r o< c'urrenc e to the
< hemistry of < lean air. I li«»r
were international programs
mi a«id rain, the < oastal
"mussel watc It,"and partici
pation in drafting the "(ilobal
2000" report to the president.
()thcr projects were more
foe used on the need for de
s< libing benefits of a < lean en
vironment in economic terms,
in answer to those critiis who
saw only costs. In all this work
wr hoped to anticipate wh.it
new directions the agency's re
search would be turning to.
Our office was born out of a
confluence of agency, Con
gressional and academic in
terests. These were recorded in
a few lines of Congressional
committee recommendations
and budget items, and ocurred
about the time that President
Jimmy Carter was elected to of
fice. Carter's appointee for the
head of Research and De
velopment at the EPA, Steve
Cage, was part of this initiative.
Steve entered government
from a faculty position at the
University of Texas. He started
at the top, as a White House fel
low, and then worked his way
to a position managing energy
policy in EPA's Office of Re
search and Development. His
appointment by Carter to the
"ninth floor" placed him just
below the administrator, in

c harge of a few hundred mil
lion dollars of resources. Steve
inherited an oflice that was
about to be picked apart by the
agency's regulatory offices and
made it viable by reorganizing
the office several times.
Woven into the new pro
gram was concern about acid
rain. The problem sterns from
the increased burning of coal
in the Midwest that releases
smoke laden with sulfur. Sun
and rain transform the sulfur
into sulfuric acid and it blows
east. This contaminates the rain
and affects the soil and water in
places like New York's Adiron
dack Mountains, and the prob
lem was first discovered by
tracing the disappearance of
fish in Adirondack lakes.
Dennis Tirpak was the first
EPA scientist who appreciated
this problem. He rode it, savvy
of its political content, and

wound up on the ninth floor in
the position of leading Steve's
most visible projects. Dennis
hired Bob Barles as his first staff
person. For this opportunity,
Bob put aside doctoral studies
in toxicology at UC-Davis.
Bob acquired an amazing
perception of the ins and outs
of the budget process. Conse
quently he steered Dennis's
shop through the minefields of
forms and deadlines necessary
to assure our program from
year to year. Further, he and
Dennis always seemed to know
what deal could or would be
cut and so best set strategy for
the next round of budget wars.
Not surprisingly, we did well.
Similarly to Dennis, Jack
White was brought on as a
member of Steve's staff to sift

lems the EPA would have to
