When an agency or offic •• in
the government is being dis
mantled, the atmosphere in
the office is best described as
< omplete un< ertainty No
word comes down to give
goals, direction or plans. No
one knows what to do next.

What follows here is the
stoiy of a few people who
worked .it the Office of Ex
ploratory Research in EPA's Of
fit o of Research and Develop
ment. In three years the office
grew from a few part-time staff
to a flourishing group of 20
people. These people have
now left, or are packing their
bags.
Here is an office that, if any
thing, will receive only passing
mention in the national press.
This office will not be
eliminated in one clean stroke
of the budget cutter's pencil,
but in cutbacks and re
organizations over the span of
a few years. These goings on
capture well what must be hap
pening in hundreds of offices.
In 1979 Exploratory Research
was the darling of Congress's
plans to reform environmental
research. We were one of the
several new science offices in

government closely tied to an
11' A mission. I bus, not only
were we hoping to set .in ex
ample of better cju.flity rc,»-
search, but onr work had to
rri«• I the regulator's cjfrruiriris
of relevance, Our task was to
identify and nurture study of
new problems Any reasonable
proposal to that effect was ( on
sidered.
I he "ac ademic grants" pro
gram was one of our largest;
we funded nearly 100 projects
on topics ranging; from the
biologic al mechanisms of
< arte «• r o< c'urrenc e to the
< hemistry of < lean air. I li«»r
were international programs
mi a«id rain, the < oastal
"mussel watc It,"and partici
pation in drafting the "(ilobal
2000" report to the president.
()thcr projects were more
foe used on the need for de
s< libing benefits of a < lean en
vironment in economic terms,
in answer to those critiis who
saw only costs. In all this work
wr hoped to anticipate wh.it
new directions the agency's re
search would be turning to.
Our office was born out of a
confluence of agency, Con
gressional and academic in
terests. These were recorded in
a few lines of Congressional
committee recommendations
and budget items, and ocurred
about the time that President
Jimmy Carter was elected to of
fice. Carter's appointee for the
head of Research and De
velopment at the EPA, Steve
Cage, was part of this initiative.
Steve entered government
from a faculty position at the
University of Texas. He started
at the top, as a White House fel
low, and then worked his way
to a position managing energy
policy in EPA's Office of Re
search and Development. His
appointment by Carter to the
"ninth floor" placed him just
below the administrator, in

c harge of a few hundred mil
lion dollars of resources. Steve
inherited an oflice that was
about to be picked apart by the
agency's regulatory offices and
made it viable by reorganizing
the office several times.
Woven into the new pro
gram was concern about acid
rain. The problem sterns from
the increased burning of coal
in the Midwest that releases
smoke laden with sulfur. Sun
and rain transform the sulfur
into sulfuric acid and it blows
east. This contaminates the rain
and affects the soil and water in
places like New York's Adiron
dack Mountains, and the prob
lem was first discovered by
tracing the disappearance of
fish in Adirondack lakes.
Dennis Tirpak was the first
EPA scientist who appreciated
this problem. He rode it, savvy
of its political content, and

wound up on the ninth floor in
the position of leading Steve's
most visible projects. Dennis
hired Bob Barles as his first staff
person. For this opportunity,
Bob put aside doctoral studies
in toxicology at UC-Davis.
Bob acquired an amazing
perception of the ins and outs
of the budget process. Conse
quently he steered Dennis's
shop through the minefields of
forms and deadlines necessary
to assure our program from
year to year. Further, he and
Dennis always seemed to know
what deal could or would be
cut and so best set strategy for
the next round of budget wars.
Not surprisingly, we did well.
Similarly to Dennis, Jack
White was brought on as a
member of Steve's staff to sift
out what new kinds of prob
lems the EPA would have to
tackle. Originally a Navy pilot,

lack was at the University of
Oklahoma's Science Policy
program carrying out a study
on offshore chilling when the
energy crisis broke in 1974.
What had been a rather ob
scure study packed the halls in
Washington D.C. when he pre
sented it, and gave him a cer
tain notoriety.
Jack's staff began small; it
consisted of me, as a part-time
student assistant. The staff was
filled mainly with temporary
slots and people on detail, as
were much of the agency's
growing offices. Besides mak
ing cutbacks simpler, since
they were outside the Civil Ser
vice system, these hidden posi
tions disguise the extent of ac
tual cuts since they were never
counted among the EPA staff.
