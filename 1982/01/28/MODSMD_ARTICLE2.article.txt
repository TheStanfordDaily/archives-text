# San Jose nurses strike
## Negotiations grind to a halt 
### Karl Schoenberger 
Talks sputtered to a halt last night
in the latest round of negotiations
between striking nurses and
O'Connor Hospital, giving little hope
for a rapid setlement in the labor dis
pute plaguing four San Jose hospitals.
The California Nurses Association
(CNA) first went on strike more than
three weeks ago at O'Connor and
Good Samaritan hospitals, and later
at San Jose and Alexian Brothershos
pitals, after months of unsuccessful
negotiation.
CNA's approach in the bargaining
has centered on the issue of "com
parable worth," and argument for
equality in women's and men's pay
scales that gained wide attention in
the San Jose city employee strike last
summer.
Maxine Jenkins, chief negotiator
for the CNA, said she hopes the strike
will have a "ripple effect," setting a
precedent for other hospitals in the
country. Jenkins said that a con
siderable number of nurses left hos
pital employment last year because
of poor pay and heavy stress at the
workplace.
The San Jose strike came just as
contract negotiations between Stan
ford and the Medical Center's
nurse's association, Committee for
Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment (CRONA), got underway
earlier this month.

Stanford and CRONA have agreed
to issue only joint statements to the
press on the progress of their nego
tiations, and key participants in the
talks were unavailable for comment.
But one source close to the talks said
that "comparitive worth" has not yet
come up as an issue. CRONA's con
tract expires on February 28.
Yesterday's negotiations at the
Sunnyvale Hilton Hotel broke down
when the O'Connor administration
refused to consider CNA's revised
proposal for a 30-month contract
with an immediate 22 percent pay
hike.
O'Connor's last offer, which the
hospital claims is already in effect for
nurses crossing the picket line, gives
nurses an initial 15 to 30 percent pay
raise, depending on seniority.
CNA originally proposed an in
crease of 38 percent, which would
have boosted salaries for many
nurses close to the $30,000-a-year
range.
The strike in San Jose has been
marked by strong rhetoric and
mutual mistrust.
According to a spokesperson for
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB), both parties in the dispute
have filed complaints that the other is
not "bargaining in good faith" and
otherwise engaging in unfair labor
practices.
The O'Connor administration said

that CNA has sent "threatening let
ters" to nurses crossing the picket
lines, and refuses to bargain. Jenkins
accused O'Connor of stalling and
taking funds from other hospitals in
terested in breaking the strike.
"That's a complete lie," said Teddi
Huseini, spokeswoman for the
O'Connor administration. "It's a
good example of the rhetoric that
CNA is using to cloud the issues."
Tensions mounted yesterday asthe
O'Connor administration confirmed
it would carry out an ultimatum is
sued earlier this week threatening to
replace striking nurses who did not
return to work by 5 p.m.
Nurses on the picket line dismissed
the threat, saying the hospital will
never be able to find enough quali
fied nurses in the area to fill their
ranks.
Jillian Leonhardt, a registered
nurse for six years, said the hospital
was extremely short on staff when
the strike began. The intensive care
unit where she works is so under
staffed, she said, that there is a
"potential danger" to patients
"about half the time.
"Nothing has happened in the two
years I've been at O'Connor,"
Leonhardt said. "Burden is placed on
the nurse. You're under stress and
you're not always free to watch the
patient closely."
