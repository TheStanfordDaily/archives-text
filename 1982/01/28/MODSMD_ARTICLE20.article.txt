# Budget cuts may weaken regulatory enforcement
## 
### Gale Warner 
At the same time that new legislation is requiring the Environ
mental Protection Agency (EPA) to expand its workload, the Rea
gan Administration has imposed a substantial cut in its fiscal 1982
budget.
The effect of this action, according to Larry Williams, spokes
man for the Sierra Club in Washington, D.C., will be to "paralyze
the agency — which is largely what the administration has in
mind."
A $1.1 billion 1982 budget was recently approved by Congress,
which compares with $1,356 billion appropriated in 1981. Former
EPA Administrator Douglas Costle had suggested a 1982 budget of
$1.6 billion to allow the agency to shoulder the increased respon
sibility of administering new laws such as the Superfund act, which
passed in 1980 and provides a mechanism for cleaning up hazard
ous waste dumps.
Created in 1970 by an executive order from then-President
Richard Nixon, the EPA is charged with implementing programs
to regulate air, water, and noise pollution, solid waste disposal,
toxic substances, and hazardous waste dumps. The passel of en
vironmental laws passed in the 70s has given the agency plenty to
do.
But the new budget restrictions may leave legislation such as
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Con
trol Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act vir
tually unenforced, according to Williams.
"The Administration realizes that strong public support means
they can't win the fight to weaken the Clean Air Act in Congress,
but they can win it just as effectively by immobilizing the agency
which administers that act," said Williams.
Many changes have already occurred. Last July, in a reorganiza
tion carried out by EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch, the Office
of Enforcement, formerly responsible for seeing that industry
obeyed EPA regulations, was dismantled and its remnants scat
tered to several other offices.
As a result of the 1982 cuts, epidemiological studies to de
termine short-term and chronic effects of suspected pollutants
have been severely crippled or terminated.
Toxic substances programs have been particularly hard hit.
Regulations involving over 15,000 hazardous waste clumps and
the cleanup of an additional 3000 abandoned dumps has been
blocked or delayed, according to Williams. The program for tes
ting the safety of new chemicals before their release on the mar
ket has also been curtailed.
"The Administration is taking away from research-oriented
work at the same time it is urging backing off the implementation
of standards that don't have enough hard research to support
them," said Williams.
However, some EPA officials are downplaying the seriousness
of the budget restrictions. "We are in the process of reorganizing,
but we're essentially going to be covering the same areas as
before," said Joanne Semones, press officer for the EPA's regional
office in San Francisco.
"We are supportive of the administration's goals and Anne
Gorsuch's goals of doing more efficient work, more effectively,
with less resources," said Semones. "It obviously means some
belt-tightening, but we feel it will lead to better management."
