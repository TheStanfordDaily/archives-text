## Loverboy slips on its new polish, Quarterflash glides

Loverboy
Get Lucky
Columbia Records

The apparent rock and roll fi
nesse of Loverboy's debut
album raised hopes of what
they might do with a little more
experience. Since then
guitarist/songwriter Paul.Dean
has said that first record was a
hastily thrown together jumble
of ragged, unfinished songs,
and that their new effort, Get
Lucky, is their first polished,
professional effort. Maybe
spontaneity is what they need
because, no matter how
polished, most of these new
songs could never succeed.
The images here often come
back to that of a masculine fig
urehead. His girl better not
dump him for another or she'll
have to "watch out" for him,
along with his new flame. He
knows about the jungle of the
city streets. When this guy says
"jump," you'd better. . . Well,
you get the idea.
During much of this, one
suspects the band is actually
parodying its subject, that it's
thumbing its collective nose at
rough-dude rock. But that the
ory doesn't hold up for long.
For one, if they're parodying
anyone, they've fallen into the
trap of sounding remarkably
like their subjects. With only
momentary exceptions each
song has the same beat as the
one before. And it's not a very
good beat, rather close to an
African tribal chant. The five
band members seem to have
not one original musician
among them, with songs that

are uniformly heavy-handed
and ponderous.
Now sometimes this type of
song can work very well. It did
for them with last year's singles
"Turn Me Loose" and"The Kid
is Hot Tonite," and it does with
this year's model, "Working
For the Weekend." None of
these songs has any lighter pas
sages or moments that call for
particularly impressive musi
cianship, but each has a driving
melody and a catch of sorts —
this time a stop-start chorus
that cuts away briefly from the
rest of the song.
But when an album never
deviates from that, when each
song is a thudding assault, then
one has to question the band's
talent. From what the\ shovN on
Get Lucky, Loverbov rates
about a three.
They don't redeem them
selves with their lyrics The
satire theory is jettisoned once
they sing, "Help me make it
through the night/E\er\thing s
gonna be all right" and then
follow that with the chorus,
"Take me to the top/Take me
to the top/Take me to the
top/Take me to the top/Take
me to ... " Not the stuff of
which wicked satire is made.
Dean and co-writer (and lead
vocalist) Mike Reno shoot for
social comment with "Gangs in
the Street," where their insight
is that these gangs are out there
. . . looking for us all. They try
an ominous tone here, but
their mood music sounds like,
oh, like an African tribal chant.
Reno is one of those rare vo
calists who has a decent voice
for rock, who sounds good on
his songs, and who really grates
on one's nerves over the
course of an album. After a few

consecutive numbers his stri
dent, whining tone goes
straight from the record to the
base of the listener's skull,
where it rattles around.
Dean tries to break up the
album by singing lead on the
first side's last song, his own*
"Emotional," but he has veryl
little voice to work with. Hel
tries to fiddle around with al
happier beat here as well, but ]
his aggressive singing and the
band's playing make this
"goodtime" number as op
pressive as most of the other
songs.
Loverbov does one ballad,
"When It's Over," but they
don't change much of any
thing. The beat's still the same,
thev just don't play as many in
struments around it. Instead of
belting above his backing mu
sic, here Reno belts pretty
much alone. Still, the little vari
ety it does have, along with the
fact that it follows "Working
tor the Weekend," make
"When It's Over" one of my fa
vorites from the album. Like its
predecessor, taken alone this
song wouldn't sound bad.
At this point though, Get
Lucky begins to take its form,
"jump," a pounding "do what I
say or else" song, sets the un
inspired trend for all that fol
lows.
Interestingly, on stage Lover
boy is a vibrant, playful group
who use theiraudiences well. If
they could retain this attitude
and spirit when they write and
record, obviously they'd be
better off. But if Get Lucky is as
"polished and professional" as
they can be, this might be an
unrealistic hope. The
band members may be as nice
as you'll find, but they don't
seem to be all that talented.

Quarterflash
Geffen Records
At first, Quarterflash looks to
be the second coming of Pat
Benatar — what with their op-

eraticlead vocalist Rindy Ross,
and their "tough girl" anthem
"Harden My Heart." As in
Benatar's band, the lead
guitarist writes the music, and
Ross even looks strikingly like
her more famous counterpart.
But the barely restrained ten
sion of "Harden My Heart"
doesn't break through on the
rest of this debut album, and
they don't follow through with
their Benatarian promise of a
series of ripping, furious rock
declarations. This probably
works in Quarterflash's favor.
For one, their pulled-in style
gives them the opportunity for
variety. Marv Ross is a much
more diverse songwriter than
Benatar's Neil Gerado and Rin
dy Ross is, like Benatar, a tal
ented and passionate singer.
This combination gives Ross
the opportunity to do what
Benatar should have done by
now — sing some ballads. Con
tinually threatening to break
out and rock, Ross' intense,
sensual vocals shape "Love
Should Be So Kind" into an un
usual, gripping song of torn-up
hearts. Her plaintive promise in
"Try to Make it True" is backed

by Marv Ross' dark melody, the
same combination that makes
"Give Me the Right Kind of
Love" so effective.
Ross is among the few vocal
ists around that bring this pas
sion to every song. Even the
best current love songs only
ask that you enjoy them and
sing along, but Ross — and
Benatar — demand more, that
you ache when they ache, that
you feel something when they

sing, that you listen to what
they say. A Linda Ronstadt or a
Carly Simon has the voice to do
this and understand how to
craft a song, but they distance
themselves from their materi
als so often because they lack
this commitment to cut open
their emotions in public.
Ronstadt showed she could do
this with "Hurt So Bad" and Si
mon is continually showing
glimpses of it, but Ross and
Benatar came by it naturally.
Marv Ross' material here
doesn't try to be particularly in
sightful, but it's polished and
interesting. He's undoubtedly
had many years from which to
cull these songs for this first
album, but he shows himself
capable of doing many genres
well, even Benatar's bust-it
loose style. "Find Another
Fool" is angry without being
pretentious. Unlike much of
Benatar's anti-men music, this

is a song strictly about a per
sonal hurt, and so it's not as in
timidating. Musically it's en
gaging, with an unusual rock
violin solo, along with its more
conventional rock sax (played
by Rindi Ross).
Along with this and his
ballads, Marv Ross writes an
old-time girl song ("Valerie"),
an old-time cruising song
("Cruisin' With the Deuce"),
and even some jazz ("Williams
Avenue"). Each is done well,
particularly "Williams Ave
nue," with its subdued, crafted
mood contrasting Rindi Ross'
forceful vocals. Rick
DiGiallonardo's keyboard
playing gives the song its

smooth backing and transi
tions.
Jack Charles also contrasts
Ross' singing, in his case with
lead vocals of his own. His
voice is quavering and
strained, unlike Ross' clean
deep belting. Charles uses sin
cerity to carry him on his own
composition, "Critical Times"
and is particularly good in one
spoken passage. He's less effec
tive on Marv Ross' "Cruisin'
With the Deuce," where he has
to belt lines out, but the song is
distinctively male, so Ross
couldn't have substituted.
Geffen Records has been
publicizing Quarterflash as a
surprise even to the label — an

obscure club band from
Portland whose talent alone
has carried them to the top —
but don't you believe it. Taking
their cue from Warner
Brothers' handling of another
"obscure" newcomer, Christ
opher Cross, Geffen has
backed Quarterflash with
some big-name talent. Eagle
Timothy Schmidt sings, veteran
session player Mike Porcaro
(related to Toto's Steve and Jef
fery) plays, and former Little
River Band producer John
Boylan puts it together.
Boylan's influence stands out
especially, as he's used his tal
ent for harmonies as often as
possible here. His presence
also likely explains the album's
polished sound.
These traits on a debut
album can be a death knell for
a group. A polished start can
hide the lack of a personality
underneath. Bruce Spring-

steen, Bob Dylan, and Tom Pet
ty all sounded awful when they
started out (and still don't
sound so hot), but their strong
characters carried them. While
Quarterflash doesn't have a
songwriter of equal talent, they
do have much more passion
and musical skill than so many
bands. I didn't expect to enjoy
their debut album, but I did,
and I'm waiting to hear their
follow-up.
