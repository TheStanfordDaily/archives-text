# Akiyoshi still good, not as great

Toshiko Akiyoshi Trio
Dinkelspiel Auditorium/Stanford
22 January 1982
Toshiko Akiyoshi has received much
praise over the past decade as one of
the premier composers and group lead
ers in jazz. Her main group, the Toshiko
Akiyoshi/Lew Tabackin Big Band, de
spite having a name that would send
Demosthenes himself searching for
pebbles, has gained both notoriety and
a certain amount of commercial suc
cess.
Unfortunately Akiyoshi'sskillsasa pi
anist have languished behind her skills
as a composer during this period. The
audience who viewed one of her rare
small group performances at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Friday night
caught only glimpses of her once con
siderable talent as an instrumentalist.
In many ways her general lack of ease
with the piano was not surprising. The
difficulties of improvising modern jazz
are consideable, and it is the rare musi
cian who can put away his instrument
for several years or play a different type
of music and then come back to bebop
without losing some of his polish or
confidence. Striking examples are to be
found among those jazz artists who
have gone into fusion and are latersim
ply unable to play more demanding ma

terial with the skill they once had. Any
one who has heard, for example,
Wayne Shorter or Donald Byrd in their
prime knows precisely what I'm talking
about.
Akiyoshi, ironically, has never tried
her hand at fusion. The music her band
has released has been consistently in
novative and generally exciting. Rather,
it has been her involvement with com
posing and group leading, not any at
tempts at popularizing, that has caused
her to neglect the piano.
Undaunted, Toshiko attacked a
challenging set of bebop tunes, and if
one is hesitant to applaud her playing
one must praise her in her role as jazz
educator. Her program was a tribute to
some of the great forgotten masters of
modern jazz. She played Dizzy
Gillespie's "Con Alma," Clifford
Brown's "Minor Mood," J.J. Johnson's
"Lament," Benny Golson's
"Stablemates," and Bud PowellV'Tem
pus Fugit."
Although only one number wascom
posed by Bud Powell, every number
bore his stamp. Early in her pianisticde
velopment Akiyoshi was profoundly in
fluenced by the music of Powell, and to
this day her playing echoes his in many
regards. Her voicings, her rhythmic
placing of chords, her way of using cer
tain chromatic runs, all have their
source in Powell. It is to her credit that
she chose him as her spiritual mentor,

for since his death in 1966 few pianists
have matched Powell's creativity as an
irnproviser or his intensity as a per
former.
Her performance of Powell's "Tern
pus Fugit" was one of the most exciting
moments of the concert. If the tempos
had been flying from her earlier in the
performance, she caught up with them
at this point and played both the
challenging lead line and her solo with
cr spness and ingenuity. It is reassuring
to Know that Powell's legacy lives on in
performances such as this one and
those by other neglected disciples of his
such as Tommy Flanagan, Al Haig (no,
not the secretary of state), Hank Jones,
and, perhaps the most skilled bopper of
the group, Barry Harris. Hearing bebop
played by those who have devoted
years to studying its intricacies is a
pleasure rarely granted to jazz fans on
campus.
Yet during other numbers Akiyoshi's
attractive solos would be marred by her
problems with the tempo, her inability
to achieve a true forte, and her general
lack of ease at the piano. Often it wasn't
so much that she made mistakes, but
that she would pull up in the middle of a
phrase as if she were afraid of making a
mistake. One hopes that several
months of concentrated practice would
take care of these problems, but at pres
ent Akiyoshi is better featured with her
big band, than with a trio.

problems with the tempo, her inability
to achieve a true forte, and her general
lack of ease at the piano. Often it wasn't
so much that she made mistakes, but
that she would pull up in the middle of a
phrase as if she were afraid of making a
mistake. One hopes that several
months of concentrated practice would
take care of these problems, but at pres
ent Akiyoshi is better featured with her
big band, than with a trio.
Toshiko Akiyoshi Trio
Dinkelspiel Auditorium/Stanford
22 January 1982
Toshiko Akiyoshi has received much
praise over the past decade as one of
the premier composers and group lead
ers in jazz. Her main group, the Toshiko
Akiyoshi/Lew Tabackin Big Band, de
spite having a name that would send
Demosthenes himself searching for
pebbles, has gained both notoriety and
a certain amount of commercial suc
cess.
Unfortunately Akiyoshi'sskillsasa pi
anist have languished behind her skills
as a composer during this period. The
audience who viewed one of her rare
small group performances at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Friday night
caught only glimpses of her once con
siderable talent as an instrumentalist.
In many ways her general lack of ease
with the piano was not surprising. The
difficulties of improvising modern jazz
are consideable, and it is the rare musi
cian who can put away his instrument
for several years or play a different type
of music and then come back to bebop
without losing some of his polish or
confidence. Striking examples are to be
found among those jazz artists who
have gone into fusion and are latersim
ply unable to play more demanding ma

terial with the skill they once had. Any
one who has heard, for example,
Wayne Shorter or Donald Byrd in their
prime knows precisely what I'm talking
about.
Akiyoshi, ironically, has never tried
her hand at fusion. The music her band
has released has been consistently in
novative and generally exciting. Rather,
it has been her involvement with com
posing and group leading, not any at
tempts at popularizing, that has caused
her to neglect the piano.
Undaunted, Toshiko attacked a
challenging set of bebop tunes, and if
one is hesitant to applaud her playing
one must praise her in her role as jazz
educator. Her program was a tribute to
some of the great forgotten masters of
modern jazz. She played Dizzy
Gillespie's "Con Alma," Clifford
Brown's "Minor Mood," J.J. Johnson's
"Lament," Benny Golson's
"Stablemates," and Bud PowellV'Tem
pus Fugit."
Although only one number wascom
posed by Bud Powell, every number
bore his stamp. Early in her pianisticde
velopment Akiyoshi was profoundly in
fluenced by the music of Powell, and to
this day her playing echoes his in many
regards. Her voicings, her rhythmic
placing of chords, her way of using cer
tain chromatic runs, all have their
source in Powell. It is to her credit that
she chose him as her spiritual mentor,

for since his death in 1966 few pianists
have matched Powell's creativity as an
irnproviser or his intensity as a per
former.
Her performance of Powell's "Tern
pus Fugit" was one of the most exciting
moments of the concert. If the tempos
had been flying from her earlier in the
performance, she caught up with them
at this point and played both the
challenging lead line and her solo with
cr spness and ingenuity. It is reassuring
to Know that Powell's legacy lives on in
performances such as this one and
those by other neglected disciples of his
such as Tommy Flanagan, Al Haig (no,
not the secretary of state), Hank Jones,
and, perhaps the most skilled bopper of
the group, Barry Harris. Hearing bebop
played by those who have devoted
years to studying its intricacies is a
pleasure rarely granted to jazz fans on
campus.
Yet during other numbers Akiyoshi's
attractive solos would be marred by her
problems with the tempo, her inability
to achieve a true forte, and her general
lack of ease at the piano. Often it wasn't
so much that she made mistakes, but
that she would pull up in the middle of a
phrase as if she were afraid of making a
mistake. One hopes that several
months of concentrated practice would
take care of these problems, but at pres
ent Akiyoshi is better featured with her
big band, than with a trio.
