'On Golden Pond'
It may be a rule of thumb that any movie that starts
with loving shots of the countryside is in deep trouble.
On Golden Pond opens with an impressive glimpse of a
lake at sunset, held approximately 30 seconds too long,
and then we see a pair of loons. This is the kind of movie
in which loons and sunsets are used as emblems of sur
vival and longevity and marital bliss. The two central
characters are Norman Thayer, Jr. (Henry Fonda), a re
tired professor approaching his 80th birthday, and his
wife Ethel (Katharine Hepburn); who is 10 years his jun
ior. He is ornery and foxy; she is affectionate and safe.
The movie takes place at their country cottage, where
they are visited by their daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda),
who is still smarting from a series of childhood conflicts
with her father, though of course they are reconciled by
the end of the picture, when she does a symbolic back
flip into the lake for him and he applauds. Chelsea brings
along her boyfriend Bill (Dabney Coleman, in a beard)
and his unhappy, neglected 13-year-old son Billy (Doug
McKeon), whom they leave with Norman and Ethel for a
month, by the end of which time he has become Nor
man's best buddy and a thoroughly well-adjusted little
boy.
The screenplay for On Golden Pond is credited to
Ernest Thompson — it was based on his hit play — but
anyone who grew up on 1950s TV could have written it.
It's a shameless compendium of all the heart-tugging de
vices that can be crammed into two hours, and the
dialogue is canned inspirational. Ethel calls Norman
"you old poop," and bucks him up with speeches like

this one: "You're my knight in shining armor," "You're
going to get back on that white horse and I'm going to
get behind you and we're going to go, go, go!" I would
have thought that after the disastrous last version of Aun
tie Mame, this kind of Hallmark Greeting Card optimism
would draw belly laughs from moviegoers. But the direc
tor, Mark Rydeil, can be as slick as a snake oil salesman,
and thf> presence of two aging stars, as well as the once
in-a-lifetime casting of Henry and Jane Fonda as father
and daughter, has proven to be an odds-on favorite: au
diences cheer and applaud. I wasn't wild about Chariots
of Fire or Man of Iron, but I didn't cringe when the au
dience clapped at the end of On Golden Pond I felt as
if all of us had been rolled in manure.
Of the actors, only Henry Fonda manages to give any
sort of performance. At first he appears to be mugging,
but eventually we see that it's Norman who is doing this
broad comic turn, and part of our fun in watching him
derives from the kick he gets out of his own dumb tricks.
Fonda's timing is good and he retains his dignity
throughout the picture — no mean feat; he even has a
few affecting moments in which he shows us Norman's
terror of losing his bearings. Hepburn smiles bravely, as
usual, but she has all the most impossible lines. How
much credence can we give to a character whose first
line is, "The loons are welcoming us home," and who,
when her husband has an angina attack, prays, "Dear
God, don't take him now. You don't want him — he's just
an old poop." Then there's Jane Fonda, grabbing her
shoulders and acting with wide, anxious eyes. In in
terviews, Fonda has claimed that her political activity has
deepened her acting; surely she hasn't been watching
her own recent movies. This is her worst performance
yet.
In one scene, Doug McKeon — who looks and sounds
like a male version of Jodie Foster but unfortunately
doesn't act like one — catches a trout named Walter that
Henry Fonda has been chasing for years, and Fonda
makes him throw it back because it's lived so long that it's
earned the right to live longer. Get it? This movie really
stars Walter the Trout and the sunset and Jane Fonda's
back flip and a pair of loons. And after you've heard the
human beings in the film talking long enough, the loons
don't sound so bad. At least they don't call each other
"you old poop."

'Whose Life is
it Anyway?'
My favorite scene in Whose Life Is It Anyway? comes
late in the picture. Ken Harrison (Richard Dreyfuss), a
sculptor who has been left paralyzed from the neck
down by a horrendous car accident, is abducted by his
Rastafarian orderly, John (Thomas Carter) and his stu
dent n urse, Jo (Kaki Hunter), to a basement room where
John's reggae band plays a private concert for Ken and
he is given a considerable amount of ganja to smoke.
Neither John nor Jo is caught, although a night watch
man's entrance breaks up the party, and despite the
combination of the extreme anguish Ken has felt over
the past months and the strength of the drug, he doesn't
even get depressed. It's the most uproariously im
plausible scene in a movie since Jack Lemmon threw a
testimonial dinner for a whore in Tribute.
Writing a play about a quadraplegic fighting for the
right to be allowed to die and calling it Whose Life Is It
Anyway? are two of the worst theatrical ideas I've heard
in years, but Brian Clark's play was a success on Broad
way. It's a terrible piece of writing, though: Ken makes
the kind of self-deprecatory jokes Neil Simon might have
cooked up if he's been handed thisassignment, and after
a while the jokey-cover-up-stiff-upper-lip comedy be
comes intolerable. Reginald Rose, one of the old guard
of TV dramatists (he wrote Twelve Angry Men and many
of The Defenders episodes), collaborated with Clark on
the screenplay, however, and it's softer, more sentimen
tal than the play — it's bad in different ways. The
dialogue now runs to daytime soap opera: JANET ElLBER
(playing Ken's girl friend Pat): Everything we've ever
done together . . . everything you've ever given me is
part of me and I won't give it back. DREYFUSS: Every
time I look at you, I see what I will never do and never be
again.
Except for Ken, the characters might be wearing signs
that read Sexy Woman Doctor (Christine Lahti), Fumbl
ing But Pretty Student Nurse (Hunter), Tough But Com
passionate Head Nurse (Alba Oms), Arrogant But
Brilliant Doctor (John Cassavetes), etc. (Alba Oms, a hef

ty actress whose afro makes her look unfairly unattactive,
actually has to read lines like, "Miss Adler, your job is to
lower the temperature of the patients, not raise the
hopes of the orderlies.") And Ken is probably an un
playable part I didn't see Tom Conti in it on stage, but I
assume that he threw most of the embarrassing jokes
away. Richard Dreyfuss struggles manfully, and some of
his routines are amusing — he even does a perfect Bran
do imitation, but unfortunately it's in a serious moment.
One problem with his performance, aside from the ob
stacles of the role itself, is that Dreyfuss isn't physical
enough in the pre-accident scene and the flashback
dream sequence to convince us that he's really a sculptor
and that the loss of his hands therefore renders life use
less to him. (That flashback scene, in which Ken sculpts
while Pat, his model, dances in the nude, is like the misty
erotica of David Hamilton. It recalls the worst excesses of
director John Badham's last film, Dracula). And Dreyfuss
needs, at this stage in his career, to expand his repertoire
of vocal tricks; he can't hold the screen for two hours on
the same nasal whine he's been using since he played
Duddy Kravitz.
Why.se Life Is It Anyway? has the peculiar distinction of
bringing together 1981 's two most übiquitous support
ing actors, Bob Balaban (Prince of the City, Absence of
Malice) and Kenneth McMillan (Eyewitness, True Con
fessions, Ragtime, Heartbeeps.) I was entertained by
Balaban's impression of a strike force leader in Absence
of Malice, but I wouldn't have confused it with good act
ing; his notion of character detail is to wrap rubber
bands around his hands or, in this case, to stutter — an
odd choice for an actor who's playing a lawyer. (Balaban
doesn't stutter when he pleads Dreyfuss' case, though;
he has a conveniently selective stutter.) He should take
lessons from Kenneth McMillan. Cast in the thankless
role of the judge who appears in the final 20 minutes
of the movie, McMillan actually manages to give an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low-key and even moving
performance. It's a small triumph of talent in a large
wasteland of a movie. There has actually been exciting
work done in recent years by playwrights like David
Rabe, Sam Shepard and John Guare, but only the Brian
Clarks and Ernest Thompsons succeed in getting their
plays filmed. No wonder people think the theater is
dead.
