# A 						Short-circuit in DiMeola's 'electric rendezvous'

### Mark Zeigler 
Al Di Meola
Warfield Theatre
23 January 1982
If you're into one-word de
scriptions, Al Di Meola was
"good" last Saturday at the
Warfield Theater. But with that
single word comesa hint of res
ervation that can only be
lucified in a few hundred
more.
The problems that degraded
what could have been an ex
cellent concert to just a good
one stemmed from the pres
ence, let alone the 1 per
formance, of one musician. But

upon examining a list of Di
Meola's accompanists, one
cannot seem to find a weak
spot; that is, at least not on the
surface.
Such musical demi-gods as
Steve Gadd (drums), Anthony
Jackson (bass), Mingo Lewis
(percussion), and Jan Hammer
(keyboards) combined with
the guitar-playing prowess of
Di Meola should amount to a
concert nothing short of spec
tacular. Right? Wrong. In
crowding the already palm
tree-cluttered Warfield stage
with too much talent, Di Meola
planted the seeds of disaster.
And they nearly blossomed.
Scrutinizing the musicians

even further, one finds
question marks in their past.
Gadd is primarily a studio
drummer and is not a per
manent member of any touring
band; he is a freelance musi
cian and a very prolific one at
that. The perils of age and ex
cess weight are catching up
with Jackson (he sat on a stool
during the entire show) and he
played a six-string bass, some
thing quite new in the music
world. However, both held up
flawlessly to the rigors of a con
cert performance.
Believe it or not, the brick
that crumbled was Jan Ham
mer, the famed keyboardist
who has played with Jeff Beck,

John McLaughlin, and Jour
ney's Neil Schon. Hammer
thoroughly tarnished a fine live
performance by Di Meola in a
way that made Di Meola sound
poor as well. In essence, he
proved to be the guitarist's
Achilles' heel.
Hammer, besides his stints
with Beck, McLaughlin, and
Schnon, has released a few solo
albums, all of which can be
classified as heavy metal trash.
He was nice enough to treat
the packed Warfield crowd to
45 minutes of this completely
worthless "music," if you can
even call it that. Hammer's set
included a version of Hendrix's
"Manic Depression" and I'm
sure Jimi turned in his grave
and threw up. The trio, with a
drummer, a bassist, and Ham
mer playing his famous guitar
foil keyboards, received an un
deserved encore, during which
Hammer further demonstrated
how he performs with an in
tensity that really isn't there.
After a 15-minute break,
Hammer returned to the stage,
this time with a host of much
more talented musicians (i.e.
Gadd, Lewis, Jackson, and Di
Meola). One prayed that he
would be tamed this time
around by Di Meola's
reknowned guitar solos and
Gadd's wicked drum blasts.
Hammer had already had his 45
minutes of spotlight exposure.
Now it was Al's turn, or so I
thought.
Hammer insisted in playing
the melody of particular songs
with Di Meola, which would
have been a nice effect had it
been done accurately. Ham

mer missed note after note and
cue after cue, making both he
and Di Meola look bad, even
awful at times. And these
weren't your subtle, pro
fessional mistakes, but the kind
you kid sister makes at a piano
recital — the kind that every
last popcorn kernel in the con
cert hall heard loud and clear.
Why Hammer doesn't excuse
himself from the stage when it
is Di Meola's turn to solo will
baffle audience across the na
tion.
Nevertheless, on those rare
occasions when Hammer prac
ticed proper etiquette, Di
Meola performed the brilliant
solos featuring the lightning
quick guitar riffs associated
with his name. But more so, Di
Meola showed that another
dimension to his playing in
deed exists. Hs is not only an in
novative guitarist and song
writer with the quickest hands
in the West, but a human being
as well. Di Meola has been
criticized as merely being a ma
chine that manufactures note
after note so fast that they are
barely dicernable to the naked
ear. The perfection and speed
with which he plays might
render him inhuman, but the
emotion he employs certainly
doesn't.
Also proof of Di Meola's hu
manity his two most recent
electric guitar albums, "Splen
dido Hotel," and his 1982 re
lease, "Electric Rendezvous."
Both are far from perfect and
are not even in the same
ballpark with his first three ef
forts.
Usually a concert tour is cen

tered around the promotion of
a new album. But in "Electric
Rendezvous" Di Meola
doesn't have much to pro
mote. Nevertheless, he
opened the show with the LP's
first track, "God Bird Change,"
written by Lewis.
This brings up one of the
main flaws of the album: sim
ply that Di Meola composed
but five of the eight tracks, only
two of which are electric guitar
songs. After the double album,
"Splendido Hotel," released
just over a year ago, the once
great songwriter has appeared
to have dried up. Lewis', Ham
mer's, and Phillipe Saisse's
gallant effort to pick up the
slack only prove that Di
Meola's eerie, ominous, and
intense music can be dupli
cated by none other than the
guitarist himself. Of the three
"foreign" tracks, Lewis' is the
only one that bears even the
slightest resemblance to vin
tage Di Meola, while the other
two don't even belong on the
LP.
Of the first five tunes in the
concert, four were off "Electric
Rendezvous," including the ti
tle cut and "Crusin'," the Ham
mer-composed song about as
original as its title. But once the
promoting was complete, the
band got down to real business
and three of the next for tunes
were from "Elegant Gypsy," his
1977 release which is probably
the best electric guitar LP in the
last half-decade. Near the end
of "Race With the Devil on a
Spanish Highway," perhaps Di
Meola's most famous song, the
group went into a reggae beat,

highlighted by a magnificent
guitar solo.
But as an encore to a climac
tic finish, Di Meola and Co.
played yet another cut off
"Electric Rendezvous," leaving
a sour taste in many a fan's
mouth. Compared to Di
Meola's "old stuff," the new LP
is just not the same. By general
fusion standards, "Electric
Rendezvous" is above average.
But by Di Meola standards, it is
nowhere near being up to par.
Therefore, unless one wishes
to complete his collection of Di
Meola's albums, let this one
R.I.P. on the record store's
racks.
Despite its pitfalls, "Electric
Rendezvous" probably won't
sink Di Meola as has been the
case with other top musicians
who have released poor
albums. But if he wishes to pull
out of his current slump, he
must first make a few changes
on the line-up card.
By touring with such greats,
Di Meola has become more a
member of a group instead of
the group. As talented as his ac
companists are, they have in
fluenced his music in an ad
verse way. With all due respect
to Hammer, the keyboardist
has to leave Di Meola's camp —
they mix about as well as lit
matches and a gas tank.
If he disposes of his "super
group," Di Meola will be able
to take care of all the song
writing chores and return to
usual form, circa 1979. But if he
lets them stick around, the re
sult will be a rendezvous with a
two-word description: the
end.
