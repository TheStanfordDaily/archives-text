States enter White House talks
Washington — President Ronald Reagan made
the long-range plan for sorting out the federal
system the centerpiece of his Tuesday night
State of the Union address.
Spokesmen for state and local officials said
they found enough that was attractive about the
Reagan proposal to enter into the discussions
and negotiations the White House began yes
terday with a meeting of the federalism advisory
committee.
But, in a typical comment, Republican Ver
mont Gov. Richard Snelling, chairman of the
National Governors Association, said the ques
tion whether the states will be strong enough to
take over the responsibilities Reagan wants to
hand them depends on avoiding a repetition of
the "enormous cuts" in federal aid they suf
fered last year.
Reagan, in his speech to Congress and the
country, did not pretend that the federalism
program would reduce the deficit or speed the
end of the recession.
But he asserted that no significant tax changes
or economic policy adjustments were needed
to reduce unemployment or deficts, and spent
most of his time and rhetoric on what he called
"a single, bold stroke" to reduce the role of the
federal government in domestic affairs.
The "bold stroke" he outlined would not be
gin until fiscal 1984 (October 1983) and would
be phased in over the succeeding seven years.
Voting rights stirs controversy
Washington — In a controversial move, At
torney General William French Smith recom
mended yesterday that the expiring Voting
Rights Act be renewed in a way that critics claim
will hamstring progress in bringing minorities
to the ballot box.
Debate over the proposed 10-year extension
of the 1965 law may run intosummer, and could
provide a replay of the dramatic legislative
struggle which led to its enactment. The statute
is scheduled to expire in August.
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Smith's vot
ing-rights position marks the latest in a series ot
Reagan administration decisions which have
caused a"crisis of confidence" among millions
of blacks and other minorities.
Smith accused Kennedy of giving a "political
speech" and releasing a "cloud of rhetoric"
which he said misrepresented the adminis
tration's civil rights record.
"The president does not have a dis
criminatory bone in his body," Smith said.
Regan criticizes the Fed
Washington — The Reagan administration

laid partial blame for the current, deep re
cession on the independent Federal Reserve
yesterday and warned that further "erratic"
control of the money supply could derail its
program for economic recovery.
But Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, the
president's chief spokesman on economic poli
cy said, "The president is not going to call for
(the) resignation" of Paul Volcker, chairman of
the central bank.
"The erratic pattern of money growth that
occurred in 1980 and 1981 . . . contributed to
the onset of the current downturn," Regan told
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Regan added that a "steady monetary policy
is absolutely essential if we are to steady the fi
nancial markets and reduce interest rates. Sta
bility of policy is the key requirement for any
permanent recovery in output and unemploy
ment."
Haig confers with Israelis
Jerusalem — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig initiated a new U.S. push for early and vis
ible progress in the Middle East peace process
in a round of meetings with Israeli leaders here
yesterday, drawing a mixed reaction.
Interior Minister Yosef Burg, Israel's chief ne
gotiator on Palestinian autonomy, told re
porters he was encouraged by some of the ideas
he heard from Haig but not by others.
Diplomats described Haig's offerings as sug
gestions of a general nature rather than formal
or detailed proposals. After a four-hour meet
ing last night with Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, Haig himself termed them "general for
mulas in certain narrow areas."
Israeli army radio said the suggestions dealt
with land and settlement policy as well as the
legislative powers of the proposed self-govern
ing authority for the Palestinians. Official
briefers of the two sides would confirm only
that the scope and authority of the autonomous
council was involved.
There was no expectation that Israel would
immediately agree to Haig's suggestions or that
Egyptian officials would do so when the secre
tary of state travels to Cairo today.
The hope expressed by U.S. officials was rath
er that Haig's ideas would bring about a com
mon concentration on areas where major
progress can be made in weeks to come, dispell
ing concern that the Camp David peace process
is dead except for the physical return of the Si
nai scheduled for midnight April 25.
Laetrile useless against cancer
The final results of a government-sponsored
study indicate that Laetrile is totally ineffective
in stopping cancer, and they raise new ques

tions about the drug's potential toxicity.
So negative are the results, published for the
first time in today's edition of the New England
lournal of Medicine, that the publication's edi
tor commented, "The time has come to close
the books on Laetrile and get on with our efforts
to understand the riddle of cancer and improve
its prevention and treatment."
Since the preliminary results of the Laetrile
trial were first announced last spring, the drug's
advocates have complained that the National
Cancer Institute-sponsored study was set up in
a way guaranteed to discredit LaetrHe.
The complete report, however, is an even
more devastating blow to Laetrile than earlier
results.
Using the same methods applied in testing
any potential cancer drug, scientists at four re
search centers used relatively high doses of the
controversial chemical on 178 patients.
Within three months of starting Laetrile ther
apy, the tumors of 91 percent of the patients
had increased significantly in size.
By five months, half of the patients were
dead.
Only a few — 5 percent — reported relief
from pain and disability after 10 weeks .
Bradley begins campaign
Los Angeles — Los Angeles Mayor Tom Brad
ley embarked on his campaign to become the
nation's first elected black governor yesterday,
pledging to fight crime, improve the economy
and "bring state government under control."
Bradley began his quest for the Democratic
nomination for governor with a hometown 8
a.m. press conference. Then he boarded a
plane and began the traditional statewide route
of California candidates: Sacramento, San Fran
cisco and finally San Diego.
In Los Angeles, a reporter brought up one of
the most intriguing aspects of the Bradley cam
paign when he asked the mayor how he
thought the question of race would affect the
election.
Stocks edge up to 842
New York —Thestock market edged upward
yesterday, showing no strong reaction to Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's State of the Union
message.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
1.15 to 842.66, recovering most of Tuesday's
1.24-point loss.
Today's weather
Rain likely late this morning with partial clear
ing in the afternoon. Mostly fair tonight and
tomorrow. Lows in the upper 30s. To low 40s.
Highs in the 50s. Winds shifting from southerly
to the northwest today.

Diplomats described Haig's offerings as sug
gestions of a general nature rather than formal
or detailed proposals. After a four-hour meet
ing last night with Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, Haig himself termed them "general for
mulas in certain narrow areas."
Israeli army radio said the suggestions dealt
with land and settlement policy as well as the
legislative powers of the proposed self-govern
ing authority for the Palestinians. Official
briefers of the two sides would confirm only
that the scope and authority of the autonomous
council was involved.
There was no expectation that Israel would
immediately agree to Haig's suggestions or that
Egyptian officials would do so when the secre
tary of state travels to Cairo today.
The hope expressed by U.S. officials was rath
er that Haig's ideas would bring about a com
mon concentration on areas where major
progress can be made in weeks to come, dispell
ing concern that the Camp David peace process
is dead except for the physical return of the Si

Laetrile useless against cancer
The final results of a government-sponsored
study indicate that Laetrile is totally ineffective
in stopping cancer, and they raise new ques

tions about the drug's potential toxicity.
So negative are the results, published for the
first time in today's edition of the New England
lournal of Medicine, that the publication's edi
tor commented, "The time has come to close
the books on Laetrile and get on with our efforts
to understand the riddle of cancer and improve
its prevention and treatment."
Since the preliminary results of the Laetrile
trial were first announced last spring, the drug's
advocates have complained that the National
Cancer Institute-sponsored study was set up in
a way guaranteed to discredit LaetrHe.
The complete report, however, is an even
more devastating blow to Laetrile than earlier
results.
Using the same methods applied in testing
any potential cancer drug, scientists at four re
search centers used relatively high doses of the
controversial chemical on 178 patients.
Within three months of starting Laetrile ther
apy, the tumors of 91 percent of the patients
had increased significantly in size.
By five months, half of the patients were
dead.
Only a few — 5 percent — reported relief
from pain and disability after 10 weeks .
Bradley begins campaign
Los Angeles — Los Angeles Mayor Tom Brad
ley embarked on his campaign to become the
nation's first elected black governor yesterday,
pledging to fight crime, improve the economy
and "bring state government under control."
Bradley began his quest for the Democratic
nomination for governor with a hometown 8
a.m. press conference. Then he boarded a
plane and began the traditional statewide route
of California candidates: Sacramento, San Fran
cisco and finally San Diego.
In Los Angeles, a reporter brought up one of
the most intriguing aspects of the Bradley cam
paign when he asked the mayor how he
thought the question of race would affect the
election.

States enter White House talks
Washington — President Ronald Reagan made
the long-range plan for sorting out the federal
system the centerpiece of his Tuesday night
State of the Union address.
Spokesmen for state and local officials said
they found enough that was attractive about the
Reagan proposal to enter into the discussions
and negotiations the White House began yes
terday with a meeting of the federalism advisory
committee.
But, in a typical comment, Republican Ver
mont Gov. Richard Snelling, chairman of the
National Governors Association, said the ques
tion whether the states will be strong enough to
take over the responsibilities Reagan wants to
hand them depends on avoiding a repetition of
the "enormous cuts" in federal aid they suf
fered last year.
Reagan, in his speech to Congress and the
country, did not pretend that the federalism
program would reduce the deficit or speed the
end of the recession.
But he asserted that no significant tax changes
or economic policy adjustments were needed
to reduce unemployment or deficts, and spent
most of his time and rhetoric on what he called
"a single, bold stroke" to reduce the role of the
federal government in domestic affairs.
The "bold stroke" he outlined would not be
gin until fiscal 1984 (October 1983) and would
be phased in over the succeeding seven years.
Voting rights stirs controversy
Washington — In a controversial move, At
torney General William French Smith recom
mended yesterday that the expiring Voting
Rights Act be renewed in a way that critics claim
will hamstring progress in bringing minorities
to the ballot box.
Debate over the proposed 10-year extension
of the 1965 law may run intosummer, and could
provide a replay of the dramatic legislative
struggle which led to its enactment. The statute
is scheduled to expire in August.
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Smith's vot
ing-rights position marks the latest in a series ot
Reagan administration decisions which have
caused a"crisis of confidence" among millions
of blacks and other minorities.
Smith accused Kennedy of giving a "political
speech" and releasing a "cloud of rhetoric"
which he said misrepresented the adminis
tration's civil rights record.
"The president does not have a dis
criminatory bone in his body," Smith said.
Regan criticizes the Fed
Washington — The Reagan administration

laid partial blame for the current, deep re
cession on the independent Federal Reserve
yesterday and warned that further "erratic"
control of the money supply could derail its
program for economic recovery.
But Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, the
president's chief spokesman on economic poli
cy said, "The president is not going to call for
(the) resignation" of Paul Volcker, chairman of
the central bank.
"The erratic pattern of money growth that
occurred in 1980 and 1981 . . . contributed to
the onset of the current downturn," Regan told
the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
Regan added that a "steady monetary policy
is absolutely essential if we are to steady the fi
nancial markets and reduce interest rates. Sta
bility of policy is the key requirement for any
permanent recovery in output and unemploy
ment."
Haig confers with Israelis
