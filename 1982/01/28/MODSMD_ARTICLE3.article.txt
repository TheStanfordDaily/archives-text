The University will consider a
below market rate (BMR) financing
program for up to 20 percent of the
new units at the Stanford West hous
ing site, according to Robin Hamill,
University director of housing pro
grams.
Hamill presented her housing pro
posals Monday at a panel discussion
sponsored by the campus chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity Professors.
"BMR units could be organized as
a limited equity cooperative" she
noted in a report which will be dis
cussed at the Faculty Senate Meeting
on Feb. 4.
She told the University News Ser

residents to enjoy the tax advantages
of ownership while avoiding esca

rate rental units would be made
available as well.
The University's coinvestment
(COIN) and Housing Allowance Pro
grams will continue to help faculty
and staff members finance the
purchase of housing. Hamill said the

COIN program is "the most powerful
tool we have for recruiting."
Other plans the include a 50-unit
"hoptef'to provideshort-term hous
ing for medical patients and their
families and the development of up
to 100 units for hospital staff without
children in close proximity to the
Medical Center.
Hamill also proposed that as exist
ing University rental units become
vacated, they should be filled by
eligible faculty and staff. Discussions
with the leasehold owner of King
scote Gardens, an apartment com
plex adjoining the Faculty Club,
should be pursued, Hamill said,
"with a view toward the University
taking over the balance of the
leasehold."
The report recommends that cur
rent on-campus housing eligibility
criteria be retained in connection
with all campus single-family homes,
the Pearce Mitchell and Peter Coutts
developments and, if available, Oak
Creek.
