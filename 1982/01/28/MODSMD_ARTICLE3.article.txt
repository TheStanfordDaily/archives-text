# University considers reduced housing rate
## 
### Katherine Brown 
The University will consider a
below market rate (BMR) financing
program for up to 20 percent of the
new units at the Stanford West hous
ing site, according to Robin Hamill,
University director of housing pro
grams.
Hamill presented her housing pro
posals Monday at a panel discussion
sponsored by the campus chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity Professors.
"BMR units could be organized as
a limited equity cooperative" she
noted in a report which will be dis
cussed at the Faculty Senate Meeting
on Feb. 4.
She told the University News Ser
vice this arrangement would allow
residents to enjoy the tax advantages
of ownership while avoiding esca
lating interest costs. Below market
rate rental units would be made
available as well.
The University's coinvestment
(COIN) and Housing Allowance Pro
grams will continue to help faculty
and staff members finance the
purchase of housing. Hamill said the

COIN program is "the most powerful
tool we have for recruiting."
Other plans the include a 50-unit
"hoptef'to provideshort-term hous
ing for medical patients and their
families and the development of up
to 100 units for hospital staff without
children in close proximity to the
Medical Center.
Hamill also proposed that as exist
ing University rental units become
vacated, they should be filled by
eligible faculty and staff. Discussions
with the leasehold owner of King
scote Gardens, an apartment com
plex adjoining the Faculty Club,
should be pursued, Hamill said,
"with a view toward the University
taking over the balance of the
leasehold."
The report recommends that cur
rent on-campus housing eligibility
criteria be retained in connection
with all campus single-family homes,
the Pearce Mitchell and Peter Coutts
developments and, if available, Oak
Creek.
"Once Stanford West is de
veloped, all regular members of the
University and Hospital staffs should
be deemed equally eligible for all
units . . . with no distinctions made
among various categories of employ
ees" said Hammill.
The report also supports the study
by the Dean of Student Affairs for
1300 spaces for single and married
graduate students at one or more of
the following locations:
•The corner of Bowdoin St.and
Campus Drive, adjacent to Incre

ment V of Escondido Village;
•The present site of Manzanita
Park, following demolition of the
trailers there; and
'Behind the new 800-unit under
graduate housing complex, next to
Lagunita and toward junipero Serra.
Subsidized housing isan important
consideration for the University in
light of the high housing costs in the
Palo Alto area. A study done last sum
mer by the Palo Alto Housing Corpo

ration indicated that it takes an in
come of 200 percent of the of the lo
cal average income for a four-person
family ($23,800) in order to buy a
home at the then current mortgage
rate of 13 percent.
Hamill said that local banks now al
low as much as 35 to 40 percent of
personal income to be used for mort
gage and direct housing expenses,
such as insurance and taxes. She also
noted that begining with the sales of
Peter Coutts, the University is likely

to move out of first mortgages.
Her report suggests that the Uni
versity "make every effort to arrange
with one or more commercial len
ders for the provision of all mortgage
financing of campus residences, with
the goal of Stanford extricating itself
entirely from making mortgage loans
from University assets."
The program is scheduled to start
this fall and will cost approximately
$2.5 million the first year.

Subsidized housing isan important
consideration for the University in
light of the high housing costs in the
Palo Alto area. A study done last sum
mer by the Palo Alto Housing Corpo

ration indicated that it takes an in
come of 200 percent of the of the lo
cal average income for a four-person
family ($23,800) in order to buy a
home at the then current mortgage
rate of 13 percent.
Hamill said that local banks now al
low as much as 35 to 40 percent of
personal income to be used for mort
gage and direct housing expenses,
such as insurance and taxes. She also
noted that begining with the sales of
Peter Coutts, the University is likely

to move out of first mortgages.
Her report suggests that the Uni
versity "make every effort to arrange
with one or more commercial len
ders for the provision of all mortgage
financing of campus residences, with
the goal of Stanford extricating itself
entirely from making mortgage loans
from University assets."
The program is scheduled to start
this fall and will cost approximately
$2.5 million the first year.
