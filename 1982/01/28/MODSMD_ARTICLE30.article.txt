Happy night
It seems like only yesterday that we
christened Volume 180 with another
infamous happy hour, but now we
will ring out the old volume, ring in
the newand hope that no further ma
terial for staff award ceremonies will
be generated in the meantime. All
staffers should plan to come by the
Daily tonight for the end of the vol
ume happy hour which Uncle Sam
says may go on a tad longer than an
hour. The evening's activities begin
about 7 p.m.. Everyone, especially
newer staffers, is encouraged to

come and help and have fun.
Staff lunch
Been called opinionated lately?
Like the chance to say the same to
others? Well, we've got a wailful of
declarations from folks who admit
that they'd like their opinions publi
cized in the pages of the Daily. Today
we'll be electing three at-large mem
bers to the editorial board and all
staffers and interested parties are
cordially invited to bring a bag lunch
to the office at noon to hear the rea
sons why the folks who want to do it,
want to do it.
