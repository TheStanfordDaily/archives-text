# Overseas Studies Program reviewed
## Committee finds diversities 
### Heather Millar 
The first thorough committee re
view of the Overseas Studies pro
gram in 10 years will begin, following
the announcement recently of an ad
hoc committee appointed by the Of
fice of the Provost.
This is an effort to "take stock of
outstanding matters," according to
Prof. Alex Inkeles, senior fellow in
the Hoover Institution and chairman
of the committee. The present group
will determine to what extent the
Overseas Studies program is meeting
the goals established at its inception,
according to the committee's stat
ment of purpose.
No committee of this kind has in
vestigated the Overseas Studies pro
gram since the Merryman com
mission was appointed by the presi
dent of the University in 1972.
The new committee was formed in
September on the recommendation
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Study and is scheduled to make a re
port to the provost by spring quarter.
However, Inkeles said he is not sure
whether the committee will make
the deadline because of the com
plexity and the volume of informa
tion they have to process.

The committee comprises seven
members of the Academic Coucil,
three staff members, and two stu
dents.
"Most people don't realize how
complex and differentiated the Stan
ford Overseas Program is," said Ink
eles. While most people are aware of
the major compuses in Europe, Ink
eles said, they do not know that the
University also administers pro
grams in Africa and South America.
Inkeles said the committee has
reached no conclusions yet. "We
want to avoid saying the program is
this or that, because it may be this
way on one campus and that way on
another," he said.
But, according to Inkeles, several
fundamental issues have been
raised: Should the overseas cam
puses be accessible to all or an op
portunity limited to an elite, special
ized student body? Should Stanford
students form an enclave in the for
eign environment or be dispersed in
the society? Should the overseas pro
grams emphasize academics or "ex
perience"? How closely should the
overseas studies program be inte
grated with the overall Stanford pro
gram?

"We're still in the information
gathering process," said Noel Kolak,
assistant to the provost and one of
the staff representatives to the com
mittee.
In pursuit of available data, the
committee meets once a week and
has heard presentations by experts
such as Mark Mancall, director of the
Overseas Studies program and David
Rosenhan, professor of law and psy
chology. The committee also plans to
distribute questionnaires to students
and faculty who have studied and
taught at the University's overseas
campuses as well as to those who
have not.
This week, a series of round-table
discussions with students who have
studied at the four largest overseas
campuses — Cliveden, Tours, Flor
ence, and Vienna — have been
scheduled by Tyler Bridges and
Suzanne Smith, student members of
the committee.
Bridges described this as a "very
unscientific and informal" way of
gathering information, but stressed,
"We're really trying to get the them
(faculty and administration) to listen
to the students. The students have a
lot to sav."
