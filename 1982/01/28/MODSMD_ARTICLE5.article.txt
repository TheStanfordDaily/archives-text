Officials at the Childcare Resource Center, which
helps faculty, staff and students to understand and use
childcare services on campus, say inflation and over
crowding are making it increasingly difficult to operate
successfully.
Co-directors Phyllis Craig and Dorothea Almond at
tribute part of the problem to the short supply of schol
arship money far parents who need financial help. A ma
jor function of the Childcare Resource Center is assisting
in raising funds to provide scholarships to the schools
and centers on campus.
Craig and Almond said they are also concerned about
lack of space at most of the programs.
"There's a vast number of possibilities here," said
Craig. "Even so, there's an enormous waiting list for the
centers that cover the the widest age-range — for in
stance, for the Childrens' Center. And for Bing (Nursery
School) they have waiting lists of two years at the mo
ment.
"That doesn't mean that all of those children aren't

anywhere at the moment. They may be in daycare homes
which is why we set up the daycare homes. Or they
may be off the community somewhere. But they still are
on the waiting list."
Added Almond, "We can refer people out if we don't
have space, which happens most of the time. We have
connections with other children facilities in the com
munity. It's often just passing people from one agency to
another, because they don't have space either."
Funding presents difficulties both for the Childcare
1 Resouce Center and for many of the childcare services
on campus which it recommends. "Every program must
support itself," explained Craig.
"They have different ranges for their fees. The Chil
drens' Center, the Escondido Nursery School and the In
fants' Center are co-ops, so that you pay the fee, but you
also put in time," Craig said.
The University supports the Childcare Resorce Cen
ter and provides rent-free accommodation fora majority
of the programs on campus. It may also provide extra

scarce, according to Phyllis Craig and Dorothea Almond, directors of the Childcare Resource Center
here. Most centers maintain waiting lists. Bing Nursery School currently has a two year waiting list.
