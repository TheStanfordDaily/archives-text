# Childcare Center faces hard times

Officials at the Childcare Resource Center, which
helps faculty, staff and students to understand and use
childcare services on campus, say inflation and over
crowding are making it increasingly difficult to operate
successfully.

jor function of the Childcare Resource Center is assisting
in raising funds to provide scholarships to the schools
and centers on campus.
Craig and Almond said they are also concerned about
lack of space at most of the programs.
"There's a vast number of possibilities here," said
Craig. "Even so, there's an enormous waiting list for the
centers that cover the the widest age-range — for in
stance, for the Childrens' Center. And for Bing (Nursery
School) they have waiting lists of two years at the mo
ment.
"That doesn't mean that all of those children aren't

anywhere at the moment. They may be in daycare homes
which is why we set up the daycare homes. Or they
may be off the community somewhere. But they still are
on the waiting list."
Added Almond, "We can refer people out if we don't
have space, which happens most of the time. We have
connections with other children facilities in the com
munity. It's often just passing people from one agency to
another, because they don't have space either."
Funding presents difficulties both for the Childcare
1 Resouce Center and for many of the childcare services
on campus which it recommends. "Every program must
support itself," explained Craig.
"They have different ranges for their fees. The Chil
drens' Center, the Escondido Nursery School and the In
fants' Center are co-ops, so that you pay the fee, but you
also put in time," Craig said.
The University supports the Childcare Resorce Cen
ter and provides rent-free accommodation fora majority
of the programs on campus. It may also provide extra

loans for parents who must meet fees
for childcare.
But the University connection has
its drawbacks. Public funds and state
grants are invariably diverted to cen
ters in low-income areas, and none
of the programs at Stanford receives
public funding.
How does the help given by Stan
ford compare to that given by other
universities'? "Harvard has programs
connected with its business school
and its law school; they assume some
financial responsibility," said
Almond.
"At Yale there is a lot of medical
faculty support," added Craig.
"Bing Nursery School is the official
Stanford University lab school,"
Craig continued. "It has connections
with the psychology department and
the school of education. That's

enough for them, and the faculties
don't need any of the rest of these
centers. They don't participate in any
way."
At least one other on-campus
school is planned for Stanford West,
the new housing complex currently
under construction. This may help
ease overcrowding problems, but
"that will not ease the scholarship
problem; in fact, it will make it
worse," says Craig. "We're trying to
get the centers themselves to be
more active in fundraising, but their
parents don't have all that amount of
time."
Is there any possibility of Stanford
increasing its help to the childcare
programs on campus? Craig thinks
not: "There's a childcare policy at
Stanford. It says, in black and white,
that Stanford cannot directly fund
childcare."

Stanford University lab school,"
Craig continued. "It has connections
with the psychology department and
the school of education. That's

enough for them, and the faculties
don't need any of the rest of these
centers. They don't participate in any
way."
At least one other on-campus
school is planned for Stanford West,
the new housing complex currently
under construction. This may help
ease overcrowding problems, but
"that will not ease the scholarship
problem; in fact, it will make it
worse," says Craig. "We're trying to
get the centers themselves to be
more active in fundraising, but their
parents don't have all that amount of
time."
Is there any possibility of Stanford
increasing its help to the childcare
programs on campus? Craig thinks
not: "There's a childcare policy at
Stanford. It says, in black and white,
that Stanford cannot directly fund
childcare."
