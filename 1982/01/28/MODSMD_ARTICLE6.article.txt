# Stanford Police Department comes of age

### Jeff Sims 
The Stanford Police Department has under
gone major organizational changes during the
last decade — changes which have transformed
the police force here from a loosely coordi
nated group of untrained deputies into an au
tonomous entity.
The transformation was at least partially a re
sult of the student unrest of the Vietnam era, ac
cording to Sgt. Ernie Brooks, a 12-year veteran
in the department.
"Every few nights there would be a dis
turbance of some kind. Groups would get the
students riled up," said Brooks.
"The sheriff's department controlled a lot of
the riots and we assisted. Sometimes if there
were massive groups they would pile the stu
dents up in buses and take them to North Coun
ty Jail."
The campus police at this time were depu
tized by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office
"in a pretty casual way," said Police Chief
Marvin Herrington. "Stanford would send the
people it hired down to the sheriff's office and
they would be deputized." These officers had
little training, Herrington said.
However, the controversy over the student
riots and the recruiting standards of the Univer
sity police led the sheriff's office to rescind the
deputizations around 1969.
Until 1972, the campus police operated
without standards and with lit' ■ effectiveness,
according to Herrington.

"When I came to work here, my first charge
was to found a police department," he said.
Legally, because Stanford is an unin
corporated area, it fell under the jurisdiction of
the sheriff's office, and special deputies were
assigned to the campus. Herrington said this
was a problem because there was no constant
group of officers on campus who had become
familiar with the community and its problems.
"In 1972 we came to the first agreement. We
said we would adhere to the state standards for
minimum training and recruitment and any ad
ditional standards the sheriff's department
would care to have," said Herrington.
"This is a unique setup we have with the sher
iff's department. This is the only place in the
country that has this type of arrangement," said
Herrington.
However, the campus police do not have all
the same powers as regular police. An attorney
general's opinion stated that "full-time, regular
employees of a private employer do not qualify
as 'peace officers'.. . regardless of whether or
not they have been deputized by the county
sheriff."
Thus, University police are classified as re
servo deputies, not regular deputies. Once they
are off duty, or off campus, they lose their po
lice status.
The University police currently have 28 sworn
(deputized) members out of a total staff of 50,
according to Ramona Kelley, police depart
ment business manager. The undeputized of-

ficers give parking tickets and function as night
watchmen, she said.
Brooks said that most of the officers are
young, and many are working in their first job in
law enforcement. The new officers "tend to
move on to other departments," he said.
"Many departments are stealing from each
other," said Del Bandy, a deputy here.
Kelley estimated that the average age among
Stanford police was "in the mid-205," while a
member of the Palo Alto Police Department
said that the average age of her department was
in "the middle 305." She said that almost all of
Palo Alto's police had been with their depart
ment more than two years.
Kelley said that Stanford had six officers who
have been here more than two years, six who
have been here more than five, and four who
have been here more than 10.
Although many of the officers are young and
inexperienced, their training standards and
their department are more structured than they
were a decade ago. "The department is a lot
more complex than it was in those days," said
Brooks.
The campus police was created in 1928.
"There was probably a perceived need forsome
sort of police force at the time, so the University
started one," said Herrington.
In the 19405, the force consisted of 11 men:
one chief, eight patrolmen, and two night
watchmen. The force grew slowly until the re
organization under Herrington took place.

Thus, University police are classified as re
servo deputies, not regular deputies. Once they
are off duty, or off campus, they lose their po
lice status.
The University police currently have 28 sworn
(deputized) members out of a total staff of 50,
according to Ramona Kelley, police depart
ment business manager. The undeputized of-

ficers give parking tickets and function as night
watchmen, she said.
Brooks said that most of the officers are
young, and many are working in their first job in
law enforcement. The new officers "tend to
move on to other departments," he said.
"Many departments are stealing from each
other," said Del Bandy, a deputy here.
Kelley estimated that the average age among
Stanford police was "in the mid-205," while a
member of the Palo Alto Police Department
said that the average age of her department was
in "the middle 305." She said that almost all of
Palo Alto's police had been with their depart
ment more than two years.
Kelley said that Stanford had six officers who
have been here more than two years, six who
have been here more than five, and four who
have been here more than 10.
Although many of the officers are young and
inexperienced, their training standards and
their department are more structured than they
were a decade ago. "The department is a lot
more complex than it was in those days," said
Brooks.
The campus police was created in 1928.
"There was probably a perceived need forsome
sort of police force at the time, so the University
started one," said Herrington.
In the 19405, the force consisted of 11 men:
one chief, eight patrolmen, and two night
watchmen. The force grew slowly until the re
organization under Herrington took place.
The Stanford Police Department has under
gone major organizational changes during the
last decade — changes which have transformed
the police force here from a loosely coordi
nated group of untrained deputies into an au
tonomous entity.
The transformation was at least partially a re
sult of the student unrest of the Vietnam era, ac
cording to Sgt. Ernie Brooks, a 12-year veteran
in the department.
"Every few nights there would be a dis
turbance of some kind. Groups would get the
students riled up," said Brooks.
"The sheriff's department controlled a lot of
the riots and we assisted. Sometimes if there
were massive groups they would pile the stu
dents up in buses and take them to North Coun
ty Jail."
The campus police at this time were depu
tized by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office
"in a pretty casual way," said Police Chief
Marvin Herrington. "Stanford would send the
people it hired down to the sheriff's office and
they would be deputized." These officers had
little training, Herrington said.
However, the controversy over the student
riots and the recruiting standards of the Univer
sity police led the sheriff's office to rescind the
deputizations around 1969.
Until 1972, the campus police operated
without standards and with lit' ■ effectiveness,
according to Herrington.

"When I came to work here, my first charge
was to found a police department," he said.
Legally, because Stanford is an unin
corporated area, it fell under the jurisdiction of
the sheriff's office, and special deputies were
assigned to the campus. Herrington said this
was a problem because there was no constant
group of officers on campus who had become
familiar with the community and its problems.
"In 1972 we came to the first agreement. We
said we would adhere to the state standards for
minimum training and recruitment and any ad
ditional standards the sheriff's department
would care to have," said Herrington.
"This is a unique setup we have with the sher
iff's department. This is the only place in the
country that has this type of arrangement," said
Herrington.
However, the campus police do not have all
the same powers as regular police. An attorney
general's opinion stated that "full-time, regular
employees of a private employer do not qualify
as 'peace officers'.. . regardless of whether or
not they have been deputized by the county
sheriff."
Thus, University police are classified as re
servo deputies, not regular deputies. Once they
are off duty, or off campus, they lose their po
lice status.
