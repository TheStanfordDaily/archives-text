# British unemployment rising

London (AP) â€” British unemployment topped
three million for the first time in history, new fig
ures showed this week, and opposition legisla
tors shouted for the resignation of Prime Min
ister Margaret Thatcher.
"This is the most tragic day in peacetime that
Britain has seen for half a century," said opposi
tion Labour Party employment spokesman Eric
Varley, reacting to announcement of govern
ment figures Showing one in eight of Britain's
24.2 million-strong work force was without a job.
Rate at 12.7 percent
Department of Employment statistics showed
a 12.7 percent unemployment rate as of Jan. 14,
up from last month's 12.2 percent. They said
3,070,621 people were out of work in mid-Janu
ary, a rise of nearly 130,000 over December.
Thatcher struggled to make herself heard in
the House of Commons Tuesday as Labour
members shouted "resign!" labeled her mone
tarist policies "blind dogmatism," and accused
her of wreaking more havoc on the British econ

omy than did Nazi Germany.
Thatcher defended herself by citing the 12
percent drop in inflation from a 20-percent peak
a year after she took office in May 1979.
Will worsen
Employment Secretary Norman Tebbit said
joblessness would get worse, and blamed the
world recession and economic mismanagement
by past governments.
Despite an increase in manufacturing output,
unemployment has more than doubled since
Thatcher came to power, when it stood at five
percent.
Britain's 12.7 percent compares with nine per
cent unemployment for the 10-nation European
Common Market in December, 8.9 percent in
the United States, and 2.2 percent in Japan.
John Grant, of the Social Democratic Party,
said of Thatcher: "She is directly responsible for
a battery of broken promises. There is now only
one honorable remedy. She should resign."
