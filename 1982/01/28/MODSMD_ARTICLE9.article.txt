## Congress to decide on El Salvador aid 
### 
Compiled from Washington Post
sources
This week the Reagan admin
istration must certify to Con
gress that the Salvadoran lead
ership "is achieving substantial
control over all elements of its
own armed forces, so as to
bring to an end the in
discriminate torture and
murder of Salvadoran citizens
by these forces," or risk a cutoff
of aid to El Salvador under con
gressional restrictions.
Massacre reports
However, yesterday's re
ports that the Salvadoran army
in its December offensive
massacred several hundred ci
vilians, including women and
children, puts great moral
pressure on the Congress to
deny aid to the ruling
Salvadorean junta.
Reporters taken by guerrilla
soldiers to speak with the sur
vivors were shown the rubble
of scores of adobe houses said
to be destroyed by govern
ment troops in the now
deserted village community.
Dozens of decomposing bod
ies were still to be seen be
neath the rubble and lying in
nearby fields, despite the
month that had passed since
the incident.
The three survivors said they
escaped, separately, from

troops and hid for several days
until they were found by
guerillas.
One witness, Rufina Amaya,
a 38-year-old housewife, said
that the troops entered the vil
lage one morning and, after
herding the residents into two
separate groups — men

divided from women and chil
dren — took them off and shot
them.
Amaya described the
massacre: "I could hear the
children crying. I heard my
own children. When it was all
over late at night the lieutenant
ordered the soldiers to put a
torch to the corpses. There was
a great fire in the night."
Amaya spoke with what ap
peared to be controlled hyster
ia. During the conversation,
she broke down only when
speaking of what she said were
the deaths of her children. She
said that while her two surviv

ing sons have joined the guer
rillas since the December inci
dent, Mozote was not pre
dominantly pro-guerrilla, al
though it is in the heart of a re
bel zone.
She said the guerrillas had
gone around the villages in ear
ly December warning the pop-

'/ could hear the children crying. I heard
my own children. When it was all over
the lieutenant ordered the soldiers to
put a torch to the corpses/

ernment offensive and instruc
ting civilians to head for towns
and refugee camps outside the
area.
People felt safe
"But because we knew the
army people, we felt safe," she
said. Her husband, who Amaya
said was on very good terms
with the local military, "had a
'military safe' conduct."
In Washington, Salvadoran
Ambassador Ernesto Rivas
Gallont said, "I reject em
phatically that the army of El
Salvador" was engaged in "kill
ing women and children. It is

not within the armed institu
tions' philosophy to act like
that," Rivas said. He acknowl
edged, however, that the
armed forces have been active
in that part of the country, par
ticularly during a Decemberof
fensive against the guerrillas,
but said their actions had "defi
nitely not been against the ci
vilian populations."
Amaya, as well as the two
boys who said they witnessed
their families being killed, em
phasized that the troops ap
peared to be in regular radio
contact with someone.
Lost relatives
A dozen other persons from
the area interviewed by cor
respondents said they had fled
their homes during the De
cember offensive and claimed
to have lost family members in
the military assault.
In the village, the
"muchachos" (boys), as the
guerrillas are called, walked re
porters toward the central
square where the ruins of what
had been a small, whitewashed
church stood. The walls of the
smaller sacristy beside it still
stood. Inside, reporters said
that strench was overpower
ing, and countless bits of bones
— skulls, rib cages, femurs, a
spinal column — poked out of
the rubble.
