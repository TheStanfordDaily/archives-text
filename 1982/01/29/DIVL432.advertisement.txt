r ESTRE LLITA )
RESTAURANT 1
The Stanford Daily says:
1 "La Estrellita features a classic Mexican
menu which includes everything from
!' exciuisite tacos to exotic dishes like chalupas.
The restaurant specializes in five dilfercnt I
kinds ol hurritos. Hiese are not, however, the
average I aco Bell varietx which can fie eaten ,
in four bites. These hurritos arc well over a |
i foot long and a meal by themselves. In i
addition to their famous hurritos, the owner 112
I recommends sui/as, enchiladas made with 1
) chile sauce and covered with guacamole and 112
I sour cream; chimichangas, a flour tortilla 1
i filled with shredded beef and topped with 112
i guacamole and sour cream; and for 1
I vegetarians, one ol their man\ tostadas, all
i served on large platters in very generous 1
I portions guaranteed to satisf\ even big
1 appetites.
1 Ibis restaurant has an informal, relaxed
I 1 atmosphere. Ihe white-walled interior,
candlelit tables and handmade Mexican decor
create the unpretentious ambience found
south of the border. We highl\ recomnied
Estrellita.
