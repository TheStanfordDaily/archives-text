The sports department at
the Stanford Daily wants
you. If there is you
would like to cover or if you
are one of those frustrated
athletes who never made
the varsity, drop on in for
the tri-weekly Mike and Sal
sideshow every Sunday,
Tuesday and Thursday.
Actually, we are ever
present and omniscient.
You can be too.
