# Soviets mourn Suslov's death
## 
### los Angeles Times 
Moscow — Police and in
ternal security troops of the
MVD sealed off a section in
central Moscow yesterday
where Mikhail Suslov lay in
state, as thousands of officially
organized mourners filed past
the casket of the Soviet Union's
chief ideologist.
Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev, whom Suslov
helped install in power nearly
18 years ago, paid his last re
spects yesterday morning,
standing for several minutes
with other Politburo members
and ranking party secretaries in
a guard of honor at Suslov's
bier in the House of Unions.
Suslov was regarded by many
as the second most powerful
man in the Kremlin.
The security cordon around
a 14-block section of the capital
and document checks at every
intersection within the sealed
zone ensured that only persons
with special passes could view
Suslov, who died of a stroke on
Monday at the age of 79.
Lines of official mourners,
dusted with snow and standing
in 26 -degree weather,
stretched seven blocks up
Pushkinskaya Street. Unarmed
soldiers wearing the crimson
shoulder tabs of the MVD

forces, flanked the columns of
mourners at six-foot intervals.
Police turned away a few
Russians who tried to join the
mourners, telling them that
only people with special passes
from their place of work would
be admitted.
Stalin appointee
Suslov, appointed to the
Politburo by Joseph Stalin and
a man who would have had a
major voice in choosing
Brezhnev's successor, lay in
state in the Hall of Columns of
the House of Unions, an
elegant pre-revolutionary
building where both Stalin and
V.I. Lenin lie. A large portrait of
Suslov, edged in black, was
hung on the front of the pale
green building.
At the door, a military officer
wearing a tall fur cap barked
orders to the lines of snow
covered viewers, urging them
to move quickly.
Inside the grand hall, a sym
phony orchestra played funer
al music from a flower-rimmed
dais. Black netting veiled the
chandeliers, darkening the
room except where spotlights
shone on Suslov's bier.
Funeral arrangements for
Suslov have been much more
elaborate than those for Alexei
Kosygin a year ago, even
though the late premier was a

much more popular figure
than Suslov, who played a role
in Stalin's reign of terror in the
1930s and 19405.
Kosygin lay in state some dis
tance from the city center in
the much more modest Central
Army Hall and rated a small en
semble for funeral music, not a
symphony orchestra.
An elaborate state funeral is
planned for Suslov today in
Red Square. Unlike Kosygin,
who was cremated and in
terred in the Kremlin wall, Sus
lov, according to semi-official
Soviet sources, will be buried
in a small plot behind Lenin's
mausoleum on Red Square, a
place of greater honor.
Suslov wasa widower, but lit
tle is known about hissurviving
relatives. About a dozen mostly
elderly persons, apparently
friends and relatives, sat in a
section of straight-backed
chairs near Suslov's bier.
Suslov's numerous state
medals were displayed on
scarlet pillows, and dozens of
large flowered wreaths lined
the room. Many came from the
cultural and scientific institu
tions over which Suslov held
political sway for more than 30
years. One large wreath came
from the KGB intelligence and
security agency.

medals were displayed on
scarlet pillows, and dozens of
large flowered wreaths lined
the room. Many came from the
cultural and scientific institu
tions over which Suslov held
political sway for more than 30
years. One large wreath came
from the KGB intelligence and
security agency.
