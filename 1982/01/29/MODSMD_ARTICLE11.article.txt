# Perilous 1982 political road challenges Schmidt
## 
### Washington Post 
Bonn — Tensions between East and West, a slump
ins economy, political party squabbles, and a dis
turbed nation — alladduptomakel9B2atestyearfor
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
Some hurdles ahead for the chancellor are clearly
marked: the national congressof his Social Democrat
ic Party in April and four regional elections spaced
from March to October. If Schmidt and his govern
ment coalition can survive these and any un
foreseeable challenges, experts here say that all the
talk about the Bonn government unravelling may be
successfully put to rest until the scheduled general
elections in 1984.
However, the 12-year-old partnership between
Schmidt's Social Democrats and the Free Democrats
spent an enormous amount of political energy last
year just keeping itself together.
Many of the factors that caused the strain remain —
including left-wing challenges in both governing
parties to Bonn's support for new U.S. European
based nuclear missiles, contention between the

parties on how to manage a rising unemployment
level and general distress about what to do about the
neutralist drift and protest behavior here, particularly
ainong the youth.
For the moment, the Social Democrats and Free
Democrats appear to be getting along more harmo
niously — less out of any new-found affinity than out
of heightened nervousness in the face of more threat
ening developments.
On the foreign front, the Polish crisis has brought
Bonn's detente policy into sharp question in the
West, encouraging the coalition parties here to reaf
firm the bonds between them that made the
launching of West Germany's "Ostpolitik," or policy
to develop better ties with Eastern Europe, possible in
the late 19605.
On the domestic front, an unemployment level that
is threatening to top two million as a result of a re
cession also seems to have nudged the Free Demo
crats closer to their senior coalition partner. The So
cial Democrats, have been pressing for a program to
create jobs, and government spokesmen have in

dicated that some kind of employment scheme can
be expected soon.
The conservative opposition Christian Democratic
Union, with its new tougher line on detente, appears
to have given up hope of wooing the Free Democrats
into a new, more moderate coalition.
But still far from ruled out is the chance that internal
party squabbling will bring down the Social Demo
crats' government.
Party members generally fall into one of two
schools on plotting a strategy for the 1980s. One
school, led by the Social Democratic chairman,
former chancellor Willy Brandt, wants to adjust party
policy to accommodate the idealism and leftist views
of younger members.
The other school, led by Schmidt, would continue
to tailor policy to the moderate, pragmatic views of
the party's traditional, trade-union-based member
ship.
The opposition Christian Democratic Party con
tinues to score over 50 percent in popularity polls, the
Social Democrats scoring about 32 perepnf.
