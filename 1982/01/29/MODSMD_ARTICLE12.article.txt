## Sex role differences: roots go back to childhood 
### Katrina Visser 
The relationship between "femaleness"
and "femininity" was one of many topics
addressed by Stanford Psychology Prof.
Eleanor Maccoby Wednesday at the third
of the Center for Research on Women
(CROW)-sponsored Jing Lyman Lecture
Series. Maccoby's talk focused on "The
Emergence of Femininity During Child
hood."
The lecture began with a series of slides
portraying the lives of men and women in
Kenya which showed differences in the
degree of physical activity required in their
daily routines. Women were hauling wood
and working in the fields while men stayed
in groups, conversing and relaxing.
Maccoby followed these slides with
some of American families — while men
sat in offices or relaxed at home, women
did housework, gardening and shopping.
Maccoby pointed out that "adult occupa
tions don't follow the lines of biological
distinction," contradicting the traditional
concept of female passivity.
Maccoby then showed a number of
magazine ads portraying women. Two
dominant themes emerged: sexuality and
nurturance. Often, according to Maccoby,
"the picture of femininity has to do with
having won in the gameof gettinga male."
Sexuality becomes a commodity in the
bargaining, and richer and more powerful
men imply a more successful victory, she
said.

'Masculinity and
femininity develop as
characteristics of the
social group of the child.'
When children of
different sexes were put
together to play,
there was spontaneous
sexual separation in
children as young as two
years and nine months.

The second theme, nurturance, involves
portraying women in tender relationships
with their children, according to Maccoby.
But theother important aspectsof mother
hood — "organizing one's own and one's
children's lives, discipline, refusing re
quests,. teaching . . . the assertive skill"; of
motherhood" — are not included in the
popular concept of femininity, she said.
Where do these adult roles and con
cepts come from? Maccoby cited child

hood as the key stage. Her work at Stan
ford has involved watching children's be
havior at different ages, particularly in
comparing the interaction of same-aged
children of different sexes.
One of her studies involved groups of
three same-sex children, all four or five
years of age, together in a playroom with a
trampoline, beach ball and 8080 clown.
Two distinctions dominated the com
parison of boys' and girls' behavior, ac
cording to Maccoby: the boys rough
housed and wrestled together at a much
higher level, while the girls played in or
derly, rule-oriented games, often arguing
about rules and turns. The basic activity
level was equal for both groups, she said.
According to Maccoby, these distinc
tions became the criteria for defining the
groups, but she stressed that in each case it
was a minority in a group which behaved
in accordance with the criteria. "The defi
nitions of masculinity and femininity get
named for the more extreme group in
either sex, despite the fact that the majori
ty of girls did not make extensive rules and
the majority of boys did not roughhouse at
a high level," she said.
Maccoby said she considers "sexual
separation throughout childhood" to be
the most powerful aspect of the process of
sexual differentiation. "Masculinityand
femininity develop as characteristics of the
social group of the child," she said.
When children of different sexes were
put together to play, there was spontane
ous sexual separation in children as young
as two years and nine months, according to
Maccoby. The girls adopted passive pos
tures, withdrawing from play by either
watching the boy's activities or turning to
their mothers, she said. Maccoby ex
plained this tendency to occur in almost
every culture except for polygamous,
communal child-raising situations.
The "invisible lines" between boys' and
girls' playgroups are well established by
the first grade, said Maccoby, as she com
pared the nature of mid-childhood play
styles. Boys' play is more competitive and
dominance-oriented, with lots of mock
fighting and bickering. Girls' games occur
in smaller groups, with greater emphasis
on rules and cooperation.
An interesting finding Maccoby pointed
to was that girls' games often end when
there is disagreement about the rules,
whereas boys will often continue the game
and work through their bickering.
Maccoby's observations of a sixth-grade
classroom demonstrated the extent of this
early pattern of separation. Boys and girls
ate in distinct groups during lunch. When
asked why, one boy responded, "so they
can talk. Boys talk about sports and stuff,

girls talk about whatever they talk about."
Maccoby found students strongly resisted
attempts by their teacher to integrate them
for small group projects. There was also
fear that one would be condemned by
same-sex peers for crossing over the in
visible lines, Maccoby said.
Quoting from In a Different Voice, a
forthcoming book by Harvard's Carol
Gilligan, Maccoby illustrated the different
themes which emerge out of what chil
dren say about themselves at different

After age 12, a girl's self
image ... shifts from
maintaining friendships
with other girls to'the
desire to be attractive to
boys/

ages, particularly with respect to their per
ceptions of relationships. Girls are "more
altruistic, empathic and cooperative, with
a greater sense of confidence and com
petence." Boys tend to be much more vul
nerable in middle childhood, responding
with greater behavioral and emotional dis
turbance to such events as a divorce or
death in the family, she said.
After age 12, however, the pattern
changes. Boys grow in confidence and
ability, whereas girls become more vulner
able to self-doubt, anxiety and depression.
According to Maccoby, this shift in a girl's
self-image and behavior is related to the
breakdown of her network of female rela
tionships with the "dawning of sexuality."
The focus shifts from maintaining friend
ships with other girls to the "desire to be
attractive to boys," she said.
Until adolescence, boys and girls have
lived in two separate cultures, and during
the interaction of these cultures girls are at
a disadvantage, according to Maccoby.
Maccoby gave five possible social reac
tions that might ease this unbalanced situ
ation: total sexual separation, including
separate childhoods and exclusively same
sex adult relationships; modified separa
tion, which involves a heterosexual rela
tionship but separates all other life ac
tivities by sex; letting all sexual encounters
be casual and thereby diminishing the im
portance of sexual relationships; teaching
women to be more like men; or teaching
men to be more like women.
Regardless of which reaction society
may take, Maccoby stressed the im
portance of young women being allowed
to act according to their values, rather than
being victims of conditioned sexual ex
ploitation.
