## Editor's viewpoint Old editors never die... 
### 
Half a year later, still just 21 years of age, I've
reached mandatory retirement. As I prepare to
leave my position as editor of Volume 180 of The
Stanford Daily, and to make way for my
successor Joan O'Connell, I wanted to use this
column not so much to comment on the state of
the Daily — I've tried to do that for you as I went
along in this job — but to extend some personal
thanks.
Partly, I refrain here from commenting at
length because the state of the Daily, in many
ways, is best judged by members of the Stanford
community who either read it or do not; enjoy it
or do not; trust it or do not; and, finally, support
it or do not. The people whose names you see in
a staff box at the bottom of this page — and
many others who do not appear there — have
worked hard all fall for the affirmative in all four
cases.
Where we have failed, I'm sorry. College
newspapers such as ours are in a unique position
because they are both business enterprises with
a serious responsibility to the reading public at
the same time that they are educational
organizations open to newcomers. As much as
we strive for quality, it will be be a sad day that
the Daily ever decides, in the pursuit of
professionalism, to sacrifice its educational
mission.
As I leave my position — and I doso with some
sadness for this has been one of the most
rewarding experiences of my life — I feel that I
leave it in handsat least as capable as my own.
Joan, and incoming managing editors Julie
Kaufmann and Richard Klingler, have been
working through the fall volume for the same
goals that I have, and I know that they will not let
up their efforts through the spring.
When I sat down tocontemplate who I really
had to thank for helping me through this

enterprise, I came up with a list much too long
for publication here. It includes my parents, a
high school journalism teacher friends from
Massachusetts, friends from here, and italso
includes a few serene spots on campus and the
graveyard shift waitress at Luv's Menlo House. It
includes everybody listed in the staff box and
many others.
There are just a few people, though, who I
would like to thank in print. Certainly VicGoetz,
the managing editor of Volume 180, as well as
Joan, Richard, Julie and business manager Andy
Preston. I'm also grateful to two former editors,
Sara Lessleyand Ron Lillejord, for
encouragement both by example and, in Ron's
case, by written empathy from China this fall. I
appreciate the extra effort that was made by a
few who, in addition to those above, I always
knew I could count on to go far beyond the
normal dutiesof their job — I thank Mike Hale,
Doug Jehl, Monika Guttmanand JaeSo. And
there is no way that I could leave out those in the
ASSU Typesetting Shop (Laurie would type this
in anyway) who have made producing the paper
a joy — Thanks, Mary Spop, Laurie Capriotti and
Bev Hendricks.
Finally, thank you, Lisa. My gratitude to you is
nearly inexpressible, because if the editor is
supposed to set direction for the paper,
somebody winds upsettingdirection forthe
editor, and most of the time that task fell to you.
Thank you.
And to all of you, again, thank you.
