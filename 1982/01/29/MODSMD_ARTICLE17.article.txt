## The
						80s: 'Light at end of the tunnel' hit liberals head on 
### 
In the early 70s, when I was just be
coming politically aware, the op
timism of the 60s was still alive and
well. There was an intangible elec
tricity in the atmosphere, a feeling
that some great social reform was in
evitable. It was an exciting time to be
alive. If wishful thinking had the
power to shape worldly events, per
haps that change would have come
about. But it didn't happen.
Instead, it turned out that the light
at the end of the tunnel was a train
headed directly at us. The 60s were
followed by the 70s, a time when per
sonal interests precluded political
awareness. Then came the 80s.
„ The 80s seem to be dedicated to
wiping out the gains of the 60s. The
changes which seemed so per
manent back then, the issues which
seemed settled once and for all, are
now the subject of a fierce attack. For
those of us who can't quite lay claim
to the 60s, yet are too old to identify
with the new Protestant ethic of the
80s, there is an uncomfortable feel
ing that we have been here before.
These are hard times for liberals.
It isn't just the methods of the past
which have come under attack. Sur
prisingly, even the goals of the past
are being questioned. Peace, protec
tion of the environment, racial equal
ity, zero population growth, science:
the desirability of these concepts did

not seem arguable. The worst thing
that used to be said about the pro
testers of the 60s was that there
motives were good, but their meth
ods were abhorrent or naive. Now,
many see them as misguided as well.
Somehow we have gone from rally
ing cries like "Give Peace A Chance"
and "Give Earth A Chance" to some
thing like "Give the Private Sector A
Chance (and everything else will
trickle down)." Give me a break.
I grewupamidsttherhetoricofthe
Cold War. We had civil defense.drills
in school, where everyone would be
herded into the hallways and made
to sit in a survival position (legs
folded underneath, back bent so that
head was in lap, arms folded over
head for protection) for what
seemed like hours at a time. En
cyclopedias advised staying indoors
after the attack while decontamina
tion crews swept away the fall-out.
The Emergency Broadcast System
was often tested.
As time passed, these measures
began to seem silly in light of the
great destructive power of a single
nuclear device. By the end of the 60s,
it was generally accepted that nucle
ar warfare was not a viable alter
native. The goal became disarma
ment, not victory.
Suddenly, there once again is talk
of "winning" a nuclear war. The gov

ernment has resumed printing plans
for bomb shelters, and the arms race
is once again speeding along at a
merry clip. This has caught me and
many others by surprise. We never
though that anyone in government
would ever again have the gall to
claim that we could still win a nuclear
war. Yet this is now happening with
alarming regularity.
Similarly, by the end of the Viet
nam War, even the politicians who
supported continuing the war gener
ally agreed that it was a fight we
should not have entered. Richard
Nixon even acknowledged as much,

while he consistently held out for
"Peace with Honor." Yet Reagan
consistently refers to Vietnam as a
"just" war — one which we should
have won. What's going on here? Not
only can he make such statements,
but he can make them with impunity,
fearing no public outcry.
The above examples, coupled with
Secretary of the Interior James Watt's
decimation of the environment, the
Moral Majority's censoring of the
media, and the recent attempt to
brand creationism as science, make
one wonder if the 60s ever existed.
No social change is so great that it

cannot be undone once initiated.
The lesson which the protesters of
the6osare nowlearningthehard way
is that activism should not be a goal
oriented process. Once a goal is ac
complished, you cannot simply fold
up your tent and walk away. Instead,
constant vigilance is necessary to
ensure that your plan is implemented
properly, for dreams can be so
warped by reality that their shape be
comes unrecognizable.
This means that activism is a great
deal more difficult task than is gener
ally assumed. It is easy to maintain a
high level of enthusiasm for a short

period of time, but it is extremely dif
ficult to hold onto a moderate level
of enthusiasm for a long period of
time.
This same factor will eventually dis
sipate the momentum which "the
new insensitiviry" currently en/oys.
Besides, sometimes \ess is merely
less. We can only hope that the new
breed of liberals that replaces them
will have more staying power than
their predecessors.
