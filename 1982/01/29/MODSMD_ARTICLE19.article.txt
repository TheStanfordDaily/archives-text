## Assessments fund worthwhile organizations 
### 
The recent spate of letters criticiz
ing the fee assessment system repre
sent valuable student viewpoints.
But, as such, they are a bit myopic.
These letters tend to present argu
ments from the individual's per
spective, while ignoring the good of
the student body as a whole.
First of all, we have a mechanism to
select fee assessments in which ev
eryone's opinions can be repre
sented. Only those students who
care enough to vote, however, can
be represented. This vote is not a
simple majority, either, but a vote
bsed upon a quorum — a certain per
centage of the student body must
vote for the election to count.
This election is no blind rubber
stamp of ASSU recommendations.
The ASSU printed a pamphlet sum
marizing the needs and functions of
each of the organizations seeking a
fee assessment. The Daily printed its
own fee assessment recommenda
tions as well. Assuming the students
read this material, we are dealing
with an informed public.
The fee assessments fund worth
while organizations that provide
much-needed services for the Stan
ford community. These organizatins
depend, for the most part, on fee
assessments to fund their activities.
They structure their budgets in antic
ipation of this income.
Ultimately, the problem can be
seen as a "free-loader" problem.
Most organizations provide "collec
tive goods" that are available to any
member of the Stanford population.
They provide these services at no
charge, except the $1 fee assessment.
Think about that. If you attended all
of the lectures presented by the
Speaker's Bureau in just one quarter,
you would be paying 16 cents for
each world-famous speaker. It is too
easy to pass this cost off on someone
else — "If I don't pay the dollar,
someone else will."
The services and events provided
by the publicly funded organizations
are available to us all, at little or no
cost. We believe this availability is
worth paying for. If an organization is
worth your vote, it is worth your
dollar.

On Tuesday night, I wenttothe de
bate between Phyllis Schlafly and
Catherine MacKinnon on "Women:
Their Roles Today and in the Future."
The two views of women displayed
controversy that is rarely seen on this
campus. Before the moderator in
troduced the two women, she ac
knowledged the controversy and re
marked that such controversy is wel
comed in the Stanford community,
because of its "open atmosphere."
She stated this proudly, and the au
dience took pride in being an "open
audience," applauding loudly after
the statement.
As this thought lingered in the
minds of the audience, Phyllis Schlaf
ly came to the podium, and was re
ceived warmly. As soon as she began
to speak, however, many in the au
dience forgot that it was an "open
minded" audience, and Schlafly was
frequently forced to raise her voice
over cries of disbelief, laughter, and
most often, the ridiculous and annoy
ing "Stanford Hiss."
When MacKinnon spoke, the ma
jority of the audience was so wildly
enthusiastic about what she had to
say that she was forced to stop and
wait for cheers and applause to sub
side before she could return to her
speech.
The majority of the "open" au
dience was not open at all. These
people went to the debate not to lis
ten to both sides of the issue and at
tempt to learn from it, but rather to
hear only what they wanted to hear,
and heckle all that they did not. I
wonder why these people go to con
troversial debates at all. They have
their mind set, and refuse to allow
themselves to learn from such an ex
perience. Maybe they want only to
convince themselves that they are
"strong" enough to block out opin
ions not coinciding with their own. If
these people need that kind of an
ego boost, I encourage them to at
tend as many debates as possible,

then see a psychiatrist. If they do not
need an ego boost, they should try to
listen objectively to both sides of an
issue. Openness is a very desirable
quality.

Insensitive groups
I believe the large number of stu
dents waiting in line to receive their
ASSU fee assessments demonstrates
that many students feel they are not
being served by the plethora of in
terest groups and other organiza
tions seeking financial support. The
Daily editorial "Refunds: Think First"
(Daily, Jan. 22) seems to be a typical
response of an organization losing
money because of a problem of rep
resentatives approving programs that
many of their constituents do not
support.
The Da//yeditorial board questions
the practice of allowingstudents who
did not vote against the assessments
to claim refunds, when I (and many,
many others) purposely did not vote
in the elections, knowing that this
was the most effective form of pro
test. The editorial also states that stu
dents who indiscriminately take back
their money are turning the fee re
fund system into a farce, and suggests
that a mandatory assessment is rea
sonable "in the interest of the com
munity's common good."
I become cynical and disillusioned
when I think of how interest groups
avoid the trouble of getting direct
student approval for a fee
assessment. As Jim McGrath, ASSU
Senate Rules Committee chairman is
quoted in the Daily, "Would you go
out and try to organize a petition
drive (to get a fee assessment on the
ballot) when you could sit down with
(ASSU senator) Mark Epstein for two
hours and work it all out?"
In my opinion, the fee refund sys
tem is not a farce; the farce is the fee
assessment system that permitted the
taking of a fairly large sum of money
by interest groups apparently in
sensitive to the feelings of many stu
dents. Making fee assessments man
datory for "the common good" will
only increase feelings of cynicism,

disillusionment and alienation of stu
dents from their representatives. The
solution to the problem is for the fee
assessment approval process to be
sensitive to the desires of the stu
dents.

Infantile reactions
We are writing to say how embar
rassed and ashamed we are, as ardent
feminists, to share the title of feminist
with much of the crowd at the Schlaf
ly/MacKinnon debate on Jan. 26.
One of the most important freedoms
that women deserve is the freedom
to choose their lifestyle and their
opinions without harassment from
others. In an extreme case, this trans
lates into freedom from sexual
harassment; in the less severe case, it
means the right that Schlafly has to
make of her life whatever she
chooses, and to express that choice
without the infantile reactions of
booing and hissing that emanated
from much of the crowd
We, of course, agreed with
MacKinnon, on the whole, rather
than Schlafly. Apparently, we are
only two of a small group of feminists
present at the debate who feel secure
enough in our own beliefs to allow
someone else to express theirs with
the respect that the speaker, as a fel
low woman, deserves.

She stated this proudly, and the au
dience took pride in being an "open
audience," applauding loudly after
the statement.
As this thought lingered in the
minds of the audience, Phyllis Schlaf
ly came to the podium, and was re
ceived warmly. As soon as she began
to speak, however, many in the au
dience forgot that it was an "open
minded" audience, and Schlafly was
frequently forced to raise her voice
over cries of disbelief, laughter, and
most often, the ridiculous and annoy
ing "Stanford Hiss."
When MacKinnon spoke, the ma
jority of the audience was so wildly
enthusiastic about what she had to
say that she was forced to stop and
wait for cheers and applause to sub
side before she could return to her
speech.
The majority of the "open" au
dience was not open at all. These
people went to the debate not to lis
ten to both sides of the issue and at
tempt to learn from it, but rather to
hear only what they wanted to hear,
and heckle all that they did not. I
wonder why these people go to con
troversial debates at all. They have
their mind set, and refuse to allow
themselves to learn from such an ex
perience. Maybe they want only to
convince themselves that they are
"strong" enough to block out opin
ions not coinciding with their own. If
these people need that kind of an
ego boost, I encourage them to at
tend as many debates as possible,

then see a psychiatrist. If they do not

listen objectively to both sides of an

I believe the large number of stu
dents waiting in line to receive their
ASSU fee assessments demonstrates
that many students feel they are not
being served by the plethora of in
terest groups and other organiza
tions seeking financial support. The
Daily editorial "Refunds: Think First"
(Daily, Jan. 22) seems to be a typical
response of an organization losing
money because of a problem of rep
resentatives approving programs that
many of their constituents do not
support.
The Da//yeditorial board questions
the practice of allowingstudents who
did not vote against the assessments
to claim refunds, when I (and many,
many others) purposely did not vote
in the elections, knowing that this
was the most effective form of pro
test. The editorial also states that stu
dents who indiscriminately take back
their money are turning the fee re
fund system into a farce, and suggests
that a mandatory assessment is rea
sonable "in the interest of the com
munity's common good."
I become cynical and disillusioned
when I think of how interest groups
avoid the trouble of getting direct
student approval for a fee
assessment. As Jim McGrath, ASSU
Senate Rules Committee chairman is
quoted in the Daily, "Would you go
out and try to organize a petition
drive (to get a fee assessment on the
ballot) when you could sit down with
(ASSU senator) Mark Epstein for two
hours and work it all out?"
In my opinion, the fee refund sys
tem is not a farce; the farce is the fee
assessment system that permitted the
taking of a fairly large sum of money
by interest groups apparently in
sensitive to the feelings of many stu
dents. Making fee assessments man
datory for "the common good" will
only increase feelings of cynicism,

disillusionment and alienation of stu
dents from their representatives. The
solution to the problem is for the fee
assessment approval process to be
sensitive to the desires of the stu
dents.

Infantile reactions
We are writing to say how embar
rassed and ashamed we are, as ardent
feminists, to share the title of feminist
with much of the crowd at the Schlaf
ly/MacKinnon debate on Jan. 26.
One of the most important freedoms
that women deserve is the freedom
to choose their lifestyle and their
opinions without harassment from
others. In an extreme case, this trans
lates into freedom from sexual
harassment; in the less severe case, it
means the right that Schlafly has to
make of her life whatever she
chooses, and to express that choice
without the infantile reactions of
booing and hissing that emanated
from much of the crowd
We, of course, agreed with
MacKinnon, on the whole, rather
than Schlafly. Apparently, we are
only two of a small group of feminists
present at the debate who feel secure
enough in our own beliefs to allow
someone else to express theirs with
the respect that the speaker, as a fel
low woman, deserves.

The recent spate of letters criticiz
ing the fee assessment system repre
sent valuable student viewpoints.
But, as such, they are a bit myopic.
These letters tend to present argu
ments from the individual's per
spective, while ignoring the good of
the student body as a whole.
First of all, we have a mechanism to
select fee assessments in which ev
eryone's opinions can be repre
sented. Only those students who
care enough to vote, however, can
be represented. This vote is not a
simple majority, either, but a vote
bsed upon a quorum — a certain per
centage of the student body must
vote for the election to count.
This election is no blind rubber
stamp of ASSU recommendations.
The ASSU printed a pamphlet sum
marizing the needs and functions of
each of the organizations seeking a
fee assessment. The Daily printed its
own fee assessment recommenda
tions as well. Assuming the students
read this material, we are dealing
with an informed public.
The fee assessments fund worth
while organizations that provide
much-needed services for the Stan
ford community. These organizatins
depend, for the most part, on fee
assessments to fund their activities.
They structure their budgets in antic
ipation of this income.
Ultimately, the problem can be
seen as a "free-loader" problem.
Most organizations provide "collec
tive goods" that are available to any
member of the Stanford population.
They provide these services at no
charge, except the $1 fee assessment.
Think about that. If you attended all
of the lectures presented by the
Speaker's Bureau in just one quarter,
you would be paying 16 cents for
each world-famous speaker. It is too
easy to pass this cost off on someone
else — "If I don't pay the dollar,
someone else will."
The services and events provided
by the publicly funded organizations
are available to us all, at little or no
cost. We believe this availability is
worth paying for. If an organization is
worth your vote, it is worth your
dollar.

fund system into a farce, and suggests
that a mandatory assessment is rea
sonable "in the interest of the com
munity's common good."
I become cynical and disillusioned
when I think of how interest groups
avoid the trouble of getting direct
student approval for a fee
assessment. As Jim McGrath, ASSU
Senate Rules Committee chairman is
quoted in the Daily, "Would you go
out and try to organize a petition
drive (to get a fee assessment on the
ballot) when you could sit down with
(ASSU senator) Mark Epstein for two
hours and work it all out?"
In my opinion, the fee refund sys
tem is not a farce; the farce is the fee
assessment system that permitted the
taking of a fairly large sum of money
by interest groups apparently in
sensitive to the feelings of many stu
dents. Making fee assessments man
datory for "the common good" will
only increase feelings of cynicism,

disillusionment and alienation of stu
dents from their representatives. The
solution to the problem is for the fee
assessment approval process to be
sensitive to the desires of the stu
dents.

Infantile reactions
We are writing to say how embar
rassed and ashamed we are, as ardent
feminists, to share the title of feminist
with much of the crowd at the Schlaf
ly/MacKinnon debate on Jan. 26.
One of the most important freedoms
that women deserve is the freedom
to choose their lifestyle and their
opinions without harassment from
others. In an extreme case, this trans
lates into freedom from sexual
harassment; in the less severe case, it
means the right that Schlafly has to
make of her life whatever she
chooses, and to express that choice
without the infantile reactions of
booing and hissing that emanated
from much of the crowd
We, of course, agreed with
MacKinnon, on the whole, rather
than Schlafly. Apparently, we are
only two of a small group of feminists
present at the debate who feel secure
enough in our own beliefs to allow
someone else to express theirs with
the respect that the speaker, as a fel
low woman, deserves.
