# Defendant protection urged
## 
### Mike Thurman 
Although district attorneys and
public defenders normally stand at
odds in the courtroom, Richard Titus,
a Santa Clara County district at
torney, and William Cottrell, a Santa
Clara County deputy public de
fender, generally agreed in their
assessments and support of "The Le
gal Process" in the second of Toyon
Hall's Criminal Justice Speaker/Film
Series held Wednesday night.
The two men responded to Stan
ford Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal's
questions as well as those from the
audience of about 35.

"Even if a client admits he's guilty,
but he still wants a trial, he's got an
absolute right to that trial," said Cot
trell.
"Unfortunately," Cottrell con
tinued, "the general tenor today has
become, 'What we really need is a lit
tle more efficient justice,' and we be
gin cutting down on defendants'
rights."
Titus agreed that the rights of de
fendants must be protected fully un
der the legal system.
"If I had my way," said Titus, "ev
ery case would go to trial. The prob
lem is, if everybody demanded a jury
trial, the entire American criminal
justice system would stop function
ing" due to the resulting adminis
trative flood of cases that would
swamp the courts.
Responding to a question on plea
bargaining, which presently relieves
the courts of a vast number of trial
cases each year, both men admitted
that injustices do occur.
Said Titus, "There are cases where
people plead guilty when they know
they're innocent. Maybe they have
come into court six or seven times,
and they've waited in jail all that time,
and finally they just want to get it
over with."
"That happens," said Cottrell,
"and I feel very bad that it happens,

but it does happen . . . fairly often."
Titus was questioned on the up
coming case of a Stanford student
charged with drunk driving and ve
hicular manslaughter. He was asked
whether, based on the education and
achievements of the individual, the
district attorney's office would con
sider not prosecuting for a full prison
sentence.
Titus said he could not comment
on the particular case because it is
likely that he will be the prosecutor
in the preliminary examination,
which is scheduled for Feb. 26.
However, Titus said, "Our general
office policy, which is not related to
this case in particular but to all cases
that come into our office, is that we
do not belive in making special cases
for anybody.
"We will process a case regardless
of a person's rank, station orstanding
in society," he continued. "There's
no room for privilege in the law."
