New York — President
Ronald Reagan said he will
stick to his goal of diminishing
Washington's role in a host of
local and private sector ac
tivities, but he made one huge
and possibly dangerous excep
tion.
That exception was the
budget deficit, the financing of
which intrudes deep into what
the private sector considers its
territory, sopping up a limited
supply of capital that otherwise
might help finance industry.
Since industrial expansion
kjs Uppn a Kigli priority of the
Reagan administration, a con
tradiction seems to exist. Can
industry expand, that is, if

Washington won't give it the
room in financial markets?
The argument has been well
aired even before the presi
dent indicated he had aban
doned major remedies for
quickly closing the budget gap,
which he now places at nearly
SIOO billion in this fiscal year.
Paul Volcker, the Federal Re
serve Board chairman, never
has ceased to be concerned,
seeming to feel he has but two
choices for handling the credit
demands of the federal gov
ernment: Keep a firm hold on
the money supply and watch
interest rates rise; or let the
printing presses run, making
credit available for all, and
watch inflation resume its rise.

Either way, the economy gets
damaged, so again and again
Volcker has sought to get the
budget gap reduced. Just hours
before the State of the Union
Message he suggested that
heavy Treasury borrowing
could work against the very ob
jectives of the Reagan adminis
tration.
Whatever might be done to
return responsibilites to states
and reduce the size of federal
government, that deficit re
mains a tremendous factor in
the marketplace — a wide
wedge driven into the private
sector from whence the admin
istration expects the economic
recovery to come.
