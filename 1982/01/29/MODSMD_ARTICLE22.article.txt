# 'New Federalism' to harm poor?

Dallas â€” President Ronald Reagan's
"New Federalism" would lead to great dis
parities among states, experts say, even
though they think the program has little
chance of succeeding in Congress.
Reagan, in his State of the Union
message Tuesday, asked Congress to shift
$47 billion to states for such federal pro
grams as food stamps and aid to depen
dent children.
But those interviewed saw severe draw
backs in the program.
Harold Howe, a senior lecturer in
Harvard University's graduate School of
Education, said he fears the program will
be difficult for states.
"They're also having trouble financing
their governments," Howe said. "It's going
to be hard to resist the temptation to save
money on poor people. The poor people
do not represent an effective political con
stituency.
"They're relatively unorganized," said
Howe, who was U.S. commissioner of
education from 1965 to 1968 under Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson. "They just can't
stand up to the middle class and business

interests and otners who are well or
ganized. I think things like the food stamps
program are very likely to suffer."
James Sundquist, senior fellow in gov
ernmental studies at the Brookings Institu
tion, the Washington-based think tank,
agrees: "The instances of distress vary
from state to state and city to city. It's a na
tional responsibility to see that people are
not starving. There's got to be some means
to redistribute wealth, and only the federal
government has that authority. Only the
federal government has a taxing program
that hits at the source of wealth."
Edward Banfield, a noted conservative
and a Harvard University professor, says
Reagan's proposal gives states all power
over entitlement programs, thus inequities
are inevitable.
"What if Mississippi tries to maintain its
poor at a lower level than most people
consider adequate?" he asked.
Howe, when questioned about how
Reagan's plan would "revolutionize" state
relations, said, "I hate giving Ronald Rea
gan credit for a revolution. It is certainly a
major reversal of a trend, no question
about that.

"The way I see it, most of that trend has
been a trend which meant having govern
ment take more effective responsibility for
both the rights and the livelihood of peo
ple in the bottom quarter of society.
"Although I have some agreement with
Ronald Reagan on the point that the states
are more mature and more effective or
ganizations than they once were, I do not
have sufficient confidence in the states to
warrant degree of shift he's proposing."
He questions the validity of delegating
this responsibility to the states, saying,
"The reason the federal government got
into the act was because they (the states)
weren't. There were enough people
around who thought this ought to be a
more humane societyandthatweoughtto
get the federal government to do it. . .
"These proposals for putting more
burden on states come at a time when the
whole psychology of state taxation has
been reversed. Now we're having proposi
tion this and that in umpteen states. We
don't want to do more things with govern
ment at the state level.
"In a way, President Reagan is barking
up a tree states are trying to chop down."
