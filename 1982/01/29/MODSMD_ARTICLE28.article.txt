## Floundering Card to meet ASU 
### Sid Spaeth 
The Pacific-10's three los
ingest teams battle this week
end in a desperate scrap for
conference survival.
The Cardinal, 1-6 in the con
ference, is tied with Arizona
State in eighth place and will
face the Sun Devils tomorrow
night and then take on 0-7 Ari
zona Monday night.
Stanford is 0-3 on the road,
and despite dropping five
straight games and nine of their
last 11, coach Dick Dißiaso said
their attitude is "exceptional."
"We had a great practice yes
terday,"he added. "Three guys
had exceptional practices and
those are three guys who have
had very little playing
time. . .and they're out there
busting their butts.
"We just have to be objec
tive in how we look at our op
portunities," he continued.
"The three of us (Stanford, ASU
and Arizona) are in the bottom
of the league. Obviously all
three of us are looking at this
weekend and thinking we can
pick up wins."
Dißiaso said he will continue
to use a zone defense and a
slow down offense.

"We expect them to open up
the game and run on us. We
have to play a different type of
game — we can't get into a run
and-gun type of game. We
want the score to be in the high
50's not the high 70's or 80's."
To keep the Sun Devils un
der control the Cardinal will
have to stop the talented
guard, Lafayette "Fat" Lever.
Lever is averaging 15.7 points,
5.3 rebounds, 4 assists and 2.3
steals a game.
"I don't think we'll concen
trate on Lever any more than
we'd concentrate on Dwight
Anderson (USC) or Kenny
Fields (UCLA)," Dißiaso said.
"It doesn't matter who we're
playing. It's a matter of how
we're playing and if we can
control the tempo of the
game."
Stanford's quickness has
been decimated by the loss of
guard Keith Jones (academic
ineligibility) and forward Hans
Wichary (stress foot fracture),
but Steve Brown has moved
into and made an impact in the
starting backcourt.
"Steve Brown has continued
to improve each game,"
Dißiaso said. "He has emerged

as our best defensive player. As
he continues to improve his
ball handling it will allow us to
play Roger Lemons and rest
Doug Marty."
In the frontcourt, Stanford is
led by sophomore center John
Revelli who is averaging 17.3
points and 9.2 rebounds a
game. Revelli is shooting .650
from the field and ,796from the
free throw line.
The Cardinal's high-scoring
forward Brian Welch is averag
ing only 10.2 points a game, but
Dißiaso said it's because of his
different role in the offense.
"In 11 of our 16games, Brian
is averaging 15 points a game,
but in our other five games he
has had to play a role other
than scoring."
Johnny Rogers, averaging
12.9 points a game, rounds out
the Cardinal starting lineup.
Monday in Tuscon the team
will have to perform in "what
has potential to be a pit of an
arena," Dißiaso said.
"The fans really get into the
game," he added. "It's hard to
play there, but historically we
have sone well there."
On the court, Arizona has
had a frustrating season and

has not won a game since Dec.
29. The Wildcats have also lost
leading scorer Jeff Collins due
at academic reasons.
Junior forward Frank Smith
has hit 58 percent of his field
goals to lead Arizona with 13.7
points a game.
Stanfors's biggest problem
will come tomorrow night in
Arizona State7s towering and
explosive backcourt tandem of
Lever and Paul Williams.
"Fat Lever and Williams go at
6-4 and 6-6 so you really have to
respect their high-scring
backcourt," Dißiaso said.
PASS INS:
• Stanford leads the Pac-10 in
free throw percentage with
.751.
• Brian Welch needs only 27
points to surpass Wolfe Perry in
eighth place on the Stanford
all-time scoring ladder with
1287 points.
• Stanford is well above its
career field goal percentage
mark of .490 (1978-79) with a
.505 average.
• Freshman Johnny Rogers is
leading all conference rookie
scorers with a 12.9 average.
