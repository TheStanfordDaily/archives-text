# 'Dogs could prove a turning point
## Curious cagewomen face Fresno 
### Sally Jenkins 
The Stanford women's
basketball team takes on the
Fresno State Lady Bulldogs
tomorrow night at Maples Pa
vilion in a game that could be a
turning point in the Cardinal's
curious season.
Stanford, 12-6 overall and 2-2
in Northern California Athletic

Conference competition, is
tied for third place with the
6-10 Bulldogs after a 74-65
back-breaking loss to San Jose
State last Saturday. The squad
was a preseason favorite to take
the conference championship
for the first time ever, but a
series of injuries have put them
one-and-a-half games out of

the lead. The Spartans are cur
rently tied with UC-Berkeley as
leaders with 3-0 records.
The Norcal conference win
ners are assured of an auto
matic NCAA regional playoff
berth this season.
Fresno State is guided by
first-year coach Bob Spencer, a
genius from William Penn col
lege in lowa, where he posted a
240-63 record in eight seasons
and captured six AIAW division
II tournament berths. His big
guns at Fresno are in six-foot
two center Patty DeLotto, who
has a 15.2 point average per
game, and 5-9 forward Carena
Clay, who has been averaging
13 points.
"Fresno has a very patient,
patterned offense, and it is well
coached," said Cardinal head
coach Dotty McCrea. "They
don't take bad shots and they
make their opponents work on
offense. I don't know if we can
beat them at this point — we
seem to bring out the best in
our opponents lately."
If McCrea seems a little
pessimistic at this point, at
tribute it to a string of injuries

that has hit at the very heart of
her team. Cardinal All-NorCal
6-0 forward and second-lead
ing scorer Jeanne Hoff missed
the Spartan tilt with a twisted
ankle, the first game she had sat
out in herentire careerat Stan
ford. A redshirt last season, she
had appeared in 74 straight
games since 1978, and has been
averaging 14 points a six re
bounds a game this season.
Hoff is expected back in the
starting lineup tomorrow, and
it's a timely recovery because
starting 6-2 center Louise
Smith, the team's leading
scorer and rebounder (16
point, nine rebound avgerage
per game) is out with
mononucleosis and listed as
doubtful for Fresno State.
Starting forward Kim Kup
ferer, a leading scorerearlier in
the season, underwent sugery
to repair torn ligaments in her
right kneee last week, and is
listed as out for the season.
Healthy starters for tomor
row are 6-1 forward meg
Metzger, 6-0 forward Mary
Bradach, 5-7 guard Debi Gore,
and 6-0 guard Ann Miller.


SHOOT THE DOCS — The Stanford women's basketball team will take on the Fresno
State Lady Bulldogs tomorrow night in Maples Pavilion at 7:30 p.m. The Cardinal, 12-6
overall, is tied with the 6-10 Dogs for third place in the Northern California Athletic Con
ference.
