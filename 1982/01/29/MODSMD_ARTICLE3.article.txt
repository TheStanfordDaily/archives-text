Padua, Italy (AP) — Police com
mandos stormed a second-floor
apartment and rescued kidnapped
American general james Dozier from
under the guns of his Red Brigades
kidnappers yesterday, in a "text
book" operation that dealt a stun
ning blow to Italy's feared leftist ter
rorist gang.
The raiders smashed down the
door of the "people's prison" and
pounced on a gunman pointing a
pistol at the U.S. Army officer's head,
Italian authorities reported.
"If they hadn't been so fast, the
story would have had a different end
ing," Interior Minister Virginio
Rognoni said.
Five suspects — three men and two
women — were seized in the apart
ment, in a student-populated area of
this northern Italian industrial town.
No shots were fired, but one of the
suspects was treated at a hospital for
cuts on the head suffered in a scuffle
with the commandos, police and
hospital officials said.

The lightning raid ended a 42-day
ordeal for Brig. Gen. Dozier, 50, who
is the highest-ranking American at
the NATO base in Verona, 40 miles
west of here.
Dozier, found bound, gagged, in
stocking feet and a blue warm-up
suit, was whisked off to Padua police
headquarters and then to a hospital
at a NATO base in nearby Vicenza for
examination. Officers there said the
first thing he asked for was a barber,
who shaved off six weeks' growth of
beard.
"I never lost hope of being freed,"
he was quoted as saying.
In Washington, President Ronald
Reagan was awakened at 6:50 a.m.
EST and told of the rescue. "A lot of
prayers have been answered. It's dif
ficult to express gratitude to all those
who assisted in his release," an aide
quoted the president as saying.
"We won one. It is very, very
good," said U.S. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig, on an official visit to
publicans in the new district than in
tin' old district.
Dogherty said that although cam
paigning will be more difficult in the
district because of its increased size,
the real issue is "good government
versus bad government.
"This is totally political," he said.
"The purpose of election districts is
to bring together communities with
similar interests and this doesn't do
that," he added.
Lantos said he thinks his new dis
trict will have approximately the
same percentage of Democrats and
Republicans as his old district.
"All reapportionments done
within a partisan politics context fa
vors the party in power," he said.
Lantos admitted the Democratic
plan was politically motivated, but
c harged the Republicans with being
"equally partisan.
"We have had outrageous Re
publican plans in states where the
Republicans have a majority," he
said.
In order to alleviate the problem of
partisan politics interfering with re
apportionment, Lantos said he favors
allowing a judicial body draw district
lines with the help of computers.
"It's an essential element of good
government that you draw the dis
trictline along non-partisan lines,"
Lantos said, adding that he favors leg
islation sponsored by Common
Cause that would remove reappor
tionment from the legislature.
