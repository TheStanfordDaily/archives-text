# Matmen look to pin CMC Stags
## 
### Mark Kerber 
Stanford head coach Chris
Horpel's wrestlers return home
this evening to square off
against Claremont Men's Col
lege. The meet promises to be a
good one as Horpel sends out
his strongest lineup of the sea
son.
The feature match of the
contest should be at 190
pounds where powerful
freshman Ed Katz will try to
tarnish the 12-3 record of Stag
Doug Rubino. Katz has lost
only once this season and that
in the heavyweight division.
In a strategic maneuver,
Card stalwart 177-pounder
Doug Perkins will take on small
(184 pound) heavyweight Chris
Myrick, with co-captain Mark
Martel moving in at 177.
Martel, fourth in the Pacific-10
Conference tournament last
year at 158, has seen less action
than he would have liked this
season. After building himself
up to 167, he found himself
splitting time with rapidly im
proving Tim Mullen.
Horpel's move gives the
Cardinal a formidible finishing
kick with solid competitors at

each of the last four weights.
In the lighter weights, Stan
ford sends out Tim Daniels
(9-2) at 126, recent returnee
Derrick Strahorn at 134, and
Brigham Johnson at 142
pounds.
If the grapplers can grab the
lead through these weights,
Claremont will be hard pressed
to close the gap.
In the 150-pound class, first
year law student Bruce Rubin
will try to shake off the effects
of first semester finals. Rubin
has been out of the Card lineup
in recent weeks and his return
will shore up the middle
weights.
Jody Williams faces Calre
mont's best at 158 pounds. Stag
team captain Kevin Reuter
brings a 10-1 record into the
fray.
Overall, Claremont brings a
solid, consistent team to the
Farm. The key to a Cardinal vic
tory is at 126 and 134 pounds,
where a fast start would neu
tralize the Stags' middleweight
strength.
The battle begins at 7 p.m. in
the Encina wrestling room.
