THE DISAPPEARING GREEK
What ever happened to
Jimmy the Greek last Sun
day afternoon?
There he was — in all of
his gold-chained glory —
telling CBS cohort Brent
Musburger moments
before the Super Bowl XVI
kickoff that the outcome
was anything but in doubt.
"Cincinnati will win this
football game," spake the
Greek.
And why? Because, ac
cording to the Greek, big
games are decided by the
best seven players on each
side of the line. The Bengals
have the better players, he
said, the rest is academic.
Two years ago, on his last
Super Bowl assignment for
CBS, the Greek had been
equally affirmative — and
equally wrong. "The Rams
in an upset," he trumpeted.
A wonderful pick for three
quarters. Fhen Terry Brad
shaw remembered John
Stallworth, the Rams turned
to Lambs, and the Greek's
bank book went South.
Three weeks ago at
Candlestick Park, the Greek
became a certified Great
Moment in Sports when he
didn't even try to hide his
disgust with the 49ers' dra
matic 28-27 victory over Dal

las on the CBS post-game
show. While the joyous 49er
faithful went absolutely out
of their gourds, the Greek
(who had evidently — and
unfortunately — loved Dal
las to death) made for quite
a contrast as he sat there si
lently glowering at the cam
eras. A real piece of work,
this Greek!
Last Sunday, of course, it
got even worse. The
Bengals, his Bengals, his sev
en-best-players Bengals
spent the entire first half
searching for the Silver
dome exits. The prize de
fense disappeared, Kenny
Anderson played catch with
the niners' Dwight Hicks,
head coach Forrest Gregg
set a world record for
twitching. So it went. 20-0,
San Francisco at half-time.
The final count of 26-21 was
deceivingly tight. It wasn't
that close a game.
So where was the Greek
through all this? Got me. He
wasn't no camera, that's for
sure. Did he take a powder?
Was he powdered? Only
CBS knows. Maybe he
sneaked off at the in
termission with the rest of
the twitwit "Up With Peo
ple" troupe.
UNBEATEN
AND UNKNOWN
Meet the Missouri Tigers,
17-0, the nation's top
ranked college basketball

team. Who are these guys?
No one seems to know. The
Tigers' only name player,
6-11 center Steve
Stipanovich, achieved much
more notoriety last year in
his own bedroom (where he
accidentally shot himself
while cleaning a gun) than
he ever has on the court.
This season, though,
Stipanovich is working over
the opposition. With pow
erful Ricky Frazier and ex
plosive Mark Dressier (now
over knee problems) taking
the hammer to opposing
front lines, and Juco
transfers Prince Bridges and
Michael Walker joining
holdover |on Sundvold to
form a snazzy backcourt,
the Tigers appear to have
everything.
Writes Dave Dorr of the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
"The Tigersare a team that is
as deep as the ocean and as
quick as a t. ,k." He may
know of what he writes. Al
ready, Missou has
whomped Louisville, USC,
and Illinois.
No Big Eight school has
ever won three straight
league championships. Mis
souri could be the first, pro
viding the Tigers survive
tomorrow's visit to 14th
ranked Kansas State (14-3
overall).
As for a national cham
pionship? The Tigers will
