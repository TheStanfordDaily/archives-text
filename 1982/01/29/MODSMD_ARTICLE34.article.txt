Somehow, I thought, this ain't rock and roll.
Onstage at the Roxy, a comfortable nightclub on Sun
t Boulevard dressed in Formica and tinsel (this was still
ie holiday season, after all), a middle-aged man dressed
a woman's evening gown sang operatic solos in a —
ell» very powerful soprano profundo accompanied by
ped tracks from Verdi's Greatest Hits. Half of the au
ience sarcastically shouted "Bravo!", half had dis
ensed with sarcasm and threw cups and ice at the
iagna prima donna, and a few hardcore punks slam
anced in the corner of the large room. Two bargain
asement totem poles and a rubber bat hanging from
ie ceiling added mute testimony to the scene.
Is this Wall of Voodoo? Hell, no — this is the opening
ct. After a surprisingly entertaining show by second
illed Monitor (about which I can only remember the
ozy electric fire in front of the drum kit) and this clown
oing through his modus operati, I was ready for just
bout anything.
; Of course I knew what I was in for, however. I've been
aking the opportunity to see Wall of Voodoo just about
•Very time they've come down the pike or up the
grapevine for about two years now, and if that makes me
1 Voodoohead or something like that, then so be it.
One reason for my devotion is in Wall of Voodoo's
Yiusic. They could be called a new wave band, if the term
neant anything anymore. Failingthat, itwould be best to
ust call them different. Capital D. No one instrument
carries much of a melody in their songs — instead, sever
al layers of counterpoint and juxtaposed notesare added
to a simple rhythm track. This system of songwriting
doesn't seem to be used much in music — the only other
bands I can think of that are this dependent on call-and
response playing are Talking Heads and Devo, and their
results with the technique are somewhat mixed. Wall of
Voodoo strips down the method to its essential parts,
and even though all they do sometimes is play one key

off another (as in "Red Light" from their Dark Continent
LP), the resulting songs are truly effective.
This is not to say that Wall of Voodoo is a simple band,
though. The technique is simple — it seems easy to add a
lot of sounds overa rhythm track — but the playing itself
takes a lot of skill. The average Wall of Voodoo song has
at least three keyboards playing fulltime, plus the insis
tent beat of "Ace" (the band's rhythm machine, which
usually supplies the band with its blank canvas), plus
"drummer" Joe Nanini's endless array of percussion fills,
plus a rather discordant guitar slaving away in the back
ground. In other words, we've got a hard working band
here.
Onstage, the hard work shows impressively, com
bined with a genuine desire to have a good time. Key
boards player Chas Gray, though probably saddled with
the most difficult musical role (he's usually playing two
synthesizers and fiddling with various dials), hops
around his ensemble of equipment like a palsy victim
with happy feet; just to his right, Marc Moreland plays
guitar with an amazing sense of timing and feedback, de
spite having apparently little control over the fearsome
looking expressions on his face. On the other side of the
stage, Nanini, who looks like Charles Boyer on a bad day
since he cropped his hair, cracks both jokes and cow
bells, along with a set of pots and pans (with cooking
stains on them) and a horrible-looking cymbal. Oh, he
has a drum set too. At the front of the Roxy stage, Bruce
Moreland playsa placid bassand keyboard, leavingplen
ty of room for lead singer Stan Ridgway to grumble his
vocals out the side of his mouth (it looks as if he's forced
to sing) and sarcastically attack both his songs and the au
dience. There's a lot of power in this combination, along
with an impressive display of humor; compared to the
attitude of most electronic bands (which is to stand up
and implicitly tell the audience "pretty cool for you,
huh?") this alone makes Wall of Voodoo pretty darned
special.
Unfortunately, the complex structure of Wall of
Voodoo isn't readily apparent on record. Dark Conti
nent is an appealing record in its own right, but not for
the same reasons that I like the band. Onstage, the band
is anchored, both physically and musically — Joe Nanini
and Ace hold down the fort, regardless of where the
song goes melodically. The album, on the other hand,
seems to lost its bottom half. The only song on which

there is a detectable low side is "Back in Flesh", thanks
mainly to a rumbling bass line provided by Bruce
Moreland. This was probably an intentional move on the
band's part to give the texture of the songs more room to
drift; if not, then it's simply a mistake. I'm not sure I agree
with it either way.
Vet if Dark Continent doesn't offer the listener the
benefits of the live Wall of Voodoo, it does serve as a
complement. I kind of miss having the humor of the live
show preserved on wax, but at the same time things show
up on the album that are difficult to grasp in the middle
of a teeming mass of slam dancers yearning to heave
free.
Lyrics, for example. You remember lyrics. I remember
lyrics. Rolling Stone knows nothing but lyrics, or at least
they didn't back in the days when they were a rock maga
zine. But have you ever really tried to hear them from a
live rock band? I mean, Frank Sinatra's one thing,
AC/DC's quite another. Suppose that I proclaimed that
Band X was the best band ever, and then I find that the
words to all the songs were lifted straight from the Book
of Mormon, or the Shell Answer Man, or Phil Donahue
or something. Boy, would there be egg on my reportorial
face.

Now that I have Dark Continent, and now that the
folks were nice enough to print some of the words on the
inner sleeve (though in a tangled and somewhat difficult
manner), I don't have to worry. Lead singer/keyboardist
Stan Ridgway half-joked some months ago that "Wall of
Voodoo is about bad luck". Though it's not as simple as
all that, bad luck plays an integral role in Stan's lyrics: the
spooky "Tse-Tse Fly" is about an unwary victim "walking
through the jungle looking for good business", while the
poor sap of "Call Box" is "guided by the force of circum
stance/and by the belt that holds up my pants".
The lyrical focus of Wall of Voodoo is invariably on the
in dividual, usually in conjunction with the grand design
of society. In all too many bands, this theme has led to
pretension on the one hand and terrible music on the
other. With Wall of Voodoo, though, the problem
doesn't arise. The false security of "Good Times", or the
insistent "Canyou design a heart that doesn't bleed?" in
"Crack the Bell" somehow ring true — far truer than
many other supposed confessions of other singers. And
with the humor and power of the band live, they certain
ly don't seem in any danger of overextending them
selves. It may be a Dark Continent for Wall of Voodoo,
but they have a bright future.

around his ensemble of equipment like a palsy victim
with happy feet; just to his right, Marc Moreland plays
guitar with an amazing sense of timing and feedback, de
spite having apparently little control over the fearsome
looking expressions on his face. On the other side of the
stage, Nanini, who looks like Charles Boyer on a bad day
since he cropped his hair, cracks both jokes and cow
bells, along with a set of pots and pans (with cooking
stains on them) and a horrible-looking cymbal. Oh, he
has a drum set too. At the front of the Roxy stage, Bruce
Moreland playsa placid bassand keyboard, leavingplen
ty of room for lead singer Stan Ridgway to grumble his
vocals out the side of his mouth (it looks as if he's forced
to sing) and sarcastically attack both his songs and the au
dience. There's a lot of power in this combination, along
with an impressive display of humor; compared to the
attitude of most electronic bands (which is to stand up
and implicitly tell the audience "pretty cool for you,
huh?") this alone makes Wall of Voodoo pretty darned
special.
Unfortunately, the complex structure of Wall of
Voodoo isn't readily apparent on record. Dark Conti
nent is an appealing record in its own right, but not for
the same reasons that I like the band. Onstage, the band
is anchored, both physically and musically — Joe Nanini
and Ace hold down the fort, regardless of where the
song goes melodically. The album, on the other hand,
seems to lost its bottom half. The only song on which

there is a detectable low side is "Back in Flesh", thanks
mainly to a rumbling bass line provided by Bruce
Moreland. This was probably an intentional move on the
band's part to give the texture of the songs more room to
drift; if not, then it's simply a mistake. I'm not sure I agree
with it either way.
Vet if Dark Continent doesn't offer the listener the
benefits of the live Wall of Voodoo, it does serve as a
complement. I kind of miss having the humor of the live
show preserved on wax, but at the same time things show
up on the album that are difficult to grasp in the middle
of a teeming mass of slam dancers yearning to heave
free.
Lyrics, for example. You remember lyrics. I remember
lyrics. Rolling Stone knows nothing but lyrics, or at least
they didn't back in the days when they were a rock maga
zine. But have you ever really tried to hear them from a
live rock band? I mean, Frank Sinatra's one thing,
AC/DC's quite another. Suppose that I proclaimed that
Band X was the best band ever, and then I find that the
words to all the songs were lifted straight from the Book
of Mormon, or the Shell Answer Man, or Phil Donahue
or something. Boy, would there be egg on my reportorial
face.

Now that I have Dark Continent, and now that the
folks were nice enough to print some of the words on the
inner sleeve (though in a tangled and somewhat difficult
manner), I don't have to worry. Lead singer/keyboardist
Stan Ridgway half-joked some months ago that "Wall of
Voodoo is about bad luck". Though it's not as simple as
all that, bad luck plays an integral role in Stan's lyrics: the
spooky "Tse-Tse Fly" is about an unwary victim "walking
through the jungle looking for good business", while the
poor sap of "Call Box" is "guided by the force of circum
stance/and by the belt that holds up my pants".
The lyrical focus of Wall of Voodoo is invariably on the
in dividual, usually in conjunction with the grand design
of society. In all too many bands, this theme has led to
pretension on the one hand and terrible music on the
other. With Wall of Voodoo, though, the problem
doesn't arise. The false security of "Good Times", or the
insistent "Canyou design a heart that doesn't bleed?" in
"Crack the Bell" somehow ring true — far truer than
many other supposed confessions of other singers. And
with the humor and power of the band live, they certain
ly don't seem in any danger of overextending them
selves. It may be a Dark Continent for Wall of Voodoo,
but they have a bright future.

Somehow, I thought, this ain't rock and roll.
Onstage at the Roxy, a comfortable nightclub on Sun
t Boulevard dressed in Formica and tinsel (this was still
ie holiday season, after all), a middle-aged man dressed
a woman's evening gown sang operatic solos in a —
ell» very powerful soprano profundo accompanied by
ped tracks from Verdi's Greatest Hits. Half of the au
ience sarcastically shouted "Bravo!", half had dis
ensed with sarcasm and threw cups and ice at the
iagna prima donna, and a few hardcore punks slam
anced in the corner of the large room. Two bargain
asement totem poles and a rubber bat hanging from
ie ceiling added mute testimony to the scene.
Is this Wall of Voodoo? Hell, no — this is the opening
ct. After a surprisingly entertaining show by second
illed Monitor (about which I can only remember the
ozy electric fire in front of the drum kit) and this clown
oing through his modus operati, I was ready for just
bout anything.
; Of course I knew what I was in for, however. I've been
aking the opportunity to see Wall of Voodoo just about
•Very time they've come down the pike or up the
grapevine for about two years now, and if that makes me
1 Voodoohead or something like that, then so be it.
One reason for my devotion is in Wall of Voodoo's
Yiusic. They could be called a new wave band, if the term
neant anything anymore. Failingthat, itwould be best to
ust call them different. Capital D. No one instrument
carries much of a melody in their songs — instead, sever
al layers of counterpoint and juxtaposed notesare added
to a simple rhythm track. This system of songwriting
doesn't seem to be used much in music — the only other
bands I can think of that are this dependent on call-and
response playing are Talking Heads and Devo, and their
results with the technique are somewhat mixed. Wall of
Voodoo strips down the method to its essential parts,
and even though all they do sometimes is play one key

off another (as in "Red Light" from their Dark Continent
LP), the resulting songs are truly effective.
This is not to say that Wall of Voodoo is a simple band,
though. The technique is simple — it seems easy to add a
lot of sounds overa rhythm track — but the playing itself
takes a lot of skill. The average Wall of Voodoo song has
at least three keyboards playing fulltime, plus the insis
tent beat of "Ace" (the band's rhythm machine, which
usually supplies the band with its blank canvas), plus
"drummer" Joe Nanini's endless array of percussion fills,
plus a rather discordant guitar slaving away in the back
ground. In other words, we've got a hard working band
here.
Onstage, the hard work shows impressively, com
bined with a genuine desire to have a good time. Key
boards player Chas Gray, though probably saddled with
the most difficult musical role (he's usually playing two
synthesizers and fiddling with various dials), hops
around his ensemble of equipment like a palsy victim
with happy feet; just to his right, Marc Moreland plays

Voodoo is about bad luck". Though it's not as simple as
all that, bad luck plays an integral role in Stan's lyrics: the
spooky "Tse-Tse Fly" is about an unwary victim "walking
through the jungle looking for good business", while the
poor sap of "Call Box" is "guided by the force of circum
stance/and by the belt that holds up my pants".
The lyrical focus of Wall of Voodoo is invariably on the
in dividual, usually in conjunction with the grand design
of society. In all too many bands, this theme has led to
pretension on the one hand and terrible music on the
other. With Wall of Voodoo, though, the problem
doesn't arise. The false security of "Good Times", or the
insistent "Canyou design a heart that doesn't bleed?" in
"Crack the Bell" somehow ring true — far truer than
many other supposed confessions of other singers. And
with the humor and power of the band live, they certain
ly don't seem in any danger of overextending them
selves. It may be a Dark Continent for Wall of Voodoo,
but they have a bright future.
