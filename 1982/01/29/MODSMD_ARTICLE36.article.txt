FORMICO'S
2115 St. Francis Drive
(Hwy. 101 & W. Em
barcadero)

Formico's is an ideal example
of a friendly neighborhood
pizza place with 50-year-old
Italian recipes on the "other
side of the menu." It is not the
kind of pizza joint that serves
up cheap food to keep the
electronic game players happy
(there aren't any games here at
all!), nor is it a posh Italian
ristorante; instead, Formico's
strikes a successful balance be
tween the unpretentious in
formalitv of a pizza parlor and
the quality food of a fine Italian
restaurant.
Although the majority of
Formico's customers dine on
pizza, the menu offers a sur
prising variety of Italian dishes
including five different veal en
trees and four vegetarian op
tions as well (eggplant
parmigiana, monicotti, etc.).
"Its still a shock to some of our
regular pizza customers when
the\ realize we make dinners
too," savs Duane Margreiter,
one of Formico's two owners.
In his six years with Formico's,
Margreiter has continued to
expand the menu, with a
notable effort at accomodating
more meatless tastes — e.g. the
vegetarian selections and the
recently added option of
whole wheat pizza crust — in
response to "Palo Altans'
health consciousness."
Although the dinner entrees
are available a la carte (this still
includes a basket of French
bread), for about7scents more
vou can get a meal that in
cludes soup or salad, and cof
fee, tea or milk. The pasta
selections on the menu —
spaghetti, rigatoni, or ravioli
with vour choice of five dif
ferent sauces — can be or
dered in half-portions, in case

you want to complement your
pizza or simply feel like ex
perimenting. Consistent with
its attention to the needs of
vegetarians, Formico's makes
two different sauces — one
with tomatoes and meat, one
with tomatoes and mushrooms
— for the side of rigatoni that
comes with all entrees.
Once we had ordered and
paid at the counter, we picked
up silverware, napkins and wa
ter glasses, and sat down at the
nearest table with our soup,
salad and drinks. The soup was
a fairly mild minestrone — a
tasty broth with a few mis
cellaneous vegetables and one
chunk of potato floating in the
wide, shallow bowl. The salad
was your average dinner varie
ty, sprinkled with croutons, a
couple of chili peppers and a
slice of tomato. I sipped on my
glass of house Chablis (served
with style in a juice glass), while
my dinner companion nursed a
glass of dark beer from the tap
(they serve pitchers here!).
It was peak dinner hour and
the place was pretty busy, so
we had to wait a bit for our
number to come up; we
a in used ourselves by
eavesdropping on nearby con
versations and timing the
pizzas as they were tossed by
the experts. (Who said For
mico's doesn't have live enter
tainment?)
With our dinners came a
plastic basket of French bread
(cold but fresh), and a busboy
graciously cleared away our
soup and salad dishes while we
picked up our tray of food.
I was truly impressed with
our entrees; what this place
lacks in elegance, it makes up
for in the quality of its food.
The Veal Scallopine boasted
tender, thin slices of baby veal
drenched in a rich sauce of
white wine, mushrooms and
tomatoes. My generous por
tion of Spinach Lasagne was
well-endowed with fresh

spinach, a delicious blend of ri
cotta, mozarella and four other
cheeses, and a spicy tomato
sauce. Our side orders of
rigatoni came with the ap
propriate sauces — a meat
sauce for my companion and a
mushroom sauce for me.
We ordered a small (10-inch)
pizza to accompanv our meal:
one half "Vegi Combo"
(mushroom, onion, bell pep
per, olive) and one half "Jerry's
Treat" (mushroom, onion, bell
pepper, sausage) for $5.75, as
compared to $4.55 for the sin
gle-item small size. Formico's is
justifiably proud of its New
York-style pizza, featuring a
wonderful bread-like dough
for the crust (in fact, the same
dough can be used for bread
baking) that is a welcome
change from the common
cracker-type pizza crust. The
sauce is freshly made with
crushed tomatoes and spices,
and the toppings are gener
ously distributed. Formico's
prices are definitely com
petitive with other local pizza
places: extra large (16-inch)
pizzas sell for $8.95 (single
item), $10.95 (four-item com
binations) and $12.95 ("VIP
Special" with eight items).
If you're a believer in the
maxim, "Vou can't eat at
mosphere," Formico's is just
the kind of place for you. As
Margreiter himself puts it, "We
like to let our food stand by
itself. . . We're not here to en
tertain people, we're here to
feed them." So don't expect
anv fancy decor: there are no
tablecloths, no plants (unless
you count the artificial leaves
hanging from the ceiling), no
funky art prints (just a bunch of
tacked-up posters), and "no
jukebox," says Margreiter.
"lust a lot of people enjoying
good food — that's the kind of
atmosphere we want here."
