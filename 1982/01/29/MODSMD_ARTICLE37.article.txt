SKYWOOD CHATEAU
17311 Skyline Boulevard

The drive up La Honda Road is one of
my favorite routes — whether I'm head
ing for the beach or simply in the mood
for a drive through the Redwoods. Now
I have a new excuse to make the trip: a
restaurant called the Skywood Chateau.
Located at the Woodside junction of
La Honda Road and Skyline Boulevard,
the Skywood Chateau offers the rare
combination of excellent food, a cozy
vet elegant ambience, superior service,
and a panoramic view to top it all off.
Entering the restaurant by way of the
well-attended bar, we were seated at a
table with our backs to the fireplace and
facing the long windows overlooking
the Bay. The dining room's soft lighting
is ideal for a romantic meal, and also
enables customers to appreciate the
distant city lights.
Choosing from an ample selection of
(mostlv Californian) wines, we ordered
a bottle of Beaulieu Pinot Chardonnay
($11.50), one of the lower-priced op
tions, that was pleasingly dry and light
bodied. Our jovial waiter gave us fresh
bread and sweet butter to snack on, and
offered detailed descriptionsof the var
ious menu selections.
We began with a Fettucine Parmesan
appetizer ($5.50), which was served in
two sizeable portions. This was quite
possibly the best fettucine I have ever
eaten; the sauce was sinfully rich and
cheesey, with hints of wine and spices.
One order easily satisfied both of us,
and could be a complete dinner for
one.
I should mention here the Red Beans
and Rice appetizer ($3.75) which I
tasted later in the kitchen on the chef's
insistence; this Creole specialty thick
with hot sausage and beans is a wonder
fully spicy dish that is highly recom
mended — and I'm told is especially
good with beer. Other appetizers in

dude Esc argot Burguinone, Calamari
Vinaigrette, Shrimp Remoulade, and
more, all ranging between $2.50 and
$5.50.
While dinner entrees include soup
and salad, large salads for two are also
available: a Spinach Salad with hot
bacon or a Caesar Salad, for $5.50. The
carrot soup, served graciously in
porcelain turreens with lids, was a love
ly mustard-color, deliciously smooth
and delicatel\ spiced. Our salads of
butter lettuce and tomato wedges were
served with a creamy Caesar-type dress
ing and topped with freshly ground
pepper. (The Butter Lettuce salad can
be ordered separately — to accompany
an order of fettucine, for example — for
$2J

The Skywood Chateau is
a quietly classy
establishment
committed to
outstanding food,
pleasant and attentive
service / a relaxing
atmosphere...

The Skywood Chateau's menu is
broadly European in scope, with an
added dimension of Creole dishes.
Audrey Pickard, who at 24 is remarkably
young for a head chef, explains the
Creole emphasis as a reflection of her
New Or leans-style cooking ex
periences in Haiti and Martinique;
Pickard is also continuing to prepare
(and adapt) many of the Cajun special
ties of her predecessor.
Entrees range in price from $8.50 for
Breast of Chicken Cajun (with lemon,
white wine and garlic) to $14.95 for
Tournedos of Veal (with mushroom and
bearnaise sauce). My companion or
dered the Veal Carbonara ($11.95)
while I selected one of the evening spe

cials, Halibut a la Vert. The Veal
Carbonara was a masterpiece: ex
quisitely tender slices of veal bathed in
a rich Bechamel sauce of wine, half
and-half, Gruyere cheese, bacon, on
ions and mushrooms. My nouvelle
cuisine halibut was as artistically pre
sented as it was delicious: the generous
portion of fish, topped with bread
crumbs and vermouth, was centered on
a dinner plate surrounded by a pale yel
low sauce of shallots, chardonnay,
chives, sweet butter, and fresh parsley.
Both of our entrees were accompanied
by a small, thinly-sliced potato and a
piece of very fresh broccoli covered
with an extraordinarily good New Or
leans-style blend of sour cream and
horseradish.
Perfection followed perfection as we
explored dessert; we sampled the
Grasshopper Pie ($1.50) and the
Almond Torte a la Mode ($2.25). The pie
was a tasty, ai., ireat of whipped cream
and creme de menthe on a chocolate
cookie crust. The torte was painfully de
licious — warm, meltingly sweet, and
exquisite with vanilla ice cream and a
highly recommended splurge. Other
dessert offerings include Bread Pud
ding with whiskey sauce, Walnut Pie,
Chocolate Mousse (all are $1.50 each).
Or for those with more exotic dessert
tastes, Bananas Flambe, Crepes Suzette,
and Strawberries Flambe are available
in orders for two ($6.50 per order).
According to owner and founder
Ralph Oswald, the Skywood Chateau
was opened 29 years ago and featured
charcoal-broiled hamburgers. Today,
its high-beamed ceiling and warm fire
place reflect a quietly classy estab
lishment committed to outstanding
food, pleasant and attentive service,
and a relaxing atmosphere.
If you're looking for an excuse to take
a picturesque drive up to Skyline
Boulevard, dinner at the Skywood
Chateau is one of the best reasons I can
imagine.
