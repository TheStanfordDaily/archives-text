A Clockwork Orange ****
Tonight, Cubberley
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell isthe"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
lim down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.

Children of Paradise****
Tuesday, Bishop Auditorium
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
wore sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming
took place. Marcel Carne
directed from a script by the poet
Jacques Prevert. Jean touis Bar
rault stars as a mime in love with a
beautiful society woman, played
by Arletty.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday.

On Golden Pond *
Park, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who manages to retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's bac kflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
ail costs.

Excalibur***
Saturday, Cubberley
By turns magnificent and pre
posterous, luminous a n d
opaque, this film of the Arthurian
legend is a tribute to director
John Boorman's freakish talent.
Bad writing wars with classical,
painterly tableau battles and
scenes in which the fairy-tale
grandeur of the movie catches us
up in the romantic whirl of the
story. The acting is highly vari
able: Nicol Williamson is a hu
morous, exuberant Merlin; Paul
Geoffrey plays Sir Percival feel
ingly; Helen Mirren, as Morgana,
has some high witchy moments;
and most of the other principals
are dwarfed by the stature of the
characters they are playing,
though Nigel Terry reads Arthur's
lines well — even movingly.

Palo Alto Square
Jane Fonda produced and Alan
Pakula directed this "interna
tional" thriller. It's bad in unex
pected ways — I don't think I've
ever seen a movie vary in tone so
much from scene to scene. Some
times it's a brittle love story about
a wealthy widow (Fonda) and her
financier lover (Kris Kristof
ferson), and sometimes it's a tale
of shadv bank dealings which
threaten to devastate the world
economy. When an attempt is
made to bring the two plots to

Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This is, by all acceptable stan

taken from a slight novella by
Truman Capote, one of his "but

Fdwards, never able to let well
enough alone, tried to turn
Capote's sketch into a parable.
What should have been a
winsome, romantic tale became a

play. It is only fitting that George
Peppard, whose only talent is for
serious gazes, plays the male lead
(a struggling young author — re
ally); but Audrey Hepburn, one
of the simplest of actresses, gets
smothered. Hepburn is wonder

Jack Nicholson plays the detec

There are no "good" characters

John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol

the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap

tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances —especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.

Old Mill, Mountain View
The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by its students to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writers shift ge.us
to manipulate our emotions
With Timothy Mutton as the cadet
major who leads the move and
George C. Scott, who has never

Montenegro
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan Anspach stars in this
pointless Swedish production
about a frustrated housewife who
t.ikes up with a band of free-lov
ing Yugoslavs who strive to show
her how life should really be
lived. She's too messed up to go
for it A and so's the movie. Mon
tenegro, in case > >u're wonder

she has an affair with. No, I don't
know why they named the movie
after him. (For weeks I thought
this was a movie about a Carib

right, though — Montenegro is
the name of the place that movies
go when they die.)

Pennies from Heaven****
Belmont Theater, Belmont
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s. This is a mov
ie of incredible emotional in
tensity, written by Dennis Potter
and shot and designed in the style
oi Edward Hopper.

Fox, Redwood City
Alan Alda created and stars in
this political meller about a politi

promising his beliefs. Barbara
Harris piays his understanding
wife; Meryl Streep plays the
woman who helps lead him down
the path to political anxiety. It's
not a very good movie, although
streep manages to bring some
life to her role. Alda and Harris
are perfectly matched: they both
leave a blur where their charac

The Woman Next Door *#'2
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a
house next door to Bernard's.
This variation on Noel Coward's
Private l ives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been .1 first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Srdant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
(linches - it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadroplegic and
sues for the right to be allowed to
die. Richard Dreyfuss struggles
manfully with an impossible role
that he isn't really right for: he
isn't a physical enough actor to
suggest, in the pre-accident and
flashback dream sequences, that
the loss of his hands has really
rendered life useless for him.

By turns magnificent and pre

John Boorman's freakish talent.
Bad writing wars with classical,
painterly tableau battles and
scenes in which the fairy-tale
grandeur of the movie catches us
up in the romantic whirl of the
story. The acting is highly vari
able: Nicol Williamson is a hu
morous, exuberant Merlin; Paul
Geoffrey plays Sir Percival feel
ingly; Helen Mirren, as Morgana,

and most of the other principals
are dwarfed by the stature of the

Breakfast at Tiffany's**
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This is, by all acceptable stan

taken from a slight novella by
Truman Capote, one of his "but
tercup" book's; director Blake
Fdwards, never able to let well
enough alone, tried to turn
Capote's sketch into a parable.
What should have been a
winsome, romantic tale became a
plodding, melodramatic morality
play. It is only fitting that George
Peppard, whose only talent is for
serious gazes, plays the male lead
(a struggling young author — re
ally); but Audrey Hepburn, one
of the simplest of actresses, gets
smothered. Hepburn is wonder
ful to watch when menaced from
without, but when, as here, the
demons must come from within,
she falters — she cannot con
vince us that there is anything ma

gamine-like features.

Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af

if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur

a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv

one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell isthe"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
lim down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the

The Woman Next Door *#'2
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Bernard (Gerard Depardieu)
and Mathilde (Fanny Ardant) are
ex-lovers, both now married,
who resume their former passion
when fate moves Mathilde into a
house next door to Bernard's.
This variation on Noel Coward's
Private l ives has an extra comic
romantic kicker — these two are
so completely engrossed in their
desire that they destroy them
selves with it — and it could have
been .1 first-rate movie, but the
dialogue is frustratingly earth
bound and the direction rarely
moves beyond banality. The best
thing about the movie is Fanny
Srdant, whose unusual looks
hold the camera, as does the in
tensity of her acting, which is full
of high spots and yet never quite
(linches - it's more the promise
of a wonderful performance.

A Clockwork Orange ****
Tonight, Cubberley
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell isthe"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
lim down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
— Jim Mattson
Children of Paradise****
Tuesday, Bishop Auditorium
Romanticism has acquired a
bad name in movies; it's been too
much associated with treacly
weepers that are more irritating
than moving. But Children of Par
adise, set in the world of the thea
ter in nineteenth-century France,
manages to achieve that rare
blend of sentiment, lushness, and
intelligence — it seduces the
viewer, beautifully.
Incredibly, it was made in the
midst of the Nazi occupation of
France; some of its performers
wore sought by the Gestapo and
had to be concealed as filming
took place. Marcel Carne
directed from a script by the poet
Jacques Prevert. Jean touis Bar
rault stars as a mime in love with a
beautiful society woman, played
by Arletty.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday.

On Golden Pond *
Park, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who manages to retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's bac kflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
ail costs.
— Steve Vineberg

Excalibur***
Saturday, Cubberley
By turns magnificent and pre
posterous, luminous a n d
opaque, this film of the Arthurian
legend is a tribute to director
John Boorman's freakish talent.
Bad writing wars with classical,
painterly tableau battles and
scenes in which the fairy-tale
grandeur of the movie catches us
up in the romantic whirl of the
story. The acting is highly vari
able: Nicol Williamson is a hu
morous, exuberant Merlin; Paul
Geoffrey plays Sir Percival feel
ingly; Helen Mirren, as Morgana,
has some high witchy moments;
and most of the other principals
are dwarfed by the stature of the
characters they are playing,
though Nigel Terry reads Arthur's
lines well — even movingly.

Rollover *
Palo Alto Square
Jane Fonda produced and Alan
Pakula directed this "interna
tional" thriller. It's bad in unex
pected ways — I don't think I've
ever seen a movie vary in tone so
much from scene to scene. Some
times it's a brittle love story about
a wealthy widow (Fonda) and her
financier lover (Kris Kristof
ferson), and sometimes it's a tale
of shadv bank dealings which
threaten to devastate the world
economy. When an attempt is
made to bring the two plots to
gi'therat the end in a bizarre hap
pv postscript to a disaster movie
dimax, the movie self-destructs.
It's like trying to make change
from a quarter by blasting it with
a shotgun.

Reds ***'/2
Palo Alto Square
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Bcatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are Jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton »%.Ernma Goldman.

Breakfast at Tiffany's**
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This is, by all acceptable stan
dards, a mediocre movie. It was
taken from a slight novella by
Truman Capote, one of his "but
tercup" book's; director Blake
Fdwards, never able to let well
enough alone, tried to turn
Capote's sketch into a parable.
What should have been a
winsome, romantic tale became a
plodding, melodramatic morality
play. It is only fitting that George
Peppard, whose only talent is for
serious gazes, plays the male lead
(a struggling young author — re
ally); but Audrey Hepburn, one
of the simplest of actresses, gets
smothered. Hepburn is wonder
ful to watch when menaced from
without, but when, as here, the
demons must come from within,
she falters — she cannot con
vince us that there is anything ma
lignant lurking behind her
gamine-like features.
Plays through Wednesday with
Funny Face, starring Hepburn
and Fred Astaire.

Chinatown ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski directed this
fine, violent, nightmarish evoca
tion of the '30s Los Angeles un
derworld. Faye Dunaway plays a
woman who has a terrible secret.
Jack Nicholson plays the detec
tive wh mOst help hf*r. Both per
formers give astounding per
formances. Nicholson, especial
ly, makes us feel the un
wholesomeness that accom
panies this Californian wasteland.
There are no "good" characters
in this film; they are all predators
or, at best, not particularly sym
pathetic victims. Polanski brings
out the worst in all of us; his gen
ius is a disturbingly bitter one.
Tonight only with True Con
fessions.

True Confessions***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Gregory Dunne and Joan
Didion adapted Dunne's novel,
which has its roots in the urban
melodrama that came out of Hol
lywood in the '30s and '40s. Like
the book, the movie lacks focus;
the murder mystery is carelessly
plotted, the wrap-up is disap
pointing, and the relationship be
tween the two brothers, Tommy
and Desmond Spellacy (a cop and
a priest) is never moved into the
foreground. The director, Ulu
Grosbard, doesn't have a very
good film sense, but he does have
a gift for working with actors, and
all the performances —especially
those of Robert Duvall, Robert
De Niro and Charles Durning —
are so good that the movie may
bring you to tears, despite its
weaknesses.
Tonight only, with Chinatown.

Taps *
Old Mill, Mountain View
The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by its students to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writers shift ge.us
to manipulate our emotions
With Timothy Mutton as the cadet
major who leads the move and
George C. Scott, who has never
been worse, as a half-c racked old
general.

Montenegro
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan Anspach stars in this
pointless Swedish production
about a frustrated housewife who
t.ikes up with a band of free-lov
ing Yugoslavs who strive to show
her how life should really be
lived. She's too messed up to go
for it A and so's the movie. Mon
tenegro, in case > >u're wonder
ing, is the name of the Yugoslav
she has an affair with. No, I don't
know why they named the movie
after him. (For weeks I thought
this was a movie about a Carib
bean resort. It looks like I was
right, though — Montenegro is
the name of the place that movies
go when they die.)
