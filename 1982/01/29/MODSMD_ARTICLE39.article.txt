others before he was slain in a duel with police, authorities

mont Mis wife, Orlinda, was wounded in both legs.
•Mso wounded was a police officer and a vice president of
Mission Insurance Co., in whose offices the shootings oc
curred.

Reagan to increase El Salvador aid
Washington — President Ronald Reagan told Congress
yesterday that the El Salvador government's human rights
record entitles it to receive U.S. aid, and the State Depart
ment said it is urgently studying the need to increase as
sistance to the regime there following an attack by leftist
guerrillas \\ ednesday on the country's main military air base.
These actions set the stage for a potentially major new bat
tle between the administration and congressional liberals,
who contend that the military-civilian regime headed by
President Jose \apoleon Duarte continues to systematically
vlolate human rights.
Reagan's declaration, in the form of a certification to Con
gress, clears the way for the administration to disburse $26
million in military assistance allotted for El Salvador under
the fiscal 1982 foreign aid bill. In passing the legislation last
month Congress attached a provision requiring the presi
lenr to certify that the Salvadoran government was ending
rights abuses and making progress toward political and eco
nomic reform.
In his certification, Reagan concluded that the Duarte re
g me has made a concerted, significant and good faith ef
fort to deal with the complex political, social and human
rights problems it is confronting and that progress is being
made."
Reagan's contention came in a week that saw the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups ac
cuse Salvadoran authorities of continuing repression — in
cluding allegedly being responsible for the murder of 12,501
persons during 1981.
Haig names Mideast "expediter"
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State Alexander Haig, plung
ing deeply into the intricate details of the Middle East peace
process, brought on stage yesterday a U.S. official touted as
an "expediter" for the snarled Palestinian autonomy talks
between Egypt and Israel.
In back-to-back trips to Jerusalem and Cairo — his second
Middle East shuttle in two weeks — Haig planted some spe
cific ideas he hopes will narrow the "many differences" in
the positions of the two countries and revive deadlocked au
tonomy negotiations on the future of the 1.3 million Palesti
nians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and Gaza Strip.
Haig made clear here and in Jerusalem that only a few for
malities stand in the way of the appointment of Richard Fair
banks, a lawyer and campaign supporter of President Ronald
Reagan, as his special assistant to press for progress in the au
tonomy talks.
Fairbanks, a 40-year-old Indiana lawyer, most recently was
the assistant secretary of state for congressional relations.
Index indicates economic upswing
Washington — A key government gauge of future eco
nomic health was reported on the upswing for the first time
since Julv, and analysts agreed yesterday that an end to the
recession, if not at hand, is coming into focus.

The Commerce Department said its index ot leading in
dicators was up 0.6 percent for December, and that was
hailed as good news bv Reagan administration officials and
private economists alike.
Thev said the report means the national economs is likely
to begin substantial recovery before long and one even said
the process may well be under way right now.
But less-encouraging news showed up yesterday in a trio
of other reports in which:
— The Labor Department said productivity in private busi
ness fell at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the final three
months of last year as the recession clamped down — the
biggest drop since the government began keeping such fig
ures in 1947 — and productiv itv was down 0.1 percent for all
of 1981.
— \ preliminary version of Congressional Budget Office
figures said the economy as a whole will decline for a third
straight year in 1982 rather than expanding slightly as the ad
ministration is forecasting. It also said unemployment would
average a high 8.9 percent after rising above that level early
in the year.
— \nd the Commerce Department was releasing foreign
trade figures expected to show a 1981 merchandise trade def
icit well above the previous vear's $36.4 billion.
UAW/GM contract talks break down
Detroit — Emergency contract talks between the United
•Xuto Workers union and General Motors Corp. fell apart last
night over job security and other issues, UAW President
Douglas Fraser said.
Fraser announced the breakdown of negotiations about
11 30 p.m. after a 14-hour bargaining session that wrapped
up nearly three weeks of contract talks.
It just didn't go together," Fraser said. "It's over."
The breakdown, announced 30 minutes before a union
imposed deadline for negotiations, means contract talks be
tween the union and the nation's No. 1 automaker will not
resume until Julv, the traditional rime for auto negotiations.
Current contracts expire Sept. 14.
Negotiations began Jan. 11 at GM's request. The auto
maker asked for wage and benefit concessions from the
union in hopes of cutting labor costs that would enable it to
become more competitive with foreign carmakers.
In exchange, the union sought jobsecurity guarantees and
an end to the purchase by GM of parts and components from
overseas manufacturers.
Earlier yesterday, Owen Bieber, a UAW vice president and
head of the union s GM department, had said union officials
were becoming "increasingly concerned as the midnight
deadline approaches."
The end of negotiations kills GM's promise, made Jan. 12,
that all union concessions resulting from a new agreement
would be passed on to consumers in the form of car-price
reductions.
"We are deeply disappointed," Alfred Warren, GM vice
president for industrial relations, said. "The idea was a very
exciting one."
Fraser said negotiations broke down over a variety of is
sues, especially jobsecurity and equality of sacrifice between
UAY\ members and other GM employees.
"Unless all these pieces come together in negotiations,
nothing comes together," Fraser said. "The economics just
didn't come together."
CIA accused of espionage in Poland
Warsaw — In what appeared to be part of a major propa
ganda drive, the military authorities here accused the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency yesterday of manipulating the inde
pendent trade union federation Solidarity and conducting
extensive espionage operations against Poland.
The allegations of U.S. undercover activity were made at
an unprecedented press conference here for foreign jour
nalists by a senior official in Polish counterintelligence, Col.
Zbigniew Wislocki. At the same time, the state television
started screening a five-part series devoted to documenta
tion of alleged American espionage in Poland.
Wislocki said the CI A had attempted for many years to re
cruit Polish citizens in sensitive positions as informers and
has stepped up its activities since Solidarity's emergence in
August 1980. He named several alleged CIA agents who had
served under diplomatic cover either in Warsaw or other for
eign capitals.
Foreign journalists were shown a number of special de
vices that allegedly were used by U.S. intelligence operatives
in Poland. The exhibits included codes, radio receivers,
pellets of invisible ink (hidden in the handle of a shaving
brush) and secret instructions to agents written on special
paper that would dissolve in water.

Reagan to scrap CETA
Washington — fhe Reagan administration will ask Con
gress to scrap the Comprehensive Employment and Training
\ct and adopt a new program that puts more emphasis on
job preparation by business, labor unions and local govern
ment, a Department of Labor official said yesterday.
I nder the proposal, the federal government no longer
would dominate the training process said Albert Angrisani,
assistant secretary of labor, in an interview.
V\e feel the new program will provide for a long-term,
transition of training activities from the federal level to a
privatelv run system," he said.
"It (the federal government) is now the engine of these
programs — we want it to be the rudder."
The administration will ask for less than the $3.8 billion
spent tor CETA programs in the current fiscal year, Angrisani
said, but he declined to give the exact amount that will be
sought in President Ronald Reagan's new budget on Feb. 8.
Turkish diplomat assassinated in L.A.
Los Angeles — Turkish Consul General Kemal Arikan was
assassinated yesterday morning by a gunman who riddled his
car with bullets as he drove alone on a busy Los Angeles
street.
\ group calling itself the justice Commandos of the Arme
nian Genocide took responsibility for the shooting in tele
phone calls to news wire services.
Arikan, 52, and his predecessors have been the targets of
bombers and assassins purporting to be Armenians seeking
retribution for a massacre at the hands of Turks in 1915.
Witnesses said Arikan was driving in his consular corps car
near the Los Angeles Country Club when one of two
gunmen opened fire with a handgun. Six bullets punctured
the car door on the driver's side and Arikan was shot in the
face, head and chest.
As he slumped in his seat, the car struck two other cars and
then crashed into a eucalyptus tree. The drivers of the other
cars were slightly injured.
Testimony heard on school taxation
Washington — Civil libertarians told Congress yesterday
that President Ronald Reagan has no authority to end an 11-
year-old government policy denying tax exemptions to seg
regated private schools.
Witnesses for the NAACP and Common Cause accused
Reagan of appearing to circumvent the laws in order to grant
special political favors to two conservative schools that have
been found to discriminate.
"The federal tax laws now on the books have been in
terpreted by every federal appellate court which has con
sidered the issue as prohibiting federal tax exemption bene
fits for schools with racially discriminatory policies," said M.
Carr Ferguson, who headed the Justice Department's Tax
Division during the Carter administration.
Meanwhile, 28 senators of varying political persuasion in
troduced a resolution expressing the view that the Internal
Revenue Service has all the authority it needs to deny ex
emptions to discriminatory schools.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), one of the 28, said that passing a
new law, as Reagan wants, might cloud the intent of the
sweeping 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits government
aid to such schools.
At the FHouse hearing, E. Richard Larson, counsel for the
American Civil liberties Union, rejected Reagan's conten
tion that there is no basis in law for the IRS to deny tax ex
emptions for schools that discriminate.
'The president is wrong," Larson told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. The Constitution, the
1964 Civil Rights Act and various court rulings compel "the
Reagan administration to deny tax-exempt status to all racial
ly discriminatory private schools," he said.
Dow Jones shows 10-month high gain
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 21.59 to
864.25, for its biggest gain since it rose 22.15 last March 12.

sult of a buildup of buying interest after the market's steady
decline in recent weeks.

Negotiations began Jan. 11 at GM's request. The auto
maker asked for wage and benefit concessions from the
union in hopes of cutting labor costs that would enable it to
become more competitive with foreign carmakers.
In exchange, the union sought jobsecurity guarantees and
an end to the purchase by GM of parts and components from
overseas manufacturers.
Earlier yesterday, Owen Bieber, a UAW vice president and
head of the union s GM department, had said union officials
were becoming "increasingly concerned as the midnight
deadline approaches."
The end of negotiations kills GM's promise, made Jan. 12,
that all union concessions resulting from a new agreement
would be passed on to consumers in the form of car-price
reductions.
"We are deeply disappointed," Alfred Warren, GM vice
president for industrial relations, said. "The idea was a very
exciting one."
Fraser said negotiations broke down over a variety of is
sues, especially jobsecurity and equality of sacrifice between
UAY\ members and other GM employees.
"Unless all these pieces come together in negotiations,
nothing comes together," Fraser said. "The economics just
didn't come together."
CIA accused of espionage in Poland
Warsaw — In what appeared to be part of a major propa
ganda drive, the military authorities here accused the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency yesterday of manipulating the inde
pendent trade union federation Solidarity and conducting
extensive espionage operations against Poland.
The allegations of U.S. undercover activity were made at
an unprecedented press conference here for foreign jour
nalists by a senior official in Polish counterintelligence, Col.
Zbigniew Wislocki. At the same time, the state television
started screening a five-part series devoted to documenta
tion of alleged American espionage in Poland.
Wislocki said the CI A had attempted for many years to re
cruit Polish citizens in sensitive positions as informers and
has stepped up its activities since Solidarity's emergence in
August 1980. He named several alleged CIA agents who had
served under diplomatic cover either in Warsaw or other for
eign capitals.
Foreign journalists were shown a number of special de
vices that allegedly were used by U.S. intelligence operatives
in Poland. The exhibits included codes, radio receivers,
pellets of invisible ink (hidden in the handle of a shaving
brush) and secret instructions to agents written on special
paper that would dissolve in water.

Reagan to scrap CETA
Washington — fhe Reagan administration will ask Con
gress to scrap the Comprehensive Employment and Training
\ct and adopt a new program that puts more emphasis on
job preparation by business, labor unions and local govern
ment, a Department of Labor official said yesterday.
I nder the proposal, the federal government no longer
would dominate the training process said Albert Angrisani,
assistant secretary of labor, in an interview.
V\e feel the new program will provide for a long-term,
transition of training activities from the federal level to a
privatelv run system," he said.
"It (the federal government) is now the engine of these
programs — we want it to be the rudder."
The administration will ask for less than the $3.8 billion
spent tor CETA programs in the current fiscal year, Angrisani
said, but he declined to give the exact amount that will be
sought in President Ronald Reagan's new budget on Feb. 8.
Turkish diplomat assassinated in L.A.
Los Angeles — Turkish Consul General Kemal Arikan was
assassinated yesterday morning by a gunman who riddled his
car with bullets as he drove alone on a busy Los Angeles
street.
\ group calling itself the justice Commandos of the Arme
nian Genocide took responsibility for the shooting in tele
phone calls to news wire services.
Arikan, 52, and his predecessors have been the targets of
bombers and assassins purporting to be Armenians seeking
retribution for a massacre at the hands of Turks in 1915.
Witnesses said Arikan was driving in his consular corps car
near the Los Angeles Country Club when one of two
gunmen opened fire with a handgun. Six bullets punctured
the car door on the driver's side and Arikan was shot in the
face, head and chest.
As he slumped in his seat, the car struck two other cars and
then crashed into a eucalyptus tree. The drivers of the other
cars were slightly injured.
Testimony heard on school taxation
Washington — Civil libertarians told Congress yesterday
that President Ronald Reagan has no authority to end an 11-
year-old government policy denying tax exemptions to seg
regated private schools.
Witnesses for the NAACP and Common Cause accused
Reagan of appearing to circumvent the laws in order to grant
special political favors to two conservative schools that have
been found to discriminate.
"The federal tax laws now on the books have been in
terpreted by every federal appellate court which has con
sidered the issue as prohibiting federal tax exemption bene
fits for schools with racially discriminatory policies," said M.
Carr Ferguson, who headed the Justice Department's Tax
Division during the Carter administration.
Meanwhile, 28 senators of varying political persuasion in
troduced a resolution expressing the view that the Internal
Revenue Service has all the authority it needs to deny ex
emptions to discriminatory schools.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), one of the 28, said that passing a
new law, as Reagan wants, might cloud the intent of the
sweeping 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits government
aid to such schools.
At the FHouse hearing, E. Richard Larson, counsel for the
American Civil liberties Union, rejected Reagan's conten
tion that there is no basis in law for the IRS to deny tax ex
emptions for schools that discriminate.
'The president is wrong," Larson told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. The Constitution, the
1964 Civil Rights Act and various court rulings compel "the

Three dead in S.F. shooting
San Francisco — A man stalking his estranged wife with a
12-gauge shotgun opened fire in a financial district highrise
building yesterday, killing two people and wounding nine
others before he was slain in a duel with police, authorities
said.
Police identified the man as Ricardo Contawe, 36, of Fre
mont Mis wife, Orlinda, was wounded in both legs.
•Mso wounded was a police officer and a vice president of
Mission Insurance Co., in whose offices the shootings oc
curred.
vgt Mike Pera said two men died when Contawe began
shooting shortly before 4 p.m. on the 18th floor of one of two
towers at One Market Plaza. He smuggled the pump shotgun
into the 42-story building in a long flower box, officers said.
( in taw e began shooting on the 18th floor, where his wife
of almost 20 \ears was employed. He then sprinted down a
stairwell to the 17th floor, wounding two people on the stairs
and continuing to fire on that floor.
Pera said the man was killed in a shootout with three of
ficers one of whom was wounded by a ricocheting frag
ment From the time the shooting erupted to the time police
arrive i, 10 minutes had elapsed, Pera said.
It was some kind ot family feud," he said. The Contawes
have two teen-age children.
I ight people were admitted at Mission Emergency, and
hospital spokeswoman Linda DeLaysla said three were in
ritual condition. Seven suffered gunshot wounds and one
was injured by flying glass.
Reagan to increase El Salvador aid
Washington — President Ronald Reagan told Congress
yesterday that the El Salvador government's human rights
record entitles it to receive U.S. aid, and the State Depart
ment said it is urgently studying the need to increase as
sistance to the regime there following an attack by leftist
guerrillas \\ ednesday on the country's main military air base.
These actions set the stage for a potentially major new bat
tle between the administration and congressional liberals,
who contend that the military-civilian regime headed by
President Jose \apoleon Duarte continues to systematically
vlolate human rights.
Reagan's declaration, in the form of a certification to Con
gress, clears the way for the administration to disburse $26
million in military assistance allotted for El Salvador under
the fiscal 1982 foreign aid bill. In passing the legislation last
month Congress attached a provision requiring the presi
lenr to certify that the Salvadoran government was ending
rights abuses and making progress toward political and eco
nomic reform.
In his certification, Reagan concluded that the Duarte re
g me has made a concerted, significant and good faith ef
fort to deal with the complex political, social and human
rights problems it is confronting and that progress is being
made."
Reagan's contention came in a week that saw the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups ac
cuse Salvadoran authorities of continuing repression — in
cluding allegedly being responsible for the murder of 12,501
persons during 1981.
Haig names Mideast "expediter"
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State Alexander Haig, plung
ing deeply into the intricate details of the Middle East peace
process, brought on stage yesterday a U.S. official touted as
an "expediter" for the snarled Palestinian autonomy talks
between Egypt and Israel.
In back-to-back trips to Jerusalem and Cairo — his second
Middle East shuttle in two weeks — Haig planted some spe
cific ideas he hopes will narrow the "many differences" in
the positions of the two countries and revive deadlocked au
tonomy negotiations on the future of the 1.3 million Palesti
nians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and Gaza Strip.
Haig made clear here and in Jerusalem that only a few for
malities stand in the way of the appointment of Richard Fair
banks, a lawyer and campaign supporter of President Ronald
Reagan, as his special assistant to press for progress in the au
tonomy talks.
Fairbanks, a 40-year-old Indiana lawyer, most recently was
the assistant secretary of state for congressional relations.
Index indicates economic upswing
Washington — A key government gauge of future eco
nomic health was reported on the upswing for the first time
since Julv, and analysts agreed yesterday that an end to the
recession, if not at hand, is coming into focus.

The Commerce Department said its index ot leading in
dicators was up 0.6 percent for December, and that was
hailed as good news bv Reagan administration officials and
private economists alike.
Thev said the report means the national economs is likely
to begin substantial recovery before long and one even said
the process may well be under way right now.
But less-encouraging news showed up yesterday in a trio
of other reports in which:
— The Labor Department said productivity in private busi
ness fell at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the final three
months of last year as the recession clamped down — the
biggest drop since the government began keeping such fig
ures in 1947 — and productiv itv was down 0.1 percent for all
of 1981.
— \ preliminary version of Congressional Budget Office
figures said the economy as a whole will decline for a third
straight year in 1982 rather than expanding slightly as the ad
ministration is forecasting. It also said unemployment would
average a high 8.9 percent after rising above that level early
in the year.
— \nd the Commerce Department was releasing foreign
trade figures expected to show a 1981 merchandise trade def
icit well above the previous vear's $36.4 billion.
UAW/GM contract talks break down
Detroit — Emergency contract talks between the United
•Xuto Workers union and General Motors Corp. fell apart last
night over job security and other issues, UAW President
Douglas Fraser said.
Fraser announced the breakdown of negotiations about
11 30 p.m. after a 14-hour bargaining session that wrapped
up nearly three weeks of contract talks.
It just didn't go together," Fraser said. "It's over."
The breakdown, announced 30 minutes before a union
imposed deadline for negotiations, means contract talks be
tween the union and the nation's No. 1 automaker will not
resume until Julv, the traditional rime for auto negotiations.
Current contracts expire Sept. 14.
Negotiations began Jan. 11 at GM's request. The auto
maker asked for wage and benefit concessions from the
union in hopes of cutting labor costs that would enable it to
become more competitive with foreign carmakers.
In exchange, the union sought jobsecurity guarantees and
an end to the purchase by GM of parts and components from
overseas manufacturers.
Earlier yesterday, Owen Bieber, a UAW vice president and

San Francisco — A man stalking his estranged wife with a
12-gauge shotgun opened fire in a financial district highrise

others before he was slain in a duel with police, authorities
said.
Police identified the man as Ricardo Contawe, 36, of Fre
mont Mis wife, Orlinda, was wounded in both legs.
•Mso wounded was a police officer and a vice president of
Mission Insurance Co., in whose offices the shootings oc
curred.
vgt Mike Pera said two men died when Contawe began
shooting shortly before 4 p.m. on the 18th floor of one of two
towers at One Market Plaza. He smuggled the pump shotgun
into the 42-story building in a long flower box, officers said.

Reagan to increase El Salvador aid
Washington — President Ronald Reagan told Congress
yesterday that the El Salvador government's human rights
record entitles it to receive U.S. aid, and the State Depart
ment said it is urgently studying the need to increase as
sistance to the regime there following an attack by leftist
guerrillas \\ ednesday on the country's main military air base.
These actions set the stage for a potentially major new bat
tle between the administration and congressional liberals,
who contend that the military-civilian regime headed by
President Jose \apoleon Duarte continues to systematically
vlolate human rights.
Reagan's declaration, in the form of a certification to Con
gress, clears the way for the administration to disburse $26
million in military assistance allotted for El Salvador under
the fiscal 1982 foreign aid bill. In passing the legislation last
month Congress attached a provision requiring the presi
lenr to certify that the Salvadoran government was ending
rights abuses and making progress toward political and eco
nomic reform.
In his certification, Reagan concluded that the Duarte re
g me has made a concerted, significant and good faith ef
fort to deal with the complex political, social and human
rights problems it is confronting and that progress is being
made."
Reagan's contention came in a week that saw the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups ac
cuse Salvadoran authorities of continuing repression — in
cluding allegedly being responsible for the murder of 12,501
persons during 1981.
Haig names Mideast "expediter"
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State Alexander Haig, plung
ing deeply into the intricate details of the Middle East peace
process, brought on stage yesterday a U.S. official touted as
an "expediter" for the snarled Palestinian autonomy talks
between Egypt and Israel.
In back-to-back trips to Jerusalem and Cairo — his second
Middle East shuttle in two weeks — Haig planted some spe
cific ideas he hopes will narrow the "many differences" in
the positions of the two countries and revive deadlocked au
tonomy negotiations on the future of the 1.3 million Palesti
nians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and Gaza Strip.
Haig made clear here and in Jerusalem that only a few for
malities stand in the way of the appointment of Richard Fair
banks, a lawyer and campaign supporter of President Ronald
Reagan, as his special assistant to press for progress in the au
tonomy talks.
Fairbanks, a 40-year-old Indiana lawyer, most recently was
the assistant secretary of state for congressional relations.
Index indicates economic upswing
Washington — A key government gauge of future eco
nomic health was reported on the upswing for the first time
since Julv, and analysts agreed yesterday that an end to the
recession, if not at hand, is coming into focus.

The Commerce Department said its index ot leading in
dicators was up 0.6 percent for December, and that was
hailed as good news bv Reagan administration officials and
private economists alike.
Thev said the report means the national economs is likely
to begin substantial recovery before long and one even said
the process may well be under way right now.
But less-encouraging news showed up yesterday in a trio
of other reports in which:
— The Labor Department said productivity in private busi
ness fell at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the final three
months of last year as the recession clamped down — the
biggest drop since the government began keeping such fig
ures in 1947 — and productiv itv was down 0.1 percent for all
of 1981.
— \ preliminary version of Congressional Budget Office
figures said the economy as a whole will decline for a third
straight year in 1982 rather than expanding slightly as the ad
ministration is forecasting. It also said unemployment would
average a high 8.9 percent after rising above that level early
in the year.
— \nd the Commerce Department was releasing foreign
trade figures expected to show a 1981 merchandise trade def
icit well above the previous vear's $36.4 billion.
UAW/GM contract talks break down
Detroit — Emergency contract talks between the United
•Xuto Workers union and General Motors Corp. fell apart last
night over job security and other issues, UAW President
Douglas Fraser said.
Fraser announced the breakdown of negotiations about
11 30 p.m. after a 14-hour bargaining session that wrapped
up nearly three weeks of contract talks.
It just didn't go together," Fraser said. "It's over."
The breakdown, announced 30 minutes before a union
imposed deadline for negotiations, means contract talks be
tween the union and the nation's No. 1 automaker will not
resume until Julv, the traditional rime for auto negotiations.
Current contracts expire Sept. 14.
Negotiations began Jan. 11 at GM's request. The auto
maker asked for wage and benefit concessions from the
union in hopes of cutting labor costs that would enable it to
become more competitive with foreign carmakers.
In exchange, the union sought jobsecurity guarantees and
an end to the purchase by GM of parts and components from
overseas manufacturers.
Earlier yesterday, Owen Bieber, a UAW vice president and
head of the union s GM department, had said union officials
were becoming "increasingly concerned as the midnight
deadline approaches."
The end of negotiations kills GM's promise, made Jan. 12,
that all union concessions resulting from a new agreement
would be passed on to consumers in the form of car-price
reductions.
"We are deeply disappointed," Alfred Warren, GM vice
president for industrial relations, said. "The idea was a very
exciting one."
Fraser said negotiations broke down over a variety of is
sues, especially jobsecurity and equality of sacrifice between
UAY\ members and other GM employees.
"Unless all these pieces come together in negotiations,
nothing comes together," Fraser said. "The economics just
didn't come together."
CIA accused of espionage in Poland
Warsaw — In what appeared to be part of a major propa
ganda drive, the military authorities here accused the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency yesterday of manipulating the inde
pendent trade union federation Solidarity and conducting
extensive espionage operations against Poland.
The allegations of U.S. undercover activity were made at
an unprecedented press conference here for foreign jour
nalists by a senior official in Polish counterintelligence, Col.
Zbigniew Wislocki. At the same time, the state television
started screening a five-part series devoted to documenta
tion of alleged American espionage in Poland.
Wislocki said the CI A had attempted for many years to re
cruit Polish citizens in sensitive positions as informers and
has stepped up its activities since Solidarity's emergence in
August 1980. He named several alleged CIA agents who had
served under diplomatic cover either in Warsaw or other for
eign capitals.
Foreign journalists were shown a number of special de
vices that allegedly were used by U.S. intelligence operatives
in Poland. The exhibits included codes, radio receivers,
pellets of invisible ink (hidden in the handle of a shaving
brush) and secret instructions to agents written on special
paper that would dissolve in water.

Reagan to scrap CETA
Washington — fhe Reagan administration will ask Con
gress to scrap the Comprehensive Employment and Training
\ct and adopt a new program that puts more emphasis on
job preparation by business, labor unions and local govern
ment, a Department of Labor official said yesterday.
I nder the proposal, the federal government no longer
would dominate the training process said Albert Angrisani,
assistant secretary of labor, in an interview.
V\e feel the new program will provide for a long-term,
transition of training activities from the federal level to a
privatelv run system," he said.
"It (the federal government) is now the engine of these
programs — we want it to be the rudder."
The administration will ask for less than the $3.8 billion
spent tor CETA programs in the current fiscal year, Angrisani
said, but he declined to give the exact amount that will be
sought in President Ronald Reagan's new budget on Feb. 8.
Turkish diplomat assassinated in L.A.
Los Angeles — Turkish Consul General Kemal Arikan was
assassinated yesterday morning by a gunman who riddled his
car with bullets as he drove alone on a busy Los Angeles
street.
\ group calling itself the justice Commandos of the Arme
nian Genocide took responsibility for the shooting in tele
phone calls to news wire services.
Arikan, 52, and his predecessors have been the targets of
bombers and assassins purporting to be Armenians seeking
retribution for a massacre at the hands of Turks in 1915.
Witnesses said Arikan was driving in his consular corps car
near the Los Angeles Country Club when one of two
gunmen opened fire with a handgun. Six bullets punctured
the car door on the driver's side and Arikan was shot in the
face, head and chest.
As he slumped in his seat, the car struck two other cars and
then crashed into a eucalyptus tree. The drivers of the other
cars were slightly injured.
Testimony heard on school taxation
Washington — Civil libertarians told Congress yesterday
that President Ronald Reagan has no authority to end an 11-
year-old government policy denying tax exemptions to seg
regated private schools.
Witnesses for the NAACP and Common Cause accused
Reagan of appearing to circumvent the laws in order to grant
special political favors to two conservative schools that have
been found to discriminate.
"The federal tax laws now on the books have been in
terpreted by every federal appellate court which has con
sidered the issue as prohibiting federal tax exemption bene
fits for schools with racially discriminatory policies," said M.
Carr Ferguson, who headed the Justice Department's Tax
Division during the Carter administration.
Meanwhile, 28 senators of varying political persuasion in
troduced a resolution expressing the view that the Internal
Revenue Service has all the authority it needs to deny ex
emptions to discriminatory schools.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), one of the 28, said that passing a
new law, as Reagan wants, might cloud the intent of the
sweeping 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits government
aid to such schools.
At the FHouse hearing, E. Richard Larson, counsel for the
American Civil liberties Union, rejected Reagan's conten
tion that there is no basis in law for the IRS to deny tax ex
emptions for schools that discriminate.
'The president is wrong," Larson told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. The Constitution, the
1964 Civil Rights Act and various court rulings compel "the
Reagan administration to deny tax-exempt status to all racial
ly discriminatory private schools," he said.

Fraser announced the breakdown of negotiations about
11 30 p.m. after a 14-hour bargaining session that wrapped
up nearly three weeks of contract talks.
It just didn't go together," Fraser said. "It's over."
The breakdown, announced 30 minutes before a union
imposed deadline for negotiations, means contract talks be
tween the union and the nation's No. 1 automaker will not
resume until Julv, the traditional rime for auto negotiations.
Current contracts expire Sept. 14.
Negotiations began Jan. 11 at GM's request. The auto
maker asked for wage and benefit concessions from the
union in hopes of cutting labor costs that would enable it to
become more competitive with foreign carmakers.
In exchange, the union sought jobsecurity guarantees and
an end to the purchase by GM of parts and components from
overseas manufacturers.
Earlier yesterday, Owen Bieber, a UAW vice president and
head of the union s GM department, had said union officials
were becoming "increasingly concerned as the midnight
deadline approaches."
The end of negotiations kills GM's promise, made Jan. 12,
that all union concessions resulting from a new agreement
would be passed on to consumers in the form of car-price
reductions.
"We are deeply disappointed," Alfred Warren, GM vice
president for industrial relations, said. "The idea was a very
exciting one."
Fraser said negotiations broke down over a variety of is
sues, especially jobsecurity and equality of sacrifice between
UAY\ members and other GM employees.
"Unless all these pieces come together in negotiations,
nothing comes together," Fraser said. "The economics just
didn't come together."
CIA accused of espionage in Poland
Warsaw — In what appeared to be part of a major propa
ganda drive, the military authorities here accused the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency yesterday of manipulating the inde
pendent trade union federation Solidarity and conducting
extensive espionage operations against Poland.
The allegations of U.S. undercover activity were made at
an unprecedented press conference here for foreign jour
nalists by a senior official in Polish counterintelligence, Col.
Zbigniew Wislocki. At the same time, the state television
started screening a five-part series devoted to documenta
tion of alleged American espionage in Poland.
Wislocki said the CI A had attempted for many years to re
cruit Polish citizens in sensitive positions as informers and
has stepped up its activities since Solidarity's emergence in
August 1980. He named several alleged CIA agents who had
served under diplomatic cover either in Warsaw or other for
eign capitals.
Foreign journalists were shown a number of special de
vices that allegedly were used by U.S. intelligence operatives
in Poland. The exhibits included codes, radio receivers,
pellets of invisible ink (hidden in the handle of a shaving
brush) and secret instructions to agents written on special
paper that would dissolve in water.

Reagan to scrap CETA
Washington — fhe Reagan administration will ask Con
gress to scrap the Comprehensive Employment and Training
\ct and adopt a new program that puts more emphasis on
job preparation by business, labor unions and local govern
ment, a Department of Labor official said yesterday.
I nder the proposal, the federal government no longer
would dominate the training process said Albert Angrisani,
assistant secretary of labor, in an interview.
V\e feel the new program will provide for a long-term,
transition of training activities from the federal level to a
privatelv run system," he said.
"It (the federal government) is now the engine of these
programs — we want it to be the rudder."
The administration will ask for less than the $3.8 billion
spent tor CETA programs in the current fiscal year, Angrisani
said, but he declined to give the exact amount that will be
sought in President Ronald Reagan's new budget on Feb. 8.
Turkish diplomat assassinated in L.A.
Los Angeles — Turkish Consul General Kemal Arikan was
assassinated yesterday morning by a gunman who riddled his
car with bullets as he drove alone on a busy Los Angeles
street.
\ group calling itself the justice Commandos of the Arme
nian Genocide took responsibility for the shooting in tele
phone calls to news wire services.
Arikan, 52, and his predecessors have been the targets of
bombers and assassins purporting to be Armenians seeking
retribution for a massacre at the hands of Turks in 1915.
Witnesses said Arikan was driving in his consular corps car
near the Los Angeles Country Club when one of two
gunmen opened fire with a handgun. Six bullets punctured
the car door on the driver's side and Arikan was shot in the
face, head and chest.
As he slumped in his seat, the car struck two other cars and
then crashed into a eucalyptus tree. The drivers of the other
cars were slightly injured.
Testimony heard on school taxation
Washington — Civil libertarians told Congress yesterday
that President Ronald Reagan has no authority to end an 11-
year-old government policy denying tax exemptions to seg
regated private schools.
Witnesses for the NAACP and Common Cause accused
Reagan of appearing to circumvent the laws in order to grant
special political favors to two conservative schools that have
been found to discriminate.
"The federal tax laws now on the books have been in
terpreted by every federal appellate court which has con
sidered the issue as prohibiting federal tax exemption bene
fits for schools with racially discriminatory policies," said M.
Carr Ferguson, who headed the Justice Department's Tax
Division during the Carter administration.
Meanwhile, 28 senators of varying political persuasion in
troduced a resolution expressing the view that the Internal
Revenue Service has all the authority it needs to deny ex
emptions to discriminatory schools.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), one of the 28, said that passing a
new law, as Reagan wants, might cloud the intent of the
sweeping 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits government
aid to such schools.
At the FHouse hearing, E. Richard Larson, counsel for the
American Civil liberties Union, rejected Reagan's conten
tion that there is no basis in law for the IRS to deny tax ex
emptions for schools that discriminate.
'The president is wrong," Larson told the House Judiciary
subcommittee on constitutional rights. The Constitution, the
1964 Civil Rights Act and various court rulings compel "the
Reagan administration to deny tax-exempt status to all racial
ly discriminatory private schools," he said.

Three dead in S.F. shooting
San Francisco — A man stalking his estranged wife with a
12-gauge shotgun opened fire in a financial district highrise
building yesterday, killing two people and wounding nine
others before he was slain in a duel with police, authorities
said.
Police identified the man as Ricardo Contawe, 36, of Fre
mont Mis wife, Orlinda, was wounded in both legs.
•Mso wounded was a police officer and a vice president of
Mission Insurance Co., in whose offices the shootings oc
curred.
vgt Mike Pera said two men died when Contawe began
shooting shortly before 4 p.m. on the 18th floor of one of two
towers at One Market Plaza. He smuggled the pump shotgun
into the 42-story building in a long flower box, officers said.
( in taw e began shooting on the 18th floor, where his wife
of almost 20 \ears was employed. He then sprinted down a
stairwell to the 17th floor, wounding two people on the stairs
and continuing to fire on that floor.
Pera said the man was killed in a shootout with three of
ficers one of whom was wounded by a ricocheting frag
ment From the time the shooting erupted to the time police
arrive i, 10 minutes had elapsed, Pera said.
It was some kind ot family feud," he said. The Contawes
have two teen-age children.
I ight people were admitted at Mission Emergency, and
hospital spokeswoman Linda DeLaysla said three were in
ritual condition. Seven suffered gunshot wounds and one
was injured by flying glass.
Reagan to increase El Salvador aid
Washington — President Ronald Reagan told Congress
yesterday that the El Salvador government's human rights
record entitles it to receive U.S. aid, and the State Depart
ment said it is urgently studying the need to increase as
sistance to the regime there following an attack by leftist
guerrillas \\ ednesday on the country's main military air base.
These actions set the stage for a potentially major new bat
tle between the administration and congressional liberals,
who contend that the military-civilian regime headed by
President Jose \apoleon Duarte continues to systematically
vlolate human rights.
Reagan's declaration, in the form of a certification to Con
gress, clears the way for the administration to disburse $26
million in military assistance allotted for El Salvador under
the fiscal 1982 foreign aid bill. In passing the legislation last
month Congress attached a provision requiring the presi
lenr to certify that the Salvadoran government was ending
rights abuses and making progress toward political and eco
nomic reform.
In his certification, Reagan concluded that the Duarte re
g me has made a concerted, significant and good faith ef
fort to deal with the complex political, social and human
rights problems it is confronting and that progress is being
made."
Reagan's contention came in a week that saw the Ameri
can Civil Liberties Union and other human rights groups ac
cuse Salvadoran authorities of continuing repression — in
cluding allegedly being responsible for the murder of 12,501
persons during 1981.
Haig names Mideast "expediter"
Cairo, Egypt — Secretary of State Alexander Haig, plung
ing deeply into the intricate details of the Middle East peace
process, brought on stage yesterday a U.S. official touted as
an "expediter" for the snarled Palestinian autonomy talks
between Egypt and Israel.
In back-to-back trips to Jerusalem and Cairo — his second
Middle East shuttle in two weeks — Haig planted some spe
cific ideas he hopes will narrow the "many differences" in
the positions of the two countries and revive deadlocked au
tonomy negotiations on the future of the 1.3 million Palesti
nians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan River
and Gaza Strip.
Haig made clear here and in Jerusalem that only a few for
malities stand in the way of the appointment of Richard Fair
banks, a lawyer and campaign supporter of President Ronald
Reagan, as his special assistant to press for progress in the au
tonomy talks.
Fairbanks, a 40-year-old Indiana lawyer, most recently was
the assistant secretary of state for congressional relations.
Index indicates economic upswing
Washington — A key government gauge of future eco
nomic health was reported on the upswing for the first time
since Julv, and analysts agreed yesterday that an end to the
recession, if not at hand, is coming into focus.

The Commerce Department said its index ot leading in
dicators was up 0.6 percent for December, and that was
hailed as good news bv Reagan administration officials and
private economists alike.
Thev said the report means the national economs is likely
to begin substantial recovery before long and one even said
the process may well be under way right now.
But less-encouraging news showed up yesterday in a trio
of other reports in which:
— The Labor Department said productivity in private busi
ness fell at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in the final three
months of last year as the recession clamped down — the
biggest drop since the government began keeping such fig
ures in 1947 — and productiv itv was down 0.1 percent for all
of 1981.
— \ preliminary version of Congressional Budget Office
figures said the economy as a whole will decline for a third
straight year in 1982 rather than expanding slightly as the ad
ministration is forecasting. It also said unemployment would
average a high 8.9 percent after rising above that level early
in the year.
— \nd the Commerce Department was releasing foreign
trade figures expected to show a 1981 merchandise trade def
icit well above the previous vear's $36.4 billion.
UAW/GM contract talks break down
