## 
### Bill Ainsworth Senior staff writer 
Yesterday's California State Su
preme Court decision to maintain
the new district-reapportionment
plan invoked a reaction along parti
san lines from local congressional
candidates in the upcoming elec
tions.
The decision, devised by the Dem
ocrat-led legislature, moves Stanford
and Palo Alto from Rep. Pete Mc-
Closkey's (R-Menlo Park) 12th dis
trict to Rep. Tom Lantos' (D-San
Mateo) 11th district.
Republican Ed Zschau, candidate
for the congressional seat being
vacated by McCloskey, who is run
ning for the Senate, called the de
cision "arrogant."
"The arrogance of the Burton (re
apportionment) plan is exceeded
only by the arrogance of the court in

upholding the plan," Zschau said in a
written statement.
Meanwhile, l.antos, whose district
will add Stanford and Palo Alto and
lose parts of Daly City, said he fa
vored the decision, although he op
poses the politicization of the reap
portionment process. "I am de
lighted that the decision will mean I
will be able to serve Palo Alto and
Stanford," said Lantos.
According to Lantos, the court's
decision was important because it re
moved a "cloud of uncertainty"from
the elections.
"In upholding the absurd reappor
tionment plan the court has once
again offended our sense of justice,"
Zschau's statement asserted.
According to Zschau, this decision
continues to lower the level of faith
Californian's can place in their judi
cial system.

Zschau said heanticipatesthereac
tion to the decision will bolster ef
forts to remove the reapportionment
process from the political process.
Because of the decision Zschau aid
Drew Dogherty said the candidate
will be opening a new office in
Stanislaus County. Under the new re
apportionment plan, according to
Dogherty, the I2th Congressional dis
trict will stretch from Hillsboro to
Gilroy in the south and Stanislaus
county in the east.
The old district included parts of
San Mateo County and parts of Santa
Clara County, including Stanford and
Palo Alto.
The new district will include the
urban and suburban areas in the Pen
insula as well as the rural, farming
areas of the Central Valley. Dogherty
said there will be more registered Re-
Egypt.

The Padua assault, by a specially

equipment.
