All Donne
Our days and nights have ap
peared on these pages, and, for this
volume, those efforts are done.
Throughout, our three-person'd
God (see staff box) has battered our
hearts, and they have our thanks.
You, reader, have our thanks, too.
The Daily is no island, entire of itself,
and the words you see each morning
are, ultimately, for you. For when we
have failed, when language art too
narrow and too weake to ease lis
now, there is little more to (Jo but re
double our efforts. And when we ap
proach our ideal, when you are in
formed or challenged or touched,
the hours and weeks become worth
while. When working on the paper at
2 a.m., it is easy to feel this present is
the world's last night. But it's not so;
you will see our efforts, a part of our
lives, in issues to come.
