Constant exposure to violence on television provides
an aggressive model for children and may teach them
that violence is acceptable, according to the California
Commission on Crime Control and Violence Prevention.
The commission, after two years of studying the causes
of violence, will present a report to the state legislature
next week, recommending that the legislature institute
strict codes for television programming.
The commission, which would like the legislature to
consider making spanking illegal, is also recommending
that state law be amended to prohibit corporal pun
ishment in schools. And "at an appropriate time in the
future," it said, it would like the state to "consider a legis
lative mandate prohibiting corporal punishment in the
family."
According to the report, a majority of the most violent
persons in society have been abused as children. Also,
childien who watch violence on television are much less
likely, than those who do not, to stop other children
from hurting one report suggest this
phenomenon, labeled the "desensitization effect," may
have considerable long-range, anti-social conse
quences.
"Instead of studying the causes of crime and stopping
it before it happens, all that we have done is put people
in prisons. For 300 years we have been putting people in
prisons — what have we accomplished?" asked John Ed
monds, community resource officer in »he San Mateo
County Sheriff's Office, and a member of the com
mission.
According to the report, by 1985 it will cost more to
house an inmate in California than to send a student to a
major private university.
The legislature established the commission during its
1979 session after finding that, in addition to efforts by
the criminal justice system and crime control programs, a
state-wide citizens effort was necessary to attack the root
causes of crime and violent behavior.
"I have my reservations about state commissions be

cause all their reports gather dust on shelves, but this
one, I am sure, is going to be implemented because we
have a new approach," said Edmonds. "Instead of deal
ing with the after-effects of crime, we are looking at ways
to prevent it."
In the area of television violence, the commission
found that 60 percent of prime-time shows "contain vi
olent solutions to conflict situations," and that cartoons
"are among the most violent television programs." Even
children at the lower end of the TV-use spectrum (2.5
hours of viewing per day), will have spent more time in
front of the television set than in a classroom by the time
they are 18 years old. By age 18, an average person will
have watched more than 18,000 murders on television,
according to the report.
Although once a widely accepted theory, the notion
that television violence has a cathartic effect on the
viewer, whereby his or her violent energy is drained off
by empathizing with the screen actor, is not supported
by the commission's findings. On the contrary, the re
port that a re/af/onsfoip between feieviiion and
"real world" violence exists. The commission also found
that news reports on riots, murders, and hijacks are "re
flected in a subsequent increase in these very situ
ations." Another finding was that a guns bought forself
protection are more likely to be used on the owner than
by the owner.
According to the report, almost a third of households
in the United States were touched by crime in 1980. Ed
monds said the commission was born out of the convic
tion that crime and violence at least to the degree cur
rently experienced, was not an acceptable or inevitable
part of human existence.
"This year is the year of implementation, and we are
going to make sure everyone can understand what the
model of violence is," said Edmonds.
The commission consists of 25 Californians represent
ing law enforcement, education, mental health, religion,
business and labor, ex-offenders and victims of crime.

cause all their reports gather dust on shelves, but this
one, I am sure, is going to be implemented because we
have a new approach," said Edmonds. "Instead of deal
ing with the after-effects of crime, we are looking at ways
to prevent it."
In the area of television violence, the commission
found that 60 percent of prime-time shows "contain vi
olent solutions to conflict situations," and that cartoons
"are among the most violent television programs." Even
children at the lower end of the TV-use spectrum (2.5
hours of viewing per day), will have spent more time in
front of the television set than in a classroom by the time
they are 18 years old. By age 18, an average person will
have watched more than 18,000 murders on television,
according to the report.
Although once a widely accepted theory, the notion
that television violence has a cathartic effect on the
viewer, whereby his or her violent energy is drained off
by empathizing with the screen actor, is not supported
by the commission's findings. On the contrary, the re
port that a re/af/onsfoip between feieviiion and
"real world" violence exists. The commission also found
that news reports on riots, murders, and hijacks are "re
flected in a subsequent increase in these very situ
ations." Another finding was that a guns bought forself
protection are more likely to be used on the owner than
by the owner.
According to the report, almost a third of households
in the United States were touched by crime in 1980. Ed
monds said the commission was born out of the convic
tion that crime and violence at least to the degree cur
rently experienced, was not an acceptable or inevitable
part of human existence.
"This year is the year of implementation, and we are
going to make sure everyone can understand what the
model of violence is," said Edmonds.
The commission consists of 25 Californians represent
ing law enforcement, education, mental health, religion,
business and labor, ex-offenders and victims of crime.
