# Preliminary hearing rescheduled

A preliminary hearing for Stanford
student Robert Simon originally set
for next Friday has been rescheduled
for Feb. 26. Both Simon's lawyer and
the Santa Clara County District At
torney's office agreed to the change.
Simon is charged with two counts
of vehicular manslaughter and one
count of felony drunk driving. His
charges stem from a car accident last
October in which two Stanford stu
dents, Kevin MacMillan and Michael
Becker, were killed.
The preliminary hearing will estab
lish the facts of the case to see if a trial

is warranted. Simon pleaded not guil
ty to the charges Dec. 18 and was re
leased on his own recognizance at
that time.
"We are definitely prosecuting for
each count ... (The length and na
ture of the) sentencing will be made
after the adjudication," said Randy
Hey, supervisory district attorney for
Santa Clara County's Palo Alto office.
Simon's defense attorney, William
Keogh, said he anticipates no early
settlement of the case. If Simon is
convicted of all counts, he will face a
maximum sentence of six years in
state prison, he said.

Members of the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity, of which Simon is a mem
ber, have asked students here to con
sider submitting letters to the district
attorney on Simon's behalf in hopes
of reducing his sentence.
Keogh said he is unsure of the let
ters' effect in the case, but he said, "I
think the sentiments of the com
munity are somewhat revelant... Ev
eryone is interested in helping Rob
ert."
Neither the Becker nor the Mac-
Millan families are directly involved
in the suit, said Hey, though the court
may solicit them for information.
