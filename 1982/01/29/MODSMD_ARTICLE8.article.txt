## Thais field troops against drug king 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bangkok, Thailand — For the
past week more than 1000 Thai
soldiers have been locked in a
fierce and deadly battle — not
with Communist insurgents or
Moslem separatists — but with
a well-equipped army of drug
runners.
The fighting, which re
portedly has left nearly 70 peo
ple dead, including 17 govern
ment soldiers, illustrates a
growing determination by the
Thais to do something about
the narcotics trade that has
flourished virtually unchecked
for decades along their
northern border. This is the so
called Golden Triangle, an
opium-growingarea where the
borders of Thailand, Burma
and Laos converge.
But the firm entrenchment
of traffickers is clear, and how
difficult and costly it will be to
break their organization no
one can say.
The focus of the attack is
Khun Sa, 50, who controls
much of the region's heroin re
fineries, up to 75 percent of the
drug traffic and at least 30 miles
of land along the Thai-Burmese
border, which he rules as a
feudal kingdom.
Khun Sa is backed by an army
estimated to be as large as 5000
men. They are equipped with
grenade launchers, rockets
and other sophisticated weap
ons — paid for with drug mon
ey, according to narcotics of
ficers here.
The trade also bankrolls the
capital of Khun Sa's fiefdom,
Ban Hin Taek, which has been
transformed into what one
narcotics agent called "the
most progressive city in
northern Thailand." It haselec
tricity, a large school and a hos
pital — luxuries in a rugged
area inhabited mainly by hill
tribes.
Cover group
Khun Sa claims to be a patriot
involved only peripherally in
the opium business, and even
then only to raise revenue to
further his goal of winning in
dependence for Burma's

80,000 Shans, a people of Thai
origin living on Burma's
eastern plateau.
But drug enforcement of
ficials say any notion that his
Shan United Army is a force of
freedom fighters is nonsense.
"The SUA is strictly a narcotics
trafficking gang that uses the
veneer of Shan nationalism,"
said Richard Hart, the top
narcotics officers at the U.S.
Embassy here.
Khun Sa's narcotics involve
ment began nearly two dec
ades ago when he was the lead
er of a small force of Shan's au
thorized by Burmese author
ities to keep order in their
sparsely populated district. In
lieu of payment, the Burmese
allowed Khun Sa to have a
piece of the opium trade.
Over the years, he took an
increasing interest in smuggl
ing and noticeably less in
peacekeeping. In the 19605, the
dominant force in the Golden
Triangle drug trade was a
group of former Nationalist
Chinese soldiers who fled Chi
na after the Communist
takeover. Khun Sa once tried to
undercut that monopoly, but
his army was badly mauled in a
confrontation with the Chi
nese.
Chinese pact
By the early '70s, however,
the Nationalists had aban
doned the drug trade in ex
change for an agreement with
the Thai government allowing
them to live in peace in Thai
land. The pact left a void that
Khun Sa eventually filled.
Despite occasional hit-and
run military forays against his
operations, the Thais have
done little until lately tothreat
en Khun Sa.
Now, according to diplomat
icsources, the Thais realize that
the continued presence of
huge opium caravans moving
freely through the northern
frontier is tarnishing the coun
try's international reputation.
In addition, with domestic her
oin addiction on the rise in
Thailand, drugs are no longer
strictly a Western problem.
