Dual life in occupied-Sinai
A young settler walks past a barbed-wire fence rein
forced with tires inside the Yamit settlement in the Si
nai. The uncertain fate of Sinai settlers is apparent in
the guitar and automatic rifle carried by the youth.
Many settlers have refused substantial sums of money
from the Israeli government to leave the Sinai.
