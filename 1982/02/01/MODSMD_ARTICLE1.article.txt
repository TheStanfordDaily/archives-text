## Hayakawa abandons Senate candidacy...

Monterey â€” Senator S.I. "Sam" Hayakawa
stunned over 1200 Republicans Saturday when he
announced he would not seek re-election.
In a 20-minute speech delivered at the California
Republican Party convention iri Monterey, the 75-
year-old senator from Mill Valley said he could not
devote the necessary time to a re-election cam
paign and adequately serve as a senator.
"The difficulties of campaigning while continu
ing to do one's legislative work are well illustrated
by Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey's (R-Menlo Park)
voting record of 57 percent and Barry Goldwater,
Jr.'s (R-Los Angeles) record of 58 percent during
this past year," Hayakawa said. "Having decided to
run for the Senate, they made a deliberate choice
of campaigning rather than earning a high voting
average."
Hayakawa cited his 93 percent voting record as
evidence of his commitment to legislative duties
rather than campaigning. "One simply can't do
both," he said.
"I make this choice without urging or pressure
from anyone," Hayakawa told the audience, "ex

rept my own internal imperative to turn in a record
of solid legislative achievemnt."
Hayakawa's unscheduled morning appearance
was made during the convention's general session.
He arrived wearing his trademark tam-o'-shanter
and was warmly greeted by the crowd. But his an
nouncement elicited gasps from the audience.
As recently as December, Hayakawa adamantly
stated he would seek re-election to another six
year term. But Hayakawa's campaign has been
plagued by a lack of funds and dwindling popu
larity in a crowded Senate campaign field which in
cludes seven other Republicans: McCloskey,
Goldwater, Maureen Reagan, San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson, state Sen. John Schmitz of Corona del
Mar, Rep. John Dornan of Los Angeles and Ted
Bruinsma, former dean of Loyola Law School. A
November Field poll showed Goldwater and
Wilson were ahead in popularity, followed by Mc-
Closkey, then Hayakawa.
Hayakawa's decision to drop out of the race was
made last week following a private session
Wednesday with Sens. Howard Baker of Tennessee
and Paul Laxalt of Nevada. Hayakawa then met

with President Ronald Reagan on Thursday and in
formed the president he would not run in the June
primary. The decision was not made public at that
time.
Hayakawa, former president of San Franc isco
State Universiiy said he plans to pursue a writing
career and entor the lecture circuit.
After his an >uruement, he was surrounded by
aides and es> .Med from the main conference
room. Hayakawa refused to speak to reporters
The remaining senate candidates expressed sur
prise at Hayakawa's announcement and said they
were unaware of the decision.
"I was surprised, but nis odds of winning were
slim," McCloskey told the Daily after the speech
"I respect the old gentleman. Internal priorities
were imperative and he decided he didn't want tr
spend the time necessary for the campaign.'
While Wilson said it would be "premature' tc
speculate just how Hayakawa's political supper
will be divided among the candidates, all of thi
other candidates said they would benefit frorr
Havakawa's withdrawal.
