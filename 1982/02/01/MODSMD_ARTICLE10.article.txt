# Dozier cites skill, style of his captors

Vicenza, Italy (AP) â€” Brig.
Gen. James Dozier on Saturday
called his Red Brigades kidnap
pers smart and dedicated, and
the leftist terrorists vowed to
free "the comrades" jailed for
the abduction.
"They are a bunch of dedi
cated people. They are smart.
They believe in what they are
doing, and they are very seri
ous about it," Dozier told re
porters outside the apartment
building in Verona where the
terrorists grabbed him Dec. 17.
As he spoke, the Red
Brigades sent a message declar
ing "the liberation of Dozier
will not succeed in stopping
the current revolutionary
process, which will triumph in
the end."
"The comrades held in the
state's concentration camp will
be liberated, and imperialism
destroyed," said the leaflet,
signed with the Red Brigades
symbol of a five-pointed star in
a circle.
Police sources said during his
42-day captivity Dozier was
forced to wear headphones for
hours listening to recordings of
classical music, apparently to
keep him from overhearing the

terrorists' conversation and
street noises that might have
helped pinpoint their position.
They also said the Red
Brigades' leader who inter
rogated him was pushy and
rude, but the terrorists did not
injure Dozier physically and
made a special point of buying
him cornflakes for an Ameri
can-style breakfast.
Dozier and his wife, Judith,
were driven to Verona, 31 miles
away, for a surprise visit from
the U.S. Army base here where
they are staying. They wanted
to pick up clothes at the apart
ment and, in the general's
words to one journalist, "to
thank my neighbors for their
prayers."
During the two-hour stay,
Mrs. Dozier gave her husband
an even closer crewcut than
the one he received from an
army barber Thursday after Ital
ian police rescued him.
"I'm glad to be home, I'm in
good shape, and I'm looking
forward to going back to
work," Dozier, wearing a
bright red jogging suit on the
cold, sunny day, said before
the questions began.
