## Student group provides overseas travel, work 
### Steve Trousdale 
Many students return from study abroad with
fond memories, but empty pockets. One cam
pus group, however, offers students the chance
to travel abroad while also enabling them to
earn money by working as business interns.
AIESEC (pronounced "eye-sec,") is the French
acronym for I'Association Internationale des
Etudiants en Sciences Economiques et Com
merciales â€” in English it stands for the Interna
tional Association of Students in Economics and
Business Management. AISEC is an organization
whose purpose, in the words of the local
chapter's president, David Kilby, is "to develop
people . . . through international exchange . . .
(and the) running (of the) local committee. We
are a people-developer organization."
The primary purpose of the club is to set up a
series of exchanges involving business interns
from 57 countries and help foster a spirit of in
ternational cooperation. In fact, the organiza
tion was founded in 1948 in war-torn France,
partly in reaction to the divisiveness and discord
of World War 11.
Today this international organization involves
more than 30,000 students at 400 academic in
stitutions worldwide. This unique group is
almost completely student run; locally it is
directed by Kilby and six vice-presidents.
AIESEC has an interesting history here on the
Stanford campus. According to Kilby, the group
was very active in the 1960s and early 1970s but
probably broke up because of student disap
proval of its methods and a general reaction
against capitalism at the time. Then, about a year
and a half ago, Kilby, a senior economics major

and Paul Zuber, a senior majoring in economics
and international relations, did a feasibility study
on campus to determine student interest in
AIESEC.
The study showed that there was student in
terest in such an organization, so Kilby and
Zuber applied to AIESEC-US for certification,
which was granted last April.
The United States division of AIESEC consists
of local committees, or groups of students, at 63
universities nationwide.
Kilby says the local committees provide stu
dents with experience in two ways. First, a stu
dent has the opportunity to travel overseas as an
intern. Secondly, a student can gain practical ex
perience working with the organization on cam
pus.

For each intern an AIESEC committee wishes
to send overseas an internship within the local
chapter's area must be arranged.
For instance, if a student here wishes to go to
France, the Stanford local chapter of AIESEC
must sponsor an internship for a foreign student
at a local business. In this way, members of the
organization meet with high level represent
atives of local companies to discuss internship
possibilities; they must find housing for the in
coming intern, and they arrange social and cul
tural events to help the exchange student adjust
to his new lifestyle.
Companies in the U.S. which sponsor interns
include such well-known firms as Allstate Insur-

Oil Corp., Schlitz Brewing Corp., Volkswagen of
America, and Domino's Pizza, Ltd.
Although there are no formal connections be
tween AIESEC and other business organizations
on campus or between AIESEC and the Stanford
Overseas Program, informal contacts are.main
tained.
Shirley Giles, the Vice-President of Recruiting
and Membership, said that the organization tries
"to involve students who have been overseas or
who are interested in going overseas."
One student who has recently returned
from overseas is Paul Zuber. Zuber went to
Finland for seven weeks and worked in a wood,
pulp and chemical company. The company even
provided him with an apartment in the town
where he worked.
Asked to describe his experience, Zuber said
that he "loved it"and planned on returning ov
erseas for a longer period, perhaps as long as the
maximum 18 months.
Stanford's local chapter is also hosting one in
tern at the present time.
Benoit Enderlin is from France and attended
the Ecole Superiore de Commerce in Brest, Brit
tany, where he earned a degree comparable to
an American MBA. Enderlin, 28, now works for
the Xerox Corporation as an intern in procure
ment.
Enderlin said that "the experience in itself as
an internship is really great" because it has given
him a chance to work on different things.
It "helps you to enter a job and get full contact
in the world of business," he said.
