## Editor's Note/Joan O'Connell Your Daily fare 
### 
Sometimes I think college newspapers were
invented by food service directors.
just think about it. . . you get up, wander on
downtothediningroom, pick upa Daily, get
your breakfast and sit down. Depending on the
filling of your omelette and its proximity to the
dinner you were served the evening before,
your first few coherent words of the day might
only have the quality of the meal to critique if it
weren't for the Daily.
Now, if we're going to be honest, most of us
would agree that Food Service is really not as
bad as we like to say it is. In fact it's really pretty
good — a fairly varied selection, a balanced,
healthy diet, an occasionally attractive special
meal ordessert, and best of all, a common
denominator of conversation — when all else
fails, at least most of us faced the same "Chef's
surprise" that morning.
In a lot of ways, the Daily tries to do what Food
Service does: design a menu for a diverse,
discriminating audience; provide balanced
coverage of opinion and issues; cater to the
particular tastes and information needsof a
campus readership, which, in nearly every area,
boasts experts with knowledge far beyond what
any one of us can achieve in a few hours of
interviews.
Most of us here have been called upon to
defend the paper, often at parties or sometimes
even in class. Nearly all of us have heard "Gee,
the only thing about the Da/Vy that bothers me, is

But you know, it'salwayssomethingdifferent.
Very rarely is there one thing that forms the bulk
of complaints or critiques ofthe paper, and that
makes me think that we're doing a pretty good
job, too.
Like Food Service, I think we give the
community a common denominator, a way for
nodding acquaintances to speak the same

language on any given day, whether they react
in similar or opposite ways to the news about
rising tuition, or a columnist's opinion, or even
our discretion in printing a certain ad or
cartoon.
Today we begin a new volume, with a new
staff of chefs withtheirown surprises. A few
things have changed, but most have stayedthe
same. You'll now find what we consider the
day's top national story beginning on the front
page so that you'll always know where to look
for it. Our basiccommitment is to covering the
campus as no one else can, but we also realize
that we have responsibility to bring you the
news that you need to put everything in
perspective. We've also, instituted a few design
changes to make reading the papera biteasier.
More are likely to make their appearance as the
volume progresses.
Later in the week we will be featuring a two
part series which we feel privileged to run; two
ofthe victims of sexual assaultson campusthis
fall have chosen to go public with their
experiences in the hope that their words will
helpother women — both victimsand those
who have come to fear for their safety.
That is just one example of a strong
commitment we have to presenting you with
the kind of stories we feel a campus paper
should do, and dooften.
Sometimes our recipe fails — one story may be
bland, anotheroverdone. But if food always
tasted the same, home cooking just wouldn't be
special... if everyday was the same, it just
wouldn't be news. We'd like to think we make
you think, question, and want to learn more,
based on some minimum Daily requirements of
information. Ifwedon't, let us know; we'lltry to
season the paperto your taste.
