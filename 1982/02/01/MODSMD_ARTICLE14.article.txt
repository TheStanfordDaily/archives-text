## Planned Soviet aggression? 
### 
The Daily's Jan. 20 forum on Poland
included three articles — those by
William Mandel, Julia Harvey and
Mark Swanson — which deserve re
sponses.
Mandel's column states flatly
"There never was a danger of Soviet
invasion or occupation of Poland . . .
Invasion of Poland was never a viable
option for Moscow." This is simply
untrue. Had Soviet domination of Po
land ever been gravely threatened,
or had civil war broken out, the lead
ers in the Kremlin would not have
hesitated for an instant to intervene
directly, rather than by proxy. Nor
can the possibility of a future in
vasion be ruled out.
Mandel also argues that "Washing
ton wanted the Soviet Union to in
vade Poland to provide justification
for its cruise and Pershing II missiles
..." Such an absurd statement does
not merit a thorough response. Suf
fice it to say that, of course, there
were a few scattered individuals in
the administration who would have
welcomed a Soviet invasion as a
means of justifying the Western al
liance; but their views were hardly
representative of the views of the
large majority in Washington.
Finally, Mandel asserts that "Po
land is not a satellite of the Soviet
Union." If he wants to quibble over
semantics, that's one thing. But all he
ends up doing is presenting a few
basically irrelevant observations
about private farming in Poland and
Polish recovery after World War 11.
Let me turn next to Harvey's col
umn. She begins by stating, "No
union member can condone or jus
tify martial law traditionally used to
subjugate workers." But, ironically,
Harvey goes on to do just that. She
suggests that Solidarity, by launching
a "reign of terror," is in fact the real
culprit in the Polish crisis.
Harvey's reasoning is a bit mys
tifying. Why blame the oppressed
and not the oppressors? I doubt she
would claim that the slain peasants in
Guatemala had provoked their
deaths at the hands of the security
forces, or that the people of Chile,
Argentina, Turkey, and South Korea
had brought martial law upon them
selves. So why does she maintain a
double standard with regara to Po

land?
Harvey neglects to mention that
the Polish government had often re
fused to fulfill even minor commit
ments to the union. Indeed, far from
recklessness, what was most striking
about Solidarity was its restraint.
The union, for example, never
challenged Poland's membership in
the Warsaw Pact or its pro-Moscow
foreign policy. The plain fact is that
Solidarity became a central force in
Polish life only because it gave ex
pression to widespread desires for
greater freedom.
It is, in any case, erroneous to be
lieve that specific actions on the part
of Solidarity were the sole reason for
the imposition of military rule. The
crackdown had obviously been
planned well in advance, with strong
support and pressure from the Soviet
Union. The Polish security forces had
merely been waiting fora convenient
pretext to assert their power. Harvey
should direct her anger at these
groups and not at Solidarity.
Let me turn, finally, to Swanson's
column. He mainains that "the Rea
gan administration's response to the
situation in Poland has been unnec
essarily provacative and is likely to
prevent any improvement in Soviet-
American relations in the near
future." The administration,
Swanson adds, has "severely over
rated."
It is unclear to me just how the ad
ministration has been "unnecessarily
provacative" or how it has "severely
overreacted." For nearly two weeks
after the crisis began, the president
said virtually nothing about Poland. It
was another two weeks before the
United States joined its allies in a
meaningless compromise statement
condemning the martial law regime.
Moreover, the administration has
been notably moderate in other re
spects: it has ruled out military ac
tion, and has thus far maintained its
commitment to the Geneva nego
tiates on limiting theater nuclear
forces in Europe. The sanctions im
posed against Moscow, which do not
include a grain embargo, are of little
if any significance.
In short, rather than being "pro
vocative," the administration has
been extremely cautious in its re

sponse to the crisis. Rhetoric aside,
the United States has essentially ac
quiesced in the military takeover.
Short of military action, the admin
istration had other options available,
such as declaring the Polish debts in
default. But it chose not to pursue
these options and instead has fol
lowed a very lackluster course.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer overstated the case only slight
ly when he wrote that the Reagan ad
ministration had displayed "dither
ing procrastination, sophisticated
justifications for impotence, (and)
rhetoric incapable of rising to serious
action."
Swanson's statement that the Rea
gan administration's actions are
"likely to prevent any improvement
in Soviet-American relations in the
near future" is puzzling. Did
Swanson expect that Soviet-Ameri
can relations would improve as a re
sult of the Polish crisis? Also, doesn't
Swanson believe that Moscow, and
not Washington, bears responsibility
for the current tensions?
Finally, Swanson falls back upon
the standard rationale given for
American inaction in Poland — the
Yalta pact and the Helsinki Accords.
"Franklin Roosevelt," he writes,
"conceded to Stalin in 1945 at Yalta
domination of Eastern Europe;
Russia's control overthe Warsaw P.,er
was internationally recognized i.the
Helsinki Accords of 1975."
It is true that the concessions made
at Yalta have limited American flex
ibility. But what Swanson fails to note
is that (1) the Yalta agreement called
for free elections in Poland, elections
which have never been held; and (2)
the Helsinki Accords included strict
provisions on human rights, which
are now being violated systematically
in Poland (and which have been re
peatedly violated elsewhere in the
Soviet bloc).
Unless the Soviet Union and its al
lies live up to the obligations they as
sumed under these agreements, it is
difficult to see how the West can
faithfully uphold those parts of the
agreements that benefit the Soviet
Union.

for its cruise and Pershing II missiles
..." Such an absurd statement does
not merit a thorough response. Suf
fice it to say that, of course, there
were a few scattered individuals in
the administration who would have
welcomed a Soviet invasion as a
means of justifying the Western al
liance; but their views were hardly
representative of the views of the
large majority in Washington.
Finally, Mandel asserts that "Po
land is not a satellite of the Soviet
Union." If he wants to quibble over
semantics, that's one thing. But all he
ends up doing is presenting a few
basically irrelevant observations
about private farming in Poland and
Polish recovery after World War 11.
Let me turn next to Harvey's col
umn. She begins by stating, "No
union member can condone or jus
tify martial law traditionally used to
subjugate workers." But, ironically,
Harvey goes on to do just that. She
suggests that Solidarity, by launching
a "reign of terror," is in fact the real
culprit in the Polish crisis.
Harvey's reasoning is a bit mys
tifying. Why blame the oppressed
and not the oppressors? I doubt she
would claim that the slain peasants in
Guatemala had provoked their
deaths at the hands of the security
forces, or that the people of Chile,
Argentina, Turkey, and South Korea
had brought martial law upon them
selves. So why does she maintain a
double standard with regara to Po

land?
Harvey neglects to mention that
the Polish government had often re
fused to fulfill even minor commit
ments to the union. Indeed, far from
recklessness, what was most striking
about Solidarity was its restraint.
The union, for example, never
challenged Poland's membership in
the Warsaw Pact or its pro-Moscow
foreign policy. The plain fact is that
Solidarity became a central force in
Polish life only because it gave ex
pression to widespread desires for
greater freedom.
It is, in any case, erroneous to be
lieve that specific actions on the part
of Solidarity were the sole reason for
the imposition of military rule. The
crackdown had obviously been
planned well in advance, with strong
support and pressure from the Soviet
Union. The Polish security forces had
merely been waiting fora convenient
pretext to assert their power. Harvey
should direct her anger at these
groups and not at Solidarity.
Let me turn, finally, to Swanson's
column. He mainains that "the Rea
gan administration's response to the
situation in Poland has been unnec
essarily provacative and is likely to
prevent any improvement in Soviet-
American relations in the near
future." The administration,
Swanson adds, has "severely over
rated."
It is unclear to me just how the ad
ministration has been "unnecessarily
provacative" or how it has "severely
overreacted." For nearly two weeks
after the crisis began, the president
said virtually nothing about Poland. It
was another two weeks before the
United States joined its allies in a
meaningless compromise statement
condemning the martial law regime.
Moreover, the administration has
been notably moderate in other re
spects: it has ruled out military ac
tion, and has thus far maintained its
commitment to the Geneva nego
tiates on limiting theater nuclear
forces in Europe. The sanctions im
posed against Moscow, which do not
include a grain embargo, are of little
if any significance.
In short, rather than being "pro
vocative," the administration has
been extremely cautious in its re

sponse to the crisis. Rhetoric aside,
the United States has essentially ac
quiesced in the military takeover.
Short of military action, the admin
istration had other options available,
such as declaring the Polish debts in
default. But it chose not to pursue
these options and instead has fol
lowed a very lackluster course.
Former Secretary of State Henry Kis
singer overstated the case only slight
ly when he wrote that the Reagan ad
ministration had displayed "dither
ing procrastination, sophisticated
justifications for impotence, (and)
rhetoric incapable of rising to serious
action."
Swanson's statement that the Rea
gan administration's actions are
"likely to prevent any improvement
in Soviet-American relations in the
near future" is puzzling. Did
Swanson expect that Soviet-Ameri
can relations would improve as a re
sult of the Polish crisis? Also, doesn't
Swanson believe that Moscow, and
not Washington, bears responsibility
for the current tensions?
Finally, Swanson falls back upon
the standard rationale given for
American inaction in Poland — the
Yalta pact and the Helsinki Accords.
"Franklin Roosevelt," he writes,
"conceded to Stalin in 1945 at Yalta
domination of Eastern Europe;
Russia's control overthe Warsaw P.,er
was internationally recognized i.the
Helsinki Accords of 1975."
It is true that the concessions made
at Yalta have limited American flex
ibility. But what Swanson fails to note
is that (1) the Yalta agreement called
for free elections in Poland, elections
which have never been held; and (2)
the Helsinki Accords included strict
provisions on human rights, which
are now being violated systematically
in Poland (and which have been re
peatedly violated elsewhere in the
Soviet bloc).
Unless the Soviet Union and its al
lies live up to the obligations they as
sumed under these agreements, it is
difficult to see how the West can
faithfully uphold those parts of the
agreements that benefit the Soviet
Union.

The Daily's Jan. 20 forum on Poland
included three articles — those by
William Mandel, Julia Harvey and
Mark Swanson — which deserve re
sponses.
Mandel's column states flatly
"There never was a danger of Soviet
invasion or occupation of Poland . . .
Invasion of Poland was never a viable
option for Moscow." This is simply
untrue. Had Soviet domination of Po
land ever been gravely threatened,
or had civil war broken out, the lead
ers in the Kremlin would not have
hesitated for an instant to intervene
directly, rather than by proxy. Nor
can the possibility of a future in
vasion be ruled out.
Mandel also argues that "Washing
ton wanted the Soviet Union to in

for its cruise and Pershing II missiles
..." Such an absurd statement does
not merit a thorough response. Suf
