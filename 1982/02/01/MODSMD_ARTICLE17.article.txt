## Grads need housing subsidy 
### 
Last quarter, Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons explained the Uni
versity's student housing policies to
representatives of the Graduate Stu
dent Association and the Escondido
VillageCouncil. Hisofficerecognizes
the urgent need for more graduate
housing, but has been unable to act,
because, until recently, there has
been "no constituency," not even
graduate students, pushing for its
construction.
Unfortunately, the constituency in
the best position to lobby for more
graduate housing, the faculty and
deans, are now preoccupied with
their own housing problems.
From my conversations with Lyons
and other University officials I have
pieced together the following pic
ture of the University's housing poli
cy as it affects graduate housing.
The bottom line for all University
decisions involving large amounts of
money is "Does this project improve
Stanford's position relative to Prince
ton, Harvard, and MIT?" So far, from
the University's viewpoint, only the
shortage of undergraduate and facul
ty housing appears to be damaging
the University's reputation.
Undergraduate housing was found
lacking because Stanford could guar
antee only three years of housing to
prospective students, whereas other
institutions could guarantee four.
Sterling Quad will solve this prob
lem.
Faculty housing has recently
emerged as a major obstacle to re
cruiting. The University has since
commited an increasingly larger por
tion of its resources to faculty hous
ing.
For instance, some local realtors
thank the University's Co-Invest
ment Program (COIN) for keeping
them solvent in an otherwise de
pressed housing market. COIN and
the soon to be implemented Housing
Allowance Program (HAP) make it
easier for faculty to purchase homes.
In contrast, the housing problems
of graduate students and staff do not
appear to be weakening the Univer
sity's competitive position. At least

not yet. Hence the housing needs of
both groups are relatively low on the
University's priority list. But the situ
ation may be changing.
The severity of the housing prob
lem has recently been brought home
to on-campus graduate students by
the steep rent increases of the last
two years. The recently announced
residency limits, (one year for single
students and childless married
couples, and four years for families),
also helped to awaken the on-cam
pus students to the realities of the lo
cal housing situation.
Given the steady decline in gradu
ate stipends over the last decade, the
University's hesitancy to build gradu
ate student housing is particularly
puzzling.

The bottom line for all University decisions
involving large amounts of money is' Does
this project improve Stanford's position
relative to Princeton, Harvard, and MIT?'. So
far, from the University's viewpoint, only the
shortage of undergraduate and faculty
housing appears to be damaging the
University's reputation.

Because the University does not
pay taxes on student housing and al
ready owns the land, it can provide
graduate student housing at a lower
cost than outside landlords and still
make a profit. Thus additional gradu
ate housing would appear to be an
ideal way for the University to simul
taneously stretch student stipends,
ease the local housing crunch, and
turn a profit.
But after examining the Univer
sity's student housing budget, I am
pessimistic that even four con
secutive years of the 14 percent or
greater rent increases now being im
plemented by the Office of Housing
Management will enable the Univer
sity to construct affordable, new,
graduate housing during this decade.

Currently the undergraduate
housing system is losing about
$742,000 a year and the $620,000 prof
it made from Escondido Village is
going to cover most of that loss.
If undergraduate study at Stanford
is to remain cost competitive with
Harvard eta/., the undergraduate
portion of the housing system wili
probably be unable to finance itself
in the foreseeable future. And Escon
dido Village cannot both subsidize
undergraduate housing and finance
significant amounts of new, attrac
tive, graduate student housing.
The University must, for a few
years, increase its subsidies to stu
dent housing until sufficient fi
nanced graduate housing exists to

carry the undergraduate portion.
Such subsidies would be similar to
the use of general funds to subsidize
faculty housing (i.e. the Housing Al
lowance Program).
To encourage the University to in
vest in graduate housing, the Gradu
ate Student Association and the
Escondido Village Council are spon
soring a petition asking that the Uni
versity creatively finance and con
struct new, affordable, graduate stu
dent housing by 1985. If the Univer
sity does not, graduate student re
cruitment may replace faculty re
cruitment as the dean's biggest head
ache in the 1980s.
