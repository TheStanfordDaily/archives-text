# Letter
## Write letters to help others 
### 
It was cheering to read that Stan
ford volunteers have sent more than
100 letters to Polish authorities in an
effort to free the prisoners taken un
der Poland's martial law. As Amnesty
International has demonstrated,
such efforts have saved the lives and
secured the freedom of political pris
oners in many parts of the world.
That is why I hope the extensive
letter-writing sessions that were held
at Memorial Church this week will be
repeated in behalf of men and wom
en in countries where conditions are
even more brutal than in Poland,
such as Chile, Argentina, the Philip
pines, and Uruguay, where political
prisoners are routinely tortured and
degraded, or Turkey, where
thousands have been arrested under
continuing martial law.
It would probably do no good to
write letters to El Salvador or
Guatemala; their dissidents are tor
tured and kiled without the formality
of arrest. But we can urge Congress
toend U.S. military aid tothose coun
tries. Letters are needed this week es
pecially, when — despite well
documented evidence to the con
trary — President Ronald Reagan in
tends to certify that the human rights
situation in El Salvador has improved,
in order to justify continued aid.
