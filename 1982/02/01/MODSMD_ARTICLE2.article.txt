Monterey — Maureen Reagan's elephant, Vice-Presi
dent George Bush's appearance and speech, and a party
statement denouncing remarks made by state Sen. John
Schmitz earlier this year, vied with Sen. S.I Hayakawa's
withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race for attention at this
weekend's California Republican Convention in Mon
terey.
The convention was the firstthisyearforthe California
Republican Party. It began Friday evening when "The
Republican Victory Express," carrying some ot Califor
nia's June 8 primary hopefuls, arrived in Salinas. General
meeting sessions were held all day Saturday and vester
day morning. Saturday's highlight was Bush's ap
pearance at a party fund-raising dinner.
High on the agenda was discussion of re-apportion
meit. The California Supreme Court ruled last week (hat
the new boundaries drawn last year by the Democrat
con'rolled Legislature will be used in this year's election.
At the same time the court placed a Republican-spon
sored referendum on the June ballot. If the referendum
ic successful, legislative and congressional districts won't

irso d'il Junco, California's Republican Party ( hair
m an, ang/ily denounced the court's decision during Sat
urday's meetings, saving, "Survey's show that 85 percent
oi f he public is in favor of the Republican (drawn bound
aries)." He said the party will invest toward the
'urie referendum.
Del junco also defended the party's issued statement
d -associating itself from remarks made by state Sen.
Jc hn Schmitz of Corona del Mar.
The statement, released Saturday, said the Republican
Party was distressed by Schmitz's recent "outrageous
and insensitive " remarks, which are "an anatnema to the
very principles and foundation" of the party.
Schmitz has recently attacked his anti-abortion and
anti-ERA critics, calling them "lesbians,' "bulldykes,"

"queer groups" and "a sea of hard, Jewish and (arguably)
female faces." Schmitz said at the Convention Friday
night that he represents a conservative point of view and
that only liberals would find his press coverage negative
because he does not.
Atter a round of golf at Pebble Beach, Bush arrived Sat
urday evening and addressed an audience at a sold-out
$35-a-plate dinner. In a prepared speech, Bush de
fended President Reagan's "new federalism," saying it
was "a bold, new plan (which would) restore responsi
ble back to the states and back tothe people." Bushalso
called for a moment of silence for "those suffering in Po
land. '
In a now-familiar gesture, Hayakawa appeared to fall
asleep during Bush's 20-minute speech. California's jun
ior senator, who had earlier announced he would not
seek re-election, was seated with the Bush party in front
of the audience.
The convention was primarily a showcase for can
didates seeking to win the june primary, particularly the
two gubernatorial candidates, Lt. Gov. Mike Curb and
Attorney General George Deukmejian, and the eight

Barry Goldwater Jr., and Robert Dornan, San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson, Maureen Reagan and jack Hickey.
Hickev, of Redwood City, announced his Senate bid
for the first time at the convention. He is a research scien
tist for a local electronics systems manufacturer.
All candidates hosted informal, open-door parties, but
only Reagan produced an elephant outside the conven
tion hall for free rides. The elephant, decked in a red
blanket and red, white and blue streamers, was part of
Reagan's "Mardi Gras"-themed event.
