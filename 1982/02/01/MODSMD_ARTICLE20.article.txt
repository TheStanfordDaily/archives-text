# Callioraphy â€“ A gift of style, grace
## 
### Michael Abramson 
Graceful curves and flowing lines glide easily across
the paper in tribute to the artists' fine strokes of calli
graphy. Admirers of the art imagine the years of prac
tice involved in perfecting the art of beautiful writing.
Yet, calligraphy is an individualized art form that most
anyone can learn.
The art of calligraphy or "beautiful writing," rests
on a style that is, according to Billie Odell, "spontane
ous and individualized." Odell, who has been
teaching a course in calligraphy through the Student
Arts at Stanford (STARTS) for two years, stressed the
uniqueness of calligraphy for each individual.
"It doesn't matter what level you start at," she said,
"but how far you can progress from that ability."
Odell acknowledged that "because here in the
Stanford community so much time is devoted to the
mind and because it takes up so much time, students
simply don't have the time to learn such a skill."
She emphasized that the course is not demanding
and provides an adequate introduction and back
ground to the fundamentals of calligraphy.

Although Odell's course focuses on the art of calli
graphy, she said she believes the the "history of civ
ilization is the history of calligraphy."
Calligraphy's roots are traced to Egyptian hier
oglyphics wherein picture-writing facilitated com
munications. The Sumarian and Babylonian cultures
used Egyptian hieroglyphicsasa basisforthe mercan
tile dealings.
Two forms of writing emerged during the Greek
and Roman Empires: commercial and imperial.
Merchants used commercial writing for such things as
I.O.U's, while imperial writing dominated cor
nerstones of buildings. Following the fall of the Ro
man Empire, stylized writing took its place in cloisters
and monasteries until the Middle Ages brought about
a revival of calligraphy.
With the invention of the printing press, calligraphy
permanently took on more of an artistic form of ex
pression rather than a medium of communication.
Because of the many facets of the art of calligraphy,
the course is divided into the specifics of writing tech
niques and the concomitant artistic modes.

Her first lesson covered the basic strokes of Italic
Hand as students used a felt tip pen to ease writing.
Once the basic strokes were mastered, the students
moved into spacing and rhythm using a sign brush
with a chisel end. The sign brushes have special pen
nibs which combine the ability to produce a line with
heavy strokes and hairlines.
During one session Odell's students learned to
write rhythmically to a tape of a waltz and ragtime.
Her final three lessons will concentrate on different
writing styles. The Uncial Hand, which originated in
the fourth and fifth centuries and adapts well to flyer
use, is characterized by "angular and masculine"
straight lines. "Round and feminine" characterize the
Old English Hand, which developed in monasteries.
Odell divides her class into an hour of lecture and
an hourof individualized instruction. Herefforts have
led to a quick progression for beginners and a per
fection for more advanced writers. "Whereas before I
had only an amateurish ability," commented
freshman Steve Sokil, "I could probably write com
mercially now." Sokil said he has spent many hours
writing elaborate and intimate notes for his friends,
parents and himself. Odell suggested that calli
graphers be compensated for any work because of
the great time demand. Moreover, because of this
unique skill, the calligrapher will "never go hungry/'
