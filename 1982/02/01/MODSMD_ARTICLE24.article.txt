## Card hoopsters fall to Sundevils. 
### Sid Spaeth 
Tempe, Ariz. — Stanford went scoreless
for six and one half minutes midway
through the first half and fell from a 10-
point lead to a 66-58 loss at the hands of Ar
izona State Univerity in Pacific-10 Con
ference basketball action, Saturday.
The Cardinal lead 16-6 with 13 minutes
remaining in the first half but faltered to a
26-22 halftime deficit.
Stanford controlled the tempo through
out much of the game and Cardinal players
were repeatedly sent to the freethrow line.
Before the ASU loss, Stanford lead the con
ference in freethrow percentage with 84.2
percent.
But even though the Sundevils played
into Stanford's hands and fouled often,
Cardinal players missed 13 of 23 freethrow
attempts in the second half including four
of five front ends of one-and-one situ
ations.
"We lost momentum in the first half,"

coach Dick Dißiaso explained, "when we
lead 14-4 and missed the front ends of
three one-and-one situations and missed a
layup off of a set play.
"At the other end of the floor," Dißiaso
continued, "we did not block out and gave
up 14 points on the offensive board. We
denied ourselves the opportunity to main
tain our lead."
Freshman Steve Brown lead Stanford
both offensively — 14 points, four assists,
four steals — and defensively, holding
Sundevil guard Lafayette "Fat" Lever to
nine first half points.
Lever broke open after halftime,
though, to finish with a game-high 23
points after Stanford's 11 second half turn
overs took their toll and ASU began to run.
"Steve Brown was the one positive point
of the game," Dibiaso said, "I'm happy for
him. With 15 seconds left, I turned to (As
sistant Coach) Cory Russell and said Steve
has come into his own."

Stanford forward Brian Welch hit seven
of nine freethrows but only three of 10
field goals to finish with 13 points.
Sophomore center John Revelli scored
12 and freshman forward Johnny Rogers
had 10 for the Cardinal.
Five players fouled out and 56 personal
fouls were committed by both teams.
Lever picked off five passes and hit nine
of 12 freethrows — most of them in the
critical closing minutes — to dominate the
floor in the second half.
Stanford trailed by as much as 14 points
in the second half, but cut the lead to four
with 1:38 remaining.
Stanford, which is 1-7 in conference play
and 6-11 overall, travels to Tucson tonight
totakeon the University of Arizona. Arizo
na is 0-8 in the conference, 5-12 overall,
and has dropped nine straight games.
Stanford has lost six straight and is 0-4 on
the road.
