# Card tank teams whip Long Beach, USC
## 
### Nick Ferguson 
In what was designed as a
tune-up weekend for the Stan
ford swim teams, both the men
and women defeated Long
Beach State University and the
women took another victory
from the University of South
ern California.

The women are preparing
for their Feb. 6 showdown with
the University of Texas, one of
the top three teams in the na
tion. It will be the only time all
season the two teams face each
other since the Longhorns are
in the Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics for

Women (AIAW) and the
Cardinal is a member of the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic As
sociation (NCAA).
And the women forged their
preparation in style, thrashing
Long Beach 109-37 and the Tro
jans 93-56 in deGuerre pool.
Card freshman Marybeth

Linzmeier was the outstanding
performer of the UCLB meet,
setting national bests for this
season in three events â€” the
200, 500 and 1000-yard free
style.
It's hard to disappointed by
an 81-30 victory, but Stanford
men's coach Skip Kenney was.
"If we swim this way against
UCLA there is no way we'll
win," he commented.
