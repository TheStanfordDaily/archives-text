## 
### Andrew Messing 
On Saturday the Cardinal
wrestling team grappled at the
All-California Invitational held
at San Francisco State. Stanford
placed fourth out of top four
teen schools which marked the
first time that Stanford has
placed in a major wrestling
tournament since the sport was
reinstated to varsity status here
two years ago.
Junior Derrick Strahora
wrestling at 134 pounds and
sophmore Tom Mullen at 167
gained team points for early
round victories and were only
one match away from placing
at the tournament. Un
fortunately, Tim Daniels, one
of the outstanding wrestlers on
the team, injured his knee in

the first round and was forced
to default.
Captain Doug Perkins
started out slowly in his first
match. In the last minute, he
pulled out a victory with a 2-1
decision. After winning his sec
ond match 15-6, Perkins met
Bakersfield's highly-touted
Mark Loomis in the finals. Per
kins defeated Loomis, a three
time state champion, in a very
close match. The inatch was
even until the third period
when Perkins scored on a re
versal and a near fall to make
the final score 7-3.
Ed Katz, a 190-pound
freshman, was the only other
Cardinal and the only
freshman who made it into the
finals. Katz, who received a bye

in the first round, proceeded to
win his second round match by
a fall in two minutes. Katz went
on to win his next match in ov
ertime but lost in the finals
9-17. The freshman's second
round pin tied him with Per
kins for the most pins this sea
son.
The grapplers ended up with
thirty-five team points. Perkin's
win proved that he is the best
177 pounder in California. It
also qualified him for the all
star dual-meet which will be
held in Bakersfield on Feb. 18.
Katz will also attend that tour
nament as an alternate.
The next meet for the
Cardinal will be against San
Francisco State on Feb. 5.
