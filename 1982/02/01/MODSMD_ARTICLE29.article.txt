# Card nine sweep USF
## 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford's highly touted
baseball team got on track
over the weekend by
sweeping a three game
series with the University of
San Francisco Dons.
After making a surprising
second-place finish at the
NCAA Central Regionals
last year, the Cardinal hopes
to finish even better this
season as most of the fire
power has returned.
In pre-season polls, Stan
ford has been ranked as one
of the top teams in the na
tion. Collegiate Baseball has
picked the Cardinal fourth
nationally while All Ameri
ca Baseball News ranked
Stanford fifth.
The Cardinal certainly
didn't pick up many doub
ters over the weekend, de
feating USF 6-1 Friday night
and sweeping a double
header Saturday by scores
of 7-6 and 3-0.
Last year, Stanford hit an
amazing .337 as a team and
scored an average of 8.6
runs a game. Although the
offense didn't quite live up
to its awesome potential last
weekend, the performance
of the defense and pitching
more than made up for it.
Particularly impressive was

freshman pitcher Jeff
Ballard's shutout in the third
game.
Stanford outfielder Mike
Dotterer feels that given
time, this team could be
even better than last year.
"We lost a few players but
most of the team is still in
tact and we more than make
up for it in experience "
After Saturday's double
header, Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess
seemed satisfied with his
team's performance.
"If you win, I am
pleased," Marquess said.
"We played good defense
and our pitching was also
good. I was a little disap
pointed in our offense but
at this point in the season
I'm not overly concerned."
Friday night's game
matched pitcher Brian
Mignano for Stanford
against Con Dempsey of
USF.
Shortstop Bob DeCosta
got things started in the
third inning hitting a home
run over the left field fence
which gave Stanford a 1-0
lead. Stanford scored again
in the same inning when
first baseman Mike Aldrette
drove in second baseman

Steve Buechele. Four more
runs in the fifth, three on a
Mike Toothman blast over
the left field fence, then
sealed it up for the Cardinal.
The first game of Satur
day's twin-bill was probably
the most excitng of the .
series. Stanford scored first
when Buechelle drove in
two runs in the bottom of
the third inning.
The Dons came back to
score a run in the fourth in
ning and then scored again .
in the fifth. But in tfie bot
tom of the fifth, Stanford
took a .3-2 lead whew Dot
terer scored from third 011 ,i
fly by Aldrette.
Then USF scored twice in
the sixth inning off reliever
Doug Gwaltney and twice in
the eighth to take a 6-3 lead.
Stanford came back to tie
it in the bottom of the in
ning. After loading the.
bases with no one out, Dot
terer scored from third on .1
fly ball by outfielder Tooth
man.
In the second game,
freshman Jeff Ballard went
the distance pitching a five
hit shutout. The Cardinal
scored three runs in the
third inning as Stanford
cruised to an easy victory.
