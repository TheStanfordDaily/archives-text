# BMR housing plan at issue
## 
### Katherine Brown 
Will the University be able to im
plement its own below-market-rate
(BMR) housing program in the near
future? Given Palo Alto's interest in
providing low-cost housing to all of
its residents, there is potential for
conflict.
The purpose of BMR zoning is to
make housing units available to low
and moderate income families at
prices lower than the going rate.
Robin Hamill, director of University
housing, has proposed a BMR financ
ing program for up to 20 percent of
the 1400 new units at the Stanford
West site on Willow Road. The Uni
versity's eligibility list would include
Stanford faculty, University and hos
pital senior staff, permanent staff at
SLAC and senior research fellows at
Hoover Institution.
Hamill acknowledged that the is
sue of BMR housing is an open one.
She noted that Stanford does not re
ceive any of the city's housing funds
for its projects, hence the Univer
sity's self-subsidized BMR program
should not be forced to accept per
sons on the Palo Alto waiting list.
"There is nothing in the Palo Alto
Comprehensive Plan or the city or
dinances that says only one agency

can administer BMR programs," said
Hamill. "We want to control oc
cupancy and decide who's on the
waiting list... in other words we will
stop burdening them (the Palo Alto
Housing Corporation) with Stanford
people," she said.
Palo Alto's BMR program is de
signed to make one out of every ten
new housing units available to mod
erate-income families. Unit price is
based on the actual construction
costs excluding profit, land and mar
keting costs.
"If this developer decides to serve
his own people, why couldn't others
also serve their own?," says one
member of the non-profit Palo Alto
Housing Corporation (P*\HC). There
are University-affiliated applicants
on the city's 400-persori waiting list.
The plans for BMR units on the
Stanford West site include single-pa
rent family suites that would con
gregate two master bedrooms and
adjacent smaller rooms around a
common living space and kitchen fa
cility. "We're trying to create units
that are effectively BMR because two
people would share costs," Hamill
said.
"We're trying to be more generous
than the city ... the University plans

to make more than the 10 percent
minimum of the project BMR," Ham
ill noted. "Whereas the Palo Alto
BMR housing candidate must earn
between 80 and 120 percent of the
Santa Clara County median income,
those on our list earning a lower per
centage will be eligible."
Some much-publicized criticism of
Palo Alto's BMR program came from
Stanford law professor Robert F.l
lickson. His article "The Irony of In
clusionary Zoning," which appeared
in the September, 1981 issue of the
Southern California Law Review,
proposes three problems with BMR
zoning: I)increased building of BMR
units will force the total number of
low-cost units down; 2) prices of the
remaining 90 percent of projects will
be forced up; 3)BMR zoning is an in
efficient way to redistribute income.
The "filter mechanism" theory is
the basis for Ellickson's contention
that more BMR units result in fewer
low-cost units overall.
"When more luxury housing units
are created, a chain of moves in the
community increases vacancy rates
in the housing stock that is within the
means of low and moderate income
families," he wrote in the article.
Mark Chandler of the PAHC claims
the filtering mechanism theory has
no validity. "People will come in
from outside the community to buy
up the high-priced units. Building
more luxury units, as Ellickson sug
gests, doesn't free up other units, its
ultimate effect is to make Palo Alto
more of a luxury community," he
said.
In a response to an editorial by El
lickson that appeared in the Palo Alto
Weekly, Suzanne MacPherson, pres
ident of the PAHC, said that the costs
of BMR units cannot be passed on to
the consumer of the market-rate
units because those prices are "set by
what the market will bear in competi
tion with developments which do
not include BMR units."
Ellickson maintains that the BMR
program is "a ludicrous way to dis
tribute income." In his Weekly edito
rial, he wrote, "A recipient might
prefer to receive $30,000 in cash rath
er than the $60,000 discount on a new
condominium.
Stanford subsidizes its faculty and
staff members through two pro
grams: co-investment (COIN) and
the Housing Allowance Program

zoning: I)increased building of BMR
units will force the total number of
low-cost units down; 2) prices of the
remaining 90 percent of projects will
be forced up; 3)BMR zoning is an in
efficient way to redistribute income.
The "filter mechanism" theory is
the basis for Ellickson's contention
that more BMR units result in fewer
low-cost units overall.
"When more luxury housing units
are created, a chain of moves in the
community increases vacancy rates
in the housing stock that is within the
means of low and moderate income
families," he wrote in the article.
Mark Chandler of the PAHC claims
the filtering mechanism theory has
no validity. "People will come in
from outside the community to buy
up the high-priced units. Building
more luxury units, as Ellickson sug
gests, doesn't free up other units, its
ultimate effect is to make Palo Alto
more of a luxury community," he
said.
In a response to an editorial by El
lickson that appeared in the Palo Alto
Weekly, Suzanne MacPherson, pres
ident of the PAHC, said that the costs
of BMR units cannot be passed on to
the consumer of the market-rate
units because those prices are "set by
what the market will bear in competi
tion with developments which do
not include BMR units."
Ellickson maintains that the BMR
program is "a ludicrous way to dis
tribute income." In his Weekly edito
rial, he wrote, "A recipient might
prefer to receive $30,000 in cash rath
er than the $60,000 discount on a new
condominium.
Stanford subsidizes its faculty and
staff members through two pro
grams: co-investment (COIN) and
the Housing Allowance Program
(HAP).
Will the University be able to im
plement its own below-market-rate
(BMR) housing program in the near
future? Given Palo Alto's interest in
providing low-cost housing to all of
its residents, there is potential for
conflict.
The purpose of BMR zoning is to
make housing units available to low
and moderate income families at
prices lower than the going rate.
Robin Hamill, director of University
housing, has proposed a BMR financ
ing program for up to 20 percent of
the 1400 new units at the Stanford
West site on Willow Road. The Uni
versity's eligibility list would include
Stanford faculty, University and hos
pital senior staff, permanent staff at
SLAC and senior research fellows at
Hoover Institution.
Hamill acknowledged that the is
sue of BMR housing is an open one.
She noted that Stanford does not re
ceive any of the city's housing funds
for its projects, hence the Univer
sity's self-subsidized BMR program
should not be forced to accept per
sons on the Palo Alto waiting list.
"There is nothing in the Palo Alto
Comprehensive Plan or the city or
dinances that says only one agency

can administer BMR programs," said
Hamill. "We want to control oc
cupancy and decide who's on the
waiting list... in other words we will
stop burdening them (the Palo Alto
Housing Corporation) with Stanford
people," she said.
Palo Alto's BMR program is de
signed to make one out of every ten
new housing units available to mod
erate-income families. Unit price is
based on the actual construction
costs excluding profit, land and mar
keting costs.
"If this developer decides to serve
his own people, why couldn't others
also serve their own?," says one
member of the non-profit Palo Alto
Housing Corporation (P*\HC). There
are University-affiliated applicants
on the city's 400-persori waiting list.
The plans for BMR units on the
Stanford West site include single-pa
rent family suites that would con
gregate two master bedrooms and
adjacent smaller rooms around a
common living space and kitchen fa
cility. "We're trying to create units
that are effectively BMR because two
people would share costs," Hamill
said.
"We're trying to be more generous
than the city ... the University plans

to make more than the 10 percent
minimum of the project BMR," Ham
ill noted. "Whereas the Palo Alto
BMR housing candidate must earn
between 80 and 120 percent of the
Santa Clara County median income,
those on our list earning a lower per
centage will be eligible."
Some much-publicized criticism of
Palo Alto's BMR program came from
Stanford law professor Robert F.l
lickson. His article "The Irony of In
clusionary Zoning," which appeared
in the September, 1981 issue of the
Southern California Law Review,
proposes three problems with BMR
zoning: I)increased building of BMR
units will force the total number of
low-cost units down; 2) prices of the
remaining 90 percent of projects will
be forced up; 3)BMR zoning is an in
efficient way to redistribute income.
