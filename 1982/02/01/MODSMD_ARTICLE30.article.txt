The Fresno State Lady Bull
dogs met more than their
match in Maples Pavilion Sat
urday as they were soundly
beaten by the Stanford wom
en's basketball team, 77-70.
The Cardinal was bolstered
by the return to the starting
line-up of super-scorer Jeanne
Ruark-Hoff, but lost high-scor
ing forwards Kim Kupferer, out
with a serious knee injury, and
Louise Smith before the game.
Smith, a valuable senior,
came down with
mononucleosis, but said op
timistically, "I'm going to try to
work back slowly." She hopes

to be back in the line-up
before the end of the season.
The game Saturday was
played somewhat more slowly
than recent Cardinal games
and Stanford was able to crafti
ly take advantage on both de
fense and offense.
It was an even match-up for
the first 13 minutes of play, as
the teams exchanged point
for-point. Then, however, the
Cardinal suddenly got a spurt
of energy and a 10-point lead,
which it held consistently for
the rest of the game.
This was the turning-point of
the game and was led by high
scorer Meg Metzger. She sank

three sensational baskets from
directly beneath the
backboard, then later said
modestly, "We practice those
things. The posts were open all
night."
The entire Cardinal roster
saw action in the victory, with
every player putting out a good
effort. Coach Dottie McCrea
gave special mention to guards
Angie Pacione and Lee Anne
Margerum.
Guard Anne Miller and for
ward Leigh Pederson, who
earned a starting position after
her outstanding performance
in last week's game, also played
aggressively, scoring 12 valu

able points between them.
Ruark-Hoff and Metier pro
vided tlie real scoring impetus,
however, to keep Stanford weH
in the lead for the majority of
the game. Ruark-Hoff scored
18 points and pulled dow'n
eight rebounds, while Metzgfei
scored a career-high 27 poirijs
and grabbed eight reboundC".
The win ups Stanford's ryt>
ord to 13-6 overall and a strong
3-2 in the Northern Califorf>i,t
Athletic Conference. The
Cardinal will face conference
action again tomorrow night at
8 p.m. when they play the Uni-"
versity of San Francisco ■in
Maples Pavilion.
