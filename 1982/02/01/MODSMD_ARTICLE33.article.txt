New volume
This issue marks the start of Vol
ume 181 of the Daily. With the new
volume will come change: new jobs
and a new graphic look, among oth
ers.
Amid the change, though, some
things remain the same. As usual, we
need staffers — new and old — to
sign up to night and wire edit and to
pick up story assignments from the
news and features editors.
