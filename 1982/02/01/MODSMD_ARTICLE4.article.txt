Martial law incites riots
Warsaw — Policc fought street battles with youths in Gdansk over the
weekend in the first major outbreak of violent protest to martial law
since troops opened fire on striking miners shortly after military
crackdown began.
The Interior Ministry said eight police and six civilians were injured in
the rioting, and 205 people were put in detention and were to face sum
mary trials.
(Radio Warsaw reported an immediate government crackdown on
the city, with private telephone service cut off and civilians forbidden to
be on the streets after 8 p.m. or before 5 a.m.)
(The broadcast, monitored in European capitals, blamed the incident
on troublemakers "taking advantage" of recent relaxations of some
martial law restrictions — a move authorities had said was possible be
cause of growing calm across Poland.)
It was the worst clash reported in Gdansk, headquarters of the inde
pendent labor union Solidarity, since force was used to put down vi
olent demonstrations that erupted there shortly after the imposition of
martial law Dec. 13. On Dec. 16, state security forces opened fire on
demonstrating miners in southern Poland, killing seven by government
accounts. The military government has acknowledged two other deaths
