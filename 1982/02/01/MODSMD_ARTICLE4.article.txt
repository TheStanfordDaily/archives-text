Martial law incites riots
Warsaw — Policc fought street battles with youths in Gdansk over the
weekend in the first major outbreak of violent protest to martial law
since troops opened fire on striking miners shortly after military
crackdown began.
The Interior Ministry said eight police and six civilians were injured in
the rioting, and 205 people were put in detention and were to face sum
mary trials.
(Radio Warsaw reported an immediate government crackdown on
the city, with private telephone service cut off and civilians forbidden to
be on the streets after 8 p.m. or before 5 a.m.)
(The broadcast, monitored in European capitals, blamed the incident
on troublemakers "taking advantage" of recent relaxations of some
martial law restrictions — a move authorities had said was possible be
cause of growing calm across Poland.)
It was the worst clash reported in Gdansk, headquarters of the inde
pendent labor union Solidarity, since force was used to put down vi
olent demonstrations that erupted there shortly after the imposition of
martial law Dec. 13. On Dec. 16, state security forces opened fire on
demonstrating miners in southern Poland, killing seven by government
accounts. The military government has acknowledged two other deaths
in martial law protests.
The rioting did not appear to be connected with sweeping
food price increases to go into effect today, the biggest hikes
in Poland's post-war history.
The broadcast said the trouble erupted when groups of
young people failed to provoke passing workers in the street
into a demonstration.
The Interior Ministry said in a communique carried by PAP
that the disturbance began outside the giant V.I. Lenin ship
yards and appeared to spread or be accompanied by other
incidents in the city's center.
The state-run media has continually lashed out at Radio
Free Europe, Voice of America and other shortwave radio
programs for "instructing" Poles to oppose the martial law
authorities.
Unemployment rate may climb
Washington — The nation's unemployment rate could
climb as high as 10 percent — a full percentage point higher
than the post-World War II record of 9 percent — even if the
economy recovers this spring as the Reagan administration
expects, Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan said yester
day.
The unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent in December,
nudging the post-war record of 9 percent set during the 1975
recession. New unemployment figures, which will contain
the January jobless rate, are expected to be released later this
week by the Department of Labor.
Regan, in an interviewon CBS-TV's"Face the Nation,"said
that he agreed with a prediction by Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige that the unemployment rate is likely to
reach 10 percent before the economy rebounds.
In other economic projections, Regan said the consumer
price index, which fell to a four-year low of 8.9 percent in
1981, will probably average between 7 percent and 8 percent
this year while the prime lending rate will drop "well below"
its current 15.75 percent.
On Feb. 8, President Ronald Reagan will send a spending
plan to Congress for fiscal year 1983 that is expected to
project a record deficit of $100 billion for the current fiscal
year, around $90 billion for fiscal 1983 and almost $80 billion
for fiscal 1984.

China may accept arms sale
Peking — China indicated yesterday that it would accept
continued sales of some American arms to Taiwan if the
United States agreed in return to end all sales within a set
time.
Acommentary by the official New China News Agency put
on the public record for the first time Peking's readiness to
trade its acquiesence in the limited sales that Washington
wants to continue making for a complete cutoff eventually.
"Always mindful of the larger interests," the commentary
said, referring to the development of Sino-American
strategic relations, "China is willing to negotiate with the
United States for an end to the sales within a time limit."
Although the commentary insists that any sale is "in
disputably an act of infringement of China's sovereignity,"
Peking is willing to give due consideration to Washington,
which contends that the United States has commitments to
Taiwan's security that it must meet.
Such a deal would presumably resolve the prolonged im
passe in Sino-American relations over the question of con
tinued U.S. weapons sales to the Chinese Nationalists on
Taiwan, and Peking first proposed it to the Reagan adminis
tration three months ago when the sale of advanced war
planes was under consideration.
The Reagan administration, has since decided not to sell
the sophisticated fighter-bombers that Taiwan wanted,
saying that the Nationalists did not need them, but also ac
knowledging that their sale would have brought a rupture in
relations with Peking.
Old club burns in SF
San Francisco — Part of the roof of a ritzy men's club,
engulfed in flames, collapsed and trapped 10 firefighters and
injured at least four of them yesterday, officials said.
After the five-alarm blaze at the Concordia-Argonaut
Club was controlled, firefighters carried out paintings and
antique furniture. San Francisco Fire Department Chief An
drew Casper estimated damage to the three-story, 74-year
old structure at $2 million.
Casper said defective wiring may have cause the fire.
Arson investigators were also working on the blaze, Casper
said, but there was no reason to immediately suspect arson,
he said.

Egyptian border to reopen
Cairo, Egypt — Libya and Egypt have agreed to reopen
their border crossing points, closed three years ago after
Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel, the semi-official
newspaper Al-Ahram reported early today.
It viewed the move as anothersign of the relaxation of ten
sions between the two countries since Hosni Mubarak be
came president after the assassination of Anwar Sadat last
October.
Sadat and Libya's hard-line leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy, had waged a bitter campaign over Arab policies
toward Israel since the early days of the 1973 Middle East war.
Egypt and Libya fought a four-day border battle in the
summer of 1977.
Mubarak has ordered Egypt's state-controlled news media
to halt their war of words against Khadafy and reportedly has
thinned the concentration of Egyptian troops along the fron
tier with Libya.
Soviets may compromise
Washington — The Soviet Union is considering adopting a
unilateral moratorium on deployment of its intermediate
range SS-20 nuclear rockets in Europe now if a formula can
be found for a joint Soviet-American declaration to push the
Geneva talks on such weapons forward, a senior Soviet Com
munist Party official said yesterday.
If formally put forward by the Soviet leadership, such a
proposal would represent a shift in the Soviet position,
which until now has offered a moratorium only if the United
States agreed in advance to cancel its planned deployment of
572 new intermediate-range missiles in Western Europe be
ginning in December 1983.
The Geneva talks on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe
began on Nov. 30, with the U. S. delegation headed by Paul
Nitze. Yuli Kvitsinsky heads the Soviet team.

on the public record for the first time Peking's readiness to
trade its acquiesence in the limited sales that Washington
wants to continue making for a complete cutoff eventually.
"Always mindful of the larger interests," the commentary
said, referring to the development of Sino-American
strategic relations, "China is willing to negotiate with the
United States for an end to the sales within a time limit."
Although the commentary insists that any sale is "in
disputably an act of infringement of China's sovereignity,"
Peking is willing to give due consideration to Washington,
which contends that the United States has commitments to
Taiwan's security that it must meet.
Such a deal would presumably resolve the prolonged im
passe in Sino-American relations over the question of con
tinued U.S. weapons sales to the Chinese Nationalists on
Taiwan, and Peking first proposed it to the Reagan adminis
tration three months ago when the sale of advanced war
planes was under consideration.
The Reagan administration, has since decided not to sell
the sophisticated fighter-bombers that Taiwan wanted,
saying that the Nationalists did not need them, but also ac
knowledging that their sale would have brought a rupture in
relations with Peking.
Old club burns in SF
San Francisco — Part of the roof of a ritzy men's club,
engulfed in flames, collapsed and trapped 10 firefighters and
injured at least four of them yesterday, officials said.
After the five-alarm blaze at the Concordia-Argonaut
Club was controlled, firefighters carried out paintings and
antique furniture. San Francisco Fire Department Chief An
drew Casper estimated damage to the three-story, 74-year
old structure at $2 million.
Casper said defective wiring may have cause the fire.
Arson investigators were also working on the blaze, Casper
said, but there was no reason to immediately suspect arson,
he said.

Egyptian border to reopen
Cairo, Egypt — Libya and Egypt have agreed to reopen
their border crossing points, closed three years ago after
Egypt signed a peace treaty with Israel, the semi-official
newspaper Al-Ahram reported early today.
It viewed the move as anothersign of the relaxation of ten
sions between the two countries since Hosni Mubarak be
came president after the assassination of Anwar Sadat last
October.
Sadat and Libya's hard-line leader, Col. Moammar
Khadafy, had waged a bitter campaign over Arab policies
toward Israel since the early days of the 1973 Middle East war.
Egypt and Libya fought a four-day border battle in the
summer of 1977.
Mubarak has ordered Egypt's state-controlled news media
to halt their war of words against Khadafy and reportedly has
thinned the concentration of Egyptian troops along the fron
tier with Libya.
Soviets may compromise
Washington — The Soviet Union is considering adopting a
unilateral moratorium on deployment of its intermediate
range SS-20 nuclear rockets in Europe now if a formula can
be found for a joint Soviet-American declaration to push the
Geneva talks on such weapons forward, a senior Soviet Com
munist Party official said yesterday.
If formally put forward by the Soviet leadership, such a
proposal would represent a shift in the Soviet position,
which until now has offered a moratorium only if the United
States agreed in advance to cancel its planned deployment of
572 new intermediate-range missiles in Western Europe be
ginning in December 1983.
The Geneva talks on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe
began on Nov. 30, with the U. S. delegation headed by Paul
Nitze. Yuli Kvitsinsky heads the Soviet team.

Martial law incites riots
Warsaw — Policc fought street battles with youths in Gdansk over the
weekend in the first major outbreak of violent protest to martial law
since troops opened fire on striking miners shortly after military
crackdown began.
The Interior Ministry said eight police and six civilians were injured in
the rioting, and 205 people were put in detention and were to face sum
mary trials.
(Radio Warsaw reported an immediate government crackdown on
the city, with private telephone service cut off and civilians forbidden to
be on the streets after 8 p.m. or before 5 a.m.)
(The broadcast, monitored in European capitals, blamed the incident
on troublemakers "taking advantage" of recent relaxations of some
martial law restrictions — a move authorities had said was possible be
cause of growing calm across Poland.)
It was the worst clash reported in Gdansk, headquarters of the inde
pendent labor union Solidarity, since force was used to put down vi
olent demonstrations that erupted there shortly after the imposition of
martial law Dec. 13. On Dec. 16, state security forces opened fire on
demonstrating miners in southern Poland, killing seven by government
accounts. The military government has acknowledged two other deaths
in martial law protests.
The rioting did not appear to be connected with sweeping
food price increases to go into effect today, the biggest hikes
in Poland's post-war history.
The broadcast said the trouble erupted when groups of
young people failed to provoke passing workers in the street
into a demonstration.
The Interior Ministry said in a communique carried by PAP
that the disturbance began outside the giant V.I. Lenin ship
yards and appeared to spread or be accompanied by other
incidents in the city's center.
The state-run media has continually lashed out at Radio
Free Europe, Voice of America and other shortwave radio
programs for "instructing" Poles to oppose the martial law
authorities.
Unemployment rate may climb
Washington — The nation's unemployment rate could
climb as high as 10 percent — a full percentage point higher
than the post-World War II record of 9 percent — even if the
economy recovers this spring as the Reagan administration
expects, Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan said yester
day.
The unemployment rate stood at 8.9 percent in December,
nudging the post-war record of 9 percent set during the 1975
recession. New unemployment figures, which will contain
the January jobless rate, are expected to be released later this
week by the Department of Labor.
Regan, in an interviewon CBS-TV's"Face the Nation,"said
that he agreed with a prediction by Secretary of Commerce
Malcolm Baldrige that the unemployment rate is likely to
reach 10 percent before the economy rebounds.
In other economic projections, Regan said the consumer
price index, which fell to a four-year low of 8.9 percent in
1981, will probably average between 7 percent and 8 percent
this year while the prime lending rate will drop "well below"
its current 15.75 percent.
On Feb. 8, President Ronald Reagan will send a spending
plan to Congress for fiscal year 1983 that is expected to
project a record deficit of $100 billion for the current fiscal
year, around $90 billion for fiscal 1983 and almost $80 billion
for fiscal 1984.
