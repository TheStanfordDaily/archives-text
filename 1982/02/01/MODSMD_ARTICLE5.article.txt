# Engineering professor Roth says University ignores espionage here
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth, citing a faculty com
mittee report published by Harvard
in 1977, said Friday that while covert
activities take place on more than 100
university campuses across the coun
try, they have continued here be
cause the University has chosen not
to set guidelines governing campus
activities of domestic and foreign in
telligence agencies.
Roth, who was scheduled to host
the recently-canceled visit of Soviet
robotics expert Nikolai Umnov,
spoke to 20 members of a Protest and
Survive study group in Terman Engi
neering Center.
"Most people tend to think these
things are in the past," said Roth. The
covert activities "may have stopped

for a little bit, or slowed down for
awhile, but now it's my sense that it's
kind of speeding up again.
"What's really amazing is that the
administration at Stanford has never
touched it, the faculty senate has
never touched it."
Roth described the actions taken
several years ago by Harvard to con
trol spying on campus. Following
President Derrick Bok's testimony
before the Committee on Foreign
Relations, Harvard and a number of
other universities responded to the
committee's direction for college ad
ministrations to establish their own
guidelines for intelligen* e agents on
campus.
Roth said that 'Stanford was not
responsive at all in any official
manner" in setting rules governing

covert activities of agents here.
Giving several accounts of contacts
he and others have had on campus
with agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and Central In
telligence Agency (CIA), Roth said
that domestic intelligence agencies
recruit students as well as faculty
both to assist in the identification of
important intelligence figures on
campusand to utilize their special ac
cess to sensitive information when
traveling to foreign campuses.
"The problem," said Roth, "is that
a professor should not have a covert
relationship with an agency like that
if he's using that covert activity in part
of his job. When my colleagues meet
me, they should not worrv if they're
talking to me. a scholar, or they're
talking to me, an agent."
