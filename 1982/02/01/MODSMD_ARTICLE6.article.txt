# Rat research indicates both mild, serious effects
## Scientist questions Malathion safety 
### Jiri Weiss 
The pesticide malathion, currently
being used in the fight against the
Mediterranean fruit fly, is dangerous
to your health, according to Dr.
Melvin Reuber, an independent re
searcher and former head of the ex
perimental pathology laboratory at
the Frederick Cancer Research Cen
ter in Maryland.
Reuber spoke to an audience of 40
at the Palo Alto Unitarian Church Fri
day, at a forum organized by the
Campaign Against Spraying, a local
volunteer organization.
Reuber said that the ingestion or
absorption of malathion through the
lungs and skin can have anything
from "mild" to "serious" effects. Re
uber's analysis contradicts official
statements that malathion is a rela

tively harmless substance.
In its mildest form, Reuber said,
malathion poisoning can cause loss
of appetite and dizziness, but high
risk individuals such as pregnant
women or people suffering from
heart disease, emphysema and
asthma can have much more serious
symptoms, such as abdominal
cramps, diarrhea, respiratory distress
and convulsions. The exposure to
high doses can cause coma and
death, he said.
Reuber cited several of more than
200 case histories compiled by the
Campaign Against Spraying. One
female phone company employee
"missed a month of work." Both
sides of her face turned red, Reuber
said, and she suffered from head
aches. A 60-year-old man who was

outside during the spraying missed
100 days of work. Reuber continued;
a social worker lost her job because
of "pulmonary disease and chronic
fatigue"; and a 3-year-old boy ex
posed to malathion exhibited symp
toms including sweating, nausea,
diarrhea and loss of appetite. In addi
tion, there have been reports — con
nected with the spraying — of still
births among animals, Reuber said.
In his talk Reuber stressed that a
complete risk assessment — especial
|y on the long range effects of
maiathion spraying — is impossible
not only because of the lack of any
studies on humans but also because
of the ease with which the
hypothetical situations used in risk
assessment can be varied, for exam
ple, the estimates of the amount of

pesticide a 20-pound baby receive?
\.l ry with She situation — the amourr
.• >aby absorb , while crawling wi
lifter from the amount it absorb
w:iile walking, and a research r
could choose whichever figure he
preferred, Reuber said.
Von can't believe all the repels
you get," Reuber said, charging t at
results obtained in chemical indu try
studies are often biased.
Reuber's concern is not only with
risk assessment, but also with an mal
studies done on the effects of
malathion.
Reuber's unpublished, but much
publicized, paper, "Carcinogenicity
of Malathion and Malaoxon," links
malathion and its metabolite malaox
on — which Rueber claims is even
more toxic — to cancer in laboratory
animals. The paper directly disputes
the original findings of three studies
done by the National Cancer In
stitute.
In the NCI tests, rats and mice were
fed high doses of malathion. Later,
their organs, prepared on glass slides,
were examined for signs of cancer.
The results were compared with the
organs of a group with no malathion
in their diet. According to the NCI,
the incidence of cancer among the
malathion-dosed animals was not
significantly higher.
Reuber, at the time sti\\ employed

by the Frederick Cancer Research
Center, examined the more than
24,000 slides used in the studies and
concluded that the incidence of
benign and malignant tumors in a
number of different organs was sig
nificantly greater in the animals that
had been fed the pesticide over long
periods of time than in the control
group — a review that directly con
tradicts the original findings.
In March, 1981, as the malathion
debate was warming up, Reuber
wrote of his findings to the director
of the California Department of Food
and Agriculture, Richard Rominger.
Reuber made his results public,
bypassing the normal procedure of
peer review in the scientific com
munity.
