# El Salvador: inside a revolutionary camp

### Washington Post 
Morazan Province, El Salvador —
I"This is an anthill," said Jorge
Melendez, alias Jonas, commander of
the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front's
• northeastern forces. The hill on which
• he sat overlooks an unnaturally silent,
deep, small valley, buried among the
green mountains of Morazan Province
I in northeastern El Salvador.
"This is an anthill," Melendez re
peated, and from one of 100 invisible
footpaths the first water carrier ap
peared, perspiring from the effort of
balancing a full jug on his head straight
uphill for 15 minutes.
Over the last two years, guerrillas of
the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front,

fighting to overthrow the U.S.-sup
ported Christian Democratic-military
government, have increased their hold
on portions of northern El Salvador.
During a two-week visit tothis northern
zone, conversations and observations
indicated that the guerrillas are follow
ing a two-pronged strategy in the ex
pectation that they can force the gov
ernment to negotiate with them.
First, they are attempting to con
solidate their hold on more pockets of
territory, like the one visited, with pop
ulations that are self-sufficient, stable
and loyal. Second, the guerrillas are in
creasing the frequency and intensity of
their military attacks in the weeks pre
ceding elections the government has

scheduled for March.
The guerrillas agreed to take re
porters on guided trips through this
area in an evident effort to gain interna
tional credibility and to strengthen
their bargaining position in eventual
peace negotiations.
The water carrier nodded briefly to
Melendez and puffed on to the "bar
racks," a one-room adobe house where
another man immediately started ladl
ing some of the water over dirty plastic
cups and gourds used as dishes. A third
man cranked cornmeal for tortillas out
of a meat grinder, and a woman bent
over a stone mortar ground the meal
into an even finer paste that a second

woman then patted into large flat pat
ties and placed on a grill to bake.
There are an estimated 6000 people
living in this zone. The day-to-day ex
istence of the acampamentados, the
"camped-out ones", as they call them
selves, blurs distinctions between civil
ian and military populations.
A two-week stay in the "anthill" pro
vided one glimpse of El Salvador's civil
war as a home-grown insurrection, at
least in this region. The government in
San Salvador and the Reagan adminis
tration have repeatedly described El
Salvador's civil war as a foreign-inspired
and directed revolution that isessential
ly run by Cuba and other Soviet proxies.
