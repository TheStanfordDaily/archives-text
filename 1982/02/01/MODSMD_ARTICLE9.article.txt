# Volunteers deluge Jordan armed forces
## 
### Washington Post 
Amman, Jordan â€” Young
Jordanians by the hundreds
filed into armed forces offices
Saturday to join the volunteer
force that Jordan's Kipg
Hussein is sending to fight
alongside Iraq in the war
against Iran.
At one army conscription of
fice turned into a volunteers'
acceptance office, about 100
young Jordanians were busy
being processed to join the
"Yarmouk forces" volunteer
unit whose formation Hussein
announced Thursday night.
Most of the volunteers at the
Abdali office in central Amman
said in interviews that they
were joining the Yarmouk
forces because of their desire
to contribute in a practical
manner to the defense of what
they called "Arabism and the
Arab nation." Another com
mon theme among the Jor
danians, who were mostly be
tween 20 and 25 years old, was
the willingness to get bat
tlefront experience in the
Iraqi-Iranian war as prepara
tion for what they called "the
number one enemy of the
Arab world, Israel."
Many of the volunteers are
youths who recently have com

pleted their obligatory service
in the Jordanian armed forces,
and therefore could be sent to
the front with only slight re
training.
The volunteers did not know
exactly when they would travel
to Iraq but said they assumed
that they would go in with the
first contingent of the Yarmouk
forces within several weeks.
That first contingent is ex
pected to be led by Hussein,
who said he would go to Iraq
and spend as much time as pos
sible with the volunteer force.
There is no precise estimate
of the number of volunteers,
but judging from two en
listment offices in central Am
man, the Yarmouk forces
should attract several thousand
civilian Jordanians within the
coining weeks.
One of the young volun
teers, Mohammed Ali Hassan,
24, summed up the feelings of
most of his colleagues when he
said: "I had hoped to fight
alongside the Iraqis from the
first day of the war, but it is only
now that I have a chance to do
so. We are ready to fight forev
er and until the end."
Another volunteer, Ab
dullah Kabariti, 25, also struck a
common theme when he said

that he was "ready to fight be
cause my king has asked me to
and because it is my duty as an
Arab to fight in the defense of
Arabism and the name of the
Arabs."
At a briefing Friday, a U.S.
spokesman said the State De
partment would "have to wait
and see what develops" before
commenting specifically on
Jordan's move, which it said
appeared to involve volunteers
and not regular Jordanian
Army units.
"As we have said since the

outbreak of fighting, we do not
want to see the conflict
widen," the spokesman said
"Our concern over any action
that would tend to widen or
prolong the war is well-known;
we have supported efforts such
as those by the (United Na
tions) Set urity Council and the
Islamic nations to bring the
hostilities to an end and to find
a way for the parties to settle
their differences through ne
gotiations. The United States
believes that such efforts re
main both essential and ur
gent."
