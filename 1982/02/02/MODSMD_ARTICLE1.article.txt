# 150 arrested in Livermore protest
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Livermore — Alameda County
Sheriff's deputies last night con
tinued to hold more than 150 pro
testers, including Stanford under
graduates Doug Dietrich and Megan
Chesnut, who blocked commuters
from using the entrance gates to the
Lawrence Livermore National Labo
ratories (LLNL) early yesterday morn
ing. It was the first mass demonstra
tion at the labs in three years.
Singing "I lay down my body ... at
the Livermore/' and "No more
nukes," blockaders and a "support
group" of marchers and organizers
crowded all four entrance gates to
the labs for more than two hours,
forcing some employees to back
their cars away and walk to work.
But commuters faced a delay of no
more than 10 minutes because only
two gates at a time were completely
blocked, according to William Perry,
a spokesman for the labs. Perry also
said several hundred workers, antici
pating the demonstration, went to
work as early as 6 o'clock, further re
ducing the number of LLNL employ
ees inconvenienced by the civil dis
obedience action.
"We realize that we're not going to
stop production ..Dietrich, a
Stanford junior majoring in interna
tional relations, said. LLNL employ
ees "will probably be at work by 10
o'clock. But I can see no reason for
nuclear weapons. They invented the
the H-bomb and the neutron bomb
here. Are they doing us any good?"
"We just want people to think
about it (the threat of nuclear arms),"
Chesnut, a junior majoring in psy
chology, called as deputies hand
cuffed and carried her to a police van
waiting to transport blockaders to
LLNL grounds.
From lab property, protesters were
taken to Santa Rita, the Alameda
County Prison. Most were charged
with "obstructing a thoroughfare," a
violation of the state penal code, ac
cording to Sgt. Bert Wilkinson of the
Alameda County Sheriff's Depart
ment. Prisoners were then given the
choice of release yesterday on a

promise to appear or retention over
night to be arraigned today. All offers
of release on citation were refused,
according to Lanny Hershkoff, a
counselor for the Livermore Action
Group (LAG) Legal Group.
The maximum sentence for "ob
structing a thoroughfare" is $500
and/or six months in prison.
The nuclear weapons laboratory
has been managed by the University
of California since its creation in
1952. The labs are responsible for the
performance of atomic munitions, al
though Perry pointed out that "there
is never a bomb here." LLNL, and its
older counterpart at Los Alamos in
New Mexico, have been the design
source of all the nuclear weapons in
the U.S. arsenal.
The protesters called for "an end
to all nuclear weapons research and
proliferation, and LLNL's conversion
to research for peaceful purposes."
The demonstrators also raised ques
tions about the labs' relationship to
the UC system, saying that the labs
hide behind the university's air of re
spectability.
Joseph Moore, member of the UC
Board of Regents, which has a final
say in decisions concerning the labs,
told the Daily he knew of no pro
posals to drastically change the rela
tionship between LLNL and Cal. "But
the lab has changed significantly in
recent years," Moore said. "Over 50
percent of the work (done at Liver
more) is now non-classified. It was
much less in recent years."
"I'd like to see (LLNL) divested
from the university," said Paul
Sawyer, a Unitarian minister and an
active member of LAG, which or
ganized the civil disobedience ac
tion.
Perry said LLNL has no plans to
make a formal response to the de
mands. Higher lab officials were un
available for comment.
LAG organized the demonstration
as a climax to an anti-nuclear rally
and march held in Berkeley Saturday.

and the Lawrence weapons lab," said
Sawyer. "This is just the first of many
future actions."
"I think there's a need to look at
what's happening in Europe and how
they've been able to mount an effec
tive campaign against Reagan's mili
tarism," said Nancy Stroll, a self-iden
tified "peacekeeper" who led the
support march. "It's all a part of the
new Peace movement that needs to
be built in this country."
The consensus on both sides was
that the demonstration was "peace
ful" and "well-handled." But LLNL
employees had mixed reactions to
the protest. "I think they're a bunch
of misguided individuals," said an

engineer about the activists who
swarmed around his car as he tried to
enter the labs' southwest gate. "They
don't realize where their best in
terest lies ... in protecting this coun
try from the communist takeover."
The man refused to give his name to
the Daily.
"It's ridiculous to hold up people's
jobs like this," said one lab employee
after she had pushed her way
through the blockade.
"I think it's an American right,"
said Perry. "I support demonstrations
like this ... I myself participated in
the civil rights rallies of 20 yearsago."
"It's an important issue that needs
to be brought to the attention of the
American people," said Mark
Gordon, a UC-Berkeley alumnus

who participated in the support
march. "(Awareness) starts with small
demonstrations like this one here."
"There's a good (anti-) nuclear
movement at Stanford, but it's been
really small," added Adam Stein, also
a Berkeley alumnus. "The movement
is being reborn at Berkeley . . . slow
ly. The conservative element is very
strong."
Protesters, many of them lying
down in the road and refusing to
move until carried, adhered to the
priciple of non-violence throughout
the demonstration. Some of the
demonstrators cried as they were
loaded into police vans, one woman
saying to a deputy, "Bombs will hurt
you too .. ." Blockaders refused to
talk directly with the press and re
ferred the media to "peacekeeper"
spokesmen.
"We want to stop the bomb where

it starts," said Kathy Strauss, a spokes
woman for LAG. "This is a totally
non-violent act and we want to keep
the lines of communication open,"
Sawyer criticized the labs for being
evasive and not promoting dialogue
with the public. "The Department of
Defense and the military corps have a
lock-grip on the universities,"
Sawyer said. "It (nuclear research) is a
part of the campus and there's no
free dialogue. That kind of attitude
seeps through the whole university.
A university doesn't exist to make
bombs . . . does it?" "I don't think
we're cagey," Perry said. "We ha ve
no skeletons in the closet. We re
search weapons here. We design
neutron bombs, hydrogen bombs.
We have plutonium here, that's no
secret. The only secret is how these
things work, and that's classified in
formation."

The maximum sentence for "ob

The nuclear weapons laboratory
has been managed by the University
of California since its creation in
1952. The labs are responsible for the
performance of atomic munitions, al
though Perry pointed out that "there
is never a bomb here." LLNL, and its
older counterpart at Los Alamos in
New Mexico, have been the design
source of all the nuclear weapons in
the U.S. arsenal.
The protesters called for "an end
to all nuclear weapons research and
proliferation, and LLNL's conversion
to research for peaceful purposes."
The demonstrators also raised ques
tions about the labs' relationship to
the UC system, saying that the labs
hide behind the university's air of re
spectability.
Joseph Moore, member of the UC
Board of Regents, which has a final
say in decisions concerning the labs,
told the Daily he knew of no pro
posals to drastically change the rela
tionship between LLNL and Cal. "But
the lab has changed significantly in
recent years," Moore said. "Over 50
percent of the work (done at Liver
more) is now non-classified. It was
much less in recent years."
"I'd like to see (LLNL) divested
from the university," said Paul
Sawyer, a Unitarian minister and an
active member of LAG, which or
ganized the civil disobedience ac
tion.
Perry said LLNL has no plans to
make a formal response to the de
mands. Higher lab officials were un
available for comment.
LAG organized the demonstration
as a climax to an anti-nuclear rally
and march held in Berkeley Saturday.

Sawyer. "This is just the first of many
future actions."
"I think there's a need to look at
what's happening in Europe and how
they've been able to mount an effec

tarism," said Nancy Stroll, a self-iden

support march. "It's all a part of the
new Peace movement that needs to
be built in this country."
The consensus on both sides was
that the demonstration was "peace
ful" and "well-handled." But LLNL
employees had mixed reactions to
the protest. "I think they're a bunch
of misguided individuals," said an

engineer about the activists who
swarmed around his car as he tried to
enter the labs' southwest gate. "They
don't realize where their best in
terest lies ... in protecting this coun
try from the communist takeover."
The man refused to give his name to
the Daily.
"It's ridiculous to hold up people's
jobs like this," said one lab employee
after she had pushed her way
through the blockade.
"I think it's an American right,"
said Perry. "I support demonstrations
like this ... I myself participated in
the civil rights rallies of 20 yearsago."
"It's an important issue that needs
to be brought to the attention of the
American people," said Mark
Gordon, a UC-Berkeley alumnus

who participated in the support
march. "(Awareness) starts with small
demonstrations like this one here."
"There's a good (anti-) nuclear
movement at Stanford, but it's been
really small," added Adam Stein, also
a Berkeley alumnus. "The movement
is being reborn at Berkeley . . . slow
ly. The conservative element is very
strong."
Protesters, many of them lying
down in the road and refusing to
move until carried, adhered to the
priciple of non-violence throughout
the demonstration. Some of the
demonstrators cried as they were
loaded into police vans, one woman
saying to a deputy, "Bombs will hurt
you too .. ." Blockaders refused to
talk directly with the press and re
ferred the media to "peacekeeper"
spokesmen.
"We want to stop the bomb where

it starts," said Kathy Strauss, a spokes
woman for LAG. "This is a totally
non-violent act and we want to keep
the lines of communication open,"
Sawyer criticized the labs for being
evasive and not promoting dialogue
with the public. "The Department of
Defense and the military corps have a
lock-grip on the universities,"
Sawyer said. "It (nuclear research) is a
part of the campus and there's no
free dialogue. That kind of attitude
seeps through the whole university.
A university doesn't exist to make
bombs . . . does it?" "I don't think
we're cagey," Perry said. "We ha ve
no skeletons in the closet. We re
search weapons here. We design
neutron bombs, hydrogen bombs.
We have plutonium here, that's no
secret. The only secret is how these
things work, and that's classified in

Livermore — Alameda County
Sheriff's deputies last night con
tinued to hold more than 150 pro
testers, including Stanford under
graduates Doug Dietrich and Megan
Chesnut, who blocked commuters
from using the entrance gates to the
Lawrence Livermore National Labo
ratories (LLNL) early yesterday morn
ing. It was the first mass demonstra
tion at the labs in three years.
Singing "I lay down my body ... at
the Livermore/' and "No more
nukes," blockaders and a "support
group" of marchers and organizers
crowded all four entrance gates to
the labs for more than two hours,
forcing some employees to back
their cars away and walk to work.
But commuters faced a delay of no
more than 10 minutes because only
two gates at a time were completely
blocked, according to William Perry,
a spokesman for the labs. Perry also
said several hundred workers, antici
pating the demonstration, went to
work as early as 6 o'clock, further re
ducing the number of LLNL employ
ees inconvenienced by the civil dis
obedience action.
"We realize that we're not going to
stop production ..Dietrich, a
Stanford junior majoring in interna
tional relations, said. LLNL employ
ees "will probably be at work by 10
o'clock. But I can see no reason for
nuclear weapons. They invented the
the H-bomb and the neutron bomb
here. Are they doing us any good?"
"We just want people to think
about it (the threat of nuclear arms),"
Chesnut, a junior majoring in psy
chology, called as deputies hand
cuffed and carried her to a police van
waiting to transport blockaders to
LLNL grounds.
From lab property, protesters were
taken to Santa Rita, the Alameda
County Prison. Most were charged
with "obstructing a thoroughfare," a
violation of the state penal code, ac
cording to Sgt. Bert Wilkinson of the
Alameda County Sheriff's Depart
ment. Prisoners were then given the

and the Lawrence weapons lab," said
Sawyer. "This is just the first of many
future actions."
"I think there's a need to look at
what's happening in Europe and how
they've been able to mount an effec
tive campaign against Reagan's mili
tarism," said Nancy Stroll, a self-iden
tified "peacekeeper" who led the
support march. "It's all a part of the
new Peace movement that needs to
be built in this country."
The consensus on both sides was
that the demonstration was "peace
ful" and "well-handled." But LLNL
employees had mixed reactions to
the protest. "I think they're a bunch
of misguided individuals," said an

engineer about the activists who
swarmed around his car as he tried to
enter the labs' southwest gate. "They
don't realize where their best in
terest lies ... in protecting this coun
try from the communist takeover."
The man refused to give his name to
the Daily.
"It's ridiculous to hold up people's
jobs like this," said one lab employee
after she had pushed her way
through the blockade.
"I think it's an American right,"
said Perry. "I support demonstrations
like this ... I myself participated in
the civil rights rallies of 20 yearsago."
"It's an important issue that needs
to be brought to the attention of the
American people," said Mark
Gordon, a UC-Berkeley alumnus

who participated in the support
march. "(Awareness) starts with small
demonstrations like this one here."
"There's a good (anti-) nuclear
movement at Stanford, but it's been
really small," added Adam Stein, also
a Berkeley alumnus. "The movement
is being reborn at Berkeley . . . slow
ly. The conservative element is very
strong."
Protesters, many of them lying
down in the road and refusing to
move until carried, adhered to the
priciple of non-violence throughout
the demonstration. Some of the
demonstrators cried as they were
loaded into police vans, one woman
saying to a deputy, "Bombs will hurt
you too .. ." Blockaders refused to
talk directly with the press and re
ferred the media to "peacekeeper"
spokesmen.
"We want to stop the bomb where

it starts," said Kathy Strauss, a spokes
woman for LAG. "This is a totally
non-violent act and we want to keep
the lines of communication open,"
Sawyer criticized the labs for being
evasive and not promoting dialogue
with the public. "The Department of
Defense and the military corps have a
lock-grip on the universities,"
Sawyer said. "It (nuclear research) is a
part of the campus and there's no
free dialogue. That kind of attitude
seeps through the whole university.
A university doesn't exist to make
bombs . . . does it?" "I don't think
we're cagey," Perry said. "We ha ve
no skeletons in the closet. We re
search weapons here. We design
neutron bombs, hydrogen bombs.
We have plutonium here, that's no
secret. The only secret is how these
things work, and that's classified in
formation."
