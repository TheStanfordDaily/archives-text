## Reagan's quest for Golden Age finds crackpot economics 
### 
President Ronald Reagan is a contemporary de
mogogue. For over two years now he has purposely de
luded the American public, perpetrating the basest of
charades in trying to make the "masses" swallow his
crackpot, economically unsound plans for national re
vitalization. During the campaign he led a nation that
was weary of Iran and a seemingly powerless president to
believe that a golden age of American prosperity could
be restored.
He suggested a time when the beat cop on Main Street
could wander contentedly from corner to corner, dis
turbed only by a precocious youngster trying to snatch a
candy bar. Reagan acts as if patting us on the head, read
ing a bedtime story, and tucking us in for the night areall
we need to set this country on the road "to the good old
days."
Tuesday night's State of the Union address was anoth
er tirade by a confused, unsophisticated man who is in
capable of understanding the economy, who doodles on
notepads during foreign policy briefings, and who is un
able to respond coherently to the most basic of queries
by reporters at press conferences. Reagan's refusal to
raise taxes, and to restore some of the revenues lost to
the national treasury due to the Kemp-Roth bill, assures
that there will be a deficit in excess of $100 billion.
Although the Reagan administration flip-flopped on
whether deficits can cause inflation, the basic result is
deficits will cause pressure on the credit
markets, sending interest rates skyrocketing, choking
out private investment, and sending inflation spiralling.

This will continue well past the supposed "recovery" in
the second half of 1982.
The downward spiral will jettison blacks, women, the
poor, and others onto the streets, sending unemploy
ment rates towards the high levels that Great Britain has
experienced. Higher joblessness will augment the need
for federal bail-out through unemployment compensa
tion. Persistent inflation will increase the cost of servic
ing the national debt â€” both will further stimulate the
uncontrolled growth of the national deficit.
Transferral of several social welfare programs im
plemented during the Roosevelt and Johnson and Nixon
years to the state level will cause irreparable damage. As
with the Stockman budget, the "details have not been
worked out." Budget cutters will once again find it easier
to promise a "new federalism" than to deliver it. State
bureaucracies are unprepared for the massive paper
work and organizational machinery that would have to
be established in order for the transfered food stamp and
aid to dependent children programs to operate efficient
ly-
Furthermore, allocations of treasury revenues to these
programs would vary from state to state, exacerbating
the problem of income inequality. In fact, some state
might choose not to set up these programs at all. The
Reagan administration's inherently racist (labelled "col
or-blind") tendencies exhibit themselves in this "new
federalism," which would allow Southern states to deny
the benefits of these programs to blacks.
These questions are so critical to the future of our

country that they cease to be merely "ideological";
criticism of Reagan policies spews from Republicans and
Democrats alike. The issues are so vital that one cannot
lightly dismiss denunciation of the policies as the frus
trated, bitter accusations of the "poor loser" Democrats.
Relations with the Soviet Union are the worst since the
Truman administration. Nine years of dedicated

Reagan acts as if patting us on the
head, reading a bedtime story,
and tucking us in for the night are
all we need to set
this country on the road'to the
good old days/

bipartisan struggle to keep arms control alive has been
forgotten (it would seem, for the duration of the Reagan 1
administration). No progress has been made in the
Middle East since former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
and former President Jimmy Carter passed from the in
ternational scene. Policies in Africa are seen in a myopic,
"bi-polar" interpretive framework, as reflecting the
struggle of two superpowers (and not as the nationalistic
strivings of revolutionary movements).
Above all, a man with almost no experience in foreign
policy, William Clark, is at the helm of the National Se
curity Council. The Reagan "revolution" has left in its

wake the foreign and domestic policy decision-making
mechanisms in deep disarray.
If the public had bothered to listen to Carter's farewell
address, they might have realized that the "limits to
power" for America are real and irreversible. America
might have to relinquish its domination of the post-war
economy; inexpensive fuel is no longer to be found on
the global markets; the Soviet Union is now a super
power coequal; and the President often has to work with
a recalcitrant, increasingly independent Congress. These
might not be easy pills to swallow for a nation that likes
being "number one," but they are, as Carter asserted,
"inexorable historical movements" which we might not
be able to completely influence to our advantage.
Reagan, in publicy opposing the Panama Canal
treaties in 1978, accused the Carter White House of mis
leading the American people. He argued that "there'll
be a Madison Avenue advertising blitz, with billboards
and television spot ads" in support of the treaties. Rea
gan's State of the Union address was as spectacular as a
George M. Cohan musical but just as unsubstantive and
unrealistic. In fact, we might invoke Reagan's own re
sponse to Carter's 1978 "blitz" in order to interpret Rea
gan's current Broadway farce: "Don't believe a word of
it."
