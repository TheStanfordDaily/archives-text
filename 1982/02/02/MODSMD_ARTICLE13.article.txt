## University should increase housing rents, decrease tuition 
### 
I support the proposed increase in
Escondido Village rents. I pay $150 a
month. Not only is a 17 percent in
crease not unbearable, but prices
here would still be far below the $230
that the average off-campus student
pays for a comparable, yet less con
venient, dwelling. The actual dollar
increase is quite low, and is a high
percentage only of such a low base
figure.
Certainly many students are in fi
nancial need, especially married stu
dents with children, but this is not
limited to Escondido Village resi
dents. The University should commit
itself to holding down tuition, in
creasing support level, especially for
students with familiesor without oth
er means of support, or subsidizing
day-care, rather than blindly holding
down rents here in the hope of bene
fitting a few students who need help
(there are many who do not), and ig
noring those off campus.
The University is justified in charg
ing what it will; that the Village
"makes a profit" is irrelevant. It does
so because the money borrowed to
build it is almost payed off — should
someone living elsewhere on cam
pus pay more simply because he/she
lives in a building on which the Uni
versity owes money? The difference
between the present value of the
buildings and the land they are built
on and the debt remaining is as much
of general University resourcesasthe
endowment; it should benefit the
University and its people as a whole,
not just the lucky few in the housing

draw. That this money would be ap
plied to the construction of more
housing is appropriate, and, in view
of the housing problems faced by
those not lucky enough to get into
the Village, is overdue.

Re: STARTS, restart?
I was distressed when I learned that
STARTS (Student Arts at Stanford) has
denied the all-student band, Whip
ping Boy, the chance to play either in
the Coffee House or at a Tresidder
noon concert on the grounds (ex
tremely subjective, I'd say) that their
music is vulgar and depressing. The
question I'd like to raise is: where
(loes the only existing student arts
group that receives University sup
port draw the line in deciding wheth
er or not to support student artists? I
speak solely for myself (though I
know I reflect the opinion of many
others) in all that follows.
The role of STARTS should be,
above all, to allow students to public
ly exhibit their visual, cinematic or
musical art through whatever chan
nels possible. The fact that some of
this art may be rude and offensive to
STARTS members has to be over
looked or else the student art scene
here at Stanford will never get any
where — it will remain stagnant (as
many artists feel it is now). A lot of art
we consider "great" was equally
rude and offensive when it was new
to its circle — look at Picasso and the

Cubists, Salvador Dali, even the
Beatles (a la 1959). The point is that
STARTS should above all support stu
dents first and give them the gigs
rather than the "tasteful" non-stu
dent bands. Personal taste should not
dictate its decisions. (Many of the
"safe" bands hired offend my taste.)
If STARTS is worried about Whip
ping Boy doing physical damage to its
equipment or facilities, all I can say is
at least give them the opportunity to
prove they won't. If they do, fire
them and fine them, but at least give
them the chance to express them
selves. I don't feel STARTS would ma
lign its reputation by hiring the band;
if criticism were to be directed any
where, it would be directed at the
band, which accepts responsibility in
accepting the gig.
STARTS should not be a "censor"
organization nor a commercial one
designed to bring people to Tres
idder. Rather, it should be supportive
of student artists, or else it should
change its name. Maybe we student
artists should form another organiza
tion — RESTARTS (Real Student Arts
at Stanford) — and give the arts a sec
ond chance.

There is an alarming movement
taking place on campus. Groups of
students, resident assistants and resi
dent fellows are being asked to use
their residences as political entities to

express nuclear non-proliferation
sentiments. The movement led by
Jim Morrison (Daily, Jan. 26.), is ask
ing University residences to place
banners reading "Mutual Nuclear
Disarmament For We The People" on
the buildings. This movement is dan
gerous because: 1) Such banners
would label all house members as
supporters of the movement, 2) Such
statements would be interpreted by
University affiliates and the general
public as University endorsed
statements.
Tocqueville introduced the term
"tyranny of the majority" to the
world in 1835. This term is perfect for
describing the effects that this move
ment could have on minority view
points in our residences. While polit
ical education should be encouraged
as part of residential education, our
houses and dorms should not be
turned into political activist groups.
The rightsof individuals will be clear
ly threatened if they are.
While nuclear proliferation is a
subject that merits serious attention
and student awareness should be en
couraged, Morrison's proposal is a
step in the wrong direction. Univer
sity residences were created as places
to live and learn about living. Political
activist groups were created to ex
press and further the interests of simi
larly inclined politicos. To combine
the two would be a serious error.

them the chance to express them

if criticism were to be directed any

band, which accepts responsibility in
accepting the gig.
STARTS should not be a "censor"
organization nor a commercial one
designed to bring people to Tres
idder. Rather, it should be supportive
of student artists, or else it should
change its name. Maybe we student
artists should form another organiza
tion — RESTARTS (Real Student Arts
at Stanford) — and give the arts a sec

There is an alarming movement
taking place on campus. Groups of
students, resident assistants and resi
dent fellows are being asked to use
their residences as political entities to

express nuclear non-proliferation
sentiments. The movement led by
Jim Morrison (Daily, Jan. 26.), is ask
ing University residences to place
banners reading "Mutual Nuclear
Disarmament For We The People" on
the buildings. This movement is dan
gerous because: 1) Such banners
would label all house members as
supporters of the movement, 2) Such
statements would be interpreted by
University affiliates and the general
public as University endorsed
statements.
Tocqueville introduced the term
"tyranny of the majority" to the
world in 1835. This term is perfect for
describing the effects that this move
ment could have on minority view
points in our residences. While polit
ical education should be encouraged
as part of residential education, our
houses and dorms should not be
turned into political activist groups.
The rightsof individuals will be clear
ly threatened if they are.
While nuclear proliferation is a
subject that merits serious attention
and student awareness should be en
couraged, Morrison's proposal is a
step in the wrong direction. Univer
sity residences were created as places
to live and learn about living. Political
activist groups were created to ex
press and further the interests of simi
larly inclined politicos. To combine
the two would be a serious error.

I support the proposed increase in
Escondido Village rents. I pay $150 a
month. Not only is a 17 percent in
crease not unbearable, but prices
here would still be far below the $230
that the average off-campus student
pays for a comparable, yet less con
venient, dwelling. The actual dollar
increase is quite low, and is a high
percentage only of such a low base
figure.
Certainly many students are in fi
nancial need, especially married stu
dents with children, but this is not
limited to Escondido Village resi
dents. The University should commit
itself to holding down tuition, in
creasing support level, especially for
students with familiesor without oth
er means of support, or subsidizing
day-care, rather than blindly holding
down rents here in the hope of bene
fitting a few students who need help
(there are many who do not), and ig
noring those off campus.
The University is justified in charg
ing what it will; that the Village
"makes a profit" is irrelevant. It does
so because the money borrowed to
build it is almost payed off — should
someone living elsewhere on cam
pus pay more simply because he/she
lives in a building on which the Uni
versity owes money? The difference
between the present value of the
buildings and the land they are built
on and the debt remaining is as much
of general University resourcesasthe
endowment; it should benefit the
University and its people as a whole,
not just the lucky few in the housing

draw. That this money would be ap
plied to the construction of more
housing is appropriate, and, in view
of the housing problems faced by
those not lucky enough to get into
the Village, is overdue.

Re: STARTS, restart?
I was distressed when I learned that
STARTS (Student Arts at Stanford) has
denied the all-student band, Whip
ping Boy, the chance to play either in
the Coffee House or at a Tresidder
noon concert on the grounds (ex
tremely subjective, I'd say) that their
music is vulgar and depressing. The
question I'd like to raise is: where
(loes the only existing student arts
group that receives University sup
port draw the line in deciding wheth
er or not to support student artists? I
speak solely for myself (though I
know I reflect the opinion of many
others) in all that follows.
The role of STARTS should be,
above all, to allow students to public
ly exhibit their visual, cinematic or
musical art through whatever chan
nels possible. The fact that some of
this art may be rude and offensive to
STARTS members has to be over
looked or else the student art scene
here at Stanford will never get any
where — it will remain stagnant (as
many artists feel it is now). A lot of art
we consider "great" was equally
rude and offensive when it was new
to its circle — look at Picasso and the

Cubists, Salvador Dali, even the
Beatles (a la 1959). The point is that
STARTS should above all support stu
dents first and give them the gigs
rather than the "tasteful" non-stu
dent bands. Personal taste should not
dictate its decisions. (Many of the
"safe" bands hired offend my taste.)
If STARTS is worried about Whip
ping Boy doing physical damage to its
equipment or facilities, all I can say is
at least give them the opportunity to
prove they won't. If they do, fire
them and fine them, but at least give
them the chance to express them
selves. I don't feel STARTS would ma
lign its reputation by hiring the band;
