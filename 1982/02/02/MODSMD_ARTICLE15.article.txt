# Cardinal hoopsters blow another

Tucson, Ariz. — Stanford
dropped its sixth straight basket
ball game last night, losing to hap
less Arizona 61-54 and committing
21 turnovers in the process.
Stanford missed all six first-half
freethrow attempts and fell to a
six-point halftime deficit.
"We passed our free throw
problems the first night off as a
freak because we knew we were a
good free throw-shooting team,"
coach Dick Dißiaso said. "Tonight
was a carry over from that. If we
had made some free throws, we
would have been in the game."
Arizona, picking up its first con
ference win, did everything pos
sible to let Stanford back in the
game. The Wildcats hit only seven
of 18 second-half free throw at

tempts, enabling Stanford's foul
ing to pay off.
Arizona played an aggressive
zone and shut the door on Stan
ford's offense.
"You shouldn't have that many
turnovers against a zone," an an
gry Dißiaso continued. "You have
to credit Arizona though.
"They were all over Johnny
Rogers on the perimeter and
Brian Welch didn't always get the
ball. They took the inside away
and we turned it over. You can't
score if you turn the ball over."
Stanford dropped 1-8 in the
conference and 6-12 overall.
John Revelli led all scorers with
19 points before fouling out with
2:45 remaining.
Rogers scored 14 — mostly off
the offensive board — and

grabbed a game-high 13 re
bounds. Stanford outrebounded
Arizona 44-35.
Welch scored 12 points and
now needs only two more to
move into eighth place on the
Stanford all-time scoring ladder.
The Cardinal shot a lethargic 39
percent (23-59) from the field and
53 percent (8-15) from the line. Ar
izona shot an equally poor 45 per
cent (27-60) from the field and 39
percent (7-18) from the line.
Greg Cook led the Wildcat scor
ing with 18 points, but Ricky Walk
er controlled the offense with 10
assists.
"I think it got out of hand,"
Dißiaso said "We got down by 10
or 12 points and were forced to
play a fast game — that is not what
we wanted to do."
