## Even with a new lineup, is it safe to like Foreigner? 
### David Schmelzer 
i When we were within a few miles of the
concert my friend Gilroy hit me in
the arm.
"I knew this would happen," he said.
/'That's Bob and John over there in the
puster. Why did I let you take me to this?"
> I told him that they probably wouldn't see
,him and that they couldn't kid him too
much. After all, they were here, too.
"I'll walk with a limp." I didn't think Gilroy
was listening to me. "I'll change the part in
my hair, just a second." He pawed through
-we things in his glove compartment. "Thank
God," he said. "I remembered to bring
_along the inflatable hump."
"Come on. Foreigner's not that bad."
"This is the same band that did 'Dirty
; White Boy'?"
i"/ "Well yes, but..."
'"These are the guys with the album cover
'"'of that girl huddled down by a urinal, look
< - ing like she's about to be attacked?"
"Now that's not fair," I said. "That was a
while ago. Most people, even most of the
•> critics, like their new album. They've
!'changed the band around lot. Mick Jones
that they weren't doing the best
» >they could, so they got rid of lan McDonald,
LSI Greenwood, and Ed Gagliardi, and picked
up some bass player. At least they're trying."
n. "Somehow I don't understand the logic
here,"Gilroy said. "Maybe you can explain it
to me. How does firing three guys and pick
ing up someone who doesn't write or sing
add anything substantial to the band?"
"Shut up. Just shut up," I said, and Gilroy
smiled.
~L "Have you heard Foreigner 4?" I asked,
'"never liking to let an argument just sit there.
"There's some pretty good stuff there.

They've got this quick bass tempo on 'Ur
gent' that they never used before. No more
of th.it slow, pounding stuff. And they got Jr.
Walker to agree to do a sax solo. Rolling
Stone called it the second best car radio sin
gle of the year."
"That's true. And they've also got 'I'm
Gonna Win' and 'Woman in Black' and 'Juke
Box Hero.' Real complex stuff there, Dave.
What's the problem; their metronome only
do the slow speeds?"
"They're trying though," I said. "They
even do some ballads — 'Girl on the Moon,'
'Waiting for a Girl like You'..."
"Not exactly poetry."
"No, but they're not all that bad either.
The band's branching out a bit. Look at a
song like 'Luanne'..."
"I hate 'Luanne.' "
"I like it, but that's not my point. The
band's lightening up; they're having some
fun with their music now."
"Have you listened to 'I'm Gonna Win'?"
Gilroy asked.
"Okay, they're having fun with some of
their music now."
Gilroy found a parking spot and pulled in.
He looked around for a moment, rubbed his
eyes a few times, and then said, "Look,
you're a big guy. Block me out if you see any
one I know."
After we made our way through the
massive line (it was all general admission
seating — I guess the promoter, Bill Graham,
figures this makes a concert more pleasant
for the audience) Gilroy was still anony
mous, so I thought he might be a little more
inclined to enjoy himself.
My hopes were smashed soon after the
concert started. On the second number, lit
tle Lou Graham sang "Dirty White Boy,"

which I'd hoped he wouldn't do, for Gilroy's
sake.
"He's a pretty emotional singer, though," I
said hopefully. "Look at the way he's got the
crowd worked up." The people on the floor
level were raising their arms and moving
them up and down in time to the music.
Some in the crowd were jumping around, or
putting their girlfriends on their shoulders so
they could see. Gilroy was unimpressed.
I decided I'd rather listen to the musicthan
talk to him, so I didn't say anything for a few
songs. When the band played "Blue Morn
ing, Blue Day" I commented that I'd always
rather liked the song, but Gilroy gave me a
look of such disdain that I went back to my
silence.

'They weren't g00d...
They have no talent. But
they weren't as bad as I
thought they'd be.. /
—Gilroy, no fan
of Foreigner's

During this time Foreigner seemed to
work at a frantic pitch. They played "Cold As
Ice," their single from long ago, which their
audience responded particularly violently
to. Then they played "Luanne" and a curly
haired, white-suited Frankie Avalon type
(who I think is named Mark Rivera) rushed
down to the stage level and very energetical
ly played the saxaphone. He played with one
hand sometimes. He pointed at a girl in the

front row. To his left Mick Jones and Rick
Wills played their guitars in a firing line. I
thought he was very good and I liked the
song even more than I had before and I said
so.
"It's amazing the way this 'streamlined'
four-man band has seven members," Gilroy
said in response. "That guy with the sax ran
down from that top level where he's been
playing with two other guys. It would take
seven more to make them sound good."
Above the stage someone was dropping
two Venetian blinds, which were lit by shad
owy red spotlights. The piano player began a
slow introduction to a newly arranged
"Waiting For a Girl Like You." Gilroy rested
his head in his hands. "I can't take this," he
said. "Gramm isn't even following the
melody." Gramm did seem to have some
trouble at first, but soon he got it.
"Hey look! A big inflatable jukebox!" I
said as the thing was erected quickly while
the band played "Juke Box Hero."
"This ... is originality," Gilroy said sol
emnly.
After they finished by dramatically slam
ming the jukebox down, one of the
bandmembers said into his microphone,
"It's an emergency," which referred to a line
from "Urgent." Everybody (except Gilroy)
yelled and they started to play. Frankie
Avalon spun back on with hissaxaphone and
winked, pointed, and held the sax in one
hand. I wanted to see how well he'd do with
Jr. Walker's solo, since Jr. Walker's supposed
to be very good. Frankie didn't try to hit the
high, screeching notes, but he still did very
well. The band looked to be having a good
time and I thought that, if the concert were a
musical play, "Urgent" would be the show
stopper. They probably should have saved

the song for later, because they didn't match
it again.
Two numbers later, Lou Gramm said
"Good night" very loudly and then they left,
but the house lights didn't come up and
none of the audience moved. Gilroy ex
plained to me that concerts never ended un
til the singers said "good night" at least two
or three times.
About four minutes went by as people
clapped and lit cigarette lighters before For
eigner came back on stage, looking un
surprised that all the people weren't outside
by now, waiting in a traffic jam inthe parking
lot.
"San Francisco! Are you 'Hot Blooded'?"
yelled a person in the band.
"These guys really have a knack for
dialogue," Gilroy said. "Brilliant stuff. I'm
not surprised their lyrics are as good as they
are."
They sang "Hot Blooded" and then they
sang "Headknocker" then they took a very
long bow and left for good.
On our way back to his car, I noticed
Gilroy seemed to have cheered up.
"They weren't good," he said. "They
weren't good at all," he said. "They have no
talent. But they weren't as bad as I thought
they'd be."
I nodded and we continued to walk as
men offered us hashish and cocaine. When
we got back to Gilroy's car, we found that
someone had broken into it and had stolen
his stereo, his four-way speakers, and his
wallet. Gilroy stepped back from his door
and made this choking sound. He looked up
and hung his head back as far as he could. It
was some time before he spoke.
"I hate Foreigner!" he finally yelled out to
the city.
