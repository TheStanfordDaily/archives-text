Reagan requests money for unemployed
Washington — President Reagan yesterday asked Congress to pro
vide another $2.3 billion this year to cope with the rising flood of un
employed workers and insure that the jobless will continue to get un
employment benefits.
The request reflects the increase from 7.4 percent to 8.9 percent in the
unemployment rate since Reagan became president. By current calcu
lations, nearly 9.5 million Americans are out of work.
The supplemental request would increase the amount set aside for
unemployment benefits and services about 60 percent from $3.8 billion
to $6.1 billion for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
The bulk of the new request — $1.4 billion — is in the form of loans to
the states to help them meet their obligations under current law.
Another $500 million would go to help pay for extended unemploy
ment benefits and another $343 million would be in grants to help states
process claims and to restore the staffing needed to help the un
employed find work.
Congress already has provided $1.9 billion to the states for unemploy
ment payments and has provided another $1.8 billion for loans. The new
request would add $1,447 billion in loans and $843 million in grants and
advances.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the new request is
needed because "the unemployment rate has risen to a rate higher than
assumed at the current appropriations level."
Speakes indicated the new funding would
not significantly increase the administration's
projections on the federal deficit, saying the
"majority (of the supplemental funding) was
predicted when the budget deficits were pre
dicted."
El Salvador may get extra aid
Washington — A top State Department of
ficial said yesterday that the Reagan adminis
tration ill ask Congress for an increase of about
$100 million in assistance to El Salvador this year.
It will also send $55 million in emergency mili
tary aid to replace aircraft lost in recent guerrilla
attacks.
The emergency aid, said the Assistant Secre
tary of State, Thomas Enders, will also assure
that El Salvador can defend itself against attacks
on the economy and on its electoral process.
But a spokesman for the Salvadoran guerrillas
says that nothing short of sending American
combat troops to El Salvador can prevent the
eventual defeat of the U.S.-backed government
there.
Ruben Zamora, a representative of the guer
rilla movement, said Sunday that new U.S. mili
tary shipments to the embattled government
forces will only prolong the killing.
In December, Congress approved a foreign
aid bill that included $40 million in economic
aid and $25 million in mil the Senate Foreign Re
lations subcommittee on the Western Hemi
sphere.
Price rises in Poland
Warsaw — Martial law authorities raised
prices for food and fuel 200 to 400 percent yes
terday, but most Poles accepted the blow with
quiet resignation.
The official media warned of bare cupboards
to come.
Warsaw streets were quiet and there were no
apparent protests in big factories on the city's
outskirts.
Due to the communications blackout isolat
ing Warsaw from other Polish cities since
martial law was imposed Dec. 13, it was im
possible to determine the reaction to the price
hikes elsewhere in the country.
The Polish news agency PAP said the U.S.
cutoff of corn shipments to Poland would trig
ger collapse of the chicken market, since
farmers needed the grain for feed.
In Paris, the daily newspaper Le Monde pub

lished a purported message yesterday from Sol
idarity leader Lech Walesa, who was quoted as
saying: "I should not be surprised when they
begin to accuse me of absurdities. Fabricated,
of course, with the presentation of false testi
mony included."
The paper also published what it said was a
copy of the Polish government's order to intern
Walesa because he "would threaten the secur
ity of the state and public order because of his
anarchistic activities."
Layton retrial postponed
San Francisco — Government attorneys de
cided yesterday to postpone the scheduled re
trial of Larry Layton, the former Peoples Temple
member accused of conspiracy in the 1978
murder of California Rep. Leo Ryan.
U.S. Attorney Joseph Russioniello filed notice
yesterday that the government would appeal a
ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Peckham that excluded certain evidence prose
cutors wanted to use in the retrial, set to begin
today.
Lavton's first trial, which lasted six weeks and
reportedly cost $1.5 million, ended Sept. 26 in a
hung jury.
The government's action came after it had
analyzed Peckham's 35-page order rejecting
government requests to admit the evidence, in
cluding the tape recording of the last hour at
the temple's Jonestown settlement on Nov. 18,
1978.
The tape documents statements made by
temple leader Jim Jones in which he exhorts his
912 followers to join in an orgy of suicide and
murder at the temple.'s jungle encampment.
Ryan, three journalists and a temple defector
were killed and several people wounded earlier
that day on a nearby airstrip as they were pre
paring to leave the area.
Prosecutors considered the tape to be crucial
because they believe it established that a con
spiracy existed to kill Ryan.
Layton, 36, is charged with conspiracy to
murder the congressman and aiding and abet
ting in the slaying.
Indian-Pakistani talks begin
New Delhi — India and Pakistan moved
toward a no-war pact yesterday as the foreign
ministers of the two neighboring states agreed
that three days of talks here had cleared mutual
fears and misunderstandings that threatened to
drag them into a fourth armed conflict.

Pakistani Foreign Minister Agha Shahi ap
peared to have succeeded in easing some Indi
an doubts about the sincerity of his country's
September offer of a treaty of nonaggression
and nonuse of force, which New Delhi had con
sidered a potential trap.
As a result of this new understanding, Indian
Foreign Minister Narasimha Rao said in a joint
press conference, talks had started on a no-war
pact.
Shahi made it clear upon arrival Friday that
more talks will be needed before agreement
can be reached on the pact.
Pakistan also agreed to India's proposal to set
up a joint commission to meet regularly to dis
cuss bilateral issues and to open two more re
ligious shrines to Indian pilgrims. Both coun
tries decided to make fresh efforts to locate sol
diers missing in action from past wars, although
it appeared unlikely any would be found:
Inmate's execution stayed
Atlanta — A federal appeals court yesterday
stayed the execution of one of two Florida
death row inmates condemned to die in the
electric chair today, but took no immediate ac
tion on the other case.
The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
granted a stay to Anthony Antone, who wassen
tenced to die for the 1975 contract killing of a
former Tampa, Florida, police detective.
The court had not yet issued a ruling on a mo
tion for a stay for Ernest John Dobbert, also
scheduled to die today.
Dobbert, 43, was convicted in 1974 of tortur
ing and strangling his 9-year-old daughter.
Both Dobbert and Antone, 64, had exhausted
appeals in state courts.
