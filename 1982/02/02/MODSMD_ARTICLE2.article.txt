Reagan requests money for unemployed
Washington — President Reagan yesterday asked Congress to pro
vide another $2.3 billion this year to cope with the rising flood of un
employed workers and insure that the jobless will continue to get un
employment benefits.
The request reflects the increase from 7.4 percent to 8.9 percent in the
unemployment rate since Reagan became president. By current calcu
lations, nearly 9.5 million Americans are out of work.
The supplemental request would increase the amount set aside for
unemployment benefits and services about 60 percent from $3.8 billion
to $6.1 billion for the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1.
The bulk of the new request — $1.4 billion — is in the form of loans to
the states to help them meet their obligations under current law.
Another $500 million would go to help pay for extended unemploy
ment benefits and another $343 million would be in grants to help states
process claims and to restore the staffing needed to help the un
employed find work.
Congress already has provided $1.9 billion to the states for unemploy
ment payments and has provided another $1.8 billion for loans. The new
request would add $1,447 billion in loans and $843 million in grants and
advances.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the new request is
needed because "the unemployment rate has risen to a rate higher than
assumed at the current appropriations level."
