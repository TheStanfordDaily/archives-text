# Dead lovers and dull romance make for an enjoyable night

The Original Winter One
Acts lived up to their potential
at the Little Theatre by provid
ing refreshing slices of human
jjomedy and tragedy ranging
►from young love-turned-sour
,to old folks-turned-crazy. Pro
ducer Kevin Reidy, working
-well within the difficult con
lines of a three-week produc
tion period, professionally or
chestrated a fine evening's en
tertainment, providing an
arena for the talents of Stan
ford's aspiring writers, actors,
directors and designers. This
year's lineup includes four
short productions: Per
spectives, The Checker Came,
The Lamb Chop Murders, and
The Atchison, Topeka, and the
Santa Fe.
Perspectives, the opening
play written by Jackie Kanner,
presents the menage a trois
formula with a twist — number
three is dead. How he died and
how his best friend and his lov
er have dealt with the loss pro
vides the essence of the plot.
Kanner's choice of the artist's
medium provided a creative, if
slightly overworked vehicle for
her drama ("The people were
like a canvas for me") and her
theme of "perspectives" also
worked well into an abstract set

representing a triangular attic
studio.
The ideas are good, but the
writing is somewhat stilted.
Kanner maintains a seemingly
contrived suspense as she leads
the audience from obscurity to
a final understanding of both
the situation and the com
plicated emotional responses
of the characters.
Poorly integrated lines made
the actors' interpretation dif
ficult, and Margot Wright was
less than convincing as Nicola.
Her coldness toward Adam
(Brad Carpenter) lacked sub
tlety and her delivery was over
ly self-conscious. Nevertheless,
she created the most dramatic
moment in the play when she
let her hair down and,
mesmerized, reenacted a one
sided scene from her past af
fair.
Carpenter began a bit stiffly,
but warmed up to his part and
deserves congratulations for
what sounded like genuine
emotion and conviction in
making the predictable "I love
you Nicola" speech (It had to
be there somewhere).
A witty, tightly written script,
combined with delightfully
smooth and intelligent acting
made The Checker Came the
evening's best. Written by Rus
sell Leavitt, the play sensitively

focuses on the changes in a re
lationship between Frost and
Susan (played by Nick Ban
douveris and Ann Osmond),
two young lovers who have
moved in together and settled
into a seemingly dull routine in
the working world. The routine
obviously upsets Frost, as he
pleads for a "louder, brighter
love," as they had before,
when they didn't have to "wait
for the weekend". A checker
game is a particularly good
metaphor for the plot — at one
point Frost painfully an
nounces that he is moving out,
while Susan nonchalantly asks
him if he'd "rather play a dif
ferent game." At another
point, Frost frets over the de
cline in their passion; Sue re
torts that one "doesn't run out
of passion like you run out of
milk," all the while readying
herself for another move.
Such realistic, well-timed
dialogue was maintained
throughout the performance,
as was the contrast between in
dividual reactions to the state
of the friendship. Unfortunate
ly, Wayne adds an un
believable ending to an other
wise lovely script and per
formance — perhaps a lighter
touch would have helped. Lisa-
Marie Krause's direction still
deserves special praise — the

action was limited to the area
surrounding a table and two
chairs downstage left, but with
no awkwardness or confine
ment.
The most delightful aspects
of Becky Smith's The Lamb
Chop Murders were the tacky
little things — a squealing in
fant named Zaffo Gustav (soon
to be called "Goosie" by his
kindergarten classmates), a
mitten tree (true Midwestern
tacky) and crocheted liquor
bottle holders, to name a few.
These, and a few extremely
precious moments, added life
to a predictable "city comes to
country" plot revolving
around a Chrismastime visit be
tween two sisters with opposite
lifestyles.
While both Macall Dunahee
and Doree Allen gave extreme
ly natural, convincing per
formances, the production
itself was marred by the usual
opening night technical gaffes.
In addition, the play rambled
and dragged at times. How
ever, several well-placed and
well-delivered lines picked up
the slack, most notably Alexan
dra's comment about Lottie's
husband, a plumber busily in
stalling pipes in a brand new
three-toilet horpe: "He's one
in a thousand." Lydia Romero's
set added a fresh touch of reali

ty and completeness to the
scene.
From her opening warble of
the title song to her refusal to
play checkers on the grounds
of constipation, Kerry Atha as
Winnie stole the show in Jim
Morrison's The Atchison,
Topeka and the Santa Fe. Her
wonderful expressions, vocal
tone and ability to simulate
Parkinson's disease gave
credibility to the play's nurs
ing-home setting, as she and
her home-mates plowed
through a "day on the (funny)
farm".
Morrison did a commen
dable job of capturing ev
eryday life in such an environ
ment, displaying insight into
the importance of the mun
dane and the characters' need
to deny what they could not
understand. When George
(Eric Stuve) hits his pipe against
the side of the ashtray he
makes "enough damn noise to
scare a buzzard off a manure
cart" and one added ingre
dient to a brownie mix pro
vides a day's entertainment for
Winnie. Roy (Dennis Hirsch)
feels his son is "nuttier than a
fruitcake" for leading a sponta
neous, cause-oriented life,
while he sees his own ap
parently harmless disease as
threatening to "swaller him up

and spit him out." What one
finally sees is a well acted pan
orama of old age, from Roy's
paranoid but curable condi
tion, to Cindy's (Alicia
Moore's) autistic existence.
Director Rick Clyne brilliant
ly heightens the show's sense
of tragicomedy by incorporat
ing television cartoons into the
dramatic finale. As Roy's son
Kenny (Jim Kennedy) tries to
convince Roy to move with
him to the mountains, and

Winnie vainly tries to get Cindy
to sing "The Atchison, Topeka
and the Santa Fe", the familiar
voice of Fred Flintstone is
heard coaxing Barney Rubble
to go to a lodge meeting, Peb
bles is cooing to Wilma, and
Bam Bam is hitting Dino. All
aspects of the show are pro
fessionally integrated.

Acts continue this week, show

day at the Little Theatre.)
