## Poet Rich examines society 
### Kathy Christie 
Concentrating her readings on
selections from her latest work, A
Willi Patience Has Taken Me This Far,
nationally known poet Adrienne
Rich last night addressed the ever
changing role of women in society.
She spoke to an overflow crowd of
about 500 in Annenberg Auditorium.
Rich also emphasized a need to re
member the past and to come to
terms with it, suggesting that if there
was a subtitle for her book, it would
be "Against Amnesia."
Her first reading, a poem entitled
"Hunger," was, she said, written in
response to a story she read on the
front page of a newspaper concern
ing a famine in Africa. Rich said she
was struck by the fact that even after
the paper was gone, the famine still
existed. In her poem, she calls for all
of humanity, and in particular wom
en, to remember the suffering of
these people. "Until we find each
other, we are alone," she quoted.
Among the other poems that deal
with this need to remember the past
is "The Ethel Rosenberg." Con
cerned with the effects of the Mc-
Carthy era and the motivations that

prompted Rosenberg to die at the
electric chair (following conviction
of conspiracy to commit espionage),
Rich examines the woman's life in
parallel with her own, contemplating
what that and other situations would
be like in a more just society.
In another poem, "The Julia in Ne
braska", Rich condemns the male
dominated society that put up a his
torical marker in honor of Willa
Gather, a woman whose letters socie
ty had once burnt as shameful. Rich
defended the causes of feminism and
lesbianism which she said she shares
with Gather, and called for society to
abandon the hypocrisy with which it
treated Cather.
Rich lives in Massachusetts, where
she is co-edit or of the les
bian/feminist journal Sinister Wis
dom. A poet for thirty years, Rich has
received many honors, and was
named co-winner of the National
Book Award in 1974 for her collec
tion Diving Into the Wreck.
Rich was the third speaker in the
ASSU Winter Writer's Series. Ray
Bradbury, the fourth speaker in the
series, will be on campus tomorrow
night.
