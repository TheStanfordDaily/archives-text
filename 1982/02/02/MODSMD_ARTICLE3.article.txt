# Council approves $40,000 sewage conversion study

The Palo Alto City Council last
night unanimously approved a
$40,000 feasibility study for a poten
tially profitable scheme to generate
electricity from sewage.
Treated sewage at the Water Quali
ty Control Plant on Embarcadero
Road, near the Bay, is at present in
cinerated, and the remaining ashes
are sold for the precious metals they
contain.
The "cogeneration" scheme,
which may cost about $7 million to
complete, would not affect this
method of ash disposal. The heat giv
en off by the combusting sewage at
an earlier stage would be used to
generate electricity.
Frank Betley, principal engineer in
the city Department of Utilities, con
firmed that Palo Alto might agree to
sell electricity generated by the plant
to the federal government.
"It is one of many alternatives, and
one which looks very economically
attractive now," he said. "But we
have not definitely made that de
cision yet."
Betley said the amount of natural

gas used at present could be reduced
by 90 percent under the scheme, if
equipment is installed to make the
raw sewage more solid before it is
combusted.
The possibility of using methane
gas given off by the nearby city dump
as fuel to replace natural gas is also
being investigated. Up to 52 percent
of current operating costs may be
saved if the full scheme issuccessfully
implemented, according to a staff re
port to the council.
The fuel-saving elements of the
plan are especially attractive to its
supporters. "It wasn't worth it
before, because energy was so
cheap," said Betley.
Council member Betsy Bechtel, a
member of the committee on fi
nance and public works, which has
studied the plan, made it clear that it
is still in an early stage.
"We're hiring consultants to study
this whole issue. All the basic ideas
are being used elsewhere, but not
put together in this way," she said.
Council member Ellen Fletcher
was less cautious in her support: "I
think it's a wonderful idea," she said.
