# Two candidates issue challenge in Senate race
## Senate

Monterey — U.S. Senate can
didates Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) and Ted Bruinsma,
the former dean of Loyola Law
School, Saturday challenged the five
other announced candidates in the
Republican primary to a series of de
bates.

Since the proposal, Jack Hickey, a
research scientist from Redwood
City, also has announced his can
didacy for the nomination.
The duo announced their
challenge at the California Re
publican Convention in Monterey.
They made the proposal because,
McCloskey said, "Some of the can
didates have been noticeably absent
from the debates."
There have been five Republican
Senate race debates, sponsored by
various groups, throughout the state
since December. The debates have
been sporadically attended by some
of the Senate candidates.
McCloskey and Bruinsma pro
posed a series of head-to-head de
bates in as many of California's 58
counties as possible before the June 8
primary. The first scheduled forum is
set for Feb. 13 in San Diego, to be
sponsored by the local city club. No
other debates are yet scheduled.
"Our format is simple," a joint
statement read. "Brief opening and
closing statement of no more than
three minutes each, with a panel of
hard-headed newspersons to ask
questions, with our answers limited
to one minute each."
McCloskey and Bruinsma appear
to have joined forces in the crowded
Republican Senate race which in
cludes Hickey, Maureen Reagan,
Reps. Robert Dornan and Barry
Goldwater Jr. of Los Angeles, state
Sen. John Schmitz of Corona del Mar
and San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson.
Incumbent Sen. S.I. Hayakawa an
nounced Saturday to the convention
that he will not seek reelection.
"I'm delighted to give (Bruinsma)
an opportunity to debate," Mc-
Closkey said about the lesser-known
candidate. "Unfortunately, the only
candidates who receive attention are
those who seem to be the brightest
media package."
Bruinsma, 60, is considered a long
shot candidate for the seat. He re
cently filed a complaint with the Fed
eral Elections Commission in an at
tempt to stop Gov. Jerry Brown's host
appearances on radio talk shows. Al
though Brown has not officially an
nounced his candidacy, it is widely
believed that he will do so shortly.
Bruinsma's complaint is still pending.
McCloskey, who has represented
the 12th Congressional District for 14
years, is a graduate of the University
and the University Law School. A No
vember Field Poll ranks McCloskey
third in the Senate's June race, pre
ceded by Goldwater and Wilson.
Bruinsma told the Daily in Decem
ber that he and McCloskey were
planning to set up a debate forum so
that "the candidates will give able
and intelligent remarks on various is
sues."
The other Senate candidates ap
pearing at the convention were
critical of the challenge. "As I under
stand the proposal, there would be
48 debates," Wilson said. "The dean

(Bruinsma) and congressman (Mc-
Closkey) greatly overestimate the en
tertainment value of these debates.
"Perhaps we should offer wild
cards to these joint sessions and hold
something like the (football)
playoffs."
Dornan said that he would appear
at the debates, but preferred another
system over the one proposed by
McCloskey and Bruinsma.
Goldwater said he would wait until
after the March filing date before
committing himself to any debates.
"I will wait to see who the real can
didates are before debating," he
said.

nounced his candidacy, it is widely
believed that he will do so shortly.
Bruinsma's complaint is still pending.
McCloskey, who has represented
the 12th Congressional District for 14
years, is a graduate of the University
and the University Law School. A No
vember Field Poll ranks McCloskey
third in the Senate's June race, pre
ceded by Goldwater and Wilson.
Bruinsma told the Daily in Decem
ber that he and McCloskey were
planning to set up a debate forum so
that "the candidates will give able
and intelligent remarks on various is
sues."
The other Senate candidates ap
pearing at the convention were
critical of the challenge. "As I under
stand the proposal, there would be
48 debates," Wilson said. "The dean

(Bruinsma) and congressman (Mc-
Closkey) greatly overestimate the en
tertainment value of these debates.
"Perhaps we should offer wild
cards to these joint sessions and hold
something like the (football)
playoffs."
Dornan said that he would appear
at the debates, but preferred another
system over the one proposed by
McCloskey and Bruinsma.
Goldwater said he would wait until
after the March filing date before
committing himself to any debates.
"I will wait to see who the real can
didates are before debating," he
said.
