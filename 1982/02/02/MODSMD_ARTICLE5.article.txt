# Maybe' complex purposes' cancelled Umnov visit
## Kennedy questions restrictions 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
University President Donald Kennedy said he has "no
idea" whether the State Department's alleged cancella
tion of the planned visit here of a Soviet arms control ex
pert was in retaliation for the University's previous re
fusal to impose restrictions on the research of a Soviet ro
botics expert.
"I generally find it better not to speculate on things of
that sort," said Kennedy last night on a pre-recorded
presentation of KZSU's Campus Conference. "I think it's
unfortunate that his visit was cancelled, but I have no
idea of the reasons behind it."
Yuri Kaprolov, consultant to the Soviet embassy in
Washington, was scheduled to speak here last week on
bilateral arms control and disarmament. Kaprolov can
celled his visit to the Bay Area, claiming the State Depart
ment informed him that he could travel to San Francisco
but not to Stanford.
Kennedy said there were "a lot of complex purposes"
that might have prompted the cancellation that had no
relation to Stanford's earlier refusal to follow State De
partment restrictions on the research of Soviet robotics
expert Nikolay Umnov. Whether Umnov will eventually
visit here is unclear, although the University has said it
will not change its stand on the restrictions.
Kennedy said the University was concerned about the
implications of the State Department's restrictions. "We
think that it is wrong, both from a national science policy
perspective and from the narrower perspective of this
institution, for the State Department to attempt to ask us
to apply the kinds of controls that we were asked to app
ly," he said.
The restrictions impeded the flow of technology, ac
cording to Kennedy, and were ultimately harmful to sci
entific research in the United States.

"If you look around at the areas in which the United
States has distinctive world technological leadership,
you don't find that in the areas in which we restrict the
flow of information," he said. "On the contrary, they're
the very areas in which it's quite impossible to interfere
with the flow of information."
Kennedy said if government officials were genuinely
concerned with prohibiting access to particular military
technology, they should put a security classification on
the information rather than attempt to throw a "blanket
of regulation" on the universities.
Kennedy said that if University personnel had taken
the State Department instructions literally, they would
have had to "follow that guy into bars and into his motel
room to make sure he wasn't having inappropriate con
tacts."
During the half-hour interview, Kennedy also dis
cussed the reaction of parents and alumni to the recent
campus rapes. He said although the University has re
ceived "some concerned letters," most people seem to
believe that it is doing the best it could in a difficult situ
ation.
"Most people who know what we've done about the
rape problem and who understand the nature of that
problem — that is the diversity of the places and the
times of day and circumstances under which the attacks
have taken place — understand that it's a very difficult
problem that cannot be made to go away simply by
throwing resources at it,"he said.
Kennedy also commented on his recent testimony in
opposition to the Small Business Innovation Develop
ment Act before the U.S. House Ways and Means Com
mittee. He derided the contention by supporters of the
bill that its impact on university research revenue will be
minimal.
"It's true one broken leg isn't as
bad as two broken legs, a misde
meanor isn't as bad as a felony," he
said. "It still is a reallocation of mon
ey outside the normal appropriations
process, it's still in our view bad gov
ernment, and it will hurt us to the
tune of about a million and a half
dollars a year."
Kennedy defended recently an
nounced plans for tuition increases
by saying the University was just "re
sponding to the costs we're ex
periencing in an inflationary econo
my." Kennedy stressed that increases

in financial aid are keeping pace with
the tuition hikes.
Kennedy also commented on a
proposal in a recent Daily column
that University residences hang ban
ners in support of nuclear weapons
disarmament.
Although Kennedy said he needed
to examine the proposal more close
ly to determine its possible defects,
he said he considered it worthwhile
"if it causes some good conversations
to take place and causes people to
examine their own feelings about the
threat of nuclear war." He said he
thought charges were exaggerated
that the current generation of stu
dents is apathetic about such social
issues.

"If you look around at the areas in which the United
States has distinctive world technological leadership,
you don't find that in the areas in which we restrict the
flow of information," he said. "On the contrary, they're
the very areas in which it's quite impossible to interfere
with the flow of information."
Kennedy said if government officials were genuinely
concerned with prohibiting access to particular military
technology, they should put a security classification on
the information rather than attempt to throw a "blanket
of regulation" on the universities.
Kennedy said that if University personnel had taken
the State Department instructions literally, they would
have had to "follow that guy into bars and into his motel
room to make sure he wasn't having inappropriate con
tacts."
During the half-hour interview, Kennedy also dis
cussed the reaction of parents and alumni to the recent
campus rapes. He said although the University has re
ceived "some concerned letters," most people seem to
believe that it is doing the best it could in a difficult situ
ation.
"Most people who know what we've done about the
rape problem and who understand the nature of that
problem — that is the diversity of the places and the
times of day and circumstances under which the attacks
have taken place — understand that it's a very difficult
problem that cannot be made to go away simply by
throwing resources at it,"he said.
Kennedy also commented on his recent testimony in
opposition to the Small Business Innovation Develop
ment Act before the U.S. House Ways and Means Com
mittee. He derided the contention by supporters of the
bill that its impact on university research revenue will be
minimal.
"It's true one broken leg isn't as
bad as two broken legs, a misde
meanor isn't as bad as a felony," he
said. "It still is a reallocation of mon
ey outside the normal appropriations
process, it's still in our view bad gov
ernment, and it will hurt us to the
tune of about a million and a half
dollars a year."
Kennedy defended recently an
nounced plans for tuition increases
by saying the University was just "re
sponding to the costs we're ex
periencing in an inflationary econo
my." Kennedy stressed that increases

in financial aid are keeping pace with
the tuition hikes.
Kennedy also commented on a
proposal in a recent Daily column
that University residences hang ban
ners in support of nuclear weapons
disarmament.
Although Kennedy said he needed
to examine the proposal more close
ly to determine its possible defects,
he said he considered it worthwhile
"if it causes some good conversations
to take place and causes people to
examine their own feelings about the
threat of nuclear war." He said he
thought charges were exaggerated
that the current generation of stu
dents is apathetic about such social
issues.
University President Donald Kennedy said he has "no
idea" whether the State Department's alleged cancella
tion of the planned visit here of a Soviet arms control ex
pert was in retaliation for the University's previous re
fusal to impose restrictions on the research of a Soviet ro
botics expert.
"I generally find it better not to speculate on things of
that sort," said Kennedy last night on a pre-recorded
presentation of KZSU's Campus Conference. "I think it's
unfortunate that his visit was cancelled, but I have no
idea of the reasons behind it."
Yuri Kaprolov, consultant to the Soviet embassy in
Washington, was scheduled to speak here last week on
bilateral arms control and disarmament. Kaprolov can
celled his visit to the Bay Area, claiming the State Depart
ment informed him that he could travel to San Francisco
but not to Stanford.
Kennedy said there were "a lot of complex purposes"
that might have prompted the cancellation that had no
relation to Stanford's earlier refusal to follow State De
partment restrictions on the research of Soviet robotics
expert Nikolay Umnov. Whether Umnov will eventually
visit here is unclear, although the University has said it
will not change its stand on the restrictions.
Kennedy said the University was concerned about the
implications of the State Department's restrictions. "We
think that it is wrong, both from a national science policy
perspective and from the narrower perspective of this
institution, for the State Department to attempt to ask us
to apply the kinds of controls that we were asked to app
ly," he said.
The restrictions impeded the flow of technology, ac
cording to Kennedy, and were ultimately harmful to sci
entific research in the United States.

"If you look around at the areas in which the United
States has distinctive world technological leadership,
you don't find that in the areas in which we restrict the
flow of information," he said. "On the contrary, they're
the very areas in which it's quite impossible to interfere
