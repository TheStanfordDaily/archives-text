# 'Rape is no accident' say campus assault victims
## 
### 
Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.

Alice—My mind was very much intact; I was being
very logical. I would think of something I could do to
hurt him, then I would think, 'I won't be able to
outrun him because I'm tired.' I was so logical it didn't
get me anywhere, because every time I thought I could
do something I would think, 'But then if he does this,
you're in worse trouble than you are now.'
Beth—l went to a self-defense class about two
months ago. I had a lot of trouble because they have
people grab you from behind and I just couldn't deal
with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the
next morning when I realized I was so far from home
and I had three months before I could go back to my
parents.
Alice—l was in shock for a pretty long time. I
could talk about the fact that I was a rape victim, but
the emotions didn't start surfacing until a month later.
During the first two weeks there were people I had
chosen to tell who were very, very supportive. But,

.. it's important to have
someone to cry with. I don't
know exactly what the emotion
is when I cry, whether it's anger
or guilt or what. But a lot of the
times I want to cry with
someone/

after two weeks, it was like, 'Okay, she's over it, we
-can goon now." But the farther along you get the more
support you need, because as time passes you become
aware of your emotions and the need to deal with
them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.
I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

'One night I had a guy walk me
across the dormitory courtyard
because I couldn't walk across
by myself. That was really
ridiculous. Vet it was a real fear.
It was irrational, but fear is
irrational/

They know exactly what I'm feeling because 111 go
and tell them, but they're just listeners, and I need to
have some feedback.
Denial
Alice—There is a point where you deny it hap
pened. You just completely bury it.
Beth—You think you can go on living your life like
nothing happened. Then everything erupts. You don't
want to believe it happened.
I still can't imagine it ever happening to anyone
again. It's so unreal that you don't want to believe that
it actually happened or that it can happen. Then you
go through a long period of fear and anger.
Fear
Beth—l wouldn't shower for a long time at night
because I was afraid someone would turn off the light.
Alice—l'd have someone wait outside the shower
for me.
Beth—A couple of times I waited outside for Alice,
then she'd get out and wait for me.
Alice—l'm amazed at people. I once went into the
bathroom and said to a woman who didn't know I had
been raped, 'I'm really scared to take a shower. Will
you please just sit outside the door? 11l only be 5
minutes.' She asked if I was okay and I said, 'Yes, but I
just don't feel comfortable taking a shower right now.'
She said, t)kay, 111 sit outside and read.'
Beth—One night I had a guy walk me across the
dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely
stopped any kind of physical activity after I was raped.
1 started it again this quarter. But every time I go
jogging I have a perpetual fear. My pulse doubles. Of
course I don't go jogging alone anymore, but still the
fear is there constantly. I check bathroom stalls now

before I go in. This fear is sometimes very irrational.
Whatever sense of security you had is gone and you
realize that you really aren't as secure as you thought
you were.
I find myself walking in the middle of the street
now. I refuse to walk on the sidewalk unless I'm with

'Whatever ground you had
stood on, whatever morals or
beliefs you held, whatever self
confidence and self-worth you
had before was just wiped out
completely.'

someone. As a courtesy, guys want to walk on the side
next to the street. That makes me feel very closed in, I
think he could push me into the bushes. I prefer to
walk next to the street so I could run out into it. I was
walking with a man who is a friend, and I found
myself keeping him in front of me. I didn't want him in
back of me. I didn't want him next to me. 1 carry my
backpack a different way, so I'm always ready to
swing it at someone. Walking to my room. 11l carry

my key ring in my hand with the keys sticking out
between my fingers (for use in scratching an at
tacker?).
Beth—l've experienced some really irrational
thoughts. I was home at Christmas riding in the car
with my Dad—my Dad!—and the guy who attacked
me was about 21 years old—and yet I got really afraid
all of a sudden of my Dad. It's just something you
have to work out. There's not anything anybody can
do.
Alice—A lot of girls ask me, 'What do I do?' when 1
tell them I was a rape victim. My advice is you can be
cautious, but don't let fear run your life.
Eventually I hope I can jog by myself again
because it's inconvenient to have to go find a jogging
partner. This is my life and I have every right to go out
and jog when I want. I don't think 10:30 a.m. is an
unreasonable time. Right now I can't do that—l'm not
ready for that.
Betrayal and loneliness
Alice—There's also a feeling of having all your
friends betray you. 1 had a dream in which I was being
assaulted outside my dorm. In the dream, everyone
was looking out their windows—the faces were so


Carol Bennett/Daily
clear —every one of my friends lined up against the
windows watching. And there were even people two
feet away from me. They all saw what was happening
and none of them did anything. I woke up and had a
feeling of extreme loneliness. Sometimes you just feel
like there's nobody around.
Beth—l still feel very lonely. I didn't have any
close friends when I got here. I felt betrayed by my
family and friends from high school because they
weren't here.
I thought the whole Stanford campus was evil. I
met my roommate in the morning and went to
orientation, then this happened in the evening. I
became afraid of the campus in general. Finally I
realized that life here was actually normal and it
wasn't the norm to be raped every night.
I'm just beginning to gain control over my life
again. One of the biggest problems was that I never
had any control once it happened. Since I didn't have a
routine before and I didn't know what to expect from
school, it was really difficult to handle day today life.
Rejection
Alice —A lot of times people joke with you saying,
Xjo away.' You become extremely sensitive and feel
that it's automatic rejection. They don't want me
around!' HI take it to heart—and I know it's a joke but
it still will affect me five times as much as it would
have prior to November
I'm not asking friends to be careful what they
say—they should act normally—but they should be
aware that if victims act or seem more sensitive,
there's a reason for it. They're not just being moody or
fickle. They're trying to cope and regain control of
their lives.
Lack of self-confidence
Alice—The worst thing for me to go through was
not having any self-confidence at all. Whatever
ground you had stood on, whatever morals or beliefs
you held, whatever self-confidence and self worth you
had before was just wiped out completely.
Beth—lt's like having the rug pulled out from
under you.
Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely
stopped any kind of physical activity after I was raped.
1 started it again this quarter. But every time I go
jogging I have a perpetual fear. My pulse doubles. Of
course I don't go jogging alone anymore, but still the
fear is there constantly. I check bathroom stalls now

before I go in. This fear is sometimes very irrational.
Whatever sense of security you had is gone and you
realize that you really aren't as secure as you thought
you were.
I find myself walking in the middle of the street
now. I refuse to walk on the sidewalk unless I'm with

'Whatever ground you had
stood on, whatever morals or
beliefs you held, whatever self
confidence and self-worth you
had before was just wiped out
completely.'

someone. As a courtesy, guys want to walk on the side
next to the street. That makes me feel very closed in, I
think he could push me into the bushes. I prefer to
walk next to the street so I could run out into it. I was
walking with a man who is a friend, and I found
myself keeping him in front of me. I didn't want him in
back of me. I didn't want him next to me. 1 carry my
backpack a different way, so I'm always ready to
swing it at someone. Walking to my room. 11l carry

my key ring in my hand with the keys sticking out
between my fingers (for use in scratching an at
tacker?).
Beth—l've experienced some really irrational
thoughts. I was home at Christmas riding in the car
with my Dad—my Dad!—and the guy who attacked
me was about 21 years old—and yet I got really afraid
all of a sudden of my Dad. It's just something you
have to work out. There's not anything anybody can
do.
Alice—A lot of girls ask me, 'What do I do?' when 1
tell them I was a rape victim. My advice is you can be
cautious, but don't let fear run your life.
Eventually I hope I can jog by myself again
because it's inconvenient to have to go find a jogging
partner. This is my life and I have every right to go out
and jog when I want. I don't think 10:30 a.m. is an
unreasonable time. Right now I can't do that—l'm not
ready for that.
Betrayal and loneliness
Alice—There's also a feeling of having all your
friends betray you. 1 had a dream in which I was being
assaulted outside my dorm. In the dream, everyone
was looking out their windows—the faces were so


Carol Bennett/Daily
clear —every one of my friends lined up against the
windows watching. And there were even people two
feet away from me. They all saw what was happening
and none of them did anything. I woke up and had a
feeling of extreme loneliness. Sometimes you just feel
like there's nobody around.
Beth—l still feel very lonely. I didn't have any
close friends when I got here. I felt betrayed by my
family and friends from high school because they
weren't here.
I thought the whole Stanford campus was evil. I
met my roommate in the morning and went to
orientation, then this happened in the evening. I
became afraid of the campus in general. Finally I
realized that life here was actually normal and it
wasn't the norm to be raped every night.
I'm just beginning to gain control over my life
again. One of the biggest problems was that I never
had any control once it happened. Since I didn't have a
routine before and I didn't know what to expect from
school, it was really difficult to handle day today life.
Rejection
Alice —A lot of times people joke with you saying,
Xjo away.' You become extremely sensitive and feel
that it's automatic rejection. They don't want me
around!' HI take it to heart—and I know it's a joke but
it still will affect me five times as much as it would
have prior to November
I'm not asking friends to be careful what they
say—they should act normally—but they should be
aware that if victims act or seem more sensitive,
there's a reason for it. They're not just being moody or
fickle. They're trying to cope and regain control of
their lives.
Lack of self-confidence
Alice—The worst thing for me to go through was
not having any self-confidence at all. Whatever
ground you had stood on, whatever morals or beliefs
you held, whatever self-confidence and self worth you
had before was just wiped out completely.
Beth—lt's like having the rug pulled out from
under you.
Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.

Alice—My mind was very much intact; I was being
very logical. I would think of something I could do to
hurt him, then I would think, 'I won't be able to
outrun him because I'm tired.' I was so logical it didn't
get me anywhere, because every time I thought I could
do something I would think, 'But then if he does this,
you're in worse trouble than you are now.'
Beth—l went to a self-defense class about two
months ago. I had a lot of trouble because they have
people grab you from behind and I just couldn't deal
with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the
next morning when I realized I was so far from home
and I had three months before I could go back to my
parents.
Alice—l was in shock for a pretty long time. I
could talk about the fact that I was a rape victim, but
the emotions didn't start surfacing until a month later.
During the first two weeks there were people I had
chosen to tell who were very, very supportive. But,

.. it's important to have
someone to cry with. I don't
know exactly what the emotion
is when I cry, whether it's anger
or guilt or what. But a lot of the
times I want to cry with
someone/

after two weeks, it was like, 'Okay, she's over it, we
-can goon now." But the farther along you get the more
support you need, because as time passes you become
aware of your emotions and the need to deal with
them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.
I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

'One night I had a guy walk me
across the dormitory courtyard
because I couldn't walk across
by myself. That was really
ridiculous. Vet it was a real fear.
It was irrational, but fear is
irrational/

They know exactly what I'm feeling because 111 go
and tell them, but they're just listeners, and I need to
have some feedback.
Denial
Alice—There is a point where you deny it hap
pened. You just completely bury it.
Beth—You think you can go on living your life like
nothing happened. Then everything erupts. You don't
want to believe it happened.
I still can't imagine it ever happening to anyone
again. It's so unreal that you don't want to believe that
it actually happened or that it can happen. Then you
go through a long period of fear and anger.
Fear
Beth—l wouldn't shower for a long time at night
because I was afraid someone would turn off the light.
Alice—l'd have someone wait outside the shower
for me.
Beth—A couple of times I waited outside for Alice,
then she'd get out and wait for me.
Alice—l'm amazed at people. I once went into the
bathroom and said to a woman who didn't know I had
been raped, 'I'm really scared to take a shower. Will
you please just sit outside the door? 11l only be 5
minutes.' She asked if I was okay and I said, 'Yes, but I
just don't feel comfortable taking a shower right now.'
She said, t)kay, 111 sit outside and read.'
Beth—One night I had a guy walk me across the
dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely

Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to

Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.

Alice—My mind was very much intact; I was being
very logical. I would think of something I could do to
hurt him, then I would think, 'I won't be able to
outrun him because I'm tired.' I was so logical it didn't
get me anywhere, because every time I thought I could
do something I would think, 'But then if he does this,
you're in worse trouble than you are now.'
Beth—l went to a self-defense class about two
months ago. I had a lot of trouble because they have
people grab you from behind and I just couldn't deal
with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the
next morning when I realized I was so far from home
and I had three months before I could go back to my
parents.
Alice—l was in shock for a pretty long time. I
could talk about the fact that I was a rape victim, but
the emotions didn't start surfacing until a month later.
During the first two weeks there were people I had
chosen to tell who were very, very supportive. But,

.. it's important to have
someone to cry with. I don't
know exactly what the emotion
is when I cry, whether it's anger
or guilt or what. But a lot of the
times I want to cry with
someone/

after two weeks, it was like, 'Okay, she's over it, we
-can goon now." But the farther along you get the more
support you need, because as time passes you become
aware of your emotions and the need to deal with
them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.
I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

'One night I had a guy walk me
across the dormitory courtyard
because I couldn't walk across
by myself. That was really
ridiculous. Vet it was a real fear.
It was irrational, but fear is
irrational/

They know exactly what I'm feeling because 111 go
and tell them, but they're just listeners, and I need to
have some feedback.
Denial
Alice—There is a point where you deny it hap
pened. You just completely bury it.
Beth—You think you can go on living your life like
nothing happened. Then everything erupts. You don't
want to believe it happened.
I still can't imagine it ever happening to anyone
again. It's so unreal that you don't want to believe that
it actually happened or that it can happen. Then you
go through a long period of fear and anger.
Fear
Beth—l wouldn't shower for a long time at night
because I was afraid someone would turn off the light.
Alice—l'd have someone wait outside the shower
for me.
Beth—A couple of times I waited outside for Alice,
then she'd get out and wait for me.
Alice—l'm amazed at people. I once went into the
bathroom and said to a woman who didn't know I had
been raped, 'I'm really scared to take a shower. Will
you please just sit outside the door? 11l only be 5
minutes.' She asked if I was okay and I said, 'Yes, but I
just don't feel comfortable taking a shower right now.'
She said, t)kay, 111 sit outside and read.'
Beth—One night I had a guy walk me across the
dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely
stopped any kind of physical activity after I was raped.
1 started it again this quarter. But every time I go
jogging I have a perpetual fear. My pulse doubles. Of
course I don't go jogging alone anymore, but still the
fear is there constantly. I check bathroom stalls now

before I go in. This fear is sometimes very irrational.
Whatever sense of security you had is gone and you
realize that you really aren't as secure as you thought
you were.
I find myself walking in the middle of the street
now. I refuse to walk on the sidewalk unless I'm with

'Whatever ground you had
stood on, whatever morals or
beliefs you held, whatever self
confidence and self-worth you
had before was just wiped out
completely.'

someone. As a courtesy, guys want to walk on the side
next to the street. That makes me feel very closed in, I
think he could push me into the bushes. I prefer to
walk next to the street so I could run out into it. I was
walking with a man who is a friend, and I found
myself keeping him in front of me. I didn't want him in
back of me. I didn't want him next to me. 1 carry my
backpack a different way, so I'm always ready to
swing it at someone. Walking to my room. 11l carry

my key ring in my hand with the keys sticking out
between my fingers (for use in scratching an at
tacker?).
Beth—l've experienced some really irrational
thoughts. I was home at Christmas riding in the car
with my Dad—my Dad!—and the guy who attacked
me was about 21 years old—and yet I got really afraid
all of a sudden of my Dad. It's just something you
have to work out. There's not anything anybody can
do.
Alice—A lot of girls ask me, 'What do I do?' when 1
tell them I was a rape victim. My advice is you can be
cautious, but don't let fear run your life.
Eventually I hope I can jog by myself again
because it's inconvenient to have to go find a jogging
partner. This is my life and I have every right to go out
and jog when I want. I don't think 10:30 a.m. is an
unreasonable time. Right now I can't do that—l'm not
ready for that.
Betrayal and loneliness
Alice—There's also a feeling of having all your
friends betray you. 1 had a dream in which I was being
assaulted outside my dorm. In the dream, everyone
was looking out their windows—the faces were so


Carol Bennett/Daily
clear —every one of my friends lined up against the
windows watching. And there were even people two
feet away from me. They all saw what was happening
and none of them did anything. I woke up and had a
feeling of extreme loneliness. Sometimes you just feel
like there's nobody around.
Beth—l still feel very lonely. I didn't have any
close friends when I got here. I felt betrayed by my
family and friends from high school because they
weren't here.
I thought the whole Stanford campus was evil. I
met my roommate in the morning and went to
orientation, then this happened in the evening. I
became afraid of the campus in general. Finally I
realized that life here was actually normal and it
wasn't the norm to be raped every night.
I'm just beginning to gain control over my life
again. One of the biggest problems was that I never
had any control once it happened. Since I didn't have a
routine before and I didn't know what to expect from
school, it was really difficult to handle day today life.
Rejection
Alice —A lot of times people joke with you saying,
Xjo away.' You become extremely sensitive and feel
that it's automatic rejection. They don't want me
around!' HI take it to heart—and I know it's a joke but
it still will affect me five times as much as it would
have prior to November
I'm not asking friends to be careful what they
say—they should act normally—but they should be
aware that if victims act or seem more sensitive,
there's a reason for it. They're not just being moody or
fickle. They're trying to cope and regain control of
their lives.
Lack of self-confidence
Alice—The worst thing for me to go through was
not having any self-confidence at all. Whatever
ground you had stood on, whatever morals or beliefs
you held, whatever self-confidence and self worth you
had before was just wiped out completely.
Beth—lt's like having the rug pulled out from
under you.
Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out

are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....

he wouldn't.

victims. I told them afterwards.

But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

'One night I had a guy walk me
across the dormitory courtyard
because I couldn't walk across
by myself. That was really
ridiculous. Vet it was a real fear.
It was irrational, but fear is
irrational/

They know exactly what I'm feeling because 111 go
and tell them, but they're just listeners, and I need to
have some feedback.
Denial
Alice—There is a point where you deny it hap
pened. You just completely bury it.
Beth—You think you can go on living your life like
nothing happened. Then everything erupts. You don't
want to believe it happened.
I still can't imagine it ever happening to anyone
again. It's so unreal that you don't want to believe that
it actually happened or that it can happen. Then you
go through a long period of fear and anger.
Fear
Beth—l wouldn't shower for a long time at night
because I was afraid someone would turn off the light.
Alice—l'd have someone wait outside the shower
for me.
Beth—A couple of times I waited outside for Alice,
then she'd get out and wait for me.
Alice—l'm amazed at people. I once went into the
bathroom and said to a woman who didn't know I had
been raped, 'I'm really scared to take a shower. Will
you please just sit outside the door? 11l only be 5
minutes.' She asked if I was okay and I said, 'Yes, but I
just don't feel comfortable taking a shower right now.'
She said, t)kay, 111 sit outside and read.'
Beth—One night I had a guy walk me across the
dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely
stopped any kind of physical activity after I was raped.
1 started it again this quarter. But every time I go
jogging I have a perpetual fear. My pulse doubles. Of
course I don't go jogging alone anymore, but still the
fear is there constantly. I check bathroom stalls now

before I go in. This fear is sometimes very irrational.
Whatever sense of security you had is gone and you
realize that you really aren't as secure as you thought
you were.
I find myself walking in the middle of the street
now. I refuse to walk on the sidewalk unless I'm with

'Whatever ground you had
stood on, whatever morals or
beliefs you held, whatever self
confidence and self-worth you
had before was just wiped out
completely.'

someone. As a courtesy, guys want to walk on the side
next to the street. That makes me feel very closed in, I
think he could push me into the bushes. I prefer to
walk next to the street so I could run out into it. I was
walking with a man who is a friend, and I found
myself keeping him in front of me. I didn't want him in
back of me. I didn't want him next to me. 1 carry my
backpack a different way, so I'm always ready to
swing it at someone. Walking to my room. 11l carry

my key ring in my hand with the keys sticking out
between my fingers (for use in scratching an at
tacker?).
Beth—l've experienced some really irrational
thoughts. I was home at Christmas riding in the car
with my Dad—my Dad!—and the guy who attacked
me was about 21 years old—and yet I got really afraid
all of a sudden of my Dad. It's just something you
have to work out. There's not anything anybody can
do.
Alice—A lot of girls ask me, 'What do I do?' when 1
tell them I was a rape victim. My advice is you can be
cautious, but don't let fear run your life.
Eventually I hope I can jog by myself again
because it's inconvenient to have to go find a jogging
partner. This is my life and I have every right to go out
and jog when I want. I don't think 10:30 a.m. is an
unreasonable time. Right now I can't do that—l'm not
ready for that.
Betrayal and loneliness
Alice—There's also a feeling of having all your
friends betray you. 1 had a dream in which I was being
assaulted outside my dorm. In the dream, everyone
was looking out their windows—the faces were so


Carol Bennett/Daily
clear —every one of my friends lined up against the
windows watching. And there were even people two
feet away from me. They all saw what was happening
and none of them did anything. I woke up and had a
feeling of extreme loneliness. Sometimes you just feel
like there's nobody around.
Beth—l still feel very lonely. I didn't have any
close friends when I got here. I felt betrayed by my
family and friends from high school because they
weren't here.
I thought the whole Stanford campus was evil. I
met my roommate in the morning and went to
orientation, then this happened in the evening. I
became afraid of the campus in general. Finally I
realized that life here was actually normal and it
wasn't the norm to be raped every night.
I'm just beginning to gain control over my life
again. One of the biggest problems was that I never
had any control once it happened. Since I didn't have a
routine before and I didn't know what to expect from
school, it was really difficult to handle day today life.
Rejection
Alice —A lot of times people joke with you saying,
Xjo away.' You become extremely sensitive and feel
that it's automatic rejection. They don't want me
around!' HI take it to heart—and I know it's a joke but
it still will affect me five times as much as it would
have prior to November
I'm not asking friends to be careful what they
say—they should act normally—but they should be
aware that if victims act or seem more sensitive,
there's a reason for it. They're not just being moody or
fickle. They're trying to cope and regain control of
their lives.
Lack of self-confidence
Alice—The worst thing for me to go through was
not having any self-confidence at all. Whatever
ground you had stood on, whatever morals or beliefs
you held, whatever self-confidence and self worth you
had before was just wiped out completely.
Beth—lt's like having the rug pulled out from
under you.
Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.

Alice—My mind was very much intact; I was being
very logical. I would think of something I could do to
hurt him, then I would think, 'I won't be able to
outrun him because I'm tired.' I was so logical it didn't
get me anywhere, because every time I thought I could
do something I would think, 'But then if he does this,
you're in worse trouble than you are now.'
Beth—l went to a self-defense class about two
months ago. I had a lot of trouble because they have
people grab you from behind and I just couldn't deal
with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the
next morning when I realized I was so far from home
and I had three months before I could go back to my
parents.
Alice—l was in shock for a pretty long time. I
could talk about the fact that I was a rape victim, but
the emotions didn't start surfacing until a month later.
During the first two weeks there were people I had
chosen to tell who were very, very supportive. But,

.. it's important to have
someone to cry with. I don't
know exactly what the emotion
is when I cry, whether it's anger
or guilt or what. But a lot of the
times I want to cry with
someone/

after two weeks, it was like, 'Okay, she's over it, we
-can goon now." But the farther along you get the more
support you need, because as time passes you become
aware of your emotions and the need to deal with
them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.
I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.

Alice—My mind was very much intact; I was being
very logical. I would think of something I could do to
hurt him, then I would think, 'I won't be able to
outrun him because I'm tired.' I was so logical it didn't
get me anywhere, because every time I thought I could
do something I would think, 'But then if he does this,
you're in worse trouble than you are now.'
Beth—l went to a self-defense class about two
months ago. I had a lot of trouble because they have
people grab you from behind and I just couldn't deal
with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the
next morning when I realized I was so far from home
and I had three months before I could go back to my
parents.
Alice—l was in shock for a pretty long time. I
could talk about the fact that I was a rape victim, but
the emotions didn't start surfacing until a month later.
During the first two weeks there were people I had
chosen to tell who were very, very supportive. But,

.. it's important to have
someone to cry with. I don't
know exactly what the emotion
is when I cry, whether it's anger
or guilt or what. But a lot of the
times I want to cry with
someone/

after two weeks, it was like, 'Okay, she's over it, we
-can goon now." But the farther along you get the more
support you need, because as time passes you become
aware of your emotions and the need to deal with
them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.
I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

'One night I had a guy walk me
across the dormitory courtyard
because I couldn't walk across
by myself. That was really
ridiculous. Vet it was a real fear.
It was irrational, but fear is
irrational/

They know exactly what I'm feeling because 111 go
and tell them, but they're just listeners, and I need to
have some feedback.
Denial
Alice—There is a point where you deny it hap
pened. You just completely bury it.
Beth—You think you can go on living your life like
nothing happened. Then everything erupts. You don't
want to believe it happened.
I still can't imagine it ever happening to anyone
again. It's so unreal that you don't want to believe that
it actually happened or that it can happen. Then you
go through a long period of fear and anger.
Fear
Beth—l wouldn't shower for a long time at night
because I was afraid someone would turn off the light.
Alice—l'd have someone wait outside the shower
for me.
Beth—A couple of times I waited outside for Alice,
then she'd get out and wait for me.
Alice—l'm amazed at people. I once went into the
bathroom and said to a woman who didn't know I had
been raped, 'I'm really scared to take a shower. Will
you please just sit outside the door? 11l only be 5
minutes.' She asked if I was okay and I said, 'Yes, but I
just don't feel comfortable taking a shower right now.'
She said, t)kay, 111 sit outside and read.'
Beth—One night I had a guy walk me across the
dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely
stopped any kind of physical activity after I was raped.
1 started it again this quarter. But every time I go
jogging I have a perpetual fear. My pulse doubles. Of
course I don't go jogging alone anymore, but still the
fear is there constantly. I check bathroom stalls now

before I go in. This fear is sometimes very irrational.
Whatever sense of security you had is gone and you
realize that you really aren't as secure as you thought
you were.
I find myself walking in the middle of the street
now. I refuse to walk on the sidewalk unless I'm with

'Whatever ground you had
stood on, whatever morals or
beliefs you held, whatever self
confidence and self-worth you
had before was just wiped out
completely.'

someone. As a courtesy, guys want to walk on the side
next to the street. That makes me feel very closed in, I
think he could push me into the bushes. I prefer to
walk next to the street so I could run out into it. I was
walking with a man who is a friend, and I found
myself keeping him in front of me. I didn't want him in
back of me. I didn't want him next to me. 1 carry my
backpack a different way, so I'm always ready to
swing it at someone. Walking to my room. 11l carry

my key ring in my hand with the keys sticking out
between my fingers (for use in scratching an at
tacker?).
Beth—l've experienced some really irrational
thoughts. I was home at Christmas riding in the car
with my Dad—my Dad!—and the guy who attacked
me was about 21 years old—and yet I got really afraid
all of a sudden of my Dad. It's just something you
have to work out. There's not anything anybody can
do.
Alice—A lot of girls ask me, 'What do I do?' when 1
tell them I was a rape victim. My advice is you can be
cautious, but don't let fear run your life.
Eventually I hope I can jog by myself again
because it's inconvenient to have to go find a jogging
partner. This is my life and I have every right to go out
and jog when I want. I don't think 10:30 a.m. is an
unreasonable time. Right now I can't do that—l'm not
ready for that.
Betrayal and loneliness
Alice—There's also a feeling of having all your
friends betray you. 1 had a dream in which I was being
assaulted outside my dorm. In the dream, everyone
was looking out their windows—the faces were so


Carol Bennett/Daily
clear —every one of my friends lined up against the
windows watching. And there were even people two
feet away from me. They all saw what was happening
and none of them did anything. I woke up and had a
feeling of extreme loneliness. Sometimes you just feel
like there's nobody around.
Beth—l still feel very lonely. I didn't have any
close friends when I got here. I felt betrayed by my
family and friends from high school because they
weren't here.
I thought the whole Stanford campus was evil. I
met my roommate in the morning and went to
orientation, then this happened in the evening. I
became afraid of the campus in general. Finally I
realized that life here was actually normal and it
wasn't the norm to be raped every night.
I'm just beginning to gain control over my life
again. One of the biggest problems was that I never
had any control once it happened. Since I didn't have a
routine before and I didn't know what to expect from
school, it was really difficult to handle day today life.
Rejection
Alice —A lot of times people joke with you saying,
Xjo away.' You become extremely sensitive and feel
that it's automatic rejection. They don't want me
around!' HI take it to heart—and I know it's a joke but
it still will affect me five times as much as it would
have prior to November
I'm not asking friends to be careful what they
say—they should act normally—but they should be
aware that if victims act or seem more sensitive,
there's a reason for it. They're not just being moody or
fickle. They're trying to cope and regain control of
their lives.
Lack of self-confidence
Alice—The worst thing for me to go through was
not having any self-confidence at all. Whatever
ground you had stood on, whatever morals or beliefs
you held, whatever self-confidence and self worth you
had before was just wiped out completely.
Beth—lt's like having the rug pulled out from
under you.
Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not

violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.

with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the
next morning when I realized I was so far from home
and I had three months before I could go back to my
parents.
Alice—l was in shock for a pretty long time. I
could talk about the fact that I was a rape victim, but
the emotions didn't start surfacing until a month later.
During the first two weeks there were people I had
chosen to tell who were very, very supportive. But,

.. it's important to have
someone to cry with. I don't
know exactly what the emotion
is when I cry, whether it's anger
or guilt or what. But a lot of the
times I want to cry with
someone/

after two weeks, it was like, 'Okay, she's over it, we
-can goon now." But the farther along you get the more
support you need, because as time passes you become
aware of your emotions and the need to deal with
them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.
I don't know exactly what the emotion is when I

cry, whether it's anger or guilt or what. But a lot of
times I want to cry with someone.
It's asking an awful lot of your friends and the
people around you to 'go through it with you." But it's
something you need.
It's hard for me to say to a friend, 'Could you please
put your studies aside and help me?' But if they show
their willingness, it's easier.
It's also helpful to know how your friends feel
about the rape. Do they blame you for it? Do they feel
ashamed because you were a victim? Do they feel
mad?
You're not the only one dealing with it. If you've
got a friend, they have to deal with you and in that
way they have to deal with the rape itself. It helps me
a lot to know exactly what my friends are feeling.

'One night I had a guy walk me
across the dormitory courtyard
because I couldn't walk across
by myself. That was really
ridiculous. Vet it was a real fear.
It was irrational, but fear is
irrational/

They know exactly what I'm feeling because 111 go
and tell them, but they're just listeners, and I need to
have some feedback.
Denial
Alice—There is a point where you deny it hap
pened. You just completely bury it.
Beth—You think you can go on living your life like
nothing happened. Then everything erupts. You don't
want to believe it happened.
I still can't imagine it ever happening to anyone
again. It's so unreal that you don't want to believe that
it actually happened or that it can happen. Then you
go through a long period of fear and anger.
Fear
Beth—l wouldn't shower for a long time at night
because I was afraid someone would turn off the light.
Alice—l'd have someone wait outside the shower
for me.
Beth—A couple of times I waited outside for Alice,
then she'd get out and wait for me.
Alice—l'm amazed at people. I once went into the
bathroom and said to a woman who didn't know I had
been raped, 'I'm really scared to take a shower. Will
you please just sit outside the door? 11l only be 5
minutes.' She asked if I was okay and I said, 'Yes, but I
just don't feel comfortable taking a shower right now.'
She said, t)kay, 111 sit outside and read.'
Beth—One night I had a guy walk me across the
dormitory courtyard because I couldn't walk across by
myself. That was really ridiculous. Yet it was a real
fear. It was irrational, but fear is irrational.
Alice—l'm terrified of going jogging. I completely
stopped any kind of physical activity after I was raped.
1 started it again this quarter. But every time I go
jogging I have a perpetual fear. My pulse doubles. Of
course I don't go jogging alone anymore, but still the
fear is there constantly. I check bathroom stalls now

before I go in. This fear is sometimes very irrational.
Whatever sense of security you had is gone and you
realize that you really aren't as secure as you thought
you were.
I find myself walking in the middle of the street
now. I refuse to walk on the sidewalk unless I'm with

'Whatever ground you had
stood on, whatever morals or
beliefs you held, whatever self
confidence and self-worth you
had before was just wiped out
completely.'

someone. As a courtesy, guys want to walk on the side
next to the street. That makes me feel very closed in, I
think he could push me into the bushes. I prefer to
walk next to the street so I could run out into it. I was
walking with a man who is a friend, and I found
myself keeping him in front of me. I didn't want him in
back of me. I didn't want him next to me. 1 carry my
backpack a different way, so I'm always ready to
swing it at someone. Walking to my room. 11l carry

my key ring in my hand with the keys sticking out
between my fingers (for use in scratching an at
tacker?).
Beth—l've experienced some really irrational
thoughts. I was home at Christmas riding in the car
with my Dad—my Dad!—and the guy who attacked
me was about 21 years old—and yet I got really afraid
all of a sudden of my Dad. It's just something you
have to work out. There's not anything anybody can
do.
Alice—A lot of girls ask me, 'What do I do?' when 1
tell them I was a rape victim. My advice is you can be
cautious, but don't let fear run your life.
Eventually I hope I can jog by myself again
because it's inconvenient to have to go find a jogging
partner. This is my life and I have every right to go out
and jog when I want. I don't think 10:30 a.m. is an
unreasonable time. Right now I can't do that—l'm not
ready for that.
Betrayal and loneliness
Alice—There's also a feeling of having all your
friends betray you. 1 had a dream in which I was being
assaulted outside my dorm. In the dream, everyone
was looking out their windows—the faces were so


Carol Bennett/Daily
clear —every one of my friends lined up against the
windows watching. And there were even people two
feet away from me. They all saw what was happening
and none of them did anything. I woke up and had a
feeling of extreme loneliness. Sometimes you just feel
like there's nobody around.
Beth—l still feel very lonely. I didn't have any
close friends when I got here. I felt betrayed by my
family and friends from high school because they
weren't here.
I thought the whole Stanford campus was evil. I
met my roommate in the morning and went to
orientation, then this happened in the evening. I
became afraid of the campus in general. Finally I
realized that life here was actually normal and it
wasn't the norm to be raped every night.
I'm just beginning to gain control over my life
again. One of the biggest problems was that I never
had any control once it happened. Since I didn't have a
routine before and I didn't know what to expect from
school, it was really difficult to handle day today life.
Rejection
Alice —A lot of times people joke with you saying,
Xjo away.' You become extremely sensitive and feel
that it's automatic rejection. They don't want me
around!' HI take it to heart—and I know it's a joke but
it still will affect me five times as much as it would
have prior to November
I'm not asking friends to be careful what they
say—they should act normally—but they should be
aware that if victims act or seem more sensitive,
there's a reason for it. They're not just being moody or
fickle. They're trying to cope and regain control of
their lives.
Lack of self-confidence
Alice—The worst thing for me to go through was
not having any self-confidence at all. Whatever
ground you had stood on, whatever morals or beliefs
you held, whatever self-confidence and self worth you
had before was just wiped out completely.
Beth—lt's like having the rug pulled out from
under you.
Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.

Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.

Alice—My mind was very much intact; I was being
very logical. I would think of something I could do to
hurt him, then I would think, 'I won't be able to
outrun him because I'm tired.' I was so logical it didn't
get me anywhere, because every time I thought I could
do something I would think, 'But then if he does this,
you're in worse trouble than you are now.'
Beth—l went to a self-defense class about two
months ago. I had a lot of trouble because they have
people grab you from behind and I just couldn't deal
with people grabbing me. I had trouble with people
just touching me. That sounds really ridiculous. After
class we'd sit around and talk about how we could
defend ourselves and what things had happened to us.
It was really hard listening to other people who had
been attacked in brutal ways
Alice—A girl asked me to go jogging early this
quarter. I didn't want to go but she said. Oh, you have
to go, you have to keep it up. Besides, if you do get
attacked then you can outrun him.' It does help to be
in physically good shape, but in my case, I had already
run a mile and a half. I was dead tired; I would not
have been able to outrun him. So it is a misconception
that if you jog it will help you. People are not immune
to rape.
I don't think women should carry weapons. If you
lost control of a weapon it could be used against you.
Beth—lt's very easy to lose control of what you
have. I lost total use of my arms, my mind, my whole
body was just frozen, paralyzed. After I froze it was
like my soul left my body and I was watching myself
being attacked. It wasn't me, it was just my body. I
figured I could either be raped or be beaten and raped.
Alice—l was being slapped around. I just kept
thinking, 'I don't want to die this way.' I prayed
through the whole thing. I kept thinking he would pull
a knife and cut me to pieces.
Shock
Beth —First there's absolute shock. It hit me the

them.
Also, it's important to have someone to cry with.

Alice—lt helps me when people tell me, 'You look

good Uxlay.' The slightest thing can just make your
day. Your sense of self worth has diminished and to
have someone tell you that makes you think maybe
you are worth something after all.
Overcoming fear
Beth—About a month and-a half after my attack, 1
was very depressed and wanted to walk out in the
rain—l love rain—by myself. I was very angry about
the attack.
I realized I had to trust God again. I had to get on
with my life—l couldn't come to a standstill.
So I went out by myself at 9 p.m. and walked all
the way across campus, right past the place where I
was attacked. I was scared. My heart was pounding.
But it was something I had to do.
I had to prove to myself that I wasn't insane, that I
was self sufficient, that I could make it across campus
by myself. Although it probably wasn't the smartest
thing to do, it was something I personally had to do.
Alice—l can see in the future having to go back to
the stadium, but I won't go alone. The first time 111
probably take someone with me and have them stand
at a certain spot and 111 walk around the stadium.
Then 111 probably go alone. But you have to do it at
your own pace.
Judgments
Beth—People are very quick to judge when you
should be ready to deal with something.
Alice—Sometimes friends will be listening to you
and you can tell by their reaction that they're saying,
'No, you don't feel that way, you feel this way.' They
shouldn't tell you how you feel because you don't feel
that way.
Religion
Beth—My religious beliefs helped me a lot.
Alice—Mine did too. I used to go to Memorial
Church everyday and sit there and pray for an hour.
But after a couple of weeks I was asking myself if I
blamed God. There was anger at God for letting it
happen to me. Why was I the victim, why me?
Beth—That was a big question for a long time
why me?
Alice—l remember telling a close friend I had been
raped and she said, 'Why you, Alice? You don't
deserve that, you've never done anything to hurt
anybody.' It angered me because nobody deserves it.
Rape vs. mugging
Alice—l heard a guy talking at one of the rape
discussion sessions I went to. He posed the question,
'What is the difference between a man being mugged
and a woman being raped?' I thought about that a lot
and wondered why I was making such a big deal about
it. Was I doing it because society says rape victims are
always scarred or am I really reacting to it? I'm still
contemplating it. Something inside says there's a
definite difference between being raped and mugged.
Beth—lt s unique to your womanhood.
Alice—Yeah, it's being violated. But for the longest
time I was thinking, .'What's the big thing? There are
tons of people who get mugged everyday and they sure
don't react this way.' It was a big thing to overcome
to separate assault from rape. There's a battle; I had to
see it in sexual terms to see why it was affecting me,
yet I couldn't understand why I had these emotions.
The will to survive
Beth—lt's incredible what the human spirit can
endure, when you have to do it. You have four

choices: you can go through it, you can give up, you
can commit suicide, you can go crazy. I would have
gone crazy if I knew how. I wouldn't go home. So it
was either suicide or survival.
Did you think of suicide?
Beth—Yeah, but I don't think I would have done
it.
When it first happened I buried it all. I had just
arrived at Stanford. This was going to be my new
beginning, I was finally away from home. Stanford
was going to be so much fun and so great. And then it
happened.
I told the police some of what happened, but not
everything. What was important was that he had
damaged something in me mentally, psychologically.
It wasn't as much what he did, but more the
violation of my body that really bothered me. I
thought I could keep buried everything that happened
and nobody would ever find out and it wouldn't
matter. I wanted a chance to start fresh here. I didn't
want it to hinder anything in my new life in
California.
Now I think if someone ever attacked me again, I
hope he'd kill me because I wouldn't want to live
through it again. I know I could, but it would just be
so awful to go through it again.
Vet at the time, I was very survival-conscious.
Even after the whole thing had happened, it was just
something physical that I would get over. I wanted to
survive—that was my whole drive. I didn't want to get
back at him or hurt him as much as I just wanted to
live.
Before it happened I always wondered if I'd be able
to survive something like that, whether I was fooling
myself to think I could summon up strength from
somewhere. After it happened I wanted to prove to
myself and the world that I could make it —with a
little help from friends.
Alice—lf you packed up and went home you'd be
giving in and telling him, 'You ruined me.' If you stay
here and survive you're saying, 'you may have hurt me
for a fraction of time, but I can go on.'
Beth—lt's sort of like you dare the rapist. I'm going
to show him that even though I couldn't get away, I'm

going to beat him by surviving and being a good
member of this community.
Support
Alice—l had a lot of support instantly after the
rape. I had an 11:00 class at the stadium. I went there,
got someone to walk me to my dorm. Some people
took me to Cowell—the people there were really
nice—they referred me to the Medical Center. By the
time I got there the rape crisis people had arrived, and
the police and doctors. It was just instantaneous —
which made a great deal of difference.
They weren't saying, 'What were you doing out
there by yourself?' They were understanding, very
patient.
I think the best thing is if friends can avoid saying,
'What were you doing out by yourself; you should
have known better.' The last thing you need to hear is
that you were stupid.
The support here is remarkable. I consider myself
very lucky. There are so many people in my dorm who
are just incredible! Guys offer to walk me places....
Beth—Yes, the guys have been really good. It's
embarrassing to have to ask someone to walk you
somewhere. But I've never asked somebody who said
he wouldn't.
Men who are supportive of you know you were vic
tims?
Alice—All of them know now, but they were
supportive even before they knew I was one of the
victims. I told them afterwards.
Beth—lt hits home a lot closer when you know
somebody it happened to. I've told a lot of women
about it. They know you and they know you don't
take extraordinary risks and if it already happened to
you, then they become a lot more aware of potential
danger.
Alice—l think the awareness has been really good.
But I'm afraid now that it's just another thing. That an
article about another rape would just be bypassed by
people—just another daily occurrence. So many have
happened now that it's just like any other thing.
Maybe people don't feel as strongly about it because
it's so recurrent.
