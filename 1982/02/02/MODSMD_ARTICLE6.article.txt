# 'Rape is no accident' say campus assault victims
## 
### 
Editor's note:
Following a rape awareness ses
sion conducted by the Stanford
Police Jan. 21, two of the women
who had been sexually assaulted
on campus this fall began talking
to Univiversity News and Publica
tion's Karen Bartholemew. A po
liceman had asserted that joggers
become "mesmerized," making
them vulnerable to rape. This was
untrue, said one of the women,
explaining that she was aware of
her attacker. . .but thought he was
a fellow jogger.
From this opening conversa
tion, Bartholemew and the two
women, both freshmen, agreed to

get together and talk about their
experiences.
Following is the text of the in
terview which appeared in last
Wednesday's Campus Report. It
will appear in two parts. Tomor
row we will print the second half
of the interview plus a statement
designed especially for Stanford
students, by three of the women
who were assaulted this fall. Like
the Daily, News and Publications
does not seek out nor publish the
names of rape victims without
their permission; the woman who
will be referred to as Alice, was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5, when she was attacked

and raped.
The woman who will be called
Beth was assaulted near Tresidder
Union on her first day at Stanford
in the fall. However, the attacker
did not complete the rape.

Alice — I saw him from a distance of about 20 yards
before the attack. He was dressed as a jogger. I was
grabbed in a way that I couldn't use my elbows, my
body was instantly pinned against his. Looking back,
the only thing I could have done would have been to
grind my heel into his instep or give him a slight kick
on the shin. From the time I was grabbed, I was
pinned and it didn't click that I was free from my
knees down. I couldn't scream because my mouth
was covered. By the time I did have enough reaction
to scream, I was frozen — I was in a state of shock.
When you're first grabbed, you're not able to react to
the danger. By the time you're aware of the danger,
you're not physically able to scream. I think it sounds
dumb, but women should just practice screaming. I
couldn't have screamed because my mouth was cov
ered and then he started choking me. But if there had
been a chance to scream, I don't know if I would have
because my body was frozen.
Beth — If you could get used to screaming when
ever someone grabs you, it would be a lot easier.
When he grabbed me, I knew I should scream, yet
nothing came out. Later when I tried to make noise,
he kept hitting me so I couldn't.
I took self-defense in high school. I know enough
that I could really hurt someone. Yet when it first hap-

pened, I froze. You have a totally different mentality
when you're being attacked than when you're just
walking around. But it's good to know about the sen
sitive parts of the body and how to hurt them without
having to be very strong.
Alice — You can't just learn the physical tech
niques. You have to have a psychological state of
mind that enables you to instantly control yourself
and not freeze. I think a good self-defense course
should deal with both physical and mental states — a
good peace-of-mind mental state.
Beth — You think you're so strong that you could
really beat upsomebody and yet you can't. When I re
alized I was frozen, I pa nicked and that was the wrong
thing to do. Once you panic, it's too late. Finally I re
laxed, got my head together, and kicked him. I hurt
him and I got away. That's why he didn't finish.
If you're not so surprised that something you tried
to do didn't work, then you can overcome it. You
have to expect that it might take a while and that you
might freeze. The mental state is so much more im
portant than the physical state. It doesn't take much
strength to hurt someone. If you've ever been hit in
the nose — that hurts! It doesn't take that much
strength to kick a man in the groin.
