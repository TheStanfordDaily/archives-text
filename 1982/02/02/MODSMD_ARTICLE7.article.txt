## Cable television and the information revolution 
### John Kelley 
"We will be the richest and most powerful
group the world has ever know ... I just
hope we'll be happy." — Ted Turner, ad
dressing the Western Regional Cable Tele
vision Conference on December 12,1981
Cable television offers the world its first
chance to integrate the diverse technologies
constituting the information revolution in a
single communications medium. Through
co-axial cable, which has an intermetallic
core, an insulator and a metal sheath, it will
be possible to transmit and receive digital
and analog signals sufficient to support tele
vision, telephones, and computers. The
degree to which this integration process is
realized will be determined by the impend
ing competition in the telecommunications
field between cable entrepreneurs, broad
cast television networks, computer manu
facturers, and the Bell system. The effects of
this competition will be profound: it will in
fluence our lives by shaping our work and
leisure. Understanding of communications
is necessary to control this technology, and
not be controlled by it.
Ancient drama provides a simple example
of one type of long distance communica
tions. In the play Agamemnon, Clytemnestro
awaits news of the outcome of the Trojan
war. As the play opens, the night watchman
detectsa brilliant beacon on the horizon, the
last of a series of fires burning from one
mountain to the next that herald the fall of
Troy. In this case, the process of encoding
and decoding is vastly simplified because the
signal is agreed upon beforehand: only one
message can be sent; and only one is ex
pected. The first dim rays of fire foretell the
entire story. For this reason, the communica
tions medium need only be modulated be

tween two distinct states. Either the light is
present or it is absent. In modern computer
science parlance, a single bit of information
serves to convey news of an epic event.
Communication has advanced con
siderably since the days of Aeschylus. The
discovery of static electricity by Thales of
Miletus in approximately 600 B.C. fore
shadowed the age of electronics. In the 1830s
and 1840s, long after the discovery of the
printing press, William Cooke, Charles
Wheatstone, and Samuel Morse developed
the telegraph. In the 1870s, Alexander
Graham Bell and Elisha Gray reworked tele
graphic technology to permit the trans
mission of audio analog signals — the human
voice — across wire lines. By 1895, Guglielmo
Marconi was able to send and receive radio
signals through the air. During the 19205,
Vladimir Zworykin perfected techniques for
communicating video images using tele
vision. Finally, in 1944, Howard Aiken and a
host of others, including the mathematician,
John von Neumann, succeeded in realizing
Charles Babbage's nineteenth century
dream of an "analytical engine" by construc
ting the first general-purpose digital com
puter. Each stage in the development of de
vices for encoding, decoding, and manipu
lating information has spurred demand for
more efficient means of transmitting identi
cal information, because the value of in
formation is maximized as it is shared.
In theory there are several media available
to transmit information from one person to
another. Most common is the process of rec
ording information in a physical substance,
either by applying a veneer to some artifact
as when writing with a pencil on a piece of
paper or reading a printed page. Because
physical substances tend to deteriorate and

are difficult to amplify and reproduce,
greater attention has been given to rec
ording information in energy. Electro-mag
netic radiation is rapidly becoming the chief
repository of information. Light, radio waves
and electricity are the principal forms of
electro-magnetic radiation that are available
to transmit information.

At the present, co-axial cable is less ex
pensive and more readily available than
fiber-optic cable and has significantly
greater channel capacity than twisted wires.
In the short run, co-axial cable is likely to
emerge as the preferred medium for trans
mitting information recorded in electro
magnetic form. Ordinary twisted wires, such
as those used by the telephone company for
local connections, have a maximum channel
of capacity of approximately 1 megahertz,

which is equivalent to transmitting one mil
lion bits of information per second. Co-axial
cable, such as that routinely installed for
cable television, has a channel capacity of
approximately 400 megahertz. Fiber-optic
cable promises one or more additional order
of magnitude of channel capacity, but until it
can be produced more efficiently, it will be
confined to short-distance and experimental
applications (for at least the next ten years).
The Japanese, leaders in fiber optic technol
ogy, do not expect to wire a sizable com
| munity until the late 1980s.
Now that homes and businesses can be
wired with co-axial cable, important political
questions begin to emerge. How will this ca
pacity for transmitting and receiving in
formation be used and for whose benefit?
Presently, individual municipalities have the
right to award franchises for cable networks.
Most of these have been gathered up by
commercial enterprises that are becoming
major contributors to local political cam
paigns. The leaders in this field have used co
axial cable almost exclusively as a means for
distributing slightly more diversified tele
vision fare. We are witnessing the prolifera
tion of nation-wide cable television
networks devoted to cultural programming,
movies, entertainment services, and sports.
Because these programs can be offered to
smaller and individually selected audiences
across the nation by using satellites, they
tend to generate more revenue from sub
scribers and advertisers. In this mode, co-ax
ial cable can be used to deliver a plethora of
highly stylized programs suited to the indi
vidualized tastes of millions of people.
At the same time, co-axial cable, and its
likely successors — fiber-cable and perhaps
roof-top satellite transceivers — can be

adapted to serve other social purposes.
Cable can permit two-way communication
as well as unidirectional distribution. The
same lines that enhance the reception of
Monday Night Football can be can be used
to connect $200 home terminals with cen
tralized computers and to provide tele
phone communication at a fraction of the
cost that AT&T charges. These possibilities
will only be realized, however, if municipal
governments and their constituencies rec
ognize this technological potential and de
mand the very best that can be provided.
In a speech to the West Regional Cable
Television Convention concerning "Cable
in the 19905," Ted Turner, owner of WTBS,
the nation's first satellite "Superstation," and
founder of the Cable News Network, blithe
ly challenged cable executives to consider
buying out AT&T in the next decade. It isevi
dent that cable entrepreneurs such asTurner
will be able to command enormous reven
ues as their subscribers use these com
munication systems for more and more
purposes. Ultimately it will be up to local
governments and Congress to decide how
much of this money will be retained within
the communities cable networks serve, and
how much will be diverted to fuel the cur
rent conflagration of inter-corporate merger
and acquisition. As cable executives scream
"First Amendment!" when threatened with
any form of government regulation that may
jeopardize their control over this new form
of economic magnificence, our political
leaders will be confronted with difficult
choices and ongoing struggles. Cable prom
ises to spark an information revolution:
whether this nascent technology brings
about, or continues to impede, a social tran
formation remains to be seen.
