# Mouse virus may provide cancer clues

Studies of a mouse leukemia virus that exists only in
laboratories may provide important clues to the
biochemical mechanisms that underlie a wide range
of cancers.
The virus — the Abelson virus — carries a gene nor
mally present in the mouse, and recent advances in
molecular biology and recombinant DNA are allow
ing researchers to uncover the way this gene "tran
forms" normal white blood cells to a leukemic condi
tion, according to Nobel laureate Dr. David Balti
more, who presented the third annual John W. Cline
Memorial Lecture at the School of Medicine on Jan.
28. Baltimore, who received the 1975 Nobel Prize for
his work on viruses and cancer, is professor of micro

biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
A gene is a segment qf the DNA (genetic coding
material) present in every cell and divided into
chromosomes. The Abelson virus belongs to a broad
class of viruses which, as a strand of DNA, are able to
integrate themselves in a dormant state directly into a
chromosome of the host animal. When the host cell
divides, the integrated virus is copied just like genes
on the host chromosome, and both daughter cells
carry the dormant virus. In this silent state, the virus
may enter an active state, reproduce hundreds of
copies itself, and spread throughout the organism.
The history of the Abelson leukemia virus, found
only in mice, is even more unusual. During the early
19705, a fast-acting leukemia virus suddenly appeared

among a colony of mice being studied with a slow-act
ing virus. Since the mid-19705, Baltimore and his co
workers have been able toestablish thatthe new virus
arose when the original virus exchanged much of its
genetic material with a mouse chromosome, resulting
in a new virus.
In a Daily interview, Baltimore said the Abelson vi
rus is a laboratory artifact, and is unable to reproduce
without a second "helper" virus. The leukemia-caus
ing action, he said, may be "an accidental by-product
of the virus's life strategy," which involves a dormant
phase. Cancer-causing viruses are known mainly in
laboratory animals, although a few human viruses
such as some hepatitis viruses may have some small
correlation with later cancers.
