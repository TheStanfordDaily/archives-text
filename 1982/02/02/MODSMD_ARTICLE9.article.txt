## Alan Tripp Stereotype versus hierarchy 
### 
With the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) apparently headed for defeat
early this summer, the time has come
for feminists to accept the loss and
direct their attention toward the
future and the gains to be made
there. At the same time, it is crucial
for women to regard this defeat as a
temporary setback rather than as a
reversal of the movement toward
equality of the sexes. Even now, pro
posals for a new and better version of
the ERA are being advanced which
would specifically identify equality
for women as its intent.
Still, the future of a new ERA pro
posal is not the only issue we face.
There are many theories and legisla
tive proposals to be developed and
enacted. Problems such as career
family conflicts, sexual violence,
pornography and child care have to
be confronted and resolved. This
work will be the challenge which
feminists of the following decades
will face.
Before going too far, however, it
would be advisable to stop and con
sider exactly where we want to go
and why. What is it that makes equal
ity between the sexes a desirable
goal? And just what is feminism any
way?
The answer to the second question
is surprisingly simple and instructive.
Webster's defines feminism as "the
doctrine that maintains the equality
of the sexes." Feminists do not de
mand a gender-free society as some
of their opponents claim. Rather,
they desire a world in which male
and female can live equally rather
than subordinately. Any person, man
or woman, is capable of seeing the
logic and justice of such a belief.
Anyone who actually believes in
equality of the sexes is by definition a
feminist. If, on the other hand, you
believe that men or women should
for some reason play the dominant
role in our society, perhaps you had

better take a long, hard look at your
self, your values and your prejudices.
Feminists are not necessarily female.
Feminists are necessarily concerned
with the concept of justice and equal
ity for all people.
When we look at the way things are
and the way we ourselves are, we
tend to accept the status quo as life as
it should be. Unfortunately, life is not
always as it should be. All of us have a
very clear idea of what it means to be
a man or a woman. In fact, we even
define ourselves according to these
ideas.
It is a particularly striking fact that
even among audiences that cheer
the ERA, the men, in general, ap
plaud heartily and loudly while the
women clap enthusiastically and
daintily. Even when they sit down,

knee while the men rest one ankle on
the opposite knee. Clearly, stere
otypical roles are extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to escape. Nor is it
certain that we would gain anything
by doing so.
In order to develop a real under
standing of the feminist position, it is
critical to make a distinction between
stereotypical and hierarchical behav
ior. Feminism supports equality, not

sameness. It is one thing to allow for
the fact that women may prefer to
dress one way and men another. It is
another thing entirely when a wom
an is tacitly required to give up her
career plans in deference to those of
her husband as often happens in our
society. Obviously, such a situation
requires a decision and a choice, but
how many of us have heard of a case
where a man had to leave his job
when his wife's company transferred
her to another area?
Anyone who has studied the sub
ject knows that there are some real
differences between men and wom
en. It's a misconception, however, to
think that the bulk of these dif
ferences derive from genetic make
up. The fact is that men and women
differ biologically far less and socially
far more than is commonly held. For
the most part, women are better
suited to take care of little children
not because of genetically defined
differences but because of socially
defined roles. Feminists look at these
roles and ask the question: Why?
In many ways, I welcome the
chance to begin anew the fight foran
equal rights amendment. The re
moval of legal ambiguities from a re
vised amendment will force the
hands of many politicians who claim
they oppose the ERA on this ground.
It will make clear to the voters wheth
er or not their representatives are le
gally cautious or essentially sexist. In
other areas (such as career-family
conflicts which I mentioned before),
I expect to see continued progress —
though I'm sure we will often be frus
trated by the slowness of change. The
fight for "the doctrine that maintains
the equality of the sexes" is never an
easy one, but women can rest as
sured that they are not alone in this
fight; many men are with them.

Feminists are necessarily concerned
with the concept of justice and equal

When we look at the way things are
and the way we ourselves are, we
tend to accept the status quo as life as
it should be. Unfortunately, life is not
always as it should be. All of us have a
very clear idea of what it means to be
a man or a woman. In fact, we even
define ourselves according to these
ideas.

knee while the men rest one ankle on
the opposite knee. Clearly, stere
otypical roles are extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to escape. Nor is it
certain that we would gain anything
by doing so.
In order to develop a real under
standing of the feminist position, it is
critical to make a distinction between
stereotypical and hierarchical behav
ior. Feminism supports equality, not

sameness. It is one thing to allow for
the fact that women may prefer to
dress one way and men another. It is
another thing entirely when a wom
an is tacitly required to give up her
career plans in deference to those of
her husband as often happens in our
society. Obviously, such a situation
requires a decision and a choice, but
how many of us have heard of a case
where a man had to leave his job
when his wife's company transferred
her to another area?
Anyone who has studied the sub
ject knows that there are some real
differences between men and wom
en. It's a misconception, however, to
think that the bulk of these dif
ferences derive from genetic make
up. The fact is that men and women
differ biologically far less and socially
far more than is commonly held. For
the most part, women are better
suited to take care of little children
not because of genetically defined
differences but because of socially
defined roles. Feminists look at these
roles and ask the question: Why?

they oppose the ERA on this ground.

fight; many men are with them.

With the Equal Rights Amendment
(ERA) apparently headed for defeat
early this summer, the time has come
for feminists to accept the loss and
direct their attention toward the
future and the gains to be made
there. At the same time, it is crucial
for women to regard this defeat as a
temporary setback rather than as a
reversal of the movement toward
equality of the sexes. Even now, pro
posals for a new and better version of
the ERA are being advanced which
would specifically identify equality
for women as its intent.
Still, the future of a new ERA pro
posal is not the only issue we face.
There are many theories and legisla
tive proposals to be developed and
enacted. Problems such as career
family conflicts, sexual violence,
pornography and child care have to
be confronted and resolved. This
work will be the challenge which
feminists of the following decades
will face.
Before going too far, however, it
would be advisable to stop and con
sider exactly where we want to go
and why. What is it that makes equal
ity between the sexes a desirable
goal? And just what is feminism any
way?
The answer to the second question
is surprisingly simple and instructive.
Webster's defines feminism as "the
doctrine that maintains the equality
of the sexes." Feminists do not de
mand a gender-free society as some
of their opponents claim. Rather,
they desire a world in which male
and female can live equally rather
than subordinately. Any person, man
or woman, is capable of seeing the
logic and justice of such a belief.
Anyone who actually believes in
equality of the sexes is by definition a
feminist. If, on the other hand, you
believe that men or women should
for some reason play the dominant
role in our society, perhaps you had

better take a long, hard look at your
self, your values and your prejudices.
