New York â€” The sober eco
nomic outlook has produced
an effect that in other times
might be considered un-Amer
ican, but which some think is
welcome today. It has under
mined some of our great ex
pectations.
Not all of them. The techno
logists are still drawing up the
future on their planning
boards, and the think tanks are
bursting with innovative con
cepts. But the inflation ex
ploiters are disappearing like
Medflies.
What has happened to the
sellers of inflation, the people
who sent you form letters
saying that if you really wanted
to be rich quickly you should
buy diamonds or gold, or an
tiques, prints or other collec
tibles?
Some of them are around
still, remaining certain that in
flation is inevitable and that it
will make them wealthy, and
you too, if you'd only listen.
But people aren't listening as
they did a few years ago, when
the rising consumer price in
dex lent credibility to the ped

dlers.
Some of those who write get
rich newsletters find circula
tion is down. Some are finding
inflated postage costs too
much to contend with. Many
have been forced to lay low un
til inflation hysteria is resur
rected.
Where are all those new
stock issues that double in
price before the week and
sometimes before the day is
out? You don't hear much
about them. Promoters of such
issues know how hard it is to at
tract money.
And what happened to that
old staple of cocktail parties,
the line that began "Do you
know what I was offered for my
house the other day?" How
smoothly it was slipped into the
conversation. How practiced
the indifference with which
the owner dropped the ques
tion. What triumph as he wit
nessed the envy of his listeners.
Too bad; no more.
What became of the ar
rogance of the seller who used
to say "That's the price, take it
or leave it?" Recently some

body told him "forget it." He'll
never get over it. No longer
does he maintain even the
pose. No longer is he confident
he can get his price. Just wit
ness the behavior of auto
makers. Or real estate agents.
Or diamond merchants.
Where are the boasts from
labor? Gone. You can't make
demands unless someone is
buying the goods. Instead, la
bor negotiators today are often
found working with man
agement on the problem of
raising productivity, and they
are even willing to give back
benefits in order to help.
