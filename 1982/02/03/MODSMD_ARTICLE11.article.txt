## Small town bans all guns... 
### Los Angeles Times 
Morton Grove, lII.— The last
resident of this Chicago suburb
to die from a handgun wound
was a 22-year-old woman
named Helga who shot herself
last September with her
father's .38-caliber revolver
moments after a telephone dis
pute with her boyfriend.
It was this kind of deadly in
cident that village fathers
hoped could be prevented
when they adopted the na
tion's toughest gun control law
— an ordinance banning hand
gun possession — that went
into effect here Monday.
"You've got to wonder what
that father feels about hand
guns now," said Mayor Richard
Flickinger, who says that his lit
tle community of 24,500 will be
a safer place if handgun num
bers can be substantially re
duced.
However, there was no im
mediate stampede of residents
turning in their now-illegal

handguns to police on the first
day of the ban. The few who
did declined to be identified.
"We arant't looking for any
great rush of guns — they'll
probably just dribble in," said
Mayor Flickinger, whose office
resembled a television studio
much of the day Monday as
Morton Grove found itself in
the glare of a national media
spotlight.
"No one ever heard of
Morton Grove before we stood
up to the NRA (National Rifle
Association), but now I'm get
ting calls from reporters in
Phoenix, Arizona, Denver, Bos
ton . . . eventhe | BBC (British
Broadcasting Corp.) called,"
he chuckled with undisguised
satisfaction.
"We hope all this attention
gets other towns involved so
that we arn't a lone voice in the
wilderness,' the 65-year-old
mayor added.
While the Morton Grove ex
ample hasyettospawnanysim

ilar handgun bans in other
communities, several Chicago
suburbs — ranging in size from
Evanston with 80,000 residents
to North Riverside with 6700 —
are considering tough gun
control ordinances. And
Mayor Jane Byrne of Chicago
has introduced a measure to
freeze handgun ownership in
that city.
This mostly white, middle
class suburb bounded onto
center court of the national de
bate over gun control on June
8,1981. That night the handgun
ordinance was debated at an
often heated, 4Vi hour-long
meeting of village trustees. An
overflow crowd gathered at
the Village Hall and cable tele
vision carried the meeting into
local stations.
Trustees approved the or
dinance by a 4-2 vote, and it has
since beenupheld in both fed
eral and state courts. But both

rulings are being appealed by
representatives of the NRA and
other gun advocates.
"The NRA has never been
scared in its life," said Flick
inger, resting between tele
vision specials in his office
Monday. "They're losing in the
courts and they haven't even
been able to scare us into back
ing down. They've promised to
pour a lot of money into the
next trustee election here, but
they'll lose again."
Police and village officials
said they will move slowly to
enforce the ban.
"We aren't going to be
knocking down doors to con
fiscate handguns," the mayor
said. "It won't be much dif
ferent than enforcing mari
juana laws. Possession of mari
juana is illegal, too, but we
can't just go busting into a per
son's home without a proper
search warrant."
