Los Angeles — When attorney Steve
King is driving his 1980 Cadillac Eldorado,
he says he feels safer because of what's in
the trunk: the civilian version of the Israeli
Uzi submachine gun.
"I can't carry it loaded or with me inside
the car because that's illegal," he said.
"Under the circumstances, it (the trunk) is
the only place I can carry it." in a pinch,
King believes, he could reach the gun
quickly despite its location.
For King, the Uzi is the ultimate in self
protection in an urban environment that
has changed his attitude about crime and
his vulnerability to it. Until last summer,
King said, he hadn't owned or used a gun
since his service days in the early 19605.
Then on June 10,1981, a friend, criminal
lawyer Ervin Roeder, 60, and Roeder's wife
Jennifer, 39, were shot to death in an ap
parent robbery attempt. The unsolved
murders sent King, who describes himself
as a "left-of-center moderate" politically,
to a gun shop, he said. "When that hap
pened, I figured there's a limit to what the
police can do.
"No doubt, I feel safer with it,"he said.
"The odds are that with the Uzi I'm going
to have more firepower than an attacker. It
gives you the edge. God forbid I ever have
to use it."

While King may be unusual in keeping
his gun within sprinting distance, he is not
alone in his affection for a class of firearms
that is much in evidence in gun stores to
day: the paramilitary weapon. Such fire
arms are the close relations of guns now
used by U.S. and other Western armed
forces. Thus, they are not obsolescent mili
tary surplus but the state-of-the-art in gun
technology.
The major difference between the mili
tary and civilian versions is that the civilian
type cannot be fired automatically — at
least when it is sold. There is some argu
ment about the effectiveness and safety of
the procedure but gun experts agree that
these weapons can be modified for fully
automatic firing, provided the owner is
willing to violate federal law. That lawcalls
for a maximum penalty of five years' im
prisonment and a $10,000 fine for illegal
possession of an automatic weapon.
The cost of these rifles and carbines also
separates them from the typical gun —
usually a handgun — popularly associated
with crime and home protection. Prices
range from about $500 to well over $1000
— costs that gun store owners and opera
tors say limit buyers to enthusiasts who
don't care about price and the well-heeled
who are as label-conscious about their
weapons as they are about their clothes or

automobiles. King says, "You don't want to
Mickey Mouse around when your life is in
danger."
Burt Avedon, president of a New York
City company that makes expedition
clothing, said he owns a paramilitary rifle
primarily because he is a gun fancier, not a
paranoiac about crime. He maintains that
the rifles are inferior to handguns for pro
tection at home where the weapons are
too bulky for close-quarter use.
"It's not the kind of thing you're going
to use around the house," Avedon says."It
would have to be Fort Apache where you
hear the sound of the bugles and have time
to mount the walls of the fort."
Although exact figures are hard to come
by, there's little doubt that sales of para
military weapons are on the rise. Sales
began to climb about five years ago, partly
because manufacturers began stepping up
their marketing and advertising.
Despite the widespread availability of
those weapons, there is disagreement
among gun owners about whether para
military arms should be so readily avail
able. Kahn, for example, sees the rifles
mainly as improvements on earlier types.
He particularly is impressed with their per
formance under severe climatic condi
tions, he said.
