## Viewpoint/Kurt Elieson Registration: a lawful choice 
### 
There are at least four reasons why
18-year-old men oppose the draft
and do not register in compliance
with mandatory registration:
1. They are conscientious objectors
who do not believe in killing.
2. They do not agree with dying for
political causes and organizations.
3. They want to reserve the right to
decide whether or not a particular
war justifies their involvement.
4. They are protesting the steps
taken towards the resumption of the
draft for at least one of the above rea
sons.
Since registration is the law, two
questions arise: Should young men
cite Thoreau's majority of one and
disobey the law? Can the United
States government, or any govern
ment allow them to do so? The an
swer to both questions is a resound
ing no.
To answer the second question
first, no government can tolerate
either persons or groups who preach
disobedience to that'government. If
the proponents of disobedience
triumph and the government loses
the ability to enforce its laws, then
that government soon passes away.
Assuming the desirability of our pres
ent form of government, this
scenario is unacceptable.
But, for the government to hold
sway, it must prosecute those who
disobey its laws. This is not to say that
any law, including mandatory regis
tration, is either correct or inviolable.

However, due to President Ronald
Reagan's reaffirmation of man
datory registration, it must be ac
cepted as a fact for the foreseeable
future. This fact warrants obedience
to the constitutional framework in
changing the legal code.
But does the authority of the gov
ernment extend so far as to permit it
to call for the young men of this
country to kill and risk being killed?
Yes. Our country was founded upon
the idea that certain privileges are
worth both dying and killing for,
even worth revolution. These same
liberties are just as important today as
they were 200 years ago.
The defense of our freedoms was
obviously necessary in a conflict such
as World War 11. But most people are
not complaining that they must de
fend their country against direct ag
gression; they are protesting com
pulsory fighting in a conflict like Viet
nam. In effect, people want the right
to judge whether or not they should
be forced to fight.
But this is not their perogative.
Rather, it is the perogative of their
elected representatives, the presi
dent and the Congress. The courts
have already upheld the constitu
tionality of this arrangement. Man
datory registration means mandatory
compliance. A mandatory 55 m.p.h.
speed limit does not allow one to
drive at 70 m.p.h. until the law is re
pealed. If we are allowed to pick and
choose the laws that we will obey,
than we may as well not have laws.

But should people fail to register in
order to have the law itself changed?
No. Should people protest school
zones by speeding? No. Should peo
ple protest high taxes by refusing to
pay? Why not? After all, our jail sys
tem can't hope to handle everyone in
the 50 percent tax bracket. The an
swer is that obedience to the laws of
this country is the price we pay for
the knowledge that others, too, will
follow them.
A line must be drawn somewhere.
Both precedent and reason say that it
should include obedience to the law.
This is not to say that registration is
either necessary or desirable, but it is
the law. And that is the issue.
There are two questions to be
asked independent of each other:
1. Is mandatory registration either
necessary or desirable?
2. Should I register?
The answers should also be con
sidered separately:
1. I don't know. This is an answer
based upon facts which I don't have
and would probably interpret dif
ferently than you would anyway. But
that is not the question I have at
tempted to answer.
2. Yes. This is an answer based
upon principles more correct than
the ones cited by those who fail to
register. That is why I decided to reg
ister.

compliance. A mandatory 55 m.p.h.
speed limit does not allow one to
drive at 70 m.p.h. until the law is re
pealed. If we are allowed to pick and
choose the laws that we will obey,
than we may as well not have laws.

But should people fail to register in
order to have the law itself changed?
No. Should people protest school
zones by speeding? No. Should peo
ple protest high taxes by refusing to
pay? Why not? After all, our jail sys
tem can't hope to handle everyone in
the 50 percent tax bracket. The an
swer is that obedience to the laws of
this country is the price we pay for
the knowledge that others, too, will
follow them.
A line must be drawn somewhere.
Both precedent and reason say that it
should include obedience to the law.
This is not to say that registration is
either necessary or desirable, but it is
the law. And that is the issue.
There are two questions to be
asked independent of each other:
1. Is mandatory registration either
necessary or desirable?
2. Should I register?
The answers should also be con
sidered separately:
1. I don't know. This is an answer
based upon facts which I don't have
and would probably interpret dif
ferently than you would anyway. But
that is not the question I have at
tempted to answer.
2. Yes. This is an answer based
upon principles more correct than
the ones cited by those who fail to
register. That is why I decided to reg
ister.

There are at least four reasons why
18-year-old men oppose the draft
and do not register in compliance
with mandatory registration:
1. They are conscientious objectors
who do not believe in killing.
2. They do not agree with dying for
political causes and organizations.
3. They want to reserve the right to
decide whether or not a particular
war justifies their involvement.
4. They are protesting the steps
taken towards the resumption of the
draft for at least one of the above rea
sons.
Since registration is the law, two
questions arise: Should young men
cite Thoreau's majority of one and
disobey the law? Can the United
States government, or any govern
ment allow them to do so? The an
swer to both questions is a resound
ing no.
To answer the second question
first, no government can tolerate
either persons or groups who preach
disobedience to that'government. If
the proponents of disobedience
triumph and the government loses
the ability to enforce its laws, then
that government soon passes away.
Assuming the desirability of our pres
ent form of government, this
scenario is unacceptable.
But, for the government to hold
sway, it must prosecute those who
disobey its laws. This is not to say that
any law, including mandatory regis
tration, is either correct or inviolable.

However, due to President Ronald
Reagan's reaffirmation of man
datory registration, it must be ac
cepted as a fact for the foreseeable
future. This fact warrants obedience
to the constitutional framework in
changing the legal code.
But does the authority of the gov
ernment extend so far as to permit it
to call for the young men of this
country to kill and risk being killed?
Yes. Our country was founded upon
the idea that certain privileges are
worth both dying and killing for,
even worth revolution. These same
liberties are just as important today as
they were 200 years ago.
The defense of our freedoms was
obviously necessary in a conflict such
as World War 11. But most people are
not complaining that they must de
fend their country against direct ag
gression; they are protesting com
pulsory fighting in a conflict like Viet
nam. In effect, people want the right
to judge whether or not they should
be forced to fight.
But this is not their perogative.
Rather, it is the perogative of their
elected representatives, the presi
dent and the Congress. The courts
have already upheld the constitu
tionality of this arrangement. Man
datory registration means mandatory
compliance. A mandatory 55 m.p.h.
speed limit does not allow one to
drive at 70 m.p.h. until the law is re
pealed. If we are allowed to pick and
choose the laws that we will obey,
than we may as well not have laws.

But should people fail to register in
order to have the law itself changed?
No. Should people protest school
zones by speeding? No. Should peo
ple protest high taxes by refusing to
