## Now entering the Stanford zone... 
### 
Another day, just another day in
another life somewhere on Stanford
campus. A thousand other lives par
allel, but none enter the Stanford
Zone.
A brilliant morning, nothing but
the radiator clanking like a mallot
and the sweet sounds of squirrels

A brilliant morning,
nothing but the
radiator clanking like
a mallot and the
sweet sounds of
squirrels chewing
your window sill.
What a day, nothing
to do but a few
classes, errands, and
meetings. Oh truth,
oh youth, oh beauty.

chewing your windowsill. What a
day, nothing to do but a few classes,
errands, and meetings. Oh truth, oh
youth, oh beauty.
The P.O. box. Nothing but junk
mail and a phone bill for your room
mate who stopped out and left you
with a bad check.
Ah peace. You tumble off the new
curb that just graced the back of the

post office. Oh rims, oh tires, oh
brakes.
It's 11 a.m. and you're pedaling
through the History Corner. You lose
your appendages to 1200 history stu
dents with 10 a.m. classes. Oh well.
Just a few copies, that's all I need.
The copy machine takes your new
1000 copy copicard, erases it and spits
it back at you flashing in yellow,
"sorry, try again." So the library just
lost the one source your honors
thesis depended on. Oh well.
All you want to do is get your old
number back, you tell the phone
company. But alas, they know your
family history and have one goal: to
crush your success at Stanford. David
Rockefeller is responsible for your
telephone problems. You heard a
lecture by Stanford Progressives
against Solidarity for Pacific Tele
phone Imperialism just the other
day. You grasp the conspiracy. They
all bear the mark of the beast: 411.
The phone store can't help you, the
business office won't help you. There
is .. . No exit.
Food service serveseggplantstack
ups for lunch. Your study list bears
four invalid classes. Your roommate
spills Coors on your butterfly collec
tion. You find a peanut butterand jel
ly sandwich at the bottom of your
pack. Oh well.
The dorm borrows your Chateau
Lafite Rothschild '62 for a tailgater.
You lose your room key swimming in

a fountain. A paper airplane knocks
out your contacts. Your mother
thinks you look like Woody Allen.
The Daily doesn't arrive until 3
p.m. The washer eats the last two
quarters in existence. Your meal card

into your Ramona's special. Your car
doesn't start and your parking sticker
expires.
Your English prof gives you a quan
tum mechanics problem set by mis
take. Your tan fades. Your bicycle is
towed away. The squirrels steal your
alarm clock and you miss an 8 a.m.
midterm.
Give up? Never. This is a major
Western university. If the mid-quar

think, it could have been worse; your
typewriter could have bro*(+Vi\/*
