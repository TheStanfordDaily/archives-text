## U.S. repression sets stage 
### 
I am convinced that the current president of the Unit
ed States is a murderer, a liar and an idiot.
When Congress became aware of the atrocities and
murders that were taking place in El Salvador at the
hands of U.S.-supplied government troops, it attempted
to place legislative safeguards on human rights in El
Salvador. Most notable of these was a legislative restric
tion on U.S. military aid to El Salvador which required
President Ronald Reagan to certify that the Salvadoran
government was ending rights abuse before he could
give $26 million in military aid to the government forces.
Last Thursday, Jan. 28, Reagan told Congress that the
government has made a "concerted, significant and
good faith effort to deal with the complex political, social
and human rights problems it is confronting and that
progress is being made." This assertion came in the same
week that the American Civil Liberties Union and Am
nesty International came to the well-documented con
clusion that government forces in El Salvador were re
sponsible for 12,501 murders of civilians in 1981.
Reagan's statement of January 28 is not attributable to
any secret information or nuance of interpretation.
Rather, it is a bald-faced and cynical lie to the American
public and the international community.
What is the effect of this perverse disregard for truth?

The most immediate and important effect is that more
Salvadorans are brutally murdered by U.S. weapons
wielded by U.S.-trained soldiers. The second effect is
that the force of U.S. attempts to point out the crime
against humanity that is taking place in Poland have been
adulterated by U.S. crimes against humanity in El
Salvador.
Similarly, U.S. extension of aid to Turkey, where lead
ers of opposition strikes have not only been arrested, but
also tortured and executed, erases the moral force of any
arguments the U.S. makes against Soviet actions in Po
land. In a time when the capacity of the U.S. to rally
world opinion against Soviet repression is critical, the
Reagan administration has all but destroyed its ability to
convince U.S. allies that Soviet repression is a greater
threat to world peace and human rights than is U.S. re
pression.
As U.S. citizens, we are directly responsible for U.S. ac
tions in El Salvador. Our outrage against our own gov
ernment's actions should be greater than our outrage
against the situation in Poland. The murders in El
Salvador are taking place in our name with out aid. I urge
everyone to express their outrage.
