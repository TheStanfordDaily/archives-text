## Americans become 'useful Idiots' 
### 
At the recent meeting in Washing
ton of the American Asociation for
the Advancement of Science, CIA
Deputy Director Bobby Inman
warned the American scientific com
munity that if it did not cooperate
with the government in security mat
ters, it would have to face the conse
quences. This clear warning was not
applauded.
Shortly thereafter, a number of
universities, led by Stanford, pro
claimed that they would not abide by
the restrictions placed on Soviet vis
itors imposed by the State Depart
ment through the National Academy
of Science. "The wind of freedom
blows" is Stanford's motto; univer
sitiesshould conduct no classified re
search, and there should be no re
strictions on foreign visitors.
We could only applaud if this ideal
were universally respected, but ob
viously it is not, and one of the main
offenders is the Soviet Union. I know
whereof I speak. I have given a series
of lectures at the Soviet Academy of
Sciences and at universities and re
search institutes in other Soviet-bloc
countries.
As editor of the World Affairs Re
port, which is primarily an on-going
analysis of the Soviet role in the
world and always has a section on sci
ence, I read Soviet sources with
diligence. The role of scientific in
stitutions in the Soviet Union, even
the prestigious Academy of Sciences,
as agencies of Soviet power politics is
apparent if one reads Soviet sources

with care.
Prof. Robert Byrnes of Indiana, a
member of the board of the Califor
nia Institute of International Studies
which publishes our journal, has
been for many years a key person in
U.S.-Soviet academicexchanges, and
reports by him confirm this eval
uation.

.. .any Soviet
scientist visiting the
United States has
been cleared by the
KCB and is sometimes
simply an agent.

Three facts must be borne in mind.
First, any Soviet scientist visiting the
United States has been cleared by the
KGB and is sometimes simply an
agent. Second, a basic principle of
Soviet operations is to use Vladimir
Lenin's "useful idiots." Many well
meaning American scientists are
being enlisted in international move
ments with humanitarian aims. Soviet
propaganda uses these aims to in
dict the United states, while pro
daiming Soviet dovish innocence.
Third, there is no reciprocity; a par
allel case is the use of American edi
torial pages by Soviet propagandists
without any correspondingaccessto
the Soviet press for Americans.

We may draw the corresponding
morals. If a Soviet scientist visits the
United States, make your disagree
ment with Soviet policies clear. Even
so, you will probably be misquoted.
The Soviet press regularly quotes
American scientists as blaming the
United States for all the woes of the
world. Unfortunately, some do, but
they are certainly a minority.
Do not make statements to the
American press criticizing the Ameri
can government unilaterally. If you
join a humanitarian movement,
don't let yourself be used as one of
LeninV'useful idiots." Useexchange
program leverage to demand exactly
the same conditions from the Soviet
Union. If you are a scientist or a
churchman, realize that you are a
special target of Soviet propaganda. A
recent front-page Pravda story said
that at the request of Pope John Paul
11, Soviet Leader Leonid Brezhnev
had received a delegation of the
Papal Academy of Sciences. He ex
pounded Soviet "peace" plans, and
they expressed their approval. So
now we have Brezhnev blessed by
the Pope! Poland was not even men
tioned, so implicitly the Pope's en
voys showed no concernl Finally,
there is one slogan stupider than "my
country, right or wrong." It is "my
country, always wrong."
