## A 						choice of loyalties 
### 
A recent article on President
Ronald Reagan's draft registration
grace period (Daily, Jan. 15) quotes
Washington psychiatrist Dr. Steven
Pieczinik as saying, "The kids today
don't want to get into anything they
feel is irrelevant to their career lives.
The concepts of ideology and loyalty
are very foreign to them ..."
This statement exemplifies a seri
ous lack of understanding in examin
ing the reaction to draft registration
from today's youths. To say that they
cannot understand the American po
litical and social ideology is a poor
conclusion.
Perhaps it is a foreign idea to peo
ple like Pieczinik that today's young
people may simply choose their loy
alties more critically and question the
standard methods of supporting na
tional ideology. Simply because wars
and drafting have existed hand in
hand in the past should not mean
that the two still offer a proper and
humane option for a mature society.
Should either young or old be
criticized for questioning the im
maturity of war and man's inhumani
ty to man? And if this inhumanity is
presented as the "real world," must
today's youth conform to it? Or
doesn't an end to any disgusting hab
it have to begin somewhere?
