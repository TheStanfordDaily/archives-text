# ASSU approves guest prof MacKinnon
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
After a heated discussion, the ASSU Senate last
night approved the spring quarter guest pro
fessorship of feminist scholar Catherine MacKin
non.
The allocation of a $5000 honorarium for
MacKinnon, who is presently a visiting Law School
professor, barely obtained the two-thirds majority
required for approval.
One senator's claim that a recent student eval
uation within the Law School ranked MacKinnon
"dead last" out of 40 law professors sparked a spir
ited debate over MacKinnon's nomination. Mike
Calabrese, a senator representing the Law School,
said that MacKinnon's feminist subject matter was
probably the cause of her poor ratings..
Calabrese said some law students seeking prac
tical legal experience were dissatisfied with her as a
lecturer, but he said she was "very well-respected"
in the areas of "feminism and social criticism of
America."

Luke Cole, chairman of the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board, stressed that MacKinnon will
not be teaching a law course but a class entitled
"Feminism and/or Socialism." When some sena
tors continued to express concern over MacKin
non's low ratings, Cole pointed out that MacKin
non's service on the faculties of Harvard, Yale, and
Stanford Law Schools should leave "no questions
about her qualifications as 3 teacher."
An initial vote approved MacKinnon's pro
fessorship by a simple majority of eight votes for,
five votes against, and three abstentions. But Rules
Committee Chairman Jim McGrath said MacKin
non's appointment should be legally defined as a
nomination, which requires a two-thirds majority.
In a second vote, 10 senators voted for MacKin
non's apointment with five opposed and one
abstention.
The allocation of $1000 for cartoonist Bill Grif
fith's two day stay here was easily approved. Grif
fith, creator of the San Francisco-based cartoon
strip "Zippy," will visit here in late February.

After the vote, Sen. Bambi Markel said that al
though she supported MacKinnon's nomination,
the voting procedure infuriated her because the
Senate wasn't voting "on full information."
McGrath agreed that the Senate should have post
poned the vote because of "uncertainties regard
ing her (MacKinnon's) qualifications."
In other business, the Senate adopted the Fi
nance Committee's new financial philosophy, the
nominations committee's recommendations for
student representatives on University committees
and the Rules Committee's preliminary reports on
Publications Board by-law reforms. Under these
reforms, all allocations made by the board would
have to go to the Senate for approval. If the Senate
did not act by a specified deadline, the allocations
would automatically go into effect.
The Rules Committee also submitted fee
assessment reform proposals. Senate chairman
Dave Phelps called a special open meeting on the
changes in fee assessment bylaws for next
Wednesday.
