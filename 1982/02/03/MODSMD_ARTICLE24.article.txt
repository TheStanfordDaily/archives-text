## Card trounces No. 8 Fresno State 
### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team, living up to
its lofty national fourth-place ranking, de
feated the Fresno State Bulldogs 4-2 yester
day.
Fresno State was ranked eighth national
ly and Cardinal coach Mark Marquess
knew that the Bulldogs would provide his
team with a good test.
Yesterday's game was the first for the
Bulldogs and the fourth for Stanford. The
Cardinal boosted its record to 4-0 this year.
Marquess was pleased with his team's
performance, especially the pitching of
sophomore Greg Lomnicky.
Lomnicky entered the game in the first
inning with no outs and the bases loaded.
He pitched the Cardinal out of the inning
and went on to throw six and one-third
scoreless innings.
"I was pleased about the game," Mar
quess commented. "Lomnicky did a super
job. He pitched six strong innings."
Marquess also was impressed by the
team's defense and felt the offense was
alsoa little bettertoday. He wasextra quick
to point out a catch made by centerfielder
Darryl Stephens in the fourth inning and
noted that it rivaled anything you would

see in the major leagues.
Lomnicky was the first to agree that the
defense was excellent.
"We have such an outstanding infield
and outfield," Lomnicky said after the
game. "You don't expect to have a ball hit
400 feet and have it caught. It gives us
pitchers confidence."
In the first inning, Stanford starter Doug
Gwaltney had problems, walking the first
three men he faced while throwing only
one strike. Cardinal reliever Lomnicky
came in and pitched Stanford out of the in
ning, striking out two of the three batters
he faced.
In the bottom of the inning, the Cardinal
scored the game's first run when out
fielder Mike Aldretti drove in Loring
Davies on a double to left-center field.
In the top of the second inning, Lom
nicky again showed his coolness.
After loading up the bases, Lomnicky
got the Cardinal out of the inning without
giving up a run.
Stanford went on to score two runs in
the bottom of the inning. The Cardinal
loaded the bases following hits by catcher
Bob Hausladen and catcher Bob DeCosta.
Third-baseman Vince Sakowski hit into a

double play, but Hausladen scored from
third base, giving Stanford a 2-0 lead First
baseman Loring Davies drove in the third
run after reaching first base on an error by
the Bulldogs.
No more scoring took place until the
seventh inning, but Stanford outfielder
Stephens made an incredible catch in the
fourth inning. Bulldog second-baseman
Greg Funk slammed a Lomnicky pitch 400
feet to the fence in center field. It looked
as if the ball was going over the fence but
Stephens made a leaping catch, hitting his
head on a pole but hanging on to the ball.
In the top of the seventh, Cardinal re
liever Mike Sullivan came in for Lomnicky
and pitched the rest of the way.
Cardinal second-baseman Steve Bue
chelle extended Stanford's lead to 4-0
when he drove in Davies in the bottom of
the seventh inning.
Fresno State finally scored in the top of
the eighth inning when pinch hitter Ken
Groth scored on a grounder by catcher
Emery Phillips.
The Bulldogs added another run in the
ninth inning when third-baseman Randy
Asador hit a homerun.
