# Women netters ease by San Jose
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
The Stanford women's tennis
team opened their season with
a convincing 8-1 win over San
Jose State yesterday.
The Cardinal played without
their top three players in coast
ing to the easy win.
"Kate Gompert is in Bak
ersfield playing in a pro tour
nament and I didn't think it was
worthwhile to play the other
two," coach Frank Brennan
said.
Brennan said his top three
singles players — Gompert,
Alycia Moulton and Elise
Burgin — have all beaten each
other in practice so he has not
settled on a lineup.
"We have a lot of girls fight
ing it out," Brennan continued.
"Linda Gates, Michelle Weiss
and Caryn Copeland have all
been playing well and are bat
tling for the last three spots."
Brennan also sees Susie
Jaeger fitting into the line up,
but she was injured in a car ac
cident Sunday night and Bren
nan doesn't know when she'll
be ready.
Copeland, playing No. 1 sin
gles yesterday, lost a three-set
ter — 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 — to Susan
Zaro for the Cardinal's only
loss.
"Caryn had a good match,"
Brennan said. "She found
some of the problems in her
game and she knows what she
has to work on."
Weiss rallied from a 1-5 defi
cit in the first set to win the re
maining games while defeating
Rochelle Morrison 7-5, 6-0 in
No. 2 singles.
"Michelle played well,"
Brennan noted, "she fell be
hind 5-1, but suddenly woke
up and won the rest."
Alison Hardey coasted to 6-2,
6-1 win over Polly Moore, Sue
Rasmussen defeated Aileen
Nishi 6-0, 6-1, Gayle Chan
ripped Bev Davis 6-0, 6-0, and
Susie Barbe defeated Alice
Louie 6-1, 6-1.
"The bottom four matches
were all confidence builders,"
Brennan said. "If the girls had
fallen behind maybe the
matches would have been a lit
tle tougher, but they all took
control. A lot of the matches

were a lot closer than the score
indicated. I'm glad we got
them on the schedule; they
were a good match for us."
In the doubles, Brennan kept
defending AIAW champions
Moulton-Copeland out of ac
tion and played two former na
tional junior champions —
Burgin (1980) and Gates (1981).

"I wanted to play them to
gether to see how they would
do," Brennan said. "They are
both good pure doubles
players, but they are both used
to dominating play —
poaching and covering a lot of
court, so they were running
into each other."
Burgin-Gates defeated Zaro-

Morrison 6-3, 6-1. #
Chan-Hardy smothered
Moore-Nishi 6-1, 6-0 and
Barbe-Weiss shut out Davis-
Louie 6-0, 6-0.
