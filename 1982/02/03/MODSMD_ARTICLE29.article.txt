## Iranian students face money shortages 
### Chitra Subramaniam 
Almost as suddenly as it began, it ended. For 14
months, with increasing anxiety and anger, Ameri
cans were conscious of Iran, as the hostages became
footnotes on television. For 43 days and nights, Iran
was the lead story on all three networks, generally
commanding 22 minutes of news time on evening
news. Even during and after the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan, which was a major event, the networks
led the news with "no break in the hostage crisis.''
Since television could not interview an ideology, or
take pictures of a policy, the overall impression was
that none existed, except perhaps the ravings of
mullahs (religious leaders) and militant students.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's image and presence
took over the media which made him out to be pow
erful, stubborn, and very angry with the United States.
While television continued to portray stereotypes,

News analysis

the newspapers and magazines contributed to the
confusion too. Words like Islam, revolution and mili
tant students became "Islam," "revolution," and
"militant students" — thus alienated and made prob
lematic by the quarantine of quotation marks.
One national newsmagazine which did 10 cover re
ports on the ordeal of the hostages, finally on their re
turn said, "the long ordeal of the helpless American
hostages has been a nineteenth-century affront in
twentieth-century dress, an outrage conjuring up im
ages of the Barbary pirates and impulses that run to
mayhem." And then, it was all over. Within 41
minutes as a new president was being sworn in, the
hostages returned to adulation and cheers.
That was a year ago. While one ordeal ended, an
other, unnoticed by the media, but realnonetheless,
started for the Iranian students in America. From a
state of being one of the many groups of foreign stu
dents in the country, they had become "Iranian stu
dents" — a transition that won them disfavor and em
barassment. "Often I used to come across groups of
non-Iranians having a heated discussion about the

hostage crisis, and it was very difficult to appear disin
terested because one couldn't say anything," said a
student in liberal arts.
"I have tremendous admiration for the Iranian stu
dents at Stanford because even during the worst peri
od in the crisis they conducted themselves with tre
mendous maturity," said Lee Zeigler, director of
Bechtel International Center.
The Iranian students on campus seek refuge in
anonymity. Many of the 89 students presently regis
tered have to now contend with the financial crunch
as the flow of money from Iran fell to a trickle and
then virtually came to a stop.
"The political situation and the currency regu
lations make it very difficult for them, and some of
them are in real trouble," said Marcia Makino, for
eign student advisor.
According to the present financial regualtions, only
students in engineering, medicine and science pro
grams can get money from Iran. The amount is fixed,
totaling $2100 per quarter. Since tuition per quarter
amounts to $2380, many of them have to defer
payment.
But that does not solve the problem because the
procedure for getting money results in all sorts of de
lays, and one student who deferred payment until
January did not receive money on time to pay," said
Makino.
The procedure for the release of funds from Iran is
complicated. When a student applies for money, the
application form has to be accompanied by a
notarized copy of the 1-94 form, a document issued at
the point of entry into the United States.
"This student had to send in the 1-94 for a renewal
and did not have it at the time of applying for funds,
and there was nothing anyone could do," said
Makino. Finally after the student had been to see a
string of people, the problem was resolved.
"The financial situation is critical, and it must be
very hard for the students when things go from one
extreme to another," said Zeigler. "I can see more
problems when the time for them to return (to their
homes) comes, because everything is so uncertain."
One student who returned became Chancellor of
the Central Bank in Iran. Another was executed. For

their part, the students are confused.
"Reports that do come out of Iran are conflicting,
and one doesn't know who to believe," said a student
in engineering.
The Iranian government keeps a close watch on the
students, and the duration of their stay in the United
States vis-a-vis their respective programs. Once that
period expires, visas are not extended.

seek refuge in anonymity. Many
of the 89 students presently
registered have to now contend
with the financial crunch as the
flow of money from Iran fell to a
trickle and then virtually came to a
stop.

But, most of them do want to return. While they are
not politically active in the sense of vigorously sup
porting the various factions within Iran, they are
unanimous in supporting the revolution. While some
feel that Khomeini betrayed his people by assuming
executive powers — something he had said he would
not do — there are many who assert that he is the only
person who could have formed a government.
Said one student, "Khomeini made his mistakes, in
sofar as he did not have any program for the country.
But that is being done now, and this is a critical phase
in the revolution." Others attribute the present con
dition in Iran to the lack of political acumen on the
part of the leaders.
"This is a critical phase for the students too, but I
hope they will collaborate with one another, maybe
culturally, and contribute to a more positive image of
themselves for the benefit of those who are down on
the Iranians," said Zeigler.
