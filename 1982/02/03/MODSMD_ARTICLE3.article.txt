Administration grants aid to El Salvador
Washington — The Reagan administration announced yesterday that
it is sending $55 million in emergency military aid to El Salvador. Assis
tant Secretary of State Thomas Enders told congressmen that to
withhold aid now would mean "probable victory" by the guerrillas.
President Ronald Reagan last week formally certified to Congress an
improvement in human rights in El Salvador and asserted that the mili
tary-civilian junta running the country is achieving more control over
military forces, which frequently are accused of slaying civilians.
Both assertions were required by the Foreign Aid Act, under which
the administration will supply the junta with $26 million in military as
sistance this year. Reagan is sending the additional $55 million from a
Pentagon fund that is unrestricted.
House Democrats sharply criticized Reagan yesterday for certifying
improvement in the human rights record in El Salvador but admitted
they doubt that they can block his new military-aid program for that
country.
They charged that the president's account of declining political kill
ings does not square with reports of independent human rights or
ganizations, which have found continuing high levels of slayings, tor
ture and abductions in El Salvador.
Peppered with questions by Democrats, Enders supported Reagan's
position. He told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that although
slayings continue, "the trend is downwards."
A large force of leftist guerrillas attacked the
Salvadoran government's garrison at the major
provincial capital of Usulutan shortly before
dawn yesterday and sustained the assault for
eight hours before pulling back, witnesses said.
It was the guerrillas' first such daylight assault
on a city of this size. Usulutan, with about 25,000
population, is the fourth largest center in this
nation of 4.7 million.
This attack, and assaults on several smaller
towns to the northeast begun Monday, ap
parently are part of a significant increase in ac
tivity promised by the insurgents in recent
propaganda and public statements. The attacks
may also be intended to test the response
capability of the Salvadoran Army since five of
its vital 14 U.S.-supplied helicopters, as well as at
least 10 other transport aircraft, were blown up
in a guerrilla raid last week.
There was no immediate military comment
on the Usulutan fighting nor an estimate of cas
ualties. Witnesses who traveled there, about 75
miles to the east, did report seeing one dead po
liceman and three wounded soldiers. The
number of guerrilla attackers was not known,
although the intensity of the assault, made with
automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades, indicated a force of substantial size.
Air Florida jet hijacked
Miami — A man who said he was carrying
flammable liquid hijacked an Air Florida jetliner
carrying 77 people yesterday and forced it to fly
to Havana, the Federal Aviation Administration
said.
It was the first successful hijacking in the
United States in more than six months.
FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the hijacked
Boeing 737 was Air Florida Flight 710, which had
left Miami about 2:40 p.m. and was bound for
Key West.
He said the plane landed at Jose Marti airport
in Havana about 3:28 p.m.
Farrar said the aircraft was hijacked by an in
dividual who said he had a bottle containing
flammable liquid.
The plane carried 72 passengers, including
the hijacker, and a crew of 5.
Gerri Cook, a spokeswoman for the FAA in
Atlanta, said the FAA also was awaiting word
from Cuba, via the U.S. State Department, on
when the plane would be allowed to return to
the United States.
The FAA said yesterday's hijacking was the
first successful attempt in the United States
since last July 10,1981, when an Eastern Airlines
jetliner was commandeered and ordered from
Chicago to Havana.
Rock scares Secret Service
Washington — Riot squads assembled, heli
copters hovered, streets were blocked and of
fices searched. But in the end, authorities said it
was just a chunk of cement that nicked the ar
mored limousine of Vice President George

Bush as he rode to the White House yesterday.
Though the initial response centered on
speculation that Bush may have been fired
upon, the police, FBI and Secret Service jointly
concluded late in the day that "there was no as
sault."
Special agent James Boyle of the Secret Ser
vice said FBI laboratory tests had demonstrated
that the object which struck the car and startled
the vice president and his bodyguards was "a
substance consistent with the building materi
als being used in the area."
"We heard a loud bang and drove on to work
and that was it," Bush said later. "There really
wasn't heightened tension even. There wasn't
anything scary about it at all.
The episode occurred at about 7:25 a.m. said
Warner. He said Bush's motorcade speeded up
but did not take evasive action, proceeding to
the White House as planned.
Hundreds of police swarmed into the area.
Special operations officers wearing flak jackets
and carrying rifles with scopes conducted
room-to-room searches of office buiildings and
checked rooftops. A dozen plainclothes of
ficers made a meticulous check of the street
itself, collecting nails, bits of metal and other
items that they thought could be clues. Police
helicopters circled overhead.
"It has been determined that there was no as
sault on the vice presidential limousine."
Budget cuts considered
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger yesterday revealed that President
Ronald Reagan's new defense budget will top
$255 billion, and he took a hard line when mem
bers of the Senate Armed Services Committee
suggested that, given the state of the economy,
this is too much.
Weinberger, according to those who heard
him testify in the closed session, was adamant
that projections of huge government deficits
should not be allowed to derail Reagan's pro
gram to rearm America.
Shortly after taking office, Reagan called for
increasing the amount of money approved for
defense by 7 percent per year after allowing for
inflation. His fiscal 1983 request of more than
$255 billion in budget authority compares with
about $222 billion for this fiscal year, a 15 per
cent increase.
Actual spending is expected to rise even
more, from $182 billion to $215.8 billion in fiscal
1983, or 18 percent.
The open hearing by the Armed Services tac
tical warfare subcommittee will be chaired by
one of the Pentagon's staunchest supporters in
Congress, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz).
Gold water and his allies are prepared to stress
that they favor a strong national defense but will
not tolerate such waste at the Pentagon in this
eraof high unemployment, high deficitsand re
ductions in domestic programs.
However, unless Congress is willing to leave
American forces less ready to fight in the future
than they are now, it will take huge cuts in the
Pentagon accounts the lawmakers deal with to

reduce the federal deficit significantly. The rea
son for this is the length of time it takes to build
a modern weapon such as an aircraft carrier.
Tension predicted for Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Observers say anger over
the Polish government's huge increases in the
price of food and fuel may develop as the im
pact is felt. But for now, martial law appeared to
be keeping the Poles in line.
The biggest price hikes in Poland's postwar
history, ranging from 200 to 400 percent, took
effect Monday after a propaganda campaign of
several weeks to convince the public the gov
ernment can no longer afford the subsidies that
kept prices down.
It was impossible to determine the reaction to
the price hikes in other parts of the country be
cause of a communications blackout on tele
phone service between Polish cities since
martial law was imposed Dec. 13. But no reports
of disturbances filtered into the capital from the
provinces.
The last major attempt to raise food prices in
1980 triggered nationwide strikes that
mushroomed into a movement for economic
and political reform and resulted in legalization
of Solidarity, the first labor union in the Soviet
Bloc free of Communist Party control. Martial
law was imposed 16 months latertobringthe la
bor movement back under the party's control.
Attempts to raise prices in 1970 and 1976 re
sulted in bloody riots, and the government can
celled the increases.
The risk of violence in Poland "will grow by
the hour" unless the martial law government re
laxes its grip, Secretary of State Alexander Haig
predicted yesterday.
"The Polish crisis is far from over," Haig told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his
first Capitol Hill appearance since the Dec. 13
crackdown, which the United States says is Sovi
et-backed.
On Poland, Haig told the committee that
Western unity in opposition to the crackdown
was an "unpleasant surprise" to the Soviet
Union.
Stocks rise slowly
New York — Stocks tried to shake a mixed
start but settled with a slim advance yesterday in
what one analyst called a "market of hesitation"
because of interest-rate concerns.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which plunged 19.41 points Monday, managed
a 0.86-point gain t0852.55. It had been up nearly
5 points with an hour of trading left. Gold was
$379.15 per troy ounce, and silver $8,120 troy

The FAA said yesterday's hijacking was the

Rock scares Secret Service
Washington — Riot squads assembled, heli
copters hovered, streets were blocked and of
fices searched. But in the end, authorities said it
was just a chunk of cement that nicked the ar
mored limousine of Vice President George

Bush as he rode to the White House yesterday.
Though the initial response centered on
speculation that Bush may have been fired
upon, the police, FBI and Secret Service jointly
concluded late in the day that "there was no as
sault."
Special agent James Boyle of the Secret Ser
vice said FBI laboratory tests had demonstrated
that the object which struck the car and startled
the vice president and his bodyguards was "a
substance consistent with the building materi
als being used in the area."
"We heard a loud bang and drove on to work
and that was it," Bush said later. "There really
wasn't heightened tension even. There wasn't
anything scary about it at all.
The episode occurred at about 7:25 a.m. said
Warner. He said Bush's motorcade speeded up
but did not take evasive action, proceeding to
the White House as planned.
Hundreds of police swarmed into the area.
Special operations officers wearing flak jackets
and carrying rifles with scopes conducted
room-to-room searches of office buiildings and
checked rooftops. A dozen plainclothes of
ficers made a meticulous check of the street
itself, collecting nails, bits of metal and other
items that they thought could be clues. Police
helicopters circled overhead.
"It has been determined that there was no as

Budget cuts considered
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger yesterday revealed that President
Ronald Reagan's new defense budget will top
$255 billion, and he took a hard line when mem
bers of the Senate Armed Services Committee
suggested that, given the state of the economy,
this is too much.
Weinberger, according to those who heard
him testify in the closed session, was adamant
that projections of huge government deficits
should not be allowed to derail Reagan's pro
gram to rearm America.
Shortly after taking office, Reagan called for
increasing the amount of money approved for
defense by 7 percent per year after allowing for
inflation. His fiscal 1983 request of more than
$255 billion in budget authority compares with
about $222 billion for this fiscal year, a 15 per
cent increase.
Actual spending is expected to rise even
more, from $182 billion to $215.8 billion in fiscal
1983, or 18 percent.
The open hearing by the Armed Services tac
tical warfare subcommittee will be chaired by
one of the Pentagon's staunchest supporters in
Congress, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz).
Gold water and his allies are prepared to stress
that they favor a strong national defense but will
not tolerate such waste at the Pentagon in this
eraof high unemployment, high deficitsand re
ductions in domestic programs.
However, unless Congress is willing to leave
American forces less ready to fight in the future
than they are now, it will take huge cuts in the
Pentagon accounts the lawmakers deal with to

reduce the federal deficit significantly. The rea
son for this is the length of time it takes to build
a modern weapon such as an aircraft carrier.
Tension predicted for Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Observers say anger over
the Polish government's huge increases in the
price of food and fuel may develop as the im
pact is felt. But for now, martial law appeared to
be keeping the Poles in line.
The biggest price hikes in Poland's postwar
history, ranging from 200 to 400 percent, took
effect Monday after a propaganda campaign of
several weeks to convince the public the gov
ernment can no longer afford the subsidies that
kept prices down.
It was impossible to determine the reaction to
the price hikes in other parts of the country be
cause of a communications blackout on tele
phone service between Polish cities since
martial law was imposed Dec. 13. But no reports
of disturbances filtered into the capital from the
provinces.
The last major attempt to raise food prices in
1980 triggered nationwide strikes that
mushroomed into a movement for economic
and political reform and resulted in legalization
of Solidarity, the first labor union in the Soviet
Bloc free of Communist Party control. Martial
law was imposed 16 months latertobringthe la
bor movement back under the party's control.
Attempts to raise prices in 1970 and 1976 re
sulted in bloody riots, and the government can
celled the increases.
The risk of violence in Poland "will grow by
the hour" unless the martial law government re
laxes its grip, Secretary of State Alexander Haig
predicted yesterday.
"The Polish crisis is far from over," Haig told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his
first Capitol Hill appearance since the Dec. 13
crackdown, which the United States says is Sovi
et-backed.
On Poland, Haig told the committee that
Western unity in opposition to the crackdown
was an "unpleasant surprise" to the Soviet
Union.

Administration grants aid to El Salvador
Washington — The Reagan administration announced yesterday that
it is sending $55 million in emergency military aid to El Salvador. Assis
tant Secretary of State Thomas Enders told congressmen that to
withhold aid now would mean "probable victory" by the guerrillas.
President Ronald Reagan last week formally certified to Congress an
improvement in human rights in El Salvador and asserted that the mili
tary-civilian junta running the country is achieving more control over
military forces, which frequently are accused of slaying civilians.
Both assertions were required by the Foreign Aid Act, under which
the administration will supply the junta with $26 million in military as
sistance this year. Reagan is sending the additional $55 million from a
Pentagon fund that is unrestricted.
House Democrats sharply criticized Reagan yesterday for certifying
improvement in the human rights record in El Salvador but admitted
they doubt that they can block his new military-aid program for that
country.
They charged that the president's account of declining political kill
ings does not square with reports of independent human rights or
ganizations, which have found continuing high levels of slayings, tor
ture and abductions in El Salvador.
Peppered with questions by Democrats, Enders supported Reagan's
position. He told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that although
slayings continue, "the trend is downwards."
A large force of leftist guerrillas attacked the
Salvadoran government's garrison at the major
provincial capital of Usulutan shortly before
dawn yesterday and sustained the assault for
eight hours before pulling back, witnesses said.
It was the guerrillas' first such daylight assault
on a city of this size. Usulutan, with about 25,000
population, is the fourth largest center in this
nation of 4.7 million.
This attack, and assaults on several smaller
towns to the northeast begun Monday, ap
parently are part of a significant increase in ac
tivity promised by the insurgents in recent
propaganda and public statements. The attacks
may also be intended to test the response
capability of the Salvadoran Army since five of
its vital 14 U.S.-supplied helicopters, as well as at
least 10 other transport aircraft, were blown up
in a guerrilla raid last week.
There was no immediate military comment
on the Usulutan fighting nor an estimate of cas
ualties. Witnesses who traveled there, about 75
miles to the east, did report seeing one dead po
liceman and three wounded soldiers. The
number of guerrilla attackers was not known,
although the intensity of the assault, made with
automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades, indicated a force of substantial size.
Air Florida jet hijacked
Miami — A man who said he was carrying
flammable liquid hijacked an Air Florida jetliner
carrying 77 people yesterday and forced it to fly
to Havana, the Federal Aviation Administration
said.
It was the first successful hijacking in the
United States in more than six months.
FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the hijacked
Boeing 737 was Air Florida Flight 710, which had
left Miami about 2:40 p.m. and was bound for
Key West.
He said the plane landed at Jose Marti airport
in Havana about 3:28 p.m.
Farrar said the aircraft was hijacked by an in
dividual who said he had a bottle containing
flammable liquid.
The plane carried 72 passengers, including
the hijacker, and a crew of 5.
Gerri Cook, a spokeswoman for the FAA in
Atlanta, said the FAA also was awaiting word
from Cuba, via the U.S. State Department, on
when the plane would be allowed to return to

Tension predicted for Poland
Warsaw, Poland — Observers say anger over
the Polish government's huge increases in the
price of food and fuel may develop as the im
pact is felt. But for now, martial law appeared to
be keeping the Poles in line.
The biggest price hikes in Poland's postwar
history, ranging from 200 to 400 percent, took
effect Monday after a propaganda campaign of
several weeks to convince the public the gov
ernment can no longer afford the subsidies that
kept prices down.
It was impossible to determine the reaction to
the price hikes in other parts of the country be
cause of a communications blackout on tele
phone service between Polish cities since
martial law was imposed Dec. 13. But no reports
of disturbances filtered into the capital from the
provinces.
The last major attempt to raise food prices in
1980 triggered nationwide strikes that
mushroomed into a movement for economic
and political reform and resulted in legalization
of Solidarity, the first labor union in the Soviet
Bloc free of Communist Party control. Martial
law was imposed 16 months latertobringthe la
bor movement back under the party's control.
Attempts to raise prices in 1970 and 1976 re
sulted in bloody riots, and the government can
celled the increases.
The risk of violence in Poland "will grow by
the hour" unless the martial law government re
laxes its grip, Secretary of State Alexander Haig
predicted yesterday.
"The Polish crisis is far from over," Haig told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in his
first Capitol Hill appearance since the Dec. 13
crackdown, which the United States says is Sovi
et-backed.
On Poland, Haig told the committee that
Western unity in opposition to the crackdown
was an "unpleasant surprise" to the Soviet
Union.

Administration grants aid to El Salvador
Washington — The Reagan administration announced yesterday that
it is sending $55 million in emergency military aid to El Salvador. Assis
tant Secretary of State Thomas Enders told congressmen that to
withhold aid now would mean "probable victory" by the guerrillas.
President Ronald Reagan last week formally certified to Congress an
improvement in human rights in El Salvador and asserted that the mili
tary-civilian junta running the country is achieving more control over
military forces, which frequently are accused of slaying civilians.
Both assertions were required by the Foreign Aid Act, under which
the administration will supply the junta with $26 million in military as
sistance this year. Reagan is sending the additional $55 million from a
Pentagon fund that is unrestricted.
House Democrats sharply criticized Reagan yesterday for certifying
improvement in the human rights record in El Salvador but admitted
they doubt that they can block his new military-aid program for that
country.
They charged that the president's account of declining political kill
ings does not square with reports of independent human rights or
ganizations, which have found continuing high levels of slayings, tor
ture and abductions in El Salvador.
Peppered with questions by Democrats, Enders supported Reagan's
position. He told a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that although
slayings continue, "the trend is downwards."
A large force of leftist guerrillas attacked the
Salvadoran government's garrison at the major
provincial capital of Usulutan shortly before
dawn yesterday and sustained the assault for
eight hours before pulling back, witnesses said.
It was the guerrillas' first such daylight assault
on a city of this size. Usulutan, with about 25,000
population, is the fourth largest center in this
nation of 4.7 million.
This attack, and assaults on several smaller
towns to the northeast begun Monday, ap
parently are part of a significant increase in ac
tivity promised by the insurgents in recent
propaganda and public statements. The attacks
may also be intended to test the response
capability of the Salvadoran Army since five of
its vital 14 U.S.-supplied helicopters, as well as at
least 10 other transport aircraft, were blown up
in a guerrilla raid last week.
There was no immediate military comment
on the Usulutan fighting nor an estimate of cas
ualties. Witnesses who traveled there, about 75
miles to the east, did report seeing one dead po
liceman and three wounded soldiers. The
number of guerrilla attackers was not known,
although the intensity of the assault, made with
automatic rifles and rocket-propelled
grenades, indicated a force of substantial size.
Air Florida jet hijacked
Miami — A man who said he was carrying
flammable liquid hijacked an Air Florida jetliner
carrying 77 people yesterday and forced it to fly
to Havana, the Federal Aviation Administration
said.
It was the first successful hijacking in the
United States in more than six months.
FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said the hijacked
Boeing 737 was Air Florida Flight 710, which had
left Miami about 2:40 p.m. and was bound for
Key West.
He said the plane landed at Jose Marti airport
in Havana about 3:28 p.m.
Farrar said the aircraft was hijacked by an in
dividual who said he had a bottle containing
flammable liquid.
The plane carried 72 passengers, including
the hijacker, and a crew of 5.
Gerri Cook, a spokeswoman for the FAA in
Atlanta, said the FAA also was awaiting word
from Cuba, via the U.S. State Department, on
when the plane would be allowed to return to
the United States.
The FAA said yesterday's hijacking was the
first successful attempt in the United States
since last July 10,1981, when an Eastern Airlines
jetliner was commandeered and ordered from
Chicago to Havana.
Rock scares Secret Service
Washington — Riot squads assembled, heli
copters hovered, streets were blocked and of
fices searched. But in the end, authorities said it
was just a chunk of cement that nicked the ar
mored limousine of Vice President George

Bush as he rode to the White House yesterday.
Though the initial response centered on
speculation that Bush may have been fired
upon, the police, FBI and Secret Service jointly
concluded late in the day that "there was no as
sault."
Special agent James Boyle of the Secret Ser
vice said FBI laboratory tests had demonstrated
that the object which struck the car and startled
the vice president and his bodyguards was "a
substance consistent with the building materi
als being used in the area."
"We heard a loud bang and drove on to work
and that was it," Bush said later. "There really
wasn't heightened tension even. There wasn't
anything scary about it at all.
The episode occurred at about 7:25 a.m. said
Warner. He said Bush's motorcade speeded up
but did not take evasive action, proceeding to
the White House as planned.
Hundreds of police swarmed into the area.
Special operations officers wearing flak jackets
and carrying rifles with scopes conducted
room-to-room searches of office buiildings and
checked rooftops. A dozen plainclothes of
ficers made a meticulous check of the street
itself, collecting nails, bits of metal and other
items that they thought could be clues. Police
helicopters circled overhead.
"It has been determined that there was no as
sault on the vice presidential limousine."
Budget cuts considered
Washington — Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger yesterday revealed that President
Ronald Reagan's new defense budget will top
$255 billion, and he took a hard line when mem
bers of the Senate Armed Services Committee
suggested that, given the state of the economy,
this is too much.
Weinberger, according to those who heard
him testify in the closed session, was adamant
that projections of huge government deficits
should not be allowed to derail Reagan's pro
gram to rearm America.
Shortly after taking office, Reagan called for
increasing the amount of money approved for
defense by 7 percent per year after allowing for
inflation. His fiscal 1983 request of more than
$255 billion in budget authority compares with
about $222 billion for this fiscal year, a 15 per
cent increase.
Actual spending is expected to rise even
more, from $182 billion to $215.8 billion in fiscal
1983, or 18 percent.
The open hearing by the Armed Services tac
tical warfare subcommittee will be chaired by
one of the Pentagon's staunchest supporters in
Congress, Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz).
Gold water and his allies are prepared to stress
that they favor a strong national defense but will
not tolerate such waste at the Pentagon in this
eraof high unemployment, high deficitsand re
ductions in domestic programs.
However, unless Congress is willing to leave
American forces less ready to fight in the future
than they are now, it will take huge cuts in the
Pentagon accounts the lawmakers deal with to

reduce the federal deficit significantly. The rea
son for this is the length of time it takes to build
a modern weapon such as an aircraft carrier.
