Mission, Kan. (AP) — Thirty-nine schools, in
cluding all Ivy League members but Yale, have
been reclassified to Division l-AA in football
competition, the NCAA announced Tuesday.
The action, the result of a decision at a special
NCAA convention in December, reduces the
number of major, or Division l-A, schools from
137 to 92 and increases the number of Division l-
AA schools to 89.
Those numbers could change because the
classification of six schools that had been classi
fied l-A is still undetermined pending further
NCAA study.
Among those dropped from Division l-A to
Division l-AA were all Southern Conference
schools, five of the six Southland Conference
members, all but two of the 10 Mid-American
Conference schools, five of the eight Missouri
Valley Conference members and three of the six
Pacific Coast Athletic Association schools.
The reclassification, effective Sept. 1, will
force some schools that are still classified
Division l-A but are members of a Division l-AA
league to make a decision, said Dave Cawood,
an NCAA spokesman.
Those schools — such as Yale, Wichita State,
Central Michigan — must drop to Division l-AA
if they want to continue in their conferences, or

become independents if they want to play as
Division l-A members, he said.
Cawood said the schools that moved down to
Division l-AA failed to meet three criteria for
Division l-A membership:
—Sponsor at least eight varsity sports, includ
ing football.
—Play at least 60 percent of their games
against Division l-A members.
—Have averaged more than 17,000 paid atten
dance at home games for the past four years, or
play in a stadium that contains at least 30,000
seats and have averaged 17,000 paid home atten
dance for at least one of the past four years.
Cawood said there were two notable excep
tions.
A school may stay in Division l-A, despite fail
ing to meet the above criteria if it is in a con
ference in which at least six teams play football
and more than half meet the Division l-A
criteria.
If a school fails to meet the third criteria, it may
remain in Division l-A if it has averaged 20,000
paid attendance inallgamesforafour-yearperi
od, with at least four home games a year.
The Division l-A members must continue to
meet the criteria every year if they are to remain
in that group, Cawood said.
