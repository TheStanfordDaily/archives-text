# Gilbert returns charges of LA Times reporters
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles â€” A Los Angeles
Times sportswriter, responding
to an inquiry by UCLA booster
Sam Gilbert, said yesterday that
he has a $15,000 loan from a
firm owned in part by Jerry
Buss, owner of the Lakers and
Kings.
Gilbert, subject of a recent
series of articles in The Times
on his role in UCLA's penalties
by the NCAA, made the follow
ing inquiry in various Los An
geles media:
"I have a question for the Los
Angeles Times. Dear Sports
Editor. Is it true that one of your
sports writers covering a major
team borrowed $50,000 from
the owner of that team in
which to acquire a home? If
this is true, shouldn't this be
published? Would this then in
dicate that your writers are
buyable? Is it also true that the
same writer plagiarized an arti
cle, published it and received

some sort of censure from you?
I believe in the true sense of
journalism that the public has a
right to know. This is the argu
ment you used about me. I
think that is a fair question. I
heard on the air that this did
occur."
The sportswriter, Ted Green,
said that he took the loan in
1977 as a third trust deed on a
home purchase. That was two
years before Buss owned either
the Lakers or the Kings. Buss
did own the Los Angeles
Strings in the World Team Ten
nis League at that time and
Green wrote an occasional
story about the Strings prior to
his loan acquisition.
Green said that, in acquiring
the loan from Mariani-Buss As
sociates, a real estate invest
ment firm, he never dealt with
Buss. Green said he did not
think Buss even knew about
the loan. However, Bob
Steiner, director of public rela

tions for The Forum, where the
Lakers and Kings play, said yes
terday that Buss has "kind of a
vague awareness of the loan."
Green said that he paid 10
percent interest on the loan
when he took it out in 1977 and
his interest has escalated to 15
percent. He said the loan will
be paid off in September.
Los Angeles Times Sports
Editor Bill Dwyre said that Gil
bert's accusation that the same
sportswriter (Green) was sus
pended for plagiarism several
months ago was incorrect.
Dwyre said that he had sus
pended a Times sportswriter
for a week without pay for fail
ure to properly attribute mate
rial in a story, but that the
sportswriter was not Green.
Dwyre said that Mike Littwin
and Alan Greenberg, writers of
the stories on Gilbert, were not
involved in either the loan or
the suspension.
