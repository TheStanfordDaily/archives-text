Onceagain, Stanford's wom
ens basketball team walked
away from their opponents,
this time defeating the Univer
sity of San Francisco Lady Dons
78-56 in Maples Pavillion last
night, despite the absence of
high scoring forwards Kim
Kupferer and Louise Smith.
Stanford had a formidable
opponent in USF's 6-4 center
Lisa Walsh. Walsh is a left
hander, and head coach Dotty
McCrea instructed her team to
force Walsh to shoot from her
weak side.
Stanford freshman forward
Mary Bradach scored a game
high 19 points and defended
Walsh well. Walsh was con
tained easily and prsented no
problems to the Cardinal.
The first half was played
slowly, and twice the Lady
Dons threatened to take the
lead. However the Cardinal
jumped to a 10 point lead early
in the second half.
"We woke up," MtCrea said
about the second half. "We

have to play on our level and
not lower ourselves to the the
other team."
The guards played a key part
in last night's teamwork.
McCrea commented on the
play of the guards. "They've
gotten the ball to the people
who have scored the points."
Sophmore guard Lee Anne
Margerum scored ten points
and played well defensively.
She attributed much of her
success to the quickly paced
second half. "I play better
when we fast break," she said.
"My confidence is coming
up."
This is Stanford's third win in
the past four games, boosting
their record to 14-6 with six
games left to play. The Card
also stands at 4-2 in the
Northern California Athletic
Conference.
Stanford travels to Berkeley
next Tuesday. This is the sec
ond showdown with the rival
California team, after losing to
them at home two-and-a-half
weeks ago.
