And Stanford people
thought they had mascot prob
lems.
It seems Arizona State fans
are so caught up with their
nickname they can hardly utter
a sentence without mentioning
it.
The publicadressannouncer
told the crowd at a ASU-alum
ni baseball game Saturday,
"We thank Sun Devil fan Gene
Rander of the Sun Devil club
for hiscontributiontoSun Dev
il athletics in the opening of
our new Sun Devil clubhouse
here in Sun Devil Country."
If that's palatable, you can
stop after the game for a Devil
Burger and Fries at the Devil
House — which is not to be
confused with a McDevil
Burger. That's what you win if
you hold the "Lucky Devil
Number in our Lucky Devil
Giveaway.
Now don't all you Stanford
fans wish you had a more clev
er mascot?

in better shape than we were."

former national team players
Mickey Ording and Kip Ox
