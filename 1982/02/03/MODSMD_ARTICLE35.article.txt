# Environmentalist talks on water issues

### Tim Lundergan 
In 1978, Friends of the River (FOR)
founder Mark Dubois gained na
tional notoriety by hiding in
Stanislaus Canyon and chaining
himself to a rock in order to prevent
authorities from flooding the
Stanislaus River behind the New
Melones dam.
Last night, Dubois said, "we all
have to start learning to work togeth
er... there are not a whole lot of bad
guys" setting public water policy.
Dubois spoke in support of FOR's
attempt to place a Water Resources
initiative petition on California's No
vember ballot, saying it would help
solve the important but "dry prob
lem" of water usage.
California agriculture uses 85 per
cent of the state's water, Dubois said.
Water has helped make California
the nation's richest state and the
world's eighth largest economy.
However, diverting it from natural
streams exacts costs beyond those as
sociated with building dams.
Ninety-five percent of the
salmon's natural spawning grounds

have been wiped out through dam
construction, Dubois said. This con
struction destroyed a once
flourishing salmon fishing industry.
Pumping out groundwater faster
than it can be replenished hascaused
some farmland to sink as much as 30
feet, he said.
Many of these dams were built ac
cording to the conventional wisdom
of their day, which viewed dams as
promoting both construction jobs
and agriculture. However, Dubois
said, this construction had unin
tended side-effects.
Dubois also criticized the unequal
pricing of California water. He said
that while agriculture uses 64 percent
of the state's water, urban users pay
74 percent of the cost.
While farmers in the Central Valley
pay as little as 53.50 for an acre-foot of
water (an acre-foot is the amount of
water which will coveran acre of land
to the depth of one foot), Southern
California consumers pay $120 an
acre-foot, while some farmers near
San Diego spend as much as $420.
The inequity results because some

users are not required to pay the ac
tual cost of producing new water
supplies, Dubois said. The New
Melones dam, for example, puts the
Federal government $78,000 in debt
each day, Dubois said, but lobbyists

for some agricultural groups have
prevented even Interior Secretary
James Watt from raising prices.
The environmentalist said 1300
large dams have been built on Cali
fornia's 80 major waterways. As a re
sult, new dams must be both larger
and less cost-effective in producing
water. Dubois said that he advocates
refusing to allow dams to be filled un
til the Federal government can prove
there is a need for that water. He said
that President Ronald Reagan fa
vored this state's rights position while
governor here in 1973.
Dubois expressed a hope environ
mentalists will work together with
the Army Corps of Engineers, various
area water boards, and agricultur
alists. He said past disputes have
caused these groups to become sus
picious of each other.
The Water Resource initiative calls
for water conservation by encourag
ing users to pay the full price of pro
duction, limitations on water being
diverted from its natural streams, and
protection of groundwater in areas
where it is being severely depleted.
