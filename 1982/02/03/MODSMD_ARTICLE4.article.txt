### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Stanford juniors Doug Dietrich
and Megan Chesnut, noted activist
Daniel Ellsberg and 122 others ar
rested Monday for blockading the
entrance gates to the Lawrence Liver
more National Laboratories (LLNL) in
protest of "nuclear madness"
last night pleaded no contest
accepted a sentence ordering them
to complete seven days of voluntary
service.
John Lewis, Livermore and Pleas
anton municipal court justice, who
directed the mass arraignment, of
fered the protesters three options:
seven days of volunteer work, 10 days
in jail, or a $210 fine.
According to Bob Cooper, media
liaison for the Livermore Action
Group, 125 pleaded "no contest"
and accepted the voluntary service.
Twenty-nine others, who also
pleaded "no contest," accepted jail
sentences of 10 days. Cooper said
they are expected to be released on
good behavior by Sunday, Feb. 7.
Five protesters "cited out" and de
layed their arraignments until Feb. 16
while three others, who pleaded not
guilty, spent last night in jail and face
bail hearings today.

Chesnut said she was "really
thankful that the judge gave that (the
option of voluntary service) to us as
an alternative" because she felt that
she could do the most good by serv
ing the community. She said that
those who elected to stay in jail felt
that the voluntary service option was
a "middle class alternative" and
wanted to serve the sentence in soli
darity with others.
Dietrich said he felt that communi
ty service was the best thing to do to
change the system. "I was willing to
sit in there for 10 months ," he said,
"but this wasn't the best time to make
a statement."
"Community service was a better
alternative for us because more peo
ple will protest next time," Dietrich
said.
The maximum sentence for the
misdemeanor offense of "obstruct
ing a thoroughfare," the charge
levied against most of the demon
strators, is a $500 fine and/or six
months in jail.
"They (the negotiators) were very
happy with (the outcome)," said Kel
ly Dunn, a Boalt Law School student
who served as a media liaison for the
Legal Action Team of the Livermore
