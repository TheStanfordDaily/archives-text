# CIA admits it solicits data from faculty
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
A spokesman for the Central In
telligence Agency (CIA) in Washing
ton, D.C. said yesterday that while
CIA recruitment of university faculty
members is "very normal," he could
not confirm specific instances in
which professors assisted agents
here.
Responding to comments made
Friday by a professor here, CIA
spokesman Dale Peterson told the
Peninsula Times Tribune, "There are
thousands of Americans providing
the CIA with information about ac
tivities going on abroad, and these
include academicians, business peo
ple and others at all levels of life."
Peterson confirmed that the CIA
solicits information from faculty
members who travel abroad for sci
entific meetings or other purposes.
"The agency has a responsibility to
do it (approach people for informa
tion)," said Peterson, "and we do that
at virtually every university around
the United States."

Bernard Roth said yesterday,
"Basically, they corroborated some
of the things I was saying," referring
to a speech he gave last week before
a Protest and Survive study group, an
informal political discussion group
here.
In that speech, Roth voiced con
cern about recruitment of students
and faculty members by domestic in
telligence agencies to assist in the
identification of key campus figures
and to utilize their special access to
information when traveling abroad.
He said that the University allowed
an opportunity to pass in 1978 when
schools across the country (most
notably Harvard University) estab
lished guidelines for faculty mem
bers dealing with agents on their
campuses.
"Our policy has always been that
it's up to the faculty members on
what they're doing outside of their
academic activities with the Univer
sity," said Gerald Lieberman, vice
provost and dean of graduate studies
and research.
"As Dr. Lyman (former University
President Richard) was quoted, 'It's

one thing to have a nice set of prin
ciples; it's another thing to enforce
them,'" said Lieberman.
When asked whether the faculty
senate should consider adopting a
set of guidelines for professors ap
proached by intelligence agents,
Senate Chairman David Abernethy,
professor of political science, said,
"It's very hard to legislate about
something whose scope you're not
even sure about."
Abernethy said that great caution
would be needed in writing such a
document to avoid restricting the
"freedom of association" of faculty
members.
"I think we have to move very
carefully, if at all, in the direction of
written guidelines," said Abernethy.
Lieberman said that University pol
icies which prohibit faculty members
from engaging in any form of covert
research already exist.
"Current policies require that ev
erybody reveal their sources of re
search support," said Lieberman.
"We object to anyone receiving cov
ert CIA support knowingly. That

would be in violation of a Stanford
policy."
According to the Faculty Hand
book, research projects funded by
sources outside of the University
must be submitted to the Sponsored
Projects Office for review on the
basis of considerations such as
educational component, commit
ment of time and secrecy.
The policy on secrecy states that
"the proposal must not . . . violate
the guidelines adopted by the Aca
demic Senate . . . Under no circum
stances will the University accept
projects which violate these
guidelines."
Among the guidelines set by the
Academic Senate are a statement on
the principle of openness in re
search, definitions of secrecy in re
search and a set of rules. Included
among these rules are: "3.a. No re
search on a thesis or dissertation
should be undertaken if, at the time
the topic is set, there is any substan
tial possibility that it will be to a secret
thesis or dissertation."
In early 1978, members of the Uni
versity community debated whether
to develop a set of guidelines similar
to those recently adopted by Harvard
University. The Harvard guidelines
stated that any member of the
Harvard community:
•should report any private consult
ing agreement with the CIA to the
dean or the president of the Univer
sity;
• should not undertake in
telligence operations for the CIA or
assist it in obtaining the unwitting
services of any other member of the
Harvard community; and
• if acting as a CIA recruiter, should
report that fact to the dean and presi
dent, and should not supply any
name to the CIA without the consent
of the individual concerned.

When asked yesterday whether he
was aware of any instances in which
intelligence agents have approached
faculty members here, President
Donald Kennedy said, "I don't have
any knowledge of any such thing.
There have been no charges here."
Neither Lieberman nor Abernethy
said that they had heard of any facul
ty members contacted by in
telligence agents.
"At Harvard they apparently had a
problem, and the faculty responded
to it," said Kennedy. "Professor Roth
has not brought any charges to my at
tention."
"I just hope to create a climate,"
said Roth, "where someone might
come up and talk. And I think that's
what it is, to somehow get a dis
cussion group going or something.
"But if no one looks at it, and no
one talks about it. . .

do it (approach people for informa
tion)," said Peterson, "and we do that
at virtually every university around
the United States."
Mechanical Engineering Prof.

Bernard Roth said yesterday,
"Basically, they corroborated some
of the things I was saying," referring
to a speech he gave last week before
a Protest and Survive study group, an
informal political discussion group
here.
In that speech, Roth voiced con
cern about recruitment of students
and faculty members by domestic in
telligence agencies to assist in the
identification of key campus figures
and to utilize their special access to
information when traveling abroad.
He said that the University allowed
an opportunity to pass in 1978 when
schools across the country (most
notably Harvard University) estab
lished guidelines for faculty mem
bers dealing with agents on their
campuses.
"Our policy has always been that
it's up to the faculty members on
what they're doing outside of their
academic activities with the Univer
sity," said Gerald Lieberman, vice
provost and dean of graduate studies
and research.
"As Dr. Lyman (former University
President Richard) was quoted, 'It's

one thing to have a nice set of prin
ciples; it's another thing to enforce
them,'" said Lieberman.
When asked whether the faculty
senate should consider adopting a
set of guidelines for professors ap
proached by intelligence agents,
Senate Chairman David Abernethy,
professor of political science, said,
"It's very hard to legislate about
something whose scope you're not
even sure about."
Abernethy said that great caution
would be needed in writing such a
document to avoid restricting the
"freedom of association" of faculty
members.
"I think we have to move very
carefully, if at all, in the direction of
written guidelines," said Abernethy.
Lieberman said that University pol
icies which prohibit faculty members
from engaging in any form of covert
research already exist.
"Current policies require that ev
erybody reveal their sources of re
search support," said Lieberman.
"We object to anyone receiving cov
ert CIA support knowingly. That

would be in violation of a Stanford
policy."
According to the Faculty Hand
book, research projects funded by
sources outside of the University
must be submitted to the Sponsored
Projects Office for review on the
basis of considerations such as
educational component, commit
ment of time and secrecy.
The policy on secrecy states that
"the proposal must not . . . violate
the guidelines adopted by the Aca
demic Senate . . . Under no circum
stances will the University accept
projects which violate these
guidelines."
Among the guidelines set by the
Academic Senate are a statement on
the principle of openness in re
search, definitions of secrecy in re
search and a set of rules. Included
among these rules are: "3.a. No re
search on a thesis or dissertation
should be undertaken if, at the time
the topic is set, there is any substan
tial possibility that it will be to a secret
thesis or dissertation."
In early 1978, members of the Uni
versity community debated whether
to develop a set of guidelines similar
to those recently adopted by Harvard
University. The Harvard guidelines
stated that any member of the
Harvard community:
•should report any private consult
ing agreement with the CIA to the
dean or the president of the Univer
sity;
• should not undertake in
telligence operations for the CIA or
assist it in obtaining the unwitting
services of any other member of the
Harvard community; and
• if acting as a CIA recruiter, should
report that fact to the dean and presi
dent, and should not supply any
name to the CIA without the consent
of the individual concerned.

When asked yesterday whether he
was aware of any instances in which
intelligence agents have approached
faculty members here, President
Donald Kennedy said, "I don't have
any knowledge of any such thing.
There have been no charges here."
Neither Lieberman nor Abernethy
said that they had heard of any facul
ty members contacted by in
telligence agents.
"At Harvard they apparently had a
problem, and the faculty responded
to it," said Kennedy. "Professor Roth
has not brought any charges to my at
tention."
"I just hope to create a climate,"
said Roth, "where someone might
come up and talk. And I think that's
what it is, to somehow get a dis
cussion group going or something.
"But if no one looks at it, and no
one talks about it. . .
A spokesman for the Central In
telligence Agency (CIA) in Washing
ton, D.C. said yesterday that while
CIA recruitment of university faculty
members is "very normal," he could
not confirm specific instances in
which professors assisted agents
here.
Responding to comments made
Friday by a professor here, CIA
spokesman Dale Peterson told the
Peninsula Times Tribune, "There are
thousands of Americans providing
the CIA with information about ac
tivities going on abroad, and these
include academicians, business peo
ple and others at all levels of life."
Peterson confirmed that the CIA
solicits information from faculty
members who travel abroad for sci
entific meetings or other purposes.
"The agency has a responsibility to
do it (approach people for informa
tion)," said Peterson, "and we do that
at virtually every university around
