# DA won't file charges in stolen couch case
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
The Palo Alto district attorney's of
fice has declined to file charges of
possession of stolen property against
members of the Delta Upsilon (DU)
fraternity at this time.
Fraternity members faced possible
prosecution for possession of more
than $5000 in furniture allegedly sto
len from the Law School and other
University departments, said Stan
ford Police Chief Marvin Herrington
yesterday.
"The district attorney has total au
thority. He would not file complaints
on what we have at this time ... It
(the evidence) just wasn't conclusive
enough for him," Herrington said.
However, he said, the case will re
main open pending further in
vestigation.
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer said the district attorney's
office is strictly interpreting pro
visions of the penal code because
successful prosecution requires
proof beyond a reasonable doubt
that individuals "knowingly" possess
stolen property.
Niemeyer said the DA is "following
the letter of the law and he has to do
it that way." "But," he added, "We
feel we had an adequate case based

on logic and common sense."
Maintenance workers, thinking
they might have found furniture re
ported missing from the Law School
since October, notified Stanford po
lice, who entered the fraternity with
a search warrant last Dec. 30.
Officers confiscated tables, chairs,
sofas, and other office furniture from
21 members' rooms. Police also re
moved small amounts of marijuana
and hashish from two rooms.
Herrington said because so many
fraternity members are involved in
the case, police have been unable to
prove exactly who knewthe property
was stolen. "No one disputes the
furniture was stolen, but we need to
prove specifically who stole it,"he
said.
"We tried to cooperate (with the
police) as much as possible as a t
group. . .Many guys went in to talk to
police on their own volition," said
Wayne McKay, DU president.
Because the case remains open,
Palo Alto's Supervisory District At
torney Randy Hey declined to com
ment.
Niemeyer said his officers will con
tinue their investigation and have
several leads, but have so far had dif
ficulty in locating possibile sources of
information.
