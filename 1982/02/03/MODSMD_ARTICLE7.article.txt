Monterey â€” If the California Sen

Barry Goldwater, Jr. (R-Woodland
Hills) would capture the Republican
nomination, according to a Field Poll
conducted last November.
Goldwater is far ahead of his
nearest challengers: accordingtothe
poll he holds 29 percent of voters'
support, followed by San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson with 16 percent
and Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) with 13 percent.
Goldwater, a self-avowed conser

vative, is the son of prominent Arizo
na Sen. Barry Goldwater, Sr. He has
represented his district, which in
cludes northwestern Los Angeles

County and southern Ventura Coun
ty, since 1969.
The 43-year-old congressman is
particularly proud of two things: his
family name and his country. These
elements are at the crux of his cam
paign.
"I'm not trading off on my name,"
Goldwater said during last week
