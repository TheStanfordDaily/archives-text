publican nomination for United
States Senate. The interviews were
conducted in Monterey at the Cali

weekend. None of the articles in this
series represent Daily endorsements.

Wilson will appear tomorrow.
Monterey — If the California Sen
ate primary were held today, Rep.
Barry Goldwater, Jr. (R-Woodland
Hills) would capture the Republican
nomination, according to a Field Poll
conducted last November.
Goldwater is far ahead of his
nearest challengers: accordingtothe
poll he holds 29 percent of voters'
support, followed by San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson with 16 percent
and Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park) with 13 percent.
Goldwater, a self-avowed conser

vative, is the son of prominent Arizo
na Sen. Barry Goldwater, Sr. He has
represented his district, which in
cludes northwestern Los Angeles

County and southern Ventura Coun
ty, since 1969.
The 43-year-old congressman is
particularly proud of two things: his
family name and his country. These
elements are at the crux of his cam
paign.
"I'm not trading off on my name,"
Goldwater said during last week

end's California Republican Conven
tion in Monterey. "I take no back
seat to my father. I have 12 years in
Congress which speaks for itself."
Goldwater is fond of telling family
stories, particularly ones about how
well-established the Goldwater
name was before his father gained
prominence. The tall, sun-tanned
congressman told how his great
grandfather came to the United
States from Poland in 1853, settling in
Sonora, California. "It was a good
name before Barry Goldwater, Sr.
was a twinkle in my grandfather's
eye," he said.
Politically, Goldwater has a back
to-basics approach to many issues.
He supports cuts in the national So
cial Security program, saying it is "a
burden on the working people" and
that it has become "basically a wel
fare program."
Goldwater is critical of several key
issues presently under discussion in
Congress. He opposes the Equal
Rights Amendment, for which he
voted 10 years ago, and disapproves
of the human rights policies estab
lished by former President Jimmy
Carter. Hesaid American foreign pol
icy has become inconsistent because
the United States "has stabbed our
friends — Argentina, Chile, others
who have traditionally been our al
lies — in the back and rewarded our
enemies."
During his campaign, Goldwater
often comes under fire for his ten
dency to stumble over words while
speaking, his poor Congressional
voting record during his Senate cam
paign and the manner in which he
has obtained campaign funds.
A financial statement, released at
the convention, claimed that Gold
water has raised more than $950,000
toward his Senate campaign. He said
that he received about 50 percent of
his funds through solicitations which
his father had sent.

Sen. Goldwater sent his appeal for
financial support and political en
dorsements to one million people
throughout the nation. It portrayed
the Senate contest as a battle be
tween Goldwater Jr. and Gov. Jerry
Brown, who is expected to announce
his Senate candidacy shortly.
Another fund-raising letter,
mailed by Goldwater Jr. last Decem
ber, included a birthday card which
Goldwater asked recipients to send
to his father. It praised Goldwater Sr.
and continued, ". . . he is giving his
all on behalf of my campaign to join
him in the Senate before he retires
"Don't forget to sign and return
the enclosed birthday card to my
dad. It will mean so very much to
him. And, if it is at all possible, please
send me a contribution so I can de
feat Jerry Brown and become the
next United States senator from Cali
fornia . . .
Goldwater offered no comment
when reporters at the convention
questioned him about the ethics of
his fund-raising methods.
At the Monterey convention,
Goldwater betrayed no sign of the
jumbled syntax and seeming in
articulateness for which he frequent
ly receives criticism.
Earlier, though, Senate candidate
Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Santa
Monica) said if Goldwater won the
Republican primary nomination and
were to debate Brown, the Senate
race would be over. "This race will be
determined by debates," Dornan
said. "Goldwater is a poor debater.
The race against Brown would be
over in the first 15 minutes."
"I may not be a loud and
boisterous speaker," Goldwater re
sponded, "but I am effective in the
causes I espouse."
Because Goldwater spends so
much time in California campaign
ing, his 58 percent voting record in
the past year is comparatively low.
"It's difficult to be in two places at the
same time," he said. "I haven't
missed the significant votes."

elements are at the crux of his cam
paign.
"I'm not trading off on my name,"
Goldwater said during last week

end's California Republican Conven
tion in Monterey. "I take no back
seat to my father. I have 12 years in
Congress which speaks for itself."
Goldwater is fond of telling family
stories, particularly ones about how
well-established the Goldwater
name was before his father gained
prominence. The tall, sun-tanned
congressman told how his great
grandfather came to the United
States from Poland in 1853, settling in
Sonora, California. "It was a good
name before Barry Goldwater, Sr.
was a twinkle in my grandfather's
eye," he said.
Politically, Goldwater has a back
to-basics approach to many issues.
He supports cuts in the national So
cial Security program, saying it is "a
burden on the working people" and
that it has become "basically a wel
fare program."
Goldwater is critical of several key
issues presently under discussion in
Congress. He opposes the Equal
Rights Amendment, for which he
voted 10 years ago, and disapproves
of the human rights policies estab
lished by former President Jimmy
Carter. Hesaid American foreign pol
icy has become inconsistent because
the United States "has stabbed our
friends — Argentina, Chile, others
who have traditionally been our al
lies — in the back and rewarded our
enemies."
During his campaign, Goldwater
often comes under fire for his ten
dency to stumble over words while
speaking, his poor Congressional
voting record during his Senate cam
paign and the manner in which he
has obtained campaign funds.
A financial statement, released at
the convention, claimed that Gold
water has raised more than $950,000
toward his Senate campaign. He said
that he received about 50 percent of
his funds through solicitations which
his father had sent.

Sen. Goldwater sent his appeal for
financial support and political en
dorsements to one million people
throughout the nation. It portrayed
the Senate contest as a battle be
tween Goldwater Jr. and Gov. Jerry
Brown, who is expected to announce
his Senate candidacy shortly.
Another fund-raising letter,
mailed by Goldwater Jr. last Decem
ber, included a birthday card which
Goldwater asked recipients to send
to his father. It praised Goldwater Sr.
and continued, ". . . he is giving his
all on behalf of my campaign to join
him in the Senate before he retires
"Don't forget to sign and return
the enclosed birthday card to my
dad. It will mean so very much to
him. And, if it is at all possible, please
send me a contribution so I can de
feat Jerry Brown and become the
next United States senator from Cali
fornia . . .
Goldwater offered no comment
when reporters at the convention
questioned him about the ethics of
his fund-raising methods.
At the Monterey convention,
Goldwater betrayed no sign of the
jumbled syntax and seeming in
articulateness for which he frequent
ly receives criticism.
Earlier, though, Senate candidate
Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Santa
Monica) said if Goldwater won the
Republican primary nomination and
were to debate Brown, the Senate
race would be over. "This race will be
determined by debates," Dornan
said. "Goldwater is a poor debater.
The race against Brown would be
over in the first 15 minutes."
"I may not be a loud and
boisterous speaker," Goldwater re
sponded, "but I am effective in the
causes I espouse."
Because Goldwater spends so
much time in California campaign
ing, his 58 percent voting record in
the past year is comparatively low.
"It's difficult to be in two places at the
same time," he said. "I haven't
missed the significant votes."
This is the second in a series of
articles on five of the eight an
nounced candidates for the Re
publican nomination for United
States Senate. The interviews were
conducted in Monterey at the Cali
fornia Republican Convention last

ate primary were held today, Rep.
Barry Goldwater, Jr. (R-Woodland
Hills) would capture the Republican

nearest challengers: accordingtothe

support, followed by San Diego
Mayor Pete Wilson with 16 percent
and Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-

Goldwater, a self-avowed conser

represented his district, which in
cludes northwestern Los Angeles

County and southern Ventura Coun

The 43-year-old congressman is
particularly proud of two things: his
family name and his country. These
elements are at the crux of his cam
paign.
