# Assault victims relate experiences
## 
### 
Editor's note:
Following is the second half of
the text of an interview by Univer
sity News and Publication's Karen
Bartholomew. She was ap
proached at a rape awareness ses
sion by two of the women who
had been sexually assaulted on
campus earlier this fall. The in
terview was originally published
in last Wednesday's Campus Re
port. See page 5 for a statement
from three of the women who
were assaulted this fall.
Like the Daily, News and Publi
cations does not seek out or pub
lish the names of rape victims
without their permission. For this
reason, the woman who was at
tacked and raped while she was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5 will be referred to as
Alice. The woman who was as

saulted near Tresidder Union on
her first day at Stanford in the fall
will be called Beth. In that attack,
the assailant did not complete the
rape.
Men
Alice — I didn't want to have
anything to do with men right af
terwards. I had a really tough time
just talking to them. I didn't want
eye-to-eye contact with anyone.
Beth- I want to be able to react
normally to men but it's hard to do
that now.
Alice — I'm now really sensitive
to having guys say, 'Hey, cutie." I
don't like that kind of talk — I'm
not an object. I am a person and I
want to be considered a person,
not someone who's cute. Men
who know I've been raped don't
say, 'Hi, cutie.'

Beth — Women don't want to
be raped. Men especially seem to
think you were asking for it be
cause you were out alone or you
were wearing shorts or something
like that.

Racial tension

Beth — Women around campus
have heard the description, they
know the rapist is a black man. So
they aren't afraid of white men, al
though white men are potential
rapists also. They'll run from black
men automatically.
It's sort of two-sided. I'm glad
people are aware that they aren't
safe, but I'm sorry for the men
who have to put up with the other
people's fears.
I feel like making a public
apology to the black community
house because it's not at attack on
blacks as a race. It's one person
whose skin color happens to be
black who has some problems. It
could just as well have been a
white.
