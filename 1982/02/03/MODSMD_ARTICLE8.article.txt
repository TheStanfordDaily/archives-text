# Assault victims relate experiences
## 
### 
Editor's note:
Following is the second half of
the text of an interview by Univer
sity News and Publication's Karen
Bartholomew. She was ap
proached at a rape awareness ses
sion by two of the women who
had been sexually assaulted on
campus earlier this fall. The in
terview was originally published
in last Wednesday's Campus Re
port. See page 5 for a statement
from three of the women who
were assaulted this fall.
Like the Daily, News and Publi
cations does not seek out or pub
lish the names of rape victims
without their permission. For this
reason, the woman who was at
tacked and raped while she was
jogging by the Stanford stadium
on Nov. 5 will be referred to as
Alice. The woman who was as

saulted near Tresidder Union on
her first day at Stanford in the fall
will be called Beth. In that attack,
the assailant did not complete the
rape.
Men
Alice — I didn't want to have
anything to do with men right af
terwards. I had a really tough time
just talking to them. I didn't want
eye-to-eye contact with anyone.
Beth- I want to be able to react
normally to men but it's hard to do
that now.
Alice — I'm now really sensitive
to having guys say, 'Hey, cutie." I
don't like that kind of talk — I'm
not an object. I am a person and I
want to be considered a person,
not someone who's cute. Men
who know I've been raped don't
say, 'Hi, cutie.'

Beth — Women don't want to
be raped. Men especially seem to
think you were asking for it be
cause you were out alone or you
were wearing shorts or something
like that.

Racial tension

Beth — Women around campus
have heard the description, they
know the rapist is a black man. So
they aren't afraid of white men, al
though white men are potential
rapists also. They'll run from black
men automatically.
It's sort of two-sided. I'm glad
people are aware that they aren't
safe, but I'm sorry for the men
who have to put up with the other
people's fears.
I feel like making a public
apology to the black community
house because it's not at attack on
blacks as a race. It's one person
whose skin color happens to be
black who has some problems. It
could just as well have been a
white.

Alice—l'm prejudiced against black men. I wasn't
before. Prior to the rape I had dated black men.
I find it very hard to trust anyone. I always stand
my guard whenever I'm meeting someone. I never
trust anyone automatically. They have to prove
themselves to me, but even more so with blacks—l
don't trust them at all.
Beth—l've always been taught not to be
prejudiced, but when it happened I remember thinking
I didn't want it to interfere with how I felt about black
people the rest of my life. So consequently every time I
wanted someone to walk me somewhere, I'd ask a
black guy downstairs to find someone. He coordinates
the escort service for our dorm, but he always walks
me himself. No matter what he's doing, he always
drops it and goes with me. He's just been so good to
me-he's incredible!
I think black men are very much on guard about
walking around and people looking at them and
women backing away because they're thinking 'the
rapist!'
Is there a lot of tension between blacks and whites on
campus right now?
Beth —I feel like there is between black men and
white women.
Alice—When 1 go to the black theme house, I sense
tension in the guys. They seem to be very aware of
who's looking at them.
I heard one guy who's around 5'10" and black say
that when he goes down to the laundry room,
everyone will run. He's left alone in the laundry room.
It's really sad. It's ironic that I'm saying that because I
find myself to be very prejudiced. I have to overcome
it. I don't think everyone should automically label or
stereotype blacks.
Beth—lf I were a black man I think I'd feel like
people were blaming me for something 1 didn't do. It
must be really hard. It's just a fluke of nature that this
rapist happened to be black. It's not his skin color that
made him a rapist, it's his mind or something that
happened to him.
I've tried really hard to get to know some blacks in
my dorm. I'm sure they don't realize that's part of the
reason I'm doing it. I went to a high school that had
maybe 15 blacks, so I didn't have any contact with
blacks. After this experience with the black man who
attacked me.. .1 didn't want that to change how I felt
about people.
I find that after I get to know people who are black,
I stop thinking of them as being black and start
thinking of them as friends. But when I see a black
person I don't know, I think of the person as black. I
tend to see black men as potential rapists, rather than
potential friends. But when a black is a friend, that's
not the case.
Alice—With the blacks I know, if I knew them
prior to the rape, they're friends. With blacks I've met
since the rape, it's all superficial. 11l say, 'Hi, how are
you.' But that's as far as 111 let it go. I won't let
friendship come out of it. 11l get over it.

'Some people around
campus are faulting the
black community, which is
absurd. It doesn't make any
difference what races the
suspect and victim are. The
only struggle that should
come out of an interracial
rape is the struggle that the
victim has to overcome/

Beth—Some people around campus are faulting
the black community, which is absurd. It doesn't make
any difference what races the suspect and victim are.
The only struggle that should come out of an in
terracial rape is the struggle that the victim has to
overcome.
Alice—But that's hard because rape does not affect
just the victim, it also affects society.
The rapist
Alice—l haven't let myself feel anger toward him
yet. I think something in his mind snapped. I don't
think of him as a sick person, which is really strange. I
don't understand why I feel that way. When people
say, 'He's sick,' I say, 'No, he's not.' He probably
functions very well in society. Something is just not
right with him. He displays his anger in another way.
Beth—l don't see him as a psychotic rapist. I feel

he's not getting the support he needs. He's probably a
very lonely person.
Counseling services
Alice—l don't think the University's psychological
services are very good. I tried two counselors and I
think they did me more harm than good. I finally went
out and got my own counselor in Palo Alto.
Do you want counseling?
Beth—A lot of times I feel like I do, but not from
the University. I was referred by somebody outside to
a female counselor at Stanford. I was very displeased,
but at the time I wasn't able to confront her about it.
It's like you're reaching out trying to grasp for
somebody. [The attack) happened the first night I was
on campus and I didn't know anybody here. I was just
grabbing for anything I could hold onto. I told the

'77ie hardest thing is not
knowing where to go. If they
handed you the information
it would be a lot easier.. .it
would have been helpful to
have a list of places to call in
the University/

counselor I was bothered that I couldn't remember
one part of the attack. Her answer to that was, 'Well,
have you ever thought maybe you're lying to yourself,
maybe you're lying about the whole thing?'
I was very upset. There's no way you can prove
you were attacked. If you had witnesses you wouldn't
have been attacked. I couldn't even believe she raised
that question. Of course it happened. Maybe I was
making too big a deal out of the stuff I couldn't
remember but it was something that was really
bothering me.
Alice—When I went to see a University counselor I
walked in and I thought he knew why I was there
because I had told them I was a rape victim when I
called for the appointment. But he didn't know and I
didn't know that he didn't know. I was off rambling.
Finally he said, 'Well, what happened?' after 10
minutes of listening to me. That upset me.
I think it was the second time as I was leaving that
he said, 'Well, you definitely have a problem.' Now the
last thing I needed was for someone to tell me, 'You
definitely have a problem.' I didn't have a problem, I
just wanted someone to help me gain control of my life
again.
Beth—The lady who was counseling me would call
every time there was another rape to find out if I
would be willing to have my name given to the new
victim. She brought in a couple of other victims during
my session, so it turned into an informal group.
Has the University done enough for you?
Alice—l didn't know about any of the services
except one, and that was through Beth. Maybe I didn't
look in the right places.
Beth—The hardest thing is not knowing where to
go. If they handed you the information it would be a
lot easier. In my case, they didn't know it was as
serious as it was because I didn't tell the police
everything. But it would have been helpful to have a
list of places to call in the University.
Alice—l did have a couple of phone calls from
University administrators. But at the time, I was in
shock. I don't remember half of what they told me.
Beth—Sometimes when you're in your denial
stage, you don't feel like you need any help. 'I'm going
to be strong and conquer this by myself.Then the next
day or the next week you realize you would like
someone to talk to because it's going to be hairy.
So you may have discouraged some of the help that
was offered by the University because you were in the
denial stage?
Alice—Right.
Cooperating with the police
Beth—Victims should cooperate with the police.
It's hard going through the questioning, but they're
just trying to help you.
When they came, I didn't tell them everything. I
had gone back to my dorm and I was just so blown
away that I didn't want anybody to find out. So at first
I didn't tell the police everything that happened. Now
I know I should have. It's so embarrassing when male
police officers ask you questions about exactly what
did he do and you have to describe it word for word.
But it's really important to get it out in the open right
away.

Alice—The Stanford police are very gentle, very
understanding, very patient.
I think it's good that there's so much emphasis on
getting medical attention. I knew I had to be checked
and it seemed like a good way to start, to keep on
living. If I had just gone back to the dorm and not
sought help, I would have been giving in, saying,
'Okay, you hurt me.' By going and seeking help im-

'If men could try to think
emotional rather than
sexual, they'd probably be a
whole lot more help.
Because although a man did
force himself on you, you
first deal with the emotional
part... Guys just
automatically think, 'Oh, my
God, he forced himself on
you/ They don't think about
what comes after that/

mediately I was saying, 'You may have hurt me, but
not enough to stop me from living.'
Beth—The police didn't tell me to go get checked
because they didn't know everything that had hap
pened to me. I went about a month later. I had never
thought about venereal disease. Women should be
checked even if it was not a completed rape.
Safety
Is there more the University can do to protect people?
Beth—The hard thing is that this is just such a
beautiful campus and part of its beauty is all the
landscaping.
Alice—We were looking at the suggested travel
routes map. It's ridiculous. Where they say it's
lighted—it's not. The lighting on campus is just
terrible.
Beth—l think there should be more lighting or
stronger intensity lighting.
There are lots of shadows and bushes. It's really
frightening, knowing that all they have to do is jump
on you from the bushes.
I think SURE [escort service] is great but they

should extend the hours to start at 5, even during fall
quarter.
Alice—l think they're short on manpower, but if
they c0u1d....
Rape
Alice—Some people jump when you say the word
'rape.' The word is foreboding. But it helps a lot for
your friends to use it, otherwise it kind of inhibits you.
Beth—You can be psychologically raped by
hearing men say, 'Hey, cutie.' Rape is a violation. Yet
our society thinks of rape as penetration in a certain
place, and if it's not there, it's not as bad or as im
portant. Maybe the physical aspect isn't, but the
mental recovery is pretty much the same.
Alice—The guys I know on campus, when you say
rape, deal with the sexual aspect of it. 'Someone forced
himself on a girl.' A female, on the other hand, will
immediately think in emotional terms.
If men could try to think emotional rather than
sexual, they'd probably be a whole lot more help.
Because although a man did force himself on you, you
first deal with the emotional part. Of course, I have
flashes of what happened, but \ deal with my emotions
before I deal with the sexual aspect of rape. Guys just
automatically think, t)h, my God, he forced himself
on you.' They don't think about what comes after
that.
Sex
[Editor's note: The following comments are unat
tributed.]
I don't know what would happen if you weren't
sexually experienced. If you were very naive about
sex, you'd have more to deal with than someone who
could deal more with the violent aspect of it.
It really bothers me now that I'm not a virgin
anymore. I have never known what [a pleasurable
sexual relationship] was like
I kept thinking 'this is the same thing, yet two
different things.' My previous experience correlated
with this experience—they were the same, yet they
were different. While it was happening, I knew they
were different and there was a reason for them to be
different, yet they were the same. It's hard to put
together how something so beautiful and so nice could
be so evil and ugly.
I wonder now whether I'm going to be normal
when I get to that point (of having a physical
relationship with a man], and whether a guy is ever
going to like me. I have this great fear that I'm going
to be an old maid. I really need to hear someone say,


Carol Bennett/Daily
'You're a normal female,' or 'You will be normal.' It's
something I really need but I don't know how to get.
A support network
Beth—The informal support from other victims is
definitely the thing that's helped the most. Maybe if
you got a really good counselor it would help. Friends
can do only a certain amount. It comes to a point that
there's only so much people can do who haven't gone
through it.
Alice —I remember my first month I used to call
Beth at odd hours of the night, like around 1 a.m. and
ask, 'Did you ever feel like...?' And she'd say, 'Yes,

It's really important to get it
in the open because you
can't recover alone. No
matter how strong you think
you are, you aren't strong
enough.

Alice/ 'Okay, I just wanted to make sure it was okay,'
I'd say. (Both laugh sharing the memory.)
Sometimes youll be feeling something and youH
think, 'You shouldn't be feeling this way.' Calling up
Beth and saying, 'Did you ever...?' and hearing her
say, 'Yes, it's okay to feel that way,' does wonders.
Beth—l remember calling her up the night after
she was raped and saying, 'Yes, Alice, you're in shock
and in a while youll be out of it.' Then the next day
talking to her and saying, 'Alice, you're still in shock,
just wait ' [Both laugh ]
Alice—lt's so helpful to know you're not alone—
that someone else maybe does not know what you're
going through but can relate to it better than someone
who hasn't gone through it.
Beth—Most people don't have these weird
feelings, so they don't know it's normal.
The big problem I had was that as the first one
attacked this year I was supposed to be the farthest
along in recovery. I kept thinking, 'I've got to survive
so they know they can survive.' It helped me a lot to
meet someone who was 25 years old and had been
attacked when she was 17. She did make it and I can
make it.
Police don't want to give out names of victims, so
it's hard to get in touch with people who are reaching
out for something but don't know where to go. And
especially after they get burned by counseling or
something. They just think, 'Wow, there's no place to
go -' . u
It's really important to get it out in the open
because you can't recover alone. No matter how
strong you think you are, you aren't strong enough.
Turning outward is one of the best ways of getting
over it yourself.
Alice—Yes, just knowing that other women
survived it and they now find some joy in life



'Rape is harsh and ugly.. .1 feel like I have been thrown into a
black hole. In this black hole I am all alone. People surround
me, yet the loneliness does not subside. lam alone with myself.
My soul is entangled with desperation to find the me I once
thought I controlled. I feel as though I am engulfed by
darkness, by nothingness — / am nothing.'
