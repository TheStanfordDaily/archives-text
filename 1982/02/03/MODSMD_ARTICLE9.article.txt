A large rubber glove reaches out of a brazing chamber at Garrett Turbine Engine
Co. in Phoenix, Ariz., although operator Larry Vine doesn't appear too concerned.
The operator of the chamber returns the glove through the opening in the
chamber, so that his hands are fully protected and pliable to work.
