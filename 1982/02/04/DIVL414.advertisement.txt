Aißesearch Industrial Division (A.1.D.). a division of The Garrett Corporation, is the world s largest manufacturer
of turbochargers and heat exchangers. Operating out of several modern plant facilities in the South Bay area of
Los Angeles county, A.I.D. has pioneered the technology and the market for turbochargers and related
equipment which contribute significantly to the solution of environmental and fuel related problems.
The overall market for turbochargers, which provides a means for improving the performance and efficiency of
internal combustion engines, is well established. The increased interest by major engine and vehicle
manufacturers in developing turbochargers for intra city trucks and passenger cars, will expand certain segments
of that market. Within this growth mode, tremendous opportunities for personal growth and development are
available for sharp, motivated individuals.
The backbone of A.l.D.'s advanced technology, new products, and technical management comes from mechanical
engineers in product development, engineering sciences, and sales engineering. These positions are involved
with proposal activities, design, performance analysis, and other specialized and analytical areas. Opportunities
also exist for manufacturing engineers in the development of process machinery, and equipment in high volume,
high precision machining and assembly operation. For top students in mechanical, manufacturing, and industrial
engineering, a rotation training program is available wherein the individual is exposed to all aspects of his or her
profession as well as other interfacing departments.
Our representatives will be visiting Stanford on April 13th. Don't miss this opportunity to learn more about how
you might turbocharge your career.
