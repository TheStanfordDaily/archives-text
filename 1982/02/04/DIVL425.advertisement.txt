There's a natural high that Beckman engineers get know
ing that the work they're doing is vital to the lives of millions.
It's being associated with a company committed to improv
ing the quality of life around the world. It's working on
products that aid in the diagnosis and treatment of disease,
drug management, and research into almost every discip
line of life science.
And a natural high, too, is a company concerned with the
personal and career satisfaction of its professionals. That's
Beckman. Where employees enjoy exceptional job sec
urity, competitive salary and benefits, and a full recreational
calendar.
If you're a candidate for a Bachelor Degree, Masters
Degree or PhD in Electrical Engineering, Mechanical En
