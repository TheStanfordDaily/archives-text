# East Asian Studies to get new dorm complex wing
## 
### Peter Finch 
One of the new student residences
under construction on Governor s
Ave. has been designated as the East
Asian Studies theme house, accord
ing to Norm Robinson, dean of resi
dential education.
The house, which will hold 60 stu
dents and a resident fellow, is one of
three new "independent houses"
scheduled for use beginning in Janu
ary, 1983.
"The plan (for an East Asian Studies
theme house) wasapproved a couple
years ago," said Robinson. "But at
that time we had no place to lodge it.
So we said that if there was still in
terest when we had a place, they
would get it."
According to Janet Van Houten,
director of the new housing project,
when the French House was nearly
terminated in the spring of 1980, it
was her understanding that the East
House (its tentative name) would
take its place. "But there was a big ap
peal and the French House was al
lowed to stay," she said. "The East
House was then sort of in limbo."
When it was decided that one of
the three new houses would have a
theme, Robinson said, the East House
was first in line to claim it.
Criteria for residency in the house
are currently being formulated, ac
cording to Dan Okimoto, a member

of the East House Steering Commit
tee. He speculated that priority for
students will be assigned according
to three categories:
•First priority for East Asian Studies
majors or students who have com
pleted at least 15 units of work in the
department.
•Second priority for non-majors
who have shown an interest in East
Asia, perhaps through doing course
work, acquiring a language back
ground or receiving a recommenda
tion from an East Asian Studies facul
ty member.
•Third priority for students with no
background in the field but who are
willing to attend seminars or or
ganize an individual program during
the year.
"We want to keep it open-ended,"
said Okimoto. "We will not exclude a
student without prior experience in
the department."
Okimoto said although the
inumber of East Asian Studies majors
is small, other students with varying
degrees of interest in East Asian Stud
ies may boost the total number of
those interested in the house sub
stantially.
Of the new residences, the East
Flouse will be the closest to Santa
Teresa St., according to Robinson.
That particular site was chosen, he

said, because "when we were look
ing at the plans, we looked for ways
that we could do things with the way
the house was built. Perhaps we'll be
putting in an outside garden. That
would be really nice. And there's a
place wherethe tea-garden ceremo
ny could perhaps be practiced."
To date, none of the other houses
slated for use by next January have
been given themes. However, Rob
inson said he hopes the other two
"independent houses" will have
strong programs. "We want a high
level of faculty involvement."
Van Houten agreed and noted, "I
imagine the resident fellows will
bring in his or her interests. That
doesn't constitute a theme house,
but Idefinitelyseeprogramshappen
ing there, which would make them
different than 558 Mayfield, for ex
ample."
Two other residences included in
the new housing plan are scheduled
to be ready for use by next January.
They both consist ofsuites, "accord
ing to Van Houten, and will house
260 students each. Neither was con
sidei ed for use as a theme house, she
said.
"They're like apartments," she
said, "with a living room and a bath
room and corresponding
bedrooms."
