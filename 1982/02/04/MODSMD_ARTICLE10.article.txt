## 
### 
Vicenza, Italy (AP) — Brig.
Gen. James Dozier said Tues
day he battled "excruciating
boredom" but never despaired
although chained and con
fined to a tiny tent in his six
week captivity in a Red
Brigades' "people's prison."
The U.S. Army general also
admitted he was embarrassed
because he failed to heed
warnings to take security meas
ures against kidnapping. U.S.
officials said Dozier was sched
uled to fly to Washington yes
terday and would meet with
President Ronald Reagan to
day.
The general told his first full

news conference since his
rescue last Thursday that he
spent most of his captivity do
zing, reading books and news
paper clippings on his abduc
tion, and moving his arms and
legs for better circulation.
"The period was character
ized by excruciating boredom
... I went from competitive su
personic existence to slow sub
sonic existence," he said.
Asked what he missed most
during his captivity, Dozier re
plied:
"In addition to not having
my personal freedom, not
being with my wife, the thing I
missed most was the physical
exercise ... I normally jog
about four- kilometers (2.5
miles) a day," Dozier said.
The 50-year-old general ad
mitted that he had ignored
warnings by Italian authorities
and failed to take adequate se
curity to protect himself
against a terrorist kidnapping.
Dozier, the highest ranking
U.S. officer at the NATO base
in Verona, was abducted from
his apartment in that northern
Italian city Dec. 17 in the first,
political kidnapping of an]
American in Italy.
Dozier appeared relaxed:
and occasionally drew laughter
from nearly 150 reporters and
photographers with his com
mentson how the terroristsov
erestimated his command of
Italian, and how he argued
with his captors over the type
of music they forced him to lis
ten to through earphones.
"Right from the beginning I
was forced to wear earphones
through which music was
played. Some of the tapes they
would play were what I would
call hard rock, and thoseof you
who never heard hard rock for
eight or nine hoursoughttotry
it some time," Dozier said.
