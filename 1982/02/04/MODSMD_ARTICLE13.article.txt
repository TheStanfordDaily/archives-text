## Viewpoint/Steve Borish An alphabet of Reaganomics 
### 
Since his election to the presiden
cy a little more than a year ago, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan has done much
to reverse the tyranny of the Sierra
Club and its associates, and to make
the economy free for business to op
erate the way it always has wanted to
operate: without restrictions.
Thus it is to him and to his dedi
cated, patriotic policy of removing
governmental restraint?on business,
that I dedicate the following modest
effort at writing, for our children, a
little primer that will help them to ap
preciate just how important and
timely are Mr. Reagan's policies in
this area. It is especially fitting to
write such a primer for our children,
since they will be the main benefi
ciaries these policies:
A is for Acid Rain. It comes from
the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil
and gas), and acidifies lake water at a
convenient distance from the plants
where these fuels were burned.
8 is for Benzene, the most widely
produced synthetic organic
chemical. Studies indicate a rela
tionshipto leukemia: each year more
than 12 billion pounds of its is pro
duced in the United States alone.
C is for Cadmium, a trace metal
used in plastics, alloys, insecticides,
and occasionally in ice cube con
tainers. It has been implicated in hy
pertension, emphysema, and kidney
damage.
D is for DES (diethylstilbestrol). It is
a sex hormone used to promote
weight in cattle, and has caused
cancer in at least six different species

of lab animals and at eight different
organ sites.
E is for Epilation, a falling out of the
hair. It is one of the many symptoms
associated with radiation poisoning.
F is for Food dyes, like butter yel
low, red 2 and ultramarine blue. Ap
proximately four million children
will have consumed one pound of
these suspected carcinogens by the
time they are 12.
C is for Greenhouse effect, the
gradual heating and de-oxygenation
of the atmosphere predicted from
deforestation combined with the
burning of ever larger amounts of
fossil fuels.
H is for the Half-life of radioactive
substances. It ranges from seconds
(Nitrogen-16) to billions of years
(Thorium-232). In the meantime the
energy produced from ionizing radi
ation is strong enough to damage or
destroy living cells.
I is for lonizing radiation: alpha,
beta, gamma and x-rays. Gamma
rays, the most powerful, will pass
through several inches of lead before
being stopped.
J is for James Watt, who is opening
up our parks and oceans for fossil
fuel exploration on the part of big
companies so that we can have a bet
ter way of life in the future.
K is for Kepone, a pesticide. Its
main plant, in Hopewell, Va., was
closed down after 28 employees
were hospitalized; kepone was
found in marine life 65 miles away in
the James River Basin.
L is for Lead, which goes into the

environment from the tail pipes of
vehicles at a yearly rate of about two
kilograms (4.4 pounds) per car. Many
studies show it possesses a wide
range of toxic properties.
M is for Mesothelioma, a rare and
particularly deadly form of concer af
fecting the lining of the lung, caused
by exposure to asbestos.
N is for Nitrites, food preservatives
(in bacon, sausage, etc.) that com
bine in your stomach with amines to
form nitrosamines, a carcinogen that
causes a variety of tumors and can
cers in experimental animals.
O is for the Ozone layer of the at
mosphere, that is known to have
been damaged by the fluorocarbons
in aerosol sprays.
P is for Plutonium-239, "a long
lived, bone seeker which, once it is in
the bloodstream, is approximately as
hazardous as radium." Appropriately
named after Pluto, the God of Hell, it
is the most carcinogenic or cancer
causing substance in the known uni
verse.
Q is for Queasy, the way you must
be feeling now.
R is for Rem, a dose unit of radi
ation. Accumulating evidence seems
to indicate that there is no such thing
as a safe level of exposure to ionizing
radiation.
S is for Sarin, a nerve gas that in
hibits a vital enzyme in the nervous
system, causing abdominal cramps,
diarrhea, convulsions, respiratory
paralysis and death. We have lots of
it, as do the Russians.
T is for TCE (trichloroethylene), a

known carcinogen that has been
found in the Santa Clara County wa
ter supply.
U is for Uranium. Waste from the
mining process, evidently too ex
pensive to bury, gives off radon gas
for tens of thousands of years.
V is for Vinyl chloride, an industrial
chemical. Workers exposed to it died
from a rare and incurable liver cancer
called angiosarcoma.
W is for Water. Both surface and
groundwaters, as well as the oceans,
are slowly being poisoned by the
massive dumping of industrial
wastes, both radioactive and non-ra

dioactive.
X is for Xenon-133, another radio
active gas. High levels of exposure in
mice produced bone-marrow de
pression, atrophy of lymphoid tissue,
pulmonary hemorrhages, edema and
loss of sperm.
Y is for Yusho disease, the name
given by the Japanese to PCB poison
ing. Symptoms include cheeselike
discharges from the eyes, fatigue,
and deformities of the joints and
bones.
Z is for the Zooplankton in the
ocean, primary photosynthesizers

that make possible the ocean food
chain. If we continue to pollute tho
oceans, sooner or later we will de
stroy thein.
Well, that about does it. The sun
will broil us, the oceans will be dead.
The rivers will be cesspools, the air
deadly to breathe, the soil destroyed,
nuclear reactors everywhere, and
perhaps an occasional accident here
and there . . . Oh, well, it's a small
price to pay for a booming economy,
isn't it?

a sex hormone used to promote
weight in cattle, and has caused
cancer in at least six different species

of lab animals and at eight different
organ sites.
E is for Epilation, a falling out of the
hair. It is one of the many symptoms
associated with radiation poisoning.
F is for Food dyes, like butter yel
low, red 2 and ultramarine blue. Ap
proximately four million children
will have consumed one pound of
these suspected carcinogens by the
time they are 12.
C is for Greenhouse effect, the
gradual heating and de-oxygenation
of the atmosphere predicted from
deforestation combined with the
burning of ever larger amounts of
fossil fuels.
H is for the Half-life of radioactive
substances. It ranges from seconds
(Nitrogen-16) to billions of years
(Thorium-232). In the meantime the
energy produced from ionizing radi
ation is strong enough to damage or
destroy living cells.
I is for lonizing radiation: alpha,
beta, gamma and x-rays. Gamma
rays, the most powerful, will pass
through several inches of lead before
being stopped.
J is for James Watt, who is opening
up our parks and oceans for fossil
fuel exploration on the part of big
companies so that we can have a bet
ter way of life in the future.
K is for Kepone, a pesticide. Its
main plant, in Hopewell, Va., was
closed down after 28 employees
were hospitalized; kepone was
found in marine life 65 miles away in
the James River Basin.
L is for Lead, which goes into the

environment from the tail pipes of
vehicles at a yearly rate of about two
kilograms (4.4 pounds) per car. Many
studies show it possesses a wide
range of toxic properties.
M is for Mesothelioma, a rare and
particularly deadly form of concer af
fecting the lining of the lung, caused
by exposure to asbestos.
N is for Nitrites, food preservatives
(in bacon, sausage, etc.) that com
bine in your stomach with amines to
form nitrosamines, a carcinogen that
causes a variety of tumors and can
cers in experimental animals.
O is for the Ozone layer of the at
mosphere, that is known to have
been damaged by the fluorocarbons
in aerosol sprays.
P is for Plutonium-239, "a long
lived, bone seeker which, once it is in
the bloodstream, is approximately as
hazardous as radium." Appropriately
named after Pluto, the God of Hell, it
is the most carcinogenic or cancer
causing substance in the known uni
verse.
Q is for Queasy, the way you must
be feeling now.
R is for Rem, a dose unit of radi
ation. Accumulating evidence seems
to indicate that there is no such thing
as a safe level of exposure to ionizing
radiation.
S is for Sarin, a nerve gas that in
hibits a vital enzyme in the nervous
system, causing abdominal cramps,
diarrhea, convulsions, respiratory
paralysis and death. We have lots of
it, as do the Russians.
T is for TCE (trichloroethylene), a

known carcinogen that has been
found in the Santa Clara County wa
ter supply.
U is for Uranium. Waste from the
mining process, evidently too ex
pensive to bury, gives off radon gas
for tens of thousands of years.
V is for Vinyl chloride, an industrial
chemical. Workers exposed to it died
from a rare and incurable liver cancer
called angiosarcoma.
W is for Water. Both surface and
groundwaters, as well as the oceans,
are slowly being poisoned by the
massive dumping of industrial
wastes, both radioactive and non-ra

dioactive.
X is for Xenon-133, another radio
active gas. High levels of exposure in
mice produced bone-marrow de
pression, atrophy of lymphoid tissue,
pulmonary hemorrhages, edema and
loss of sperm.
Y is for Yusho disease, the name
given by the Japanese to PCB poison
ing. Symptoms include cheeselike
discharges from the eyes, fatigue,
and deformities of the joints and
bones.
Z is for the Zooplankton in the
ocean, primary photosynthesizers

that make possible the ocean food
chain. If we continue to pollute tho
oceans, sooner or later we will de
stroy thein.
Well, that about does it. The sun
will broil us, the oceans will be dead.
The rivers will be cesspools, the air
deadly to breathe, the soil destroyed,
nuclear reactors everywhere, and
perhaps an occasional accident here
and there . . . Oh, well, it's a small
price to pay for a booming economy,
isn't it?
(Steve Borish is a graduate student in
anthropology.)

Since his election to the presiden
cy a little more than a year ago, Presi
dent Ronald Reagan has done much
to reverse the tyranny of the Sierra
Club and its associates, and to make
the economy free for business to op
erate the way it always has wanted to
operate: without restrictions.
Thus it is to him and to his dedi
cated, patriotic policy of removing
governmental restraint?on business,
that I dedicate the following modest
effort at writing, for our children, a
little primer that will help them to ap
preciate just how important and
timely are Mr. Reagan's policies in
this area. It is especially fitting to
write such a primer for our children,
since they will be the main benefi
ciaries these policies:
A is for Acid Rain. It comes from
the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil
and gas), and acidifies lake water at a
convenient distance from the plants
where these fuels were burned.
8 is for Benzene, the most widely
produced synthetic organic
chemical. Studies indicate a rela
tionshipto leukemia: each year more
than 12 billion pounds of its is pro
duced in the United States alone.
C is for Cadmium, a trace metal
used in plastics, alloys, insecticides,
and occasionally in ice cube con
tainers. It has been implicated in hy
pertension, emphysema, and kidney
damage.
D is for DES (diethylstilbestrol). It is
a sex hormone used to promote
