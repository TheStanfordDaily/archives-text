## Reagan's policy bad for air, water, environmental managers 
### 
Washington — Everyone knows
President Ronald Reagan's decen
tralized approach to environmental
protection could have calamitous
consequences for our nation's air
and water. But his policies are already
having a chilling effect on another
important national resource: en
vironmental managers.
Under the guise of a "New Federal
ism," the president is speeding up
the transfer of responsibilities to state
and local environmental managers
but, at the same time, is expected to
reduce federal funding to these pro-,
grams and university research
projects this year. The fallout may not
only mean less environmental pro
tection; the administration is cutting

opportunities for environmental
professionals at all levels of govern
ment and may be undermining
America's ability to recruit them in

Under the inimical stewardship of
administrator Anne Gorsuch, the EPA is
quickly becoming an agency which repels
professionals. Many top-grade employees are
resigning under their volition — no one likes
to watch their house ransacked.

the future.
Biologists, engineers and other
technicians can already see what's
happening to their mecca, the feder

al Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). By October of this year, ac
cording to William Drayton jr. of the
"Save EPA" committee, the adminis-

tration hopes to reduce agency staff
by 3300 from its 11,400 level in 1981.

fessionals. Many top-grade employ

lition — no one likes to watch their

"The attrition rate at EPA would be
much higher if there were more jobs
in the private sector," observed
Drayton, a former EPA assistant ad
ministrator who's entered private
consulting.
Meanwhile, state and local en
vironmental programs, which have
grown tremendously in size and
scope during the past decade, aren't
necessarily expanding. In Forsyth
County, N.C. for example, where the
local environmental affairs depart

ment was forced to cut its staff from
23 to 15 late last year, director Robert
Fulp reported that he'd received at
least 50 applications for a single labo
ratory position.
Such stiff competition for a single
job may be the short-term effect of
Reagan's new environmental feder
alism. But over the long term, in
terested undergraduates and even
more experienced professionals may
turn away from environmental ca
reers altogether.
Thomas Jorling, a former EPA of
ficial now teaching at Williams Col
lege, concedes that the adminis
tration is sending negative signals to
once and future environmentalists.
As if a gutted EPA weren't sufficiently
discouraging for aspiring pro
fessionals, harsh administration poli
cies are sure to leave many dedicated
environmentalists feeling burned
and turned off to public service.
While directors of university en
vironmental programs are still
assessing the impact of the Reagan
era, students are being forced to re
consider their chances in the en
vironmental field. With potential re
ductions of up to 75 percent in EPA
research aid to university programs,
it seems only an understatement for
Russ Christian, chairman of the Uni
versity of North Carolina's environ
mental sciences department, to say
that "research cuts could weaken the
ability of graduate programs to at
tract and support students."

Of course, the environmentalist
community is only one of the many
embattled interests demanding more
federal financing. While un
fortunate, we don't expect either
Washington or the states to reverse
fiscally conservative trends before
chemical disasters and incessant
smog alerts set in.
Atthe same time, however, theen
vironmental protection of the coun
try is one area with which the private
sector cannot be trusted. Despite the
glossy ads praising "what Texaco is
doing to clean up the ocean," other
outfits make no pretense about safe
guarding the environment. Business
and industry's commitment to
ecology goes only as far as govern
ment rules require it to.
It's a tidy thought in 1982 for de
regulators to predict that any future
need for environmental pro
fessionals will be met quickly.
But we can't expect environmental
managers to hang around until a
more responsible administration
takes over. Indeed, many of the es
tablished and experimental pro
grams may have dried up by the 1984
elections.
For those of us who came of age
with environmentalism it's fright
ening to see the nation back itself
into a darker age where little is being
done to protect Mother Earth.

Washington — Everyone knows
President Ronald Reagan's decen
tralized approach to environmental
protection could have calamitous
consequences for our nation's air
and water. But his policies are already
having a chilling effect on another
important national resource: en
vironmental managers.
Under the guise of a "New Federal
ism," the president is speeding up
the transfer of responsibilities to state
and local environmental managers
but, at the same time, is expected to
reduce federal funding to these pro-,
grams and university research
projects this year. The fallout may not
only mean less environmental pro
tection; the administration is cutting

opportunities for environmental
professionals at all levels of govern
ment and may be undermining
America's ability to recruit them in

Under the inimical stewardship of
administrator Anne Gorsuch, the EPA is
quickly becoming an agency which repels
professionals. Many top-grade employees are
resigning under their volition — no one likes
to watch their house ransacked.

Biologists, engineers and other
technicians can already see what's
happening to their mecca, the feder

al Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). By October of this year, ac
cording to William Drayton jr. of the
"Save EPA" committee, the adminis-

tration hopes to reduce agency staff
by 3300 from its 11,400 level in 1981.

"The attrition rate at EPA would be
much higher if there were more jobs
in the private sector," observed
Drayton, a former EPA assistant ad
ministrator who's entered private
consulting.
Meanwhile, state and local en
vironmental programs, which have
grown tremendously in size and
scope during the past decade, aren't
necessarily expanding. In Forsyth
County, N.C. for example, where the
local environmental affairs depart

ment was forced to cut its staff from
23 to 15 late last year, director Robert
Fulp reported that he'd received at
least 50 applications for a single labo
ratory position.
Such stiff competition for a single
job may be the short-term effect of
Reagan's new environmental feder
alism. But over the long term, in
terested undergraduates and even
more experienced professionals may
turn away from environmental ca
reers altogether.
Thomas Jorling, a former EPA of
ficial now teaching at Williams Col
lege, concedes that the adminis
tration is sending negative signals to
once and future environmentalists.
As if a gutted EPA weren't sufficiently
discouraging for aspiring pro
fessionals, harsh administration poli
cies are sure to leave many dedicated
environmentalists feeling burned
and turned off to public service.
While directors of university en
vironmental programs are still
assessing the impact of the Reagan
era, students are being forced to re
consider their chances in the en
vironmental field. With potential re
ductions of up to 75 percent in EPA
research aid to university programs,
it seems only an understatement for
