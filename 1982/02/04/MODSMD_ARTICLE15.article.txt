## New Federalism pulled out of 15- year-old hat 
### 
The "New Federalism." We've
heard it for more than a week now,
and we'll be hearing it for a long
time. Not too bad, really. Think how
cleanly it will fit into the tables of
contents of history textbooks yet to
be written: "The New Deal of the
'30s" . . . "The New Frontier of the
'60s" ... "The New Federalism of the
'80s." Some White House speech
writer smiled and smiled when he
thought of the "New Federalism."
And jusfwfiat is it, this New Feder
alism? On the most obvious level, it
means that the national government
will take full charge of Medicaid
while giving responsibility for 40 ma
jor programs, including some of our
most basic social services, to the indi
vidual states.
That fits within the boundsof "fed
eralism," a generously vague term.
But is it "new?" Only to those who
reckon history from about 1965. The
federal bureaucracy that Reagan
tonguelashes so regularly took on its
stature because single states were
unable to take care of their own dur
ing the Depression and, on a selec
tive basis, were unwilling to do so 20
years later.
That later era, too, had a catchy
phrase that said less than it meant. It
was "States' Rights." That translated,
in the 19505, to the right of Deep
South states to maintain a two-tier so
ciety based plainly on skin color.
The South gets kicked around reg
ularly in these discussions because its
images — Bull Connors' attack dogs
and fire hoses, James Meredith
writhing in pain on an Oxford, Mis
sissippi street — cling so stubbornly
to our brains. But Dixie hardly has a
corner on bigotry or class op
pression; every northern city has
walking wounded who destroy that
old myth. Any given state is just about
as likely to turn away from its
neediest people as any other. In the
coming years of the New Federalism
some, or many, of them will.
Why should this be? After all David
Stockman said last week, "the same
electorate that chooses congressmen
and senators elect governors and
state legislators." Is there any con
clusive reason to believe that na
tional leaders are any nobler, more
humane, more plugged in to the
Higher Good than those who run the

states?
I can't think of any. Nor can I pick
apart the Reagan logic that local
agencies have a better under
standing than distant ones of local
problems. More to the point is how
they use that understanding.
We ought not to be diverted.into
psychological or philosophical in
quiries, because the problem is polit
ical. A prominent congressman with
a free-spending reputation told jour
nalist Bill Moyers last week that in his
days as a state legislator he'd rather
run "with a morals chargearound my
neck" than on a record that showed
support for tax increases.
But as of 1990, when the New Fed
eralism's transitional "trust fund"
disappears, state tax increases will be
the only way that programs like food
stamps and Aid to Families with De
pendent Children can be financed. If
we believe Moyers' source that it was
hard to support tax increases for
roads and police and fire depart
ments back in the days of relative
plenty, can we really expect politi
cians of the Jarvis-Gann Age to go to
the mat for unorganized and voice
less minorities?
Their existence is tenuous enough
as wards of a national government
that must make some concessions to
world standards of compassion and
humanity. Now their fate is passing
into the hands of a few dozen men
and women who are bound, by stat
ue or campaign promise, to cut back
the size of state budgets.
All of this, of course, isspeculation.
I hope, assuming that we have to
swallow the New Federalism, that it
turns out to be faulty speculation,
that lawmakers in all 50 states, D.C.,
Puerto Rico, Guam, and whatever
else is out there will tap un
discovered reserves of wisdom and
compassion, and take care of their
respective needy.
But as soon as we leave the narrow
ly-defined area of "human" services,
we find unambiguous evidence that
when the federal government throws
off certain responsibilities, no one
will be there to catch them. The
power mandated by the Endangered
Species Act, for example, would fall
to individual states under the New
Federalism. Last month we had an
early taste of what that means. The

federal government announced that
it wants to give Minnesota the re
sponsibility of caring for its 1200 tim
berwolves. If that happens, Minne
sota officials said, they would remove
the animal from the Threatened
Species List and let hunters kill about
160 each year.
In a similar way, the New Federal
ism could abet the demolition of the
Environmental Protection Agency
that seems to have begun. Each state
would set its own pollution standards
— who has a better right, after all, to
monitor a state's ecological health
than its residents?
But many believe that this do-it
yourself regulation will set off a kind
of cesspool auction, where states
would undercut each others' en
vironmental standards to entice pol
luting industries to settle within their
boundaries. The same kind of down
bidding, transferred to the currency
of corporate taxes, would slice away
at the revenues needed to support
the social programs we've just dis

cussed.
All this is fine if you believe that
Minnesotans should have the last
word on whether timberwolves
should exist in Minnesota, or that the
people of the state of Industriana
should do exactly what they please
with Industrianan rivers, skies and
pasturelands. But state boundaries
are lines that we have drawn for our
own obscure purposes; they have
nothing to do with the lives of tim
berwolves or ecosystems.
The lines clearly shouldn't de
termine which Americans will be
protected against the worst ravages
of poverty and racism and which will
be abandoned. In spite of Reagan's
indifference to the nation's poor, he
is politically unable to cut them off al
together. Unless, of course, he can
subcontract the job to the hard
pressed states according to the
guidelines of the New Federalism.

The "New Federalism." We've
heard it for more than a week now,
and we'll be hearing it for a long
time. Not too bad, really. Think how
cleanly it will fit into the tables of
contents of history textbooks yet to
be written: "The New Deal of the
'30s" . . . "The New Frontier of the
'60s" ... "The New Federalism of the
'80s." Some White House speech
writer smiled and smiled when he
thought of the "New Federalism."
And jusfwfiat is it, this New Feder
alism? On the most obvious level, it
means that the national government
will take full charge of Medicaid
while giving responsibility for 40 ma
jor programs, including some of our
most basic social services, to the indi
vidual states.
That fits within the boundsof "fed
eralism," a generously vague term.
But is it "new?" Only to those who
reckon history from about 1965. The
federal bureaucracy that Reagan
tonguelashes so regularly took on its
stature because single states were
unable to take care of their own dur
ing the Depression and, on a selec
tive basis, were unwilling to do so 20
years later.
That later era, too, had a catchy
phrase that said less than it meant. It
was "States' Rights." That translated,
in the 19505, to the right of Deep
South states to maintain a two-tier so
ciety based plainly on skin color.
The South gets kicked around reg
ularly in these discussions because its
images — Bull Connors' attack dogs
and fire hoses, James Meredith
writhing in pain on an Oxford, Mis
sissippi street — cling so stubbornly
to our brains. But Dixie hardly has a
corner on bigotry or class op
pression; every northern city has
walking wounded who destroy that
old myth. Any given state is just about
as likely to turn away from its
neediest people as any other. In the
coming years of the New Federalism
some, or many, of them will.
Why should this be? After all David
Stockman said last week, "the same
electorate that chooses congressmen
and senators elect governors and
state legislators." Is there any con
clusive reason to believe that na
tional leaders are any nobler, more
humane, more plugged in to the
Higher Good than those who run the

states?
I can't think of any. Nor can I pick
apart the Reagan logic that local
agencies have a better under
standing than distant ones of local
problems. More to the point is how
they use that understanding.
We ought not to be diverted.into
psychological or philosophical in
quiries, because the problem is polit
ical. A prominent congressman with
a free-spending reputation told jour
nalist Bill Moyers last week that in his
days as a state legislator he'd rather
run "with a morals chargearound my
neck" than on a record that showed
support for tax increases.
But as of 1990, when the New Fed
eralism's transitional "trust fund"
disappears, state tax increases will be
the only way that programs like food
stamps and Aid to Families with De
pendent Children can be financed. If
we believe Moyers' source that it was
hard to support tax increases for
roads and police and fire depart
ments back in the days of relative
plenty, can we really expect politi
cians of the Jarvis-Gann Age to go to
the mat for unorganized and voice
less minorities?
Their existence is tenuous enough
as wards of a national government
that must make some concessions to
world standards of compassion and
humanity. Now their fate is passing
into the hands of a few dozen men
and women who are bound, by stat
ue or campaign promise, to cut back
the size of state budgets.
All of this, of course, isspeculation.
I hope, assuming that we have to
swallow the New Federalism, that it
turns out to be faulty speculation,
that lawmakers in all 50 states, D.C.,
Puerto Rico, Guam, and whatever
else is out there will tap un
discovered reserves of wisdom and
compassion, and take care of their
respective needy.
But as soon as we leave the narrow
ly-defined area of "human" services,
we find unambiguous evidence that
when the federal government throws
off certain responsibilities, no one
will be there to catch them. The
power mandated by the Endangered
Species Act, for example, would fall
to individual states under the New
Federalism. Last month we had an
early taste of what that means. The

federal government announced that
it wants to give Minnesota the re
sponsibility of caring for its 1200 tim
berwolves. If that happens, Minne
sota officials said, they would remove
the animal from the Threatened
Species List and let hunters kill about
160 each year.
In a similar way, the New Federal
ism could abet the demolition of the
Environmental Protection Agency
that seems to have begun. Each state
would set its own pollution standards
— who has a better right, after all, to
monitor a state's ecological health
than its residents?
But many believe that this do-it
yourself regulation will set off a kind
of cesspool auction, where states
would undercut each others' en
vironmental standards to entice pol
luting industries to settle within their
boundaries. The same kind of down
bidding, transferred to the currency
of corporate taxes, would slice away
at the revenues needed to support
the social programs we've just dis

cussed.
All this is fine if you believe that
Minnesotans should have the last
word on whether timberwolves
should exist in Minnesota, or that the
people of the state of Industriana
should do exactly what they please
with Industrianan rivers, skies and
pasturelands. But state boundaries
are lines that we have drawn for our
own obscure purposes; they have
nothing to do with the lives of tim
berwolves or ecosystems.
The lines clearly shouldn't de
termine which Americans will be
protected against the worst ravages
of poverty and racism and which will
be abandoned. In spite of Reagan's
indifference to the nation's poor, he
is politically unable to cut them off al
together. Unless, of course, he can
subcontract the job to the hard
pressed states according to the
guidelines of the New Federalism.
