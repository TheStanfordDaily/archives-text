# Letter
## Stanford Country Club 
### 
William Hansen's letter (Daily Feb.
2) smacks of the same apathy and
conservatism that meets most novel
ideas on this campus.
First, the crucial nature of the
threat of nuclear weapons was
missed. To us, isolated in this heaven
of academic illusion, the idea of a
"demonstration" explosion is un
thinkable. Yet, as it creeps into the
speeches of the Reagan adminis
tration, its reality becomes more
clear. By extension, a nuclear ex
change is even less plausible. Again,
this possibility becomes more en
trenched with each revised casualty
count.
Secondly, the impressions of the
University affiliates and the general
public seem to hold some all-pow
erful mystique. God forbid the out
side world might disapprove and our
reputation mighi suffer! At least our
opinions might spark debate. While
wo Stanford students were immersed
in the mascot controversy, millions of
people, many of them students,

demonstrated against nuclear arms
in Europe. Had they been concerned
with bad impressions, perhaps noth
ing would have happened.
Finally, the error of dorm politics
was gravely overstated. The evoca
tion of Alexis de Tocqueville caution
ing against the raising of a dorm ban
ner is ridiculous. Tocqueville praised
the strength of American democracy
found in small groups. Certainly, a
dorm fits this description.
By suggesting that a dorm is an in
appropriate place for political de
bate, Hansen imposes an even
greater threat to our democracy: the
tyranny of the apathetic. Action was
urged: to do something asa group by
voicing our opinions.
Of course it is easier to live in a po
litically sterile, insulated Stanford
Country Club where issues are re
legated to the extreme fringes. But,
too, a more dangerous choice.
