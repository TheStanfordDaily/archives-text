# Bradbury urges revival of idealism
## 
### Heather Milllar Senior staff writer 
Science fiction writer, novelist and
poet Ray Bradbury, urged a packed
house at Kresge Auditorium last
night to remember the accomplish
ments of the past and press on with
the same vitality into the future.
"We need a rebirth of idealism .. .
to care about ourselves god
dammit!" Bradbury is the fourth
speaker in the ASSU Winter Writer
Series.
Bradbury said despite the spectres
which haunt us â€” nuclear war, infla
tion, crime and pollution, "The race
doesn't have to die, because we
don't deserve it. We're too good for
that. That's what space travel is all

about." Bradbury predicted a day
when man, with all his ideas, would
reach out to Alpha Centauri or some
other distant sun, and "live among
the stars forever."
Bradbury recalled his appearance
on a British television broadcast
hosted by David Frost the same night
man first walked on the moon. Frost
preempted the discussion on the
moon walk with Bradbury when he
aired Englebert Humperdinck, Sam
my Davis Jr., and talk of "the Tup
perware fall-out," the spin-offs gen
erated by NASA technology.
Bradbury said at the time he
thought, "How long has it taken us to
get to the moon? Five billion years!
Tonight we reach up and touch the

moon and you refuse to celebrate?
To hell with you! To hell with you!"
Last night's audience of more than
500 responded to this closing remark
with a standing ovation.
The author of The Martian
Chronicles, Faranheit 451, the
screenplay for Moby Dick and other
works, Bradbury attributed the
length and quality of his resume to"a
life of loves that cycled and fulfilled
themselves"
"I haven't changed one iota since I
was the 6-year-old kid who fell in
love with dinosaurs. . . Flash Gordon
. . . Prince Valiant. . .Bradbury ex
plained.
