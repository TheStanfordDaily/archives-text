Stanford scholar Anderson to
quit Reagan administration post
with staff reports
Washington â€” Martin Anderson, a prominent member of the Reagan
inner circle and one of the administration's most outspoken conserva

A statement released by W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover
Institution, said, "My colleagues and I are pleased that Martin Anderson

Anderson, 45, whose resignation is scheduled to be announced to
day, was praised by White House counselor Edwin Meese III as "the
conscience of the administration."
His departure is certain to spark new concerns among conservatives
who believe that ideologically loyal supporters of the administration are
being eliminated systematically by a pragmatic faction headed by White
House chief of staff James Baker.
But high-level administration sources said last night that Anderson is
leaving at his own initiative and largely for personal reasons, not be

"Marty wants out."
The Hoover Institution has been one of the bastions of intellectual
support for the Reagan administration. Anderson, who took leave from
the Institution to work for candidate Reagan in 1979 is pre-eminent
among the five Hoover Institution fellows with full-time, White House
based government positions. Twenty-four other Hoover scholars cur

Although Anderson will return to Hoover, he is not completely sever

ing a book about the political movements that led to the Reagan presi
dency, he said. His wife, Annelise Anderson, also an economist and au
thor, will remain as a deputy to David Stockman, director of the Office
