Stanford scholar Anderson to
quit Reagan administration post
with staff reports
Washington — Martin Anderson, a prominent member of the Reagan
inner circle and one of the administration's most outspoken conserva
tives, will quit as director of the White House Office of Policy Develop
ment and return to his post as senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, Anderson said yesterday.
A statement released by W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover
Institution, said, "My colleagues and I are pleased that Martin Anderson
is returning to the Hoover Institution after three years of very fine ser
vice with the president."
Anderson, 45, whose resignation is scheduled to be announced to
day, was praised by White House counselor Edwin Meese III as "the
conscience of the administration."
His departure is certain to spark new concerns among conservatives
who believe that ideologically loyal supporters of the administration are
being eliminated systematically by a pragmatic faction headed by White
House chief of staff James Baker.
But high-level administration sources said last night that Anderson is
leaving at his own initiative and largely for personal reasons, not be
cause of any policy dispute. One high official said it was simply that
"Marty wants out."
The Hoover Institution has been one of the bastions of intellectual
support for the Reagan administration. Anderson, who took leave from
the Institution to work for candidate Reagan in 1979 is pre-eminent
among the five Hoover Institution fellows with full-time, White House
based government positions. Twenty-four other Hoover scholars cur
rently serve the administration in one capacity or another.
Although Anderson will return to Hoover, he is not completely sever
ing his ties with Washington. He will spend much of his time there writ
ing a book about the political movements that led to the Reagan presi
dency, he said. His wife, Annelise Anderson, also an economist and au
thor, will remain as a deputy to David Stockman, director of the Office
of Management and Budget.
Anderson is not abandoning the adminis
tration either. The president, who earlier this
week asked him to stay, will appoint his long
time supporter to the Economic Policv Advisory
Board and the Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board, an unusual dual responsibility
Anderson said he also expects to serve as a
consultant to the administration on other spe
cific issues.
"It sounds as if he's going to be commuting a
lot," George Marotta, public affairs coordinator
for the Institution, said. He said Hoover scholars
can be in residence at Stanford or live
elsewhere and do their research or writing
there.
Anderson is known as a conservative with a
strong libertarian streak. The latter was
nurtured bv occasional visits to the home of au
thor Avn Rand, whose novels glorified a moral
philosophv based on individualism, in the late
19605. He is known to oppose government in
tervention on any issue, a stance which some
times brought him into conflict with the New
Right.
He was an architect of the proposal in the
Nixon administration for the all-volunteer
Army. Within the Reagan administration he was
one of the few White House insiders to oppose
the proposal for new excise taxes, which the
president rejected after a long internal struggle.
But Anderson also was on the losing side of
several issues, such as when he opposed limits
on Japanese auto imports, limits which Reagan
accepted under the euphemism of "voluntary
restraints."
JFK also made tapes
Washington — Former President John F. Ken
nedy secretly recorded about 600 of his White
House meetings and telephone conversations
during the last 16 months of his presidency —
apparently without the knowledge of other par
ticipants.
It has been known for several years that Ken
nedy recorded some meetings and phone con
versations from his White House days but the
extent of the recordings, the names of the par
ticipants and the subject matters have never
been disclosed.
A log obtained bv The Washington Post from
the Kennedy Library in Boston shows the rec
ordings were made from July, 1962 until Ken
nedy's assassination. The tapes contain a vast
amount of unreleased information, including
many highly classified meetings of the National
Security Council on such subjects as the Cuban
missile crisis, Berlin and Vietnam and high-level
discussions of domestic controversies such as
the 1962 integration of the University of Missis
sippi.
The Post has previously requested access to
the tapes but it has been denied because of clas
sification and privacy considerations. Dan Fenn,
director of the library, said that some of the
tapes and transcripts will be made available in
the near future.
"It is bound to become the primary source on
how John F. Kennedy's mind worked," Fenn
said.
The disclosure of a secret Oval Office taping
system maintained by President Richard Nixon
became a sensational element in the Watergate

scandal. At least two other presidents, Lyndon
Johnson and Franklin Roosevelt, also taped
private conversations in the White House.
More killing in El Salvador
San Salvador — The Salvadoran army has
asked the U.N. human rights commission to
send a delegation to a small northern town in
which it claims leftist guerrillas massacred more
than 150 civilians, a spokesman said yesterday.
The spokesman, who asked not to be identi
fied, said the death toll at Nueva Trinidad near
the Honduran border was between 150and 200.
"The communist attackers dedicated them
selves to killing, to butchery, to exterminating
the population, and thev killed children, wom
en and men — even animals," he said.
The military, too, lias been accused of brutali
t\ recently. There were unconfirmed reports
that government troops massacred as many as
1000 civilians during a December offensive in
Morazan province, long considered a guerrilla
stronghold.
Guerrillas invited reporters from U.S. news
papers to view the areas of the alleged govern
ment massacres. The reporters said bodies had
been left out in the open for days, apparently so
they could be shown to the reporters.
The military has denied new charges that
troops killed innocent civilians in the capital.
The charges and countercharges came within
days of President Ronald Reagan's announce
ment that El Salvador's U.S.-supported civilian
military junta was making progress on human
rights. The step was necessary to clear millions
of dollars in U.S. aid to this beleaguered Central
-\merican nation where the struggle between
the left and the right has killed more than 35,000
people in three years.
The army's account of the weekend guerrilla
action in Nueva Trinidad, a town of about 260
people in northeastern Chalatenango prov
ince, said accounts of the number of attackers
varied from hundreds to thousands.
Journalists who visited the scene said they
saw about one dozen bodies and several de
stroyed homes.
Earlier, Defense Ministry spokesman Col.
Eusebio Coto said survivors saw supposed left
wing guerrillas drag between 100 and 150 peo
ple from their homes at gunpoint and shoot
them to death.
Brezhnev rejects'linkage'
Moscow — In a new appeal to the Reagan ad
ministration, Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev
yesterday urged "patient, constructive talks" to
limit the growth of nuclear weapons.
He also rejected Washington's decision to
link the resumption of Soviet-American
strategic arms limitation talks with other aspects
of international relations, saying "diplomacy
requires denouements and not linkages."
Brezhnev offered a more specific plan of
what the Soviet Union was willing to accept at
the medium-range nuclear missile talks be
tween American and Soviet negotiators in Ge
neva. But a Western expert said his proposals
differed little from earlier Soviet ideas rejected
bv the West.
Brezhnev said the Soviet Union is prepared to
agree not to have any type of medium-range

nuclear weapons, Soviet or Western, "aimed at
targets in Europe." Failing agreement on that,
he said the Soviet Union was willing to support a
one-third reduction by 1990 of medium-range
nuclear weapons of both sides and was ready to
reduce unilaterally a number of Soviet SS-20
medium-range missiles stationed in the western
part of the Soviet Union.
The V\ est claims that the Soviets enjoy an ad
vantage over the West in medium-range mis
siles in Europe, and that Soviet proposals seek to
preserve Moscow's edge. The Soviets argue
there is a nuclear balance in Europe.
Brezhnev 's remarks about linkage seemed a
response to recent comments by U.S. Secretary
of State Alexander Haig.
Haig said Tuesday that he told Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko last week during
their meeting in Geneva that a constructive re
lationship with the United States can only be
based "on greater Soviet restraint, especially in
the use of force or the threat of violence."
The United States put off anv decision to re
sume strategic arms negotiations with the Sovi
ets in reaction to what was perceived in Wash
ington as the Kremlin's instigation of the decla
ration of martial law in Poland.
Pilots knew of ice on wings
Washington — The cockpit voice tape from
the Air Florida jetliner that crashed into the
Potomac River three weeks ago strongly sug
gests that the pilots took off even though they
knew that ice or snow was on the plane's wings,
sources close to the investigation said Wednes
day.
Preliminary transcripts show that the pilot
and copilot commented to each other re
peatedly on the heaw snow falling on Jan. 13 as
they taxied to the runway. Their words suggest
that at one point they peered out cockpit win
dows specifically to check for ice or snow on
their wings, noted that there was some, but
took off anyway, one source said.
Yesterday night, officials at the Naiional
Transportation Safety Board, which is heading
the investigation, declined to comment on the
contents of the cockpit tape, saying it is still
being studied.
Stocks down
The stock market turned downward yester
dav under the pressure of continued interest
rate worries.
Analysts noted that the market was able to
stabilize Tuesday after a selloff the day before
that drove the Dow Jones industrial average
down 19.41 points.
They said traders were still cautiously await
ing the outcome of the federal government's
quarterly sale of intermediate-and long-term
debt securities this week.
Handy & Harman posted gold at $378.00 and
silver at $8,200 per ounce.
