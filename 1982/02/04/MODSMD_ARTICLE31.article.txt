# What is the Career Center anyway?
## 
### 
Although only you can be
the driving force behind your
job search, you can take advan
tage of the on-campus support
services available to the Stan
ford community. The Career
Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) is one informa
tion outlet to check into.
Located in the middle of the
campus next to the bookstore,
the CPPC provides students
with a number of valuable ser
vices which make the job

searching process that much
easier.
The programs offered to
CPPC registrants include:
* Career counseling by ap
pointment with the advisors of
the CPPC staff. In addition,
peer counselors are available to
assist in the clarification of
career goals, resource dis
coveries, and job search or
ganization. Counselors are
helpful in the exploration of
career paths and job oppor

tunities.
* Career planning prog
rams. These programs listed in
the calendar, are designed to
bridge the gap which exists be
tween students in the academic
community and the world of
work. Topics for discussion in
clude the company or organi
zation itself, the career field in
general, and job-hunting ad
vice. More complete informa
tion about programs can be
found in the lobby area of the

CPPC. Inquire at the main re
ception desk for announce
ments of future programs.
* Special workshops and
seminars. Throughout the
academic year, the CPPC staff
offers a series of small weekly
workshops designed to intro
duce students to the career
planning and job hunting pro
cess. The four part sequence
includes sessions on self
assessment, resume writing,
interviewing, and job-search
techniques. Sign up for any or
all of these workshops one
week in advance in the CPPC
lobby. Mock interviews with
CPPC staff using audio-visual
equipment are also available.
* Job opportunity informa
tion. The CPPC has weekly job
lists in the following areas: lib
eral arts, secondary and
elementary teaching, and sci
ence and engineering. Part
time and summer job notices as
well as internship listings are
posted on bulletin boards and
in notebooks in the Student
Employment Office within the
CPPC.
If you are in need of more
extensive job-hunting informa
tion (writing resumes and
cover letter, interviewing, de
termining career goals) the
CPPC has a number of pam
phlets, books and printed
materials designed for this
purpose in addition to career
information in a number of
fields.
Use the resources available
at the CPPC to help facilitate
your successful job search
soon.

Careers is presented as an advertis
ing supplement to the Stanford
Daily brought to you in cooperation
with the Career Planning and
Placement Center.
