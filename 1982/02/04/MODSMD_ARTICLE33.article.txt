Because there is no longer
any guarantee that a college
degree (even from a prestigious
university), will land you a job
in your field upon graduation,
the internship concept is fast
becoming a viable option for
many students.
Each June, employers are in
undated with applications
from college graduates with
solid academic credentials.
The most successful applicants
(according to employers), are
those whose backgrounds also
reflect some relevant work ex
perience.
An internship enables the
student to obtain the practical
experience that ultimately
gives one the edge in the cur
rently tight job market.
In addition, interning in a
professional work situation
will allow you to "reality test"
various career areas, while

simultaneously getting experi
ence, training, good references,
and a possible "in" to the field
upon graduation.
Employers are also increas
ingly interested in the intern
ship concept, which is another
reason' interning is on the in
crease. Business and industry
have found that interns are
motivated, enthusiastic, and
capable workers who can pro
vide high-quality project assis
tance, or otherwise backstop
their permanent staffs on
necessary assignments. Interns
are a good business invest
ment.
What exactly is an intern
ship? It is generally a job of li
mited duration (usually three,
six or nine months) which
permits undergraduate and
graduate students to work
within an organization in a
pre-professional capacity fre

quently related to the student's
academic field.
Internships are most often of
fered during the summer
months, although other ar
rangements are also available.
Interns may work full or part
time, depending on the needs
of the employers, and compen
sation is usually in the form of
direct salary (often quite good)
or academic credit.
