# Successful resumes

### 
Although sometimes know
ing the right people and being
in the right place at the right
time can land you the job of
your dreams, coincidence is
not the only determining factor
in a successful job search.
There are some factors you can
control.
The resume is one method to
maximize your chances of find
ing the job you want. It will
provide the first impression to
prospective employers and act
as a key to open the door for an
interview. In short, think of the
resume as an advertisement for
yourself.
A good resume should in
clude enough personal infor
mation to identify yourself and
the best ways of contacting
you, as well as a brief statement
of job objectives, an account of
your college education, and a
summary of your work history.
Also include any additional in
formation which might pro
vide favorable insights into
your accomplishments and in
terests.
A chronological resume,
which is most appropriate for
students, is the most tradi
tional and acceptable to
employers. To construct a suc
cessful resume, follow these
basic steps:

1. Before attempting to write a
resume, list all activities,
work experiences (paid and
volunteer), hobbies, travels
and projects. Then describe
the responsibilities, assess
what you accomplished,
name the skills required, and
consider what you liked and
disliked about each. This as
sessment will facilitate your
choice of which items to in
clude in the actual resume.
2. In the resume itself, include
your name, address (both
present and permanent) and
phone number. Keep your
resume current by updating
it whenever necessary.
3. Next concentrate on for
mulating a job objective.
Focus on the immediate job
objective rather than the
long-range career goal and
avoid generalities. A concise
job objective enables the
employer to know what op
portunities interest you and
to evaluate your candidacy
in terms of possible open
ings within his/her organiza
tion.
4. When listing education, in
clude all institutions at
tended beyond high school,
dates, degrees held, and
major areas of study. These
items, as well as the work
experience information,

should be listed in reverse
chronological order. Don't
hesitate to add any course
work in your summary of
educational background
which relates to the job ob
jective.
5. In enumerating your work
experience, be sure to in
clude dates, employers, ti
tles, responsibilities and ac
complishments. Concen
trate on the positive and use
active verbs in the past tense
when stating what you did.
Summer, military, part-time
and volunteer experience
count too!
6. Include any other relevant
factors which might reflect
your positive attributes as a
job applicant. Good choices
might be membership on
committees, honorary
societies, publications,
travels, extracurricular ac
tivities and hobbies.
Remember, the information
you choose to include in the
resume and the manner in
which you arrange the material
on the page can determine your
opportunity to interview for
the position you want. Pay at
tention to every word, and you
can really help decrease the
variable factors in your job
search.
