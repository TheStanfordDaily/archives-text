Movies. And don't miss the
15-minute introduction to the
CPPC, its services, and the
topic of career planning. It's a
videotape shown every Mon

the CPPC reception room.
Bring a friend!
Appointments. Sign up to
talk to a CPPC or one of the
eight Peer Counselor and start
to make a thoughtful career
search plan. They're available
for counseling and discussions
on any career-related manner.

Library. Not Meyer or Green,
but the CPPC's very own col
lection. The CPPC library con
tains liberal arts resources
ranging from books to tapes to
directories on several career
areas which you can begin to
investigate. Stop by and learn
about the volumes for yourself
at the CPPC office.
