# New recruiting procedures here
## 
### 
Liberal arts seniors who ob
erved (or at least heard about)
heearly-morning lines in front
112 the CPPC last year will be
elieved as June approaches
hat there is a new system for
igning up for on-campus in
erviews.
Long lines by 8 a.m. were
ommon when many students
waited to sign up for inter
iews with popular com
lanies. The new procedure
vill eliminate the lines by re
luiring students to bid points
or space on recruiting
ichedules. Each student re
vives a fixed number of points
it the beginning of the year.
Those students bidding the
highest number of points for a
certain company will get the
interviews.
The CPPC staff hopes that
this method has made on
campus interviewing accessi
ble to more liberal arts stu
dents. It should enable all in
terested students to talk with at
least some of the organizations
in which they have the greatest
interest. These features make
the bidding system a signific
ant improvement in the recruit
ing program.
Everyone who would like to
take part in on-campus recruit

ing should stop by the CPPC for
a registration packet and for
more information about
scheduling interviews.
The CPPC] staff stresses that
it's not too late to get involved
in the bid system recruiting
program. Registrants will still
receive the same number of
alottod bid points if they regis
ter this quarter or next. Because
February is the peak recruiting
month at Stanford, interested
students are urged to sign up
now, however.
Although the CPPC has re
ceived no formal feedback from
students on the success of their
new program, most individu
als who have registered have
been positive about the system.
The center hopes to conduct a
formal survey at the end of
winter quarter to poll response
in preparation for next year and
to discover suggestions for im
proving the program.
Recruiters visiting the cam
pus have also responded favor
ably to the bid system concept.
While the program does not af
fect them directly, they feel the
students are better able to con
duct successful interviews
when they are not rushed to
complete them.
