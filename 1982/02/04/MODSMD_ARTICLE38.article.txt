# Questions for you
## 
### 
Many thoughtful job seekers
have found informational in
terviewing a useful and effec
tive part of a successful
employment search.
Going out into the commun
ity and talking with profes
sionals about their career fields
is a logical step to take after
you've done some research on
the job market and have some
what of an idea of the kinds of
jobs or fields you'd be in
terested in pursuing. Informa
tional interviewing differs
from employment interview

ing in that you're the one con
ducting the interview. It can be
very useful â€” you get the
chance to learn about a specific
career area by asking your own
questions, and by observing
work environments.
While the major purpose of
this type of interviewing is in
formation gathering, students
have sometimes been surprised
with subsequent job offers.
Also, the person you interview
can provide you with names of
others in the same line of work
whom you can contact.

Yet, the reason you conduct
the career information inter
view is to obtain information,
not to ask for a job. The ap
proach you take in a job inter
view is quite different from that
of an informational interview.
In the job interview you are try
ing to sell yourself. In an in
formation interview you only
want to learn about a field and
make a decision as to whether
it is a viable career for you.
Ask good questions, get full
information, and you will be
able to make a better decision
as to whether or not to pursue a
particular field as a career pos
sibility. Remember, your job
objective is to learn as much as
you can. To accomplish this in
as short a time as possible, pre
pare a written list of questions.
Some possible suggestions in
clude:
l.ln the position you now
hold, what do you do on a
typical day?
2. What are the most interest
ing aspects of your job?
3. What part of your work do
you consider dull or re
petitious?
4. What are the prerequisites
for jobs in this field?
5. How long does it usually
take to move from one step to
the next in this career path?
These questions are only
suggestions and may not apply
to every interview. Make up
your own questions, if you
wish, to suit each interview, or
use a combination of these
questions and your own.
Informational interviewing
and making contacts or "net
working," whether you do it
through the Alumni Contract
Service or by talking with
friends of your parents, should
help you be more selective
about the jobs you apply for
and give you a better shot at
those fields, too.
