# Storey House ready by spring
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
A completely renovated Storey House will be ready
for student occupancy spring quarter, two years and
almost $2 million after fire destroyed much of the ex
isting structure in March 1980.
Sigrid Rupp, of Sigrid Rupp 'vrchitects, redesigned
everything but the shell ol the building, originally
built in the 1900.
Storey House will temporarily be designated a non
theme, coeducational row house. The house's future
residential use will the same status as 353 May
field (formerly Psi house), said Diana Con
klin, assistant dean presidential education.
Residents moving in this spring will not be guaran
teed returning residence priority for fall 1982. "Proba
bly the house will be coed next year, but we're not
surr> yer," said Norm Robinson, dean of residential
education.
"Right now the draw (choice lists) does not support
an additional all women's house," Conklin said.
Before the fire, Storey had been one of two all
female row houses on campus. Roth House remains
the only all female house.
"We're considering the house as part of the pack

age of new housing (being built on the western edge
of the campus near Lagunita Court)," Conklin said.
"We're not oven soliciting proposals for new (status)
programs until Winter 1983."
The new Storey House has been enlarged to ac
commodate 44 residents, including two new doubles
on the ground floor designated specifically for stu
dents confined to wheel chairs.
"The new house provides a perfect place for wheel
chair students. It's a great central location and the
ramp (at the back of the house) from the Tresidder
parking lot provides easy access to the house," Con
klin said.
"It's the first time we've been able to help handi
capped students before the fact. Always before we've
had to work around existing housing," she said.
The old house had spaces for 39 residents and no
specially designed areas for handicapped students. A
previous plan for an elevator to facilitate handi
capped student access to the house's upper floors
proved economically unfeasible at this time, she said.
Conklin said she is unsure of the exact number of
students confined to wheelchairs on campus at this
time, but she estimated there are about five. Those
