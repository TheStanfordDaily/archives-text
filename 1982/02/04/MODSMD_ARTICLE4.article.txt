# Storey House ready by spring
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
A completely renovated Storey House will be ready
for student occupancy spring quarter, two years and
almost $2 million after fire destroyed much of the ex
isting structure in March 1980.
Sigrid Rupp, of Sigrid Rupp 'vrchitects, redesigned
everything but the shell ol the building, originally
built in the 1900.
Storey House will temporarily be designated a non
theme, coeducational row house. The house's future
residential use will the same status as 353 May
field (formerly Psi house), said Diana Con
klin, assistant dean presidential education.
Residents moving in this spring will not be guaran
teed returning residence priority for fall 1982. "Proba
bly the house will be coed next year, but we're not
surr> yer," said Norm Robinson, dean of residential
education.
"Right now the draw (choice lists) does not support
an additional all women's house," Conklin said.
Before the fire, Storey had been one of two all
female row houses on campus. Roth House remains
the only all female house.
"We're considering the house as part of the pack

age of new housing (being built on the western edge
of the campus near Lagunita Court)," Conklin said.
"We're not oven soliciting proposals for new (status)
programs until Winter 1983."
The new Storey House has been enlarged to ac
commodate 44 residents, including two new doubles
on the ground floor designated specifically for stu
dents confined to wheel chairs.
"The new house provides a perfect place for wheel
chair students. It's a great central location and the
ramp (at the back of the house) from the Tresidder
parking lot provides easy access to the house," Con
klin said.
"It's the first time we've been able to help handi
capped students before the fact. Always before we've
had to work around existing housing," she said.
The old house had spaces for 39 residents and no
specially designed areas for handicapped students. A
previous plan for an elevator to facilitate handi
capped student access to the house's upper floors
proved economically unfeasible at this time, she said.
Conklin said she is unsure of the exact number of
students confined to wheelchairs on campus at this
time, but she estimated there are about five. Those

students will be given preference in
the housing assignments, she said.
Rupp's plans included enlarging
the kitchen and dining room areas
and rebuilding many of the existing
bedrooms. But Conklin said the
charm of Storey House remains.
Rupp added features which enhance
the natural beauty of the house, she
said.
"We tried to straighten the cor
riders so they aren't quite as choppy
as they used to be. But we've tried to
preserve the individual rooms'
shapes," she said.
Other new features in the house
include: a skylight over the main
staircase, polished wooden railings,
brightly tiled bathrooms (one of
which has a skylight over the bath
tub), and a redwood sundeck on the
second floor. In addition, two new
staircases on either side of the build
ing now provide the house with
three exits.
Though work on the house is still
uncompleted, con traders plan to fin
ish and release the house for Univer
sity use by the third week of Febru
ary. "Then we can do the finishing

touches, like drapes, carpets and
furniture before the (spring) quarter
starts, " Conklin said.
The house, like the new dormitory
complex being built, has also been
equipped with the necessary wiring
and planning details to facilitate a
change to solar power when that
energy option becomes economical
ly feasible, said Conklin.
As with all University housing,
spring quarter residents will be
chosen through the combination of
their housing draw assignment
number last spring and their current
number on the housing waiting list.
The single student housing office
estimates 20 to 50 people have signed
up for Storey House since the notice
of its opening was announced in the
Daily beginning last week, said Mario
Acquesta of the Undergraduate
Housing Office.
But this estimate does not reflect
the number of students who have re
arranged their housing choices to in
clude Storey, he said.
"We can't keep records enough
updated to give specific numbers.
The housing lists are alphabetical by
name, not by indivdual residence,"
he said.
The initial round of the spring
housing draw will be in early March.
