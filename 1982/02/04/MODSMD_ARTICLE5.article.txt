Monterey â€” San Diego Mayor
Pete Wilson is not a novice in Califor
nia politics. He has run for governor
twice and lost.
Wilson, 48, was set to run again for
governor until early Field polls in
dicated he ranked third among Re
publicans behind Lt. Gov. Mike Curb
and Attorney General George Deu
kmejian. Last August, Wilson an
nounced he would seek the Re
publican nomination for the U.S.
Senate, a seat now held by S.I.
"Sam"Hayakawa.
The switch surprised many politi
cians, particularly Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park). Mc-
Closkey had been expected to an
nounce his candidacy in December.
But McCloskey told the Daily in late
September, "I was forced to an
nounce earlier because my good
friend Pete Wilson was exploiting my
unannouncement as an uncertain
ty."
The Wilson candidacy probably af
fected McCloskey's Senate campaign
more than any of the other six an
nounced Senate candidates' because
both he and Wilson are considered
political moderates. Some financial
supporters who would typically have
backed McCloskey defected to the
Wilson camp.
A November Field poll indicates
Wilson's entry also affected popular
support among the candidates. Cur
rently, the poll ranks Wilson second
in popularity, preceeded by Rep.
Barry Goldwater Jr. (R-Woodland
Hills) and followed by McCloskey.
Wilson's fundraising has not been
as successful as Goldwater's, which
had raised $950,523 by ]an. 31. Wilson
raised $580,272. However, Wilson has
spent only $247,724 compared to
G old water's expenditures of
$747,384.
Wilson was an assemblyman for
five years prior to his election as San
Diego's mayor in 1971. He was born
in Illinois, is a graduate of Yale Uni
versity and holds a law degree from
Boalt Hall at UC-Berkeley.
Politically, Wilson opposed the
U.S. sale of Airborne Warning and

Control System (AWACS) planes be
cause, he said, there was no
guarentee the AWACS wouldn't be
used against Israel. He has courted
the agricultural industry and has ap
pointed two men from that industry
to his campaign team. He also sup
ports the "Victims Bill of Rights" in
iative which calls for strengthening
law enforcement and for longer sen
tence terms for lawbreakers.
At the California Republican Con
vention in Monterey last weekend,
Wilson would not defend President
Ronald Reagan's recent State of the
Union address, rather, he said, "I'm
going to extol it and 'new federal
ism.' "
In November, Wilson hired Bob
Goodman, a political consultant and
media strategist, to coordinate his
campaign. Goodman has dubbed the

Wilson campaign "The Great Ameri
can Comeback."
"It's a comeback from fear and a
comeback to faith," Goodman told
The San Diego Tribune in November.
"I think it's called getting our pride

back, making things work, a willing
ness to lead again."
There is one comeback which
backfired on Wilson. At the October

California Republican Convention in
Palm Springs, Wilson is reported to
have lambasted McCloskey's Con
gressional attendance record, which
decreased because of McCloskey's
Senate campaign.
The tables were turned on Wilson
in Monterey. Wilson has missed 41
percent of the San Diego City Coun
cil's votes. (Under San Diego's form
of government, similar to Palo Alto's,
Wilson serves as a City Council mem
ber.)
And, recently, the publisher of a
small weekly San Diego newspaper
sued Wilson for access to the mayor's
appointment book. A San Diego Su
perior Court judge ruled that
Wilson's calender book was a public
record and that it had to be released
this week, except for matters which

are sensitive for the city.
When asked about the calender
and his voting record by reporters at
the Monterey convention, Wilson t
would only say that his Senate cam
paign had not affected his duties as
mayor. "I am a mayor and a can
didate," Wilson said. "I'm going to
be both. I will do it as I have done
before. The job gets done."
The interviews in this series were
conducted in Monterey at the Cali
fornia Republican Convention last
weekend.
