# Inside Sullivan: a public defender who takes a tough job home
## 
### Jeffrey Golden 
He compares his job to living with a
difficult lover. "You love the work,
you get addicted to it," said John Sul
livan, one of the three Santa Clara
County Public Defenders based in
Palo Alto. "But it burns you out until
sometimes you wonder why you
don't leave."
A weariness in his voice hinted that
this was one of those times. An hour
earlier Sullivan had stood before a
municipal court judge and insisted
that all standards of reasonable
search and seizure had been violated
when police took a sawed-off shot
gun, revolvers and an allegedly sto
len credit card from his client, who
was on probation from serious weap
ons charges in Santa Cruz County. It
was the last of his 10 court ap
pearances that day, each on behalf of
a different client.
None took very long. Sullivan
vvorks only in the pre-trial stages of
criminal cases, the arraignments, the
hearings to establish probable cause
for prosecution, the complex plea

bargaining discussions with prose
cutors and judges, the sentencing of
clients who plead guilty. Sullivan said
that nine cases out of 10 are settled in
these phases. The exception goes to
trial in San Jose, where another pub
lic defender takes over.
This afternoon's judge declined to
rule on whether the man with the
shotgun had been searched illegally.
He promised to read the case law that
Sullivan cited in his argument. Sul
livan and his client will return to
court in 10 days for the decision. Be
tween now and then, Sullivan will
work on more than 40 cases, each
raising different questions and
strategies.
He thinks he should handle half
that many. "The workload doesn't
make us neglect cases, but it makes
us take a lot of them home," said Sul
livan. "And it makes people like me
quit after a while. And it's people like
me who should be staying in public
defense."

Those are people who view the job as a
crucial element in a criminal justice system
that Sullivan called "sophisticated, refined,
costly, totally screwed up, and, given the al
ternatives, very, verygood."Sullivan, whol2
years ago burned his draft papers on the
steps of the Seattle Induction Center,
apologized instinctively for giving "the
straight civic-textbook line" on the judicial
system.
Then he thought of another way to phrase
his admiration, and enthusiasm outran reser
vation. "This whole Anglo-American tradi
tion, with the jury trial and all those careful
protections of the accused," he said, "is all
that guarantees the dignity of the individual.
It's the last thin line that protects him from

Sullivan sees the public
defender as the final
guardian of that line.'The
beauty of the system is that it
works by rules, not by the
whim of the
authorities/

the power of government."
Sullivan sees the public defender as the
final guardian of that line. "The beauty of the
system is that it works by rules, not by the
whim of authorities," he said. "Who makes
sure the rules get followed? The district at
torney won't do it. The judge might not do it.
They do it the right way because some
fleabitten county-paid public defender is
going to make them do it the right way. If I'm
not there they steamroll these guys. I'm the
one who gives substance to the system."Sul
livan broke off with a smile. "Listen to the
'Champion of the People.' "
This irony runs through most of what Sul
livan says about his work. The rules he is so
proud to safeguard sometimes trouble him
deeply. First among them isthe exclusionary
rule, which prohibitsthe use of any evidence
not obtained through strict and proper pro
cedure. Sullivan is certain that the ex
clusionary rule undercuts the law's powerto
deter criminals, who learn to use the techni
cal loopholes that stand between them and
punishment.
This, said Sullivan, is the high price we pay
for a system dedicated to individual liberty.
He has no doubts that the nation must pay it.
"I get some really bad child molester off," he

said, "because the cops fouled up when they
got his confession. I don't like that at all. "But
he is far more concerned with the damage
done to the system if he lets a single violation
of his clients' rights go unchallenged.
He realizes the irony. "Charles Manson,"
he said, "the very worst of the nasties, needs
the very best lawyer, because he's the guy
they most want to get, and they'll run right
over due process to do it. So at the same time
I'm fighting for some really scary guys,
there's something highly principled about
what I'm doing. I'm rendering service to the
system, not to some special group trying to
bend the system to its ends. And it has to be
done."
Sullivan sat back, thoughtful, as if his own
words had surprised him. "I have to tell
you," he went on more softly and slowly
now, "I don't think about any of this stuff
when I work. I'm thinking about Joe B.
Doakes who has a prelim day after tomorrow
and how I have to figure out exactly what was
wrong with the way the cops searched his
car. The rest of it, that 'beauty of the system,'
that's for after dinner talk after a couple of
beers."
There are some safe assumptions to make
about Joe B. Doakes, according to Sullivan.
He is, first of all, poor. The public defender's
office represents anyone charged with com
mitting a crime in the country who cannot af
ford private counsel. Sullivan guessedthat9s
percent of the county's criminal defendants
fall in that category.
" 'Crime doesn't pay.' You've heard it and
it's true," he said. "These people don't have
any money. They're stealing and ripping
people off to get by, or they're hurting peo
ple because they're squeezing and have
nothing going for them and there's no rea
son not to."
Almost as certainly, Joe Doakes is guilty of
the crime for which he is charged, or one
very much like it. He has already passed
through two vital screenings by the time Sul
livan sees him: the cop on the beat has used
his discretion to make the arrest, and the dis
trict attorney's office, using strict standards
of evidence, has decided to file charges "So
I'm not likely to get him off the hook," Sul
livan said, "except in rare cases where some
one has made a big, dumb mistake. I'm there
to prevent the oppressive sentence."
Sullivan tries to do that in a plea bargaining
process whose unwritten rules are so well
known that it amounts to a parallel, if unof
ficial, system of justice. "I'm a pro," he said.
"The judge is a pro. If the DA is a pro — and
unless he's some hot new kid trying to build
a reputation, he is — we can just go in and

settle it. I get the DA to drop the charges that
have the shakiest evidence, the counts that
he doesn't have down cold in return for a
guilty plea on the solid ones. Then I turn to
the judge and tell him all the things that
make my guy special — he just got laid off,
his sister's a nun — and get an idea of the
worst sentence we'll get. Then I'll take the
whole package back to my guy and tell him
what I think of it, whether it's the best we'll
get or to wait for something better."
How many follow his advice? "They all do.
All except for the few who say they're inno
cent all the way, and then go down hard in
trial, or the ones who say 'Hell with 'em. Let
'em take me all the way, maybe the witness
will die. I can do eight years easy as I can do
five.' " Sullivan remembers a very few clients
who pressed on against his advice and won
their jury trials. "Anything can happen at
trial," he said, "and the DA knows it. That's
why he has to give me something pretty
damn good before I'll plead my guy out."
Sullivan wishes that the dynamics of this
bargaining were better known to the "law
and order" groups that complain about re
duction and dropping of criminal charges.
He is pleased that their members come to
court and seem to want more personal in
volvement in the system, but their con
clusions bother him. "They see us drop six
out of 10 counts against a guy, but they don't
realize that the DA only traded off two he
can't possibly prove and that four are redun
dant and could carry additional sentencing
anyway."
The related theory that criminal pun
ishment is too mild makes him angry. "There

aren't lenient sentences. For God's sake, the
judges are sending kids off to state prison,
and I probably would, too. Don't get me
wrong, don't romanticize this; these guys
aren't poor little waifs looking to feed their
hungry babies. They're bad, destructive peo
ple, lots of them are, doing bad destructive
things, and they have to be punished."

'What kind of society are
we? What is this, Auschwitz?
Are we just going to
warehouse these people,
stack on top of stack? The
law and order fans want a
justice system that works,
they want more convictions,
but they don't want to pay
for it. We need more money.

But the punishment provided today in
county jail is not what Sullivan has in mind.
The facilities, he said, are so horrible that
he'd almost rather do time in state prison. He
praised Superior Court Judge David Leahy,
who has been releasing county inmates on
the grounds that the overcrowded jails sub
ject them to cruel and unusual punishment.
Sullivan loses the last of his patience when
he hears the notion that convicted criminals
should have to put up with prevailing jail
conditions.

"What kind of society are we? What is this,
Auschwitz? Are we just going to warehouse
these people, stack on top of stack? The law
and order fans want a justice system that
works, they want more convictions, but they
don't want to pay for it. We need more mon
ey. We need more DAs so they can nail guys
for the right crimes, and we need more cops
who are paid more and have more respect
for the law so they don't cut corners that let
me shoot down their cases. We need more
public defenders so every guy can feel that
he really has an attorney — they call us
'dump trucks' now, because they think we
dump them as soon as we can — and we
need more jails so there's a halfway reason
able place to send them."
Dinner was over, and we were past the few
critical beers, so Sullivan let himself drift
back to the larger view. "We have to have
the jails, but it's kidding ourselves to think
they'll make everything right. I agree with
the guy who said 'Crime is the unarticulated
politics of oppressed people.' It's really the
temperature of what's wrong, the barometer
of the whole system. We've got a society
that's cut out a whole huge class of people,
that's made sure they've got nothing to lose.
Trying to 'fight crime' is going after the
symptom. Of course it's not going to work."
Sullivan pulledthe tab off the last beerand
watched a nub of foam fill the opening.
There was no way of knowing whether he
was pondering the sociopolitical crisis loom
ing over Western civilization or the precise
location of the bag of cocaine found on the
floor of Joe Doakes' car.
