# Inside Sullivan: a public defender who takes a tough job home

He compares his job to living with a
difficult lover. "You love the work,
you get addicted to it," said John Sul
livan, one of the three Santa Clara
County Public Defenders based in
Palo Alto. "But it burns you out until
sometimes you wonder why you
don't leave."
A weariness in his voice hinted that
this was one of those times. An hour
earlier Sullivan had stood before a
municipal court judge and insisted
that all standards of reasonable
search and seizure had been violated
when police took a sawed-off shot
gun, revolvers and an allegedly sto
len credit card from his client, who
was on probation from serious weap
ons charges in Santa Cruz County. It
was the last of his 10 court ap
pearances that day, each on behalf of
a different client.
None took very long. Sullivan
vvorks only in the pre-trial stages of
criminal cases, the arraignments, the
hearings to establish probable cause
for prosecution, the complex plea

bargaining discussions with prose
cutors and judges, the sentencing of
clients who plead guilty. Sullivan said
that nine cases out of 10 are settled in
these phases. The exception goes to
trial in San Jose, where another pub
lic defender takes over.
This afternoon's judge declined to
rule on whether the man with the
shotgun had been searched illegally.
He promised to read the case law that
Sullivan cited in his argument. Sul
livan and his client will return to
court in 10 days for the decision. Be
tween now and then, Sullivan will
work on more than 40 cases, each
raising different questions and
strategies.
He thinks he should handle half
that many. "The workload doesn't
make us neglect cases, but it makes
us take a lot of them home," said Sul
livan. "And it makes people like me
quit after a while. And it's people like
me who should be staying in public
defense."
