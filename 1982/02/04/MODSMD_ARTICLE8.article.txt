## Canada tries to stay afloat...

Toronto — Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau, defending his
economic policies during a se
vere recession, placed much of
the blame for Canada's trou
bles Tuesday on the high in
terest rate policies of the Unit
ed States.
But, in an unrelenting attack
on national policies, the pre
miers of all the 10 provinces —
Conservatives as well as Social
ists — called on Trudeau to
stop following the policies of
the U.S. government and start
reducing interest rates in Cana
da no matter what happens in
the United States. Premier Al
lan Blakeney of Saskatchewan
described Canada's high in
terest rates as "perverse, unfair
to the point of being immoral."
Trudeau and the premiers
made their statements in the
opening session of a con

ference in Ottawa on the na
tional economy. After this ses
sion, which was televised na
tionally, the prime minister and
the premiers began a series of
private meetings that are ex
pected to continue until late
today.
In his explanation of the
problem, Trudeau said that the
United States, after the shock
of new worldwide oil price in
creases two years ago, "em
barked on a deliberate policy
of tight money, forcing interest
rates to levels which previously
had been unknown in history
except perhaps among a class
of lenders on the fringes of so
ciety.
"To insure continuing in
vestment in Canada, to give
reasonable protection to our
dollar," he went on, .. the
government in Canada has had
little choice but to let our in

terest rates keep pace with, in
deed sometimes exceed, those
set in the United States."
On top of this, the prime
minister said, Canada had
home-grown problems of its
own and"the policy of re
straint is based on our firm be
lief that printing more and
more money ... would unac
ceptably risk our chances of re
ducing inflation and lowering
interest rates in the longer
run. .. "
The Canadian recession,
which several premiers de
scribed as the worst in 30
years, has resulted in an un
employment rate of 8.6 per
cent just a bit under that in the
United States. The 1981 infla
tion rate of 12.5 percent and
the latest commercial bank
prime rate of 16.5 percent were
higher than those in the United
States.
