# as Mexico drowns in festivity

### Washington Post 
Tapachula, Mexico — Sever
al weeks ago, this farming town
on the hot Pacific flatlands
went wild for a day. "Mexico is
great and great is its destiny,"
giant billboards proclaimed on
the airport road where trains
and trucks lined up, blasting
their horns.
Bales of cotton, sesame seed
and coffee, stacked along the
streets, formed a guard of hon
or, and the initials of the dist
inguished visitor had been
daubed into the palm trees.
No one seemed to mind

when a convoy of buses
spewed their soot and diesel
fumes all over the starched
white uniforms of the waiting
schoolchildren. And when the
caravan reached the main
square all the marimba bands
merged into one vast tropical
orchestra.
The center of this ex
travangaza was Miguel de la
Madrid, known also as El Can
didato even though four other
people — three men and a
woman — are also running for
president of Mexico. The 47-
year-old former minister of

budget and planning is the
candidate of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, the PRI,
which has won every election
since 1929, and has virtually no
chance of losing the next.
Yet in the time-honored
tradition of the PRl's attempts
todemonstrate its popularsup
port while maintaining the im
age of a multiparty democracy
in Mexico, de la Madrid is
spending eight months — with
the government footing the
bill — campaigning for all he is
worth into the far corners of
the country.
