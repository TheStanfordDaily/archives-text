Did yon

we can find
abreast
cancer
as small as
the head of
a pin?
Hft

! You've never seen
j anything like it. . .
A nocturnal animal, it
has seven terminal
arms and occasionally
short hands, goes to
bed late five nights a
week, writes heads,
1 lays pages, makes
adlines, deadlines,
cutlines and pics, eats
pizza at night and
sometimes its own
words. It's the Daily,
your newspaper.
You could love it!
