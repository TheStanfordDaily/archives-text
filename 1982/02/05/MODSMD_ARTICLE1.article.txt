# Board to vote Monday on tuition, room and board rates
## Fee hikes of 14-17 percent proposed 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees will vote Monday on a
proposal recommending a 15.5 percent increase in
basic room and board costs for 1982-83. If adopted,
the cost of room and board next year will be $3423
— $459 more than this year.
The cost for room only, which includes Escon
dido Village, is proposed to go up 17 percent to
$1510. A full board plan would increase 14.2 per
cent — $238 more than this year — to $1913.
The proposal will be submitted by the Office of
Management and Budget, the Housing Man
agement Office, and the Office of Management
and Financial Planning.
The proposal also recommends a 15.1 percent
increase in general tuition for undergraduates.
I his represents a $1080 increase over this year and
would make tuition $8220. Medical School tuition
is slated to increase 15 percent to $9591 and Law
School tuition to go up 14.8 percent to $8370.
At a student briefing yesterday, Larry Owen, a
management associate with the Office of Man
agement and Financial Planning, said the proposal
is based on anticipated inflationary increases for
next year. Fhese include 23 percent for utilities, 12
percent for salaries, ancJ 13 percent for University
services (fire, police, personnel, accounting, etc.).
Other rising expenses are the staff benefits pool
(tuition grants for research associates — RAs —and
teaching assistants — TAs — and social security for
staff members) and undergraduate financial aid,
which is driven up by tuition.
Referring to the room and board increases, the
proposal says the "largest single influence upon
the rates for 1982-83 is the obligation to commence

paying debt service (repayment of loans) on the
new residences (the new undergraduate dorm
being built)."
During 1982-83 this debt service will amount to a
$1.7 million burden, and the following year, by
which time all 800 spaces will be occupied, the
burden will increase by an additional $2.3 million.
Director of Housing Management Edward Scoles
said the new dorm, which is being financed entire
ly bv borrowing, "puts quite a dent in things."
' \s a consequence of constructing and occupy
ing new housing, the Housing and Food Service
system is expected to incur a loss of aproximately
$750,000 in 1982-83 and $1 million in 1983-84," the
proposal says. Scoles said, "We will see a healthy
increase the following year."
I )isc ussing the proposed tuition increase, Owen
cited financial aid as a major contributor, and said
financial aid will itself increase 31 percent next
year. I imothy Warner, assistant provost in the Of
fice of Management and Budget, said that on the
average, seven cents of every tuition dollar go to
financial aid.
Warner attributed the rise to "Stanford's long
standing commitment to aid-blind admission,"
noting that Stanford is one of a shrinking group of
colleges and universities maintaining admissions
completely uninfluenced by the student's finan
cial situation. "(University President) Don Ken
nedy is committed to it, and it will continue,"
Warner added.
He said the pressure on Stanford's financial aid
program is especially heavy because of antici
pated, significant cuts in federal and state financial
aid.
Warner said this year about 4450 undergraduates

(68 percent of ihe student body) receive some sort
of financial nd. rhe total aid undergrads receive
from all sources is close to $26 million. Of the as
sistance given in addition to that amount, in grants
and scho arships, $10.7 million comes from Uni
versity funds
In graduate student issues, Warner said he ex
pects to propose increasing graduate fellowship
stipends 1/ or 18 percent, and to increase RA and
I A funds about 12 or 13 percent, which is above
the current rate of inflation.
Additional pressure is placed on tuition by the
University s other income sources, Owen said. The
University . endowment "is suffering the ravages
of the stock market," and although he anticipates
improved performance, Owen said the endow
ment has not kept up with inflation over the past
couple of years.
He also pointed out that "indirect cost recovery
on government research done at Stanford is main
taining its share of the budget, and is in fact one of
the highest growing income figures, but we're re
ally worried about it."
Owen said that the University is attempting to
make expenses grow more slowly. "We're actively
looking at a c ogeneration plant to make electricity
at the same time we make steam. In the future we
hope to keep utility costs down."
"This year, he said, "we also had a one percent
budget cut program across the academic and ad
ministrative areas that cut about $1.2 billion out of
the base budget."
But these are evidently not enough. "Tuition is
one of the very few items that we have clear con
trol over, so when push come to shove . . . it's clear
that tuition has to grow to produce a balanced
budget," Warner said.
