# Turning farms into cities
## 
### Karen Haberman 
In the rush to develop more
land to meet thisarea's worsen
ing housing situation, prime
agricultural areas are being
slowly whittled away in the
Santa Clara Valley, once known
for its green fields and orange
groves.
According to Ciddy Wordell
of the Committee for Green
Foothills (CGF), a local en
vironmental group dedicated
to preserving farmlands and
other open space, area agricul
tural lands provide many bene
fits to the community.
Local food production close
to an urban area minimizes
costs of transportation and in
sures fresher produce, said
Wordell. Rural lands also help
maintain air quality and pro
vide the psychological benefits
of scenery and open space.
"People need a release from
urbanization," said Wordell.
"They don't want their area to
become another Los Angeles."
Another reason to keep area
farmlands is water quality, ac
cording to Cheriel Jensen, a
Santa Clara County planner.
"Two-thirds of the county's
water supply comes from our
own watershed. Urbanization
would mean that this function
would be impaired," she said,
adding that this has already
happened in the Los Gatos wa
tershed, where septic tanks are
polluting the water supply.
However, the pressure on
farmers to sell their lands to de
velopers for large profits is ov
erwhelming, according to
Wordell, and farmers tend to
resent organizations such as
CGF that are trying to keep
them on the land by zoning
and other lega means.
"Farmers are working against
people who want regulations
for agricultural lands," said
Wordell, adding that housing
developers and business in
terests are also generally op
posed to such restrictions.
The economics of the
farmers' position explains this
apparent paradox, according
to Paul Sagers of the Local
Agency Formation Com
mission (LAFCO), an inde

pendent agency authorized by
the state legislature to approve
or deny city annexation re
quests.
"If people can't productively
farm, they won't farm. We can't
force people to do something
for the common good if they
don't get any benefits from it,"
he said.
The California Land Con
servation Act of 1965, also
known as the Williamson Act,
was passed with economic re
lief for farmers in mind, accord
ing to Jensen. The act provides
tax cut incentives for farmers in
exchange for a 10-year contract
to keep the land in agricultural
production.
But the economic incentives
provided by this act were not
great enough to offset the prof
its that could be made by sell
ing out, said Jensen, and so the
act has had questionable effec
tiveness.

Local, unincorporated land
in Santa Clara County is pro
tected by the Santa Clara
County General Plan, adopted
in November of 1980, which
sets aside all county land out
side of urban service areas as
"resource conservation areas,"
meaning that the land is zoned
to not be developed. But this
does not always mean that the
land remains in farmers' hands,
Jensen emphasized.
According to Wordell, de
velopers will buy the land and
sit on it, hoping for and actively
pursuing policy changes.
Jensen acknowledged that
such practices occur, but
claimed that such land is often
leased back to farmers.
According to Jensen, the
county has control only over

unincorporated land. Annexa--
tion by cities, under LAFCO's
jurisdiction, takes that control
away. "The county doesn't
have a lot to say about what
land is annexed," she said.
Wordell said that CGF was
dissatisfied with LAFCO's oper
ation, claiming that "the ma
jority on LAFCO has the
mindset that if the city's case
for annexation appears to be.
strong, they go with that. They
don't appear to be sensitive to
regional needs."
CGF's position is that cities
have ample space to expand
within their designated areas,
said Wordell.
However, Sagers said that
annexation approval centers
around health, safety, educa j
tion, and management con
siderations. "All I can say is that
the environment is a con
sideration. Conversion of land
is within the regulation of such

pieces of legislation as the Calk
fornia Environmental Quality
Act. We follow the regulations
set up by the state."
Sagers agreed, however, that
rural lands need protection.
"Zoning isn't enough to pre
serve agricultural lands," he
said. "Currently, agricultural
preservation is faced as a local
problem, but the lands are im
portant tostateand national in-â€ž
terests."
Wordell cited the difficulty
of identifying areas of interest
as one problem of preserving
farmland. She said that some
prime land has been de
veloped before its agricultural
value could be determined.
"We make attempts to identify
these lands, but then the
disappear," said Wordell.
