## Viewpoint/Randy Broberg Beware of Israeli 'apartheid' 
### 
Fancying myself knowledgeable of
ancient Biblical history as well as the
current political environment, I was
surprised to discover just how little I
had understood about the Middle
East from studying it in the United
States. Touring Israel last August, I
found a country which I would not
recognize in the newspapers. I saw a
belligerent nation made up of the
most prejudiced people I have ever
met. I saw racism and religious dis
crimination both practiced on an in
dividual level and institutionalized
by the policies of government. I saw
South African-style apartheid.
It is important to remember that Is
rael was created as a "Jewish Home
land," and as such, the indigenous
Arab residents have no real part in
the life of the nation. Arabs ex
perience separate and unequal con
ditions in almost every area. In Jeru
salem all one has to do is walk across a
street between the Jewish and Arab
quarters to observe the most pro
found contrasts in sanitation, hous
ing and health conditions. The Jewish
Quarter is wealthy, clean, quiet, and
exclusive. The Arab Quarter is
crowded, dirty, and does "not have
adequate electrical or plumbing fa
cilities. The country at large mirrors
the situation in Jerusalem: cities like
Tel Aviv remind you of surburban
America, with wide streets, good
lighting, sidewalk ice cream shops
and plenty of automobiles. The Is
raeli-occupied West Bank is charac
terized by ancient dilapidated build
ings, garbage in the streets, and chil
dren without even proper clothing.
Perhaps the situation is most blatant
in the separate and unequal trans
portation systems: believe it or not, I
much preferred riding in the
crowded vintage-1950 schoolbuses
which the Arabs had for their use
than on the 1981 air-conditioned
Mercedes buses which were for Jews.
The reason was that the Arabs were
more friendly to foreigners and hos
pitable in contrast to the general but
somewhat justifiable paranoia in Jew

ish Israel.
In Israel you will hear a justification
for everything that is shocking.
Sometimes the reasons are legit
imate, and sometimes they are not.
For example, in order to deter and
defend against terrorism, Israeli poli
cy is to have as many armed Jews as
possible. What this means is that on
the hus, in a restaurant, at the beach,
or even in religious sanctuaries, you
are almost never out of sight of ma
chine guns and soldiers. It may well
be necessary, but it unquestionably
affects your psyche.

The 'good Israeli'
believes a number of
things: every Israeli is
a soldier and almost
any act can be
justified on the basis
of'an eye for an eye/

The "good Israeli" believes a
number of things: every Israeli is a
soldier, and almost any act can be jus
tified on the basis of 'an eye for an
eye.'Time and again when I asked Is
raelis why so many civilians had to die
in the Beirut bombings, they would
respond not with a justification for Is
raeli deeds but with a finger pointing,
"What about when the Arabs.. . I" I
found almost universal reluctance to
admit that the Israeli government
had ever committed or ever could
commit a sin.
Being a citizen-soldier is the Israeli
rationalization for raising children on
Kibbutzes only a few kilometers from
the Lebanese and Syrian borders —
within the range of Palestinian Liber
ation Organization (PLO) rockets. "If
the children die, they died as sol
diers," replied one Israeli tank com
mander/tour guide.
But if observing the racist apart
heid had not been enough to shock
me, I would have been shocked to
talk to a Brooklyn-born Israeli in Je

rusalem. He had some inflammatory
literature in his ice cream parlor call
ing for American Jews to emmigrate
to Israel to escape the "imminent
American Holacaust." When I asked
him what the "Final Solution" to the
Palestinian question was, he replied
"ship'em out of here."
"Where will they go?" I asked.
"There are 13 Arab countries;
let'em choose."
"But they have been living here
1900 years, longer than the Jews have
evr?r controlled this land."
"Yes, but now, we control it,"he
said. He had a large aerial photo
graph of Jerusalem on his wall. It had
been slightly doctored: the Mosque
of Omar had been replaced by a re
built Jewish Temple.
The present Israeli coalition gov
ernment is completely dominated by
a "Masada shall not fall, the
Holacaust shall not be repeated"
mentality. This frame of mind leads
the Prime Ministerto unprovoked at
tacks on foreign capitals (Baghdad),
attacks on innocent civilians (Beirut),
and annexation of foreign territory,
(the Golan Heights). Almost anything
can be justified on the grounds of de
fense — even if the refusal to nego
tiate away land for peace paints the
country into a hopeless corner.
There is no shortage of statistics to
back my accusations of separate and
unequal conditions of life based on
race and religion, but nothing is so
indelible as the actual observation of
such conditions. Nevertheless, any
criticism I've made of Israeli policies
is not to be construed as a justifi
cation for the crimes of the PLO or
the "jihad" policies of the Arab gov
ernments. I am sure there are many
Israelis who are as distressed as I at
the unjust situations I describe, but
the fact that I did not meet any of
them indicates something. Jewish
Americans or any other Americans
should not support any country
without reservation, including Israel.

heid had not been enough to shock
me, I would have been shocked to
talk to a Brooklyn-born Israeli in Je

rusalem. He had some inflammatory
literature in his ice cream parlor call
ing for American Jews to emmigrate
to Israel to escape the "imminent
American Holacaust." When I asked
him what the "Final Solution" to the
Palestinian question was, he replied
"ship'em out of here."
"Where will they go?" I asked.
"There are 13 Arab countries;
let'em choose."
"But they have been living here
1900 years, longer than the Jews have
evr?r controlled this land."
"Yes, but now, we control it,"he
said. He had a large aerial photo
graph of Jerusalem on his wall. It had
been slightly doctored: the Mosque
of Omar had been replaced by a re
built Jewish Temple.
The present Israeli coalition gov
ernment is completely dominated by
a "Masada shall not fall, the
Holacaust shall not be repeated"
mentality. This frame of mind leads
the Prime Ministerto unprovoked at
tacks on foreign capitals (Baghdad),
attacks on innocent civilians (Beirut),
and annexation of foreign territory,
(the Golan Heights). Almost anything
can be justified on the grounds of de
fense — even if the refusal to nego
tiate away land for peace paints the
country into a hopeless corner.
There is no shortage of statistics to
back my accusations of separate and
unequal conditions of life based on
race and religion, but nothing is so
indelible as the actual observation of
such conditions. Nevertheless, any
criticism I've made of Israeli policies
is not to be construed as a justifi
cation for the crimes of the PLO or
the "jihad" policies of the Arab gov
ernments. I am sure there are many
Israelis who are as distressed as I at
the unjust situations I describe, but
the fact that I did not meet any of
them indicates something. Jewish
Americans or any other Americans
should not support any country
without reservation, including Israel.

Fancying myself knowledgeable of
ancient Biblical history as well as the
current political environment, I was
surprised to discover just how little I
had understood about the Middle
East from studying it in the United
States. Touring Israel last August, I
found a country which I would not
recognize in the newspapers. I saw a
belligerent nation made up of the
most prejudiced people I have ever
met. I saw racism and religious dis
crimination both practiced on an in
dividual level and institutionalized
by the policies of government. I saw
South African-style apartheid.
It is important to remember that Is
rael was created as a "Jewish Home
land," and as such, the indigenous
Arab residents have no real part in
the life of the nation. Arabs ex
perience separate and unequal con
ditions in almost every area. In Jeru
salem all one has to do is walk across a
street between the Jewish and Arab
quarters to observe the most pro
found contrasts in sanitation, hous
ing and health conditions. The Jewish
Quarter is wealthy, clean, quiet, and
exclusive. The Arab Quarter is
crowded, dirty, and does "not have
adequate electrical or plumbing fa
cilities. The country at large mirrors
the situation in Jerusalem: cities like
Tel Aviv remind you of surburban
America, with wide streets, good
lighting, sidewalk ice cream shops
and plenty of automobiles. The Is
raeli-occupied West Bank is charac
terized by ancient dilapidated build
ings, garbage in the streets, and chil
dren without even proper clothing.
Perhaps the situation is most blatant
in the separate and unequal trans
portation systems: believe it or not, I
much preferred riding in the
crowded vintage-1950 schoolbuses
which the Arabs had for their use
than on the 1981 air-conditioned
Mercedes buses which were for Jews.
The reason was that the Arabs were
more friendly to foreigners and hos
pitable in contrast to the general but
somewhat justifiable paranoia in Jew

ish Israel.
In Israel you will hear a justification
for everything that is shocking.
Sometimes the reasons are legit
imate, and sometimes they are not.
For example, in order to deter and
defend against terrorism, Israeli poli
cy is to have as many armed Jews as
possible. What this means is that on
the hus, in a restaurant, at the beach,
or even in religious sanctuaries, you
are almost never out of sight of ma
chine guns and soldiers. It may well
be necessary, but it unquestionably
affects your psyche.

The "good Israeli" believes a
number of things: every Israeli is a
soldier, and almost any act can be jus
tified on the basis of 'an eye for an
eye.'Time and again when I asked Is
raelis why so many civilians had to die
in the Beirut bombings, they would
respond not with a justification for Is
raeli deeds but with a finger pointing,
"What about when the Arabs.. . I" I
found almost universal reluctance to
admit that the Israeli government
had ever committed or ever could
commit a sin.
Being a citizen-soldier is the Israeli
rationalization for raising children on
Kibbutzes only a few kilometers from
the Lebanese and Syrian borders —
within the range of Palestinian Liber
ation Organization (PLO) rockets. "If
the children die, they died as sol
diers," replied one Israeli tank com
mander/tour guide.
