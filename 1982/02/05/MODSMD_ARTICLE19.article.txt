## Soon a rich kids' University? 
### 
Tuition at Stanford next year will be an astounding
$8100. That is more than the per capita income of China,
Italy, and Spain combined. Fortunately, no one is laugh
ing. And yet, with few exceptions, no one is complaining
either.
Instead, in an expression of disconcerted ac
quiescence many students exclaim, "Well, it will be
worth it in the end," and pass the new bill to their pa
rents, who moan a little, send a larger check, and
mumble, "I hope it's worth it."
However, for a significant portion of the student body
the "pass the bill to the folks" tactic doesn't work. And
while financial aid decreases as fast as tuition increases
these students are left in a costly dilemma that has them
wondering, "Can it really be worth it?" The recently an
nounced 15 percent tuition increase for 1982-83 is almost
enough to make Berkeley appealing. Almost.
What is most disturbing about the tuition increase is
not the increase itself. Rather, it is the administration's
attitude of resigned fatality as embodied in University
President Donald Kennedy's recent letter to the Daily
(Jan. 20). Kennedy declared that as long as inflation con
tinued to increase, and no doubt it will, tuition will in
crease and at a rate faster than inflation.
Why at a rate faster than inflation? There is no answer
given except for an allusion to historical trends. The un
derlying assumption is that tuition will increase and
there is nothing we can do about it.
Or perhaps a more accurate inference is that there is
nothing we need to do about it as long as there are
enough eager, wealthy people knocking at Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon's door. And with more than
12,000 people currently knocking on his door, the ad
ministration can rest assured that the classrooms will re
main filled. But filling them with qualified students may
be a different story.
The University avidly prides itself in its "aid-blind" ad
missions policy, contending that a student's ability to pay
has no bearing on admissions. This seems a bit naive, for
although there may be no overt effect, the rising costs
certainly eliminate many prospective and deserved can
didates who realize they could not afford to attend Stan
ford, "so why apply?"
If the current situation continues, as the adminis
tration indicates it will, there is warranted fear that Stan
ford may become a haven for the wealthy, subsequently
denying access to those students (mainly the middle-in
come who cannot qualify foraid) whoare neither willing
to spend exorbitant sums on education nor want to face
the prospect of $50,000 of loans upon graduation.
It is argued that Stanford's tuition increase is com
petitive with that of other selective private universities. It
seems that Stanford is once again falling into the "keep
up with the Harvards" syndrome. Albeit we want to stay
competitive, tuition costs is one area we would surely re

linquish our spot among other selective universities.
Needless to say, because others are raising their costs is
not sufficient reason for Stanford to do the same.
The question of what can be done, rather than what
might happen in the future, isfarmore complex. Perhaps
the proper preliminary question is, what is being done?
To date no budget-cutting proposals have been an
nounced, and as costs continue to rise at a rate of six per
cent above the rate of inflation, one must question the
efficacy of any current programs.
Granted, a large proportion of the budget is com
mitted to professors salaries, an area that must be pre
served in order to maintain a top-quality faculty. How
ever, a reduction of faculty, instead of pay, may be
feasible. Most professors teach between three and five
classes a year; would it be unreasonable to ask some to
teach one more? Similarly, there may be a possibility for
a reduction in staff, and although these options might
not sound appealing, due to the demands of reality they
are worth considering.
And, if other costs are out of control, which is ques
tionable, what can be done about financial aid? The in
dication here is that the future is quite dim, and without
sufficient financial aid the qualified applicant pool will
certainly drop.
In defending its current financial aid policy, the ad
ministration states that three-quarters of all students cur
rently receiving financial aid have demonstrable need.
What it fails to realize, however, is that means one quar
ter (1100 students) of all those receiving aid, don't need
it. Based on a percentage, this "unneeded" financial aid
is a staggering $6,467,500. That could put a lot of needy
students though school for a long time.
Considering the numbers, it is highly doubtful that all
of these students are on the football team since at last
count there were somewhat lessthan 1100playersonthe
team. A proper redirection of financial aid could signifi
cantly lighten the burden for many truly deserving stu
dents.
Perhaps it would be more reassuring to see one of
those little pies telling us where our tuition dollars go so
that we can have a better idea of the composition of the
budget. It is important that the University evaluate the
effects of potentially prohibitive tuition costs. Stanford
must consider the future when costs of $20,000 a year are
a reality, and one must wonder if education is pricing
itself out of all but the wealthy's realm.
Rising tuition costs cannot be remedied by a shrug of
the shoulders, sighs of compassion, and futile com
parisons to other universities. The Administration must
shed its attitude of acquiescence and begin to confront
the issue with concrete proposals. Perhaps then the Uni
versity will remain a fine institution, continuing to offer
education to all those who deserve it.

dication here is that the future is quite dim, and without
sufficient financial aid the qualified applicant pool will
certainly drop.
In defending its current financial aid policy, the ad
ministration states that three-quarters of all students cur
rently receiving financial aid have demonstrable need.
What it fails to realize, however, is that means one quar
ter (1100 students) of all those receiving aid, don't need
it. Based on a percentage, this "unneeded" financial aid
is a staggering $6,467,500. That could put a lot of needy
students though school for a long time.
Considering the numbers, it is highly doubtful that all
of these students are on the football team since at last
count there were somewhat lessthan 1100playersonthe
team. A proper redirection of financial aid could signifi
cantly lighten the burden for many truly deserving stu
dents.
Perhaps it would be more reassuring to see one of
those little pies telling us where our tuition dollars go so
that we can have a better idea of the composition of the
budget. It is important that the University evaluate the
effects of potentially prohibitive tuition costs. Stanford
must consider the future when costs of $20,000 a year are
a reality, and one must wonder if education is pricing
itself out of all but the wealthy's realm.
Rising tuition costs cannot be remedied by a shrug of
the shoulders, sighs of compassion, and futile com
parisons to other universities. The Administration must
shed its attitude of acquiescence and begin to confront
the issue with concrete proposals. Perhaps then the Uni
versity will remain a fine institution, continuing to offer
education to all those who deserve it.

Tuition at Stanford next year will be an astounding
$8100. That is more than the per capita income of China,
Italy, and Spain combined. Fortunately, no one is laugh
ing. And yet, with few exceptions, no one is complaining
either.
Instead, in an expression of disconcerted ac
quiescence many students exclaim, "Well, it will be
worth it in the end," and pass the new bill to their pa
rents, who moan a little, send a larger check, and
mumble, "I hope it's worth it."
However, for a significant portion of the student body
the "pass the bill to the folks" tactic doesn't work. And
while financial aid decreases as fast as tuition increases
these students are left in a costly dilemma that has them
wondering, "Can it really be worth it?" The recently an
nounced 15 percent tuition increase for 1982-83 is almost
enough to make Berkeley appealing. Almost.
What is most disturbing about the tuition increase is
not the increase itself. Rather, it is the administration's
attitude of resigned fatality as embodied in University
President Donald Kennedy's recent letter to the Daily
(Jan. 20). Kennedy declared that as long as inflation con
tinued to increase, and no doubt it will, tuition will in
crease and at a rate faster than inflation.
Why at a rate faster than inflation? There is no answer
given except for an allusion to historical trends. The un
derlying assumption is that tuition will increase and
there is nothing we can do about it.
Or perhaps a more accurate inference is that there is
nothing we need to do about it as long as there are
enough eager, wealthy people knocking at Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon's door. And with more than
12,000 people currently knocking on his door, the ad
ministration can rest assured that the classrooms will re
main filled. But filling them with qualified students may
be a different story.
The University avidly prides itself in its "aid-blind" ad
missions policy, contending that a student's ability to pay
has no bearing on admissions. This seems a bit naive, for
although there may be no overt effect, the rising costs
certainly eliminate many prospective and deserved can
didates who realize they could not afford to attend Stan
ford, "so why apply?"
If the current situation continues, as the adminis
tration indicates it will, there is warranted fear that Stan
ford may become a haven for the wealthy, subsequently
denying access to those students (mainly the middle-in
come who cannot qualify foraid) whoare neither willing
to spend exorbitant sums on education nor want to face
the prospect of $50,000 of loans upon graduation.
It is argued that Stanford's tuition increase is com
petitive with that of other selective private universities. It
seems that Stanford is once again falling into the "keep
up with the Harvards" syndrome. Albeit we want to stay
competitive, tuition costs is one area we would surely re

linquish our spot among other selective universities.
Needless to say, because others are raising their costs is
not sufficient reason for Stanford to do the same.
The question of what can be done, rather than what
might happen in the future, isfarmore complex. Perhaps
the proper preliminary question is, what is being done?
To date no budget-cutting proposals have been an
nounced, and as costs continue to rise at a rate of six per
cent above the rate of inflation, one must question the
efficacy of any current programs.
Granted, a large proportion of the budget is com
mitted to professors salaries, an area that must be pre
served in order to maintain a top-quality faculty. How
ever, a reduction of faculty, instead of pay, may be
feasible. Most professors teach between three and five
classes a year; would it be unreasonable to ask some to
teach one more? Similarly, there may be a possibility for
a reduction in staff, and although these options might
not sound appealing, due to the demands of reality they
are worth considering.

tionable, what can be done about financial aid? The in
dication here is that the future is quite dim, and without
