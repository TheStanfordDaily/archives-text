There have been no specific
charges that Stanford professors have
worked on behalf of the Central In
telligence Agency (CIA), University
President Donald Kennedy told the
Faculty Senate yesterday, although
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth later told the same
group that he was aware of several at
tempts by the CIA to recruit faculty
members here.
"No allegations have been lodged
to me, so I had no knowledge there
was a problem," Kennedy said.
Although Roth said he knew of
several instances when faculty mem
bers had been approached by the
CIA, he said he was not aware of any
"agents" among the faculty. Roth
said he favored some clearly defined
policy that would "help people who
are in a difficult position," when
asked to act on behalf of the CIA

Kennedy said that guidelines, such
as those enac ted by Harvard on CIA
recruitment, "don't offer very
much."
Harvard guidelines include the
stipulations that any private consult
ing agreement with the CIA must be
reported to the dean or president of
the university; that faculty do not un
dertake intelligence operations; and
that faculty members must report
that they are acting as CIA recruiters
if thev are doing so and that they
should not supply any individual's
name to the CIA without his consent.
1 here is a'Mimited utility to
guidelines which simply reinforce
what everybody already knows," he
said According to Kennedy, they will
not insure that faculty are following
l he University's policy. Guidelines
are a "solution in search of a prob
lem," he claimed.
"I'm not naive," Roth responded,

"if someone wants to do things cov
ertly, there's no way to stop them."
Covert research projects are pro
hibited under University policy, but
any open research, whether for the
CIA or any other organization, is not,
said Gerald Lieberman, Vice Provost
and Dean of Graduate Studies and
Research
"What the faculty does on their
spare time with consulting for any
one, such as the CI A, that's their busi
ness," he said.
Kennedy later admitted that "in
some instances it might be helpful to
have guidelines for a faculty member
who is approached."
Kennedy also remarked that "dis
closure of consulting can be com
pelled" and that any possible conflict
of interest due to faculty consulting
will be investigated bv University of
ficials.

The federal government's concern
over loss of defense and vital techno
logical information and the export
restrictions placed by the govern
ment on teaching and research were
,i!so major topics discussed by Ken
r dy at the Senate meeting.
For the past year negotiations have
I en going on between universities
and the Departments of State, Com
merce, and Defense over these re
strictions, said Kennedy. The most
success has come in the negotiations
with the Defense department, he
said.
Kennedy said he talked with Frank
Press, the head of the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS), on Feb.
3, and said that the NAS has offered
to act as "a broker." He said the NAS
would work with the State Depart
ment to determine whether or not
the restrictions could somehow be
made acceptable to the universities.
