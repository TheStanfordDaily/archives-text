## Signs of torture on El Salvador 'battle victims' 
### 
Why did you not mention the re
cent slaughter of 19 El Salvadorans in
San Salvador in your brief wire ser
vice account (Feb. 2) of the new 55
million dollar emergency aid pack
age the United States is giving to the
Salvadoran junta?
According to wire service accounts
not found in the Daily, the Duarte
government does not deny that its
troops were responsible for the late
night murders of 19 men, women,
and children. Rather, government
spokesman maintain that the deaths
occurred during a battle with in
surgent forces.
However, again according to the
wire services, it has been established
that at least some of the victims
showed signs of torture — several
bodies were found with their hands
bound behind their backs. One
woman was quoted as saying that her
two young sons, age 13 and 14, were
removed from her home after mid
night by the "security" forces. Their
bodies were among the 19.
Of course the question of credibili
ty arises. Do we believe the govern
ment spokesman when he says the
deaths occured during battle, or do
we believe the descriptions and
photos of disfigured bodies?
Unfortunately, the Daily gave its
readers no choice in this important
matter. We should be aware of the
actions of those governments that
are supported by the United States in
the name of "freedom."

Win a nuclear war?
The apparent ignorance out of
which the present administration is
acting with regard to the nuclear
arms issue has become increasingly
clear to me of late. As a case in point,
I quote your article of Jan. 18 of this
year, entitled "Doctors, government
differ on nuclear war." In that article,
Deputy Undersecretary of Defense
for Strategic and Nuclear Forces T.K.
Jones, is paraphrased as having said
the following: That in the event of an
all-out nuclear war with the Soviet
Union, it would take only two to four
years for the United States to fully re
cover.
The use of the expression "all-out"
to describe the extent of conflict in
question is a far cry from recent light
hearted and cheery administration
references to "limited nuclear war";
however, the weight of his words ap
pears to be lost on the under
secretary himself. I can take these
words to refer to only one thing: a sit
uation in which both the Soviet
Union and the United States utilize
all the nuclear weapons at their dis
posal (equivalent to twenty tons of
INT for each man, woman and child
on earth) in a no-holds barred effort
at mutual annihilation. Period.
Out of these ashes, according to
Jones, the United States will rise as
the proverbial Phoenix, to renew her
position as the leader of the free
world . . . within four years. Of
course, the undersecretary's

mathematics may be right ... but
there will be no one here to con
gratulate him.

Consider male rape
In a recent article, two women who
have beensexuallyassaultedoncam
pus talked of their experience and
the traumatic emotional aftermath.
One of the women, Alice, was trou
bled by the question of "what is the
difference between a man being
mugged and a woman being raped?"
In my opinion a better question is,
what is the difference between a
woman being raped and a man being
raped by another man? Nothing.
Physical violence and sexual humil
iation are the immediate conse
quences of rape. While most women
probably have little trouble em
pathizing with Alice's and Beth's
emotional state following the rape, I
think most men can understand the
terrible mental burden and stigma
we would have to bear if we were vic
tims of rape. This letter is certainly
not intended as an indictment of
Stanford mens' attitude towards
rape. But my own experience, follow
ing the rape of two women I knew
while I was in college, isthatthe gen
eral male populace does not recog
nize the true hideousness of this
crime.

Bikers be (a)ware
At 11:55 Jan. 22,1982, Death took a
coffee break from his/her sur
veillance of the Inner Quad.
Let me explain. I was approaching,
on my bicycle, the arch to the Quad
that faces the Albers Wall. Foot and
bicycle traffic was heavy, as usual at
changes of classes. Traffic was slow
and considerate when a
"Schussboomer" on a motorbike
passed me at my estimated speed of
15 m.p.h., weaving in a out of the
heavy foot and bike traffic. Suddenly,
from the Arcade on the left side of
the arch, a beautiful young woman
emerged on her on her motorbike at
about 5 m.p.h. She swerved right, the
"Schussboomer" swerved right, and
they missed each otherand the traffic
by a few feet. But, their heads missed
collision by less than a foot. Had they
collided at a relative speed of 20
m.p.h. at least one skull would have
been fractured and their out-of-con
trol motorbikes would have smashed
into the foot and bicycle traffic. If you
think that no serious injury would
have resulted, put your head down
and run as fast as you can against a
concrete wall — that would be about
a 7 m.p.h. collision, not 20.
Now the point of all this is that
Death is seldom out for a coffee
break. As I understand, motorized
bicycles are forbidden on walk and
bike ways and restricted to the roads
for autos and motorcycles. ENFORCE
the rules or someone will be killed
soon.
