## Card seeks repeat of lone Pac-10 win 
### Steve Odell 
When the Stanford basket
ball team travels to Oregon this
weekend, Cardinal coach Dick
Dißiaso can expect only one
thing — the unexpected.
In a season filled with
"almost" and "not quite
enough" performances, Stan
ford experienced both the
long and short ends of the
spectrum the last time these
clubs met.
The Oregon game at Maples,
played a month ago, featured
the Cardinal's most consistent
performance of the year and a
97-88 victory, Stanford's only
conference win to date.
Two nights later, however,
Stanford was destroyed by Or
egon State, 81-38, marking the
second worst Cardinal loss in
history.
Stanford, now at the midway
point of the Pac-10 season,
standing at 1-8, needs at least
one win this weekend to
salvage this season which has
so quickly passeed the Cardinal
by.
To do that, Stanford will have
to take better care of the
basketball. The Cardinal is
averaging nearly 17 turnovers
per Pac-10 game. And they will
need to shoot better from the
foul line. Stanford made only
18-of-36 t'reethrows against Ar
izona State and 8-of-15 versus
Arizona in losing their sixth
and seventh games in a row last

weekend.
"The team is as disappointed
as the coaches are," said
Dißiaso. "We would all like to
pick up a victory, and the
sooner the better."
Oregon, who the Cardinal
plays tonight is in a similar
state. The Ducks have slipped
under .500 for the first time
since opening day after two
losses in Los Angeles last week
end, and have lost five of their
last seven games.
"Thev like to rush the ball up
the court, which can pose
problems for us," Dißiaso said.
"We handled it very well in our
first meeting, but now we'll
have to control the tempo on
their home floor."
The Ducks, the conference's
top scoring team (77.6 points
per game) are led byseniorfor
ward john Greig, who is
averaging 15.8 points and 7.4
rebounds on the season.
Oregon State,who Stanford
will face Saturday night ,is
ranked No. 7 nationally. The
Beavers post a very balanced
offensive attack and are not» % d
for their fierce defense —
averaging 9.3 steals and forcing
21.4 turnovers per game. OSU
has won nine of their last 10.
Lester Conner, the All-Amer
ica guard candidate who leads
the Beavers in scoring and as
sists, was reportedly ill Thurs
day and might not see action
against Stanford.
