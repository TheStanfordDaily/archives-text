Women's swimming
It will be the Super Bowl of women's swimming
when Stanford locks horns with Texas tomorrow at
de Guerre pool.
The winner of the Stanford-Texas meet has gone
on to win the Association of Intercollegiate Athlet
ics for Women Championships the last two sea
sons.
Stanford now belongs to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association while Texas remains in the
AIAW making Saturday's dual their lone meeting
of the season. Swimming World ranks both squads
No. 1 in their respective divisions.
The meet is almost dead even on paper.
Both coaches cited the 500 yard freestyle as
the kev event. The race pits Texas' Kim Linehan
and Stanford's Marybeth Linzmeier — both 1980
U.S.Olvmpians— against each other.
The Cardinal is 9-0 in dual meets this season. The
Longhorns' only loss in six dual meets came at the
hands of Florida, ranked second nationally by
Swimming World.
The meet begins at 1:00 p.m., with the teams
swimming the shorter program of events.
Fencing
The Stanford men's fencing team will host un
defeated San Jose State Saturday at 1 p.m. in Roble
gym.
The Cardinal, 5-1, will pit their homegrown
fencers against a highly-recruited Spartan squad.
San Jose routed the Cardinal last November, but
has suffered recently from a lagging schedule. Two
of the Spartans foes this year have folded their
teams.
The Stanford women's team is paced by Pamela
Henck. Coach Buzz Hurst said that Henck has
shown improvement all year and the Cardinal
women seem "to flow with her."
The men's epee team is led by Nikolas Blevins
who will face three-timeAll-AmericaPeter Schifrin
of San Jose.

Stanford men are expected to be strong in the
sabre with Howard Cash, Jeff Gueble and Roger
Furlong.
Gymnastics
Stanford's women's gymnastics team, led by
sophomore All-America Merilyn Chapman, takes
on tenth-ranked University of Southern California
and powerful Oregon in a tri-meet Saturday night
at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford, 2-1 in dual meets, will be facing a USC
team which is 0-2 in duals, having been plagued by
injuries all season.
The Trojan's health status has improved, how
ever, and former United States Olympian Donna
Turnbow and U.S. national team member Susie
Dellums will be competing.
Journeying to Fullerton today to compete
against the Titans and Cal State Long Beach, coach
Sadao Hamada's men's team will face some "very
tough" competition. Hampered by junior Rich Ro
sen's wrist, which he reinjured in last week's meet,
the Cardinal will be weak in the pommel horse.
Men's swimming
The Stanford men's swimming team travels to
Los Angeles today and tomorrow to face UCLA
and USC.
The two meets comprise the Cardinal's most
crucial road trip of the year. UCLA is rated No. 1 in
the nation and the Trojans perennially finish in the
top ten.
Saturday at USC, the Cardinal will face a Trojan
team that has lost at home only once in the last 25
years.
Ninth-ranked USC is led by Jeff Float and Chris
Cavanaugh who starred in the United State's dual
meet win over the Soviet Union last summer in
Kiev.
