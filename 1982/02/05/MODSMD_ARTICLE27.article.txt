Stanford's fourth-ianked baseball team faces a se
vere test as the take on Cal State Fullerton, the nations
top-ranked team, in a three-game series at Sunken
Diamond this weekend.
"They are ranked No. 1 and deservedly so," Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess said. "They don't have
weaknesses anywhere."
The Cardinal takes a 4-0 record into today's contest
and has shown a surprisingly strong defense so far this
year.
Today's contest starts at 2:00 p.m. and senior
pitcher Brian Mignano will start for Stanford. In tom
morrow's doubleheader, which starts at noon,
sophomore Brian Myers and freshman Jeff Ballardwill
be the starters.
Sunday, Stanford faces the University of California
at Davis. The game will be the Cardinal's fourth game
in three days and they will be forced to use one of
their younger pitchers.
