The beginning of February
may seem a late date for pub
lishing a list of last year's best
movies, but a few of the Christ
mas releases have only just
opened in the Bay Area, and I
wanted to be as thorough as
possible. In fact, there are still
two movies I've been unable to
see and wanted to — the Rus
sian Ohlomov, which opened
here last summer, and the Aus
tralian The Devil's Playground,
which has played, thus far, to
New York audiences only.
My list of the 10 outstanding
films of last year may appear
perverse to some readers. Only
two of the pictures were run
away hits, and there are con
spicuous omissions: com
mercial successes like The Four
Seasons, Raiders of the Lost
Ark, Arthur, Body Heat, Chari
ots of Fire and (probably) On
Golden Pond, and art house fa
vorites like The Last Metro,
Prince of the City, The French
Lieutenant's Woman, My Din
ner with Andre and Man of
Iron. I have not attempted to
be controversial; I simply don't
think any of these are among
the best 1981 releases. I can't
remember another year that
yielded so many ignored good
movies. Even some of the mi
nor comedies that do not ap

pear on my list are worthier, I
think, than a collage of old
movie cliches like Raiders or
Body Heat, but if you tell a
friend he might enjoy
Caveman or So Fine or Zorro,
the (iay Blade or Modern Ro
mance or the oddly con
troversial History of the World,
Part I, he'll likely suspect you of
being ironic. Vet aside from
I listory of the World, these co
medies don't have a bad repu
tation, exactly; no one went to
see them, so how could anyone
bad-mouth them? Similarly,
because of the failure of dis
tributors to publicize them
properly, two small, unusual
films — Cattle Annie and Little
Britches, which is exceptionally
well acted by Burt Lancaster,
gifted newcomer Amanda
Plummer and Diane Lane, and
(he scary, uneven Ticket to
Heaven — opened and closed
with astonishing rapidity.
A note about the actors and
actresses whose names appear
on the lists that follow: the
omission of performers is not
necessarily intended as a
statement. Yes, I also loved Jeff
Bridges in Cutter's Way and
Robert Duvall in True Con
fessions and Dudley Moore in
Arthur, bu» by my count there
PWere over a hundred outstand

ing performances in the last
year, half of them in the sup
porting actor category, and I
could not, obviously, include
them all.
In any case, the following are
the movies I would advise you
to watch for most closely in the
New Varsity and Fox schedules
of the next few months.
1. Illow Out: Brian De Palma's
first filin to deal with important
political issues. John Travolta
plays a man seeking the truth
— the real source of a presi
dential candidate's death — in
a society that prefers, out of
fear or greed or disinterest, to
accept lies. A highly personal,
highly charged picture, com
parable to the best work of
Robert Altman and Martin
Scorsese.
2. Pennies from Heaven: This
is possibly the best of all movie
musicals; certainly it is the most
provocative. Director Herbert
Ross and screenwriter Dennis
Potter's vision of the Depres
sion is part Edward Hopper and
part Busby Berkeley. Impec
cably acted, the cast brings an
emotional intensity to the film
that is virtually unknown in
musicals.
3. Atlantic City: John Guare's

script is about people who are
given the chance to start over;
it is a comedy with an unusual
tone and an accepting attitude
toward all of the eccentrics
who populate it — society's
peripherals, like the one-time
small-time hood (Burt Lan
caster) who is rejuvenated
when he winds up with a quan
tity of cocaine to sell. Louis
Malle directed, and the superb
cast includes Susan Sarandon,
Mollis McLaren, Kate Reid,
Robert joy and Michel Piccoli.
4. All Night Long: This won
derful comedy — a suitable
companion piece to Atlantic
City — has been almost totally
neglected by audiences and
other critics. The dumb ad
campaign made it look like a
George Segal-Glenda jackson
sex farce, when in fact it is a
sweetly understated film about
changing one's lifestyle at
middle age. Gene Hackman
gives a magnificent comic per
formance in the role of an ex
ecutive who becomes the man
ager of an all-night pharmacy
and has an affair with delicate,
flaky Barbra Streisand. Jean-
Claude Tramont directed,

beautifully, from a first-rate
screenplay by W.D. Richter.
5. Les Sons Debarras (Good
Riddance): In Montreal, where
this film was first shown, it re
ceived the acclaim it merits;

here it is nearly unknown.
Francis Mankiewicz made this
remarkable study of the rela
tionship between a mother
(Marie Tifo) and daughter
(Charlotte Laurier) who live
alone in the Laurentian Moun
tains of Quebec. The two cen
tral performances are all one
could wish for, and Rejean
Ducharme's poetic script sug
gests a Quebecois Carson Mc-
Cullers.
6. Southern Comfort: Walter

Hill's tense, dissonantsuspense
film about a troup of National
Guardsmen laid siege to bv Ca
juns in the Louisiana Bayou.
Mistakenly assumed (bv peo
ple who haven't seen it) to be a
poor man's Deliverance, this

film is a far more trenchant ex
amination of alienation and the
effects of panic.
7. Pixote: Hector Babenco
made this eye opener about
the fate of slum children in Sao
Paulo, Brazil. Much of it has the
tone of muckraking journal
ism, but it is a deeply shocking
and probably unforgettable
movie. Fernando Ramas da
Silva plavs the blank-faced little
boy who becomes a thief, a
drug dealer, a pimp and a

murderer.
8. Reds: In the midst of suc
cessful bad movies and for
gotten good ones, the popu
larity of Warren Beatty's in
telligent, unconventional epic
about the lives of John Reed
and Louise Bryant is most
heartening. The writing, by
Beatty and playwright Trevor
Griffiths, is variable, but most
of it is uncommonly literate for
a historical spectacle, and Beat
ty's approach to the material is
refreshingly unforced.
9. Excalibur: John Boorman's
retelling of the -Nrthurian leg
end is a triumph of style and
feeling. The dialogue may
make you cringe, and most of
the acting is woefully inade
quate, but visually and emo
tionally the picture is over
whelming. Nicol Williamson is
the funniest of all stage and
screen Merlins.
10. Superman II: I didn't care
for the first Superman, which
looked like it had been
directed bv a committee, but
Richard Lester, who took over
when the director of the ori
ginal picture, Richard Donner,
was fired, brought a stylistic
unity to the sequel, as well as a
first-rate technician's know
how. The action sequences are
mostly crackerjack, and the vil
lains — Gene Hackman,
Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas
and Jack O'Halloran — are

hilarious. David and Leslie
Newman and Mario Puzo sup
plied the mtfrvelous tongue
in-cheek dialogue, and Christ
opher Reeve is a very human
Superman.
