Russian general expelled from U.S.
Washington — The highest-ranking military officer at the Soviet Em
bassy here was expelled from the country yesterday after being caught
by the FBI with incriminating documents, souices said last night.
Maj. Gen. Vasiliy Chitov, the embassy military attache and a member
of the Soviet intelligence agency CRU, was declared "persona non
grata" and told to leave the couniry, the sources said. He left on a com
mercial flight at midday yesterday, they said.
He was taken into custody last weekend, the sources said, after a high
speed chase through Washington streets.
It was not immediately clear what kind of documents Chitov had in
his possession or whether any U.S. military or government employees
were suspected as being accomplices in the case.
Chitov apparently was not arrested and charged with espionage be
cause he was protected by diplomatic immunity.
FBI Director William Webster and other law enforcement officials
have complained in recent months about an increase in the number of
diplomatic personnel representing the Soviet Union and other com
munist nations in the United States. The increase has complicated the
work of FBI counterintelligence agents, Webster said.
Soviet bloc countries have concentrated espionage efforts in recent
years on gaining access to U.S. high technology that gives U.S. weapons
systems superiority over many such Soviet systems.
Reagan submits draft treaty to Soviets
Washington —r President Ronald Reagan announced yesterday that
he has submitted a draft treaty to the Soviet Union that would carry out
his plan to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
"Such a treaty would be a major contribution to security, stability and
peace," Reagan said in a statement issued at the White House. "I call on
President (Leonid) Brezhnev to join us in this important first step to re
duce the nuclear shadow that hangs over the peoples of the world."
The draft treaty, submitted by U.S. negotiators to their Soviet coun
terparts at Geneva on Tuesday, embodied the proposals Reagan made
last Nov. 18 in a speech at the National Press Club which the president
called "a broad program tor peace."
In that speech Reagan proposed to scrap the planned deployment of
Pershing II and surface-launched Cruise missiles if the Soviets dis
mantled their SS-4, SS-5 and SS-20 missiles. The U.S. missiles are not
scheduled for deployment until late in 1983 or early 1984, while the Rus
sian missiles are already in place.
The U.S. proposal to trade off missiles which are not yet deployed for
those which already are was promptly denounced by the Soviets. On
Wednesday, in Moscow, Brezhnev proposed to reduce U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles in Europe by two-thirds by 1990 and charged
that the United States was not engaged in serious negotiations at Gene
va.
