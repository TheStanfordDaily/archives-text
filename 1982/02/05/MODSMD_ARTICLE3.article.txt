Russian general expelled from U.S.
Washington — The highest-ranking military officer at the Soviet Em
bassy here was expelled from the country yesterday after being caught
by the FBI with incriminating documents, souices said last night.
Maj. Gen. Vasiliy Chitov, the embassy military attache and a member
of the Soviet intelligence agency CRU, was declared "persona non
grata" and told to leave the couniry, the sources said. He left on a com
mercial flight at midday yesterday, they said.
He was taken into custody last weekend, the sources said, after a high
speed chase through Washington streets.
It was not immediately clear what kind of documents Chitov had in
his possession or whether any U.S. military or government employees
were suspected as being accomplices in the case.
Chitov apparently was not arrested and charged with espionage be
cause he was protected by diplomatic immunity.
FBI Director William Webster and other law enforcement officials
have complained in recent months about an increase in the number of
diplomatic personnel representing the Soviet Union and other com
munist nations in the United States. The increase has complicated the
work of FBI counterintelligence agents, Webster said.
Soviet bloc countries have concentrated espionage efforts in recent
years on gaining access to U.S. high technology that gives U.S. weapons
systems superiority over many such Soviet systems.
Reagan submits draft treaty to Soviets
Washington —r President Ronald Reagan announced yesterday that
he has submitted a draft treaty to the Soviet Union that would carry out
his plan to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
"Such a treaty would be a major contribution to security, stability and
peace," Reagan said in a statement issued at the White House. "I call on
President (Leonid) Brezhnev to join us in this important first step to re
duce the nuclear shadow that hangs over the peoples of the world."
The draft treaty, submitted by U.S. negotiators to their Soviet coun
terparts at Geneva on Tuesday, embodied the proposals Reagan made
last Nov. 18 in a speech at the National Press Club which the president
called "a broad program tor peace."
In that speech Reagan proposed to scrap the planned deployment of
Pershing II and surface-launched Cruise missiles if the Soviets dis
mantled their SS-4, SS-5 and SS-20 missiles. The U.S. missiles are not
scheduled for deployment until late in 1983 or early 1984, while the Rus
sian missiles are already in place.
The U.S. proposal to trade off missiles which are not yet deployed for
those which already are was promptly denounced by the Soviets. On
Wednesday, in Moscow, Brezhnev proposed to reduce U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles in Europe by two-thirds by 1990 and charged
that the United States was not engaged in serious negotiations at Gene
va.
Reagan warned on tax exemptions
Washington — A federal judge here yesterday warned Reagan admin
istration officials that they would b" in rontemo' 1 nurt if 'hey defy his
order and try to restore tax exemptio. i ;mu iminoicry private
schools in Mississippi.
Administration officials were tongue-lashed as well at a
hearing by members of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee who attacked their legal reasoning and, at times, their
motives in the controversial Jan. 8 decision to reverse prior
policy and grant exemptions for discriminatory schools. Rep.
William Brodhead (D-Mich.) said their testimony was "the
most incredibly unbelievable crap" he'd ever witnessed
before Congress.
The president now is pushing legislation that would ex
plicitly ban exemptions for such schools but congressional
leaders have expressed no interest in the bill and suggested
some type of resolution instead. Several committee mem
bers yesterday pleaded with administration witnesses to let
the issue be decided by the Supreme Court.
U.S. District Judge George Hart raised the question of con
tempt during a hearing in which civil rights lawyers were re
questing that he not limit his injunction against tax exemp
tions to Mississippi, but extend it to apply to the whole coun
try. They argued that tax policy must be uniform nationally,
but Hart denied their petition, saying he had no jurisdiction
to make the injunction nationwide.
Hart added, however, that he would hold the adminis
tration in contempt if its plans for restoring exemptions ap
plied to Mississippi schools. He said he doubted government
officials would try that "unless they like jail." And William
Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division, said the administration has no intention of violating
Hart's order.
Pope meets with Polish archbishop
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II held "extremely deli
cate" talks yesterday with leaders of Poland's Roman Catho
lic church in an effort to agree on church policy toward the
martial law crackdown, informed sources said.
Vatican officials said the Polish-born pontiff received the
Polish primate, Archbishop Jozef Glemp, and two other visit
ing Polish prelates, shortly after their arrival from Warsaw.
"The talks are extremely delicate. There is no lack of mat
ters to be discussed," said a member of the Polish delegation
who requested anonymity.
It was the pope's first meeting with Glemp since Polish au
thorities declared martial law Dec. 13 and suspended the
church-backed Solidarity trade union, the only independent
labor movement in the Soviet bloc.
The pope counseled patience in the early days of martial
law, but as the crackdown continued he has shown increas
ing impatience with the military grip, the internments
without trial and the suspension of independent union ac
tivities.
Mine fines fall as fatalities rise
Federal mine inspectors are issuing fewer violation no
tices, closing fewer mines for safety reasons and collecting
less in fines at a time when fatalities from mine accidentsap
pear to be on the rise.
Twenty miners have been killed in the coal fields since Jan.
1, compared with nine a year ago. A total of 153 miners were
killed in 1981, the highest annual rate since 1975.
The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Adminis
tration (MSHA), which is required to inspect all under
ground coal mines four times a year, is being squeezed bv

budget problems just like other agencies.
Attrition and the federal hiring freeze combined to cut by
9 peri em the number ot i oal inspectors actually on the job
from 1 JB9 to 1264 between the end of fiscal 1979 and fiscal
1981.
"We are losing our best inspectors to industrv," according
to a source in an MSHA field office. "Previously we could
keep them because of the continuity of the work and the
dignity of the job, but no longer.
"If you asked, Does that account for these disasters?' I
would sav I hope not, but it troubles me."
MSHA administrator Ford Ford said he could not be "de
finitive" on whether such uncertainties might have con
tributed to laxness in the field. "A great number of our in
spectors come from coal mining and coal mining families. I
would sa\ the\ are doing a good job. I can't say how individ
uals react."
The General Accounting Office, at the request of Rep.
Sick J. Rahall II (D-VV.Va.) is three weeks into an investiga
tion or whether MSH A is, in fact, performing the inspections
the law requires.
Nuclear emergency drills debated
Washington — At least two members of the Nuclear Regu
lator Commission said yesterday they will resist efforts to
loosen the rules on how often emergency drills must be held
in areas v\ ith atomic power plants.
Commissioners Victor Gilinsky and John Ahearne ex
pressed the opinion at a meeting at which the NRC staff and
representatives of the Federal Emergency Management
\genc> proposed that full emergency exercises be held
once every two years at each nuclear plant. The current rule
is once every year.
Lee Thomas, associate director of FEMA's state and local
programs and support division, said the proposed rule
would allow the ordering of either full or partial exercises
the following year for plants where the regular drill was in
adequate.
The rule would also require an emergency exercise involv
ing just the nuclear plant, but not state and local emergency
agencies, at least once a year, Thomas said.
However, Gilinsky said he'd prefer leaving the require
ment at once a year for a full exercise but allowing FEMA to
let plants where the exercise went well to skip rerunning it
the following year.
"I would prefer to keep it as we have it," said Ahearne. "I
would support backing off to Vic's position but that's as faras
I can go."
Neither NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino nor Com
missioner Thomas Roberts expressed a clear opinion on the
rule change proposed by FEMA and the NRC staff.
Reagan hopes to gut Education Dept.
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's proposal to
downgrade the Education Department to a foundation
would strip it of all civil rights enforcement powers and
would ban the Justice Department from seeking to impose
racial quotas on colleges accused of discrimination.
The Reagan administration is planning to send Congress
on Monday, along with the fiscal 1983 budget, the proposed
legislation to convert the two-year-old department to a
>tripped-down Foundation for Education Assistance.

The Associated Press obtained .1 copy of the proposal and
other documents yesterday from a coalition of education
groups fighting to thwart the move.
The bill is certain to face rough sledding in Congress. Sev
eral key lawmakers have expressed reluctance to downgrade
the department and top department officials confide in
private that it will be hard to achieve in an election year.
In its preamble, the draft declares that "a Cabinet-level
Department of Education threatens to preempt the role of
localities and the states in determining policy for education;
the role of the federal government in education should be
minimal."
The bill would transfer to the Justice Department responsi
bility to make schools and colleges comply with laws against
discrimination by race, sex, handicap or age. It would in
clude a ban against forced busing. But the proposal would
impose strict timetables and procedures for the Justice De
partment to follow before cutting off federal aid.
In his 1980 campaign, Reagan vowed to dismantle the
Education and Energy departments that former President
Jimmy Carter and Congress created. Reagan repeated that
pledge in his Jan. 26 State of the Union address, but gave no
details.
Mubarak endorses Camp David pact
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose
remarks at the White House Wednesday seemed to dim U.S.
hopes for early progress toward Mideast peace, made a more
positive gesture toward President Ronald Reagan yesterday
by publicly endorsing the Camp David peace process for the
first time since he arrived here.
Following a second day of White House meetings between
the two leaders, Mubarak bid farewell to his host by declar
ing: "We are determined to pursue our peace efforts until a
comprehensive settlement is reached according to the
Camp David accords."
That was in marked contrast to Wednesday's arrival cere
mony, where Mubarak raised eyebrows with his failure to
mention the 1979 Camp David agreements — the cor
nerstone of U.S. efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute —
and instead put his emphasis on calling for self-de
termination and "a national entity" for the Palestinian peo
ple.
His remarks then were taken as a deliberate signal that
Egypt's priorities do not include an early resolution of its 20-
month negotiations with Israel over an autonomy agreement
for the 1.3 million Palestinian inhabitants of Israeli-occupied
territories.
Stocks mixed despite late rally
A late rally in some blue-chip issues enabled the stock
market to finish mixed yesterday despite continuing in
terest-rate uncertainties.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off more than 6
points in the waning stages of the session, closed with a gain
of 2.00 at 847.03.
Today's weather
Fair through Saturday. Lows in the 30s, highs in the 50s and

The Associated Press obtained .1 copy of the proposal and
other documents yesterday from a coalition of education
groups fighting to thwart the move.
The bill is certain to face rough sledding in Congress. Sev
eral key lawmakers have expressed reluctance to downgrade
the department and top department officials confide in
private that it will be hard to achieve in an election year.
In its preamble, the draft declares that "a Cabinet-level
Department of Education threatens to preempt the role of
localities and the states in determining policy for education;
the role of the federal government in education should be
minimal."
The bill would transfer to the Justice Department responsi
bility to make schools and colleges comply with laws against
discrimination by race, sex, handicap or age. It would in
clude a ban against forced busing. But the proposal would
impose strict timetables and procedures for the Justice De
partment to follow before cutting off federal aid.
In his 1980 campaign, Reagan vowed to dismantle the
Education and Energy departments that former President
Jimmy Carter and Congress created. Reagan repeated that

Mubarak endorses Camp David pact
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose
remarks at the White House Wednesday seemed to dim U.S.
hopes for early progress toward Mideast peace, made a more
positive gesture toward President Ronald Reagan yesterday
by publicly endorsing the Camp David peace process for the
first time since he arrived here.
Following a second day of White House meetings between
the two leaders, Mubarak bid farewell to his host by declar
ing: "We are determined to pursue our peace efforts until a
comprehensive settlement is reached according to the
Camp David accords."
That was in marked contrast to Wednesday's arrival cere
mony, where Mubarak raised eyebrows with his failure to
mention the 1979 Camp David agreements — the cor
nerstone of U.S. efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute —
and instead put his emphasis on calling for self-de
termination and "a national entity" for the Palestinian peo
ple.
His remarks then were taken as a deliberate signal that
Egypt's priorities do not include an early resolution of its 20-
month negotiations with Israel over an autonomy agreement
for the 1.3 million Palestinian inhabitants of Israeli-occupied
territories.

Russian general expelled from U.S.
Washington — The highest-ranking military officer at the Soviet Em
bassy here was expelled from the country yesterday after being caught
by the FBI with incriminating documents, souices said last night.
Maj. Gen. Vasiliy Chitov, the embassy military attache and a member
of the Soviet intelligence agency CRU, was declared "persona non
grata" and told to leave the couniry, the sources said. He left on a com
mercial flight at midday yesterday, they said.
He was taken into custody last weekend, the sources said, after a high
speed chase through Washington streets.
It was not immediately clear what kind of documents Chitov had in
his possession or whether any U.S. military or government employees
were suspected as being accomplices in the case.
Chitov apparently was not arrested and charged with espionage be
cause he was protected by diplomatic immunity.
FBI Director William Webster and other law enforcement officials
have complained in recent months about an increase in the number of
diplomatic personnel representing the Soviet Union and other com
munist nations in the United States. The increase has complicated the
work of FBI counterintelligence agents, Webster said.
Soviet bloc countries have concentrated espionage efforts in recent
years on gaining access to U.S. high technology that gives U.S. weapons
systems superiority over many such Soviet systems.
Reagan submits draft treaty to Soviets
Washington —r President Ronald Reagan announced yesterday that
he has submitted a draft treaty to the Soviet Union that would carry out
his plan to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
"Such a treaty would be a major contribution to security, stability and
peace," Reagan said in a statement issued at the White House. "I call on
President (Leonid) Brezhnev to join us in this important first step to re
duce the nuclear shadow that hangs over the peoples of the world."
The draft treaty, submitted by U.S. negotiators to their Soviet coun
terparts at Geneva on Tuesday, embodied the proposals Reagan made
last Nov. 18 in a speech at the National Press Club which the president
called "a broad program tor peace."
In that speech Reagan proposed to scrap the planned deployment of
Pershing II and surface-launched Cruise missiles if the Soviets dis
mantled their SS-4, SS-5 and SS-20 missiles. The U.S. missiles are not
scheduled for deployment until late in 1983 or early 1984, while the Rus
sian missiles are already in place.
The U.S. proposal to trade off missiles which are not yet deployed for
those which already are was promptly denounced by the Soviets. On
Wednesday, in Moscow, Brezhnev proposed to reduce U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles in Europe by two-thirds by 1990 and charged
that the United States was not engaged in serious negotiations at Gene
va.
Reagan warned on tax exemptions
Washington — A federal judge here yesterday warned Reagan admin
istration officials that they would b" in rontemo' 1 nurt if 'hey defy his
order and try to restore tax exemptio. i ;mu iminoicry private
schools in Mississippi.
Administration officials were tongue-lashed as well at a
hearing by members of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee who attacked their legal reasoning and, at times, their
motives in the controversial Jan. 8 decision to reverse prior
policy and grant exemptions for discriminatory schools. Rep.
William Brodhead (D-Mich.) said their testimony was "the
most incredibly unbelievable crap" he'd ever witnessed
before Congress.
The president now is pushing legislation that would ex
plicitly ban exemptions for such schools but congressional
leaders have expressed no interest in the bill and suggested
some type of resolution instead. Several committee mem
bers yesterday pleaded with administration witnesses to let
the issue be decided by the Supreme Court.
U.S. District Judge George Hart raised the question of con
tempt during a hearing in which civil rights lawyers were re
questing that he not limit his injunction against tax exemp
tions to Mississippi, but extend it to apply to the whole coun
try. They argued that tax policy must be uniform nationally,
but Hart denied their petition, saying he had no jurisdiction
to make the injunction nationwide.
Hart added, however, that he would hold the adminis
tration in contempt if its plans for restoring exemptions ap
plied to Mississippi schools. He said he doubted government
officials would try that "unless they like jail." And William
Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division, said the administration has no intention of violating
Hart's order.
Pope meets with Polish archbishop
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II held "extremely deli
cate" talks yesterday with leaders of Poland's Roman Catho
lic church in an effort to agree on church policy toward the
martial law crackdown, informed sources said.
Vatican officials said the Polish-born pontiff received the
Polish primate, Archbishop Jozef Glemp, and two other visit
ing Polish prelates, shortly after their arrival from Warsaw.
"The talks are extremely delicate. There is no lack of mat
ters to be discussed," said a member of the Polish delegation
who requested anonymity.
It was the pope's first meeting with Glemp since Polish au
thorities declared martial law Dec. 13 and suspended the
church-backed Solidarity trade union, the only independent
labor movement in the Soviet bloc.
The pope counseled patience in the early days of martial
law, but as the crackdown continued he has shown increas
ing impatience with the military grip, the internments
without trial and the suspension of independent union ac
tivities.
Mine fines fall as fatalities rise
Federal mine inspectors are issuing fewer violation no
tices, closing fewer mines for safety reasons and collecting
less in fines at a time when fatalities from mine accidentsap
pear to be on the rise.
Twenty miners have been killed in the coal fields since Jan.
1, compared with nine a year ago. A total of 153 miners were
killed in 1981, the highest annual rate since 1975.
The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Adminis
tration (MSHA), which is required to inspect all under
ground coal mines four times a year, is being squeezed bv

budget problems just like other agencies.
Attrition and the federal hiring freeze combined to cut by
9 peri em the number ot i oal inspectors actually on the job
from 1 JB9 to 1264 between the end of fiscal 1979 and fiscal
1981.
"We are losing our best inspectors to industrv," according
to a source in an MSHA field office. "Previously we could
keep them because of the continuity of the work and the
dignity of the job, but no longer.
"If you asked, Does that account for these disasters?' I
would sav I hope not, but it troubles me."
MSHA administrator Ford Ford said he could not be "de
finitive" on whether such uncertainties might have con
tributed to laxness in the field. "A great number of our in
spectors come from coal mining and coal mining families. I
would sa\ the\ are doing a good job. I can't say how individ
uals react."
The General Accounting Office, at the request of Rep.
Sick J. Rahall II (D-VV.Va.) is three weeks into an investiga
tion or whether MSH A is, in fact, performing the inspections
the law requires.
Nuclear emergency drills debated
Washington — At least two members of the Nuclear Regu
lator Commission said yesterday they will resist efforts to
loosen the rules on how often emergency drills must be held
in areas v\ ith atomic power plants.
Commissioners Victor Gilinsky and John Ahearne ex
pressed the opinion at a meeting at which the NRC staff and
representatives of the Federal Emergency Management
\genc> proposed that full emergency exercises be held
once every two years at each nuclear plant. The current rule
is once every year.
Lee Thomas, associate director of FEMA's state and local
programs and support division, said the proposed rule
would allow the ordering of either full or partial exercises
the following year for plants where the regular drill was in
adequate.
The rule would also require an emergency exercise involv
ing just the nuclear plant, but not state and local emergency
agencies, at least once a year, Thomas said.
However, Gilinsky said he'd prefer leaving the require
ment at once a year for a full exercise but allowing FEMA to
let plants where the exercise went well to skip rerunning it
the following year.
"I would prefer to keep it as we have it," said Ahearne. "I
would support backing off to Vic's position but that's as faras
I can go."
Neither NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino nor Com
missioner Thomas Roberts expressed a clear opinion on the
rule change proposed by FEMA and the NRC staff.
Reagan hopes to gut Education Dept.
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's proposal to
downgrade the Education Department to a foundation
would strip it of all civil rights enforcement powers and
would ban the Justice Department from seeking to impose
racial quotas on colleges accused of discrimination.

on Monday, along with the fiscal 1983 budget, the proposed
legislation to convert the two-year-old department to a

Nuclear emergency drills debated
Washington — At least two members of the Nuclear Regu
lator Commission said yesterday they will resist efforts to
loosen the rules on how often emergency drills must be held
in areas v\ ith atomic power plants.
Commissioners Victor Gilinsky and John Ahearne ex
pressed the opinion at a meeting at which the NRC staff and
representatives of the Federal Emergency Management
\genc> proposed that full emergency exercises be held
once every two years at each nuclear plant. The current rule
is once every year.
Lee Thomas, associate director of FEMA's state and local
programs and support division, said the proposed rule
would allow the ordering of either full or partial exercises
the following year for plants where the regular drill was in
adequate.
The rule would also require an emergency exercise involv
ing just the nuclear plant, but not state and local emergency
agencies, at least once a year, Thomas said.
However, Gilinsky said he'd prefer leaving the require
ment at once a year for a full exercise but allowing FEMA to
let plants where the exercise went well to skip rerunning it
the following year.
"I would prefer to keep it as we have it," said Ahearne. "I
would support backing off to Vic's position but that's as faras
I can go."
Neither NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino nor Com
missioner Thomas Roberts expressed a clear opinion on the
rule change proposed by FEMA and the NRC staff.
Reagan hopes to gut Education Dept.
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's proposal to
downgrade the Education Department to a foundation
would strip it of all civil rights enforcement powers and
would ban the Justice Department from seeking to impose
racial quotas on colleges accused of discrimination.
The Reagan administration is planning to send Congress
on Monday, along with the fiscal 1983 budget, the proposed
legislation to convert the two-year-old department to a
>tripped-down Foundation for Education Assistance.

The Associated Press obtained .1 copy of the proposal and
other documents yesterday from a coalition of education
groups fighting to thwart the move.
The bill is certain to face rough sledding in Congress. Sev
eral key lawmakers have expressed reluctance to downgrade
the department and top department officials confide in
private that it will be hard to achieve in an election year.
In its preamble, the draft declares that "a Cabinet-level
Department of Education threatens to preempt the role of
localities and the states in determining policy for education;
the role of the federal government in education should be
minimal."
The bill would transfer to the Justice Department responsi
bility to make schools and colleges comply with laws against
discrimination by race, sex, handicap or age. It would in
clude a ban against forced busing. But the proposal would
impose strict timetables and procedures for the Justice De
partment to follow before cutting off federal aid.
In his 1980 campaign, Reagan vowed to dismantle the
Education and Energy departments that former President
Jimmy Carter and Congress created. Reagan repeated that
pledge in his Jan. 26 State of the Union address, but gave no
details.
Mubarak endorses Camp David pact
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose
remarks at the White House Wednesday seemed to dim U.S.
hopes for early progress toward Mideast peace, made a more
positive gesture toward President Ronald Reagan yesterday
by publicly endorsing the Camp David peace process for the
first time since he arrived here.
Following a second day of White House meetings between
the two leaders, Mubarak bid farewell to his host by declar
ing: "We are determined to pursue our peace efforts until a
comprehensive settlement is reached according to the
Camp David accords."
That was in marked contrast to Wednesday's arrival cere
mony, where Mubarak raised eyebrows with his failure to
mention the 1979 Camp David agreements — the cor
nerstone of U.S. efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute —
and instead put his emphasis on calling for self-de
termination and "a national entity" for the Palestinian peo
ple.
His remarks then were taken as a deliberate signal that
Egypt's priorities do not include an early resolution of its 20-
month negotiations with Israel over an autonomy agreement
for the 1.3 million Palestinian inhabitants of Israeli-occupied
territories.

Russian general expelled from U.S.
Washington — The highest-ranking military officer at the Soviet Em
bassy here was expelled from the country yesterday after being caught
by the FBI with incriminating documents, souices said last night.
Maj. Gen. Vasiliy Chitov, the embassy military attache and a member
of the Soviet intelligence agency CRU, was declared "persona non
grata" and told to leave the couniry, the sources said. He left on a com
mercial flight at midday yesterday, they said.
He was taken into custody last weekend, the sources said, after a high
speed chase through Washington streets.
It was not immediately clear what kind of documents Chitov had in
his possession or whether any U.S. military or government employees
were suspected as being accomplices in the case.
Chitov apparently was not arrested and charged with espionage be
cause he was protected by diplomatic immunity.
FBI Director William Webster and other law enforcement officials
have complained in recent months about an increase in the number of
diplomatic personnel representing the Soviet Union and other com
munist nations in the United States. The increase has complicated the
work of FBI counterintelligence agents, Webster said.
Soviet bloc countries have concentrated espionage efforts in recent
years on gaining access to U.S. high technology that gives U.S. weapons
systems superiority over many such Soviet systems.
Reagan submits draft treaty to Soviets
Washington —r President Ronald Reagan announced yesterday that
he has submitted a draft treaty to the Soviet Union that would carry out
his plan to eliminate all medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe.
"Such a treaty would be a major contribution to security, stability and
peace," Reagan said in a statement issued at the White House. "I call on
President (Leonid) Brezhnev to join us in this important first step to re
duce the nuclear shadow that hangs over the peoples of the world."
The draft treaty, submitted by U.S. negotiators to their Soviet coun
terparts at Geneva on Tuesday, embodied the proposals Reagan made
last Nov. 18 in a speech at the National Press Club which the president
called "a broad program tor peace."
In that speech Reagan proposed to scrap the planned deployment of
Pershing II and surface-launched Cruise missiles if the Soviets dis
mantled their SS-4, SS-5 and SS-20 missiles. The U.S. missiles are not
scheduled for deployment until late in 1983 or early 1984, while the Rus
sian missiles are already in place.
The U.S. proposal to trade off missiles which are not yet deployed for
those which already are was promptly denounced by the Soviets. On
Wednesday, in Moscow, Brezhnev proposed to reduce U.S. and Soviet
medium-range missiles in Europe by two-thirds by 1990 and charged
that the United States was not engaged in serious negotiations at Gene
va.
Reagan warned on tax exemptions
Washington — A federal judge here yesterday warned Reagan admin
istration officials that they would b" in rontemo' 1 nurt if 'hey defy his
order and try to restore tax exemptio. i ;mu iminoicry private
schools in Mississippi.
Administration officials were tongue-lashed as well at a
hearing by members of the House Ways and Means Commit
tee who attacked their legal reasoning and, at times, their
motives in the controversial Jan. 8 decision to reverse prior
policy and grant exemptions for discriminatory schools. Rep.
William Brodhead (D-Mich.) said their testimony was "the
most incredibly unbelievable crap" he'd ever witnessed
before Congress.
The president now is pushing legislation that would ex
plicitly ban exemptions for such schools but congressional
leaders have expressed no interest in the bill and suggested
some type of resolution instead. Several committee mem
bers yesterday pleaded with administration witnesses to let
the issue be decided by the Supreme Court.
U.S. District Judge George Hart raised the question of con
tempt during a hearing in which civil rights lawyers were re
questing that he not limit his injunction against tax exemp
tions to Mississippi, but extend it to apply to the whole coun
try. They argued that tax policy must be uniform nationally,
but Hart denied their petition, saying he had no jurisdiction
to make the injunction nationwide.
Hart added, however, that he would hold the adminis
tration in contempt if its plans for restoring exemptions ap
plied to Mississippi schools. He said he doubted government
officials would try that "unless they like jail." And William
Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division, said the administration has no intention of violating
Hart's order.
Pope meets with Polish archbishop
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II held "extremely deli
cate" talks yesterday with leaders of Poland's Roman Catho
lic church in an effort to agree on church policy toward the
martial law crackdown, informed sources said.
Vatican officials said the Polish-born pontiff received the
Polish primate, Archbishop Jozef Glemp, and two other visit
ing Polish prelates, shortly after their arrival from Warsaw.
"The talks are extremely delicate. There is no lack of mat
ters to be discussed," said a member of the Polish delegation
who requested anonymity.
It was the pope's first meeting with Glemp since Polish au
thorities declared martial law Dec. 13 and suspended the
church-backed Solidarity trade union, the only independent
labor movement in the Soviet bloc.
The pope counseled patience in the early days of martial
law, but as the crackdown continued he has shown increas
ing impatience with the military grip, the internments
without trial and the suspension of independent union ac
tivities.
Mine fines fall as fatalities rise
Federal mine inspectors are issuing fewer violation no
tices, closing fewer mines for safety reasons and collecting
less in fines at a time when fatalities from mine accidentsap
pear to be on the rise.
Twenty miners have been killed in the coal fields since Jan.
1, compared with nine a year ago. A total of 153 miners were
killed in 1981, the highest annual rate since 1975.
The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Adminis
tration (MSHA), which is required to inspect all under
ground coal mines four times a year, is being squeezed bv

budget problems just like other agencies.
Attrition and the federal hiring freeze combined to cut by
9 peri em the number ot i oal inspectors actually on the job
from 1 JB9 to 1264 between the end of fiscal 1979 and fiscal
1981.

policy and grant exemptions for discriminatory schools. Rep.
William Brodhead (D-Mich.) said their testimony was "the
most incredibly unbelievable crap" he'd ever witnessed
before Congress.
The president now is pushing legislation that would ex
plicitly ban exemptions for such schools but congressional
leaders have expressed no interest in the bill and suggested
some type of resolution instead. Several committee mem
bers yesterday pleaded with administration witnesses to let
the issue be decided by the Supreme Court.
U.S. District Judge George Hart raised the question of con
tempt during a hearing in which civil rights lawyers were re
questing that he not limit his injunction against tax exemp
tions to Mississippi, but extend it to apply to the whole coun
try. They argued that tax policy must be uniform nationally,
but Hart denied their petition, saying he had no jurisdiction
to make the injunction nationwide.
Hart added, however, that he would hold the adminis
tration in contempt if its plans for restoring exemptions ap
plied to Mississippi schools. He said he doubted government
officials would try that "unless they like jail." And William
Reynolds, head of the Justice Department's civil rights
division, said the administration has no intention of violating
Hart's order.
Pope meets with Polish archbishop
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II held "extremely deli
cate" talks yesterday with leaders of Poland's Roman Catho
lic church in an effort to agree on church policy toward the
martial law crackdown, informed sources said.
Vatican officials said the Polish-born pontiff received the
Polish primate, Archbishop Jozef Glemp, and two other visit
ing Polish prelates, shortly after their arrival from Warsaw.
"The talks are extremely delicate. There is no lack of mat
ters to be discussed," said a member of the Polish delegation
who requested anonymity.
It was the pope's first meeting with Glemp since Polish au
thorities declared martial law Dec. 13 and suspended the
church-backed Solidarity trade union, the only independent
labor movement in the Soviet bloc.
The pope counseled patience in the early days of martial
law, but as the crackdown continued he has shown increas
ing impatience with the military grip, the internments
without trial and the suspension of independent union ac
tivities.
Mine fines fall as fatalities rise
Federal mine inspectors are issuing fewer violation no
tices, closing fewer mines for safety reasons and collecting
less in fines at a time when fatalities from mine accidentsap
pear to be on the rise.
Twenty miners have been killed in the coal fields since Jan.
1, compared with nine a year ago. A total of 153 miners were
killed in 1981, the highest annual rate since 1975.
The Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Adminis
tration (MSHA), which is required to inspect all under
ground coal mines four times a year, is being squeezed bv

budget problems just like other agencies.
Attrition and the federal hiring freeze combined to cut by
9 peri em the number ot i oal inspectors actually on the job
from 1 JB9 to 1264 between the end of fiscal 1979 and fiscal
1981.
"We are losing our best inspectors to industrv," according
to a source in an MSHA field office. "Previously we could
keep them because of the continuity of the work and the
dignity of the job, but no longer.
"If you asked, Does that account for these disasters?' I
would sav I hope not, but it troubles me."
MSHA administrator Ford Ford said he could not be "de
finitive" on whether such uncertainties might have con
tributed to laxness in the field. "A great number of our in
spectors come from coal mining and coal mining families. I
would sa\ the\ are doing a good job. I can't say how individ
uals react."
The General Accounting Office, at the request of Rep.
Sick J. Rahall II (D-VV.Va.) is three weeks into an investiga
tion or whether MSH A is, in fact, performing the inspections
the law requires.
Nuclear emergency drills debated
Washington — At least two members of the Nuclear Regu
lator Commission said yesterday they will resist efforts to
loosen the rules on how often emergency drills must be held
in areas v\ ith atomic power plants.
Commissioners Victor Gilinsky and John Ahearne ex
pressed the opinion at a meeting at which the NRC staff and
representatives of the Federal Emergency Management
\genc> proposed that full emergency exercises be held
once every two years at each nuclear plant. The current rule
is once every year.
Lee Thomas, associate director of FEMA's state and local
programs and support division, said the proposed rule
would allow the ordering of either full or partial exercises
the following year for plants where the regular drill was in
adequate.
The rule would also require an emergency exercise involv
ing just the nuclear plant, but not state and local emergency
agencies, at least once a year, Thomas said.
However, Gilinsky said he'd prefer leaving the require
ment at once a year for a full exercise but allowing FEMA to
let plants where the exercise went well to skip rerunning it
the following year.
"I would prefer to keep it as we have it," said Ahearne. "I
would support backing off to Vic's position but that's as faras
I can go."
Neither NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino nor Com
missioner Thomas Roberts expressed a clear opinion on the
rule change proposed by FEMA and the NRC staff.
Reagan hopes to gut Education Dept.
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's proposal to
downgrade the Education Department to a foundation
would strip it of all civil rights enforcement powers and
would ban the Justice Department from seeking to impose
racial quotas on colleges accused of discrimination.
The Reagan administration is planning to send Congress
on Monday, along with the fiscal 1983 budget, the proposed
legislation to convert the two-year-old department to a
>tripped-down Foundation for Education Assistance.

The Associated Press obtained .1 copy of the proposal and
other documents yesterday from a coalition of education
groups fighting to thwart the move.
The bill is certain to face rough sledding in Congress. Sev
eral key lawmakers have expressed reluctance to downgrade
the department and top department officials confide in
private that it will be hard to achieve in an election year.
In its preamble, the draft declares that "a Cabinet-level
Department of Education threatens to preempt the role of
localities and the states in determining policy for education;
the role of the federal government in education should be
minimal."
The bill would transfer to the Justice Department responsi
bility to make schools and colleges comply with laws against
discrimination by race, sex, handicap or age. It would in
clude a ban against forced busing. But the proposal would
impose strict timetables and procedures for the Justice De
partment to follow before cutting off federal aid.
In his 1980 campaign, Reagan vowed to dismantle the
Education and Energy departments that former President
Jimmy Carter and Congress created. Reagan repeated that
pledge in his Jan. 26 State of the Union address, but gave no
details.
Mubarak endorses Camp David pact
Washington — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, whose
remarks at the White House Wednesday seemed to dim U.S.
hopes for early progress toward Mideast peace, made a more
positive gesture toward President Ronald Reagan yesterday
by publicly endorsing the Camp David peace process for the
first time since he arrived here.
Following a second day of White House meetings between
the two leaders, Mubarak bid farewell to his host by declar
ing: "We are determined to pursue our peace efforts until a
comprehensive settlement is reached according to the
Camp David accords."
That was in marked contrast to Wednesday's arrival cere
mony, where Mubarak raised eyebrows with his failure to
mention the 1979 Camp David agreements — the cor
nerstone of U.S. efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute —
and instead put his emphasis on calling for self-de
termination and "a national entity" for the Palestinian peo
ple.
His remarks then were taken as a deliberate signal that
Egypt's priorities do not include an early resolution of its 20-
month negotiations with Israel over an autonomy agreement
for the 1.3 million Palestinian inhabitants of Israeli-occupied
territories.
