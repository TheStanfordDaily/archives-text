The Philadelphia Story****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barr> stage play — no photo

graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in

eludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over
the Rainbow" as if he'd stake his
reputation on it.
Plays Wednesday withg
Cukor's latest, Rich and Famous.

Ghost Story *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
you begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.

Citizen Kane*****
Monday, Kresge
Kane's reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. Orson Welles, who
directed, starred, and co-wrote,
infused this masterwork of the
sound era with a sense of pure joy
in the capabilities of the medium.
Image and sound work together
as they do in no other movie; it is
a cinematic Chinese puzzle, and
part of the pleasure it gives is
from this sense of participation in
unearthing the secrets of Charles
Foster Kane and of film itself.
Welles gives a marvelous per
formance, as do his co-stars Ev
erett Sloane, Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy
Commingore, and many others.

Ghost Story *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
you begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.

Citizen Kane*****
Monday, Kresge
Kane's reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. Orson Welles, who
directed, starred, and co-wrote,
infused this masterwork of the
sound era with a sense of pure joy
in the capabilities of the medium.
Image and sound work together
as they do in no other movie; it is
a cinematic Chinese puzzle, and
part of the pleasure it gives is
from this sense of participation in
unearthing the secrets of Charles
Foster Kane and of film itself.
Welles gives a marvelous per
formance, as do his co-stars Ev
erett Sloane, Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy
Commingore, and many others.

The Philadelphia Story****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barr> stage play — no photo

graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in

eludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over
the Rainbow" as if he'd stake his
reputation on it.
Plays Wednesday withg
Cukor's latest, Rich and Famous.

Ghost Story *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
you begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.

Citizen Kane*****
Monday, Kresge
Kane's reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. Orson Welles, who
directed, starred, and co-wrote,
infused this masterwork of the
sound era with a sense of pure joy
in the capabilities of the medium.
Image and sound work together
as they do in no other movie; it is
a cinematic Chinese puzzle, and
part of the pleasure it gives is
from this sense of participation in
unearthing the secrets of Charles
Foster Kane and of film itself.
Welles gives a marvelous per
formance, as do his co-stars Ev
erett Sloane, Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy
Commingore, and many others.

for it, and so's the movie. Mon
tenegro, in case you're wonder
ing, is the name of the Yugoslav
she has an affair with. No, I don't
know why they named the movie
after him. (For weeks I thought
this was a movie about a Carib
bean resort. It looks like I was
right, though — Montenegro is
the name of the place that movies
go when they die.i . * •

• Whose I it AMway? *Vi
Guild, Menlo Park
Kenneth McMillap gives an ex
tremely intelligent, [Varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
3 the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car ari :dent but
becomes a quadroplegic and
sues for the right to be allowed to
die. Richard Dreyfuss struggles
manfully with an impossible role
that he isn't really right for: he
isn't a physical enough actor to
suggest, in the pre-accident and
flSshbarct dream sequences, that
thrliSss of his hands has really
rendered lifduseless for him.

Gone with the Wind****
Fox, Redwood City
This is studio production mak
ing at its height. The "maverick"
producer David O. Selznick,
whose fixation .this was, suc
ceeded in putt itiß a polish on this
tilm that's sometimes suffocating
but more often great fun. It's a
movie to gawk at — like resplen
dent jewelry, it doesn't really
matter whetht r its shine is real or
paste. Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett
O'Har i Clark (...able plays Rhett
Butler Leslii? Howard plays
As hie* Willies, Olivia de
Havilland plays Melanie, Hattie

McDaniel plays Mammy, Butterf
ly McQueen plays Prissy, and
they're all great. Selznick ran
through four (or was it five?) di
rectors in search of perfection;
his final choice was Victor Flem

The Philadelphia Story****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
give headaches to people trying
to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashedly straight
forward adaptation of the Philip
Barr> stage play — no photo

graphic geegaws or editing
doohickies have been added.
Yet, by almost any definition, it's
an exceedingly good movie.
The key to its success can lie
only in the talent involved in
bringing it to the screen. The di
rector was George Cukor, a
gifted craftsman capable of bring
ing fine performances out of vir
tually any actor. And the actors
aren't just anybody: the cast in

eludes Katharine Hepburn,
nostrils flaring and indignation
aflame; Cary Grant, comic sense
perfectly tuned; and James Stew
art, who drunkenly sings "Over
the Rainbow" as if he'd stake his
reputation on it.
Plays Wednesday withg
Cukor's latest, Rich and Famous.

Ghost Story *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
you begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.

Citizen Kane*****
Monday, Kresge
Kane's reputation as being the
greatest movie ever made
shouldn't scare you away from
seeing it. Orson Welles, who
directed, starred, and co-wrote,
infused this masterwork of the
sound era with a sense of pure joy
in the capabilities of the medium.
Image and sound work together
as they do in no other movie; it is
a cinematic Chinese puzzle, and
part of the pleasure it gives is
from this sense of participation in
unearthing the secrets of Charles
Foster Kane and of film itself.
Welles gives a marvelous per
formance, as do his co-stars Ev
erett Sloane, Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy
Commingore, and many others.
