San Jose — The Committee for the
Recognition of Nursing Achieve
ment (CRONA), the University's
nurses' union, sent a delegation of 30
members to a rally yesterday morn
ing in downtown San lose to demon
strate its support for striking nurses at
four city hospitals.
CRONA President Hedy Dumpel
announced that her group was
donating $1000, to be divided among
the four groups of striking nurses.
She added that CRONA members
would contribute more money on an
individual basis.
"My colleagues and I are here in
support of vou," said Dumpel to an
estimated 450 nurses and sympa
thizers. "We believe union solidarity
is essential."
CRONA, which represents about
1200 registered nurses at Stanford
University Hospital, is presently ne
gotiating a new contract with the
University administration. Its current
20-month agreement expires Febru
ary 28. Dumpel declined to comment
on the progress of the negotiations,
but said that talks were centered on
"practice and economic issues."
Asked if there was any possibility of
a strike here this year, Dumpel said,
"We're not dealing with a strike at
this point, because we're moving
very decisively in the direction of
keeping labor peace."

University nurses haven't been on
strike since 1974, when, after an 11-
da\ walkout, CROW negotiators se
( ured parity with nurses' salaries at
th<> two other major research hospi
tals in the Bay Area.
Yesterday's rally was sponsored bv
the California Nurses Association
(CNA), which represents over 1200
San Jose nurses in the labor disputes
at O'Connor, Good Samaritan, San
Jose and Alexian Brothers hospitalv
CNA nurses have been out on
strike for nearly a month, demanding
wage increases based upon "com
parable worth," or equity in wages
for men and women performing sim
ilar jobs.
According to Federal mediator
Roger Randall, however, nurses are
< urrenfly at a bargaining impasse
with hospital management.
Barbara Nichols, president of the
American Nurses Association, told
the rally that nurses across the nation
are watching events in San Jose.
"Now is the time for nurses to
articulate their worth," Nichols said,
"and demand just reward for their
contribution to health care."
Jim Herman, president of the In
ternational Longshoremen's and
Warehousemen's Union, received a
standing ovation from the group of
nurses for his fiery address on the his
tory of the labor movement.
