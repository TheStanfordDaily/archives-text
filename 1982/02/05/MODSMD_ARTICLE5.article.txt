# Dornan: the optimistic dark horse candidate
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
This is the last in a series on five of
the eight announced Republican
candidates for the LLS. Senate.
Monterey — Rep. Robert Dornan
(R-Santa Monica) is not a well-known
name, but he may be the dark horse
Republican candidate for the U.S.
Senate.
Dornan ranks fifth in a Field poll re
leased yesterday. But an aide at his
Santa Monica campaign head
quarters told t he Daily yesterday that
Dornan is more interested in the the
unofficial poll taken at last week
end's Californiaßepublican Conven

tion in Monterey. The GOP poll
ranked Dornan as the leading Senate
candidate over the other seven can
didates.
Dornan, 48, was born in New York
City and attended Loyola University.
An Air Force fighter pilot for five
years, Dornan was elected to Con
gress in 1976.
Dornan is no stranger to the ways
of the media. He was a TV news an
chorman, television producer and
host of "The Robert Dornan Show,"
and won Emmys in 1968 and 1969 for a
four-hour, issue-oriented daily
show.
The congressman's campaign mot
to is "the right stuff," because he said
in Monterey, "I do have the right
stuff to take (Gov.) Jerry Brown."
Brown is expected to announce his
Senate candidacy shortly.
Dornan would like to debate
Brown, particularly about crime in
California. "I'm courting Brown on
this issue," Dornan said. "There is not
enough regard for the victim in this
state. The victim has been shunted
around too long."
Dornan has authored 23 measures
during his years in Congress, one of
which was a bill to provide tax relief,
and was the first House represent
ative to endorse Prop. 13. He is work
ing to enhance incentives for an all
volunteer military, supported the

Vietnam War and is a passionate
backer of the B-1 bomber, which
earned him the nickname "B-1 Bob."
Recently, Dornan authored a reso
lution which would establish a day
for POW's. "The resolution will be
signed by President Reagan soon,"
he said.
Dornan's campaign literature pro
claims him to be a staunch "conser
vative" who decries campaign re
sources to some candidates from the
"Hollywood/Fonda-Hayden" or
ganizations.
I he "Fonda/Hayden" tactic was
introduced in 1980, when Dornan
was campaigning for re-election
against Democrat Gary Peck, the son
of actor Gregory Peck. 11e raised $1.7
million in that campaign, a sum
which made his the most expensive
I louse race in the c ountry's history.
The funds were primarily raised
through a direct mail solicitation

conducted nationally by Richard
Viguerie of Virginia. Viguerie picks
candidates around the nation then,
with the use of an extensive com
puter mailing list of conservatives, so
licits contributions for selected can
didates.
Dornan and Viguerie have again
embarked on raising funds through
direct mail. The mail solicitation
began in January, and Dornan hopes
to raise an amount equal to the 1980
figures.
