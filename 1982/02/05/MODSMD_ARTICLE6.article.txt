# Exclusive rights to Cyclosporin A make double transplants possible

"Heart-lung transplant" has almost become a house
hold term at the University. But this is not true anywhere
else.
Stanford Hospital is the only pi. ice in the world where
such operations are performed Nancy Lassen, 26, the
sixth heart-lung recipient, is in critical hut stable condi
tion following her surgery on January 20. This is the nor
mal report for the first few weeks after such an opera
tion.
Four of Stanford's first five heart-lung recipients are
doing well. Only one patient did not survive. Karen

Wilson died several days after her July surgery when si ar
"issue from previous open heart surgery caused ex
cessive bleeding.
I he success of the heart-lung transplants is due to a
new immunosuppressant drug, Cyc losporin A, accord
ing to Hospital spokesman Michael Goodkind. -\n im
munosuppressant is necessary to suspend the body's im
mune system so it will accept the new organs. The im
mune system would otherwise fight the foreign tissue
and reject the new organs.
The drug, developed in Switzerland, is not yet licensed
bv the Federal Drug Administration and therefore its use
requires a special license from the
National Institute of Health.
Stanford doctors, among them Dr.
Bruce Reitz, the cardiovascular
surgeon who performed all six trans
plants, discovered the drUg and ob
tained permission to test it here. Be
cause is still in an ex
perimental stage, Stanford Hospital i>
the only place licensed to use it ir
heart-lung transplants.
Goodkind explained that thert
have heen other heart-lung trans
plants using other immunosup
pressants hut none of the patient;
survived very long. They either suf
fered infection caused by the body'?
rejection of the foreign tissue, oi
their windpipes did not heal proper
ly. The drug used in heart transplant'
cannot be used in heart-lung trans
plants because it does not allow tht
windpipe to heal, Goodkind said.
Although Cyclosporin A is being
used for heart transplants at other
hospitals, he said the extension of its
use to heart-lung transplants outside
of Stanford will be a slow process.
Heart-lung transplant patients
must follow a life-long regimen
which includes taking an im
munosuppressant regularly.
Potential heart-lung patients must
be referred here by their doctors anc
are only accepted after University
physicians have agreed that they face
certain death within a year without
the surgery.
Reitz said he hopes longevity
statistics for heart-lung patients will
match those for Stanford's 226 heart
transplant patients, who now have
nearly a three-fourths chance of sur
viving more than a year.
