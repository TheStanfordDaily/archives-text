## Solar research still strong at Stanford 
### Vicki Moore 
Solar energy at Stanford is as strong as ever despite ex
tensive reductions in federal government funding by the
Reagan Administration. Most professors working on solar
energy projects have not yet felt the effects of these
cuts,which apply primarily to applied research rather than
to the basic research commonly done at Stanford, accord
ing to Alan Fahrenbruch, senior research associate in mate
rial science.
"Stanford is doing quite well as far as keeping contracts,"
said Fahrenbruch.
Most of the solar energy research at Stanford concerns
photovoltaic cells and ways to make them more efficient
and less costly. Photovoltaics is a primary interest at Stan
ford because of the sophisticated technology necessary to
develop it, said Gil Masters, adjunct professor of civil engi
neering. He added that most solar thermal research, requir
ing simple technology, is not done at Stanford.
Three people heavily involved in photovoltaic research
are Fahrenbruch, Professor of Material Science Richard
Bube and Richard Swanson, assistant professor of electrical
engineering.
Two routes for making solar cells more economical are
increasing their efficiency by concentrating sunlight on the
cells, which Swanson is investigating, or reducing the mate
rial costs of the cells by using thin film deposition technolo
gy on alternate "emerging" materials, which Bube and
Fahrenbruch's research concerns.
Because of its innate optical properties, silicon, tradi
tionally used for solar cells, must be at least 50times as thick
as the other materials Bube is working with. Silicon solar
cells are used in a single crystal structure and are very ex
pensive to grow. The crystals are then thinly sliced and act as
the structural support of the cell, explained Fahrenbruch.
The average silicon solar cell produces power at a cost of
about $10 to $15 per peak watt (solar cell output when the
sun is directly overhead). To be economically competitive,
the cells would have to cost 25 to 35 cents per peak watt, said
Fahrenbruch. He added that it would cost $50,000 to
$100,000 to make a solar cell house self-sufficient (assuming
one kilowatt per day used).
Thin film solar cells, on the other hand, use much thinner
layers of material which are evaporated onto a glass or metal
substrate. This process avoids the expense of a single crystal
growth, and the glass or metal acts as the structural support,
said Fahrenbruch.
Although currently slightly less efficient than silicon solar
cells, the film cells are much cheaper to make, Fahrenbruch
said.
In the other solar research efforts, Swanson is working on
concentrator solar cells which can increase the cell's effi
ciency. Swanson is using a thermophotovoltaic converterto
concentrate sunlight onto a thin plate made of tungsten or
another metal. The plate, in turn, reradiates energy onto a
silicon cell. In theory, this would double the silicon solar
cell efficiency to 40 percent, according to Swanson, but in
practice, the cells have achieved only 30 percent energy
conversion.
Swanson said that concentrator solar cells can be used ef
fectively only on a large scale system producing one mega
watt. Concentrator cells could be used effectively for
cogeneration systems in industry, or for schools and shop
ping centers rather than for individual homes, he added.
"The problem with solar cells is that they are very capital

intensive and very expensive at the outset," said Swanson.
Significant progress, however, has been made to reduce the
cost of solar cells. Since 1974, the price of solar cells has de
creased 100-fold.
Fahrenbruch criticized the elimination of funding of ap
plied solar research by the Reagan Administration. While
universities will continue to do basic research, private in
dustry must now take up more applied research. Making
such a strict dichotomy between basic research and applied
research cuts off the flow of information between univer
sities and industry, Fahrenbruch asserted.
"There is much secrecy in industry," continued Fahren
bruch. "The university gives out information, but cannot
get back information from industry until they get patents."
Nationwide, funding cuts have had a much more devas
tating effect on government research contracts. Fahren
bruch mentioned that whereas last year SERI (Solar Energy
Research Institute) funded ten research contracts, they now
fund only three. The number of projects on all emerging
materials has been cut from 15-20 to about six, according to
Bube.
Swanson said, however, that there are a substantial
number of industries doing research. Almost all of the ma
jor U.S. oil companies own solar research companies or are
involved in solar energy research.
Energy research at Stanford is also funded by the Institute
for Energy Studies. The institute, founded in 1973 by William
Reynold, chairman of the mechanical engineering depart
ment, has provided seed money for researchers and pro
fessors to get them started in projects. Private industry is ex
pected to fund the continuation and completion of the
projects.
