## 
### Steve Odell Senior sports writer 
Eugene, Oregon — Dick Dißiaso, Stantorci s
head basketball coach for the last seven y ear *' as
announced that he will resign at the end of t is
season. .
Dißiaso informed Athletic Director Andy Geiger
of his decision last Friday. He has guided the
Cardinal to a 7-13 record so far this season, su er
ing through a seven-game losing streak before ob
taining a split in Oregon this weekend.
"It's with mixed feelings that I announced my
resignation," said Dißiaso. "Coaching at Stanford
is both challenging and rewarding. I have tre
mendous amount of respect for my assistants (Cory
Russell and Peter Roby), the players on the team
and Stanford University. It's with this in mind that
the decision was made.
"The pressure began to build with each con
ference loss," said Dißiaso. "I did not want to put
my family through all of that negative criticism un
tila decision was made."
"I have trememdous respect for Dick Dißiaso,
said Geiger following the resignation announce
ment. "All of us at Stanford appreciate the devo
tion and energy he's brought to Stanford basket

ball. He's an experienced person in intercollegiate
athletics, and for that reason, I have offered Dick a
position as an assistant athletic director. But what
ever he chooses to do with his future, he leaves the
basketball program with our respect."
Dißiaso would not comment specifically on his
future plans. "I basically have three alternatives,"
he said from his Eugene hotel room Saturday. "But
before I even begin to think about them, I still have
a responsibility to the team and my assistant
coaches to coach until the end of the season.
"It's very flattering to me to be offered a position
in the department," said Dißiaso. "They obviously
have the feeling that I have certain administrative
skills. I do not see it as just a token offer."
Dißiaso said his other two options were to con
tinue in coaching, or take advantage of some op
portunities in business.
"It's too soon and too emotional a time to try
and decide right now," he said. "I'm just going to
coach the team and kick back a little bit."
Dißiaso said that his resignation was a decision
reached between himself and Geiger.
"I am a part of the athletic department," said
Dißiaso, "and we had to discuss it as an athletic de
partment. After discussing it with Andy on

Wednesday and I hursday, the decision came."
Dißiaso, who turned 41 on Saturday, said his
emotions ran from relief to frustration and disap
pointment. "I've run the gamut emotionally," he
said. "I could pick 10 adjectives to describe how I
feel right now — the best would probably be 'all of
the above.' "
Formerly an assistant coach at Notre Dame,
Dißiaso came to Stanford in 1975. After guiding his
first Card team to an 11-16 record, he was named
Pacific 8 Conference Co-Coach of the Year.
Dißiaso has compiled a 70-111 record in his seven
years here, and owns a 19-year career coaching
mark of 197-146
Dißiaso said he felt that building a winning pro
gram at Stanfoi I would be "difficult, but not im
possible." He also said he felt the success of the
basketball program was imminent.
"I believe the nucleus is there that will enable
the Stanford basketball program to take a step
towards matching the academic excellence of the
University. With one more good recruiting class,
the pieces will >e there to make us competitive."

they would be. "I just don't know,"
he said. "But, hey, we still have to
play. And if basketball is important
enough to play, it's important
enough to do your very best.
"We'll continue to expect max
imum effort from our players," he
went on. "Failure is only failing to do
your best. By those standards, we
have not failed."
Seniorforward Brian Welch said he
was "shocked" when he learned of
the decision before practice last
Thursday.
"It's a tough thing to take," he said

of Dißiaso's resignation. "It's hard to
continue, but that's what we have to
do. I'd never want to be a coach,
there's just no security."
Geiger said the search for a new
basketball coach would begin im
mediately, but no specific hiring
timetable has been set.

basketball program was imminent.

go, Dißiaso said he wasn't sure what
they would be. "I just don't know,"
he said. "But, hey, we still have to
play. And if basketball is important
enough to play, it's important
enough to do your very best.
"We'll continue to expect max
imum effort from our players," he
went on. "Failure is only failing to do
your best. By those standards, we
have not failed."
Seniorforward Brian Welch said he
was "shocked" when he learned of
the decision before practice last
Thursday.
"It's a tough thing to take," he said

of Dißiaso's resignation. "It's hard to
continue, but that's what we have to
do. I'd never want to be a coach,
there's just no security."
Geiger said the search for a new
basketball coach would begin im
mediately, but no specific hiring
timetable has been set.
Eugene, Oregon — Dick Dißiaso, Stantorci s
head basketball coach for the last seven y ear *' as
announced that he will resign at the end of t is
season. .
Dißiaso informed Athletic Director Andy Geiger
of his decision last Friday. He has guided the
Cardinal to a 7-13 record so far this season, su er
ing through a seven-game losing streak before ob
taining a split in Oregon this weekend.
"It's with mixed feelings that I announced my
resignation," said Dißiaso. "Coaching at Stanford
is both challenging and rewarding. I have tre
mendous amount of respect for my assistants (Cory
Russell and Peter Roby), the players on the team
and Stanford University. It's with this in mind that
the decision was made.
"The pressure began to build with each con
ference loss," said Dißiaso. "I did not want to put
my family through all of that negative criticism un
tila decision was made."
"I have trememdous respect for Dick Dißiaso,
said Geiger following the resignation announce
ment. "All of us at Stanford appreciate the devo
tion and energy he's brought to Stanford basket

ball. He's an experienced person in intercollegiate
athletics, and for that reason, I have offered Dick a
position as an assistant athletic director. But what
ever he chooses to do with his future, he leaves the
basketball program with our respect."
Dißiaso would not comment specifically on his
future plans. "I basically have three alternatives,"
he said from his Eugene hotel room Saturday. "But
before I even begin to think about them, I still have
a responsibility to the team and my assistant
coaches to coach until the end of the season.
"It's very flattering to me to be offered a position
in the department," said Dißiaso. "They obviously
have the feeling that I have certain administrative
skills. I do not see it as just a token offer."
Dißiaso said his other two options were to con
tinue in coaching, or take advantage of some op
portunities in business.
"It's too soon and too emotional a time to try
and decide right now," he said. "I'm just going to
coach the team and kick back a little bit."
Dißiaso said that his resignation was a decision
reached between himself and Geiger.
"I am a part of the athletic department," said
Dißiaso, "and we had to discuss it as an athletic de
partment. After discussing it with Andy on

Wednesday and I hursday, the decision came."
Dißiaso, who turned 41 on Saturday, said his
emotions ran from relief to frustration and disap
pointment. "I've run the gamut emotionally," he
said. "I could pick 10 adjectives to describe how I
feel right now — the best would probably be 'all of
the above.' "

Dißiaso came to Stanford in 1975. After guiding his
first Card team to an 11-16 record, he was named
Pacific 8 Conference Co-Coach of the Year.
