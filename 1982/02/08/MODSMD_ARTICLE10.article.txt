# U.S. aims for Saudi co-production deal
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Saudi Arabia — The United
States may seek to enter into an
agreement to co-produce
weapons with moderate Arab
states in the Persian Gulf re
gion, Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger said Satur
day.
The U.S. aim would be to
help defend the Persian Gulf
oil fields against what defense
officials say is a growing Soviet
threat, either of direct in
tervention or, more likely, of
Soviet-aided insurgence in the
Gulf states themselves.
But the Gulf nations — which
include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Oman — see
their most direct threat as com
ing from Israel, not from the
Soviet Union or even from the
radical fundamentalist Moslem
movement spreading from
Iran. So, any suggestion of
American-Arab co-production
of arms is likely to produce a
furor in Israel and to further
strain relations between the
United States and its principal
Middle East ally.
Weinberger, arriving in

Saudi Arabia Saturday on a 10-
day visit to the region, said he
will seek in talks with officials
here and elsewhere to find
how the United States "can
most effectively help some of
the countries within the Gulf
(region) so as to add to our
mutual security."
Co-production of arms,
Weinberger added, "might be
a possibility — a real possi
bility."
American officials declined
to say what such cooperation
might produce, although in
itially it might involve U.S. ma
chinery, spare parts and per
haps ammunition.
Two weeks ago, the six Gulf
states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council declared their inten
tion of forming a joint military
force that would include an air
defense system, military com
mand and, ultimately, a re
gional arms manufacturing fa
cility.
American defense officials
left no doubt that the United
States is eager to cooperate
with the council and its efforts
to form a regional military
force.
"We certainly would en
courage it, we are glad to see it
coming," one senior official
traveling with Weinberger
said. "They need to protect
their oil fields, and if our advice
and assistance is asked for, it
will be forthcoming."
The Saudi defense minister,
Prince Sultan ibn Abdulaziz,
told reporters Saturday that
Saudi Arabia is intersted in
"whatever we can obtain in
line with Arabism and Islam —
in line with these principles."
Co-production is seen by
American officials as one way
of getting around the problem
faced by moderate Arab states
in accepting the United States
as their main arms supplier: It
ties them, in the minds of the
more radical Arabs, to the main
ally of Israel, the enemy of all
Arab states.
