## Sailing the 'social' seas with good times

Springtime, and the living
is easy. At least that's what
Boh Levy and Brian
Mariscal, co-presidents of
the Big Way Yacht Cluh, are
hoping.
Commander Bob and Ad
miral Brian, as the two call
themselves, founded Stan
ford's newest student or
ganization with only goal â€”
to have fun. And so, for $25
(potentially subject to a $5
increase) students can buy a
sturdy rubber boat-like raft,
an oar or two, and a share of
the Big Way Yacht Club fun.
Or, as Levy and Mariscal
put it, "For only $25 you will
receive a Big Way Yacht
completely equipped with
two open air staterooms and
a beautiful ocean side view.
Complete with a paddle the
Big Way yacht is capable of
achieving speeds of up to
two knots!"
Basically, what these two
sophomore students en
vision is Lake Lagunita filled
with these boats, dodging in
and out of windsurfers and

sailors, plenty of burgers-a
frying and beer in tow. Ul
timately they expect two
hundred members, and
maybe even more. As Levy
said solemnly, "This could
conceivably become an H-
Bomb."
"Providing the boats is
just a service," said Levy.
"Basically the social life is
what we're aiming for."
"We've got to get some
social life back to this cam
pus," agreed Mariscal. And
thus for an additional $5,
students can be a part of the
Big Way Yacht Club social
scene. Having a boat, how
ever, is not a requirement
for becoming a social-goer.
"You can take a boat, an in
nertube, swim, no matter
how you get on the lake,
you can party," Levy said.
Partying is no doubt a
priority of the skippers of
this club. They promise
some of the greatest "Fan
dangos" ever to be at
tended, including some
drink-a-boat parties and a

spring formal. According to
Levy, who rattled off quotes
between gulps of beer while
he and Mariscal en
thusiastically drew new
members to their "stand" in
White Plaza, "the Yacht
Club formal at the end of
the year is going to make the
Viennese Bali look like
square dancing at Kresge."
Despite the enthusiasm
and occasional wackiness of
these two entrepreneurs,
Mariscal and Levy seem to
be committed to making the
venture a success. Their
club is registered with the
Organization of Student Ac
tivities (OSA), they have a
dealer who is supplying
them with boats and they
are already making social
and entertainment plans.
The only potential prob
lem seems to be finances.
The two are putting up a bit
of their own capital. "I just
hope we don't lose money,"
confided Levy.
The Big Way Yacht Club is
a non-profit organization,

said Mariscal, who repre
sents the business side of
the group. He said Big Way
is selling the bo>its for a $2-
$3 profit, which will go to
cover advertising, postage,
transportation and other ex
penses.
The students first came up
with the idea for the club af
ter having spent last spring
quarter lounging in their
own "yachts."
"We just love spring quar
ter and want everyone else
to love it too," said Mariscal.
"We had so much fun doing
it last year, we decided to go
for it on a big scale."
The official name is regis
tered as the Stanford Yacht
Club, but this title wasaban
doned because of complica
tions with the sailing club,
Mariscal said. Thus the
name The Big Way Yacht
Club was adopted, a name
whose origins lie in The Big
Way Catering Ser\ ice, an or
ganization that Levy and
Mariscal ran last year in Flo
Mo.

"Everything we do is in a
big way. Some people do
things in a small way, some
people do things outlan
dishly. We do things in a big
way."
As potential members ap
proached the Club's table,
Mariscal and Levy bragged
about the Big Way yachts.

"This is a self-sufficient
unit," Levy said. "You don't
h.we to paint it, wash it, or
worry about its engine, and
you can fold it up and put it
in your back pocket."
Mariscal added that "if
you try to c hristen your boat
and the bottle breaks and
pops the yacht, it's okay be

cause it comes with its own
fix-it kit."
The Commander and Ad
miral warned students not
to "get dry docked" and to
take advantage of the many
uses for the yachts. As they
said,"You can tan in your
yacht, you can study in your
yacht, or you can party in
your yacht."
