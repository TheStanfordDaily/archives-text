# Gender differences no implication of superiority
## 
### Katrina Visser 
Gender specific traits do not imply superiority of
one sex over another, explained Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadourian at a lecture
given Wednesday afternoon in Terman Auditorium.
The lecture, entitled, "Puberty and Gender Identi
ty," traced the biological development of women and
the evolution of gender identity. It was the fourth of a
series of lectures sponsored by the Center for Re
search On Women (CROW).
"Puberty," said Katchadourian, "is an excellent ex
ample of a stage of life for three reasons. It is univer
sal, has a definite biological component, and various
psychosocial ramifications. It is the time when the im
portant differences between males and females ap
pear, differences that have been developing through
out childhood but only now become manifest."
During puberty the rate of change in the develop
ing bodies of boys and girls suddenly accelerates, es
pecially with respect to height, proportions and gen
ital development. The four primary measures of
maturation in young women are breast development,
pubic hair growth, a height spurt, and the onset of
menstruation. These measures change most dramati
cally around the ages of eleven and twelve, although
Katchadourian asserted that "chronological age is a
poor measure" for evaluating maturation. In demon
stration he showed a picture of three twelve-year-old
girls ofsubstantially different physical stature and de
velopment.
Pre-pubescent boys and girls, said Katchadourian,
are similar. With the onset of puberty, however, boys
develop great capacities for strength and energy
bursts, measured by the ten-fold increase in muscle

cells experienced by girls and the fourteen-fold in
crease in boys. Also differences in red blood cell
levels and other chemical changes allow boys to de
velop faster and farther than girls.
"These physical differences have led people to be
lieve that men are superior to women," said
katchadourian. "This conclusion is not warranted."
Using the fact that women outlive men in every
generation, he stressed, "the importance of speci
fying superiority with regard to what."
Katchadourian then explained "the mechanism
underlying all this: the events of puberty." The proc
esses begin in the brain, particularly in the
hypothalamus and pituitary glands, the "masters of
hormonal cycles." The hormones produced by the
gonads located in the reproductive system produce
the estrogens, progestins and androgens responsible
for the biological maturation of adolescents. The rea
son for the initial triggering of these processes,
Katchadourian admits, is unknown.
Katchadourian said another not completely under
stood phenomenon is menstruation, particularly with
respect to the mood changes often experienced by
women before and during the menstrual cycle. The
up and down nature of women's reproductive cycles
is determined by fluctuations in progesterone levels,
contrasting the steady-state hormone production in
males, he said.
Katchadourian also turned to art and advertising to
illustrate the public concepts of gender identity, par
ticularly in relation to power and role struggles. Even
though the nineteenth century emphasis on "nubile
women" — soft and seductive — has been replaced
by a more exuberant, "California girl" image, the is

sue of seduction and sexual attraction remains,
Katchadourian said.
Addressing the question of "the proper picture of
femininity," Katchadourian flashed two photographs
of women, a model and an astronaut, asking his au
dience to decide.
Role learning has much to do with gender identity,
Katchadourian said. Indeed, "the tremendous over
lay of socialization makes it impossible to pinpoint
differences as strictly biological," he stated.
Adolescent females observe that masculinity and
power seem to go together. How can they be taught
to understand that "we must not associate the signs of
masculinity with the symbols of power," asked
Katchadourian. Women should not strive to imitate
men, he said as he flashed pictures of women body
builders who had achieved strikingly muscular phy
siques, "because the fundamental biological dif
ferences cannot be overridden . . . differences are
often the doings of custom rather than biology, but
the biology is there, and imitation will only cause
women to be relegated to a lesser status."
The underlying assumption of most societies, "that
maleness represents power and phallic symbols rep- (
resent maleness" is a trap for both men and women,
he said.
The way out of this dilemma, Katchadourian said,
"is to help our teenaged daughters to distinguish be
tween the substance of power and the signs and sym
bols traditionally accompanying power, allowing
women to share in "legitimate opportunities for run-.
ning society."

Katchadourian asserted that "chronological age is a
poor measure" for evaluating maturation. In demon
stration he showed a picture of three twelve-year-old
girls ofsubstantially different physical stature and de
velopment.
Pre-pubescent boys and girls, said Katchadourian,
are similar. With the onset of puberty, however, boys
develop great capacities for strength and energy
bursts, measured by the ten-fold increase in muscle

cells experienced by girls and the fourteen-fold in
crease in boys. Also differences in red blood cell
levels and other chemical changes allow boys to de
velop faster and farther than girls.
"These physical differences have led people to be
lieve that men are superior to women," said
katchadourian. "This conclusion is not warranted."
Using the fact that women outlive men in every
generation, he stressed, "the importance of speci
fying superiority with regard to what."
Katchadourian then explained "the mechanism
underlying all this: the events of puberty." The proc
esses begin in the brain, particularly in the
hypothalamus and pituitary glands, the "masters of
hormonal cycles." The hormones produced by the
gonads located in the reproductive system produce
the estrogens, progestins and androgens responsible
for the biological maturation of adolescents. The rea
son for the initial triggering of these processes,
Katchadourian admits, is unknown.
Katchadourian said another not completely under
stood phenomenon is menstruation, particularly with
respect to the mood changes often experienced by
women before and during the menstrual cycle. The
up and down nature of women's reproductive cycles
is determined by fluctuations in progesterone levels,
contrasting the steady-state hormone production in
males, he said.
Katchadourian also turned to art and advertising to
illustrate the public concepts of gender identity, par
ticularly in relation to power and role struggles. Even
though the nineteenth century emphasis on "nubile
women" — soft and seductive — has been replaced
by a more exuberant, "California girl" image, the is

sue of seduction and sexual attraction remains,
Katchadourian said.
Addressing the question of "the proper picture of
femininity," Katchadourian flashed two photographs
of women, a model and an astronaut, asking his au
dience to decide.
Role learning has much to do with gender identity,
Katchadourian said. Indeed, "the tremendous over
lay of socialization makes it impossible to pinpoint
differences as strictly biological," he stated.
Adolescent females observe that masculinity and
power seem to go together. How can they be taught
to understand that "we must not associate the signs of
masculinity with the symbols of power," asked
Katchadourian. Women should not strive to imitate
men, he said as he flashed pictures of women body
builders who had achieved strikingly muscular phy
siques, "because the fundamental biological dif
ferences cannot be overridden . . . differences are
often the doings of custom rather than biology, but
the biology is there, and imitation will only cause
women to be relegated to a lesser status."
The underlying assumption of most societies, "that
maleness represents power and phallic symbols rep- (
resent maleness" is a trap for both men and women,
he said.
The way out of this dilemma, Katchadourian said,
"is to help our teenaged daughters to distinguish be
tween the substance of power and the signs and sym
bols traditionally accompanying power, allowing
women to share in "legitimate opportunities for run-.
ning society."

Gender specific traits do not imply superiority of
one sex over another, explained Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadourian at a lecture
given Wednesday afternoon in Terman Auditorium.
The lecture, entitled, "Puberty and Gender Identi
ty," traced the biological development of women and
the evolution of gender identity. It was the fourth of a
series of lectures sponsored by the Center for Re
search On Women (CROW).
"Puberty," said Katchadourian, "is an excellent ex
ample of a stage of life for three reasons. It is univer
sal, has a definite biological component, and various
psychosocial ramifications. It is the time when the im
portant differences between males and females ap
pear, differences that have been developing through
out childhood but only now become manifest."
During puberty the rate of change in the develop
ing bodies of boys and girls suddenly accelerates, es
pecially with respect to height, proportions and gen
ital development. The four primary measures of
maturation in young women are breast development,
pubic hair growth, a height spurt, and the onset of
menstruation. These measures change most dramati
cally around the ages of eleven and twelve, although
Katchadourian asserted that "chronological age is a
poor measure" for evaluating maturation. In demon
stration he showed a picture of three twelve-year-old
girls ofsubstantially different physical stature and de
