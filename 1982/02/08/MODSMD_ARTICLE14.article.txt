## Editorial Bridging the financial gap 
### 
Washington's tightening purse strings
threaten toeliminate much needed federal
educational funds. Asshortsightedand
indicative of misplaced priorities as the federal
policies are, students nevertheless must live
with the budget cuts. As tuition, room and
board costs rise, Stanford students who relied
on these funds to make ends meet will face yet
another financial strain. With these government
aid reductions and higher fees, students now
more than ever depend upon the University's
commitment to meet the financial needsof all
admitted students.
While most schools favor those applicants
who can pay full tuition fees, we applaud
Stanford's continued support of those who
can't. University President Donald Kennedy still
backs this "aid-blind" admissions policy of
admitting students regardless of their economic
circumstances, and we wholeheartedly
suppport him.
The University has a strong financial aid
program which should not be jeopardized by
budget constraints. Financialaid packagesare
designed to meet the individual's demonstrated
need — which is the total expenses less the
parents' contribution. Seventy-five percent of
this demonstrated need is met with University
scholarships and outside grants. The remaining
25 percent, called "self-help", must be paid by
thestudent.
Self help monies come from part-time work

wages and from low-interest loans. Because
these Federally Insured Student Loans (FISLs)
and Guaranteed Student Loans (GSLs) are now
more difficult toobtain, the University should
make every effort to replace these lost federal
funds. In order to prevent students from having
to work many hours to earn wages while
enrolled full-time or from having to stop out
altogether, the University must provide as much
access to loan capital as possible.
The 31 percent increase in 1982-83 funding for
undergraduate financial aid does indeed
demonstrate a willingness to bridge the aid gap
created by federal and state cuts, and we hope
this commitment continues.
Another example of this dedication to meet
students' financial needs is the University's
Parent Loan Program, which attempts to relieve
some of the pressure that the proposed $8220
tuition charge would place on all families,
especially those middle-income families who
are now ineligible for federal aid.
We hope applicants for admissions to Stanford
continue to be highly qualified and to represent
different backgrounds. Toattractadiverseand
able body of students, the University must
continue itsadherence tothe"aid-blind"
admissions policy. As tuition charges increase, a
complete assurance that anyone admitted will
beable toafford the University's fullexpenses is
the only promise that will not limit applications
to those of the very rich.
