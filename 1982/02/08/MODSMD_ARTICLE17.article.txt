## Leaking from the Big House 
### 
Dateline Friday, 9 a.m. Things were
pretty slow. I hadn't seen any action
since I cracked the Al Haig guerilla
case and sent Ricky "Fingers" Allen
up the river. I sat in my office and
polished my 45 as I thought about
going back to Chicago.
Just then I got a buzz from Trixie.
She said a Mr. Meese wanted to see
me. I said send him in. I had heard
about this Meese guy — a real big
wheel. I knew it would take some
thing pretty big to bring him to my of
fice. I wasn't disappointed.
Meese said that he thought I prob
ably knew what he was after and I
said sure I knew but maybe he could
fill in some details. FHe said he had a
squealer hurting his operation and
could I spring his cover. I said sure I
could but I wanted cash up front — I
knew the shape his operation was in
and I wasn't about to take a check. He
said fine, just so long as we under
stood each other.
I hit the streets as soon as Meese
left my office. I covered the whole
town for three days, checking up on
my contacts on the hill, using my cov
er as a reporter and tailing everybody
and his brother. Little by little I got
the feeling that this case was big —
really big. It seems it all started when
someone leaked that the Libyan
crowd had sent some hit men to the
U.S. to fill out some pretty big con
tracts. Then someone leaked on how
the Big Man slipped up on calling for
tax exempt status for racially dis
criminatory schools. Then there was
the leak about the Big Man's private
estimate of $150 billion deficits in
1983 and 1984. Finally, there was the

big leak — the source let on that
there was going to be a $750 billion
overrun in defense expenditures
over the next five years. I was begin
ning to get the feeling that the
squealer was high up in the organiza
tion — really high up. I could see why
Meese was worried.
Just as I thought I was getting
somewhere, I ran into a blank wall.
Nobody on the hill would talk to me.
It seems that Meese had tried to stop
the leaks by making everybody clear
their statements through the Big
House. He even tried to find the
squealer with a polygraph test. All my
best sources clammed up and I
couldn't get anywhere.

Meese said he
thought I probably
knew what he was
after and I said sure.
He said he had a
squealer hurting his
operation and could I
spring his cover.

I did what I always do when I draw
a zero: went to Joey's and had a gin
and tonic and a cigar as I thought
about the case. I asked myself: "Who
had access to all the information and
to the media?" Obviously, it had to
be someone who was key to the or
ganization, someone who knew
enough to be able to cover his tracks,
someone who . .. just then, I looked
up at Joey's TV. The Big Man himself

was giving a speech, talking about
some "New Federalism" deal that
was going down and giving detailed
information about the entire plan.
Right then, it hit me. I knew I had
cracked the case wide open. There
was only one man who fit the facts.
I caught the first cab to the Big
House. When the Big Man came off
stage, I was ready for him. I had my
revolver in my pocket and my hand
on the trigger. I told him that there
were just two things I wanted to
know: who put him up to it and why.
He made like he didn't know what I
was talking about but I was onto his
game — I had seen his press con
ferences before. I put some more
pressure on him and started to
ramble incoherently making up facts
and figures, but I was onto that game
too. I could feel that he was just
about to come clean when Meese
came in.
Meese said that I had done my job
well; maybe even too well. I had al
ready figured as much — it wasn'tthe
first time that someone had hired me
to find out something that they really
didn't want me to know. Meese said
that I already knew all that I needed
to know about his operation and that
maybe I would find the weather in
Chicago was better for my health. I
said I had heard that it was freezing
cold in Chicago but that I could see
his point. He said fine, just so long as
we understood each other.
Dateline Thursday. Doll-face and I
are back in the windy city. It is freez
ing here, but I've had enough of D.C.
