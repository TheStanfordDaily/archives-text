## When obedience to law becomes a violation of conscience 
### 
Kurt Elieson's argument in favor of
registration for the draft (Daily,) Feb.
3), is not only incorrect in its assump
tions regarding the function of gov
ernment, but is dangerous in its im
plication thafcwe must obey laws that
are in conflict with our individual
consciences.
He suggests that our government

has the authority "to call for the
young men of this country to kill and
risk being killed" in a war that mayor
may not be justified in their
judgment. He claims that the country
was founded upon the idea that cer
tain privileges are worth dying and
killing for.
Neither of these claims will bear

examination. This country was
founded on the principle that gov
ernments are formed in order to "se
cure" the individual rights of
citizens, among them, the rights of
life and liberty. The draft is a clear
contradiction of this obligation of
government to secure the rights of
the citizens; it is "involuntary
servitude" forced upon innocent
citizens. While many of the founding
fathers felt that their ideal were
worth dying for, they stated their be
lief as a personal choice, "... as for
me, give me liberty or give me
death." The personal choice of the
individual to support a war by volun
teering is not in question here —
rather the question is "does govern
ment have the right to deny some of

the people their liberty in order to
wage wars?" The Declaration of In
dependence and U.S. Constitution
would seem to say no, although the
courts have not seen it that way.
Elieson also claims that we are
obliged to obey the laws made by our
duly elected officials, whether we
like them or not. He states that "If we
are allowed to pick and choose the
laws that we obey, then (sic) we may
as well not have laws." However, the
draft is in violation of my conscience.
I cannot be a part of forcing people
to kill and die to protect me, or to
fight a war I do not believe in. If I
were a young man, I would feel that
my compliance with this law would
be perpetuating the violation of my
rights to life and liberty and would be

cooperating with the violation of the
rights of others.
As for obedience, per se, to laws
made by duly elected officials, the
U.S. made its stand on this issue clear
in the trials of war criminals after
W.W.11. Hitler and his party were
duly elected. They represented the
legitimate government of Germany.
They carried out programs, using the
law and threat of punishment, exact
ly as they outlined their plans in the
literature they distributed before
they were elected. Should the peo
ple of Germany have disobeyed the
laws that violated their individual
consciences? We answered that
question at the trials with a resound
ing "yes." How far could Hitler's gov
ernment have gotten without "blind

obedience?" — not far. How close
can our government get to pure
facism? — very close if we let it.
To obey laws which do not violate
our individual conscience is in our
own, enlightened self interest. Order
is desirable where that order is just.
However, where a law does violate
one's own conscience, one not only
has the moral right to disobey it, he
has the obligation to disobey it. Only
by disobedience can the law be re
peatedly tested in the courts so that it
is seen to be unjust.
No election, however democratic,
turns over the life, liberty and cons
cience of the individual to the own
ership and authority of government.
