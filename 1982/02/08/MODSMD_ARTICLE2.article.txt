# ASSU reports $90,000 in fee assessment refunds claimed
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
According to statistics compiled by
the ASSU Business Office, the ASSU
refunded more than $90,000 in fee
assessment funds to students last
month. As a result, 18 of the 20
groups receiving winter quarter fee
assessments will suffer an average
loss of 42.2 percent of their potential
assessment for this quarter.
Only the ASSU Legal Counseling
Service, with a 16.1 percent cut, and
the Daily, with a 28.2 percent de
crease in assessment revenue, es
caped with their budgets relatively
intact.
Until this quarter, the ASSU had
never supported as many as 20
groups. Usually the number of

groups funded by fee assessments
falls around 14 or 15, according to
Cynthia Mathewson, financial man
ager of the ASSU. Mathewson at
tributed the large refund to the size
of the assessment and the amount of
publicity the refunds received.
"It's unfortunate that people
thought the $20 was more important
than the activities the 20 groups put
on," said Eric Berg, treasurer of the
Graduate Students' Association
(GSA), which lost almost $4500.
The Campus Entertainment Board,
an organization which plans all-cam
pus social events, felt the pinch of the
assessment cut most acutely. The CEB
lost $5064, or 45.2 percent of its
assessment.
According to Todd Ackerman, di

rector of the CEB, this is particularly
crippling because the CEB was just
formed this quarter and much of the
organization's effort will have to be
focused on fund-raising rather than
on establishing an active program.
"Hopefully the fund-raising will
equalize the loss," Ackerman said.
"But realistically it will hurt us. Five
thousand dollars is a lot to lose."
Leaders of many the groups agree
that the loss of funds "will hurt," but
they are unsure of where the pain
will come. Of course, the adminis
trators say, services will be cut back.
While she cautions that she's "not
yet sure" of the effects of the fund
loss, Glynn O'Donnell, director of
the ASSU Speaker's Bureau, said she
anticipates a deficit of $2000 or $3000

in the spring quarter because the
program's Winter Writer's Series
contracts are binding and cannot be
canceled. -\s a result the Speaker's
Bureau will have to curtail its sched
ule in the spring.
"It's really disappointing,"
O'Donnell said. "I don't think peo
ple realize that when they take mon
ey from the Speaker's Bureau, they
t.ike money from all the groups on
campus we give money to."
I he bureau uses about 1 i of its rev
enue to help smaller organizations
schedule speakers, according to
O'Donnell. The Academic Organiza
tions Board (AOB) and the Program
Fee also serve a similiar "umbrella"
function, together allocating funds
to over 70 smaller groups. Both the

AOB and the Program Fee lost over
$5000.
Diana Compton, a live-in counsel
or at the Bridge, said a lower budget
will force the organization to lower
its expectations, especially with re
gard to the Spring Crafts Fair which
the Bridge sponsors. Compton also
said plans to refurbish the facility will
have to be revised.
"I don't think that the refund re
flects a lack of support in the com
munity," Compton said. "It's just
profitable now to take back the mon
ey." Compton added that the large
refund may be a reflection of stu
dents' dissatisfaction with the system.
The ASSU Senate has scheduled an
open meeting for Wednesday to dis
cuss possible changes in the present

foe assessment system. Last week the
Rules Committee also held a meeting
to hear student proposals for altering
the system.
"There does need to be a change,"
said Dave Phelps, ASSU Senate chair.
In the past, Phelps said, the possi
bilities of altering the assessment
election system or imposing a fixed,
mandatory fee assessment have been
discussed. The changes, if approved
bv the student body, would be im
plemented by next fall at the earliest,
according to Phelps.
Berg described Stanford's fee
assessment system as "very unusual
. . . Everv other university I've known
about has mandatory student body
fees. I don't think that most people
realize that."
