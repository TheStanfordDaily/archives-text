## Guest Professorship Board makes unsatisfactory choice 
### 
This week the ASSU Senate al
located $6000 as honoraria for pro
fessor Catherine MacKinnon and
cartoonist Bill Griffith. In doing so,
our student leaders have ignored the
needs of the Stanford community
and the dictates of common sense.
MacKinnon has been at the Stan
ford Law School since Autumn Quar
ter, yet $5000 has been set aside to
keep her here this Spring. The
purpose of Guest Professorship
Board funds is to attract to the Stan
ford campus individuals with view
points which we would otherwise
not have the opportunity to hear.
MacKinnon is doubtlessly well-quali
fied to teach a course on
"feminism/socialism," and many stu
dents have already benefitted from
her background and experience.
This does not change the fact that
educational purposes would be bet
ter served by bringing to Stanford an
other individual's perspective — of
feminism or whatever.
The payment of $1000 for two days
of Bill Griffith's time is absurd. There
is no justification for paying an ob
scure cartoonist nearly five times the

per diem salary of a Stanford pro
fessor. What does Mr. Griffith expect
to say? To whom will he say it? Why
can't he say it in an afternoon?
If these are the best uses to which
the ASSU Senate can put our funds,
perhaps the money should be re
turned to the students or kept in the
bank for next year, when possibly
more suitable options are available.
The ASSU should cease wondering
why students wait upwards of an
hour in line to retrieve their fee
assessments. The thinking student
simply refuses to subsidize this type
of waste.

STARTS is an aid, not
an agent, for performers
As a STARTS member, I take great
exception to Bob Buika's letter con
cerning STARTS' decision to not en
gage "Whipping Boy" to perform at
Tresidder Union. He is misinformed
and, I suspect, wishes to remain so,
because it is to his advantage — it
permits him to level a sharper
criticism, while ignoring some very
pertinent points.
His conception of the purpose of
not only STARTS but of any student
organization is deliberately dis
torted. STARTS does not take a list of
student performers and find places
for them to perform. We select.
Many factors enter into our decision
to engage performers, among them:
quality, appeal, cost and overall pro
gramming goals.
It is the opinion of STARTS mem
bers that "Whipping Boy" is not of
high quality and that the group has
limited appeal. These, however, are

not sufficient reasons for rejecting a
request. In the past, STARTS has
often engaged those who lack both
quality and appeal, because it is of
STARTS' policy to encourage and
give needed experience to these stu
dents. STARTS does support such stu
dents and Bob Buika the filmmaker
knows it. But cost and overall pro
gramming goals are also considered
and, since the group lacks both quali
ty and general appeal, we are not
willing to risk engaging a group with
their reputation, especially since sim
ilar groups have already been en
gaged.
Finally, there is a modicum of
courtesy, respect and professional
behavior necessary for the running
of any organization like STARTS.
"Whipping Boy" fell short on all
three counts.
Bob Buika has taken a petty gripe
and expanded it into an unfair and
shakey condemnation of a hard
working student organization.
