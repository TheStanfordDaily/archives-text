## Stanford wins three 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford's fourth-ranked
baseball team faced a difficult
task this weekend but came
through to win three of four
games including two of three
games against No. 1 ranked
Cal State- Fullerton.
After losing to the Titans 10-3
in the first game of a double
header, the Cardinal overcame
its mistakes and went on to win
the second game 5-4.
On Friday afternoon the
Cardinal won the first game of
the series 2-0.
Stanford scored both of its
runs in the eighth inning.
The first run came when
pinch hitter Eric Hardgrave
belted the ball over the left
field fence. The Cardinal
scored again in the same inning
when left fielder Mike Dot

terer scored on a squeeze bunt
bv second baseman Steve Bue
chelle.
Brian Mignano was the win
ning pitcher on Friday, upping
his record to 2-0.
The first game of Saturday's
double-header was a disaster
for the Cardinal. Nothing went
right as Stanford lost 10-3 in a
game where Fullerton had 14
hits compared to three for the
Cardinal.
Pitcher Brian Meyers started
for Stanford but left the game
in the second inning after giv
ing up three runs.
Reliever Greg Lomnicky
came in but was no more effec
tive as the Titans scored three
times in the second inning to
take a 6-0 lead.
Fullerton went on to win the
game 10-3 but for both sides
the game was sloppy. In fact,
the Titans walked eight men
and hit one, yet the Cardinal
was unable to take advantage
of it.
In the second game of the
twin bill, Stanford played like a
different team.
After falling behing 1-0 in the
top of the first inning, the
Cardinal came right back to
even it up in the bottom of the
inning when infielder Loring
Davies homered over the left
center field fence.
Stanford went on to win the
game 5-4 when the game was
called due to darkness after
five innings.
Yesterday, the Cardinal
boosted its record to 7-1 after
defeating UC Davis 8-0.
