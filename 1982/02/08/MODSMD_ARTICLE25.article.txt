# Bruins whip Cardinal men

### 
The Stanford men's swim
ming team lost to No. 1 UCLA
67-46 Friday, but gained a
measure of revenge Saturday
with a 68-45 victory over USC.
Stanford's Bari Weick con
tinued his domination of the
distance events with a double
in the 500 and 1000 yard free
styles. Wade Flemons returned
from sickness to score an im
pressive victory in the 100-yard
backstroke.
Stanford held off USC and
handed them only their second
home loss in 25 years.
