Broken records and strong per
formances by all team members character
ized the women's gymnastic team's win
over USC and Oregon Saturday.
USC, ranked No. 10 in the nation despite
a 0-2 dual meet record, was at full strength
with the return of previously-injured Don
na Turnbow and Suzy Kellums. Stanford,
ranked No. 18 in the nation, scored 142.45
to USC's 137.95 and Oregon's 135.40.
Coach Jackie Walker was pleased with
the score.
"We are consistently scoring an average
of 141 to 142 points and that's what we
need to go to nationals," Walker said.
Sophomore Merilyn Chapman cracked
her own team record on the uneven par

allel bars with a 9.55. Chapman, who has
not lost in the all-around this season, went
on to win the floor exercise and the all
around.
Junior Kim Strauss had a personal best of
9.30 on the beam, junior Julie Bledsoe
scored her highest score of the season on
the bars with a 9.15 and senior Anne Smith
scored her highest mark of the season on
the bars with an 8.95.
"Anne did a sensational job vaulting
while she turned the tables for us on the
beam," assistant coach Homer Sardina
said, "Julie did a great job of pulling out
her routine on the bars. It was just spec
tacular."
Kellums's performance was marred by
falls from the bars and beam.

The men's team beat Cal State Long
Beach, but lost to Fulle r ton Friday night.
"We did our season best scoring 265.7
points," coach Sadao Hamada stated.
Hamada was pleased with the team's
performance. Stanford had 10 nine-plus,
marks — five more than last week. The
men's routines were also more accurate
and Hamada said they had only 12 major
mistakes compared to 16 last week at Cali
fornia.
Highlights of the meet included Mike
Lee's 54.70 in the all-around, Chris Smith's
9.55 in the vault. Freshman Ed Gresser
scored a 9.25 on the floor exercise and a
9.50 in the vault. Stanford turned in a sea
son high on both the rings and the vault
with scores of 45.5 and 48.2, respectively.
