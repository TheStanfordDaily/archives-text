# Longhorns win battle of No. 1

### Mark Zeigler 
It was a typically atypical
Stanford-Texas womens' swim
meet.
As has been the case in three
of the schools' last four meet
ings, the contest was decided
by the final event the 400
yard freestyle relay.
Before the meet, both
coaches agreed that if it should
come down to the relay, Texas
would have a definite advan
tage.
And, unfortunately for the
Cardinal, their assumptions
were correct. The Longhorns
won the final event and the
meet, 63-51.

"You won't see a better dual
meet anywhere. The meet was
lost by inches,"coach George
Haines said.
The first race, the 400 yard
medley relay, set the tone for
the nip-and-tuck meet, with
Texas winning the event by a
mere 38 hundredths of a sec
ond.
The next race featured the
day's biggest match-up be
tween Longhorn Kim Lenihan
and Cardinal Marybeth
Linzmeier. The Texan out
touched Linzmeier in the 1000
freestyle, clocking a national
season best and pool record
9:35.05.
Lenihan powered for two
more firsts in the 500 free and
200 butterfly, with another sea
son best and de Guerre record
in the former (4:42.91).
Overall, Texas swimmers
took first in eight of the eleven
swimming events and Stanford
placed second nine times.
Cardinal Jean Meyer won the
one-meter diving competition
Perhaps the most impressive
Stanford performance was Jen
ny Rapp's 4:20.94 clocking in
the 400 individual medley, bet
ter ing herseason best by nearly
seven seconds. Rapp was in the
points in both events which the
Cardinal swept the first three
places. She took third in the 200
backstroke, an event won by
Kim Carlisle (2:04.54).
