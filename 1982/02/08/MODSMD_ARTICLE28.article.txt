# DiBiaso quits, but Stanford doesn't
## 
### Steve Odell 
It was quite a weekend in the
beautiful Pacific Northwest for
Stanford basketball coach Dick
Dißiaso.
It was a weekend which in
cluded his resignation after
<even years as the Cardinal
head coach.
It was a weekend in which he
celebrated his 41st birthday on
Saturday, and in which his 18-
year-old son Brian was ad
mitted to the University of Or
egon.
It was a weekend, finally, in
which his team produced an
exhilerating 79-76 overtime
victory over Oregon Friday
night to snap a seven-game los
ing streak, only to get an
nihilated by No. 7 Oregon
State 111-81 the next night.
OSU, who former coach and
television commentator Al
McGuire said Saturday, "Might
be the quickest team in Ameri
ca," made believers of Stan

ford, streaking out to a 27-12
lead with 10 straight points and
never breaking stride.
The 111 points was the third
most ever scored against a
Stanford team.
A month ago at Maples Pavil
ion, OSU won by 43 points.
"I didn't think then that they
were better than last year," said
Dißiaso, "but I do now. If you
look at their stats, you'll see it."
The beavers, now 16-3 over
all and 9-1 in the Pacific-10, did
rack up impressive numbers.
OSU shot 61 percent from the
floor and passed for assists on
27 of their 46 field goals.
Oregon State employed a
full-court press the entire
game and forced 20 Stanford
turnovers while committing
only six themselves.
Oregon State guard Lester
Conner, who was reportedly ill
earlier in the week, dominated
the Stanford guards on both
ends of the floor. Conner, who

ranks third in the nation in
steals, had three against Stan
ford along with 10 assists and 13
points.
The starting OSU front line
— Danny Evans, A.C. Green
and Charlie Sitton — poured in
18 points apiece.
It was a game for the first four
minutes when Stanford trailed
only 11-10, behind Brian
Welch's long-range jumpers.
Welch finished with 17 points
to lead the Cardinal in scoring
and picked up 10 of Stanford's
first 14 point to keep them
close.
Friday night's game with Or
egon could best be described
as "matched-mediocrity."
Neither Oregon — who has
now lost five in a row after a
70-60 loss to California Satur
day — nor Stanford, who won
for only the second time in
conference play — played ex
ceptionally well.
But in the end, it was the fact

that Stanford refused to quit on
the day their coach did that
made the difference.
With six seconds left,
Cardinal Guard Doug Marty
drove the right side of the key
past Oregon's Gary Gatewood,
forcing the Ducks John Greig
to pick him up. Marty then
dished the ball to John Revelli,
who had been left open under
neath, and the 6-8 sophomore
was fouled by UO's Fred
Cofield. Revelli hit the first of
two free-throw attempts with
four seconds on the clock for
the winning point.
"Given the circumstances, it
was a very good team effort,"
Dißiaso said. "We sustained
our intensity for the entire 40
minutes tonight. It was an ex
cellent ball game."
Stanford, now 7-13 overall
and 2-9 in the Pac-10, has
beaten Oregon five straight
games and both of the
Cardinals conference wins are

over the Ducks.
Stanford was forced to fight
back all evening, eliminating
Oregon leads of six in the first
half and eight in the second
half, as well as coming back af
ter a four-point Duck burst at
the beginning of the overtime.
Stanford had two shots at
winning the game without ov
ertime. With three seconds re
maining in regulation and the
score tied 68-68, Roger Lemons
missed a jumper from the top
of the key and johnny Rogers's
tip of Lemon's miss just went
awry.
Revelli was the high man
against Oregon , compiling 23
points and nine rebounds in
cluding an 11 for 15 per
formance from the foul line.
Welch, who was hitting from
the third balcony in Mac Arthur
Court, picked up 19 points to
bypass Hank Luisetti on Stan
ford's all-time scoring list.
