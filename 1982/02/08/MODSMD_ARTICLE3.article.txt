# High gift totals posted despite key VP's leave
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Despite the five-month absence of
its top administrative officer, the Of
fice of Development continues to
post high fund-raising figures with
this month's $9.3 million in gifts rep
resenting one of the highest sums
ever received by the University for
the month of January.
Vice President for Development
Joel Smith has been on temporary
leave since early last September. Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
explained that Smith's absence is due
to diagnosed "clinical depression."
However, Kennedy told the Daily he
intends to stand by Smith — who is a
close friend of the president — and
has no plans to appoint an acting vice
president. Kennedy cited the high
performance of the office as an in
dication that Smith's absence is not
significantly hurting the University.
When Smith will return to his post
remains unknown. He has been hos
pitalized but is currently recuperat
ing in his campus home.
Should Smith's absence continue,
a review and assessment of the de
velopmentoffice's operation as well
as possible restructuring moves will
be considered, according to Ken
nedy.
"We have every reason to believe
that as soon as he comes out of this he
will be back" at full capacity, Ken
nedy said.
Traditionally, January is a very slow
time for fund-raising, mainly because
tax season is over and contributions
are generally highest toward the end
of the year. Autumn is usually the
best fund-raising season, with De
cember generally recording the
highest totals. However, some Uni
versity officials warned against judg
ing overall fund-raising performance
by onemonth assessments, because
gifts received in any given month
might be the result of years of plan
ning and negotiating. Often shifting
scales based on five-year or longer
ranges are used, said University
spokesman Bob Beyers.
David Fulton, director of com
munications and deputy to the vice
president for development, said that
most of the gifts received in these
past months were already negotiated
and worked on by Smith and the
managerial team which runs that of
fice, long before they were received.
Several sources cited the depth of
that department as a key factor in its
smooth operation even without an
acting head.
Smith's duties have so far been
divided between Fulton, Bruce
Hinchliffe, director of corporate rela
tions, other departmental directors

within the office and, to a large ex
tent, Kennedy himself — a fact which
the president said was probably ben
eficial to his own perspective on de
velopment.
Smith, 49, has been vice president
for development since 1977. He first
came to Stanford in 1965 and quickly
rose to the ranks of associate provost
and dean of students. In 1969 he left
to serve a seven-year stint as presi
dent of Denison University. Begin
ning in 1976, he returned to Stanford,
working as a special consultant to the
then-Vice President for Develop
ment Kenneth Cuthbertson. Smith
later attained that position upon
Cuthbertson's retirement.
This year there had been plans to
give Smith a dual role in Stanford's
administrative structure by increas
ing his interaction with the board of
trustees, for which he was to serve as
secretary. Instead, this plan has been
put on "dry dock" according to Ken
nedy, who said his own assistant for
trustee affairs, Robert Hamrdla, has
continued to serve as the adminis
trative liaison.
Kennedy defended his decision
not to appoint an interim or acting
vice president by saying that while no
administrators are indispensable,
"you simply don't take a senior of
ficer and get rid of him.
"Quite simply in our judgment and
in that of those who survey the field,
ours is the best development office
around and (Smith) is simply the best
development officer around," Ken
nedy said.
The current situation in no way
represents a crisis for the fund-rais
ing office, Kennedy added, because
it is "common for organizations to
deliberately place themselves in this
kind of situation. Universities regu
larly send people off on sabbaticals."
In fact, two high profile adminis
trators, Robert Rosenzweig, vice
president for public affairs, and
Herant Katchadourian, dean of un
dergraduates, just returned from
sabbaticals.
Kennedy said lie has received full
support from the board of trustees —
which has been regularly briefed on
Smith's progress — for his handling
of this matter. Board President Wil
liam Kimball told the Daily, "The
board has its functions and the presi
dent has his — this is one of his. We
don't fault Don or Al (Hastorf, vice
president and provost), for the way
they've handled this at all.
"We're feeling his (Smith's)
absence more and more and most of
all we're feeling frustrated about his
future," Kimball said.
The board president reiterated
Kennedy's position about Smith's
value to the University and added
that while both development office
personnel and Hamrdla are filling the
gap nicely, "If Joel were there we
might be doing a little more looking
ahead." Kimball noted that plans for
a centennial campaign and several
other long-range projects were
probably suffering some from the ad
ministrator's absence.

Fulton said in terms of fund-raising
this year is only slightly behind last
year's marks, a fact which Kennedy
said was understandable because last
year was an "exceptional year"
which he did not think would be du
plicated soon.
Last year's figures for the fiscal year
totalled $79.5 million in gifts and be
quests received — an all-time record.
The area which Kennedy, too, said
was most likely to suffer from Smith's
absence is long-range forecasts and
planning. Fulton agreed.
"(Smith) is an extraordinarily good

long-range planner. As a managerial
group we'll be dealing with long
range issues, but his example is one
of the main things we're missing,"
said Fulton.
However, Fulton maintained,
"We've got a group of division direc
tors who have been here for a min
imum of 10 years — when you've got
a group of people with that ex
perience, you've got something
quite exceptional."
Indeed, much of Smith's staff is
composed of people who worked
with Cuthbertson on the campaigns

which made Stanford a force to be
reckoned with in fund-raising circles
in the early '70s. Smith joined that of
fice's staff in 1976 as a part-time con
sultant.
In a memo to his staff in 1975,
Cuthbertson outlined particular
strengths of his new consultant, ex
plaining that he would work on com
prehensive analyses of gift procure
ment costs, organization for post
campaign periods of fund-raising,
comparative studies of other univer
sities, and optimum fund-raising ex
penditure patterns. It is these kinds

of studies which are currently paying
off, several sources noted.
Cuthbertson, who Smith himself
once told the Daily was "simply the
best fund-raiser he had ever met,"
said he was sure the office could
weatheroutSmith'sabsence because
Smith had assembled and trained
such a fine staff.
Smith, throughout his months
away, has been open about the situ
ation. Contacted at home recently,
he said Kennedy and other Stanford
officials had extended "tremendous
support" to him.

"I'm looking forward to coming
back as soon as I am able," he said.
"(Jut during this time it was important
to me to remove myself 100 percent
from the university. I still keep in
contact with friends and colleagues,
but our agenda of things to talk about
has not involved the office, so I can't
really say how things have been
going. I left the office in very, very
capable hands."
"Stanford is a caring place," Fulton
said, "we're looking forward to hav
ing Joel back. He is an inspirational
leader."
