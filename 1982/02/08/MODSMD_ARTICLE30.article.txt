On Saturday, the Stanford
Cardinal was routed by the San
Jose State Spartans 32-11 in a
fencing match that was not
much of a match.
In the first part of the com
petition, the men's sabre team
defeated San Jose State 5-4, giv
ing them enough overall points
to become the Northern Cali
fornia champs in men's sabre.
The highlight of men's sabre
was a 5-2 win by two-year let
ter ma n Jeff Gueble over three
time All-America Peter
Schifrin.
In women's foil, Pamela
Henck was unable to win a
bout, as the Cardinal women
were humiliated, 0-16.

The story was a little better in
men's epee but the result was
the same as Stanford lost 4-5.
Nikolas Blevins had a poor day,
finishing 1-2, while teammate
Matt Foley ended the match
with a 2-1 record.
Men's foil also lost Saturday
by a score of 2-7.
Stanford was not motivated
and in most of the bouts fell be
hind early.
"I expected a lot more out of
our gals," assistant coach Buzz
Hurst commented after the
loss.
The Cardinal gave a virtually
a repeat performance of the
33-10 embarrassment in San
Jose last November.
