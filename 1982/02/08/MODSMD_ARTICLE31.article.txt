Stanford's Women's basketball team tips offagainstCal
Berkeley tomorrow in Berkeley's Harmon gym. This is
the second meeting of the rivals after Stanford lost to the
Bears 80-69 on January 15. Yet the Cardinals have been ex
ceptional since then, winning three of their last four con
ference games.
Stanford has felt the loss of center Kim Kupferer, out for
the season due to a knee injury. However 6-1 forward Meg
Metzger is having no problem filling the center position.
She scored a team high 27 points in last week's win against
San Francisco State.
Forward Louis Smith has also been out of recent action
fighting a bout with mononucleosis.
The Bears are currently at the top of the conference, tied
with San Jose State, and boast a 5-0 record.
However, the Cardinal has posted a 14-6 overall record
and are 4-2 in league play.
Head coach Dotty McCrea has plenty of confidence
about the upcoming game. "Every individual is doing well,"
McCrea said. "I feel good about the game."
