PEBBLE BEACH (AP) — Jim Si
mons said he saw hope when
Craig Stadler made a double
bogie. He saw it through some
dark glasses, a couple—that's
right, two — of contact lenses
and, almost certainly indistinct
ly. He's legally blind without
his various corrective lenses
and the lenses were giving him
trouble in the last two rounds
of the Bing Crosby Pro-Am
Golf Tournament.
But Simon shrugged off the dis
comfort, donned some dark
glasses as protection against
the weak rays of the sun and,
with a brilliant final round 66,
overcame a five-shot deficit
and won.
"I'm just as happy as I can be.
My whole system is going 200
miles per hour and it will take
me at least two or three days to
calm down,"the 31-year-old Si
mons said after winning only
the third title of his 11-year ca

reer. He won it with a 274 total,
14 under par.
But it did not come easily. For
much of the cool, hazy after
noon it apeared it would not
come at all. Stadler seemed
poised for another runaway.
He went five shots ahead after
only seven holesof play and Si
mons, playing with him, was
trying to nail down second
place.
"It wasn't realistic to think of
winning and there is a lot of
money for second," Simon
said. Then Stadler put one over
a cliff on the ninth hole, made a
double bogey and Simons"saw
hope" through his burning
eyes.
"The golf course has a whole
lot of disaster holes out there.
It's a matter of avoiding them,"
Simon said.
He avoided them and Stadler
found them.
