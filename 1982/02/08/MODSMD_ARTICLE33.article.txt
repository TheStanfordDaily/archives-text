Several sources predicted Republicans would
spend the next several weeks debating whether to
simply abandon Reagan's blueprint and develop an
alternative of their own.
"I was just sort of in a state of shock as I listened" to
a briefing on the president's budget on Friday, said
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska, the deputy Republican
leader.
He said Reagan's deficit forecast of $91.5 billion as
sumed enactment of "a series of recommendations,
some of which didn't fly before and I'm not sure
they're going to fly this time."
"The deficits are enormous. And they're (the pre
dictions) probably too low," said one Republican
member of Congress, who asked not to be identified
by name.
House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois
conceded, "The president's budget will be difficult to
pass in its entirety." But he said Reagan is "on the right
course and the public is very much committed to that
course."
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kansas), the chairman of the Sen
ate Finance Committee, said, "The Republicans I talk
to ... are frightened about the deficits..."
Democrats agreed that Reagan underestimated the
deficits — $98.1 billion this year, declining only to
about $72 billiion in 1985 — and also condemned the
rest of the president's proposals as unrealistic.
Israel denounces U.N. vote
Jerusalem — Israel denounced the United Nations
yesterday as"a tool wielded by hostile states tospread
their enmity and hypocrisy, underlining the peace
of nations."
In a statement issued following the weekly Cabinet

meeting, Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment rejected as"null and void" the U.N. General As
sembly's 86-21 vote calling on all nations tosever dip
lomatic, military and economic ties with Jerusalem as
punishment for the annexation of the Golan Heights.
The Cabinet did not indicate how Israel would re
spond to any countries that comply with the General
Assembly resolution, which is only advisory to the
member nations.
But the government left little doubt that it would
continue to ignore U.N. pressure to rescind the par
liamentary action extending Israeli "law, jurisdiction
and administration" to the strategic highlands cap
tured from Syria in the Six Day War of 1967.
For the most part, the statement, drafted personally
by Begin, heaped abuse on the U.N. and its "auto
matic anti-Israel majority."
"Not the representatives of countries which for
more than 30 years have refused to make peace (with
Israel) or even to negotiate it, will be the ones to de
termine that Israel is not a 'peace-loving country.' Nor
is a superpower which invaded Afghanistan, and
which moved the Polish government to establish a re
gime of oppression and the liquidation of the most
fundamental human rights, going to preach to any
body about 'expansionist designs,' " the statement
said.
The opposition Labor Party joined the Cabinet in
denouncing the U.N. action, which it called
worthless.
Haig arrives in Madrid
Madrid — Secretary of State Alexander Haig arrived
here last night to join America's European allies in us
ing the Madrid conference on the Helsinki Accords as
a forum to focus world attention on the Polish crisis.

Haig and the foreign ministers of most other North
Atlantic Treaty Organization countries plan to use the
conference, which formally resumes tomorrow, to
launch a rhetorical attack against Polish military au
thorities and the Soviet Union for violating the human
rights provisions of the 1975 Helsinki agreement.
Following his speech here tomorrow, Haig will visit
Portugal and Morocco and then conclude his trip
with an overnight stop in Romania that also bears
directly on the tensions introduced into East-West re
lations by the military crackdown in Poland.
A senior U.S. official accompanying Haig said the
visit to Romania was "the consequence of a continu
ing, persistent and very current request" from Presi
dent Nicolae Ceausecu, who has been one of the
most politically independent leaders in the Soviet
dominated Warsaw Pact alliance.
Haig's visit, the official said, will dramatize the con
tinuing U.S. determination to differentiate between
Moscow and such East European countries as Roma
nia, which has maintained relatively warm relations
with the West.
Britons hope to save Laker
London — Britons pledged over $500,000 Saturday
in a touching expression of hope that cheap-fare
pioneer Sir Freddie Laker would somehow get his fi
nancially wrecked airline flying across the Atlantic
again.
The Daily Express called him "a hero of our time,"
and said he "put the world into ordinary people's
hands. ... For a lot of little people who looked up to
him, and whose wings he spread, this morning's skies
will be very empty."
Laker announced the demise of Laker Airways on
Friday after giving up trying to obtain a rescheduling

of his $359 million in debts, much of which came from
orders for new aircraft.
But a group of hotel owners in Shoreham, England,
said they had raised $463,000 in pledges by mid-day
Saturday. A London businessman said he had
drummed up $93,000 in pledges.
"Freddie has given so much to the British public,
they should now come and support him in his hour of
need," said the London businessman, Colin Ray
worth.
A Laker Airways spokesman said a 76-year-old
woman had refused to leave the ticket counter at
Gatwick airport until her check for $1,850 had been
accepted.
Laker said in a TV interview, "I am overhwelmed by
the public reaction and the public support. The tele
phone lines are blocked by people ringing up to ask,
Where can we send money to and what can we do to
help?"
Laker also met with bank-appointed accountants
charged with trying to salvage Laker Airways.
The accountants handling the Laker crisis, Bill
Mackey and Nigel Hamilton of the firm Ernest and
Whinney, said Pan Am, British Airways, Air Florida
and British Caledonian had agreed to honor the re
turn half of Laker tickets in the United States, subject
to seating availability on their flights.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today and tonight, with increasing
clouds tomorrow. Low temperatures in the 30s to
mid-40s, and highs in the 50s. Light and variable
winds.
