Clinical depression is a serious medical con
dition for which about 1.5 million Americans
are treated annually, according to Dr. Philip
Berger, a Medical Center psychiatrist and lead
ing researcher in the field.
He estimated that the average person has a 15
percent chance of suffering from this depres
sion in his lifetime, according to figures from
the National Institute of Health. Untreated, the
periods of sadness, low self-esteem and various
other physical and emotional disturbances per
sist for about six months. However, because the
work of researchers like Berger, Drs. Thomas
Gonda and jack Barchas, also from Stanford's
Dept. of Psychiatry, two treatments have been
developed which are proving increasingly suc

cessful.
Supportive psychotherapy and tricyclicas
anti-depressant medications can sometimes
have people functioning in as short a space of
time as a month, Berger explained.
The medication has no adverse long-term
side effects and often sufferers of clinical de
pression are kept on it for years to prevent re
lapses. It allows the user to function absolutely
normally, he said.
Most clinical depressives are not hospi
talized, but rather are treated as out-patients.
The condition is not necessarily stress-re
lated, but is probably best characterized as an
"innate biological vulnerability to the events of
life,"said Berger. Current research isexamining
closely the possible biological causes of the

problem.
Berger explained that this condition, overall,
tends to make people feel as if "they're viewing
the world through da rk-colored glasses." He
outlined four main categories of symptoms:
mood swings which are like everyday sadness
but more severe, disturbances in the person's
cognitive functioning like low self-esteem, guilt
and pessimism, actual physical disorders and
disturbances of thought and action like slowed
down thinking and movement.
"There is also a condition called anhedonia
(which can be prompted by clinical depres
sion). The things that usually make us feel life is
worth living just don't cheer you up anymore,"
he explained.
