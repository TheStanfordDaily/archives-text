Reagan sends budget to Congress
Washington — President Ronald Reagan sent Congress a $757.6
billion budget for 1983 that proposes the largest deficits in history —
$273 billion over the next three years — along with a second broad
swath of cuts through social programs and a record military build-up.
The election-year budget blueprint, which instantly triggered a furor
among Reagan's congressional friends and foes, projects deficits of
$98.6 billion in fiscal 1982, $91.5 billion in 1983and $82.9 billion in 1984 —
the year congressional Republicans were hoping would produce the
first balanced budget since 1969.
A year after the administration identified deficits as the leading cause
of inflation, and vowed a balanced budget by 1984, officials tried Satur
day to downplay the significance of the red ink.
Budget Director David Stockman acknowledged the deficits were
being described "with words behind them like 'staggering, towering,
gigantic, huge, etc.' But those terms are accurate only if you ignore the
fact that there has been enormous change in the scale of numbers that
we're working with over the last four or five years."
"They're not large in the context of a $3.3 trillion economy," Stock
man said.
Others were not so sanguine.
"I was just sort of in a state of shock when I listenened to the (budget)
briefing," said deputy Republican Senate leader Ted Stevens of Alaska.
Sen. Dan Quayle, Republican of Indiana and a strong backer of the
president, said: "You'll see people starting to jump off the ship on Mon
day." Quayle said he would "work with the administration as much as I
possibly can."
In a message accompanying his budget, Reagan exhorted Congress to
stand by his program of tax cuts for economic recovery. "Our task is to
persevere; to stay the course; toshun retreat; toweather the temporary
dislocations and pressures . .
