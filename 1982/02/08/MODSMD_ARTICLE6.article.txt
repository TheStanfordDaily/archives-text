# Kennedy will co-chair export reg. committee

### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy has agreed to serve as co-chair
man of a new joint committee which
will discuss concerns arising from at
tempts to apply federal export regu
lations to academic activities.
The committee, established by the
Association of American Universities
(AAU) and the Department of De
fense, will hold its first session later
this month. Kennedy told the Faculty
Senate last Thursday that Stanford
graduate Richard Delauer, who
serves as undersecretary of defense
for research and development, will
be the other co-chairman, He ex
pects that the two will meet within a
week.
Last February, Kennedy and four
other major university presidents ex
pressed "grave concern" at federal
attempts to apply export controls to
academic teaching and research in a
joint letter to the secretaries of state,
commerce and defense.
Since then, Kennedy said, "we've
had varying success in discussing and
negotiating with those agencies. The
Department of Defense, I think, has
made a thoroughly responsible effort
to talk the problem through.
"The AAU has been asked by De
fense and has agreed to put together
a joint committee to consider every
aspect of this problem."
Kennedy met last Wednesday with
Frank Press, president of the National
Academyof Sciences(NAS). TheUni
versity informed the NAS last month

that it would not apply State Depart
ment restrictions to the proposed vis
it of a Soviet expert on walking ma
chines.
Describing his conversation with
Press to the senate, Kennedy said,
"We agreed to work together with
the State Department to see if a way
could be found to make such instruc
tions acceptable.
After the senate session,' Kennedy
said "NAS has made some progress"
and said he doesn't regard the State
Department's position as "inflex
ible."
In the senate, he reiterated his
view that the restrictions were "over
broad" and "inappropriate" for aca
demic activities and that universities
"could not deliver" on their enforce
ment "even if the government were
right."
At the same meeting, Kennedy re
sponded to recently-published con
cerns that the CIA may be intensify
ing its recruitment efforts here and
on campuses generally by saying that
there have been no charges or specif
ic allegations that individual Univer
sity faculty have acted as represent
atives or recruiters for the CIA. He
also noted that rules recently
adopted by the Faculty Senate permit
the president, provost, or ap
propriate dean to investigate pos
sible conflicts of interest arising from
faculty consulting when questions
arise.
