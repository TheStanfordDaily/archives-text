## Fashion furor in Moscow 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — A young Soviet
conscript returned recently to
his native city of Simferopol to
find it "literally flooded with
shirts bearing the legend 'U.S.
Army" and tags with the
(American) eagle."
Having spent the previous
two years in a paratroop unit,
Pavel Ribchenko was first
startled to see a 19-year-old girl
with a patch on her sleeve
showing the Stars and Stripes
and American eagle. Then he
realized that in his absence the
city had been practically oc
cupied by young people wear
ing jeans and T-shirts with in
scriptions ranging from "Los
Angeles Police Department" to
"Boston University."
just looking around,
Ribchenko recalled in a letter
to the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda, "\ was
reminded of the existence of
the so-called Soviet Institutes,
financed by American in
telligence."
Things that all Soviet con
scripts are taught have led him
to conclude that he was in the
midst of "psychological war"
where the enemy was trying to
"enter the subconsciousness"
of average Soviet youths and
"impose the notion that ev
erything American — the

jeans, automobiles, etc. — was
the best."
The influx of American jeans
and T-shirts results from sales
here by foreign tourists, who
find the prices paid for their
pants too favorable to resist,
and by enterprising Russians
who bring the goods back from
trips abroad.
The craze for blue jeans and
"real labels" has been sweep
ing the Soviet Union forseveral
years. But in the past weeks, ap
parently as a result of party calls
for greater vigilance following
the Polish crisis, the Soviet me
dia have become increasingly
critical of symbols of Western
lifestyles.
Also writing in
Komsomolskaya Pravda, the
main Communist youth or
ganization's newspaper, V.
Idayatov endorsed vigilante
raids against jeans and T-shirts.
But, he said, the raiding parties
should attempt tactfully to
shame young people into un
derstanding the harm of their
sartorial inclinations.
Some emblazoned slogans,
he said, are simply hostile to so
cialism. People often "don't
understand the meaning of this
or that symbol."
"The eradication of Western
symbols is a serious matter," he
continued. "It is part of the
education of young people to

ideological maturity, political
understanding and artistic and
aesthetic culture."
There also has been criticism
of rock music and Western
dancing, which one writer de
scribed as being "in most cases
something resembling the rit
uals of a witch doctor."
The tone and volume of
criticism appears somewhat
harsher than in the past, when
the authorities sought to beat
the fashion by joining it. The
Russians are making blue jeans
of their own as well as T-shirts
with their own slogans
emblazoned on them.
