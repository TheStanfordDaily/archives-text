Costa Rica — The local cur
rency has fallen 450 percent in
the past 18 months, the govern
ment has exhausted its interna
tional credit and basic foods
such as butter and sugar have
disappeared from the stores.
Yet there is a strange
buoyancy among the 2.2 mil
lion Costa Ricans as they pre
pare to elect a new president
and 57-member legislative as
sembly Sunday, an optimism
based on the belief that a new
government means instant re
lief.

There are an estimated one
million voters and it is taken for
granted that at least 80 percent
of them will vote Sunday and
then dip their middle finger in
indelible ink to prevent a sec
ond trip to the polls.
"The hardest day in this
country's history will be the
day after the elections," said
Jose "Don Pepe" Figueres Fer
rer, 75, the twice-elected
former president, leader of the
revolution and national hero.
"There will be no easy way to
solve our problems."
The government has sold all
its gold and spent its foreign re

serves and economists say the
nation entered the first phase
of a depression around Jan. 1,
The current administration
of Rodrigo Carazo Odio is the
only government in the hemi
sphere in default on its foreign
debt. Not even token interest
payments are being made.
Carazo, who is forbidden by
law from seeking re-election,
has been meeting his problems
by printing money. The next
president will not have that
choice. The full economic im
pact of the disaster is expected
to hit in the next few months.
