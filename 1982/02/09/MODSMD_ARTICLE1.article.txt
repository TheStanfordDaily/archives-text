# Bourgois survives jungle chase

### Sally Newman 
Caught in the midst of a "clean
up operation" zone in El Salvador
while searching for a site to con
duct dissertation research, an
thropology graduate student Phil
ippe Bourgois spent two weeks
running for his life. He and a
group of Salvadoran peasants hid
by day and ran by night, constant
ly on the lookout for Salvadoran
troops, "all the time feeling we
wouldn't make it,"he said.
The ironic part of his story,
though, is that if Bourgois hadn't
made it back to the safety of a
Honduras refugee camp, he
would have been killed by an
American-made gun fired by a
soldier riding in an American
made Huey helicopter.
Moreover, it is likely that his
Salvadoran killer would have
been trained by an American mili
tary adviser. According to a
Salvadoran government release,
its AtLacatl battalion — trained by
American advisers — had
spearheaded the "clean-up oper
ation."
Bourgois, an American citizen
(his father is French) and 1978
graduate of Harvard, recalled that
despite this, "generally the peo
ple were very accepting of me,
and glad that an American was
witnessing this. One peasant even
whispered to me, as we were
crouching by a tree trunk with a
Huey helicopter firing down at us,
'Isn't it too bad that (President
Ronald) Reagan isn't here?
Wouldn't he be sad if he saw
this?' "
Bourgois, who declined to have
his picture taken by the media be
cause he said he fears identi

fication if he returns to El
Salvador, never planned on shar
ing such harrowing experiences
with a group of terrified, starving
peasants: he didn't even have an
approved research topic, let alone
an idea of where he wanted to
conduct his investigation. It was
the morning he was scheduled to
leave the country, last Nov. 11,
that a little boy appeared at his
host's home to report that Hon
duran troops had blocked off the
border and that they were en
circled by advancing Salvadoran
troops.
"I had thought it was safe,"
Bourgois said.
The residents of the besieged
30-square-mile region decided to
flee. The leftist rebels Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front
(FMLN) still guarded the per
iphery of the region so the
Salvadoran military could not
enter it.
However, "we knew that if the
army got in, they would ex
terminate us,"Bourgoissaid. Later
on, "when we reentered the re
gion to try to get through to Hon
duras, the first thing that hit us was
the stench of rotting bodies. They
killed every single living thing
they found, including animals,"
he said.
Between Nov. 11 and Nov. 24,
when Bourgois finally made it
across the Honduran border, he
and his group of about 1000 mem
bers of a village in the province of
Cabanas ran and hid. They made a
loop through the region cor
doned off for "sanitization," out
into the surrounding countryside,
and back again, all the while seek
ing a safe place to hide until the

operation was over.
At one point, the group ran
straight through the Salvadoran
army's firing line. "Two people
right near me were killed," said
Bourgois. "One of them was a lit
tle boy — a grenade had blown off
the bottom part of his body. In or
der to continue along the path, we
had to run right over him."
By time the group, helped by
the diversionary fire of the anti
government rebels, succeeded in
getting past the area scheduled
for destruction, the group only
numbered about 600. Attrition be
tween then and the time of the es
cape into Honduras, from heli
copter strafing, hunger and
fatigue, was slow but steady.
Bourgois attributed his own sur
vival to several factors, not the
least of them incredible good for

tune. "In addition to being lucky, I
was young, healthy, and well
nourished — though I lost 20
pounds during those two weeks. I
was wearing shoes, wasn't carry
ing a baby, and could 'hit the dirt'
quickly."
The 13-day odyssey of Bourgois
and his group was not an isolated
event, according to Bourgois. But
that did not lessen its horror, and
it only strengthened his resolve to
"let people know,"he said.
"How could someone argue
that El Salvador is vital to U.S. in
terests?" Bourgois asked. "Their
main exports are coffee, cotton,
sugar, cattle and illegal immi
grants. It's knee-jerk anti-com
rnunism — the same thing that got
us into Vietnam."
If anti-communism is the Rea

gan administration's sole reason for
supporting the regime of President
Jose Duarte, it's wrong on at least two
counts, according to Bourgois. "First,
nothing can be worse than what they
have now. And second, all of these
fighters are local yokels. I'd go up to
a peasant who had a gun and say,
'What do you think of the Soviet
Union?' He'd just look at me blankly
and say, 'Who?' "
Raymond Duncan, a visiting Hoo
ver scholar from the State University
of New York (SUNY) at Rochester
who is a specialist in Latin American
affairs, corroborated much of
Bourgois' analysis. "Mexico, which
has a greater interest in keeping the
region stable, feels that the major
source of change in El Salvador is in
ternally produced, not stimulated by
outside forces, as we seem to be
lieve," he said.
"There's some speculation among
Mexican observers about how seri
ously the USSR and Cuba really want
an 'orthodox communist regime' in
El Salvador," Duncan said.
