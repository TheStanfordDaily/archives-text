# Eyesight may not develop fully until birth

Research here is showing
that the precise nerve connec
tions between eye and brain
may develop in conjunction
with normal use of the eyes at
birth.
Carla Shatz, assistant pro
fessor of neurobiology, is stu
dying prenatal cats, whose ner
vous system is similar to a hu
man's, to understand how the
complex nerve connections
between the eyes and brain be
come organized.
While experiments with ra
dioactive tracers show that the
eye is connected to the target
structure in the brain before
the eye begins to function,
Shatz said, "Before birth, the
nerve endings do not always
lead from the eye to the exact
point on the brain where they
are supposed to be."
Shatz's research is directed
towards understanding the re
fining process by which the
"sloppy" first connections are
replaced by precise ones, and

in what way this process is re
lated to normal eye function.
"The use of an organ such as
the eye," she said, "is a vital
part of neurological develop
ment."
By defining different periods
in the development of eye
brain nerve connections, and
the factors involved in per
fecting these connections,
Shatz's studies may have future
relevance for understanding
sight abnormalities.
Scientists have known for
several years that when an eye
defect, such as a cataract, is
present at birth, the unafflicted
eye compensates by develop
ing more fully at the other's ex
pense. Shatz said she hopes to
determine exactly how the
good eye "takes over."
If the complex wiring system
between eye and brain is fully
understood, it will "serve pri
marily as a model system for
future understanding of all
precise nerve transmissions",
according to Shatz.
