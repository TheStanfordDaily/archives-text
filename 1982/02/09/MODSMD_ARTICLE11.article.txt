# Math problem solution won't endanger codes

### Bill Beyda 
The recent solution of a
3000-year-old mathematical
problem, determining wheth
er a given large number is
prime, has shed new light on
the nature of mathematical
truth, as well as prematurely
raising concern for the security
of important secret codes.
A team of Europeans used a
new method of Leonard
Adelman and Robert Rumely
of the University of Southern
California and Carl Pomerance
of the University of Georgia to
show that a 97-digit number
was prime in 77 seconds. Pre
viously it would have taken at
least 100 years for a computer
to do this.
A prime number is divisible
only by one and itself. One way
to see if a number is prime is to
look for other factors by trying
all possible candidates. How
ever, this takes a long time,
even on fast computers.

Rapid tests for primality ex
isted before, but could only in
dicate if a number was likely to
be prime. Some mathemati
cians speculated that absolute
certainty on such questions
might be beyond reach, a situ
ation not unlike that in the
physical sciences, as
Pomerance noted in a recent
paper.
However, the new algorithm
can determine without a doubt
if a number is prime — without
the tedious process of factor
ing.
"It's a beautiful piece of
mathematics," said Donald
Knuth, professor of computer
science at here. "Until this
method, we could tell within a
second or two whether or not a
97-digit number was prime
with a large degree of certain
ty, but we couldn't be sure,"
Knuth said. "This method is a
sure proof."
Factoring is thought to be so

difficult that several secret
codes were designed so that
breaking the code involved
factoring large numbers. These
codes may include those used
by the federal government as
well as a "public key system"
developed by Adelman and
others at MIT. Early accounts of
the new algorithm speculated
that these codes might no
longer be secure.
"Nobody knows for sure
what our nation's top diplo
matic codes are," said Martin ■
Hellman, professor of elec- .
trical engineering here, and "
pioneer in public key codes.
"Many think they're based on
large numbers as factors. But
prime number determination
is a much simpler task than fac
toring."
Though primality testing can
now be done rapidly, it appears "
we are far from a fast method
for factoring, which is impor
tant in coding.
