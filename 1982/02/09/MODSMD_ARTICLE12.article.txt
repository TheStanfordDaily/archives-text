## Escaping to the great outdoors 
### Jane McConnell 
If spring is the time when young
hearts turn to love, it is also the time
when Stanford students take to the out
doors. As the weather gets warmer,
thoughts turn less to term papers and
more to picnics. This is the season to
take advantage of the countless parks
and open space districts all within a
short distance from campus.
Just a few minutes from campus is
Flood Park, a 23-acre area in Menlo
Park. Four tennis courts, a Softball and a
hardball diamond, horseshoe pits and
picnic areas make it ideal for recrea
tion-seekers. The park is located on Bay
Road, off of Marsh Road from the
Bayshore Freeway.
Also within biking distance of the
campus is Junipero Serra Park, on
Crystal Springs Road between Highway
280 and El Camino Real in San Bruno.
One hundred acres of Oakland and
grassland chapparal abound in wild
flowers,
For a real taste of the wilderness feel
ing within 30 miles of here, there is San
Pedro Valley Park, which covers 100
acres in the Lindemar Valley. Bobcat,
fox, deer, owls, turkey, vultures, and an
occasional golden eagle, make the park
their home, and a creek stocked with
steelhands provides fishing in the late
summer months. There are large
meadows for sunbathing, picnic areas
which may be reserved for large
groups, volleyball courts and equip
ment, and horseshoe pits.
Huddart Park, in Woodside off High
way 84, comprises 970 acres, and boasts
15 miles of hiking trails. There are pic
nicking areas, a small campground, and
visitors are likely to run into a few deer,
raccoons, coyotes, and maybe even a
bobcat.
Adjacent to Huddart is Wunderlich
Park, primarily for horseback riders.
Nine hundred and forty-two acres of

riding trails through redwood and oak
forests offer spectacular views across
Skykine Blvd. Private stables are located
in the park, and visitors may bring their
own horses.
An intensive study of nature is avail
able right in Palo Alto at Baylands Na
ture Interpretive Center. This 120-acre
preserve, off the left fork at the end of
Embarcadero, is primarily marshland.
Boardwalks and paths crisscross the salt
marsh, and a duck pond contains 23
species of duck. A building in the
middle of the marsh is staffed by two
naturalists, who help visitors to identify
birds, study the interrelationships be
tween plants and animals, and prepare
their own microscope slides. Nature
walks, movies and slide shows are also
given.
In the town of La Honda, near
Woodside, are Sam McDonald County
Park and Pescadero Creek. The parks
are about 17 miles from campus, on
Pescadero Road off of Highway 84. To
gether they cover 6700 acres, and
nearby Heritage Redwood Grove adds
another 40 acres. It is not rare to see
beaver, mountain lions, badgers and
bobcats in the area.
There are hiking trails and picnic
areas, and for the overnight camper
there is a hikers' hut with a stove and
fireplace, which can be reserved
through the Sierra Club at 327-8111.
Riders can stay overnight in a horse
camp, equipped with a barn and pad
docks, showers, and picnic tables.
Nearby Memorial Park has a creek
which is a popular swimming area in
warmer weather, and a new nature trail
for the physically limited. Overnight
camping is available.
The Mid-Peninsula Open Space Dis
trict contains 15 open space preserves,
intended for scenic preservation. The
preserves have no picnic tables,
campsites or restrooms, but offer ob
servation of the environment in its nat-

Ural state.
Skyline Preserves and Parks, contain
ing Saratoga Gap/Monte Bello Open
Space Preserve and Skyline County
Park, is a 3800-acre area in the moun
tains above Palo Alto and Los Altos.
Here, spring wildflowers and Douglas
firs flourish in the lush creek woodland,
and snow falls at the 2000 foot level sev
eral times a year. A 7.6 mile trail takes
you from one end of the preserve to the
other, and requires about five hours to
hike in one direction.
Bordering on the Monte Bello Pre
serve is Los Trancos Preserve, which fea
tures a five mile trail system partially
leading along the San Andreas Fault
Line. The preserve is an ideal place to
study earthquake related features. Thir
teen different stations along the fault
line are interpreted in a detailed
brochure available at the start of the
trail.
Nearby Rancho San Antonio Space
Preserve was originally part of a large
Mexican land grant, later converted
into a cattle ranch in 1860. The original
farm buildings, known as Deer Hollow
Farm, house a variety of environmental
education programs.
The Duveneck Windmill Pasture
Area, part of Rancho San Antonio, was
once part of the 2300-acre Hidden Villa
Ranch. The original windmill still
stands. Equestrians, hikers and over
night campers are welcome to enjoy
the area. The preserve is reached from
Highway 280 via El Monte and Moody
Roads.
Many of the parks and preserves are
currently suffering from storm damage,
and some of the trails are closed for the
time being. Most of the parks are open
from dawn to dusk, and require a small
entrance fee on weekends. All are
within a 30-minute drive from Stanford,
contain spots of remarkable beauty,
and provide an opportunity to get away
from it all.

ing Saratoga Gap/Monte Bello Open
Space Preserve and Skyline County
Park, is a 3800-acre area in the moun
tains above Palo Alto and Los Altos.
Here, spring wildflowers and Douglas
firs flourish in the lush creek woodland,

eral times a year. A 7.6 mile trail takes
you from one end of the preserve to the
other, and requires about five hours to
hike in one direction.
Bordering on the Monte Bello Pre
serve is Los Trancos Preserve, which fea
tures a five mile trail system partially
leading along the San Andreas Fault
Line. The preserve is an ideal place to
study earthquake related features. Thir
teen different stations along the fault
line are interpreted in a detailed
brochure available at the start of the

farm buildings, known as Deer Hollow
Farm, house a variety of environmental
education programs.
The Duveneck Windmill Pasture

BACK TO NATURE — Huddart Park near Woodside is only one of many places where students can get away trom
it all.
If spring is the time when young
hearts turn to love, it is also the time
when Stanford students take to the out
doors. As the weather gets warmer,
thoughts turn less to term papers and
more to picnics. This is the season to
take advantage of the countless parks
and open space districts all within a
short distance from campus.
Just a few minutes from campus is
Flood Park, a 23-acre area in Menlo
Park. Four tennis courts, a Softball and a
hardball diamond, horseshoe pits and
picnic areas make it ideal for recrea
tion-seekers. The park is located on Bay
Road, off of Marsh Road from the
Bayshore Freeway.
Also within biking distance of the
campus is Junipero Serra Park, on
Crystal Springs Road between Highway
280 and El Camino Real in San Bruno.
One hundred acres of Oakland and
grassland chapparal abound in wild
flowers,
For a real taste of the wilderness feel
ing within 30 miles of here, there is San
Pedro Valley Park, which covers 100
acres in the Lindemar Valley. Bobcat,
fox, deer, owls, turkey, vultures, and an
occasional golden eagle, make the park
their home, and a creek stocked with
steelhands provides fishing in the late
summer months. There are large
meadows for sunbathing, picnic areas
which may be reserved for large
groups, volleyball courts and equip
ment, and horseshoe pits.
Huddart Park, in Woodside off High
way 84, comprises 970 acres, and boasts
15 miles of hiking trails. There are pic
nicking areas, a small campground, and

raccoons, coyotes, and maybe even a
bobcat.

Park, primarily for horseback riders.
Nine hundred and forty-two acres of

riding trails through redwood and oak
forests offer spectacular views across
Skykine Blvd. Private stables are located
in the park, and visitors may bring their
own horses.
An intensive study of nature is avail
able right in Palo Alto at Baylands Na
ture Interpretive Center. This 120-acre
preserve, off the left fork at the end of
Embarcadero, is primarily marshland.
Boardwalks and paths crisscross the salt
marsh, and a duck pond contains 23
species of duck. A building in the
middle of the marsh is staffed by two
naturalists, who help visitors to identify
birds, study the interrelationships be
tween plants and animals, and prepare
their own microscope slides. Nature
walks, movies and slide shows are also
given.
In the town of La Honda, near
Woodside, are Sam McDonald County
Park and Pescadero Creek. The parks
are about 17 miles from campus, on
Pescadero Road off of Highway 84. To
gether they cover 6700 acres, and
nearby Heritage Redwood Grove adds
another 40 acres. It is not rare to see
beaver, mountain lions, badgers and
bobcats in the area.

areas, and for the overnight camper
there is a hikers' hut with a stove and
fireplace, which can be reserved
through the Sierra Club at 327-8111.
Riders can stay overnight in a horse
camp, equipped with a barn and pad
docks, showers, and picnic tables.

which is a popular swimming area in
warmer weather, and a new nature trail
for the physically limited. Overnight
camping is available.
The Mid-Peninsula Open Space Dis
trict contains 15 open space preserves,
intended for scenic preservation. The
preserves have no picnic tables,
campsites or restrooms, but offer ob
