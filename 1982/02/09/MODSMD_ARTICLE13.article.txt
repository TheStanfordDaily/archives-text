# Letter writing campaign lacks student support

A campuswide appeal two weeks ago from
Amnesty International and Memorial Church to
have letters written on behalf of 150 Polish pris
oners has resulted in a "tremendous flop" in re
sponses.
According to Wendy Smith, associate dean of
the chapel at Memorial Church, only eight or
nine students came in to write letters. Although
two student dorms and many churchgoers vol
unteered earlier, these efforts were only partly
successful.
For the last four years the church has aided
Amnesty in its Urgent Action campaign, Smith
said. The campaign calls for letter writing on
behalf of specific prisoners-of-conscience being
held by governments.
The church makes an announcement about a
different prisoner on the second Sunday of each
month and provides letter writing materials fol
lowing the church service so people can write
on the spot. Letters are sent to both the country
and the country's embassy in the United States.
"If you're the head of a government and have
thrown someone in prison for political views,
everything's fine so long as it's kept quiet,"
Smith said. "But if the press gets a hold of the fact
that a specific person is in jail and the embassy
starts receiving letters to that effect, it exerts
some kind of pressure."
This last Urgent Action case involved more ur
gency than usual because Amnesty needed sep
arate letters written for each of 150 Polish pris
oners. "Thousands of people have been arrested
for being 'suspected' of opposing the present
law in Poland," said Ginetta Sagan of the San
Francisco office of Amnesty International.
The reason for requesting so many letters is
that "the more letters written, the more psy
chological and social pressure is placed on the
goverment," Smith said.
Smith guaranteed Sagan 50 letters, as each
month" 25 to 50 letters generally are written on
behalf of individual prisoners. "Fifty-eight peo
ple responded after the service on Jan. 24, and
the resident fellows (R.F.s) from Donner and
Madera each took 25 names, saying that students
in their dorms would write letters," Smith said.
Smith extended the plea for letters cam
puswide because she said it had occurred to her
that students throughout campus would be in
terested and concerned about the crisis. "I was
surprised and disappointed with the response

after the plea in the Daily," she said.
Not only was student response at Memorial
Church unpredictably small, but responses at
Donner and Madera to the proposals of the R.F.s
varied greatly.
Dennis Matt hies, Donner R.F.,said he thought
that students would be eager to help in the crisis,
so he presented the campaign to Donner at a
house meeting. "The dorm has lots of en
thusiasm, and I thought the idea would get a
good response," he said. "We always have good
turnouts for whatever we do."
Matthies received no response from the stu
dents. "Not one came up to me about it after
wards," Mathias said.
Matthies also spoke of the difficulty his stu
dents have when writing a political letter.
"They'll always say, 'but you don't want us to
send it, do you?' and the letter usually comes in
looking like an essay. It's a very strange thing to
write a letter for a political cause. A letter is usu
ally written to a friend."
Kathleen Namphy, Madera R.F., received a
completely different response to her presenta
tion. Namphy said she sees a great need in the
Polish crisis and she supports Amnesty Interna
tional.. She announced the campaign at a house
meeting Feb. 3 and received a "spontaneous,
positive response."More than the necessary 25
offered to write letters.
Namphy said that in presenting the campaign
she made an appeal that stressed that 20 minutes
spent writing a letter could save a life.
Madera freshman Scott Dubin said he decided
to write a leter because "it's for a good cause.
Our R.F. told us that it's been proven to put pres
sure on goverments to get people free. I think
writing a letter is worth it."
"It seemed like a worthwhile thing to do," said
freshman Nanette Archer, who also lives in
Madera. "I don't know if it will help, but if it will,
I'd be glad to do it," she said.
Results of Amnesty's campaigns are in fact no
ticeable, according to an Amnesty newsletter
which gave accounts of political prisoners freed
after Amnesty campaigns.
However, there is no way of assessing how
much good the organization accomplishes, ac
cording to Sagan. But she said the letters show
governments the "mobilized power of public
opinion."
"We want to convey to a government the con
cern of average people. We are not politicians,"
Sagan said.
