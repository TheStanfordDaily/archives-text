## Editorial Violations in El Salvador 
### 
Amidst periodic reports of civilian massacres
committed by the armed forces of El Salvador,
the Reagan administration'scontention that
enough progresson human rights issues has
been made by that country's government to
warrant an additional $155 million in U.S. aid is a
cyncial useof human rights policy.
The Reagan administration hasalreadysent
$55 million in emergency military aid to civil
war-torn El Salvadorand last week requestedan
additional $100 million in military and economic
aid for theupcoming year.
Tying U.S. aidtoElSalvadortothat
government's progress on human rights was a
provision of last year's aid package inserted by
Congress to ensure that U.S. weapons were not
used against the civilian population of that
country.
The administration's failure to see human
rights violations committed by supportive
rightist governments undermines its efforts to
expose and to protest such violations
committed by Communist regimes like Poland.
The selective application of human rights,
besides severely damaging U.S. credibility in the
international community, represents a cynical
useof the whole notion of human rights.
Of course this contradictory policy makes
much more sense when one considers the
simplistic world view upon which the
administrations's foreign policy is predicated. It
is that cold war outlook which has led to this
dicohotomous human rights policy.

In the past this policy has opened the door for
alliances with any regime that would utter the
anti-Soviet line, regardless of that regime's
repressive policies.
The human rights stipulation on theaidtoEl
Salvador was in part an effort to prevent U.S. aid
and alliances with repressive regimes. The
Reagan administration's willingnessto gloss
over human rights violations committed by
governments that espouse the anti-Soviet line
— something they feel will further U.S. interests
— is a return to the old policy which led to
embarrasing alliances with Shah Reza Pahlavi's
Iranian government and Anastasia Somoza's
Nicaraguan regime.
A recent trip to El Salvador by Stanford student
Phillip Bourgois provides just one example of
the disregard that the Salvadoran armed forces
have for the civilian population.
Mounting evidence gathered by groups such
as Amnesty International have shown that gross
human rights violations committed by the
government of El Salvador, such as those
witnessed by Bourgois are not a rare exception,
but rather a frequent occurrance.
We hope that Congress and the American
people are not persuaded intoaccepting the
political rationale for human rights violations by
governments thatare"friendly"tothe U.S.
Besides being morally abhorrent, this
shortsigted policy weakens U.S. credibility
everywhere and can often lead toembarrasing
•and damaging alliances.
