## Clouding Israeli-Arab issue 
### 
I read with interest Randy
Broberg's Viewpoint of Feb. 5, and I
share his concern for the mentality
Israel is developing after decades of
warfare.
However, some of Broberg's ob
servations are preposterous if they
are intended, as this reader suspects
that they are, to make a statement
about Israeli life.
First, Broberg quotes one Israeli as
proposing that the solution to the
Palestinian problem was "to ship 'em
out of here."
This attitude, which is roughly
equivalent to American thought vis
a-vis the Native Americans of 150
years ago, does exist in Israel. Politi
cally, it is reflected in the activities of
the Tehiya ultranationalist party,
which holds two out of 120 seats in
the Knesset (the Israeli parliament)
and by the Kach movement, which is
not directly represented in the
Knesset.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin deliberately excluded Tehiya
from his coalition government.
Several times, Begin has used the
military to restrain Kach movement
actions in the West Bank and has
jailed its leaders for threats they have
made against Israeli Arabcitizensand
West Bank Arabs. The opposition La
bor Party has always denounced the
actions of these few rightist fanatics.
These few reactionaries character
ize Israeli politics to the same extent
that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) would
represent Massachusetts public
opinion.

Second, Broberg said that within
• Israel, Jewish and Arab standards of
living diverged radically. I disagree
with this proposition that Jewish sec
tions of Israel are uniformly wealthy.
Israeli Jews certainly do not ride
around in "air-conditioned
Mercedes buses" all day, and few are
wealthy enough toown automobiles.
If Broberg had visited the com
munities of the Sephardi Jews, he
would have seen that poverty crosses
all religious lines. There are literally
hundreds of thousands of tremen
dously impoverished Jews in Israel
whom Broberg forgot to mention.
Third, I strongly disagree with
Broberg's suggestion that Israelis
who live on kibbutzim and in villages
near the Syrian and Lebanese
borders are responsible for the casu
alties that they suffer at the hands of
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO).
Israel's geographical size is about
equal to Vermont's. At its narrowest
point, Israel proper is less than 15
miles wide. Physically, Israel cannot
restrict her Jewish populace to areas
away from Arab borders; there are
no such locations in the state.
Moreover, the fact that the PLO
aims Katyusha rockets at Israeli vil
lages can hardly be blamed on Israel.
It is amazing that Broberg does not
express outrage that Israel has to en
dure such attacks at all.
Fourth, Broberg accurately
assessed Israeli Arabs as a mostly hos
pitable and friendly group. I, too,
pleasantly experienced Arab hospi

tality during my stay in Israel several
years ago.
More disturbing in Broberg's opin
ion that the Jews of Israel were not
friendly. I found them very con
siderate, despite the fact that I had
language and other typical tourist
difficulties.
I think that most Stanford students
would agree that negatively charac
terizing all Jewish-Israelis on the
basis of a few real or perceived ex
periences, as Broberg has done,
smacks of racism.
Broberg furtherclaimedthat Israel
practices apartheid. His evidence
vests on the existence of separate but
unequal "Jewish" and "Arab" buses.
This claim is nothing short of inflam
matory fiction.
Jews and Arabs ride in both the
front and the back of the same buses.
They eat in the same restaurants,
sleep in the same hotels, use the
same restrooms, and elect represent
atives to the Knesset. They observe
the same code of criminal law. Apart
heid simply does not exist in Israeli
law.
Peace will never come about as a
consequence of blaming the Israelies
for every imaginable evil.
Rather, there has to be an ad
mission of fault on both sides; that
warfare is not a legitimate means of
settling grievances, and that each
side has aspirations and human
needs which deserve to be ad
dressed.
It is a shame that Broberg's article
and others like it cloud the issues in
venom and accusation, and thus set
back any discussion of how a Middle
East peace could come about.

not directly represented in the
Knesset.
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin deliberately excluded Tehiya
from his coalition government.
Several times, Begin has used the
military to restrain Kach movement
actions in the West Bank and has
jailed its leaders for threats they have
made against Israeli Arabcitizensand
West Bank Arabs. The opposition La
bor Party has always denounced the
actions of these few rightist fanatics.
These few reactionaries character
ize Israeli politics to the same extent
that Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) would
represent Massachusetts public
opinion.

Second, Broberg said that within
• Israel, Jewish and Arab standards of
living diverged radically. I disagree
with this proposition that Jewish sec
tions of Israel are uniformly wealthy.
Israeli Jews certainly do not ride
around in "air-conditioned
Mercedes buses" all day, and few are
wealthy enough toown automobiles.
If Broberg had visited the com
munities of the Sephardi Jews, he
would have seen that poverty crosses
all religious lines. There are literally
hundreds of thousands of tremen
dously impoverished Jews in Israel
whom Broberg forgot to mention.
Third, I strongly disagree with
Broberg's suggestion that Israelis
who live on kibbutzim and in villages
near the Syrian and Lebanese
borders are responsible for the casu
alties that they suffer at the hands of
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO).
Israel's geographical size is about
equal to Vermont's. At its narrowest
point, Israel proper is less than 15
miles wide. Physically, Israel cannot
restrict her Jewish populace to areas
away from Arab borders; there are
no such locations in the state.
Moreover, the fact that the PLO
aims Katyusha rockets at Israeli vil
lages can hardly be blamed on Israel.
It is amazing that Broberg does not
express outrage that Israel has to en
dure such attacks at all.
Fourth, Broberg accurately
assessed Israeli Arabs as a mostly hos
pitable and friendly group. I, too,
pleasantly experienced Arab hospi

tality during my stay in Israel several
years ago.
More disturbing in Broberg's opin
ion that the Jews of Israel were not
friendly. I found them very con
siderate, despite the fact that I had
language and other typical tourist
difficulties.
I think that most Stanford students
would agree that negatively charac
terizing all Jewish-Israelis on the
basis of a few real or perceived ex
periences, as Broberg has done,
smacks of racism.
Broberg furtherclaimedthat Israel
practices apartheid. His evidence
vests on the existence of separate but
unequal "Jewish" and "Arab" buses.
This claim is nothing short of inflam
matory fiction.
Jews and Arabs ride in both the
front and the back of the same buses.
They eat in the same restaurants,
sleep in the same hotels, use the
same restrooms, and elect represent
atives to the Knesset. They observe
the same code of criminal law. Apart
heid simply does not exist in Israeli
law.
Peace will never come about as a
consequence of blaming the Israelies
for every imaginable evil.
Rather, there has to be an ad
mission of fault on both sides; that
warfare is not a legitimate means of
settling grievances, and that each
side has aspirations and human
needs which deserve to be ad
dressed.
It is a shame that Broberg's article
and others like it cloud the issues in
venom and accusation, and thus set
back any discussion of how a Middle
East peace could come about.

I read with interest Randy
Broberg's Viewpoint of Feb. 5, and I
share his concern for the mentality
Israel is developing after decades of
warfare.
However, some of Broberg's ob
servations are preposterous if they
are intended, as this reader suspects
that they are, to make a statement
about Israeli life.
First, Broberg quotes one Israeli as
proposing that the solution to the
Palestinian problem was "to ship 'em
out of here."
This attitude, which is roughly
equivalent to American thought vis
a-vis the Native Americans of 150
years ago, does exist in Israel. Politi
cally, it is reflected in the activities of
the Tehiya ultranationalist party,
which holds two out of 120 seats in
the Knesset (the Israeli parliament)
and by the Kach movement, which is
not directly represented in the
Knesset.
