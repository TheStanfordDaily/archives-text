## Israeli apartheid? 
### 
There are people who have been
to Italy and still insist that all Italians
are dirty. In his (Daily, Feb. 5) View
point "Beware of Israeli Apartheid"
Randy Broberg disclosed that his pre
viously professed knowledge of "an
cient political history as well as the
current political environment" came
to a much greater understanding af
ter his tour of Israel last August. Ap
parently, his tripto Israel wasasquick
and superficial as his lessons in an
cient history and current politics.
Broberg's historical offering that
"the Palestinians have been living
here 1900 years, longer than the Jews
have ever controlled this land," is un
fortunately nebulous and untrue. Ex
actly who does he mean has been in
the land 1900 years? Surely there has
always been some Arab bedouin
population, but the fact remains that
by 1947 "over 75 percent of the Arab
population of Palestine were either
immigrants themselves or direct de
scendants of persons who immi
grated into Palestine during the last
100 years" (Esco Foundation for
Palestine Inc., Yale University Press,
1947).
Also, the documentation of Jewish
presence in Palestine from ancient
times throughout the centuries is an
incontrovertible part of the historic
record, as supported thoroughly by
the famous Christian historian James
Parkes.
In regard to current events, he re
minds us that the formation of a Jew
ish homeland means "indigenous
Arabs have no real part in the life of
the nation." If playing a part means
serving in the military he has a point
— if it means sharing full political
rights and religious freedoms then he

is once again off the mark.
Unlike South African apartheid
victims, Israeli Arabs can vote (and
indeed four Arabs currently hold
seats in the Israeli Parliament), they
can pursue higher education, and
they may live where they want
without legal restrictions. Moreover,
if our Israeli visitor was distressed
with the crowded and dirty condi
tions Arabs must face in Jerusalem —
may I suggest he travel to Cairo, Am
man and Damascus for an en
lightening comparison. May I also re
mind Broberg that Jerusalem's "con
trastingly wealthy, clean and quiet
Jewish-quarter" was rebuilt after
pre-1967 Jordanian destruction and
misrule.
Finally, his insinuation that Israeli
parents in Kibbutzim along enemy
borders willfully sacrifice their chil
dren to terrorist bombs in the name
of patriotism is absurd. It shows a
gross disregard for the intense value
on human life found in Israel.
Everyone is entitled to an opinion
and criticism can be a helpful instru
ment towards social progress — but
what I find suspect in Broberg's re
sponse is the strained effort to up
hold the United Nation's diseased
propaganda which equated Zionism
with racism at the expense of in
tellectual honesty and human digni
ty.
If Broberg is to escape an equal de
gradation of his credibility then I rec
ommend that he reinvestigate his his
tory books and return to Israel with
open eyes. Afterwards he may have
the "chutzpah" to voice his opinion
for public consideration.
