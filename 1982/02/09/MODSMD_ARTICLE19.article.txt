## El Salvador — not a Vietnam 
### 
Washington — President Ronald
Reagan's decision last week to pro
vide the U.S.-backed Salvadoran jun
ta with $55 million in "emergency"
military aid was a blunt reminder to
the Vietnam generation: some ad
ministrations aren't adverse to em
broiling America in another
quagmire on foreign soil.
Unlike the Johnson White House,
however, which lunged blindly intoa
deepening morass in Vietnam, the
Reagan administration can't act im
pulsively overseas without paying a
heavy price at home.
The world in 1982 is a far different
place from the world of Lyndon
Johnson, reflecting in part the bitter
ly-learned lessons transposed from
one era to another, it won't take sev
en years of domestic resistance to
change government policies, as was
the case in the Vietnam War.
This was evident on Jan. 26 when
three congressmen — Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.), Tom Harkin (D-lowa) and
Bob Edgar (D-Pa.) — called for an end
to all U.S. military assistance to the
Salvadoran junta. While the legisla
tors were introducing their resolu
tion in the House, demonstrators
outside protested Reagan's supplem
tal appropriation as well as his De
termination Number 82-4, certifying
that the junta had met congressional
human rights standards for receiving
military assistance.
At a similar level of American in
volvement in Vietnam, Congress was
far from leading any challenge to the
president or the Pentagon. Nor
would congressmen have met regu
larly, if at all, with so-called enemy
leaders, as Rep. Michael Barnes (D-
Md.) did or even visited the battle
zone, as several congressmen have.
The early dissent in Congress,
however, reflects as much sophisti
cation on the part of the American
public as on a few legislators. Ameri
cans tend to be far more skeptical of
presidential pronouncements, and
equally unwilling to be party to an
other Vietnam. Every major opinion
poll indicatesthata majority of Amer
icans opposes increased U.S. military
commitment to Central America.
This view has been spawned by
several factors. Segments of the

Catholic Church — which backed
U.S. involvement during much of the
Indochina war — have given
credence and visibility to con
gressmen and traditional peace
groups, documenting atrocities and
human rights violations by the Amer
ican-backed junta.
America's allies, moreover, aren't
as acquiescent as they were 15 years
ago. Groups, if not the adminis
trations in France, Mexico and West
Germany, have supported various

American reporters
and camera crews
also accompany
guerrilla contingents
now as a matter of
course, and splash
our television screens
with images of a
barbaric civil war.
These new forces of
cynicism have
captured the flag
from more traditional
anti-war groups in the
country.

anti-government factions in El
Salvador. Next to stories about re
pression in Poland, Reagan's support
for the oppressive regime in San
Salvador tends to dominate the for
eign news sections of the European
press. Not surprisingly, the U.S. is
often cast in an unfavorable light.
Meanwhile, the American press
has been far less susceptible to the
"official" line than it was during the
early stages of Vietnam. Whereas
only a "gladfly" journalist such as I.F.
Stone would document government
deception in 1967, even The Wall
Street Journal now stands ready to
criticize. Last spring, the business
oriented daily lambasted the State

Department's "White Paper" on
Salvador for overstating the case for
increased military aid to the junta.

crews also accompany guerrila cont
ingents now as a matter of course,
and splash our television screens

Until recently, the church and social
activist groups played the major in
formational role for Congress and
the press. Having coordinated rallies
with varying degrees of success last
year, they have been confused about
their future role.
"We've definitely entered a new
phase," said Robert Costa of the
Committee in Solidarity with the
People of El Salvador (CISPES). "Right
now, we're groping for answers on
how to approach it."
In the coming weeks, the adminis
tration's renewed commitment to
the Salvadoran junta is expected to

Civil Liberties Union and other or- •

Washington — President Ronald
Reagan's decision last week to pro
vide the U.S.-backed Salvadoran jun
ta with $55 million in "emergency"
military aid was a blunt reminder to
the Vietnam generation: some ad
ministrations aren't adverse to em
broiling America in another
quagmire on foreign soil.
Unlike the Johnson White House,
however, which lunged blindly intoa
deepening morass in Vietnam, the
Reagan administration can't act im
pulsively overseas without paying a
heavy price at home.
The world in 1982 is a far different
place from the world of Lyndon
Johnson, reflecting in part the bitter
ly-learned lessons transposed from
one era to another, it won't take sev
en years of domestic resistance to
change government policies, as was
the case in the Vietnam War.
This was evident on Jan. 26 when
three congressmen — Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.), Tom Harkin (D-lowa) and
Bob Edgar (D-Pa.) — called for an end
to all U.S. military assistance to the
Salvadoran junta. While the legisla
tors were introducing their resolu
tion in the House, demonstrators
outside protested Reagan's supplem
tal appropriation as well as his De
termination Number 82-4, certifying
that the junta had met congressional
human rights standards for receiving
military assistance.
At a similar level of American in
volvement in Vietnam, Congress was
far from leading any challenge to the
president or the Pentagon. Nor
would congressmen have met regu
larly, if at all, with so-called enemy
leaders, as Rep. Michael Barnes (D-
Md.) did or even visited the battle
zone, as several congressmen have.
The early dissent in Congress,
however, reflects as much sophisti
cation on the part of the American
public as on a few legislators. Ameri
cans tend to be far more skeptical of
presidential pronouncements, and
equally unwilling to be party to an
other Vietnam. Every major opinion
poll indicatesthata majority of Amer
icans opposes increased U.S. military
commitment to Central America.
This view has been spawned by
several factors. Segments of the

Catholic Church — which backed
U.S. involvement during much of the
Indochina war — have given
credence and visibility to con
gressmen and traditional peace
groups, documenting atrocities and
human rights violations by the Amer
ican-backed junta.
America's allies, moreover, aren't
as acquiescent as they were 15 years
ago. Groups, if not the adminis
trations in France, Mexico and West
Germany, have supported various

American reporters
and camera crews
also accompany
guerrilla contingents
now as a matter of
course, and splash
our television screens
with images of a
barbaric civil war.
These new forces of
cynicism have
captured the flag
from more traditional
anti-war groups in the
country.

anti-government factions in El
Salvador. Next to stories about re
pression in Poland, Reagan's support
for the oppressive regime in San
Salvador tends to dominate the for
eign news sections of the European
press. Not surprisingly, the U.S. is
often cast in an unfavorable light.
Meanwhile, the American press
has been far less susceptible to the
"official" line than it was during the
early stages of Vietnam. Whereas
only a "gladfly" journalist such as I.F.
Stone would document government
deception in 1967, even The Wall
Street Journal now stands ready to
criticize. Last spring, the business
oriented daily lambasted the State

Department's "White Paper" on
Salvador for overstating the case for
increased military aid to the junta.
American reporters and camera
crews also accompany guerrila cont
ingents now as a matter of course,
and splash our television screens
with images of a barbaric civil war.
These new forces of cynicism have
captured the flag from more tradi
tional anti-war groups in the country.
Until recently, the church and social
activist groups played the major in
formational role for Congress and
the press. Having coordinated rallies
with varying degrees of success last
year, they have been confused about
their future role.
