# University trustees speak at Branner

Asked what college class outside
his major had been most useful,
Warren Christopher grinned and
said, "typing!"
The deputy secretary of state dur
ing the Carter administration was
one of five members of the Board of
Trustees who appeared at an in
formal question-and-answer session
last night in the Branner Hall dining
room. The panel also included
Nelson Dong, assistant U.S. attorney;
Melvin Lane, president of Sunset
Magazine; Barbara Maxwell, at
torney with Grayson, Maxwell, &
Sugarman; and Frank Tatum Jr., also
an attorney and former president of
the United States Golf Association.
Residents of the all-freshmen
dorm asked questions about the
trustees' college experiences. Cited
among other useful classes outside
the trustees' majors were English,
writing and Western Civilization. Af
ter the groans had subsided, Maxwell
said, "Western Civilization hasstayed
with me the longest."
Addressing the effects academics
and extra-curricular activities had on
her, Maxwell said, "Stanford gave me
lots of options and choices I wouldn't
have had otherwise. I got the attitude
that anyone can do what he wants to

do. It gave me the confidence to
open my own law firm."
Christopher was asked if any col
lege courses he had taken helped in
negotiations for the release of the
American hostages held in Iran. He
replied that while law school pro
vided the professional tool, "I
thought I should bring to bear all that
had gone on in my life."
Responding to a request for ad
vice, Dong said, "This is an important
time to learn to be caring. It is all too
easy to forget other people all
around you who have problems from
time to time â€” for example, the ser
vice people here and people from
less fortunate backgrounds. You
must never lose sight of the fact that
they have rights and problems too. If
you develop that (being sensitive to
others) as a habit now it will serve you
the rest of your life and will reflect on
the whole society."
Christopher commented on one
freshman's lament about choosing a
major by quoting Supreme Court Jus
tice John Paul Stevens: "A wise man
does not try to hurry history."
One student questioned the Uni
versity's justification of construction
on campus in the face of rising tui
tion. Tatum said that the trustees do
not see building and tuition as a
trade-off.
