## Use care when alone 
### 
I read the "Rape is no accident"
article (Daily, Feb. 2) in which Alice
said she was grateful that the rape
crisis people she met with didn't ask
her what she was doing out by the
stadium by herself. She also com
mented that "the last thing you need
to hear is that you were stupid." That
afternoon I saw two different wom
en, within an hourof each other, jog
ging by themselves into the wooded
area on the northwest side of Galvez
Street across from the stadium.
During the afternoon, I noticed
several instances when no one rode
(on the bike path) or walked through
the area for 10 to 15 minutes. Correct
me if I'm wrong, but weren't all of the
previous assaults in the last six
months at Stanford on women who
were alone in some remote, isolated,
or deserted area of the campus?
I mentioned the Daily article be
cause of the term "stupid" applied to
rape victims. Are they stupid? Per
haps stupid is a bit of a harsh word (I
I'd rather use naive), but the
answer is no, not any more. In fact,
Alice and Beth are probably two of
the smartest women on campus now,
and I hope that all women can learn
from their experiences.
Are the two women I saw jogging
alone Tuesday naive? Yes, I think so.
Many people consider rape to be a
serious problem (right!) with a com
plicated solution (wrong!). As I have
already said, I seem to remember that
the common denominator of all the

recent assaults was that the victims
were alone. Think about it — the
rapist (if there isonlyone) hasonlyat
tacked women moving about by
themselves. What is the solution?
Women, don't go around by your
selves. Obviously, places such as
White Plaza at noon can be excluded
from this solution.
This solution, however simple, can
be difficult to implement. I was told
by a female friend that many women
would not easily accept this solution
because it inhibits their freedom and
independence. This is absolutely
true! Then again, I would think most
women would rather have their in
dependence inhibited somewhat
than to be raped or assaulted.
Another possible problem with the
successful implementation of this
solution is that many women may not
consider some places on the campus
remote, isolated, or deserted enough
to warrant going with an escort. Read
last Tuesday's article and you will re
alize that Tresidder and the stadium
were deserted enough in Alice's and
Beth's cases.
I think it's time for the naive wom
en on this campus to realize that
however unfair it is to have one's
freedom inhibited byone"bad guy,"
it is a reality that the problem exists,
and it is incredibly simple to avoid
becoming a victim: don't go alone.
