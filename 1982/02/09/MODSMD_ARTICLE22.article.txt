## Truth soars but Walker stumbles 
### Karl Kapper Stamp Corbin 
Ain't I a Woman? and
Can I Speak for You, Brother?
The Nitery
6 February 1982
Those people lucky enough to have got
ten into the Nitery Saturday night saw one
play which soared with emotion and another
which tried, but died in the attempt. The
plays, produced by the African American
Drama Company, were both attempts to
show the past, present, and future struggle
of black people for equality in the United
States.
The first play, Ain't I A Woman?, a one
woman play about Sojourner Truth, the
black freedom fighter, was a remarkably
well-done production. Written and per
formed by Charmaine Crowell, it was a com
bination of material taken from the original
writings and speeches of Truth and material
by Crowell.
Using minimal lighting and sets, the play
managed to create the impression that one
was seeing actual scenes from the life of So
journer Truth. By innovatively using a few
strategically placed props, the scenes flowed
smoothly into one another simply by
Crowell's stage movement.
Crowell's acting was good throughout the
play. Her shifts in characterization from
young child to slave to free woman were

smooth and believable. At no time did her
characterizations ring false.
"Ain't I A Woman" also dealt with Truth's
efforts in the early women's movement,
thereby touching upon the potential al
liance of oppressed groups to obtain equal
ity.
The incorporation of music into the play
was also well-done. Crowell sang as an ex
tension of the play, rather than a conscious
attempt to deliver a message to the au
dience.
Though the play was uniformly well writ
ten, some parts stood out as excellent, par
ticularly the scene in which Sojourner Truth
finds religion. At times the monologue here
approached prose poetry and regardless of
one's beliefs, it would have been hard to be
unmoved.
When reviewing minority plays, a critic
with any kind of social awareness may be
torn between going easy on a mediocre play,
or telling the truth. A harsh review could re
duce the number of attempts to portray the
minority subculture in the theater. Can I
Speak For You Brother?, a one-man show
depicting black leaders, exemplifies this
dilemma. But as the saying goes — the truth
will set you free — and the truth must be told
about the second play.
The concept is a good one that could have
made for a thoroughly enjoyable and in

teresting play. As executed Saturday night,
though, the play amounted to nothing more
than a lot of heart with a hollow center.
For one thing, the writing never went
beyond the mediocre. This is one play that
needs to be rethought and subjected to
much rewriting. The scene between
Malcolm X and a heroin junkie had the
potential to be poignant, unfortunately, the
scene lacked the energy necessary to carry it
off.
The acting in Can I Speak For You Brother?
was also mediocre. Phillip Walker, a per
former trained in mime, was not able to
portray the complex and multiple character
izations in the play effectively. His acting was
much too broad, and degenerated into two
kinds of characterization. In the lighter
scenes, his actions were caricatures and
brought to mind the comic Jimmy Walker. In
the more serious scenes, his tone was too af
fected and unchanging.
In particular, the last two scenes were the
most disappointing. The first which was
Walker's portrayal of Martin Luther King giv
ing his "I Have A Dream" speech had none
of the fervor and emotion that one would
expect. Granted this speech could hardly
have the same impact as the original, but
Walker's rendition of the speech left the au
dience feeling cold and unmoved.
The last scene, a portrayal of the Pan-

Afrikanist Akid, lacked emotion too. Akid's
indictment of the bourgeois mentality of
many blacks should have had many people
in the audience squirming in their seats. In
stead, most of the audience sat passively.

Despite the shortcomings of the second
play, the Black Performing Arts Committee
and the Black Community Services Center
should be commended for bringing to Stan
ford an enjoyable evening of black theater.

than a lot of heart with a hollow center.
For one thing, the writing never went
beyond the mediocre. This is one play that
needs to be rethought and subjected to
much rewriting. The scene between
Malcolm X and a heroin junkie had the
potential to be poignant, unfortunately, the
scene lacked the energy necessary to carry it
off.
The acting in Can I Speak For You Brother?
was also mediocre. Phillip Walker, a per
former trained in mime, was not able to
portray the complex and multiple character
izations in the play effectively. His acting was
much too broad, and degenerated into two
kinds of characterization. In the lighter
scenes, his actions were caricatures and
brought to mind the comic Jimmy Walker. In
the more serious scenes, his tone was too af
fected and unchanging.
In particular, the last two scenes were the
most disappointing. The first which was
Walker's portrayal of Martin Luther King giv
ing his "I Have A Dream" speech had none
of the fervor and emotion that one would
expect. Granted this speech could hardly
have the same impact as the original, but
Walker's rendition of the speech left the au
dience feeling cold and unmoved.
The last scene, a portrayal of the Pan-

Afrikanist Akid, lacked emotion too. Akid's
indictment of the bourgeois mentality of
many blacks should have had many people
in the audience squirming in their seats. In
stead, most of the audience sat passively.

Despite the shortcomings of the second
play, the Black Performing Arts Committee
and the Black Community Services Center
should be commended for bringing to Stan
ford an enjoyable evening of black theater.

Can I Speak for You, Brother?
The Nitery
6 February 1982
Those people lucky enough to have got
ten into the Nitery Saturday night saw one
play which soared with emotion and another
which tried, but died in the attempt. The
plays, produced by the African American
Drama Company, were both attempts to
show the past, present, and future struggle
of black people for equality in the United
States.
The first play, Ain't I A Woman?, a one
woman play about Sojourner Truth, the
black freedom fighter, was a remarkably
well-done production. Written and per
formed by Charmaine Crowell, it was a com
bination of material taken from the original
writings and speeches of Truth and material
by Crowell.
Using minimal lighting and sets, the play
managed to create the impression that one
was seeing actual scenes from the life of So
journer Truth. By innovatively using a few
strategically placed props, the scenes flowed
smoothly into one another simply by
Crowell's stage movement.
Crowell's acting was good throughout the
play. Her shifts in characterization from
young child to slave to free woman were

smooth and believable. At no time did her
characterizations ring false.
"Ain't I A Woman" also dealt with Truth's
efforts in the early women's movement,
thereby touching upon the potential al
liance of oppressed groups to obtain equal
ity.
The incorporation of music into the play
was also well-done. Crowell sang as an ex
tension of the play, rather than a conscious
attempt to deliver a message to the au
dience.
Though the play was uniformly well writ
ten, some parts stood out as excellent, par
ticularly the scene in which Sojourner Truth
finds religion. At times the monologue here
approached prose poetry and regardless of
one's beliefs, it would have been hard to be
unmoved.
When reviewing minority plays, a critic
with any kind of social awareness may be
torn between going easy on a mediocre play,
or telling the truth. A harsh review could re
duce the number of attempts to portray the
minority subculture in the theater. Can I
Speak For You Brother?, a one-man show
depicting black leaders, exemplifies this
dilemma. But as the saying goes — the truth
will set you free — and the truth must be told
about the second play.
The concept is a good one that could have
made for a thoroughly enjoyable and in

teresting play. As executed Saturday night,
though, the play amounted to nothing more
than a lot of heart with a hollow center.
For one thing, the writing never went
beyond the mediocre. This is one play that
needs to be rethought and subjected to
much rewriting. The scene between
Malcolm X and a heroin junkie had the
potential to be poignant, unfortunately, the
scene lacked the energy necessary to carry it
off.
