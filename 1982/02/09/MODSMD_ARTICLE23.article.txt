# Lar Lubovitch's new dimensions of beauty
## 
### Cory Foster 
Lar Lubovitch knows beauty. To say what makes his
dance beautiful will involve me in a philosophical
argument on aesthetics; a dispute for which there is
no resolution. Rather, let me state it simply, as a fact,
that the audience will leave a concert of the Lar
Lubovitch Company having experienced beauty.
Imagine each of your limbs being stretched away
from your torso in some direction, maybe with one
leg bent. It is a stretch that feels good and you know
that it looks good because it creates clean lines in in
teresting patterns. Now imagine moving that shape. It
twirls, spins, and leaps. It never loses the clarity of de
sign. Suddenly, something that before just felt good,
now goes through new dimensions. Lar Lubovitch's
dancers take their bodies through all these
dimensions, and take the audience to new realms of
perceiving dance.

Not only was each dance a feat of virtuosity and
grace, but the arrangement of the program had an
elegance to it. The first and last pieces, North Star and
Calvacade, were signature dances: pure movement
focusing on the music and its quality. Costumes were
simple and of solid colors so as not to detract form
from the design of the dance. (I have seen North Star
done in even plainer costumes, minus the tunics seen
in Sunday's performance, and I liked it even better.)
Beau Danube showed that Lar also has a sense of hu
mor. It was done in klutzy, oversized leotards of
bright colors. The choreography played on the notion
of rivers, swimming, fish, and other Danube images. It
played as well on the dramatic dynamics of the Blue
Danube by Johann Strauss.
One of the nicest things about Lar Lubovitch's
choreography is that it uses all the dancers equally.
Where many companies make use of the typical roles

of men and women, and some companies spotlight
certain dancers, Lar's dancers all are very capable and
good. His dances star no one, rather they demand the
most from everyone's ability. Beau Danube was cast
for either three men and one woman, or for two men
and two women. Les Noces might have easily slipped
into a dance where the menfolk looked husky and
strong, and the women radiant and submissive. For
tunately for us, this dance emphasized the internal
nature of characters while it did not hide the fact that
men and women participated. In the other pieces, ev
eryone figured in all the movement.
Beauty is not the only requirement foraestheticen
joyment, but it is one of the most pleasing. If you
haven't seen the Lar Lubovitch Company, I think I can
safely say without demeaning the concept that you
have missed an experience of the essence of beauty.
