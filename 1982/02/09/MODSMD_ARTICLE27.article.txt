# The 						Godfather brings funk and Ella sends true jazz

Keystone/Palo Alto
28 January 1982
The Godfather sits in his
dressing room beyond the long
bar behind which tenders
squirt toxic scotch, bourbon,
and gin into the glasses of the
unencumbered, the loose, the
free people who have just fin
ished giving it up for an hour
on the dance floor to the ori
ginal disco man.
"I've been listening to him
ever since I discovered he was a
sex machine," shouts Ossi
Chapman, who has been a
James Brown fan since she was
a kid in Houston and he a
younger and stronger man.
The speakers crunch a steady
funk beat as the chosen few
who remain from the first set
talk about James Brown the re
deemer, the transformer, the
blessed.
Brown is the only manonthe
planet who can with no
trepidation sing: "It's Hell
down here and we've got to get
a job, In the ghetto it's Hell, In
the White House it's Hell. It's
Hell down here, and we've got
to make a change," and at the
same time openly proclaim
that Ronald Reagan is his
"main cowboy."
Outside the Keystone the
well-dressed, the natty, the stiff,
and the funky, wait in line for
the late show doors to open.
The people smoke and sway,
waiting to see the self-pro
claimed, "hardest working
man in show business," shake
and drop to the floor, defying
age, wisdom, and a stage slick
with sweat to "turn out the
lights and call lord."
He is the funk.
"The man's a legend. He's
like Elvis," says one young man
whose older brother told him
that if he missed the show he
would be a certified fool.
Four of the most unfunky
looking punks in existence
swagger towards the crowd
from the darkness of the alley
looking puzzled, seemingly
obliterated by downs and alco
hol. The most bold punk, the
one with multicolored hairand
a knotty little face, fingers his
black Macy's punk jacket
stained with the words"Punk's
not dead," and slurrs "excuse
me, dya know what time it is?
Excuse me, dya know what
time it is?" repeatedly to any
one who will listen.
After the 15th slur or so, the
punk begins to display a beat, a
little sense of what the God
father would call "redneck
funk," and someone finally
shows him a watch. The punk is
too high to read, and just keeps
tapping his feet to the muted
beat emanating from the club.
The doors open, and the
crowd shoves its way past the
harrassed gatement towards
the soul sanctum, leaving the
punk lost in space and time.
The warm up band, Gwank
Movement, takes the stage
with all 13 band members
dressed like stars. The musi
cians take their places behind
trumpets, guitars, a syn
thesizer, a trap set, congas, and
a trombone.
Two female vocalists in red

spandex pants and sparkling
mirrored tube tops that reflect
the stage lights, stand coun
terpoint to the lead male vocal
ist who stands tall in a hushed
brown suede suit.
The band breaks into a tight
rendition of Prince's "Let's
Work," and the dancers shake
the floor, thrusting their hands
upward to the chorus. "Let's
work," shout the horn players
in unison, setting the brass
aside.
Where is Mr. Brown?
Clarence Jacks wants to hear
"Please, Please, Please," which
was the Godfather's first hit
song. Jacks first saw Brown in
1950 when the King was ascen
ding the throne. A ticket was
$2 then, and it is $9.50 now, but
that doesn't stop Jacks.
"James Brown, bring on the
man" somebody in the crowd
shouts.
The James Brown review
moves on the stage positioning
horns and turning up amps.
Brown's announcer takes cen
ter stage in his smooth off
white suit as the band beginsits
circus revelry. The James
Brown staccatto soul horn
show begins.
"... from the Middle East,"
barks the announcer like a hip
Don Pardo.
"From Europe, the United
States, South America . . . wel
come to the James Brown
show."
The audience goes wild as
the band starts the boasting re
frain, "We are the funky men,
we are the funky kings." Two
trumpets, two saxophones, and
one flugelhorn accompany the
chant with the opening riffs to
Brown's classic, "Poppa don't
take no mess."
The keyboard player stands

behind an electric piano that
has been inlayed with fake
jewels that read, "The God
father."
The dance floor is packed,
and the King hasn't even ap
peared. A spotlight flashes
across the crowd making the
audience tense with antici
pation.
"Are you ready for James
Brown?" shouts the announc
er.
"Bring him, bring on the
Godfather," four people at a
table beg. The audience is too
quiet.
"I must have caught you off
guard. I said, are you ready for
James Brown?" intones the an
nouncing, provoking chants,
handclaps, and jeers from the
audience. -"I'll give you one
more chance. Are you ready
for the living legend of James
Brown?" teases the announcer
like a soulful Barnum.
"J. 8., J. 8., J. 8.," chants the
audience as the legend jumps
onto center stage looking slick
in his dark peach-colored suit
that could have been a gift
from the Liberace museum.
He looks good, not like a
faded old man. Though they
began their careers at the same
time, Brown shows no signs of
the wretched excess that
plagued Elvis Presley.
And this king can still sing.
Brown pounds through the set
like a demented man being
chased by the devil towards
heaven, in cadence with the
world's heartbeat.
His music is basic and driv
ing, and his band is hot. Brown
keeps close reign on his
players, fining the drummer
$10 each time he misses a
backbeat, which is rare, and
keeping the musicians off
drugs.

His notion of funk as truth
felt by the good and righteous
is evident in his songs that tell
the faithful to stay clean yet
tough, and to never back down
when those in power try to cut
the funk short.
The heavy beat and author
itative voice in most of the
Godfather's songs is powerful
on records, and overwhelming
in a live performance. The dan
cers at the Keystone seem
possessed by the Godfather's
message througnout the set,
but especially during "Too
funky."
The band is tighter than the
Godfather's sequined jumpsuit
as they follow the leader, slow
ing down and then picking up
the best with hypnotic fervor as
the King moves into "It's a
Man's World," his anthem for
love.
Brown looks as though the
burden of all men is on his
shoulders when he drops his
head, the rough, long, proc
essed locks hanging around
the microphone, and moans
"It's a man's world, but it
would be nothing, nothing . . .
without the woman I love."
The lights dim and the spot is
on the Godfather as he dedi
cates the song to Elvis Presley,
Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Bob
Marley, John Lennon, and Jimi
Hendrix. They are dead, and
Brown is convincing the au
dience that he is very much
alive.
Brown breaks into "Please,
Please, Please," as hisattendant
places a long, powder blue, fur
trimmed cape over the King's
shoulders. He is on the floor
singing, wrapping the au
dience in his soul. The show is
over.

A frequently repeated cliche about jazz
singers asserts that "they use their voices like an
instrument." But on hearing a first rate jazz vo
calist one can only reply that surely no instru
ment ever sounded this good. If anything the
opposite is true: the best jazz instrumentalists try
to emulate the human voice.
How else can one explain the curious attrac
tion to vocal music envinced by some of jazz's
most famous practitioners: Lester Young, the
seminal saxophonist of the swing era claimed
that in his spare hours he listened to virtually no
jazz, but only to vocalists; Charlie Parker, ac
cording to a recent interview with his widow
Chan, would wander around the house singing
over and over again the banal lyrics to some
now-forgotten pop song; Dexter Gordon, per
haps the most celebrated of living tenor sax
ophonists, prefaces each of his ballad per
formances with a recitation of some of the song's
lyrics.

Yet if jazz singing is some sort of touchstone
for the rest of the art form, one can only lament
how few true jazz singers there are. That essen
tial element of jazz — improvisation — is often
totally lacking in the performances of many so
called jazz singers; rather their performances
are duplicates of one another, and while the mu
sic may be "jazzy," it definitely is not jazz.
Ella Fitzgerald is quite obviously not that kind
of jazz singer. Her performances are so rich in
improvisational vitality that the listener often
begs for more of a repeated melody, not less of
one. Along with Sarah Vaughn, Ella reignsasthe
queen of the Baroque in jazz singing. The notes
come thick and fast and the syllables are often
stretched over inordinate lengths of time. In an
Ella Fitzgerald performance, a simple word like
"love" is likely to become "luh-hu-huh-hoo
huh-huvvvvvah." At their most gratuitous these
never-ending coloraturas can be painfully an
noying, but more often than one might expect
Ella is able to invest her lyrics with striking ori
ginality and enthusiasm.
More than two decades ago Ella recorded a
number of songbooks featuring the music of
noteworthy American song writers. The George
Gershwin Songbook, the Cole Porter Songbook,

the Rodgers and Hart Songbook, and others like
them were both attractive showcases for Ella's
talents, and also among the most commercially
successful of her albums. The Antonio Carlos
Jobim Songbook is a new edition to this series,
and in many ways is strikingly different from the
earlier discs. Most notable is the fact that Jobim,
the remarkably talented Brazilian songwriter,
forges tunes that are often only tangentially re
lated to the American popular song tradition.
Despite this, his songs have long been popular
among jazz musicians, Ella herself having rec
orded a number of them in the past.
Yet these are first and foremost Brazilian
songs, and the English translations of theoriginal
Portugese lyrics are often clumsy and inade
quate. Ella attempts to sing a few of the numbers
in their original form, but on the whole the lis
tener is given little idea of what these pieces
were meant to sound like. What emerges on the
album is Ella Fitzgerald, and not Antonio Carlos
Jobim.
But it is very good Ella Fitzgeraldthat the lis
tener hears. Partially this is due to the superior
musicians she has supporting her. A largely
South American rhythm section is augmented
with guitarist Joe Pass, trupeter Clark Terry, sax
ophonist Zoot Sims and harmonica virtuoso

Toots Thielemans. The latter in particular must
be credited with taking what is perhaps the most
recalcitrant wind instrument and drawing from
it the most euphonious of sounds.
If Ella's singing is a Gothic Cathedral, Abbey
Lincoln's is an austere chapel. Simplicity and
purity are the virtues to be found here, and the
resulting album is no less forceful than Ella's. On
"Throw it Away" Lincoln takes the simplest of
melodies, almost childlike in its repetitiveness,
and draws from it a powerful gospel feeling.
Assisting her is tenor saxophonist Archie
Shepp who appears to be increasingly neglectful
of his reputation as an avant garde musician. On
recent discs Shepp has been quite successful in
returning to a mainstream style of playing, and
this album is no exception.
Lincoln's singing displays an analytical ten
dency to break songs down into the constituent
parts. Often she will take songsat unusually slow
tempos, almost lingering sensuously over each
beat. On a suitable piece, such as Ellington's
"Sophisticated Lady" this can be quite effective,
but on the title cut, Stevie Wonder's "Golden
Lady," the tempo positively drags. Yet on the
whole, Lincoln's album is one of her best and
will hopefully increase the following of this
much neglected artist.

chased by the devil towards
heaven, in cadence with the
world's heartbeat.
His music is basic and driv
ing, and his band is hot. Brown
keeps close reign on his
players, fining the drummer
$10 each time he misses a
backbeat, which is rare, and
keeping the musicians off
drugs.

His notion of funk as truth
felt by the good and righteous
is evident in his songs that tell
the faithful to stay clean yet
tough, and to never back down
when those in power try to cut
the funk short.
The heavy beat and author
itative voice in most of the
Godfather's songs is powerful
on records, and overwhelming
in a live performance. The dan
cers at the Keystone seem
possessed by the Godfather's
message througnout the set,
but especially during "Too
funky."
The band is tighter than the
Godfather's sequined jumpsuit
as they follow the leader, slow
ing down and then picking up
the best with hypnotic fervor as
the King moves into "It's a
Man's World," his anthem for
love.
Brown looks as though the
burden of all men is on his
shoulders when he drops his
head, the rough, long, proc
essed locks hanging around
the microphone, and moans
"It's a man's world, but it
would be nothing, nothing . . .
without the woman I love."
The lights dim and the spot is
on the Godfather as he dedi
cates the song to Elvis Presley,
Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Bob
Marley, John Lennon, and Jimi
Hendrix. They are dead, and
Brown is convincing the au
dience that he is very much
alive.
Brown breaks into "Please,
Please, Please," as hisattendant
places a long, powder blue, fur
trimmed cape over the King's
shoulders. He is on the floor
singing, wrapping the au
dience in his soul. The show is
over.

A frequently repeated cliche about jazz
singers asserts that "they use their voices like an
instrument." But on hearing a first rate jazz vo
calist one can only reply that surely no instru
ment ever sounded this good. If anything the
opposite is true: the best jazz instrumentalists try
to emulate the human voice.
How else can one explain the curious attrac
tion to vocal music envinced by some of jazz's
most famous practitioners: Lester Young, the
seminal saxophonist of the swing era claimed
that in his spare hours he listened to virtually no
jazz, but only to vocalists; Charlie Parker, ac
cording to a recent interview with his widow
Chan, would wander around the house singing
over and over again the banal lyrics to some
now-forgotten pop song; Dexter Gordon, per
haps the most celebrated of living tenor sax
ophonists, prefaces each of his ballad per
formances with a recitation of some of the song's
lyrics.

Yet if jazz singing is some sort of touchstone
for the rest of the art form, one can only lament
how few true jazz singers there are. That essen
tial element of jazz — improvisation — is often
totally lacking in the performances of many so
called jazz singers; rather their performances
are duplicates of one another, and while the mu
sic may be "jazzy," it definitely is not jazz.
Ella Fitzgerald is quite obviously not that kind
of jazz singer. Her performances are so rich in
improvisational vitality that the listener often
begs for more of a repeated melody, not less of
one. Along with Sarah Vaughn, Ella reignsasthe
queen of the Baroque in jazz singing. The notes
come thick and fast and the syllables are often
stretched over inordinate lengths of time. In an
Ella Fitzgerald performance, a simple word like
"love" is likely to become "luh-hu-huh-hoo
huh-huvvvvvah." At their most gratuitous these
never-ending coloraturas can be painfully an
noying, but more often than one might expect
Ella is able to invest her lyrics with striking ori
ginality and enthusiasm.
More than two decades ago Ella recorded a
number of songbooks featuring the music of
noteworthy American song writers. The George
Gershwin Songbook, the Cole Porter Songbook,

the Rodgers and Hart Songbook, and others like
them were both attractive showcases for Ella's
talents, and also among the most commercially
successful of her albums. The Antonio Carlos
Jobim Songbook is a new edition to this series,
and in many ways is strikingly different from the
earlier discs. Most notable is the fact that Jobim,
the remarkably talented Brazilian songwriter,
forges tunes that are often only tangentially re
lated to the American popular song tradition.
Despite this, his songs have long been popular
among jazz musicians, Ella herself having rec
orded a number of them in the past.
Yet these are first and foremost Brazilian
songs, and the English translations of theoriginal
Portugese lyrics are often clumsy and inade
quate. Ella attempts to sing a few of the numbers
in their original form, but on the whole the lis
tener is given little idea of what these pieces
were meant to sound like. What emerges on the
album is Ella Fitzgerald, and not Antonio Carlos
Jobim.
But it is very good Ella Fitzgeraldthat the lis
tener hears. Partially this is due to the superior
musicians she has supporting her. A largely
South American rhythm section is augmented
with guitarist Joe Pass, trupeter Clark Terry, sax
ophonist Zoot Sims and harmonica virtuoso

Toots Thielemans. The latter in particular must
be credited with taking what is perhaps the most
recalcitrant wind instrument and drawing from
it the most euphonious of sounds.
If Ella's singing is a Gothic Cathedral, Abbey
Lincoln's is an austere chapel. Simplicity and
purity are the virtues to be found here, and the
resulting album is no less forceful than Ella's. On
"Throw it Away" Lincoln takes the simplest of
melodies, almost childlike in its repetitiveness,
and draws from it a powerful gospel feeling.
Assisting her is tenor saxophonist Archie
Shepp who appears to be increasingly neglectful
of his reputation as an avant garde musician. On
recent discs Shepp has been quite successful in
returning to a mainstream style of playing, and
this album is no exception.
Lincoln's singing displays an analytical ten
dency to break songs down into the constituent
parts. Often she will take songsat unusually slow
tempos, almost lingering sensuously over each
beat. On a suitable piece, such as Ellington's
"Sophisticated Lady" this can be quite effective,
but on the title cut, Stevie Wonder's "Golden
Lady," the tempo positively drags. Yet on the
whole, Lincoln's album is one of her best and
will hopefully increase the following of this
much neglected artist.



Ella Fitzgerald
James Brown
Keystone/Palo Alto
28 January 1982
The Godfather sits in his
dressing room beyond the long
bar behind which tenders
squirt toxic scotch, bourbon,
and gin into the glasses of the
unencumbered, the loose, the
free people who have just fin
ished giving it up for an hour
on the dance floor to the ori
ginal disco man.
"I've been listening to him
ever since I discovered he was a
sex machine," shouts Ossi
Chapman, who has been a
James Brown fan since she was
a kid in Houston and he a
younger and stronger man.
The speakers crunch a steady
funk beat as the chosen few
who remain from the first set
talk about James Brown the re
deemer, the transformer, the
blessed.
Brown is the only manonthe
planet who can with no
trepidation sing: "It's Hell
down here and we've got to get
a job, In the ghetto it's Hell, In
the White House it's Hell. It's
Hell down here, and we've got
to make a change," and at the
same time openly proclaim
that Ronald Reagan is his
"main cowboy."
Outside the Keystone the
well-dressed, the natty, the stiff,
and the funky, wait in line for
the late show doors to open.
The people smoke and sway,
waiting to see the self-pro
claimed, "hardest working
man in show business," shake
and drop to the floor, defying
age, wisdom, and a stage slick
with sweat to "turn out the
lights and call lord."
He is the funk.
"The man's a legend. He's
like Elvis," says one young man
whose older brother told him
that if he missed the show he
would be a certified fool.
Four of the most unfunky
looking punks in existence
swagger towards the crowd
from the darkness of the alley
looking puzzled, seemingly
obliterated by downs and alco
hol. The most bold punk, the
one with multicolored hairand
a knotty little face, fingers his
black Macy's punk jacket
stained with the words"Punk's
not dead," and slurrs "excuse
me, dya know what time it is?
Excuse me, dya know what
time it is?" repeatedly to any
one who will listen.
After the 15th slur or so, the
punk begins to display a beat, a
little sense of what the God
father would call "redneck
funk," and someone finally
shows him a watch. The punk is
too high to read, and just keeps
tapping his feet to the muted
beat emanating from the club.
The doors open, and the
crowd shoves its way past the
harrassed gatement towards
the soul sanctum, leaving the
punk lost in space and time.
The warm up band, Gwank
Movement, takes the stage
with all 13 band members
dressed like stars. The musi
cians take their places behind
trumpets, guitars, a syn
thesizer, a trap set, congas, and
a trombone.
Two female vocalists in red

spandex pants and sparkling
mirrored tube tops that reflect
the stage lights, stand coun
terpoint to the lead male vocal
ist who stands tall in a hushed
brown suede suit.
The band breaks into a tight
rendition of Prince's "Let's
Work," and the dancers shake
the floor, thrusting their hands
upward to the chorus. "Let's
work," shout the horn players
in unison, setting the brass
aside.
Where is Mr. Brown?
Clarence Jacks wants to hear
"Please, Please, Please," which
was the Godfather's first hit
song. Jacks first saw Brown in
1950 when the King was ascen
ding the throne. A ticket was
$2 then, and it is $9.50 now, but
that doesn't stop Jacks.
"James Brown, bring on the
man" somebody in the crowd
shouts.
The James Brown review
moves on the stage positioning
horns and turning up amps.
Brown's announcer takes cen
ter stage in his smooth off
white suit as the band beginsits
circus revelry. The James
Brown staccatto soul horn
show begins.
"... from the Middle East,"
barks the announcer like a hip
Don Pardo.
"From Europe, the United
States, South America . . . wel
come to the James Brown
show."
The audience goes wild as
the band starts the boasting re
frain, "We are the funky men,
we are the funky kings." Two
trumpets, two saxophones, and
one flugelhorn accompany the
chant with the opening riffs to
Brown's classic, "Poppa don't
take no mess."
The keyboard player stands

behind an electric piano that
has been inlayed with fake
jewels that read, "The God
father."
The dance floor is packed,
and the King hasn't even ap
peared. A spotlight flashes
across the crowd making the
audience tense with antici
pation.
"Are you ready for James
Brown?" shouts the announc
er.
"Bring him, bring on the
Godfather," four people at a
table beg. The audience is too
quiet.
"I must have caught you off
guard. I said, are you ready for
James Brown?" intones the an
nouncing, provoking chants,
handclaps, and jeers from the
audience. -"I'll give you one
more chance. Are you ready
for the living legend of James
Brown?" teases the announcer
like a soulful Barnum.
"J. 8., J. 8., J. 8.," chants the
audience as the legend jumps
onto center stage looking slick
in his dark peach-colored suit
that could have been a gift
from the Liberace museum.
He looks good, not like a
faded old man. Though they
began their careers at the same
time, Brown shows no signs of
the wretched excess that
plagued Elvis Presley.
And this king can still sing.
Brown pounds through the set
like a demented man being
chased by the devil towards
heaven, in cadence with the
world's heartbeat.
His music is basic and driv
ing, and his band is hot. Brown
keeps close reign on his
players, fining the drummer
$10 each time he misses a

this album is no exception.
Lincoln's singing displays an analytical ten
dency to break songs down into the constituent
parts. Often she will take songsat unusually slow
tempos, almost lingering sensuously over each
beat. On a suitable piece, such as Ellington's
"Sophisticated Lady" this can be quite effective,
but on the title cut, Stevie Wonder's "Golden
Lady," the tempo positively drags. Yet on the
whole, Lincoln's album is one of her best and
will hopefully increase the following of this
much neglected artist.



Ella Fitzgerald
James Brown
Keystone/Palo Alto
28 January 1982
The Godfather sits in his
dressing room beyond the long
bar behind which tenders
squirt toxic scotch, bourbon,
and gin into the glasses of the
unencumbered, the loose, the
free people who have just fin
ished giving it up for an hour
on the dance floor to the ori
ginal disco man.
"I've been listening to him
ever since I discovered he was a
sex machine," shouts Ossi
Chapman, who has been a
James Brown fan since she was
a kid in Houston and he a
younger and stronger man.
The speakers crunch a steady
funk beat as the chosen few
who remain from the first set
talk about James Brown the re
deemer, the transformer, the
blessed.
Brown is the only manonthe
planet who can with no
trepidation sing: "It's Hell
down here and we've got to get
a job, In the ghetto it's Hell, In
the White House it's Hell. It's
Hell down here, and we've got
to make a change," and at the
same time openly proclaim
that Ronald Reagan is his
"main cowboy."
Outside the Keystone the
well-dressed, the natty, the stiff,
and the funky, wait in line for
the late show doors to open.
The people smoke and sway,
waiting to see the self-pro
claimed, "hardest working
man in show business," shake
and drop to the floor, defying
age, wisdom, and a stage slick
with sweat to "turn out the
lights and call lord."
He is the funk.
"The man's a legend. He's
like Elvis," says one young man
whose older brother told him
that if he missed the show he
would be a certified fool.
Four of the most unfunky
looking punks in existence
swagger towards the crowd
from the darkness of the alley
looking puzzled, seemingly
obliterated by downs and alco
hol. The most bold punk, the
one with multicolored hairand
a knotty little face, fingers his
black Macy's punk jacket
stained with the words"Punk's
not dead," and slurrs "excuse
me, dya know what time it is?
Excuse me, dya know what
time it is?" repeatedly to any
one who will listen.
After the 15th slur or so, the
punk begins to display a beat, a
little sense of what the God
father would call "redneck
funk," and someone finally
shows him a watch. The punk is
too high to read, and just keeps
tapping his feet to the muted
beat emanating from the club.
The doors open, and the
crowd shoves its way past the
harrassed gatement towards
the soul sanctum, leaving the
punk lost in space and time.
The warm up band, Gwank
Movement, takes the stage
with all 13 band members
dressed like stars. The musi
cians take their places behind
trumpets, guitars, a syn
thesizer, a trap set, congas, and
a trombone.
Two female vocalists in red

spandex pants and sparkling
mirrored tube tops that reflect
the stage lights, stand coun
terpoint to the lead male vocal
ist who stands tall in a hushed
brown suede suit.
The band breaks into a tight
rendition of Prince's "Let's
Work," and the dancers shake
the floor, thrusting their hands
upward to the chorus. "Let's
work," shout the horn players
in unison, setting the brass
aside.
Where is Mr. Brown?
Clarence Jacks wants to hear
"Please, Please, Please," which
was the Godfather's first hit
song. Jacks first saw Brown in
1950 when the King was ascen
ding the throne. A ticket was
$2 then, and it is $9.50 now, but
that doesn't stop Jacks.
"James Brown, bring on the
man" somebody in the crowd
shouts.
The James Brown review
moves on the stage positioning
horns and turning up amps.
Brown's announcer takes cen
ter stage in his smooth off
white suit as the band beginsits
circus revelry. The James
Brown staccatto soul horn
show begins.
"... from the Middle East,"
barks the announcer like a hip
Don Pardo.
"From Europe, the United
States, South America . . . wel
come to the James Brown
show."
The audience goes wild as
the band starts the boasting re
frain, "We are the funky men,
we are the funky kings." Two
trumpets, two saxophones, and
one flugelhorn accompany the
chant with the opening riffs to
Brown's classic, "Poppa don't
take no mess."
The keyboard player stands

behind an electric piano that
has been inlayed with fake
jewels that read, "The God
father."
The dance floor is packed,
and the King hasn't even ap
peared. A spotlight flashes
across the crowd making the
audience tense with antici
pation.
"Are you ready for James
Brown?" shouts the announc
er.
"Bring him, bring on the
Godfather," four people at a
table beg. The audience is too
quiet.
"I must have caught you off
guard. I said, are you ready for
James Brown?" intones the an
nouncing, provoking chants,
handclaps, and jeers from the
audience. -"I'll give you one
more chance. Are you ready
for the living legend of James
Brown?" teases the announcer
like a soulful Barnum.
"J. 8., J. 8., J. 8.," chants the
audience as the legend jumps
onto center stage looking slick
in his dark peach-colored suit
that could have been a gift
from the Liberace museum.
He looks good, not like a
faded old man. Though they
began their careers at the same
time, Brown shows no signs of
the wretched excess that
plagued Elvis Presley.
And this king can still sing.
Brown pounds through the set
like a demented man being
chased by the devil towards
heaven, in cadence with the
world's heartbeat.
His music is basic and driv
ing, and his band is hot. Brown
keeps close reign on his
players, fining the drummer
$10 each time he misses a
backbeat, which is rare, and
keeping the musicians off
drugs.

His notion of funk as truth
felt by the good and righteous
is evident in his songs that tell
the faithful to stay clean yet
tough, and to never back down
when those in power try to cut
the funk short.
The heavy beat and author
itative voice in most of the
Godfather's songs is powerful
on records, and overwhelming
in a live performance. The dan
cers at the Keystone seem
possessed by the Godfather's
message througnout the set,
but especially during "Too
funky."
The band is tighter than the
Godfather's sequined jumpsuit
as they follow the leader, slow
ing down and then picking up
the best with hypnotic fervor as
the King moves into "It's a
Man's World," his anthem for
love.
Brown looks as though the
burden of all men is on his
shoulders when he drops his
head, the rough, long, proc
essed locks hanging around
the microphone, and moans
"It's a man's world, but it
would be nothing, nothing . . .
without the woman I love."
The lights dim and the spot is
on the Godfather as he dedi
cates the song to Elvis Presley,
Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Bob
Marley, John Lennon, and Jimi
Hendrix. They are dead, and
Brown is convincing the au
dience that he is very much
alive.
Brown breaks into "Please,
Please, Please," as hisattendant
places a long, powder blue, fur
trimmed cape over the King's
shoulders. He is on the floor
singing, wrapping the au
dience in his soul. The show is
over.

A frequently repeated cliche about jazz
singers asserts that "they use their voices like an
instrument." But on hearing a first rate jazz vo
calist one can only reply that surely no instru
ment ever sounded this good. If anything the
opposite is true: the best jazz instrumentalists try
to emulate the human voice.
How else can one explain the curious attrac
tion to vocal music envinced by some of jazz's
most famous practitioners: Lester Young, the
seminal saxophonist of the swing era claimed
that in his spare hours he listened to virtually no
jazz, but only to vocalists; Charlie Parker, ac
cording to a recent interview with his widow
Chan, would wander around the house singing
over and over again the banal lyrics to some
now-forgotten pop song; Dexter Gordon, per
haps the most celebrated of living tenor sax
ophonists, prefaces each of his ballad per
formances with a recitation of some of the song's
lyrics.

Yet if jazz singing is some sort of touchstone
for the rest of the art form, one can only lament
how few true jazz singers there are. That essen
tial element of jazz — improvisation — is often
totally lacking in the performances of many so
called jazz singers; rather their performances
are duplicates of one another, and while the mu
sic may be "jazzy," it definitely is not jazz.
Ella Fitzgerald is quite obviously not that kind
of jazz singer. Her performances are so rich in
improvisational vitality that the listener often
begs for more of a repeated melody, not less of
one. Along with Sarah Vaughn, Ella reignsasthe
queen of the Baroque in jazz singing. The notes
come thick and fast and the syllables are often
stretched over inordinate lengths of time. In an
Ella Fitzgerald performance, a simple word like
"love" is likely to become "luh-hu-huh-hoo
huh-huvvvvvah." At their most gratuitous these
never-ending coloraturas can be painfully an
noying, but more often than one might expect
Ella is able to invest her lyrics with striking ori
ginality and enthusiasm.
More than two decades ago Ella recorded a
number of songbooks featuring the music of
noteworthy American song writers. The George
Gershwin Songbook, the Cole Porter Songbook,

the Rodgers and Hart Songbook, and others like
them were both attractive showcases for Ella's
talents, and also among the most commercially
successful of her albums. The Antonio Carlos
Jobim Songbook is a new edition to this series,
and in many ways is strikingly different from the
earlier discs. Most notable is the fact that Jobim,
the remarkably talented Brazilian songwriter,
forges tunes that are often only tangentially re
lated to the American popular song tradition.
Despite this, his songs have long been popular
among jazz musicians, Ella herself having rec
orded a number of them in the past.
Yet these are first and foremost Brazilian
songs, and the English translations of theoriginal
Portugese lyrics are often clumsy and inade
quate. Ella attempts to sing a few of the numbers
in their original form, but on the whole the lis
tener is given little idea of what these pieces
were meant to sound like. What emerges on the
album is Ella Fitzgerald, and not Antonio Carlos
Jobim.
But it is very good Ella Fitzgeraldthat the lis
tener hears. Partially this is due to the superior
musicians she has supporting her. A largely
South American rhythm section is augmented
with guitarist Joe Pass, trupeter Clark Terry, sax
ophonist Zoot Sims and harmonica virtuoso

Toots Thielemans. The latter in particular must
be credited with taking what is perhaps the most
recalcitrant wind instrument and drawing from
it the most euphonious of sounds.
If Ella's singing is a Gothic Cathedral, Abbey
Lincoln's is an austere chapel. Simplicity and
purity are the virtues to be found here, and the
resulting album is no less forceful than Ella's. On
"Throw it Away" Lincoln takes the simplest of
melodies, almost childlike in its repetitiveness,
and draws from it a powerful gospel feeling.
Assisting her is tenor saxophonist Archie
Shepp who appears to be increasingly neglectful
of his reputation as an avant garde musician. On
recent discs Shepp has been quite successful in
returning to a mainstream style of playing, and
this album is no exception.
Lincoln's singing displays an analytical ten
dency to break songs down into the constituent
parts. Often she will take songsat unusually slow
tempos, almost lingering sensuously over each
beat. On a suitable piece, such as Ellington's
"Sophisticated Lady" this can be quite effective,
but on the title cut, Stevie Wonder's "Golden

whole, Lincoln's album is one of her best and
will hopefully increase the following of this
much neglected artist.

"J. 8., J. 8., J. 8.," chants the
audience as the legend jumps
onto center stage looking slick
in his dark peach-colored suit
that could have been a gift
from the Liberace museum.
He looks good, not like a
faded old man. Though they
began their careers at the same
time, Brown shows no signs of
the wretched excess that
plagued Elvis Presley.
And this king can still sing.
Brown pounds through the set
like a demented man being
chased by the devil towards
heaven, in cadence with the
world's heartbeat.
His music is basic and driv
ing, and his band is hot. Brown
keeps close reign on his
players, fining the drummer
$10 each time he misses a
backbeat, which is rare, and
keeping the musicians off
drugs.

His notion of funk as truth
felt by the good and righteous
is evident in his songs that tell
the faithful to stay clean yet
tough, and to never back down
when those in power try to cut
the funk short.
The heavy beat and author
itative voice in most of the
Godfather's songs is powerful
on records, and overwhelming
in a live performance. The dan
cers at the Keystone seem
possessed by the Godfather's
message througnout the set,
but especially during "Too
funky."
The band is tighter than the
Godfather's sequined jumpsuit
as they follow the leader, slow
ing down and then picking up
the best with hypnotic fervor as
the King moves into "It's a
Man's World," his anthem for
love.
Brown looks as though the
burden of all men is on his
shoulders when he drops his
head, the rough, long, proc
essed locks hanging around
the microphone, and moans
"It's a man's world, but it
would be nothing, nothing . . .
without the woman I love."
The lights dim and the spot is
on the Godfather as he dedi
cates the song to Elvis Presley,
Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Bob
Marley, John Lennon, and Jimi
Hendrix. They are dead, and
Brown is convincing the au
dience that he is very much
alive.
Brown breaks into "Please,
Please, Please," as hisattendant
places a long, powder blue, fur
trimmed cape over the King's
shoulders. He is on the floor
singing, wrapping the au
dience in his soul. The show is
over.

A frequently repeated cliche about jazz
singers asserts that "they use their voices like an
instrument." But on hearing a first rate jazz vo
calist one can only reply that surely no instru
ment ever sounded this good. If anything the
opposite is true: the best jazz instrumentalists try
to emulate the human voice.
How else can one explain the curious attrac
tion to vocal music envinced by some of jazz's
most famous practitioners: Lester Young, the
seminal saxophonist of the swing era claimed
that in his spare hours he listened to virtually no
jazz, but only to vocalists; Charlie Parker, ac
cording to a recent interview with his widow
Chan, would wander around the house singing
over and over again the banal lyrics to some
now-forgotten pop song; Dexter Gordon, per
haps the most celebrated of living tenor sax
ophonists, prefaces each of his ballad per
formances with a recitation of some of the song's
lyrics.

Yet if jazz singing is some sort of touchstone
for the rest of the art form, one can only lament
how few true jazz singers there are. That essen
tial element of jazz — improvisation — is often
totally lacking in the performances of many so
called jazz singers; rather their performances
are duplicates of one another, and while the mu
sic may be "jazzy," it definitely is not jazz.
Ella Fitzgerald is quite obviously not that kind
of jazz singer. Her performances are so rich in
improvisational vitality that the listener often
begs for more of a repeated melody, not less of
one. Along with Sarah Vaughn, Ella reignsasthe
queen of the Baroque in jazz singing. The notes
come thick and fast and the syllables are often
stretched over inordinate lengths of time. In an
Ella Fitzgerald performance, a simple word like
"love" is likely to become "luh-hu-huh-hoo
huh-huvvvvvah." At their most gratuitous these
never-ending coloraturas can be painfully an
noying, but more often than one might expect
Ella is able to invest her lyrics with striking ori
ginality and enthusiasm.
More than two decades ago Ella recorded a
number of songbooks featuring the music of
noteworthy American song writers. The George
Gershwin Songbook, the Cole Porter Songbook,

the Rodgers and Hart Songbook, and others like
them were both attractive showcases for Ella's
talents, and also among the most commercially
successful of her albums. The Antonio Carlos
Jobim Songbook is a new edition to this series,
and in many ways is strikingly different from the
earlier discs. Most notable is the fact that Jobim,
the remarkably talented Brazilian songwriter,
forges tunes that are often only tangentially re
lated to the American popular song tradition.
Despite this, his songs have long been popular
among jazz musicians, Ella herself having rec
orded a number of them in the past.
Yet these are first and foremost Brazilian
songs, and the English translations of theoriginal
Portugese lyrics are often clumsy and inade
quate. Ella attempts to sing a few of the numbers
in their original form, but on the whole the lis
tener is given little idea of what these pieces
were meant to sound like. What emerges on the
album is Ella Fitzgerald, and not Antonio Carlos
Jobim.
But it is very good Ella Fitzgeraldthat the lis
tener hears. Partially this is due to the superior
musicians she has supporting her. A largely
South American rhythm section is augmented
with guitarist Joe Pass, trupeter Clark Terry, sax
ophonist Zoot Sims and harmonica virtuoso

Toots Thielemans. The latter in particular must
be credited with taking what is perhaps the most
recalcitrant wind instrument and drawing from
it the most euphonious of sounds.
If Ella's singing is a Gothic Cathedral, Abbey
Lincoln's is an austere chapel. Simplicity and
purity are the virtues to be found here, and the
resulting album is no less forceful than Ella's. On
"Throw it Away" Lincoln takes the simplest of
melodies, almost childlike in its repetitiveness,
and draws from it a powerful gospel feeling.
Assisting her is tenor saxophonist Archie
Shepp who appears to be increasingly neglectful
of his reputation as an avant garde musician. On
recent discs Shepp has been quite successful in
returning to a mainstream style of playing, and
this album is no exception.
Lincoln's singing displays an analytical ten
dency to break songs down into the constituent
parts. Often she will take songsat unusually slow
tempos, almost lingering sensuously over each
beat. On a suitable piece, such as Ellington's
"Sophisticated Lady" this can be quite effective,
but on the title cut, Stevie Wonder's "Golden
Lady," the tempo positively drags. Yet on the
whole, Lincoln's album is one of her best and
will hopefully increase the following of this
much neglected artist.



Ella Fitzgerald
James Brown
Keystone/Palo Alto
28 January 1982
The Godfather sits in his
dressing room beyond the long
bar behind which tenders
squirt toxic scotch, bourbon,
and gin into the glasses of the
unencumbered, the loose, the
free people who have just fin
ished giving it up for an hour
on the dance floor to the ori
ginal disco man.
"I've been listening to him
ever since I discovered he was a
sex machine," shouts Ossi
Chapman, who has been a
James Brown fan since she was
a kid in Houston and he a
younger and stronger man.
The speakers crunch a steady
funk beat as the chosen few
who remain from the first set
talk about James Brown the re
deemer, the transformer, the
blessed.
Brown is the only manonthe
planet who can with no
trepidation sing: "It's Hell
down here and we've got to get
a job, In the ghetto it's Hell, In
the White House it's Hell. It's
Hell down here, and we've got
to make a change," and at the
same time openly proclaim
that Ronald Reagan is his
"main cowboy."
Outside the Keystone the
well-dressed, the natty, the stiff,
and the funky, wait in line for
the late show doors to open.
The people smoke and sway,
waiting to see the self-pro
claimed, "hardest working
man in show business," shake
and drop to the floor, defying
age, wisdom, and a stage slick
with sweat to "turn out the
lights and call lord."
He is the funk.
"The man's a legend. He's
like Elvis," says one young man
whose older brother told him
that if he missed the show he
would be a certified fool.
Four of the most unfunky
looking punks in existence
swagger towards the crowd
from the darkness of the alley
looking puzzled, seemingly
obliterated by downs and alco
hol. The most bold punk, the
one with multicolored hairand
a knotty little face, fingers his
black Macy's punk jacket
stained with the words"Punk's
not dead," and slurrs "excuse
me, dya know what time it is?
Excuse me, dya know what
time it is?" repeatedly to any
one who will listen.
After the 15th slur or so, the
punk begins to display a beat, a
little sense of what the God
father would call "redneck
funk," and someone finally
shows him a watch. The punk is
too high to read, and just keeps
tapping his feet to the muted
beat emanating from the club.
The doors open, and the
crowd shoves its way past the
harrassed gatement towards
the soul sanctum, leaving the
punk lost in space and time.
The warm up band, Gwank
Movement, takes the stage
with all 13 band members
dressed like stars. The musi
cians take their places behind
trumpets, guitars, a syn
thesizer, a trap set, congas, and
a trombone.
Two female vocalists in red

spandex pants and sparkling
mirrored tube tops that reflect
the stage lights, stand coun
terpoint to the lead male vocal
ist who stands tall in a hushed
brown suede suit.
The band breaks into a tight
rendition of Prince's "Let's
Work," and the dancers shake
the floor, thrusting their hands
upward to the chorus. "Let's
work," shout the horn players
in unison, setting the brass
aside.
Where is Mr. Brown?
Clarence Jacks wants to hear
"Please, Please, Please," which
was the Godfather's first hit
song. Jacks first saw Brown in
1950 when the King was ascen
ding the throne. A ticket was
$2 then, and it is $9.50 now, but
that doesn't stop Jacks.
"James Brown, bring on the
man" somebody in the crowd
shouts.
The James Brown review
moves on the stage positioning
horns and turning up amps.
Brown's announcer takes cen
ter stage in his smooth off
white suit as the band beginsits
circus revelry. The James
Brown staccatto soul horn
show begins.
"... from the Middle East,"
barks the announcer like a hip
Don Pardo.
"From Europe, the United
States, South America . . . wel
come to the James Brown
show."
The audience goes wild as
the band starts the boasting re
frain, "We are the funky men,
we are the funky kings." Two
trumpets, two saxophones, and
one flugelhorn accompany the
chant with the opening riffs to
Brown's classic, "Poppa don't
take no mess."
The keyboard player stands

behind an electric piano that
has been inlayed with fake
jewels that read, "The God
father."
The dance floor is packed,
and the King hasn't even ap
peared. A spotlight flashes
across the crowd making the
audience tense with antici
pation.
"Are you ready for James
Brown?" shouts the announc
er.
"Bring him, bring on the
Godfather," four people at a
table beg. The audience is too
quiet.
"I must have caught you off
guard. I said, are you ready for
James Brown?" intones the an
nouncing, provoking chants,
handclaps, and jeers from the
audience. -"I'll give you one
more chance. Are you ready
for the living legend of James
Brown?" teases the announcer
like a soulful Barnum.
"J. 8., J. 8., J. 8.," chants the
audience as the legend jumps
onto center stage looking slick
in his dark peach-colored suit
that could have been a gift
from the Liberace museum.
He looks good, not like a
