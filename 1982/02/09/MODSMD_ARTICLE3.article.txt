Reagan sends 1983 budget to Congress
Washington — President Ronald Reagan formally sent Congress his
1983 spending plan yesterday,challenging Democratic critics to sub
stantiate charges that his is a budget for the rich. "It is not true," he in
sisted.
The $757.6 billion proposal signed by the president projects record
deficits of $98.6 billion this year and $91.5 billion for the fiscal year that
starts Oct. 1.
Reagan said he hasn't given up his now-distant goal of bringing the
budget into balance, but this plan, more than his last, encountered bit
ter rhetoric from Democrats and open acknowledgement by Re
publican leaders that it won't get through Congress unscathed.
Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia called the def
icit projections "shocking" but said the true figures are much higher.
Byrd boycotted a White House courtesy briefing for the bipartisan
leadership because "a 15-minute briefing is no briefing at all ... on a
budget of this size. I get my briefing from sources I have confidence in
that don't admit they feed phony numbers into a computer."
He was referring to Budget Director David Stockman, who was
quoted in Atlantic Monthly as acknowledging that he used untested fig
ures to produce the erroneous budget projections on which Reagan's
first round of spending and tax cuts were based.
Reagan called his latest budget with its new round of proposed cuts in
domestic programs the second step toward economic recovery.
"It is not true that it is balanced on the backs of the needy," Reagan
said, defending himself against the Democrats' charges. "We are still
continuing to increase sizably our spending on social programs."
Stage set for chemical arms production
Washington — President Ronald Reagan formally set the
stage yesterday for resuming the manufacture of new
chemical weapons after a nearly 13-year halt.
The president, in a brief letter to House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill, told Congress that the production of new
lethal nerve gas munitions "is essential to the national in
terest."
This formal certification is required by law before produc
tion can begin.
Reagan's action was foreshadowed in his new defense
budget for 1983, in which he requested $705 million for
chemical warfare, a major increase over this year's $532 mil
lion.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in his annual re
port, said the Pentagon plans to produce two new chemcial
weapons, a 155 mm artillery shell containing the nerve agent
GB and the Bigeye bomb, which would release a nerve agent
called VX.
"The Soviets are clearly ready and able to deploy chemical
weapons," Weinberger said in his report. "Deficiencies in
our current offensive and defensive capabilities could en
courage use of chemical weapons against us."
fn his brief letterof certification toO'Neill, Reagan did not
specifically mention the Soviet Union, but he said:
"Considering the current world situation, particularly the
absence of a verifiable ban on producing and stockpiling
chemical weapons, the United States must do all it can to de
ter chemical warfare by denying a significant military advan
tage to any possible initiator."
Reagan said the action announced yesterday "will provide
strong leverage towards negotiating a verifiable agreement
banning chemcial weapons."
Budget rebels gather on Hill
Washington — Robert Dole (R-Kan.), Senate Finance
Committee chairman, said yesterday that he wasconsidering
formation of a bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Dem
ocrats to try to persuade President Ronald Reagan to accept
major changes in the new budget proposal.
Dole's surprise proposal to enlist Democratic help for a
"mid-course correction" from a Republican president that
he had previously supported down the line on economic is
sues came amid growing signs of GOP unhappiness with the
Reagan budget.
The mounting resistance focused almost entirely on the
combination of record increases in defense spending and
record deficits at a time of high interest rates and recession.
Budget Director David Stockman and Secretary of the
Treasury Donald Regan met with Republican senators in a
90-minute closed session yesterday to explain the president's
plan and to urge senators to study it further before deciding
to oppose it.
But Sen. Dan Quayle (R-lnd.), a freshman member of the
Senate Budget Committee, said after the meeting "There are
not the votes in committee or on the floor for this budget.
"We have a $100 billion increase for defense over three
years as we're cutting social programs. That's totally unac
ceptable," Quayle said. "We've got to work with a different
mix — there's no doubt."
At the same time, conservative economists at the Ameri
can Enterprise Institute expressed fear yesterday that federal
deficits may soar well beyond administration predictions and
said the expansionary effect of huge deficits will clash with
the tight money policy of the Federal Reserve Board.
El Salvador leftists bomb buses
San Salvador — Leftist guerrillas wearing handkerchief
masks forced passengers off buses in three cities yesterday
and firebombed the vehicles or shot up their tires, police and
witnesses said.
No one was hurt in the attacks, but at least a dozen people
were taken to hospitals in hysterics, police said. There were
no arrests.
Police said the guerrillas attacked at least 22 buses between
6:30 a.m. and noon in the capital, and staged similar raids in
Santa Ana and San Vicente.
Another group of guerrillas exploded 14 bombs in the cap
ital before dawn, setting a bus terminal ablaze, damaging 16

buses and wrecking two telephone switch boxes, police said.
An Army spokesman said the latest guerrilla attacks
seemed to be aimed at disrupting the start of the school year
yesterday.
Church and human rights groups say 35,000 people have
died in the political violence since the junta came to power
in October 1979, including private citizens killed by govern
ment troops on suspicion of supporting the guerrillas.
Monsignor Arturo Rivera y Damas, the acting archbishop
of San Salvador, said last month that 11,723 people were
killed in the first 11 months of 1981, and most of them were
civilians.
Salvadoran police said they found 20 bullet-riddled bodies
last weekend in the capital.
Court bans 'adults only' rentals
San Francisco — The California Supreme Court ruled yes
terday that landlords cannot refuse to rent to families with
children, a decision affecting nearly half the state's rental
housing.
The 5-2 decision said that "adults only" rental policies vio
late California's Unruh Civil Rights Act forbidding dis
crimination against any group of people.
The opinion, written by retired Justice Mathew Tobriner,
said, "A society that sanctions wholesale discrimination
against its children in obtaining housing engages in suspect
activity.
"Even the most primitive society fosters the protection of
its young; such a society would hardly discriminate against
children in their need for shelter.
"Yet here the landlord would single out children asa class
for exclusion from shelter although such discrimination
against racial minorities and religious groups would be un
questionably illegal," the landmark decision said.
Detente conference disruptions likely
Madrid — Under the threat of a potential filibuster by the
Communist bloc, foreign ministers of some 20 European
states meet here today to deliver speeches about Poland at
the 35-nation conference that is reviewing the 1975 Helsinki
detente agreement.
U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig is provisionally
listed as the 10th speaker when the meeting gets under way
at the Palacio de Congresos. But Polish Deputy Foreign Min
ister Jozef Wiegacz will be in the chair, and asof yesterday he
was refusing to accept the list of speakers as registered with
the conference secretariat. Instead, he has his own list of sev
en Communist bloc speakers, and he also wants to limit the
session to three hours.
An East-West negotiation to draw upa compromise speak
er's list and agree on all other procedural arrangmeents for
the meeting was still unresolved late last night. It is possible
that nobody will know what is going to happen until the
Polish delegate takes the chair at 11 a.m. today.
The speaker'? list, provided by Spain, the host country, so
far comprises 18 countries — all of them Western, neutral or
nonaligned. But the Poles have refused to accept the list and
instead say that they intend to operate from a list that was
registered with their delegation as chairman of the next
meeting.
Military aid for Turkey will increase
Washington — The Reagan administration plans to use
part of the foreign aid increase in the proposed 1983 budget
tor a major rise in assistance to the martial-law government
in Turkey, informed sources said yesterday.
Any large-scale increase in support for Turkey is likely to
be a source of controversy in Congress and among American
allies in Europe.
U.S. aid to Turkey, especially arms aid, has long been com
plicated by objections from Greek-Americans and others
who opposed Turkish actions in Cyprus. An arms embargo
against Turkey was maintained at congressional insistence
for four years during the 19705.
Largely because of congressional pressure, the sums of
arms aid for Turkey in the past several years have been tied to
those for its traditional antagonist, Greece.
In the Reagan administration, however, relations with Tu
rkey have been warmer than have those with Greece. The ad
ministration has had good things to say about the "law-and

order" achievements of the Turkish regime of Gen. Kenan
Evren, who took over in a military coup in September 1980.
The State Department has argued that it is not inconsistent
totakedrasticstepsagainst martial lawin Poland while aiding
and approving martial law in Turkey. Calling the two martial
law regimes "fundamentally different," a State Department
spokesman said the Turkish military's decision was taken "in
a deteriorating climate that was threatening democratic val
ues, and was supported by virtually all segments of Turkish
society."
Gene research rules only relaxed
Washington — A National Institute of Health committee
that had endorsed in principle abolishing federal regulation
of gene engineering experiments backed away yesterday
and settled for relaxing the rules.
The apparent change of heart came after the NIH Recom
binant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) received a batch of
strong letters from university bio-safety committees, con
gressmen and scientists, the majority of whom favored keep
ing mandatory federal controls on gene-splicing research.
The scientists' chief concern was that the absence of feder
al regulations might create a political vacuum that could re
sult in more restrictive local laws and regulations. After near
ly three hours of debate, the committee voted 16-to-5 to
keep mandatory rules but relax their provisions.
Committee members were at pains to point out, and to in
corporate in a preamble to the new federal rules, that keep
ing the mandatory regulations does not mean the committee
believes genersplicing experiments are more hazardous
than other kinds of biological research.
The current guidelines allow more than 90 percent of
gene-splicing experiments to go on without special over
sight. The revisions passed yesterday will expand this catego
ry to include essentially all non-disease-causing organisms.
Tokyo plane crash leaves 23 killed
Tokyo A Japanese airliner on a domestic flight crashed
into the shallows of Tokyo Bay this morning, and police re
ported 23 people were killed, four were missing and 147
were rescued.
Japan Air Lines said about 80 of the survivors were in seri
ous condition, and the rest had lesser injuries.
One passenger with a Korean name was apparently the
only foreigner aboard, JAL spokesman Jim Weatherly said.
The plane was carrying 166 passengers and a crew of eight.
Nearly five hours after the crash, police said three people
were still trapped in the shattered cockpit section, which
broke off in the crash and lay under the fuselage in shallow
water. It was not known whether any of them were alive.
As rescue work continued, crews were unable to use cut
ting torches because of the danger of igniting spilled aviation
fuel. Crews were attempting to pump out fuel still left in the
plane's tanks.
The plane, JAL's domestic flight 350 from the city of
Fukuoka in southwestern Japan, crashed at 8:47 a.m. (6:47
p.m. EST yesterday) in clear weather.
The plane was on its final approach, about 1000 feet short
of one of the runways at Haneda Airport, when it mowed
down several landing lights atop stanchions stretching out
into the bay. The aircraft pancaked into the shallow water.
The nose section broke off, but the fuselage remained large
ly intact, resting on the muddy bottom in waist-deep water.
Stock market hits year's low
The stock market tumbled to its lowest levels of the year
today in a selloff blamed on concern over rising interest rates
and the federal budget deficit.
Analysts said investors found little encouragement in Pres
ident Reagan's budget proposals, issued over the weekend.
Bond traders also voiced concern that short-term interest
rates would continue their recent rise as the Federal Reserve
struggles to control the growth of the money supply.
Today's weather
Increasing clouds today with a slight chance of afternoon
showers. Mostly cloudy tonight with a chance of light show
ers. Partly cloudy tomorrow. Lows in the 30s to mid 40s, highs
in the 50s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons. Chance
of rain 20 percent today and 30 percent tonight. j
