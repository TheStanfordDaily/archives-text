Reagan sends 1983 budget to Congress
Washington â€” President Ronald Reagan formally sent Congress his
1983 spending plan yesterday,challenging Democratic critics to sub
stantiate charges that his is a budget for the rich. "It is not true," he in
sisted.
The $757.6 billion proposal signed by the president projects record
deficits of $98.6 billion this year and $91.5 billion for the fiscal year that
starts Oct. 1.
Reagan said he hasn't given up his now-distant goal of bringing the
budget into balance, but this plan, more than his last, encountered bit
ter rhetoric from Democrats and open acknowledgement by Re
publican leaders that it won't get through Congress unscathed.
Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia called the def
icit projections "shocking" but said the true figures are much higher.
Byrd boycotted a White House courtesy briefing for the bipartisan
leadership because "a 15-minute briefing is no briefing at all ... on a
budget of this size. I get my briefing from sources I have confidence in
that don't admit they feed phony numbers into a computer."
He was referring to Budget Director David Stockman, who was
quoted in Atlantic Monthly as acknowledging that he used untested fig
ures to produce the erroneous budget projections on which Reagan's
first round of spending and tax cuts were based.
Reagan called his latest budget with its new round of proposed cuts in
domestic programs the second step toward economic recovery.
"It is not true that it is balanced on the backs of the needy," Reagan
said, defending himself against the Democrats' charges. "We are still
continuing to increase sizably our spending on social programs."
