Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Rich
ard Wilbur, reading his own poetry
and his translations of other works,
last night captivated his audience of
400 with his insights and charmed
them into laughter by his often hu
morous outlook on life.
Wilbur, whose 12 books of poetry
have brought him national acclaim,
read his old, new and some yet-to-be
published poetry illustrating his
thoughts on the serious and the hu
morous conditions of modern man.
Comparing a poet to an albatross,
Wilbur read, "The poet is like this
monarch of the clouds, familiar with
storms and with stars and of all high
things exiled on earth ... he cannot
walk on earth born down by giant
wings." The poem represents a trans
lation from Baudelaire's original, but
also mirrors Wilbur's own talents.

At ease from the beginning with
his large audience in Fairchild
Auditorium, the 60-year-old poet
continued by reading other poems
he translated from their original Old
English, French, Russian and Polish.
"When I was in school, I loved
Beowulf, unfashionable as it was at
that time," he said as he read a pas
sage in the original. Then, in identical
rhyme and rhythm, he read his trans
lation of the passage.
He then contrasted that serious ex
cerpt with translation of an old
Anglo-Saxon riddle he relayed to the
audience. "I saw in a corner some
thing swelling, rearing, rising, and
raising its cover. A lovely lady, a lord's
daughter bearing her hands in that
volminous body, then covering with
cloth that puffed creature," he read.
"I guess it's generally known those
riddles often have one clean and one

students to remember that now is "an important time to learn to be

dirty answer," he said when the
laughter resided. He did not say
aloud what either answer was, how
ever.
Several of his poems reflect his life
experiences. In the "Piccolo Corn
media," he described his feelings
while bumming around the state of
Kansas. In another poem he reads of
meeting Sylvia Plath because her
mother wanted Wilbur to show her
"that writing poetry can be jolly."
Wilbur ended his reading with
what he called the "ridiculous," in
cluding a line from a poem about the
movie The Prisoner of Zenda that
began "At the enda, the prison of
Zenda."
Wilbur's poetry awards include the
Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1957 and
the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1952,
and again in 1963.
The reading is »he second event of
the Jean and Bill Lane Lecture Series.
