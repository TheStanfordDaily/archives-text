Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Rich
ard Wilbur, reading his own poetry
and his translations of other works,
last night captivated his audience of
400 with his insights and charmed
them into laughter by his often hu
morous outlook on life.
Wilbur, whose 12 books of poetry
have brought him national acclaim,

lation from Baudelaire's original, but
also mirrors Wilbur's own talents.

his large audience in Fairchild
Auditorium, the 60-year-old poet
continued by reading other poems

English, French, Russian and Polish.
"When I was in school, I loved
Beowulf, unfashionable as it was at
that time," he said as he read a pas
sage in the original. Then, in identical
rhyme and rhythm, he read his trans
lation of the passage.
He then contrasted that serious ex
cerpt with translation of an old
Anglo-Saxon riddle he relayed to the
audience. "I saw in a corner some
thing swelling, rearing, rising, and
raising its cover. A lovely lady, a lord's
daughter bearing her hands in that
volminous body, then covering with
cloth that puffed creature," he read.
"I guess it's generally known those
riddles often have one clean and one
