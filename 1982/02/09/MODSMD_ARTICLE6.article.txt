# Library staff deals with uncatalogued books
##

Processing library books manually
is a thing of the past, but the technol
ogy to catalog new books by com
puter is yet to be perfected.
A processing slowdown stemming
from the University libraries' switch
to a computer cataloging system in
1972, has resulted in an enormous
backlog of new books â€” 100,000 vol
umes in all.
The number of uncataloged
books, new titles which have not yet
been assigned a reference number
and therefore cannot be shelved, has
been growing by about 8000 to 70,000
volumes a year, according to James
Myers, assistant director of technical
services.
Research Libraries Information
Network (RLIN), a computer catalog
ing system developed at Stanford,
was supposed to make the process
ing of new books easier and quicker
by linking the University with other
top research libraries, including the
Library of Congress.
Catalog numbers, which are time
consuming to determine, were to be
shared among member libraries.
Members planned on saving time
and money as the computer's data
base grew.
"Our library staff was cut in antici
pation of increased cataloging effi
ciency," Myers said, "but the data
base didn't growquicklyenough. We
still had to do a lot of the work
ourselves."
Between 1974 and 1981, the
backlog grew to 80,000 titles. An ad
ditional 20,000 volumes have backed
up since last summer when the com
puter system was shut down and
reprogrammed for greater efficien
cy, Myers explained.
Numerous bugs have appeared in
the new software since then, causing
the backlog to grow daily. The Uni

versity's 4.6 million-volume library
currently receives 50,000 new titles
each year.
"We probably brought part of the
system up too quickly," said Ed Shaw,
president of Research Libraries
Group (RLG), the 27-member con
sortium that owns RLIN. Shaw esti
mates that the software problem will
be cleared up by the end of March;
currently 22 professional computer
programmersare working on the sys
tem.
"The problems we've come up
against are vexing but under
stanciah>l&," Myers said. "\A/e* arc*
working on the edge of automated
technology."
Despite the lack of reference num
bers to identify and locate the new
books, three-fourths of the
backlogged titles are available to
scholars here. "It issomewhat incon
venient, but you can search for new
material on a terminal and we can
usually produce it within 24 hours,"
Myers said.
To speed up the processing of im
portant material, University librar
ians assign a priority number to each
new book. For example, most sci
ence titles receive top priority. The
backlog of uncataloged science
books is relatively small, only about
2000 titles, according to Myers.
"Most of the backlog is low priority
material, such as research in the hu
manities," Myers said. "It is impor
tant material for scholars, but not in
everyday demand."
Myers recently requested $500,000
from the University to help reduce
the backlog. If approved, however,
the additional funds would only
eliminate 50,000 volumes (half the
current backlog) over a period of five
years.
