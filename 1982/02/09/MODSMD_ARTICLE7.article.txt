### Tim Lundergan 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night endorsed 8-0 a statewide bottle
bill initiative. The proposal, sched
uled for the November ballot, would
require a minimum 5 cent deposit on
beverage containers made of glass,
metal or plastic.
The council also moved to equal
ize all city council members' salaries
at $400 a month and forwarded com
ments on the future of the Palo Alto
airport to county officials.
Council member Ellen Fletcher
claimed deposit legislation in other
states has reduced litter 90 percent,
while litter in Yosemite National
Park, which requires returnable bot
tles, has also dropped dramatically.
Seven states have bottle bills in force,
and Massachusetts recently ap
proved a similar measure.
Litter in local parks would drop
sharply, Fletcher said, and solid waste
at the Baylands dump would be re
duced by 6 percent.
Irene Sampson of the League of
Women Voters said that the league
rarely participates in referendums,
but legislative attempts to pass a bot
tle bill have failed repeatedly.
Sampson said the measure would
conserve natural resources.

Bottling companies have lobbied
and campaigned actively against re
quiring deposits.
Some council members wished to
promote the referendum initiative
by informing local citizens of the
measure's worth. Council member
Larry Klein objected because he said
he felt using public funds in a parti
san issue would set a bad precedent.
City attorney Diane Lee reminded
the council that recent court de
cisions prohibit such a use of funds.
The council also commented on a
proposed environmental impact re
port on Santa Clara County airports,
including the one the county leases
from Palo Alto.The city objects to any
physical expansion of the airport,
such as adding a taxiway parallel to
the runway.
Director of Planning Ken Schreiber
said the county report used 1978 fig
ures which projected an increase in
flights, while 1980 statistics showed
fewer recreational flights because of
higher fuel costs.
Several local flyers told the council
airplanes were a fuel-efficient means
of transportation and that demand
for the airports was strong.
