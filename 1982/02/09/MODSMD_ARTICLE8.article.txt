## Chi master to be studied 
### Kristen Christopher 
In a recent Kenpo Karate class here, a visiting
scholar from China created a "force field" that
caused his wife to physically move, without any
apparent effort by her.
Dr. P.S. Yu, now retired from Shanghai First
People's Hospital, is more than a distinguished
physician — he is also a famous master of "Chi
gong" — exercises which can control "Chi", or
"life force", through mind and body integra
tion. Part of Yu's role here is to undergo scien
tific study so that the nature of Chi can be in
vestigated, according to Dr. Martin Lee, an engi
neering physicist at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center(SLAC).
"Chi isa well-known phenomenon in Chinese
history, and the important thing is to come up
with proof of its existence," Lee said.
Chi is a mysterious force that can be con
trolled through meditation, martial arts, and
specific physical and mental activities, but when
someone "exercises" the Chi, the body func
tions change in various ways. These changes, Lee
said, are what he would like to study.
"The physical properties of Chi have been
studied in China in recent years, but since the re
sults were difficult to assess, we would like to du
plicate the experiments here," he said.
In addition to the proposed experiments on
the physical properties of Chi, studies of the
biological effects are being planned in col

laboration with Prof. Herbert Benson, director
of the Behavior Medicine Laboratory at Harvard
University and author of the highly publicized
book Relaxation Response. Lee said that, for ex
ample, they would like to investigate how Yu's
body temperature, breathing rate, and heart
rate change when he is producing Chi.
Lee, now a teacher of Tai Chi, first learned
about Yu 12 years ago when he was told by his
teacher that Yu is the most knowledgeable Chi
master. He began searching for Yu in 1975, but
he said that because of the Gang of Four in Chi
na, he was not able to contact him until 1979. Lee
said that although he met with him only briefly
in Shanghai, Yu taught him by correspondence
until he came to the United States six months
ago.
"As a gesture of gratitude to Stanford," Lee
said, Yu and his wife are conducting weekly
classes in Chi-gong for staff members of the
Stanford Alumni Association. Theclasses involve
exercises consisting of standing and sitting
martial arts postures. According to Lee, these
postures were developed by Yu by combining
techniques used in Buddhism, Taoism, Chinese
martial arts, and modern medical study.
Yu, 82, was educated in Heidelberg and has
taught at several universities. "He has been de
voted over 50 years to studying health, longevity,
healing, and martial arts," Lee said.
