THESE SPECIES WILL
SOON BE EXTINCT
(with your help)
The ZIP ZAP (Vestus downii,
var. zip per us)
Don't worry! Our ever-popular poplin V
vest is in good supply (at only $60). But V \
we have come across a small herd of a yf
slightly variant species, identical even in
its 5 1 /4 ounces of pure goose down fill, * V, j A
except that this subspecies features a / J
full-length front zipper behind the 112 \ '/A '.
snap-down storm flap. Sizes S thru XL in '
khaki only. $44.99
tThe PINNACLE (Parkae
veriwarmus)
This noble species, easily identified-by
its full poplin windshell and 12 ounce
goose down fill, was thought to be extinct
\ already since it had been discontinued at
' the factory. However, we have located a
small population. You'll want to have one
with you when you venture into sub-zero
climes. Regularly $134; NOW $84.
BALLOON CLOTH
SWEATER(Jackeetus downii 'JjKK
var. cottonus)
This is a species that has seldom been > \y
reported reliably within the United n "ifcy
States. It is very closely related to our I
common down jacket, even in its BVa
ounces of goose down fill, but on close
inspection you will notice its luxurious £-4
skin of 100%-pure cotton balloon cloth.
We found a large flock headed for Japan tjl
and were able to cull out many with very
slight imperfections. Value well over
$100; NOW $69.99. 2Q/8() qqqq£ DOWN
COMFORTER

Kb ( * ■ i { At times this year we have seen
ms - enormous populations of this annual
W . J| V visitor. But it is now late in their season,
Ilr and reliable sightings are getting fewer
n. ft ' . anc ' ar^er between. This species is
jf jr \ x quickly identified by the symbiotic
jfc I ' j v 1 relationships it forms with slumbering
lr 1 ( Homo sapiens and by its prostrate
Ifi 1 JjaW \ posture. This species has more feather
ft faJv A §& \ than ot^ers °* ' ts 9 enus - but it does
l&sisJmTJfflf i provide the same warmth at a much
lower price. Regularly $120 to $190;
NOW $92 to $143.
