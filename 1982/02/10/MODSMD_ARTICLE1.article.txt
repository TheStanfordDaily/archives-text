Recommendations which the Sub
committee on Residential Education
and Advising will present to the Fac
ulty Senate in the spring may lead to
changes in residential education that
will interest more faculty members in
being resident fellows here.
The subcommittee, part of the
Committee on Undergraduate Stud
ies, is charged by the Faculty Senate
with making "recommendations re
garding the optimal use of University
residences for purposes of advising
and education, as well as evaluation
of such uses."
According to subcommittee mem
bers, possible recommendations in
clude proposals to restructure theme
houses, experiment with new types
of residential education in the new
dorms, and reorganize the Office of
Residential Education in order to at
tract more faculty members to resi
dent fellow positions.
Although one method of en
couraging more faculty members to
be resident fellows would be to in
crease their compensation, Subcom
mittee Chair Kennell Jackson, as
sociate professor of history, said that
"more money isn't the answer."
Instead, he said the subcommittee
wanted to create an atmosphere of
"intellectual ferment and interest" in
the residences which would make
faculty members want to participate.
However, Diana Paul, Soto resi
dent fellow and member of the sub
committee, said the subcommittee
would definitely consider asking the
University for increaased compensa
tion. "We need a change in attitude
on the University's part to take more
direct responsibility for the residen
tial education program and to sup
port that responsibility with an in
creased budget," she said.
Some non-faculty resident fellows
are reportedly afraid of being re
placed if the subcommittee's recom
mendations actually encourage
more faculty members to be resident
fellows.
However, Paul said the subcom
mittee's recommendations will not
significantly change Residential
Education's policy on the selection of
resident fellows. "I think the major
purpose of the subcommittee's rec
ommendations is toattract good resi
dent fellows, both staff and faculty,"
she said. But she added that faculty
members would be preferred to staff
membersif all other qualifications
were equal.
Sally Cole, a non-faculty resident
fellow at Florence Moore, said she
hadn't noticed any fear on the part of
other non-faculty member resident
fellows, but that resident fellows
have very little contact with one an
other.
Cole said she felt Residential

Education sometimes emphasized
faculty status at the expense of quali
ty when selecting resident fellows.
She said resident fellows who are not
faculty members often felt like "sec
ond-class citizens" because of this
preference.
Paul said the subcommittee will
recommend that faculty members be
encouraged to participate in Resi
dential Education not only as resi
dent fellows but also as "faculty co
sponsors of educational programs"
associated with different houses.
