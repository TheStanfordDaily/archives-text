# Inside : Mental Health Week workshop focuses on preventive measures
##

Sally has three midterms plus LSATs next week.
Her best friend's mother just died, and her room
mate just stumbled in drunk for the third time that
week. In a school often accused of being far re
moved from"the real world," Sally's problems are
all too real.
Learning how to effectively handle and prevent
situations like these is the driving force behind this
week's "Mental Health Week," sponsored by the
Bridge and the Office of Residential Education.
The week, according to Susan Larsen and Bruce
Campbell of the Bridge, is not to exploit mental
health or examine fringe cases, but to raise student

awareness to problems ordinarily not discussed.
"The kinds of issues we want to focus on are ones
frequently under the surface and unaddressed,
because no one ever sees them as something to
which you really should pay attention to," Larson
said. Stress, interpersonal relationships, sleep, and
eating are among the many issues explored this
week.
The design of the program revolves around lec
tures, discussions and workshops given by a wide
range of professors, Bridge staffers, community
professionals and doctors. The events, all different
in nature, are mostly held in student residences.
"We deliberately chose to have most of the

events in dorms, because these are student con
cerns," Larsen commented. "Dorms, being the
center of most students' lives, provide a less formal
atmosphere to discuss these issues, as well as being
more accessible to everyone."
The idea for a mental health week began with a
desire to address major student concerns before
they became serious obstacles. "It's preventative
in nature," Campbell said. "People tend to deny
their own mental state; we want to demystify that
and let peope know that the problems they en
counter are an ordinary, everyday part of student
life."
