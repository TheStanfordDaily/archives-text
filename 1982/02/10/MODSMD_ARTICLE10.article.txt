# Inside : Mental Health Week workshop focuses on preventive measures
## 
### Steve Kaufman 
Sally has three midterms plus LSATs next week.
Her best friend's mother just died, and her room
mate just stumbled in drunk for the third time that
week. In a school often accused of being far re
moved from"the real world," Sally's problems are
all too real.
Learning how to effectively handle and prevent
situations like these is the driving force behind this
week's "Mental Health Week," sponsored by the
Bridge and the Office of Residential Education.
The week, according to Susan Larsen and Bruce
Campbell of the Bridge, is not to exploit mental
health or examine fringe cases, but to raise student

awareness to problems ordinarily not discussed.
"The kinds of issues we want to focus on are ones
frequently under the surface and unaddressed,
because no one ever sees them as something to
which you really should pay attention to," Larson
said. Stress, interpersonal relationships, sleep, and
eating are among the many issues explored this
week.
The design of the program revolves around lec
tures, discussions and workshops given by a wide
range of professors, Bridge staffers, community
professionals and doctors. The events, all different
in nature, are mostly held in student residences.
"We deliberately chose to have most of the

events in dorms, because these are student con
cerns," Larsen commented. "Dorms, being the
center of most students' lives, provide a less formal
atmosphere to discuss these issues, as well as being
more accessible to everyone."
The idea for a mental health week began with a
desire to address major student concerns before
they became serious obstacles. "It's preventative
in nature," Campbell said. "People tend to deny
their own mental state; we want to demystify that
and let peope know that the problems they en
counter are an ordinary, everyday part of student
life."
Phillip Zimbardo, a psychology professor and participant in the
program, also commented on the preventative aspect of the
week. "The traditional approach to mental health problems," is
what to do after the person is in distress," he said. "The modern
method is to discover how we can enhance and maintain a per
son's well-being as well as look at how Stanford is or is not helping
in this maintenance process."
He added: "People jog to help remain healthy. We want people
this week to discover the preventative equivalent of psy
chological jogging."
Awareness is also a motivation behind the week. In addition to
providing students with information, the program's sponsors
hope to make more visible the various means in which a student
can seek help when distressed without feeling the traditional stig
ma attached to it. It is this awareness, both of the problem and of
its solution, that is the key to better mental health.
Another angle of the program is to look at the University en
vironment and study the various ways in which students try to
maximize their potential performance. Is staying up late at night
and eating poor food the proper way to learn things? Elizabeth
Targ, one of Mental Health Week's coordinators, said she feels
such a study to be an important part of the program.
The fundamental idea of being here," is to optimize one's

chances of bettering oneself," Targ said. "When a student feels
uncomfortable in a dorm or struggles until 3 a.m. with a problem
set, what does this do to a student's self-esteem? To his or her de
sire to achieve? With student life being so diverse and demand
ing, we hope the week will provide some answers to these ques
tions."
This idea of diversity is reflected in the program's calendar of
events. Just as all students have different thresholds of dealing
with problems, the types of situations students encounter are also
as broad. To accomodate for this, Mental Health Week examines
ideas ranging from the Soviet Human Potential Movement to a
communications workshop entitled "What Your Mother Never
Told You about Talking to Strangers."
"Not everyone will go to every workshop, but among the diver
sity of the issues, I'm sure there will be workshops or lectures
which almost everyone will find relevant to their lives," Campbell
said. *
The idea for an entire week of activities rather than scheduling
various lectures throughout the quarter is a first for the Bridge and
stems from the current trend of student activities, Larsen said.
"It seemed as if everyone was having a week for something," he
said. "Rape Awareness Week, Arms Control Week, etc. As a re
sult, early this quarter, someone mentioned half seriously that we
should have a Mental Health Week. We thought about its possi
bilities, and really felt it could work." Soon after, the Office of Res
idential Education became involved, and formal scheduling of
events got underway.
"The week format is great because it serves to link the ideas to
gether and really shows that there's a unified concern about all of
the issues," Campbell added. Such linking, hopes the staff of
Mental Health Week, will encourage discussion and conscious
ness-raising among students about what the quality of life at the
University should be.
"We are really excited about the program," Targ commented.
"We hope people will look at this week's events and realize that
proper mental health care is much more importantthan currently
thought." In addition, Targ said she hopes the week will dispel the
many myths associated with both preventative measures and
treatment.
"When someone is hospitalized for a broken leg, people view it
as something very different as being hospitalized for psy
chological problems," Targ said. "Raising awareness this week
should hopefully provide some insights to students as to why
they, and many others, feel this way."
Overall, the purpose behind the week is to help students view
their lives in a way which they, perhaps, ordinarily would not do.
It attempts to point out the different stresses and pressures which
students encounter, as well as what they can do about them. This
preventative attitude, it is hoped, will ultimately improve the
quality of a student's well being, Larsen said.
"After all, the idea of college is to have fun!"
