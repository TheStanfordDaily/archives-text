## Reagan faces budgetary facts 
### 
New York (AP) â€” The answer to deficits is eco
nomic growth, said President Ronald Reagan in
presenting his budget. But theeconomyshrinks.
The gap grows. And the options evaporate.
One possibility for reducing the gap would be
tax increases, buttheeconomyalready isinsorry
shape. To raise taxes might be to risk pushing the
teetering economic vehicle off the cliff.
Perhaps, then, even more can be cut from the
budget. Perhaps, but onlyatthe risk of an uproar
from aid recipients and elected officials. Cut de
fense then? The president himself would object.
Maybe the Federal Reserve could be induced
to ease credit, setting off a revenue-building
spending spree. But, the Fed objects, that would
mean a return to inflation, one area where suc
cess has come.
What then? Live with the budget gap, says
Reagan, foresaking what was once the most
basic of all his goals, and demonstrating at the
same time that he had little or no choice.
Reagan has been forced by realities of life to
make almost heretical changes in his formula for
success, not just in terms of budget balancing,
which now isn't a goal at all, but in other essen
tials.
Whereas a year ago he portrayed the options
as clear and attainable, his budget this year dem
onstrates how ephemeral and elusive they are.
It is now conceded that there won't be a sharp

recovery, even if the budget writers suggest it.
Their own numbers show it. Real 1982 gross na
tional product isn't expected to total even one
percent, and in 1983 it might reach 5.2 per cent,
which ranks it as unremarkable.
Interest rates are likely to stay in double digits
into next year. And over the next several years,
concedes the president, rates "will fall less rapid
ly than we had originally anticipated."
As was conceded earlier, the unemployment
rate is likely to rise rather than fall, to as much as
10 percent of the workforce, before improve
ment can be looked for.
Miscalculations? Yes. Neither the big deficits
nor the recession were foreseen. The excuse
sounds lame. .. it is impossible in a short peri
od of time to correct the mistakes of decades,"
said Reagan.
If the economy grewsmartly itwould resolvea
lot of the conflicts. But it isn't, and that removes
the keystone from the plan. The transfer of eco
nomic power to the private sector isn't likely to
be swift.
It is in this area that intense arguments are
bound to develop. Some of the president's
strongest supporters in private industry argue
that the deficits will prevent them from embark
ing on expansion.
