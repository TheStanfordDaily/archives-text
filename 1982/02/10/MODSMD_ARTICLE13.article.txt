# U.S. denies Salvadorans asylum
## 
### Daily wire services 
The U.S. government, which
is supporting a controversial
government in El Salvador in
the name of stopping com
munism in Central America, is
refusing to grant asylum to
people who say they want to
escape the violence of the civil
war there.
The government's position
appears to run contrary to two
international treaties officials
signed and an act approved by
Congress.
Last year only two of the 5570
Salvadorans who applied for
asylum were granted it, even
though thousands of civilians
were killed there.
When asked for explanations
of the policy, spokesmen for
both the State Department and
the Immigration and Natural
ization Service pointed to the
other department as the one
responsible.
Several refugee organiza
tions have filed suit, orare pre
paring suits, arguing that the
government's support of the
Salvadoran junta has resulted
in violation of the lawanda de
nial of the traditional American
welcome to people fleeing po
litical persecution.
"We are not complying with
international law," says Los An
geles attorney Carlos Holguin,

of the National Center for Im
migrants' Rights.
Holguin was referring to the
U.N. Convention and Protocol
Relating to the Status of Refu
gees, signed and ratified by the
U.S. Senate in 1951 and 1969. In
it the United States affirmed its
commitment to accepting ref
ugees from countries where
there is a likelihood they would
suffer loss of life or freedom
because of race, religion, na
tionality or political opinion.
The Refugee Act of 1980, ap
proved by the Congress, states:
"The attorney general shall not
deport or return any alien ...
to a country if the attorney
general determines that such
alien's life or freedom would
be threatened in such country
on account of race, religion,
nationality, membership in a
particular social group or polit
ical opinion."
"The U.N. High Commission
for Refugees says they
(Salvadoran refugees) should
be presumed to be political
refugees," Holguin said. "The
United States has a policy that
says political refugees will not
be returned."
Yet more than 400
Salvadorans a week who enter
the United States illegally are
being returned to their home
land.

INS records show refugees
from other nations, even those
with less violence, have a bet
ter chance of being granted
asylum in the United States.
In fiscal 1981, when two
Salvadorans were granted asy
lum, the INS received 257 asy
lum requests from Hungarians
and granted 21 of them. Nearly
one third of the 613 requests
from refugees from Afghan
istan were granted. Of the 992
requests from Ethiopians, 174
were approved. Asylum was
granted to 33 Romanians out of
217 applications filed. From
Nicaragua: 4111 requests, 297
granted. From Iran: 7138 re
quests, 120 granted.
The executive director of the
Central American Refugee
Center in Washington claims
the government, with its re
mote detention camps in south
Texas and southern California,
is trying to keep Salvadoran
refugees isolated where they
cannot discuss conditions in
their country.
She, like many other immi
gration lawyers, argues that
Salvadoran refugees are
treated as they are because the
U.S. government is supporting
the Salvadoran government,
and to grant asylum would ac
knowledge violation of human

rights and persecution of
citizens.
"If the INS granted the asy
lum," she says,"it would refute
the State Department's basic
argument, which is that the
(President Jose Napoleon)
Duarte regime is not repres
sive."
Affidavits, gathered by
Holguin for a class-action suit
against the INS, describe the
conditions that led many of the
would-be refugees to flee El
Salvador. They are consistent
with news accounts and re
ports coming from El Salvador
concerning the conduct of
government troops.
From a student who had par
ticipated in a demonstration:
"I remember that when the
government forces began to
shoot at us, I ran for my life.
However, a soldier struck me
with the butt of his rifle, and I
fell. When I stood up, I felt
something hot in my ab
domen." He had been shot
twice, once in the head, once
in the intestines. His mother
tried to visit him in the hospital.
"On the way, she was caught in
a gun battle and killed by the
government forces. She had
never been involved in poli
tics."
