# Airlines wage price war on flights east
## 
### 
New York (AP) â€” Price cutting on coast
to-coast air travel intensified yesterday as
Continental Airlines slashed its round-trip
fares to $258 from the industrywide level of
$298.
Continental's move came one day after
Trans World Airlines and Eastern Airlines
matched cuts of up to 52 percent initiated
by United Airlines, American Airlines,
World Airways and Continental.
American, United and TWA, which
dominate transcontinental air travel, had
no immediate comment on Continental's
latest reduction.
Los Angeles-based Continental said the
new fares do not carry any purchase re
strictions, but that travel on the $258 fare
must begin by March 31.
As it has in the past, Continental said it
felt it had to lower its fares because its
flights are not non-stop, with passengers

normally having to switch planes in Den
ver, Continental's hub, or in Houston.
But American spokesman Al Beckersaid
the move carries "competitive implica
tions" nonetheless.
On Monday, TWA and Eastern said their
new unrestricted one-way coach fare be
tween New York and Los Angeles will be
$149. That compared with the previous
$310 fare on TWA and a $205 fare on
Eastern.
Both airlines also said they would raise
those fares to $169 on April 1.
TWA's 52 percent cuts, effective today
and continuing through March 31, will ap
ply to flights from New York to either Los
Angeles, San Francisco or San Diego.
TWA also announced reductions rang
ing from 44 percent to 49 percent on trans
continental fares from Washington, Bos
ton and Philadelphia to California.

Eastern's new fare, effective starting to
day through March 31, also will apply to
travel between New York and San Francis
co, which had cost $229, and between Phil
adelphia and Los Angeles or San Francisco,
which had been the same as the New York
fares to those cities.
TWA also announced a 46 percent cut in
unrestricted, one-way business-class fares
between New York and either Los Angel
es, San Francisco or San Diego to $169 from
$311. Cuts ranging from 39 percent to 49
percent were announced on other trans
continental routes.
Its first-class fares will remain un
changed.
TWA said as of April 1, unrestricted one
way transcontinental coach fares will
range from $169 to $199, and its business
class fares will range from $199 to $229.
