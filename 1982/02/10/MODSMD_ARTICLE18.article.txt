## Viewpoint/Nick Burbules Unfair expectations for RAs 
### 
The more I see of the Resident As
sitants (R.A.s) situation the more I'm
convinced that there is something
basically wrong. Several of myfriends
and I have had R.A. experience. We
all agree that the rewards of the job
are frequently exhilarating. Some
times we feel appreciated. Some
times we feel that we're making a dif
ference in other people's lives. But a
steep price is paid for those peak ex
periences, and many of us are in
creasingly concerned that the situ
ation which R.A.s are placed in (and
place themselves in) is unhealthy for
a normal student psyche.
First, there is the exaggerated
sense of responsibility under which
many R.A.s labor. One source of this
attitude is the Residential Education
staff, and officials extending up to
University President Donald Ken
nedy himself. Don't get me wrong:
these are fine people, and I know
they are concerned abou the prob
lem of "R.A. burnout." But, from the
first days of R.A. selection to the last
pep talks of orientation, nearly ev
erything they say and do drives home
the uniqueness and importance of
the R.A. role and the lucky few who
are chosen for the task. This builds
great rapport and confidence on the
surface, and a lot of pressure under
neath. At my college, R.A.s were
nothing special; they were someone
around to talk to, that's all.
Another source of this exag
gerated sense of responsibility is the
R.A.s themselves. Like all Stanford
students, they are incorrigible over
achievers. Furthermore, as a self
selected group, they tend already to
have hyperactive conscience. They
think in terms of giving and think it's
self-indulgent to demand time for
themselves; they work so hard on
programming for others that they
often can't enjoy it themselves. It
isn't possible to be all things to all
people, but that is what many R.A.s
think they must be to do their job
well. If a party flops, or someone
quits school, or attempts suicide, the
common R.A. attitude is "I should
have seen it coming, I could have
kept it from happening." I've seen
that reaction; I've felt it myself.
Yet, another source is other stu
dents. Somewhere along the line,
some people got the idea that the
R.A.s are the social, cultural, and po

litical life-blood of the house, and
that the quality of a school year is de
termined by whether you get a
"good" or "bad" R. A. That sort of at
titude adds more pressure to the
R.*\.; it gets to the point where the
R.A. feels responsible for other peo
ple's happiness. Students gripe when
R.A.s aren't constantly available,
which makes it more difficult for
R.A.s to have time to themselves.
Finally it comes to this: too many stu
dents want things done for them.
Ultimately, though, it isn't a matter
of personal blame: it's in the defini
tion of the R.A. job itself. I seriously
question whether the educative, or
ganizational, and psychological re
sponsibilities of the R.A. are within

the capabilities of undergraduate
students with little or no professional
training. I know many R.A.s who
fulfill those responsibilities well, and
happily; and I know more, many
more, who do not and cannot.
Second, the relationship of R.A.s to
other students interferes with, and
sometimes makes impossible, or
dinary casual friendships. The issue is
authority and power, and if those
words sound too dramatic for this
context, try to keep a pet in your
room, or have an off-campus lover
move in. When the rules of the resi
dential system come down, it is the
R.A. who is squeezed between the
role of enforcer and the role of friend
and house-mate (and guess which
has to give way).
Take a more common example: a

noisy party in one student's room at 3
a.m. Often, people seek out the R.A.
and demand his/her intervention, or
the R.A. takes on the role of the
heavy without even being asked. This
image (or self-image) of the R.A. as
police officer, diplomat, referee or
surrogate parent makes the whole
problem simple by focussing on one
person's authority, rather than look
ing at the complicated and difficult
issue of how to maintain a communi
ty of shared responsibilities and ob
ligations.
But authority also takes more sub
tle forms. To the extent that an R.A.
takes or is granted some special
primacy in social relations, it in
terferes with the mutual give-and
take that creates friendship. That's
one reason why the sanest R.A.s are
usually those with good friends out
side their residence and with support
from other R. A.s who haveshred sim
ilar joys and miseries. The other side
of this problem is that some R.A.s use
their special authority and high vis
ibility to bind students to themselves,
mistaking devotion for friendship
and respect (Why should students be
immune to this trap? Faculty fall into
it, too.) Finally, some R.A.s regard
their position as one of leadership
and decision-making, which they as
sume regardless of "popular sup
port," and which they strive to main
tain, to the detriment of their actual
ability to influence people or events.
In short, the pressures of responsi
bility and the temptations of author
ity constitute two pitfalls, the first of
suffering through periods of guilt,
anxiety and inadequacy, the second
of succumbing to the fantasy that one
is wiser, fairer and more important to
the lives of others than one really is.
Of course, R.A.s do manage to keep
balanced between these much of the
time, and they will survive their falls,
and perhaps even gain in maturity
because of them. This isn't the first
time that someone has pointed out
the problem of "R.A. burnoijt" and
its sibling, "R.A. megalomania." But
what R.A.s don't need from any of us
is a push in either direction, and I'm
writing this letter to ask for greater
awareness of occasions in which we
do so.
