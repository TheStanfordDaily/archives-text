## Swanson analysis 'crackpot' 
### 
Reading Mark Swanson's article, "Reagan's quest for
Golden Age finds crackpot economics" (Daily, Feb. 2),
was perhaps the most intellectually painful experience I
have gone through in years. My thought process was
mercilessly wrenched by this polysyllabic lathe powered
by drivel, rank speculation and bonehead economics.
To start, the article plunges with spiteful glee into the
all-too-familiar attacks on Reagan's intelligence (the guy
actually doodles! yuk!). I tired quickly of this rhetorical
sewage when suddenly seized at the cerebrum by a re
markably ignorant remark about budget deficits. I
quote, with some hesitation and much agony,"... defi
cits will cause pressure on the credit markets, sending in
terest rates skyrocketing, choking out private invest
ment, and sending inflation spiralling."
Economic ideology aside, such twaddle is inexcusably
confused. If I am to interpret this criticism along popular
lines, the high interest rates will be caused by deficits and
tight money supply growth; the latter condition is neces
sary if the credit markets are to be pressured. Next, with
interest rates up and investment down, economic activi
ty will be quite sluggish. Hence unemployment will be
high, which will inevitably temper wage demands. Final
ly, amidst this gloom, consumer demand will be weak.
The scenario thus involves tight money, moderating
wage increases, and feeble consumer demand. It is
absolutely baffling how Swanson can add this up and get
spiralling inflation.
A mere two sentences after the article's paragraph on
economic theory comes a remark about a vicious
"downward spiral." I was never quite sure whether it re

ferred to the aforementioned inflation spiral (downward
inflation? yikes!), a deficit spiral, or what.
To my horror the words swarmed like army ants to
their next subject — the "new federalism." The Presi
dent's proposal raises some serious questions; un
fortunately, the article bludgeoned me with more tripe
about how the program would, "allow Southern statesto
deny the benefits of these social programs to blacks."
Now most of us know that the "new federalism" has
even yet to be formally drafted; but did I really miss
something about its proposing to repeal the 14th
Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
Just when I sensed relief that the article had exhausted
most all possibilities for blundering on domestic policy,
it turned to foreign affairs. In a single statement it sub
jected history to the same cruelty it showed logic, mod
eration and Econ. 1. Witness, "Relations with the Soviet
Union are the worst since the Truman administration." I
was thankful the article granted a re'prieve by not ex
plained how events like the Cuban Missile Crisis were
part of that cordial past.
I was ill prepared for what was about to come — words
of admonition cascading downward, ruthlessly pelting
my conscience. Why didn't you listen to Jimmy? Jimmy
knew all along what was best! If you voted for Jimmy ev
erything would be okay! By now, my head was throbbing
and I was short of breath, as if asphyxiated by the printed
claptrap that lay before my bloodshot eyes. With palsied
hands I let the Daily slip to the floor and reached for a
bottle.
