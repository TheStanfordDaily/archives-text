## New housing regulations will cost University valuable grads 
### 
College administrators have to
deal with a lot of disgruntled special
interest groups. They get sick and
tired of being called racists by minor
ity groups and sexist by women's
groups. Aftera while, they start doing
anything they can to get the heat off
and produce some statistics to show
that they have made great strides to
alleviate whatever situations the stu
dents are moaning about. This is all
somewhat understandable given the
fact that none of these complaining
groups ever does anything positive
for the administrators or the school.
After all, the administrator thinks,
what do I need these people for? I'll
do whatever it takes to keep them
out of my office.
Lately, another group of students
has been trying to make a case for as
sistance: the graduate students living

onsmallstipendsand payingthrough
the nose for housing. They have re
ceived the same consideration as all
the other groups — a policy change
that results in improved-looking
statistics while actually serving only
to kick more grad students out into
the streets. This time, however, the
administrators have failed to take
into account that top graduate stu
dents, like faculty, are vital to this
university and that Stanford is already
losing excellent ones to other
schools with fairer housing policies.
According to a 1979 report, so
many graduate students are desper
ate for affordable housing that 1500
single graduate housingspaces could
easily be filled right now if such
spaces suddenly opened up. Ob
viously, Stanford is housing a very
small percentage of those who desire

to live here. So the administrators
have come up with a great solution.
Grad students without children will
no longer be allowed to live on cam
pus for more than a year. The ones
with children get four years — short
er than the time required for most
Ph.D. work. After that, the students
and their families must relinquish
their spots.
What will be the effect of this poli
cy? Most doctoral candidates will
spend at least four years earning their
degrees. It will not be worth it to
many of them to move on campus if
they have to move to an off-campus
apartment a year later anyway. So,
the demand is going to go down. The
supply will remain the same. Viola —
the housing department is satisfying
a greater percentage of those who
want on-campus housing. Since they
are now housing four students for
one year each instead of one for four
years, they can claim to have
"housed" four times as many stu
dents! They have responded to a
need with concern and promptness.
Who will still want to live in Escon
dido Village? There are Master's
degree candidates and business
school people who are here for only
a year or two at most; foreign stu-

dents who can't speak English well
enough yet to find off-campus hous
ing easily. Still, even the housing de
partment's own report shows that
these groups are already over-repre
sented in on-campus housing. While
only 30 percent of the graduate stu
dents are in their first year, they oc
cupy 51 percent of the housing
spaces. Only 21 percent of the grads
are foreign, but they occupy 40 per
cent of the housing spots.
I have tried to recruit several stu
dents from my undergraduate de
partment to come to Stanford. These
students have had a choice of out
standing research institutions to at
tend, so quality-of-life aspects such
as availability of affordable housing
have been important to them. Need
less to say, they have all gone to
Harvard. I expect to lose this year's
student to Berkeley. This type of
thing ought to make the housing
people concerned with something
else besides making their statistics
look better.
Let's face it. Stanford certainly
hasn't made its reputation on the
quality of the undergraduate educa
tion it provides. It gets good students,
takes their $10,000, even kicks them
off-campus for a while, gives them a

watered-down curriculum, and
pacifies them with a misleading grad
ing system in which almost nobody
ever gets less than a C. Stanford has
made its reputation on its scientific
and technical research, featuring
profitable interactions with genetic
and electronic industries. But who
does all this research? The grad stu
dents. There's too much of it for the
faculty members f o do on their own,
even though many professors man
age to get out of teaching duties. The
Insider's Guide to College has de
scribed Stanford as the most over
rated school in the nation. If the Farm
doesn't keep attracting good grad
students, it won't even be overrated
any more.
The administrators should be gen
uinely concerned this time. Sugges
tions have been made such as mov
ing graduates into the trailers when
the undergradsare finally freed, kick
ing all graduate students out of Mir
rielees, and using the huge un
satisified demand for single graduate
housing as a "buffer" in case under
graduate demand ever goes down
low enough to create vacancies (all
examples from the housing report).
This will serve only to convince those
of us here — and worse, those con

sidering coming — that the people in
the housing department care even
less about grads than about the
miffed and irked Lithuanian students
league.
The three-year series of 14 percent
rent increases to finance the new un
dergrad dorm is even more of an out
rage.
All the graduates get is a curt letter
one day informing them that they are
now being kicked out of their hous
ing at theearliest possible opportuni
ty in order to make room for more
business, masters and foreign stu
dents. The current residents, for
merly promised that they could stay
until they had earned their degrees
(they had paid a deposit and suffered
through a long waiting-list period),
were not even consulted. Even single
parents living in family housing got
the letter. Without proximity to
Escondido School they may have to
leave the University altogether.
For those of us already here, it's too
late. We have to stay, and finish our
research even after being booted out
of our housing. But, I think I'll tell
that prospective student that she
might as well go to Berkeley.
