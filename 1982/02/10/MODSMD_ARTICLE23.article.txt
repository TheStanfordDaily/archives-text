## Mackinnon's scholarship provides intellectual challenges 
### 
I was appalled by the statements
made at last Tuesday's ASSU Senate
meeting regarding Visiting Prof.
Catharine MacKinnon's teaching
qualifications. As a former student in
her law school classes (both Sex Dis
crimination and Administrative Law),
I wish to testify to the value of the
point of view she added to the legal
education available at Stanford dur
ing the past year, and the intellectual
challenges she presented in all of her
classes.
Students expecting the conven
tional, the easy, or the nice from all
professors have been disappointed.
MacKinnon questions the
usual intellectual contructs, asks why
legal and therefore social arrange
ments exist in the way they do, and
makes new connections both within
and between different areas of the
law. Her questions lead todifficult in
sights about one's own life, as well as
thought about the entire human
community.
Few people are indifferent to
MacKinnon, and the student
evaluation cited by one ASSU Sena

tor reflected this fact. The one rating
he mentioned refers to only one of
seven questions asked after the class
she taught last spring, and does not
refer to evaluations of either of the
two classes she taught last fall (those
evaluations have not yet been pub
lished). The overall response to that
one question was nearly "neutral,"
reflecting an almost equal number of
strong positive and negative re
sponses. It was "lowest" only by
tenths of a point.
I prize the challenge of Catharine
MacKinnon's scholarship, based as it
is on both practical experience and
extensive theoretical research. I
know the entire University com
munity will benefit from having her
as a guest professor. It would benefit
us even more if she became part of
the permanent faculty.

Moped not only danger
As a mopedalist, I have no quarrel
with the recent movement to have

the laws that are on the books en
forced. But when the Richard East
man (Daily, Feb. 5) and others imply
that the traffic problem in the inner
campus is caused solely by mopeds, I
must say a few words to put the situ
ation in perspective.
It is true that this year in particular
has seen a dramatic increase in the
number of mopeds on campus. Any
one who has been here for a while,
however, knows that dangerous, un
controlled traffic has been a problem
in the inner campus for much longer
than two quarters. I have read many
letters in this newspaper since I ar
rived here in 1979 deploring the lack
of control that cyclists exhibit and the
hazards to both them and pedestri
ans. I knew few people here that
haven't had at least one bike accident
on campus. I know even fewer who
have had accidents involving
mopeds.
As I said before, there is nothing
wrong with enforcing a law that says
that mopeds may not be operated in
the inner campus. But if safety is the
goal, I think that that money would

be much better spent on other exist
ing laws such as bike lights, observa
tion of stop signs and speed limits,
and other traffic control ordinances,
as well as better regulation of all traf
fic in the inner campus. I can easily
imagine the situation of a lighted,
well-braked moped getting involved
in an accident with an unlit bike at
night, and I know exactly where the
blame would be placed, regardless of
the facts. If we're discussing laws,
let's either enforce them all or forget
the whole thing.
