## Commentary/Michael Weiss No more guilt over Gilligan 
### 
Have you ever been interrupted while doing an en
joyable activity by the question, "How do you find time
to do that?" Isn't it irritating?
There are you, Joe Averagestudentberg. You're relax
ing in your reclining chair. You have a beer in one hand.
Your eyes are glued to the television. Gilligan of
"Gilligan's Island" has just stepped into quicksand.
Then you hear the quick, hard steps of the red-hot
down the hall. You hear him zip up his backpack. He is
approaching your door. You try to lock it, but it is too
late.
He has already reached your room. He looks in and
says with a sympathetic grin, "Blowing off your studies
again, Joe? I don't understand how you can find time to
watch T.V. like this. Anyway, I'm off to the library."
You try to continue to watch the tube. However, it's
impossible. The guilt has already set in. Now, all you can
think of is No. 14 of your physics problem set, which you
already spent 40 minutes trying to figure out. You think
to yourself. "Maybe if I spend another 20 minutes on it,
I'll get it."
Any interest in Gilligan has disappeared. Within
minutes, you're back at your desk. The lamp goes on.
The head bends over the books. Writing hand starts
scribbling away.
Is there any way to beat this guilt feeling? Is it possible
to watch the remaining 15 minutes of "Gilligan's Island
with a clear conscience?
To receive an answer to this question, my first intuition
was to call my mother. I said to her, "Hey Ma, is it okay if
I blow off my studies for one night? Can I watch T.V. and
drink beer instead?"
She said, "Of course you can, Bill. I know how hard
you work in school. You can relax one night."
"Thanks, Ma," I said. "That makes me feel better. But,
Ma, why did you call me 'Bill'? This is Joe."
"Then you must have the wrong number. My son is

called Bill."
I was tempted to call my own mother. However, I
knew she would give me the same answer. If so many
mothers could give the same answer to such a difficult
question, that answer could not be the right one.
I still did not have the right answer. I was becoming
desperate. I ran to the first person I saw, a man, and said
to him," Where does one find time without feeling guil
ty?"
Looking up at me strangely, he replied in a British ac
cent, "I say, Chap, you're a queer one, aren't you. Any
one knows that you can find Time as well asNewsweek in
The Store."
There was only one alternative. I had to ask the great
big Cardinal-the-color-not-the-bird-in-the-sky.
I went to the football stadium with a can of red spray
paint. I lay the paint in the middle of the football field.
Looking toward the sky, I yelled, "Oh great Cardinal
the-color-not-the-bird-in-the-sky, please tell me how I
can do fun things without feeling guilty.
The spray paint can rose above the field, and spelled
out the following sentence: If an activity, whatever it
may be, is important to you, then you should not feel
guilty about doing it. P.S. Gilligan was saved from the
quicksand by the Professor and Marianne.
I was overjoyed, ecstatic, bubbling with happiness. I
finally knew the answer. It did not matter what I did. It
only mattered whether what I did was important to me.
I arrived at my room, and looked at myself in the mir
ror. I watched the joy fall off my face, as I realized that I
had forgotten to ask the Cardinal one very important
question.
How could I also convince the red-hot down the hall
that it was okay for him to watch the tube, so that he
would not continue to beat me so badly on test scores?

Have you ever been interrupted while doing an en
joyable activity by the question, "How do you find time
to do that?" Isn't it irritating?
There are you, Joe Averagestudentberg. You're relax
ing in your reclining chair. You have a beer in one hand.
Your eyes are glued to the television. Gilligan of
"Gilligan's Island" has just stepped into quicksand.
Then you hear the quick, hard steps of the red-hot
down the hall. You hear him zip up his backpack. He is
approaching your door. You try to lock it, but it is too
late.
He has already reached your room. He looks in and
says with a sympathetic grin, "Blowing off your studies
again, Joe? I don't understand how you can find time to
watch T.V. like this. Anyway, I'm off to the library."
You try to continue to watch the tube. However, it's
impossible. The guilt has already set in. Now, all you can
think of is No. 14 of your physics problem set, which you
already spent 40 minutes trying to figure out. You think
to yourself. "Maybe if I spend another 20 minutes on it,
I'll get it."
Any interest in Gilligan has disappeared. Within
minutes, you're back at your desk. The lamp goes on.
The head bends over the books. Writing hand starts
scribbling away.
Is there any way to beat this guilt feeling? Is it possible
to watch the remaining 15 minutes of "Gilligan's Island
with a clear conscience?
To receive an answer to this question, my first intuition
was to call my mother. I said to her, "Hey Ma, is it okay if
I blow off my studies for one night? Can I watch T.V. and
drink beer instead?"
She said, "Of course you can, Bill. I know how hard
you work in school. You can relax one night."
"Thanks, Ma," I said. "That makes me feel better. But,
Ma, why did you call me 'Bill'? This is Joe."
"Then you must have the wrong number. My son is

called Bill."
I was tempted to call my own mother. However, I
knew she would give me the same answer. If so many
mothers could give the same answer to such a difficult
question, that answer could not be the right one.
I still did not have the right answer. I was becoming
desperate. I ran to the first person I saw, a man, and said
to him," Where does one find time without feeling guil
ty?"
Looking up at me strangely, he replied in a British ac
cent, "I say, Chap, you're a queer one, aren't you. Any
one knows that you can find Time as well asNewsweek in
The Store."
There was only one alternative. I had to ask the great
big Cardinal-the-color-not-the-bird-in-the-sky.
I went to the football stadium with a can of red spray
paint. I lay the paint in the middle of the football field.
Looking toward the sky, I yelled, "Oh great Cardinal
the-color-not-the-bird-in-the-sky, please tell me how I
can do fun things without feeling guilty.
The spray paint can rose above the field, and spelled
out the following sentence: If an activity, whatever it
may be, is important to you, then you should not feel
guilty about doing it. P.S. Gilligan was saved from the
quicksand by the Professor and Marianne.
I was overjoyed, ecstatic, bubbling with happiness. I
finally knew the answer. It did not matter what I did. It
only mattered whether what I did was important to me.
I arrived at my room, and looked at myself in the mir
ror. I watched the joy fall off my face, as I realized that I
had forgotten to ask the Cardinal one very important
question.
How could I also convince the red-hot down the hall
that it was okay for him to watch the tube, so that he
would not continue to beat me so badly on test scores?
