## Patriotic journalism undemocratic 
### 
The notoriety given the remarks
made by University President Donald
Kennedy concerning employees'
statements on University matters is
an interesting version of a statement
made by another president on a simi
lar subject. President Ronald Reagan
recently asked news reporters to
consider the impact of their work on
U.S. foreign policy objectives
abroad. Explicitly, Reagan was asking
of the media a seemingly innocuous
favor: to temper news objectives
with patriotic restraint. Implicitly,
though, Reagan made an objec
tionable request concerning the very
heart of journalistic freedom and in
itiative.
It is a classic observation that gov
ernment and the news media have
differing objectives in many cases.
There are many reasons for this. First,
there are certain types of gov
ernmental business that are said to
require secrecy, such as military
projects of the federal government,
and criminal investigations con
ducted by state, local and federal
governments. Second, the operation
of the bureacracy depends in many
ways on its low profile. An example
of the embarrassment made possible
by disclosures of bureaucratic action
is the "Golden Fleece" award given
by Sen. William Proxmire (D.-Wisc.)
each month to a group he feels
wasted federal money. In this case,

the media is used to expose gov
ernmental, or governmentally
funded projects that would normally
be safely hidden from public view.
In the past, presidents have at
tempted to facilitate the restructur
ing of a news event to fit their own
purposes. An excellent example was
the Vietnam war. The actins of the
U.S. military in Southeast Asis were
completely unknown to most Ameri
can citizens, specifically, the re
peated aerial bombings of Cam
bodia.
In cases like this, the public's right
to know is of primary importance.
The democratic process can work
only if elected officials are accoun
table to the public, and accountabili
ty is suspended in a system in which
officials can carry out policies
without the knowledge of the elec
torate. An interesting twist in the
coverage of the Vietnam War was
that some news organizations could
document the bombings of Cam
bodia and the extraordinary dif
ficulties facing the U.S. Army, while
the American public knew nothing
of these events. Thepatrioticspirit
in which news organizations made
decisions to withold information
from the U.S. people was in fact a
tragic misconception of journalistic
priorities. How different would re
cent U.S. presidential history be if
that same conception of journalistic

priorities were applied to the Water
gate scandal?
The prima facie objective of any
news organization in a democratic
society is properly thought to be the
disclosure of news. Reagan has en
joyed excellent relations with the
press up until now, as good as per
haps any president in recent memo
ry. This should not blind Reagan to
the probability that some embarass
ing disclosures will be made concern
ing his administration during his term
in office; he must learn to deal with
those disclosures. John F. Kennedy
was a great example in this regard:
Kennedy took full responsibility for
an ill-advised act (The Bay of Pigs
fiasco) and emerged from the inci
dent enjoying a bolstered popularity
with the American people.
Whether or not a president
emerges from a fiasco with an en
hanced public image is not the point,
making sure that fiasco becomes
public knowledge is. Reagan's call
for patriotic journalism is unjustified
and improper. Patriotism does have a
place in the media's value system;
however, this is one area where the
flag should not obstruct the vision of
the press, or, more importantly, the
public.

priorities were applied to the Water
gate scandal?
The prima facie objective of any
news organization in a democratic
society is properly thought to be the
disclosure of news. Reagan has en
joyed excellent relations with the
press up until now, as good as per
haps any president in recent memo
ry. This should not blind Reagan to
the probability that some embarass
ing disclosures will be made concern
ing his administration during his term
in office; he must learn to deal with
those disclosures. John F. Kennedy
was a great example in this regard:
Kennedy took full responsibility for
an ill-advised act (The Bay of Pigs
fiasco) and emerged from the inci
dent enjoying a bolstered popularity
with the American people.
Whether or not a president
emerges from a fiasco with an en
hanced public image is not the point,
making sure that fiasco becomes
public knowledge is. Reagan's call
for patriotic journalism is unjustified
and improper. Patriotism does have a
place in the media's value system;
however, this is one area where the
flag should not obstruct the vision of
the press, or, more importantly, the
public.
