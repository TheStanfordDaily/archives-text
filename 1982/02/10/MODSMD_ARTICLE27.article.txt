# Surprise! It's an amazing event

### Anthea Stratigos 
Throwing the perfect party with person
ality and pizazz isn't easy. It has to be one
that everyone will remember, not because
it was a dismal failure, but because it ran
like a fine-tuned watch.
Amazing Events Unlimited, a new busi
ness created last year by three Stanford
students with the perfect party in mind, of
fers assistance with any gathering.
Partners Mark Breier, Jeff Heyman and
Eddie Poplawski each got the idea for their
business separately. They hadenjoyed put
ting together unusual affairs at Stanford
and one night they began a "wouldn't if
be fun if. . ." conversation regarding their
crazy events. Amazing Events Unlimited
was born soon after.
The company markets creative events
for private and corporate entertainment
purposes. The partners act as consultants
and entertainment brokers, planning and
executing events for their clients.
As long as lack of morality or legality
isn't involved, the trio will tackle any
thing, they said.
General purpose and brainstorming
meetings are held during a local restau
rant's happy hour, an atmosphere re
ported to be conducive to creativity.
A woman wanted a special birthday for
her husband. Amazing Events Unlimited
took on the job.
With mixed-up dinner reservations, a
hired car, and the illusion that Breier was
an employee, the couple ended up at one
of San Francisco's premiere restaurants.
The husband had always wanted to go
there. The bill was prepaid.
Upon leaving, the couple saw a street
vendor selling posters depicting Farrah
Fawcett, a sky-line of San Francisco and a
blow-up photo of the couple. The vendor

remarked that the poster had been out
selling Farrah all evening.
A city lookout point was next on their
agenda. When the couple arrived, a com
plete table for two with champagne and
hors d'oeuvres awaited them. Their favor
ite music played in the background.
One of Amazing Events Unlimited's
most exciting events was a swanky dinner
party for 22 in Woodside. The hostess, who
wanted to play a practical joke, decided
that it would be amusing to have a clumsy
butler and maid serving her guests.
The two, dressed to the hilt in traditional
servants garb, were Stanford students.
The bumbling began subtly. The maid
served appetizers with her hands, and
drinks were mixed up.
The maid began winking at the men and
adjusting her bra strap while serving. The
butler decided to trim houseplants. A fly
swatter was brought out by a servant, in
hot pursuit of imaginary pests. The guests
looked on in disbelief.
The night ended with a fight between
the pair over their opinions of a cheap
painting on the wall. It was smashed over
the butler's head. The guests were horri
fied because they thought this "ex
pensive" painting had been destroyed.
"The nature of the events are attention
getting and/or make people smile," says
Breier. Amazing Events accomplishes this
on a corporate level, too
Engaged to entertain the spouses and
children of the crew on the U.S.S. Coral
Sea, they handled a Christmas party. A
troupe of tap-dancing dill pickles and a
performing chimpanzee were the hit of
the show.
Their biggest event was an open house
celebration for Levi Strauss entertaining
4000 people.
"It went over tremendously. We used a

combination of Stanford and San Francisco
talent," said Breier.
A stiltwalker, juggler, mime, puppeteer
and Great America characters pleased ev
eryone.
"It was a big jump for us into the world
of corporate entertainment," said Breier.
Disasters have been avoided, the trio
said, because they have high standards of
performance. Since the nature of their
business involves spontaneity and sur
prise, any mistakes are only visible to the
employees of Amazing Events Unlimited,
they said.
The group seeks the more outlandish
jobs, but money doesn't typify their
clients. Creativity and a sense of humor do.
Fees stem from a formula base fee plus a
percentage of costs.
Having what the partners say is a perfect
job for after college, they plan expansion.
The market for this has not yet been
tapped, said Breier. They are aiming
toward the advertising, real estate and
electronics industries of the area, because
the firms have a systematic need for atten
tion-getting events, he said.
Though they enjoy working together,
there are some difficulties such as learning
how to handle friendship on business
terms, Poplawski said.
The company finds it hard to find
creative people who are organized and re
sponsible. But they are still looking. "We
know we don't have a grasp on all the
creativity in the world," says Poplawski.
Though they claim no exclusive hold on
creativity, Breierand Poplawski have some
interesting dream events. Breier wants to
throw a party in a 747 and Poplawski's wait
ing for the day when Amazing Events Un
limited can gift wrap the Trans-America
pyramid in San Francisco.
