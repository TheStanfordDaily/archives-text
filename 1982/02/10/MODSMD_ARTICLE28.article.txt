## Stress 
### John Burns 
"We are in a highly
stressful and competitive
environment," acknowl
edged Dr. Doug Daher of
Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS),
a subsidiary of Cowell Stu
dent Health Center at his
workshop on stress man
agement last Monday. Dur
ing the seminar, Daher pro
posed a number of ways to
combat the tension in
school as well as in society.
Sress is caused by "de
mands that exceed the re
sources a person has to re
spond to those demands,"
explained Daher. The stress
itself is not so evil as the anx
iety which often results. This
anxiety causes an uneasi
ness of emotions and an in
terference of the thinking
patterns. "Awfulizing," or
feeding yourself a per
spective that makes things
seem worse ("If I don't pass
this midterm I'll die."), isthe
general cause of this anxiety
and can be prevented by ac
cepting the fact that not ev
erything is going to be
perfect.
The typical Stanford stu
dent, according to Dr.
Daher, takes approximately
one and a half years to ad
just to life at the University.
Certainly, some may per
form well from the start, but
at a much higher than nor
mal stress level.
Such intensity freshman
year leads to what is known
as the Stanford slump.
Sophomores begin to ask
themselves whether or not
they want to study as hard
for three more years. They
become very reflective,
contemplating choice of

major, pondering many
emotional problems such as
their sexuality, and realizing
that some of what they as
sumed during their mid
adolescent period is not
true.
Dismal as this all may
sound, there are a number
of ways to reduce stresssitu
ations. Transcendental med
ication, yoga and "breath
ing and relaxation ex
ercises" work for some, but
there are a number of ways,
in terms of everyday life
style, which can relieve
built-up tension.
Talking to others is much
better than internally suf
focating the problem.
Friends can be very helpful
and so can counselors at The
Bridge, CAPS, and Campus
Ministry. Writing a letter or
doing some other kind act
for another can help.

Alcohol and drugs appear
to work well, but only create
further problems. Not only
is your ego inhibited from
learning how to cope with
anxiety, but a few days later
the depression often re
turns. This can be especially
harmful is you get drunk on
the weekends because the
reoccurrence of depression
coincides with the begin
ning of the new week.
Lack of sleep increases
tension and might nor take
its toll here at Stanford, but
if you are accustomed to
pulling all-nighters for
midterms, then you will do
the same for big projects in
the working world or for
solving some sort of marital
problem.
The important thing is to
treat the mind like a friend,
not just something to be
utilized.
