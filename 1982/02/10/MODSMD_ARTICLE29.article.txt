### Jim Tassopulos 
The problem of building a meaningful,
lasting relationship with a member of the
opposite sex is ageless. It is a dominant
theme in many aspects of thought, and it
has been studied in a variety of art forms
from the great romantic novels to Woody
Allen movies to numerous self-help
books.
At Stanford, the problem of establishing
satisfying relationships is no less evident.
According to Dr. Harvey Weinstein, psy
chiatrist for the Cowell Counseling Set
vice, most students seeking professional
help have problems with relationships.
Weinstein, along with Doryn Davis, di
rector of the Health Promotion Program,
conducteda workshop discussing intimate
heterosexual relationships at 558 Mayfield
Monday as part of Mental Health Week.
Approximately 30 students, mostly men,
were first shown a film depicting a first
date in which the stereotyped male and
female roles were reversed. The reaction
to the film combined with reactions to
submissions of stressful situations ex
perienced by the participants formed the
basis of the discussion.

Those at the workshop concluded,
mainly from the similar problems sub
mitted by both men and women, that each
gender's .needs a re not very different. At
times, perceived differences which result
from socially influenced role-playing in
terfere with a meaningful two-way rela
tionship.
Where people are in the life cycle is also
important. Since University students are
making the transition from late
adolescence to early adulthood, they face
distinct problems in starting relations with
members of the opposite sex and in form
ing an individual identity.
"The conflict between identity and sep
aration is the key at this stage," Weinstein
said.
Although the submitted problems
ranged from whether to kiss on the first
date to the inability to express love, the
central theme which emerged both in the
film and in the comments involved the ad
vantages, risks and problems of taking the
initiative in a relationship.
The paradoxical need and fear to ex
press true feeling surfaced throughout the
discussion. For a person to show his true

self to another can be very risky, everyone
agreed. Davis and others commented that
if one is rejected after a date or two he or
she can simply rationalize that the role
they were playing was to blame. But, if one
bares his soul and is rejected, it is often
taken to mean a powerful judgment of in
adequacy. Davis stated that when "you're
offering the best you've got," rejection
can be devastating.
Also, many students said that a request
forsomething more than friendship froma
memberoftheoppositesex,will, if it is de
nied, most often ruin the original friend
ship.
Weinstein argued that the rejected indi
vidual should not feel he is to blame. He
went on to say that once this key fear of re
jection which dominates everyone's life
and all the workshops he has conducted, is
defeated, the subsequent honesty and
risk-taking would lead to more honest re
lationships.
"What if both people are keeping their
feelings hidden?" Davis asked. A possibly
good relationship will have no chance to
materialize, she said.
