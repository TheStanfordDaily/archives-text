Suicide, the nation's 10th leading killer,
indeed has a cure — prevention, claims a
local suicide prevention director.
Charlotte Roos, the executive director
of San Mateo County's Suicide Prevention
and Crisis Center, led a two-hour work
shop yesterday at Huston House to avert
this prevalent cause of death.
Ross stated that reactive depression is
the first brick along the path to suicide.
"We wrap ourselves up with human con
tact — that is what makes us human beings.
But when that contact is broken, it's really
like major surgery without anesthesia,"
Ross said.
"The thing or person that was most im
portant to you suddenly is ripped away —
is suddenly lost," she added. Then one be
gins to wonder how to terminate the re
sulting anxiety and often finds suicide as a
viable method, according to Ross.

The workshop featured a mental
"hands-on" exercise with Ross leading the
dozen participants through an entire sui
cide episode. Along the way, she ex
plained how and why suicidal tendencies
develop and the best methods to prevent
them.
"Those people that are down in the pits
find that their basic behavior patterns do
change," said Ross. Potential suicide vic
tims usually alter their eating patterns,
consuming more or less food. They also
experience disruptions in their sleeping
schedule, with many dozing longer than
usual. "Sleeping is the cheapest form of
anesthesia. It makes the world go away,"
Ross noted.
A person with suicidal tendencies will
often withdraw from his or her ordinary
social activities and contacts. The entire
body slows down and becomes extremely
vulnerable.

Finally, the body speaks: "I can't go on,
so I'll kill myself." Ross sees the method of
suicide as symbolic. "Most of the time,
there is a message people give out when
they commit suicide," she said.
Citing an ABC crisis intervention meth
od, Ross offered a nearly foolproof pre
vention for seriously suicidal people. The
'A' step involves identifying the crisis and
staying in close contact with such a person.
The second phase is the most important,
according to Ross. "The greatest gift you
can give the person you are working with is
understanding and not fearing their sui
cidal notions," she stated. The key to the
'B' step is listening to these feelings
without offering advice.
The final stage requires obtaining pro
fessional assistance to deal with the prob
lem. Handling a situation of such magni
tude alone could result in fatal conse
quences, she said.
