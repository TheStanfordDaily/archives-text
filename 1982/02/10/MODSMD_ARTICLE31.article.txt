Relax. Breathe deeply. Concentrate.
These are just a few elements of the Za
Zen school of meditation. During a
seminar entitled "Origins and Applica
tions of Meditation," doctoral student
Scott Peterman explained Za Zen meth
ods of meditation. Za Zen involves deep
concentration solely on breathing and
posture, unlike other methods which
utilize mental pictures or chants.
Though attendance was low, those
present were enthusiastic. One senior,
]ude Brandel remarked, "I'm just in
terested in meditation. Besides, I'm an
R.A. and I need some way of main
taining my sanity."
Peterman, a doctoral student with the
religious studies department, is also a
specialist in Zen Buddhism. "The object
of Za Zen," said Peterman, "is not to
control or ignore thoughts, just to
watch them."
This is accomplished by maintaining a

specific posture and concentrating on
deep, slow, rhythmic breathing. Peter
man says that the mind will soon begin
to wander in this state, and such wan
dering should not be discouraged.
Rather, the subject should simply re
turn to awareness of his breathing
whenever he starts to realize that his
thoughts have drifted elsewhere.
One of the most important parts of
this type of meditation is the assump
tion of the proper posture. According
to Peterman, the back should be
absolutely straight though not stiff, and
the eyes should remain open to make
sure that the subject doesn't simply fall
asleep.
In addition, the legs should be
crossed and the arms held comfortably
to the sides, with the hands clasped at
the naval. When all of this is done prop
erly, the experienced meditator re
portedly undergoes a series of surpris
ing physiological effects.
In deep Za Zen meditation the sub

ject can emit both alpha and theta brain
waves, something which normally oc
curs only in sleep or with the eyes
closed. In addition, one becomes less
prone to habituation — the state of be
coming used to some stimulus and thus
"tuning it out" of the thought process.
Perhaps one of the most startling ef
fects of this type of meditation is that,
while the breath-rate decreases, the
heart-rate markedly increases. Scien
tists are unable to explain fully this
change in the autonomic nervous sys
tem, which seems to be the opposite of
what one would expect.
The reason a person derivesany ben
efit from meditation at all is simply be
cause it supposedly alleviates his own
basic human sufferings, which have
three causes:
• Desire — the wish to repeat good
experiences.
• Aversion — the fear of pain.
• Confusion — not knowing what is
going on within oneself.

These problems, and especially the
problem of confusion, can be cured by
extending one's awareness to normal
automatic functions, such as breathing.
The three sources of suffering cause
people to be constantly thinking of out
side, spiritually unimportant things,
which Peterman referred to as "mind
weeds."
Meditation tries to find a general
solution applicable to any problem
within oneself. The people who benefit
the most from it are those who have the
most of these "weeds," or outside
motivations that cause suffering, such
as mid-terms, romance and dorm food.
The main difficulty with this medita
tion form is that it requires a conscious
effort to continuously concentrate on
breathing. Peterman conceded the dif
ficulty involved but said that in learning
to relax "you want to make an effort
and then forget about the effort."
