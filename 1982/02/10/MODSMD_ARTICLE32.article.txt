# Seeking the perfect video game

Hands twitching. BOING! Eyes fixed
straight ahead. BEEP! Shoulders tensed
with concentration. BZZZ! Alien invaders
are destroyed. SPLATT!
These are the sights and sounds of the
video mania that is sweeping across the
country. And the Stanford community is
not immune.
Debuting as a pinball-like diversion,
video games have now developed a so
phistication and a following all their own.
A video game may be the workings of a
small home computer hooked up to a tele
vision set; or it may be a bigger than life

games offer challenges at
all levels of skill and
coordination.

Complete with flashing lights, futuristic
graphics and space age themes, video
games offer challenges at all levels of skill
and coordination.

The Tresidder Recreational Center
boasts 22 video games... favorites such as
Tempest, Centipede, Pacman and Missile
Command. And more are on the way.
"The ratio of pinball games to video was
15 to five. Now the ratio has more than re
versed . . . We've moved the billiard tables
just to make room for more," said Dave
Huston, a Rec Center employee.
Cheryl St. Clair, the Rec Center man
ager, has seen people packed four or five
deep on all the machines. "People are will
ing to wait endlessly when you first get a
new machine," she said.
"There are people who are here eight
straight hours without leaving. Some stay
10 to 12 hours. (But) all are specialists ob
sessed with one game. Missile Command
has the biggest long-play addicts, but
women tend to favor Centipede and Pac
man," Huston observed.
The Rec Center staff notes that the
"place is especially busy between 7 p.m.
and 10 p.m.... and very packed Friday and
Saturday nights." Most video enthusiasts
are male, and about 25 percent of the
players are under 18.
Rich Biedenweg, a University staff mem
ber, is quick to deny any addiction to these
games, but he does like them. "They have
a clever design, and the way they're engi
neered is really great. You need some time
out to concentrate on little dots on the
screen instead of work," he explained.
Freshman Richard Nagareda was a pin
ball fan until he was lured away by the so
phistication of video games. "Tempest is
my favorite. It takes a lot of coordination.
It's exciting and it's a challenge. And the

noises are the excitement of it."
And the games themselves keep getting
more and more sophisticated. St. Clair
hypothesized that these more com
plicated games are introduced gradually

'There are people who
are here eight straight
hours without leaving.
Some stay 70 to 12 hours.
(But) all are specialists
obsessed with one game • • •

so as not to flood the market, as well as to
build up the needed skill levels.
Video games, as addicting as chocolate
or T.V., can be much more costly. At 25
cents a game, "video carries this place,"
Huston commented, "it's amazing the
number of kids that will whip out a S2O bill
days in a row."
St. Clair estimated that the rec Center
supplies at least $4000-55000 worth of
change for the games each week. "And
that's a conservative estimate," she added.
And the more you play, the more you
become addicted. Maurice Miller, an em
ployee, estimated that in five hours of
playing, he spends about $15.
John Christensen, an undergraduate
thinking about engineering, visits the Rec
Center as a study break, to play the games
and to watch. "I never liked pinball games.
Never played until video came around."

VIDEO MANIA — A new disease strikes Stanford. According to Rec Center workers,
students spend hours at the controls and keep coming back for more.
Hands twitching. BOING! Eyes fixed
straight ahead. BEEP! Shoulders tensed
with concentration. BZZZ! Alien invaders
are destroyed. SPLATT!
These are the sights and sounds of the
video mania that is sweeping across the
country. And the Stanford community is
not immune.
Debuting as a pinball-like diversion,
video games have now developed a so
phistication and a following all their own.
A video game may be the workings of a
small home computer hooked up to a tele
vision set; or it may be a bigger than life

The Tresidder Recreational Center
boasts 22 video games... favorites such as
Tempest, Centipede, Pacman and Missile
Command. And more are on the way.
"The ratio of pinball games to video was
15 to five. Now the ratio has more than re
versed . . . We've moved the billiard tables
just to make room for more," said Dave
Huston, a Rec Center employee.
Cheryl St. Clair, the Rec Center man
ager, has seen people packed four or five
deep on all the machines. "People are will
ing to wait endlessly when you first get a
new machine," she said.
"There are people who are here eight
straight hours without leaving. Some stay
10 to 12 hours. (But) all are specialists ob
sessed with one game. Missile Command
has the biggest long-play addicts, but
women tend to favor Centipede and Pac
man," Huston observed.
The Rec Center staff notes that the
"place is especially busy between 7 p.m.
and 10 p.m.... and very packed Friday and
Saturday nights." Most video enthusiasts
are male, and about 25 percent of the
players are under 18.
Rich Biedenweg, a University staff mem
ber, is quick to deny any addiction to these
games, but he does like them. "They have
a clever design, and the way they're engi
neered is really great. You need some time
out to concentrate on little dots on the
screen instead of work," he explained.
Freshman Richard Nagareda was a pin
ball fan until he was lured away by the so
phistication of video games. "Tempest is
my favorite. It takes a lot of coordination.
It's exciting and it's a challenge. And the

noises are the excitement of it."
And the games themselves keep getting
more and more sophisticated. St. Clair
hypothesized that these more com
plicated games are introduced gradually
