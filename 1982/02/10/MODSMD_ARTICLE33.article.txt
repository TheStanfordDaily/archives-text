# Senior Survey
## 1981 Undergraduate Studies Survey Sample results show most Stanford seniors 
### 
Following is a text of the Senior Class Suruey of 1980-81 from
the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate
Studies:
The Senior Survey is an annual attempt by the Office of the
Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Studies to ascertain
the retrospective views of seniors concerning the various
aspects of their undergraduate experience. The survey has four
parts. The first pertains to assessments by seniors of the
undergraduate program, their general experiences with the
faculty and administration, their competence in broad areas,
and the results of this portion of the survey constitute the
subject matter of the present report.
The second part of the survey, prepared and compiled at the
Academic Information Center, reviews students' professional
school plans. This is intended to provide undergraduates and
their advisors with information about the success of Stanford
students in gaining admission to particular programs. The
results are available for reference at the Academic Information
Center.
The third part of the survey elicits students' views concerning
particularly outstanding or poor departmental and faculty
performances. These results are not made public but are
conveyed confidentially to department chairmen and senior
academic officers of the University. Department chairmen are
encouraged to share this information with their faculty at their
own discretion but not to incorporate it in departmental faculty
folders or otherwise keep it on file.
The fourth part ot the survey consists of essays by the
respondents on what constitutes an educated person and how
they assess themselves in this regard.
The 1981 survey questionnaire was answered by 764 graduat
ing students, some 48% of the graduating class. This year the
return rate was somewhat higher than in previous years because
students in the Study of Undergraduate Experience at Stanford
(SUES), a separate research project of this office, were also re
spondents for the Senior Survey.
In comparing the senior survey population with the graduating
class as a whole, once again we find that the respondents quite
faithfully match the larger population in most background charac
teristics. About 43% pf the 1980-81 graduates sample were wo
men, and 43% of the survey population were women. Similarly,
14% of the class were transfer students, while 13% of the survey
population were transfer students. The distribution of students
across the major departments of the university was also similar
between the two groups. These figures give us confidence that the
survey results provide a meaningful picture of the views of the
entire graduating class.
As shown in the two data summary tables, the results are
subsumed under three broad categories: Table 1, Part A deals
with general aspects of the undergraduate program; Part B deals
with student interaction with faculty and staff. For the first time,
the items and scales used in this part of the survey were identical
this year to the set used last year, so that we can look at the
stability of results over time and begin monitoring trends in
student evaluations of their education.
Table 2 presents self-ratings by students of their abilities iri a
wide variety of areas that cover the entire scope of our general
educatin program. Items 3 through 11 in this list query the
specific areas which now encompass the new distribution
requirements, including the Western culture requirement.
Actually, earlier versions of these area designations in previous
senior surveys provided the basis of what became the current
distribution area categories. These items were also identical this
year to the set of items used last year, and they provide us with a
basis for studying the effects of the new distribution requirements
over time.
The assessments of the undergraduate program and person
nel were made from three perspectives: absolute evaluations of
items, evaluations relative to students' expectations concerning
the items, and evaluations of the importance of the items to each
student. Hence, for example, each student indicated an absolute
evaluation of the faculty as teachers, an evaluation of the faculty
as teachers relative to the student's expectations for the faculty
as teachers, and an evaluation of the importance of faculty
teaching quality. The assessments of student abilities likewise
included three perspectives: absolute evaluations, evaluations
of the "degree of improvement" since the student entered
Stanford, and the importance of the ability to the student.
The summary results given here present, first, some highlights
of student evaluations of the undergraduate program and its
faculty and staff; second, the more important results wih respect to
students' assessments of their abilities; third, some analyses of
differences between men and women and among sudents of

different schools in the university; and fourth, a brief section on
students' plans for the year immediately following graduation. To
save space the data table for the third section is not reproduced
here, but it is available for those who are interested in this informa
tion.
Evaluations of the Undergraduate Program
(Table 1)
The overall quality of undergraduate education was rated as
'good'or 'excellent' by 93% of the respondents. The correspond
ing figure for the adequacy of Stanford's "general or liberal
education" was 66%. This is an indication that a sizeable
proportion of students felt that the quality of their liberal educa
tion (which we believe they interpret as referring to their aca
demic work outside the major department) was a good deal
lower than the quality of the undergraduate program in general.
The adequacy of training for graduate or professional schools
was rated highly (that is, as good or excellent) by 71% of the
respondents. These items taken together suggest that students
were quite positive about the academic aspects of the under
graduate program (see Table 1, Part A).
In addition, students' living environments were seen as
contributing positively to their academic development, both at
the home campus and, even more, at the overseas campuses:
52% said that their campus living arrangement contributed
highly to their intellectual life, and fully 89% of the students who
attended an overseas campus felt that their experiences there
were good or excellent. It is noteworthy that 71% of these
students felt that the overseas experience was better or much
better than they had expected. The overall picture is, thus,
highly positive.
This image is somewhat clouded, however, when we turn to
assessments of the faculty and staff (Table 1, Part B). Faculty
were clearly viewed as high quality scholars and researchers,
with 93% of the responses at the high end of the scale for this
item. But faculty teaching was rated less highly (59% of the
responses were 'good' or 'excellent' while 9% were 'poor' or 'very
poor'), and this was especially true with respect to students'
expectations: 38% of students felt the faculty as teachers were
'worse' or 'much worse' than expected. Teaching assistants
were also evaluated much less highly than the undergraduate
program as a whole. We are left with a bit of a paradox: students
seem to rate the undergraduate program as of considerably
higher quality than the instructors who conduct it.
Assessments of the faculty were ambivalent in other dimen
sions as well. The opportunities for individual work with faculty
were considered very great, and much better than expected, by
most students. But as advisors the faculty was disappointing to
the students, especially for freshmen and sophomores who had
not yet declared a major. 48%0f respondents said that their first
advisors were 'poor' or 'very poor,' and 60% said that these
advisors were 'worse' or 'much worse' than they had expected.
Opinions were considerably more positive for the major advisors,
with only 30% of students describing them as 'poor' or 'very
poor' and 41% saying that they were 'good' or 'excellent'
(compared to 28% for their initial advisors). The difference here
is probably related to the different tasks expected of these two
sets of advisors.
Turning briefly to the importance of these aspects of students'
academic experiences, we see generally that items were con
sidered of at least moderate importance by nearly all students,
and most students considered most items of 'great' or 'very
great' importance.
The items concerning the undergraduate program considered
of greatest importance were the overall quality of undergraduate
education, the general quality of courses in the major, and the
overseas campus experiencesâ€”all items that were rated highly
by the students on the absolute scale.
With respect to the faculty and staff, the most important item
(94% responding that it was of 'great' or 'very great' importance)
was the quality of the faculty as teachers, while the quality of the
faculty as researchers was of far less importance. It is worth
pointing out that the quality of teaching assistants was of only
average importance, so that the lack of student enthusiasm for
teaching assistant capabilities was of less importance than
student disappointment with faculty teaching abilities.
Finally, all of the items concerning the faculty and staff, with
the exception of faculty teaching quality, were considered of
much less importance than the items concerning the under
graduate program as a whole. Thus, to round out the picture
portrayed above, one can say that the undergraduate program
as a whole was perceived more positively, and as having greater
significance, than were the quality of the instructors and the
importance to the students of the instructor quality.
It is as if the students were saying, "I got a very good education
at Stanford, and it means a lot to me. Not all of the professors
were outstanding teachers or good advisors, but these short
comings did not affect my educational experience that much.

Assessments of Abilities
(Table 2)
Graduating seniors had moderate to high opinions of their
skills and abilities over the whole range of areas named on the
questionnaire. Only a handful of items received responses of
'poor' or 'very poor' from more than 20% of the respondents;
similarily, for most items, only 15% to 20% of respondents were
sufficiently bold to characterize their skills as 'excellent.'
The most striking assessment concerned the ability to "write
clear English prose," where a total of 80% said that they had
'good' or 'excellent' skills. A strong majority of students gave
high ratings for their ability to "make judgments about interna
tional problems facing the country," and their ability to "under
stand social processes and institutions."
Students also had very positive opinions of their abilities in
two more general areas used for the first time on this year's
questionnaire: their abilities to "absorb and analyze information"
(fully 92% rating themselves highly here) and to "use your
creative faculties" (71% giving 'good' or 'excellent' responses).
The ratings on these two items were higher than nearly all other
items; it is interesting to note, however, that students see
themselves as much better at "analyzing information" than at
using their "creative faculties." Interestingly enough, it was
precisely those areas in which students assessed their abilities
most positively that were also considered of greatest importance,
with the ability to write well again topping the list.
The converse finding was also true: those areas deemed of
least importance were also those for which the respondents
assessed their abilities as weakest. Thus, only 42% of the
students felt that they had 'good' or 'excellent' ability to use
computers, and only 45% felt this item to be of great importance.
The corresponding figures for the ability to use a foreign lan
guage effectively were 42% and 48% respectively.
Other areas in which the ability was considered least impor
tant included understanding mathematical sciences, under
standing a non-Western culture, and understanding the develop-

ment of Western culture (37%, 40%, and 47%, respectively, at the
high end of the scale for these items). With the exception of the
mathematical sciences item, students also perceived their
abilities as relatively poor in these items.
The items relating to Western and non Western cultures as
general subjects of study reflected the lower ratings mentioned
earlier for the adequacy of the liberal education program at
Stanfordâ€”in particular, students felts less competent with
respect to areas of study that focus on the world outside the
U.S., and they thought that these areas were of less importance
than other areas.
Most of the responses concerning the degree of improvement
of student abilities at Stanford centered around the 'moderate'
and 'great' responses, with a rather normal distribution across
the other response categories. There was a fairly close
correspondence between the absolute evaluations of abilities,
the importance of the items, and the degree of improvement at
Stanford.
Thus, for example, three of the ability items receiving the most
positive absolute ratingsâ€”understanding the natural sciences,
understanding social processes and institutions, and making
judgments about international problemsâ€”also stood high in the
assessments of degree of improvement.
One exception here was the ability to make use of computers.
While only 42% of respondents said they had 'good'or 'excellent'
computer skills, 58% felt they had improved 'greatly' or 'very
greatly' at Stanford. At the same time, 18% of respondents said
that they had improved in this ability only 'very slightly;' few
other items had such a hish percentage in thiscategory. Another
exception was the ability to write English well, for which
relatively few students indicated much improvement at Stanford.
Items for which the degree of improvement was least included
the ability to use a foreign language (44% "slight" or "very slight"
development of Western culture (34%).
These findings provide further evidence of the necessity of the
recent revisions of the distribution requirements and the institu
tion of the Western Culture requirement. The findings on
