# Campus Digest

### Jane McConnell 
UEditors note: This is the debut of a
I npw regular feature for the Inside
| plges called Campus Digest. Cam
mtis Digest will be a place for readers
to learn what's going on at other col
t legos and universities across the
I country. We expect readers to be in-
Kf/gued and possibly surprised at the
»mtiilarities and differences between
the events at these schools and life at
the Farm. Daily staffers ]ane McCon
i nell and Fran Miller, who are compil
ing Campus Digest, promise these
i tidbits may sometimes be funny, se
rious or even obscure — but always
" interesting.
Food connoisseurs may be
pleased to learn that complaints
about dorm food service are not
Unique to Stanford. Students at
Eastern College in Charleston, Illi
nois have similar complaints about
their food service, and the food ser
vice employees responded with
their views in an article appearing in
the Daily Eastern News Jan. 29. One
supervisor said she often gets an
noyed when she sees how much
food students waste, and notes that
the amount of waste seems to grow
greater around finals. "Sometimes I
think they do it just for the heck of it
because of the way they mess it up."
Another commented, "Some
times I think they complain just to
get attention." Said another, "Spring
is a difficult time for us. Everyone is
in a bad mood and the weather isn't
good, so we like to have a lot of spe
cial meals."
Are the students at Eastern merely
letting off steam, or are their com

plaints justified? Another story
pages later tells of a dead rat found in
one of the residence hall salad bars.
The rat, however, is suspected to
have been placed there as part of a
fraternity prank, although there is no
evidence to support this. The inci
dent is currently under investiga
tion.

A popular beer-drinking game has
turned into a medical nightmare for
some University of lowa students,
who are showing up in increasing
number of lowa City's University
Hopitals because they have swal
lowed quarters. Several students
have required surgery to remove the
coins, which can become lodged in
the esophagus or between the stom
ach and intestines. "Most are pretty
lucky," said physician Robert
Hegeman. "They swallow the quar
ter and pass it in a few days. Whether
the quarter is passed depends on the
size of the person." Hegeman said

he has treated between 15 and 20
students since the beginning of the
school term. He said most of his pa
tients "are pretty embarrassed when
they come in because they know
they have swallowed the coin."

20-25) wanted for vacation in Hawaii.

From the University Daily Kansan,
we have the following quiz: "What
famous Republican president has six
letters in his last name, enjoyed the
reputation of being a very nice man
and told Americans not to worry
about his economic policy because
the system would work if they gave it
the chance? Answer: Herbert Hoo
ver." Watch it, Kansas, he happens to
be the only president to have gradu
ated from Stanford . . .

A Harvard researcher was nabbed
for fraud last week, the MIT Tech is
quick to point out. Harvard Medical

School Researcher Dr. John Darsee
was found guilty of falsifying much
of his research data over a year-long
period. Darsee's fellowship has been
terminated and his faculty appoint
ment withdrawn. The Tech also
notes, "MIT has no procedure to
deal with such cases, said Provost
Francis Low, because there has never
been a need for one. 'As far as I
know, such things have never hap
pened at MIT,' he said. 'Errors hap
pen, and false hopes arise, but as far
as I know, they get stopped in time.'
Former Provost Walter Rosenbleth,
Institute Professor, agreed that no
comparable case has occurred at
MIT in years, if ever." Good for you,
MIT.

So what's the big news around
Harvard these days? It seems one of
the major concerns is trying to estab
lish "microcosms of the College"
among the various undergraduate
houses on campus, according to an
article in the Harvard Crimson. Dean
Fox has expressed concern that the
Houses show disparities in grade,
sex, race, and athletic distribution.
Fox's ideal is to have each house a
model of the College itself, and he
suggests such measures as random
House assignments, quotas and re
cruiting to rectify the situation.
Fox cites a statistically significant
correlation between the number of
varsity athletes and the percentage
of House residents with lower
grades, saying, "It's hard to spend all
your time on the playing field and
still make good grades."
