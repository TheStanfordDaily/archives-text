lP'i:
Differences by Area of Study and Sex.
1 Among the analyses of the responses from various subsets of
the respondent population, two dimensions of special interest
are those of the area of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex. In
the first case, the responses allow us to assess the various
v schools as they were perceived by those majoring in departments
P: within them; in the second case we learn more about the
students themselves through comparisons of the responses
' made by women with those made by men.
A Differences among schools
*-§ We have grouped the majors into five 'schools:' engineering,
humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and interdepart
# mental programs. A sixth school, earth sciences, was also
. i included in the analyses, but the number of students in this
school was so small that there is little stability in the statistics for
• them
|C Students majoring in humanities departments gave the highest
overall evaluations for various aspects of their coursework and
/' experience in their major departments, nearly all of them (83%)
w rating the courses in their major as'good'or'excellent'and most
| (71%) rating the faculty highly as teachers. They also rated their
■£' major advisors relatively highly (44% of the responses at the top
112 two points).
Bp?" Natural science majors gave the lowest overall ratings, with
v: their major courses receiving high ratings from 59% of these
students while the faculty as teachers were rated highly by 51%
»•s'. and major advisors by 31%. Engineering majors rated their
w department courses and advisors very highly but gave average
ratings for the faculty as teachers (58%f0r the top two categories
mjk. on the scale).

Social science and interdepartmental majors gave more
mixed evaluations, rating faculty teaching quality relatively
highly but giving very low evaluations of their major advisors or
courses. The most positive evaluations of teaching assistants
came from engineering majors (46% 'good' or 'excellent'
responses), while the humanities and social science majors gave
the lowest responses (30% and 27%, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors gave relatively less positive
ratings for the adequacy of their training for graduate or
professional school (68% for the top two categories), while
natural science and engineering majors gave the highest
responses (85% for each). Social science and interdepartmental
majors also gave relatively low responses on this dimension.
The full import of this contrast is revealed by the finding that
the humanities and social science majors felt that they received
the most adequate liberal education (79%and 73%, respectively,
in the top categories), while the engineering and natural science
majors felt much less satisfied in this area (41% and 58%).
In sum, humanities majors rated their departments highly and
felt that their liberal education was very good, but that their
training for further education was not totally adequate; while the
engineering and natural science felt that their programs were
quite good and trained them well, but did not provide an
adequate liberal education. The social science and interdepart
mental majors tended to fall in between these two extremes.
With respect to perceptions of abilities, the results provide
few surprises. Engineering and natural science majors gave
themselves much higher ratings than other majors for such
abilities as understanding mathematical sciences, making use of
computers, understanding technology and applied sciences,
and the like; while humanities majors rated themselves more
highly for such abilities as understanding literature and fine arts,
understanding anon-Western culture, and soon. Social science
majors rated their ability to understand social processes and
institutions, understand the workings of government, and make
judgments about international problems more highly than did
other majors. All of these findings are in line with our expectations
about the various schools.

The final two ability items, new to the survey this year,
produced rather interesting results. With respect to the ability to
"absorb and analyze information," differences were not great
but the natural science majors led the way with 97% saying they
had high ability here, followed by engineering students at 95%;
lowest in this area were humanities majors at 88%.
By contrast, in the use of creativity the humanities majors led
the way with 79% saying they had high ability here, followed by
social science majors (71%) and engineering majors (69%) and, at
the bottom of this ranking, natural science students (63%).
There is a clear perception of some degree of conflict between
analytical and creative abilities among Stanford seniors.
B. Sex Differences
There were few significant differences between men and
women with respect to their ratings of the undergraduate pro
gram and the faculty and staff. Men rated the adequacy of their
training for further education and their experiences overseas
slightly higher than did women, as many as 12% more men giving
these items a rating of excellent. Women, on the other hand,
gave more positive evaluations for their major advisors; the
quality of teaching assistants; and the opportunities for individ
ual work; but for these items the differences were even smaller.
There were few sex-related differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the undergraduate program and
faculty relative to their expectations. However, women rated
nearly all of these items as being of greater importance to them
than did men; ten to twenty percent more women gave
responses of 'great' or 'very great' importance for many of these
items, with the biggest differences found for the importance of
the quality of the liberal education, and the importance of the
major advisor. Hence, women cared more about the various
aspects of their undergraduate education, even though they
rated their education similarly to the way men did and they felt
roughly the same degree of satisfaction relative to their expecta
tions as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, the sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rated their own abilities more highly than
women rated their own abilities in the areas of mathematical
sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences;
using computers; and making judgments about international
problems. The percentage of men rating themselves as 'good' or
'excellent' ofi these items was 10 to 23 points greater than the
corresponding figure for women. Likewise, women rated them
selves more highly (by about 9 to 16 points) for their abilities to
use a foreign language and to understand literature and fine arts.
On other items (including the items concerning analytical and
creative abilities) there were no sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection of
the uneven distribution of men and women among the various
majors. For instance, as stated earlier, natural science and engi
neering majors generally rated their ability to understand
mathematics higher than did humanities majors. Since men
were overrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering,
we should expect the overall ratings to conform to the traditional
stereotypes (men having higher math ability than women).
However, when we control for the areas of study, sex
differences often persist. Thus, while female natural science
majors rated themselves much more highly than did women in
the humanities for such stereotypical male skills as understanding
math, using computers, and understanding the sciences, they
nevertheless rated themselves less highly in these dimensions
than did males in these majors.
This pattern held up for most of the items for which there were
sex-related differences, with the important exception that worn
en in engineering consistently rated themselves as highly as men
in engineering for all of the math and science areas except the
use of computers.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree of improvement of these
abilities generally corresponded to the ratings of abilities: where
men rated their abilities more highly than did women, they also
rated their degree of improvement higher; and likewise for
women. Also, the importance of the abilities generally cor
responded to the differences in assessments of the abilities: men
attached more importance to the abilities in which they excelled,
and women attached more importance to the abilities in which
they excelled. However, all of the differences in this regard were
quite small.
Plans After Graduation
A little over half (52%) of the respondents said they planned to
work full-time immediately after graduation. Somewhat fewer
(37%) planned to study full-time, with the remainder planning to
travel, work and study, or pursue other activities. These figures
almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
analyses showed that women were more likely to work full-time
after graduation than were men (59% to 46%), with a correspond
ingly larger proportion of men planning to study full time.
Further, there were considerable differences among students
in the various schools. The proportion planning full time work
ranged from a high of 61% for engineering majors to a low of 22%
for natural science majors, with the social science and humanities
majors in between (57% and 53%, respectively). Nearly three
quarters of the natural science majors planned to study full time,
more than twice as large a figure as for the next highest school
(social science majors, 32%). This finding reflects the fact that
many of the natural science majors planned to attend medical
school and were not delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study.

Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate plans
show that the trend toward working full-time has leveled off. The
percentage of students planning to work full time immediately
after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, dropping off slightly the past
two years to 52%. Again we should note that students maintain
high long-term educational aspirations: fully 86% of all 1981
graduating seniors said that they eventually planned to attend
graduate or professional school (or were already in a co-terminal
master's program), a figure quite comparable to those of
previous years.
This year we have added a question asking for three factors
that affected students' plans for the coming year. The results
here are interesting, but again they will have more meaning in
future years as trends in types of responses given by students
develop. For the current group of seniors, the most frequently
mentioned factor was money and financial considerations, given
as one of the three factors by about 35% of the respondents.
Second most frequently mentioned was a category we call the
"desire to escape academics," where about 27% of students
indicated a desire to get out of school and do something else.
Third was personality characteristics, about 24% of the
students saying that some feature of their own personality led
them to pursue some particular course of action.
In order, the next three most often named factors were a
desire to apply knowledge or skills learned at Stanford, academ
ic experiences (such as particular courses or majors that led to
certain future activities), and intellectual interests.
Hence, it appears that factors not directly related to their
undergraduate education were of greatest importance (money,
personality, and a desire to get away from the academic
environment) while their undergraduate experiences constituted
a second tier of important factors.
Interestingly enough, particular individuals (parents, faculty,
friends, etc.) were not among the most important factors
mentioned, though there were at least three students who said
that an "international romance" was the most decisive factor in
their plans—they were going off to Europe to live with someone
they had met while overseas.
Summary
The overall assessment of Stanford undergraduate education
given by graduating seniors in 1981 was quite positive. Students
rated both the undergraduate program and the faculty and staff
highly, and they felt that both their campus living situation and,
even more, their overseas study contributed significantly to their
academic experience.
There was less satisfaction with the faculty as teachers and
genuine dissatisfaction with general advisors. Teaching assistants
also were given relatively low ratings, but for almost all other
items the ratings clustered on the positive end of the scale.
These relatively positive evaluations were generally better
than or equal to students' expectations, and students attached
considerable importance to all of the aspects of their under
graduate training that were covered by the survey.
Students also rated their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they had good or excellent ability
for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major weaknesses
here had to do with students' understanding of Western and
"non-Western culture, foreign languages, computers, and tech
nology. Students also saw their abilities as having improved a
great deal in all areas queried and they viewed these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences among schools, with
humanities students expressing the most satisfaction with their
major programs and departments and natural science majors
expressing the least. Humanities majors also felt they got the
best liberal education, while engineers were least satisfied in this
regard. On the other hand, natural science majors felt very well
trained for further study, as did engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors felt much less adequately
trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to follow the expected lines
based on major area of study, with the engineering and natural
science majors strong in quantitative and "hard science" areas;
the social science majors strong in dimensions directly related to
their disciplines; and humanities majors strongest in humanistic
dimensions.
There were few sex-based differences, especially with respect
to evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the faculty
and staff. The main differences here concerned the importance
attached to items, with women considering most items of
greater importance. Differences in abilities conformed generally
to traditional sex related images in American culture. Evaluations
of improvement in ability and of the importance of the various
abilities generally corresponded to the evaluations of ability:
men claimed to have improved most in areas in which they did
well, and they considered these areas to be of greater importance
The same was true for women.
The 1981 Senior Survey yielded a great deal of information of
considerable value to the university. With the active participation
of graduating seniors and broader institutional discussion of the
results, we hope to make the survey an increasingly useful tool
for university self-assessment and a means of furthering the
excellence of undergraduate education at Stanford.

lP'i:
Differences by Area of Study and Sex.
1 Among the analyses of the responses from various subsets of
the respondent population, two dimensions of special interest
are those of the area of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex. In
the first case, the responses allow us to assess the various
v schools as they were perceived by those majoring in departments
P: within them; in the second case we learn more about the
students themselves through comparisons of the responses
' made by women with those made by men.
A Differences among schools
*-§ We have grouped the majors into five 'schools:' engineering,
humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and interdepart
# mental programs. A sixth school, earth sciences, was also
. i included in the analyses, but the number of students in this
school was so small that there is little stability in the statistics for
• them
|C Students majoring in humanities departments gave the highest
overall evaluations for various aspects of their coursework and
/' experience in their major departments, nearly all of them (83%)
w rating the courses in their major as'good'or'excellent'and most
| (71%) rating the faculty highly as teachers. They also rated their
■£' major advisors relatively highly (44% of the responses at the top
112 two points).
Bp?" Natural science majors gave the lowest overall ratings, with
v: their major courses receiving high ratings from 59% of these
students while the faculty as teachers were rated highly by 51%
»•s'. and major advisors by 31%. Engineering majors rated their
w department courses and advisors very highly but gave average
ratings for the faculty as teachers (58%f0r the top two categories
mjk. on the scale).

Social science and interdepartmental majors gave more
mixed evaluations, rating faculty teaching quality relatively
highly but giving very low evaluations of their major advisors or
courses. The most positive evaluations of teaching assistants
came from engineering majors (46% 'good' or 'excellent'
responses), while the humanities and social science majors gave
the lowest responses (30% and 27%, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors gave relatively less positive
ratings for the adequacy of their training for graduate or
professional school (68% for the top two categories), while
natural science and engineering majors gave the highest
responses (85% for each). Social science and interdepartmental
majors also gave relatively low responses on this dimension.
The full import of this contrast is revealed by the finding that
the humanities and social science majors felt that they received
the most adequate liberal education (79%and 73%, respectively,
in the top categories), while the engineering and natural science
majors felt much less satisfied in this area (41% and 58%).
In sum, humanities majors rated their departments highly and
felt that their liberal education was very good, but that their
training for further education was not totally adequate; while the
engineering and natural science felt that their programs were
quite good and trained them well, but did not provide an
adequate liberal education. The social science and interdepart
mental majors tended to fall in between these two extremes.
With respect to perceptions of abilities, the results provide
few surprises. Engineering and natural science majors gave
themselves much higher ratings than other majors for such
abilities as understanding mathematical sciences, making use of
computers, understanding technology and applied sciences,
and the like; while humanities majors rated themselves more
highly for such abilities as understanding literature and fine arts,
understanding anon-Western culture, and soon. Social science
majors rated their ability to understand social processes and
institutions, understand the workings of government, and make
judgments about international problems more highly than did
other majors. All of these findings are in line with our expectations
about the various schools.

The final two ability items, new to the survey this year,
produced rather interesting results. With respect to the ability to
"absorb and analyze information," differences were not great
but the natural science majors led the way with 97% saying they
had high ability here, followed by engineering students at 95%;
lowest in this area were humanities majors at 88%.
By contrast, in the use of creativity the humanities majors led
the way with 79% saying they had high ability here, followed by
social science majors (71%) and engineering majors (69%) and, at
the bottom of this ranking, natural science students (63%).
There is a clear perception of some degree of conflict between
analytical and creative abilities among Stanford seniors.
B. Sex Differences
There were few significant differences between men and
women with respect to their ratings of the undergraduate pro
gram and the faculty and staff. Men rated the adequacy of their
training for further education and their experiences overseas
slightly higher than did women, as many as 12% more men giving
these items a rating of excellent. Women, on the other hand,
gave more positive evaluations for their major advisors; the
quality of teaching assistants; and the opportunities for individ
ual work; but for these items the differences were even smaller.
There were few sex-related differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the undergraduate program and
faculty relative to their expectations. However, women rated
nearly all of these items as being of greater importance to them
than did men; ten to twenty percent more women gave
responses of 'great' or 'very great' importance for many of these
items, with the biggest differences found for the importance of
the quality of the liberal education, and the importance of the
major advisor. Hence, women cared more about the various
aspects of their undergraduate education, even though they
rated their education similarly to the way men did and they felt
roughly the same degree of satisfaction relative to their expecta
tions as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, the sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rated their own abilities more highly than
women rated their own abilities in the areas of mathematical
sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences;
using computers; and making judgments about international
problems. The percentage of men rating themselves as 'good' or
'excellent' ofi these items was 10 to 23 points greater than the
corresponding figure for women. Likewise, women rated them
selves more highly (by about 9 to 16 points) for their abilities to
use a foreign language and to understand literature and fine arts.
On other items (including the items concerning analytical and
creative abilities) there were no sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection of
the uneven distribution of men and women among the various
majors. For instance, as stated earlier, natural science and engi
neering majors generally rated their ability to understand
mathematics higher than did humanities majors. Since men
were overrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering,
we should expect the overall ratings to conform to the traditional
stereotypes (men having higher math ability than women).
However, when we control for the areas of study, sex
differences often persist. Thus, while female natural science
majors rated themselves much more highly than did women in
the humanities for such stereotypical male skills as understanding
math, using computers, and understanding the sciences, they
nevertheless rated themselves less highly in these dimensions
than did males in these majors.
This pattern held up for most of the items for which there were
sex-related differences, with the important exception that worn
en in engineering consistently rated themselves as highly as men
in engineering for all of the math and science areas except the
use of computers.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree of improvement of these
abilities generally corresponded to the ratings of abilities: where
men rated their abilities more highly than did women, they also
rated their degree of improvement higher; and likewise for
women. Also, the importance of the abilities generally cor
responded to the differences in assessments of the abilities: men
attached more importance to the abilities in which they excelled,
and women attached more importance to the abilities in which
they excelled. However, all of the differences in this regard were
quite small.
Plans After Graduation
A little over half (52%) of the respondents said they planned to
work full-time immediately after graduation. Somewhat fewer
(37%) planned to study full-time, with the remainder planning to
travel, work and study, or pursue other activities. These figures
almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
analyses showed that women were more likely to work full-time
after graduation than were men (59% to 46%), with a correspond
ingly larger proportion of men planning to study full time.
Further, there were considerable differences among students
in the various schools. The proportion planning full time work
ranged from a high of 61% for engineering majors to a low of 22%
for natural science majors, with the social science and humanities
majors in between (57% and 53%, respectively). Nearly three
quarters of the natural science majors planned to study full time,
more than twice as large a figure as for the next highest school
(social science majors, 32%). This finding reflects the fact that
many of the natural science majors planned to attend medical
school and were not delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study.

Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate plans
show that the trend toward working full-time has leveled off. The
percentage of students planning to work full time immediately
after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, dropping off slightly the past
two years to 52%. Again we should note that students maintain
high long-term educational aspirations: fully 86% of all 1981
graduating seniors said that they eventually planned to attend
graduate or professional school (or were already in a co-terminal
master's program), a figure quite comparable to those of
previous years.
This year we have added a question asking for three factors
that affected students' plans for the coming year. The results
here are interesting, but again they will have more meaning in
future years as trends in types of responses given by students
develop. For the current group of seniors, the most frequently
mentioned factor was money and financial considerations, given
as one of the three factors by about 35% of the respondents.
Second most frequently mentioned was a category we call the
"desire to escape academics," where about 27% of students
indicated a desire to get out of school and do something else.
Third was personality characteristics, about 24% of the
students saying that some feature of their own personality led
them to pursue some particular course of action.
In order, the next three most often named factors were a
desire to apply knowledge or skills learned at Stanford, academ
ic experiences (such as particular courses or majors that led to
certain future activities), and intellectual interests.
Hence, it appears that factors not directly related to their
undergraduate education were of greatest importance (money,
personality, and a desire to get away from the academic
environment) while their undergraduate experiences constituted
a second tier of important factors.
Interestingly enough, particular individuals (parents, faculty,
friends, etc.) were not among the most important factors
mentioned, though there were at least three students who said
that an "international romance" was the most decisive factor in
their plans—they were going off to Europe to live with someone
they had met while overseas.
Summary
The overall assessment of Stanford undergraduate education
given by graduating seniors in 1981 was quite positive. Students
rated both the undergraduate program and the faculty and staff
highly, and they felt that both their campus living situation and,
even more, their overseas study contributed significantly to their
academic experience.
There was less satisfaction with the faculty as teachers and
genuine dissatisfaction with general advisors. Teaching assistants
also were given relatively low ratings, but for almost all other
items the ratings clustered on the positive end of the scale.
These relatively positive evaluations were generally better
than or equal to students' expectations, and students attached
considerable importance to all of the aspects of their under
graduate training that were covered by the survey.
Students also rated their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they had good or excellent ability
for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major weaknesses
here had to do with students' understanding of Western and
"non-Western culture, foreign languages, computers, and tech
nology. Students also saw their abilities as having improved a
great deal in all areas queried and they viewed these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences among schools, with
humanities students expressing the most satisfaction with their
major programs and departments and natural science majors
expressing the least. Humanities majors also felt they got the
best liberal education, while engineers were least satisfied in this
regard. On the other hand, natural science majors felt very well
trained for further study, as did engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors felt much less adequately
trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to follow the expected lines
based on major area of study, with the engineering and natural
science majors strong in quantitative and "hard science" areas;
the social science majors strong in dimensions directly related to
their disciplines; and humanities majors strongest in humanistic
dimensions.
There were few sex-based differences, especially with respect
to evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the faculty
and staff. The main differences here concerned the importance
attached to items, with women considering most items of
greater importance. Differences in abilities conformed generally
to traditional sex related images in American culture. Evaluations
of improvement in ability and of the importance of the various
abilities generally corresponded to the evaluations of ability:
men claimed to have improved most in areas in which they did
well, and they considered these areas to be of greater importance
The same was true for women.
The 1981 Senior Survey yielded a great deal of information of
considerable value to the university. With the active participation
of graduating seniors and broader institutional discussion of the
results, we hope to make the survey an increasingly useful tool
for university self-assessment and a means of furthering the
excellence of undergraduate education at Stanford.

rated both the undergraduate program and the faculty and staff
highly, and they felt that both their campus living situation and,
even more, their overseas study contributed significantly to their
academic experience.
There was less satisfaction with the faculty as teachers and
genuine dissatisfaction with general advisors. Teaching assistants
also were given relatively low ratings, but for almost all other
items the ratings clustered on the positive end of the scale.
These relatively positive evaluations were generally better
than or equal to students' expectations, and students attached
considerable importance to all of the aspects of their under
graduate training that were covered by the survey.
Students also rated their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they had good or excellent ability
for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major weaknesses
here had to do with students' understanding of Western and
"non-Western culture, foreign languages, computers, and tech
nology. Students also saw their abilities as having improved a
great deal in all areas queried and they viewed these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences among schools, with
humanities students expressing the most satisfaction with their
major programs and departments and natural science majors
expressing the least. Humanities majors also felt they got the
best liberal education, while engineers were least satisfied in this
regard. On the other hand, natural science majors felt very well
trained for further study, as did engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors felt much less adequately
trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to follow the expected lines
based on major area of study, with the engineering and natural
science majors strong in quantitative and "hard science" areas;
the social science majors strong in dimensions directly related to
their disciplines; and humanities majors strongest in humanistic
dimensions.
There were few sex-based differences, especially with respect
to evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the faculty
and staff. The main differences here concerned the importance
attached to items, with women considering most items of
greater importance. Differences in abilities conformed generally
to traditional sex related images in American culture. Evaluations
of improvement in ability and of the importance of the various
abilities generally corresponded to the evaluations of ability:
men claimed to have improved most in areas in which they did
well, and they considered these areas to be of greater importance
The same was true for women.
The 1981 Senior Survey yielded a great deal of information of
considerable value to the university. With the active participation
of graduating seniors and broader institutional discussion of the
results, we hope to make the survey an increasingly useful tool
for university self-assessment and a means of furthering the
excellence of undergraduate education at Stanford.

lP'i:
Differences by Area of Study and Sex.
1 Among the analyses of the responses from various subsets of
the respondent population, two dimensions of special interest
are those of the area of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex. In
the first case, the responses allow us to assess the various
v schools as they were perceived by those majoring in departments
P: within them; in the second case we learn more about the
students themselves through comparisons of the responses
' made by women with those made by men.
A Differences among schools
*-§ We have grouped the majors into five 'schools:' engineering,
humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and interdepart
# mental programs. A sixth school, earth sciences, was also
. i included in the analyses, but the number of students in this
school was so small that there is little stability in the statistics for
• them
|C Students majoring in humanities departments gave the highest
overall evaluations for various aspects of their coursework and
/' experience in their major departments, nearly all of them (83%)
w rating the courses in their major as'good'or'excellent'and most
| (71%) rating the faculty highly as teachers. They also rated their
■£' major advisors relatively highly (44% of the responses at the top
112 two points).
Bp?" Natural science majors gave the lowest overall ratings, with
v: their major courses receiving high ratings from 59% of these
students while the faculty as teachers were rated highly by 51%
»•s'. and major advisors by 31%. Engineering majors rated their
w department courses and advisors very highly but gave average
ratings for the faculty as teachers (58%f0r the top two categories
mjk. on the scale).

Social science and interdepartmental majors gave more
mixed evaluations, rating faculty teaching quality relatively
highly but giving very low evaluations of their major advisors or
courses. The most positive evaluations of teaching assistants
came from engineering majors (46% 'good' or 'excellent'
responses), while the humanities and social science majors gave
the lowest responses (30% and 27%, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors gave relatively less positive
ratings for the adequacy of their training for graduate or
professional school (68% for the top two categories), while
natural science and engineering majors gave the highest
responses (85% for each). Social science and interdepartmental
majors also gave relatively low responses on this dimension.
The full import of this contrast is revealed by the finding that
the humanities and social science majors felt that they received
the most adequate liberal education (79%and 73%, respectively,
in the top categories), while the engineering and natural science
majors felt much less satisfied in this area (41% and 58%).
In sum, humanities majors rated their departments highly and
felt that their liberal education was very good, but that their
training for further education was not totally adequate; while the
engineering and natural science felt that their programs were
quite good and trained them well, but did not provide an
adequate liberal education. The social science and interdepart
mental majors tended to fall in between these two extremes.
With respect to perceptions of abilities, the results provide
few surprises. Engineering and natural science majors gave
themselves much higher ratings than other majors for such
abilities as understanding mathematical sciences, making use of
computers, understanding technology and applied sciences,
and the like; while humanities majors rated themselves more
highly for such abilities as understanding literature and fine arts,
understanding anon-Western culture, and soon. Social science
majors rated their ability to understand social processes and
institutions, understand the workings of government, and make
judgments about international problems more highly than did
other majors. All of these findings are in line with our expectations
about the various schools.

The final two ability items, new to the survey this year,
produced rather interesting results. With respect to the ability to
"absorb and analyze information," differences were not great
but the natural science majors led the way with 97% saying they
had high ability here, followed by engineering students at 95%;
lowest in this area were humanities majors at 88%.
By contrast, in the use of creativity the humanities majors led
the way with 79% saying they had high ability here, followed by
social science majors (71%) and engineering majors (69%) and, at
the bottom of this ranking, natural science students (63%).
There is a clear perception of some degree of conflict between
analytical and creative abilities among Stanford seniors.
B. Sex Differences
There were few significant differences between men and
women with respect to their ratings of the undergraduate pro
gram and the faculty and staff. Men rated the adequacy of their
training for further education and their experiences overseas
slightly higher than did women, as many as 12% more men giving
these items a rating of excellent. Women, on the other hand,
gave more positive evaluations for their major advisors; the
quality of teaching assistants; and the opportunities for individ
ual work; but for these items the differences were even smaller.
There were few sex-related differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the undergraduate program and
faculty relative to their expectations. However, women rated
nearly all of these items as being of greater importance to them
than did men; ten to twenty percent more women gave
responses of 'great' or 'very great' importance for many of these
items, with the biggest differences found for the importance of
the quality of the liberal education, and the importance of the
major advisor. Hence, women cared more about the various
aspects of their undergraduate education, even though they
rated their education similarly to the way men did and they felt
roughly the same degree of satisfaction relative to their expecta
tions as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, the sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rated their own abilities more highly than
women rated their own abilities in the areas of mathematical
sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences;
using computers; and making judgments about international
problems. The percentage of men rating themselves as 'good' or
'excellent' ofi these items was 10 to 23 points greater than the
corresponding figure for women. Likewise, women rated them
selves more highly (by about 9 to 16 points) for their abilities to
use a foreign language and to understand literature and fine arts.
On other items (including the items concerning analytical and
creative abilities) there were no sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection of
the uneven distribution of men and women among the various
majors. For instance, as stated earlier, natural science and engi
neering majors generally rated their ability to understand
mathematics higher than did humanities majors. Since men
were overrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering,
we should expect the overall ratings to conform to the traditional
stereotypes (men having higher math ability than women).
However, when we control for the areas of study, sex
differences often persist. Thus, while female natural science
majors rated themselves much more highly than did women in
the humanities for such stereotypical male skills as understanding
math, using computers, and understanding the sciences, they
nevertheless rated themselves less highly in these dimensions
than did males in these majors.
This pattern held up for most of the items for which there were
sex-related differences, with the important exception that worn
en in engineering consistently rated themselves as highly as men
in engineering for all of the math and science areas except the
use of computers.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree of improvement of these
abilities generally corresponded to the ratings of abilities: where
men rated their abilities more highly than did women, they also
rated their degree of improvement higher; and likewise for
women. Also, the importance of the abilities generally cor
responded to the differences in assessments of the abilities: men
attached more importance to the abilities in which they excelled,
and women attached more importance to the abilities in which
they excelled. However, all of the differences in this regard were
quite small.
Plans After Graduation
A little over half (52%) of the respondents said they planned to
work full-time immediately after graduation. Somewhat fewer
(37%) planned to study full-time, with the remainder planning to
travel, work and study, or pursue other activities. These figures
almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
analyses showed that women were more likely to work full-time
after graduation than were men (59% to 46%), with a correspond
ingly larger proportion of men planning to study full time.
Further, there were considerable differences among students
in the various schools. The proportion planning full time work
ranged from a high of 61% for engineering majors to a low of 22%
for natural science majors, with the social science and humanities
majors in between (57% and 53%, respectively). Nearly three
quarters of the natural science majors planned to study full time,
more than twice as large a figure as for the next highest school
(social science majors, 32%). This finding reflects the fact that
many of the natural science majors planned to attend medical
school and were not delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study.

Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate plans
show that the trend toward working full-time has leveled off. The
percentage of students planning to work full time immediately
after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, dropping off slightly the past
two years to 52%. Again we should note that students maintain
high long-term educational aspirations: fully 86% of all 1981
graduating seniors said that they eventually planned to attend
graduate or professional school (or were already in a co-terminal
master's program), a figure quite comparable to those of
previous years.
This year we have added a question asking for three factors
that affected students' plans for the coming year. The results
here are interesting, but again they will have more meaning in
future years as trends in types of responses given by students
develop. For the current group of seniors, the most frequently
mentioned factor was money and financial considerations, given
as one of the three factors by about 35% of the respondents.
Second most frequently mentioned was a category we call the
"desire to escape academics," where about 27% of students
indicated a desire to get out of school and do something else.
Third was personality characteristics, about 24% of the
students saying that some feature of their own personality led
them to pursue some particular course of action.
In order, the next three most often named factors were a
desire to apply knowledge or skills learned at Stanford, academ
ic experiences (such as particular courses or majors that led to
certain future activities), and intellectual interests.
Hence, it appears that factors not directly related to their
undergraduate education were of greatest importance (money,
personality, and a desire to get away from the academic
environment) while their undergraduate experiences constituted
a second tier of important factors.
Interestingly enough, particular individuals (parents, faculty,
friends, etc.) were not among the most important factors
mentioned, though there were at least three students who said
that an "international romance" was the most decisive factor in
their plans—they were going off to Europe to live with someone
they had met while overseas.
Summary
The overall assessment of Stanford undergraduate education
given by graduating seniors in 1981 was quite positive. Students
rated both the undergraduate program and the faculty and staff
highly, and they felt that both their campus living situation and,
even more, their overseas study contributed significantly to their
academic experience.
There was less satisfaction with the faculty as teachers and
genuine dissatisfaction with general advisors. Teaching assistants
also were given relatively low ratings, but for almost all other
items the ratings clustered on the positive end of the scale.
These relatively positive evaluations were generally better
than or equal to students' expectations, and students attached
considerable importance to all of the aspects of their under
graduate training that were covered by the survey.
Students also rated their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they had good or excellent ability
for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major weaknesses
here had to do with students' understanding of Western and
"non-Western culture, foreign languages, computers, and tech
nology. Students also saw their abilities as having improved a
great deal in all areas queried and they viewed these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences among schools, with
humanities students expressing the most satisfaction with their
major programs and departments and natural science majors
expressing the least. Humanities majors also felt they got the
best liberal education, while engineers were least satisfied in this
regard. On the other hand, natural science majors felt very well
trained for further study, as did engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors felt much less adequately
trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to follow the expected lines
based on major area of study, with the engineering and natural
science majors strong in quantitative and "hard science" areas;
the social science majors strong in dimensions directly related to
their disciplines; and humanities majors strongest in humanistic
dimensions.
There were few sex-based differences, especially with respect
to evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the faculty

greater importance. Differences in abilities conformed generally
to traditional sex related images in American culture. Evaluations
of improvement in ability and of the importance of the various
abilities generally corresponded to the evaluations of ability:
men claimed to have improved most in areas in which they did
well, and they considered these areas to be of greater importance
The same was true for women.
The 1981 Senior Survey yielded a great deal of information of
considerable value to the university. With the active participation
of graduating seniors and broader institutional discussion of the
results, we hope to make the survey an increasingly useful tool
for university self-assessment and a means of furthering the
excellence of undergraduate education at Stanford.

almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
analyses showed that women were more likely to work full-time
after graduation than were men (59% to 46%), with a correspond
ingly larger proportion of men planning to study full time.
Further, there were considerable differences among students
in the various schools. The proportion planning full time work
ranged from a high of 61% for engineering majors to a low of 22%
for natural science majors, with the social science and humanities
majors in between (57% and 53%, respectively). Nearly three
quarters of the natural science majors planned to study full time,
more than twice as large a figure as for the next highest school
(social science majors, 32%). This finding reflects the fact that
many of the natural science majors planned to attend medical
school and were not delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study.

Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate plans
show that the trend toward working full-time has leveled off. The
percentage of students planning to work full time immediately
after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, dropping off slightly the past
two years to 52%. Again we should note that students maintain
high long-term educational aspirations: fully 86% of all 1981
graduating seniors said that they eventually planned to attend
graduate or professional school (or were already in a co-terminal
master's program), a figure quite comparable to those of
previous years.
This year we have added a question asking for three factors
that affected students' plans for the coming year. The results
here are interesting, but again they will have more meaning in
future years as trends in types of responses given by students
develop. For the current group of seniors, the most frequently
mentioned factor was money and financial considerations, given
as one of the three factors by about 35% of the respondents.
Second most frequently mentioned was a category we call the
"desire to escape academics," where about 27% of students
indicated a desire to get out of school and do something else.
Third was personality characteristics, about 24% of the
students saying that some feature of their own personality led
them to pursue some particular course of action.
In order, the next three most often named factors were a
desire to apply knowledge or skills learned at Stanford, academ
ic experiences (such as particular courses or majors that led to
certain future activities), and intellectual interests.
Hence, it appears that factors not directly related to their
undergraduate education were of greatest importance (money,
personality, and a desire to get away from the academic
environment) while their undergraduate experiences constituted
a second tier of important factors.
Interestingly enough, particular individuals (parents, faculty,
friends, etc.) were not among the most important factors
mentioned, though there were at least three students who said
that an "international romance" was the most decisive factor in
their plans—they were going off to Europe to live with someone
they had met while overseas.
Summary
The overall assessment of Stanford undergraduate education
given by graduating seniors in 1981 was quite positive. Students
rated both the undergraduate program and the faculty and staff
highly, and they felt that both their campus living situation and,
even more, their overseas study contributed significantly to their
academic experience.
There was less satisfaction with the faculty as teachers and
genuine dissatisfaction with general advisors. Teaching assistants
also were given relatively low ratings, but for almost all other
items the ratings clustered on the positive end of the scale.
These relatively positive evaluations were generally better
than or equal to students' expectations, and students attached
considerable importance to all of the aspects of their under
graduate training that were covered by the survey.
Students also rated their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they had good or excellent ability
for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major weaknesses
here had to do with students' understanding of Western and
"non-Western culture, foreign languages, computers, and tech
nology. Students also saw their abilities as having improved a
great deal in all areas queried and they viewed these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences among schools, with
humanities students expressing the most satisfaction with their
major programs and departments and natural science majors
expressing the least. Humanities majors also felt they got the
best liberal education, while engineers were least satisfied in this
regard. On the other hand, natural science majors felt very well
trained for further study, as did engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors felt much less adequately
trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to follow the expected lines
based on major area of study, with the engineering and natural
science majors strong in quantitative and "hard science" areas;
the social science majors strong in dimensions directly related to
their disciplines; and humanities majors strongest in humanistic
dimensions.
There were few sex-based differences, especially with respect
to evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the faculty
and staff. The main differences here concerned the importance
attached to items, with women considering most items of
greater importance. Differences in abilities conformed generally
to traditional sex related images in American culture. Evaluations
of improvement in ability and of the importance of the various
abilities generally corresponded to the evaluations of ability:
men claimed to have improved most in areas in which they did
well, and they considered these areas to be of greater importance
The same was true for women.
The 1981 Senior Survey yielded a great deal of information of
considerable value to the university. With the active participation
of graduating seniors and broader institutional discussion of the
results, we hope to make the survey an increasingly useful tool
for university self-assessment and a means of furthering the
excellence of undergraduate education at Stanford.

lP'i:
Differences by Area of Study and Sex.
1 Among the analyses of the responses from various subsets of
the respondent population, two dimensions of special interest
are those of the area of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex. In
the first case, the responses allow us to assess the various
v schools as they were perceived by those majoring in departments
P: within them; in the second case we learn more about the
students themselves through comparisons of the responses
' made by women with those made by men.
A Differences among schools
*-§ We have grouped the majors into five 'schools:' engineering,
humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and interdepart
# mental programs. A sixth school, earth sciences, was also
. i included in the analyses, but the number of students in this
school was so small that there is little stability in the statistics for
• them
|C Students majoring in humanities departments gave the highest
overall evaluations for various aspects of their coursework and
/' experience in their major departments, nearly all of them (83%)
w rating the courses in their major as'good'or'excellent'and most
| (71%) rating the faculty highly as teachers. They also rated their
■£' major advisors relatively highly (44% of the responses at the top
112 two points).
Bp?" Natural science majors gave the lowest overall ratings, with
v: their major courses receiving high ratings from 59% of these
students while the faculty as teachers were rated highly by 51%
»•s'. and major advisors by 31%. Engineering majors rated their
w department courses and advisors very highly but gave average
ratings for the faculty as teachers (58%f0r the top two categories
mjk. on the scale).

Social science and interdepartmental majors gave more
mixed evaluations, rating faculty teaching quality relatively
highly but giving very low evaluations of their major advisors or
courses. The most positive evaluations of teaching assistants
came from engineering majors (46% 'good' or 'excellent'
responses), while the humanities and social science majors gave
the lowest responses (30% and 27%, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors gave relatively less positive
ratings for the adequacy of their training for graduate or
professional school (68% for the top two categories), while
natural science and engineering majors gave the highest
responses (85% for each). Social science and interdepartmental
majors also gave relatively low responses on this dimension.
The full import of this contrast is revealed by the finding that
the humanities and social science majors felt that they received
the most adequate liberal education (79%and 73%, respectively,
in the top categories), while the engineering and natural science
majors felt much less satisfied in this area (41% and 58%).
In sum, humanities majors rated their departments highly and
felt that their liberal education was very good, but that their
training for further education was not totally adequate; while the
engineering and natural science felt that their programs were
quite good and trained them well, but did not provide an
adequate liberal education. The social science and interdepart
mental majors tended to fall in between these two extremes.
With respect to perceptions of abilities, the results provide
few surprises. Engineering and natural science majors gave
themselves much higher ratings than other majors for such
abilities as understanding mathematical sciences, making use of
computers, understanding technology and applied sciences,
and the like; while humanities majors rated themselves more
highly for such abilities as understanding literature and fine arts,
understanding anon-Western culture, and soon. Social science
majors rated their ability to understand social processes and
institutions, understand the workings of government, and make
judgments about international problems more highly than did
other majors. All of these findings are in line with our expectations
about the various schools.

The final two ability items, new to the survey this year,
produced rather interesting results. With respect to the ability to
"absorb and analyze information," differences were not great
but the natural science majors led the way with 97% saying they
had high ability here, followed by engineering students at 95%;
lowest in this area were humanities majors at 88%.
By contrast, in the use of creativity the humanities majors led
the way with 79% saying they had high ability here, followed by
social science majors (71%) and engineering majors (69%) and, at
the bottom of this ranking, natural science students (63%).
There is a clear perception of some degree of conflict between
analytical and creative abilities among Stanford seniors.
B. Sex Differences
There were few significant differences between men and
women with respect to their ratings of the undergraduate pro
gram and the faculty and staff. Men rated the adequacy of their
training for further education and their experiences overseas
slightly higher than did women, as many as 12% more men giving
these items a rating of excellent. Women, on the other hand,
gave more positive evaluations for their major advisors; the
quality of teaching assistants; and the opportunities for individ
ual work; but for these items the differences were even smaller.
There were few sex-related differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the undergraduate program and
faculty relative to their expectations. However, women rated
nearly all of these items as being of greater importance to them
than did men; ten to twenty percent more women gave
responses of 'great' or 'very great' importance for many of these
items, with the biggest differences found for the importance of
the quality of the liberal education, and the importance of the
major advisor. Hence, women cared more about the various
aspects of their undergraduate education, even though they
rated their education similarly to the way men did and they felt
roughly the same degree of satisfaction relative to their expecta
tions as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, the sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rated their own abilities more highly than
women rated their own abilities in the areas of mathematical
sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences;
using computers; and making judgments about international
problems. The percentage of men rating themselves as 'good' or
'excellent' ofi these items was 10 to 23 points greater than the
corresponding figure for women. Likewise, women rated them
selves more highly (by about 9 to 16 points) for their abilities to
use a foreign language and to understand literature and fine arts.
On other items (including the items concerning analytical and
creative abilities) there were no sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection of
the uneven distribution of men and women among the various
majors. For instance, as stated earlier, natural science and engi
neering majors generally rated their ability to understand
mathematics higher than did humanities majors. Since men
were overrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering,
we should expect the overall ratings to conform to the traditional
stereotypes (men having higher math ability than women).
However, when we control for the areas of study, sex
differences often persist. Thus, while female natural science
majors rated themselves much more highly than did women in
the humanities for such stereotypical male skills as understanding
math, using computers, and understanding the sciences, they
nevertheless rated themselves less highly in these dimensions
than did males in these majors.
This pattern held up for most of the items for which there were
sex-related differences, with the important exception that worn
en in engineering consistently rated themselves as highly as men
in engineering for all of the math and science areas except the
use of computers.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree of improvement of these
abilities generally corresponded to the ratings of abilities: where
men rated their abilities more highly than did women, they also
rated their degree of improvement higher; and likewise for
women. Also, the importance of the abilities generally cor
responded to the differences in assessments of the abilities: men
attached more importance to the abilities in which they excelled,
and women attached more importance to the abilities in which
they excelled. However, all of the differences in this regard were
quite small.
Plans After Graduation
A little over half (52%) of the respondents said they planned to
work full-time immediately after graduation. Somewhat fewer
(37%) planned to study full-time, with the remainder planning to
travel, work and study, or pursue other activities. These figures
almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
analyses showed that women were more likely to work full-time
after graduation than were men (59% to 46%), with a correspond
ingly larger proportion of men planning to study full time.
Further, there were considerable differences among students
in the various schools. The proportion planning full time work
ranged from a high of 61% for engineering majors to a low of 22%
for natural science majors, with the social science and humanities
majors in between (57% and 53%, respectively). Nearly three
quarters of the natural science majors planned to study full time,
more than twice as large a figure as for the next highest school
(social science majors, 32%). This finding reflects the fact that
many of the natural science majors planned to attend medical
school and were not delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study.

Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate plans
show that the trend toward working full-time has leveled off. The
percentage of students planning to work full time immediately
after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, dropping off slightly the past
two years to 52%. Again we should note that students maintain
high long-term educational aspirations: fully 86% of all 1981
graduating seniors said that they eventually planned to attend
graduate or professional school (or were already in a co-terminal
master's program), a figure quite comparable to those of
previous years.
This year we have added a question asking for three factors
that affected students' plans for the coming year. The results
here are interesting, but again they will have more meaning in
future years as trends in types of responses given by students
develop. For the current group of seniors, the most frequently
mentioned factor was money and financial considerations, given
as one of the three factors by about 35% of the respondents.
Second most frequently mentioned was a category we call the
"desire to escape academics," where about 27% of students
indicated a desire to get out of school and do something else.
Third was personality characteristics, about 24% of the
students saying that some feature of their own personality led
them to pursue some particular course of action.
In order, the next three most often named factors were a

certain future activities), and intellectual interests.
Hence, it appears that factors not directly related to their

ual work; but for these items the differences were even smaller.
There were few sex-related differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the undergraduate program and
faculty relative to their expectations. However, women rated
nearly all of these items as being of greater importance to them
than did men; ten to twenty percent more women gave
responses of 'great' or 'very great' importance for many of these
items, with the biggest differences found for the importance of
the quality of the liberal education, and the importance of the
major advisor. Hence, women cared more about the various
aspects of their undergraduate education, even though they
rated their education similarly to the way men did and they felt
roughly the same degree of satisfaction relative to their expecta
tions as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, the sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rated their own abilities more highly than
women rated their own abilities in the areas of mathematical
sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences;
using computers; and making judgments about international
problems. The percentage of men rating themselves as 'good' or
'excellent' ofi these items was 10 to 23 points greater than the
corresponding figure for women. Likewise, women rated them
selves more highly (by about 9 to 16 points) for their abilities to
use a foreign language and to understand literature and fine arts.
On other items (including the items concerning analytical and
creative abilities) there were no sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection of
the uneven distribution of men and women among the various
majors. For instance, as stated earlier, natural science and engi
neering majors generally rated their ability to understand
mathematics higher than did humanities majors. Since men
were overrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering,
we should expect the overall ratings to conform to the traditional
stereotypes (men having higher math ability than women).
However, when we control for the areas of study, sex
differences often persist. Thus, while female natural science
majors rated themselves much more highly than did women in
the humanities for such stereotypical male skills as understanding
math, using computers, and understanding the sciences, they
nevertheless rated themselves less highly in these dimensions
than did males in these majors.
This pattern held up for most of the items for which there were
sex-related differences, with the important exception that worn
en in engineering consistently rated themselves as highly as men
in engineering for all of the math and science areas except the
use of computers.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree of improvement of these
abilities generally corresponded to the ratings of abilities: where
men rated their abilities more highly than did women, they also
rated their degree of improvement higher; and likewise for
women. Also, the importance of the abilities generally cor
responded to the differences in assessments of the abilities: men
attached more importance to the abilities in which they excelled,
and women attached more importance to the abilities in which
they excelled. However, all of the differences in this regard were
quite small.
Plans After Graduation
A little over half (52%) of the respondents said they planned to
work full-time immediately after graduation. Somewhat fewer
(37%) planned to study full-time, with the remainder planning to
travel, work and study, or pursue other activities. These figures
almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
analyses showed that women were more likely to work full-time
after graduation than were men (59% to 46%), with a correspond
ingly larger proportion of men planning to study full time.
Further, there were considerable differences among students
in the various schools. The proportion planning full time work
ranged from a high of 61% for engineering majors to a low of 22%
for natural science majors, with the social science and humanities
majors in between (57% and 53%, respectively). Nearly three
quarters of the natural science majors planned to study full time,
more than twice as large a figure as for the next highest school
(social science majors, 32%). This finding reflects the fact that
many of the natural science majors planned to attend medical
school and were not delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study.

Longitudinal results concerning students' immediate plans
show that the trend toward working full-time has leveled off. The
percentage of students planning to work full time immediately
after graduation stood at 28% in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55% in 1979, dropping off slightly the past
two years to 52%. Again we should note that students maintain
high long-term educational aspirations: fully 86% of all 1981
graduating seniors said that they eventually planned to attend
graduate or professional school (or were already in a co-terminal
master's program), a figure quite comparable to those of
previous years.
This year we have added a question asking for three factors
that affected students' plans for the coming year. The results
here are interesting, but again they will have more meaning in
future years as trends in types of responses given by students
develop. For the current group of seniors, the most frequently
mentioned factor was money and financial considerations, given
as one of the three factors by about 35% of the respondents.
Second most frequently mentioned was a category we call the
"desire to escape academics," where about 27% of students
indicated a desire to get out of school and do something else.
Third was personality characteristics, about 24% of the
students saying that some feature of their own personality led
them to pursue some particular course of action.
In order, the next three most often named factors were a
desire to apply knowledge or skills learned at Stanford, academ
ic experiences (such as particular courses or majors that led to
certain future activities), and intellectual interests.
Hence, it appears that factors not directly related to their
undergraduate education were of greatest importance (money,
personality, and a desire to get away from the academic
environment) while their undergraduate experiences constituted
a second tier of important factors.
Interestingly enough, particular individuals (parents, faculty,
friends, etc.) were not among the most important factors
mentioned, though there were at least three students who said
that an "international romance" was the most decisive factor in
their plans—they were going off to Europe to live with someone
they had met while overseas.
Summary
The overall assessment of Stanford undergraduate education
given by graduating seniors in 1981 was quite positive. Students
rated both the undergraduate program and the faculty and staff
highly, and they felt that both their campus living situation and,
even more, their overseas study contributed significantly to their
academic experience.
There was less satisfaction with the faculty as teachers and
genuine dissatisfaction with general advisors. Teaching assistants
also were given relatively low ratings, but for almost all other
items the ratings clustered on the positive end of the scale.
These relatively positive evaluations were generally better
than or equal to students' expectations, and students attached
considerable importance to all of the aspects of their under
graduate training that were covered by the survey.
Students also rated their abilities quite highly, with half or
more of all students saying that they had good or excellent ability
for nearly all of the items mentioned. The major weaknesses
here had to do with students' understanding of Western and
"non-Western culture, foreign languages, computers, and tech
nology. Students also saw their abilities as having improved a
great deal in all areas queried and they viewed these areas as
being of moderate or great importance to them, with the
greatest importance being attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences among schools, with
humanities students expressing the most satisfaction with their
major programs and departments and natural science majors
expressing the least. Humanities majors also felt they got the
best liberal education, while engineers were least satisfied in this
regard. On the other hand, natural science majors felt very well
trained for further study, as did engineering majors, while
humanities and social science majors felt much less adequately
trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to follow the expected lines
based on major area of study, with the engineering and natural
science majors strong in quantitative and "hard science" areas;
the social science majors strong in dimensions directly related to
their disciplines; and humanities majors strongest in humanistic
dimensions.
There were few sex-based differences, especially with respect
to evaluations of the undergraduate program and of the faculty
and staff. The main differences here concerned the importance
attached to items, with women considering most items of
greater importance. Differences in abilities conformed generally
to traditional sex related images in American culture. Evaluations
of improvement in ability and of the importance of the various
abilities generally corresponded to the evaluations of ability:
men claimed to have improved most in areas in which they did
well, and they considered these areas to be of greater importance
The same was true for women.
The 1981 Senior Survey yielded a great deal of information of
considerable value to the university. With the active participation
of graduating seniors and broader institutional discussion of the
results, we hope to make the survey an increasingly useful tool
for university self-assessment and a means of furthering the
excellence of undergraduate education at Stanford.

lP'i:
Differences by Area of Study and Sex.
1 Among the analyses of the responses from various subsets of
the respondent population, two dimensions of special interest
are those of the area of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex. In
the first case, the responses allow us to assess the various
v schools as they were perceived by those majoring in departments
P: within them; in the second case we learn more about the
students themselves through comparisons of the responses
' made by women with those made by men.
A Differences among schools
*-§ We have grouped the majors into five 'schools:' engineering,
humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and interdepart
# mental programs. A sixth school, earth sciences, was also
. i included in the analyses, but the number of students in this
school was so small that there is little stability in the statistics for
• them
|C Students majoring in humanities departments gave the highest
overall evaluations for various aspects of their coursework and
/' experience in their major departments, nearly all of them (83%)
w rating the courses in their major as'good'or'excellent'and most
| (71%) rating the faculty highly as teachers. They also rated their
■£' major advisors relatively highly (44% of the responses at the top
112 two points).
Bp?" Natural science majors gave the lowest overall ratings, with
v: their major courses receiving high ratings from 59% of these
students while the faculty as teachers were rated highly by 51%
»•s'. and major advisors by 31%. Engineering majors rated their
w department courses and advisors very highly but gave average
ratings for the faculty as teachers (58%f0r the top two categories
mjk. on the scale).

Social science and interdepartmental majors gave more
mixed evaluations, rating faculty teaching quality relatively
highly but giving very low evaluations of their major advisors or
courses. The most positive evaluations of teaching assistants
came from engineering majors (46% 'good' or 'excellent'
responses), while the humanities and social science majors gave
the lowest responses (30% and 27%, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors gave relatively less positive
ratings for the adequacy of their training for graduate or
professional school (68% for the top two categories), while
natural science and engineering majors gave the highest
responses (85% for each). Social science and interdepartmental
majors also gave relatively low responses on this dimension.
The full import of this contrast is revealed by the finding that
the humanities and social science majors felt that they received
the most adequate liberal education (79%and 73%, respectively,
in the top categories), while the engineering and natural science
majors felt much less satisfied in this area (41% and 58%).
In sum, humanities majors rated their departments highly and
felt that their liberal education was very good, but that their
training for further education was not totally adequate; while the
engineering and natural science felt that their programs were
quite good and trained them well, but did not provide an
adequate liberal education. The social science and interdepart
mental majors tended to fall in between these two extremes.
With respect to perceptions of abilities, the results provide
few surprises. Engineering and natural science majors gave
themselves much higher ratings than other majors for such
abilities as understanding mathematical sciences, making use of
computers, understanding technology and applied sciences,
and the like; while humanities majors rated themselves more
highly for such abilities as understanding literature and fine arts,
understanding anon-Western culture, and soon. Social science
majors rated their ability to understand social processes and
institutions, understand the workings of government, and make
judgments about international problems more highly than did
other majors. All of these findings are in line with our expectations
about the various schools.

The final two ability items, new to the survey this year,
produced rather interesting results. With respect to the ability to
"absorb and analyze information," differences were not great
but the natural science majors led the way with 97% saying they
had high ability here, followed by engineering students at 95%;
lowest in this area were humanities majors at 88%.
By contrast, in the use of creativity the humanities majors led
the way with 79% saying they had high ability here, followed by
social science majors (71%) and engineering majors (69%) and, at
the bottom of this ranking, natural science students (63%).
There is a clear perception of some degree of conflict between
analytical and creative abilities among Stanford seniors.
B. Sex Differences
There were few significant differences between men and
women with respect to their ratings of the undergraduate pro
gram and the faculty and staff. Men rated the adequacy of their
training for further education and their experiences overseas
slightly higher than did women, as many as 12% more men giving
these items a rating of excellent. Women, on the other hand,
gave more positive evaluations for their major advisors; the
quality of teaching assistants; and the opportunities for individ
ual work; but for these items the differences were even smaller.
There were few sex-related differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the undergraduate program and
faculty relative to their expectations. However, women rated
nearly all of these items as being of greater importance to them
than did men; ten to twenty percent more women gave
responses of 'great' or 'very great' importance for many of these
items, with the biggest differences found for the importance of
the quality of the liberal education, and the importance of the
major advisor. Hence, women cared more about the various
aspects of their undergraduate education, even though they
rated their education similarly to the way men did and they felt
roughly the same degree of satisfaction relative to their expecta
tions as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed in the undergraduate
career, the sex differences generally seem to follow traditional
stereotypes: men rated their own abilities more highly than
women rated their own abilities in the areas of mathematical
sciences; natural sciences; technology and applied sciences;
using computers; and making judgments about international
problems. The percentage of men rating themselves as 'good' or
'excellent' ofi these items was 10 to 23 points greater than the
corresponding figure for women. Likewise, women rated them
selves more highly (by about 9 to 16 points) for their abilities to
use a foreign language and to understand literature and fine arts.
On other items (including the items concerning analytical and
creative abilities) there were no sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to some extent a reflection of
the uneven distribution of men and women among the various
majors. For instance, as stated earlier, natural science and engi

mathematics higher than did humanities majors. Since men
were overrepresented in the natural sciences and engineering,
we should expect the overall ratings to conform to the traditional

nevertheless rated themselves less highly in these dimensions
than did males in these majors.
This pattern held up for most of the items for which there were
sex-related differences, with the important exception that worn

rated their degree of improvement higher; and likewise for
women. Also, the importance of the abilities generally cor
responded to the differences in assessments of the abilities: men
attached more importance to the abilities in which they excelled,
and women attached more importance to the abilities in which
they excelled. However, all of the differences in this regard were
quite small.

A little over half (52%) of the respondents said they planned to
work full-time immediately after graduation. Somewhat fewer
(37%) planned to study full-time, with the remainder planning to
travel, work and study, or pursue other activities. These figures
almost exactly duplicate last year's results. More detailed
