## 7-1 Card hosts Hayward today 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford baseball coach
Mark Marquess knew that his
team was going to be good, but
even he has to be pleased with
his team's impressive start this
year.
The Cardinal boasts a 7-1 rec
ord which is even more im
pressive considering two of the
wins came over No. 1 Cal State
Fullerton and one over No. 8
Fresno State.
Stanford hosts Cal State Hay
ward today at 2:30 p.m. at
'Sunken Diamond.
Hayward has a 1-3 record this
year, losing to California and
dropping two of three games
to Cal Poly Pomona.
The team's most dangerous
player is third baseman Tom
Kennon. Kennon wasan all-Far
West Conference choice last
year and batted .353, including
nine homers and 31 runs batted
in.
"I don't know much about
them," Marquess said. "They
get a lot of junior college
transfers, but they've always
been real tough for us."
Coming into the season, ev
erybody knew that Stanford
could hit. Last year the Cardinal
averaged 8.6 runs per game

and batted .337 as a team. Un
fortunately, other teams did
almost as well against Stanford.
The real surprise this season
has been the defense.
The pitching staff has an
earned run average of 2.69 so
far this season. Freshman Kevin
Ballard has 2-0 record and 2.77
ERA.
The return of senior Brian
Mignano, who has been out
with a sore arm, and
sophomore Steve Cottrell, who
has had back problems, is also
encouraging.
Stanford's fielding, especial
ly centerfielder Darryl Ste
phens's, has been impressive.
If there has been a weak spot
for the Cardinal this year, it has
been their hitting.
"We've played well but
we've been a little inconsistent
hitting the ball," Marquess
said, "But overall, I'm happy
with our progress."
Even with their inconsistent
hitting, Stanford has a .283
team batting average. Mike
Dotterer leads the team in bat
ting with a .412 average, Loring
Davies is hitting .400 and Mike
Toothman is batting .308 with
six RBl's.
