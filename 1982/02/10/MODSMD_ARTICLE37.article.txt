What a weekend for Stanford sports. Not only did the
basketball team finally get a second conference win —
against the same school — but athletic director Andy Geiger
received some practice in accepting resignations as basket
ball coach Dick Dißiaso and associate athleticdirectorGary
Cavalli both announced their resignations.

When basketball coach Dick Dißiaso announced last Fri
day that he would be calling it quits at the end of the season,
it was not much of a shock. Dißiaso had been under fire for
the past two seasons and after seven years had only man
aged a 69-110 record. Immediately following the resigna
tion, however, Dißiaso was offered a job as an assistant ath
letic director. No doubt Dißiaso was pressured to resign,
but the fact that he was offered the job of assistant athletic
director was not a token gesture. While people questioned
Dißiaso's coaching, few could doubt his recruiting ability.
In the last couple of years, Dißiaso assembled some very tal
ented players. If he takes the job of assistant athletic
directer, it's a good bet that he will be doing a lot of recruit
ing.

Talking about bad days, think about Stanford mens tennis
team. Yesterday, they suited up and left for a meet at San
Jose State. Unfortunately, when they arrived in San Jose,
they found the Spartans already playing — another team.
Apparently, San Jose State thought the match was next
month. Stanford has had the match on their schedule for
quite some time. How's that for communication?

On a more positive note, the Stanford women's lacrosse
club opened its season with a 12-1 victory over Palo Alto Sat
urday.
□ □ □
The women's rugby club which started off the year with a
3-0 victory over the Linwood Ladies of Christchurch New
Zealand and then demolished Fresno7l-0, finally lost Satur
day to UC Davis, 6-4. The team will play Thursday at 3:30
against UC Santa Cruz at Maloney Field.
