knew what was going on. No
body was so naive. It was common knowl
edge in the whole town." — David Green
wood, former UCLA All-America.
B'Well, what was common knowledge
among the Westwood set for the past 15 years
is now, finally, national news.
if Splashy headlines in the Los Angeles Times
two weeks ago destroyed the self-contented
bustle that generally depicts UCLA in Febru
ary — the height of basketball season. Stun
' ning allegatins of free abortions for the girl
friends of ex-Bruin basketball starts, of gigan
tic discounts on cars for the players, of freebie
stereos and gratis airline tickets were re
ported by the Times
The Times interviewed more than 45 peo
ple connected with UCLA basketball, many
of them former players and coaches, and
112 found that the nine violations that the NCAA
listed against UCLA last December 8 — when
the school's basketball program was placed
on two year's probation — barely skimmed
Jhe surface. The NCAA, said the Times,
L ' "missed the iceberg in Westwood."
The chief architect of that iceberg is 69-
p year-old Sam Gilbert, a multi-million dollar
112 Los Angeles contractor, who for the past dec
> ade and a half was known as the "godfather"
Rof UCLA basketball. This year, the ties were
cut when present UCLA coach Larry Farmer
r- himself a close friend of Gilbert's — told
his players to stay away from the biggest of
the Bruin boosters. For many years, Gilbert
was far more than just a goods and services
man for budding UCLAns; he wasthe players'
preeminent agent — both before and after
graduation, their confidant; and his com
fortable house in Pacific Palisades was for
many, a second home.
Gilbert willingly flouted NCAA rules and
regulations' (which he felt were archaic),
claiming that he was providing services that
the players needed — especially the many
poor black players who flocked to him — but
could not find elsewhere.
Gilbert also claims that the NCAA knew
what was going on all along. And he's right.
Former NCAA investigator Brent Clark went
out to UCLA in 1977 and his findings, "could
have put them (UCLA) on indefinite sus
pension." But, he told the Los Angeles Times,
"I submitted the memoranda and they (the
NCAA) just sat on it." The message was clear:
as long as the Bruins were a basketball jug
gernaut, as long as they were not only an es
tablished big money-maker, but also the Es
l tablishment itself, the NCAA would amuse
itself by swatting annoying gnats like Long
Beach State and Southwestern Louisiana. "In
this instance," Clark told a House subcom
mittee in 1978, "politics and balance sheets
seemed to dictate that the NCAA would take
no action."
But, Clark said recently, "The gild is off the
lily out there now. They (UCLA) are vulner
able to past sins." Are they ever!
Last year, three major college stars — Dar
ryl Mitchell of Minnesota, Greg Goorjian of
Loyola Marymount, and Michael Johnson of
Nevada-Las Vegas — told NCAA investigators
that Gilbert offered them cars as an induce
ment to attend UCLA. Recalls Marques John
son (now of the Milwaukee Bucks): "Older
players would say, 'Don't buy that. Go see
Sam." Said Greg Lee (the point guard on
those Bill Walton teams of the early '70s):
"The (assistant) coach asked me, 'Do you
want your tickets?' I gave them to him and the
coach would hand me a bunch of money.
And I knew it was more than face value."
Probably much more. Working through Gil
bert, some Bruins grossed up to $1000 a year

on scalped tickets.
Two years ago, Gilbert admitted to Stu
Nahan of KNBC-TV (the NBC affiliate in Los
Angeles) that he negotiated with NBA teams
for Richard Washington and Marques John
son while both were juniors at UCLA. That's
also against the rules.
Lucius Allen, a Bruin All-America in the late
1960s and a man who considered Gilbert, "my
daddy", provided the week's most shocking
charge. It turns out that when Allen and other
players got girls pregnant, Gilbert, if asked,
would arrange and pay for abortions. "It hap
pened all the time," Allen told the Times, "If a
ballplayer impregnated someone, there was
always a hospital available. I never paid for it,
and it was my case."
Writes Jack Scott (once Bill Walton's close
friend and advisor): "His (Gilbert's) check
book should be retired from the rafters at
Pauley Pavi I lion. He did as much asanysingle
person for UCLA's basketball program." (Ac
cording to Scott, Walton owed Gilbert $4500
for assorted services while Bill was at UCLA.)
Says Lucius Allen: "UCLA wouldn't have won
any championships without athletes. And
without Sam Gilbert they wouldn't have had
the athletes."
There was, however, a flip side to Gilbert's
non-stop largesse. While he always said, "I
never took a dime" for favors rendered to
players, Gilbert was not a man to be messed
with. When Marques Johnson and Jamaal
Wilkes each decided to seek other represen
tation early in their pro careers, Gilbert (their
former agent) took their actions as a personal
affront. He demanded $2500 from Johnson
for past services, and sent a "vicious" letter
(in Jamaal's words) to Wilkes' agent — a copy
of which went to Wilkes' employer at that
time, Golden State's general manager Dick
Vertlieb (an old war buddvof Gilbert's).
Former players are not the only ones to
complain about Gilbert or to question his
motives. Said one former coach: "I knew I
didn't have full control. If you've got a guy on
the side, a guy players can get cash, cars,
clothes from, who's he (the player) going to
listen to?"
Who was that talking? Gene Bartow (who
replaced the sainted John Wooden in 1975)?
Larry Brown (who departed last year)? It hard
ly matters. Both were on the godfather's hit
list. Bartow was "an emotional basket case,"
Gilbert told the Los Angeles Times in 1978. Of
Brown, he told Sports Illustrated last year, "I
could cut his... off and he wouldn't know it
until he pulled his pants down."
Gilbert is equally vociferous about the at
tention he is currently receiving in the pa
pers. "It's dreadful," he told UPI two Sundays
ago. "I think this kind of journalism is the pits.
It's rubbish. I don't know what's happening
to our society. That's not journalism. There's
another name for it."
There's also another name for what's hap
pening to big-time sports these days. The
name is Scandal. Last month, Texas A&M an
nounced that it had hired Jackie Sherrill to be
the coach of the football team for the next six
years — at $267,000 a year. Talk about
priorities! Also last month, South Carolina
announced that it accepted the resignation of
women's basketball coach Pam Parsons —
amidst charges that the coach had slept with
one of her phyers and had made payments to
others.
The Sam Gilbert affair at UCLA is not an
isolated incident. There are Sam Gilberts ev
erywhere. And unless the major universities
start cleaning up their acts and sitting on their
boosters, a lot more of them are going to find
out soon what UCLA feels like now.
