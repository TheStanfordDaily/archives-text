President Ronald Reagan's efforts to unleash U.S. in
telligence agencies "open the door" for renewed CIA
abuses, according to Stanford Trustee Philip Taubman.
Taubman, who covers CIA activities for The New York
Times, warned of the potential dangers of Reagan's CIA
policy in a speech sposored by SWOPSI yesterday.

some of the breaks on CIA activities," Taubman said.
"Reagan's revisions have raised the specter that we're re

•conduct covert operations inside the United States;
•open mail without a warrant; and
•conduct interviews under false pretext.

demics in order to obtain information.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and others have voiced
concern about potential CIA activity on campus. Roth
has suggested that the University write guidelines defin
ing proper behavior for faculty members approached by
CIA agents.
"I would support the faculty if they made an effort to
make guidelines," Taubman said. But as a trustee, he said
he is in no position to initiate such guidelines. "It's a fac

Taubman also warned that the Reagan adminis
tration's attempts to control technology transfer to the
Soviet Union pose a serious danger to universities like
Stanford. "Concern about the hemorrhage of techno
logical information to Russia" could create a situation in
