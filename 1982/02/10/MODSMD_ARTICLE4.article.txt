President Ronald Reagan's efforts to unleash U.S. in
telligence agencies "open the door" for renewed CIA
abuses, according to Stanford Trustee Philip Taubman.
Taubman, who covers CIA activities for The New York
Times, warned of the potential dangers of Reagan's CIA
policy in a speech sposored by SWOPSI yesterday.
Reagan has revised executive orders created during
the 1970s to control CIA action. "We have removed
some of the breaks on CIA activities," Taubman said.
"Reagan's revisions have raised the specter that we're re
turning to 'business as usual' at the CIA."
"Business as usual" means the CIA has renewed free
edom to:
•conduct covert operations inside the United States;
•open mail without a warrant; and
•conduct interviews under false pretext.
This third aspect of Reagan's new executive orders al

lows CIA agents to pose as journalists, clergy, and aca
demics in order to obtain information.
Mechanical Engineering Prof. Bernard Roth, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and others have voiced
concern about potential CIA activity on campus. Roth
has suggested that the University write guidelines defin
ing proper behavior for faculty members approached by
CIA agents.
"I would support the faculty if they made an effort to
make guidelines," Taubman said. But as a trustee, he said
he is in no position to initiate such guidelines. "It's a fac
ulty issue," he said.
Taubman also warned that the Reagan adminis
tration's attempts to control technology transfer to the
Soviet Union pose a serious danger to universities like
Stanford. "Concern about the hemorrhage of techno
logical information to Russia" could create a situation in


Phil Taubman
which "scholars would have to sub
mit information to the government,"
he said. "This is a major issue in this
country."
With Reagan's new directives,
Taubman said he sees the "increased
danger of falling into old habits" —
habits which Congress deemed un
ethical and curtailed after Watergate.
Taubman described some CIA
practices uncovered by the Con
gressional investigations in the early
19705, including "bizarre" assassina
tion attempts on such leaders as
Cuba's Fidel Castro. Until Congress
clamped down, he said, CIA actions
were "literally the kind of things you
expect to see in a James Bond mov
ie."
As the editor of The Stanford Daily

in 1969, Taubman said he was con
cerned about CIA activities on cam
pus. " We wondered if there were in
formants working at the Daily," he
said.
He compared current concern
over CIA infiltration of universities
with similar concerns in the 19605.
"The scary stories in The Stanford
Daily last week remind me of events
of 10 years ago." Taubman was refer
ring to a recent series of articles
about CIA activities affecting the
campus.
As a reporter for The New York
Times, Taubman said he fears the im
pact of Reagan's new CIA policy on
journalists. Since CIA agents may
now pose as journalists, he fears that
people will be less willing to provide
information for reporters. "It makes
it difficult for a reporter to act when
he may be accused of being a CIA
agent," he said.
