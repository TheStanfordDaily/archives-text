Landover, Md (AP) —
Mike Bossy, the scoring ma
chine of the Stanley Cup cham
pion New York Islanders,
pumped in two goals last
night to propel the Prince of
Wales Conference to a 4-2 vic
tory over the Clarence
Campbell Conference in the
National Hockey League AI !-
Star game.
Bossy, who has twice led the
league in goals and has been an

all-star in all five of his seasons
with the Islanders, broke a 2-2
tie by poking home the re
bound of a shot by defenseman
Barry Beck of the New York
Rangers with 2:50 remaining in
the second period.
He then clinched the game
— and Most Valuable Player
honors for himself — by beat
ing goalie Gilles Meloche of
Minnesota on a breakaway
1:19 into the final period. De

fenseman Larry Robinson of
Montreal, standing at the side
of his own net, hit the breaking
Bossy behind the Campbell de
fense. Bossy skated in un
molested, made a shoulder
fake on Meloche and put a
short wrist shot past the goal
ie's glove.
They were Bossy's first two
goals in all-star competition.

The Campbells jumped to a
1-0 lead 2:32 into the game
before a sellout crowd of
18,130 at the Capital Centre
when Rick Vaive of Toronto —
one of 20 players making an all
star debut here — rifled a
slapshot past Wales goalie
Michel Dion of Pittsburgh.
But the Wales struck back
with a pair of goals 1:24 apart.
