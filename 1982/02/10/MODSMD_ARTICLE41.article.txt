The Stanford wrestling team
couldn't handle San Jose State
last night, but the meet ended
on a positive note as the
Cardinal took three of the last
four weights. The Spartans,
ranked 11th nationally, piled
two falls and two superior de
cisions on topof three Stanford
forfeits for an easy 40-12 win.
The Cardinal proved tough
to beat in the upper weights as
Torn Mullen, Doug Perkins,
and Ed Katz controlled their
matches.
At 167 pounds, Mullen
chased his opponent through

the first two periods. After
building a 6-0 lead, he coasted
to an 8-3 decision.
Doug Perkins had a similar
contest, coming out fast for a
8-2 lead, and then holding on
to win 9-7.
Freshman Ed Katz was the
most impressive on the
Cardinal squad. Katz
scrambled to a 7-3 first period
lead, then clamped down with
a tight headlock to end the
meet.
The wrestlers are now 4-6.
The next home match is the Pa
cific-10 Championships on
February 28.
