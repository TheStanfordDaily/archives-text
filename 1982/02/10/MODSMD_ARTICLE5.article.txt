Reagan to critics: Tut up or shut up'
Indianapolis â€”President Ronald Reagan yesterday abandoned his
muted appeal for a "revived federalism" in favor of a bluntly worded
attack on Democrats critical of his out-of-balance budget, which he de
fended as the only hope for economic recovery.
"We have in place an economic program that is based on sound eco
nomic theory not on political expediency," Reagan said in a speech to
the Indiana state legislature. "We will not play hopscotch economics,
jumping here and jumping there as the daily situation changes. We have
faith in our program and we are sticking with it. To the paid political
complainers, let me say as politely as I can, 'Put up or shut up.' We have
a solid plan already in place. What do they have? Either give the Ameri
can people a better alternative or join with us in our effort to set the
economy right."
Earlier, in an address to a joint session of the Iowa legislature in Des
Moines, Reagan eliminated some passages of his speech that celebrated
the achievements of Franklin Roosevelt and replaced them with a
challenge to present-day Democrats to support his economic policies,
some of which are aimed at undoing New Deal programs.
"The budget we have proposed is a line drawn in the dirt," Reagan
said. "Those who are concerned about the deficit will cross it and work
with us on our proposals. Those who are not concerned about deficits
will stay on the other side and simply continue their theatrics."
Reagan vowed that he would stick to his plan to reduce income taxes
and raise the defense budget in fiscal 1983 despite a deficit his budget
office has put at $91.5 billion and many critics say will be much higher.
"We must hold firm to our tax cuts and reduce the budget even
more," Reagan said in Des Moines. "We have much to do before we will
see the light, but I think we are at last and at least approaching the bend
in the tunnel." . ,
