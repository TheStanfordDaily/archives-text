Reagan to critics: Tut up or shut up'
Indianapolis —President Ronald Reagan yesterday abandoned his
muted appeal for a "revived federalism" in favor of a bluntly worded
attack on Democrats critical of his out-of-balance budget, which he de
fended as the only hope for economic recovery.
"We have in place an economic program that is based on sound eco
nomic theory not on political expediency," Reagan said in a speech to
the Indiana state legislature. "We will not play hopscotch economics,
jumping here and jumping there as the daily situation changes. We have
faith in our program and we are sticking with it. To the paid political
complainers, let me say as politely as I can, 'Put up or shut up.' We have
a solid plan already in place. What do they have? Either give the Ameri
can people a better alternative or join with us in our effort to set the
economy right."
Earlier, in an address to a joint session of the Iowa legislature in Des
Moines, Reagan eliminated some passages of his speech that celebrated
the achievements of Franklin Roosevelt and replaced them with a
challenge to present-day Democrats to support his economic policies,
some of which are aimed at undoing New Deal programs.
"The budget we have proposed is a line drawn in the dirt," Reagan
said. "Those who are concerned about the deficit will cross it and work
with us on our proposals. Those who are not concerned about deficits
will stay on the other side and simply continue their theatrics."
Reagan vowed that he would stick to his plan to reduce income taxes
and raise the defense budget in fiscal 1983 despite a deficit his budget
office has put at $91.5 billion and many critics say will be much higher.
"We must hold firm to our tax cuts and reduce the budget even
more," Reagan said in Des Moines. "We have much to do before we will
see the light, but I think we are at last and at least approaching the bend
in the tunnel." . ,
Reagan was equally firm about his insistence
that the defense budget must be increased. The
budget he submitted to Congress Monday calls
for an 18 percent rise in defense spending.
"Studies indicate that our relative military im
balance with the Soviet Union will be at its worst
by the mid-1980s," Reagan said. "As president, I
cannot close my eyes, cross my fingers and sim
ply hope the Soviets will behave themselves.
Today a major conflict involving the United
States could occur without adequate time to
upgrade U.S. force readiness. It is morally im
perative that we take steps to protect America's
safety and preserve the peace."
USSR proposes missile cuts
Moscow —The Soviet Union last night out
lined its formal position at the nuclear talks with
the United States in Geneva, calling for staged
reductions of medium-range missiles in Europe
to "300 units on each side" by 1991.
In an authoritative statement distributed by
the government news agency Tass, Moscow re
jected proposals advanced by President Ronald
Reagan last week as"patently unacceptable." It
said they amounted to a demand for unilateral
disarmament by the Soviet Union.
Last night's statement provided a formal, de
tailed explanation of a suggestion made by Pres
ident Leonid Brezhnev last week that the two
sidesshould reducetheirmedium-range nucle
ar arsenals by two-thirds in the course of the
decade. It also indicated that no major progress
has been achieved in the Geneva meetings.
In making the details public, the Soviets ap
peared to be making a fresh bid for publicopin
ion in Western Europe, where there has been
strong opposition to a NATO plan to begin
deploying a new generation of medium-range
U.S. nuclear missiles in Western Europe next
year.
With last night's statement, the Soviets also
appeared to parallel the U.S. initiatives in the
field. Reagan first outlined his "zero option"
proposal and then publicized the formal U.S.
bargaining position a week ago.
Reagan's "zero option" calls on the Soviets to
dismantle their SS-20 missiles as well as older
SS-4s and SS-5s directed at Western Europe. In
return, the United States would abandon the
plan to deploy 572 medium-range nuclear
weapons in Western Europe next year.
Watt cited for contempt
Washington —A House subcommittee yes
terday voted to cite Secretary of the Interior
James Watt for contempt after Chairman John
Dingell (D-Mich.) accused him of "stonewall
ing" and "a pattern of obstructionism" in con
gressional efforts to obtain Interior Department
documents.
The contempt citation, adopted by a vote of
11-6, technically concerned from seven to 11
documents that Watt refused to hand over to
the House Energy and Commerce subcommit

tee investigating the way Canadian energy poli
cy affects U.S. investors.
Watt, who said the conflict involved constitu
tional matters not personalities, has cited the
principle of "executive privilege" in withhold
ing the documents. This principle is used by
presidents to keep sensitive materials from
being turned over to Congress.
Watt, who has given the subcommittee nearly
200 documents, told Dingell in a letter yester
day that those being withheld are "highly sensi
tive foreign policy matters" or "White House
Cabinet deliberations."
But although the contempt citation only con
cerns a few documents, congressional sources
said some Democrats wanted to press the issue
"as a matter of principle" because they believe
Watt is trying to withhold other documents
from subcommittees headed by critics of his
policies.
Haig rips Soviet Union
Madrid —Secretary of State Alexander Haig
said vesterday the Soviet Union and Poland had
brought East and West to "a critical crossroads
in the postwar history in Europe" by imposing
martial law in Poland.
"We would be threatening the future peace
of Europe if we ignored this dramatic attack on
international principles," Haig told the 35-na
tion Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe.
"We cannot pretend to build up thestructure
of peace and security here in Madrid while the
foundation for that structure is being under
mined in Poland."
The conference is a follow-up session to the
1975 Helsinki accords designed to promote se
curity and cooperation in Europe. It involves
Western European countries, East bloc coun
tries, the United States and Canada.
The Madrid meeting has been trying to ex
tend the pact to ease East-West tensions in Eu
rope. It was closed to the press, and aides dis
tributed copies of Haig's remarks to reporters.
Haig said the Communist regimes in Moscow
and Warsaw had committed a "willful violation
of solemn international obligations" with the
Dec. 13 decree that imposed martial law on Po
land and suspended the independent union
Solidarity.
"The generals of this war against the Polish
people are none other than the Polish .regime
itself, acting under the instigation and coercion
of the Soviet Union," Haig declared.
"Nothing endangers security and coopera
tion in Europe more than the threat and the use
of force to deny internationally recognized
rights."
Saudis agree to cooperate
Dhahran, Saudi Arabia —The United States
and Saudi Arabia agreed yesterday to raise the
level of their formal military cooperation by es
tablishing a joint defense planning committee
and working together to help other friendly na

tions in the Middle East and Indian Ocean.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger an
nounced these new links at the end of lengthy
negotiations here that stretched from Saturday
until 4: JO yesterday morning.
Prince Sultan bin Addul Aziz, the Saudi de
fense minister, sat beside Weinberger and ap
peared to join in endorsing the agreement
sketched by the U.S. defense secretary, al
though he made no direct comment on the ac
cord hismself.
The Saudis declined Weinberger's request to
issue the agreement in the form of a joint com
munique, American officials said, but they ac
quiesced in a compromise formula that resulted
in Weinberger's reading to reporters parts of a
draft paper that had been the subject of the in
tensive negotiations with Sultan. Weinberger's
prepared statement was not distributed to re
porters.
Intheend, officials said, Weinberger, by wait
ing out the Saudis, managed to get Saudi agree
ment to verbal presentation of the points he
had presented in writing, with Prince Sultan sit
ting at his side on a blue couch in an unusual
ceremony in the richly carpeted VIP lounge at
the Dhahran Airport.

and lingering high interest rates.

lowest close since Sept. 25,1981, when the blue
chip average finished at 824.01.
Gold rose slightly yesterday in lacklustertrad
ing, settling on the Commodity Exchange in
New York at $380.60 a troy ounce for February
delivery.
