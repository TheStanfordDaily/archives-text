# Tuition to rise 15 percent
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
approved the proposed tuition,
room and board increases for
1982-83, bringing total under
graduate costs to $11,643.
The standard tuition will be $8220,
an increase of $1080 or 15.1 percent
over this year. Annual Medical
School tuition will increase 15 per
cent to $9591 and Law School tuition
will go up 14.8 percent to $8370.
Basic room and board rates for un
dergraduates will be $3423, an in
crease of $458 or 15.5 percent.
Stanford's tuition increase is con
sistent with that of several Ivy League
schools. The New York Times re
ported yesterday that Yale will raise
its costs next year by 14 percent, from
$10,340 to $11,790; Princeton by 15
percent from $9994 to $11,468;

Harvard by 11 to 15 percent from its
present $10,540; and Columbia by
more than 15 percent.
Last year Stanford's increase of 13.3
percent was the lowest among 10
comparable, primarily Ivy League,
schools.
The higher tuition will allow the
University to continue to meet the
demonstrated financial need of all
admitted undergraduates. More
than 50 percent of Stanford under
graduates now receive financial aid
exceeding $15 million annually. The
University has stood by its commit
ment to an "aid-blind admission"
policy.
Over the past five years, the
number of students, regardless of ec
onomic background, who expressed
an interest in attending Stanford has
increased. The percentages both of
the national college-bound popu

lation from all economic back
grounds and of students from the
highest ability groups expressing an
interest in Stanford have also in
creased.
A background paper circulated in
advance to the trustees noted that,
"An important reason for Stanford's
continued attractiveness to a broad
segment of college-bound students
is the availability of financial aid.
Stanford is one of a small — and
shrinking — group of institutions
which meets the demonstrated fi
nancial need of every admitted un
dergraduate."
Wesleyan University last weekend
became the first major American
school to publicly announce its de
cision to end its aid-blind admissions
policy.
The backround paper said "regard
ing general economic considera
tions, we consulted with a number of
economists whose general con
sensus was that inflation would de
cline into the single digit area in
1982-83. They also felt that as the
country begins to recover from the
current recession in the second half
of the year, family incomes would
grow in real terms.
"But, even with some anticipated
improvement in the economic pic
ture the proposed tuition increase
will likely make the cost of a Stanford
education relatively more ex
pensive."
