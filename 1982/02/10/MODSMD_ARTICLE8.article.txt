# SURE expands to meet high demand

### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
Students United for Rape Elimina
tion (SURE), which in its four years
has seen a twelvefold increase in de
mand for its escort service, plans to
expand its operations shortly in order
to become more convenient for a
larger number of students.
Calls requesting SURE escorts have
increased from two or three a night
to a high of almost 40 requests nightly
last November during the rash of
rapes and assaults on campus.
"I think the general awareness on
campus is responsible for the in
crease in calls," Andy Cargile, SURE
director, said.
Cargile said he hopes to buy a golf
cart which would be radio-dis
patched to SURE escortees. This
heads the list of changes SURE hopes
to implement in the future. Cargile
has submitted a budget proposal to

the Office of Student Activities, and
said he expects to hear whether it has
been approved by next week. If the
funds are secured, Cargile predicted
the cart will be available by next
quarter.
Cargile feels that "the motorized
cart would be more visible than vol
unteers on bicycles, increase call re
sponse time, and make a weekend
escort service possible."
In a further effort to heighten stu
dent awareness of the escort service
by making escorts more visible, SURE
has invested funds donated by the
Stanford Police Department in red
and white "SURE" jackets and hats.
The organization's name will also
be officially changed from Students
United for Rape Elimination to Stan
ford United for Rape Elimination as
of next week.
