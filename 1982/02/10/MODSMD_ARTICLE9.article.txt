# Dietrich teaches nuclear awareness on campus

lunior Doug Dietrich, who teaches
a SWOPSI course entitled "The
Bomb Next Door," treats the nuclear
arms race as a personal issue.
Banners displayed on University
residence halls demanding disarma
ment are the extent of many stu
dents' involvement with the issue of
nuclear weapons proliferation.
Dietrich, though, was one of two
Stanford students arrested last Mon

day at a disarmament demonstration
at the Lawrence Livermore Labora
tories, where nuclear weapons re
search is conducted.
"Writing letters and putting up
banners are great," Dietrich said,
"but a lot of people don't take you
seriously until you put yourself on
the line.. . . This was a totally non-vi
olent act. I cannot see how the arms
race can end non-violently, and I
could no longer take responsibility

for my own inaction."
"I jog around the Dish," Dietrich
said, "and sometimes I see Navy
planes from Moffett Field flying ov
erhead carrying nuclear-armed
depth charges, searching for Soviet
submarines off the coast. It's not a re
mote issue like something happen
ing in Poland or El Salvador. It's hap
pening right here and I don't like it."
Dietrich's course focuseson the lo
cal impact of the nuclear weapons in

dustry and possible effects of nuclear
war in the area.
The Bay Area, with a number of
military bases and defense industries,
is a prime target for Soviet missiles in
the event of war.
According to Stephen Talbot, a
1981 Peabody award winner in jour
nalism, who spoke at one SWOPSI
meeting, the Concord Naval Weap
ons Station, about 25 miles northeast
of Oakland, is a major storage facility
for the Navy's nuclear weapons.
"The Bomb Next Door" also ex
amines the local economic impact of
nuclear weapons. The Silicon Valley
is a major center of defense contract
ing. There, companies such as
Lockheed, ESL, and United Technol
ogies work on the Trident missile sys
tem and other defense projects.
While some local companies benefit
from defense contracts, Dietrich said
defense work is a capital intensive,
rather than labor intensive, field
which generates far fewer jobs than
would an equivalent amount of gov
ernment spending in health or
education.
Stanford ranks third among uni
versities in the amount of money it
receives from the Department of De
fense, trailing only the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT) and
Johns Hopkins.

Many of the University's engineer
ing and science graduates work for
defense contractors. Dietrich said he
"questions the wisdom of employing
30 to 50 percent of the country's sci
entists to further our knowledge of
ways to destroy ourselves."
Despite rising concern about nu
clear arms on campus, only two stu
dents are enrolled in the course.
"I've got to publicize this better,"
said Dietrich, who plans to offer the
course again in the spring, "but I
don't want this class to be too mili
tant."
Although Dietrich does not expect
everyone to share his views on dis
armament, he does want them to se
riously consider the issue. "I'm pot
doing this because I'm nostalgic for
the '60s, like 'hey, man, I missed
Woodstock,' " Dietrich said. "I could
lead a comfortable existence, but I
was fully prepared to spend 10
months in Santa Rita jail. The future
lies with the younger set. That's us.
We should at least be educated about
the problem."
