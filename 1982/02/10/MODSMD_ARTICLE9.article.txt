# Dietrich teaches nuclear awareness on campus
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
lunior Doug Dietrich, who teaches
a SWOPSI course entitled "The
Bomb Next Door," treats the nuclear
arms race as a personal issue.
Banners displayed on University
residence halls demanding disarma
ment are the extent of many stu
dents' involvement with the issue of
nuclear weapons proliferation.
Dietrich, though, was one of two
Stanford students arrested last Mon

day at a disarmament demonstration
at the Lawrence Livermore Labora
tories, where nuclear weapons re
search is conducted.
"Writing letters and putting up
banners are great," Dietrich said,
"but a lot of people don't take you
seriously until you put yourself on
the line.. . . This was a totally non-vi
olent act. I cannot see how the arms
race can end non-violently, and I
could no longer take responsibility

for my own inaction."
"I jog around the Dish," Dietrich
said, "and sometimes I see Navy
planes from Moffett Field flying ov
erhead carrying nuclear-armed
depth charges, searching for Soviet
submarines off the coast. It's not a re
mote issue like something happen
ing in Poland or El Salvador. It's hap
pening right here and I don't like it."
Dietrich's course focuseson the lo
cal impact of the nuclear weapons in

dustry and possible effects of nuclear
war in the area.
The Bay Area, with a number of
military bases and defense industries,
is a prime target for Soviet missiles in
the event of war.
According to Stephen Talbot, a
1981 Peabody award winner in jour
nalism, who spoke at one SWOPSI
meeting, the Concord Naval Weap
ons Station, about 25 miles northeast
