# China allows private industry

Beijing — Chen Xinghua is running a tailoring
shop that could make her one of China's richest
citizens, or one of its sorriest.
At 28, she is a "new capitalist" who was given
official blessing two years ago to invest money in
her own business, operate virtually free of gov
ernment control, hire and live off the labor of
employees and even keep all the profits.
Her Beijing shop now nets her more money
each month than many workers earn in a year,
and it has provided her with many luxuries, rang
ing from a motorcycle to a washing machine,
that make her the envy of her friends.
Chen is part of an experiment that could rear
range China's urban social structure, labor force
and life style as much as any policy since Mao
Tse-tung socialized industry and commerce in
the 19505.
Chinese economists predict that as a result of a
recent government directive almost all of the 50
million new job-seekers this decade will end up
working for themselves or for privately financed
groups, known as collectives.
Although China's huge, centrally planned
state sector is to remain dominant, the new col
lective and private enterprises are expected to
play an important supporting role supplying
consumer services and goods that are in high de
mand in what is emerging as a more dynamic,
mixed economy.
New entrepreneurs already have multiplied

with quiet government encouragement. Of Chi
na's 105 million urban workers,l.s million are
self-employed, while at least 20 million work for
collective shops and factories.
If the experiment lasts, Chen and millions like
her could form a newclass of merchants, artisans
and craftsmen with an unusual degree of wealth
and personal freedom in an otherwise poor
communist society.
On the other hand, they stand to lose ev
erything should their material success spark a so
cial backlash, or should the government revert
tothe Maoist idealsofegalitarianismand revolu
tionary fervor that have guided China for much
of its 32-year communist history.
Just a few years ago, small entrepreneurs were
persecuted for being "evil speculators," and the
radical impulse to make China a classless society
still lives on in the hearts of some communist of
ficials.
But Chen says,"I really don't worry about
being a capitalist. I'm just following the party's
policy. Everybody who reads the newspaper
knowsthat. If the policy changes, I won't be hap
py, but I'll still have money left from my days as a
small capitalist."
Although the party has tried to improve mo
rale and productivity with bonuses, wage in
creases and other incentives, it decidcd that the
more dramatic gesture of refusing to guarantee
jobs for future applicants was necessary to break
the iron rice bowl.
