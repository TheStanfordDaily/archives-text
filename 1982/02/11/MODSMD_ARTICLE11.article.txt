## County prosecutor extends drama background to law 
### Steven Brown 
Richard Titus is the first to admit that the
career path he followed on the way to be
coming a deputy district attorney of Santa
Clara County is unusual. He enrolled at U.C.-
Berkeley intending to enter law, but in
fluenced by "brilliant" teachers, graduated
five years later with bachelors' degrees in
English and drama and a master's degree in
drama.
Convinced that he wanted to teach film
and drama at the college level, he went to
San Francisco State University to earn his
teaching credentials and another master's
degree in filmmaking. But after graduating,
the only teaching job he could find was at a
high school, where he stayed seven years
before deciding that "high school teaching
was not personally satisfying."
Determined to go into law, Titus entered
law school at the University of Santa Clara in
1972, taking classes at night and continuing
to teach during the day. After four years, he
graduated magna cum laude and passed the
bar exam.
"I wanted to be a criminal trial lawyer,"
said Titus, "and if you want to be a criminal
lawyer you apply to the district attorney or
the public defender. I applied to both, figur
ing that I would increase my chances." He
was hired by the district attorney — his first
choice — and at age 36, has been with the of
fice for four years.
"My background in theater and high
school teaching both have made me a very

good trial lawyer," Titus admitted, because
they required speaking before large groups
and explaining complex concepts to an au
dience. Accustomed to thinking aloud, he
speaks articulately and with ease.
Photographs of scenes from plays in which
Titus has acted hang on one wall of his
fourth-floor office in the North County Mu
nicipal Courthouse. He said participating in
community theater productions gives him all
the satisfaction he needs. "I do it because it's
a lot of fun and I enjoy it,"he remarked.
Currently he is directing "A Man for All
Seasons" at the Mountain View Community
Theater, as well as playing the cameo role of
Henry the Eighth in the play. His trimmed'
beard, ruddy face and deep voice suit the
role well.
Although Titus has prosecuted felony
trials in superior court in San Jose, he cur
rently is assigned to the Palo Alto Municipal
Court, where felonies are heard at the pre
liminary stage and misdemeanor cases are
tried. His main task is to examine police re
ports on felony cases and prepare arguments
that will be heard by the municipal court
judge, who decides at preliminary examina
tions whether evidence justifies sending
cases to superior court. The most common
felonies Titus said he encounters are burgla
ry, auto theft, possession of illegal drugs and
forgery of checks and credit cards.
"A very small percentage of the cases we
file actually go to court," Titus said. "The vast
majority of cases are settled by pleas." He es
timated that only 300 of the nearly 5000 cases
filed in the county each year end in trials.

Plea bargaining is "a necessary evil " that
keeps an overburdened criminal justice sys
tem from breaking down, according to Titus.
Cases are not just given away, he assured.
Only when a witness cannot be located,
when the police report is weak, or when new
evidence proves the crime was not com
mitted, is a case dismissed or settled for a
lesser charge. Titus recalled a bar-fight trial
in which the defendant was accused of kick
ing a man in the head. The deputy district at
torney destroyed his own case when he dis
covered a bartender willing to testify that the
man was holding the accused by the ankles,
and the accused accidently kicked him while
shouting "let me go!" and struggling to free
himself.
"lam required by my ethical obligations to
give any evidence I have that may exonerate
the defendant to the defense and this may
result in losing a trial," Titus stated, explain
ing he does not believe he works within a
simple adversary system. "The district at
torney's job is to achieve substantial justice,
not to win cases. I don't see the defendant's
rights as interfering with that," he em
phasized
"There are a lot of kids in juvenile court
who get into trouble simply because they're
immature and they don't want to deal with
growing up yet. There's an entire policy and I
think it's a good one, of protecting the
names of younger defendants," Titus said.
He said this prevents the publication of juve
niles' names in all but widely publicized
murder and rape cases.

Speaking of the press in general, Titus said
that "a lot of reporters who write about law
and courts don't really know about legal
procedure and what is going on." He said
this makes press coverage less clear than it
could be and leads to minor inaccuracies. He
also said the wire services and major news
magazines hire reporters with law degrees
because they are better able to understand
the legal system.
"The general public is getting very frus
trated with the inability of the criminal jus
tice system to deal with the amount of crime
in California," Titus said in explaining the ra
tionale behind what some call a growing
anti-judicial sentiment among state resi
dents. "Crime is one of the few real growth
industries in California," he joked. The pub
lic feels that the system does not punish of
fenders strongly enough and wants strong
law-enforcement advocates on the bench,
he explained.
Titus said he shares some of the public's
feelings: "I feel very frustrated when I have a
case that I've worked hard on and then see
somebody who I know is guilty of serious of
fenses being given a minimal punishment."
He recalled the case of a man convicted of
raping a woman twice in her home. Officials
at the state prison where the rapist was sent
for a 90-day commitment described him as
violent, but the judge sentenced him to one
year in the county jail, Titus said. "I was out
raged!" he exclaimed.
"DAs do tend to become emotionally in
volved in cases, especially ones in which

there have been violent assaults on victims,"
he commented. At the same time, he ad
mitted that it is a lot easier for a public de
fender to become personally involved with a
defendant. He said on some occasions this
has hampered the effectiveness of attorneys
in court — to the point where they raise nu
merous objections and begin shouting in
court.
While few women have reached high sen
iority levels in the county criminal justice sys
tem, Titus said that 30 to 50 percent of those
recently hired by the district attorney's office
have been women.
"Our office is hiring people basically in
proportion to how they are coming out of
law school," he explained.-He said he be
lieves he reacts no differently toward wom
en, nor has he seen any judges do so. In his
words, "Sex is totally irrelevant."
When he is not performing before a court
or on a stage, Titus collects humorous
dialogues from court, which he may use for a
future book or play. Some of these bloopers
were recently the subject of a Peninsula
Times Tribune story.
"I'm very happy with this job," Titus said.
"Whether it's something I want to be doing
for the next 20 years is something I haven't
decided yet." He said he'sat the point where
he needs to decide whether to stay with the
office on a career basis or go out into private
practice, as many of his colleagues have
done. Reflecting on the future, he remarked
that "someday I might want to run for
judge."
