# Historic auditorium getting a face lift
## 
### Tracy Rosendahl 
Even the most clueless
freshman knows that Stanford
University was built asa memo
rial to Leland Stanford, Jr. . And
any tourguide worth his or her
salt knows that Memorial
Church is dedicated to Leland
Stanford, Sr.. But few students
know the origins of another of
Stanford's famous "Mems" —
Memorial Auditorium.
Mem Aud is the only build
ing on campus constructed pri
marily through student con
tributions. In its lobby are in
scribed the names of Stanford
students and faculty who died
in World War I. The historical
auditorium is meant to pay
tribute to their sacrifice.
Like the other "Mems," the
45-year-old auditorium is also
undergoing renovation.
Five years ago, Mem Aud was
in a sad state of disrepair and a
schedule for needed renova
tions was drawn up. According
to Vicky Holt, an official in the
Facilities and Planning Depart
ment, visual aspects of re
modeling had the highest
priority. The auditorium was
painted for the first time in fif
teen years, new carpeting was
laid and the lobby was re
furbished.
This summer approximately
1700 new seats will be installed
as the culminationof the reno
vation project.
Though the architectural
styleofMem Aud isaesthetical
ly pleasing it is not necessarily
the best style in terms of theat
rical needs, thus the new plans
express a need for some tech

nical renovations. Technical
modifications included the in
stallment of a new patch panel
linking the lights of both Mem
Aud and the Little Theater to
their respective control
boards. A new sound system
was also implemented in the in
itial stage of alterations. Next,
the curtain system and the rest
of the rigging above the stage
were redone. Recently, a com
puterized control panel was in
stalled to alleviate lighting
problems.
The auditorium was ori
ginally constructed in 1937 un
der plans drawn up by the
architectural firm Bakewell and
Brown, the same group that
designed the San Francisco
Opera House.

Mem Aud has been a prima
ry university gathering place
since it was first built. Tradi
tionally, it has been the place
where freshmen first meet
Stanford's president. Classes
are held in Mem Aud and tour
ing professional drama groups
often perforin there. Since
1938, on the first Monday of ev
ery month, a movie from a
travel series has been featured
in the auditorium.
In addition to performances,
Mem Aud houses the offices of
KZSU and the Drama Club.
Probably the most well know
function of the auditorium,
however, is the showing of the
ASSU Sunday Night Flicks.
The Sunday Flicks and Ram's
Head are two of the groups

who most regularly use Mem
Aud. Brian Boorstein, who is in
charge of the Sunday Flicks,
was mainly complimentary in
his comments about Mem
Aud's facilities. He said that vis
ually the auditorium is very
good. Boorstein also men
tioned the many doors which
allow easy access into and out
of the building. The balcony
elicited special mention from
Boorstein. "The heart and sole
of the flicks are the people who
sit in the balcony," he said.
In contrast to Boorstein,
Greg Lambert, a spokesperson
for Ram's Head, said the
auditorium is "accoustically
difficult."
"It is hard to produce
elaborate sound," he added.
This results in very high
budgets for the sound systems
of theatrical productions to be
staged in Mem Aud.
Lambert also mentioned that
the demands on the
auditorium are so great that
some groups cannot use it. He
suggested the future calls for
either a new theater or the in
stallment of a sound system in
Frost Amphitheater.
Some of the differences in
Lambert's and Boorstein's
comments stem from the fact
that Mem Aud was originally
designed for filmsand lectures,
not theatrical productions. For
better viewing the floor was
constructed with a dip of six to
eight inches between the ninth
and 15th rows. Sound from the
stage travels in a straight line
and thus misses direct contact
with these rows.

TIME FOR REPAIRS — Memorial Auditorium, home for many campus activities, is cur
rently in the middle of a renovation project which should be completed this summer
when 1700 new chairs will be installed.
Even the most clueless
freshman knows that Stanford
University was built asa memo
rial to Leland Stanford, Jr. . And
any tourguide worth his or her
salt knows that Memorial
Church is dedicated to Leland
Stanford, Sr.. But few students
know the origins of another of
Stanford's famous "Mems" —
Memorial Auditorium.
Mem Aud is the only build
ing on campus constructed pri
marily through student con
tributions. In its lobby are in
scribed the names of Stanford
students and faculty who died
in World War I. The historical
auditorium is meant to pay
tribute to their sacrifice.
Like the other "Mems," the
45-year-old auditorium is also
undergoing renovation.
Five years ago, Mem Aud was
in a sad state of disrepair and a
schedule for needed renova
tions was drawn up. According
to Vicky Holt, an official in the
Facilities and Planning Depart
ment, visual aspects of re
modeling had the highest
priority. The auditorium was
painted for the first time in fif
teen years, new carpeting was
laid and the lobby was re
furbished.
This summer approximately
1700 new seats will be installed
as the culminationof the reno
vation project.
Though the architectural
styleofMem Aud isaesthetical
ly pleasing it is not necessarily
the best style in terms of theat
rical needs, thus the new plans
express a need for some tech

nical renovations. Technical
modifications included the in
stallment of a new patch panel
linking the lights of both Mem
Aud and the Little Theater to
their respective control
boards. A new sound system
was also implemented in the in
itial stage of alterations. Next,
the curtain system and the rest
of the rigging above the stage
were redone. Recently, a com
puterized control panel was in
stalled to alleviate lighting
problems.
The auditorium was ori
ginally constructed in 1937 un
der plans drawn up by the
architectural firm Bakewell and
Brown, the same group that
designed the San Francisco
Opera House.

Mem Aud has been a prima
ry university gathering place
since it was first built. Tradi
tionally, it has been the place
where freshmen first meet
Stanford's president. Classes
are held in Mem Aud and tour
ing professional drama groups
often perforin there. Since
1938, on the first Monday of ev
ery month, a movie from a
travel series has been featured
in the auditorium.
In addition to performances,
Mem Aud houses the offices of
KZSU and the Drama Club.
Probably the most well know
function of the auditorium,
however, is the showing of the
ASSU Sunday Night Flicks.
The Sunday Flicks and Ram's
Head are two of the groups

who most regularly use Mem
Aud. Brian Boorstein, who is in
charge of the Sunday Flicks,
was mainly complimentary in
his comments about Mem
Aud's facilities. He said that vis
ually the auditorium is very
good. Boorstein also men
tioned the many doors which
allow easy access into and out
of the building. The balcony
elicited special mention from
Boorstein. "The heart and sole
of the flicks are the people who
sit in the balcony," he said.
In contrast to Boorstein,
Greg Lambert, a spokesperson
for Ram's Head, said the
auditorium is "accoustically
difficult."
"It is hard to produce
elaborate sound," he added.
This results in very high
budgets for the sound systems
of theatrical productions to be
staged in Mem Aud.
Lambert also mentioned that
the demands on the
auditorium are so great that
some groups cannot use it. He
suggested the future calls for
either a new theater or the in
stallment of a sound system in
Frost Amphitheater.
Some of the differences in
Lambert's and Boorstein's
comments stem from the fact
that Mem Aud was originally
designed for filmsand lectures,
not theatrical productions. For
better viewing the floor was
constructed with a dip of six to
eight inches between the ninth
and 15th rows. Sound from the
stage travels in a straight line
and thus misses direct contact
with these rows.
