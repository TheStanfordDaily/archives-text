## Todd Pickett Biblical equality for women 
### 
Sixty thousand women responded
to a religion survey conducted by
McCaH's magazine in 1978. The vast
majority called themselves Chris
tians; more than half of these further
defined themselves as"born-again."
During the 19705, women vigor
ously continued to lobby for the
eradication of attitudes and laws
which have denied them rights and
worth in American society.
For some of those whose lives have
intersected both of these spheres,
the seeming male bias in the Bible's
description of male and female roles
is a stumbling block. Some who can
not reconcile their understanding of
the Biblical perspective with their at
titudes toward women's rights even
tually dismiss the scriptures as irrele
vant to modern issue.
Before we condemn these Biblical
concepts as culturally obsolete, let us
consider the possibility that society
has falsely measured people's worth
by the social function they serve.
Rather, I believe God created man
and woman with equal worth, man
ifested in the different ways he has
equipped them to serve. "And Cod
created man in His own image, in the
image of God He created him; male
and female He created them." â€”
Gen. 1:27
The principle put forth in this first
mention of mankind preaches total
equality before God. The writer says
that male and female together reflect
the image of God. No more divine
image of the Creator emanates from
the man than from the woman and
no more from the woman than from
the man. Both male and female make
up mankind.
Nothing suggests that because the
man breathed first he acquired su
premacy over the woman. Having re
ceived the authority to name the in
habitants of the earth, man upon
seeing woman said, "This is now
bone of my bone and flesh of my
flesh. She shall be called Woman be
cause she was taken out of man." He
recognized their equality!
Furthermore, the term "helper,"
applied only once to woman, does
not indicate lower status, for it is used
17 times to describe God in the Old
Testament. Indeed after Adam was

created, the sequence reversed and
man has coine out of woman since,
thus eliminating any foundation in
creation for male arrogance.
For a society to successfully estab
lish sexual equality of worth, public
attitude that deems both sexes in
valuable to the functioning of society
is imperative. Much of the disparage
ment and injustice cast upon the
woman from centuries past to today
has been grounded in demeaning
views of her worth. What we have to
day are laws and proposed laws
which address the failure of mankind
to recognize her worth. *

Before we condemn
these biblical
concepts as culturally
obsolete, let us
consider the
possibility that society
has falsely measured
one's worth by the
social function they
serve. Rather, I
believe Cod created
man and woman with
equal worth,
manifested in the
different way he has
equipped them to
serve.

The apostle Paul, accused by some
of sexism, reiterates the principle of
equal worth, "There is neither Jew
nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free man, there is neither male nor
female, for you are all one in Christ
jesus." Paul purposely uses pairs seen
as unequal by ancient Greeks in de
nying that these rankings of worth
have any bearing on one's worth
before God.
Paul, in another letter, elucidates
the equally important but unique

roles of man and woman in a mar
riage relationship. The root of our
unhappiness concerning the New
Testament view of roles seems to
come from the definitions of terms
like "head," "submission" and "sub
ject to."
According to Paul, God has de
emed man "head" of the rela
tionship, for in him God has chosen
to display His attribute of authority.
But "head" does not mean "boss,"
rather, it is the responsibility given to
the man to direct his family in paths
of godliness. He is no mpre "spiritu
al" than woman, but is fulfilling a role
given him by God.
While God commends the man to
headship just once in this passage, he
commands him three times to love
his wife as Christ loved the church.
Christ died for mankind. A husband's
love might be manifested in doing
the laundry, changing diapers, allow
ing the woman the freedom to work
and actively soliciting her input on all
decisions.
In such an atmosphere of love, the
woman can be submissive (which
does not mean "less than!") with full
confidence she will be honored. In
such a relationship she may exercise
the special sensitivities and attributes
that, though expressed by men as
well, are unique when expressed by a
woman, the mother of all living
things.
The attributes of a woman may also
be exercised from a corporate chair
or a doctor's office, but are absolute
ly essential in the home where the
man and woman as one entity raise
their children.
Although many other issues re
main to be addressed and much
scripture requires closer attention, it
is my belief that the Biblical concept
of diversity in equality does not de
grade either the man or the woman.
Rather, to deny the attributes that set
them apart would be to disrupt a bal
ance meant to bring into complete
ness the nature of each sex and to
provide stability through healthy
family ties.
