## Facing death affects abortion decision 
### 
Since abortion is a salient issue at
Stanford, my wife and I would like to
offer a different perspective through
the hindsight of experience. As pa
rents, we have had to grapple with
the prospect of abortion in the face
of possible genetic defects in our
children. We have also been the reci
pients of an adopted child and after
10 years of marriage, we are living
with the consequences of our
choices.
Emily: It is easy to assume that our
lives will go as smoothly as we have
planned them â€” without the suffer
ing and hardship that is often part of
life. My husband and I have always
wanted children, and when I became
pregnant in February 1975, we were
both thrilled. Our son, David
Jonathan, was born in October and
the gift of this little life overwhelmed

us with joy. Three days after he was
born, he began having trouble
breathing and we rushed him back to
the hospital. Six days later, our son's
life ended.
We later found out that David died
because of an enzyme deficiency
carried by both me and my husband.
We have a 75 percent chance of hav
ing a healthy baby and a 25 percent
chance that it will not have that one
enzyme necessary for life.
Because of the 75 percent proba
bility that we could have a healthy
child, we decided to go ahead with
having children. During my second
pregnancy, we had an amneocen
tesis test in order to determine the
baby's health. To our joy, the results
showed no deficiencies in our child. I
unpacked the baby clothes, set up
the furniture and anticipated the due

date. Jessica was born in November
1976. Our rejoicing at her birth lasted
only a little while. Jessica began to
show the same signs as David and af
ter five days she died.
In the difficult days after, my hus
band and I considered adopting a
child, an idea which had its origin
shortly after David's death. Knowing
our pain at the loss of two children, a
group of Christians prayed that God
would give us a baby before Christ
mas.
Two weeks later, our daughter Re
becca was bom. We brought her
home when she was just 24 hours old.
Looking back on Rebecca's first four
and half years, I feel unable to de
scribe our joy, how much we love
and how much she means to us. Her
life seems like a miracle to me when I
realize how easily it could have been
ended by an abortion.
Having a child die or giving a child
up for another person to raise is a
painful experience; but strength and
maturity seldom come without pain.
Brian and I will always have the ut
most respect for the woman who car
ried Rebecca for nine months. That
woman's gift to us and to Rebecca is
one we will never forget.
Brian: Because of the deficiency
which claimed the lives of our first
two children, Emily (who is now
pregnant) and I have had to deal with
the possibility of abortion. We would
never have chosen the suffering and
anguish which preceeded the gift of
our first child, Becky. But this was
life's way of building us up into
mature people.
Though David only lived nine days
and Jessica only six days, I learned to
know them and to love them. I
learned that whether a child lives

nine days or nine years, each life is
significant and has its own purpose.
Their lives taught me empathy.
They broke me from my elitism
which was so highly valued while I
was at Stanford. The experience gave
me compassion for the weak and
handicapped. David and Jessica
taught me the proper values in life.
The death of our son happened just
after our move into a new con
dominium. During his sickness, those
things which had seemed so impor
tant to us suddenly lost their value
when compared with the life of a
child.
I learned that life is filled with trag
edy yet it is through tragedy that we
learn how to love. Our friends sur
rounded us with care, sacrificed the
urgencies of their own lives, prayed
with us and cried with us. Through it
all, I learned that life is a gift.
Now that I have two children and
my wife is pregnant again, I find I do
not take any of them for granted. Ev
ery night as I tuck them in, my heart
overflows with joy at the privilege I
have of serving them and being a
father to them.
Finally, I realized my need for a
Helper who could empathize with
my need and strengthen me. I found
the resource of such an adequate
helper to me in God who could em
phathize with my broken heart as He,
too, gave up His Son.
Because of what has passed, I can
not think that I have the right to abort
a child, even one whose genetic de
fect might lead to death. That choice
I must leave to the Creator of life.
