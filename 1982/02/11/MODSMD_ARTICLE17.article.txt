## Elitist heckling at Stanford 
### 
The audience behavior at the re
cent debate between Phyllis Schlafly
and visiting Law Prof. Catherine
McKinnon made me wonder what it
means to be a Stanford student and
what it means to be a liberal. For a
moment, I thought that I had wan
dered into an ASSU flick instead of a
forum for intelligent debate.
The booing and hissing by a por
tion of the audience aimed at Schlafly
has already been criticized — my
purpose is to ask how it could occur
at such an "enlightened" institution
as Stanford University.
The cacophony of moans and
groans which greeted Schlafly any
time she made one of her more con
troversial assertions disturbed me
mostly because I couldn't find a com
mon denominator between myself
and those causing the disturbance.
Intelligence? I am enough of an elitist
to believe that certain argumentsand
philosophical rationales may be
above the average person and that
when employed to support un
popular stands may incite some to vi

olent opposition towards that which
they don't understand?
But this was not some street corner
rally in San Francisco, it was a debate
at Stanford University, an institution
which sometimes pulis a muscle clap
ping itself on the back for the ex
traordinary intelligence and diversity
of its student body.
Politics? Everybody "knows" that
conservatives are close-minded and

You see, I think that we all have something of
a heckler living inside of us; because our
human nature causes us to lash out when our
most cherished notions are assaulted. To the
extent that we harbor thoughts and beliefs
which.. .we have not thoroughly thought
out, then we are vulnerable to the feelings of
anger and fear that make a person stand up
and boo.

liberals open-minded. Maybe the
audience was filled with those nasty
conservatives whose ilk had put
Scopes on trial for teaching evolu
tion. Unfortunately, Schlafly was
probably the most conservative per
son in the room and she was drawing
the fire. Besides, feminism allies itself
with the struggle of all groups to
achieve an egalitarian social ideal
and, if it can be placed on the con
ventional politics spectrum, deserves
to be put somewhere in the liberal
camp.
Having slain my two favorite
scapegoats, I was left with my original
question; why had there been such
an open display of hostility toward a
sincere and respected advocate of a
conservative viewpoint? What drove
a portion of these "liberal" Stanford
students to such blatant distourtesy?
Were Schlafly's views objec
tionable because they seemed out
landish and extreme, rooted in as
sumption considered old-fashioned
by many? Were the hecklers simply
frustrated by the conceptual chasm
between Schlaffy's simple assertions
and McKinnon's intricate reason
ings? I think not. Such an attitude
might engender impatience and per
haps even condescension and sym
pathy but not hostility.
I believe that the people who
heckled Schlafly did so because they
felt threatened. Like many in the
crowd that night, they had already
formulated their beliefs about the so
cietal role of women. I believe what
distinguished those who felt the
need to boo and hiss from the rest of
the crowd — who managed to be
have just as enthusiastically but also
politely — was that the hecklers had
made up their minds without con
sidering the other point of view.
The hecklers entered Kresge
auditorium very comfortable with
their beliefs and Schlafly deprived
them of that comfort. She wasable to
do so not because of any inherent
rectitude in her position or because
of any flaw in McKinnon's able pres
entation but because of the shakiness

ot the foundation of their own be
liefs.
They knew what they wanted to
believe but not why they believed it,
so they were vulnerable. Having
closed their minds prematurely and
invested a'sense of importance in
their decision, how could they feel
anything but threatened by a forceful
presentation of the opposite view
point.

People who heckle have closed
minds. As I was leaving the debate, it
occurred to me that it was my own
detachment from the issues of the
debate that had allowed me to sit and
pass judgement on the character of
other people's responses to it.
Althugh I believe feminist issues to
be of great importance, they do not
seize my emotions as do some issues.
I say this not to slight the feminist
cause but as a frank admission of my
limited level of sensitivity to the issue
disclosed.
As I reached for the door, I im
agined that the debate had been
about equality between races. Pictur
ing the scene, I saw myself standing
in the crowd, hissing and booing at
the speaker.
You see, I think that we all have
something of a heckler living inside
of us; because our human nature
causes us to lash out when our most
cherished notions are assaulted. To
the extent that we harbor thoughts
and beliefs which, through eitheren
vironmental prejudice or intellectual
sloth, we have not fully thought out,
then we are vulnerable to the feel
ings of anger and fear that make a
person stand up and boo someone
who is simply trying to tell his or her
opinion.
This fear of my own dark side
brought me to my original point.
What does it mean to be a liberal stu
dent at Stanford? A true liberal is one
who is open to the forces of change.
To be so, he must be willing to in
corporate new ideas into his beliefs.
The word "liberal" has come to
identify a certain set of views on a
range of issues. The true spirit of lib
eralism is, I fear, as lost to the left as it
is to the right.
I believe that to be a student here
and to get all one can from the place,
one must be a liberal. The alternative
is that one day you may find, as I did,
that this portrait of a heckler can all
too easily become a mirror.

with the struggle of all groups to
achieve an egalitarian social ideal
and, if it can be placed on the con

to be put somewhere in the liberal
camp.
Having slain my two favorite
scapegoats, I was left with my original
question; why had there been such
an open display of hostility toward a
sincere and respected advocate of a
conservative viewpoint? What drove
a portion of these "liberal" Stanford
students to such blatant distourtesy?
Were Schlafly's views objec
tionable because they seemed out
landish and extreme, rooted in as
sumption considered old-fashioned
by many? Were the hecklers simply
frustrated by the conceptual chasm
between Schlaffy's simple assertions
and McKinnon's intricate reason
ings? I think not. Such an attitude
might engender impatience and per
haps even condescension and sym
pathy but not hostility.
I believe that the people who
heckled Schlafly did so because they
felt threatened. Like many in the
crowd that night, they had already
formulated their beliefs about the so
cietal role of women. I believe what
distinguished those who felt the
need to boo and hiss from the rest of
the crowd — who managed to be
have just as enthusiastically but also
politely — was that the hecklers had
made up their minds without con
sidering the other point of view.
The hecklers entered Kresge
auditorium very comfortable with
their beliefs and Schlafly deprived
them of that comfort. She wasable to
do so not because of any inherent
rectitude in her position or because
of any flaw in McKinnon's able pres
entation but because of the shakiness

ot the foundation of their own be
liefs.
They knew what they wanted to
believe but not why they believed it,
so they were vulnerable. Having
closed their minds prematurely and
invested a'sense of importance in
their decision, how could they feel
anything but threatened by a forceful
presentation of the opposite view
point.

People who heckle have closed
minds. As I was leaving the debate, it
occurred to me that it was my own
detachment from the issues of the
debate that had allowed me to sit and
pass judgement on the character of
other people's responses to it.
Althugh I believe feminist issues to
be of great importance, they do not
seize my emotions as do some issues.
I say this not to slight the feminist
cause but as a frank admission of my
limited level of sensitivity to the issue
disclosed.
As I reached for the door, I im
agined that the debate had been
about equality between races. Pictur
ing the scene, I saw myself standing
in the crowd, hissing and booing at
the speaker.
You see, I think that we all have
something of a heckler living inside
of us; because our human nature
causes us to lash out when our most
cherished notions are assaulted. To
the extent that we harbor thoughts
and beliefs which, through eitheren
vironmental prejudice or intellectual
sloth, we have not fully thought out,
then we are vulnerable to the feel
ings of anger and fear that make a
person stand up and boo someone
who is simply trying to tell his or her
opinion.
This fear of my own dark side
brought me to my original point.
What does it mean to be a liberal stu
dent at Stanford? A true liberal is one
who is open to the forces of change.
To be so, he must be willing to in
corporate new ideas into his beliefs.
The word "liberal" has come to
identify a certain set of views on a
range of issues. The true spirit of lib
eralism is, I fear, as lost to the left as it
is to the right.
I believe that to be a student here
and to get all one can from the place,
one must be a liberal. The alternative
is that one day you may find, as I did,
that this portrait of a heckler can all
too easily become a mirror.

The audience behavior at the re
cent debate between Phyllis Schlafly
and visiting Law Prof. Catherine
McKinnon made me wonder what it
means to be a Stanford student and
what it means to be a liberal. For a
moment, I thought that I had wan
dered into an ASSU flick instead of a
forum for intelligent debate.
The booing and hissing by a por
tion of the audience aimed at Schlafly
has already been criticized — my
purpose is to ask how it could occur
at such an "enlightened" institution
as Stanford University.
The cacophony of moans and
groans which greeted Schlafly any
time she made one of her more con
troversial assertions disturbed me
mostly because I couldn't find a com
mon denominator between myself
and those causing the disturbance.
Intelligence? I am enough of an elitist
to believe that certain argumentsand
philosophical rationales may be
above the average person and that
when employed to support un
popular stands may incite some to vi

olent opposition towards that which
they don't understand?
But this was not some street corner
rally in San Francisco, it was a debate
at Stanford University, an institution
which sometimes pulis a muscle clap
ping itself on the back for the ex
traordinary intelligence and diversity
of its student body.
