## Remember it's really Susan's birthday 
### 
As February 15th draws closer and
we eagerly anticipate the respite of a
three day weekend, it is interesting to
note that there is not a single national
holiday honoring a woman. It is also
interesting to note that the day to
which we assign the birthday cele
brations of two of our greatest presi
dents is, in fact, neither of their
birthdays, but Susan B. Anthony's.
It is for this reason that we feel
Stanford, as an innovative and open
minded community, should take a
moment on this February 15th to re
member the woman whose work

paved the way for the adoption of the
19th amendment to the Constitution
and the worldwide recognition of
human rights expressed in the chart
er of the United Nations.
During her lifetime, Susan
Brownell Anthony taught school, or
ganized temperence societies, and
after 1854, devoted her life to the
antislavery movement and women's
rights. She wasanagentforthe Amer
ican Antislavery Society and was co
publisherofa NewYorkliberalweek
ly entitled The Revolution.
Anthony campaigned nationally

for the right of women to control
their own property and to have
guardianship of their children in case
of divorce.
Demanding for women the same
political and civil rights extended to
black males by the 14th and 15th
amendments, she claimed her right
to vote as a person and a citizen in
1872.
Undanted, she went on to serve as
president of the National American
Woman Suffrage Association and
helped to compile the first four vol
umes of The History of Woman Suf

/rage. Fourteen years after her death
in 1906, Anthony's dream was finally
realized: the "Anthony Amend
ment," granting full female suffrage,
became a part of our Constitution.
As a nation whose citizenry is more
than half female, it is time we paidthe
majority the tribute that it is due.
While enjoying the luxury of this free
day, let us remember not only
George and Abe, but also Susan.
