# Energy funds waiting for student proposals
## 
### Bob Cohn 
Although the University's
Energy Conservation Center
has more than $6000 waiting to
be used for student energy
conservation projects, no one
yet has taken advantage of the
funds, according to spokes
persons from the center.
Any individual or student
residence with a conservation
project isqualified for funding,
Center officials John Eaton and
Nancy Lindborg say.
"The idea is to try to get stu
dent involvement in energy
conservation projects," Eaton
said. Thus, if a student has an
idea for an energy conserva
tion project, he or she need
only submit a proposal to the
Center. If the idea is accepted,
the necessary funds will be ap
propriated.
The reason that students
have not been coming forth
with lots of ideas is twofold, ac
cording to Eaton and Lindborg.
Eirst, most students do not
know that the money even ex
ists and second, students do
not know what type of energy
conservation projects would
merit funding. Eaton and
Lindborg said that they are at
tempting to solve these prob
lems.
The best type of projects are
those "that will either involve a
lot of students or be helpful to
the house," Eaton said. "It's
also nice to have projects that a
lot of people can benefit from
or learn from."
Eaton and Lindborg said
"small-scale solar projects" are
probably the most practical.

More specifically, solar heat
ing systems, solar greenhouses,
weather stripping and insulat
ing curtains are just some of the
projects that are viable and
qualify for funding, the two
said. Besides projects, the
money can also be used to or
ganize and fund student-run
workshops to show how
weather stripping, insulation,
thermostats and lighting sys
tems can be used to their ut
most effectiveness.
Eaton pointed out that mon
ey could be used for "a pro
gram of educational materials"
such as posters, flyers and dis
plays. He said heightening
energy conservation aware
ness is perhaps equally as im
portant as designing a working
project.
Students who think they
have ideas for projects can pick
up proposal sheets from the
Center in the basement of
Crothers Memorial Hall. Eaton
said that students with ideas for
spring quarter should start now
because "it takes two to three
weeks to get going."
Also some proposals that
seem wonderful may be re
jected. Last year a Trancos pro
posal to build a solar jacuzzi
was turned down.
The money at the Center's
disposal is due to the efforts of
two students. Two years ago,
after Rich Hefter and Mike
Siegel completed their
freshman year, they planned a
bike trip from Stanford to their
homes in Chicago.
The purpose of the 2000-mile
jaunt "was to raise money for

the Eneigy Conservation Cen
ter," Hefter said. Hefter and
Siegel solicited cents per mile
pledges and set off to see the
country and raise money at the
same time.
Through consultation with
Paul Edwards, director of the
office of development, the stu
dents said they learned how to
raise as much money as pos
sible.
"The office of develop
ment's role, my role, was just to
instruct Mike and Rich on
some techniques of fund-rais
ing," Edwards said. The two
then solicited pledges, made
the trip, and collected the
money.
"All the gifts were acknowl
edged," Edwards said, and by
November 1980 $6200 had
been raised.
Originally Hefter and Siegel
said they had hoped to use the
money "for a specific project,
but it took too long for Univer
sity appproval." Their original
idea was to install a solar water
heater in Stern Hall. Because of
a lack of planning and time and
University red tape, the bikers
said they simply decided to
pass the earning along to Eaton
at the Energy Conservation
Center.
"We were hoping students
would come up with ideas,"
Hefter said.
A year and a half later, the
money is still sitting in a bank
account in the Center's name.
Both Hefter and Siegel now
work at the Center promoting
student conservation and
"trying to get reps motivated in
the dorms."
