# Fines next quarter
## Bike parking enforcement stiffens 
### Tim Lundergan 
Owners of illegally parked and
locked bicycles will start finding
tickets attached to their two
wheelers beginning Monday.
The tags, which will be handed out
by students working for the Office of
Public Safety, will serve only as warn
ings and will not be accompanied by
fines, according to Marty Raymond
of that office. Next quarter, however,
deputized police officers will begin
enforcing the more serious vio
lations.
The tagging campaign is directed
at bicyclists whose vehicles block
doorways, fire escapes and ramps for
the handicapped. Students who
leave their bikes either unlocked or
unregistered will also receive tags.
Raymond said particular attention
would be paid to areas where "No
Bike Parking" signs are posted, such
as the Quad near the political science
building, Green Library by the
wheelchair ramp and Encina Com

mons.
Though it is not illegal to park near
the entrance to most buildings, bi
cycles blocking entrances could
cause "total chaos" in the event of a
fire or other emergency, said Ray
mond.
The Bicycle Safety Commission has
received numerous complaints from
departments near the inner Quad
concerning mopeds speeding
through the area. It is illegal for mo
tor-driven vehicles to use the inner
campus, Raymond said, although
pedalling mopeds is allowed there.
The commission has also received
complaints from handicapped stu
dents unable to navigate their wheel
chairs through heavy bicycle traffic.
John Brennan, who is handi
capped, said "it's a real pain" getting
around bicycles blocking doors or
ramps. Although the warning tag
program cannot hurt the situation,
Brennan said he believes the prob
lem will continue until tagging is

backed up by fines.
One teacher has continually re
quested that Green Library remedy
the situation, Brennan said, but noth
ing has been done. Painting handi
capped signs near ramps proved inef
fective because the prohibitions
were not enforced, he said.
"People would probably not block
the ramps if they remembered,"
Brennan said, but added that they
probably would not remember un
less they feared receiving a fine.
In 1981, 524 bicycles were reported
stolen from campus, Raymond said.
He estimated that many more thefts
went unreported. Publicsafety work
ers will be tagging inadequately
locked bikes to warn owners how
easily their vehicles can be stolen.
Raymond recommends using a "U
lock" or a thick cable.
Many bikesare parked illegally be
cause of a shortage of bicycle racks.

ILLEGAL PARKING â€” Illegally parked bicycles, such as these blocking the wheelchair ramp in front of
Green Library, will be cited with warning tags starting next Monday. No fines will be attached to the cita
tions until next quarter, according to the Public Safety Office. At that time, however, deputized police
officers will begin to enforce the more serious violations.
