# Andrea Wilson, 1981 graduate, wins Marshall Scholarship

### Kathy Christie 
When asked why she originally ap
plied for the Marshall Scholarship,
Andrea Wilson replied that she "did
it by chance in a way."
Even so, it was not by chance that
Wilson was chosen to be a recipient
of this distinguished award which al
lows selected American college
graduate students to study in Eng
land.
A 1981 graduate with a degree in
Classics, Wilson received many other
awards before the Marshall. A mem
ber of Phi Beta Kappa, Wilson also
won three awards from the Classics
Department while at Stanford. She
also received the Dante Prize given
by the Dante Studies Journal, a
Harvard University publication.
Wilson also studied abroad as an
undergraduate. She spent a semester
at The Intercollegiate Center for

Classical Studies in Rome and at
tended the summer session of The
American School of Classical Studies
in Athens.
The Marshall Scholarship, founded
after World War II by the British to
commemorate the wartime efforts of
U.S. Secretary of State George
Marshall, annually provides funding
for its recipients at any British univer
sity. The competition for the award is
on a par with the more celebrated
Rhodes Scholarship.
The selection process for the
Marshall is as rigorous as the com
petition itself, Wilson said. First an
applicant must be chosen to repre
sent his school, a process which in
volves both a written application and
an interview. Wilson said that her in
terview at Stanford was very difficult,
but that it is made so purposely to

help candidates to "gear up for oth
ers."
For Wilson, the next step in the
process involved an interview in San
Francisco with seven members of the
Marshall Committee. Wilson said
they "seemed to be looking for poise
— not what you said, but how you
said it." She added that she "tried to
take the final interview lightly and to
keep a sense of humor."
Wilson speculated that her in
volvement in tutoring students in
Stanford's Structured Liberal Educa
tion program, coaching youth foot
ball and carpentry were the things
that impressed the interviewers.
"They were impressed with the un
usual activities," she said.
Prof. Marsh McCall, chairman of
the Classics Department, expressed
no surprise at Wilson's winning of the

Marshall.
"She's very, very bright — it's just
as simple as that. She is articulate
about her areas of academic interest
and she's quick in conversation." He
also added, "It's a very appropriate
thing for someone with her interests
to want to do postgraduate study in
England where so much of this work
goes on."
Although she learned of her selec
tion forthe scholarshipseveral weeks
ago, Wilson has yet to find out
whether she will be attending Liver
pool or Oxford, her primary choices.
After winning the award her applica
tion materials were forwarded to
both universities where they could
be evaluated in the normal ad
missions process.
Wilson's first choice is Oxford,
where her father also studied. There

she would be enrolled in a bachelor's
degree program called "The Greats"
which impressed her by its wide
range of study. She explains that it is a
bachelor's, and not a master's, pro
gram "because English people start
classics a lot younger."
Until she leaves in the fall, Wilson
will be doing technical writing and
editing for Synergetic Computers in
Palo Alto. SheisalsostudyingFrench,
German, and Greek composition on
her own, as well as tutoring in Greek
and Latin to undergraduates here.
As for her plans studying in Eng
land, Wilson says"I would like to be a
professor of classics, but the job mar
ket in academics is extremely tight."
Wilson said Prof. Susan Stevens,
her adviser, was especially sup
portive during her undergraduate
studies here.

ball and carpentry were the things
that impressed the interviewers.
"They were impressed with the un
usual activities," she said.
Prof. Marsh McCall, chairman of
the Classics Department, expressed
no surprise at Wilson's winning of the

Marshall.
"She's very, very bright — it's just
as simple as that. She is articulate
about her areas of academic interest
and she's quick in conversation." He
also added, "It's a very appropriate
thing for someone with her interests
to want to do postgraduate study in
England where so much of this work
goes on."
Although she learned of her selec
tion forthe scholarshipseveral weeks
ago, Wilson has yet to find out
whether she will be attending Liver
pool or Oxford, her primary choices.
After winning the award her applica
tion materials were forwarded to
both universities where they could
be evaluated in the normal ad
missions process.
Wilson's first choice is Oxford,
where her father also studied. There

she would be enrolled in a bachelor's
degree program called "The Greats"
which impressed her by its wide
range of study. She explains that it is a
bachelor's, and not a master's, pro
gram "because English people start
classics a lot younger."
Until she leaves in the fall, Wilson
will be doing technical writing and
editing for Synergetic Computers in
Palo Alto. SheisalsostudyingFrench,
German, and Greek composition on
her own, as well as tutoring in Greek
and Latin to undergraduates here.
As for her plans studying in Eng
land, Wilson says"I would like to be a
professor of classics, but the job mar
ket in academics is extremely tight."
Wilson said Prof. Susan Stevens,
her adviser, was especially sup
portive during her undergraduate
studies here.
