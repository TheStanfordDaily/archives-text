Federal workers face unpaid vacations
Washington — Thousands of federal government workers are being
notified that they must take off one day every two weeks without pay to
help cut government costs under the Reagan administration s trimmed
down budget.
Affected so far by the compulsory furloughs, federal officials said yes
terday, are 23,000 employees in the Federal Aviation Administration,
5900 in the Census Bureau, 3000 in the Office of Personnel Management
and 130 headquarters employees in the U.S. Mint. They will lose from
five to 12 work days between April 1 and Sept. 30.
Among employees not scheduled for furloughing are workers in the
Department of Defense and the Postal Service.
The mandatory furloughs are the direct result of the administration's
cuts in government outlays. With the notable exception of the Pen
tagon, virtually every federal agency has seen its budget slashed below
the amount originally recommended for the current fiscal year by
former President Jimmy Carter.
John Scholzen, spokesman for the Office of Personnel Management,
successor to the old Civil Service Commission, emphasized that the no
pay furloughs were due "purely to the money pinch.
Initial reaction from unions representing federal employees was
cautious. .
"If it's going to be a choice between RIFs (reductions in force fir
ings) and furloughs, of course we're going to support the furloughs/'
Sandra Arnold of the National Federation of Federal Employees said.
"It's the lesser of two evils."
Reagan abandons silo hardening plan
Washington — The Reagan administration is discarding the plan it an
nounced in October to "super-harden" the underground silos in which
it will put the first 40 new MX intercontinental ballistic mis
siles, according to civilian and military officials at the Pen
tagon.
The administration said at the time it could super-harden
the silos to protect the missiles from enemy nuclear attack
over the next few years, while it decides on a permanent bas
ing scheme to keep them invulnerable to attack over the
long run.
The president had criticized former President Jimmy
Carter during the 1980 campaign for not having a feasible
plan to protect the new MX, thereby creating a "window of
vulnerability" in U.S. defenses.
Abandonment of the hardening idea is the second impor
tant departure in four months from the administration's ori
ginal $19-billion-plus plan for the interim deployment of the
MX, a huge new ocean-spanning missile that will carry 10 nu
clear bombs in its nose and is meant as the backbone of the
U.S. nuclear retaliatory force for the 1990s and beyond.
The administration indicated in October that it intended
to put the first 40 MXs in former Titan 2 silos, which meant
there would be no diminution of U.S. defenses, since the
older Titans were scheduled to be withdrawn anyway.
On Dec. 31, however, the Pentagon announced that it had
decided instead to put the first MXs in some of the silos now
occupied by the 1000 U.S. land-based Minuteman missiles.
These are the silos officials have now decided will not be su
per-hardened.
From a political standpoint, the hardening and Titan
apsects of the original plan were key elements, in that they
made the president's controversial decision on MX seem
somewhat more logical to Congress and the public.
Reagan firm on record-deficit budget
Washington — President Ronald Reagan refused to retreat
yesterday from his plan for reducing inflation in the years
ahead even though he acknowledged the nation must en
dure the highest unemployment in decades and a recession
along the way.
In an economic report to Congress, Reagan also held firm
ly to his record-deficit budget and predicted that his tax-cut
medicine would nurse the nation back to a "vigorous eco
nomic recovery" this year.
In the clearest language to date, the administration ac
knowledged essentially that it is fighting inflation with a re
cession and high unemployment, at least temporarily.
The report acknowledged the "short-lived trade-off be
tween unemployment and the rate of inflation" and said:
"This means that policies designed to reduce inflation signif
icantly will temporarily increase unemployment and reduce
output growth."
Nevertheless, "the decision to end inflation over a period

of several years will be sustained by this administration, even
though short-run costs will be suffered before long-term
benefits begin to accrue," the report declared.
Reagan's economic forecast sees unemployment averag
ing 8.9 percent throughout 1982, the highest sustained job
less rate since World War 11. The jobless rate is expected to
average 7.9 percent in 1983.
Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is
predicted to show a steady deceleration from 9.4 percent in
1981 to 6.6 percent this year, 5.1 percent in 1983 and 4.7 per
cent in 1984.
El Salvador murder suspects testify
Zacatecoluca, El Salvador — Six suspects in the slaying of
four American church women were dismissed from the
armed forces and taken before a magistrate yesterday to tes
tify behind closed doors about the long-stalled case.
Although the testimony was not made public, the move
represented the first important development in the case
since six members of the feared National Guard were placed
under "provisional arrest" last April.
According to sources familiar with the case, two of those
six were quietly released just three weeks ago and two other
suspects — described as cooperative — took their place.
The two new suspects, Salvador Rivera Franco and Carlos
Contreras Palacios, along with the remaining four, were
flown by helicopter from the capital to this provincial city.
Zacatecoluca is just a few miles from the grassy field where
the four women were found buried in a mass grave in De
cember 1980 — two days after their abduction.
Contreras testified for two hours and Rivera for more than
three hours before Judge Bernardo Rauda Murcia emerged
to tell reporters that he would have nothing to say about the
testimony.
Rauda said he would take statements from all six suspects
and evaluate all the evidence in the case before deciding
whether to order a trial or drop the charges.
The case, which has provoked outcries of protest in the
United States against aid to the government of El Salvador,
had frustrated investigators from the beginning.
A major factor was the obvious reluctance of the high
command of the armed forces to probe too deeply into the
affair for fear of arousing jealousies between the army and
the National Guard and tarnishing the presumed integrity of
the military.
Byrd calls for budget withdrawal
Washington — Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) called on President Ronald Reagan yesterday to
withdraw his record-deficit budget for 1983 and offer a sub
stitute proposal with less red ink and "more realistic" eco
nomic assumptions.

Byrd, noting that President Jimmy Carter had sent a revised
spending plan to Congress in 1980 that called for wiping out
the deficit projected in his original proposal, urged Reagan
to "take the same kind of courageous step as a necessary start
to true economic recovery.
"I am looking for a document we in Congress can work
with, one based on realistic assumptions, one which shows a
much clearer trend toward a balanced budget," Byrd said in
a letter to the president.
Budget Director David Stockman, speaking to reporters
on Capitol Hill, said of Byrd's request: "Sen. Byrd said the
same thing last year and we rejected it then. It's a little bit of a
premature response."
U.S. considering arms sales to Jordan
Amman, Jordan — The United States will renew its efforts
to sell mobile anti-aircraft missiles to Jordan and is prepared
to discuss selling sophisticated F-16 jet fighters, U.S. defense
officials said yesterday.
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, arriving here for a
two-day visit, said the Reagan administration may ask Con
gress to lift its ban on selling the Hawk mobile missile system
to Jordan. That ban was imposed after Israel objected in 1974
when the United States agreed to sell Jordan the system.
Since then, Jordan has turned to the Soviet Union to up
date its anti-aircraft missile system, a decision that raised
questions in Washington last fall about whether Jordan was
embarking on a major realignment away from the West.
Weinberger arrived here from Oman, where he discussed
setting up a joint military council and increasing arms sales to
strengthen the Omani armed forces. He also signed an
agreement this week for a joint military council with Saudi
Arabia, and reached an agreement for the sale of six AWACS
surveillance aircraft to the Saudis.
Stock market rebounds from lows
The stock market rallied yesterday, rebounding from its
lowest levels so far in 1982.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen
more than 20 points Monday and Tuesday to its lowest clos
ing level since last Sept. 25, recovered 6.09 to 836.66.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold gained
$3.70 an ounce.
Today's weather
Mostly fair except for patchy late night and early morning
fog. Partly cloudy through tomorrow with a chance of show
ers tonight and tomorrow. A little warmer. Lows in th 40s,
highs in the 50s to mid 60s. Chance of measureable rain 30
percent tonight.
