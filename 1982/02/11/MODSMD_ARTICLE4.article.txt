# Soviet scholar to visit after all
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
The latest development in a con
troversy pitting Stanford against the
State Department over the visit of a
Soviet scholar has turned in the Uni
versity's favor.
Scientist Nickolay Umnov —
whose visit here was cancelled Jan. 21
by the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) because of the University's re
fusal to comply with State Depart
ment restrictions — will likely visit
Stanford as originally planned.
The State Department has clarified
government restrictions to be placed
on the scientist on his visit here. Uni
versity officials indicated yesterday
that they "can live with" those clari
fications, according to Gerald
Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research.
The NAS had cancelled Umnov's
proposed visit because Stanford re
fused to comply with the guidelines
regarding his access to information
and ongoing research.
Both Lieberman and Bernard Roth,
a professor of mechanical engineer
ing who will be Umnov's host, said
they personally believe Umnov will
come now that Stanford has agreed
to operate under the government

guidelines.
Lieberman and Roth discussed the
clarified restrictions earlier this week
after being notified of them in a Feb.
4 letter from the NAS to Roth.
Roth then sent a reply to the NAS
which said, in part, "I see no problem
in hosting a visit by Dr. Umnov to
Stanford to discuss our research."
"I think we'll get a reply (from Um
nov) soon," Lieberman said. The visit
will probably be in May and last ap
proximately two weeks, according to
Roth.
Umnov is an expert in the develop
ment of specialized robots known as
walking machines.
One of the original restrictions, to
which Stanford objected, would
have prohibited Umnov from obtain
ing access to all research and ac
tivities funded by Defense Depart
ment contracts and grants whether
classified or unclassified.
The NAS clarified that restriction in
the Feb. 4 letter. It said that Umnov
would be allowed access to produc
tion, research and other activities
funded by the Department of De
fense if the research was "intended
to result in openly available docu
ments, or for presentation in lec

tures, seminars, or other academic
forums."
In a written reply to Victor
Rabinowitch, executive director of
the NAS, Roth said, "Since all of my
research and, indeed, all of the re
search at Stanford University is un
classified and is 'intended to result in
openly available documents, or for
presentation in lectures, seminars, or
other academic forums,' the State
Department's restrictions on Um
nov's activites ... do not appear to
preclude access to any of our re
search programs."
The clarified restrictions, like the
original ones, prohibit Umnov from
access to industry.
"It is not my intention to send Dr.
Umnov on visits to industry," Roth
stated. He added that he assumed
that neither he nor the University
would be expected to assume re
sponsibility for monitoring his ac
tivites.
"I look forward to an open, stimu
lating and mutually beneficial scien
tific exchange with Dr. Umnov,"
Roth stated.
Lieberman said the letter from the
NAS was such that it didn't put any

restrictions on the visit "that we can
not live with."
"Under the interpretation given to
us by the State Department,"
Lieberman said, "we can treat Um
nov as (we do) any other foreign vis
itor."
A State Department spokesman
told the University News Service "it
appears we'll be able to work things
out."
Arrangements for Umnov's visit
are the responsibility of the NAS. It is
expected that Lieberman will also vis
it the University of Wisconsin, Ohio
State University and Auburn Univer
sity. The University of Washington
had earlier joined Stanford in pro
testing the State Department restric
tions.
The University has expressed con
cern recently over federal attempts
to restrict academic teaching and re
search. University President Donald
Kennedy has agreed to serve as co
chairman of a new joint committee
established by the Association of
American Universities and the De
fense Department to discuss con
cerns arising from attempts to apply
export regulations to academic ac
tivities.

preclude access to any of our re
search programs."
The clarified restrictions, like the
original ones, prohibit Umnov from
access to industry.
"It is not my intention to send Dr.
Umnov on visits to industry," Roth
stated. He added that he assumed
that neither he nor the University
would be expected to assume re
sponsibility for monitoring his ac
tivites.
"I look forward to an open, stimu
lating and mutually beneficial scien
tific exchange with Dr. Umnov,"
Roth stated.
Lieberman said the letter from the
NAS was such that it didn't put any

restrictions on the visit "that we can
not live with."
"Under the interpretation given to
us by the State Department,"
Lieberman said, "we can treat Um
nov as (we do) any other foreign vis
itor."
A State Department spokesman
told the University News Service "it
appears we'll be able to work things
out."
Arrangements for Umnov's visit
are the responsibility of the NAS. It is
expected that Lieberman will also vis
it the University of Wisconsin, Ohio
State University and Auburn Univer
sity. The University of Washington
had earlier joined Stanford in pro
testing the State Department restric
tions.
The University has expressed con
cern recently over federal attempts
to restrict academic teaching and re
search. University President Donald
Kennedy has agreed to serve as co
chairman of a new joint committee
established by the Association of
American Universities and the De
fense Department to discuss con
cerns arising from attempts to apply
export regulations to academic ac
tivities.
The latest development in a con
troversy pitting Stanford against the
State Department over the visit of a
Soviet scholar has turned in the Uni
versity's favor.
Scientist Nickolay Umnov —
whose visit here was cancelled Jan. 21
by the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) because of the University's re
fusal to comply with State Depart
ment restrictions — will likely visit
Stanford as originally planned.
The State Department has clarified
government restrictions to be placed
on the scientist on his visit here. Uni
versity officials indicated yesterday
that they "can live with" those clari
fications, according to Gerald
Lieberman, vice provost and dean of
graduate studies and research.
The NAS had cancelled Umnov's
proposed visit because Stanford re
fused to comply with the guidelines
regarding his access to information
and ongoing research.
Both Lieberman and Bernard Roth,
a professor of mechanical engineer
ing who will be Umnov's host, said
they personally believe Umnov will
come now that Stanford has agreed
to operate under the government

guidelines.
Lieberman and Roth discussed the
clarified restrictions earlier this week
after being notified of them in a Feb.
4 letter from the NAS to Roth.
Roth then sent a reply to the NAS
which said, in part, "I see no problem
in hosting a visit by Dr. Umnov to
Stanford to discuss our research."
"I think we'll get a reply (from Um
nov) soon," Lieberman said. The visit
will probably be in May and last ap
proximately two weeks, according to
Roth.
Umnov is an expert in the develop
ment of specialized robots known as
walking machines.
One of the original restrictions, to
which Stanford objected, would
have prohibited Umnov from obtain
ing access to all research and ac
tivities funded by Defense Depart
ment contracts and grants whether
classified or unclassified.
The NAS clarified that restriction in
the Feb. 4 letter. It said that Umnov
would be allowed access to produc
tion, research and other activities
funded by the Department of De
fense if the research was "intended
to result in openly available docu
ments, or for presentation in lec

tures, seminars, or other academic
forums."
In a written reply to Victor
Rabinowitch, executive director of
the NAS, Roth said, "Since all of my
research and, indeed, all of the re
search at Stanford University is un
classified and is 'intended to result in
openly available documents, or for
presentation in lectures, seminars, or
other academic forums,' the State
Department's restrictions on Um
nov's activites ... do not appear to
preclude access to any of our re
search programs."
The clarified restrictions, like the
original ones, prohibit Umnov from
access to industry.
"It is not my intention to send Dr.
Umnov on visits to industry," Roth
stated. He added that he assumed
that neither he nor the University
would be expected to assume re
sponsibility for monitoring his ac
tivites.
"I look forward to an open, stimu
lating and mutually beneficial scien
