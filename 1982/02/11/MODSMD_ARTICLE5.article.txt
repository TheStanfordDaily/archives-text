# ASSU debates fee assessment format

### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Recognizing that refundable fee
assessments have failed to effectively
allocate student funds, the ASSU
Senate met last night to discuss vari
ous ways of implementing non-re
fundable fee assessments.
Although senators disagreed on
whether individual selection, gener
al election, or senate distribution
were the best methods of distribut
ing the compulsory assessment
funds, they generally agreed that re
fundable fee assessments do not
work.
"I can't see a refundable system in
which we won't run into the same/
problems that we have now," said
Mark Epstein, chairman of the ASSU
Senate Finance Committee. Epstein

said the present system discouraged
students from voting, punished stu
dent organizations for long-range
planning and necessitated the long
lines for refunds. "Something has to
change," Epstein said.
The special meeting last night was
called to give direction to a special
legislative committee that will draft a
constitutional amendment on fee
assessment reform. If the senate
adopts the committee's final draft of
the amendment in March, it will be
placed on the spring ballot for ap
proval by the student body.
The senators discussed different al
location methods, including a
"check-off" proposal in which each
student would allocate his com
pulsory assessment of approximately
$10 to the student organizations of

his choice. Under this system, each
student would be given a list of
groups eligible to receive fee
assessment funds. A certain amount
of money would be assigned to each
group to which the student indicated
the funds should go. If the student
did not designate which groups he
wished to fund, the assessment mon
ey would go into a general fund to be
distributed at the discretion of the
senate.
Some senators suggested that stu
dents be allowed to allocate all of
their money to one group if they so
desired. However, other senators
complained that under that system
that some large groups on campus
would receive more funds than they
needed while smaller groups would
be neglected.

When some senators countered
that the senate could examine the
budgets of groups and refuse to al
locate more funds than they needed,
Senator Jim Grundberg said big
groups could tamper with their
budgets to accomodate a "landslide"
of extra funds. He facetiously sug
gested that the Daily could establish
"foreign correspondents" to justify
an increase in funds.
Senator Rod Beckstrom said that
such claims were "absurd" and
pointed out that it was unlikely that
any group would have much more
money than it needed. He said that
students should have the right to give
varying amounts to different student
organizations.
"I don't think it's fair to put limits
on the students' right to vote how to
allocate their money," ho said.
Senator Roc Blumemthal pointed
out that having the excess funds dis
tributed by the senate would have
"political implications" that would
lessen the individual student's role in
the allocation process. Other sena
tors suggested that students who do
not designate which groups they
wish their funds to go to may end up
supporting groups they oppose.
But Senator Rick Naimark pointed
out that students would only be in
such a situation if they made the
choice not to assign their money.
The special legislative committee
for fee assessment reforms will con
sider not only the check-off system
discussed at last night's meeting but
also systems determining distribu
tion by general election or by senate
allocation.
