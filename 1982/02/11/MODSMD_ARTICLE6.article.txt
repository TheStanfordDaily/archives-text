### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
Letters from the Stanford com
munity on behalf of University stu
dent Robert Simon will not have any
bearing on the prosecution's view of
the case, according to Palo Alto Dis
trict Attorney Randy Hey.
Simon is charged with two counts
of vehicular manslaughter and one
count of felony drunk driving. The
charges stem from an automobile ac
cident on campus last October in
which two fraternity members, Kevin
MacMillan and Michael Becker,
were killed.
The district attorney's office is
seeking full prosecution on all
counts, Hey said. If convicted on all
charges, Simon could face up to
three years in state prison, he added.
Hey said he has received "a lot" of
letters in the last few weeks from
members of the Stanford community
expressing their feelings about the
case. Hey could give no precise fig
ure as to the number of letters hisof

fire has received, but estimated that
the number is probably fewer than
100.
"The letters are interesting and I
have read them all. Any input from
the community we (the district at
torney's office) treat with respect,"
he said.
Simon's defense attorney, William
Keogh, said he is unsure of the let
ters' effect on the case, but said, "I
think the sentiments of the com
munity are somewhat relevent. . . Ev
eryone is interested in helping Rob
ert."
A preliminary hearing for the case
is set for Feb. 26 to establish facts and
determine if a trial is warranted.
Members of the Theta Delta Chi
fraternity visited residences last
month urging concerned friends to
write the district attorney's office on
behalf of Siinon, a fraternity brother.
"We (the fraternity) want to show
support for Robert the best way we
can," said Theta Delt Tom Turpin.
"We wanted to reach everyone who

knows Robert and feels as strongly as
we do."
Having the fraternity's members
visit student living groups and ex
plain the case's current situation was
the most effective way to reach ev
eryone who knows Simon, Turpin
said.
"Our basic concern was that peo
ple understand what we're trying to
do. We were not trying to solicit let
ters in general, but we wanted to
reach the people who know Robert,"
Turpin said.
Richie Pops, president of Theta
Delta Chi, said the letters should not
be interpreted as a public relations
maneuver for Simon's case.
"It is a show of support," Pops said.
Fraternity representatives dis
tributed stamped envelopes along
with a leaflet which included sugges
tions for the letter. Turpin, who
wrote the leaflet, said the suggestions
were only to help those people who
wanted to write letters but did not
know what to say.

"People who want to write may be
so busy that they do not have four
hours or so to hash out what to say.
We are not trying to put words in
anyone's mouth," he said.
The leaflet began, "For those who
are at a loss for words, the following
points might be helpful to mention:
Robert Simon's positive qualities and
citizenship; the terrible tragedy of
the automobile accident that in
volved three friends and fraternity
brothers; the sentiments at the me
morial services; and the need to ex
ercise the greatest possible lenien
cy."
Turpin said the fraternity checked
with Keogh on the legal aspects in
volved in the letter writing, but had
received no specific advice from him
as to specific measures to support Si
mon. He said the fraternity also
checked with several University of
ficials and Simon himself before visit
ing the dormitories and houses.
Simon said he is unable to com
ment on the case.
