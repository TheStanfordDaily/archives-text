## Polish learn to live in new regime 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland — Even un
der martial law, life goes on
here, and a good place to
watch its progress is in the clas
sified advertisements in the
Warsaw newspapers.
Poland's military rulers have
crushed the press freedom that
took root with the growth of
the now-banned Solidarity in
dependent trade union. And
the news and commentary in
the press now reflect the ideol
ogical orthodoxy of the
martial-law regime.
But lonely men and women
continue to fill the personal
columns with ads in search of
companionship, and Poland's
few but important private busi
nessmen continue to offer
goods and services for sale.
As before, Polish citizens are
eager to offer cash or to barter
goods for things they cannot
find in the depleted shops.
Despite a crackdown on
black-market money trans
actions, such deals still find
their way into the classified ads,
using codes that everyone un
derstands — including pre
sumably the military author
ities.

Take the following want ad
for an apartment that appeared
in the newspaper Zycie War
szawy:
"After returning from
abroad, want to buy three
room apartment in central
Warsaw with telephone."
(Poles may buy apartments
from either the state or private
owners.)
The phrase "returning from
abroad" tips off prospective
sellers that the apartment
seeker has hard Western cur
rency and is willing to part with
some of it, even though all for
eign money transactions are il
legal here.
Renters use a variation of this
code, stating in their ads that
they "will rent to foreigners."
What they are really saying is
that they will rent to anyone,
including Poles, as long as the
rent is paid in hard currency.
With dollars and other
Western currencies, Poles can
buy things they cannot buy
with zlotys, in shops open only
to people with acceptable cur
rencies. And Western curren
cies can be exchanged for
zlotys at well above the official
rate. The current black market

rate is four or five times the of
ficial rate of 80 zlotys to the
dollar.
The ads also reflect the con
tinued shortages that plague
Poland.
Many ads seek to buy build
ing materials, which have been
in short supply, to build houses
or renovate apartments. Offers
of both cash and goods in
payment are often included.
One ad declared, "Will buy
lumber, tar paper, doors, water
pipes. Payment can include
Singer sewing machine..."
Poland's consumer short
ages are also reflected in the
personal columns, which show
that love flourishes even
among the economic ruins. A
recent example:
"Divorced man, age 37, with
own apartment . . . said to be
handsome, well off, pays
alimony for three children,
wants to meet lady up to age 34
as a faithful life companion."
Those who cannot find the
person they are looking for in
the personal ads can turn tothe
matrimonial agencies, part of
Poland's private sector.
"You lonely?" one such ad

asks. "The matrimonial bureau
Rodzina (The Family) offers
discreet aid in founding your
family ..."
Official tolerance of thinly
masked illegal activities in the
classified ads is also evident
elsewhere.
For example, a district police
station in Warsaw is housed in
the same building as a Melin?,
a shop that sells vodka illegally,
at several times the state price.
The police aie well aware of
their illegal neighbor but con
sider it convenient to have
such a ready supply of vodka, it
is said.
Poland's shortages have also
affected the crackdown on
anti-government activities.
A district police station re
cently received a call from
headquarters to send a squad
car to a nearby factory to paint
over a wall slogan protesting
martial law.
"We will be glad to send the
car," an officer at the district
station reportedly said. "But
we cannot do anything about
the slogan. We do not have any
paint."
