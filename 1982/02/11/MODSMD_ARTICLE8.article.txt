# New policies threaten French industry
## 
### Washington Post 
Chalon-Sur-Saone, France — A special
10 percent income surtax hit hard last Oc
tober. Increased social security and un
employment taxes added about 5 percent
to the company payroll. A fifth week of
paid vacation added another 4.5 percent,
and he still is unsure how to organize a
government-decreed 39-hour workweek.
Add to that a 30 percent expense ac
count tax in a Burgundy town famous for
fine eating and increases in personal in
come taxes that will push up this year's bill
by one-fourth and you will understand
why Jean-Claude Neyrat thinks the Social
ist government is bad for his family's um
brella and parasol business.
"We have the impression that the peo
ple in parliament or in the government
have never set foot in a business," Neyrat
told a vistor to his modern factory here.
"They have a lot of ideas, but they don't
have their feet on the ground."

Neyrat, 39, a Gaullist, was talking about
his own problems as the fourth generation
of Neyrats to run the $10.9-million-a-year
Neyrat Peyronie Co. in this region of cele
brated wines and peasant heritage. But his
complaints echoed those heard around
France in the last eight months from busi
nessmen upset at President Francois Mit
terrand's program to"change life" by a So
cialist economic program.
The program's long-term centerpiece,
nationalization of eight major industries
and 39 private banks, was stalled last
month by a constitutional court. Since
then, the law has been rewritten and
passed again by the Socialist-dominated
parliament, so the companies are still
scheduled to come under government
ownership in the coming weeks.
It is only after their management actually
changes hands that the first overall effects
of the Socialist government's economic
policies will be widely felt in France, prob

ably by the time Mitterrand is celebrating
the first anniversary of his election May 10.
Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy has
pledged that the nationalized estab
lishments will be encouraged to continue
operating according toa market economy,
free of government interference. But
Neyrat and many of his business col
leagues fear the result will be new criteria
for business decisions — employment
rather than profit, for example — and that
the French economy will come out a loser.
Mauroy has trouped tirelessly across
France promoting these policies, accusing
businessmen of dragging their feet on in
vestment for political reasons despite
France's debilitating 8.5 percent un
employment rate. From Neyrat's vantage
point, however, things look different.
"The speeches are all right," he said,
"but you can't produce anything with
them."
