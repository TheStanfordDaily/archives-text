# Pentagon war contingency program rejected by hospital board of trustees

The University Hospital's board of directors de
cided Wednesday against participating in a con
troversial Pentagon plan that would make 50,000
civilian hospital beds available in the event ofa lim
ited nuclear or conventional war.
According to the plan, called the Civilian-Mili
tary Contingency Hospital System (CMCHS), a
minimum of 50 beds must be set aside by each par
ticipating hospital.
The board declined to contract fora specified
number of beds, stating that the University would
attempt to provide whatever beds it could without
violating its commitment to local and broader
communities.
Nationally, the contingency plan has been
backed by the American Medical Association, and
several hospital administrators here contend a lack
of such agreement could trigger a military
takeover of the hospital during a crisis.A Pentagon
spokesman contacted by phone yesterday did not
deny the possibility of a military takeover of civil
ian hospitals.
"Anything is possible during a war. But it is up to
the president of the United States. He certainly has
the option to take that action during wartime,"
said Philip Armstrong, assistant to the principal
deputy assistant secretary of defense for health af
fairs.
"But that is not what we are aiming at. We're
aiming at getting a program organized ahead of

time," he said.
So far, 366 civilian hospitals across the country
have committed a total of 30,932 beds under the
contingency plan, Armstrong said. The country's
military hospitals contain 18,000 beds â€” a grossly
inadequate number, according to Defense De
partment estimates of casualties from a future con
flict.
Casualty projections are based on computer
analyses of various scenarios, Armstrong ex
plained. "Scenarios have been formulated for vir
tually every potential area of conflict. They take
into consideration population at risk, environmen
tal factors, historical factors and the capability of
modern weaponry."
Opponents of the contingency plan, including
Physicians for Social Responsibility, have said that
planning for the results of a nuclear exchange
creates the unrealistic expectation that a viable re
sponse is possible.
Armstrong contended, however, that the com
puter scenarios were based only on conflicts in
volving conventional weapons systems. "It is a
popular misconception that we are planning fora
nuclear war," he said.
Another point of contention involvesan alleged
request for personnel information from each hos
pital. The board's primary objection to partici
pation in the contingency plan was a Defense De
partment requirement that the hospital furnish the
Pentagon with the names and military background

of all its employees, according to Medical Center
spokesman Spyros Andreopoulos.
"The personnel questionnaire was for the hospi
tals' internal useonly," Armstrongsaid. "It was giv
en to administrator to help them get a good idea
of their ability to handle extra casualties."
Armstrong said the Defense Department had not
requested that the personnel surveys be returned
to Washington.
"I'm not saying they are lying, but all the evi
dence we have is that the personnel information
was required and an integral part of the plan," said
hospital spokesman Mike Goodkind.
A letter from University of California Vice Presi
dent William Fretter to the Defense Department,
dated Dec. 10, also indicates that personnel in
formation was requested. "Since we do not main
tain the personnel information you indicated, and
in view of California privacy laws, we also would
not be able to meet your personnel data request,"
the letter stated.
All the University of California medical centers,
including those at San Francisco, Davis, San Diego,
Los Angeles and Irvine, refused to participate in
the contingency plan.
The board of directors here has left open the
possibility of further discussion with the Defense
Department on the issue and has directed hospital
officials to consult with other teaching hospitals
about the Pentagon's proposal.
