## Viewpoint/Jeff Phillips Reagan's policy lacks energy 
### 
There is very little challenge in criticizing things about
President Ronald Reagan that exist, so I will try io
criticize something that doesn't exist — his energy poli
cy. The president apparently has the same attitude
toward our energy problems that I have toward my
homework problems: if you don't worry about them,
they'll go away. If this approach is as successful for Rea
gan as it has been for me, we're all in trouble.
The conservative approach to the energy crisis was
best stated last year by a Texas politician when he said,
"the best thing government can do to help the energy
problem is to get out of it." Yes, you see, if you let the
invisible hand of laissez-faire economics take over (with
the exception of a little help for the nuclear industry)
supply will rise to meet demand with the most plentiful
and efficient energy sources supplying the bulk of our
needs.
This policy will not solve our energy woes; for I can
find at least four fundamental problems with it.
First, the market for energy even with deregulation is
not a free market. Both electricity and natural gas are
sold to the consumer through regulated monopolies
which are now allowed to charge what it will take to re
place that energy. This means about 50 percent of our
energy is priced below what it probably would be in a
totally free market.
More important, over the years the conventional
power sources such as oil and gas, coal, nuclear and
hydro have benefitted from huge government subsidies
in the form of tax credits to producers, research and de
velopment, and financing help. The new guys in the field
— solar, wind, fuel cells, conservation, you name it —
have had comparatively little federal support and hence
are not in most cases competitive with the conventional
sources.
Very few companies are willing to do the research and
development work that is necessary to make these new
sources viable because the pay-offs are too long-term to
meet the demands of today's financial market. The fed
eral government should, as it has before, shoulder some
of the risks involved in developing new energy technol
ogies.
The second problem I find with the Reagan approach
: s it is not fair to change the rules in the middle of the
game. For years, due to government policy, Americans
have enjoyed artifically low energy prices. Now Reagan
says no more free ride. I say the government should at
least help consumers adjust to these new rules by im
plementing services and research which show people
how to adapt to higher energy prices without losing their
shirts. We should increase support for public transporta
tion and provide energy audits for homes and businesses

to show where energy can be saved.
For example, my father does not have the time or the
expertise to decide if a solar water heater would pay off,
and he's not about to trust a contractor's biased advice.
But the Department of Energy (DOE) could provide such
information to him and everyone else in a cost-effective
manner. Unfortunately, the conservation and informa
tion areas of the DOE budget have been cut 90 percent.
Another legitimate government function bites the dust.
The third fundamental problem is that true marginal
costs to society are not reflected even in deregulated
energy prices. What this means is even if a frugal few do
not increase their energy use, their prices may go up be
cause of the wasteful bastards who cause the need fora
new power plant or offshore oil well. This also works in
reverse; so if the frugal few manage to reduce consump
tion, even the undeserving wasters benefit from the low
er prices. In other words, the old adage that you can use
whatever you want because you are paying for it is not
entirely true. We all benefit from conservation; we all
pay for increased consumption.
The discrepancy between individual costs and costs to
society cries out for governmental reconciliation. There
are many ways this could be done. Perhaps the problem
could be solved by levying tax credits for energy-effi
cient products and surcharges on wasteful onesor by im
plementing tougher building code standards or selective
brown-outs of electricity during peak periods. Of
course, we must be careful that the cost of regulation
does not exceed the benefits of energy saved.
The final problem with Reagan energy policy is it
makes no distinction between domestic and foreign
energy sources. Reagan's statements in this area seem to
suggest that if something goes wrong with our supplies
in the Persian Gulf, he will just send the Rapid Deploy
ment Force to the rescue. Unfortunately, when the
smoke clears there may not be a working oil well in the
entire region. Even nuclear physicist Edward Teller
knows that we can't win a war in the Persian Gulf.
In the interest of saving blood and oil at the same time,
I suggest America discriminate against foreign oil by add
ing a substantial tariff to its cost both to decrease use and
to provide funds to support research in domestic energy
resources. Currently, this nation pays more in three days
for imported oil than the government invests in DOE's
conservation and renewable energy efforts in a year. If
all of us do not start worrying about this short-sighted
state of affairs, our energy problems will surely not go
away.

how to adapt to higher energy prices without losing their
shirts. We should increase support for public transporta
tion and provide energy audits for homes and businesses

to show where energy can be saved.
For example, my father does not have the time or the
expertise to decide if a solar water heater would pay off,
and he's not about to trust a contractor's biased advice.
But the Department of Energy (DOE) could provide such
information to him and everyone else in a cost-effective
manner. Unfortunately, the conservation and informa
tion areas of the DOE budget have been cut 90 percent.
Another legitimate government function bites the dust.
The third fundamental problem is that true marginal
costs to society are not reflected even in deregulated
energy prices. What this means is even if a frugal few do
not increase their energy use, their prices may go up be
cause of the wasteful bastards who cause the need fora
new power plant or offshore oil well. This also works in
reverse; so if the frugal few manage to reduce consump
tion, even the undeserving wasters benefit from the low
er prices. In other words, the old adage that you can use
whatever you want because you are paying for it is not
entirely true. We all benefit from conservation; we all
pay for increased consumption.
The discrepancy between individual costs and costs to
society cries out for governmental reconciliation. There
are many ways this could be done. Perhaps the problem
could be solved by levying tax credits for energy-effi
cient products and surcharges on wasteful onesor by im
plementing tougher building code standards or selective
brown-outs of electricity during peak periods. Of
course, we must be careful that the cost of regulation
does not exceed the benefits of energy saved.
The final problem with Reagan energy policy is it
makes no distinction between domestic and foreign
energy sources. Reagan's statements in this area seem to
suggest that if something goes wrong with our supplies
in the Persian Gulf, he will just send the Rapid Deploy
ment Force to the rescue. Unfortunately, when the
smoke clears there may not be a working oil well in the
entire region. Even nuclear physicist Edward Teller
knows that we can't win a war in the Persian Gulf.
In the interest of saving blood and oil at the same time,
I suggest America discriminate against foreign oil by add
ing a substantial tariff to its cost both to decrease use and
to provide funds to support research in domestic energy
resources. Currently, this nation pays more in three days
for imported oil than the government invests in DOE's
conservation and renewable energy efforts in a year. If
all of us do not start worrying about this short-sighted
state of affairs, our energy problems will surely not go
away.

There is very little challenge in criticizing things about
President Ronald Reagan that exist, so I will try io
criticize something that doesn't exist — his energy poli
cy. The president apparently has the same attitude
toward our energy problems that I have toward my
homework problems: if you don't worry about them,
they'll go away. If this approach is as successful for Rea
gan as it has been for me, we're all in trouble.
The conservative approach to the energy crisis was
best stated last year by a Texas politician when he said,
"the best thing government can do to help the energy
problem is to get out of it." Yes, you see, if you let the
invisible hand of laissez-faire economics take over (with
the exception of a little help for the nuclear industry)
supply will rise to meet demand with the most plentiful
and efficient energy sources supplying the bulk of our
needs.
This policy will not solve our energy woes; for I can
find at least four fundamental problems with it.
First, the market for energy even with deregulation is
not a free market. Both electricity and natural gas are
sold to the consumer through regulated monopolies
which are now allowed to charge what it will take to re
place that energy. This means about 50 percent of our
energy is priced below what it probably would be in a
totally free market.
More important, over the years the conventional
power sources such as oil and gas, coal, nuclear and
hydro have benefitted from huge government subsidies
in the form of tax credits to producers, research and de
velopment, and financing help. The new guys in the field
— solar, wind, fuel cells, conservation, you name it —
have had comparatively little federal support and hence
are not in most cases competitive with the conventional
sources.
Very few companies are willing to do the research and
development work that is necessary to make these new
sources viable because the pay-offs are too long-term to
meet the demands of today's financial market. The fed
eral government should, as it has before, shoulder some
of the risks involved in developing new energy technol
ogies.
The second problem I find with the Reagan approach
: s it is not fair to change the rules in the middle of the
game. For years, due to government policy, Americans
have enjoyed artifically low energy prices. Now Reagan
says no more free ride. I say the government should at
least help consumers adjust to these new rules by im
plementing services and research which show people
how to adapt to higher energy prices without losing their
shirts. We should increase support for public transporta
tion and provide energy audits for homes and businesses

to show where energy can be saved.
