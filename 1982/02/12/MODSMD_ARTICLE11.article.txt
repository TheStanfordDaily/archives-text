## GP board choices reflect the community input

As members of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board, we are writing
to clear up any misunderstanding
surrounding Jeff Bradach and Joe
Rodota's letter of Feb. 8, "Guest Pro
fessorship Board makes unsatisfac
tory choice." Their letter is both un
justified and misinformed; it shows
little awareness of the sentiments of
the student body and of the inten
tions of the Guest Professorship
Board.
Stating that we have "ignored the
needs of the community," Bradach
and Rodota are clearly attempting to
force upon the University communi
ty their own "dictates of common
sense." By definition, the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board is an open
board, in which anyone (even Brad
ach and Rodota, if they had had a
genuine interest in the selection of
Guest Professors) can participate; the
people we write and ultimately bring
mirror the response and feedback we
get from the community. We attempt
to contact people from a variety of
occupations, interests and political
viewpoints; our goal is to add a
broader dimension to the standard
educational format of the University,
to supplement and complement the
existing curriculum.
To say that the Stanford communi
ty could be better served by bringing
an individual other than Catharine
MacKinnon, because we have al
ready "had the opportunity" to hear
her, makes little or no sense;
MacKinnon taught ( lasses at the Law
School, and has had no academic in
teraction with any undergraduates or
even graduates from other depart
ments or schools.
Bill Griffith, to use the words of
Bradach and Rodota, is an individual

with a "viewpoint which we would
otherwise not have the opportunity
to hear." A nationally-known under
ground cartoonist, Griffity will offera
lighter touch to winter term. As to his
"absurd" salary, public figures speak
ing at Stanford regularly command
upwards of $2500 fora single speech,
which usually last less than two
hours. During his two day stay here,
Griffith, for $1000, will have extensive
interaction with the Stanford Com
munity through lectures, workshops
and sherry hours.
We of the Guest Professorship
Board stand by our choices for this
year, while stressing the fact that we
are an open board in which anyone
can participate. The professors we
bring to campus are brought by indi
viduals with enough energy and in
terest to get involved with our pro
gram.

Beene's solution beans
What a lovely commentary on our
society Marty Beene makes in his let
ter {Daily, Feb. 9). Women have a
clear-cut choice, he states: Never be
alone or get raped. And I thought
slavery was on the way out.
Beene's solution is simple because
it doesn't address any of the prob
lems involved. Sure, attacks would be
reduced if women were never alone.
So would muggings and beatings
against men. But where in the world
do men like Beene get off suggesting
to women to just completely give up
any thought of being free or safe in
order to avoid attacks. Men
shouldn't be telling women how to

run their lives; men should be
teaching other men how to respect
every individual's right to freedom.
Women being alone is not the prob
lem. It's men not being able to deal
with women's rights to be free,
coupled with a power-trip mentality
steeped in violence.
Beene's assertion that women's
freedom is being inhibited by one
"bad guy," misses the issues com
pletely. When this attacker(s) is
caught, there will, unfortunately, be
others like him. We, as a community,
as individuals (especially those of use
who arc male), must work against this
attitude of Beene's letter that women
need to just accept as facts that they
will become victimsiftheydon't limit
their lives. Rape is not a "women's
problem"; it is blatant attack on each
of us. For when any of us is violated,
we all lose moreofourown freedom.
Violent attacks of any nature are not
the victim's problem. They are an
outrage to all people with any sense
of self-worth.
If BeeneV'simple solution"comes
out of his anger at the recent attacks,
then I can understand his desire for
some immediate response. I, too, am
outraged! And an extra measure of
caution is sometimes necessary. But
women are not "asking for it" or re
sponsible for attacks at any time.
They are not naive; they are humans,
with every right to a free life. Men are
the naive ones if they think women
are anything less.

I find Ronald Garwood's reaction
to the group Whipping Boy (Daily,
Feb. 8) confusing to say the least. I am
especially surprised at his apparent

unwillingness to take what he defines
as a "risk" on a punk band. It seems
that Garwood expects hordes of
crazed, spike-haired and bechained
maniacs to come out of the wood
work and smash Tresidder's plate
glass windows with rocks.
Such fears are quite unfounded, as
I have discovered by seeing Whip
ping Boy in their last two Stanford en
gagements. The music is frenetic and
the crowd energetic, but not by any
means what one would term a hard
core punk audience. I observed a
rather broad cross-section of Stan
ford students, many of whom I am
sure are quite similar to Garwood
if not in open-mindedness then at
least in countenance.
STARTS is failing to accomplish
what their name explicitly implies â€”
exposing Stanford students to a varie
ty of artistic expression. To deny such
exposure merely because the group
may be controversial is an anti-artis
tic act of the most deplorable kind.

As members of the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board, we are writing
to clear up any misunderstanding
surrounding Jeff Bradach and Joe
Rodota's letter of Feb. 8, "Guest Pro
fessorship Board makes unsatisfac
tory choice." Their letter is both un
justified and misinformed; it shows
little awareness of the sentiments of
the student body and of the inten
tions of the Guest Professorship
Board.
Stating that we have "ignored the
needs of the community," Bradach
and Rodota are clearly attempting to
force upon the University communi
ty their own "dictates of common
sense." By definition, the ASSU
Guest Professorship Board is an open
board, in which anyone (even Brad
ach and Rodota, if they had had a
genuine interest in the selection of
Guest Professors) can participate; the
people we write and ultimately bring
mirror the response and feedback we
get from the community. We attempt
to contact people from a variety of
occupations, interests and political
viewpoints; our goal is to add a
broader dimension to the standard
educational format of the University,
to supplement and complement the
existing curriculum.
To say that the Stanford communi
ty could be better served by bringing
an individual other than Catharine
MacKinnon, because we have al
ready "had the opportunity" to hear
her, makes little or no sense;
MacKinnon taught ( lasses at the Law
School, and has had no academic in
teraction with any undergraduates or
even graduates from other depart
ments or schools.
Bill Griffith, to use the words of
Bradach and Rodota, is an individual

with a "viewpoint which we would
otherwise not have the opportunity
to hear." A nationally-known under
ground cartoonist, Griffity will offera
lighter touch to winter term. As to his
"absurd" salary, public figures speak
ing at Stanford regularly command
upwards of $2500 fora single speech,
which usually last less than two
hours. During his two day stay here,
Griffith, for $1000, will have extensive
interaction with the Stanford Com
munity through lectures, workshops
and sherry hours.
We of the Guest Professorship
Board stand by our choices for this
year, while stressing the fact that we
are an open board in which anyone
can participate. The professors we
bring to campus are brought by indi
viduals with enough energy and in
terest to get involved with our pro
gram.

Beene's solution beans
What a lovely commentary on our
society Marty Beene makes in his let
ter {Daily, Feb. 9). Women have a
clear-cut choice, he states: Never be
alone or get raped. And I thought
slavery was on the way out.
Beene's solution is simple because
it doesn't address any of the prob
lems involved. Sure, attacks would be
reduced if women were never alone.
So would muggings and beatings
against men. But where in the world
do men like Beene get off suggesting
to women to just completely give up
any thought of being free or safe in
order to avoid attacks. Men
shouldn't be telling women how to

run their lives; men should be
teaching other men how to respect
every individual's right to freedom.
Women being alone is not the prob
lem. It's men not being able to deal
with women's rights to be free,
coupled with a power-trip mentality
steeped in violence.
Beene's assertion that women's
freedom is being inhibited by one
"bad guy," misses the issues com
pletely. When this attacker(s) is
caught, there will, unfortunately, be
others like him. We, as a community,
as individuals (especially those of use
who arc male), must work against this
attitude of Beene's letter that women
need to just accept as facts that they
will become victimsiftheydon't limit
their lives. Rape is not a "women's
problem"; it is blatant attack on each
of us. For when any of us is violated,
we all lose moreofourown freedom.
Violent attacks of any nature are not
the victim's problem. They are an
outrage to all people with any sense
of self-worth.
If BeeneV'simple solution"comes
out of his anger at the recent attacks,
then I can understand his desire for
some immediate response. I, too, am
outraged! And an extra measure of
caution is sometimes necessary. But
women are not "asking for it" or re
sponsible for attacks at any time.
They are not naive; they are humans,
with every right to a free life. Men are
the naive ones if they think women
are anything less.

I find Ronald Garwood's reaction
to the group Whipping Boy (Daily,
Feb. 8) confusing to say the least. I am
especially surprised at his apparent

unwillingness to take what he defines
as a "risk" on a punk band. It seems
that Garwood expects hordes of
crazed, spike-haired and bechained
maniacs to come out of the wood
work and smash Tresidder's plate
glass windows with rocks.
Such fears are quite unfounded, as
I have discovered by seeing Whip
ping Boy in their last two Stanford en
gagements. The music is frenetic and
the crowd energetic, but not by any
means what one would term a hard
core punk audience. I observed a
rather broad cross-section of Stan
ford students, many of whom I am
sure are quite similar to Garwood
if not in open-mindedness then at
least in countenance.
STARTS is failing to accomplish
what their name explicitly implies â€”
exposing Stanford students to a varie
ty of artistic expression. To deny such
exposure merely because the group
may be controversial is an anti-artis
tic act of the most deplorable kind.
