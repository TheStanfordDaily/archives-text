## Administration seeks shelter 
### 
"Everybody's going to make it if
there are enough shovels to go
around . . . Dig a hole, cover it up
with a couple of doors, and then
throw three feet of dirt on top. It's
the dirt that does it." — T.K. Jones,
Deputy Undersecretary of Defense
for Strategic and Nuclear Forces
The current administration really
wants civil defense. In fact, while
President Ronald Reagan continues
to cut severely funding for educa
tion, solar energy, conservation etc.,
he has proposed a 90 percent in
crease in government spending for
civil defense. The goal of this pro
gram, he says, is to attain a "nuclear
war-fighting capability." But exactly
what does he consider to be a
"capability" to fight a nuclear war?
The administration's reasoning is
revealed by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), which
is in charge of the U.S. civil defense
program. This agency has declared
that "the U.S. could survive a nuclear
attack and go on to recovery within a
relatively few years." The first thing
that came to my mind after reading
this quote was another quote, this
one by Dr. Howard Hiatt, dean of the
Harvard School of Public Health:
"Any nuclear war would inevitably
cause death, disease and suffering of
epidemic proportions, and effective
medical intervention on any realistic
scale would be impossible." Con
sidering these altogether incom
patible views, I wondered what the
FEMA's plan was and how they ex
pected it to work.
Basically, their plan has three
phases: "the evacuation of urban
populations, survival training, and
the construction of simple fallout
shelters." First, how feasible is the ef
fective evacuation of a city such as
Los Angeles? The Supervisor of L.A.
County, Kenneth Hahn, exclaimed,

regarding the task of evacuating his
county, that "This is boggling. This is
colossal. You just can't evacuate L.A.
in any reasonable time." Consider
also that the FEMA's whole plan is
based on the assumption that we'll
have seven days notice to evacuate. I
can see it now: "Tass, the Soviet New
Agency, reported today that the So
viet Union will commence a full scale
nuclear war on the U.S. in two
weeks." Of course, this is absurd. In
reality, an attack by the Soviet Union
will be strategically initiated to catch
us off guard, and could strike with
less than 20 minutes warning. The
only thing people will have time for is
panicking and, in those final mo
ments, praying.
The second part of their plan: sur
vival training. This training is neces
sary, says the FEMA, because "radio
active fallout could prevent doctors
and nurses from reaching injured or
sick persons fora considerable peri
od of time." To accomplish this goal
of public training, which they believe
would enable people to help each
other during the aftermath of a nu
clear war, the FEMA urges us to ac
quire these valuable skills by taking
free courses that are offered in many
communities, such as Red Cross first
aid courses. Hiatt points out the use
lessness of such first-aid knowledge
when one is dealing with a severly
burned patient: "No amount of hu
man preparations could provide the
human and physical resources re
quired for the care of even a few such
patients hospitalized simultaneously
in any city of the nation. Yet one must
assume that at least tens of thousands
of such casualties would result in ev
ery metropolitan center hit by a nu
clear weapon." So much for first-aid
courses.
The final aspect of the FEMA's civil
defense program is the construction
of simple fallout shelters. Okay, let's
assume that L.A. is effectively evac
uated to its wilderness fallout
shelters. First of all, what are those
millions of people going to do after
they emerge from their holes in the
ground? Most likely, people will start
dying of starvation. Certainly with in
dustry completely crippled, the ne
cessities of life will be unobtainable.

Moreover, what about the environ- I
mental effects of the blast? Dr. I
Herbert A brains of the Harvard Med- I
ical School claims that "insects, many I
of which have an unexplained im- I
munity to radiation, would thrive on
the unburied corpses,infest surviving
animalsand, eventually, man." Dying I
in the initial blast would be prefer- I
able to surviving to experience the I
living hell which Abrams describes. I
Even if Abrams is mistaken, the ef- I
fects of the blasts on the atmosphere I
would doom any of the poor folks I
still around.
I would thus conclude that this I
plan has a few holes in it, to say the M
least. Yet, the FEMA, completely sup-M
ported by Reagan, is completely ob-H
livious to the fact that civil defense isl
unrealistic. Instead, they continue toH
make inane comparisonstohistoricalH
instances in which a civilization sur-fl
vived a great tragedy. You see, in Wil'H
liam Chipman's (Chief of the CiviHj
Defense Division in the FEMA)
the detonatin of a nuclear warhead is «
"an enormous, gigantic explosion. 1
But it's still an explosion, .. . just as if 1
a shell went off down the road." As if
this conception weren't ridiculous^
enough, Chipman parallels a full
scale nuclear war to the bubonic
plague that struck Europe in the 14th
century: "it was horrifying at the i
time, and yet, six or eight years later,,
not only had English society re-'
bounded but, by God, these people
went out on an expeditionary force
to France!" I shiver at the thought
that men such as Chipman and T.K.
Jones have anything to do with my
future.
Can't these individuals, the leaders
of our country, realize that civil de
fense is useless? Tell me if I'm wrong,
but it appears obvious that our coun
try has only one alternative: prevent
a nuclear war before it happens! This
must be the administration's overrid
ing priority. Forget building up the
military. Forget civil defense. Forget
beating the Russians. Radical at
tempts at a disarmament must take
place now. There's not much time
ieft. I want to live to see the turn of
the century.
