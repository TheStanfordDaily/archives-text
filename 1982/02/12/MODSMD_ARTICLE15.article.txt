## A
						job that's 'in the swim of things' 
### James Elfers 
Jennifer Yankee works a
9-to-5 job. Every weekday
morning at her Woodside
home she eats a breakfast of
plain yogurt and fresh fruit.
Then she drives to Redwood
City where she works as a
research coordinator.
When she arrives she greets
Joe and Rosie, who are the
objects of Yankee' research.
Joe and Rosie are a pair of
bottlenose dolphins.
She may work typical
hours, but every other
aspect of Yankee's occupa
tion is far from ordinary.
Yankee's job is with the Hu
man/Dolphin Foundation
(HDF), located at Marine
World, and she is involved
with a project attempting to
communicate with bot
tlenose dolphins, a species
with a brain larger than a
human's.
Her boss and the man
spearheading the effort to
break the language barrier
between dolphins and hu
mans is John Lilly. He has
been researching dolphins
since 1955 and, in 1976, set
up HDF in Malibu, Califor
nia. It was in the summer of
1979 that Yankee first linked
up with John Lilly and HDF.
"I had always been in
terested in animals," she
said, "... and I remember
reading all of John Lilly's
books on dolphins and be
coming fascinated with his
research. Every time a
course came upon dolphins

or whales I took it. Then one
day my best friend called
and mentioned that she had
seen the HDF number in the
phone book and thought I
might be interested. I called
and happened to be in the
right place at the right time
(there were dozens of other
applicants) and got a posi
tion."
Weeks later, Yankee
found herself walking
among Hollywood celebri
ties at an HDF fundraiser. "I
was amazed," said Yankee.
"There I was talking with
Robin Williams and Burgess
Meredith. A lot of stars like
Olivia Newton-John and
others helped out with con
tributions."
It would be more than a
year before HDF had
enough money and the nec
essary facilities to actually
acquire any dolphins. John
Lilly went to the Gulf of
Mexico off the Texas coast
to supervise personally the
catching and selection of a
good male and female pair.
The dolphins were even
tually brought to Marine
World in Redwood City,
which had donated some of
its tank space to HDF.
Yankee then began to
swim and work with the
pair, now known as Joe and
Rose. A computer system
called JANUS (Joint Analog
Numerical Understanding
System) was developed, and
after the dolphins got ac
climatized to their new sur

roundings, communication
research began in force.
"JANUS is a code," Yan
kee explained, "that is not
Dolphinese and not English
but a compromise in be
tween. It is a code that can
be heard by the dolphins as
well as generated and heard
by the computer. We're
trying to meet the dolphins
at least halfway with a code
of sounds audible to them,
and we hope ultimately un
derstood by them. But for all
we know their language is
three-dimensional. They
might use their sonar to
create sonic images to talk
among themselves."
"There are a lot of in
herent problems," she con
tinued. "Penny Peterson is
communicating with a
gorilla named Koko
through sign language, but
she has a lot of advantages
over us. Physically, gorillas
are of course much closer to
humans than dolphins are,
and this means gorillas have
much more common
ground with man. Both
know what a foot is, how to
clap their hands, and so on.
Both are more or less in the
same natural environment
and have a lot of shared ex
periences to get across. But
dolphins spend all their
time in an environment of
water that man is clumsy in
and unfamiliar with. Thiejr
anatomy is much different,
and their methods of com

municating with clicks and
whistles are ideal under
water but alien to us."
Her progress with the
dolphins is painstaking and
slow. There are many blind
alleys in a field of research
that has no precedents or
rules of thumb to follow.
The communication barrier
bet we n dolphins arid hu
mans cannot be broken
with a single giant break
through but possibly
through a succession of
smaller, hard-won steps. But
while the groundbreaking is
a prolonged and ongoing
process of learning for both
man-and dolphin, it makes
each little achievement in
the research that much
sweeter.
Yankee is paid only spo
radically for her work, and
has two part-time jobs to
keep herself clothed and
fed. Her pay for her efforts
with Joe and Rose is of a dif
ferent nature: "I think of
them as kids and me as the
teacher, although when I
swim with them they're the
boss. My reward is getting
Rose to do something I've
been working on for
weeks," said Yankee. "Even
something simple like get
ting one of them to touch
their pectoral fin to my hand
when I tell them is a big ac
complishment and a great
feeling. It'sthat kind of satis
faction that keeps you
going," she concluded.
