# Medical students anticipate financial aid cuts
## 
### Michael Sweeney 
Students at the Medical School are
beginning to anticipate the effects of
President Ronald Reagan's efforts to
conduct some radical surgery on fed
eral financial aid programs.
Reagan seeks to eliminate gradu
ate students' eligibility for the Guar
anteed Student Loan Program, and to
cut a total of more than $1.5 billion in
aid to students next year. At a meet
ing this Monday, financial aid staff
members explained to students at
the Mod School what the cuts would
mean to them. At that school alone,
the University receives $1.3 million in
tuition payments through the GSL
program, according to financial aid
officer Cathy Kraus.
"This will cause students to think

twice before they enter a graduate
program," Kraus said. Eighty percent
of the students at the Medical School
are the recipients of some federal
loan program.
In addition to forcing graduate stu
dents out of the Guaranteed Student
Loan program, the administration
hopes to eliminate three other aid
programs. By the 1983-84 academic
year, officials here estimate that the
University will be losing $2,240,448 in
tuition from the federal government.
These costs, if absorbed by the Uni
versity, will have to be made up
either by the redistribution of funds
or by increased tuition.
Low-interest loans
The GSL program was amended by
the Carter administration, allowing

graduate students to take out a max
imum $5000 loan at low interest rates.
The loans were guaranteed against
default by the federal government.
However, last year during the first
round of budget cuts, the Reagan ad
ministration changed the eligibility
requirements for the loan by impos
ing a needs analysis test for students
whose family had an income of more
than $30,000. "They expect my moth
er to mortgage her house," said one
student.
This year Reagan hopes to dis
qualify completely graduate students
from the loan program, limiting them
to the high interest Auxiliary Loan
Program.
Student reactions to Reagan's pro
posals were almost all bitter.
Bitter reactions
"I never thought I would ex
perience a president like him," said
one medical student after the meet
ing. "The fact that he can send mon
ey to El Salvador to promote killing at
thistime is ludicrous," she said, refer
ring to Reagan's request Monday to
send an extra $55 million in emer
gency military aid to El Salvador.
Last year staff members within the
Medical School were able to squeeze
the paperwork through before the
first change in eligibility require
ments became effective Oct. 1. This
year, however, according to Kraus,
banks aren't taking loan applications
which they aren't sure the govern
ment will honor.
"If I don't get a loan I am going to
have to get a research job during

school next year," said another stu
dent, "and research wili be even
harder to find because more people
are going to be out looking for jobs.
If I don't find something I am going
to have to take off fora year and work
— and that's bad because stopping in
the middle makes it more difficult to
continue an education — continuity
is lost. It's a funny thing. When I
asked about financial aid last year as
an applicant they told me no one
ever has to drop out of medical
school merely out of financial neces
sity. Now I might have to."
Lobbying
Unversity officials began lobbying
against the proposals last year when
the first phase of the reductions were
proposed. In anticipation of this
month's proposed cuts, University
President Donald Kennedy testified
at a field hearing for the House of
Representatives Ways and Means
Committee last month. At that time
Kennedy asserted that any such
curtailment of aid to education might
damage the nation's productivity in
the future. Kennedy said, "We in the
higher education community view
the current cuts in the federal re
search and student aid budgets as
nothing less than a major withdrawal
of government from three decades
of commitment to the enterprises of
fundamental research and learning."
Rep. Pete McCloskey- (R-Menlo
Park), who will continue represent
ing the Stanford area through next
January, said he was not familiar with
the complicated aid to education
cuts and declined to comment.

Lobbying
Unversity officials began lobbying
against the proposals last year when
the first phase of the reductions were
proposed. In anticipation of this
month's proposed cuts, University
President Donald Kennedy testified
at a field hearing for the House of
Representatives Ways and Means
Committee last month. At that time
Kennedy asserted that any such
curtailment of aid to education might
damage the nation's productivity in
the future. Kennedy said, "We in the
higher education community view
the current cuts in the federal re
search and student aid budgets as
nothing less than a major withdrawal
of government from three decades
of commitment to the enterprises of
fundamental research and learning."
Rep. Pete McCloskey- (R-Menlo
Park), who will continue represent
ing the Stanford area through next
January, said he was not familiar with
the complicated aid to education
cuts and declined to comment.
Students at the Medical School are
beginning to anticipate the effects of
President Ronald Reagan's efforts to
conduct some radical surgery on fed
eral financial aid programs.
Reagan seeks to eliminate gradu
ate students' eligibility for the Guar
anteed Student Loan Program, and to
cut a total of more than $1.5 billion in
aid to students next year. At a meet
ing this Monday, financial aid staff
members explained to students at
the Mod School what the cuts would
mean to them. At that school alone,
the University receives $1.3 million in
tuition payments through the GSL
program, according to financial aid
officer Cathy Kraus.
"This will cause students to think

twice before they enter a graduate
program," Kraus said. Eighty percent
of the students at the Medical School
are the recipients of some federal
loan program.
In addition to forcing graduate stu
dents out of the Guaranteed Student
Loan program, the administration
hopes to eliminate three other aid
programs. By the 1983-84 academic
year, officials here estimate that the
University will be losing $2,240,448 in
tuition from the federal government.
These costs, if absorbed by the Uni
versity, will have to be made up
either by the redistribution of funds
or by increased tuition.
Low-interest loans
The GSL program was amended by
the Carter administration, allowing

graduate students to take out a max
imum $5000 loan at low interest rates.
The loans were guaranteed against
default by the federal government.
However, last year during the first
round of budget cuts, the Reagan ad
ministration changed the eligibility
requirements for the loan by impos
ing a needs analysis test for students
whose family had an income of more
than $30,000. "They expect my moth
er to mortgage her house," said one
student.
This year Reagan hopes to dis
qualify completely graduate students
from the loan program, limiting them
to the high interest Auxiliary Loan
Program.
Student reactions to Reagan's pro
posals were almost all bitter.
Bitter reactions
"I never thought I would ex
perience a president like him," said
one medical student after the meet
ing. "The fact that he can send mon
ey to El Salvador to promote killing at
thistime is ludicrous," she said, refer
ring to Reagan's request Monday to
send an extra $55 million in emer
gency military aid to El Salvador.
