## 'Women' uncommonly good 
### Tahirih Lee 
"Uncommonly good" described Wednesday night's opening
of the Drama Department's production of Uncommon Women
and Others at the Nitery in the Old Union. Student director Jackie
Kanner skillfully crafted nine actresses into an intimate ensemble
that met the demands of Wendy Wasserstein's 1971 script about
students at all-female Mount Holyoke College. Each of the seven
main characters portrays a facet of Wasserstein's outlook on her
experience as an undergraduate at a top-notch, Eastern school
where 50 percent of all graduates go on to graduate school and
the rest land respectable jobs or husbands. Pressures to excel, to
fit the school's definition of "uncommon" drive each student to
question her feminity, her self-worth, and her role in society.
Kanner wisely chose to cultivate the blatant, but witty comedy
that couches the serious theme. By doing so, she pointed out the
bittersweet irony of these young women's lives. For them fulfill
ment, even adequacy, belongs to the future instead of the pres
ent.
Over a loudspeaker an authoritative male voice introduces
each scene with cliches of admissions-brochure philosophy
about Mount Holyoke's importance to its students and to the
community at-large. Wasserstein subtly undermines these stock
phrases by reaching behind their generalities and focusing on a
group of seniors soon to leave Mount Holyoke's secure womb of
sisterhood and enter the real world.
Lisa Jacobson played Holly Kaplan, a rich, Jewish daughter of
"the inventor of velveteen." Jacobson did not succumb to the ob
vious temptation to stereotype this role, the most difficult of the
play and modeled after the author herself. Instead Jacobson in
fused Holly with a quiet sincerity that made her rebellion and in
decision believable and engaging. Jacobson sailed through the
climax of the play with her telephone monologue, a feat of as
sured artistic control. Only slightly odd was her lack of immediate
embarrassment at her admission that women comfort her and
men frighten her. Truer to Holly's nature would have been the
assumption of all blame for the awkward telephone call. Her flaw
is not only her desire to "live through other's achievements," but
also to internalize their guilt as well as their achievements.
Director Kanner again made a wise choice by using pauses, stag
ingandemphasis in dialogueto underline Holly'scentral position

in the play. In addition, Kanner effectively utilized stage space by
placing personal one-to-one exchanges close to the audience,
while relegating superficial group scenes farther back. Obviously,
Kanner found many common chords to connect to in Wassers
tein's story. Her casting, her fine coordination of feeling in the dif
ferent women, as well as some brilliant moments of emotion re

There were only detailed problems, mainly in the mispronun
ciation of names and places (the "h" in Amherst is silent). It took
the cast several scenes to adjust the timing of their dialogue to the
laughs that came after almost every line. Also, in the large group
scenes the blocking of movement bordered on clumsy. As a re
sult, a tickling line like Carter's confused response to the
alchoholic beverage "who's Sherry?" was lost. The performance
