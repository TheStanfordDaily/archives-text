# Escapist fare floats to new heights for Disney
## 
### Peter Finch 
It was almost a yearago that I stood in West
Berlin and peered over the ominous Berlin
Wall, but I will never forget how I felt. The
sight was staggering — automatic guns, mine
fields, miles of barbed wire and plenty of the
GDR's green-clad guards.
Only days before I arrived a young east
erner was gunned down attempting to scale
the wall. It seemed like a ridiculous idea. I re
member turning to my German friend, a Ber
lin resident, and asking if she could re
member anyone ever escaping.
Yes, she said, and proceeded to tell me a
fantastic story. It was the story of a pair of East
German families who, fed up with their op
pressive government, decided they had to es
cape. She told me they attempted to cross the
Wall in a hot-air balloon two times, and suc
ceeded on their second try.
Unbelievable. I told her the story sounded
like some crazy movie.
Well, now it is. Produced by Walt Disney
and starring John (Elephant Man) Hurt and
Jane Alexander, Night Crossing is the slightly
souped-up, Hollywood version of the story I
heard in Germany.
It's an entertaining film, pure and simple.
This is mostly due to the quality of the story
itself. I'm sure Disney figured if they spent
enough money to lend the film any margin of
believability (i.e., no cardboard backdrops
fluttering in the wind), the excitement of
building the two balloons under wraps and
the undeniably heartwarming nature of the
story's heroic finish would pull them
through.

Essentially, it did. Even aware that the first
attempt to get free would be a failure (as you
are now), my heart sank as the balloon
dipped into the forest. And even knowing
what would happen in the end didn't keep
me from tapping my foot nervously on the
sticky theater floor.
Hurt, the instigator of the escape, is defi
nitely not at his best. His performance, along
with the rest of the cast, is at best acceptable.
No one disgraces himself, but noone partic
ularly excels either. Perhaps this is the fault of
the script, which naturally gives the heroes
and heroines flawless personalities. Essential
ly what we see is two perfect families, only
burdened by their oppressive government.
Therefore, the only real conflict is between
"our heroes" and"the bad guys" — hardly
the stuff classic characterizations are made of.
My other major gripe is the language. Of
course, it would have been ridiculous to have
all the characters speak German. It is, after all,
an American movie. But what happens is
something like the "Hogan's Heroes" syn
drome — the good guysall speak with Ameri
can or, in the lone case of Hurt, English ac
cents and the bad guys sound remotely like
Germans. "Javol, Colonel Klink," and so
forth.
All in all, Night Crossing is your basic family
entertainment movie — lots of togetherness,
adversity is nicely overcome, there's not a
whole lot of violence and it's got a happy end
ing. And in spite of all that, it was exciting
enough to keep me interested.
