### David Schmelzer 
Rick Springfield
The Warfield Theatre/San
Francisco
6 February 1982
The first solid evidence that
we weren't at an ordinary con
cert came about ten minutes
after the opening act had left.
Inside the formal, maybe even
colonial, setting of the War
field Theatre, there began a
squealing chant of "We want
Rick!", and my friend and I
wondered who this audience
was that didn't realize any self
respecting musician routinely
makes hisaudience wait at least
35 minutes between acts. The
six year-old girl next to us
should have tipped us off, but it
wasn't until we turned around
and saw the unbroken rows of
smiling, well-dressed, junior
high age girls that we under
stood the audience Rick
Springfield plays to.
Twenty-five minutes and
three revivals of "We want
Rick!" later, the lights went
down and Rick ran on in a pink
suit. The girls let loose with a
yell that didn't completely die
until the concert ended. Every
gesture, every pause, every
new expression of Springfield's
drew a separate wave of re
sponse.
At first it seemed that this
must get irritating to him. After
all, it's hard to betaken serious
ly when your music can't be
heard over the squeals-of ador
ing, very young girls. He did try
to sit down and tell a serious
story (about either leaving his
native Australia or about the
death of his father — it was so
hard to be sure), but he
couldn't get through it because
of persistent calls of "We love
you, Rick!", and so finally had
to cut it short and play.
But right when I began to
feel sorry for him, he began a
slow strip-tease. On one
number he took off his jacket,
later he unbuttoned his shirt,
and later he took of the shirt to
reveal an undershirt. I got the
feeling he understood the na
ture of his audience very well
when he ran down into the
seats, and into a cloudburst of
pawing hands, to play a few
chords while standing on the

armrests of some awestruck
lady's chair, before being
forced to rush back to the stage
when women broke through
the protection of his guards.
It's hard to report how good
his music was, because it's rare
that I heard more than frag
ments of it. Most of his material
was from his current "Working
Class Dog" album, which con
tains pleasant, middle of the
road rockers about what a girl

1) has done to him, or 2) means
to him. I enjoy the album, but
it's hard to believe any serious
artist would degrade himself by
doing the type of show he put
on. Almost every move was a
play for another scream — his
favorites being a hard down
strum on his guitar (where he
poses with his hand nearly
touching the ground and then
looks out as if to say, "How
'bout that?") and a solemn
point at some lucky girl in the
lower level. When he came out
for an encore wearing wet suit
bottoms and an open vest that
said "INSATIABLE" on the
back, I thought most of the
crowd would collapse.
His crowd-teasing moments
didn't seem to be done in play
fulness, but rather with the res
ignation that this was what the
crowd had come to see. It
wasn't so much a show where a
singer performed his songs as it
was one where you got to see

your favorite beefcake star of
General Hospital smile and
pose. He was creative enough
to indicate he could put on a
pretty good rock show. The
night was well-paced. After
opening with rockers "The
Light of Love," "Everybody's
Girl" and some older songs, he
had his band leave the stage
while he did some slower num
bers by himself. Springfield
changed some songs around,

beginning "Carry Me Away"
with a soft guitar solo and slow
ing down "Hole in My Heart"
for drama. He also played a
neat little number titled "She
Called Me 'Bruce/ " after ex
plaining that people some
times confuse his name with
that of another musician, Bruce
Springsteen. Oh.
But his fame from his role on
General Hospital has killed off
any chance of his being anoth
er Springsteen and has pointed
him instead in the direction of
Donny Osmond. Springfield is
older and his music is better,
but his appeal is similar and
he's chosen to play on this. So
rather than growing in talent
and playing to more sophisti
cated crowds, it looks like he'll
be content to tease audiences
that hold up signs saying "We
Wish We Were Jessie's Girl"
and "We Do Everything For
You."
