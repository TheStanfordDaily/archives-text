# Occasional careers of Richardson and Penn
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
lony Richardson hasn't
fccted a movie in a long time
loseph Andrews was his last
Ind he has had so many flops
n I doubt anyone still con
trs him a major talent. I
In't care for his style even in
I heyday — good films like
I Entertainer and A Taste of
Iney, it seems to me, would
le been better if someone
fc had directed them — so his
|w picture, The Border, came
la real surprise. It's a very
lod movie, made with more
htrol and more sensitivity
bn Richardson has ever
bwn before.
vhe Border is set in El Paso,
lere Charlie Smith (Jack
rholson) and his wife Marcy
plerie Perrine) have moved
>m southern California to be
lar Marcy's sister Savannah
lannon Wilcox). Savannah's
isband Cat (Harvey Keitel)
ids Charlie a job working

B es 'de him on the border pa
-1)1, picking up wetbacks. It's a
jmmy job, and Charlie, who
moved by the distress of the
ior Mexicans who sneak
ross the border to make a
a/ extra bucks a day working
Texas, is disturbed by their
ntempt for him and by the
of most of the
her patrolmen, including Cat
d the captain, Red (Warren
ates), in various illegal ac
ities — the employment of
ens who are supposed to be
ipped back to Mexico, drugs,
pidnaping, and the murder of
"independents" who are com
peting with the syndicate that
furnishes wetbacks for hire.
Charlie is an unusually sym
pathetic rcile for Jack Nich-
I olson, and he gives a warm, in
| telligent performance — his

best, aside from his supporting
role in Reds, since the days of
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest and The Missouri Breaks.
Recently, Nicholson has been
mired in a terribly mannered,
speed-freak acting style that
excludes us in the audience; he
was so wired as the psychotic
father in The Shining that I
could barely stand to watch
him,and I kept wondering why
his wife, Shelley Duvall, con
tinued to live with a man so
clearly off his hinges. (If Faye
Dunaway had played opposite
him, it would truly have been a
marriage made in Frank
enstein's lab.) In The Border he
has rediscovered nuance, and
feeling. Charlie's hubcaps are
stolen by a Mexican boy, Juan
(Manuel Viescas), whose sister
Maria (Elpidia Carrillo) returns
them; the next day, these two
are among the wetbacks
picked up by the border patrol,
and when Charlie tries tospeak

to Maria, she spits in his face.
Nicholson plays this scene as a
genuine shock to Charlie, who
is trying to make human con
tact and feels hurt and guilty
when he is rebuffed. And in
this movie, Nicholson modifies
the emotion he is famous for
conveying on screen — anger.
Furious with Marcy for spend
ing too much money on
furniture for their new home,
Charlie slaps her, and then re
coils in amazement and disgust
at what he has just done. I can't
remember ever seeing Nich
olson play a character appalled
by his own capacity for vio
lence before; he's wonderful
in this scene, and the fact that it
is so uncommon in terms of his
career increases our enjoy
ment of it.
Charlie is the normative

character in The Border; since
Richardson makes us see the
border situation through
Charlie's eyes, the movie be
comes a compassionate
chronicle of hopeless lives. In
its best moments, the film at
tains an eloquent expression of
despair comparable to Pixote's.
In their own country, these
Mexicans are so steeped in
poverty that the step to prosti
tution and dope addiction isan
inevitable one; in America,
they are exploited by uncaring
employers and live in constant
fear of deportation, but still
they are better off than they
were at home. It's a dreadful
double bind, and the
screenwriters (Deric Wash
burn, Walon Green and David
Freeman) use Maria and Juan
as an emblem for it. Maria's
baby is stolen by an attendant
while she is waiting to be sent
home, and in an effort to raise
money to buy him back, she
becomes a whore; Juan, street
smart from the beginning, gets
into drugs. The unactorish per
formances of Elpidia Carrillo
and Manuel Viescas under
score the authenticity of their
scenes. She is so convincing in
the scene in which she dis
covers the loss of her child that
we react with a curious mixture
of horror and helplessness and
embarrassment, as if we had
seen a woman in hysterics on
the street. Ric Waite's white
hot photography is an asset,
and so is the plaintive, bluesy
score by Ry Cooder (after The
Long Riders and Southern
Comfort, his third winner in a
row). In the best scene, aliens
are stopped at night by pa
trolmen as they cross the river;
Richadson and Waite create an
achingly beautiful tragic can
vas.
The domestic scenes, un
fortunately, lack the powerand
plausibility of the wetback se
quences. The script deserts
Charlie when he gets off work;
he's stuck with an empty
headed spendthrift wife. Even
if Valerie Perrine weren't
playing Marcy like Miss
Adelaide in a summer stock
production of Guys and Dolls
(roughly the same way she
played Gene Hackman's mis
tress in the Superman movies),

there wouldn't be much she
could do with the role. Marcy
and her sister Savannah are
dumb, sexy broads whose idea
of heaven is a brand-new con
do in south Texas. They exist so
that they movie can score
points against them.
The central plot, in which
Charlie helps Maria to recover
her baby, is far from fresh —
one detects strong traces of
Three Godfathers and Lilies of
the Field, among others — but
Richardson doesn't shove it at
us. And if we have to pay for
this understatement by work
ing extra hard to assimilate plot
details — Richardson takes a
somewhat cavalier attitude
toward the narrative — it's
worth the trouble.

Arthur Penn works even
less frequently than Tony Rich
ardson, but his movies are gen
erally uptosomething interest
ing and so one anticipates any
new one with pleasure.
(Watching the running scenes
in Chariots of Fire, I couldn't
help remembering the
agonized slow motion high
jumpers in the segment Penn
directed for the anthology
Olympic film Visions of Eight —
a model Chariots didn't meas
ure up to.) Penn's Four Friends
is fascinating — fascinatingly
awful. It's an uncannily consis
tent movie: not a single scene
in it is believable for an instant.
Working from a bizarre
screenplay by Steve Tesich
about a quartet of small-town
kids from Indiana who gradu
ate from high school in 1961
and travel from there onto dis
parate planes of experience,
Penn has heightened his style
to something approaching
frenzy: the comic scenes are
feverishly overworked and the
tragicscenesare grotesque and
devoid of emotion.
Four Friends is an inap
propriate title, actually; after
the first few scenes, we see
hardly anything more of David
(Michael Huddleston), who
stays in East Chicago, Indiana
and becomesan undertaker, or
of Jim (Jim Metzler), who goes

off to Vietnam, and the girl all
three guys adore, Georgia (Jodi
Thelen), drifts in and out of the
film. Tesich concentrates on
Danilo (Craig Wasson), a first
generation American whose
father (Miklos Simon) brought
him and his mother (Elizabeth
Lawrence) from Yugoslavia
when he was a young boy.
Tesich's own background is
similar to Danilo's, and so Four
Friends comes closer to his
own experience than even his
first screenplay, Breaking
Away, did; but whereas
Tesich's passion for America is
generally a salient character
istic of his writing (it cropped
up in Eyewitness, too, in the
rags-riches romance), in this
picture he doesn't appear to
have worked out his feelings
about his adopted land. It's a
weird, ambivalent movie — a
love-hate letter to America.
Danilo's father is bitter about
his exhausting, underpaid job

in a steel mill, and he taunts his
son for wanting to go to col
lege, but Danilo goes to North
western and falls in love with
his roommate's sister (Julia
Murry), the offspring of a
wealthy family. However, if this
family is meant to representthe
American aristocracy, Tesich's
vision is a far more bitter one
than Danilo's father's: Mr.
Carnahan harbors an in
cestuous craving for his daugh
ter, his wife (Lois Smith) isan al
coholic wreck, and the only
person of true value in the lot,
Danilo's friend Louis (Reed
Birney), is dying of multiple
sclerosis. Tesich has Danilo
struggling fora Horatio Alger
dream in the face of entropy,
and yet he doesn't seem to take
his own ideas seriously: Danilo
and the other characters keep
resurfacing like the people in
Candide, and it's not clear
what, if anything, they've
learned from their adventures.

Full of abrupt shifts in tone
and ominous incidents, Four
Friends is a much creepier
movie than its makers could
have intended, because noth
ing in it seems rooted in a rec
ognizable reality and yet the
unpleasantness keeps coming.
The acting is almost all terrible;
after Ghost Story and this mov
ie, I'd like a long rest from
Craig Wasson's elocution-class
style, and Jodi Thelen, whose
character was planned, per
haps, as a kind of '60s coun
terculture Catherine to a Jules
and a pair of Jims, hasa peculiar
throaty drawl like Amanda
Pluinmer's but no notion of
what to do with it — all her
lines sound like baby talk. Four
Friends isn't a movie that sends
you out wondering why it was
made, like so many fiascoes,
but why no one on the set re
alized how far it had gone
wrong.
