Correction
Yesterday's story on the letters
being sent on behalf of Robert Simon
attributed Palo Alto District Attorney
Randy Hey as saying that Simon
could face up to three years in jail. It
was actually Defense Attorney Wil- i
liam Keogh who said that Simon may 1
face up to six years in jail.
No paper Monday
Many people have compared the
absence of the Daily with some of the
great historical tragedies of our time.
Of course, many people do a lot of
strange things. Nevertheless, it must
be said that as sad as it may seem, the
Daily will not appear Monday. The
campus will not be filled with in
teresting, thought-provoking, in
sightful and humorous articles and
pictures of the kind that regularly ap
pear in the Daily on Monday. But that
will just make Tuesday, when the Dai
ly once again graces the campus with
its presence, that much better.
