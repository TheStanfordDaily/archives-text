# Seniors sign to play at Farm

Round 1 of the 1982 Pacific-10 football race has begun
and Stanford is already down from last year.
Head coach Paul Wiggin and staff began the season
Wednesday, signing 18 high school players to national
letters of intent to play here next year.
Although Wiggin says the quality of the group is down
from last year, he won't compare the classes.
"It's not really fair to compare this year's recruits with
last year's," Wiggin said, "because last year was probably
the greatest recruiting year in modern Stanford history.
"It was a good year," Wiggin continued, "it was not a
disappointing year. In recruiting, you have a tendency,
sometimes, to focus on the negative side, but we got a lot
of players who are going to help us. You've got to look at
the positive side."
Stanford's biggest catch may be running back-receiver
Ken Williams — a 6-2, 186 pounder with 9.7 (100 yard
dash) speed from San Jose.
Williams, a first team All-Northern California selec
tion, averaged 6.9 yards a carry, caught 21 passes and
scored 12 touchdowns last year.
"Ken Williams will play a dramatic role on our team
next year," Wiggin said, "there's no question about it.
Ken gives us an absolute phenomenon as a receiver."
The highly-recruited Williams chose Stanford over Ar
izona State in a tough recruiting battle between the
schools for several reasons.
"I opted for Stanford because of the academic pres
tige," Williams said from his San Jose home. "Plus, they'll
let me play both football and baseball. Distance was also
a factor — this way I'll be closer to home and my friends
and family can see me play.
"I expect to see some action right away," Williams
continued, "but I have to go out and prove myself, just as
I'll have to prove myself in the classroom."
Also on the offensive side, running back Stan Gill from
Flagstaff, Ariz, signed at the Farm.
Gill — a 5-10,190 pounder — rushedfor2lloyardsand
35 touchdowns last year. Gill racked up 3316 all-purpose
yards and led his team to a 12-0-1 record and an Arizona
state title.
"He has incredible balance," Wiggin said. "He's a
strong-legged, low-built kind of back who combines
powerful running with dramatic speed."
Gill was wooed by most major colleges, but signed at
Stanford for academic and location reasons.
In choosing Stanford over UCLA, Nebraska, Houston
and Arizona, Gill expects to fit right into the system.
"I expect to contribute immediately," Gill said, "I'm
going to play — somewhere."
The biggest disappointment in the recruiting year
came in the area of linemen.
"We're starting to develop needs in the linemen
area," Wiggin said. "If there was one area where we
didn't do as well as we wanted to, that was it. There were

three big linemen — two were longshots — who got
away."
After losing all four linebackers to graduation, Stan
ford bounced back by signing four prominant high
school linebackers.
Heading the list are NorCal Co-Defensive players of
the year George Ebertin and Michael Noble, and Tom
Prukop.
Ebertin — a 6-2, 225 pound All-Central Coast Section
pick from San Jose's Bel'.armine Prep — follows Jeff Ar
rillaga as the second consecutive CCS Player of the Year
to enroll at Stanford.
Noble — a 6-4, 215 pound All-NorCal selection from
Monte Vista, intercepted 13 passes as a linebacker and
defensive back and led Monte Vista to the 1981 NorCal
AAAA Section Championship.
Prukop — a 6-3, 23 0 pound linebacker from South
Gate — was a First Team All-CIF Division 1 selection.
"We got four or five good linebackers," Wiggin said,
"All four starters from last years team are gone. Prukop,
Noble and Ebertin are all premiere linebackers."
David Wyman, Nevada Player of the Year in 1981,
chose Stanford over virtually all of the nation's football
powerhouses.
Wyman — a 6-3, 225 pound linebacker — is the
brother of Stanford sophomore defensive tackle Mike
Wyman.
"David was recruited by virtually every majorschool in
the nation," Wiggiri said, "We're glad he chose Stan
ford."
Alan Summers — a 6-4, 195 pound tight end-wide re
ceiver from Solana Beach — also followed the family
tradition by enrolling at Stanford. Alan's brother Jay is a
senior linebacker.
Summers caught 44 passes for 777 yards and five touch
downs last year.
Defensively, Stan ford also signed Del Detwiler — a 6-3,
230 pound linebacker and California state discus cham
pion.
Detwiler racked up 102 tackles last fall despite missing
two mid-season gcimes with a knee injury.
Walter Harris -- a 6-1, 180 pound running back-de
fensive back from Lodi — rushed for 1021 yards and 11
touchdowns offensively and intercepted five passes and
made 35 unassiste d tackles defensively last year.
Bob Jansen — i\ 6-3, 225 pound linebacker — made 93
tackles last year.
Also signing at Stanford were Tom Nye 6-3, 230 pound
guard; Mark Andrew 6-3, 215 pound tight end-line
backer; Andy Hs u 6-5, 240 pound tackle; Kurt Josephson
6-4, 225 pound I:ight end-linebacker; Kevin Payne 6-4,
230 pound tackle-defensive tackle; Kevin Scott 6-4, 195
pound tight end-wide receiver; Ernie Fisher 6-4, 215
pound tight end -defensive tackle; and Greg Baty 6-5,220
pound tight enc l-defensive tackle.

a factor — this way I'll be closer to home and my friends
and family can see me play.
"I expect to see some action right away," Williams
continued, "but I have to go out and prove myself, just as
I'll have to prove myself in the classroom."
Also on the offensive side, running back Stan Gill from
Flagstaff, Ariz, signed at the Farm.
Gill — a 5-10,190 pounder — rushedfor2lloyardsand
35 touchdowns last year. Gill racked up 3316 all-purpose
yards and led his team to a 12-0-1 record and an Arizona
state title.
"He has incredible balance," Wiggin said. "He's a
strong-legged, low-built kind of back who combines
powerful running with dramatic speed."
Gill was wooed by most major colleges, but signed at
Stanford for academic and location reasons.
In choosing Stanford over UCLA, Nebraska, Houston
and Arizona, Gill expects to fit right into the system.
"I expect to contribute immediately," Gill said, "I'm
going to play — somewhere."
The biggest disappointment in the recruiting year
came in the area of linemen.
"We're starting to develop needs in the linemen
area," Wiggin said. "If there was one area where we
didn't do as well as we wanted to, that was it. There were

three big linemen — two were longshots — who got
away."
After losing all four linebackers to graduation, Stan
ford bounced back by signing four prominant high
school linebackers.
Heading the list are NorCal Co-Defensive players of
the year George Ebertin and Michael Noble, and Tom
Prukop.
Ebertin — a 6-2, 225 pound All-Central Coast Section
pick from San Jose's Bel'.armine Prep — follows Jeff Ar
rillaga as the second consecutive CCS Player of the Year
to enroll at Stanford.
Noble — a 6-4, 215 pound All-NorCal selection from
Monte Vista, intercepted 13 passes as a linebacker and
defensive back and led Monte Vista to the 1981 NorCal
AAAA Section Championship.
Prukop — a 6-3, 23 0 pound linebacker from South
Gate — was a First Team All-CIF Division 1 selection.
"We got four or five good linebackers," Wiggin said,
"All four starters from last years team are gone. Prukop,
Noble and Ebertin are all premiere linebackers."
David Wyman, Nevada Player of the Year in 1981,
chose Stanford over virtually all of the nation's football
powerhouses.
Wyman — a 6-3, 225 pound linebacker — is the
brother of Stanford sophomore defensive tackle Mike
Wyman.
"David was recruited by virtually every majorschool in
the nation," Wiggiri said, "We're glad he chose Stan
ford."
Alan Summers — a 6-4, 195 pound tight end-wide re
ceiver from Solana Beach — also followed the family
tradition by enrolling at Stanford. Alan's brother Jay is a
senior linebacker.
Summers caught 44 passes for 777 yards and five touch
downs last year.
Defensively, Stan ford also signed Del Detwiler — a 6-3,
230 pound linebacker and California state discus cham
pion.
Detwiler racked up 102 tackles last fall despite missing
two mid-season gcimes with a knee injury.
Walter Harris -- a 6-1, 180 pound running back-de
fensive back from Lodi — rushed for 1021 yards and 11
touchdowns offensively and intercepted five passes and
made 35 unassiste d tackles defensively last year.
Bob Jansen — i\ 6-3, 225 pound linebacker — made 93
tackles last year.
Also signing at Stanford were Tom Nye 6-3, 230 pound
guard; Mark Andrew 6-3, 215 pound tight end-line
backer; Andy Hs u 6-5, 240 pound tackle; Kurt Josephson
6-4, 225 pound I:ight end-linebacker; Kevin Payne 6-4,
230 pound tackle-defensive tackle; Kevin Scott 6-4, 195
pound tight end-wide receiver; Ernie Fisher 6-4, 215
pound tight end -defensive tackle; and Greg Baty 6-5,220
pound tight enc l-defensive tackle.

Round 1 of the 1982 Pacific-10 football race has begun
and Stanford is already down from last year.
Head coach Paul Wiggin and staff began the season
Wednesday, signing 18 high school players to national
letters of intent to play here next year.
Although Wiggin says the quality of the group is down
from last year, he won't compare the classes.
"It's not really fair to compare this year's recruits with
last year's," Wiggin said, "because last year was probably
the greatest recruiting year in modern Stanford history.
"It was a good year," Wiggin continued, "it was not a
disappointing year. In recruiting, you have a tendency,
sometimes, to focus on the negative side, but we got a lot
of players who are going to help us. You've got to look at
the positive side."
Stanford's biggest catch may be running back-receiver
Ken Williams — a 6-2, 186 pounder with 9.7 (100 yard
dash) speed from San Jose.
Williams, a first team All-Northern California selec
tion, averaged 6.9 yards a carry, caught 21 passes and
scored 12 touchdowns last year.
"Ken Williams will play a dramatic role on our team
next year," Wiggin said, "there's no question about it.
Ken gives us an absolute phenomenon as a receiver."
The highly-recruited Williams chose Stanford over Ar
izona State in a tough recruiting battle between the
schools for several reasons.
"I opted for Stanford because of the academic pres
tige," Williams said from his San Jose home. "Plus, they'll
let me play both football and baseball. Distance was also
a factor — this way I'll be closer to home and my friends
and family can see me play.
"I expect to see some action right away," Williams
continued, "but I have to go out and prove myself, just as
I'll have to prove myself in the classroom."

Flagstaff, Ariz, signed at the Farm.
