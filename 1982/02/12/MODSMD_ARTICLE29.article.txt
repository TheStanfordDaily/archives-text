### Sid Spaeth 
In Stanford's 111-81 humiliating
loss to Oregon State Saturday night,
KSFO radio broadcaster Ron Barr de
scribed senior guard Doug Marty:
"He always looks tired. His face gets
all red, but he never slows down."
Marty, a senior guard, has dedi
cated four years of his life to Stanford
basketball and, as an economics ma
jor, was selected to fourth team Aca
demic All-America last year.
Despite these interests and re
sponsibilities, the small 6-2 guard
takes time to be a giant to a child
from a broken home.
Marty is a member of the NCAA
Volunteers for Youth and has been a
"Big Brother" to 15-year-old Jerry
Donofrio of Palo Alto for four years.
"We've had some great times to
gether," Marty said of his rela
tionship with Jerry. "It's more re
warding than I thought it would be
when I joined the program. Now that
we know each other well, it's a lot
more fun.
"I usually see Jerry on weekends,"
Marty continued. "I also try to call
him up at least once during the week.
But the commitment is much more
than the hours spent. The kids in the
program aren't necessarily bad kids,
just those from split homes who need

someone to look up to."
Marty is one of four Stanford
basketball players in the Big Brother
program.
"We (Jerry and Doug) go bowling
and play miniature golf a lot," Marty
said. "After we beat UCLA last year, I
brought him to a fraternity party. It
was an interesting experience for
him. I think being with me, he gets
exposed to other things and has
someone to help interpret it for him.
It lets him know there is diversity in
the world."
Marty, on the court, is averaging
6.5 points and 2.5 assists a game. He
leads Stanford in minutes played with
with a 33.5 minute average.
"Doug may not be as c juick as some
Pac-10 guards," explained head
coach Dick Dißiaso, "but he's always
been in great physical c ondition."
"I've got some talentMarty said,
"yet I feel I HAVE tc» be in good
shape. I just can't go on the court and
jet by people. I have tc» be physically
ready to compete on this level and
get the most out of my ability."
And his face gets cull red, but he
never slows down. F or Jerry, that's
important.
For Marty, "It's be en a beautiful
thing."
