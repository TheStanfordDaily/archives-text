Salvadoran government claims control
San Salvador, El Salvador — El Salvador's defense minister claimed
yesterday that his forces have the upper hand against leftist guerrillas,
and a military source said the army has launched a major campaign
against the rebels in the southeastern part of the country.
Minister Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia denied news reports that the
guerrillas control territory or are able to move freely in large parts of the
country.
"The armed forces absolutely control all the national territory," he
said, claiming the guerrilla reports were part of a propaganda campaign
to undermine the credibility of the U.S.-supported junta abroad.
On Wednesday, counter-insurgency troops launched a sweep
through large parts of Usulutan province, 81 miles southeast of the capi
tal, where the guerrillas maintain a number of secret strongholds, a mili
tary source said.
The source, who asked anonymity for security reasons, identified the
soldiers as members of the army's crack Atlacatl and Atonatl battalions.
Residents of Usulutan City, the provincial capital, said they saw 18
trucks loaded with troops pass through during the night, apparently
heading for the town of juacaran.
A Defense Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the Usulutan
operation, but said "the army constantly undertakes actions" to find
and destroy enemy strongholds.
El Salvador's Human Rights Commission estimates that 32,000 civilians
have been killed in the 27-month civil war between government troops
and leftist guerrillas.
The guerrillas have been either unwilling or unable to occupy towns
or villages for long periods. Instead, they have engaged in hit-and-run
raids against selected targets.
Last week, the guerrillas started switching their attacks from the coun
tryside to urban centers. They burned more than 55 buses in San
Salvador and two other cities.
Western diplomats, who asked anonymity for policy rea
sons, said the army is was in a worse position now than a year
ago when guerrillas launched a nationwide offensive that
failed for lack of popular support.
The Reagan administration, which is committed to preven
ting a Marxist victory in El Salvador, sent six helicopters to re
place the damaged planes, and announced plans to increase
military aid to the junta.
In Washington, sources who asked not to be identified
said the administration will ask Congress for $52 million in
military aid for 1983, twice the amount originally requested.
Reps oppose secrecy proposal
Washington — The chairmen of eight House committees
and subcommittees asked the White House yesterday not to
rush ahead with a controversial new executive order that
could make more government records secret.
The proposal, which also would wipe out existing rules en
couraging declassification after 20 years, was submitted to
selected congressional committees last week for review by
Feb. 22.
Leading members of House committees and subcommit
tees dealing with Science and Technology, Agriculture, For
eign Affairs, Government Operations, the Judiciary and In
telligence protested in a joint letter that they needed more
time in view of the scope of the proposed changes.
"The classification rules affect not only the executive
branch and the Congress but also the scientific, industrial,
research and academic communities," they said in the letter
to White House national security adviser William Clark. "No
change should be made . . . without allowing for thorough
review."
Under President Jimmy Carter's 1978 order on classi
fication of national security information, and an earlier one
promulgated by President Richard Nixon in 1972, it has been
a basic rule that material should not be classified if there is a
reasonable doubt about the need to do that.
Under the White House draft of the Reagan order, the new
rule would be: when in doubt, classify.
The 40-page draft would apparently permit the classi
fication of "basic scientific research information," which the
Carter order prohibits. The draft also would authorize gov
ernment officials under certain circumstances to"reclassify"
information that has already been declassified.
Robert Lewis, a spokesman for the Society of Professional
Journalists, complained in a letter to the members of the
House and Senate Intelligence committees that, read broad
ly, the rules "could include, for example, all computer oper
ations and telecommunications."
According to a legislative aide who attended a briefing on
the draft order, the administration's basic pitch is that the
language of the order is "very broad" not because it plans to
classify that much more information, but because it wants to
keep the courts from questioning the actions of the Ex
ecutive Branch.
"What they're really saying is 'Trust us,' " this aide said.
Steven Garfinkel, who as director of the executive
branch's Information Security Oversight Office has been in
volved in drafting the order, also reportedly told at least one
group of staffers that the administration wants to add the En
vironmental Protection Agency to the list of agencies with
classification authority, so that it can protect documents
dealing with issues such as "acid rain in Canada." Garfinkel
was unavailable for comment.
Republicans want 'running room'
Washington — Republican leaders told President Ronald
Reagan yesterday of lagging congressional support for his
record-deficit budget, and even his closest Senate friend
asked for "running room ... to come up with some better
results."
Reagan replied that while "I've sent a budget up that I be
lieve in very much," Congress should have the chance to
find further cuts. But he ruled out compromising on his 18
percent boost for the Pentagon. And he also rejected any at
tempt to increase revenues by trimming his tax cuts.
Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee, Sen.
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.) and House Republican Leader Robert
Michel confronted Reagan with the assessment that the
$757-billion plan for fiscal 1983 simply won't fly so long as it
projects deficits approaching $100 billion in that and future
years.
Michel told reporters later that many conservatives feel

"pole-axed" by that proposed flood of red ink.
And Laxalt declared after the session with Reagan and Vice
President George Bush that "the name of the game is getting
that interest rate down, and the way to get it down very frank
ly ... is to reduce the size of the deficits."
"No budget is sacrosanct," said Baker. He added that the
president himself believes "there's got to be give and take
and there's got to be compromise."
But Reagan spokesman David Gergen said it was too early
to talk about compromising on details of the program.
Later, however, Reagan himself used Laxalt's phrase when
he agreed Congress "should have the running room to be
able to talk" about potential cuts in the budget so long as
they don't apply to defense. Asked if he were disturbed by
the congressional criticism, the president said: "No, because
I know they're going home in a few days, and when they get
home they're going to find out how much the people want
what we have proposed."
Last year, Congress gave Reagan virtually everything he
wanted in the way of tax and spending cuts.
Reagan's budget anticipates deficits of $98.6 billion this
year, $91.5 billion in 1983 and $82 billion in 1984. Republicans
and Democrat alike say the actual figures will be even higher.
Fighting in Syria called serious
Damascus, Syria — Fighting raged yesterday between re
bel Sunni Moslems and an estimated 8000 Syrian troops shell
ing the city of Hama for the ninth day, Western diplomatic
and other foreign sources said.
The leftist government said Hama was sealed off but that
reports of a revolt were United States slanders.
One Western resident of Damascus attempting to reach
the besieged city 120 miles north of here was turned back by
police who told him he could not continue because of fight
ing. He said he saw President Hafez Assad's reinforcements
heading into Hama and ambulances coming out.
Casualty figures could not be estimated accurately, but
diplomatic and other accounts say the number of killed is in
the hundreds and damage is extensive in the city of 200,000.
Hama is a stronghold of Syria's Sunni Moslem majority and
theoutlawed Moslem Brotherhood, which hasbeen fighting
to oust Assad and replace his 12-year-old government with a
Moslem fundamentalist regime.
Kidney patients claim threat
Washington — Kidney dialysis patients charged yesterday
that their lives are threatened by proposed Reagan adminis
tration cuts in Medicare reimbursement for dialysis.
More than 100 kidney patients and several dozen social
workers, nurses and other advocates demonstrated at the
headquarters of the Health and Human Services Department
against the planned new limits on dialysis payments.
The new overall payment rate of $128 for dialysis in clinics
and $132 in hospitals — with some variations to take local la
bor costs into account — is designed to save Medicare $130
million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and encourage pa
tients to use less expensive home dialysis.
Health and Human Services Secretary Richard Schweiker
issued a statement denying that the agency's regulations will
harm kidney dialysis patients.
"Instead, we are revising our payment structure to carry
out the Congress' desire to encourage more efficient use of
dialysis services. The determination of whether a patient gets
care at home or in a facility is one to be made by the physi
cian in consultation with the patient."
Under kidney failure, which is irreversible, the body ac
cumulates water, salt and toxic wastes that can lead to death.
Dialysis machines are used in such cases to purify the blood
during three-times-a-week sessions of three to four hours
each.
Medicare isspendingan estimated $1.8 billionthisyearfor
dialysis for 59,200 people, kidney transplants for 5,000 and
follow-up treatment for 8,000 other transplant recipients.
There were only 11,000 patients when the program began
in mid-1973, and the bill for 1974, the first full year, was $229
million.
Reds sweeps Oscar nominations
Hollywood —Warren Beatty, who failed to win an Oscar in
seven earlier tries, collected major honors at the 54th
Academy Award nominations yesterday, scoring in four ma
jor categories.
Beatty's Reds, the saga of John Reed, an American journal
ist in revolutionary Russia, collected the most nominations of

the day with 12, including best picture. Other nominees for
best picture included On Golden Pond, which garnered a
second-place 10 nominations; Atlantic City; Raiders of the
/.osf Ark, and Chariots of Fire.
Beatty was himself nominated in four categories: actor, di
rector, writer and producer of a nominee for best picture. In
1978 he was also named for quadruple awards for Heaven
Can Wait, but won nothing.
Three veteran stars face Beatty in the race for best actor:
Henry Fonda for On Golden Pond; Burt Lancaster, Atlantic
City; and Paul Newman, Absence of Malice." Together they
have amassed 12 nominations. The other contender, Dudley
Moore, »he overprivileged inebriate of Arthur, was nomi
nated for the first time.
Katharine Hepburn, who won the first of her 13 nomi
nations in 1933, was named for her role as the peace-making
wife and mother in On Golden Pond, a bittersweet drama of
a man facing old age. The other nominees for best actress
came from the new breed: Diane Keaton, Reds; Marsha Ma
son, Only When I Laugh; Susan Sarandon, Atlantic City; and
Meryl Streep, The French Lieutenant's Woman.
Jack Nicholson, best actor of 1975 for One Flew over the
Cuckoo's Nest, became a supporting actor nominee for his
role as playwright Eugene O'Neill in Reds. Also nominated
were James Coco, Only When I Laugh; John Gielgud, Arthur
; lan Holm, Chariots of Fire; and Howard Rollins, Ragtime.
For best foreign language film, the nominees are: The Boat
is Full, Switzerland; Man of Iron, Poland; Mephisto, Hunga
ry; Muddy River, Japan; Three Brothers, Italy.
Chisholm announces retirement
Washington — Rep. Shirley Chisholm, who came to Con
gress as an outspoken maverick 13 years ago, said yesterday
she now finds the job "tedious and frustrating" and will not
run for re-election.
"It has become increasingly difficult to carry the tragic
messages back from Washington to the jobless, homeless
and hopeless Brooklynites," the New York Democrat said in
a written statement.
Chisholm, 57, the first black woman ever to win a seat in
the House of Representatives, became known nationally for
her fiery speeches and her 1972 campaign for the presidency.
But in recent years, as she gained seniority and influence,
her once angry style grew more subdued, leading some
critics to say she had lost interest in her work.
But she minced no words yesterday in describing the Rea
gan administration as one "that is canceling the past 50 years
of human progress in America."
Fiercely independent — her autobiography was titled Un
houghtand Unbossed — Chisholm was in Washington only a
few weeks before she began loudly attacking the con
gressional leadership.
Aiming to "rattle the power structure," she sought the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1972. She entered a
number of presidential primaries, but drew less than 10 per
cent of the vote in every contest.
Following that campaign, she began to devote more time
to her congressional activities and less to maintaining a na
tional image. During this period she achieved a number of
legislative victories, including programs for disadvantaged
students and extension of the federal minimum wage to
domestic workers.
"Out of the political stranglehold and on my own terms,"
she said yesterday,"I will continue to fight the good fight. . .
making even louder appeals to the good sense and cons
cience of the American people."
