Salvadoran government claims control
San Salvador, El Salvador â€” El Salvador's defense minister claimed
yesterday that his forces have the upper hand against leftist guerrillas,
and a military source said the army has launched a major campaign
against the rebels in the southeastern part of the country.
Minister Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia denied news reports that the
guerrillas control territory or are able to move freely in large parts of the
country.
"The armed forces absolutely control all the national territory," he
said, claiming the guerrilla reports were part of a propaganda campaign
to undermine the credibility of the U.S.-supported junta abroad.
On Wednesday, counter-insurgency troops launched a sweep
through large parts of Usulutan province, 81 miles southeast of the capi
tal, where the guerrillas maintain a number of secret strongholds, a mili
tary source said.
The source, who asked anonymity for security reasons, identified the
soldiers as members of the army's crack Atlacatl and Atonatl battalions.
Residents of Usulutan City, the provincial capital, said they saw 18
trucks loaded with troops pass through during the night, apparently
heading for the town of juacaran.
A Defense Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the Usulutan
operation, but said "the army constantly undertakes actions" to find
and destroy enemy strongholds.
El Salvador's Human Rights Commission estimates that 32,000 civilians
have been killed in the 27-month civil war between government troops
and leftist guerrillas.
The guerrillas have been either unwilling or unable to occupy towns
or villages for long periods. Instead, they have engaged in hit-and-run
raids against selected targets.
Last week, the guerrillas started switching their attacks from the coun
tryside to urban centers. They burned more than 55 buses in San
Salvador and two other cities.
