# Unknown Card beats SDS

### Sally jenkins 
It was a mostly anonymous bunch
of guys who whipped up on San Die
go State at the Stanford tennis stadi
um yesterday. And you could certain
ly tell who the San Diego State guys
were by the end of the day, even if
you still had no clue as to the home
town boys. The southerners were the
ones with the quivering chins.
The Cardinal tennis players, who
should probably be referred to from
now on as "The Racers X," carved up
the southern visitors in the time it
takes Zorro to do his Z routine with
the gloved hand.
Stanford swept all but one of the
six starting singles spots, and two of
three doubles matches. Funny thing
is, the guys that did it for these hal
lowed halls are the ones who were

playing in the parking lot last season.
Only a small core of last year's
NCAA championship team remains,
and they have had to take their places
in the top three singles spots.
Sophomore Scott Davis moved the
shortest and least surprising distance,
from No. 2 to No. 1. He replaces Tim
Mayotte, who turned professional at
the end of last season.
At the No. 2 spot this season is sen
ior Scott Bondurant, who moved all
the way from his No 5 slot last year.
Playing at No. 3 is junior Jeff Arons —
the only Cardinal to lose yesterday —
who head coach Dick Gould brought
all the way from No. 6last yeartotake
the place of Jim Gurfein, also de
parted for the professional circuit.
But the rumor that Stanford

doesn't have much in the way of a
tennis team this season will most like
ly be disproved by the fellows on the
bottom half of the roster. The rumor
that Gould always comes up with
something appears more likely. It
seems that he did some scrapping
around, and came up with a few sur
prises. Senior John Corse is playing
No. 4, his first starting position in his
career on the team. At No. 5 is a
freshman recruit, Paul Robinson, and
at No. 6 is Mark McKeen, a
sophomore transfer from Los Altos.
Throw in a junior tranfer from Menlo
College named Jeremy Semple, and
what you have is a squad that is liable
to take off like the Space Shuttle Co
lumbia by mid-season.
