## Cardinal winning for themselves now 
### Mike Oneal 
It's hard to figure how things could
be much worse for the Cardinal
basketball team.
Stanford is holding fast at the bot
tom of the Pacific-10 Conference,
having won only two league games
this season, the Cardinal lost its coach
of seven years, Dick Dißiaso, to re
tirement a week ago, Oregon State
devastated Stanford 111-81 Saturday
and Washington and Washington
State, ranked first and fifth in the
Pac-10 respectively, are in town this
weekend.
Besides all this, there is a general
feeling around campus that it was all
inevitable, that like an alcoholic the
Cardinal had to bottom out some
time soon. Even Mark Wilson, the
mind behind the Daily comic strip
Gradepoint, has gone on a vicious
roll against the team this week.
Now that's the stuff of nightmares.
After years of decline and a season
of unlucky circumstances (foremost
ot which was the loss of sparkplug
guard Keith Jones after he was ruled
academically ineligible), Stanford
decided to reshuffle its men's basket
ball program. Dißiaso won't leave

until the end of the season, but the
scar is there. It's a matter of overcom
ing the stigma of "loser." Stanford
basketball has lived with it fora long
time, but this year's losing effort and
Dißiaso's resignation have
punctuated the übiquitious notion
that things have to change some
where if Stanford is to compete ade
quately in the Pac-10.
Senior guard Doug Marty, who has
armored himself against the team's
reputation for four years, had this to
say about the program's hard times:
"I'm too close to it now to analyze
the whole scope of the season, but
we came in here freshman year and
definitely expected to change things.
I his year we were supposed to finish
much better — we thought we had a
chance fora playoff berth. This end
ing (Dißiaso resigning) sort of says it
didn't work out. It's kind of symbolic
of my four years here."
But Marty added, "It's not like we
haven't been down before," and that
is i r rtainly true.
At this same point in the schedule,
the 1979-80 season saw Stanford in a
similar predicament to the one

they're in right now. That team, led
by All-America Kimberly Belton, slid
into an eight game losing streak in
the middle of the season and cries
were heard everywhere for Dißiaso's
job.
But magically, the team turned
itself around, pulled off four upsets
and finished in a three-way tie for
seventh place in the conference.
Forward Brian Welch, now a sen
ior, said at the time, "Maybe next
year we can do something. This year
we just want to go out and knock
somebody off."
Marty echoed Welch yesterday.
"Sure it's disappointing, but with
seven games left, we just want to play
as good as ever. It's not a 'win it for
the coach' situation at all. It's just that
we don't have anything to lose.
"In a way, I think it's kind of a relief
to the team to have the pressure
taken off. Nobody expects us to do
anything right now. We'll still play
the best we can because there's more
to it than just winning and losing. I
think it's a relief to coach Dißiaso too.
He has nothing to lose now either.
He still wants to win, but he doesn't
have how we do this season hanging

over his head anymore."
If Stanford is to have any edge at all
this weekend, the underdog posture
would be it. The Cardinal just wants
to knock somebody off.
Now at 7-13 in the Pac-10, Stanford
faces Washington State (6-s)tonight
at 8 p.m. and conference co-leader
Washington (10-1) Saturday night,
also at 8 p.m. Washington is tied with
Oregon State on the Pac-10 top rung.
The Cougars beat Stanford in
Pullman last month 63-58, but that
score is deceiving. The Cardinal put
on one of its better efforts of the year
that night and almost gave WSU its
fifth overtime game in a row. Wash
ington State is a strong, if inconsis
tent, team, however, and should beat
Stanford tonight.
The reason why is a defense which
yeilds only 59.6 points per game and
an offense led by forward Steve Har
riel (12.1 ppg, 4.4 reb.) and University
of San Francisco transfer Guy Wil
liams (12.0, 5.3). Williams, who is ex
tremely smooth and talented, sparks
the team simply by his enthusiasm
and should be hard for the Cardinal
to stop.

itself around, pulled off four upsets
and finished in a three-way tie for
seventh place in the conference.
Forward Brian Welch, now a sen
ior, said at the time, "Maybe next
year we can do something. This year
we just want to go out and knock
somebody off."
Marty echoed Welch yesterday.
"Sure it's disappointing, but with
seven games left, we just want to play
as good as ever. It's not a 'win it for
the coach' situation at all. It's just that
we don't have anything to lose.
"In a way, I think it's kind of a relief
to the team to have the pressure
taken off. Nobody expects us to do
anything right now. We'll still play
the best we can because there's more
to it than just winning and losing. I
think it's a relief to coach Dißiaso too.
He has nothing to lose now either.
He still wants to win, but he doesn't
have how we do this season hanging

over his head anymore."
If Stanford is to have any edge at all
this weekend, the underdog posture
would be it. The Cardinal just wants
to knock somebody off.
Now at 7-13 in the Pac-10, Stanford
faces Washington State (6-s)tonight
at 8 p.m. and conference co-leader
Washington (10-1) Saturday night,
also at 8 p.m. Washington is tied with
Oregon State on the Pac-10 top rung.
The Cougars beat Stanford in
Pullman last month 63-58, but that
score is deceiving. The Cardinal put
on one of its better efforts of the year
that night and almost gave WSU its
fifth overtime game in a row. Wash
ington State is a strong, if inconsis
tent, team, however, and should beat
Stanford tonight.
The reason why is a defense which
yeilds only 59.6 points per game and
an offense led by forward Steve Har
riel (12.1 ppg, 4.4 reb.) and University
of San Francisco transfer Guy Wil
liams (12.0, 5.3). Williams, who is ex
tremely smooth and talented, sparks
the team simply by his enthusiasm
and should be hard for the Cardinal
to stop.
It's hard to figure how things could
be much worse for the Cardinal
basketball team.
Stanford is holding fast at the bot
tom of the Pacific-10 Conference,
having won only two league games
this season, the Cardinal lost its coach
of seven years, Dick Dißiaso, to re
tirement a week ago, Oregon State
devastated Stanford 111-81 Saturday
and Washington and Washington
State, ranked first and fifth in the
Pac-10 respectively, are in town this
weekend.
Besides all this, there is a general
feeling around campus that it was all
inevitable, that like an alcoholic the
Cardinal had to bottom out some
time soon. Even Mark Wilson, the
mind behind the Daily comic strip
Gradepoint, has gone on a vicious
roll against the team this week.
Now that's the stuff of nightmares.
After years of decline and a season
of unlucky circumstances (foremost
ot which was the loss of sparkplug
guard Keith Jones after he was ruled
academically ineligible), Stanford
decided to reshuffle its men's basket
ball program. Dißiaso won't leave

until the end of the season, but the
scar is there. It's a matter of overcom
ing the stigma of "loser." Stanford
basketball has lived with it fora long
time, but this year's losing effort and
Dißiaso's resignation have
punctuated the übiquitious notion
that things have to change some
where if Stanford is to compete ade
quately in the Pac-10.
Senior guard Doug Marty, who has
armored himself against the team's
reputation for four years, had this to
say about the program's hard times:
"I'm too close to it now to analyze
the whole scope of the season, but
we came in here freshman year and
definitely expected to change things.
I his year we were supposed to finish
much better — we thought we had a
chance fora playoff berth. This end
ing (Dißiaso resigning) sort of says it
didn't work out. It's kind of symbolic
of my four years here."
But Marty added, "It's not like we
haven't been down before," and that
is i r rtainly true.
At this same point in the schedule,
the 1979-80 season saw Stanford in a
similar predicament to the one

they're in right now. That team, led
by All-America Kimberly Belton, slid
into an eight game losing streak in
the middle of the season and cries
were heard everywhere for Dißiaso's
job.
But magically, the team turned
itself around, pulled off four upsets
and finished in a three-way tie for
seventh place in the conference.
