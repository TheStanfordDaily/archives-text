# Card nine cruises past Hayward
## 
### Adam Berns 
The Stanford baseball team,
cold in its precision, defeated
the Cal State Hayward Pioneers
7-1 on Wednesday in a game
which was never close.
The most promising thing
about the game was the
pitching of Brian Myers. In his
last outing, Myers did not pitch
well and had a 9.95 earned run
average going into the game.
In Wednesday's contest,
Myers pitched the entire game,
giving up six hits and striking
out nine batters.
"I think Brian pitched very
well today," Stanford coach
Mark Marquess said following
the contest. "He pitched a su
per game.
"The last time out he didn't
have the rhythm. He had the
rhythm today. You could tell
that."
However, the Cardinal's de
cisive victory over the Pioneers
had to be kept in perspective.
Hayward had only a 1-4 record
going into the game.
"I still don't think that we are
close to doing what we can of
fensively," Marquess said

about his team's hitting. "We
have to swing the bat a lot bet
ter."
While Marquess has been
somewhat disappointed by his
team's hitting, he has been very
pleased with its defense.
Marquess said that he feels
good defense is especially im
portant at this point in the sea
son because it is something
which you can count on. With
hitting, if you face a good
pitcher it can leave you, but the
defense is always there.
Wednesday, the Cardinal
went to work early,scoring in
the bottom of the first inning.
Mike Aldretti reached first
on a base hit. He then went to
third on an attempted pickoff
play when pitcher Dave Cun
dari threw the ball by the first
baseman. Outfielder Mike
Toothman and catcher Bob
Hauslatin walked to fill the
bases and infielder Loring
Davies drove in a run on an in
field grounder.
In the second inning, short
stop Bob DeCosta walked. Af
ter pinchhitter Eric Hardgrave
grounded out, DeCosta scored

on a wild pitch. This gave Stan
ford a 2-0 lead and that was all
they needed to overcome the
Pioneers.
The Cardinal scored another
run in the third inning when
catcher Bob Hauslatin drilled a
base hit into right field to score
outfielder Mike Toothman.
The Pioneers struck right
back in the fourth inning to
score their only run of the
game. Outfielder Roger
Gallardo singled off Myers. He
reached second on a fielers
choice and scored when out
fielder John Gouveia singled
him home.
Stanford didn't score again
until the fifth inning.
After the Pioneers brought
in reliever Brian Pennebaker
for starter Dave Cundari,
Toothman got things started by
doubling to deep left-center
field. He movedtothird follow
ing a fielders choice by
Hauslatin. Infielder Loring
Davies was then hit by a pitch
putting runners on first and
third. Pennebaker then threw
two successive wild pitches
scoring Toothman from third

base and moving Davies to
third. A base hit by renter
fielder Darryl Stephens scored
Davies, giving the team's
Cardinal a 5-1 lead.
Stanford scored in the sixth
inning when infielder Vince
Sakowski bunted his way on,
stole second, went to third on
an infield grounder by second
baseman Steve Buechelle.
Sakowski then scored on a sac
rifice fly by Aldretti.
In the seventh inning, the
Cardinal scored again.
Hauslatin singled and out
fielder Scott Warner went in to
run for him. Warner stole sec
ond scored on a single by Ste
phens.
This weekend Stanford plays
the San Jose State Spartans.
"They are capable of playing
well," Marquess said about San
Jose State. "They played us well
last year and beat us in two of
the four games we played.
The first game of the series
will be at 2:30 today at Stan
ford's Sunken Diamond.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal will
play two games at San Jose
State.
