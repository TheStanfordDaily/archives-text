Women's swimming
Tomorrow's swim meet against California at de-
Guerre pool will be primarily one in which the
Cardinal hopes to qualify more swimmers for next
month's NCAA Championships.
Stanford handily beat the Bears twice this sea
son, once in a November dual meet (109-40) and
once in the NorCal Championships (1244.5-1059).
"We're using it (the meet) mostly to qualify both
teams for the NCAAs, so we're swimming just
about every event," Stanford coach George
Haines said.
Cal swimmers should challenge their Cardinal
counterparts in the 50-yard breastroke and 100-
yard butterfly competitions.
Stanford hopes to rebound from last week's
63-50 loss to defending AIAW champion Texas and
boost its record to 10-1 with a win over the Bears.
The dual meet, slated to begin at 11:00 a.m., is
the Cardinal's final of the season, with just the
Stanford Women's Invitational standing between
them and the NCAA Championships.

Gymnastics
Stanford men's and women's gymnastics teams
take to the road this weekend with the No. 18
Cardinal women pitted against UC Davis, and
Sadao Hamada's men'sieam battling San Jose State
and California at San Jose's Spartan Gym. Both
competitions are scheduled for 7:30 Saturday eve
ning.
Hamada's men are coming off a strong per
formance last week, where they placed second in a
tri-meet against Cal State Fullerton and Cal State
Long Beach. The men set team records in rings and
vault, and expect to better those marks tomorrow.
Coach Jackie Walker's women are returning
from an impressive tri-meet victory over USC and
Oregon in which sophomore All-America Merilyn
Chapman set a school record with a 9.55 per
formance on the bars.
The Cardinal team set a new team standard in
that event with a 36.50 mark, and the total team
score was the second best in the history of the
women's program.

Women's basketball
The Stanford Women's basketball team takes on
the hard-fighting Santa Clara Broncos Saturday at
5:45 in Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal squeeked by Santa Clara 73-70
earlier in the season, but the Broncos are coming
off an unexpected win over San Jose State, one of
the Northern California Athletic Conference lead
ers.
Despite Stanford's Tuesday night 96-65 loss to
California, head coach Dotty McCrea is not wor
ried about her team's spirit. '"'This team has tre
mendous character," she commented.
A great boost to her team will come with the re
turn of high-scoring center Louise Smith, who has
been fighting mononucleosis. With the team's top
three scorers — Meg Metzger, Jeanne Ruark Hoff,
and Smith — back together, things look bright for
the Cardinal.
