## Got the midnight munchies? Try these night spots... Luv's Menlo House 
### 
We tried to hurry, but the flats just wouldn't
go down right; there was a headline to rewrite
and somebody spilled taco sauce on a picture.
We were shooting for midnight, really we were,
but on this night the big publisher in the sky had
already decided our time out would be late.
Even Mary Rose "Roll those puppies" Warner
couldn't speed things up. But there was one
consolation: we knew we were going to LUV's.
Production nights at the Daily — Sunday
through Thursday — are typically filled with
deadline pressure and a lot of hard work. By the
time we put the paper to bed around 1:30 or 2
a.m., the corps of diehards who've had to cope
with the above-mentioned problems all night is
pretty keyed up — and hungry.
While in the past going out to breakfast wasan
outing reserved for only the latest of nights, this
year the gang has started going on a more regu
lar basis, all because of our discovery of Luv's
Menlo House. A few miles up the road on El
Camino, Luv's offers the kind of selection which
seems to offer something for nearly everyone
who gets hungry from midnight on; it's open all
night, and up to 2 a.m. you can even get a glass of
wine or a beer. Now as if those alcoholic entice
ments weren't enough incentive to get done
with the paper early, Luv's also features a night
crew with the late night customertemperament.
Our favorite is Helen, a jovial waitress who
works the graveyard shift and first endeared
herself to us the night she rousted some fellow
patrons who had wandered out from a local

drinking establishment and seemed bent on
making the "typical Stanford student crowd" we
seemed to represent justify its existence.
When we go, we just give Helen a wave and
start requesting the "usuals" — a turkey sand
wich here (with cranberry sauce, don't forget to
remind the chef, Helen. "Oh, don't worry, he's
pretty good about that, " she always replies), a
Monte Cristo there, a dinner salad with bleu
cheese for the two faces, extra sour cream on
Richard's burger. No need to go on, I guess, but
if you ever order "the usual" vou might get one
of ours, so beware.
One of our favorite parts about the place is the
other patrons. One night two slightly inebriated
gentlemen began giving us awards — saltines in
plastic packages, salt and pepper. Another night,
we nearly lost one of the production folks when
a counter diner tried to make her an offer she
couldn't refuse. It's quite an experience.
For some reason, all of us never seem to have
enough moeny to pay for our own meal on any
given night, but for the more responsible among
you, a burger and beverage or an omelette and a
cup of coffeee or a similar combination usually
brings a charge somewhere in the $4-5 range.
Some the breakfast specials are a little
cheaper. I doubt it's one of the cheaper places
for midnight munchies, but we like the people.
Plus, they put a "Defenders" game in the lobby
— it gives us a chance to test out the validity of
some of Mark Wilson's cartoons.
