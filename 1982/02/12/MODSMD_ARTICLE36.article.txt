# The
						Coffee House
## 
### 
Every university needs a
few places everyone can de
pend on. The Coffee House
is one of those places.
But late on weekend
nights, when the professors,
staff, locals and high school
kids go home, the Coffee
House changes its complex
ion.
The band plays, drinks
pour, students fill every spot
of floorspace and drape
themselves over every piece
of furniture. The air's a little
too smoky, the music's a lit
tle too loud, the tables are a
little too dirty and the prices
are still a little too high. In
short, it's perfect.
Wear jeans and your fa
vorite shirt. Order a
croissant (70-90 cents) or a
cookie (50 cents) or a piece
of carrot cake (90 cents). To
drink, try hot chocolate (90
cents), a beer ($1 2! or a
fancy coffee drink (75 cents-
Si.Bs) Look for someone
you know behind the coun
ter (the Coffee House em
ploys more than 100 stu
dents).

Then, gather your food
and your friends about you
and search fora seat. Smok
ing? Nonsmoking? Near the
band? Forget it: take the
first empty spots vou find.
Two Friday nights ago, we
couldn't find any place to
sit. So we took our coffees
of-the-days (as good at
night as they are in the day
time) and went to sit out
side, just as Dink disgorged
the crowd from the Lively
Arts' Julliard Quartet con
cert. Most went directly to
their cars, but a few middle
aged couples walked
toward the Coffee House.
"Let's get a little some
thing," I heard one say as
they approached the door.
They went in, looked
around, heard"Field Effect"
play a few bars, and walked
right out again.
They were right, of
course, to leave. We stu
dents share our Coffee
House every day, but after 9
p.m. on weekends, it's ours
alone. We depend on it.
