# Lyon's
## 
### 
It you're looking for an all
night restaurant that will please
your palate and pocketbook
alike, you need search no
further than Lyon's on 4298 El
Camino Real in Los Altos.
Upon first inspection, Lyon's
would appear to share a lot of
characteristics with your aver
age Howard Johnson's. But first
inspections are sometimes mis
leading. The offerings may be
similar to those of the blue and
orange, but the quality at
Lyon's is far better.
In terms of decor, Lyon's is
surprisingly warm and com
fortable. If you like relaxed
seating, I think you'll find the
arc-shaped booths more than
acceptable. The lighting is a
pleasant compromise: you can
see your food, but you don't
need sunglasses to fight the
glare. Furthermore, the air
circulates exceptionally well so
that even in the smoking sec
tion, one needn't worry about
premature emphysema.
Since the standard of com
parison for any after-midnight
restaurant is that wonderful
American concoction called
the hamburger, let me say a

word or two about the so
called Lyonburger. There are
12 different combinations
ranging in price from the plain
and simple Lyonburger
(ground beef with shredded
lettuce, Thousand Island dress
ing, tomato and pickle) at $2.35
to the Mighty Lyon (half a
pound of ground selected
beef, "broiled to your desire"
and served with above items as
well as a French roll, french
fries and tossed green salad) at
$4.35.
The basic Lyonburger I
sampled recently tasted fresh
enough and the quality of the
meat seemed above average,
but the meat temperature was
barely above lukewarm.
Where Lyon's really shines is
in the ice cream department.
The "Big Old Time" milkshake
is thick and rich, and fora buck
seventy-five you get about
three glasses' worth of liquid
refreshment. The hot fudge
sundae at $1.95 is likewise a
tempting, tongue-pleasing
treat.
Lyon's other strong suit is its
diverse and well-prepared
breakfast menu. What could be
more heavenly than a Belgian
Waffle to cap off a long night of
term paper research? Don't an
swer that question! Truth be
told, the waffles are just as they
are described on the menu: "a
crisp, light and extra-thick
temptation." When accom
panied by a few slices of Lyon's
sizzling bacon strips and a tall
glass of pure orange juice, the
combination positively exudes
country freshness. All forabout
$4.50.
For those who really want to
"pig out," Lyon's offers com
plete dinners which include
choice of soup or salad, vegeta
ble, beverage and dessert at an
exceedingly moderate cost.
The top sirloin steak complete
dinner is just $8.25.
So no matter what the hour,
Lyon's restaurant boasts a lion's
share of good "munch" eating.
Don't let that 2 a.m. ice cream
sundae pang go unsatisfied —
go to Lyon's!
