# Denny's

### 
Denny's. The name con
jures up the sort of images
most people associate with
such 24-hour estab
lishments: vinyl-covered
seats, laminated menus, all
culminating in hastily-pre
pared and sub-par food.
Unfortunately, the first
two ring true even for Den
ny's, but the third doesn't;
indeed, the fare here is very
appetizing, reasonably
priced and may offer the
perfect way to rid youself of
those ''midnight
munchies."
Inside the doors, we
were greeted by a charming
waitress — and also by a
blaze of orange and pink in
the form of the aforemen
tioned upholstery.
For some reason, these
two colors dominate the en
tire decor. (I read some
where once about police us
ing pink holding tanks to
calm down violent criminal
suspects — maybe that's it.
Generally though, the clien
tele seemed pretty respect
able.)
Eager to stray from the
normal hamburger cuisine,
I had ordered the "Beef
adelphia Sandwich." Den
ny's bills this concoction as
their "own version of the
Philadelphia cheese-steak."
I've never hadoneof theor
iginals so I can't vouch for
the similarity, but what ar
rived on my plate was quite
good — grilled beef topped
with mozzarella cheese
(looking decidedly proc
essed, however), and all on
a soft french sesame roll.
(Sort of akin to Jack-in-the-
Box's "Beef and Cheese Su
preme," if you'll pardon the
comparison.)

The "Beef-adelphia"
costs $3.45 — accompanied
by french fries, it's more
than reasonable. Most items
in its category of "Specialty
Sandwiches" run about the
same price; only the Steak
Sandwich costs more than
four bucks.
Ihe only real complaint
we had regarded the french
fries. Both our plates were
blessed with an abnormally
large amount of them, but it
seemed, unfortunately, that
quality had been somewhat
sacrificed for the sake of
quantity. They were
positively undercooked,
and slightly more greasy
than we had anticipated. In
a way, their vast numbers
made up for what they
lacked otherwise, and they
were palatable if disappoint
ing.
Our waitress was
courteous and friendly, and
made periodic (though not
too frequent) trips to our
table to pour fresh coffee
and to check that ev
erything was fine.
As for the atmosphere:
well, I've already spoken for
the decor; the music being
piped in above us consisted
of nameless songs, the titles
of which my dining parner
was convinced all began
with "The Theme to "
We ate at close to mid
night, and the restaurant
was quiet, but not deserted.
Our waitress told us that the
students come in to study
quite frequently: "We give
them the back room," she
said. That and the free cof
fee refills seem to make
Denny's ideal as a place for
occasional light homework.
