F When the problem sets are
finally all finished and tomor
row's midterm has bedtime
looking more and more like 6
a.rri, ,jt;V no wonder you're
reat^ r {pr,anpthercound of din
ner at midnight. A new day de
serves'a fall stomach, even if
the choices are a bit slim.
This isn't the day for home
delivered pizza. You need to
get away, take as much of a
break as you can spare. You
need a change of atmosphere.
You need ... a Jack run!!
We didn't ask for anything
too elaborate: a couple Jumbo

Jacks, fries, onion rings for the
lady, and a taco just to be
creative (they said we were two
years late fora burrito). All that
and change back from our $5.
Make that her $5, I did call it
dinner, and she did owe me a
dinner and . . .
Was it worth the wait? Well,
we didn't really notice the
grease stain on the bottom of
the bag until we'd emptied it.
At that hour, you can't expect
Trader Vic's. It carried me
through the midterm, anyway.
