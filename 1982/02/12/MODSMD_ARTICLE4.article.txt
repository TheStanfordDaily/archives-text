# Professor lectures on intimacy in marriages
## 
### Kathy Christie 
The nature of intimacy can be
taken to two opposite poles of de
pendence in our culture, but in a
marriage it is proper to have a bal
ance between the two.
That's the view of Sociology Prof.
Jerry Talley, who gave a talk here yes
terday titled "Love or Marriage: Pick
Only One?"
Our culture, said Talley, gives us
two different models for intimacy:
the "traditional" and the "modern."
He defined the "traditional"
model as one where "intimacy is
forged ... in a committed, long-term
relationship." There is a great "stress
on interdependence" and a "com
mitment to each other, or to the rela
tionship." This is true to such an ex

tent that separation or divorce will
invalidate the total relationship.
He noted that the traditional rela
tionship is often thought of in busi
ness terms, such as"investing, expec
ting returns, contracts." He also said
that when those "contracts" are bro
ken, the two parties may argue in
court over thematter.
Intimacy in the "modern" model
"is explored ... in self-contained ex
periences." Here the stress is on "in
dependence, honesty, courage of
expression, spontaneity." In the
future orientation of the "modern"
relationship it could be accepted that
"today you could be into
monogamy, tomorrow you could be
into candles."
