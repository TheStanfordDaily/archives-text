# Hunger on the graveyard shift
## Winchell's Donut House 
### 
When my stomach starts growling around
midnight, I don't crave those heavy sit-down
meals. What I like are the light, snacky items that
can be consumed in small quantities. That's why,
as the late hours crept in Monday night and our
pens wearied upon our papers, three of us
headed straight down El Camino for Winchell's
Donut House.
For only nine miles worth of gas and a handful
of change, we managed to appease our ap
petites as well as those of Alpha Sigites lingering
in the kitchen when we returned. Although we
unanimously agreed the food didn't top our list
of favorites, it did provide a perfect study break,
in terms of quantity and time.
The biggest drawback of a late night
Winchell's run is their lack of selection. We had
our choice of 14 different pastries, but this array
looked meager among the empty stacks of trays.
Some of our favorites (chocolate eclairs and ap
ple fritters) were missing, but we took great de
light in a few of our samplings.
Among the tastiest was the blueberry cof
feecake (a new item), the old-fashioned glazed,
and the cinnamon doughnut holes. These tasted

particularily fresh, unlike some of the other deli
cacies, such as the frosted brownie and the
cheesecake (both new additions also). Account
ing for this freshness could be that the
doughnuts are all made right in Winchell's
"backshop" while the cake-type goods are
baked elsewhere and brought in.
We also sampled the standard chocolate-cov
ered, powder-sugared, and confetti-sprinkled
doughnuts. They weren't bad, but have proba
bly seen their better days.
According to a Winchell's employee, fresh
doughnuts are brought out around 2 or 3
a.m. to comply with early morning "rush hour".
He also said there's more selection on weekend
nights because of the higher demand.
Winchell's offers a pleasant, bright, clean at
mosphere with seating for 24. The workers were
friendly; the service, quick.
For quality, I would suggest Winchell's during
the daytime. For satisfaction and a light snack,
Winchell's at night does the trick.
Winchell's is open 24 hours, seven days a
week.
