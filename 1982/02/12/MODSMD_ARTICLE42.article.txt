# 7-11
## 
### 
"The most important
thing," I told Jim, " is to
maintain control." As I said
this, I executed a precise
four-wheel drift into to the
7-11's parking lot. Un
fortunately, a small, unex
pected grease spot threw off
my calculations, and we
drifted an extra foot into a
Subaru. Fortunately, I was
driving Jim's car. Jim was not
maintaining control — he
was staring blankly down at
his hands and giggling.
I informed Jim that we
had arrived. It was 2 a.m.
and we were totally pre
pared to review the 7-11.
We had our allocated $5,
but more importantly, we
had the proper attitude: we
were hungry — starving, in
fact. Ready to eat the seat
cushions. Mondo
munchies.
As we approached the
store, a chill of awe ran
down my spine. The 7-11
was more than just a store; it
was representative of just
about every kind of store in
existence. At a 7-11 you can
get a small quantity of
almost anything you want,
all packaged in the more ex
pensive "convenience"
sizes (the "small, wasteful"
size as opposed to the large
"economy" size). It even
represented restaurants be
cause you can get the
cashier to pour a "Big Gulp"
for you. And since every
type of person eventually
comes through the 7-11,
you realize that it is, in fact, a
microcosm of the entire
modern American con
sumer society!
This all seemed terribly
important to me at the time,
and I told that tothe cashier.
He nodded, and he under
stood; he pointed me to the
munchies.
But Jim and I remem
bered we were on a mission
to review the whole store,
so we decided to wander.

As we passed an im
pressive collection of sand
wiches, laundry detergent,
cold remedies, playing «
cards and soy sauce, we re
alized we were going to
have to apply some logic to
our selection process. We
quickly ruled out motor oil,
Vaseline Intensive Care Lo
tion, Sweet Dawn of Desire
(no, they don't sell proph
ylactics), and aluminum foil
as being inedible. Similarly,
we crossed off dry spaghetti,
Turkish taffy, and frozen
dinners as being too imprac
tical and/or frustrating to
eat (although Jim did have a
strange desire to roast a tur
key). We settled our plans
along the lines of some
crackers, Muenster cheese,
a six of 7-up, and maybe a
Milky Way bar or two. But
then we thought better of it
and decided to invest our
whole $5 in cookies.
Unfortunately, there was
an entire aisle of cookies.
We quickly realized our
mistake, but it was too late.
And we weren't the only
ones. Standing in front of
the wide assortment of Pep
peridge Farm cookies was a
pitiful and confused-look
ing character. He said his
name was Joe and he had
been there salivating for
either two hours or two
days; he wasn't sure which.
We were in trouble. Seri
ous trouble. Desperately I
closed my eyes, grabbed,
and found myself holding $5
of Famous Amos chocolate
chip cookies. I ran to the
checkout line, dragging Jim
behind.
As we squealed out of the
parking lot, Jim tore open
the bags. The last thing I re
member is polishing off our
third bag of cookies. Then
Jim said to me through an
extremely dry, cotton
mouth, "Hey man, how'd I
eat all that stuff?!"

type of person eventually
comes through the 7-11,
you realize that it is, in fact, a
microcosm of the entire
modern American con
sumer society!
This all seemed terribly
important to me at the time,
and I told that tothe cashier.
He nodded, and he under
stood; he pointed me to the
munchies.
But Jim and I remem
bered we were on a mission
to review the whole store,
so we decided to wander.

As we passed an im
pressive collection of sand
wiches, laundry detergent,
cold remedies, playing «
cards and soy sauce, we re
alized we were going to
have to apply some logic to
our selection process. We
quickly ruled out motor oil,
Vaseline Intensive Care Lo
tion, Sweet Dawn of Desire
(no, they don't sell proph
ylactics), and aluminum foil
as being inedible. Similarly,
we crossed off dry spaghetti,
Turkish taffy, and frozen
dinners as being too imprac
tical and/or frustrating to
eat (although Jim did have a
strange desire to roast a tur
key). We settled our plans
along the lines of some
crackers, Muenster cheese,
a six of 7-up, and maybe a
Milky Way bar or two. But
then we thought better of it
and decided to invest our
whole $5 in cookies.
Unfortunately, there was
an entire aisle of cookies.
We quickly realized our
mistake, but it was too late.
And we weren't the only
ones. Standing in front of
the wide assortment of Pep
peridge Farm cookies was a
pitiful and confused-look
ing character. He said his
name was Joe and he had
been there salivating for
either two hours or two
days; he wasn't sure which.
We were in trouble. Seri
ous trouble. Desperately I
closed my eyes, grabbed,
and found myself holding $5
of Famous Amos chocolate
chip cookies. I ran to the
checkout line, dragging Jim
behind.
As we squealed out of the
parking lot, Jim tore open
the bags. The last thing I re
member is polishing off our
third bag of cookies. Then
Jim said to me through an
extremely dry, cotton
mouth, "Hey man, how'd I
eat all that stuff?!"
