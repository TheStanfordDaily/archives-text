On Golden Pond *
Park, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who managesto retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.
— Steve Vineberg
Ordinary People ★★
Fox, Redwood City
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truthsabouteach other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
a family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life

right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.
Double-billed tonight and
tomorrow with Kramer vs.
Kramer. These two movies are
also double billed next Thursday
and Friday at the New Varsity,
Palo Alto.
— Ron Lillejord
Dial M For Murder **★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star in this Alfred Hitchcock
thriller from the '50s. She plays
the not-so-innocent wife (she's
having an affair with Robert
Cummings). He plays the hus
band who realizes that his wife's
affections — and fortune — may
be turning elsewhere, and who
also realizes that a well-planned
murder might be the perfect
solution.
This is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts It was filmed in under a
month and adheres very closely
to the stage play. But the play, by
Frederick Knott, is very clever,
the performances (especially by
John Williams, who plays the
Scotland Yard Inspector in
charge of the case) enjoyable,
and the direction amazingly fluid
in what is essentially a one-set
movie. Filmed in the unstable
Warnercolor, so the colors have
drifted toward the pinks and yel
lows.
Plays through Wednesday with
another Hitchcock film, Stage
Fright.
— J.M.
A Clockwork Orange
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom

McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grislev ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.
— J.M.
Ghost Story ★
Belmont Theater, Belmont
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
vou begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.
— J.M.
Montenegro
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan Anspach stars in this
pointless Swedish production
about a frustrated housewife who
takes up with a band of free-lov
ing Yugoslavs who strive to show
her how life should really be
lived. She's too messed up to go
for it, and so's the movie. Mon
tenegro, in case you're wonder
ing, is the name of the Yugoslav
she has an affair with. No, I don't
know why they named the movie
after him. (For weeks I thought
this was a movie about a Carib
bean resort. It looks like I was
right, though — Montenegro is
the name of the place that movies
go when they die.)
— J.M.

Taps ★
Old Mill, Mountain) View
The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by itsstudonts to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writ ers shift gears
to manipulate our emotions.
With Timothy Hutto.n as the cadet
major who leads the move and
George C. Scott, who has never
been worse, as a halif-cracked old
general.
— S.V.

Whose Life is it Anyway? ★Vi
Guild, Menlo Park
Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadroplegic and
sues for the right to be allowed to
die. Richard Dreyfuss struggles
manfully with an impossible role
that he isn't really right for: he
isn't a physical enough actor to
suggest, in the pre-accident and
flashback dream sequences, that

the loss of his hands has really
rendered life useless for him.
- S.V.
Dressed to Kill
Saturday, Cubberley
The authors of a number of re
views of Dressed fo Kill have
claimed that they don't take issue
with director Brian DePalma's
"emulation" of Hitchcock. But
that is the issue — De Palma has
gone beyond mere emulation
into cinematic parasitism. The di
rector seems to think that our
memories are too short and our
palates too jaded to mind his rifl-

ing someone else's good ideas.
De Palma steals Hitchcock's plots
(this isn't the first time — Sisters,
like DTK', was a remake of Psycho,
Obssession replayed Vertigo)
without taking over any of the
master's wit or underlying moral
tensions. The result is a brittle,
empty thriller worn down to
nothing by its own stylistic con
ceits.
— J.M.
Time Bandits
Mountain View Theater
The Monty Python people
bring you something completely
different: a funny, by turns
charming and cynical fantasy
about a boy who inadvertently
gets caught up with the exploits
of six dwarfs who're out to
plunder the greatest treasures of
all time.The cdmera seldom raises
higher than about four-foot-one,
and maybe the air is richer down
there — this movie is faster and
more clever than any of the re
cent American fantasies popu
lated entirely by six-footers.
Double-billed with Raiders of
the Lost Ark.
— J.M.
Apocalypse Now ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius. Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking of
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb
cinematography of Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stun
ning imagesof Vietnam that com
bine frightening energy and in
tensity with humor, sensuality
and a vision of overwhelming
evil. The movie has almost un
tenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind. Star
ring Martin Sheen and Marlon
Brando.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Lord}im.

know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truthsabouteach other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
a family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life

right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.
Double-billed tonight and
tomorrow with Kramer vs.
Kramer. These two movies are
also double billed next Thursday
and Friday at the New Varsity,
Palo Alto.

Dial M For Murder **★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star in this Alfred Hitchcock
thriller from the '50s. She plays
the not-so-innocent wife (she's
having an affair with Robert
Cummings). He plays the hus
band who realizes that his wife's
affections — and fortune — may
be turning elsewhere, and who
also realizes that a well-planned
murder might be the perfect
solution.
This is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts It was filmed in under a
month and adheres very closely
to the stage play. But the play, by
Frederick Knott, is very clever,
the performances (especially by
John Williams, who plays the
Scotland Yard Inspector in
charge of the case) enjoyable,
and the direction amazingly fluid
in what is essentially a one-set
movie. Filmed in the unstable
Warnercolor, so the colors have
drifted toward the pinks and yel
lows.
Plays through Wednesday with
another Hitchcock film, Stage
Fright.

A Clockwork Orange
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom

McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grislev ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

Ghost Story ★
Belmont Theater, Belmont
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
vou begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.

Montenegro
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan Anspach stars in this
pointless Swedish production
about a frustrated housewife who
takes up with a band of free-lov
ing Yugoslavs who strive to show
her how life should really be
lived. She's too messed up to go
for it, and so's the movie. Mon
tenegro, in case you're wonder
ing, is the name of the Yugoslav
she has an affair with. No, I don't
know why they named the movie
after him. (For weeks I thought
this was a movie about a Carib

right, though — Montenegro is
the name of the place that movies
go when they die.)

The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by itsstudonts to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold

to manipulate our emotions.

Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadroplegic and
sues for the right to be allowed to
die. Richard Dreyfuss struggles
manfully with an impossible role
that he isn't really right for: he
isn't a physical enough actor to
suggest, in the pre-accident and
flashback dream sequences, that

the loss of his hands has really
rendered life useless for him.

Dressed to Kill
Saturday, Cubberley
The authors of a number of re
views of Dressed fo Kill have
claimed that they don't take issue
with director Brian DePalma's
"emulation" of Hitchcock. But
that is the issue — De Palma has
gone beyond mere emulation
into cinematic parasitism. The di
rector seems to think that our
memories are too short and our
palates too jaded to mind his rifl-

ing someone else's good ideas.
De Palma steals Hitchcock's plots
(this isn't the first time — Sisters,
like DTK', was a remake of Psycho,
Obssession replayed Vertigo)
without taking over any of the
master's wit or underlying moral
tensions. The result is a brittle,
empty thriller worn down to
nothing by its own stylistic con
ceits.

Apocalypse Now ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius. Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking of
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb
cinematography of Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stun
ning imagesof Vietnam that com
bine frightening energy and in
tensity with humor, sensuality
and a vision of overwhelming
evil. The movie has almost un
tenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind. Star
ring Martin Sheen and Marlon
Brando.
Plays Saturday and Sunday

movie. Filmed in the unstable
Warnercolor, so the colors have
drifted toward the pinks and yel
lows.
Plays through Wednesday with
another Hitchcock film, Stage

A Clockwork Orange
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom

McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grislev ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

Ghost Story ★
Belmont Theater, Belmont
Fred Astaire, John Houseman,
Melvyn Douglas and Douglas
Fairbanks Jr. play four old men
who are haunted by a ghost from
their past. It's all on a painfully lit
eral level: the ghost appears
sometimes as a death's head and
sometimes as an evilly beautiful
woman, and either way, she's
neither frightening nor interest
ing. The movie is so plodding that
vou begin to think something
very complicated has been set
up, but as the end credits roll you
realize that very little that hap
pens in the movie has much to do
with anything. And of the four
men, only Astaire manages to
capture something of his custom
ary style.

Montenegro
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
Susan Anspach stars in this
pointless Swedish production
about a frustrated housewife who
takes up with a band of free-lov
ing Yugoslavs who strive to show
her how life should really be
lived. She's too messed up to go
for it, and so's the movie. Mon
tenegro, in case you're wonder
ing, is the name of the Yugoslav
she has an affair with. No, I don't
know why they named the movie
after him. (For weeks I thought
this was a movie about a Carib
bean resort. It looks like I was
right, though — Montenegro is
the name of the place that movies
go when they die.)

Taps ★
Old Mill, Mountain) View
The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by itsstudonts to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writ ers shift gears
to manipulate our emotions.
With Timothy Hutto.n as the cadet
major who leads the move and
George C. Scott, who has never
been worse, as a halif-cracked old
general.

Whose Life is it Anyway? ★Vi
Guild, Menlo Park
Kenneth McMillan gives an ex
tremely intelligent, varied, low
key and even moving per
formance in the thankless role of
the judge in the last 20 minutes of
this otherwise hopeless movie,
based on Brian Clark's stage hit.
It's about a sculptor who survives
a horrendous car accident but
becomes a quadroplegic and
sues for the right to be allowed to
die. Richard Dreyfuss struggles
manfully with an impossible role
that he isn't really right for: he
isn't a physical enough actor to
suggest, in the pre-accident and
flashback dream sequences, that

the loss of his hands has really
rendered life useless for him.

Dressed to Kill
Saturday, Cubberley
The authors of a number of re
views of Dressed fo Kill have
claimed that they don't take issue
with director Brian DePalma's
"emulation" of Hitchcock. But
that is the issue — De Palma has
gone beyond mere emulation
into cinematic parasitism. The di
rector seems to think that our
memories are too short and our
palates too jaded to mind his rifl-

ing someone else's good ideas.
De Palma steals Hitchcock's plots
(this isn't the first time — Sisters,
like DTK', was a remake of Psycho,
Obssession replayed Vertigo)
without taking over any of the
master's wit or underlying moral
tensions. The result is a brittle,
empty thriller worn down to
nothing by its own stylistic con
ceits.

The Monty Python people
bring you something completely

about a boy who inadvertently
gets caught up with the exploits
of six dwarfs who're out to
plunder the greatest treasures of
all time.The cdmera seldom raises
higher than about four-foot-one,
and maybe the air is richer down
there — this movie is faster and
more clever than any of the re
cent American fantasies popu
lated entirely by six-footers.
Double-billed with Raiders of

Apocalypse Now ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
An extraordinary work of mad,
glorious genius. Writer-director
Francis Coppola's reworking of
Heart of Darkness takes Conrad's
essential narrative and structures
a journey into a physical hell; it's
likely to engross — horribly
fascinate — some, and turn away
others.
Aided by the superb
cinematography of Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stun
ning imagesof Vietnam that com
bine frightening energy and in
tensity with humor, sensuality
and a vision of overwhelming
evil. The movie has almost un
tenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic vision of mankind. Star
ring Martin Sheen and Marlon
Brando.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Lord}im.

Park, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who managesto retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.
— Steve Vineberg
Ordinary People ★★
Fox, Redwood City
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truthsabouteach other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
a family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life

right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.
Double-billed tonight and
tomorrow with Kramer vs.
Kramer. These two movies are
also double billed next Thursday
and Friday at the New Varsity,
Palo Alto.

Dial M For Murder **★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star in this Alfred Hitchcock
thriller from the '50s. She plays
the not-so-innocent wife (she's
having an affair with Robert
Cummings). He plays the hus
band who realizes that his wife's
affections — and fortune — may
be turning elsewhere, and who
also realizes that a well-planned
murder might be the perfect
solution.
This is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts It was filmed in under a
month and adheres very closely
to the stage play. But the play, by
Frederick Knott, is very clever,
the performances (especially by
John Williams, who plays the
Scotland Yard Inspector in
charge of the case) enjoyable,
and the direction amazingly fluid
in what is essentially a one-set
movie. Filmed in the unstable
Warnercolor, so the colors have
drifted toward the pinks and yel
