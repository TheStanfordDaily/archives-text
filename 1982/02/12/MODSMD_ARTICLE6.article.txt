# Sociology move opens additional office space
## 
### Anlhea Stratigos 
The University is preparing to al
locate the highly sought space which
will by the Sociology De
partment's relocation within the year
into the Quad.
Although the University has yet to
formulate future plans for the cluster
of houses near the Bridge, "There
will be a domino effect as far as space
allocation on campus is concerned,"
according to Max Mazenko, campus
planner.
Mariposa, Owens and Rogers
houses, located between Campus
Drive and the Law School, will be
vacated within a year by the depart
ment, leaving that office space avail
able.
The provost's office has already
been approached by hopeful inhabi
tants who say they are working under
cramped conditions. Such offices as
the Stanford Center for Chicano Re
search, the Financial Aids Office and
Overseas Studies are interested, said
Lynda Weisberg, assistant provost for
facilities.
Weisbergsaid the vacancy will pro
vide a rare opportunity to solve some
pressing space needs.

"At any one time, there is little ex
cess space," she said, adding that
when a department or research
project expands, there is often little
flexibility for adaptation.
At the Stanford Center for Chicano
Research, for example, workers say
that all conceivable space is used. A
storage area has been converted for
office use and offices are shared, ac
cording to Armando Valdez, as
sociate director of the center.
Since this much available space isa
rarity, Weisberg said she will evaluate
closely the needs of organizations
seeking to occupy the houses. She
said the issue is not necessarily a
budgetary concern, but that she will
look at the merits of the individual
programs, as well as the amount of
space needed and the constraints of
each building.
She said she will also consider the
relationships between departments,
adding that it is desirable for particu
lar departments which have more in
common to be geographically
grouped near each other.
Provost Albert Hastorf, after re-
viewing Weisberg's recommenda
tions, will announce his final decision
on the future of the houses in ap
proximately two months.
The houses are not being con
sidered for student residences. They
have never been used for that
purpose, according to Norman Rob
inson, associate dean for residential
education. Costly renovations would
be necessary and it would not be wise
to house students there because new
dormitories are already under con
struction, said Weisberg.
