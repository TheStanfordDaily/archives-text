# Prison overcrowding assailed
## Former inmate tells of prison horrors 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Through his words and actions,
Carlo Prescott related the horrible
reality of the 15 years he spent be
hind bars to an audience of 50 in the
Toyon lounge last night.
The former convict spoke in the
third meeting of the Toyon Criminal
justice series.
Although Prescott refused at times
to comply with the program format
established by moderator Eric
Wright, a lawprofessoratthe Univer
sity of Santa Clara, and Lieutenant
Mary Olley of the California Depart
ment of Corrections, the terror and
frustration he experienced in prison
came through clearly.
Prescott emotionally described
harsh treatment by guards, killings,
rapes and the anguish of being
locked up day after day with an in
terminable sentence. His voice rose
dramatically as he told of prisoners'
pleas for mercy from the sexual at
tacks of other prisoners.
"You're not the same for the first
seven years (following release from
prison) after all they've done to you,"
said Prescott.
Wright said that overcrowding in
prisons is a significant cause of in
carceration problems. According to
Wright, the number of attacks by

prisoners on guards increases in in
stitutions where inmate population
standards are exceeded.
As an example, Wright said that on
occasion the Santa Clara County
Women's Facility houses nearly twice
its designated number of inmates
while its staff operates 25 percent

below its prescribed level.
"One guard calling in sick results
in a lockdown of the facility for the
entire day," said Wright.
Olley, the first black woman cor
rectional lieutenant hired at San
Ouentin prison, spoke of the dif

ficulties corrections officials are fac
ing during the current public outcry
for more and longer prison sen
tences.
"The Department of Corrections,"
said Olley, "is kind of the tail end of
the dog. We don't send people to
prison â€” we have to deal with them."
"You, the public, are sending more
and more people to prison for longer
and longer terms," she added.
When asked whether he had
drawn any solutions from his ex
periences in prison, Prescott replied,
"I don't feel that I'm obligated to
provide a solution just because I
know the problem."
But he went on to say that society
must find less damaging solutions to
the problem of crime or be haunted
by those that are incarcerated.
"They'll be out someday," Prescott
said, "and they'll be out with all the
fears and frustrations of all those
years" in the brutal atmosphere of
prison.
Prescott compared outside society
to the world he knew behind bars.
"It took me about five minutes to
realize that this is a prison with privi
leges," he said.
"You ask me if this is a prison?"
Prescott continued, pointing to a
woman listening to him speak. "Just
ask her if she can walk across campus
alone right now."
