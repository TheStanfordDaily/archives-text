## Bicycle hazards pose difficult problem for safety 
### Dan Turner 
During certain hours of
every weekday, the Univer
sity campus becomes a
chaoticthoroughfare ofstu
dent bicyclists. These riders
often hurry to get some
where, and thus campus
regulations are many times
ignored. Little wonder,
then, that bike accidents are
a major cause of serious in
juries on campus.
The seasoned up
perclassman has grown
used to the sight of sprawled
bodies and twisted bicycle
frames on the pavement,
but freshmen and visitors
may be unsettled by these
unfortunate results of cam
pus transportation prob
lems. In order to do some
thing about this dangerous
situation, the University
Commission on Parkingand
Transportation has formed
the Bicycle Safety Subcom
mittee.
This subcommittee, made
up of faculty, students, po

lice department represent
atives and community vol
unteers, is designed to react
to the ever-growing need
tor bicycle regulations and
campus safety features. The
committee is chaired by
John Harbaugh, professor
of applied earth sciences,
and public meetings are
held every month at the po
lice department.
"We want to try to change
students' behavior before
we take their biking rights
away from them totally,"
said sophomore Marty Ray
mond, secretary of the com
mittee and member of the
police special services unit.
One of the committee's
current projects is a pro
posal by Raymond, who
plans to instigate a program
of tagging bicycles, motor
cycles and mopeds which
do not comply with certain
campus regulations.
Parked bikes are often
found to be blocking
doorways, walkways, access

ramps for the handicapped
and fire lanes. In addition,
people often ride mopeds
and motorcycles in the in
ner campus — something
which is forbidden by law.
Finally, many people tend to
ride their bikes at night
without a proper headlight.
Raymond's program,
which is based on informa
tion gathered from
Berkeley, Davis and Santa
Barbara as well as from per
sonal knowledge, involves
the attachment of paper
tags to parked vehicles on
the campus. The tagging will
begin Monday (Feb. 15) and
continue until the end of
spring quarter.
The tags themselves are
yellow slips which resemble
the "Do Not Disturb" signs
many hotels use to hang on
doorknobs. They will be
placed on the following cat
egories of vehicles:
— Bicycles which are
blocking an access ramp for
the ha ndicapped, a
doorway or pedestrian ac
cess.
— Bicycles that are not
properly secured, whether
because of an inadequate
locking device or because
they are not locked to a sta
tionary object.
— Bicycles parked in in
ner quad areas at night that
do not have headlights.
— Motorcycles or
mopeds parked in the inner
quad.
Though these tags are is
sued by students who have
no power to ticket or im
pound, police officers will
begin patrolling the campus
at the beginning of next
quarter in order to enforce
these rules.
The tagging program is
not the Safety Committee's
only project. Recently,
committee members and
volunteers were patrolling
White Plaza with clipboards
to monitor the amount of
bike traffic passing through
the Plaza's various en
trances and exits.
The purpose of thissurvey
was to determine traffic pat

terns and thus pick out
those areas that pose the
most serious problems to
bike safety. Having ac
complished this, the com
mittee is working on a plan
for new constructions in the
Plaza that will help direct
traffic flow properly and de
crease the chance of col
lision.
The committee is con
cerned with congested traf
fic in the Quad as well. "A
lot of faculty and staff be
lieve that the Quad should
be completely closed to
bike traffic," Raymond said.
"We have thought about it
in the past but there are a lot
of problems with enforce
ment. If students don't like
it, they just aren't going to
obey the rules."
On registration day of
winter quarter, the commit
tee took a survey at Maples

Pavilion. Though the survey
cannot be considered to be
totally objective (since
those who bothered to take
it were generally the more
serious bicyclists on cam
pus), it did reveal a few
things about the habits of
Stanford riders.
Approximately 21 percent
of those surveyed revealed
that they never use a light
when riding at night. Of
those who reported having
been in an accident, the
greatest number occured in
the inner Quad. The pre
dominant causes of these
accidents were that one
rider was either going too
fast, or not looking where
he was going, or both.
About 17 percent in
dicated that they had lost a
bike due to theft on the
Stanford campus, while only
49 percent said their bicycle

was registered in California.
The possible solutions to
the safety problem are many
and varied. Recently, the art
department started a peti
tion that was signed by ap
proximately 738 students,
faculty members and staff
from 57 different depart
ments.
The petition, which was
sent to University President
Donald Kennedy, urges the
. enforcement of vehicle laws
regarding bicycles on cam
pus, as well as speed con
trols, enforced registration
and the construction of des
ignated bike paths. The
Committee agreed that al
though the practicality of
some of these measures was
doubtful, the petition had
made itclearthatsomething
needs to be done.
Many students have their
own solutions to the prob

lem. "People should just
ride on the right side of the
pathway," said John Kelly, a
freshman. "I was in an acci
dent earlier this year be
cause the other guy was on
the wrong side, and we both
tried to evade the same
way."
Deanna Carlyle, also a
freshman, complained
about people who ride at
night without a headlight.
"It's really dangerous at
night . . . bikes just seem to
come from nowhere."
Whatever the solution,
the main problem that exists
is one of education. The ef
forts of the Bicycle Safety
Committee, with their sur
veys and programs, serve to
educate students about
ways to maintain the safety
of both their property and
themselves.

49 percent said their bicycle

was registered in California.
The possible solutions to
the safety problem are many
and varied. Recently, the art
department started a peti
tion that was signed by ap
proximately 738 students,
faculty members and staff
from 57 different depart
ments.
The petition, which was
sent to University President
Donald Kennedy, urges the
. enforcement of vehicle laws
regarding bicycles on cam
pus, as well as speed con
trols, enforced registration
and the construction of des
ignated bike paths. The
Committee agreed that al
though the practicality of
some of these measures was
doubtful, the petition had
made itclearthatsomething
needs to be done.
Many students have their
own solutions to the prob

lem. "People should just
ride on the right side of the
pathway," said John Kelly, a
freshman. "I was in an acci
dent earlier this year be
cause the other guy was on
the wrong side, and we both
tried to evade the same
way."
Deanna Carlyle, also a
freshman, complained
about people who ride at
night without a headlight.
"It's really dangerous at
night . . . bikes just seem to
come from nowhere."
Whatever the solution,
the main problem that exists
is one of education. The ef
forts of the Bicycle Safety
Committee, with their sur
veys and programs, serve to
educate students about
ways to maintain the safety
of both their property and
themselves.

danger. New safety rules may aid traffic control.
During certain hours of
every weekday, the Univer
sity campus becomes a
chaoticthoroughfare ofstu
dent bicyclists. These riders
often hurry to get some
where, and thus campus
regulations are many times
ignored. Little wonder,
then, that bike accidents are
a major cause of serious in
juries on campus.
The seasoned up
perclassman has grown
used to the sight of sprawled
bodies and twisted bicycle
frames on the pavement,
but freshmen and visitors
may be unsettled by these
unfortunate results of cam
pus transportation prob
lems. In order to do some
thing about this dangerous
situation, the University
Commission on Parkingand
Transportation has formed
the Bicycle Safety Subcom
mittee.
This subcommittee, made
up of faculty, students, po

lice department represent
atives and community vol
unteers, is designed to react
to the ever-growing need
tor bicycle regulations and
campus safety features. The
committee is chaired by
John Harbaugh, professor
of applied earth sciences,
and public meetings are
held every month at the po
lice department.
"We want to try to change
students' behavior before
we take their biking rights
away from them totally,"
said sophomore Marty Ray
mond, secretary of the com
mittee and member of the
police special services unit.
One of the committee's
current projects is a pro
posal by Raymond, who
plans to instigate a program
of tagging bicycles, motor
cycles and mopeds which
do not comply with certain
campus regulations.
Parked bikes are often
found to be blocking
doorways, walkways, access

ramps for the handicapped
and fire lanes. In addition,
people often ride mopeds
and motorcycles in the in
ner campus — something
which is forbidden by law.
Finally, many people tend to
ride their bikes at night
without a proper headlight.
Raymond's program,
which is based on informa
tion gathered from
Berkeley, Davis and Santa
Barbara as well as from per
sonal knowledge, involves
the attachment of paper
tags to parked vehicles on
the campus. The tagging will
begin Monday (Feb. 15) and
continue until the end of
spring quarter.
The tags themselves are
yellow slips which resemble
the "Do Not Disturb" signs
many hotels use to hang on
doorknobs. They will be
placed on the following cat
egories of vehicles:
— Bicycles which are
blocking an access ramp for
the ha ndicapped, a
doorway or pedestrian ac
cess.
— Bicycles that are not
properly secured, whether
because of an inadequate
locking device or because
they are not locked to a sta
tionary object.
— Bicycles parked in in
ner quad areas at night that
do not have headlights.
— Motorcycles or
mopeds parked in the inner
quad.
Though these tags are is
sued by students who have
no power to ticket or im
pound, police officers will
begin patrolling the campus
at the beginning of next
quarter in order to enforce
these rules.
The tagging program is
not the Safety Committee's
only project. Recently,
committee members and
volunteers were patrolling
White Plaza with clipboards
to monitor the amount of
bike traffic passing through
the Plaza's various en
trances and exits.
The purpose of thissurvey
was to determine traffic pat

terns and thus pick out
those areas that pose the
most serious problems to
bike safety. Having ac
complished this, the com
mittee is working on a plan
for new constructions in the
Plaza that will help direct
traffic flow properly and de
crease the chance of col
lision.
The committee is con
cerned with congested traf
fic in the Quad as well. "A
lot of faculty and staff be
lieve that the Quad should
be completely closed to
bike traffic," Raymond said.
"We have thought about it
in the past but there are a lot
of problems with enforce
ment. If students don't like
it, they just aren't going to
obey the rules."
On registration day of
winter quarter, the commit
tee took a survey at Maples

Pavilion. Though the survey
cannot be considered to be
totally objective (since
those who bothered to take
it were generally the more
serious bicyclists on cam
pus), it did reveal a few
things about the habits of
Stanford riders.
Approximately 21 percent
of those surveyed revealed
that they never use a light
when riding at night. Of
those who reported having
been in an accident, the
greatest number occured in
the inner Quad. The pre
dominant causes of these
accidents were that one
rider was either going too
fast, or not looking where
he was going, or both.
About 17 percent in
dicated that they had lost a
bike due to theft on the
Stanford campus, while only
49 percent said their bicycle

was registered in California.
