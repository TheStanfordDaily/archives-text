# Coffee House patio possible

### Steve Kaufman 
Bidding for the construction of an outdoor patio for
the Coffee House will be opened up if a joint Coffee
House-Tresidder Union plan is approved by the Office
of Development, according to Greg Larsen, assistant di
rector of Tresidder Union.
The patio, currently in its last stages of evaluation,
would be enclosed by a combination of hedge and fence
and include such items as a redwood deck, fire pit and
new tables and chairs. Costs of this addition to the
Dinkelspiel side of the Coffee House are estimated at
$15,000 to $20,000.
"I'm very excited about the proposal," said Steve
Weiss, manager of the ASSU-run Coffee House. "I think
a patio would really help not only to relieve the peak
hour rush, but also to add to the uniqueness of the at
mosphere." Weiss has been manager of the Coffee
House since June 1980, and was one of the idea's original
supporters.
The expansion, already budgeted by Tresidder, is de
signed to add to the quality of the Coffee House without
creating a "beer garden" or pub-like atmosphere. "It's
an alternative to sitting inside," said Weiss. "When it's
simply too crowded, or it's sunny outside, a patio would
be the perfect answer."
To determine community opinion about the proposal,
an open forum was held last Thursday to discuss the issue

and obtain suggestions for the design of the project.
Though attendance was sparse, the overall feeling
toward the idea was positive.
"It would be nice to have another area that is distinctly
the Coffee House," said Stuart Leaf, chair of the Tres
idder Food Committee. "The Coffee House can be stuffy
sometimes, and an outside patio would definitely im
prove the aesthetic quality of the area." The area cur
rently sports picnic tables arranged on gravel.
Adding to this was Greg Larson, assistant director of
Tresidder. "Looking at Union Crossroads, Encina Station
and the Coffee House, each appeals to a different type of
person. Judging by the Coffee House's crowdedness and
popularity, there seems to be a need for this kind of
place, and we're trying to meet that need."
The idea for an outdoor patio isn't new. Several years
ago, Tresidder administrators raised the issue, but were
told by the University that they would have to erect a
stone wall, which would have made the project too ex
pensive.
Last year, Dick Butterfield, then-president of Coffee
House, Inc., Weiss, and Larson resurrected the idea and
submitted it again to Tresidder, which has received no
complaints from the University Planning Office so far.
"We are currently working with a contractor," said
Larson, "and Tresidder hasalready drawn upasetof pre-

WAITING FOR A FACELIFT â€” If plans currently being considered by Tresidder Union management are
carried out, this area outside the Coffee House may be supplied with new tables and chairs, a fire pit and
a redwood deck.
