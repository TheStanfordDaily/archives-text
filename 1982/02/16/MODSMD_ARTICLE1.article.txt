# Coffee House patio possible
## 
### Steve Kaufman 
Bidding for the construction of an outdoor patio for
the Coffee House will be opened up if a joint Coffee
House-Tresidder Union plan is approved by the Office
of Development, according to Greg Larsen, assistant di
rector of Tresidder Union.
The patio, currently in its last stages of evaluation,
would be enclosed by a combination of hedge and fence
and include such items as a redwood deck, fire pit and
new tables and chairs. Costs of this addition to the
Dinkelspiel side of the Coffee House are estimated at
$15,000 to $20,000.
"I'm very excited about the proposal," said Steve
Weiss, manager of the ASSU-run Coffee House. "I think
a patio would really help not only to relieve the peak
hour rush, but also to add to the uniqueness of the at
mosphere." Weiss has been manager of the Coffee
House since June 1980, and was one of the idea's original
supporters.
The expansion, already budgeted by Tresidder, is de
signed to add to the quality of the Coffee House without
creating a "beer garden" or pub-like atmosphere. "It's
an alternative to sitting inside," said Weiss. "When it's
simply too crowded, or it's sunny outside, a patio would
be the perfect answer."
To determine community opinion about the proposal,
an open forum was held last Thursday to discuss the issue

and obtain suggestions for the design of the project.
Though attendance was sparse, the overall feeling
toward the idea was positive.
"It would be nice to have another area that is distinctly
the Coffee House," said Stuart Leaf, chair of the Tres
idder Food Committee. "The Coffee House can be stuffy
sometimes, and an outside patio would definitely im
prove the aesthetic quality of the area." The area cur
rently sports picnic tables arranged on gravel.
Adding to this was Greg Larson, assistant director of
Tresidder. "Looking at Union Crossroads, Encina Station
and the Coffee House, each appeals to a different type of
person. Judging by the Coffee House's crowdedness and
popularity, there seems to be a need for this kind of
place, and we're trying to meet that need."
The idea for an outdoor patio isn't new. Several years
ago, Tresidder administrators raised the issue, but were
told by the University that they would have to erect a
stone wall, which would have made the project too ex
pensive.
Last year, Dick Butterfield, then-president of Coffee
House, Inc., Weiss, and Larson resurrected the idea and
submitted it again to Tresidder, which has received no
complaints from the University Planning Office so far.
"We are currently working with a contractor," said
Larson, "and Tresidder hasalready drawn upasetof pre-

liminary plans. If it's OK'd by the
Planning Office, and if we're sure
there is no large public sentiment
against the project, we'll open the
construction up for bidding."
Despite the enthusiasm about the
proposed expansion, there is con
cern over several issues. The first
concerns the Coffee House's liquor
license. According to Weiss, getting
the license extension to include the
patio area isn't a problem; it's the
potential of the Coffee House be
coming a "beer garden"-type of es
tablishment.
"Alcohol is a concern," Weiss said.
"We are, and will continue to be, re
sponsible for the area outside 24
hours a day, and therefore are very
careful with both who we sell alcohol

to and not letting it get outside."
Questions of competition with
Union Crossroads and Encina Station
also arose in the forum. In response
to this, Larson quickly recapped the
history of the Union. Servomation,
the company that contracts to run
Union Crossroads and Encina Sta
tion, offered to assume those two
without assuming responsibility for
running the Coffee House; all other
bidders refused to take thenrwitfiout
the Coffee House. Furthermore, he
said, Servomation has always worked
together with the Coffee House and
is supportive of the idea of the patio.
Funding for the project was also
discussed, as was the cost-effective
ness of the patio. The Tresidder
budget committee last year looked at
alternative uses for the money, in
cluding energy conservation projects
and improving Encina Station.

Larson said, "The committee,
along with the Food Committee, felt
that though it isan expensive project,
it was one of the few alternatives
looked at which had a good potential
of paying for itself in a short time."
Constant usage, more revenue for
the Coffee House, and a short pay
back period for Tresidder are all en
visioned as results of the construc
tion.
Larson, however, also expressed
some hesitation over the project fun
ding, saying that he preferred the
Coffee House pay for the project
with a loan, and let increased sales
cover the costs of the loan. (The tradi
tional approach has been for Tres
idder to fully fund all improvement
projects.)
"The Coffee House prefers to take
no risk," Larson said, "and would
prefer for us (Tresidder) to pay for it,

or for most of it. If the business really
does pick up and the revenue in
creases, then everything is fine. I'm
just not certain that it's a financially
sound move to make." The terms of
funding are still under negotiation.
The patio also raises concerns
about possible price increases at the
Coffee House. "Of course things are
expensive," said Weiss. "We were
forced to raise our prices last year be
cause we were in bad shape financial
ly. Things are better now, and we ex
pect not to have to raise prices until
late in summer." Weiss also said that
the increase in Coffee House patron
age, estimated at 15 percent, will help
to fund the project.
The patio, besides providing an
outdoor cafe-type of setting, is also
slated for various uses, such as
STARTS activities. "We hope," said
Weiss, "that the patio will serve as

more than an eating place. Hopeful
ly, a small stage will be built, as well as
a fire pit in the center. It's a perfect
setting."
Weiss also said he feels confident
that the Coffee House can accom
modate the extra business. "During
the lunch rush," he said, "we can
open up both sandwich lines. How
ever, after it's over, we shut one
down for the rest of the day. If busi
ness really does pick up substantially,
we could easily keep both lines
open."
If the project is approved by the
Planning Office, the start of construc
tion is expected shortly thereafter.
Completion date is slated for late
spring or early summer. "The con
struction itself," said Leaf, "only
takes a short time. We just want to be
absolutely sure that people don't
have major objections"
