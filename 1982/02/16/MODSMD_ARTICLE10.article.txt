Have you ever wondered
how your house would survive
a serious earthquake? The
Earthquake Safety Hotline
(329-1800) was established last
year to answer that question
and according to Hotline Di
rector and Stanford graduate
student David Hedman, the or
ganization has "blossomed."
By calling the hotline
number, homeowners can
now arrange to have a struc
tural engineering graduatestu
dent inspect their home to pre
dict how it would withstand an
earthquake. For a fee of $63,
the inspection includes an in
formation packet with tips on
how to protect life and proper
ty before, during and after an

earthquake, a specially-made
long-term water storage con
tainerand a wrench forturning
off the gas line to prevent an
explosion.
"We are now even doing
corporations," Hedman said.
The group has inspected sever
al corporations, including
Xerox, and is sponsoring an
earthquake information pro
gram at Hewlett-Packard later
this month.
Hedman's organization also
conducts public presentations
on earthquake safety. "We go
out to cities and hold town
meetings," he said. A presenta
tion has been done in Menlo
Park and one is being planned
for Palo Alto.
Hedman is a student mem

ber of the Board of Trustees
here and first got the idea for a
hotline when the trustees
voted to purchase earthquake
insurance. He said the risk re
ports shown to the trustees
were "an eye-opener".
However, he also said, "Stan
ford has far surpassed other
public and private organiza
tions in preparation."
When Hedman started the
hotline, he was sponsored by
the Student Center for Innova
tion in Research and Education
(SCIRE). "I am excited about
being a Stanford student," he
said, "because the innovative
programs and encouraging
professors and staff are things,
you would not find at a lot of
schools."
