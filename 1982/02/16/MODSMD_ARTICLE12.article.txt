The scene in Tresidder
Recreation Center was
chaotic last weekend as
rowdy crowds cheered on
teams of matching pastel
shirted bowlers amid the
crash of pins and tally sheets
filled with countless strikes
and spares.
Meanwhile, one flight up,
in the Tressider Lounge,
chess players sat in hushed
silence pondering their next
move in games which went
on for hours and seemed, as
often as not, to end in
draws.
These competitions were
two events of the Associa
tion of College Unions In
ternational (ACUI) Regional
Recreation Tournament
which attracted more than
300 participants from 21 col
leges across the state.
The tournament has been
held annually since the early
19605. A different college in
the region, which includes
California, Hawaii and Ne
vada, sponsors the event
each year.
Although Stanford's
bowling team did not per
form as well as anticipated,
and was well behind the
leaders from Long Beach

and U.C.-Berkeley, several
Stanford students com
peted admirably on this rec
reational field of honor.
Darts ace Paul McNamara
clinched the dart-throwing
championship Friday night
and will go on to represent
Stanford and the West Coast
at the Old English 800 na
tional college darts tour
nament this April.
Jit'endra Malik relied on
brilliant strategy and at
times uncanny luck as he
found victory amidst the rat
tle of dice cups and ap
preciative onlookers in the
backgammon event. On his
way to the top he narrowly
defeated fellow Stanford
student Mike Orsak and
faced Berkeley's high roller
in the final round.
Local pool shark Brian
Jones went into the quarter
finals in the eight-ball com
petition, held at Town &
Country Billiards in Palo
Alto, but ended third be
hind sharp-shooters from
Berkeley and the University
of San Francisco.
Other events of the week
end included:
Frisbee — held on a rain
soaked Roble Field under
the direction of Stanford's

own disc-master Tom
McKann. Participants dealt
with events in accuracy, dis
tance and style as they vied
for the regional title.
Table tennis — where vic
tory hinged on trick serves,
wrist action, and the psy
chological undermining of
your opponent. Tempers as
well as ping-pong balls flew
high throughout Roble
Gym.
Table soccer — which
ended with a fiercely-con
tested final round where
Long Beach narrowly de
feated Cal State Los Angel
es. Teams of two met across
the tables where each goal
was a hard-fought victory.
The competition was

harsh and the pressure was
on for all involved last
weekend. Some relied on
psychological boosters to
help pull them through: a
bowler with a space-aged
wris. support, or a chess
master sporting a 19th cen
tury style top hat.
Some fell through under
the pressure. Rick Corona, a
member of Berkeley's
squad, after 11 straight
strikes and in front of a gal
lery of nearly 100 people,
couldn't pull of that last
strike needed for a perfect
game and had to settle for a
296. He admitted later,
"When I threw it, I knew it
wasn't a strike. I just wanted
to hit some pins!"

By Sunday, the at
mosphere was a bit lighter.
Stanford bowler Ken
Skillman, after struggling
through Friday and Satur
day's rounds, traded in his
Cardinal shirt for a red ban
danna and a yellow t-shirt
proclaiming him "Slime I."
He said afterwards, "I finally
started bowling like I knew
what I was doing."
Sunday afternoon, the
competion was over, the
victors determined, and the
awards presented. These
masters of the diversionary
arts went back to their stud
ies, and to their practice,
honing their skills for next
year.

tional college darts tour
nament this April.
Jit'endra Malik relied on
brilliant strategy and at
times uncanny luck as he
found victory amidst the rat
tle of dice cups and ap
preciative onlookers in the
backgammon event. On his
way to the top he narrowly
defeated fellow Stanford
student Mike Orsak and
faced Berkeley's high roller
in the final round.
Local pool shark Brian
Jones went into the quarter
finals in the eight-ball com
petition, held at Town &
Country Billiards in Palo
Alto, but ended third be
hind sharp-shooters from
Berkeley and the University
of San Francisco.
Other events of the week
end included:
Frisbee — held on a rain
soaked Roble Field under
the direction of Stanford's

own disc-master Tom
McKann. Participants dealt
with events in accuracy, dis
tance and style as they vied
for the regional title.
Table tennis — where vic
tory hinged on trick serves,
wrist action, and the psy
chological undermining of
your opponent. Tempers as
well as ping-pong balls flew
high throughout Roble
Gym.
Table soccer — which
ended with a fiercely-con
tested final round where
Long Beach narrowly de
feated Cal State Los Angel
es. Teams of two met across
the tables where each goal
was a hard-fought victory.
The competition was

harsh and the pressure was
on for all involved last
weekend. Some relied on
psychological boosters to
help pull them through: a
bowler with a space-aged
wris. support, or a chess
master sporting a 19th cen
tury style top hat.
Some fell through under
the pressure. Rick Corona, a
member of Berkeley's
squad, after 11 straight
strikes and in front of a gal
lery of nearly 100 people,
couldn't pull of that last
strike needed for a perfect
game and had to settle for a
296. He admitted later,
"When I threw it, I knew it
wasn't a strike. I just wanted
to hit some pins!"

By Sunday, the at
mosphere was a bit lighter.
Stanford bowler Ken
Skillman, after struggling
through Friday and Satur
day's rounds, traded in his
Cardinal shirt for a red ban
danna and a yellow t-shirt
proclaiming him "Slime I."
He said afterwards, "I finally
started bowling like I knew
what I was doing."
Sunday afternoon, the
competion was over, the
victors determined, and the
awards presented. These
masters of the diversionary
arts went back to their stud
ies, and to their practice,
honing their skills for next
year.

SPORTS OF SORTS — Tresidder Union Recreation Center hosted plenty of action
this weekend during the Association of College Unions International Tournament.
Clockwise from upper right: bowling, chess and table tennis were only a few of the
recreational events in wnich athletes from California, Nevada and Hawaii com
peted.
The scene in Tresidder
Recreation Center was
chaotic last weekend as
rowdy crowds cheered on
teams of matching pastel
shirted bowlers amid the
crash of pins and tally sheets
filled with countless strikes
and spares.
Meanwhile, one flight up,
in the Tressider Lounge,
chess players sat in hushed
silence pondering their next
move in games which went
on for hours and seemed, as
often as not, to end in
draws.
These competitions were
two events of the Associa
tion of College Unions In
ternational (ACUI) Regional
Recreation Tournament
which attracted more than
300 participants from 21 col
leges across the state.
The tournament has been
held annually since the early
19605. A different college in
the region, which includes
California, Hawaii and Ne
vada, sponsors the event
each year.
Although Stanford's
bowling team did not per
form as well as anticipated,
and was well behind the
leaders from Long Beach

and U.C.-Berkeley, several
Stanford students com
peted admirably on this rec
reational field of honor.
Darts ace Paul McNamara
clinched the dart-throwing
championship Friday night
and will go on to represent
Stanford and the West Coast
at the Old English 800 na
tional college darts tour
nament this April.
