## Steve Borish Nuclear subsidies are unfair 
### 
The large corporations of the nu
clear power industry have made a
choice that could affect our future
for many generations. They have al
ready invested a great deal of money
in nuclear energy because they
thought it would yield a high profit.
Though a series of setbacks threatens
to halt the advance of nuclear power
completely, they have not given up
yet.
In the best tradition of big corpo
rations faced with disaster, they have
gone to the federal government and
asked for a handout that the tax
payers will ultimately have to pay if it
is granted. They want more federal
subsidies to the tune of $50 billion.
These true believers in free en
terprise have already forced the in
famous Price-Anderson Act through
Congress. This legislation ensures
limited liability to the nuclear in
dustry in the case of nuclear disasters.
Indeed, the reasons for this legisla
tion are worth thinking about. Presi
dent Ronald Reagan and his pro-nu
clear advisers continue to tell us that
nuclear plants are perfectly safe. Yet
if they are really so safe, why did the
nuclear industry frantically push
through Congress a bill which guar
antees it limited liability in the case of
catastrophic accidents such as the
melting of nuclear fuel-cores or the
rupture of reactor vessels?
Though a courageous North Caro
lina judge ruled that this act was un
constitutional, he was overruled by
the Supreme Court in June 1978, and
the act still stands, ensuring that the
nuclear industry will not have to bear
the financial consequences of its ac
tions should they bring about a
catastrophic disaster. In other words,
the nuclear companies will make the
profits and the American taxpayers
will take all the risks.
Just what are some of these risks?
The best way to show them in their
true light is to examine some of the
pro-nuclear arguments that are often
used and to look beneath them to the
risks that each type of argument ig
nores, disguises, or cleverly brushes
aside.
One kind of argument that we fre
quntly hear is twaddle such as the fol
lowing: "Well, look, you can stand
right next to a nuclear power plant
and get less radiation than you do
from the radioactive potassium in
you body." Sure that's true, as longas
the plant is working properly. If you

put enough steel and concrete be
tween you and a source of radiation
you will be protected, just as long as
all that metal armour is there and the
reactor is working perfectly as
planned.
But did you know that the nation's
nuclear reactors reported 3804 inci
dents in 1980 in which mechanical
equipment or human operators
tailed to work as required? That the
number of incidents was a 20 percent
increase over 1979? That the Rancho
Seco plant near Sacramento, rated
"below average" by the Nuclear

The key
to understanding
how a nuclear reactor
works, or doesn't
work, is in
understanding the
nature of the nuclear
fuel cycle. This cycle
is so full of potent risk
to ourselves that
perhaps it, and not
the question of the
reactor itself, is what
should be under
public debate.

Regulatory Commission, had 47 re
ported "incidents" during the past
year? And that every single nuclear
"incident," whether it is reported or
unreported, places every member of
the nearby human population at
some higher risk of contracting
cancer from exposure to deadly radi
ation?
A second favorite cliche of the nu
clear industry is "Why, the nuclear
industry is so safe that not a single ra
diation casualty has yet occurred."
Thus Dr. Edward Teller was quoted in
the (Daily, Jan. 13), as saying,
"There are 200 reactors in the Free
World, working for 10 years. In all
that time, not one person has been
hurt." The reason why such
statements are scientifically invalid is

that they fail utterly to consider the
full nature of the nuclear fuel cycle
and to take into account the fate of
those who are exposed to radioac
tive hazards at each deadly step of
that cycle. If the proponents of nu
clear power do not artificially sepa
rate the action of a nuclear plant al
ready in operation from the conse
quences of its full fuel cycle, then it is
possible to say that many people
have died, and are dying, as a result
of nuclear power.
The key to understanding how a
nuclear reactor works, or doesn't
work, is in understanding the nature
of the nuclear fuel cycle. This cycle is
so full of potent risk to ourselves that
perhaps it, and not the question of
the reactor itself, is wfvt should be
under public debate. Before the nu
clear fuel ever gets to a reactor, four
phases of the cycle take place: min
ing and milling of the uranium ore,
conversion, "enrichment" and fuel
fabrication. After use in a reactor, the
spent fuel must be reprocessed, in
ventoried and then stored. Even if we
were never to have a major nuclear
power accident the extreme clangers
present at every stage of this fuel cy
cle make nuclear power an unaccep
table option.
Let's take just one phase of the cy
cle and one group that has suffered
from it: The Navajo Indians at the
northern tip of their reservation in
the American Southwest can tell you
about the dangers of uranium min
ing: in Red Rock, Arizona, eight men
out of a community of 50 who
worked in the mines are already
gone and the survivors wheeze at ev
ery step with lung cancer and
pulmonary fibrosis. As one
oberserver put it, "There is no word
in Navajo for radiation, but the elders
can see that the people in Red Rock
are dying."
In spite of its unenviable track rec
ord, itsdismal financial prospectsand
its clear and present danger to hu
man health, the nuclear industry has
the arrogance in these hard times to
ask the American taxpayer for a $50
billion bail-out. Apparently its repre
sentatives believe that the austerities
of free enterprises are something
that should be practiced by those on
welfare, but not by themselves.
