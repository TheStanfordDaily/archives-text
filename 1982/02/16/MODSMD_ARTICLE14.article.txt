## Mother's right to life has priority 
### 
Brian and Emily Morgan describe
the unutterable misfortune of losing
two newborn babies (Daily, Feb. 12).
We could never question either their
growth through suffering into com
passion or their own conclusion that
abortion is impermissible.
We understand the gratitude
adoptive families feel toward
biological mothers. We think,
further, that society should give ma
terial and emotional support to
women for giving up babies they
didn't mean to have, rather than
keeping them to avoid approbium.
At the same time, no woman sould
be compelled to bear, by legal or so
cial sanctions. Unfortunately, the
lives of some women have been
damaged by unwanted babies and
some unwanted babies have suffered
from child abuse or malnutrition.
There are genetic disorders
enzyme defects, major organ
malformations, chromosomal ab
normalities â€” which are fatal to the
child or horrible to live with, yet
which can be detected early in preg
nancy. With Tay Sachs disease, for ex
ample, the infant lives normally for
six to nine months, then goes deaf
and blind and becomes acutely ill,
dying at age four or five. Through
prenatal screening and monitoring,
the incidence of Tay Sachs has
dropped about 75 percent in the last
decade.
Once born, a baby has a life worth
living. But is it moral to bring into life
an organism which pregnancy
monitoring shows will undergo acute
suffering between birth and early
death?
Finally, we must respect the
Morgans' own viewpoint, but their
Christian God does not make it uni
versal. Jews also believe in a "Creator
of life" to quote Brian, but that
doesn't preclude their seeking the
right choice on human issues. They
have been grappling for centuries
with the complex morality of abor
tion. Reform and Conservative
judaism permit abortion for serious
cause and even Orthodox law dist
inguishes between fetal and human
existance, giving precedence to the
mother's right to life.

Can't avoid tuition rise
Following are some responses to
Michael Selmi's assertions about tui
tion, published Feb. 5 by the Daily:
Assertion: "To date, no budget
cutting proposals have been an
nounced."
Response: Provost Albert Hastorf
last fall asked Schools to cut 2 per
cent from their budgets over the next
two years. Those cuts are being
made.
Assertion: "The future is quite
dim" for financial aid "and without
sufficient financial aid the qualified
applicant pool will certainly drop."
Response: University President
Donald Kennedy and other Univer
sity officials, including some quoted
on page one of the Daily, Feb. 5, have
made extremely strong statements
supporting the University's current
"aid-blind" admissions policy. The
applicant pool this year is running
very close to last year's total of 14,000,
according to the Admission Office.
Assertion: "Perhaps it would be
more reassuring to see one of those
little pies telling us where our tuition
dollars go so we can have a better
idea of the composition of the
budget."
Response: Pie charts have been
published for years in the Operating
Budget Guidelines of the University.
Copies are available at the Office of
Management and the Budget.
General observation: Tuition rises
faster than inflation because univer
sities remain very labor intensive en
terprises. That problem will persist
until appropriate ways can be found
to boost productivity within univer
sities and to permit them to retain a
larger share of the financial benefits
flowing from research and from
graduates whose work boosts prod
uctivity in society generally.

Women's strength
The Daily reported Feb. 8 on
Herant Katchadourian's criticism of
women's bodybuilding as "imita
tions of men." Apparently,
Katchadourian stereotypes strength
as male. When will it sink in that
strength is part of the human poten
tial and that it is a virtue in anyone,
not just men?
Women's athletics, including
body-building, does not masculinize

a woman, it humanizes her, for more
of her own potential is developed. Of
course, there are mistakes often in
itiated by men which women would
be better off to avoid (smoking and
wearing business suits come im
mediately to mind), but physical
training isn't one of them.
Weakness and fatness are part of
the anachronistic female stereotype.
Women, as well as men, who demon
strate the tremendous heights of per
sonal physical achievement are to be
admired and emulated no less than
those who demonstrate great in
tellectual or artistic achievements.
