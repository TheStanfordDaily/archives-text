# Commentary/Steve Mitchel
## Fear and loathing in CS 106 
### 
One of these days, if it hasn't al
ready happened, someone will tell
you that before you leave Stanford
you really must take an introductory
course in computer science. In re
sponse, you should get violently ill
on the person's shoes.
If you feel the need to be slightly
more subtle, then just give him or her
a swift kick in the shins and walk
away. But, in any case, DO NOT take
computer science.
Oh sure, I know that computers
are becoming increasingly importatnt
in this age of high technology. As my
adviser said to me, as he bounced me
on his knee and fed me alphabet
soup, "Steve, my boy, computers are
taking over the whole world. Take
computer science .. . and get off my
knee."
So, foolishly, I enrolled in CS 106. I
don't remember why I picked 106 in
stead of 105 or 101.1 think somebody
told me that they're all the same. In
fact, I think that was the same person
that promised he'd introduce me to
Leland Stanford, Jr., but I'm not sure.
Anyway, I went to class and the first
thing my instructor (whose name is
"staff") told us was that there would
be no papers, no midterm and no
final. I thought I had found the ul
timate "mick!" Then came the bad
news: assignments would be handed
out on Monday and would be due on
the following Monday. Heavy sigh.
These "assignments" generally re
quire you to waste your time by fran
tically trying to compose a program
that bears absolutely no relevance to
anything of importance in the free
world. Nevertheless, the work must
get done. I quickly devised a formula
for completing my weekly assign
ments: 1) Pick up assignment on
Monday, 2) Fold it in half and place it
in the second dresser drawer (with
socks and underwear), 3) Forget
about it until Sunday, 4) On Sunday,
go to CERAS and beg for help.
Perhaps now I should run down
some basic terminology, for all you
computer-virgins out there who
don't know a "for-loop" from a Fruit
Loop. First of all, LOTS, despite popu
lar belief, is not a place, CERAS is a

place, dummy. LOTS is a, um, er, well
it's like LESS, only I'm not exactly sure
what the either is. The only thing that
matters is that you turn your program
in one Monday. Remember that.
To complete your weekly program
you have to go to CERAS. If you've
never been to CERAS, don't worry
about it — you're not missing any
thing. It's just a big room filed with
computers. It's a really boring place.
It makes your dentist's office seem
like Great America.
It's just so impersonal. I guessthat's
the trademark of the computer age.
Still, it seems as if they could do
something to make you feel a little
more at home when you walk in.
Maybe a permanent host would
help.
"Good evening Mr. Mitchel, sir.
Terminal for one?"
"Yes, thank you, Pierre. Perhaps
something with a view?"
"Very well, sir. Would you care for
an appetizer this evening?"
"No thank you, Pieric. I'm in a bit
of a hurry — I have a class in 12 hours.
I think I'll just start right in with my
main program.
Outsiders have a hard time figur
ing out why their friends spend so
much time at CERAS. I used to think
somebody was showing dirty movies
in there. Now I know better. After
five weeks of the "Comp-Sci ex
perience", I have compiled a list of
reasons why we all spend so much
time there: 1) None of us really
knows what we're doing. 2) It's a
short list.
Of course, it would probably be a
lot easier for me to complete my
weekly program if I started working
on it on Monday. But that would be a
violation of the sacred code of all
computer science students: never
start working on a program until Sun
day night. Another reason for waiting
until Sunday night is that you get to

meet all the other CS students from
all the other classes who have also
waited until the last minute to start
their programs. While you're waiting
in the long line (queue, if you prefer),
to get a terminal, you can strike up in
teresting conversations, such as,
"Come here often, heh, heh."
The best part about being at CERAS
on a crowded Sunday night is that the
computer just can't handle it. It has a
nervous breakdown. It says, "Hey,
look, I need a rest. I'm sick of all of
you and I'm sick of all of your stupid
programs. Wake me for breakfast."
Then it simply turns itself off, or
"crashes."
A crash can be a very unsettling
event. If you have been typing in a
program for a couple of hours and
you only have a line or two still to
type, you can lose the whole thing if
the computer decides to crash. This is
basically equivalent to having written
19 pages of a 20-page paper and then
finding out that your roommate used
your completed work for confetti at
the Stanford-UCLA game.
Usually, after hours of sweat.
Mounds Bars and Diet Pepsis, yob
can somehow manage to complete
your program. Then comes the part
that really scares me: you become
downright proud of the damn thing.
You want to show it to your friends.
You want to show it to the world! You
want to say, "Look at this, world! I did
it! I DID IT! A program computing
the amount of Spam it would take to
fill the Goodyear Blimp!"
So take my advice, think twice
about taking a computer science
class. If computers really are taking
over the whole world, there's going
to be a whole bunch of neurotic peo
ple running around. It might be a
good idea to take a psychology
course or two. I'd tell you more, but
I'm off to CERAS.

away. But, in any case, DO NOT take
computer science.
Oh sure, I know that computers
are becoming increasingly importatnt
in this age of high technology. As my
adviser said to me, as he bounced me
on his knee and fed me alphabet
soup, "Steve, my boy, computers are
taking over the whole world. Take
computer science .. . and get off my
knee."
So, foolishly, I enrolled in CS 106. I
don't remember why I picked 106 in
stead of 105 or 101.1 think somebody
told me that they're all the same. In
fact, I think that was the same person
that promised he'd introduce me to
Leland Stanford, Jr., but I'm not sure.
Anyway, I went to class and the first
thing my instructor (whose name is
"staff") told us was that there would
be no papers, no midterm and no
final. I thought I had found the ul
timate "mick!" Then came the bad
news: assignments would be handed
out on Monday and would be due on
the following Monday. Heavy sigh.
These "assignments" generally re
quire you to waste your time by fran
tically trying to compose a program
that bears absolutely no relevance to
anything of importance in the free
world. Nevertheless, the work must
get done. I quickly devised a formula
for completing my weekly assign
ments: 1) Pick up assignment on
Monday, 2) Fold it in half and place it
in the second dresser drawer (with
socks and underwear), 3) Forget
about it until Sunday, 4) On Sunday,
go to CERAS and beg for help.
Perhaps now I should run down
some basic terminology, for all you
computer-virgins out there who
don't know a "for-loop" from a Fruit
Loop. First of all, LOTS, despite popu
lar belief, is not a place, CERAS is a

place, dummy. LOTS is a, um, er, well
it's like LESS, only I'm not exactly sure
what the either is. The only thing that
matters is that you turn your program
in one Monday. Remember that.
To complete your weekly program
you have to go to CERAS. If you've
never been to CERAS, don't worry
about it — you're not missing any
thing. It's just a big room filed with
computers. It's a really boring place.
It makes your dentist's office seem
like Great America.
It's just so impersonal. I guessthat's
the trademark of the computer age.
Still, it seems as if they could do
something to make you feel a little
more at home when you walk in.
Maybe a permanent host would
help.
"Good evening Mr. Mitchel, sir.
Terminal for one?"
"Yes, thank you, Pierre. Perhaps
something with a view?"
"Very well, sir. Would you care for
an appetizer this evening?"
"No thank you, Pieric. I'm in a bit
of a hurry — I have a class in 12 hours.
I think I'll just start right in with my
main program.
Outsiders have a hard time figur
ing out why their friends spend so
much time at CERAS. I used to think
somebody was showing dirty movies
in there. Now I know better. After
five weeks of the "Comp-Sci ex
perience", I have compiled a list of
reasons why we all spend so much
time there: 1) None of us really
knows what we're doing. 2) It's a
short list.
Of course, it would probably be a
lot easier for me to complete my
weekly program if I started working
on it on Monday. But that would be a
violation of the sacred code of all
computer science students: never
start working on a program until Sun
day night. Another reason for waiting
until Sunday night is that you get to

meet all the other CS students from
all the other classes who have also
waited until the last minute to start
their programs. While you're waiting
in the long line (queue, if you prefer),
to get a terminal, you can strike up in
teresting conversations, such as,
"Come here often, heh, heh."
The best part about being at CERAS
on a crowded Sunday night is that the
computer just can't handle it. It has a
nervous breakdown. It says, "Hey,
look, I need a rest. I'm sick of all of
you and I'm sick of all of your stupid
programs. Wake me for breakfast."
Then it simply turns itself off, or
"crashes."
A crash can be a very unsettling
event. If you have been typing in a
program for a couple of hours and
you only have a line or two still to
type, you can lose the whole thing if
the computer decides to crash. This is
basically equivalent to having written
19 pages of a 20-page paper and then
finding out that your roommate used
your completed work for confetti at
the Stanford-UCLA game.
Usually, after hours of sweat.
Mounds Bars and Diet Pepsis, yob
can somehow manage to complete
your program. Then comes the part
that really scares me: you become
downright proud of the damn thing.
You want to show it to your friends.
You want to show it to the world! You
want to say, "Look at this, world! I did
it! I DID IT! A program computing
the amount of Spam it would take to
fill the Goodyear Blimp!"
So take my advice, think twice
about taking a computer science
class. If computers really are taking
over the whole world, there's going
to be a whole bunch of neurotic peo
ple running around. It might be a
good idea to take a psychology
course or two. I'd tell you more, but
I'm off to CERAS.
(Steve Mitchel is a junior majoring in
political science.)
One of these days, if it hasn't al
ready happened, someone will tell
you that before you leave Stanford
you really must take an introductory
course in computer science. In re
sponse, you should get violently ill
on the person's shoes.
If you feel the need to be slightly
more subtle, then just give him or her
a swift kick in the shins and walk
away. But, in any case, DO NOT take
computer science.
