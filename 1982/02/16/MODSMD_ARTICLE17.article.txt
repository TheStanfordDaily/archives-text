## Myopic admissions changes 
### 
Last week's papers were full of
congresspeople proclaiming that
President Ronald Reagan's budget
would be facing hard times. But final
ly on Tuesday I read about one of its
consequences that made me, as a stu
dent, completely furious. As of the
1982-83 school year, Wesleyan Uni
veristy will no longer be able to offer
aid-blind admission*
Aid-blind admissions is the policy
of offering admissions to students
without even looking at their finan
cial records. It is a policy that has
been in practice at most major uni
versities since the early '70s (accord
ing to the New York Times, Feb. 8)
and is the reported policy here.
i
So what difference does this make?
Who wants to go to Wesleyan any
way? It's just that aid-blind ad
missions programs are going to be re
evaluated as well at Columbia,
Barnard, Harvard, Boston College,
Cornell, Princeton, and Wellesley.
Stanford has said that it will not re
consider its policy, but in the long
run, if cutbacks in federal student aid
continue, no university will be able
to avoid thinking seriously about its
financial aid system.
Let me explain what the end to aid
blind admissions means. It means
that, if after preparing a preliminary
admissions list, a school decides that
it cannot offerthe necessaryfinancial
aid to all the people accepted, it will
replace names at thebottomof the list
with names of less qualified people
who can afford to pay their own way.
It has not always been the case that
an education was considered a right
and not a privilege. But again, so
what? If there are no aid-blind ad
missions at Harvard, those who are

qualified but can't afford it, will cer
tainly be admitted to an affordable
public university. What difference
does it make?
The significance lies in the fact
that, more than just conferring a
quality education, a "prestigious"
university confers power. The nation
is run politically and economically,
and one might even argue culturally,
by people from Harvards and Stan
fords, not those from public schools.
The requirement of money for ad
mission to good schools is thus
analagous to a poll-tax — it is a way of
limiting access to influence.
Yet I do not attempt to lay the
blame on Wesleyan University. One
cannot expect a university to lose
money to educate its students. Rath
er I criticize Reagan directly, and his
advisors responsible for his budget.
More than $600 million is being cut
from the allocation for aid to higher
education, money that is being used
to build aircraft carriers, MX missies,
and two different kinds of manned
bombers.
What is more, the end to aid-blind
admissions only makes de jure what
was de facto already. Nobody knows
the number of people accepted to
Harvard or Stanford who then turn it
down because they cannot aford it,
nor how many people simply do not
bother to apply. The relationship be
tween economic status, primary and
secondary education is well known;
the poorer you are, the less likely you
are to receive a good enough educa
tion to prepare you for Harvard in the
first place.
