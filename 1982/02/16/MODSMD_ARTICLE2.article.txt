# New houses will be homey but elegant
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
This is the first in a four-part series
on the new housing complex near
Lake Lagunita. The first article will
portray the three independent
houses, and the second will describe
the suites and accompanying eating
centers. The third segment will re
port on the dormitory complex to be
known as Sterling Quad, and the
fourth will deal with changes in Uni
versity housing policy which will re
sult from the availability of additional
housing.
The new housing complex's three
independent houses, which will
open this September, will combine
History Corner elegance with Row
House hominess to make a living sit
uation which causes project director
Jan Van Houten's eyes to shine in an
ticipation.
Van Houten said that if she were
participating in the draw she would

put the three houses at the top of her
list.
And although many have said the
designers of the new housing com
plex catered to the "country club"
set, Van Houten doesn't seem a bit
worried about the image: "They may
say that we follow a country club
style, but at least they can't say we
aren't taking every pain to make sure
that the housing is attractive to both
students and faculty," she said.
Following a similar space plan, the
three houses, which will be available
as choices in the spring draw, will
each hold 60 people and one resi
dent fellow (RF). They will run from
north to south approximately per
pendicular to the west shore of Lake
Lagunita. They will all have kitchens
and dining rooms on the first floor, as
well as studies, seminar rooms for
teaching, living rooms with fire
