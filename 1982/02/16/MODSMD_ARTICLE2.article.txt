# New houses will be homey but elegant
##

This is the first in a four-part series
on the new housing complex near
Lake Lagunita. The first article will
portray the three independent
houses, and the second will describe
the suites and accompanying eating
centers. The third segment will re
port on the dormitory complex to be
known as Sterling Quad, and the
fourth will deal with changes in Uni
versity housing policy which will re
sult from the availability of additional
housing.
The new housing complex's three
independent houses, which will
open this September, will combine
History Corner elegance with Row
House hominess to make a living sit
uation which causes project director
Jan Van Houten's eyes to shine in an
ticipation.
Van Houten said that if she were
participating in the draw she would

put the three houses at the top of her
list.
And although many have said the
designers of the new housing com
plex catered to the "country club"
set, Van Houten doesn't seem a bit
worried about the image: "They may
say that we follow a country club
style, but at least they can't say we
aren't taking every pain to make sure
that the housing is attractive to both
students and faculty," she said.
Following a similar space plan, the
three houses, which will be available
as choices in the spring draw, will
each hold 60 people and one resi
dent fellow (RF). They will run from
north to south approximately per
pendicular to the west shore of Lake
Lagunita. They will all have kitchens
and dining rooms on the first floor, as
well as studies, seminar rooms for
teaching, living rooms with fire

places, a small open kitchenette, and
plenty of storage space.
The entire housing complex was
designed by Esherick, Homsey,
Dodge, and Davis, the firm which
renovated the History Corner. Ac
cording to Van Houten, the houses
will be filled with the same kind of
wood paneling used in the History
Corner.
Van Houten is quick to point out
that the three houses will not suffer
from the "Tract House Blues," how
ever. Architecturally, each will be dif
ferent, and each will have its own
"character," she maintains.
The most notable difference will
be in the East Asian Studies Theme
(EAST) House, which will be thp

northernmost of the three houses.
The house will concentrate on pro
viding an ambience conducive to
those who are interested in East Asia
studies, and Van Houten said she
thinks this could mean anything from
Tatami mats in the living room to Ori
ental food six days a week.
The students who live in the
houses and the RF will decide on the
house's program. Van Houten said
that the Office of Residential Educa
tion will announce who the RFs for
the independent houses will be some
time later this month.
The two other independent
houses will most likely be on dif
ferent food plans than the EAST
House, which will probably hire its
own cook. The other houses will
have a cook provided for them by the
University Food Service.
