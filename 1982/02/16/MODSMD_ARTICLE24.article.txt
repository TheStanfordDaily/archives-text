## The 						Go-Go's: no more moping on Saturday night

"We Got The Beat. We Got
The Beat!" Have you ever re
alised how powerful this
statement is? It sums up the
whole history of rock and roll
in four simple words. It ex
presses the main reason be
hind rock and roll — the beat.
Without the beat, we are just
paralyzed poets. With it, we
can move millions ( — come
back down to earth, Stefan).
it is no surprise, therefore,
that "We Got The Beat" is the
catchiest dance number since
Little Eva's "Locomotion." But

would you believe that the
song is by an all new girl group
from L.A.? Hardly seems likely,
but the the Go-Go's are for
real. In my mind, they are the
only standout debut act of
1981, and the reason for their

prominence is the fact that
they are original and not stere
otyped. They are a far cry from

the glamorous, graceful gir
groups of the '60s (i.e.
Ronettes, Supremes, etc.), anc
they aren't the '70s tough girl'

(i.e., Pat Benatar, Joan Jett,
etc.). Instead, the Go-Go's lie
somewhere in between these
two categories of female
rockers. They are light-hearted
and bouncy, but they rock with
a powerful backbeat If the ear

ly Beatles would have female
counterparts, I think that The
Go-Go's would fit perfectly.
Their debut album, Beauty
and the Beat, is an accurate re
flection of what the group and
its music is ail about. Musically
and instrumentally it is one of
the most upbeat and vivacious
records of the year. The music
consists of '60s surf-rock-cum
early British invasion-style
guitar riffing in combination
with full, rich harmonies and
vocals, and it all blends togeth
er in an original way. Like the

early Beatles, they take from
many diverse musical sources,
but they synthesize a uniquely
fresh and exciting sound. Sure
they may have copped riffs that
you've heard on thousands of
records, especially those by
The Ventures or The Hollies,
but for some reason they
sound vital and new. I guess
that the key to their appealing
sound is the fact that the often
used guitar riffs create a ten
sion with the gorgeous high
harmonies and exuberant vo
cals.
And then there's the beat.
The group's loudly-mixed beat
is the theme that runs through
almost all of the numbers. The
beat is the focal point in giving
their music a surprisingly new
sound. Basically, it is a re
discovery of early Beatles
power pop. The group's hit,
"Our Lips Are Sealed" is the
type of number that is a perfect

synthesis of this early Beatles
power pop sound — the big
back-beat; the simple yet uplif
ting guitar work; the spirit en
riched vocals; and the ex
uberant power of the group as
a whole musically defined enti
ty.
However, there have been
so many other groups that have
initially sounded fresh and vi
tal, and yet have failed to mate
rialize as prominent and profi
cient rock bands (i.e., The
Knack). What is it that sets the
Go-Go's off from so many oth
ers that have failed? The an
swer is simple. TheGo-Go'sare
a girl group singing from a
woman's point of view. Since
they write their own material,
their lyrics reflect the other
side of the male-dominated
songwriting field. Their lyrics
twist and reverse the typically

macho rock lyric. Their songs
tell the tale of independent
women who are not devastated
in their not having a steady
boyfriend. Sure, they'd like
one, but if they don't have one,
then that's the guy's loss. No
more moping and being de
pressed on a dateless Saturday
night. No more crying and
pleading with the boyfriend, as
in The Supremes "You Keep
Me Hanging On." Instead, in
"Fading Fast," The Go-Go's
sing of a girl who handles the
break-up of the relationship —
"You want me back again, but
I've just got to turn my head.
You can talk about old times,

they don't mean a thing to me.
You're fading fast out of mem
ory."
Above all though, this is all
sung in the most subtly humor
ous way. The pun of the line
"Go-Go music really makes us
dance" in "We Got The Beat"
does not escape the listener's
ear, and in the sexually de
ranged "Skidmarks On My
Heart," we get theothersideof
the "guy loves his car more
than the girl" song — "Rev her
engines for your pleasure;
caress and fondle her steering
wheel. When you moan and
hug her gear shift. Stop! Think
how it makes me feel... I need
promises, you want Motor
Trend; our love needs an over
haul, this may be the end." This
all just adds tothe vitality ofthe
already excellent songs.
All the vitality and excite
ment prevalent in the Go-Go's
is a product of an all-female
production. The band is not a
novelty act. They are five street
girls from L.A., to whom the
beat means everything. They
show that females can make it
on theirown, in theirown way,
in the music field. They make it
possible for avid female
rockers to have someone who
they can relate to.
When theysingsuchsongsas
"How Much More" and "This
Town," we are getting the full
view of what rock and roll
means to the female rock gen
eration. When they sing "Ac
tion — gonna track it down,
gonna turn some heads
tonite," we know what's going
on in their heads. When they
sing, "We're all dreamers —
We're all whores — discarded
stars, like worn out cars," we
realize how used the female in
general is.
Overall then, The Go-Go's
are more than just the new
band on the block. They are a
combination of being young,
vital and female in the rock
world ofthe '80s.

sing, "We're all dreamers —
We're all whores — discarded
stars, like worn out cars," we
realize how used the female in

(The Co-Go's
Beauty and The beat
IR& Records

"We Got The Beat. We Got
The Beat!" Have you ever re
alised how powerful this
statement is? It sums up the
whole history of rock and roll
in four simple words. It ex
presses the main reason be
hind rock and roll — the beat.
Without the beat, we are just
paralyzed poets. With it, we
can move millions ( — come
back down to earth, Stefan).
it is no surprise, therefore,
that "We Got The Beat" is the
catchiest dance number since
Little Eva's "Locomotion." But

would you believe that the
song is by an all new girl group
from L.A.? Hardly seems likely,
but the the Go-Go's are for
real. In my mind, they are the
only standout debut act of
1981, and the reason for their

prominence is the fact that
they are original and not stere
otyped. They are a far cry from

the glamorous, graceful gir
groups of the '60s (i.e.
Ronettes, Supremes, etc.), anc
they aren't the '70s tough girl'

(i.e., Pat Benatar, Joan Jett,
etc.). Instead, the Go-Go's lie
somewhere in between these
two categories of female
rockers. They are light-hearted
and bouncy, but they rock with
a powerful backbeat If the ear

ly Beatles would have female
counterparts, I think that The
Go-Go's would fit perfectly.
Their debut album, Beauty
and the Beat, is an accurate re
flection of what the group and
its music is ail about. Musically
and instrumentally it is one of
the most upbeat and vivacious
records of the year. The music
consists of '60s surf-rock-cum
early British invasion-style
guitar riffing in combination
with full, rich harmonies and
vocals, and it all blends togeth
er in an original way. Like the

early Beatles, they take from
many diverse musical sources,
but they synthesize a uniquely
fresh and exciting sound. Sure
they may have copped riffs that
you've heard on thousands of
records, especially those by
The Ventures or The Hollies,
but for some reason they
sound vital and new. I guess
that the key to their appealing
sound is the fact that the often
used guitar riffs create a ten
sion with the gorgeous high
harmonies and exuberant vo
cals.
And then there's the beat.
The group's loudly-mixed beat
is the theme that runs through
almost all of the numbers. The
beat is the focal point in giving
their music a surprisingly new
sound. Basically, it is a re
discovery of early Beatles
power pop. The group's hit,
"Our Lips Are Sealed" is the
type of number that is a perfect

synthesis of this early Beatles
power pop sound — the big
back-beat; the simple yet uplif
ting guitar work; the spirit en
riched vocals; and the ex
uberant power of the group as
a whole musically defined enti
ty.
However, there have been
so many other groups that have
initially sounded fresh and vi
tal, and yet have failed to mate
rialize as prominent and profi
cient rock bands (i.e., The
Knack). What is it that sets the
Go-Go's off from so many oth
ers that have failed? The an
swer is simple. TheGo-Go'sare
a girl group singing from a
woman's point of view. Since
they write their own material,
their lyrics reflect the other
side of the male-dominated
songwriting field. Their lyrics
twist and reverse the typically

macho rock lyric. Their songs
tell the tale of independent
women who are not devastated
in their not having a steady
boyfriend. Sure, they'd like
one, but if they don't have one,
then that's the guy's loss. No
more moping and being de
pressed on a dateless Saturday
night. No more crying and
pleading with the boyfriend, as
in The Supremes "You Keep
Me Hanging On." Instead, in
"Fading Fast," The Go-Go's
sing of a girl who handles the
break-up of the relationship —
"You want me back again, but
I've just got to turn my head.
You can talk about old times,

they don't mean a thing to me.
You're fading fast out of mem
ory."
Above all though, this is all
sung in the most subtly humor
ous way. The pun of the line
"Go-Go music really makes us
dance" in "We Got The Beat"
does not escape the listener's
ear, and in the sexually de
ranged "Skidmarks On My
Heart," we get theothersideof
the "guy loves his car more
than the girl" song — "Rev her
engines for your pleasure;
caress and fondle her steering
wheel. When you moan and
hug her gear shift. Stop! Think
how it makes me feel... I need
promises, you want Motor
Trend; our love needs an over
haul, this may be the end." This
all just adds tothe vitality ofthe
already excellent songs.
All the vitality and excite
ment prevalent in the Go-Go's
is a product of an all-female
production. The band is not a
novelty act. They are five street
girls from L.A., to whom the
beat means everything. They
show that females can make it
on theirown, in theirown way,
in the music field. They make it
possible for avid female
rockers to have someone who
they can relate to.
When theysingsuchsongsas
"How Much More" and "This
Town," we are getting the full
view of what rock and roll
means to the female rock gen
eration. When they sing "Ac
tion — gonna track it down,
gonna turn some heads
tonite," we know what's going
on in their heads. When they
sing, "We're all dreamers —
We're all whores — discarded
stars, like worn out cars," we
realize how used the female in
general is.
Overall then, The Go-Go's
are more than just the new
