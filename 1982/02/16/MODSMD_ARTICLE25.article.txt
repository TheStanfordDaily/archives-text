In terms of sheer beauty, David
Byrne's most recent work, Songs from
the Broadway Production of The Cath
erine Wheel, far surpasses anything he
has ever done. The album, a collection
of 11 songs from Twyla Tharp's modern
dance production, is downright.. .well,
pretty.
This is not to say Byrne has complete-
Jy abandoned his Talking Heads-Brian
Eno style; he still cranks out plenty of
that to keep any dedicated Heads fan
satisfied. It's just that Byrne has added a
healthy measure of grace. Listening,
One can actually imagine dancers mov
ing languidly across a stage.
This is an important step for Byrne.
While not foresaking his fellow Heads
completely (they claim another album
is in the making), Byrne has taken his
undisputed songwriting expertise and
removed it from the all-too-strict con
<> fines of your basic "rock and roll
album."
$ tTSome may say this has been Byrne's
J Jferte all along. Granted, that might be
gjtrtie. However, The Catherine Wheel,
* |h my mind, is the first time he has "es
i caped" rock and roll's boundaries and
| made it sound so nice. The Catherine
j: Wheel is, as expected, a collection of
i sounds, sometimes splendidly melodic,
» sometimes a little sparse and jagged.

As such, The Catherine Wheel is
probably not a record to put on your
turntable and listen to at a party (well,
some parties, maybe. . .). Rather, David
Byrne fans will probably get most en
joyment from listening to it on their
own. Get my drift?
Side one opens with "His Wife Re
fused," a track which makes it clear that
Byrne sill has a talent for strangely dis
tant social commentary:
A great big house with nothing in it
He comes home says "Now wait a
minute"
He's comin in, she's goin out
He turns around says, "What's that
about?"
Do what they like, the kid's in school
Think she don't know, now, who's
kidding who?
He turns around says "Who wants to
/enow?"
Open the door and there's nobody
home!
sings Byrne over a thumping bass and
something called a gung gong.
The album's second cut, "Two Sol
diers," is arguably the album's worst.
The only song Eno helped write, it bogs
down about half way through. And
there are no Byrne lyrics to salvage it.
But from there, things get much bet
ter. "The Red House" is a pleasing in
strumental, rendered unusual by Eno's
"prophet scream," whatever that is.
And the following cut, "My Big Hands

(Fall Through The Cracks)," is Byrne
electro-psycho-punko-funk at its best.
"Big Business," theside's finaltrack,fol
lows immediately, predicting financial
bedlam over a frenzied African-in
fluenced beat.
Byrne opens side two with "Eggs In A
Briar Patch," a testament to his quirky
sense of humor. The vocals for this cut
are culled from what sounds like a
Southern radio preacher's broadcast,
and the tune is an unusual blend of
slow-motion, twisted funk.
"Eggs" segues promptly into
"Poison," which is hightlighted by a
clipped bass line and Byrne's character
istic wail. Next is "Cloud Chamber," an
instrumental played entirely on kitchen
untensils, which creates a spooky prel
ude for "What A Day That Was."
"What A Day ' is at once the album's
most chilling and most beautiful song.
As he sings the verses, Byrne sounds
confined and scared. On the chorus, he
loosens up, letting his voice soar. But in
truth, his words belie his voice — that is
his deception.
The album closes with "Big Blue
Plymouth (Eyes Wide Open)" and
"Light Bath." "Big Blue Plymouth" is
the closest the album comes to a Talk
ing Heads song. Byrne sings his chorus
with abandon, hiccuping freely like he
used to on his earlier albums. He
sounds like he's really having fun sing
ing this one, which is a stark contrast to
"Light Bath," a tender interplay be
tween John Chernoff's percussion and
Byrne's triggered flutes.
