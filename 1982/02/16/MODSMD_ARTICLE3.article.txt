# Industry sponsors new systems research center
## 
### Bill Beyda 
This is the first in a three-part series on the Uni
versity's new Center for Integrated Systems (CIS).
Part one focuses on the goals of CIS > part two will
examine its unique sponsorship by industry and
part three will describe the physical facility to be
built.
Construction is scheduled to start this spring on
the Center for Integrated Systems (CIS), which will
house electrical engineers, computer scientists
and material scientists under one roof. CIS has
nearly $20 million committed to the new facility,
which will be enough to cover the $14 million con
struction cost and provide initial funds for re
search.
The CIS building will be located at the site of
Ventura Hall, which will be physically moved to
another location on campus from the corner of Via
Palou and Campus Drive. Presently, CIS uses facil
ities in the McCullough Building, the Applied Elec
tronics Research Lab, the Electronics Research Lab,
the Durand Building and Margaret Jacks Hall.
"The new facility will be a central node, con
nected to other nodes on campus, for integrated
systems research," said John Linvill, co-director of

CIS and professor of electrical engineering here.
Integrated circuits are electronic devices that
contain hundreds of thousands of circuit elements
on chips much smaller than a dime. "Today we can
put a million circuit elements in the space that it
took to put one 20 years ago," Linvill said.
The small size of the chips requires special facil
ites for fabrication, which are presently housed in
the McCullough building. Other aspects of the de
sign, such as programming, are carried out in other
campus locations, said Linvill.
The existing labs on campus will not be closed
down, Linvill said, "though some may be shifting
the focus of their research somewhat as certain
projects move into the new facility."
The center has presently signed up 17 industrial
sponsors, each of which which will pay $250,000 a
year for three years, and has an $8 million contract
from the Defense Advance Projects Agency of the
Department of Defense, Linvill said. In return, the
industrial sponsors will receive office space and
guaranteed (but not exclusive) access to the licens
ing of discoveries made at CIS.
Integrated systems research involves many de
partments here, including electrical engineering,

computer science and materials science. CIS will
enable integrated circuit designers and computer
systems designers to work in one facility, and
project planners hope the synthesis of minds will
prove valuable, both educationally and in advanc
ing research.
The sponsorship by industry is a new idea in the
academic world, where most scientific research
grants come from the federal government. "If we
are successful," Linvill said, "the impact on univer
sities will be as large as when the federal govern
ment first began intense support of research after
World War II."
CIS expects to turn out 100 masters students and
30 Ph.D.s a year, trained in all aspects of the new
