Lower tax for new investments
Washington — Three major industries — automobiles, transportation
and mining — will pay no tax on income from new investments this year
and will receive what amounts to a tax subsidy for past investments un
der the 1981 tax bill, according to studies by the Treasury Department
and the Council of Economic Advisers.
The studies, contained in the Economic Report of the president, ap
pear to at least partially confirm two major criticisms of the 1901 tax bill:
that it went beyond eliminating the corporate tax on new investments
and created negative tax rates on new investments, and that it increased
the distortion of tax rates between major industries.
According to the studies:
The tax bill last year gave corporations a negative tax rate on income
from construction machinery, industrial equipment and vehicles rang
ing from minus 14 percent to minus 18 percent. By 1986, the negative tax
rate on construction machinery will fall to minus 82 percent.
The tax bill actually increases the distortion of tax rates on income
from major capital investments. In 1979, the rates ranged from plus 34
percent on machinery to plus 56 percent on industrial buildings, a dif
ference of 22 percent. In 1986, the rate on machinery will be minus 82
percent, while on buildings it will be plus 37 percent, a spread of 119
percent.
Economists contend these kinds of differences distort investment pat
terns and reduce productivity, a claim the economic report partially
backs when it states: "These differential rates of taxation at the industry
level will probably lead to relatively more investment in industries with
lower tax rates."
"If you ask whether the combination of the investment tax credit and
the new depreciation schedule creates some curious results, the answer
is yes," a spokesman for the Council of Economic Advisers said.
