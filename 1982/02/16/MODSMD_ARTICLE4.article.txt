Lower tax for new investments
Washington — Three major industries — automobiles, transportation
and mining — will pay no tax on income from new investments this year
and will receive what amounts to a tax subsidy for past investments un
der the 1981 tax bill, according to studies by the Treasury Department
and the Council of Economic Advisers.
The studies, contained in the Economic Report of the president, ap
pear to at least partially confirm two major criticisms of the 1901 tax bill:
that it went beyond eliminating the corporate tax on new investments
and created negative tax rates on new investments, and that it increased
the distortion of tax rates between major industries.
According to the studies:
The tax bill last year gave corporations a negative tax rate on income
from construction machinery, industrial equipment and vehicles rang
ing from minus 14 percent to minus 18 percent. By 1986, the negative tax
rate on construction machinery will fall to minus 82 percent.
The tax bill actually increases the distortion of tax rates on income
from major capital investments. In 1979, the rates ranged from plus 34
percent on machinery to plus 56 percent on industrial buildings, a dif
ference of 22 percent. In 1986, the rate on machinery will be minus 82
percent, while on buildings it will be plus 37 percent, a spread of 119
percent.
Economists contend these kinds of differences distort investment pat
terns and reduce productivity, a claim the economic report partially
backs when it states: "These differential rates of taxation at the industry
level will probably lead to relatively more investment in industries with
lower tax rates."
"If you ask whether the combination of the investment tax credit and
the new depreciation schedule creates some curious results, the answer
is yes," a spokesman for the Council of Economic Advisers said.
According to the Congressional Budget Of
fice, corporate taxes will drop by a total of $127
billion through 1986, and the share of federal
revenues produced from the tax will drop from
10 percent last year to 7.8 percent in 1986.
Soviet ship sinking
Halifax, Nova Scotia — A Soviet freighter with
37 people aboard was reported sinking early
this morning in the stormy North Atlantic 65
miles east of the area where the oil rig Ocean
Ranger and its crew of 84 men were lost the day
before.
Ships and a plane dispatched to help the ship
were not expected on the scene before day
light.
The Search and Rescue Co-ordination Center
reported the 4262-ton container ship Mekhanik
Tarasov was listing 45 degrees. One report said
the ship's cargo shifted, causing the list.
"She's in a very bad way/' a spokesman at the
rescue center said. "With a list like that, it's a
wonder she's even still afloat."
Two ships, the Canadian Coast Guard's Sir
Humphrey Gilbert and the Soviet fishing vessel
Tolbachik, were en route to the sceneabout 240
miles east of Newfoundland. But at 1 a.m. EST
the rescue center said they were not expected
to reach the Mekhanik 1 arasov for at least three
hours.
The Gilbert was diverted from the search for
survivors from the oil rig after all 84 men had
been given up for lost. A third ship sent to aid
the Mekhanik Tarasov broke down and had to
give up the attempt, the rescue center said.
Israel urges 'no sale' to Jordan
Jerusalem — Its anger at Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger soothed somewhat by
calming words from Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig, Israel urged the United States yes
terday to refuse to sell advanced warplanes and
anti-aircraft missiles to Jordan.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said the
sale, suggested by Weinberger during a visit to
Aman last week, would be a breach of President
Reagan's promise to preserve Israel's edge in
military quality over its Arab foes.
But the tone of the debate in the Israeli par
liament was far less angry than the initial reac
tion to remarks by a senior official in the Wein
berger party — widely believed in Israel to have
been the secretary himself — that the United

States would adopt a tougher line toward Israel
as part of a policy to promote U.S. friendship
with moderate Arab states.
Israeli officials were particularly angered by
the official's comment that U.S. policy would no

Reagan murder count wrong?
Washington — A United Nations human
rights official said political murders in El
Salvador last year were about double the
number the Reagan administration has cited in
telling Congress that the Salvadoran junta has
improved its human rights record.
Jose Pastor-Ridruejo, the U.N. Human Rights
Commission's special representative on El
Salvador, said a report he will submit to a U.N.
meeting in Geneva later this month puts the
number of assassinations at 11,000 for the first 11
months of 1981.
In a telephone interview from his home in
Madrid, Spain, Pastor-Ridruejo said he "found
that there is a consistent pattern of human
rights violations in El Salvador — most violations
coming from the military and rightist groups
but some violations coming from guerrillas."
The report contradicts the administration's
assertion that the number of political murders
in El Salvador was cut from 9000 in 1980 to about
6000 inl9Bl.
Last month, President Ronald Reagan
certified that the junta was "making a con
certed and significant effort to comply with in
ternationally recognized human rights" — a re
quirement that Congress demanded for El
Salvador to continue to got U.S. military aid.
Administration officials cited the lower death
toll, compiled by the U.S. Embassy in San
Salvador, to buttressthe president's claim. Most
human rights groups, including Amnesty In
ternational, have challenged the adminis
tration's assertion of any human rights improve
ment.
Housing subsidies cut
Washington — The nation's decimated hous
ing industries got equal doses of two kinds of
news in the administration's proposed fiscal
1983 budget: bad and worse.
The bad news was that the proposed budget
entails sharp cutbacks in federally subsidized
housing and in housing credit programs.
But even worse news for those wanting to
buy, sell or build homes this year is in the parts
of the budget that do not deal directly with

housing — those that contain the deficit and
federal borrowing figures.
Both are at all-time highs, putting a strain on
the country's credit markets and likely to keep
interest rates up. The housing industries have
been hoping for a break in interest rates, con
sidered essential to a true housing recovery.
The main administration housing proposal is
to stop construction of new rental apartments
for low-income families — and to recapture
money previously authorized for some 700,000
units that have not yet been started — and re
place this with a system of housing "vouchers"
to go directly to individual families.
Clean Air Act revised
Washington — The Reagan administration,
engaged in a bitter fight with environmentalists
over how clean the air should be, is about to
launch a second front along the country's
rivers, lakes and streams.
The first battle involves extending and revis
ing the Clean Air Act and has been raging in
Congress for more than a year. Now the admin
istration is drafting changes it would like Con
gress to make in the Clean Water Act.
The revisions being considered would sub
stantially revamp the 10-year-old law by delay
ing deadlines and loosening industry clean-up
standards.
But the administration, burned by the outcry
its air revisions generated, is going out of its way
to characterize its water rewrite as a modest,
mid-course correction.
Anne Gorsuch, head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, described the law as "fun
damentally sound" and told members of Con
gress, "We intend to suggest changes only in
those few areas where obvious statutory prob
lems have emerged."
Environmentalists see the proposals dif

are being questioned by the administration,"

Lower tax for new investments
Washington — Three major industries — automobiles, transportation
and mining — will pay no tax on income from new investments this year
and will receive what amounts to a tax subsidy for past investments un
der the 1981 tax bill, according to studies by the Treasury Department
and the Council of Economic Advisers.
The studies, contained in the Economic Report of the president, ap
pear to at least partially confirm two major criticisms of the 1901 tax bill:
that it went beyond eliminating the corporate tax on new investments
and created negative tax rates on new investments, and that it increased
the distortion of tax rates between major industries.
According to the studies:
The tax bill last year gave corporations a negative tax rate on income
from construction machinery, industrial equipment and vehicles rang
ing from minus 14 percent to minus 18 percent. By 1986, the negative tax
rate on construction machinery will fall to minus 82 percent.
The tax bill actually increases the distortion of tax rates on income
from major capital investments. In 1979, the rates ranged from plus 34
percent on machinery to plus 56 percent on industrial buildings, a dif
ference of 22 percent. In 1986, the rate on machinery will be minus 82
percent, while on buildings it will be plus 37 percent, a spread of 119
percent.
Economists contend these kinds of differences distort investment pat
terns and reduce productivity, a claim the economic report partially
backs when it states: "These differential rates of taxation at the industry
level will probably lead to relatively more investment in industries with
lower tax rates."
"If you ask whether the combination of the investment tax credit and
the new depreciation schedule creates some curious results, the answer
is yes," a spokesman for the Council of Economic Advisers said.
According to the Congressional Budget Of
fice, corporate taxes will drop by a total of $127
billion through 1986, and the share of federal
revenues produced from the tax will drop from
10 percent last year to 7.8 percent in 1986.
Soviet ship sinking
Halifax, Nova Scotia — A Soviet freighter with
37 people aboard was reported sinking early
this morning in the stormy North Atlantic 65
miles east of the area where the oil rig Ocean
Ranger and its crew of 84 men were lost the day
before.
Ships and a plane dispatched to help the ship
were not expected on the scene before day
light.
The Search and Rescue Co-ordination Center
reported the 4262-ton container ship Mekhanik
Tarasov was listing 45 degrees. One report said
the ship's cargo shifted, causing the list.
"She's in a very bad way/' a spokesman at the
rescue center said. "With a list like that, it's a
wonder she's even still afloat."
Two ships, the Canadian Coast Guard's Sir
Humphrey Gilbert and the Soviet fishing vessel
Tolbachik, were en route to the sceneabout 240
miles east of Newfoundland. But at 1 a.m. EST
the rescue center said they were not expected
to reach the Mekhanik 1 arasov for at least three
hours.
The Gilbert was diverted from the search for
survivors from the oil rig after all 84 men had
been given up for lost. A third ship sent to aid
the Mekhanik Tarasov broke down and had to
give up the attempt, the rescue center said.

Reagan murder count wrong?
Washington — A United Nations human
rights official said political murders in El
Salvador last year were about double the
number the Reagan administration has cited in
telling Congress that the Salvadoran junta has
improved its human rights record.
Jose Pastor-Ridruejo, the U.N. Human Rights
Commission's special representative on El
Salvador, said a report he will submit to a U.N.
meeting in Geneva later this month puts the
number of assassinations at 11,000 for the first 11
months of 1981.
In a telephone interview from his home in
Madrid, Spain, Pastor-Ridruejo said he "found
that there is a consistent pattern of human
rights violations in El Salvador — most violations
coming from the military and rightist groups
but some violations coming from guerrillas."
The report contradicts the administration's
assertion that the number of political murders
in El Salvador was cut from 9000 in 1980 to about
6000 inl9Bl.
Last month, President Ronald Reagan
certified that the junta was "making a con
certed and significant effort to comply with in
ternationally recognized human rights" — a re
quirement that Congress demanded for El
Salvador to continue to got U.S. military aid.
Administration officials cited the lower death
toll, compiled by the U.S. Embassy in San
Salvador, to buttressthe president's claim. Most
human rights groups, including Amnesty In

Housing subsidies cut
Washington — The nation's decimated hous
ing industries got equal doses of two kinds of
news in the administration's proposed fiscal
1983 budget: bad and worse.
The bad news was that the proposed budget
entails sharp cutbacks in federally subsidized
housing and in housing credit programs.
But even worse news for those wanting to
buy, sell or build homes this year is in the parts
of the budget that do not deal directly with

housing — those that contain the deficit and
federal borrowing figures.
Both are at all-time highs, putting a strain on
the country's credit markets and likely to keep
interest rates up. The housing industries have
been hoping for a break in interest rates, con
sidered essential to a true housing recovery.
The main administration housing proposal is
to stop construction of new rental apartments

money previously authorized for some 700,000
units that have not yet been started — and re

meeting in Geneva later this month puts the
number of assassinations at 11,000 for the first 11
months of 1981.
In a telephone interview from his home in
Madrid, Spain, Pastor-Ridruejo said he "found
that there is a consistent pattern of human
rights violations in El Salvador — most violations
coming from the military and rightist groups
but some violations coming from guerrillas."
The report contradicts the administration's
assertion that the number of political murders
in El Salvador was cut from 9000 in 1980 to about
6000 inl9Bl.
Last month, President Ronald Reagan
certified that the junta was "making a con
certed and significant effort to comply with in
ternationally recognized human rights" — a re
quirement that Congress demanded for El
Salvador to continue to got U.S. military aid.
Administration officials cited the lower death
toll, compiled by the U.S. Embassy in San

Housing subsidies cut
Washington — The nation's decimated hous
ing industries got equal doses of two kinds of
news in the administration's proposed fiscal
1983 budget: bad and worse.
The bad news was that the proposed budget
entails sharp cutbacks in federally subsidized
housing and in housing credit programs.
But even worse news for those wanting to
buy, sell or build homes this year is in the parts
of the budget that do not deal directly with

housing — those that contain the deficit and
federal borrowing figures.
Both are at all-time highs, putting a strain on
the country's credit markets and likely to keep
interest rates up. The housing industries have
been hoping for a break in interest rates, con
sidered essential to a true housing recovery.
The main administration housing proposal is
to stop construction of new rental apartments
for low-income families — and to recapture
money previously authorized for some 700,000
units that have not yet been started — and re
place this with a system of housing "vouchers"
to go directly to individual families.
Clean Air Act revised
Washington — The Reagan administration,
engaged in a bitter fight with environmentalists
over how clean the air should be, is about to
launch a second front along the country's
rivers, lakes and streams.
The first battle involves extending and revis
ing the Clean Air Act and has been raging in
Congress for more than a year. Now the admin
istration is drafting changes it would like Con
gress to make in the Clean Water Act.
The revisions being considered would sub
stantially revamp the 10-year-old law by delay
ing deadlines and loosening industry clean-up
standards.
But the administration, burned by the outcry
its air revisions generated, is going out of its way
to characterize its water rewrite as a modest,
mid-course correction.
Anne Gorsuch, head of the Environmental
Protection Agency, described the law as "fun
damentally sound" and told members of Con
gress, "We intend to suggest changes only in
those few areas where obvious statutory prob
lems have emerged."
Environmentalists see the proposals dif
ferently.

Lower tax for new investments
Washington — Three major industries — automobiles, transportation
and mining — will pay no tax on income from new investments this year
and will receive what amounts to a tax subsidy for past investments un
der the 1981 tax bill, according to studies by the Treasury Department
and the Council of Economic Advisers.
The studies, contained in the Economic Report of the president, ap
pear to at least partially confirm two major criticisms of the 1901 tax bill:
that it went beyond eliminating the corporate tax on new investments
and created negative tax rates on new investments, and that it increased
the distortion of tax rates between major industries.
According to the studies:
The tax bill last year gave corporations a negative tax rate on income
from construction machinery, industrial equipment and vehicles rang
ing from minus 14 percent to minus 18 percent. By 1986, the negative tax
rate on construction machinery will fall to minus 82 percent.
The tax bill actually increases the distortion of tax rates on income
from major capital investments. In 1979, the rates ranged from plus 34
percent on machinery to plus 56 percent on industrial buildings, a dif
ference of 22 percent. In 1986, the rate on machinery will be minus 82
percent, while on buildings it will be plus 37 percent, a spread of 119
percent.
Economists contend these kinds of differences distort investment pat
terns and reduce productivity, a claim the economic report partially
backs when it states: "These differential rates of taxation at the industry
level will probably lead to relatively more investment in industries with
lower tax rates."
"If you ask whether the combination of the investment tax credit and
the new depreciation schedule creates some curious results, the answer
is yes," a spokesman for the Council of Economic Advisers said.
According to the Congressional Budget Of
fice, corporate taxes will drop by a total of $127
billion through 1986, and the share of federal
revenues produced from the tax will drop from
10 percent last year to 7.8 percent in 1986.
Soviet ship sinking
Halifax, Nova Scotia — A Soviet freighter with
37 people aboard was reported sinking early
this morning in the stormy North Atlantic 65
miles east of the area where the oil rig Ocean
Ranger and its crew of 84 men were lost the day
before.
Ships and a plane dispatched to help the ship
were not expected on the scene before day
light.
The Search and Rescue Co-ordination Center
reported the 4262-ton container ship Mekhanik
Tarasov was listing 45 degrees. One report said
the ship's cargo shifted, causing the list.
"She's in a very bad way/' a spokesman at the
rescue center said. "With a list like that, it's a
wonder she's even still afloat."
Two ships, the Canadian Coast Guard's Sir
Humphrey Gilbert and the Soviet fishing vessel
Tolbachik, were en route to the sceneabout 240
miles east of Newfoundland. But at 1 a.m. EST
the rescue center said they were not expected
to reach the Mekhanik 1 arasov for at least three
hours.
The Gilbert was diverted from the search for
survivors from the oil rig after all 84 men had
been given up for lost. A third ship sent to aid
the Mekhanik Tarasov broke down and had to
give up the attempt, the rescue center said.
Israel urges 'no sale' to Jordan
Jerusalem — Its anger at Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger soothed somewhat by
calming words from Secretary of State Alex
ander Haig, Israel urged the United States yes
terday to refuse to sell advanced warplanes and
anti-aircraft missiles to Jordan.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin said the
sale, suggested by Weinberger during a visit to
Aman last week, would be a breach of President
Reagan's promise to preserve Israel's edge in
military quality over its Arab foes.
But the tone of the debate in the Israeli par
liament was far less angry than the initial reac
tion to remarks by a senior official in the Wein
berger party — widely believed in Israel to have
been the secretary himself — that the United

States would adopt a tougher line toward Israel
as part of a policy to promote U.S. friendship
with moderate Arab states.
Israeli officials were particularly angered by
the official's comment that U.S. policy would no
longer be "held hostage to Israel."
Reagan murder count wrong?
Washington — A United Nations human
rights official said political murders in El
Salvador last year were about double the
number the Reagan administration has cited in
telling Congress that the Salvadoran junta has
improved its human rights record.
Jose Pastor-Ridruejo, the U.N. Human Rights
Commission's special representative on El
Salvador, said a report he will submit to a U.N.
meeting in Geneva later this month puts the
number of assassinations at 11,000 for the first 11
months of 1981.

Madrid, Spain, Pastor-Ridruejo said he "found
