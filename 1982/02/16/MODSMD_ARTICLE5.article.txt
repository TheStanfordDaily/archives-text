# McCloskey to toss hat in Senate ring today

### Richard Zimler 
Rep. Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-
Menlo Park), who is expected to of
ficially announce his candidacy for
the U.S. Senate today, added some
more money to his campaign coffers
Thursday night before 200 guests at a
$300-a-person dinner at Trader Vic's
in San Francisco.
A similar fundraiser held two
weeks ago in Los Angeles brought in
$120,000, and at that time raised the
total amount of contributions to
$925,000. The amount netted from
Thursday's dinner has not yet been
released by McCloskey officials.
McCloskey will file petitions in
three appearances in San Mateo,
Merced and Fresno counties today as
part of his official announcement.
McCloskey announced at Thurs
day's dinner that Ron Smith will be
taking over from Patrick Shea as his
campaign manager. Smith, who had
previously been with Sen. S.I. Hay
akawa (R-Calif.), was one of the
architects of McCloskey's successful
1974 campaign for the House.

The substitution was an amicable
one for all concerned, according to
McCloskey. He said that Shea had
taken a leave from his San Diego law
firm and was now committed to re
turn. "Pat came aboard with us for
four months. If he were willing to stay
until June, he would (remain) cam
paign manager."
Asked about President Ronald
Reagan's proposed 1983 budget and
its $100 billion deficit, McCloskey
said that defense cuts will have to be
made. "The president is going to
have to give considerably to get so
cial cuts," he said. "We're going to
have to accept some defense cuts
and social cuts. I will vote for both."
McCloskey said that the recent
Field poll showing him tied for sec
ond in the Senate race at 18 percent,
behind Barry Goldwater Jr.'s 34 per
cent, had helped fundraising efforts.
He also expected the addition of
David Packard, co-founder of
Hewlett-Packard, as head of fundrais
ing, to inspire support from the fi
nancial community.
