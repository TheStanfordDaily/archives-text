# Heart-lung recipient dies

The most recent patient to recieve
a heart-lung transplant at the Univer
sity Medical Center died Friday. Doc
tors disconnected her from life sup
port systems after they found no evi
dence of brain activity for three days.
The patient, Nancy Lassen, a 26-
year-old nurse from Nebraska, had
been in a coma since Feb. 4. She was
the sixth person to undergo a heart
lung transplant operation at the Med
Center.
Michael Goodkind, spokesman for
the Med Center, said that an autopsy,
which will not be completed for six
weeks, is underway to determine the
cause of death.
"She had a lot of liver and kidney
problems and they don't know if
these things are related to the coma,"
Goodkind said. He added that her in
itial heart and lung problems led to
many secondary problems, including
inadequately functioning kidneys.
In order to be eligible for the high
risk heart-lung operation a patient
has to be "almost facing virtual
death," he said. Without the opera
tion, according to Goodkin, Lassen
would have faced death within a few
weeks.
He said the program is continuing
and that there are two people waiting
for donors to be located so that they
can undergo a heart-lung transplant.
Donors are difficult to find, he said,
because a donor must be dead but
have heart and lungs in working or
der.
"It takes months to find a donor,"
Goodkind said, adding that the best
source of donors are motorcycle
crash victims because they are likely
to have died from head injuries.
The autopsy will take six weeks, ac
cording to Goodkin, because it is
being done on the brain, a process
which requires chemicals to settle for
six weeks.
Lassen is the second person to die
following the heart-lung transplant
operation. The other four patients
are doing well following their opera
tions.
