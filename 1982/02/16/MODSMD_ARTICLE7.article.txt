Prof. Emeritus William
Shockley, a Nobel prize-winner
who stirs controversy with his the
ory that blacks are genetically in
ferior to whites, has announced
plans to seek the Republican nom
ination for the U.S. Senate.
Shockley, 72, announced his
decision to run on Wednesday
and has taken out papers to run
for the Senate seat presently held
by S.I. Hayakawa, who has de
cided not to seek reelection. In a
phone interview from his Stanford
home, Shockley said he is running
to promote his scientific theories
on dysgenicsand related matters.
In a prepared statement,
Shockley said his inclusion in the
June 8 primary "will contribute, in
particular, to the enlightenment
of the other candidates and of the
public about the threat of dys
genics and the degree of sup
pression of objective inquiry of
discussion on this and related mat
ters."
Dysgenics is the "retrogressive,
or backwards, evolution caused
by excessive reproduction of the
genetically disadvantaged,"

Shockley said. It has been his "ex
ploration of lower social per
formance" which he has typically
espoused while saying blacks are
genetically inferior, a situation
which is hereditary and is not "re
medial to a major degree by prac
tical improvements in the en
vironment," he said.
Shockley was an engineering
professor at the University for 12
years. In 1956 he was a co-winner
of the Nobel Prize in physics for
