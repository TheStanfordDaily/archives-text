# Stanford will get first NMR spectrometer in U.S.
## 
### Laurence Band 
The first nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spec
trometer in the United States,
will be built for Stanford with a
$660,000 grant from the Na
tional Institutes of Health.
Based on a persistent super
conducting magnet, "This 600
megahertz (MHz) machine will
represent almost a two-fold in

crease in power over the next
largest spectrometer of its kind
at Stanford," according to Dr.
Oleg Jardetzky, professor of
pharmacology and director of
the Stanford Magnetic Reso
nance Laboratory.
NMR spectroscopy is "a
form of spectroscopy which is
based on the absorption of ra
dio frequency radiation by nu
clei placed in a magneticfield,"
said Jardetzky. "The character
istics of the lines that result are
sensitive to the molecular
structure of the sample."
This new spectrometer, ac

cording to Jardetzky, will have
two major advantages over the
older, less powerful models.
The first advantage will be bet
ter resolution of the character
istic lines the spectrometer
produces. Better resolution re
sults because differences in
chemical shifts (the distance
between characteristic lines)
are proportional to the intensi
ty of the magnetic field. The
600 MHz spectrometer will em
ploy the largest magnet of nec
essary stability and
homogeneity to be put in an
NMR machine.

The second advantage will
be increased sensitivity due to
the high operating frequency
of the spectrometer. This is sig
nificant because molecules can
be examined in much lower
concentrations.
While NMR spectrometers
may be used for both labora
tory and diagnostic work, this
machine will be usedexclusive
ly for laboratory applications,
mostly in the fields of
chemistryand biochemistry ac
cording to Jardetzky . More
specifically, jardetzky said that
scientists would be using it to

study mechanisms of enzyme
action, structure of binding
sites of enzymes and anti
bodies, and mechanisms of in
formation transfer through
protein structures.
The spectrometer will be de
livered here by Japan Elec
tronics Laboratories, and is ten
tatively scheduled to be oper
ating in April of next year. It
will be available to selected re
searchers from all over the
country, subject to an applica
tion process conducted by the
Stanford Magnetic Resonance
Laboratory. Jardetzkv said the

spectrometer will operate on a
24 hours per day.
JardetzkyandC.C.K. Roberts
have recently written a book —
NMR in Molecular Biology —
which is "the first com
prehensive summary of what
high-resolution NMR has con
tributed to molecular biology
in the 25 years the field has ex
isted," said Jardetzky.
Written primarily for the ad
vanced student or practicing
scientist, the book also sum
marizes what can be done us
ing nuclear magnetic reso
nance spectroscopy.
