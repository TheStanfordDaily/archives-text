# Students protest Reagan's policies toward El Salvador
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
As many as 40 students gathered in a "silent vigil" in
White Plaza for more than 45 minutes yesterday, creating
a contrast to the usual lunchtime bustle as they protested
President Ronald Reagan's policies in Central America.
While the Stanford Central American Action Network
(SCAAN) has organized three "street actions" protesting
the situation in El Salvador since the beginning of the ac
ademic year, yesterday's demonstration arose inde
pendently of SCAAN, according to Matt Nicodemus,
who helped organize the vigil. Nicodemus said "Rea
gan's Tough Plan for Central America," an article which
appeared in Monday's San Francisco Chronicle,
prompted yesterday's reaction.
Among the measures the Chronicle reported Reagan
approved are: additional economic support to Central
American countries estimated to total $250 million; addi
tional military assistance to El Salvador and Honduras;
U.S. training for Salvadoran troops in this country and in
El Salvador; and increased U.S. intelligence activity in
Central America. These sanctions are reportedly de
signed to hamper Cuban-Nicaraguan arms supply lines
to guerrilla forces in El Salvador.
"(By) supplying military equipment that is used to
slaughter civilians in El Salvador, the United States is just

as responsible and guilty for that slaughter as the El
Salvadoran troops that are using that equipment," Nico
demus said. "We are carrying on an undeclared war in El
Salvador."
Martial law was declared in El Salvador over two years
ago. Claiming that without aid El Salvador's military gov
ernment would be overrun by Communist- supported
guerrillas, the United States sent a total of $63 million in
economic and military aid last year. The U.S. has also dis
patched 56 military advisors to El Salvador.
"I get more and more fed up every time I read the pa
per," said Dunny Gifford, a sophomore who participated
in the vigil. "I get the feeling that the Reagan adminis
tration is pulling the wool over the public's eyes (regard
ing what is going on in El Salvador)."
"I'm mostly here because I'm angry," said senior Leah
Halper, as she handed out leaflets which described the
vigil's purpose and included reprints of the Chronicle
article. "(I see) the potential for atrocity that the Reagan
administration could perpetrate in Latin America."
Nicodemus said he hoped the vigil would raise the
consciousness of the Stanford community. Either the
United States government is underestimating the Ameri
can public's capacity for protest, he said, or the govern
ment knows the American public will allow the current
Central American situation to continue.
