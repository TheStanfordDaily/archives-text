Cohoes, N.Y. (AP) — Bat
talions of sale-crazed shoppers
laid siege to a discount store in
this aging textile-mill city Mon
day, engaging other bargain
hunters in hand-to-hand com
bat after the doors opened for
a Washington's Birthday sale.
"It's total chaos. There's
women fighting with each oth
er, women grabbing the same
handbags and belting each
other," said Police Sgt. Jim
Young, who was standing duty
at Cohoes Specialty Stores Ltd.
The excitement was stirred
by leather blouson jackets by
Kenar for $79 ("nationally ad
vertised at $290"), Capraro
dresses for $23 (down from
$238), and $11 Halston metallic
handbags, once $150-$l7O,
among other sale items.
Hundreds of women and a
few men, looking out of place,
began to queue up in the cold
before dawn. By the end of the
day bargain hunters were ex
pected to have doubled the
population of this city of 19,000
north of Albany where the
Hudson and Mohawk rivers
meet.
Young said five off-duty of
ficers were hired to back upthe
store's regular security force in
patrolling the mammoth sale.
Cohoes, which sells name
brand and designer clothes for
men and women, normally of
fers a wide range of goods at
prices 20 percent to 30 percent
lower than traditional retail,
according to Ben Ames, the
store's vice chairman.

But prices really plummet on
Washington's birthday.
Darlene Levy, 21, of Lake
Grove'on Long Island, spent
the weekend at a former col
lege roommate's house in
nearby Waterford so she could
get in line at 5:30 a.m.
Last year, Levy said, she got a
$660 three-piece Oscar de la
Renta suit for $29, and in the
process "I got knocked down.
But I'm back for more."
.Profits in the modern, 50,000
square foot, two-level store in
the downtown shopping area
are based on "volume and
watching our expense struc
ture. That's one of the reasons
we're not in a high-priced
mall," said Sanford Zim
merman, the store's chairman.
"Making it worth our while
does not mean making a prof
it," added Margery Lapp, coor
dinator for advertising and
promotion. "Clearing out is
important in this business too.
You don't want all that old
merchandise lying around."
"Washington's Birthday ...
the only way I can describe it is
. . . madness," said Lapp. "Peo
ple line their arms with Etienne
Aigner purses and then sit on
the floor and start bartering."
The lines were so long by the
time the store opened last year
that some customers couldn't
get in until noon.
By early afternoon Monday,
Lapp said it was "elbow-to
elbow" on the sales floor, with
a good crowd still waiting out
side.
