# Human reasoning not infallible — Simon
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Classical models of human decision
making which claim that human beings
maximize their utility have gotten it all
wrong.
The market may be a good mecha
nism for limiting the number of de
cisions each individual has to make but
it does not optimize social decisions,
according to Herbert Simon, professor
of computer sciences and psychology at
Carnegie-Mellon University. Simon
won the Nobel Prize in economics in
1978.
Simon delivered the 14th Harry Camp
Memorial Lectures last week with the
provocative title "Grappling with the
hard problems: the uses of reason in
human affairs." The three lectures,
which each night drew an overflowing
crowd at Annenberg Auditorium, were
attended by distinguished faculty from
a number of different departments and
included University President Donald
Kennedy, who introduced the speaker.
The large turnout was an indication
of the following Simon has built
through his interdisciplinary research
into reasoning processes that has
touched many fields including business
management, psychology and the
branch of computer science known as
artificial intelligence.
Making decisions that maximize each
individual's or corporation's utility has
been the corner stone of classical eco
nomic theory at least since Adam
Smith's invisible hand started to turn
each individual's selfish interests in the
market place into the good of society as
a whole. The trouble with the classical
economic model is that it assumes an
omniscient "economic man," accord-

ing to Simon.
It is this "Olympian" model — as Si
mon calls the clasical analysis of human
rationality — that Simon has been at
tacking since the 19405. In spite of the
Nobel Prize he received for his work, Si
mon has had mixed success in getting
his ideas accepted — especially among
economists who cling to ideas that are
often "mathematically attractive."
It is not that Simon advocates getting
rid of classical economics altogether:
"It is not a matter of throwing those
tools away but knowing when to use
them," Simon told the Daily in an in
terview. But usingthistypeof reasoning
model in macroeconomics and busi
ness cycle theory is, according to Simon
"inappropriate" because they have
"very little to do with the way people
form expectations."
The problem with the Olympian
model of rationality is that "humans are
unable to choose consistently in the
face of even moderate complexity and
uncertainty," Simon said.
Simon's model is of a bounded ra
tionality which describes human beings
as organisms with limited computa
tional ability.
Human rationality has evolved over a
long period of time in a relatively
simple environment where "little was
happening" and where problems could
be dealt with one at a time, he said. All
that was needed was a mechanism to
move more "urgent problems onto the
agenda." This mechanism is emotion.
A good portion of our creativity is
tied up with the emotions. Because
most cognition is what Simon describes
as "hot cognition," art and the human
ities are important for human innova

tion for placing a responsibility on ar
tists and writers they may not have lived
up to.
Another consequence of accepting
the bounded rationality theory in place
of the Olympian is that "Bounded ra
tionality does not optimize or guaran
tee consistency."
Both genetic evolution and human
reason solve complex problems of sur
vival. They do so by breaking problems
down into smaller and much more
manageable sub-problems.
The implications of this way of think
ing go beyond evolutionary theory.
When one discusses social decision
making, as Simon did in his last lecture,
this breaking down of problems into
sub-problems is done by institutions.
Simon is unhappy about the bad
press institutions have been getting and
is especially unhappy about the liber
tarian ideal of giving all decision-mak
ing power back to the individual —
"monads interacting through prices,"
he calls it.
Society is just too complex for letting
the market take care of everything, Si
mon said. Individuals are not equipped
to make the myriad of complex de
cisions that would be required of them
by modern society if they were not
made for them, Simon argues.
Bureaucracy is the other side of de
mocracy, he said. It is institutions that
make "even a modicum of rationality
possible."
Some economists like Milton Fried
man argue that it may not be so impor
tant how human beings make decisions
if they act "as if" they are maximizing
their utility, Simon said. The idea here is
that it is sufficient for the competitive

market place to weed out those firms
not well-adapted to the business en
vironment in a competition where only
the fittest survive.
Simon said he sees cultural adapta
tion as much more benign than the
tooth and claw model of Social
Darwinists that has been popular since
the 19th century.
Simon looks to the 19th century
French sociologist Emile Durkheim,
rather than to his Darwinian contem
poraries, for inspiration. If a system —
applied to species or business firms
— is to survive it can do it in one of two
ways, Simon said. It can compete suc
cessfully or specialize itself — to occupy
a niche not occupied by anything else.
The niche evolution theory is much
more complex. It emphasizes interac
tion between the environment and ge
netic or social evolution that is ignored
by the survival of the fittest theory.
"Evolution is a two-way street," Si
mon explained. As organisms fill niches
they open up new ones. "There were
very few niches for animals until many
niches had been filled with plants," Si
mon continued.
Perhaps the most important implica
tion of the "niche" theory for Simon, is
that altruism need not be thought of in
terms of selfish genes — a view that has
become popular among some
biologists and anthropologists.
The existence of altruism can be ex
plained in two ways, either as entirely
selfish — serving the interest of particu
lar genes — or altruism can develop in a
particular group because it makes the
lives of all individuals in that group
moreviable.
