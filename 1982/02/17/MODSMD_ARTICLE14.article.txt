## Jeffrey Golden Untethering the AT&T giant 
### 
"It's Gulliver's travels retold for the
79805. The Lilliputians, like the gov
ernment, controlled a big giant. But
one at a time, the strings began to fall
away. Now we are confronted by this
company with tremendous strength
and resources that has been dormant
for years and has at last broken free."

kerage
The stirring giant in this metaphor
is the American Telephone and Tele
graph Company, the largest corpo
ration in the world. Its assets are esti
mated at $137 billion, more than the
combined holdings of Exxon, Gener
al Motors, and U.S. Steel, and more
than the GNP of all but 20 countries
of the world.
The final "string" fell away last
month, when AT&T and the Justice
Department agreed to the settlement
of a seven-year-old anti-trust suit.
One provision gives AT&T what it has
been craving for years: free entry
into software and processing in
dustries that could supply the
awesomely complete hardware sys
tems that AT&T has developed as a
government-protected monopoly.
The exact terms of the agreement,
which isstill tentative, are socomplex
that most public officials and private
lobbyists are devoting a few weeks to
studying what it says before com
menting on what it means.
If the professionals are scratching
their heads over the consequences of
this new marriage, it's natural that
most of us are totally in the dark. But I
think we have to struggle to move
closer to the light, because AT&T has
relied on a certain amount of public
confusion to get to where it is today.
Partly because its domain is tech
nology, partly because its monopoly
status is so peculiar, partly because
news coverage over the years has
omitted crucial information, most
people uneasy about AT&T's growth
have despaired of clearly under
standing the issues. We have come to
accept the company's constant ex
pansion, like smog, as a fact of life.
This resigned stoicism has seeped
into government policy; a spokes
man for Justice's anti-trust division
said last year that AT&T is "just too

big to regulate."
How did it get that way? By moving
faster and pressing harder than any
one else when America reached the
electronicage. AT&T wasthe Hudson
Bay Company of tele
communications. It was the only
game in town when it became clear
that free-market competition would
not best serve the business of wiring
the nation, which called for up
recedented capital outlays and a uni
formity of standards and materials.
The government itself could have
taken on this colossal enterprise —
most governments do — but that was
not the way we were carving out. This
job called for a new economic
hybrid: a company privately owned
but publicly supported, whose single
customer — America — was eager,
generous, and constant.
Because AT&T was so industrious
and productive, the public subsidy it
enjoyed never had the look of chari
ty. The demand for its product was so
fierce that it needed no Chrysler
style handout. What it did need was a
steady public boost to lay the in
frastructure for successive new tech
nologies. So it was that a century ago,
AT&T tied its own wire to a hundred
thousand telegraph poles that were
set in place by army details or railroad
crews, through endlessly long rights
of-way secured and sometimes
pacified by the federal government.
And so it was that in 1962, AT&T
could launch Telstar, our first com
munications satellite. The company
paid for every last rivet in the final
vessel, but the billions of research
and development dollars that pre
ceded lift-off came from your pa
rents and mine, via the IRS and
NASA. And it was U.S. foreign aid
that largely financed the down-link
receivers around the world that
created Telstar's market. We have
been good to our telephone and tel
egraph — and satellite — company.
The media has been another chan
nel of AT&T's public subsidy. The
company had a foot in the door when
radio broke onto the scene, building
New York's WEAF, the first com
mercial radio station, in 1922. A few
broadcast pioneers began to wonder

out loud about the power available
to any company that controls both
the lines and content of communica
tion. So, in 1926, the company sold
WEAF to RCA for $1, million and,
more to the point, exclusive rights to
provide line transmission between
network stations.
That same right, enforced more by
the company's monopoly status than
by formal contracts, helped AT&T
complete its web of transmission
lines as television developed. The
company's $2 million charge to run
lines from the 1964 Democratic Con
vention in Atlantic City to CBS head
quarters in New York was typical.
Those dollars came from everyone
who bought products advertised dur
ing CBS's convention telecast. The
convention is ancient history, but the
Atlantic City/NYC link is still making
money for AT&T.
This tangible and lasting character
of AT&T's assets add to its unique
strength. The power of other corpo
rate interests might ebb and flow
over time as the nation's tastes and
needs change, but AT&T only moves
forward. Every advance is cast in cop
per and hard plastic. Whether or not
it yields a quick profit, every new link
adds to the structural strength of the
whole and enhances our depen
dence on the AT&T system.
And as our dependence increased,
so did AT&T's confidence that,
sooner or later, it would always get
what it wanted. In the 1950'5, govern
ment regulators wanted AT&T to give
up Western Electric, the company's
manufacturing arm; you'll find its
label stamped on the back of almost
any telephone. The struggle ended in
a 1956 consent decree that allowed
the company to keep everything it
owned in return for a promise not to
enter the new field opened by the
birth of computer technology.
Many thought that AT&T's promise
was worth considerably less than the
profits of Western Electric. There
were grumblings that AT&T's satellite
entry violated the 1956 agreement,
but our rush to challenge the Soviets
in space precluded government ac
tion.
AT&T waited patiently, steadily less

concerned with hiding its views on
the 1956 promise. The company's
1980 stockholder's report was clear
on the subject:
"No longer do we perceive that
our business will be limited to tele
phony, or, for that matter, tele
communications. Ours is the busi
ness of information handling, the
knowledge business, and the market
we seek is global."
Last year the waiting ended. An ad
ministration took office pledging to
get government off the backs of "the
people." Last month's settlement was
another lesson in what that means.
The price that AT&T paid in 1956 to
keep its empire intact, its solemn
promise, was refunded in full. The
company will bring its full resources,
amassed over a century of monopoly
privilege, to what could be the big
gest game of all: the assembly, proc
essing, and transmission of informa
tion.
Unlike the 1956 decree, the settle
ment actually cost AT&T something.
It has agreed to sell its interest in 22
local telephone companies, includ
ing Pacific Telephone. AT&T has
moaned and sighed about the loss,
pointing out that local companies
comprise most of their total assets.
The noise is for show. AT&T's
stockholder's will receive shares in
the local companies that at least

equal the value of the stock they are
losing. And the localsare far less prof
itable than the pieces that AT&T re
tains. Left untouched are Western
Electric; Bell Telephone Labs, the
world's largest industrial research
center; and the long-distance facil
ities, which make so much money
that they subsidize local service. It is
the loss of that subsidy, in fact, and
the enormous jump in local phone
rates that is expected to result, that
has mobilized most of the political
opposition to the settlement; con
gressmen are anxious to go on record
as opposing a two- or three-fold rate
increase for the folks back home.
And even as AT&T's right hand is
waving good-bye to the locals, its left
is trying to grab off everything that
isn't nailed down. It wants ownership
of the Yellow Pages and the actual
telephone that you and I lease, the
two financial plums of local service.
"AT&T is about to run off with the
cookie jar," Rep. Ronald Mottl (D-
Ohio) said last month, "and leave the
crumbs behind to the local operating
companies."
Some believe that a leaner AT&T,
divested of local problems, will be
much better suited to dive into new
enterprises. In any case, as the
monopoly supplier of certain ser
vices to local companies that are
obliged to compete with one anoth

er, it can hardly lose. Everyone ex
cept AT&T publicists see the com
pany as the big winner in last month's
deal; one Connecticut consulting
firm estimates that AT&T will double
its annual revenues ($52 billion in
1980) within eight years.
I would have a problem with any
company making that much money,
even if it did so without special fa
vors, but that's just me. The real out
rage is that AT&T has been twice
paid. It grew money-rich at the same
time that it was allowed to amass the
hardware that connects virtually ev
ery home, office, shop, factory and
broadcast station in the country and
throughout much of the world.
This system could have been built
only through the graces of a pro
tected monopoly. The price of such
special protection is supposed to be
special accountability. Now that
AT&T has the goods, it sees no reason
to continue paying the price. And if
the government finalizes last
month's settlement, no one will be
left to demand that it do so.
The giant will be loose indeed,
leaving us with nothing but the
feeble hope that he will be as sweet
and gentle as Gulliver with us.

for years and has at last broken free."
— chief analyst for a Wall Street bro
kerage
The stirring giant in this metaphor
is the American Telephone and Tele
graph Company, the largest corpo
ration in the world. Its assets are esti
mated at $137 billion, more than the
combined holdings of Exxon, Gener
al Motors, and U.S. Steel, and more
than the GNP of all but 20 countries
of the world.
The final "string" fell away last
month, when AT&T and the Justice
Department agreed to the settlement
of a seven-year-old anti-trust suit.
One provision gives AT&T what it has
been craving for years: free entry
into software and processing in
dustries that could supply the
awesomely complete hardware sys
tems that AT&T has developed as a
government-protected monopoly.
The exact terms of the agreement,
which isstill tentative, are socomplex
that most public officials and private
lobbyists are devoting a few weeks to
studying what it says before com
menting on what it means.
If the professionals are scratching
their heads over the consequences of
this new marriage, it's natural that
most of us are totally in the dark. But I
think we have to struggle to move
closer to the light, because AT&T has
relied on a certain amount of public
confusion to get to where it is today.
Partly because its domain is tech
nology, partly because its monopoly
status is so peculiar, partly because
news coverage over the years has
omitted crucial information, most
people uneasy about AT&T's growth
have despaired of clearly under
standing the issues. We have come to
accept the company's constant ex
pansion, like smog, as a fact of life.
This resigned stoicism has seeped
into government policy; a spokes
man for Justice's anti-trust division
said last year that AT&T is "just too

big to regulate."
How did it get that way? By moving
faster and pressing harder than any
one else when America reached the
electronicage. AT&T wasthe Hudson
Bay Company of tele
communications. It was the only
game in town when it became clear
that free-market competition would
not best serve the business of wiring
the nation, which called for up
recedented capital outlays and a uni
formity of standards and materials.
The government itself could have
taken on this colossal enterprise —
most governments do — but that was
not the way we were carving out. This
job called for a new economic
hybrid: a company privately owned
but publicly supported, whose single
customer — America — was eager,
generous, and constant.
Because AT&T was so industrious
and productive, the public subsidy it
enjoyed never had the look of chari
ty. The demand for its product was so
fierce that it needed no Chrysler
style handout. What it did need was a
steady public boost to lay the in
frastructure for successive new tech
nologies. So it was that a century ago,
AT&T tied its own wire to a hundred
thousand telegraph poles that were
set in place by army details or railroad
crews, through endlessly long rights
of-way secured and sometimes
pacified by the federal government.
And so it was that in 1962, AT&T
could launch Telstar, our first com
munications satellite. The company
paid for every last rivet in the final
vessel, but the billions of research
and development dollars that pre
ceded lift-off came from your pa
rents and mine, via the IRS and
NASA. And it was U.S. foreign aid
that largely financed the down-link
receivers around the world that
created Telstar's market. We have
been good to our telephone and tel
egraph — and satellite — company.
The media has been another chan
nel of AT&T's public subsidy. The
company had a foot in the door when
radio broke onto the scene, building
New York's WEAF, the first com
mercial radio station, in 1922. A few
broadcast pioneers began to wonder

out loud about the power available
to any company that controls both
the lines and content of communica
tion. So, in 1926, the company sold
WEAF to RCA for $1, million and,
more to the point, exclusive rights to
provide line transmission between
network stations.
That same right, enforced more by
the company's monopoly status than
by formal contracts, helped AT&T
complete its web of transmission
lines as television developed. The
company's $2 million charge to run
lines from the 1964 Democratic Con
vention in Atlantic City to CBS head
quarters in New York was typical.
Those dollars came from everyone
who bought products advertised dur
ing CBS's convention telecast. The
convention is ancient history, but the
Atlantic City/NYC link is still making
money for AT&T.
This tangible and lasting character
of AT&T's assets add to its unique
strength. The power of other corpo
rate interests might ebb and flow
over time as the nation's tastes and
needs change, but AT&T only moves
forward. Every advance is cast in cop
per and hard plastic. Whether or not
it yields a quick profit, every new link
adds to the structural strength of the
whole and enhances our depen
dence on the AT&T system.
And as our dependence increased,
so did AT&T's confidence that,
sooner or later, it would always get
what it wanted. In the 1950'5, govern
ment regulators wanted AT&T to give
up Western Electric, the company's
manufacturing arm; you'll find its
label stamped on the back of almost
any telephone. The struggle ended in
a 1956 consent decree that allowed
the company to keep everything it
owned in return for a promise not to
enter the new field opened by the
birth of computer technology.
Many thought that AT&T's promise
was worth considerably less than the
profits of Western Electric. There
were grumblings that AT&T's satellite
entry violated the 1956 agreement,
but our rush to challenge the Soviets
in space precluded government ac
tion.
AT&T waited patiently, steadily less

concerned with hiding its views on
the 1956 promise. The company's
1980 stockholder's report was clear
on the subject:
"No longer do we perceive that
our business will be limited to tele
phony, or, for that matter, tele
communications. Ours is the busi
ness of information handling, the
knowledge business, and the market
we seek is global."
Last year the waiting ended. An ad
ministration took office pledging to
get government off the backs of "the
people." Last month's settlement was
another lesson in what that means.
The price that AT&T paid in 1956 to
keep its empire intact, its solemn
promise, was refunded in full. The
company will bring its full resources,
amassed over a century of monopoly
privilege, to what could be the big
gest game of all: the assembly, proc
essing, and transmission of informa
tion.
Unlike the 1956 decree, the settle
ment actually cost AT&T something.
It has agreed to sell its interest in 22
local telephone companies, includ
ing Pacific Telephone. AT&T has
moaned and sighed about the loss,
pointing out that local companies
comprise most of their total assets.
The noise is for show. AT&T's
stockholder's will receive shares in
the local companies that at least

equal the value of the stock they are
losing. And the localsare far less prof
itable than the pieces that AT&T re
tains. Left untouched are Western
Electric; Bell Telephone Labs, the
world's largest industrial research
center; and the long-distance facil
ities, which make so much money
that they subsidize local service. It is
the loss of that subsidy, in fact, and
the enormous jump in local phone
rates that is expected to result, that
has mobilized most of the political
opposition to the settlement; con
gressmen are anxious to go on record
as opposing a two- or three-fold rate
increase for the folks back home.
And even as AT&T's right hand is
waving good-bye to the locals, its left
is trying to grab off everything that
isn't nailed down. It wants ownership
of the Yellow Pages and the actual
telephone that you and I lease, the
two financial plums of local service.
"AT&T is about to run off with the
cookie jar," Rep. Ronald Mottl (D-
Ohio) said last month, "and leave the
crumbs behind to the local operating
companies."
Some believe that a leaner AT&T,
divested of local problems, will be
much better suited to dive into new
enterprises. In any case, as the
monopoly supplier of certain ser
vices to local companies that are
obliged to compete with one anoth

er, it can hardly lose. Everyone ex
cept AT&T publicists see the com
pany as the big winner in last month's
deal; one Connecticut consulting
firm estimates that AT&T will double
its annual revenues ($52 billion in
1980) within eight years.
I would have a problem with any
company making that much money,
even if it did so without special fa
vors, but that's just me. The real out
rage is that AT&T has been twice
paid. It grew money-rich at the same
time that it was allowed to amass the
hardware that connects virtually ev
ery home, office, shop, factory and
broadcast station in the country and
throughout much of the world.
This system could have been built
only through the graces of a pro
tected monopoly. The price of such
special protection is supposed to be
special accountability. Now that
AT&T has the goods, it sees no reason
to continue paying the price. And if
the government finalizes last
month's settlement, no one will be
left to demand that it do so.
The giant will be loose indeed,
leaving us with nothing but the
feeble hope that he will be as sweet
and gentle as Gulliver with us.

"It's Gulliver's travels retold for the
79805. The Lilliputians, like the gov
ernment, controlled a big giant. But
one at a time, the strings began to fall

al Motors, and U.S. Steel, and more
than the GNP of all but 20 countries
of the world.
The final "string" fell away last
month, when AT&T and the Justice
Department agreed to the settlement
of a seven-year-old anti-trust suit.
One provision gives AT&T what it has
been craving for years: free entry
into software and processing in
dustries that could supply the
awesomely complete hardware sys
tems that AT&T has developed as a
government-protected monopoly.
The exact terms of the agreement,
which isstill tentative, are socomplex
that most public officials and private
lobbyists are devoting a few weeks to
studying what it says before com
menting on what it means.
If the professionals are scratching
their heads over the consequences of
this new marriage, it's natural that
most of us are totally in the dark. But I
think we have to struggle to move
closer to the light, because AT&T has
relied on a certain amount of public
confusion to get to where it is today.
Partly because its domain is tech
nology, partly because its monopoly
status is so peculiar, partly because
news coverage over the years has
omitted crucial information, most
people uneasy about AT&T's growth
have despaired of clearly under
standing the issues. We have come to
accept the company's constant ex
pansion, like smog, as a fact of life.
This resigned stoicism has seeped
into government policy; a spokes
man for Justice's anti-trust division
said last year that AT&T is "just too

big to regulate."
How did it get that way? By moving
faster and pressing harder than any
one else when America reached the
electronicage. AT&T wasthe Hudson
Bay Company of tele
communications. It was the only
game in town when it became clear
that free-market competition would
not best serve the business of wiring
the nation, which called for up
recedented capital outlays and a uni
formity of standards and materials.
The government itself could have
taken on this colossal enterprise —
most governments do — but that was
not the way we were carving out. This
job called for a new economic
hybrid: a company privately owned
but publicly supported, whose single
customer — America — was eager,
generous, and constant.
Because AT&T was so industrious
and productive, the public subsidy it
enjoyed never had the look of chari
ty. The demand for its product was so
fierce that it needed no Chrysler
style handout. What it did need was a
steady public boost to lay the in
frastructure for successive new tech
nologies. So it was that a century ago,
AT&T tied its own wire to a hundred
thousand telegraph poles that were
set in place by army details or railroad
crews, through endlessly long rights
of-way secured and sometimes
pacified by the federal government.
And so it was that in 1962, AT&T
could launch Telstar, our first com
munications satellite. The company
paid for every last rivet in the final
vessel, but the billions of research
and development dollars that pre
ceded lift-off came from your pa
rents and mine, via the IRS and
NASA. And it was U.S. foreign aid
that largely financed the down-link
receivers around the world that
created Telstar's market. We have
been good to our telephone and tel
egraph — and satellite — company.
The media has been another chan
nel of AT&T's public subsidy. The
company had a foot in the door when
radio broke onto the scene, building
New York's WEAF, the first com
mercial radio station, in 1922. A few
broadcast pioneers began to wonder

out loud about the power available
to any company that controls both
the lines and content of communica
tion. So, in 1926, the company sold
WEAF to RCA for $1, million and,
more to the point, exclusive rights to
provide line transmission between
network stations.
That same right, enforced more by
the company's monopoly status than
by formal contracts, helped AT&T
complete its web of transmission
lines as television developed. The
company's $2 million charge to run
lines from the 1964 Democratic Con
vention in Atlantic City to CBS head
quarters in New York was typical.
Those dollars came from everyone
who bought products advertised dur
ing CBS's convention telecast. The
convention is ancient history, but the
Atlantic City/NYC link is still making
money for AT&T.
This tangible and lasting character
of AT&T's assets add to its unique
strength. The power of other corpo
rate interests might ebb and flow
over time as the nation's tastes and
needs change, but AT&T only moves
forward. Every advance is cast in cop
per and hard plastic. Whether or not
it yields a quick profit, every new link
adds to the structural strength of the
whole and enhances our depen
dence on the AT&T system.
And as our dependence increased,
so did AT&T's confidence that,
sooner or later, it would always get
what it wanted. In the 1950'5, govern
ment regulators wanted AT&T to give
up Western Electric, the company's
manufacturing arm; you'll find its
label stamped on the back of almost
any telephone. The struggle ended in
a 1956 consent decree that allowed
the company to keep everything it
owned in return for a promise not to
enter the new field opened by the
birth of computer technology.
Many thought that AT&T's promise
was worth considerably less than the
profits of Western Electric. There
were grumblings that AT&T's satellite
entry violated the 1956 agreement,
but our rush to challenge the Soviets
in space precluded government ac
tion.
AT&T waited patiently, steadily less

concerned with hiding its views on
the 1956 promise. The company's
1980 stockholder's report was clear
on the subject:
"No longer do we perceive that
our business will be limited to tele
phony, or, for that matter, tele
communications. Ours is the busi
ness of information handling, the
knowledge business, and the market
we seek is global."
Last year the waiting ended. An ad
ministration took office pledging to
get government off the backs of "the
people." Last month's settlement was
another lesson in what that means.
The price that AT&T paid in 1956 to
keep its empire intact, its solemn
promise, was refunded in full. The
company will bring its full resources,
amassed over a century of monopoly
privilege, to what could be the big
gest game of all: the assembly, proc
essing, and transmission of informa
tion.
Unlike the 1956 decree, the settle
ment actually cost AT&T something.
It has agreed to sell its interest in 22
local telephone companies, includ
ing Pacific Telephone. AT&T has
moaned and sighed about the loss,
pointing out that local companies
comprise most of their total assets.
The noise is for show. AT&T's
stockholder's will receive shares in
the local companies that at least

equal the value of the stock they are
losing. And the localsare far less prof
itable than the pieces that AT&T re
tains. Left untouched are Western
Electric; Bell Telephone Labs, the
world's largest industrial research
center; and the long-distance facil
ities, which make so much money
that they subsidize local service. It is
the loss of that subsidy, in fact, and
the enormous jump in local phone
rates that is expected to result, that
has mobilized most of the political
opposition to the settlement; con
gressmen are anxious to go on record
as opposing a two- or three-fold rate
increase for the folks back home.
And even as AT&T's right hand is
waving good-bye to the locals, its left
is trying to grab off everything that
isn't nailed down. It wants ownership
of the Yellow Pages and the actual
telephone that you and I lease, the
two financial plums of local service.
"AT&T is about to run off with the
cookie jar," Rep. Ronald Mottl (D-
Ohio) said last month, "and leave the
crumbs behind to the local operating
companies."
Some believe that a leaner AT&T,
divested of local problems, will be
much better suited to dive into new
enterprises. In any case, as the
monopoly supplier of certain ser
vices to local companies that are
obliged to compete with one anoth

er, it can hardly lose. Everyone ex
cept AT&T publicists see the com
pany as the big winner in last month's
deal; one Connecticut consulting
firm estimates that AT&T will double
its annual revenues ($52 billion in
1980) within eight years.
I would have a problem with any
company making that much money,
even if it did so without special fa
vors, but that's just me. The real out
rage is that AT&T has been twice
paid. It grew money-rich at the same
time that it was allowed to amass the
hardware that connects virtually ev
ery home, office, shop, factory and
broadcast station in the country and
throughout much of the world.
This system could have been built
only through the graces of a pro
tected monopoly. The price of such
special protection is supposed to be
special accountability. Now that
AT&T has the goods, it sees no reason
to continue paying the price. And if
the government finalizes last
month's settlement, no one will be
left to demand that it do so.
The giant will be loose indeed,
leaving us with nothing but the
feeble hope that he will be as sweet
and gentle as Gulliver with us.

"It's Gulliver's travels retold for the

one at a time, the strings began to fall

company with tremendous strength
and resources that has been dormant
for years and has at last broken free."

is the American Telephone and Tele
