## Schweiker's contraception proposal alienates teenagers 
### 
Washington — Richard Schweiker doesn't deserve a
single Valentine this year. Judging from his remarks at a
House subcommittee hearing last week, the secretary of
Health and Human Services is bound to widen the gap
between young people and their parents.
Almost two months ago, Schweiker proposed that fed
erally-funded family planning clinics notify the parents
of clients under 18 who'd requested prescriptions for
contraceptives. Later this month, Schweiker is expected
to issue the rules in their final form.
It's not as if the implications of Schweiker's plan are
lost on those Americans who'll be most affected.
"What's the point of going in for help if they're just going
to rat on us?" one young high school student from Loui
siana asked us recently. Added the editors of the (Uni
versity of) Minnesota Daily: "If this proposal is im
plemented, many of those parents whom the adminis
tration seeks to notify about their children's sexual activi
ty will not learn about it until their daughters come home
pregnant."
But Schweiker, a former running mate of President
Ronald Reagan's, isn't budging from his original posi

tion. He told the House subcommittee on Health and the
Environment last Tuesday that the government's policy
of secretly providing birth control prescriptions is more
dangerous to families than his proposed regulation re
quiring parental notification. "We've built a Berlin Wall
between the kid and the parent. We think that's wrong."
Ever since Congress agreed last August to "en
courage" parental involvement in teenage contracep
tive counseling, right-to-life groups such as the Ameri
can Life Lobby have been pressuring Schweiker to in
terpret Congress' language as a mandate for parental
notification. And they seem to have gotten their way.
Unfortunately, word of Schweiker's proposed regu
lations has perhaps already steered thousands of teens
away from prescription contraceptives to less reliable
methods such as foams, condoms and Mr. Withdrawal.
The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which is affiliated with
the Planned Parenthood Foundation of America and
widely regarded as the nation's leading authority on
teenage fertility, estimates that 25 percent of the nearly
one million teenagers who rely on federally-funded

clinics wouldn't patronize such places under the new
rule. Only two percent of this group, the institute con
tends, would sacrifice sexual activity for the sake of Mom
and Dad. The result would surely mean a higher teenage
pregnancy rate (already one in 10 young women today
becomes pregnant before reaching 18).
As a father of five, Schweiker ought to know that most
teenagers today can't talk about their own sex lives in the
company of parents and expect a mature response. In
stead, he places often traumatic matters of sexuality in
the same league with questions of report cards and
school attendance. "Parents must give written per
mission before a child can go on a school trip and must
explain when a child is absent from class for even one
day,"he said. "It's paradoxical..."
Does Schweiker really believe parents will dispatch
with a teenager's birth control needs just as blithely as
they do with permission slips and gym class excuses?
Doesn't he realize that Uncle Sam invites excess
estrangement when Dad learns of Amy's new
diaphragm? (Since all prescription contraceptives are for

women, the proposed regulation would spare young
men from such embarassing scenes with parents.)
Of course, parents should know as much as possible
about a child s personal life. It's a natural responsibility.
But its improper and ill-founded for a government to do
the background briefing. Parents must inform them
selves and develop strong communication with their
children long before birth control becomes an issue.
If the administration is willing to risk additional alien
ation between generations, Schweiker and the New
Right are only undermining theirown goal of bringing
families "together." Indeed, this blind response to the
teenage pregnancy problem may indicate the adminis
tration s actual objective: it wants out of the contracep
tion business in the hope of bringing the moral stature of
this country in line with its ideals.
Young people, who already have a difficult time grow
ing up, are left in the lurch of such self-delusion.
