## Mandantory fee assessments mean 'pork barrel polities' 
### 
Judging from articles appearing
this week in the Daily concerning the
fee assessment system, it appears the
ASSU is hell-bent on proving that
elected representatives seldom work
to uphold the interests of the public
at large. Instead, they chose to aid the
pressure groups. How else can one
explain that when at least 45 percent
of the student body saw fit to claim at
least one fee assessment refund, the
solution that occured to many sena
tors was to ensure that these people
could never get their money back
again? The present system has
worked exactly as its designers in
tended: dissatisfied people had their
money refunded. But, since the stu
dents are finally exercising their
rights, it has become necessary to
take them away.
There are several proposals for
change being bandied about, and
the crucial element in many of them
is: charge some sort of mandatory
student body fee. In my opinion, the
refundability of fees is the one ele
ment of the current system that
should be preserved at all costs. Yes, I
realize most other universities have
mandatory fees. I attended one of
them as an undergraduate. Every se
mester the local equivalent of the
ASSU had approximately $100,000 to
spread out among various pet
projects and organizations. The
words "pork barrel" provide an apt
description of the process. So we
should have mandatory fees at Stan
ford because they have them at East

Podunk Community College? Does
the fact that "everyone's doing it" re
ally make it all right? Or should we
not thank our lucky stars that the au
thors of the present ASSU constitu
tion saw fit to deny the student gov
ernment the right to take money
from any student without his or her
consent?
We are being told by our repre
sentatives that since the students
were not generous enough to give
their money away freely, it has be
come necessary to extort it from
them. I ask you, has anyone bothered
to think about why so many more
people took their money back this
quarter than usual and how they can
be persuaded not to do so in the
future, or is it too easy and too tempt
ing simply to go out and steal the
money?

A reader might well have come
away from your Feb. 3 article on the
ASSU debate over Professor
Catharine MacKinnon's guest lec
tureship with the belief that she was
at best a marginally competent law
teacher. In fact, MacKinnon is among
the few teachers and scholars doing
truly innovative work in feminist le
gal theory. In her seminar presenta

tions to the law faculty, she has been
exceptionally challenging. It is simply
impossible to infer from negative
course evaluations that MacKinnon
is in any way inept. We are sure that
many law students who enrolled for
her course found her approach unin
teresting to them or too far removed
from their career concerns, and that
other students were, as a close look at
the ratings reveals, quite en
thusiastic. Her previous course at
Harvard Law School was far more
uniformly well-received.
We are certain that students who
attend her ASSU-sponsored course
will have a unique opportunity to
work at the frontier of feminist
thought.

Caution can't wait
I am relieved to know that there is
such a simple solution to the rape
problem (Marty Beene's letter to the
Daily, Feb. 9). All I have to do to avoid
rape is to avoid being alone in lonely
places. In fact, with this revelation, I
now know how to avoid car theft
(don't own one), robbery (don't own
anything), muggings (don't leave
your residence) and even violent
death (don't live). What a clever
method for fighting crimel
Beene's simplistic solution leaves

out the fact that I must function in so
ciety. He hasn't told me how I can
avoid being alone when I have tocol
lect a data point in my lab at 2 a.m., or
how I can avoid biking alone after a
late departmental colloquium. In
fact, how can I function in a reason
ably effective manner if I must forev
er find someone to accompany me to
place which is'lonely?'
Let s be serious! When we suggest
a solution toa problem, weshouldat
tack the cause, not the symptoms.
Why do we persist in blaming the vic
tim instead of the rapist for the
crime?

From bad to worse
In a recent letter to the Daily (Feb.
9), Marty Beene stated, "I would
think most women would rather
have their independence inhibited
somewhat than to be raped or as
saulted. Ido not consider a choice
between the bad and the horrible a
real choice. Beene also calls women
who walk alone "naive" and says that
the avoidance of rape is "incredibly
simple ... don't go alone." The
naivete comes in thinking that the re
striction of human freedom is "in
credibly simple."

is: charge some sort of mandatory
student body fee. In my opinion, the
refundability of fees is the one ele
ment of the current system that
should be preserved at all costs. Yes, I
realize most other universities have
mandatory fees. I attended one of
them as an undergraduate. Every se
mester the local equivalent of the
ASSU had approximately $100,000 to
spread out among various pet
projects and organizations. The
words "pork barrel" provide an apt
description of the process. So we
should have mandatory fees at Stan
ford because they have them at East

Podunk Community College? Does
the fact that "everyone's doing it" re
ally make it all right? Or should we
not thank our lucky stars that the au
thors of the present ASSU constitu
tion saw fit to deny the student gov
ernment the right to take money
from any student without his or her
consent?
We are being told by our repre
sentatives that since the students
were not generous enough to give
their money away freely, it has be
come necessary to extort it from
them. I ask you, has anyone bothered
to think about why so many more
people took their money back this
quarter than usual and how they can
be persuaded not to do so in the
future, or is it too easy and too tempt
ing simply to go out and steal the
money?

A reader might well have come
away from your Feb. 3 article on the
ASSU debate over Professor
Catharine MacKinnon's guest lec
tureship with the belief that she was
at best a marginally competent law
teacher. In fact, MacKinnon is among
the few teachers and scholars doing
truly innovative work in feminist le
gal theory. In her seminar presenta

tions to the law faculty, she has been
exceptionally challenging. It is simply
impossible to infer from negative
course evaluations that MacKinnon
is in any way inept. We are sure that
many law students who enrolled for
her course found her approach unin
teresting to them or too far removed
from their career concerns, and that
other students were, as a close look at
the ratings reveals, quite en
thusiastic. Her previous course at
Harvard Law School was far more
uniformly well-received.
We are certain that students who
attend her ASSU-sponsored course
will have a unique opportunity to
work at the frontier of feminist
thought.

Caution can't wait
I am relieved to know that there is
such a simple solution to the rape
problem (Marty Beene's letter to the
Daily, Feb. 9). All I have to do to avoid
rape is to avoid being alone in lonely
places. In fact, with this revelation, I
now know how to avoid car theft
(don't own one), robbery (don't own
anything), muggings (don't leave
your residence) and even violent
death (don't live). What a clever
method for fighting crimel
Beene's simplistic solution leaves

out the fact that I must function in so
ciety. He hasn't told me how I can
avoid being alone when I have tocol
lect a data point in my lab at 2 a.m., or
how I can avoid biking alone after a
late departmental colloquium. In
fact, how can I function in a reason
ably effective manner if I must forev
er find someone to accompany me to
place which is'lonely?'
Let s be serious! When we suggest
a solution toa problem, weshouldat
tack the cause, not the symptoms.
Why do we persist in blaming the vic
tim instead of the rapist for the
crime?

From bad to worse
In a recent letter to the Daily (Feb.
9), Marty Beene stated, "I would
think most women would rather
have their independence inhibited
somewhat than to be raped or as
saulted. Ido not consider a choice
between the bad and the horrible a
real choice. Beene also calls women
who walk alone "naive" and says that
the avoidance of rape is "incredibly
simple ... don't go alone." The
naivete comes in thinking that the re
striction of human freedom is "in
credibly simple."

Judging from articles appearing
this week in the Daily concerning the
fee assessment system, it appears the
ASSU is hell-bent on proving that
elected representatives seldom work
to uphold the interests of the public
at large. Instead, they chose to aid the
pressure groups. How else can one
explain that when at least 45 percent
of the student body saw fit to claim at
least one fee assessment refund, the
solution that occured to many sena
tors was to ensure that these people
could never get their money back
again? The present system has
worked exactly as its designers in
tended: dissatisfied people had their
money refunded. But, since the stu
dents are finally exercising their
rights, it has become necessary to
take them away.
There are several proposals for
change being bandied about, and
the crucial element in many of them
is: charge some sort of mandatory
student body fee. In my opinion, the
refundability of fees is the one ele
