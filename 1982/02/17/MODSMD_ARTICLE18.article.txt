An estimated 200 Cal State L.A. students
may attempt to commit suicide during the
next academic year, based on figures
from a recent University of Massachusetts
study. Suicide is the third leading cause
of death among the 15 to 24-year-old age
group. The rate of suicide is 50 percent
higher on college campuses than the ov
erall average in the age groups. Suicidal
thoughts generally stem from deep
seated depression, reportedly the leading
psychiatric disorder on college campuses.
Irwin Lublin, CSLA professor of psy
chology, sees depression as a major prob
lem in the country and the world. The de
pressed student is often unaware of his
problem, he said. Mounting academic
pressures, the continual stress to perform
sometimes beyond capabilities and the
loss of a former support system can create
a low self-esteem. "Depression feeds
itself," Lublin said."The lowera student's
self-esteem is, the less capable he be
comes. Then the lower his performance
becomes, the lower his self-esteem sinks,
verifying his belief that he is truly
worthless."

College life may be full of anxiety, but
students in the midwest live in a less
stressful part of the country than their Ivy
league counterparts in the East, a study in
Psychology Today reported last week.
The Midwest states, including Kansas,
Missouri, Nebraska and lowa, rated
highest in general well-being, second

highest in satisfaction with home and
neighborhood and lowest in negative
feelings. The growing satisfaction with
midwestern living could be caused by the
slow-paced lifestyle, said Richard Snyder,
Kansas University professor of psy
chology.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylva
nia, states which the study dubbed the
"miserable Megalopolis," rated highest
for stress and lowest in satisfaction with
work or friends. Other areas scoring low
in happiness were the South and the
Great Lakes states — Michigan, Ohio, In
diana, Illinois and Wisconsin. The study
called them "The Great Lakes of Disap
pointment."

Duke University had had trouble per
suading the People's Republicof Chinato
let a Chinese student study at Duke's law
school, so administrators asked for a little
help from an old friend — former Presi
dent Richard Nixon. Law School Dean
Paul Carrington said the Chinese student
applied to Duke, was accepted, and also
was awarded the Richard M. Nixon Schol
arship, which carries a $3000 annual
stipend. The Chinese government would
not let the student leave the country, Car

rington said. "I invited Mr. Nixon to help,
and he did that by contacting friends of
his in the government then. It hasn't
worked yet, but it might work." Nixon's
office said it would not comment before
Nixon's chief of staff returns to the city.
Carrington said the Chinese government
refused to grant the student a visa to leave
China because the Reagan administration
had been considering selling advanced
aircraft to Taiwan, although it later mod
ified the plan.

After waiting several months for
Harvard to accept the gift, a philanthropic
organization last week withdrew its offer
of a sculpture on the theme "Gay Liber
ation" by nationally renowned artist
George Segal. A trustee of the fund and a
campus gay rights activist said they
thought the University may have decided
not to take the sculpture because it dealt
with homosexuality.
Peter Putnam, trustee in charge of the
fund, added "Of course, the nature of the
theme led to its rejection. I think they
might be worried about its effect on
alumni funding and other things." Put
nam refused to estimate the value of the
work, but said single Segal figures were

selling for more than $50,000. Segal's
works are included in the collections of
most major American museums, Carroll
Janis, owner of New York's Janis gallery
where Segal's work has been displayed
recently, said. "He's one of the major
American sculptors," Janis said. "There
are many museums trying to buy his work,
much less get it free."

The freshman class entering the Uni
versity of California schools each year is
less proficient in writing and
mathematical skills, and the decline in
preparation is having important effects
on entering students as well as on theUC
schools. A report on UC activities noted
that on the SAT exams, however, the
mean scores for UC freshmen have been
declining faster than the national means.
These declines have resulted in increas
ing enrollments in pre-university-level
writing courses and in pre-calculus math
courses at UC schools. Data show that
more than half of the entering freshmen
on each general campus in 1979 scored
below 550 on the verbal portion of the
SAT, and 41.9 percent scored below 550
on the math section of the exam.

Opting to continue teaching rather
than curl up with containers of pickles

the American Civilization Department at

doesn't have much of a maternity leave
policy, and I didn't want to burden my
colleagues with my work," Faust said.
Faust's decision to have a child while
maintaining a career highlights what she
discusses in portions of her taped lec

Feminism is the greatest internal ideol
ogical threat of our age, feels Michael
Levin, a conservative thinker from City
College of New York. "The feminist de
mand for equal pay for equal work is an
example of deprivation of liberty," he
said in a talk last week. Levin argued that
unequal pay for women in the job market
is the natural result of women not being
as "aggressive" as men. "Women in the
highest ranks of business hang back
before promotion. This is indicative of the
less aggressive nature of females, since
they are in a situation which is one of the
most conducive to aggression."
Women's studies, asserted Levin, are
"dopey." In his view, they are not a legit
imate academic pursuit not only because
"there has been not one great work pro
duced (of feminist literature)," but also
because women's studies courses attempt
to "indoctrinate" students.

pressures, the continual stress to perform
sometimes beyond capabilities and the
loss of a former support system can create
a low self-esteem. "Depression feeds

College life may be full of anxiety, but
students in the midwest live in a less
stressful part of the country than their Ivy
league counterparts in the East, a study in
Psychology Today reported last week.
The Midwest states, including Kansas,
Missouri, Nebraska and lowa, rated
highest in general well-being, second

highest in satisfaction with home and
neighborhood and lowest in negative
feelings. The growing satisfaction with
midwestern living could be caused by the
slow-paced lifestyle, said Richard Snyder,
Kansas University professor of psy
chology.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylva
nia, states which the study dubbed the
"miserable Megalopolis," rated highest
for stress and lowest in satisfaction with
work or friends. Other areas scoring low
in happiness were the South and the
Great Lakes states — Michigan, Ohio, In
diana, Illinois and Wisconsin. The study
called them "The Great Lakes of Disap
pointment."

Duke University had had trouble per
suading the People's Republicof Chinato
let a Chinese student study at Duke's law
school, so administrators asked for a little
help from an old friend — former Presi
dent Richard Nixon. Law School Dean
Paul Carrington said the Chinese student
applied to Duke, was accepted, and also
was awarded the Richard M. Nixon Schol
arship, which carries a $3000 annual
stipend. The Chinese government would
not let the student leave the country, Car

rington said. "I invited Mr. Nixon to help,
and he did that by contacting friends of
his in the government then. It hasn't
worked yet, but it might work." Nixon's
office said it would not comment before
Nixon's chief of staff returns to the city.
Carrington said the Chinese government
refused to grant the student a visa to leave
China because the Reagan administration
had been considering selling advanced
aircraft to Taiwan, although it later mod
ified the plan.

After waiting several months for
Harvard to accept the gift, a philanthropic
organization last week withdrew its offer
of a sculpture on the theme "Gay Liber
ation" by nationally renowned artist
George Segal. A trustee of the fund and a
campus gay rights activist said they
thought the University may have decided
not to take the sculpture because it dealt
with homosexuality.
Peter Putnam, trustee in charge of the
fund, added "Of course, the nature of the
theme led to its rejection. I think they
might be worried about its effect on
alumni funding and other things." Put
nam refused to estimate the value of the
work, but said single Segal figures were

selling for more than $50,000. Segal's
works are included in the collections of
most major American museums, Carroll
Janis, owner of New York's Janis gallery
where Segal's work has been displayed
recently, said. "He's one of the major
American sculptors," Janis said. "There
are many museums trying to buy his work,
much less get it free."

The freshman class entering the Uni
versity of California schools each year is
less proficient in writing and
mathematical skills, and the decline in
preparation is having important effects
on entering students as well as on theUC
schools. A report on UC activities noted
that on the SAT exams, however, the
mean scores for UC freshmen have been
declining faster than the national means.
These declines have resulted in increas
ing enrollments in pre-university-level
writing courses and in pre-calculus math
courses at UC schools. Data show that
more than half of the entering freshmen
on each general campus in 1979 scored
below 550 on the verbal portion of the
SAT, and 41.9 percent scored below 550
on the math section of the exam.

Feminism is the greatest internal ideol
ogical threat of our age, feels Michael
Levin, a conservative thinker from City
College of New York. "The feminist de
mand for equal pay for equal work is an
example of deprivation of liberty," he
said in a talk last week. Levin argued that
unequal pay for women in the job market
is the natural result of women not being
as "aggressive" as men. "Women in the
highest ranks of business hang back
before promotion. This is indicative of the
less aggressive nature of females, since
they are in a situation which is one of the
most conducive to aggression."
Women's studies, asserted Levin, are
"dopey." In his view, they are not a legit
imate academic pursuit not only because
"there has been not one great work pro
duced (of feminist literature)," but also
because women's studies courses attempt
to "indoctrinate" students.
An estimated 200 Cal State L.A. students
may attempt to commit suicide during the
next academic year, based on figures
from a recent University of Massachusetts
study. Suicide is the third leading cause
of death among the 15 to 24-year-old age
group. The rate of suicide is 50 percent
higher on college campuses than the ov
erall average in the age groups. Suicidal
thoughts generally stem from deep
seated depression, reportedly the leading
psychiatric disorder on college campuses.
Irwin Lublin, CSLA professor of psy
chology, sees depression as a major prob
lem in the country and the world. The de
