# Senate imposes restrictions limiting pub board autonomy
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Publications board by-law changes
which will permit the senate to expel
board members for "unethical busi
ness conduct" were approved last
night by the ASSU Senate.
Publications Board Chairman Jim
Gable charged that language in the
revised by-laws amounted to
"censorship" and a "police action."
Although the clause was amended to
include the word "business," Gable
still protested the senate's control
over the allocation of publications
board funds.
Under the new system, the senate
must approve most publications
board expenditures. If the senate
fails to take action on the funding re
quests, the allocations take effect au
tomatically.
Gable said that a senator charged
with approving publications board
allocations may let his personal opin
ions influence his vote. "It's going to
be his editorial opinion that he's
going to bring to bear on his de
cision," he said.
Charging that such allocation con
trols amounted to a "form of
censorship," Gable advocated alter
native by-laws changes formulated
by the publications board that he felt
allowed more autonomy for student
publications.
However, Rules Committee Chair
man jim McGrath insisted that the
fee assessment funds allocated to the
publications board must be held ac
countable to the senate. "As soon as
you have tax money used to support
the free press, you have to make
compromises, " he said. "We simply
can't give them (student publica
tions) carte blanche."
The Daily receives no money from
the publications board.
When some senators suggested
that a compromise more agreeable
to the pub board might be worked
out, McGrath protested that the
Rules Committee had already spent
three months working on the present
changes. "The Rules Committee is
convinced that this is a good bill, a

workable bill," he said. "We've done
our best for a long period of time."
The final approval of the by-law
changes actually occurred without a
full quorum. The long meeting suf
fered from a steadily dwindling
number of senators. The quorum was
lost when one of the senators was
kidnapped by friends for a birthday
celebration, but the meeting con
tinued since none of the senators of
ficially recognized the absence of a
quorum.
In other actions, the special legisla
tive committee on fee assesesment
reform submitted the preliminary
form of its assessment reform bill for
consideration by the Senate's stand
ing committees. The committee rec
ommended instituting a mandatory
check-off system in which students
set a non-refundable
assessment each spring.
Students would be permitted to al
locate $1 to $3 to the student or
ganizations of their choice up to the
total amount of the fee. All un

assigned money would be dis
tributed by the senate. The commit
tee also proposed instituting a $6
transition fee assessment for the next
two quarters until the new system is
activated.
The special order of the meeting
was the address to the senate by Ath
letics Director Andy Geiger. He dis
cussed senators' concerns on con
flicts between academic and athletic
standards, the ability of the Stanford
coaching staff, and problems of non
students using University athletic
equipment.
Geiger assured the senators that
the athletic department's policies
were "consistent with the educa
tional aims and goals of the Univer
sity." He defended merit-based ath
letic scholarships by saying that they
are necessary in order to keep Stan
ford in a competitive position.
"We either compete with athletic
scholarships or forget Pac 10 athlet
ics," he said.

locate $1 to $3 to the student or
ganizations of their choice up to the
total amount of the fee. All un

assigned money would be dis
tributed by the senate. The commit
tee also proposed instituting a $6
transition fee assessment for the next
two quarters until the new system is
activated.
The special order of the meeting
was the address to the senate by Ath
letics Director Andy Geiger. He dis
cussed senators' concerns on con
flicts between academic and athletic
standards, the ability of the Stanford
coaching staff, and problems of non
students using University athletic
equipment.
Geiger assured the senators that
the athletic department's policies
were "consistent with the educa
tional aims and goals of the Univer
sity." He defended merit-based ath
letic scholarships by saying that they
are necessary in order to keep Stan
ford in a competitive position.
"We either compete with athletic
scholarships or forget Pac 10 athlet
ics," he said.
