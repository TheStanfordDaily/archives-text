## Redwood City planners okay South Shores development 
### Juliet Johnson 
Controversial plans for the
residential and industrial de
velopment of former salt
ponds at South Shores in
Redwood City moved forward
last week — and the debate is
getting hotter.

4 lt might be
disastrous,
combined with the
effects of
decreasing tidal
flows and run-off in
the sloughs — these
things can't be
checked in the
short time it takes to
write an
environmental
impact report/
— Marc Michaels,
marine biologist

In spite of strong opposition
by conservationists, the
Redwood City planning com
mission recommended last
Tuesday by a six to one vote
that the city council permit the

development of the 1095-acre
area. This would be achieved
by a change in its present des
ignation as urban reserve.
Owned by Redwood Shores
Inc., a subsidiary of Mobil Oil,
the dried ponds are separated
by a slough from Bair Island,
which is inhabited by several
endangered species. The Cali
fornia clapper rail, California
least tern, and salt marsh har
vest mouse breed on the is
land, which is also frequented
by harbor seal, snowy egret,
and brown pelican.
Bair Island, part of which
forms the San Francisco Bay
National Wildlife Refuge, is de
scribed by the Save San Francis
co Bay Association as "the larg
est single nesting site for the
birds in the South Bay."
Although Bair Island itself is
excluded from plans for de
velopment as part of what Jack
White of the State Department
of Fish and Game described as
a "mitigation package," there
is fear that the concession will
not prevent the effective de
struction of Bair Island as a ref
uge for wildlife.
Some Redwood City resi
dents are also concerned that
the increase of traffic on and
around the Bayshore freeway
which would result from the
development has been gravely
underestimated.
Don Warren, president of
Redwood Shores Inc., said he

was aware that the issue was
sensitive, but that "the actual
form the mitigation will take to
satisfy everyone's concerns is a
matter of negotiation still."
An independent report pre
pared for Redwood Shores Inc.
proposed the erection of a bar
rier to protect the harbor seals
which frequent the island, but
advised that other species can
withstand the impact of nearby
development.

Marc Michaels, a marine
biologist and environmental
consultant, does not agree. "It
might be disastrous, combined
with the effects of decreasing
tidal flows and run-off in the
sloughs — these things can't be
checked in the short time it
takes to write an environmen
tal impact report," he warned.
"There's going to be a lot of
changes in what happens in the
dynamics of the city itself. I
don't think anybody's seriously
addressed that," Michaels said.
Malka Kopell, conservation
director at the Peninsula Con
servation Center, said she be
lieves that "the development
has two major impacts as far as
wildlife is concerned; first of
all, it will actually cause some
loss of habitat — they're going
to have to develop some of the
levies around the slough.
"But most important is that it
would introduce people —
they'd be bringing people right
up to the edge — children,
adults, their dogs and cats will
come right over and disturb
the nesting birds," Kopell said.

Tom Harvey, a biologist and
specialist on California clapper
rails, said he feels that the fate
of Bair Island will set a prece
dent.
"The most important issue,
that I feel is being glossed over,
is that if that area is developed
we are going to lose about 1000
acres of reclaimable salt
marshes. All they're mitigating
is the effects the development
will have on the fringe
marshlands of the area.
"If they can go in and de
velop this area, it will be hard to
stop them developing other
privately owned areas. That's
why it's important to put up a
big fight now," Harvey said.
Warren said the Redwood
City planning commissionm
felt that the plan for develop
ment had benefitted from the
intensity of public discussion
which had taken place.
"We are in a position of hav
ing to balance everyone's con
cern — and we are really con
trolled by public bodies," he
said. "We get as much abuse
from people who think we
might be going to set aside the
land for mitigation as we do
from environmental people."
A spokesman for Redwood
Shores Inc. said that Mobil Oil
had made a donation of 800
acres on Bair Island to assist in

the setting up of the Wildlife
Refuge there.
What are the prospects for
Bair Island and its surround
ings?
"We will now complete the
land use decision process in
Redwood City. Once that is
done we will begin the process
ing of regional, state and feder
al authorities," said Warren.

"We feel there has been identi
fication of any environmental
concerns of importance."
Harvey recognizes the dif
ficulty of enlisting public sup
port to oppose the planned de
velopment. "People look out
at the abandoned salt ponds,
and it looks like a moonscape,"
he said. "But this kind of salt
marsh habitat is being threat

ened in the Bay Area. To lose it
would be a great setback."
"I'd like to make a big case
and get it placed on the city
ballot. After that, we've got to
count on our existing bureau
cratic safeguards. But because
of the political atmosphere in
Washington, we are concerned
that they may be less able to
help," Harvey said.

"There's going to be a lot of
changes in what happens in the
dynamics of the city itself. I
don't think anybody's seriously
addressed that," Michaels said.
Malka Kopell, conservation
director at the Peninsula Con
servation Center, said she be
lieves that "the development
has two major impacts as far as
wildlife is concerned; first of
all, it will actually cause some
loss of habitat — they're going
to have to develop some of the
levies around the slough.
"But most important is that it
would introduce people —
they'd be bringing people right
up to the edge — children,
adults, their dogs and cats will
come right over and disturb
the nesting birds," Kopell said.

Tom Harvey, a biologist and
specialist on California clapper
rails, said he feels that the fate
of Bair Island will set a prece
dent.
"The most important issue,
that I feel is being glossed over,
is that if that area is developed
we are going to lose about 1000
acres of reclaimable salt
marshes. All they're mitigating
is the effects the development
will have on the fringe
marshlands of the area.
"If they can go in and de
velop this area, it will be hard to
stop them developing other
privately owned areas. That's
why it's important to put up a
big fight now," Harvey said.
Warren said the Redwood
City planning commissionm
felt that the plan for develop
ment had benefitted from the
intensity of public discussion
which had taken place.
"We are in a position of hav
ing to balance everyone's con
cern — and we are really con
trolled by public bodies," he
said. "We get as much abuse
from people who think we
might be going to set aside the
land for mitigation as we do
from environmental people."
A spokesman for Redwood
Shores Inc. said that Mobil Oil
had made a donation of 800
acres on Bair Island to assist in

the setting up of the Wildlife
Refuge there.
What are the prospects for
Bair Island and its surround
ings?
"We will now complete the
land use decision process in
Redwood City. Once that is
done we will begin the process
ing of regional, state and feder
al authorities," said Warren.

"We feel there has been identi
fication of any environmental
concerns of importance."
Harvey recognizes the dif
ficulty of enlisting public sup
port to oppose the planned de
velopment. "People look out
at the abandoned salt ponds,
and it looks like a moonscape,"
he said. "But this kind of salt
marsh habitat is being threat

ened in the Bay Area. To lose it
would be a great setback."
"I'd like to make a big case
and get it placed on the city
ballot. After that, we've got to
count on our existing bureau
cratic safeguards. But because
of the political atmosphere in
Washington, we are concerned
that they may be less able to
help," Harvey said.

Controversial plans for the
residential and industrial de
velopment of former salt
ponds at South Shores in
Redwood City moved forward
last week — and the debate is
getting hotter.

4 lt might be
disastrous,
combined with the
effects of
decreasing tidal
flows and run-off in
the sloughs — these
things can't be
checked in the
short time it takes to
write an
environmental
impact report/
— Marc Michaels,
marine biologist

In spite of strong opposition
by conservationists, the
Redwood City planning com
mission recommended last
Tuesday by a six to one vote
that the city council permit the

development of the 1095-acre
area. This would be achieved
by a change in its present des
ignation as urban reserve.
Owned by Redwood Shores
Inc., a subsidiary of Mobil Oil,
the dried ponds are separated
by a slough from Bair Island,
which is inhabited by several
endangered species. The Cali
fornia clapper rail, California
least tern, and salt marsh har
vest mouse breed on the is
land, which is also frequented
by harbor seal, snowy egret,
and brown pelican.
Bair Island, part of which
forms the San Francisco Bay
National Wildlife Refuge, is de
scribed by the Save San Francis
co Bay Association as "the larg
est single nesting site for the
birds in the South Bay."
Although Bair Island itself is
excluded from plans for de
velopment as part of what Jack
White of the State Department
of Fish and Game described as
a "mitigation package," there
is fear that the concession will
not prevent the effective de
struction of Bair Island as a ref
uge for wildlife.
Some Redwood City resi
dents are also concerned that
the increase of traffic on and
around the Bayshore freeway
which would result from the
development has been gravely
underestimated.
Don Warren, president of
Redwood Shores Inc., said he

was aware that the issue was
sensitive, but that "the actual
form the mitigation will take to
satisfy everyone's concerns is a
matter of negotiation still."
An independent report pre
pared for Redwood Shores Inc.
proposed the erection of a bar
rier to protect the harbor seals
which frequent the island, but
advised that other species can
withstand the impact of nearby
development.

Marc Michaels, a marine
biologist and environmental
consultant, does not agree. "It
might be disastrous, combined

tidal flows and run-off in the
sloughs — these things can't be
