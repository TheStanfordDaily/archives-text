# SLAC hosts meeting

The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) will host an interna
tional conference on colliding beam
physics today through next Tuesday.
Prof. Gary Feldman of SLAC, con
ference chairman, said the purpose
of the conference "is to discuss new
technologies for the detection of
particles produced by colliding
beams."
Approximately 150 participants are
expected to attend, about half of
them are from foreign countries. Ac
cording to Feldman, 11 participants
are from the Soviet Union, but he
said, "We do not have any indication
that there will be problems — all the
work we do here is unclassified."
"What's not normally recognized
is that technology transfer is a two
way street." Feldman said that three
or four talks will be given by Russians
on findings that have not previously
been publicized in the West.
SLAC is involved with the study of
the basic properties and interactions
of elementary particles, and, accord
ing to Feldman, colliding beam phys
ics has emerged as today's most effi
cient research field.

The traditional method of conduc
ting such research has been accelera
tion of a beam of particles and col
lision with a stationary target. How
ever, that may change because, as
Feldman said, "You can get to higher
energies if you hit two beams of par
ticles together."
Another advantage of colliding
beams, according to Feldman, is that
energy is not expended in this in
teraction, as it is in the interaction be
tween one beam and a stationary ob
ject.
SLAC is now operating two elec
tron-positron storage rings for col lid
ing beam experiments. "The SPEAR
storage ring was built 10 years ago,"
Feldman said, "and since then the
technology has really caught on."
One difficulty with colliding beam
accelerators, however, is that it is
hard to detect the particles which are
produced when the beams collide.
Five different topics relevant to this
problem will be discussed at the con
ference.
The conference is sponsored by
both SLAC and the United States De
partment of Energy and is the second
in a series. The previous meeting was
held at Novosibirsk in Siberia in 1977.
