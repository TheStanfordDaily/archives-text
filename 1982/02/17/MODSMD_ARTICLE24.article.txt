Staff lunch
Today's noon staff lunch will offer
Daily staffers a chance to grill the
COP. No, it's not another story about
the Stanford police. Council of Presi
dents members Fred Buhl, Mariann
Byerwalter, Chris Greene and
Dragan Popov — as well as their ad
ministrative assistants — will be on
hand to answer questions about their
roles in the ASSU and to explain why
Stanford students need to have have
four presidents. Sandwiches from the
Coffee House will be served.
Story assignments
No more excuses. Mid-terms are
over, your cold has gotten better and
it's too rainy to sit in the sun. It's time
drop by the news office and peruse
the plethora of fascinating stories just
waiting to be covered. Stop in during

the staff lunch or in the day or
you might just start getting midnight
phone calls from editors needing re
porters.
Seriously, there are a few stories
that really need to be written in the
next few days and the senior staff
writers are overworked as it is. We'd
appreciate the help.
Happy hour
And now, for what you were all
waiting for:
Friday afternoon is a time to relax.
For many staffers it's a day to stay
away from the Daily. No more. Join
the poor diehards who even come in
on their days off for the first happy
hour of the new volume Friday at
4:30. Come for some great company
and good food; and have a drink with
us. Have another. And another...
How about a story assignment?
