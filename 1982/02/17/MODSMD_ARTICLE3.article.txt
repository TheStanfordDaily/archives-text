Harrison sentenced in Abscam
Washington — In the last legal action before he faces a Senate ex
pulsion vote next week, Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) was sentenced
yesterday to three years in prison and fined $50,000 for his bribery-con
spiracy conviction in the FBl's Abscam undercover investigation.
U.S. District Court Judge George Pratt delayed the sentence until Wil
liams' appeals are completed. He is the first incumbent senator since
1905 to be convicted on a criminal charge.
A Senate Ethics Committee aide said yesterday that Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) hadn't set the ground rules for the expulsion
debate except to decide that no committee business would be sched
uled. The last senator to be expelled was ousted for treason during the
Civil War.
Six House members also were convicted in the Abscam cases. Pratt
sentenced three who were tried in his court last August to three-year
prison terms and $20,000 fines. One, Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.)
was expelled from the House. None is yet in prison and none is ex
pected to serve more than 20 months.
Williams' $50,000 fine was the largest meted out to any of the Con
gressmen convicted in the Abscam cases.
Williams was convicted last May 1 of agreeing to trade his influence in
Congress for a hidden share of a $100 million loan from an undercover
FBI agent posing as the representative of a fictitious Arab sheik. He at
tended seven meetings over a period of months with the undercover
agents.
His encounters with the agents were recorded on videotape, as were
those of the House members caught in the sweeping congressional cor
ruption scandal. All the House members except Myers were defeated or
resigned from office. Only Williams, 62, has continued to fight the
judgment of his peers.
Williams repeated his claims of innocence again yesterday before the
sentencing in the federal courthouse in Uniondale, N.Y. "I leave this
court knowing, feeling and knowing, that I'm innocent of the crimes

charged," he said.
Government attorneys had considered the
Williams case the weakest of the Abscam group
because, unlike the House members, he turned
down a cash bribe offer and was prepped on
what to say before a key meeting by undercover
informer Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con
man.
But the jury in the trial clearly didn't find Wil
liams' testimony credible. Puccio charged yes
terday that Williams "put his office up for sale"
and then took the witness stand "to boldly lie,"
but "failed miserably."
Guatemala massacre: 43 dead
Guatemala City — Men in olive-green mili
tary garb invaded the northwestern
Guatemalan village of Calante and massacred
43 people, including six children, authorities
said yesterday.
Guatemalan television reported the victims'
throats had been cut, either with machetes or
bayonets, in theattack Monday night. Although
the killers had guns, none of the victims ap
peared to have been shot, the report said.
Police and military spokesmen said the
massacre occurred in the province of El Quiche,
about 160 miles northwest of here.
All the victims appeared to be peasants, resi
dents of Calante or other nearby villages,
Guatemalan authorities said.
A military spokesmen in Santa Cruz del
Quiche, the provincial capital, said military pa
trols were searching the area around Calante to
find the gunmen responsible for the mass
slaying.
The description of the assassins apparently
came from a 22-year-old woman who was
wounded in the attack and died while receiving
medical attention.
No group claimed responsibility for the
slayings and authorities refused to comment on
possible motives.
Church and human rights groups estimate
300 people are killed each month in
Guatemala's political violence. The death toll
appears to be rising as next month's general
elections draw near.
Bush rips AFL-CIO
Bai Harbour, Fla. — A combative Vice Presi
dent George Bush yesterdayaccused AFL-CIO
leaders of being politically biased in their op
position to President Ronald Reagan's econom
ic program.
"I told them they were wrong to oppose us at
every turn" on economic policy, Bush said after
a one-hour meeting with most of the feder
ation's 35 executive council members. "In
terms of the whole program, they are wrong in
opposing this president who is doing what he
said he'd do."
"We're politically aware and we know that
many of the leaders . . . were opposed to us in
the first place," Bush said.
Federation President Lane Kirkland, in an
equally combative mood, later called the ad
ministration's policies "Jonestown economics"
— referring to the tragedy in Guyana in which
more than 900 religious cultists committed sui
cide by drinking a cyanide-laced fruit drink.

The Reagan administration "has adminis
tered economic Kool-Aid to the poor, the
deprived, and the unemployed of this coun
try," Kirkland said after the meeting. "When
you drive people out of work and when you cut
their unemployment benefits and cut back Aid
to Families with Dependent Children, it's de
structive and harmful not only to this gener
ation, but to future generations."
Kirkland said he had used the Jonestown
analogy in the meeting with Bush.
Bush's meeting with the council members, at
Kirkland's request, occurred one day after the
federation's leaders unanimously approved a
resolution offering "an alternative to Rea
ganomics" and condemning the adminis
tration's "job-destroying, tight-money,
budget-slashing policies" that the federation
said were creating the worst economic ills
"since the great Depression."
The federation's alternative plan calls fora re
vival of public works programs, federal support
of low and middle-income housing construc
tion projects, the use of federal loan guarantees
and interest rate subsidies to help resuscitate
dying industries, the imposition of domestic
credit and import restrictions, and caps on in
come tax cuts for corporations and individuals.
It is basically the same alternative the AFL-CIO
offered in February, August and November of
last year.
Reagan calms Israeli fears
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
sought to calm Israeli fears about the possibility
of U.S. arms going to Jordan by writing Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin yesterday that
"I am determined to see that Israel's qualitative
technological edge is maintained."
The president said that Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, who on Saturday com
pleted a 10-day swing through Saudi Arabia,
Oman and Jordan, "brought me no new re
quest" from Jordan for American arms. "Any
decision on future sales to Jordan or any other
country in the region will be made in the con
text of my administration's firm commitment to
Israel's security and the need to bring peace to
the region," Reagan said in his letter released
by the White House.
The president said "recent press reports have
presented incorrect and exaggerated commen
tary regarding U.S. military assistance policies
for the Middle East."
David Gergen, White House communica
tions director, said the president was referring
to those press accounts that claimed the admin
istration was redirecting its military policies
from Israel to Arab countries. Gergen said Pen
tagon spokesman Henry Catto had told the
White House that no one on the Weinberger
plane could recall talking about such a redirec
tion.
The problem began when a Weinberger dep
uty on the plane was explaining to reporters
how recent events, such as the assassination of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the at
tempted coup against the pro-Western govern
ment of Bahrain, had changed the Pentagon's
attitude about what constituted the biggest
threat to Middle East countries. Internal sub

version and pressures on moderate goverments
by Moslem extremists now looked like a bigger
threat than a direct Soviet attack, the official
said.
Report shows Polish splits
Warsaw, Poland — A document that purports
to be the platform for Communist hard-liners
acknowledges deep splits in the party, and
makes a strong appeal to renounce the policy of
dialogue and agreement that authorities had
pursued with the independent trade union fed
eration Solidarity.
Blaming Poland's crisis on deviations from so
cialism and increased contacts with the West
under the party's previous leadership, the pa
per calls for purges of "revisionist forces" in the
party — including several top members — and
urges the party to toughen its position before
relaxing martial law.
Among those singled out for criticism was
former party leader Stanislaw Kania, who in
itiated negotiations with Solidarity.
Failure to get tough now, the report says, will
means a return to the infighting and political
and economicerosion that plagued Poland dur
ing the party's struggle with Solidarity.
Duarte urges unity
San Salvador, El Salvador — Junta President
Jose Napoleon Duarte has urged Salvadorans,
beleaguered by a bloody civil war between lef
tists and rightists, to unite against "an external
threat."
In a televised address Monday night, Duarte
also conceded leftist guerrillas "have increased
their attacks considerably" in recent days.
He said they had more help from outside the
country in their effort to overthrow his Un
supported civilian-military junta. "Again I make
a call on my countrymen without distinction to
unite against the external threat," Duarte said.
Duarte did not specify the source of the
threat. But his junta and the Reagan adminis
tration have claimed repeatedly that Cuba is
funneling arms and aid through Nicaragua to
the guerrillas. Both Nicaragua and Cuba deny
official knowledge of any such activity.
Stocks decline

more than 13 points in the first 30 minutes of

The transportation and utility measures also fell.
Gold was $375.25 per ounce in New York yes

Williams was convicted last May 1 of agreeing to trade his influence in
Congress for a hidden share of a $100 million loan from an undercover
FBI agent posing as the representative of a fictitious Arab sheik. He at
tended seven meetings over a period of months with the undercover
agents.
His encounters with the agents were recorded on videotape, as were
those of the House members caught in the sweeping congressional cor
ruption scandal. All the House members except Myers were defeated or
resigned from office. Only Williams, 62, has continued to fight the
judgment of his peers.
Williams repeated his claims of innocence again yesterday before the
sentencing in the federal courthouse in Uniondale, N.Y. "I leave this
court knowing, feeling and knowing, that I'm innocent of the crimes

charged," he said.
Government attorneys had considered the
Williams case the weakest of the Abscam group
because, unlike the House members, he turned
down a cash bribe offer and was prepped on
what to say before a key meeting by undercover
informer Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con
man.
But the jury in the trial clearly didn't find Wil
liams' testimony credible. Puccio charged yes
terday that Williams "put his office up for sale"
and then took the witness stand "to boldly lie,"
but "failed miserably."
Guatemala massacre: 43 dead
Guatemala City — Men in olive-green mili
tary garb invaded the northwestern
Guatemalan village of Calante and massacred
43 people, including six children, authorities
said yesterday.
Guatemalan television reported the victims'
throats had been cut, either with machetes or
bayonets, in theattack Monday night. Although
the killers had guns, none of the victims ap
peared to have been shot, the report said.
Police and military spokesmen said the
massacre occurred in the province of El Quiche,
about 160 miles northwest of here.
All the victims appeared to be peasants, resi
dents of Calante or other nearby villages,
Guatemalan authorities said.
A military spokesmen in Santa Cruz del
Quiche, the provincial capital, said military pa
trols were searching the area around Calante to
find the gunmen responsible for the mass
slaying.
The description of the assassins apparently
came from a 22-year-old woman who was
wounded in the attack and died while receiving
medical attention.
No group claimed responsibility for the
slayings and authorities refused to comment on
possible motives.
Church and human rights groups estimate
300 people are killed each month in
Guatemala's political violence. The death toll
appears to be rising as next month's general
elections draw near.
Bush rips AFL-CIO
Bai Harbour, Fla. — A combative Vice Presi
dent George Bush yesterdayaccused AFL-CIO
leaders of being politically biased in their op
position to President Ronald Reagan's econom
ic program.
"I told them they were wrong to oppose us at
every turn" on economic policy, Bush said after
a one-hour meeting with most of the feder
ation's 35 executive council members. "In
terms of the whole program, they are wrong in
opposing this president who is doing what he
said he'd do."
"We're politically aware and we know that
many of the leaders . . . were opposed to us in
the first place," Bush said.
Federation President Lane Kirkland, in an
equally combative mood, later called the ad
ministration's policies "Jonestown economics"
— referring to the tragedy in Guyana in which
more than 900 religious cultists committed sui
cide by drinking a cyanide-laced fruit drink.

The Reagan administration "has adminis
tered economic Kool-Aid to the poor, the
deprived, and the unemployed of this coun
try," Kirkland said after the meeting. "When
you drive people out of work and when you cut
their unemployment benefits and cut back Aid
to Families with Dependent Children, it's de
structive and harmful not only to this gener
ation, but to future generations."
Kirkland said he had used the Jonestown
analogy in the meeting with Bush.
Bush's meeting with the council members, at
Kirkland's request, occurred one day after the
federation's leaders unanimously approved a
resolution offering "an alternative to Rea
ganomics" and condemning the adminis
tration's "job-destroying, tight-money,
budget-slashing policies" that the federation
said were creating the worst economic ills
"since the great Depression."
The federation's alternative plan calls fora re
vival of public works programs, federal support
of low and middle-income housing construc
tion projects, the use of federal loan guarantees
and interest rate subsidies to help resuscitate
dying industries, the imposition of domestic
credit and import restrictions, and caps on in
come tax cuts for corporations and individuals.
It is basically the same alternative the AFL-CIO
offered in February, August and November of
last year.
Reagan calms Israeli fears
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
sought to calm Israeli fears about the possibility
of U.S. arms going to Jordan by writing Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin yesterday that
"I am determined to see that Israel's qualitative
technological edge is maintained."
The president said that Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, who on Saturday com
pleted a 10-day swing through Saudi Arabia,
Oman and Jordan, "brought me no new re
quest" from Jordan for American arms. "Any
decision on future sales to Jordan or any other
country in the region will be made in the con
text of my administration's firm commitment to
Israel's security and the need to bring peace to
the region," Reagan said in his letter released
by the White House.
The president said "recent press reports have
presented incorrect and exaggerated commen
tary regarding U.S. military assistance policies
for the Middle East."
David Gergen, White House communica
tions director, said the president was referring
to those press accounts that claimed the admin
istration was redirecting its military policies
from Israel to Arab countries. Gergen said Pen
tagon spokesman Henry Catto had told the
White House that no one on the Weinberger
plane could recall talking about such a redirec
tion.
The problem began when a Weinberger dep
uty on the plane was explaining to reporters
how recent events, such as the assassination of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the at
tempted coup against the pro-Western govern
ment of Bahrain, had changed the Pentagon's
attitude about what constituted the biggest
threat to Middle East countries. Internal sub

version and pressures on moderate goverments
by Moslem extremists now looked like a bigger
threat than a direct Soviet attack, the official
said.
Report shows Polish splits
Warsaw, Poland — A document that purports
to be the platform for Communist hard-liners
acknowledges deep splits in the party, and
makes a strong appeal to renounce the policy of
dialogue and agreement that authorities had
pursued with the independent trade union fed
eration Solidarity.
Blaming Poland's crisis on deviations from so
cialism and increased contacts with the West
under the party's previous leadership, the pa
per calls for purges of "revisionist forces" in the
party — including several top members — and
urges the party to toughen its position before
relaxing martial law.
Among those singled out for criticism was
former party leader Stanislaw Kania, who in
itiated negotiations with Solidarity.
Failure to get tough now, the report says, will
means a return to the infighting and political
and economicerosion that plagued Poland dur
ing the party's struggle with Solidarity.
Duarte urges unity
San Salvador, El Salvador — Junta President
Jose Napoleon Duarte has urged Salvadorans,
beleaguered by a bloody civil war between lef
tists and rightists, to unite against "an external
threat."
In a televised address Monday night, Duarte
also conceded leftist guerrillas "have increased
their attacks considerably" in recent days.
He said they had more help from outside the
country in their effort to overthrow his Un
supported civilian-military junta. "Again I make
a call on my countrymen without distinction to
unite against the external threat," Duarte said.
Duarte did not specify the source of the
threat. But his junta and the Reagan adminis
tration have claimed repeatedly that Cuba is
funneling arms and aid through Nicaragua to
the guerrillas. Both Nicaragua and Cuba deny
official knowledge of any such activity.

Harrison sentenced in Abscam
Washington — In the last legal action before he faces a Senate ex
pulsion vote next week, Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) was sentenced
yesterday to three years in prison and fined $50,000 for his bribery-con
spiracy conviction in the FBl's Abscam undercover investigation.
U.S. District Court Judge George Pratt delayed the sentence until Wil
liams' appeals are completed. He is the first incumbent senator since
1905 to be convicted on a criminal charge.
A Senate Ethics Committee aide said yesterday that Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) hadn't set the ground rules for the expulsion
debate except to decide that no committee business would be sched
uled. The last senator to be expelled was ousted for treason during the
Civil War.
Six House members also were convicted in the Abscam cases. Pratt
sentenced three who were tried in his court last August to three-year
prison terms and $20,000 fines. One, Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.)
was expelled from the House. None is yet in prison and none is ex
pected to serve more than 20 months.

tary garb invaded the northwestern
Guatemalan village of Calante and massacred
43 people, including six children, authorities
said yesterday.
Guatemalan television reported the victims'
throats had been cut, either with machetes or
bayonets, in theattack Monday night. Although
the killers had guns, none of the victims ap
peared to have been shot, the report said.
Police and military spokesmen said the
massacre occurred in the province of El Quiche,
about 160 miles northwest of here.
All the victims appeared to be peasants, resi
dents of Calante or other nearby villages,
Guatemalan authorities said.
A military spokesmen in Santa Cruz del
Quiche, the provincial capital, said military pa
trols were searching the area around Calante to
find the gunmen responsible for the mass
slaying.
The description of the assassins apparently
came from a 22-year-old woman who was
wounded in the attack and died while receiving
medical attention.
No group claimed responsibility for the
slayings and authorities refused to comment on
possible motives.
Church and human rights groups estimate
300 people are killed each month in
Guatemala's political violence. The death toll
appears to be rising as next month's general
elections draw near.
Bush rips AFL-CIO
Bai Harbour, Fla. — A combative Vice Presi
dent George Bush yesterdayaccused AFL-CIO
leaders of being politically biased in their op
position to President Ronald Reagan's econom
ic program.
"I told them they were wrong to oppose us at
every turn" on economic policy, Bush said after
a one-hour meeting with most of the feder
ation's 35 executive council members. "In
terms of the whole program, they are wrong in
opposing this president who is doing what he
said he'd do."
"We're politically aware and we know that
many of the leaders . . . were opposed to us in
the first place," Bush said.
Federation President Lane Kirkland, in an
equally combative mood, later called the ad
ministration's policies "Jonestown economics"
— referring to the tragedy in Guyana in which
more than 900 religious cultists committed sui
cide by drinking a cyanide-laced fruit drink.

The Reagan administration "has adminis
tered economic Kool-Aid to the poor, the
deprived, and the unemployed of this coun
try," Kirkland said after the meeting. "When
you drive people out of work and when you cut
their unemployment benefits and cut back Aid
to Families with Dependent Children, it's de
structive and harmful not only to this gener
ation, but to future generations."
Kirkland said he had used the Jonestown
analogy in the meeting with Bush.
Bush's meeting with the council members, at
Kirkland's request, occurred one day after the
federation's leaders unanimously approved a
resolution offering "an alternative to Rea
ganomics" and condemning the adminis
tration's "job-destroying, tight-money,
budget-slashing policies" that the federation
said were creating the worst economic ills
"since the great Depression."
The federation's alternative plan calls fora re
vival of public works programs, federal support
of low and middle-income housing construc
tion projects, the use of federal loan guarantees
and interest rate subsidies to help resuscitate
dying industries, the imposition of domestic
credit and import restrictions, and caps on in
come tax cuts for corporations and individuals.
It is basically the same alternative the AFL-CIO
offered in February, August and November of
last year.
Reagan calms Israeli fears
Washington — President Ronald Reagan
sought to calm Israeli fears about the possibility
of U.S. arms going to Jordan by writing Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin yesterday that
"I am determined to see that Israel's qualitative
technological edge is maintained."
The president said that Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, who on Saturday com
pleted a 10-day swing through Saudi Arabia,
Oman and Jordan, "brought me no new re
quest" from Jordan for American arms. "Any
decision on future sales to Jordan or any other
country in the region will be made in the con
text of my administration's firm commitment to
Israel's security and the need to bring peace to
the region," Reagan said in his letter released
by the White House.
The president said "recent press reports have
presented incorrect and exaggerated commen
tary regarding U.S. military assistance policies
for the Middle East."
David Gergen, White House communica
tions director, said the president was referring
to those press accounts that claimed the admin
istration was redirecting its military policies
from Israel to Arab countries. Gergen said Pen
tagon spokesman Henry Catto had told the
White House that no one on the Weinberger
plane could recall talking about such a redirec
tion.
The problem began when a Weinberger dep
uty on the plane was explaining to reporters
how recent events, such as the assassination of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and the at
tempted coup against the pro-Western govern
ment of Bahrain, had changed the Pentagon's
attitude about what constituted the biggest
threat to Middle East countries. Internal sub

version and pressures on moderate goverments
by Moslem extremists now looked like a bigger
threat than a direct Soviet attack, the official
said.
Report shows Polish splits
Warsaw, Poland — A document that purports
to be the platform for Communist hard-liners
acknowledges deep splits in the party, and
makes a strong appeal to renounce the policy of
dialogue and agreement that authorities had
pursued with the independent trade union fed
eration Solidarity.
Blaming Poland's crisis on deviations from so
cialism and increased contacts with the West
under the party's previous leadership, the pa
per calls for purges of "revisionist forces" in the
party — including several top members — and
urges the party to toughen its position before
relaxing martial law.
Among those singled out for criticism was
former party leader Stanislaw Kania, who in
itiated negotiations with Solidarity.
Failure to get tough now, the report says, will
means a return to the infighting and political
and economicerosion that plagued Poland dur
ing the party's struggle with Solidarity.
Duarte urges unity
San Salvador, El Salvador — Junta President
Jose Napoleon Duarte has urged Salvadorans,
beleaguered by a bloody civil war between lef
tists and rightists, to unite against "an external
threat."
In a televised address Monday night, Duarte
also conceded leftist guerrillas "have increased
their attacks considerably" in recent days.
He said they had more help from outside the
country in their effort to overthrow his Un
supported civilian-military junta. "Again I make
a call on my countrymen without distinction to
unite against the external threat," Duarte said.
Duarte did not specify the source of the
threat. But his junta and the Reagan adminis
tration have claimed repeatedly that Cuba is
funneling arms and aid through Nicaragua to
the guerrillas. Both Nicaragua and Cuba deny
official knowledge of any such activity.

Harrison sentenced in Abscam
Washington — In the last legal action before he faces a Senate ex
pulsion vote next week, Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) was sentenced
yesterday to three years in prison and fined $50,000 for his bribery-con
spiracy conviction in the FBl's Abscam undercover investigation.
U.S. District Court Judge George Pratt delayed the sentence until Wil
liams' appeals are completed. He is the first incumbent senator since
1905 to be convicted on a criminal charge.
A Senate Ethics Committee aide said yesterday that Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) hadn't set the ground rules for the expulsion
debate except to decide that no committee business would be sched
uled. The last senator to be expelled was ousted for treason during the
Civil War.
Six House members also were convicted in the Abscam cases. Pratt
sentenced three who were tried in his court last August to three-year
prison terms and $20,000 fines. One, Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.)
was expelled from the House. None is yet in prison and none is ex
pected to serve more than 20 months.
Williams' $50,000 fine was the largest meted out to any of the Con
gressmen convicted in the Abscam cases.
Williams was convicted last May 1 of agreeing to trade his influence in
Congress for a hidden share of a $100 million loan from an undercover
FBI agent posing as the representative of a fictitious Arab sheik. He at
tended seven meetings over a period of months with the undercover
agents.
His encounters with the agents were recorded on videotape, as were
those of the House members caught in the sweeping congressional cor
ruption scandal. All the House members except Myers were defeated or
resigned from office. Only Williams, 62, has continued to fight the
judgment of his peers.
Williams repeated his claims of innocence again yesterday before the
sentencing in the federal courthouse in Uniondale, N.Y. "I leave this
court knowing, feeling and knowing, that I'm innocent of the crimes

charged," he said.
Government attorneys had considered the
Williams case the weakest of the Abscam group
because, unlike the House members, he turned
down a cash bribe offer and was prepped on
what to say before a key meeting by undercover
informer Melvin Weinberg, a convicted con
man.
But the jury in the trial clearly didn't find Wil
liams' testimony credible. Puccio charged yes
terday that Williams "put his office up for sale"
and then took the witness stand "to boldly lie,"
but "failed miserably."
