Harrison sentenced in Abscam
Washington — In the last legal action before he faces a Senate ex
pulsion vote next week, Sen. Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) was sentenced
yesterday to three years in prison and fined $50,000 for his bribery-con
spiracy conviction in the FBl's Abscam undercover investigation.
U.S. District Court Judge George Pratt delayed the sentence until Wil
liams' appeals are completed. He is the first incumbent senator since
1905 to be convicted on a criminal charge.
A Senate Ethics Committee aide said yesterday that Majority Leader
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) hadn't set the ground rules for the expulsion
debate except to decide that no committee business would be sched
uled. The last senator to be expelled was ousted for treason during the
Civil War.
Six House members also were convicted in the Abscam cases. Pratt
sentenced three who were tried in his court last August to three-year
prison terms and $20,000 fines. One, Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.)
was expelled from the House. None is yet in prison and none is ex
pected to serve more than 20 months.
Williams' $50,000 fine was the largest meted out to any of the Con
gressmen convicted in the Abscam cases.
Williams was convicted last May 1 of agreeing to trade his influence in
Congress for a hidden share of a $100 million loan from an undercover
FBI agent posing as the representative of a fictitious Arab sheik. He at
tended seven meetings over a period of months with the undercover
agents.
His encounters with the agents were recorded on videotape, as were
those of the House members caught in the sweeping congressional cor
ruption scandal. All the House members except Myers were defeated or
resigned from office. Only Williams, 62, has continued to fight the
judgment of his peers.
Williams repeated his claims of innocence again yesterday before the
sentencing in the federal courthouse in Uniondale, N.Y. "I leave this
court knowing, feeling and knowing, that I'm innocent of the crimes

charged," he said.
