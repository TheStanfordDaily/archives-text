# Dean criticizes research guidelines

### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost
and dean of graduate studies and re
search, said yesterday that the treat
ment proposed by the federal gov
ernment is worse than the disease of
technology leaking into the hands of
the Soviet bloc.
"And the patient," Lieberman said,
referring to American universities
conducting research, "may suffer ir
reparable damage."
Speaking before an audience of
about 60 in Bechtel International
Center, Lieberman outlined past fed
eral policies on research as well as re
cent developments which include
the threatened cancellation of a visit
to the University by Soviet robotics
expert Nikolay Umnov.
Throughout the talk he reiterated
the University's stance of opposition
to attempts by the federal govern
ment to apply export regulations to
academic research.
"The proposed solution of placing
export regulations on university re
search, or placing restrictions on vis
iting scholars, will result in a research
environment which will inhibit
creative research, and thereby do ex
treme harm to our national security,"
Lieberman said.
According to Lieberman, for many

years federal regulations have re
quired commercial companies "to
obtain export licenses from the fed
eral government in order to ship cer
tain kinds of technical equipment
and related specifications to foreign
countries."
These regulations were legislated
under two separate laws.
The Arms Export Control Act au
thorized the State Department to de
velop and enforce the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
regulating the import and export of
defense articles and services. ITAR
regulations define "any technology
which advances the state of the art in
an area of significant military applica
tion in the U.S." as falling under State
Department licensing authority.
The Export Administration Act em
powered the Commerce Depart
ment to develop and enforce the Ex
port Administration Regulations
(EAR) which restrict the exportation
of goods and technology which, ac
cording to the Act, "would make a
significant contribution to the mili
tary potential of other countries
which would prove detrimental to
the U.S. national security."
"However," Lieberman said, "in
the past year or two . . . the federal
government has attempted toextend
the application of these export regu

lations to colleges and universities by
asking them to refrain from giving to
foreign scholars access to research
activities and research results in
selected high technology areas.
"Neither ITAR nor EAR restrict
data which is 'generally available to
the public,' " Lieberman said. "Since
Stanford, as well as many other Amer
ican universities, prohibits any secret
research, it is our intention that our
teaching and research activities
should be made generally available
to the public....
"Thus," he continued, "it is the
University's position that export reg
ulations should not be applied to the
University's activities."
In the past year the federal govern
ment has attempted to apply export
regulations to certain kinds of uni
versity research, according to
Lieberman, that deal primarily with
"very high speed integrated circuit
technology. In some cases the De
fense Department has attempted to
require, as a condition of funding,
that research projects be submitted
for review prior to publication."
Lieberman said that another meth

od of application of the export regu
lations has been the requirement of
written approval by the federal gov
ernment before foreign students or
researchers are allowed to work on
selected research projects, or before
permitting access to foreign scholars
to certain sensitive areas of Univer
sity research.
"Thus, in the past year or two we
have seen the government move
from their former position of regu
lating equipment and related specif
ications to the regulation of 'know
how' in a more general sense,"
Lieberman said.
According to Lieberman, the issue
is not simply the self-interest of uni
versities fighting to maintain academ
ic freedoms.
"If all the information is flowing in
one direction," he said, "this is not
genuine exchange, and such pro
gramsshould be called into question.
Further, if visiting scholars are
'agents' in disguise, it is the responsi
bility of the State Department to pro
hibit their entry into this country
rather than ask universities to restrict
the flow of information."

technology. In some cases the De
fense Department has attempted to
require, as a condition of funding,
that research projects be submitted
for review prior to publication."
Lieberman said that another meth

od of application of the export regu
lations has been the requirement of
written approval by the federal gov
ernment before foreign students or
researchers are allowed to work on
selected research projects, or before
permitting access to foreign scholars
to certain sensitive areas of Univer
sity research.
"Thus, in the past year or two we
have seen the government move
from their former position of regu
lating equipment and related specif
ications to the regulation of 'know
how' in a more general sense,"
Lieberman said.
According to Lieberman, the issue
is not simply the self-interest of uni
versities fighting to maintain academ
ic freedoms.
"If all the information is flowing in
one direction," he said, "this is not
genuine exchange, and such pro
gramsshould be called into question.
Further, if visiting scholars are
'agents' in disguise, it is the responsi
bility of the State Department to pro
hibit their entry into this country
rather than ask universities to restrict
the flow of information."
Gerald Lieberman, vice provost
and dean of graduate studies and re
search, said yesterday that the treat
ment proposed by the federal gov
ernment is worse than the disease of
technology leaking into the hands of
the Soviet bloc.
"And the patient," Lieberman said,
referring to American universities
conducting research, "may suffer ir
reparable damage."
Speaking before an audience of
about 60 in Bechtel International
Center, Lieberman outlined past fed
eral policies on research as well as re
cent developments which include
the threatened cancellation of a visit
to the University by Soviet robotics
expert Nikolay Umnov.
Throughout the talk he reiterated
the University's stance of opposition
to attempts by the federal govern
ment to apply export regulations to
academic research.
"The proposed solution of placing
export regulations on university re
search, or placing restrictions on vis
iting scholars, will result in a research
environment which will inhibit
creative research, and thereby do ex
treme harm to our national security,"
Lieberman said.
According to Lieberman, for many

years federal regulations have re
quired commercial companies "to
obtain export licenses from the fed
eral government in order to ship cer
tain kinds of technical equipment
and related specifications to foreign
countries."
These regulations were legislated
under two separate laws.
The Arms Export Control Act au
thorized the State Department to de
velop and enforce the International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
regulating the import and export of
defense articles and services. ITAR
regulations define "any technology
which advances the state of the art in
an area of significant military applica
tion in the U.S." as falling under State
Department licensing authority.
The Export Administration Act em
powered the Commerce Depart
ment to develop and enforce the Ex
port Administration Regulations
(EAR) which restrict the exportation
of goods and technology which, ac
cording to the Act, "would make a
significant contribution to the mili
tary potential of other countries
which would prove detrimental to
the U.S. national security."
"However," Lieberman said, "in
the past year or two . . . the federal
government has attempted toextend
the application of these export regu

lations to colleges and universities by
asking them to refrain from giving to
foreign scholars access to research
activities and research results in
selected high technology areas.
"Neither ITAR nor EAR restrict
data which is 'generally available to
the public,' " Lieberman said. "Since
Stanford, as well as many other Amer
ican universities, prohibits any secret
research, it is our intention that our
teaching and research activities
should be made generally available
to the public....
"Thus," he continued, "it is the
University's position that export reg
ulations should not be applied to the
University's activities."
In the past year the federal govern
ment has attempted to apply export
regulations to certain kinds of uni
versity research, according to
Lieberman, that deal primarily with
"very high speed integrated circuit
technology. In some cases the De
fense Department has attempted to
require, as a condition of funding,
that research projects be submitted
for review prior to publication."
Lieberman said that another meth

od of application of the export regu
lations has been the requirement of
written approval by the federal gov
ernment before foreign students or

sity research.
