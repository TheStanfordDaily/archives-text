# Oppenheimer urges atomic reduction

Today's nuclear arms proliferation
calls for a "reactive society": a civ
ilization that does not shy from new
learning because it fears the dangers
knowledge may hold, but reacts to
problems generated by technology
as they arise.
Frank Oppenheimer, a physicist
involved in the Manhattan project
which built the first atomic bomb,
described this ideal society to an au
dience of about 400 in Kresge
Auditorium last night and said, "I
don't think that anyone would con
quer us if we disarmed (unilat
erally)."
The renowned physicist spoke af
ter a screening of the movie The Day
After Trinity which traced the career
of his older brother, J. Robert Op
penheimer. The elder Oppenheimer
served as the technical director of the
Manhattan project.
After the detonations over

Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the older
physicist became a national celebrity.
Despite this, his security clearance
was revoked after a trial held during
the McCarthy era linked him to the
Communist party and criticized his
opposition to the development of
the hydrogen bomb.
The younger Oppenheimer, who
addressed the subject of the scien
tist's social responsibility, did not in
dulge in any "what ifs," saying that if
the United States hadn't developed
the atomic bomb, someone else

would have.
Oppenheimer said he did not re
member ever hearing his older
brother say "I made a mistake (in be
ginning the development of the
atomic bomb)." None of the scien
tists working on the Manhattan
project felt that it was a wrong step in
the beginning, according to Op
penheimer, who was once an assis
tant professor at Stanford.
"What was wrong was not that we
made the bomb," Oppenheimer in
sisted, "but that we dropped the
bomb on cities and that after we did,
we didn't change our course."
Yet Oppenheimer acknowledged
that the world cannot shove nuclear
weapons back into Pandora's box.
Even if all the facilities for designing
and manufacturing atomic weapons
were destroyed, according to Op
penheimer, scientists would be able
to rebuild them in six months.
The physicist who helped put an
end to the war with Japan addressed

the question of how nations support
what they believe without resorting
to war. He felt that this has not been
given enough thought, and cited the
United Nations as an example of an
organization devoted to peace which
was abandoned rather than per
fected.
"We need some model of a work
able world without atomic weap
ons," he insisted. "I've thought of all
kinds of schemes . . . not because
they would work but just to employ
the process..
Emphasizing that the method of
achievement through punishment
must be abandoned, Oppenheimer
said he had even dreamed up the no
tion of a "goody drop" of parachute
rigged refrigerators, cars, televisions,
and other "goodies" to coax oppo
nents to change their thinking.
"Government is a tool, not a way to
immortality," Oppenheimer said.
The audience lauded Oppenheim
with a standing ovation.
