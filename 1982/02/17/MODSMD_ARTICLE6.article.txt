# A 						'totally new concept'
## Suite housing ahead Inside 
### Jeff Biddulph 
This is the second article in a
four-part series.
The opening of the new dorms
west of Lagunita Court, currently
planned for January, 1983, will un
veil a series of suites and eating
centers unique to the University
residential system.
To Jan Van Houten, program di
rector of the new dorm complex,
this second housing group of the
three in the new residential com
plex will be a "totally new con
cept" in University residences.
Indeed, the concept isso new to
the University that it is regarded as
somewhat of an experiment. The
suite complex is unique in that it
encloses a group of three, four, six
or eight students in what amounts
to their own apartment, and each
suite is equipped with a private
bathroom and living room.
Van Houten is optimistic about
the suite arrangement and feels
that if it is successful it will be ex

tended to future housing projects.
The two 90-person houses and
the two 40-person houses which
will make up the complex will be
accompanied by several self-op
erated eating centers.
The four eating centers will
each feed 90 people. Extra spaces
will be available for eating as
sociates to join the eating centers,
which will be run by student man
agers. Everyone in the suites will
be required to purchase a board
plan from the eating centers.
The suites and eating centers
will be available for the Spring
housing draw, but those who
draw into the suites must live in
Man/anita Park Fall Quarter.
This "student juggling" has
caused Van Houten a certain
amount of consternation, she
said. Those who draw into six-per
son suites may find themselves liv
ing with two people in the four
person trailers with
whom they hadn't planned on
living at all. Those who draw for
a three-person suite will be in a
similar situation.
But, Van Houten pointed
out, the novelty and benefits of
the suites far outweigh this dis
advantage. Van Houten said
she thinks the suites will com
bine the privacy of an apart
ment with the size of a dorm to
make a pleasant living arrange
ment.
"The key to enjoying living

in the suites is choosing room
mates with whom you can get
along. Your social unit is going
to have to be your suite or your
eating center," said Van
Houten. "You may not even
ever meet the people in the
suite next door to you," she
said.
Each suite will have a living
room of approximately 17' by
17' dimensions, a bathroom
with shower, and small single
bedrooms. Each building will
also contain a kitchenette. The

two 90-person buildings will
have one eight-person suite,
which will be bi-level and
"very large," according to Van
Houten.
Will the suite experiment
prove viable? Van Houten ob
served that its success is very
dependent on one's room
mates.
"The University has supplied
all it can, and this system was
developed with a lot of student
input. The key is to live with
people you can get along
with."
Tomorrow: A report on the
dormitory complex that will be
known as Sterling Quad.
