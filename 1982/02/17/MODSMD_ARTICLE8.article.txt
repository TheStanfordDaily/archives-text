# AFL-CIO holds summit to decide policies
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bal Harbour, Fla. â€” Presi
dent Ronald Reagan'seconom
ic and military policies brought
organized labor's hawks and
doves closer than ever before
Monday as they fashioned
their own "alternative to Rea
ganomics."
Members of the AFL-ClO's
executive council are expected
to renew their opposition to
administration domestic and
foreign policy during the
week-long series of meetings
scheduled here. Vice President
George Bush and an entourage
of Reagan White House aides
and political tacticians arrived
yesterday, and Secretary of
State Alexander Haig will ad
dress the council on Friday.

Leaders of the labor feder
ation have long argued among
themselves over military poli
cies and costs, but the hawks
far outnumbered the doves
and defense expenditures
went unchallenged, except by
a few individual union officials.
However, the executive
council of the 15 million-mem
ber labor federation agreed
unanimously here to reject
what AFL-CIO president Lane
Kirkland called Reagan's "in
tolerable tradeoff."
The Constitution, he said,
imposes upon the federal gov
ernment responsibility to pro
vide "both for the general wel
fare and for the common de
fense. It does not say OR for
the common defense.

"Thisadministration has pro
posed an intolerable tradeoff,
imposing it (cost of increased
defense expenditures) upon
those who have the least to
give and who have gained the
least from the fruit of ourdem
ocratic society."
If new funds are needed for
defense, then Congress should
enact a special income tax plus
"an inescapable levy on gross
corporate earnings as
needed," the union leaders
said.
But, most significantly, they
agreed for the first time that
defense expenditures should
be examined by Congress as
closely as any domestic pro
gram.
In the past, Kirkland said,

"our working assumption has
been that it issafertoerron the
side of adequacy in a defense
budget ... If we guessed
wrong in terms of higher out
lays, all we did was waste mon
ey. But if we guessed wrong in
the other direction, we might
lose everything."
But now, Kirkland said, the
unions have a substantially
greater degree of skepticism
about defense expenditures,
partly because of the failure of
the administration to explain
properly its own defense pro
grams, "particularly when this
administration is taking it (de
fense costs) out of the hide of
the poor and exempting the
rich."
William Winpisinger, presi

dent of the International As
sociation of Machinists and a
frequent critic of previous AFL
CIO stances on defense, said,
"I'm still not sure about the
final outcome of this but cer
tainly we on the executive
council are closer together
than we've ever been before."
Albert Shanker, president of
the American Federation of
Teachers, a self-described "su
per hawk," said:
"As a nation, we cannot af
ford to accept the 'guns and no
butter' economics of Reagan.
Imagine what would happen if
we had asked for a 37 percent
increase in expenditures for
social programs and then said
we'd figure out later how we
wanted to spend it."
