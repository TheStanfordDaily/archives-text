# GM reduces western operations
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Detroit — Squeezed by high
operating costs and depressed
sales, General Motors Corp.
said Monday it will halt car pro
duction at two of its California
assembly plants, idling 5050
workers.
The plants are at South Gate,
in Southern California, and
Fremont, in Northern Califor
nia. The company labeled the
closings "indefinite" and of
ficials held out little hope that
the factories may reopen soon.
"There is just no estimate of
when they will reopen," a GM
spokesman said at company
headquarters in Detroit. "This
is strictly a question of market
demand."
Analysts viewed the plant
closings as a major retrenching
by the automaker following its
recent failure to either win
wage concessions from its em
ployees or stimulate its car sales
with costly rebate programs.
"GM is doing exactly what it
said it was going to do when it
opened the contract talks with
the United Auto Workers,"
one industry analyst said. "The
company told the union that if
it couldn't get concessions, it
was going to make money the
best way it could."
The closing of the two Cali
fornia factories will leave the
GM plant in Los Angeles as the
automaker's only assembly fa
cility west of Kansas City.
But sales of nearly all GM
cars have been weak for the last
several months, and the halt of
production at South Gate il
lustrated just how severe the
slump has become forthe giant
automaker. The factory builds

the Chevrolet Cavalier and
Cadillac Cimarron, a new line
of subcompact, front-wheel
drive cars that went on the
market less than a year ago.
GM aimed its so-called J-cars
squarely at the customers who
had been gobbling up
Japanese and European im
ports and said the autos would
help the industry regain some
of the market share it had been
losing to foreign manufac
turers of small, fuel-efficient
cars.
But potential buyers recoiled
at the cars' high prices and
sluggish performance, and J
car sales have been disastrous.
At current sales rates Chevrolet
dealers have enough Cavaliers
on their lots to last through No
vember, and Cadillac dealers
have a six-month supply of
Cimarrons.
The company recently began
paying rebates of from $500 to
$2000 to buyers of several of its
models, including the J-cars.
Sales figures released Monday
for the first 10 days of February
showed that although sales
were virtually unchanged from
a year ago, there had been
some sales improvement since
January. However, analysts
cauti.oned that January sales
were down sharply.
Production at South Gate has
been suspended since the first
of the month to help reduce
dealer inventories of unsold J
cars and was scheduled to re
main shut down at least
through the end of February.
UAW officials at the plant
were surprised by the an
nouncement of the closing.
"We really don't know

where we're going at this
point," said Henry Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the UAW local
at South Gate.
Gonzalez said he expects
most of the affected workers to
qualify for GM's Supplemental
Unemployment Benefits,
which provide laid-off workers
with 95 percent of their pay for
up to a year.
In announcing that the
plants will be closed, GM also
said production at some of its
other factories will be in
creased and a number of laid
off workers rehired. As a result
of the production shuffles, a
net total of 2400 GM workers
around the country will be laid
off.
GM first cut back production
at South Gate in November,
when it laid off 1800 employees
and eliminated the second shift
at the plant.

In making the announce
ment to close the South Gate
facility, GM also said it will add
a second shift to its J-car plant
in Lordstown, Ohio, essentially
shifting J-car capacity from
South Gate to Lordstown. The
company is scheduled to open
two more J-car plants, in Wis
consin and Missouri, in the
next few months to build Buick
and Oldsmobile versionsof the
car. An official said Cadillac
Cimarron production will be
shifted to the Wisconsin plant.
The shutdown of the Fre
mont plant is another ominous
sign for the automaker. The
factory recently was retooled
to manufacturer a new line of
front-wheel-drive, mid-sized
cars, the Chevrolet Celebrity
and Oldsmobile Ciera. Dealers
had more than a six-month
supply of the two models on
hand at the end of January.

In making the announce
ment to close the South Gate
facility, GM also said it will add
a second shift to its J-car plant
in Lordstown, Ohio, essentially
shifting J-car capacity from
South Gate to Lordstown. The
company is scheduled to open
two more J-car plants, in Wis
consin and Missouri, in the
next few months to build Buick
and Oldsmobile versionsof the
car. An official said Cadillac
Cimarron production will be
shifted to the Wisconsin plant.
The shutdown of the Fre
mont plant is another ominous
sign for the automaker. The
factory recently was retooled
to manufacturer a new line of
front-wheel-drive, mid-sized
cars, the Chevrolet Celebrity
and Oldsmobile Ciera. Dealers
had more than a six-month
supply of the two models on
hand at the end of January.
Detroit — Squeezed by high
operating costs and depressed
sales, General Motors Corp.
said Monday it will halt car pro
duction at two of its California
assembly plants, idling 5050
workers.
The plants are at South Gate,
in Southern California, and
Fremont, in Northern Califor
nia. The company labeled the
closings "indefinite" and of
ficials held out little hope that
the factories may reopen soon.
"There is just no estimate of
when they will reopen," a GM
spokesman said at company
headquarters in Detroit. "This
is strictly a question of market
demand."
Analysts viewed the plant
closings as a major retrenching
by the automaker following its
recent failure to either win
wage concessions from its em
ployees or stimulate its car sales
with costly rebate programs.
"GM is doing exactly what it
said it was going to do when it
opened the contract talks with
the United Auto Workers,"
one industry analyst said. "The
company told the union that if
it couldn't get concessions, it
was going to make money the
best way it could."
The closing of the two Cali
fornia factories will leave the
GM plant in Los Angeles as the
automaker's only assembly fa
cility west of Kansas City.
But sales of nearly all GM
cars have been weak for the last
several months, and the halt of
production at South Gate il
lustrated just how severe the
slump has become forthe giant
automaker. The factory builds

the Chevrolet Cavalier and
Cadillac Cimarron, a new line
of subcompact, front-wheel
drive cars that went on the
market less than a year ago.
GM aimed its so-called J-cars
squarely at the customers who
had been gobbling up
Japanese and European im
ports and said the autos would
help the industry regain some
of the market share it had been
losing to foreign manufac
turers of small, fuel-efficient
cars.
But potential buyers recoiled
at the cars' high prices and
sluggish performance, and J
car sales have been disastrous.
At current sales rates Chevrolet
dealers have enough Cavaliers
on their lots to last through No
vember, and Cadillac dealers
have a six-month supply of
Cimarrons.
The company recently began
paying rebates of from $500 to
$2000 to buyers of several of its
models, including the J-cars.
Sales figures released Monday
for the first 10 days of February
showed that although sales
were virtually unchanged from
a year ago, there had been
some sales improvement since
January. However, analysts
cauti.oned that January sales
were down sharply.
Production at South Gate has
been suspended since the first
of the month to help reduce
dealer inventories of unsold J
cars and was scheduled to re
main shut down at least
through the end of February.
UAW officials at the plant
were surprised by the an
nouncement of the closing.
"We really don't know

where we're going at this
point," said Henry Gonzalez, a
spokesman for the UAW local
at South Gate.
Gonzalez said he expects
most of the affected workers to
qualify for GM's Supplemental
Unemployment Benefits,
which provide laid-off workers
with 95 percent of their pay for
up to a year.
In announcing that the
plants will be closed, GM also
said production at some of its
other factories will be in
creased and a number of laid
off workers rehired. As a result
of the production shuffles, a
net total of 2400 GM workers
around the country will be laid
off.
GM first cut back production
at South Gate in November,
when it laid off 1800 employees
and eliminated the second shift
at the plant.
