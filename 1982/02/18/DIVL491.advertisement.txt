"Everything in Sight" can make you a new pair of glasses
in only one hour. We can do it this quickly because:
We have over a thousand metal and plastic frames to
choose from. We have thousands of "uncut" pre-ground prescription
plastic and glass lenses in stock, and we have the most modern
equipment to do the job quickly and accurately So if you choose
our frame and we have the lenses you need in stock, you really can
have complete glasses in one hour. Bifocals and trifocals will take
longer to make, but we can make them for you, fast
Best of all, we actually charge less for this unique service,
with single vision lenses from $25. We also have over a hundred
frames at $10 each, and the rest are priced lower than you'd
find elsewhere for comparable quality.
