### Douglas Jehl 
Juniors Mike Teeuws and Gary
Wimmer were arrested yesterday by
Stanford police in connection with
vandalism done to the front door of
Encina Station early last Friday morn
ing during a Valentine's Day party.
Teeuws and Wimmer turned
themselves in to Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington yesterday
afternoon, after learning that a war
rant had been issued for their arrest.
They were then transported to the
North County jail and booked on
charges of vandalism. Teeuws and
Wimmer were later released on their
own recognizance at 10:30 p.m., after
spending more than five hoursthere.
Encina Station had been rented by
Manzanita Trailer Park resident assis
tants (RAs) for the Thursday night
party, according to Manzanita RA
Katy Dore. Dore said that the front
door was "stuck" and that two guys
started holding onto it. "Then they
just grabbed the door and tore it off,"
she said.
Dore said that most of the people
at the party were unawareof the inci
dent because "they were up in front
dancing to the band." Police were
called to the scene at 12:30 a.m. Fri
day, according to Stanford police
Captain Raoul Niemeyer.
Dione Timrock, manager of Encina
Station, said the establishment has
repaired the door and that those re
sponsible have agreed to pay for it.
She said that a young man came in
yesterday to inquire about being
billed for the door. "I was really sur
prised he came in," she said. "He said
he was extremely sorry."
The police obtained warrants for
the arrests of Wimmer and Teeuws
early yesterday after filing a report
