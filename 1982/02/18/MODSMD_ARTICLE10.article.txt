## The 						Coffeehouse — run by students for students 
### Steve Kaufman 
With price hikes, crowded
tables and alcohol restrictions
versus potential expansion and
a 15 percent revenue increase,
the Daily has sought out to fine
out just how well the Coffee
House is doing after nearly two
years of student management.
According to most everyone
involved, the Coffee House is
doing just fine,
"It's a Stanford place," said
Steve Weiss, manager of Cof
fee House, Inc. "You can see it
in the sandwich maker who
smiles in the line, and you can
see it in the way people enjoy
themselves here. We're build
ing a student business for stu
dent use and we're pleased
with the results so far."
The change in such a short
period stems not from ex
tensive remodeling, but from
more subtle changes in what
the purpose of the Coffee
House should be. "We only
moved some plants around
and changed the lighting a
bit," said Weiss. "It's our at
titude that is totally new."
Before the Coffee House
changed hands in May 1980,
the Coffee House, Union
Crossroads and Encina Station
were run by Tautede Suite
(TDS), a subsidiary of
Gukenheimer Corporation
which Weiss said he felt "was
more interested in making a
fast buck than meeting student
needs." When their contract
expired, bidding was opened
up and numerous companies
submitted applications.
A group of students, feeling
dissatisfied with the at
mosphere and attitude of the
Coffee House, also submitted a
proposal to manage the restau
rant. Problems arose when
noneof the companies bidding
would manage Encina or
Crossroads without the Coffee
House, thus killing the idea for
a student-run business.
Towards the closure of the bid
ding process, Servomation, a
food service company, offered
to take the two by themselves,
and Coffee House, Inc. was
awarded a contract.
"The major difference,"
commented Weiss, "between
then and now is who we em
ploy." Whereas before May
1980, the staff was mostly full
time, non-students, the Coffee
House now employs only six
fulltime positions out of 150.
The rest are comprised totally
of students.
It is the students that make
the Coffee House unique, ac
cording Chris Greene, mem
ber of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, chairman of the
board and president of Coffee
House, Inc.
"The students own the Cof
fee House," he said. "We are

therefore much more sensitive
to student needs and desires. It
has helped to create a great at
mosphere."
The result of this shift in at
titude, according to Greene, is
easy to see. "We are literally
bursting at the seams," he
commented. "Sales have
doubled since the change of
hands nearly two years ago.
This is an indicator to me of
how we're doing; the changes
we've gone through are really
starting to pay off."
However, the first year of the
student-run Coffee House
ended up financially poor, with
costs exceeding profits. This, in
part with the rising food costs,

led to a near 20 percent price
increase at the beginning of
the school year.
"I was really torn," com
mented Weiss. "It hurt when
people said we were trying to
make an excessive profit. The
point is, we get no subsidies
from ASSU, what we take in
over the counter pays our
bills." As it stands this year,
Weiss said he feels that prices
wil not be increased until late
this summer.
Despite the sharpness of the
increase, patronage continues
to be heavy. "It's not getting
the people in that's the prob
lem," said Mariann Byerwalter,
another COP member, "it's
finding a way to accomodate
them."
To help relieve this problem,

plans are currently being
drawn up for construction of
an outdoor patio on the
Dinkenspiel-side of the Coffee
House. Though costs of the
project may exceed $15,000,
Greene feels it to be a very
cost-effective proposal.
"I've been pushing the idea
ever since I assumed office,"
said Greene. "Students desper
ately need a place to sit outside
and eat while listening to music
or just talking, even at night.
This proposal is not only a plus
to the Coffee House, but to the
image and appearance of Tres
idder as a whole." Byerwalter
added that competition with
Union Crossroads presents no

major difficulties. After
$250,000 in remodeling costs,
business there has increased to
over 40 percent, something she
feels will remain unchanged by
the new addition.
One concern over the pro
posal, as well as with the image
of the Coffee House, is that of
alcohol. "When the accident
which killed two students hap
pened in November," com
mented Byerwalter, "Chris and
I re-evaluated the idea of the
patio." Fears of the Coffee
House becoming an Oasis-type
establishment were raised.
According to Byerwalter,
"we couldn't be oblivious to
this very real and potential
problem." However, ideas
such as not selling beer in
pitchers and playing down al

cohol when promoting the
patio are being considered to
combat these fears.
Though the Coffee House's
image and sales look brighter
after two years of student man
agement, severe problems still
remain. Greg Larson, assistant
director of Tresidder, said he
feels continuity to be one ma
jor concern.
"The idea of a student-run
business is terrific," he stated,
"but each year, the COP
changes, and with it, ideas on
how a business should be run.
For us at Tresidder, it some
times creates policy prob
lems."
Commenting on this, Weiss
praised the full-time employ
ees of both ASSU and Tres
idder. "They are the key to pro
viding some continuity be
tween years."
Greene also added that
changes in the corporate struc
ture of Coffee House, Inc., will
help to maintain continuity be
tween school years. "We are
redesigning who from the COP
will serve on the Coffee House
board of directors," he said.
"There are simply too many is
sues for one person to learn ev
erything about both organiza
tions and do a good job at the

same time." Greater involve
ment of the ASSU Senate, as
well as splitting up key corpo
rate positions among more
people are parts of Greene's
plan.
Larson also expressed con
cern over the various types of
on-campus eating services
available. "The Coffee House is
very popular," he stated, "but
we also have to look at other
things. Encina Station, for ex
ample, is extremely popular on
weekends for its pub-like at
mosphere and dancing. In our
considerations of improve
ments, do we want to make a
good Coffee House better, or a
medium Fncina a good one?
All this takes a considerable
amount of decision making."
In addition, making sure that
all three establishments work
cooperatively is an important
issue. "The clientele which the
Coffee House attracts is dif
ferent than one who patron
izes Union Crossroads. It's our
job not to duplicate food types
in one establishment as to give
them an advantage over anoth
er." By avoiding such actions
(i.e., providing Union
Crossroads with an expresso
machine, one currently lo
cated in the Coffee House),

Larson feels that the three busi
nesses can operate better to
gether.
What this means to the Cof
fee House is less time devoted
to making money and more to
creating a good place to eat, a
goal which Weiss says "is what
we set out to do when we
started." One example of
adherence to this policy is the
new management training pro
grams, currently in its second
year. The idea behind this is to
train students as night man
agers who are completely re
sponsible for running, closing
and locking the Coffee House.
"They run the show," said
Weiss. "Once I leave, the re
sponsibility is theirs."
Weiss is impressed with the
program's success, judging by
several letters written to him by
past night managers now em
ployed outside of the Univer
sity. "The response is terrific.
People say that the experience
of working here has really
helped them to adjust to out
side business life. As it is, we
have many more applicants
than positions open."
"I have great confidence in

Weiss," added Byerwalter. "He
is extremely qualified and is a
good person to learn manage
rial skills from." She also cited
him as one of the key elements
of the Coffee House's popu
larity. "He does a great job,"
she stated, "and has helped to
promote not only the Coffee
House, but the image of the
whole Union as well."
With only three months left
until the second-year an
niversary of the student-run
Coffee House, the answer to
the question of the Coffee
House's well being seems to be
positive. The proposed patio
and potential for business
growth leaves no question in
Weiss' mind as to the future of
the Coffee House. "I don't
know of any other business or
food-service organization on a
campus that does $800,000 to
$900,000 a year in business,
with a full-time staff of part
time students. We serve not
only great food, but an at
mosphere where students
come together, employee and
customer alike, to have a good
time. That is why everyone
smiles around here."
