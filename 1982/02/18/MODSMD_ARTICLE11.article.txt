## Andrew Bennett Read 'Terminal Harm': 1982 
### 
Editor's Note: The following is an
excerpt from an unpublished novel
by George Orwell which was only re
cently discovered. It appears from
the nature of the manuscript that the
remarkably prophetic Orwell had in
tended this work to bring together
Animal Farm and 1984 in a trilogy. It is
not clear from the manuscript, but
Orwell evidently intended the title of
this work to be either 1982 or Termi
nal Harm.
"... and as he passed the large
video screen, john Q. noticed the
slogans of Big Brother, who had just
won in a landslide election. The
slogans had actually been there for
some time and john Q. had heard
them often enough, but he had a
rather short memory and could only
read slowly, so he asked Wright Wing
to read them out loud. Unfortunate
ly, Wright could not read at all, so he
asked D. Emma Cratze to read them
aloud. D. Emma spat angrily at the
sidewalk and grudgingly recited:
Government deficits are the pri
mary cause of the greatest inflation
and highest inflation rates this coun
try has ever known.
I have firmly registered myopinion
against those who are for the draft
and I will not institute a peacetime
draft.
I will strengthen the military, cut
taxes, stop inflation and balance the
budget by 1984.

The essential social programs such
as the school lunch program, which
comprise a social safety net which
catchesand aids the poor, will not be
weakened.
Next year, this country will ex-

Wright Wing clapped
his hands in delight as
fohn Q. stared at the
slogans quizzically,
reassuring himself
that they had really
not changed after all.
Phil T. Rich nodded
approvingly and
declared "/ will work
harder/' Minora T.
Poore glanced at him
nervously and half
whispered "I wish I
could work at all"

perience a tremendous surge in eco
nomic growth.
As D. Emma mumbled these
slogans, Wright eagerly shouted out
the words so that all could hear. Phil
T. Rich nodded approvingly and sol

emnly intoned "I will work harder,"
whie John Q., who had already for
gotten the first quotation, attempted
to make out the words. Minora T.
Poore, frightened by the shouting of
her perennial adversary, looked to D.
Emma for assurance but D. Emma
merely scowled.
Some months later, John Q. no
ticed that the slogans seemed to have
changed in some way. John asked D.
Emma to read them out loud, and D.
Emma, after cursing softly under her
breath, once again recited the
slogans on the screen:
Government deficits are the
greatest cause of inflation.
I have registered my opinion
against those who are for the draft.
I will strengthen the military, cut
taxes, stop inflation, and balance the
budget by 7987.
A social safety net will catch up the
poor and needy with programs such
as the school lunch program.
Next year, this country will ex
perience a tremendous surge in eco
nomic growth."
Wright Wing clapped his hands in
delight as John Q. stared at the
slogans quizzically, reassuring
himself that they had really not
changed after all. Phil T. Rich nodded
approvingly and declared "I will
work harder." Minora T. Poore

glanced at him nervously and half
whispered "I wish I could work at
all," as D. Emma Cratze glared fierce
ly but said nothing for fear of Big
Brother.
A little more than a year had passed
since Big Brother's election by the
next time John Q. thought he no
ticed something different about the
slogans. Unfortunately, D. Emma was
not around to read them and the only
others who could read were also
absent — Phil T. was spending his tax

cut on a vacation in Bermuda and Mi
nora T. was looking for a job. John Q.
slowly made out the words and told
them to Wright Wing one at a time:
Government deficits are the
greatest. Register for the draft. I will
strengthen the military, cut taxes,
slow inflation, and balance the
budget by 7977. Ketchup is a vegeta
ble when served in school lunches.
Next year, this country will ex
perience a tremendous surge in eco
nomic growth.

Wright Wing could scarcely con
tain his joy and danced about as he
chanted praises of Big Brother. John
Q., who was almost certain that he
had seen the last slogan before and
was fairly sure that the rest were also
unchanged but could not be positive
because he had already forgotten
them, tried once again to make out
the words.

approvingly and declared "I will
work harder." Minora T. Poore

glanced at him nervously and half
whispered "I wish I could work at
all," as D. Emma Cratze glared fierce
ly but said nothing for fear of Big
Brother.
A little more than a year had passed
since Big Brother's election by the
next time John Q. thought he no
ticed something different about the
slogans. Unfortunately, D. Emma was
not around to read them and the only
others who could read were also
absent — Phil T. was spending his tax

cut on a vacation in Bermuda and Mi
nora T. was looking for a job. John Q.
slowly made out the words and told
them to Wright Wing one at a time:
Government deficits are the
greatest. Register for the draft. I will
strengthen the military, cut taxes,
slow inflation, and balance the
budget by 7977. Ketchup is a vegeta
ble when served in school lunches.
Next year, this country will ex
perience a tremendous surge in eco
nomic growth.

Wright Wing could scarcely con
tain his joy and danced about as he
chanted praises of Big Brother. John
Q., who was almost certain that he
had seen the last slogan before and
was fairly sure that the rest were also
unchanged but could not be positive
because he had already forgotten
them, tried once again to make out
the words.

Editor's Note: The following is an
excerpt from an unpublished novel
by George Orwell which was only re
cently discovered. It appears from
the nature of the manuscript that the
remarkably prophetic Orwell had in
tended this work to bring together
Animal Farm and 1984 in a trilogy. It is
not clear from the manuscript, but
Orwell evidently intended the title of
this work to be either 1982 or Termi
nal Harm.
"... and as he passed the large
video screen, john Q. noticed the
slogans of Big Brother, who had just
won in a landslide election. The
slogans had actually been there for
some time and john Q. had heard
them often enough, but he had a
rather short memory and could only
read slowly, so he asked Wright Wing
to read them out loud. Unfortunate
ly, Wright could not read at all, so he
asked D. Emma Cratze to read them
aloud. D. Emma spat angrily at the
sidewalk and grudgingly recited:
Government deficits are the pri
mary cause of the greatest inflation
and highest inflation rates this coun
try has ever known.
I have firmly registered myopinion
against those who are for the draft
and I will not institute a peacetime
draft.
I will strengthen the military, cut
taxes, stop inflation and balance the
budget by 1984.

The essential social programs such
as the school lunch program, which
comprise a social safety net which
catchesand aids the poor, will not be
weakened.

Wright Wing clapped
his hands in delight as

slogans quizzically,
reassuring himself
that they had really
not changed after all.

As D. Emma mumbled these
slogans, Wright eagerly shouted out
the words so that all could hear. Phil
T. Rich nodded approvingly and sol

emnly intoned "I will work harder,"
whie John Q., who had already for
gotten the first quotation, attempted
to make out the words. Minora T.
Poore, frightened by the shouting of
her perennial adversary, looked to D.
Emma for assurance but D. Emma
merely scowled.
Some months later, John Q. no
ticed that the slogans seemed to have
changed in some way. John asked D.
Emma to read them out loud, and D.
Emma, after cursing softly under her
breath, once again recited the
slogans on the screen:
Government deficits are the
greatest cause of inflation.
I have registered my opinion
against those who are for the draft.
I will strengthen the military, cut
taxes, stop inflation, and balance the
budget by 7987.
A social safety net will catch up the
poor and needy with programs such
as the school lunch program.
