## Thinking in terms of military solutions is a vicious circle 
### 
When we talk about Israel's security, we usually mean military security; but
is military security real security?
I think of peace as the only real security. Having experienced two wars as a
front-line soldier, I recognize that winning wars has not led to increased se
curity. In fact, each war has actually led to more casualties, more suffering and
more hatred between Israel and the Arab nations. We might win this war...
the next... and the next — but will we soldiers survive them? What will hap
pen to the state of Israel if we should lose a war?
Thinking in terms of military security and winning wars locks both sides into
a vicious circle, damaging the chances of achieving real security in peace.
Winning wars, crushing opponents and maintaining a constant readiness to
react against enemies, have led to a situation where each side de-humanizes
the other — everyone is the "enemy": soldiers, civilians, women and chil
dren.
The atrocities done in the name of security prevent "us" from seeing
"them" as humans, as the only partners in a negotiation process that might
bring peace. We cannot perceive "them" as equals with whom we can discuss
issues that affect us both. But it is only with our enemies that we need to make

peace — not with our friends.
Even our military security is weakened because of our continuing control
over 1.1 million Palestinians in the occupied territories. As time goes by, the
Palestinians have become increasingly organized in their opposition. This has
required an increasing diversion of military resources to police the popu
lation and to protect the Jewish settlements. This diversion has not only re
duced our readiness against external aggression but has had a detrimental ef
fect on the character of the Israel Defense Forces. (1.D.F.)
Instead of serving only to protect the public from external military threats, it
has increasingly become a tool to control the internal civilian population.
This role has undermined the unquestioned confidence most Israelis have
had in the activities of the IDF. Many of my friends have expressed discomfort
in the role of soldiers in an army of occupation.
Because of the Israeli army's rule over the civilian population and the in
creasingly servere measures that are necessary in response to the ever increas
ing opposition, we have become identified as an aggressor in the interna
tional community. Since Israel is dependent upon military and economic aid
from abroad, a cut-off of this aid would be a very serious threat to our ex

istence.
The continuing state of war also has a damaging effect on the fabric of Israeli
society. We have become a society in siege. The habit of thinking in terms of
military solutions has created on aggressiveness that pervades all aspects of
life. In particular, political criticism is perceived as a threat and is violently op
posed. But the viability of our society is dependent on a diversity of opinion
and constructive internal debate about those opinions.
We have internal problems, between Ashkenazis and Sephardic Jews, be
tween secular and religious opinions. These problems require immediate at
tention because of the danger they pose to the unity of our society. But these
problems have been pushed aside because of the continuing wars.
Thus, I perceive a need for peace that will allow us to build a better quality
of life for all Israelis. My confidence in finding partners in a negotiating proc
ess rests with those forward-looking Palestinians who perceive similar re
quirement for their own people. We must work hard to convince each other
that peace is in our own best interests.
