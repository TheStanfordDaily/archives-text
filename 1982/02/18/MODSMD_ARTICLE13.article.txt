## Shortsighted messianism transforms violence into strength for peace 
### 
I applaud the Daily editorial of Feb.
9 on the continuing violations of hu
man rights in El Salvador. Those of us
who fear that one Vietnam may not
be enough can take heart that there
seems to be a stirring of American
conscience. I was particularly struck
by the editorial's rejection of the
"simplistic world view .. . that cold
war outlook." That this has been said
in the shadow of Hoover Tower,
presents a wonderfully neat image.
The nonsense spouted by Presi
dent Ronald Reagan, that winning
the arms race will insure that none of
this generation's blood will be spilled
in war, is not convincing the public.
The central assumption is that world

war is the automatic morality of
America, citadel of liberty, which
tranforms American violence into
"strength for peace." The per
sistence of racial injustice, economic
coercion and imperialistic violence
in American society has struck at the
illusion that there is something "spe
cial" in American institutions or na
tional character which lifted us above
the normal strife found in human
communities.
We now know that, while we are
the beneficiaries of a remarkable his
tory and great wealth, moral am
biguity and guilt over national sins
such as Vietnam and El Salvador — or
the racism and imperialism of the

19th Century — deniesthe presump
tion of moral superiority. I find this
encouraging because our history will
become available to us when we stop
defending it. The same may be true
of our wealth, if we can pry it loose
from the greedy and the paranoid.
It is mindboggling to consider the
amount being wasted on military
hardware. Pose, for example, the $34
billion we are spending for the
Navy's F-18 fighter program against
modernizing America's machine
tool stock to bring it to the average
level of Japan's. What kind of na
tional security can an arms race
which prevents needed social expen
ditures provide?

At the same time, I find the Rea
ganomics assumption that the only
way our national wealth can be used
efficiently for the general good is to
bribe the rich both depressing and
absurd. Of all the things which may
trickle down, neither wealth nor
power are to be found. Besides, it was
the promise that unleashing private
enterprise would produce more than
a king's controlled franchise or sub
sequent collective economic systems
which has justified current ine
qualities. It is the duty of the rich to
invest in socially useful enterprise, or
so early Americans believed. They
also ended to assume that their
wealth was evidence that God in-

tended them to be the judge of what
was useful.
They would not have understood
how this very rich people could be so
stingy and short-sighted, nor would
they have accepted the militarism
and authoritarianism of the state un
critically! I also believe that they
would have understood how impor
tant it is to be on freedom's side and
to have some vision of a just society
requiring moral behavior.
Peace advocates may divide today,
as they have traditionally, on the use
of violence or preference of social
systems, but we can unite in defense
of human rights, an end to the arms

race and our need to turn our
creativity and productivity to solving
pressing social and environmental
questions. The Cold War has become
too expensive a luxury to continue.
Those who cling to the ideology of
American Messianism will continue
to preach that tyranny is freedom,
the status quo is progress, martial law
fosters democracy and that war is
peace. This time, however, they will
find us unwilling to buy Cold War
mythology and unable to afford the
waste and destruction we have toler
ated in the past.
