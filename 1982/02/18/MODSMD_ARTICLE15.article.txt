## Ah, the years in Leakage and State 1981-2025 
### 
I was an eager young buck when I started at the State Department way back
when. Just out of college and ready for action.
I knew even then that I wanted to save the world from communism. I was
terribly excited by the thought of going to work in Washington, D.C., just at
the time when the Reagan Administration was coming to power. They knew
how the world was. That Al Haig, for instance, sure knew how to keep those
communists in their place. "I'm in control here," he always reminded us.
Under Haig, the Department had an unflinching commitment to it's goal of
stopping world communism. We realized the importance of eliminating tech
nology transfer.
Oh sure, it took us some time to learn how to preserve our precious Ameri
can scientific knowledge. There was this Dr. Nickolay Umnov, a "scholar" in
specialized robots for the Soviet Union. He got out of our grasp. We let those
soft academicians over at the National Academy of Sciences handle the matter
and in no time at all he was freely wandering around university campuses, ob
serving myriads of invaluable research.
It still makes me bristle with pride to remember the way our boys at State
put a lid on that one. Naturally enough, soon after Umnov's visit a flood of
Soviet "scholars" requested a visit to see American technological research.
This time, we didn't let those soft academicians around the rules. Since scien
tists didn't have the patriotic nerve to stop commie "students" from getting
their spying eyes on our precious secret technology, we kept those spies
("scholars") out of the universities. No more visits.
About five years later the Department realizes that merely keeping the So
viet students out of our schools wouldn't do it. We kept all Warsaw Pact stu
dents from visiting any universities. Later any libraries. Then bookstores, sci
ence and technology museums and video arcades. After catching a Polish
citizen trying to smuggle out a Sony Jogman radio/mini-microwave oven we
decided to close the borders to all Soviet and Eastern European citizens. By
lobbying Congress intensively we got the unprecedented 1994 Makarthy-
Nicksen bill passed, stopping mail to those crafty villains.
Soon after that I was appointed to head the newly formed Leakage Division
of the State Department. It didn't take me long to realize that the Russians
would get our precious technology any way they could. From Western Eu
rope, for example.
In 1998 we got President Kemp to issue the directive stopping all technology
exchange. Soon we realized that to be safe we'd have to stop ail contact with
foreign countries. We sealed our borders. The only foreigners we allowed

were embassy officials whom we closely watched.
We realized that our enemies could still get information from Americans
who were going overseas. We stopped all visas. And we stopped all interna
tional mail â€” in or out.
At the end of the last decade, the Leakage Division got an upgrading. We
became the Department of Leakage and State. DLS. was then able to eliminate
foreign language education in our precious schools.
We came to our senses and realized that even closely watched embassies
could spy. So we made sure that countries could only have embassies if none
of their embassy personnel spoke English. After all, how much could they
steal, if they didn't speak the language?
I'm glad to say that I was able to retire from Leakage and State last year with
a clear conscious at having kept American technology at home.
And we got things under control just in the nick of time. Our new, liberal
president wants to start that archaic business of summit meetings and detente.
Fortunately they can't find anyone to interpret who speaks both Russian and
English. (I wonder if the rumors about training an arms control delegation in
pantomime are true?)
I wish Alexander Haig were alive today so I could personally thank him for
the glorious example his Department set by keeping enemy students away
from our precious technology.
