# Local group seeking funds
## Community ice rink in the offing? 
### Mark Zeigler 
Right now, the land occupies a three
acre plot rich in bayland mud and
weeds. It is vacant now, bordered by a driv
ing range, the 10th green of Palo Alto's
Municipal Golf Course, and Geng and Em
barcadero roads.
If Marvin Lee has his way, this land will
become a multi-million dollar ice skating
and hockey center by the fall of 1983. He
plans to replace Palo Alto's Winter Club,
which will close in April of that year. Lee, a
Palo Alto resident who heads a group
called Friends of the Winter Club, sees the
new center — to be called Friendship Pavil
ion — as serving not only Palo Alto, but
Stanford and surrounding communities as
well.
The owner of the Winter Club, Duncan
Williams, built the rink 25 years ago on
privately-owned land. It is the only out
door rink in the Western U.S.. According
to the terms of the lease, which expires in
April, 1983, it must be torn down.
Lee's proposal includes the construction
of one indoor and one outdoor rink. The
latter would feature a roof over the south
east half to protect the ice from sun and
rain. In the summer, the outdoor rink
could be used as a theater. Last month, the
Palo Alto City Council leased to the
Friends of the Winter Club the east
Bayshore Freeway (1-101) public land at a
nominal one dollar per year rent.
The indoor arena for year-round ice play
would have ice hockey facilities capable of
housing the Stanford Hockey Club. The
players presently call a rink in Belmont
home, as the Winter Club is too small to ac
comodate hockey.
Dave Wright, president of the Stanford
Hockey and Skating Club, is excited about
moving the program closer to the campus.

"It's a lot more convenient to play at a
home rink a few miles away than 15 miles
away," he said. "The rink we play at
doesn't even have showers."
Third year player David Spear, who en
visions the hockey team as "one of the bet
ter clubs in almost all of Northern Califor
nia besides pro teams," said he believes
Friendship Pavilion would enhance the
skating opportunities and programs in the
Stanford community. He said the new
rinks might even foster speed or figure
skating clubs here.
Wright sees the Hockey Club expanding
as a result of more ice time minus the
hassle of carpooling to Belmont. "We
could teach more beginners how to play
hockey," he said.
"There might be some interest in start
ing a youth hockey program," Spear
noted. He also cited Friendship Pavilion as
a location for student group parties. Be
cause the site is a considerable distance
from residential areas, the rinks could stay
open on into the evening to accomodate
such gatherings.
Lee looks upon his proposal for Stanford
student use as "a winter recreation that is
out of doors, that is pleasant, family-ori
ented — where they can party without fear
of insecurity.
"There are doggone few things people
can do in the winter and this is some
thing," he continued. Lee indicated that
the exercise value of ice skating is
equivalent to bicycling.
But before Lee's dream can become re
ality, he said he must raise close to $2 mil
lion by Jan. 1 of next year, at which time
construction would begin.
"It (Friendship Pavilion) will be a real
benefit for Palo Alto," council member
Betsy Bechtel said. "The big question is

whether the backers can raise the money.
Two million dollars is an awful lot."
Lee said he thinks he can round-up the
necessary capital in the Palo Alto vicinity.
"We will try to raise the money from, say, a
10 mile radius. There are a lot of wealthy
people in this area who are willing to con
tribute.
"We are just beginning, but we have
several very good prospects. We're going
both ways (in fund-raising), both big and
small," he explained.
Wright said that Lee gave him "a bunch
of names" of potential donors in the Stan
ford area. "We get a pretty large say about
what goes on if we are able to raise money.
The more we raise, the more concessions
(Lee) will have to make," Wright said in
reference to the issue of ice time for cam
pus clubs.
According to Lee, there would be plenty
of ice time for Wright and company, espe
cially with two rinks. "I think they will have
as much access as they want," he com
mented.
If Lee is unable to acquire enough mon
ey to build both rinks, his first priority is to
construct the outdoor facility, he said. That
alone calls for approximately $1.5 million,
he said.
However, the addition of the indoor
rink would proportionately not cost much
more, as it could use the same refrig
eration equipment as its outdoor coun
terpart, Lee said.
"I hope that they will build both, but I'll
be satisfied with one," Spear said. If just
the outdoor rink is erected, hockey facil
ities will be placed on it.
Lee claims that no opposition to his pro
posal exists. "Stanford and Palo Alto have
always had a love/hate relationship. Here
is a case where there is no dispute at all,"
he said.

rink would proportionately not cost much
more, as it could use the same refrig
eration equipment as its outdoor coun
terpart, Lee said.
"I hope that they will build both, but I'll
be satisfied with one," Spear said. If just
the outdoor rink is erected, hockey facil
ities will be placed on it.
Lee claims that no opposition to his pro
posal exists. "Stanford and Palo Alto have
always had a love/hate relationship. Here
is a case where there is no dispute at all,"
he said.

HOME FOR HOCKEY — If a new ice rink is built in Palo Alto the Stanford Hockey Club
will not have to travel all the way to use this rink in Belmont.
Right now, the land occupies a three
acre plot rich in bayland mud and
weeds. It is vacant now, bordered by a driv
ing range, the 10th green of Palo Alto's
Municipal Golf Course, and Geng and Em
barcadero roads.
If Marvin Lee has his way, this land will
become a multi-million dollar ice skating
and hockey center by the fall of 1983. He
plans to replace Palo Alto's Winter Club,
which will close in April of that year. Lee, a
Palo Alto resident who heads a group
called Friends of the Winter Club, sees the
new center — to be called Friendship Pavil
ion — as serving not only Palo Alto, but
Stanford and surrounding communities as
well.
The owner of the Winter Club, Duncan
Williams, built the rink 25 years ago on
privately-owned land. It is the only out
door rink in the Western U.S.. According
to the terms of the lease, which expires in
April, 1983, it must be torn down.
Lee's proposal includes the construction
of one indoor and one outdoor rink. The
latter would feature a roof over the south
east half to protect the ice from sun and
rain. In the summer, the outdoor rink
could be used as a theater. Last month, the
Palo Alto City Council leased to the
Friends of the Winter Club the east
Bayshore Freeway (1-101) public land at a
nominal one dollar per year rent.
The indoor arena for year-round ice play
would have ice hockey facilities capable of
housing the Stanford Hockey Club. The
players presently call a rink in Belmont
home, as the Winter Club is too small to ac
comodate hockey.
Dave Wright, president of the Stanford
Hockey and Skating Club, is excited about
moving the program closer to the campus.

"It's a lot more convenient to play at a
home rink a few miles away than 15 miles
away," he said. "The rink we play at
doesn't even have showers."
Third year player David Spear, who en
visions the hockey team as "one of the bet
ter clubs in almost all of Northern Califor
nia besides pro teams," said he believes
Friendship Pavilion would enhance the
skating opportunities and programs in the
Stanford community. He said the new
rinks might even foster speed or figure
skating clubs here.
Wright sees the Hockey Club expanding
as a result of more ice time minus the
hassle of carpooling to Belmont. "We
could teach more beginners how to play
hockey," he said.
"There might be some interest in start
ing a youth hockey program," Spear
noted. He also cited Friendship Pavilion as
a location for student group parties. Be
cause the site is a considerable distance
from residential areas, the rinks could stay
open on into the evening to accomodate
such gatherings.
Lee looks upon his proposal for Stanford
student use as "a winter recreation that is
out of doors, that is pleasant, family-ori
ented — where they can party without fear
of insecurity.
"There are doggone few things people
can do in the winter and this is some
thing," he continued. Lee indicated that
the exercise value of ice skating is
equivalent to bicycling.
But before Lee's dream can become re
ality, he said he must raise close to $2 mil
lion by Jan. 1 of next year, at which time
construction would begin.
"It (Friendship Pavilion) will be a real
benefit for Palo Alto," council member
Betsy Bechtel said. "The big question is

whether the backers can raise the money.
Two million dollars is an awful lot."
Lee said he thinks he can round-up the
necessary capital in the Palo Alto vicinity.
"We will try to raise the money from, say, a
10 mile radius. There are a lot of wealthy
people in this area who are willing to con
tribute.
"We are just beginning, but we have
several very good prospects. We're going
both ways (in fund-raising), both big and
small," he explained.
Wright said that Lee gave him "a bunch
of names" of potential donors in the Stan
ford area. "We get a pretty large say about
what goes on if we are able to raise money.
The more we raise, the more concessions
(Lee) will have to make," Wright said in
reference to the issue of ice time for cam
pus clubs.
According to Lee, there would be plenty
of ice time for Wright and company, espe
cially with two rinks. "I think they will have
as much access as they want," he com
mented.
If Lee is unable to acquire enough mon
ey to build both rinks, his first priority is to
construct the outdoor facility, he said. That
alone calls for approximately $1.5 million,
he said.

rink would proportionately not cost much
more, as it could use the same refrig
eration equipment as its outdoor coun
terpart, Lee said.
