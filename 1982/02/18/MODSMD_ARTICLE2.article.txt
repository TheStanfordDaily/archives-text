# Proxmire calls for budget cuts

Comparing the seriousness of our current re
cession to that of the Great Depression, Senator
William Proxmire (D-Wis) last night called for fed
eral budget cuts and increased taxes as the key to
recovery.
"We don't know when the recession will end,"
Proxmire said before a crowd of about 200 in
Bishop Auditorium. The speech was sponsored by
the Stanford Committee on Political Education.
Proxmire challenged President Ronald Reagan's
prediction that the economy will recover by the
summer, saying, "Even if it does, it is unlikely to be
a permanent recovery."
Unlike the Depression, excess spending is the
problem not the solution to the current recession,
said Proxmire. He called for budget cuts in several
areas:
• Federal revenue sharing programs. "We can't
have revenue sharing if there isn't any revenue to
share," he said. Proxmire criticized the programs
because the states are not accountable for money
spent under such programs.
•Public works programs. Proxmire charged that
most public works programs are used to placate
voters at re-election time. "People always ask,

'what did you do for our district?' Public works is
the answer," he said. "We can cut it."
•Military foreign aid. "I'm absolutely opposed to
giving military aid to El Salvador," he said. Prox
mire also questioned whether aid should be given
to jordan, Israel and Egypt. "It makes absolutely no
sense for us to arm both sides," he said.
•High-technology defense spending. "We do
need a stronger military force," Proxmire said,
"but we're spending too much money on exotic
procurement." Proxmire attacked items like t'he
new Abrams tank, developed by Chrysler, priced
at about $3 million each.
"It breaks down every 31 miles," he said, "and it
gets four gallons per mile."
Cutting federal spending will cut budget defi
cits, which in turn will help bring down interests
rates, according to Proxmire. "We need more
spending the way a moose needs a hat rack," he
said.
High interest rates have been the central cause
of the current recession, because interest rates af
fect almost every aspect of the economy, the sena
tor said. "For example," he said, "there is no way
that a typical American family can buy a home be
cause of the high mortgage rates. We lost many

jobs in the housing industry because of this."
Proxmire said the Federal Reserve Board should
not be a scapegoat for the current high interest
rates. "The Federal Reserve Board is the only anti
inflation agency in town," he said.
Proxmire said blaming the Federal Reserve
Board only diverts attention from the real cause of
high interest rates. Excess government borrowing
is the real problem, he said.
Federal government borrowing cornered 35
percent of the credit market in 1981, and regarding
this, Proxmire warned, "Baby you ain't seen noth
ing yet." He expects the government to demand 60
percent of available credit next year, he said.
Besides budget cuts, Proxmire called for increas
ing government revenue by increasing taxes on
liquor and cigarrettes, continuing the windfall
profit tax on oil companies, and erasing about
$19,000 worth of tax benefits for congressmen.
Proxmire criticized many government pro
grams, particularly those programs which have re
ceived his Golden Fleece Award. He gives the
facetious award to government programs outstan
ding for their wastefulness. For example, one
agency "spent $20,000 trying to figure out why
prisoners want to escape from jail," he said.
