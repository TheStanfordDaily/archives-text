## Three movies long on emotion, quite short on plot Francis Coppola: Man overboard 
### 
One From The Heart
One from the Heart is a sterling example
of what can happen to a gifted director
who has lost track of what he is doing.
Francis Ford Coppola made this
enormous, expensive musical with great
care: the improvisatory acting is all of a
piece, and Vittorio Storaro's purplish fan
tasy lighting and the meticulousstudiosets
Dean Tavoularis designed might have
budded from the same imagination. But all
this movie has going for it is its eccentrici
ty; there isn't any substance, and it's not
much fun to sit through, either. It's an ag
gressively, vacantly idiosyncratic show
piece of a movie.
The story is so slight that it hardly func
tions at all. Hank (Fredric Forrest), co
owner of the Reality Wrecking Company,
I and Frannie (Teri Garr), a travel agent,
have reached a dry spot in their five-year
relationship, and each rebels by finding a
I; more exotic lover — playing out a fantasy
for a night before returning to repair their
damaged home. For Frannie, it is a waiter
pianist named Ray (Raul Julia), an embodi
ment of the Latin lovers in early movie mu
sicals like Georges Metaxa in Swing Time
who generally ended up as also-rans. (Ray
woos Frannie with a recording of 'The
Carioca' from Flying Down to Rio, in which
the Latin lover, played by Raul Roulien,
lost Dolores Del Rio to Gene Raymond.)
Hank has a fling with Leila (Nastassia
Kinski), a circus girl with the gamine quali
ty of Leslie Caron in An American in Paris
or Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face. The set
ting for these romantic entanglements is a
Las Vegas erected entirely on the
soundstages of Coppola's Zoetrope Studi
os.
Coppola is certainly not the first director
to attempt to create something new and
unconventional out of old movie musicals.
Martin Scorsese's New York, New York

evoked the happy-go-lucky sailor-on
leave pictures M-G-M put out in the late
forties — like Anchors Aweigh and On the
Town — in order to investigate the dis
crepancy between the romantic distortion
of the pop culture of that era and the har
rowing 'real' lives of the characters. In Pen
nies from Heaven, elaborate reworkings of
1930's production numbers serve simulta
neously as Brechtian interludes and emo
tional releases for Depression-caught men
and women. In each case, nostalgia is
transformed into art by being placed at the
service of a strong theme.
One from the Heart is full of clever gim
micks — neon reflections appear and van
ish magically in shop windows, paired
scenes are played back to back on the
same set, department stores and beauty
salons suggest the world of The Wizard of
Oz — but if there is a single idea in the
movie, it eluded me. The numbers don't
tell us anything about Frannie and Hank,
or about the quality of their lives, or about
why such people or all people need a little
illusion. And the soundtrack — a collec
tion of jazzy ballads by Tom Waits, sung by
Waits and Crystal Gayle — just describes
what we can see for ourselves: that the
characters are bored or frustrated or lone
ly. (One or two of the songs have the dis
solute poignancy one associates with
Waits' best music, but most of them are un
characteristically maudlin, and they tend
to blur into each other after a while.)
The insignificance of the sort-of dream
sequences isn't their only distressing quali
ty; they're also cluttered, poorly staged
(one longs forthe controlled movement of
the crowd in the V-J Day sequence in New
York, New York or Steven Spielberg's
choreography of the brawl-dance number
in 1941) and compulsively kitschy. Cop
pola pays homage to movie musicals no
one cares about — there's a tropical set out
of Yolanda and the Thief or the bad parts of
Ziegfeld Girl or You Were Never Lovelier,
and Nastassia Kinski does an interpretive
dance on a tower that drove to the surface
the Harriet Hoctor numbers from The
Great Ziegfeld and Shall We Dance that I
thought I'd successfully repressed. Some
one will probably write an appreciation of
this movie in Film Comment that will ap

plaud Coppola for such erudition, but why
on earth would he want to make a musical
in this way?
One from the Heart leaves several other
questions unanswered, too. Coppola and
Armyan Bernstein receive screen credit for
the script, but all the dialogue is im
provised — a baffling choice in a movie
that transpires on such a bland emotional
level. Improvisation is a tricky experiment
in movies; in the two instances I can re
member in which it has worked most
brilliantly — Last Tango in Paris and Nash
ville — the context was rich and the situ
ations dense with emotional possibility.
The scenes between Frederic Forrest and
Teri Garr seem interminable, because
nothing happens in them. Theirexchanges
are dead air — you keep wishing Robert
Getchell or W.D. Richter would run in and
hand the actors some new, sharp dialogue.
The acting is mostly very dull — though
Harry Dean Stanton and Lainie Kazan, in
supporting roles, manage to be lively, and
Allen Goorwitz has a funny cameo as a res
taurant owner — but it's not the per
formers' fault. Forrest in particular might
have given an interesting performance if
the part had been really written; he has
adapted his voice to sound a lot like Tom
Waits' — gin-soaked and haunted — and
he has a strong physical presence and a
great deal of integrity. (He was terrific as
Bette Midler's vet lover in The Rose.)
Throughout the movie, we hear the
sounds of fireworks sizzling and sputter
ing, corks popping, coins spinning —
amplified so much that they become dis
torted. Again, I don't understand why.
Coppola seems to be unable to make mov
ies on a small scale, but One from the
Heart doesn't deserve to be huge — even
more than Apocalypse Now, it's a movie
about making films on an enormous scale
without guiding principles. Apocalypse
Now was a movie that fell apart as we
watched; One from the Heart is clearly-a
shambles from the moment it begins. I
think Coppola is the most talented direc
tor in America, but his pictures have de
veloped a megalomaniacal quality that is at
once depressing and self-defeating. One
from the Heart brings us to the point at
which vision and style don't even intersect.

One From The Heart
One from the Heart is a sterling example
of what can happen to a gifted director
who has lost track of what he is doing.
Francis Ford Coppola made this
enormous, expensive musical with great
care: the improvisatory acting is all of a
piece, and Vittorio Storaro's purplish fan
tasy lighting and the meticulousstudiosets
Dean Tavoularis designed might have
budded from the same imagination. But all
this movie has going for it is its eccentrici
ty; there isn't any substance, and it's not
much fun to sit through, either. It's an ag
gressively, vacantly idiosyncratic show
piece of a movie.
The story is so slight that it hardly func
tions at all. Hank (Fredric Forrest), co
owner of the Reality Wrecking Company,
I and Frannie (Teri Garr), a travel agent,
have reached a dry spot in their five-year
relationship, and each rebels by finding a
I; more exotic lover — playing out a fantasy
for a night before returning to repair their
damaged home. For Frannie, it is a waiter
pianist named Ray (Raul Julia), an embodi
ment of the Latin lovers in early movie mu
sicals like Georges Metaxa in Swing Time
who generally ended up as also-rans. (Ray
woos Frannie with a recording of 'The
Carioca' from Flying Down to Rio, in which
the Latin lover, played by Raul Roulien,
lost Dolores Del Rio to Gene Raymond.)
Hank has a fling with Leila (Nastassia
Kinski), a circus girl with the gamine quali
ty of Leslie Caron in An American in Paris
or Audrey Hepburn in Funny Face. The set
ting for these romantic entanglements is a
Las Vegas erected entirely on the
soundstages of Coppola's Zoetrope Studi
os.
Coppola is certainly not the first director
to attempt to create something new and
unconventional out of old movie musicals.
Martin Scorsese's New York, New York

evoked the happy-go-lucky sailor-on
leave pictures M-G-M put out in the late
forties — like Anchors Aweigh and On the
Town — in order to investigate the dis
crepancy between the romantic distortion
of the pop culture of that era and the har
rowing 'real' lives of the characters. In Pen
nies from Heaven, elaborate reworkings of
1930's production numbers serve simulta
neously as Brechtian interludes and emo
tional releases for Depression-caught men
and women. In each case, nostalgia is
transformed into art by being placed at the
service of a strong theme.
One from the Heart is full of clever gim
micks — neon reflections appear and van
ish magically in shop windows, paired
scenes are played back to back on the
same set, department stores and beauty
salons suggest the world of The Wizard of
Oz — but if there is a single idea in the
movie, it eluded me. The numbers don't
tell us anything about Frannie and Hank,
or about the quality of their lives, or about
why such people or all people need a little
illusion. And the soundtrack — a collec
tion of jazzy ballads by Tom Waits, sung by
Waits and Crystal Gayle — just describes
what we can see for ourselves: that the
characters are bored or frustrated or lone
ly. (One or two of the songs have the dis
solute poignancy one associates with
Waits' best music, but most of them are un
characteristically maudlin, and they tend
to blur into each other after a while.)
The insignificance of the sort-of dream
sequences isn't their only distressing quali
ty; they're also cluttered, poorly staged
(one longs forthe controlled movement of
the crowd in the V-J Day sequence in New
York, New York or Steven Spielberg's
choreography of the brawl-dance number
in 1941) and compulsively kitschy. Cop
pola pays homage to movie musicals no
one cares about — there's a tropical set out
of Yolanda and the Thief or the bad parts of
Ziegfeld Girl or You Were Never Lovelier,
and Nastassia Kinski does an interpretive
dance on a tower that drove to the surface
the Harriet Hoctor numbers from The
Great Ziegfeld and Shall We Dance that I
thought I'd successfully repressed. Some
one will probably write an appreciation of
this movie in Film Comment that will ap

plaud Coppola for such erudition, but why
on earth would he want to make a musical
in this way?
One from the Heart leaves several other
questions unanswered, too. Coppola and
Armyan Bernstein receive screen credit for
the script, but all the dialogue is im
provised — a baffling choice in a movie
that transpires on such a bland emotional
level. Improvisation is a tricky experiment
in movies; in the two instances I can re
member in which it has worked most
brilliantly — Last Tango in Paris and Nash
ville — the context was rich and the situ
ations dense with emotional possibility.
The scenes between Frederic Forrest and
Teri Garr seem interminable, because
nothing happens in them. Theirexchanges
are dead air — you keep wishing Robert
Getchell or W.D. Richter would run in and
hand the actors some new, sharp dialogue.
The acting is mostly very dull — though
Harry Dean Stanton and Lainie Kazan, in
supporting roles, manage to be lively, and
Allen Goorwitz has a funny cameo as a res
taurant owner — but it's not the per
formers' fault. Forrest in particular might
have given an interesting performance if
the part had been really written; he has
adapted his voice to sound a lot like Tom
Waits' — gin-soaked and haunted — and
he has a strong physical presence and a
great deal of integrity. (He was terrific as
Bette Midler's vet lover in The Rose.)
Throughout the movie, we hear the
sounds of fireworks sizzling and sputter
ing, corks popping, coins spinning —
amplified so much that they become dis
torted. Again, I don't understand why.
