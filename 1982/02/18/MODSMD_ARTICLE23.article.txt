Missing
Missing takes place in
Chile during the coup in
1973 that overthrew Al
lende's Marxist government
and established a military
junta, but it seems to be set
in hell. Anyone who walks
the streets after curfew is in
peril of being shot; people
are abducted from their
homes and from crowded
restaurants and bus stops by
soldiers; passersby slip on
congealed blood at street
corners. Costa-Gavras, the
director, gives a stunning
demonstration of what it is
like to be in a country in a
state of siege, and the pho
tographer, Ricardo
Aronovich, and the produc
tion designer, Dean
Tavoularis, have gone to
muted golds and dense reds
— the hotels where Ameri
can military types gatherare
like baroque palaces, where
one expects Poe's Red
Death to appear at any mo
ment.
Missing is a political
melodrama, like Costa-
Gavras' Z and State of Siege,
with an open leftist bias, and
perhaps its accusations of
American collaboration in
the coup won't be as popu
lar with Reagan-era au
diences as they would have
been in the late years of the
Nixon administration, when
the action of the film oc
curs; but really, Costa-
Gavras can no more be
censured for depicting the
American Embassy people
as duplicitous, officious vil
lains than he could be for
caricaturing the govern
ment bigwigs in his earlier
pictures; he always plays by

the same rules. Costa-
Gavras is not usually a deep
political thinker — the script
he and Donald Stewart
cooked up out of Thomas
Hauser's book is rather
simple-minded — but he
can be a very exciting direc
tor, and some of the se
quences in Missing, which is
the true story of a search for
an American, Charlie
Horman (John Shea), who
was arrested in Chile in the
first days of the take-over,
are unbearably tense. (Cos
ta-Gavras' one really
thoughtful movie was the
1970 The Confession, in
which Yves Montand played
a Communist during the
Czech purges of the early
fifties.)
In this movie he shows a
feeling for visual poetry that
indicates Bertolucci's in
fluence: there's a
Goyaesque scene in a
morgue, in which corpses
choke every corner of the
room and can be seen,
silhouetted, above the sky
light, and another in police
headquarters with long,
tubular corridors leading to
cave-like arches — some
thing De Chirico might have
designed for a Kafka story.
There is a second plot in
Missing, too — the politic
ization of Harmon's father
Ed (Jack Lemmon), who
comes to Chile to help his
daughter-in-law Beth (Sissy
Spacek) to find Charlie —
and it nearly wrecks the
movie. The problem is not
just Lemmon's awful acting
(his line readings are so but
tery that they sound like an
actor's vocal warm-ups) but
the fact that Costa-Gavras

and Donald Stewart have
cut this story out of the cloth
of I%o's generation-gap
cliches. Ed is a conservative
Christian Scientist who is
puzzled and annoyed at
Charlie and Beth's politics
and at their lifestyle; be
cause Charlie has opted to
write and animate chil
dren's stories in Latin Amer
ica rather than seeking a
conventional source of fi
nancial security at home, Ed
characterizes him as lazy
and shiftless. He spouts the
sort of over-forty drivel I
haven't heard in a movie
since I was an under
graduate in the early seven
ties — 'I don't want to hear
any of your anti-estab
lishment paranoia,' etc. —
until, inevitably, he comes
around to accepting Beth's
point of view about the dis
honesty of the American
government officials in
Chile and to recognizing
the validity of his son's
choices. (There was a mo
ment, in the meant-to-be
touching scene in which
Beth tried to convert Ed to
the precious 'truthfulness'
of Saint-Exupery's The Little
Prince, when I was on Ed's
side.) Even Sissy Spacek, giv
ing her best performance in
years (since Carrie and
Three Women), can't save
this material, and I'm sur
prised that Costa-Gavras
didn't see how sentimental
it was. But for the rest of the
way he's working in high
gear; at its best, Missing is a
model of how a director can
express the mood of a high
ly charged political situation
so powerfully that an au
dience can almost taste it.

Missing, too — the politic
ization of Harmon's father
Ed (Jack Lemmon), who
comes to Chile to help his
daughter-in-law Beth (Sissy
Spacek) to find Charlie —
and it nearly wrecks the
movie. The problem is not
just Lemmon's awful acting
(his line readings are so but
tery that they sound like an
actor's vocal warm-ups) but
the fact that Costa-Gavras

and Donald Stewart have
cut this story out of the cloth
of I%o's generation-gap
cliches. Ed is a conservative
Christian Scientist who is
puzzled and annoyed at
Charlie and Beth's politics
and at their lifestyle; be
cause Charlie has opted to
write and animate chil
dren's stories in Latin Amer
ica rather than seeking a
conventional source of fi
nancial security at home, Ed
characterizes him as lazy
and shiftless. He spouts the
sort of over-forty drivel I
haven't heard in a movie
since I was an under
graduate in the early seven
ties — 'I don't want to hear
any of your anti-estab
lishment paranoia,' etc. —
until, inevitably, he comes
around to accepting Beth's
point of view about the dis
honesty of the American
government officials in
Chile and to recognizing
the validity of his son's
choices. (There was a mo
ment, in the meant-to-be
touching scene in which
Beth tried to convert Ed to
the precious 'truthfulness'
of Saint-Exupery's The Little
Prince, when I was on Ed's
side.) Even Sissy Spacek, giv
ing her best performance in
years (since Carrie and
Three Women), can't save
this material, and I'm sur
prised that Costa-Gavras
didn't see how sentimental
it was. But for the rest of the
way he's working in high
gear; at its best, Missing is a
model of how a director can
express the mood of a high
ly charged political situation
so powerfully that an au
dience can almost taste it.
Missing
Missing takes place in
Chile during the coup in
1973 that overthrew Al
lende's Marxist government
and established a military
junta, but it seems to be set
in hell. Anyone who walks
the streets after curfew is in
peril of being shot; people
are abducted from their
homes and from crowded
restaurants and bus stops by
soldiers; passersby slip on
congealed blood at street
corners. Costa-Gavras, the
director, gives a stunning
demonstration of what it is
like to be in a country in a
state of siege, and the pho
tographer, Ricardo
Aronovich, and the produc
tion designer, Dean
Tavoularis, have gone to
muted golds and dense reds
— the hotels where Ameri
can military types gatherare
like baroque palaces, where
one expects Poe's Red
Death to appear at any mo
ment.
Missing is a political
melodrama, like Costa-
Gavras' Z and State of Siege,
with an open leftist bias, and
perhaps its accusations of
American collaboration in
the coup won't be as popu
lar with Reagan-era au
diences as they would have
been in the late years of the
Nixon administration, when
the action of the film oc
curs; but really, Costa-
Gavras can no more be
censured for depicting the
American Embassy people
as duplicitous, officious vil
lains than he could be for
caricaturing the govern
ment bigwigs in his earlier
pictures; he always plays by

the same rules. Costa-
Gavras is not usually a deep
political thinker — the script
he and Donald Stewart
cooked up out of Thomas
Hauser's book is rather
simple-minded — but he
can be a very exciting direc
tor, and some of the se
quences in Missing, which is
the true story of a search for
an American, Charlie
Horman (John Shea), who
was arrested in Chile in the
first days of the take-over,
are unbearably tense. (Cos
ta-Gavras' one really
thoughtful movie was the
1970 The Confession, in
which Yves Montand played
a Communist during the
Czech purges of the early
fifties.)
In this movie he shows a
feeling for visual poetry that
indicates Bertolucci's in
fluence: there's a
Goyaesque scene in a
morgue, in which corpses
choke every corner of the
room and can be seen,
silhouetted, above the sky
light, and another in police
headquarters with long,
tubular corridors leading to
cave-like arches — some
thing De Chirico might have
designed for a Kafka story.
There is a second plot in
Missing, too — the politic
ization of Harmon's father
Ed (Jack Lemmon), who
comes to Chile to help his
daughter-in-law Beth (Sissy
Spacek) to find Charlie —
and it nearly wrecks the
