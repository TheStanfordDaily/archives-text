Making Love
Making Love reminded me of how good
Sunday, Bloody Sunday was. In John
Schlesinger's 1971 film, which had a prodi
gious script by Penelope Gilliatt, Murray
Head played a young man having simulta
neous affairs with a middle-aged doctor
(Peter Finch) and a recent divorcee (Glen
da Jackson). In Making Love, written by
Barry Sandler out of a story by Scott Berg,
Michael Ontkean plays a doctor who dis
covers, after eight years of marriage to an
equally successful TV executive (Kate Jack
son), that he is homosexual, when he
sleeps with a novelist (Harry Hamlin). Sun
day, Bloody Sunday was a beautifully acted

drama that articulated the ambiguity of
emotional relationships; Making Love is a'
problem' picture with all the complexity of
a TV movie on a 'serious' theme.
Neither Kate Jackson, who plays nothing
but subtext, nor Harry Hamlin, who is pat
ently artificial, is enough of a performer to
bring this film off. As for Michael Ontkean,
he isn't a bad actor, just a wimpy one — the
kind of actor who looks so sweet and
earnest that he can get by with just throw
ing the occasional soulful glance at the
camera. Between this movie and Willie
and Phil, he must have already given more
soulful glances than most actors get to use
in their entire career.

Making Love is so sudsy — and so dread
fully put together (there's a scene between
Jackson and a gay stud whose number she
finds on a box of matches that contradicts
the rest of the narrative) — that I'm sur
prised anyone would take it seriously,
Making Love publicizes itself as a
crusade so that no one can object to it as a
movie — it's the old Stanley Kramer ploy,
asking us to judge a rotten film on its good
liberal intentions. In fact, Making Love is as
offensive in its way as Cruising, because it
presents such a sanitized picture of the gay
world that it insults its audience. Making
Love is to homosexuals what Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner was to blacks.
