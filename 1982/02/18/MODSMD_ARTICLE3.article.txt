# 'Experiment' is making Row houses cool
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
If residents of Delta Kappa Epsilon
(DKE), Delta Upsilon (DU) and Beta
Theta Pi (Beta) fraternity houses felt a
little chilly last night, it was probably
for good reason — their heat has
been turned off.
On Tuesday, the Row and Cluster
Facilities Office temporarily turned
off the heat in the three houses in an
effort to save energy and money.
Each house received a notice Tues
day which read, "After observing
your houses for two weeks and not
ing that the windows and/or doors
are remaining open for a greater part
of the day (sometimes even night!),
I'm temporarily turning the heat
down to the pilot to experiment."
The note was from Heloisa Ed
wards, manager of the Row and
Cluster Facilities Office, who ex
plained that she is trying to combat
the $2 million increase in energy

costs Stanford is facing.
Edwards said the three fraternity
houses were chosen because they
have been seen by herself, custo
dians and students, to have the most
doors and windows open all day.
"They get all of the afternoon sun
and that heats the houses. So most of
the windows are open," she said.
Doubting that they need the cur
rent amount of heat supplied, three
other Row houses, Synergy, Lambda
Nu and the French House, have
asked to have their heat turned
down, said Edwards. A letter to all
other Row houses suggesting a re
duction of the supply of heat in the
houses will be sent Friday, Edwards
said. The letter requests a response
from the houses by the following Fri
day.
The three houses affected can no
longer regulate their heat by setting
their thermostats. Edwards said the
heat is at the pilot level, which is

about 68 degrees. "If they are cold, of
course we will turn the heat up," she
said.
Edwards added, "I'm trying to get
the group (each house) to reach a de
cision. I'm looking for a consensus
from the house. If they are cold they
should let me know."
DU House Manager Doug Sunde
did just that. He called Edwards yes
terday and asked her to turn the DU's
heat back on.
"We were surprised that of all the
houses on the Row, the three
fraternities were turned down and
were especially surprised because
our energy (use) has been going
down. We've been down every
month from last year," he said.
Harry Freeman, treasurer and
energy representative of the Betas,
said, "I don't understand why they're
turning our heat down," but added,
"It's not really bothering anyone in

the house."
At the DKE house yesterday morn
ing "a number of people were com
plaining," "but nobody was up in
arms," according to House Manager
Howard Sewell.
A common problem, noted by
both Edwards and the house man
agers, is that the houses are old and
the heating systems do not heat the
houses evenly.
Sunde said, "We have a problem
with the whole heating system. But I
think we've been real conscientious
about watching how much energy
we're using."
Freeman expressed the same con
cern. "All of the thermostats are on
the ground floor and they don't con
trol the heaters very well. The top
floors get hot but the thermostat still
says 65 degrees. There's not really
much we can do except open the

windows/' he said.
Sewell said turning down the heat
was not a big problem. "My only
criticism is that she (Edwards) could
have given us some warning and told
us to close our windows before just
turning off the heat, he said.
Natural gas consumption in most
Row houses this January is up from
January 1981, according to John
Eaton, manager of the Housing
Energy Conservation Center, who
added that the increase can be at
tributed to a colder winter this year.
From September through the pres
ent, natural gas consumption in most
houses is down, he said.
Edwards explained that "the
houses that have guys are usually
more flexible" about having the heat
turned off. She said Roth is usually
the last Row house to have its heat
turned off.

Harry Freeman, treasurer and
energy representative of the Betas,
said, "I don't understand why they're
turning our heat down," but added,
"It's not really bothering anyone in

the house."
At the DKE house yesterday morn
ing "a number of people were com
plaining," "but nobody was up in
arms," according to House Manager
Howard Sewell.
A common problem, noted by
both Edwards and the house man
agers, is that the houses are old and
the heating systems do not heat the
houses evenly.
Sunde said, "We have a problem
with the whole heating system. But I
think we've been real conscientious
about watching how much energy
we're using."
Freeman expressed the same con
cern. "All of the thermostats are on
the ground floor and they don't con
trol the heaters very well. The top
floors get hot but the thermostat still
says 65 degrees. There's not really
much we can do except open the

windows/' he said.
Sewell said turning down the heat
was not a big problem. "My only
criticism is that she (Edwards) could
have given us some warning and told
us to close our windows before just
turning off the heat, he said.
Natural gas consumption in most
Row houses this January is up from
January 1981, according to John
Eaton, manager of the Housing
Energy Conservation Center, who
added that the increase can be at
tributed to a colder winter this year.
From September through the pres
ent, natural gas consumption in most
houses is down, he said.
Edwards explained that "the
houses that have guys are usually
more flexible" about having the heat
turned off. She said Roth is usually
the last Row house to have its heat
turned off.
If residents of Delta Kappa Epsilon
(DKE), Delta Upsilon (DU) and Beta
Theta Pi (Beta) fraternity houses felt a
little chilly last night, it was probably
for good reason — their heat has
been turned off.
On Tuesday, the Row and Cluster
Facilities Office temporarily turned
off the heat in the three houses in an
effort to save energy and money.
Each house received a notice Tues
day which read, "After observing
your houses for two weeks and not
ing that the windows and/or doors
are remaining open for a greater part
of the day (sometimes even night!),
I'm temporarily turning the heat
down to the pilot to experiment."
The note was from Heloisa Ed
wards, manager of the Row and
Cluster Facilities Office, who ex
plained that she is trying to combat
the $2 million increase in energy

costs Stanford is facing.
Edwards said the three fraternity
houses were chosen because they
have been seen by herself, custo
dians and students, to have the most
doors and windows open all day.
"They get all of the afternoon sun
and that heats the houses. So most of
the windows are open," she said.
Doubting that they need the cur
rent amount of heat supplied, three
other Row houses, Synergy, Lambda
Nu and the French House, have
asked to have their heat turned
down, said Edwards. A letter to all
other Row houses suggesting a re
duction of the supply of heat in the
houses will be sent Friday, Edwards
said. The letter requests a response
from the houses by the following Fri
day.
The three houses affected can no
longer regulate their heat by setting
their thermostats. Edwards said the
heat is at the pilot level, which is

about 68 degrees. "If they are cold, of
course we will turn the heat up," she
said.
Edwards added, "I'm trying to get
the group (each house) to reach a de
cision. I'm looking for a consensus
from the house. If they are cold they
should let me know."
DU House Manager Doug Sunde
did just that. He called Edwards yes
terday and asked her to turn the DU's
heat back on.
"We were surprised that of all the
houses on the Row, the three
fraternities were turned down and
were especially surprised because
our energy (use) has been going
down. We've been down every
month from last year," he said.
