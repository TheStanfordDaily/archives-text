# Ski club looks for practice and fun

So maybe you aren't the
world's next Ingemar Sten
mark. You don't get up every
morning and let Phil Mahre's
World Cup standings dominate
your breakfast conversation.
And you might even spend
most of your weekends —
Heaven forbid — in your dorm
studying for next week's
midterms.
However, even with all these
shortcomings, you still like to
ski. What do vou do?
The Stanford ski club may be
just the answer. The club is run
by co-presidents Tom Denlea
and Wayne Cooper. Member
ship dues are $10 a year, and
skiers of any ability can join
anytime during the year.
Every year the club usually
has two big trips. During
Thanksgiving break they take a
bus trip to Utah while during
spring break they take their
"big trip", which is usually by
plane and costs a little bit more.
These trips vary from places
like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to
Sun Valley, Idaho.
Besides the two main trips,
members enjoy other benefits.
They get a membership card
which entitles them to 50 per
cent off on rental goods at Os
hman's Sporting Goods and re
ceive 10-15 percent off on
purchased equipment. In addi
tion, members sometimes or
ganize informal weekend trips.
However, club co-president
Denlea thinks that one of the
best things the club has to offer
is a chance to meet fellow Stan
ford students of all skiing abili

ties.
"One of the biggest benefits
of the ski club," Denlea said,
"is meeting fellow students
who like to ski."
The ski club books all of its
trips through Sports America
Tours, which alsoarrangestrips
for other schools. Often UC
Berkeley, UCLA, the University
of Washington, and other
western schools are on the
trips.
Trips usually include parties,
dances, and sometimes even
races with the other schools.
"Besides the great skiing, the
parties are great," Denlea ex
plained. "You also get a chance
to meet a lot of new people."
This year during spring
break, the club is going to
Whistler Mountain in Canada.
"I've never been there
before," Denlea admits, "but
I've heard that they have some
of the best powder in the
world. We always like to try
someplace new, and this year
we decided on Whistler."
A few years ago Twentieth
Century Fox, which owns
Aspen, bought Whistler Mou
ntain. Their plans are to de
velope Whistler and to make it
a world class ski resort.
Already, with the opening of
Blackcomb Mountain, and the
village at the base of the lifts,
Whistler's development is
coming along fast.
Denlea said that there is still
room left on this spring's trip,
and encourages interested stu
dents to look for one of the
many fliers which they've dis
tributed on campus.
