# Resorts: rating the slopes
## 
### Adam Berns 
Every year people come out
with ratings. Some people rate
restaurants, others movies, and
still others consumer products.
Well it's about time someone
published a guide to ski resorts
— not just how the skiing is, but
what the resorts are really like.
Unfortunately, due to time,
money, academic, and other
constraints, it was impossible to
visit and rate every resort in the

United States. However, the re
views which follow should give
the most avid skier — and
partier — the inside knowl
edge of where to ski.
Sun Valley — What more can
anyone say about the grand
daddy of ski resorts? Everybody
remembers the old movie It
Happened In Sun Valley star
ring Milton Berle and Sonja
Henie. Well, maybe it was a lit
tle before your time. But the
fact remains, Sun Valley has
probably seen more of the
movie star crowd than any oth
er resort in the United States.
Probably more than any oth
er resort, Sun Valley mixes the
charm and grace of a true re
sort with good skiing.
Because there is not much of
a weekend crowd, almost ev
erybody skiing there is either a
local, or is staying in Sun Valley
or Elkhorn Village. Conse
quently, not only is the average
skier better than most of the
Lake Tahoe crowd, but the lift
lines are much shorter.
The skiing at Sun Valley is ex
cellent. There are runs for all
abilities. Dollar Mountain pro
vides skiing for the beginning
skier while Mount Baldy has
runs which will challenge even
the most advanced skiers.
In short, Sun Valley com
bines the best in skiing and
apres-ski. Overall rating — ex
cellent.
Vail — Probably the best
mountain, highest prices, and
longest lift lines you'll find any
where. You might even see
Gerald Ford, but stay away for
your own safety. He's not
known for his coordination.
Vail is a great resort for both
skiing and apres-ski. The town

of Vail and its sister city
Lionshead, are both exciting
places. One thing you'll see a
lot of is wealthy people. Ev
eryone comes in the latest ski
fashions — especially the many
South Americans who ski there
— and people there definitely
show their wealth.
The skiing itself is excellent.
There is a wide choice of runs
and the snow is superb. Un
fortunately the amount of
skiing one does is limited by
the long lines. Overall Rating
— excellent.
Northstar — If your a be
ginner or low-intermediate,
Northstar is a great place. How
ever, if you have any skiing abil
ity at all, you'll get bored ter
ribly fast. Located in the North
shore of Lake Tahoe, Northstar
is for beginners only. Overall
Rating — fair.
Squaw Valley — In the
Sierras, no place can top Squaw
Valley, especially for advanced
to expert skiing. Originally
built for the Olympics in 1960,
Squaw Valley has the slopes,
but not the surrounding ac
commodations to rank it as a
world class resort. Overall rat
ing — very good.
Heavenly Valley — Like
Squaw Valley, one of the better
ski areas in the Sierras, but it
lacks the resort atmosphere of
many areas in the Rockies.
Prices are high, but there is a
wide variety of runs — and you
are close to the casinos. Overall
rating — good.
Park City — Located in Utah,
Park City is a great family re
sort, but the apres-ski is quite
limited. Come on, how much
fun can anyone have in Utah?
Overall rating — good.

bines the best in skiing and
apres-ski. Overall rating — ex
cellent.
Vail — Probably the best
mountain, highest prices, and
longest lift lines you'll find any
where. You might even see
Gerald Ford, but stay away for
your own safety. He's not
known for his coordination.
Vail is a great resort for both
skiing and apres-ski. The town

of Vail and its sister city
Lionshead, are both exciting
places. One thing you'll see a
lot of is wealthy people. Ev
eryone comes in the latest ski
fashions — especially the many
South Americans who ski there
— and people there definitely
show their wealth.
The skiing itself is excellent.
There is a wide choice of runs
and the snow is superb. Un
fortunately the amount of
skiing one does is limited by
the long lines. Overall Rating
— excellent.
Northstar — If your a be
ginner or low-intermediate,
Northstar is a great place. How
ever, if you have any skiing abil
ity at all, you'll get bored ter
ribly fast. Located in the North
shore of Lake Tahoe, Northstar
is for beginners only. Overall
Rating — fair.
Squaw Valley — In the
Sierras, no place can top Squaw
Valley, especially for advanced
to expert skiing. Originally
built for the Olympics in 1960,
Squaw Valley has the slopes,
but not the surrounding ac
commodations to rank it as a
world class resort. Overall rat
ing — very good.
Heavenly Valley — Like
Squaw Valley, one of the better
ski areas in the Sierras, but it
lacks the resort atmosphere of
many areas in the Rockies.
Prices are high, but there is a
wide variety of runs — and you
are close to the casinos. Overall
rating — good.
Park City — Located in Utah,
Park City is a great family re
sort, but the apres-ski is quite
limited. Come on, how much
fun can anyone have in Utah?
Overall rating — good.
