# Sailing club raises anchor at Farm
## 
### Katherine Hutt 
While most of America sat in
front of their television sets to
watch the Superbowl last
month, thirteen members of
the Stanford sailing team set
out on a 15-mile race. The
breeze was light, the tem
perature hovered around 70
degrees, and the sunlight
sparkled off the boats moored
in the Longbeach Yacht Club
harbor. Even better, the
pressure to perform was off,
because the results of this re
gatta wouldn't effect the
team's rankings one way or an
other.
A typical weekend for the
sailing team? Not really. For
one thing, they didn't finish
well in the races, which is un
usual. The men's team is cur
rently ranked sixth and the
women's team is in the top
eight in the country. What's
more, both teams are the best
on the West Coast.

"I feel like we have a halo
over our heads right now — ev
erything's just falling our way,"
co-captain Paul Yost comments
about the team.
Stanford's under-par per
formance in the International
Press Telegram Regatta last
month was mainly due to their
lack of experience on big boats
— those over 25 feet — accord
ing to Yost.
Another unusual aspect of
the Longbeach regatta was the
absence of the women's team.
According to coach Joe Petruc
ci, the men's and women's
teams are "a combined effort."
This weekend, however, the
women stayed behind to do
the basketball clean-up, a
chore that all team members
are required to perform several
times during the year.
There are around 30 active
members of the men's and
women's sailing teams this

quarter. Fall quarter there were
50 members, but a combina
tion of students going overseas
and taking on more units for
winter quarter claimed almost
half of them.
The team sails all year. Their
season runs from Sept. 1 until
mid-June. They practice all
three academic quarters with
regattas on most weekends.
Petrucci says that he strongly
encourages team spirit, which
he defines as "pulling one's
own weight." This means
showing up for practice, meet
ings, and clean-ups.
His strategy seems to work.
"I feel like we really have a
close, loving family," com
ments Yost.
In spite of their high rank
ings, Stanford sailing is not a
varsity team, but a club sport.
In fact, according to Petrucci,
they are the only non-varsity
team in the country ranked in

the top twenty. Their status,
Petrucci says, is a matter of
money. Once the team be
comes financially independ
ent, the University will allow
them to become a varsity sport.
The team seems well on the
way towards becoming finan
cially independent. The com
bined efforts of its members
yearly raise more than ten
times the amount allocated
them byClubSports. Theirfun
draising activities consist of the
mandatory basketball clean
ups, and solicitation of parents,
alumni, and friends of the
team.
The team's efforts are
crucial, Petrucci says. The mon
ey that they raise from the
basketball clean-ups is used for
sending the team to regattas in
California, and the donations
they receive pay for the ex
penses they incur traveling to
regattas out of state. Yost esti

mates that Stanford sailing
spends more on travel than any
other team in the country, be
cause they have to fly East so
often.
In addition to covering the
team's travel expenses, the
donations helped pay for their
fleet, which Petrucci estimates
at a total value of $60,000 to
$70,000. None of the Univer
sity's money was put towards
acquiring these boats, which
Petrucci says form the largest
dinghy racing fleet on the West
Coast.
The most important result of
the team members' efforts is
the Stanford sailing program.
Petrucci said that this organiza
tion has three parts: com
petitive (the team), instruc
tional, and recreational.
The instructional aspect,
which conducts the sailing and
windsurfing classes offered at
the University, had more than
600 participants last year, 500 of
them during Spring quarter.
The recreational part of the
program, which consists of
members of the sailing associa
tion, also involved 600 people
last year, and Petrucci predicts
will draw even more this year.
With all its participants, the
Stanford sailing program has
only one paid staffer. — Joe
Petrucci. It thus depends very
heavily on the volunteer work
done by the sailing team.
Petrucci estimates that it is the
Stanford's largest volunteer or
ganization. The team members
assist both by being teaching
assistants for the sailing classes,
and by their fundraising ac
tivities.
More than anything else, the
reason for the sailing pro
gram's success is coach Petruc
ci. "He has a tremendous
amount of enthusiasm," Yost
said. "He has the ability to
motivate people to work for
the program, and even more,
he's a dreamer."
Petrucci has ambitious goals
for the future of his program.
One example is his plan for a
sailingseminar which will bring
in outside experts, to be held
May 8 at the San Francisco
Yacht Club. One well-known
sailor who Petrucci hopes will
come is Ted Turner, the Atlanta
entrepreneur who won the
America's Cup.
Petrucci's most ambitious
project by far is his big boat
donation program, which he
describes as "my greatest
goal." He is actively soliciting
the donation of yachts to the
Stanford sailing program, and
once he acquires the boats, he
will either use them in the pro
gram or sell them. The funds
thfey generate will be put
towards creating "a first class
program," and a year round
open-water sailing facility, in
cluding a boathouse, docks,
and caretaker facilities.
