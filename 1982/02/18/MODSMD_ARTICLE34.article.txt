# The
						Grand Daddy of collegiate sports
## Crew splashes for national recognition 
### Lisa Stern 
What's the oldest in
tercollegiate sports competi
tion in the United States? Ten
nis? Football? Swimming?
Wrong. The oldest in
tercollegiate sports competi
tion in the nation is rowing
crew. "Rowing crew?" you ask.
"That's only a sport at those Ivy
League schools like Harvard
(sss) or Yale (sss). Wrong again.
Men's and women'screwcom
pete as a club sport at Stanford.
In fact, Stanford students have
rowed crew since 1904.
The 1982 men'sand women's
teams started workouts in Oc
tober. Both squads now prac
tice in the mornings beginning
at 6 a.m. for the ladies and 6:30
a.m. for the men. The teams
work out three times a week on
the water at Redwood Marina,
and they use other practice ses
sions to lift weights and do en
durance or running exercises.
In a typical water practice out
ing, the men's team rows
600-800 full power strokes —
the equivalent of 8000 meters.
The men's crew, coached by
Bob Whitford, includes 17 re
turning varsity membersand 20
freshmen and novice oarsmen.
When the pre-season work
outs began last October, 84
men turned out. Whitford be
lieves that his 17-man squad
represents the cream of the
crop.
"You can expect a certain at
trition rate," he explained,
"because rowing is such a spe
cial sport. It is very demanding,
but we never cut anyone. The
people who want to row get to
row."
Because the program cannot
actively recruit, most of its
members have no previous
rowing experience.
"We literally pull people out
of the lines at registration and
ask them to join the team,"

Whitford said, "because col
lege is the time when most
people try the sport. A lot of
men come to see what it's
about. But the better people
stay and row during the sea
son."
Whitford, now in his second
season of coaching at Stanford,
stated that he is impressed with
his team's improvement.
"Although you can never re
ally tell until you're on the race
course, I believe that we're on
the right track to a successful
season," he commented.
"I can't say enough about
how proud I am of the guys and
their hard work and dedi
cation. Our goal is to win every
race we're in."
The women's team, which
finished fourth in the country
last year, consists of 2 eight
member varsity and 2 eight
member junior varsity squads.
Like their male counterparts,
many of the women were
pulled from the lines at regis
tration.

Head coach John Davis ex
plained, "We set a size stan
dard, because women who are
5-2 or 5-3 simply don't have the
reach needed to compete in
crew. We grab girls who are
5-10 and up — girls who look
strong. And we look for athlet
ic experience."
"By the middle of the sea
son," he continued, "there
isn't a kid out there who
doesn'nt love the sport and
want to be there. Crew is sim
ply too demanding as a sport."
Davis said that he believes
that there are two differences
between men's and women's
crew. First, until recently,
women sometimes lacked the
necessary general athletic ex
perience which men obtain in
high school. Secondly, he
stressed that women lack the
size and the strength of the
men who row.
"Women are just as
motivated, just as hard work
ing, and just as dedicated as the
men, but they lack the upper

body strength which is so im
portant in the shorter course
that women compete on," he
stated.
"We probably emphasize
the weight lifting program
even more than the men," he
added, "because upper body
strenght is such a limiting fac
tor for the women."
Davis said that he is op
timistic about his team's
chances for a successful sea
son. He cites his team's second
place west coast finish last year
as one reason for this op
timism.
"We'll also have the biggest
boat that we've ever had at
Stanford," he explained. "All
the kids have worked hard, and
we have a good core to pull us
through. We all sok forward to
the possibility of going to the
AIAW championships."
Both teams begin their sea
sons on April 3 at the San Diego
Crew Classic. The event fea
tures several top West Coast
poweres, including the na

tionaldefending champion
University of Washington team
and the University of Califor
nia. East Coast representatives
include Harvard, Radcliffe,
Vale, and Cornell.
Davis and Whitford agreed
that club sports have both
positive and negative aspects.
"I can tell you the disadvan
tage in one word," Davis said.
"Financial. The kids have to
clean the stadium and partici
pate in a row-a-thon to raise
money to compete."
"Crewisa tremendously cost
intensive sport," Whitford
added, "and the expenditures
for equipment are huge."
"But, as a result of this extra
effort, the success of out pro
gram is our own," Davis con
cluded. "Every bit of their suc
cess reflects right back on the
kids, noton theathleticdepart
ment. Stanford University
doesn't make it run, they do.
And they do it with heart.

OARSMEN TRAIN HARD — Crew members rise at dawn and row 8000 meters in water workouts. These sessions are
supplemented by weightlifting and running exercises.
