# Ski team racers train dry, but race up high
## 
### Andrew Eills 
If Stanford had its own
mountain, complete with ski
lifts right behind the Dish,
members of the Stanford com
munity would be able to see
some of the finest skiers on
campus in competition.
Unfortunately, no such
mountain exists and both spec
tators and ski team members
must brave a five-hour drive to
Lake Tahoe in order to see the
ski team race.
Despite the long hours spent
driving and the heavy academ
ic load associated with winter
quarter, the ski team has had a
successful season so far. Led by
captains Mike Duncan, Jeff
Grainger, Cindy Howell, and
Lori Eng, the team has proven

that a school located far away
from the slopes can still be
competitive.
, The team races against such
schools as the University of
Nevada at Reno, Sierra Col
lege, Davis, and Berkeley.
"U.N.R. and Sierra College
usually dominate the races, but
after that the league is pretty
competitive," Duncan said.
"Berkeley provides solid com
petition, but we should be able
to beat them."
In the Winter Carnival
hosted by the University of Ne
vada at Reno and held at
Alpine Meadows, the men's
team managed to place third in
the slalom and fifth in the giant
slalom.

"This third place finish
proves that Stanford is capable
of racing well," co-captain
Mike Duncan explained about
the race.
Training on the snow and off
has been an important factor in
the team's success so far. Be
ginning in the fall, dry-land
workouts have included five
mile runs, agility drills, soccer,
and "stadium steps."
The actual on-snow training
started during the team's
Christmas camp, but because
of the rainy weather, the team
could only run gates one day.
"I think that reallyset us back
a bit," Duncan said. "Skiing
through gates and being
forced to make quick turns at

high speeds is what racing is all
about. Having only one day of
on-snow gate running was a lit
tle disappointing. Never
theless, I think we've done well
so far."
Part of the reason the team
has done well can be attributed
to the team's coaches, Tim
Mills and Richy Ross.
Another reason for the
team's success lies in the com
petition between team mem
bers. There is not any one racer
who consistently finishes bet
ter than anyone else, and con
sequently there is a lot of com
petition between the members
of both the "A" and "B" teams.
On both the men's and
women's teams, the freshmen

have more than proven their
worth. Todd Watson and Greg
Hall are the two most dominant
freshmen on the men's team,
while Kari Skilbred and Lisa Sue
Gitkin helped spearhead the
women's team.
Both Duncan and Grainger
agree that there has been a
great deal of improvement in
everyone's racing ability this
winter, even with the problems
the team had during its training
camp over Christmas.
"Aggressiveness and con
centration are important in ski
racing," co-captain Grainger
explained. 'Our team has both
these qualities, and that's why
we've done well so far this
year."
