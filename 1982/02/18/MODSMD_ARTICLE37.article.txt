# Mike Lee won't succumb to fear
## Reflections on a gymnast's career 
### Casey Raftery 
Fear. An emotion which can
paralyze the body if allowed to
run the mind. An emotion that
senior gymnast Mike Lee can
not afford to give in to. For a
gymnast, who works on dan

gerous apparatus for ' ee or
four hours a day, controlling
fear is a difficult achievement.
"The tricks we do in our rou
tines have been done so many
times in practice that we aren't

afraid of them," Lee said. "A
gymnast's fear cannot be in
capacitating. There is just
enough fear to give you an in
creased sense of awareness, no
more."

Lee, a gymnast who has been
leading coach Sadao Hamada's
men's team this year, was first
introduced to gymnastics in
the fourth grade through a Los
Angeles City School's youth
service program. "It was just a
matter of me taking to the
sport," Lee said. "I really wasn't
that athletic when I was young
er."
It is hard to believe that the
lithe, muscular, finely toned
Lee was not athletic as a youth,
but like every athlete, his phys
ical shape is determined by
hours of practice and a
monitored diet.
"I try to keep my diet down
to a manageable level," Lee ex
plained. "Sadao doesn't get
down on us about our weight
because its our own responsi
bility, but if you feel horrible,
you know you've been eating
too much!"
After the long, exhausting
practices, Lee usually lounges
around for an hour or so and
ices any sore or injured joints
or muscles. "I usually have to
take a break after practice and
change my mental state from
doing something physical, to
doing homework," he said.
"I've found a balance be
tween my sport and academ
ics," Lee said. "Gymnastics al
lows me a change. When I go to
practice I think I'm not going to
worry about academics now,
I'm just going to work out."
Whereas other students party

or jog to release tension during
finals, Lee said, "I have to work
out for my mental sanity. If I
don't, I find my mind wander
ing and I fall asleep."
With time divided between
academics and gymnastics, it is
hard to have a social life. "For
the first three years at Stanford
I didn't have much time for
anything but gymnastics," Lee
explained.
Looking back on it, he wishes
he had done something more
social, but would never trade
his experience with the gym
nastics team. "I've derived a lot
from the sport," Lee said. "It
has developed my self-con
fidence, and my agressiveness.
I also know my limitations, and
know that I can sometimes sur
pass those limitations."
Lee is a prime example of the
student-athlete Stanford is so
proud of. "When I came to
Stanford, I evaluated my abili
ties and decided that academ
ics would come first for me,"
Lee said. "I put as much as I can
into gymnastics without sacri
ficing my academics."
It looks as if Lee's strategies
have paid off. He has been ac
cepted to several medical
schoolsand planstoattendone
of them next fall.
"I'll probably quit com
petitive gymnastics after this
year, but I'll still work out," Lee
said. "I'm looking forward to
sliding out of gymnastics and
moving on to other things."
