It'sanodd placeforit, butfor
members of Stanford's ice
hockey club, it's a sport they've
always known in a place that's
new to them.
Only a couple of home
grown Californians sprinkle
the 55-man squad, but the
team probably best epitomizes
the melting pot image of Stan
ford University.
The team, one of the best of
the west, is a curious con
glomeration of Canadiens,
transplanted Easterners, Mid
westerners and representatives
from, basically, anywhere.
Stanford tri-captain, Les
Landsberger says the team is
basically an outlet for the stu
dents who happened to play
hockey as they grew up, not
football or basketball.
"When I grew up," Land
sberger said, "hockey was the
big sport. Everyone played it. If
you didn't, you were the ex
ception. At Stanford, it's kind
of an unknown sport, but the
club allows us to continue to
play the sport we all realiy
love."
Tri-captain Dave Wright said
hockey has gained a little more
recognition.
"The U.S.'s gold medal in
hockey gave the sport a little
more national recognition,"
Wright said. "In my home town

(Toronto, Ontario), the East
and Midwest, hockey has
always been a big-time sport,
but it has only been since the
Winter Olympics that people
out here began toappreciate it.
"I don't know how many
people have asked me what it's
like," Wright continued.
"Most people think im
mediately of fights and goons.
Sure, there is some of that, but
the kind we play and grew up
with is just fast skatingand pass
ing."
Both Landsberger and the
third tri-captain, Dave Spier,
have played varsity college
hockey at Ivy League schools.
Spier played for Brown Uni
versity last year, but transferred
back to the Farm.
"Hockey is definately a lot
bigger at Brown — probably
their main sport," Spier, club
sport president said, "but that
doesn't mean it was all that
more enjoyable than here. The
guys really like to play here.
They have to it costs a lot. We
all like to win; we work hard,
but we also have a lot of fun.
Everyone gets to play. We have
two teams, enough games for
both teams and if someone is
just starting out and isnotquite
ready to play a game, we have
intra-squad scrimmages that
give everyone equal playing
time no matter how long

they've been playing."
Spier says that besides the
problem of having to travel to
Belmont for practice and home
games, scheduling presents a
small problem.
"We can usually get enough
games," Spier said, "but we
have to screen out a lot of
teams. A lot of the teams we
used to play were local semi
pro or amateur clubs that just
went out to fight. We usually
were able to take care of
ourselves, but it takes a lot of
fun out of the game when you
have to be continually looking
out for cheap shots."


ICERS BATTLE — Stanford ice hockey players battle for the puck around the^ettost' °
weekend. Stanford has lost only one game this season.
Landsberger played for
Harvard as an undergraduate
before coming to Stanford as a
graduate student in
mathematics.
"At Harvard, most of the
players were on scholarship so
I really didn't get a chance to
prove myself," Landsberger
said,"Here I gettoplayandthe
game is a lot more fun. Since
we let everyone play, I think
they all have a good time and
don't get bitter about ice
time."
