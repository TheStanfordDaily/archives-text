# Seventeen companies sponsoring CIS
## CIS 
### Bill Beyda 
Funded primarily by industry, Stan
ford's new Center for Integrated Sys
tems (CIS), represents a major break
from the tradition of government
funding of university research which
began during World War 11.
The wave of recent federal budget
cuts has caused more universities to
look elsewhere for financial support
of future research. For CIS, Stanford
turned to industry.
Seventeen companies have agreed
to give $250,000 a year for the next
three years to help construct CIS.
Among the companies are General
Electric, TRW, Hewlett-Packard,
Northrup, Xerox, Texas Instruments,
Fairchild Semiconductor, Hon
eywell, IBM Tektronics, DEC, Intel,
ITT, GTE, Motorola, Monsanto and
United Technologies. In addition, a
portion of an $8 million contract
from the Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency of the De
partment of Defense, will go toward
construction of the facility.
"We will be providing the inte
grated systems industry, including
sponsors and non-sponsors, with the

series.

largest pool of highly selective peo
ple in this field/' said John Linvill, co
director of CIS and professor of elec
trical engineering.
"Universities are the sole source of
new professionals in this field and the
sponsors of CIS will have a facilitated
access to ours," he said.
"The sponsors aren't buying stu
dents with their money, but they are
getting an opportunity to get to
know them first hand," Linvill said.
The students, in turn, will get to know
the companies, all of whom will be
provided with office space here.
"I would say our primary motiva
tion as a sponsor is to expand our

knowledge of microcomputer tech
nology and have our own re
searchers stimulated," said George
Pake of Xerox Palo Alto.
"It gives our in-house people a
chance to be stimulated by en
thusiastic students. . .shall we say,
'eager young minds.' This is a real
benefit," Pake said. "Certainly we
will meet some students who we will
hope to take into our organization
someday, but this is secondary to the
benefits to our own research."
Xerox spends $500 million annually
on research and development, with
about 15 percent of that spent on
pure research, according to Pake.

Just a little more than 1 percent of
Xerox's pure research budget is des
ignated for CIS.
"We will not be directing specifi
cally what research goes on at CIS, as
we can in our own facilities, but some
of what is discovered will certainly be
useful to us," said Pake.
Sponsors will be consulted for re
search suggestions, but will not be
able to insist on specific projects, ac
cording to Linvill. At present, it ap
pears the patent arrangements will
be patterned after the arrangements
the University has with government
sponsors. Sponsors will have access
to the patents through licensing, but
not exclusive access.
"Xerox is not concerned with pat
ent rights. If we want to patent some
thing we'll do it at our own lab," Pake
said.
The funding of university research
by industry will probably not super
cede government funding, said Pake.
"CIS is an especially fitting set-up for
integrated circuit research at Stan
ford." he said, "It's in the middle of
Silicon Valley, which is probably here

because Stanford is, but I don't think
it will be the wave of the future for all
areas. Universities that are strong in
certain fields may set up similar ar
rangements with different industries,
but government funding for univer
ses research will still be the most im
portant because industry can only
spend a limited amount on pure re
search."
Several other universities, includ
ing MIT, UC-Berkeley, University of
Minnesota, Carnegie-Mellon, and

the Research Triangle Park group in
North Carolina (Duke University,
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, North Carolina State at
Raleigh and North Carolina A and T
State University at Greensborough)
have set up similar programs, but
none are as developed as CIS, ac
cording to Linvill.
"The other universities have made
much less progress in integrated sys
tems. Stanford has the lead in the
area combining integrated circuits
and computer systems," Linvill said.
Part three of this aeries, which
focusses on the facility itself, will ap
pear tomorrow.
