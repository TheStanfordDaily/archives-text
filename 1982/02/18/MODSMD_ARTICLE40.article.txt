# Eastern prep moves west
## Lacrosse: a ballet with sticks 
### Mark Zeigler 
Lacrosse has been described
by some as a ballet with a stick
and ball. Indeed, the sport
combines the elements of soc
cer, hockey, basketball, and
football into a fast-paced, phys
ically demanding whole.
Despite lacrosse's varied ap
peal, it has been played almost
exclusively in the eastern por
tion of the United States. Cali
fornians play tennis and golf,
while easterners play lacross
and hockey. So the myth goes.
The Stanford men's and
women's club sport lacrosse
teams are doing their part to in
troduce the sport to the West
Coast. "It's really come a long
way," said junior Kathleen Nic
olson, an active member of
Stanford's women's team.
Nicolson, who grew up in
New England with a lacrosse
stick in her hand, sees a big dif
ference between East and West
coast lacrosse. "It's quite a dif
ferent thing out here, because
quite a lot of time is sper.'
teaching new players how to
play," she explained.
Chris Romer, one of trie
men's team captains, agrees
with Nicolson. "In general, the
level of sophistication is not as
high here as it is in the East.
Much less organization and
thinking goes into the game
out here."
Both teams consist of ex
perienced and inexperienced
East and West coast players. But
the friction between those who
know how to play and those
who don't is minimal.
Vic Kazanjian, the men's as
sistant coach, entered Harvard
University as an under
graduate, having never played
competitive lacrosse. In two
years he was a starting mid
fielder. Kazanjian is therefore a
firm believer that learning the
game in college is possible.
The club sports program at
tempts to make it as easy as
possible to learn the intricacies
of lacrosse by keeping a lower
key atmosphere than is typi
cally found on a varsity level.
"The low pressure is really an

asset," Nicolson said.
John Blum, a first year player,
finds that lacrosse is a sport
which is easy to pick up quick
ly. "It's kind of a way for a frus
trated high school jock to go
out and have a really great
time," Blum explained. "It's
one of the greatest ways to en
joy yourself outside of class."
In Romer's words, Stanford's
lacrosse program "is no small
commitment." The season be
gins in January and runs
through late May, encompass
ing both the Winter and Spring
academic quarters. Because of
harsh weather, East Coast
lacrosse does not start until the
end of March, making Stan
ford's season nearly three
months longer.
Both teams are members of
lacrosse leagues. The men are
in the Western Collegiate
Lacrosse Conference (WCLC)
and play UC Berkeley, UC
Davis, and the University of the
Pacific in their northern
division. The southern division
includes UC Santa Barbara, San
Diego State, and Claremont
College.

The women's team is a mem
ber of the California Women's
Lacrosse Association (CWLA),
which consists of lacrosse clubs
from the Palo Alto, San Jose,
and Santa Barbara areas. Stan
ford sponsors the only club run
through a university.
The teams practice three
days a week, with a game each
weekend. But all the practice
seems to pays off, at least in
Stanford's case. The men's
squad is one of the top West
coast teams — they have not
lost the Northern California
Collegiate Championship
since 1973. The women's team
participated in the United
States Women's Lacrosse As
sociation National Tournament
last year.
"We are by far the strongest
team (in their league) because
we practice regularly, Nicolson
noted. "A lot of girls on the
lacrosse team are on the field
hockey team as well."
"Luckily you've got (at Stan
ford) draw on a lot of prep
school lacrosse players and a
lot of good athletes," Kazan
jian said.
