Industrial output plunges
Washington — The nation's industrial output plunged 3 percent last
month, matching the biggest decline in seven years and providing con
vincing evidence that the recession is deepening, new government fig
ures indicated yesterday.
Nevertheless, analysts inside and outside government still said the
economy should pick up somewhat by late spring. But Robert Ortner,
the Commerce Department's chief economist, said that if interest rates
keep rising "the recovery may be anemic."
Several major banks raised their prime lending rates from 16.5 per
cent to 17 percent yesterday. As recently as two weeks ago, the prime
had been 15.75 percent.
January's drop in U.S. industrial production was the largest of six suc
cessive monthly declines and showed industrial output one percentage
point below the lowest point of the 1980 recession, the new Federal Re
serve Board report said.
Ortner, noting December improvement in several economic in
dicators, said, "Things were coming along very nicely. I think basically
they still are, with inflation coming down."
"But I'm among those who are not happy with the recent increases in
interest rates," he said.
Rates had dropped somewhat as demand for credit fell off during the
first part of the recession, but short-term interest rates are rising steadily
again.
While interest rates often fall during recessions, many analysts say
rates remain under pressure because rot . ' 1 >»; growth of the
money supply, the Federal Reserve's efforts to contain that growth, and
an increase in short-term credit demand.
Defense to hurt economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
Council of Economic Advisers says the sharp in
crease he has proposed in defense spending
over the next six years will create "adverse eco
nomic effects" as the Pentagon competes with
reviving civilian demand for durable goods.
Weapons-buving would rise even faster un
der the Reagan plan than during the peak of the
Vietnam buildup. Between 1981 and 1987, the
CEA says in its annual report, procurement of
major weapons systems and outlays for military
research and development would soar at an af
ter-inflation annual rate of 16 percent.
This would come at the precise time that the
private economy's demand for durable goods
also should be expanding.
"The U.S. economy asa whole should beable
to accommodate the projected expansion in
defense spending without experiencing an in
crease in the general inflation rate," the CEA re
port says.
However, it goes on to concede that "un
usual growth in any spending category, military
or civilian, makes the goal of overall restraint
that much more difficult to achieve."
The CEA report cites not only higher prices
that will have to be paid for defense goods and
for civilian products competing for the same
manufacturing capacity, but "some temporary
crowding-out of private investment."
Moreover, since private industry and the
Pentagon must draw on the same manpower
pool, the CEA suggested that the military may
find it increasingly difficult to attract personnel,
especially skilled people.
The manpower shortage occasioned bv the
Pentagon's plan to boost active-duty forces 9
percent to 10 percent over the next five years
might be met by costly bonus payments to en
couragement enlistments for personnel vvitl
special skills, or a return to a peacetime draft,
the CEA said. Either course will involve added
"real costs to the economy."
Polish police launch dragnet
Warsaw — Thousands of Polish police, many
striking at night, launched the biggest na
tionwide dragnet since martial law was imposed
in Poland and detained 3500 people for vio
lating military regulations, officials said yester
day.
The official news agency PAP said 25,000 regu
lar and volunteer policemen took part in the4B
- sweep, but did not say when it was com
pleted.
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Dean Fischer called the detentions "deeply up
setting," and said they made "a mockery of all
recent Polish government statements to the ef
fect that life is beginning to return to normal in
Poland."
In another development, Radio Warsaw
monitored in Vienna criticized Poland's Roman
Catholic Church, saying some priests were act
ing "irresponsibly" by criticizing internment
camps and other martial law measures.
In its report of the mass roundups, PAP said
that in addition to the 3500 detained another
7000 were fined for martial law violations.
PAP said police checked 51,000 shops, 60,000
vehicles and 3500 hideouts for "criminal ele
ments," adding: "It can be stated on the basis of

reports of police patrols that the state of obe
dience to existing regulations of martial law is
not the best."
Mexico trains defense force
Mexico City — Mexico has begun training a
4000-man quick-reaction force designed to de
fend the country's southern border and lucra
tive oilfields against a possible spillover of Cen
tral America's turbulent guerrilla wars, accord
ing to official sources here.
The elite quick-reaction force is the latest
stage of a major effort to expand and mod
ernize the Mexican armed forces, which past
governments have kept deliberately small and
relatively powerless.
Over the past three years, the Army has
grown by 25 percent to 120,000 soldiers. In -\u
gust, the first six of 12 F-5 jet fighters are due for
delivery from the United States. About 100 Mex
ican personnel are receiving U.S. training on
the planes, the sale of which originallv was op
posed by the Carter administration on the basis
of longstanding U.S. policy against the in
troduction of sophisticated aircraft into the re
gion.
The Carter administration eventually ap
proved the sale. Although the F-5 is relatively
low on the scale of sophistication, the $110-mil
lion deal will provide a substantial boost for
Mexico's antiquated Air Force and provide the
first major step bevond the military require
ments considered necessary to maintain in
ternal order.
Mexico also has purchased almost 40 Mopard
anti-tank vehicles from France and ordered
about 60 Pilatus planes from Switzerland. Al
though the single-engine planes normally are
used as trainers, sources close to the Mexican
military said these will be armed for possible
combat purposes.
The government reportedly is shopping in
the United States for an radar air-defense sys
tem.
U.S. interest hinders Europe
Washington — Belgian Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens, speaking for the European
Community, told President Ronald Reagan yes
terday that high interest rates in the United
States are making it more difficult for European
nations to solve their own economic problems.
It was the same message that European lead
ers had carried to the president at the economic
summit in Ottawa, Canada, last July, when Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said that in
terest rates were "now the highest since Jesus
Christ."
Reagan said that he and Martens had con
ducted "a very valuable meeting and covered a
great range of issues." He made no mention of
interest rates but said there was "great agree
ment'' on the U.S. position on El Salvador and
the necessity of reducing nuclear forces in Eu
rope.
In his brief reply, Martens said that the dif
ferences between the United States and Europe
were more of "tactics" than "substance." But
he also referred to "an open and frank ex
change of views," a common diplomatic eu
phemism for disagreement.

Gen. judges El Salvador aid
San Salvador — Lt. Gen. Wallace Nutting, the
senior U.S. Army commander in Latin America,
met with El Salvador's defense minister yester
day to assess American aid to the beleaguered
Salvadoran military.
In a related development, the Salvadoran mil
itary high command said onl\ 28 leftist guerrillas
were killed during a five-day army offensive last
week in southeastern Usulutan province. A
field commander in the operation had pre
viously claimed 400 guerrillas killed.
The command also denied reports that 400
peasants were massacred during the sweep.
Nutting, head of the Panama-based Southern
Command, arrived Tuesday following reports
that the guerrillas were making headway in
their 27-month war to overthrow the ruling ci
vilian-military junta.
A U.S. Embassy source, who asked anonymity
for diplomatic reasons, said Nuttingwould
"assess the effectiveness of our military as
sistance" during his three-day visit.
He said Nutting "will visit places where our
trainers are working with the Salvadorans" as
well as meet with top military officials.
The Reagan administration announced
earlier this month that it was sending $55 million
in emergency military aid to El Salvador's civil
ian-military junta, in addition to $25 million ap
proved by Congress two months before.
In addition, about 50 U.S. non-combat mili
tary advisers have been here since early 1981,
helping train Salvadoran officers and troops in
anti-guerrilla combat and servicing equipment.
The Reagan administration's announcement
of additional aid followed a daring guerrilla raid
Jan. 27 on a military airport outside San Salvador
in which more than a dozen helicopters and
planes were damaged or destroyed — half the
junta's air force.
Western diplomats and relief workers, who
asked anonymity for security reasons, estimated
the guerrillas move almost at will through 10 of
El Salvador's 15 provinces.
The Reagan administration has said addi
tional U.S. military aid is necessary to prevent a
leftist takeover of the nation.
Church and human rights groups estimate
32,000 people have died in the past 2-4 years of
fighting, including civilians killed by leftist
guerrillas, government soldiers or rightists who
support the troops.
Market posts scattered losses
New York — The Dow Jones industrial aver
age slipped to an early-1982 low vesterday as the
stock market posted some scattered losses.
The Dow Jones industrials dropped 3.71 to
827.63, their lowest close since they stood at
824.01 last Sept. 25.
The only issue among the Dow's 30 compo
nents moving as much as a point was American
Telephone & Telegraph, which led the active
list and dropped 1 1 a to 57.
Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues,
including trades in those stocks on regional ex
changes and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 56.30 million shares.
Today's weather
Fair through tonight with increasing cloudi
ness tomorrow. Lows will be in the 40s, with a
high temperature of 62 and light winds.

Washington — The nation's industrial output plunged 3 percent last
month, matching the biggest decline in seven years and providing con
vincing evidence that the recession is deepening, new government fig
ures indicated yesterday.
Nevertheless, analysts inside and outside government still said the
economy should pick up somewhat by late spring. But Robert Ortner,
the Commerce Department's chief economist, said that if interest rates
keep rising "the recovery may be anemic."
Several major banks raised their prime lending rates from 16.5 per
cent to 17 percent yesterday. As recently as two weeks ago, the prime
had been 15.75 percent.
January's drop in U.S. industrial production was the largest of six suc
cessive monthly declines and showed industrial output one percentage
point below the lowest point of the 1980 recession, the new Federal Re
serve Board report said.
Ortner, noting December improvement in several economic in
dicators, said, "Things were coming along very nicely. I think basically
they still are, with inflation coming down."
"But I'm among those who are not happy with the recent increases in
interest rates," he said.
Rates had dropped somewhat as demand for credit fell off during the
first part of the recession, but short-term interest rates are rising steadily
again.
While interest rates often fall during recessions, many analysts say
rates remain under pressure because rot . ' 1 >»; growth of the
money supply, the Federal Reserve's efforts to contain that growth, and
an increase in short-term credit demand.
Defense to hurt economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
Council of Economic Advisers says the sharp in
crease he has proposed in defense spending
over the next six years will create "adverse eco
nomic effects" as the Pentagon competes with
reviving civilian demand for durable goods.
Weapons-buving would rise even faster un
der the Reagan plan than during the peak of the
Vietnam buildup. Between 1981 and 1987, the
CEA says in its annual report, procurement of
major weapons systems and outlays for military
research and development would soar at an af
ter-inflation annual rate of 16 percent.
This would come at the precise time that the
private economy's demand for durable goods
also should be expanding.
"The U.S. economy asa whole should beable
to accommodate the projected expansion in
defense spending without experiencing an in
crease in the general inflation rate," the CEA re
port says.
However, it goes on to concede that "un
usual growth in any spending category, military
or civilian, makes the goal of overall restraint
that much more difficult to achieve."
The CEA report cites not only higher prices
that will have to be paid for defense goods and
for civilian products competing for the same
manufacturing capacity, but "some temporary
crowding-out of private investment."
Moreover, since private industry and the
Pentagon must draw on the same manpower
pool, the CEA suggested that the military may
find it increasingly difficult to attract personnel,
especially skilled people.
The manpower shortage occasioned bv the
Pentagon's plan to boost active-duty forces 9
percent to 10 percent over the next five years
might be met by costly bonus payments to en
couragement enlistments for personnel vvitl
special skills, or a return to a peacetime draft,
the CEA said. Either course will involve added
"real costs to the economy."
Polish police launch dragnet
Warsaw — Thousands of Polish police, many
striking at night, launched the biggest na
tionwide dragnet since martial law was imposed
in Poland and detained 3500 people for vio
lating military regulations, officials said yester
day.
The official news agency PAP said 25,000 regu
lar and volunteer policemen took part in the4B
- sweep, but did not say when it was com
pleted.
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Dean Fischer called the detentions "deeply up
setting," and said they made "a mockery of all
recent Polish government statements to the ef
fect that life is beginning to return to normal in
Poland."
In another development, Radio Warsaw
monitored in Vienna criticized Poland's Roman
Catholic Church, saying some priests were act
ing "irresponsibly" by criticizing internment
camps and other martial law measures.
In its report of the mass roundups, PAP said
that in addition to the 3500 detained another
7000 were fined for martial law violations.
PAP said police checked 51,000 shops, 60,000
vehicles and 3500 hideouts for "criminal ele
ments," adding: "It can be stated on the basis of

reports of police patrols that the state of obe
dience to existing regulations of martial law is
not the best."
Mexico trains defense force
Mexico City — Mexico has begun training a
4000-man quick-reaction force designed to de
fend the country's southern border and lucra
tive oilfields against a possible spillover of Cen
tral America's turbulent guerrilla wars, accord
ing to official sources here.
The elite quick-reaction force is the latest
stage of a major effort to expand and mod
ernize the Mexican armed forces, which past
governments have kept deliberately small and
relatively powerless.
Over the past three years, the Army has
grown by 25 percent to 120,000 soldiers. In -\u
gust, the first six of 12 F-5 jet fighters are due for
delivery from the United States. About 100 Mex
ican personnel are receiving U.S. training on
the planes, the sale of which originallv was op
posed by the Carter administration on the basis
of longstanding U.S. policy against the in
troduction of sophisticated aircraft into the re
gion.
The Carter administration eventually ap
proved the sale. Although the F-5 is relatively
low on the scale of sophistication, the $110-mil
lion deal will provide a substantial boost for
Mexico's antiquated Air Force and provide the
first major step bevond the military require
ments considered necessary to maintain in
ternal order.
Mexico also has purchased almost 40 Mopard
anti-tank vehicles from France and ordered
about 60 Pilatus planes from Switzerland. Al
though the single-engine planes normally are
used as trainers, sources close to the Mexican
military said these will be armed for possible
combat purposes.
The government reportedly is shopping in
the United States for an radar air-defense sys
tem.
U.S. interest hinders Europe
Washington — Belgian Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens, speaking for the European
Community, told President Ronald Reagan yes
terday that high interest rates in the United
States are making it more difficult for European
nations to solve their own economic problems.
It was the same message that European lead
ers had carried to the president at the economic
summit in Ottawa, Canada, last July, when Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said that in
terest rates were "now the highest since Jesus
Christ."
Reagan said that he and Martens had con
ducted "a very valuable meeting and covered a
great range of issues." He made no mention of
interest rates but said there was "great agree
ment'' on the U.S. position on El Salvador and
the necessity of reducing nuclear forces in Eu
rope.
In his brief reply, Martens said that the dif
ferences between the United States and Europe
were more of "tactics" than "substance." But
he also referred to "an open and frank ex
change of views," a common diplomatic eu
phemism for disagreement.

Gen. judges El Salvador aid
San Salvador — Lt. Gen. Wallace Nutting, the
senior U.S. Army commander in Latin America,
met with El Salvador's defense minister yester
day to assess American aid to the beleaguered
Salvadoran military.
In a related development, the Salvadoran mil
itary high command said onl\ 28 leftist guerrillas
were killed during a five-day army offensive last
week in southeastern Usulutan province. A
field commander in the operation had pre
viously claimed 400 guerrillas killed.
The command also denied reports that 400
peasants were massacred during the sweep.
Nutting, head of the Panama-based Southern
Command, arrived Tuesday following reports
that the guerrillas were making headway in
their 27-month war to overthrow the ruling ci
vilian-military junta.
A U.S. Embassy source, who asked anonymity
for diplomatic reasons, said Nuttingwould
"assess the effectiveness of our military as
sistance" during his three-day visit.
He said Nutting "will visit places where our
trainers are working with the Salvadorans" as
well as meet with top military officials.
The Reagan administration announced
earlier this month that it was sending $55 million
in emergency military aid to El Salvador's civil
ian-military junta, in addition to $25 million ap
proved by Congress two months before.
In addition, about 50 U.S. non-combat mili
tary advisers have been here since early 1981,
helping train Salvadoran officers and troops in
anti-guerrilla combat and servicing equipment.
The Reagan administration's announcement
of additional aid followed a daring guerrilla raid
Jan. 27 on a military airport outside San Salvador
in which more than a dozen helicopters and
planes were damaged or destroyed — half the
junta's air force.
Western diplomats and relief workers, who
asked anonymity for security reasons, estimated
the guerrillas move almost at will through 10 of
El Salvador's 15 provinces.
The Reagan administration has said addi
tional U.S. military aid is necessary to prevent a
leftist takeover of the nation.
Church and human rights groups estimate
32,000 people have died in the past 2-4 years of
fighting, including civilians killed by leftist
guerrillas, government soldiers or rightists who
support the troops.
Market posts scattered losses
New York — The Dow Jones industrial aver

month, matching the biggest decline in seven years and providing con
vincing evidence that the recession is deepening, new government fig
ures indicated yesterday.
Nevertheless, analysts inside and outside government still said the
economy should pick up somewhat by late spring. But Robert Ortner,
the Commerce Department's chief economist, said that if interest rates
keep rising "the recovery may be anemic."
Several major banks raised their prime lending rates from 16.5 per
cent to 17 percent yesterday. As recently as two weeks ago, the prime
had been 15.75 percent.
January's drop in U.S. industrial production was the largest of six suc
cessive monthly declines and showed industrial output one percentage
point below the lowest point of the 1980 recession, the new Federal Re
serve Board report said.
Ortner, noting December improvement in several economic in
dicators, said, "Things were coming along very nicely. I think basically
they still are, with inflation coming down."
"But I'm among those who are not happy with the recent increases in
interest rates," he said.
Rates had dropped somewhat as demand for credit fell off during the
first part of the recession, but short-term interest rates are rising steadily
again.
While interest rates often fall during recessions, many analysts say
rates remain under pressure because rot . ' 1 >»; growth of the
money supply, the Federal Reserve's efforts to contain that growth, and
an increase in short-term credit demand.
Defense to hurt economy
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
Council of Economic Advisers says the sharp in
crease he has proposed in defense spending
over the next six years will create "adverse eco
nomic effects" as the Pentagon competes with
reviving civilian demand for durable goods.
Weapons-buving would rise even faster un
der the Reagan plan than during the peak of the
Vietnam buildup. Between 1981 and 1987, the
CEA says in its annual report, procurement of
major weapons systems and outlays for military
research and development would soar at an af
ter-inflation annual rate of 16 percent.
This would come at the precise time that the
private economy's demand for durable goods
also should be expanding.
"The U.S. economy asa whole should beable
to accommodate the projected expansion in
defense spending without experiencing an in
crease in the general inflation rate," the CEA re
port says.
However, it goes on to concede that "un
usual growth in any spending category, military
or civilian, makes the goal of overall restraint
that much more difficult to achieve."
The CEA report cites not only higher prices
that will have to be paid for defense goods and
for civilian products competing for the same
manufacturing capacity, but "some temporary
crowding-out of private investment."
Moreover, since private industry and the
Pentagon must draw on the same manpower
pool, the CEA suggested that the military may
find it increasingly difficult to attract personnel,
especially skilled people.
The manpower shortage occasioned bv the
Pentagon's plan to boost active-duty forces 9
percent to 10 percent over the next five years
might be met by costly bonus payments to en
couragement enlistments for personnel vvitl
special skills, or a return to a peacetime draft,
the CEA said. Either course will involve added
"real costs to the economy."
Polish police launch dragnet
Warsaw — Thousands of Polish police, many
striking at night, launched the biggest na
tionwide dragnet since martial law was imposed
in Poland and detained 3500 people for vio
lating military regulations, officials said yester
day.
The official news agency PAP said 25,000 regu
lar and volunteer policemen took part in the4B
- sweep, but did not say when it was com
pleted.
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Dean Fischer called the detentions "deeply up
setting," and said they made "a mockery of all
recent Polish government statements to the ef
fect that life is beginning to return to normal in
Poland."
In another development, Radio Warsaw
monitored in Vienna criticized Poland's Roman
Catholic Church, saying some priests were act
ing "irresponsibly" by criticizing internment
camps and other martial law measures.
In its report of the mass roundups, PAP said
that in addition to the 3500 detained another
7000 were fined for martial law violations.
PAP said police checked 51,000 shops, 60,000
vehicles and 3500 hideouts for "criminal ele
ments," adding: "It can be stated on the basis of

reports of police patrols that the state of obe
dience to existing regulations of martial law is
not the best."
Mexico trains defense force
Mexico City — Mexico has begun training a
4000-man quick-reaction force designed to de
fend the country's southern border and lucra
tive oilfields against a possible spillover of Cen
tral America's turbulent guerrilla wars, accord
ing to official sources here.
The elite quick-reaction force is the latest
stage of a major effort to expand and mod
ernize the Mexican armed forces, which past
governments have kept deliberately small and
relatively powerless.
Over the past three years, the Army has
grown by 25 percent to 120,000 soldiers. In -\u
gust, the first six of 12 F-5 jet fighters are due for
delivery from the United States. About 100 Mex
ican personnel are receiving U.S. training on
the planes, the sale of which originallv was op
posed by the Carter administration on the basis
of longstanding U.S. policy against the in
troduction of sophisticated aircraft into the re
gion.
The Carter administration eventually ap
proved the sale. Although the F-5 is relatively
low on the scale of sophistication, the $110-mil
lion deal will provide a substantial boost for
Mexico's antiquated Air Force and provide the
first major step bevond the military require
ments considered necessary to maintain in
ternal order.
Mexico also has purchased almost 40 Mopard
anti-tank vehicles from France and ordered
about 60 Pilatus planes from Switzerland. Al
though the single-engine planes normally are
used as trainers, sources close to the Mexican
military said these will be armed for possible
combat purposes.
The government reportedly is shopping in
the United States for an radar air-defense sys
tem.
U.S. interest hinders Europe
Washington — Belgian Prime Minister
Wilfried Martens, speaking for the European
Community, told President Ronald Reagan yes
terday that high interest rates in the United
States are making it more difficult for European
nations to solve their own economic problems.
It was the same message that European lead
ers had carried to the president at the economic
summit in Ottawa, Canada, last July, when Ger
man Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said that in
terest rates were "now the highest since Jesus
Christ."
Reagan said that he and Martens had con
ducted "a very valuable meeting and covered a
great range of issues." He made no mention of
interest rates but said there was "great agree
ment'' on the U.S. position on El Salvador and
the necessity of reducing nuclear forces in Eu
rope.
In his brief reply, Martens said that the dif
ferences between the United States and Europe
were more of "tactics" than "substance." But
he also referred to "an open and frank ex
change of views," a common diplomatic eu
phemism for disagreement.

Gen. judges El Salvador aid
San Salvador — Lt. Gen. Wallace Nutting, the
senior U.S. Army commander in Latin America,
met with El Salvador's defense minister yester
day to assess American aid to the beleaguered
Salvadoran military.
In a related development, the Salvadoran mil
itary high command said onl\ 28 leftist guerrillas
were killed during a five-day army offensive last
week in southeastern Usulutan province. A
field commander in the operation had pre
viously claimed 400 guerrillas killed.
The command also denied reports that 400
peasants were massacred during the sweep.
Nutting, head of the Panama-based Southern
Command, arrived Tuesday following reports
that the guerrillas were making headway in
their 27-month war to overthrow the ruling ci
vilian-military junta.
A U.S. Embassy source, who asked anonymity
for diplomatic reasons, said Nuttingwould
"assess the effectiveness of our military as
sistance" during his three-day visit.
He said Nutting "will visit places where our
trainers are working with the Salvadorans" as
well as meet with top military officials.
The Reagan administration announced
earlier this month that it was sending $55 million
in emergency military aid to El Salvador's civil
ian-military junta, in addition to $25 million ap
proved by Congress two months before.
In addition, about 50 U.S. non-combat mili
tary advisers have been here since early 1981,
helping train Salvadoran officers and troops in
anti-guerrilla combat and servicing equipment.
The Reagan administration's announcement
of additional aid followed a daring guerrilla raid
Jan. 27 on a military airport outside San Salvador
in which more than a dozen helicopters and
planes were damaged or destroyed — half the
junta's air force.
Western diplomats and relief workers, who
asked anonymity for security reasons, estimated
the guerrillas move almost at will through 10 of
El Salvador's 15 provinces.
The Reagan administration has said addi
tional U.S. military aid is necessary to prevent a
leftist takeover of the nation.
Church and human rights groups estimate
32,000 people have died in the past 2-4 years of
fighting, including civilians killed by leftist
guerrillas, government soldiers or rightists who
support the troops.
