Industrial output plunges
Washington — The nation's industrial output plunged 3 percent last
month, matching the biggest decline in seven years and providing con
vincing evidence that the recession is deepening, new government fig
ures indicated yesterday.
Nevertheless, analysts inside and outside government still said the
economy should pick up somewhat by late spring. But Robert Ortner,
the Commerce Department's chief economist, said that if interest rates
keep rising "the recovery may be anemic."
Several major banks raised their prime lending rates from 16.5 per
cent to 17 percent yesterday. As recently as two weeks ago, the prime
had been 15.75 percent.
January's drop in U.S. industrial production was the largest of six suc
cessive monthly declines and showed industrial output one percentage
point below the lowest point of the 1980 recession, the new Federal Re
serve Board report said.
Ortner, noting December improvement in several economic in
dicators, said, "Things were coming along very nicely. I think basically
they still are, with inflation coming down."
"But I'm among those who are not happy with the recent increases in
interest rates," he said.
Rates had dropped somewhat as demand for credit fell off during the
first part of the recession, but short-term interest rates are rising steadily
again.
While interest rates often fall during recessions, many analysts say
rates remain under pressure because rot . ' 1 >»; growth of the
money supply, the Federal Reserve's efforts to contain that growth, and
an increase in short-term credit demand.
