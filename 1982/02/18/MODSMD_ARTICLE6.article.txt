# Book biz will not die, panel here agrees

The book-publishing industry may
have to scale down its operations, but
good books will continue to be
printed, a panel of publishers agreed
last night.
Speaking as part of the ASSU Win
ter Writers Series in Kresge
Auditorium, Richard Marek of St.
Martin's Press in New York City said
publishing was in a state of transition:
"We're dealing with changing taste
without any steadfast rules."
Marek said the takeover of pub
lishing houses by large corporations
in the 70s was bad for the industry be
cause artists "who bare their souls to
the world" cannot be treated solely
as producers of a product. Books
cannot, as many corporations hoped,
easily be turned into movies and then
into cable shows and other com
mercial properties, because "books
and TV are not friends," he said.
"They involve different skills. And
good authors don't take orders."
Publishers have to consider com
mercial as well as artistic merits when
deciding what books to publish,
Marek said. "Joseph Conrad's not
lurking around the corner with a

manuscript, he's dead." But there is
good news, he said. "Whatever we in
publishing do to kill books, we will
not kill them."
james Wagenwood, of James
Wagenwood Studios in New York,
said small publishing houses are now
competing with larger firms. These
small companies often spend a year
carefully producing as few as seven
non-fiction books. These are often
the best houses to find a job in, he
said, because in a small operation
"everyone does everything."
Word processors and cable com
munications are "a godsend" to
small companies, Wagenwood said,
because they can now afford to com
municate across the country to
branch offices. Previously, only ma
jor publishing houses could do so.
"There are too many books being
published," Earnest Scott of the local
Goucha Press said. With only 7000
bookstores nationwide selling hard
cover books, a surplus of books has
resulted. West Coast publishers are
responding to a period of retrench
ment by specializing in types of
books such as travel, or concentrat
