# Largest of new dorms will be like row houses

This is the third in a four-part
series.
When the dormitory complex
known as Sterling Quad opens in
September 1983,m0re than five
years of planning and construc
tion spent in erecting the new res
idences near Lake Lagunita, will
come to an end.
Sterling Quad, the largest and
last component of the 800-person
housingcomplex andaccompany
ing program center, will hold 360
people in four 90-person dorms.
The construction of the dorms will
follow that of three Row House
style independent houses, suites
and eating centers and a program
center which will contain the
mailboxes and central offices of
the complex. These should all be
completed in April 1983, accord
ing to project manager Bob Ner
rie.
Three of the Sterling Quad

dorms will rise to three stories
while the fourth dorm will have a
fourth level which program direc
tor Jan Van Houten called a "pen
thouse suite." The dorms will sur
round a large patio area and the
central eating hall.
Sterling Quad will have a flare
not common in University resi
dences, according to Van Houten.
She called it not "just another
dorm." Included in the new de
sign are hallways similar to those
of the newly-renovated Storey
House, which "twist and turn and
have little corners where students
can talk privately .. . there will be
a real emphasis on privacy," she
said.
Consistent with this emphasis,
the rooms will be mostly singles
and one and two-room doubles.
The dorms will also have some tri
ples. The planned partitioning of
the large eating hall into four

smaller rooms will supplement the
privacy of the dorms, according to
Van Houten.
Equipped with the necessary out
lets for lighting and providing space
for a stage, the eating hall will also be
able to serve as a theater seating near
ly 400.
The program center, which will be

located directly beside the lake, is
also considered unique by planners.
The center will hold student
mailboxes for the entire complex, as
well as offices and a student snack
bar. Also, two multi-purpose rooms
accompanied by a large instructional
kitchen will be rented out tostudents
or used for dance classes, according
to Van Houten.
Tomorrow: Changes in University
policy and new programs connected
with the new residential complex.
