## Walesa reported healthy, looking forward to release 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Henryk Jankowski, a
Catholic priest who saw Lech Walesa Tues
day, described the interned Solidarity union
chief as bearded, rested, in good health and
enthusiastic — and likely to be freed in time
to attend the baptism of his newborn daugh
ter March 7.
Walesa has been in confinement in the
Warsaw area since the imposition of martiai
law Dec. 13, when he was flown here from his
home in Gdansk. Government officials are
reported to have visited him intermittently
during the past two months to discuss the
future of the trade union movement in Po
land. But Walesa is said to have insisted that
any formal negotiations with the authorities
on the union question can only take place
when Solidarity's full 17-member executive
council is present. Most of the council mem
bers are in detention centers.
"From what Mr. Lech told me, (by) setting a
date forthe baptizing, I think that he'll return

very quickly because he wantsto be present."
Jankowski said Walesa gave him a brief
written statement denying any leaflets that
may have been issued over his alleged signa
ture in recent weeks.
"In connection with emerging calls and
leaflets with my signature," the statement
said, "I state that from Dec. 13 I have not is
sued any leaflets. All such surfacing with my
signature are being provocatively fabricated.
My concept of struggle is different and I will
explain it after coming out."
Pressed for details about how the 38-year
old union leader is coping, Jankowski said
Walesa is smoking a great deal. He has access
to books, radio and television and is informed
about the general situation in Poland.
Jankowski said Walesa had grown a beard
but intended to shave it upon his release. He
described Walesa as "dreaming and thinking
first of all of peace, of restoring peace to our
country."
