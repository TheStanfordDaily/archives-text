# Resistance intensifies in Poland
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland — A spread
ing pattern of resistance to
martial-law restrictions has
Polish authorities increasingly
worried. It promises to be a ma
jor point of argument between
competing factions of the
country's Communist Party
when its ruling Central Com
mittee meets, possibly next
week.
"In January there was
apathy; but now it appears that
resistance is on the rise," one
usually well-informed Com
munist Party source said.
The resistance ranges from
an increasingly active and so
phisticated underground press
to street demonstrations and
bombings. Some incidents
have been reported by the
tightly censored Polish media
but others have not.
Hard-liners in the leadership
are expected to use the inci

dents to argue that more re
pressive steps must be taken to
bring the crisis under control.
But others are reportedly argu
ing that the increasingly open
resistance to martial law, which
was imposed Dec. 13, only
proves that force cannot be a
long-term solution and that a
reopening of the dialogue with
different elements of Polish so
ciety is necessary.
Even in Warsaw, which has
been free of any large demon
strations since four days after
martial law was declared, the
authorities are obviously ner
vous. They have stepped up po
lice and military patrols on the
streets in recent days and vehi
cle searches — rare since mid-
December — are again com
mon as security forces try to
stem the flow of underground
literature and other forms of
protest.
A convoy of more than 200

police vehicles wound through
the city twice last weekend in
the biggest such show of force
since December. The official
press has acknowledged two
terrorist acts against property
in the capital in recent days
the bombing of a telephone
booth across from Communist
Party headquarters and a
Molotov cocktail attack on a
statue of Feliks Dzierzynski, the
Polish-Lithuanian founder of
the Soviet secret police, last
week.
Polish sources say that an un
reported bombing also oc
curred late last week across the
street from a government
house where party and martial
law chief, Gen. Wojciech
jaruzelski, the Polish primate,
Archbishop Jozef Glemp and
Solidarity independent union
leader Lech Walesa met in an
unprecedented three-way
summit last November.

After neighbors reported the
blast, a reporter discovered
about 30 feet of brick wall de
stroyed and a nearby police
guard booth damaged. It could
not be confirmed that the dam
age was the result of an ex
plosion.
The official news agency also
reported last Friday that there
had been "infringement of cer
tain martial-law regulations by
citizens of Swidnik" in eastern
Poland and that authorities had
imposed the country's most str
ingent curfew there — from 7
p.m. to 6 a.m. — as a result. But
the news item was followed im
mediately by another saying
the Swidnik report should be
disregarded.
According to one uncon
firmed report, the action fol
lowed a peaceful protest by
Swidnik residents in which
people crowded onto the
streets at 7:30 p.m. — the hour
for the main Polish television
news — and left their tele
visions turned on, facing the
streets from their apartment
windows.
