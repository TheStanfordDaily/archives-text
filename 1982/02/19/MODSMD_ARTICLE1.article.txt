# Agent identity bill sparks fire in D.C.

### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
In the wake of recent controversy
regarding the presence of in
telligence agents here and at other
universities across the country, the
U.S. Senate is preparing to vote on a
hill which may threaten to curtail dis
cussion of the matter in the future.
The Intelligence Identities Protec
tion Act, which would penalize ex
posure of covert agents, was passed
by the House of Representatives last
September by a margin of 354-56 and
has generated controversy between
those who assert the need for protec
ting the identities of foreign in
telligence agents and those who
charge that the bill is written too
broadly, threatening basic First
Amendment rights.
Spokespersons from each side
agree that the debate centers on the
actions of the Covert Action Informa
tion Bulletin, a Washington-based
publication which regularly exposes
covert agents of the CIA.
"The bill," said Dale Peterson, a
spokesperson for the CIA, "would
prevent organizations like the Covert
Action Information Bulletin which,
for no other reason than the release
of the names themselves, attempt to
identify CI A employees abroad."
Peterson claimed that the Bulletin
"jeopardizes our people abroad"
and that it "requires that we move
them" in order to ensure the safety of
identified agents.
However, spokespersons for the
Bulletin charged that the wording of
the bill would prohibit virtually any
disclosure of CIA information.
"The real target, it would seem, is
not just us," said Louis Wolf, a co-edi
tor and columnist for the Bulletin.

"It's anyone critical of a U.S. in
telligence agency.
"Clearly, we are the major critic of
the CIA and its operations around
the world," Wolf continued. "But
anyone who writes a story or does a
report pertaining to intelligence is
likely to fall under this bill, and that
would include academicians, his
torians or anyone else."
The strange course taken by the
bill on its way to the Senate floor tells
a great deal about the nature of the
legislative battle. Amendments in
both houses of Congress have re
sulted in a reversal of the wording of
each version of the bill.
Introduced by Rep. Edward Boland
(D-Mass.) in the House, the bill ori
ginally was drafted to apply to any
one "in the course of an effort to
identify and expose covert agents
with the intent to impair or impede
the foreign intelligence activities of
the United States by the fact of such
identification and exposure."
Before passing the House, how
ever, Boland's version was amended
on the floor by Rep. John Ashbrook
(R-Ohio) to apply to anyone "in the
course of a pattern of activities in
tended to identify and expose covert
agents and with reason to believe
that such activities would impair and
impede the foreign intelligence of
the United States.. .."
Following Sen. John Chafee's (R-
R. 1.) introduction of the amended
House bill to the Senate, the Senate
judiciary Committee amended the
bill to conform to Rep. Boland's ori
ginal House bill in legislation offered
by Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.).
