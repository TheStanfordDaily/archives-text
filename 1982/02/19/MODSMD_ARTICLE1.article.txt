# Agent identity bill sparks fire in D.C.
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
In the wake of recent controversy
regarding the presence of in
telligence agents here and at other
universities across the country, the
U.S. Senate is preparing to vote on a
hill which may threaten to curtail dis
cussion of the matter in the future.
The Intelligence Identities Protec
tion Act, which would penalize ex
posure of covert agents, was passed
by the House of Representatives last
September by a margin of 354-56 and
has generated controversy between
those who assert the need for protec
ting the identities of foreign in
telligence agents and those who
charge that the bill is written too
broadly, threatening basic First
Amendment rights.
Spokespersons from each side
agree that the debate centers on the
actions of the Covert Action Informa
tion Bulletin, a Washington-based
publication which regularly exposes
covert agents of the CIA.
"The bill," said Dale Peterson, a
spokesperson for the CIA, "would
prevent organizations like the Covert
Action Information Bulletin which,
for no other reason than the release
of the names themselves, attempt to
identify CI A employees abroad."
Peterson claimed that the Bulletin
"jeopardizes our people abroad"
and that it "requires that we move
them" in order to ensure the safety of
identified agents.
However, spokespersons for the
Bulletin charged that the wording of
the bill would prohibit virtually any
disclosure of CIA information.
"The real target, it would seem, is
not just us," said Louis Wolf, a co-edi
tor and columnist for the Bulletin.

"It's anyone critical of a U.S. in
telligence agency.
"Clearly, we are the major critic of
the CIA and its operations around
the world," Wolf continued. "But
anyone who writes a story or does a
report pertaining to intelligence is
likely to fall under this bill, and that
would include academicians, his
torians or anyone else."
The strange course taken by the
bill on its way to the Senate floor tells
a great deal about the nature of the
legislative battle. Amendments in
both houses of Congress have re
sulted in a reversal of the wording of
each version of the bill.
Introduced by Rep. Edward Boland
(D-Mass.) in the House, the bill ori
ginally was drafted to apply to any
one "in the course of an effort to
identify and expose covert agents
with the intent to impair or impede
the foreign intelligence activities of
the United States by the fact of such
identification and exposure."
Before passing the House, how
ever, Boland's version was amended
on the floor by Rep. John Ashbrook
(R-Ohio) to apply to anyone "in the
course of a pattern of activities in
tended to identify and expose covert
agents and with reason to believe
that such activities would impair and
impede the foreign intelligence of
the United States.. .."
Following Sen. John Chafee's (R-
R. 1.) introduction of the amended
House bill to the Senate, the Senate
judiciary Committee amended the
bill to conform to Rep. Boland's ori
ginal House bill in legislation offered
by Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.).
The distinction between the two
wordings is important in determining
the burden of proof required to con
vict an individual under the Act.
The wording of the Boland version
(which is now the amended Senate
version) would force a prosecutor to
prove "intent to impair or impede"
on the part of the defendant, where
as the version passed by the House
requires only proof that the defen
dant had "reason to believe that such
activities would impair or impede"
American intelligence activities.
The battle between the CIA and
members of the Bulletin staff reaches
back to 1974 when Philip Agee, a
member of the Bulletin board of ad
visers and a former CIA agent, pub
lished his journal of experiences
working for the Agency. Since that
time Agee and others with the Bullet
in have continued to publish books
and magazines exposing CIA agents
and operations.
"Our position is that their activities
are criminal," said Ken Lawrence, a
columnist and member of the Bullet
in board of advisers. "If they weren't,
there would be no reason to keep
them secret. They're violating laws of
other countries as well as our own."
According to Lawrence, "The very
secrecy that protects them en
courages them to engage in activities
that no civilized country can approve
of or condone."
However, Spencer Davis, spokes
person for the Senate Intelligence

Committee, said that the Bulletin's
activities provoked the legislation.
"The Covert Action Information
Bulletin is conducting a war of its
own against the CIA," Davis said.
"We're trying to find some way of
handling their wholesale identi
fication of intelligence agents and
still abide by the First Amendment."
"It's incomprehensible," he con
tinued, "that lives of agents abroad
can continue to be jeopardized by
Americans who remain free from
prosecution."
Professor Hubert Marshall, a mem
ber of the political science depart
ment here, was asked yesterday for
his opinion on the controversial bill.
Without commenting on the specific
language of either version of the bill,
Marshall was critical of limitations
placed on journalists that could pre
vent them from exposing gov
ernmental wrongdoings.
"I think this would be a clear limi
tation on journalistic freedom,"
Marshall said. "We tend to forget the
lesson of the American Revolution
that our own government can be our
own worst enemy."
Marshall cited illegal actions taken
by the FBI against Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr. and the Socialist Workers
Party in separate instances in the '60s
as examples of this.
"Is the need for this kind of activity
so great that we want to risk our own
freedoms?" he asked.
"We can't vindicate our First
Amendment if the press can't expose
what's going on. And I don't see how
journalists can do that without expos
ing names."
