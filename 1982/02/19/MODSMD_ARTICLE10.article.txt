# Child abuse: national problem hits home hard
## 
### Chitra Subramaniam 
American parents kick, punch, or bite as
many as 1,700,000 children a year, beat up
460,000 more, and attack 46,000 with knives
or guns. Some 2.3 million children wield a
knife or gun against a brother or sister.
Contained in a U.S. government report,
these statistics and more are gaining promi
nence as it is becoming increasingly clear
that a majority of criminals in society have
been abused as children. A study of violent
inmates in San Quentin Prison revealed that
100 percent of them were victims of child
abuse between the ages of one and 10.
"There is obviously a direct correlation be
tween child abuse and criminal behavior,
and children who are abused when they are
young, in turn perpetuate it when they
grow," said Officer Armand Lareau of the
Menlo Park Police Department. "The ugly

thing about child abuse is that all the hurt,
pain, and neglect is interpreted by the child
to be a sign of love," Lareau said.
Two common myths dominate notions
about child abuse. One, that it is a feature of
the lower socio-economic classes, and two,
that neglect and abandonment do not con
stitute abuse. "It is very important for people
to realize that child abuse does not necessar
ily involve physical violence — often it is
gross neglect," Lareau said.
That child abuse is not uncommon among
the highly educated is borne out by the fact
that Escondido Village has its share of prob
lems concerning child abuse. "The most
common kind of abuse that exists here is
neglect or abandonment," said Jan Marx, di
rector of Escondido Village and assistant
dean of student affairs. According to Marx,
there have been instances where parents in

the village lock up their children in rooms all
day just because they want to study. "Also,
there are times when a 7-year-old is left in
charge of a 5-year-old, and that can be dan
gerous," said Marx.
Statistically, the abusers are described as
young. Reported median ages for abusive
mothers is 22.5 years and for fathers 25.2
years. "Coping with the pressures of school
work can come in the way of good parent
ing, especially during increased academic
activity, and I would advise parents to seek
help," Marx said.
"Every parent has the potential to abuse a
child sometime, and in fact, they are the
most frequent child abusers," said Lareau.
"Most parents think it is their right to beat
their child."
The necessity of addressing child abuse is
clearly established by the fact that the three

police departments of Menlo Park, Palo Alto
and Atherton are currently engaged in an
awareness program to educate the surroun
ding communities about the issue of child
abuse.
"There are people who stick their child's
hand on a stove or dip it into hot water —
something has to be done to stop that and
we encourage people to report such oc
currences," said Jerry McNamara, Chief of
Police in Menlo Park. Marx agrees that peo
ple have a legal obligation to report any kind
of abuse, be it abandonment or physical vio
lence. "What is abuse in one culture, does
not meant the same thing in another part of
the world, and neighbors in Escondido Vil
lage could be constrained by that," ex
plained Marx.
Police officers are now trained to look for
any signs, overt or otherwise, of child abuse.

"But, there are always gray areas when we do
not know if it is abuse or not, and that can be
really difficult — especially when it is not a
case of physical violence, but more of aban
donment or neglect," said officer Corey
White of the Menlo Park Police Department.
In Escondido Village, the problem is com
pounded by the fact that there is inadequacy
of day-care centers. "There is a great need
for places where parents can leave their chil
dren while they are at school,"said ~
Namkari M'Sangi, a neighborhood coordi
nator at the village. According to M'Sangi,
many women have had to give up their jobs
because their is no place to leave their chil
dren, and baby-sitters are too expensive.
"I really have no idea of the scope of the
problem in the village," said Marx, "but I
know that it exists, and I am willing to take it
up with the concerned people."

lems concerning child abuse. "The most
common kind of abuse that exists here is
neglect or abandonment," said Jan Marx, di
rector of Escondido Village and assistant
dean of student affairs. According to Marx,
there have been instances where parents in

the village lock up their children in rooms all
day just because they want to study. "Also,
there are times when a 7-year-old is left in
charge of a 5-year-old, and that can be dan
gerous," said Marx.
Statistically, the abusers are described as
young. Reported median ages for abusive
mothers is 22.5 years and for fathers 25.2
years. "Coping with the pressures of school
work can come in the way of good parent
ing, especially during increased academic
activity, and I would advise parents to seek
help," Marx said.
"Every parent has the potential to abuse a
child sometime, and in fact, they are the
most frequent child abusers," said Lareau.
"Most parents think it is their right to beat
their child."
The necessity of addressing child abuse is
clearly established by the fact that the three

police departments of Menlo Park, Palo Alto
and Atherton are currently engaged in an
awareness program to educate the surroun
ding communities about the issue of child
abuse.
"There are people who stick their child's
hand on a stove or dip it into hot water —
something has to be done to stop that and
we encourage people to report such oc
currences," said Jerry McNamara, Chief of
Police in Menlo Park. Marx agrees that peo
ple have a legal obligation to report any kind
of abuse, be it abandonment or physical vio
lence. "What is abuse in one culture, does
not meant the same thing in another part of
the world, and neighbors in Escondido Vil
lage could be constrained by that," ex
plained Marx.
Police officers are now trained to look for
any signs, overt or otherwise, of child abuse.

"But, there are always gray areas when we do
not know if it is abuse or not, and that can be
really difficult — especially when it is not a
case of physical violence, but more of aban
donment or neglect," said officer Corey
White of the Menlo Park Police Department.
In Escondido Village, the problem is com
pounded by the fact that there is inadequacy
of day-care centers. "There is a great need
for places where parents can leave their chil
dren while they are at school,"said ~
Namkari M'Sangi, a neighborhood coordi
nator at the village. According to M'Sangi,
many women have had to give up their jobs
because their is no place to leave their chil
dren, and baby-sitters are too expensive.
"I really have no idea of the scope of the
problem in the village," said Marx, "but I
know that it exists, and I am willing to take it
up with the concerned people."
American parents kick, punch, or bite as
many as 1,700,000 children a year, beat up
460,000 more, and attack 46,000 with knives
or guns. Some 2.3 million children wield a
knife or gun against a brother or sister.
Contained in a U.S. government report,
these statistics and more are gaining promi
nence as it is becoming increasingly clear
that a majority of criminals in society have
been abused as children. A study of violent
inmates in San Quentin Prison revealed that
100 percent of them were victims of child
abuse between the ages of one and 10.
"There is obviously a direct correlation be
tween child abuse and criminal behavior,
and children who are abused when they are
young, in turn perpetuate it when they
grow," said Officer Armand Lareau of the
Menlo Park Police Department. "The ugly

thing about child abuse is that all the hurt,
pain, and neglect is interpreted by the child
to be a sign of love," Lareau said.
Two common myths dominate notions
about child abuse. One, that it is a feature of
the lower socio-economic classes, and two,
that neglect and abandonment do not con
stitute abuse. "It is very important for people
to realize that child abuse does not necessar
ily involve physical violence — often it is
gross neglect," Lareau said.
That child abuse is not uncommon among
the highly educated is borne out by the fact
that Escondido Village has its share of prob
lems concerning child abuse. "The most
common kind of abuse that exists here is
neglect or abandonment," said Jan Marx, di
