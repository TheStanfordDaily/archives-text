"Is it Wednesday yet?" Stanford students may be more
concerned with the arrival of the weekend and its con
comitant parties, but this is the question on the lips of Bill
Griffith's popular cartoon creation, "Zippy the

Pinhead." Zippy is the ultimate amalgamation of the in
sane, moronic, absurd and hilarious. Over the last dec
ade he has grown into a major comic figure, accruing a
large following, and next week he and Griffith are com

ing to Stanford to tell all about it thanks to the efforts of
the ASSU Guest Professorship Board.
Zippy began as a one-shot idea back in 1970. Griffith
said, "I imagined what fun it would be to put this
pinhead guy in a comic romance situation." So, Zippy

'/ got my start in comics back in
1968 in New York City working on
several underground
newspapers/

appeared as a sidekick of Mr. Toad â€” Griffith's first real
comic book character. "As Toad was a real mean, bad
guy type and Zippy was spaced out and innocent, they
made a great pair." Ultimately, Zippy began to develop
and come into his own right, and phased Toad out of the
picture. "I don't know," Griffith quipped about his in
creasing concerns with pinheads, "what that has to say
about my own personal development."
Griffith offered a plausible explanation for the success
and popularity of Zippy. "Ever since 1973, Zippy started
developing into my favorite character because he is so
adaptable; by his nature he can be put into virtually any
situation." Most artists are limited in scope by the type of
character they use. For example, a detective character
can only be put in a detective story, and so forth. The
greatest attribute of Zippy is that he is "consistently in
consistent," and is effective in any context.
Among many popular rivals, Zippy ranks high in the
minds of cartoon lovers; indeed,remarked Luke Cole,
Guest Professorship Board member, "Zippy is a personal
favorite of mine and of many others." At first it is hard to
see why a pinhead character is so popular. Noone wants
to identify himself as a pinhead, no matter how densely
populated Meyer Library can get on a Saturday night.

Perhaps it is because we all have a subconscious fear of
"pinhead-dom" that we find Zippy humor so funny.
Freshman Jaime Arroyo keeps a Zippy the Pinhead

poster on his wall to "remind myself to get my nose out
of my books once in a while!"
"I got my start in comics back in 1968 in New York City
working on several underground newspapers," Griffith
reminisced. Those publications included The East Village
Other and the Berkeley Barb, which he called, "the quin

tessential underground newspaper." A few years later he
came out to the Bay Area because, in his opinion, "that's
where all cartoonists were focusing their attention."
Griffith made the transition to comic books with the
creation of "Young Lust," a romance series, and
"Tales of Toad," the protagonist of which was to play
such an instrumental role in the birth of Zippy.
While cartooning is Griffith's major interest, his work
does branch out to related fields. He has been asked to
do calendars, a Zippy videogame, and haseven been ap
proached by some "Hollywood types" on the prospect
of a Zippy movie. Griffith said that in the future he'd like
to get out of strictly comic books and into real books. He
already has one paperback out; a second is soon to fol
low.
While many students are as yet unfamiliar with Zippy,
those that know him seem to love him. Cole said Griffith
was chosen because he has "an amazing cult following
here on campus." Stanford students are more used to

'Many artists have done great
work yet have been completely
forgotten/

seeing authors, scientists, and other comparitively
straight-laced intellectuals as speakers, so Griffith could
be a refreshing change of pace. His cartoons are said to
contain the genius or social comment found in a book or
discourse, but in a mode of expression that is perhaps
easier to empathize with.
Griffith will be coming to Stanford on Monday, Feb.
22. His visit begins with a lecture and slide show on Mon
day at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley 133. The following day
there will be scheduled informal sherry hours as well as a
comic workshop in the Art Building (Rm. 2) at 2:30 p.m.
During the lecture and slide show he will give at Stan
ford, Griffith will give his view of the history of comics,
focusing on his favorites. He believes that "Many artists
have done great work yet have been completely for
gotten," so he will attempt to "show students that there's
so much more to comics than what they see from day to
day in the papers."
