## Editorial Voters deserve refunds 
### 
We urge the ASSU Senate, in its current
overhaul of the fee assessment process, to
maintain the best part of the system — its
voluntary nature. Mandatory fee assessments
would deprive students of their rightful choice.
In addition, mandatory assessments would
force too many arbitrary decisionson whatever
body is designated to oversee the election
process. It would probably require either giving
every group whose name appeared on the
ballot a full assessment, or setting an arbitrary
maximum numberof groups whocould receive
assessments. Either way, the choice would be
taken away from the students.
Without mandatory assessments, though, the
problem of enormous, unpredictable refunds
remains. This quarter more students collected
refunds than voted in either the special election
fall quarterorthe regularelection last spring.
And notvotingatall maystill harma groupmore
than voting no.
One solution istoallowonlystudents who
have voted in the election to collect refunds.
This would make the assessment allocation
reflect students' desires more accurately by
changing the implication of non-votes. Students
opposed to funding a group could vote against it
in the election and, if trie groups' assessment
passed, could then receive a refund. Students
who did not voice their opinion initially in the
election would not be able to reclaim their
money.
We believe this is an effective remedy to the
current situation because it removesthe
desirability of not voting. The new requirement
should helpalleviatethe problem of a less
than-20-percent voter turnout by creating an
incentive tovote.
Another benefit of thissystem will be to help
legitimize the winning groups because their
support, from yes- and non-voters, will have

decidedly outweighed the opposition. To
receive an assessment in the present system,
each group must have 20 percentof the student
body voteon its assessment and a majority of the
votes cast must be positive. Thus opponents of
the group have the option of not voting in hopes
of denying the group the minimum 20 percent
voter turnout needed. The outcome therefore is
not certain to reflect the opinion of the majority
of thestudents.
The proposed system will help legitimizethe
groups receiving assessments because
presumably the yes-voters and the non-voters
support the group, vocally and tacitly and
therefore the only opposition is reflected in the
no votes.
Smaller groups who do not believe they have
the necessary support, or do not need an entire
assessment, still nave the option of applying to
be included in the Program Fee assessment. This
usually includes about 30 groups and is a three
quarter assessment.
Granted, this proposed system will involve
some extra paperwork — compiling a master list
of voters, exempting freshmen and transfer
students from the vote-to-collect-refund
requirement — but the increased fairnessof the
system will warrant thlese additional efforts.
By retaining the ability to collect refunds and
by making voting a prerequisite to claiming
those refunds, the system will be greatly
improved. Students will not be forced to fund
groups but at the same time will be forcedto
take some resonsibility forthe funding by
casting their votes.
