## Working for equal education 
### 
Consistent with its leadership in
education, Stanford is launching a
major study called Stanford and the
Schools. The study promises to ex
amine many aspects of America's
education system and will include a
special look at Stanford's role in train
ing teachers. In anticipation of this
study, two areas stand out in my mind
as needing consideration in teacher
training: 1) a general concern with
focus on the application of research
findings to issues in education, and 2)
a specific concern for dealing with
urgent social issues such as the con
tinued inequality in the education of
black and white children.
Schools of education, like other
professional graduate schools, in
cluding medicine and engineering,
must constantly seek a balance be
tween their orientation towards re
search and the demand that they
train the practitioners. Medical and
engineering schools attract students
not only for the later monetary re
wards that their training programs as
sure, but because of their association
with research.
The research-practice link is im
portant in engineering and medical
schools. Why should it not be in
education? To help increase the at
tractiveness of teaching as a career
for young people, I suggest that
those of us in schools of education
identify issues in education, draw
from the research files and act on the
issues.
One such issue is inequality in
education as shown by the dis
crepancy in achievement test scores
of black and white children. Since

the emancipation of slaves over a
century ago, unequal access to the
educational tools necessary to suc
ceed in American society standsasan
issue the American schools of educa
tion should confront as medical
schools confront the mystery of
cancer.
In 1965, James Coleman showed
that achievement scores of black
children were considerably lower
than those of white children. By 1975,
a Dept. of Health, Education and
Welfare report gave similar, if not
more dismal, results and proof of dif
ferential preparation of young peo
ple for American society. There is no
reason to believe that there will be a
dramatic change by 1985.
Differential preparation is a prob
lem for American education. It fol
lows that if it is education's problem,
then certainly talk of it should be
buzzing in the halls of schools of
education. For schools of education
to make their imprint on the problem
— as graduating masters students in
electrical engineering take with
them the latest ideas in microchips —
teacher training programs must pre
pare their students to confront the is
sue.
As UCLA's Dean of Education John
Goodlad said during a recent talk at
Stanford, teacher training must be
sufficient to transcend the teaching
experience. In other words, each
graduating class should be prepared
to improve upon the existing system.
In the context of the example of the
continuing discrepancy between

black and white education, the
NAACP's Director of Education Pro
grams Beverly Cole points out that
teachers must be "trained in multi
ethnic education/relations with
more inner city student teaching ex
periences." Her suggestion is a step
toward transcending the past.
Let's contribute to improving
American society. In our leading
teacher education program at Stan
ford, we need to identify issues and
act so that a new generation of teach
ers can deal with these issues. In the
Stanford study, we must recognize
the differential education of black
and white children.
But we can not stop at recognition.
We must continue with a program
that does not accept the racist theo
ries of accepted inequality that have
accompanied African-American's
362 year presence in America. Let's
train teachers to expect a just system
of education and to work for equal
education access when they don't
find such a system.
