## Budget cuts block escape 
### 
Paul Baer (Daily, Feb. 16) eloquent
ly pointed out the sorry effects the
Reagan budget cuts have on the abili
ty of less-than-affluent students to at
tend Ivy-league schools. These cuts
will have even more severe conse
quences for low-income students
who simply want a college educa
tion.
As of next September, the children
of widowed or disabled parents will
lose their educational benefits under
Social Security. The loss of these ben
efits, combined withothercutsinaid
to higher education, will mean that
tens of thousands of high school
graduates won't even be able to af
ford public universities and colleges.
In the past such schools have enabled
untold numbers of poor but am
bitious people to escape into the
middle class.
Last year 940,000 college students
received payments averaging $207 a
months because of the death, dis
ability, or retirement of their parents.
According to the financial writer Syl
via Porter, more than half of these
students came from families with an
nual incomes of $8000 or less; 84 per
cent had annual incomes under
$20,000.
Under the Reagan administration,
public funds are being massively
transferred from human services to
the arms industry and its clients here
and abroad. The result will not only
be hungrier children, neglected old
people and the deterioration of pub
lic amenities, but greater barriers to
social mobility. The cuts in education
will means quite simply that the poor
will have less chance than ever to es
cape their poverty.
