## Assess fees at registration? 
### 
The ASSU Senate has concluded
that refundable fee assessments have
failed and that some type of man
datory fee is therefore necessary. We
disagree.
It is argued that most other univer
sities have mandatory student fees.
So what? Most nations violate the
rights of their citizens, but that's cer
tainly no justification for the U.S.
government to do likewise. A very
rare thing is often a very good thing.
The ASSU Finance Committee re
port complains, "It is expensive and
awkward for us to give refunds."
There is no mention of the discom
fort endured by students who wait in
long lines to reclaim their own mon
ey. Further, the report states, "A
large number of complaints we re
ceive concern the refundability of
assessments." Certainly, any group
expecting to receive approximately
$12,000 in other people's money in
return for their time gathering signa
tures would be indignant at the sud
den loss of its recent riches. Of
course the organizations would find
it easier if they could take our money
without allowing us the option of
getting it back. That's how a thief op
erates.
The present system, cumbersome
as it is, does force each organization
to be accountable to the entire stu

dent body (at election time) and to
each student (at refund time). Under
the mandatory fee proposal of the
Senate, each student will be forced to
pay a specific sum of money. The stu
dent will be allowed to direct this
money to the organizations of
his/her choice. Funds not specifically
allocated by the student or funds in
excess of a group's request revert to

Simple isn't it?
Consider the
advantages. There
would be no need for
elections. There
would be no need for
refunds.

the ASSU. With these excess funds,
the ASSU could bail out unpopular
groups which could not get the mon
ey under free student choice.
And who would determine the
amount of the mandatory fee? The
Finance Committee report does not
address this question. Imagine
twelve thousand students attempting
to agree on an acceptable level of
"dorm dues" and you will see the im
practicability of the Senate proposal.
We offer the following coun
terproposal, fully realizing that it is

probably too sensible to be adopted
(but you never know):
Make fee assessments part of the
registration process. Each student
may designate one dollar to each or
ganization he wishes to support. The
cashier adds the assessment amount
to the student's bill. The money then
goes to the ASSU and is divided ac
cording to student choices.
Simple, isn't it? Consider the ad
vantages. There would be no need
for elections. There would be no
need for refunds. Each student re
tains complete control over his mon
ey and it's no more difficult to admin
ister than the mandatory allocation
scheme. Groups desiring money may
publicize their need during regis
tration.
One may argue that in a totally vol
untary system no organization will be
able to raise a significant amount of
money. Certainly any organization
that provides something students tru
ly value has nothing to fear. An or
ganization that does not provide val
ue does not deserve student funds.
And that, we submit, is the whole
point.
