## El Salvador: A liberal's approach 
### 
I am bored with the liberal argument against American
military involvement in El Salvador. Bored, because it re
lies on appeals that have proved ineffective in the many
debates that have surrounded U.S. support of military
juntas all over the world since World War 11. In the typical
debate, liberals oppose military aid to an authoritarian
status quo government on moral and ideological
grounds. The conservatives base their appeals on prag
matic concerns. The conservatives win. The time has
come for liberals to start arguing the practicality of mo
rality.
The liberal line is relatively simple. The forces of de
mocracy deserve our support, and the serious and wide
spread violations of human rights necessary to resist
these forces of change need to be repudiated. Conserva
tives justify the curtailment of personal liberties in these
regimes as a necessary evil in the short run in order to
avoid the greater evil of a communist takeover. Un
fortunately, there seems to be no end in sight for the
short run.
To be sure, most Americans believe in the goodness of
the free-enterprise system and view Marxist-Leninist
government to be antithetical to democracy. I find it
doubtful, however, that such altruistic concerns for the
plight of other people would be enough to justify the
cost to the United States of opposing communism wher
ever it rears its ugly red little head.
No, the conservative argument draws its strength from
concerns for the military and economic security of the
United States and so must the liberal argument if it is to
stand a chance.
Change is coming to Central America. At first, the
news was dominated by Nicaragua, with occasional clips
making their way to the back page about another small
country called El Salvador. Now, the Sandinistas control
Nicaragua, a war rages in El Salvador and items in the
news about unrest in Guatemala seem to be increasing in
both frequency and importance. Because of its unique
position of both military and economic strength, the
United States has the power to influence, somewhat, the
form that that change will take.
We can resist the change through a futile exercise of
our military might and thereby radicalize the emerging
popular front movements. Then, after the dust settles
and the last shot has been fired, the alienation from the
United States of those in control of the rebel forces will
be complete. This course has been tried and has failed.
Its failure is rooted in the inherent difficulty of suppress
ing opposition movements which command both the
idealism and the sense of self-interest of a broad seg
ment of the society.
Suppression of such movements requires the sort of
war in which civilian casualities are high and the country
must often be devasted to be preserved: a war for which
the American people, luckily, seem to have little stom
ach.
Unless we are willing to conduct such a war, we have
no business getting involved in opposing the force for
popular change in Central America.
The alternative to military resistance is to acquiesce to
the forces of change and use our economic power to

weld an alliance of interests between the new govern
ment and the United States that would preclude the pos
sibility of an extension of the Soviet strategic threat. Such
a suggestion makes certain assumptions about the na
ture of the ruling party of the newly formed government.
It assumes a new government which the United States
has not antagonized beyond remedy through a pro
longed support of their former oppressors. It assumes a
government which hasn't been driven into the maw of
the "Soviet Bear" subsequent to independence by a bat
tery of U.S. diplomatic and economic sanctions.
The alternative does not assume, however, that the
new government be an ardent fan of the free enterprise
system. What if the new government proves to be "com
munist"? Much of my argument may be encapsulized in
two small words: so what? Being communist or Demo
cratic-Socialist, as is the case of many of the El Salvadoran
rebels and, incidentally, of many pro-American Europe
ans as well, does not necessarily mean their inclusion in
the Soviet bloc. Witness China. It also does not mean
their closure to Western trade. Witness Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.
Being communist would only make Central America a
danger to the United States if they sought to join Cuba in
military alliance with the Soviet Union. I see no reason to
believe that a country which had just broken free from
one master would look around for another. Moreover, I
contend that the United States is in an excellent position
to prevent this from occurring. The first concern of any
government is to feed its people. Failing this, another
revolution is sure to follow. Which country has more to
offer a poor, underdeveloped nation in terms of mar
kets, technology and aid — the Soviet Union orthe Unit
ed States? If we succeed in binding the new governments
to us economically, then I don't think we'll have any
thing to worry about militarily.
We can't "out-oppress" the Soviets. We got out of
Vietnam and they're staying in Afghanistan. We can out
trade and "out-aid" them, however. All we need to do is
relinquish our Cold War assumptions about an "Interna
tional Communist Conspiracy" and allow ourselves to
see the popular front movements of Central America for
what they really are: they are not eager applicants for en
try into the Soviet bloc but groups trying to create a de
cent way of life any way they can.

government to be antithetical to democracy. I find it
doubtful, however, that such altruistic concerns for the
plight of other people would be enough to justify the
cost to the United States of opposing communism wher
ever it rears its ugly red little head.
No, the conservative argument draws its strength from
concerns for the military and economic security of the
United States and so must the liberal argument if it is to
stand a chance.
Change is coming to Central America. At first, the
news was dominated by Nicaragua, with occasional clips
making their way to the back page about another small
country called El Salvador. Now, the Sandinistas control
Nicaragua, a war rages in El Salvador and items in the
news about unrest in Guatemala seem to be increasing in
both frequency and importance. Because of its unique
position of both military and economic strength, the
United States has the power to influence, somewhat, the
form that that change will take.
We can resist the change through a futile exercise of
our military might and thereby radicalize the emerging
popular front movements. Then, after the dust settles
and the last shot has been fired, the alienation from the
United States of those in control of the rebel forces will
be complete. This course has been tried and has failed.
Its failure is rooted in the inherent difficulty of suppress
ing opposition movements which command both the
idealism and the sense of self-interest of a broad seg
ment of the society.
Suppression of such movements requires the sort of
war in which civilian casualities are high and the country
must often be devasted to be preserved: a war for which
the American people, luckily, seem to have little stom
ach.
Unless we are willing to conduct such a war, we have
no business getting involved in opposing the force for
popular change in Central America.
The alternative to military resistance is to acquiesce to
the forces of change and use our economic power to

weld an alliance of interests between the new govern
ment and the United States that would preclude the pos
sibility of an extension of the Soviet strategic threat. Such
a suggestion makes certain assumptions about the na
ture of the ruling party of the newly formed government.
It assumes a new government which the United States
has not antagonized beyond remedy through a pro
longed support of their former oppressors. It assumes a
government which hasn't been driven into the maw of
the "Soviet Bear" subsequent to independence by a bat
tery of U.S. diplomatic and economic sanctions.
The alternative does not assume, however, that the
new government be an ardent fan of the free enterprise
system. What if the new government proves to be "com
munist"? Much of my argument may be encapsulized in
two small words: so what? Being communist or Demo
cratic-Socialist, as is the case of many of the El Salvadoran
rebels and, incidentally, of many pro-American Europe
ans as well, does not necessarily mean their inclusion in
the Soviet bloc. Witness China. It also does not mean
their closure to Western trade. Witness Eastern Europe
and the Soviet Union.
Being communist would only make Central America a
danger to the United States if they sought to join Cuba in
military alliance with the Soviet Union. I see no reason to
believe that a country which had just broken free from
one master would look around for another. Moreover, I
contend that the United States is in an excellent position
to prevent this from occurring. The first concern of any
government is to feed its people. Failing this, another
revolution is sure to follow. Which country has more to
offer a poor, underdeveloped nation in terms of mar
kets, technology and aid — the Soviet Union orthe Unit
ed States? If we succeed in binding the new governments
to us economically, then I don't think we'll have any
thing to worry about militarily.
We can't "out-oppress" the Soviets. We got out of
Vietnam and they're staying in Afghanistan. We can out
trade and "out-aid" them, however. All we need to do is
relinquish our Cold War assumptions about an "Interna
tional Communist Conspiracy" and allow ourselves to
see the popular front movements of Central America for
what they really are: they are not eager applicants for en
try into the Soviet bloc but groups trying to create a de
cent way of life any way they can.

I am bored with the liberal argument against American
military involvement in El Salvador. Bored, because it re
lies on appeals that have proved ineffective in the many
debates that have surrounded U.S. support of military
juntas all over the world since World War 11. In the typical
debate, liberals oppose military aid to an authoritarian
status quo government on moral and ideological
grounds. The conservatives base their appeals on prag
matic concerns. The conservatives win. The time has
come for liberals to start arguing the practicality of mo
rality.
The liberal line is relatively simple. The forces of de
mocracy deserve our support, and the serious and wide
spread violations of human rights necessary to resist
these forces of change need to be repudiated. Conserva
tives justify the curtailment of personal liberties in these
regimes as a necessary evil in the short run in order to
avoid the greater evil of a communist takeover. Un
fortunately, there seems to be no end in sight for the
short run.
