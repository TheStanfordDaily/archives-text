### Sarah Carrel 
Junior forward Meg Metzger
scored a career-high 32 points
as Stanford overwhelmed the
University of Pacific Lady Tigers
91-68 in women's basketball
Wednesday night.
Behind Metzger and senior
Louise Smith's 15 points, Stan
ford shattered UOP's full-court
press and shot .672 percent
from the field — a Stanford and
Maples Pavilion record.
Stanford played without for
ward Jeanne Ruark Hoff, out
with a sprained ankle, and
guard Noel Hanrahan, out with
a broken nose.
Last Saturday night the wom
en chalked uptheirsecond win
over Santa Clara 62-53, after
beating them previously 73-70.
Led by the nation's top re
bounder, 6-2 Liz Bruno, Santa
Clara held a slight lead in the
first half. In the second half, a
fast break to Debi Gore put the
Cardinal in the lead.
With the shooting of high
scoring forwards Metzger — 22
points — and Ruark Hoff — 11
points and the outstanding de
fensive play of Angie Paccione,
Stanford widened its lead in
the final six minutes.
"Coming off the bench,"
Paccione said, "I have to be the
spark plug. That's my role."
Head coach Dotty McCrea
was pleased with her team's
play in the second half.
"During the last six minutes,
we boxed out where we
weren't able to before,"
McCrea said. "We couldn't let
a team at the bottom of the
league beat us. We want to be
winners."
Point guard Debi Gore has
been a starter for four years
an#holds the Stanford all-time

record for assists with 375 and
set the single-season mark with
120 assists this year.
Gore said the team has be
come "like a family to her. This
has been a growing team."
Guard Anne Miller, billed as
one of the fastest players in the
conference, will also be sorely
missed. Miller has scored 658
career points at the Farm and
agrees with Gore on the im
provement the team has made.
"It's been exciting to see the
improvement of this whole
team," Miller said.
Smith leaves Stanford with
1354 career points and as a first
team All-Conference player.
She holds the Stanford record
with a .784 free throw per
centage mark.
"It's very exciting to be fin
ishing on the best team of my
four years."
Senior guard Paccione with
715 career points, has another
year of eligibility.
