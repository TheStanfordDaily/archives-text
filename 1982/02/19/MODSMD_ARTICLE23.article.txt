# USC tonight
## Card travels south 
### Mike Oneal 
Writing a lead paragraph
about the Cardinal men's
basketball team has become
almost as difficult as finding a
parking place within a 10 mile
radius of theQuad.
The lead is supposed to be
witty and original while sum
ming up the main points of the
story. But the story remains the
same week after week and
there has been nothing witty
about this year's campaign.
Losing isn't funny.
All the team can shoot for
anymore is an upset. As senior
guard Doug Marty said last
week, "We just want to play as
good as ever. We don't have

anything to lose."
That attitude almost paid off
last Saturday in Maples Pavilion
when Stanford came a fluke
shot away from beating then
nationally N0.19 ranked Wash
ington. Huskie guard Steve
Burks popped a 18-foot shot at
the buzzer to beat the Cardinal
53-52. Stanford played one of
its best games of the season,
posting a season-low 10 turn
overs, but like a number of
games this season almost
wasn't enough, and the team
dropped its tenth decision in 11
outings.
"We played well enough to
win," head coach Dick Dißiaso,
who resigned two weeks ago,
said. "It was a sustained team
effort for us, an effort worthy of
a better outcome. Our ball
handling was good and our de
fensive intensity kept us in the
game. Although we didn't win,
I feel better about our team as
we travel south this weekend."
The problem is that Stanford
is still tied with \rizona for last
place in the Pac-10. The
Cardinal is 2-11 in the con
ference and 7-15 overall. The

team is on a school record-set
ting pace in shooting per
centage at .495 and is second in
the Pac-10 only to Arizona
State in free throws with a .733
average but the real excite
ment for Stanford basketball
fans was lost long ago.
Stanford takes its underdog
show to Los Angeles this week
end to face the University of
Southern California tonight at
8 p.m. and UCLA tomorrow at
noon. UCLA and USC are
ranked third and fourth in the

conference respectively.
The Trojan threat can be
summed up in one name —
Dwight Anderson. Anderson, a
6-3 senior guard, could be the
most explosive player in the
league if not the country. He's
the second leading scorer in
the conference behind UC-
Berkeley's Mark McNamara
with a 21.0 average and grabs
four rebounds a game. When
USC blew Stanford away in
Maples last month 85-74, An
derson devastated the Cardinal

defense with 26 points and five
assists.
But USC has been flounder
ing somewhat in the last four
games, losing three and barely
pulling out one 60-59 against
Arizona. The Trojans started
out 7-1 in the conference,
though, and should pull out of
the slump.
UCLA, on the other hand,
has overcome an early season
blight and is riding a 10-game
win streak.

"The Bruins are finally
playing the kind of basketball
that people predicted of
them," Dißiaso said. "There
might not be a better team in
the country with their depth in
talent. To play them 14 hours
after the USC game will be an
added challenge for us."
