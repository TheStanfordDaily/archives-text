The leather and steel pom
mel horse turned out to be
more monster than horse for
the men's gymnastics team in
their meet against California
and San Jose State last Friday
night. The men, who stand 7-4
overall, defeated San Jose but
lost to Cal in a close, tense
competition.
In an event that requires
strength and dexterity, the
men "failed to hit their rou
tines," said coach Sadao
Hamada. "It wasour first event.
The guys didn't have time to
warm up." Since the pommel
horse is an event which re
quires consistent support of
one arm, it is easy for the cold,
nervous athlete to fall.
Once past the pommel
horse, the team did well, pull
ing out 260 points, the second
highest score of the season.
Season highs were also turned
in for the floor exercise and the
parallel bars.
Individually, Sophomore Ed

Gresser and Senior Jeff Chung
gave excellent performances
on the floor and vault, while
Bob Maganini turned in a ca
reer best of 9.4 on the high bar.
Sophomore Chris Smith and
Junior Kirk Druey also gave ex
cellent routines on the rings,
high bar, and vault. "The pom
mel horse was really the only
problem area,"stated Hamada.
"All of the other events went
relatively well."
Tonight, the men will face
the strong California Bears
Club and Long Beach City Col
lege, both excellent teams. The
meet will be held in Maples Pa
vilion along with the women's
meet against Fresno and Sacra
mento State. "We will have the
home team advantage," said
Hamada, "but even if ev
erything goes well, California
will probably be ten points
ahead of us." Ten points is
quite a large margin in a sport
which is judged by tenths of a
point, but Hamada said "we'll
try to beat them."
