The construction of the new residential complex
near lake Lagunita will probably provide enough
living space to guarantee all undergraduates four
years of campus housing, and will definitely make
available 354 new spaces for graduates, according
to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of student af
fairs and director of the University housing center.
The new residences, which will cost the Univer
sity more than $36 million, will also introduce a va
riety of innovations, such as the installation of
computer outlets in every student's room, which
will set a new trend in housing, said Jan Van
Houten, director of the new residences.
Although Whitney stressed that the University
will not know if it can provide four years of guaran
teed housing until construction ends on the new
residences in September of 1983, he acknowledges
that the complex was constructed with that goal in
mind.
"There will be no changes in this year's draw, ex
cept for the addition of thesuitesand independent
houses, but we will review the draw in the future to
determine whether we are meeting under
graduate demand," he said.
According to Van Houten, the following
changes will be implemented starting next Sep
tember because of the construction of the new

complex:
•The independent houses will open in Septem
ber, providing an additional 160 spaces in the Uni
versity housing system. Undergrads will be placed
in these houses.
•260 undergrads who have drawn into the suites
and eating centers will be placed in Manzanita
Park for fall quarter, and will be moved to the
suites when they open in January of 1983.
•The University will make Manzanita Park avail
able to graduates, but will reduce the number of
people per trailer from four to three.
•The dorm complex known as Sterling Quad will
open in September of 1983, making available 360
additional spaces for undergrads.
Van Houten said that a committee is now dis
cussing the construction of new graduate housing.
"The University has recognized a definite need
for more graduate housing," she said.
Van Houten pointed out that the University now
only houses 19.5 percent of all graduates. She said
that new graduate housing would be located near
the golf course driving range, next to the Cowell
Cluster or in place of Manzanita Park.
Plans for the installation of computer outlets in
every room in the new residences are part of a Uni
versity-wide trend of increased implementation of
computer facilities, according to Van Houten.
The University is banking on "computer termi
nals becoming as popular as pocket calculators in

five years," said Van Houten. She also noted that
the program center, which will be a central office
and mail facility for the new residences, will have
six computers which will be attached to the LOTS
computer system.
Another innovation to be introduced with the
new complex is solar heating. The roof structure of
every building in the complex is being planned so
that at least 40 percent of the roof space will be
available for -olar collecters.
The University is also planning substantial reno
vation in both Stern and Wilbur, which Van
Houten partly attributes to the comparatively
plush design of the new residences.
"Building these new residences will be terribly
expensive, and Stern and Wilbur will both suffer in
comparison ' said Van Houten.
Renovation of Stern and Wiibur, at a cost of
$500,000, will go on through the summer of 1983,
according to Ed Scoles, director of housing and
food services. Scoles said the University plans on
carpeting all of Wilbur by 1983, and will redesign
bathrooms there, as well as re-paint and refurbish
Stern.
Van Houten said that construction on the resi
dences is days behind schedule because of
rain, but she said she is not at all worried about
their opening late. She also said that the project is
"absolutely on budget."
