Biding "Fuck Me STUART". "I

B|kie smiled at herself, the
she always did when she

as Craig fumbled
$pj|i the zipper to his new
black leather boots. "You
might as well say that the Chip
munks are into heavy metal."
Craig wasn't listening. "I
don't know why I listen to you,
man. This is the last time I go
shopping, at the Salvation
Italy. Damn this zipper."
Wpo, no, leave it unzipped.
jfpcooler that way."
i||But the shoes will fall off,
most of the people
pip be there tonight are
filler '60s freaks or high school
ki<|rwho think this is punk and
don't know any better. If you
want to be like that, OK, but
don't expect me to go with
you/'
Craig was more than a little
puzzled — he had never seen
act like that before. "Well
to begin with, you're going
With me because I have a car
$nd you're too cool to think
feu even need a license. And
feu go to high school too, man,
■member? Hey, besides, Ire-
Pember when you first told me
l/ow, this Police bunch,
frey're really cool, man.' And
ken the critics didn't like 'em

and you gotta get all stuck-up
and 'Hey, this is really just pop
music, you know.' Well, it
wasn't pop until we liked it,
man. You know, you sound like
one of them damn critics."
Craig was never very smart —
in fact, at the gas station where
he worked, he still had to
stomp his foot sometimes
while counting back change —
but he had a point, and Mike
knew it. "Yeah, so I liked the
Police for a little while. But that
was years ago. And when I tried
to tell you about them, who
said 'I can't stand that punk
rock crap'? I'll give you a hint
— it was the same guy that was
'Raaaahhx-ane'-ing all sum
mer. jeez, that was annoying."
"That was pretty funny,
wasn't it? I can't believe I did
that, man," laughedCraigas he
climbed into the driver's seat of
the Duster and sped off to the
Cow Palace.
"I can't believe your mom
lent us the Buick," said Jackie
as Judy climbed into the
driver's seat to drive to the Cow
Palace. "That's really nice of
her. And those pants — aren't
they uncomfortable?"
"Weil, they are a little tight
around the hips, but all the
punks at school wear 'em, so I
told my mom it was OK."
"God, I wish I had them.
Stuart would just drop in his
tracks. I knew he would be my
favorite, ever since I bought
the album."
Judy made a face. "Jackie,
you never bought the album.
Cindy Brophy bought it and ev
eryone else bought blank
tapes. God, if my mom ever
caught me doing that she'd die.
Are you sure we're early
enough? It's already 5:30."
"You never can tell with
these general admission things.
I hope we get down close to
the stage, so Stuart sees my
sign. I wonder what it's like to
be at a punk concert?" Just
then Jackie made an involun
tary swipe at the radio. "Ugh —
I hate theClash!"
"Turn that Clash crap off,"
said Mike, making his own
command obsolete by
switching off the radio and
breaking off the dial in the
same motion. "I can't stand
bands that have sold out."
"You bought a ticket, man."
"I bought yours. Can't help it
if you can't get a date."
Craig was ready to let the
subject drop by now. "Now
look man, I don't wanna hear

you ragging on the Police. I
think they're good musicians,
and they say somethingto me. I
like thein, and I'm looking to
have a good time tonight. If
you're not, then do something
else."
Mike's ears perked up a mo
ment, but he quickly assumed
his nonchalance. I'm prepared
to let sleeping dogs lie, he
thought, chuckling at his own
joke. Craig pulled the Duster
into the Cow Palace parking
lot. "Hey, look at that girl with
the 'Fuck Me Stuart' sign.
Punks are pretty funny." Mike
made a sign of disgust, but hid
it quickly, hoping Craig
wouldn't notice.
Inside the arena, the Police
took the stage, jumping into a
slightly jazzed-up "Message in
a Bottle". Jackie was upset —
not only did Stuart Copeland
ignore her (even though she
stole a security guard's
flashlight to shine on her sign),
but the music onstage was
downright weird. Sting's bass
guitar didn't seem to have a
body to it — just strings, a
frame and a synthesizer next to
it. Andy Summers had a syn
thesizer next to him too, but
like Sting he never played it —
he just played his guitar
through it, making all sorts of
strange effects. From this dis
tance, Andy seemed pretty

cute too, and boy could he
teach Stuart about clothes.
Judy felt good — sure, the
music was a little different, but
she liked that, and she was sur
prised there was room to dance
on the sold-out Cow Palace
dance floor. She bought the
latest Police album, even
before Cindy Brophy, and
didn't really like it that much;
there's just a time when it all
sounds the same, you know?
But there's a lot more energy to
the Police when they play live.
She read it in a review, so she
knew she had to buy tickets.
And she wasn't disappointed.
Jackie nudged Judy from her
thoughts. "Look, over there, a
real punkl Those boots look so
cool."
"Won't they fall off if they're
unzipped?"
Craig stumbled over his
boots again and fell into Mike.
"Hey man, no one can see my
feet. Is it OK to be uncool now
and zip them up?"
"Be quiet, man!" shouted
Mike above the noise. Sting
was leading the spirited au
dience through a singalong
rendition of "One World", and
Mike didn't want to miss any of
it. "These guys are pretty hot,
man. Andy Summers is a great
guitarist — hey, did you know
he was in the Animals?"
Craig shrugged; he had nev

er heard of the Animals, and he
cared more about Mike's sud
den change of heart. "What's
this 'one world is enough' stuff
about, anyway?"
"Doesn't matter, does it? I
don't like them, but they can
play."
Craig wasn't so sure. The mu
sic from the stage seemed pret
ty good, and the sound system
was terrific. But everything
sounded a little bit alike after a
while — you know, like when
you're at a party and people
only play the same record the
whole night 'cause it's the only
one you can dance to? Mike's
parties were like that. Yeah, it's
fun, and all that, but man.. .
Sting started to play his syn
thesizer like a keyboard for
"Driving in the Rain", and
Mike began to get seriously
unsettled. "I can't help it. I'm a
sucker for synthesizers. Jeez, I
didn't think the Police could
get this weird." A little later,
smoke and a mirror-ball light
show added to the at
mosphere, and Mike went just
out of control. Craig didn't
bother to listen to him — he
was suffering from an aesthetic
headache.
Stomping around during the
encore and calling an array of
"ee-ohh"s, "ee-yeah-ohh"s,
and "ee-yah-ohh"s, Sting

seemed like a cross between
Harry Belafonte and Kim
Carnes. Jackie wasn't watching,
torn as she was between Andy
Summers and Judy's arm pull
ing her out of the crowd to
leave the Cow Palace before
the rush. Her sign was ruined
— it was torn in the middle and
now read "Fume Start" — but
she didn't mind. "Isn't Andy
Summers just a doll? I wish he
wasn't so short."
Not so content to listen to
Jackie's latest crush, Judy kept
on trying to make her way
through the crowd. She had a
good time — in fact, she loved
the encore version of "So
Lonely" — but it was getting
late, and even though there
was no school tomorrow her
mom might get upset. Besides,
if she was lucky, maybe she'd
see that punk with the un
zipped boots again. Maybe
they went to the same school
or something.
Mike was ecstatic about the
show, and Craig wasn't looking
forward to the ride home. "I
can't believe I was so,cynical
before the show. That was
great! Andy Summers — he's
doing an album with Robert
Fripp (Robert Fripp? thought
Mike) next summer. I hope
they tour — they'd be great!"
"I don't know man, didn't
everything sound the same af

ter a while?"
"Craig, that's their formula.
Don't you understand?"
"You sound like a critic
again," said Craig in a mixture
of disgust and relief that Mike
hadn't totally changed.
"Hey. Look over there,"
shouted Mike over the din of
fans storming out after the sec
ond encore and the humming
of his own ears. "Ask her if the
Police always sound the same.
Tell her she's boring and she
shouldn't be having fun."
Craig looked across the park
ing lot, finally noticing two girls
singing "won't you be my girl"
in Sting-like falsettos. One of
them had that sign they <-aw
earlier — for chrissake, Mike —
but he thought he had seen the
other at school. Maybe she was
in a c lass of his. Nice pants, too.
Well, he couldn't get a date to
the concert, maybe he'd meet
someone anyway.
Craig hesitantly stumbled
over his unzipped boots to
judv, who was a little surprised
at seeing him again. "Hi. Don't
we have a class together?"
"Jackie, what happened to
your si — Oh hi. I think so, may
be."
"Wasn't that a great show? I
really like Andy Summers —
did you know he was in the
Animals for a while?"
