### Adam Berns 
When both teams walk off
the field with a look of disap
pointment and dejection on
their faces it means nothing
more than the old "it's like kiss
ing your sister" tie.
After over four hours of play
yesterday, the Stanford
baseball team had its five-game
win streak brought to an end as
they tied the Santa Clara Bron
cos 2-2 in a game that was
called after 11 innings due to
darkness.
After the grueling marathon,
Stanford coach Mark Marquess
was obviously a little disap
pointed, but was also quick to
point out the bright side. "It
beats losing," Marquess said.
"We were down in the ninth
and came back to tie it. I was
pleased with that."
In the fourth inning, the
Broncos came close to scoring
the games first run but came up
short. Santa Clara infielder
Kevin Dunton doubled and
then reached third base on a
wild pitch. After Dunton
tagged up and seemingly
scored on a fly ball, Stanford
threw the ball to third base and
Dunton was called out for leav
ing too early on his tag.
Santa Clara came back to
score a run in the sixth inning.
Infielder Mark Cummins led
off the inning with a walk. After
going to third on a wild pitch
which Cardinal catcher Bob
Hausladen had a hard time fin
ding, he scored when Bronco
catcher Kevin Walters singled
him in.
Stanford tied the game up in

the bottom of the seventh.
Centerfielder Darryl Stephens
led off the inning with a sharp
single to left field. Hardgrave
followed with another single to
left. Catcher Bob Hauslatin
then moved the rpnners tosec
ond and third putting a perfect
sacrifice bunt down the first
base line. Then Mike Dotterer
— who had just returned from
a knee injury — singled up the
middle to drive in Stephens,
tying the game 1-1.
The Broncos took the lead
again in the eighth inning. Af
ter outfielder David Oliva
doubled, the next two batters
walked, loading up the bases.
Stanford reliever Mike Sullivan
— who had taken over for
starter Steve Cottrell folllowing
Oliva's double — struck out
the next batter but then walked
infielder Gary Clarke, to give
Santa Clara a 2-1 lead.
Things did not look good for
the Cardinal as it entered the
bottom of the ninth inning be
hind 2-1. Stephens quickly tied
the score on the very first pitch
of the inning, sending a tower
ing blast over the left field
fence. Pinch hitter Greg
Lorenzetti followed with a sin
gle in right-center field and af
ter Dotterer walked, second
baseman Steve Buechelle sin
gled to load the bases. How
ever, with one out, infielder
Loring Davies hit into a double
plav to end the inning.
In the tenth and eleventh in
nings, neither Stanford nor
Santa Clara could score and the
game was called due to
darkness.
