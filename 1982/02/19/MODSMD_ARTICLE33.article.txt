Tomorrow's men's swim
ming meet at de Guerre pool
pitting Stanford against rival
California will be a match-up of
national aquatic powerhouses.
The Cardinal is ranked No. 3
while the Bears are just three
notches lower according to the
NC\/\ coaches poll.
Stanford coach Skip Kenney
sees Saturday's meet as "extra
special" for a number of rea
sons.
"This is an emotional type
meet because it is the last dual
meet of the year," Kenney said.
"Also, you always want to beat
the Weenies."
Stanford must qualify a
number of individuals for next

month's NCAA Cham
pionships if it hopes to have
any chance at capturing the na
tional title.
Key events in tomorrow's
meet include the 200 yard but
terfly and the 500 yard free
style. Kenney also cited the
sprints as having a major bear
ing on the outcome.
"I think if we can win the
sprints, we'll win the meet,"
Kenney said.
Cal won back-to-back NCAA
Championships in 1979 and
1980. The Bears's top swimmer
is sprinter Pelle Homertz, who
possesses nationally-ranked
times in the 50 yard (20.44) and
100 yard (45.06) freestyles.
Stanford sports a 9-2 dual

meet record and is coming off
victories over USC, UC-lrvine
