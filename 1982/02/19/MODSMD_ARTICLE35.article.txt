Gallipoli ** v j
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.
Starts next Thursday with
Bernardo Bartolucci's The Con
formist.

Jules et Jim ****
Monday, Kresge
Francois Truffaut directed this
gentle —almost mystical — trian
gular love story about a woman
who loves, and is loved by, two
men. Jeanne Moreau, who gives
a breathtaking performance,
plays Catherine, a woman who
transforms the mundane with her
passion and her near-religious af
fection for irrationality. She is at
once a powerful creative and de
structive force: she brings beau
tiful annihilation.
The film, set in the period lead
ing up to World War I, has the
hazy, shifting quality of a half-re
membered dream: it is irresistibly
haunting.
Double-billed with Room at
the Top.
-J.M.
A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not dear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisley ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

Taps *
Old Mill, Mountain View
The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by its students to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writers shift gears
to manipulate our emotions.
With Timothy Hutton as the cadet
major who leads the move and
George C. Scott, who has never
been worse, as a half-cracked old
general.

Fox, Redwood City
The Monty Python people
bring you something completely
different: a funny, by turns
charming and cynical fantasy
about a boy who inadvertently
gets caught up with the exploits
of six dwarfs who're out to
plunder the greatest treasures of
all time.The camera seldom raises
higher than about four-foot-one,
and maybe the air is richer down
there — this movie is faster and
more clever than any of the re
cent American fantasies popu
lated entirely by six-footers.
Double-billed Sunday and
Monday with Watership Down.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
There are about three good
minutes in this one, and those
three—most of them involving
singing, dancing, and suchlike
are choice. But to get those few
nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours of I was a
Teenaged Chorus line. All the fa
miliar faces are here: an ig
norant-but-talented ghetto kid, a
girl who brings along a Jewish
mother out of a '40s comic strip,
and a lonely-but-talented
homosexual son of a famous ac
tress. All work to prove that it
takes an incredible amount of tal
ent to keep those soapsuds com
ing. Alan Parker, who made the
world safe for stereotypes with
1978's Midnight Express,
directed.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Hair.

On Golden Pond *
Park, Menlo Park
Tbe two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who manages to retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.

Cutter's Way ***
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ivan Passer directed this
dreamy — almost hallucinatory
— story of a man who, convinced
that that he has discovered cor
ruption in high places, drags his
friends through an increasingly
unsettling chase. The movie's im
agery is often beautiful — even
the credit sequence, which
shows a Southern Californian pa
rade in slow motion set to somber
music, is breathtakingly ex
ecuted. The script, unfortunately,
isn't so hot: it doesn't wind itself
up into the tense, fatalistic ball
you sense Passer wants it to be
come, and the dialogue is some
times oddly stilted, as if the actors
got hold of the first draft of the
screenplay instead of the more
polished revisions.
Starts next Thursday with Roll
over.

The 39 Steps ****
Saturday, Tresidder Large Lounge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high -spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
nocence Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
Late show. •

Ordinary People**
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truths about each other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
,i family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life
right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.
Tonight only with Kramer vs.
Kramer.
— Ron Lilleiord

Hair ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a
restless, giddy fashion; he man
ages to capture the timeless,
rock'n'roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
romantic fantasy vision of Ameri
ca, but even in those terms, Hair
might just be the truest picture of
the '60s ever made. With John
Savage, Beverly D'Angelo and
Treat Williams.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Fame

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
sot of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
fnis tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.
— S.V.
For Your Eyes Only**
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, nf course, that it's not
sadistic, Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: it's rumored that the pro
ducers plan to replace him with a
younger model soon). He perks
up momentarily — as does the
movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the
rest of the film, For Your Eyes
Only might have passed for en
tertainment instead of an ex
ercise in treading water.

For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.
Starts next Thursday with
Bernardo Bartolucci's The Con
formist.

Francois Truffaut directed this
gentle —almost mystical — trian
gular love story about a woman
who loves, and is loved by, two
men. Jeanne Moreau, who gives
a breathtaking performance,
plays Catherine, a woman who
transforms the mundane with her
passion and her near-religious af
fection for irrationality. She is at
once a powerful creative and de
structive force: she brings beau
tiful annihilation.
The film, set in the period lead
ing up to World War I, has the
hazy, shifting quality of a half-re
membered dream: it is irresistibly
haunting.
Double-billed with Room at
the Top.

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not dear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisley ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by its students to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writers shift gears
to manipulate our emotions.
With Timothy Hutton as the cadet

been worse, as a half-cracked old
general.

Tbe two central characters are
a retired professor approaching

This is the kind of movie in which

Ivan Passer directed this
dreamy — almost hallucinatory
— story of a man who, convinced
that that he has discovered cor
ruption in high places, drags his
friends through an increasingly
unsettling chase. The movie's im
agery is often beautiful — even
the credit sequence, which
shows a Southern Californian pa
rade in slow motion set to somber
music, is breathtakingly ex
ecuted. The script, unfortunately,
isn't so hot: it doesn't wind itself
up into the tense, fatalistic ball
you sense Passer wants it to be
come, and the dialogue is some
times oddly stilted, as if the actors
got hold of the first draft of the
screenplay instead of the more
polished revisions.
Starts next Thursday with Roll

The 39 Steps ****
Saturday, Tresidder Large Lounge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high -spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
nocence Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
Late show. •

Ordinary People**
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truths about each other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
,i family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life
right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.

A great musical fantasy that's

Milos Forman (One Flew Over

restless, giddy fashion; he man
ages to capture the timeless,
rock'n'roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
romantic fantasy vision of Ameri

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
sot of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
fnis tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

For Your Eyes Only**
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, nf course, that it's not
sadistic, Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: it's rumored that the pro
ducers plan to replace him with a
younger model soon). He perks
up momentarily — as does the
movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the
rest of the film, For Your Eyes
Only might have passed for en
tertainment instead of an ex
ercise in treading water.

charming and cynical fantasy

Ivan Passer directed this
dreamy — almost hallucinatory
— story of a man who, convinced
that that he has discovered cor
ruption in high places, drags his
friends through an increasingly
unsettling chase. The movie's im
agery is often beautiful — even
the credit sequence, which
shows a Southern Californian pa
rade in slow motion set to somber
music, is breathtakingly ex
ecuted. The script, unfortunately,
isn't so hot: it doesn't wind itself
up into the tense, fatalistic ball
you sense Passer wants it to be
come, and the dialogue is some
times oddly stilted, as if the actors
got hold of the first draft of the
screenplay instead of the more
polished revisions.
Starts next Thursday with Roll

The 39 Steps ****
Saturday, Tresidder Large Lounge
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated, high -spirited blend of hu
mor, suspense, and wonderfully
implausible situations that
Hitchcock was so gifted at creat
ing. Robert Donat stars as a man
who inadvertently becomes in
volved with a group of spies; he
must flee over what seems to be
nearly all of Great Britain before
he manages to prove his in
nocence Madeleine Carroll is a
woman he picks up on a train:
she thinks he's a murderer, and
Donat's too busy to convince her
otherwise. It's only after the two
are handcuffed together, and left
to wander about the Scottish
moors, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buchan novel.
Late show. •

New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truths about each other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
,i family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life
right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.

A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over

restless, giddy fashion; he man
ages to capture the timeless,
rock'n'roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
romantic fantasy vision of Ameri

might just be the truest picture of

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
sot of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
fnis tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

For Your Eyes Only**
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, nf course, that it's not
sadistic, Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: it's rumored that the pro
ducers plan to replace him with a
younger model soon). He perks
up momentarily — as does the
movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the
rest of the film, For Your Eyes
Only might have passed for en
tertainment instead of an ex
ercise in treading water.

Gallipoli ** v j
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

who loves, and is loved by, two

a breathtaking performance,
plays Catherine, a woman who
transforms the mundane with her
passion and her near-religious af
fection for irrationality. She is at
once a powerful creative and de
structive force: she brings beau
tiful annihilation.
The film, set in the period lead

haunting.

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not dear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a

New Varsity, Palo Alto
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away — af
ter the first few minutes, you
know you're there to really learn
something. The characters spend
their time discovering fun
damental truths about each other
— they're practicing catharsis by
the numbers. Although it's about
,i family in crisis, the movie never
makes you feel that you've really
captured the family's heart and
soul — its guts.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
script tends to squeeze the life
right out of this picture. Redford
is better with the actors; Timothy
Hutton's searing portrayal of the
troubled youth is especially
good. With Mary Tyler Moore
and Donald Sutherland.
Tonight only with Kramer vs.

Hair ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest) works in a
restless, giddy fashion; he man
ages to capture the timeless,
rock'n'roll, rebellious spirit of the
'60s and makes it live again. It's a
romantic fantasy vision of Ameri
ca, but even in those terms, Hair
might just be the truest picture of
the '60s ever made. With John
Savage, Beverly D'Angelo and
Treat Williams.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
sot of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
fnis tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

For Your Eyes Only**
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
This Bond movie's limited am
bitions lend it a certain appeal.
It's not as bloated as the last Bond
extravaganza (Moonraker) and
it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, nf course, that it's not
sadistic, Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: it's rumored that the pro
ducers plan to replace him with a
younger model soon). He perks
up momentarily — as does the
movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the
rest of the film, For Your Eyes
Only might have passed for en
tertainment instead of an ex
ercise in treading water.

Gallipoli ** v j
New Varsity, Palo Alto
For the first hour and a quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a boy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
Cunga Din, though considerably
less exciting and more high
minded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
Gallipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
citement. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

Francois Truffaut directed this

who loves, and is loved by, two

a breathtaking performance,
plays Catherine, a woman who
transforms the mundane with her
passion and her near-religious af
fection for irrationality. She is at
once a powerful creative and de
structive force: she brings beau
tiful annihilation.
The film, set in the period lead

haunting.

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely view of
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the "protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not dear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisley ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent

it's perhaps the least sadistic of
any Bond movie — which doesn't
mean, nf course, that it's not
sadistic, Roger Moore seems to
be growing tired of the role (or
perhaps he's merely stopped
trying: it's rumored that the pro
ducers plan to replace him with a
younger model soon). He perks
up momentarily — as does the
movie itself — for a terrific,
cliche-reversing car chase where
Bond is forced to exchange his
Lotus for a Citroen. If the mov
iemakers had been as playful with
the Bond formula through the
rest of the film, For Your Eyes
Only might have passed for en
tertainment instead of an ex
ercise in treading water.
