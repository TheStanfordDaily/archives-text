Happy Hour
When we say all staffers are invited
to the Daily happy hour today at 4:30
for drinks and good cheer, we mean
all staffers. Even if you've only written
one word of one headline, or wire
edited half a story. Take this time to
get to know your fellow staffers, that
is if you're able to recognize them in
their inebriated condition. If you
continue to work here after doing

that, you'll really be a dedicated jour
nalist.
Junior party moved
The TGIF party for all members of
the illustrious junior class originally
planned for Tresidder has been
moved to the Florence Moore field.
Festivities begin at 4 p.m. and last un
til 6 p.m.
