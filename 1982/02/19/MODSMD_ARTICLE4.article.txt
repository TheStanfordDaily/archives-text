Policy reviewed on El Salvador
Washington—The Reagan administration is considering a change in
regulations that would permit U.S. military advisers in El Salvador to take
their M-16 automatic rifles into the field under certain circumstances,
according to administration sources.
Although officials indicated that the matter was not decided, they
said some change was expected very soon, perhaps a regulation using
vague language that, for example, would allow advisers to keep "per
sonal" weapons such as an M-16 with them under specific situations.
The new look at regulations that currently limit U.S. advisers to carry
ing only sidearms comes in the aftermath of a controversial episode that
unfolded in El Salvador last week and which also has caused some be
hind-the-scenes controversy in Washington.
In that episode, the American ambassador in El Salvador, Deane Hin
ton, ordered a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel to leave the country after
the officer and two other junior officers were photographed — by a tel
evision crew — carrying their M-16s. The advisers were supervising con
struction of a pre-fabricated bridge to replace one blown up by guer
rillas fighting the U.S.-backed government.
Although Hinton was acting under regulationsthat currently prohibit
the carrying of combat weapons by American advisers, sources here say
the ambassador's action, which one official characterized as an "over
reaction," annoyed the Pentagon and also caused concern within the
State Department and the White House.
The concern in Washington, the official explained, was how the pub
lic here would react if a Gl helping to build a bridge in El Salvador is
killed by guerrillas in an area where he was not supposed to be carrying
a weapon to protect himself.
The situation illustrates a dilemma for the administration that is deep
ening as the American involvement with the besieged government of El
Salvador grows.
When the United States began to step up its military aid to El Salvador
a year ago, the administration went to gteat lengths to try to allay fears
that this increased involvement was similar to the way American in
volvement began in Vietnam. , . i
