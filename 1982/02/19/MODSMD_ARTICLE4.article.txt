Policy reviewed on El Salvador
Washington—The Reagan administration is considering a change in
regulations that would permit U.S. military advisers in El Salvador to take
their M-16 automatic rifles into the field under certain circumstances,
according to administration sources.
Although officials indicated that the matter was not decided, they
said some change was expected very soon, perhaps a regulation using
vague language that, for example, would allow advisers to keep "per
sonal" weapons such as an M-16 with them under specific situations.
The new look at regulations that currently limit U.S. advisers to carry
ing only sidearms comes in the aftermath of a controversial episode that
unfolded in El Salvador last week and which also has caused some be
hind-the-scenes controversy in Washington.
In that episode, the American ambassador in El Salvador, Deane Hin
ton, ordered a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel to leave the country after
the officer and two other junior officers were photographed — by a tel
evision crew — carrying their M-16s. The advisers were supervising con
struction of a pre-fabricated bridge to replace one blown up by guer
rillas fighting the U.S.-backed government.
Although Hinton was acting under regulationsthat currently prohibit
the carrying of combat weapons by American advisers, sources here say
the ambassador's action, which one official characterized as an "over
reaction," annoyed the Pentagon and also caused concern within the
State Department and the White House.
The concern in Washington, the official explained, was how the pub
lic here would react if a Gl helping to build a bridge in El Salvador is
killed by guerrillas in an area where he was not supposed to be carrying
a weapon to protect himself.
The situation illustrates a dilemma for the administration that is deep
ening as the American involvement with the besieged government of El
Salvador grows.
When the United States began to step up its military aid to El Salvador
a year ago, the administration went to gteat lengths to try to allay fears
that this increased involvement was similar to the way American in
volvement began in Vietnam. , . i
The administration stressed that the U.S. mili
tary personnel would be trainers and not "com
bat advisers," would remain in garrisons or oth
erwise safe zones, would carry only sidearms
and would not go into combat zones.
As the war has expanded, however, and as the
territory that guerrillas are contesting has
grown, it is far less clear what a combat zone is.
The area where the officers were heading last
week was one Hinton described later as "rea
sonably safe," yet it obviously was also an area
where guerrillas had blown up a bridge.
Deng is still in command
Peking—Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese Com
munist Party's powerful vice chairman, whose
five-week absence touched off widespread
concern about his health and his political posi
tion, reappeared yesterday with assurances that
he is as much in command here as ever.
Deng, the principal navigator of China's
course for the past 3 1-2 years, said that the cur
rent campaign to reduce China's massive bu
reaucracy was proceeding without major prob
lems and that the country's top leaders were
fully agreed on the need for it if China is to
modernize.
"It is going on very smoothly," Deng said, re
jecting speculation that he faced such substan
tial opposition on the question that his own
strength had been significantly eroded. "The
comrades in our party, including the older
ones, hold identical views on this issue. I think
the job can be finished much earlier than ex
pected."
Deng was speaking to Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian chief of state,
at the Great Hall of the People yesterday morn
ing, his first public appearance since Jan. 12. Af
terward Sihanouk said Deng, 77, looked "very
strong, very vigorous," and on the evening tele
vision news, Deng appeared fit and self-confi
dent.
China's present political situation, Deng told
Sihanouk, was "one of unprecedented stabil
ity," the official New China News Agency re
ported. "It was due to this political stability and
the continuity of policy in recent yearsthat Chi
na could come to grips with bureaucracy and
cut back on overlapping (offices) and overstaf
fing," the agency quoted Deng as saying.
Deng told Sihanouk he was aware of the
questions raised by his absence, explaining that
he had taken "nearly one month's rest in other
parts of the country" over the Chinese lunar
new year.
"The whole truth has now come out," the of
ficial news agency quoted Sihanouk as replying.
"The world pays special attention to the stability
of your country and world opinion wishes you
good health so that you will fulfil the historical
mission your country and nation have entrusted
to you."
Reagan: interest rates a threat
Washington —President Ronald Reagan said
that high interest rates represent "the greatest
single threat today to a healthy, lasting re
covery" from the recession. Major banks in
creased the prime rate Wednesday from 16.4 to
17 percent.
The president said the boost reflected con
cern that the Federal Reserve Board might ease
monetary policy, and that the administration
might tolerate ever-higher deficits. Reagan's
own budget projects record deficits, with the
figure this year estimated at $98.6 billion.
But he said the Federal Reserve and the ad
ministration can and will work together to pro

duce monetary and fiscal policies that should
quell concerns in the money markets."I will de
vote the resources of my presidency to keeping
deficits down over the next several years," he
said.
The president said he inherited an economic
mess when he took office a year ago, and "since
then we have made progress on many fronts."
He cited the declining inflation rate.
Reagan also:
—Defended his nomination of Sam Hart, a re
ligious broadcaster from Philadelphia, to the
Civil Rights Commission. "I'm quite confident
about his ability," Reagan said, responding to
criticism of Hart's position on equal rights for
women and busing. "He is not against equal
rights. He's for them. He just happens to be op
posed to the ER A," Reagan said.
—Expessed concern about the plight of the
American farmer. "I don't know what sector of
the economy is hurt worse than the American
farmer," he said. He said he would use a grain
embargo as a foreign policy tool "only as part of
an across-the-board embargo" because he
"won't penalize one sector of our industry —
the farmers."
—Refused to comment on whether the Sovi
ets have introduced offensive weapons in Cuba
in violation of an understanding that stemmed
from the Cuban missile crisis.
—Declined to say whether the United States
will again save the Polish government from de
fault on loans to U.S. banks. "Default as it stands
right now would make Poland more dependent
on the Soviet Union," he said, but "we haven't
made a decision on that."
—Defended cuts in federal college loan pro
grams. "It had become so loose that we had
people borrowing money for college loans be
cause they could then reinvest that money on
current high interest rates and make money,"
he said. "I don't believe there is going to be any
cut for a student with true need who really must
have that kind of help to go to college."
Poland attacks Church
Warsaw—Polish Radio broadcast a new at
tack on Poland's Roman Catholic Church yes
terday, critizing priests for inflaming anti
martial law attitudes and for objecting to the
treatment of internees.
The broadcast, which criticized some priests
for acting "irresponsibly" and sowing dissent
with martial law, was the second attack this
week on Poland'sclergyandsuggestedgrowing
official sensitivity to the church's role in the
crisis.
Poland's Catholic primate, Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, has personally criticized the conditions
in which some internees are being held under
martial law and has objected to the removal of
crucifixes and other religious symbols from
buildings where they previously had been al
lowed.
While the broadcast criticisms were relatively
mild, some Western observers here suggested
that they also could constitute a warning to the
church.
In the radio commentary, analyst Jerzy
Malczynski said that some "lower Catholiccler
gy" were reviving "old sources of conflict" by
objecting to state policy forbidding the exhibi
tion of religious symbols in public places, state
institutions and schools.
"Sometimes this is being done in an under
handed manner," he said. "Thus, a priest in
northern Poland appealed to parents to oppose
efforts to remove crosses from schools even if
they were fired upon in the process."

Treasury cuts foreign loans
Washingon—The Reagan administration yes
terday announced plans to cut funding of sub
sidized loans through international lending in
stitutions to the world's poor countries by near
ly 26 percent over the next five years.
This reduction, from $1,537 billion in fiscal
1983 to $1.139 billion in fiscal 1987, is even more
severe v\hen the effect of inflation is taken into
account The cut will dramatically reduce the
ability of the World Bank and the Inter-Ameri
can Development Bank (IADB) to offer aid at
concessional terms to developing countries.
The specific budget plans were announced
by Trea-ury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkel and
Assistant Treasury Secretary Marc Leland in
conjunction with issuance of a long-awaited re
port on United States Participation in the Mul
tilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in the
1980s."
"There's little value in throwing money at
these (poor) countries," Sprinkel told a news
conference, "unless they adopt the necessary
macro- and micro-economic policies to make
them work."
The Treasury report conceded that this will
cut U.S. soft loan aid 30 percent to 45 percent in
real terms from levels originally negotiated, and
allow only the very poorest countries to receive
subsidized loan money through the interna
tional banks.
Small dollar increases are planned for the
Asian Development Bank and the African De
velopment Fund over this five-year period, but
in real terms their funding from the United
States will also go down as part of a com
prehensive new Reagan administration ap
proach that gives priority to"hard window"de
velopment loans, andstressesan increasing role
for the private sector.
South African flagship sinks
Cape Town, South Africa—The flagship of the
South African navy, the frigate Piesident
Kruger, sank early yesterday after colliding with
a'navy supply ship in a gale off South Africa, the
navy announced.
The President Kruger carried a crew of about
203 men, but there was no immediate word on
casualties. However, a spokesman said the Pres
ident Kruger went down shortly after the col
lision, and another frigate and other ships and
helicopters were picking up survivors.
A navy spokesman said the accident occurred
80 miles southwest of Cape Town in gale force
winds. The frigate collided with the supply ship
Tafelberg.
The navy said the Tafelberg was damaged but
was able to proceed to the nearest port.
Stock market gains
New York—The stock market managed to
post its first gain in a week yesterday, aided by a
sharp drop in open-market interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which had fallen 9.03 points over the last four
sessions to an early-1982 low at Wednesday's
close, recovered 1.33 to 828.96.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
reached 60.81 million shares, against 47.66 mil
lion in the previous session.
Gold was $369.25 per ounce in New York yes

Treasury cuts foreign loans
Washingon—The Reagan administration yes
terday announced plans to cut funding of sub
sidized loans through international lending in
stitutions to the world's poor countries by near
ly 26 percent over the next five years.
This reduction, from $1,537 billion in fiscal
1983 to $1.139 billion in fiscal 1987, is even more
severe v\hen the effect of inflation is taken into
account The cut will dramatically reduce the
ability of the World Bank and the Inter-Ameri
can Development Bank (IADB) to offer aid at
concessional terms to developing countries.
The specific budget plans were announced
by Trea-ury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkel and
Assistant Treasury Secretary Marc Leland in
conjunction with issuance of a long-awaited re
port on United States Participation in the Mul
tilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in the
1980s."
"There's little value in throwing money at
these (poor) countries," Sprinkel told a news
conference, "unless they adopt the necessary
macro- and micro-economic policies to make
them work."
The Treasury report conceded that this will
cut U.S. soft loan aid 30 percent to 45 percent in
real terms from levels originally negotiated, and
allow only the very poorest countries to receive
subsidized loan money through the interna
tional banks.
Small dollar increases are planned for the
Asian Development Bank and the African De
velopment Fund over this five-year period, but
in real terms their funding from the United
States will also go down as part of a com
prehensive new Reagan administration ap
proach that gives priority to"hard window"de
velopment loans, andstressesan increasing role
for the private sector.

Policy reviewed on El Salvador
Washington—The Reagan administration is considering a change in
regulations that would permit U.S. military advisers in El Salvador to take
their M-16 automatic rifles into the field under certain circumstances,
according to administration sources.
Although officials indicated that the matter was not decided, they
said some change was expected very soon, perhaps a regulation using
vague language that, for example, would allow advisers to keep "per
sonal" weapons such as an M-16 with them under specific situations.
The new look at regulations that currently limit U.S. advisers to carry
ing only sidearms comes in the aftermath of a controversial episode that
unfolded in El Salvador last week and which also has caused some be
hind-the-scenes controversy in Washington.
In that episode, the American ambassador in El Salvador, Deane Hin
ton, ordered a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel to leave the country after
the officer and two other junior officers were photographed — by a tel
evision crew — carrying their M-16s. The advisers were supervising con
struction of a pre-fabricated bridge to replace one blown up by guer
rillas fighting the U.S.-backed government.
Although Hinton was acting under regulationsthat currently prohibit
the carrying of combat weapons by American advisers, sources here say
the ambassador's action, which one official characterized as an "over
reaction," annoyed the Pentagon and also caused concern within the
State Department and the White House.
The concern in Washington, the official explained, was how the pub
lic here would react if a Gl helping to build a bridge in El Salvador is
killed by guerrillas in an area where he was not supposed to be carrying
a weapon to protect himself.
The situation illustrates a dilemma for the administration that is deep
ening as the American involvement with the besieged government of El
Salvador grows.
When the United States began to step up its military aid to El Salvador
a year ago, the administration went to gteat lengths to try to allay fears
that this increased involvement was similar to the way American in
volvement began in Vietnam. , . i
The administration stressed that the U.S. mili
tary personnel would be trainers and not "com
bat advisers," would remain in garrisons or oth
erwise safe zones, would carry only sidearms
and would not go into combat zones.
As the war has expanded, however, and as the
territory that guerrillas are contesting has
grown, it is far less clear what a combat zone is.
The area where the officers were heading last
week was one Hinton described later as "rea
sonably safe," yet it obviously was also an area
where guerrillas had blown up a bridge.
Deng is still in command
Peking—Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese Com
munist Party's powerful vice chairman, whose
five-week absence touched off widespread
concern about his health and his political posi
tion, reappeared yesterday with assurances that
he is as much in command here as ever.
Deng, the principal navigator of China's
course for the past 3 1-2 years, said that the cur
rent campaign to reduce China's massive bu
reaucracy was proceeding without major prob
lems and that the country's top leaders were
fully agreed on the need for it if China is to
modernize.
"It is going on very smoothly," Deng said, re
jecting speculation that he faced such substan
tial opposition on the question that his own
strength had been significantly eroded. "The
comrades in our party, including the older
ones, hold identical views on this issue. I think
the job can be finished much earlier than ex
pected."
Deng was speaking to Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian chief of state,
at the Great Hall of the People yesterday morn
ing, his first public appearance since Jan. 12. Af
terward Sihanouk said Deng, 77, looked "very
strong, very vigorous," and on the evening tele
vision news, Deng appeared fit and self-confi
dent.
China's present political situation, Deng told
Sihanouk, was "one of unprecedented stabil
ity," the official New China News Agency re
ported. "It was due to this political stability and
the continuity of policy in recent yearsthat Chi
na could come to grips with bureaucracy and
cut back on overlapping (offices) and overstaf
fing," the agency quoted Deng as saying.
Deng told Sihanouk he was aware of the
questions raised by his absence, explaining that
he had taken "nearly one month's rest in other
parts of the country" over the Chinese lunar
new year.
"The whole truth has now come out," the of
ficial news agency quoted Sihanouk as replying.
"The world pays special attention to the stability
of your country and world opinion wishes you
good health so that you will fulfil the historical
mission your country and nation have entrusted
to you."
Reagan: interest rates a threat
Washington —President Ronald Reagan said
that high interest rates represent "the greatest
single threat today to a healthy, lasting re
covery" from the recession. Major banks in
creased the prime rate Wednesday from 16.4 to
17 percent.
The president said the boost reflected con
cern that the Federal Reserve Board might ease
monetary policy, and that the administration
might tolerate ever-higher deficits. Reagan's
own budget projects record deficits, with the
figure this year estimated at $98.6 billion.
But he said the Federal Reserve and the ad
ministration can and will work together to pro

duce monetary and fiscal policies that should
quell concerns in the money markets."I will de
vote the resources of my presidency to keeping
deficits down over the next several years," he
said.
The president said he inherited an economic
mess when he took office a year ago, and "since
then we have made progress on many fronts."
He cited the declining inflation rate.
Reagan also:
—Defended his nomination of Sam Hart, a re
ligious broadcaster from Philadelphia, to the
Civil Rights Commission. "I'm quite confident
about his ability," Reagan said, responding to
criticism of Hart's position on equal rights for
women and busing. "He is not against equal
rights. He's for them. He just happens to be op
posed to the ER A," Reagan said.
—Expessed concern about the plight of the
American farmer. "I don't know what sector of
the economy is hurt worse than the American
farmer," he said. He said he would use a grain
embargo as a foreign policy tool "only as part of
an across-the-board embargo" because he
"won't penalize one sector of our industry —
the farmers."
—Refused to comment on whether the Sovi
ets have introduced offensive weapons in Cuba
in violation of an understanding that stemmed
from the Cuban missile crisis.
—Declined to say whether the United States
will again save the Polish government from de
fault on loans to U.S. banks. "Default as it stands
right now would make Poland more dependent
on the Soviet Union," he said, but "we haven't
made a decision on that."
—Defended cuts in federal college loan pro
grams. "It had become so loose that we had
people borrowing money for college loans be
cause they could then reinvest that money on
current high interest rates and make money,"
he said. "I don't believe there is going to be any
cut for a student with true need who really must
have that kind of help to go to college."
Poland attacks Church
Warsaw—Polish Radio broadcast a new at
tack on Poland's Roman Catholic Church yes
terday, critizing priests for inflaming anti
martial law attitudes and for objecting to the
treatment of internees.
The broadcast, which criticized some priests
for acting "irresponsibly" and sowing dissent
with martial law, was the second attack this
week on Poland'sclergyandsuggestedgrowing
official sensitivity to the church's role in the
crisis.
Poland's Catholic primate, Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, has personally criticized the conditions
in which some internees are being held under
martial law and has objected to the removal of
crucifixes and other religious symbols from
buildings where they previously had been al
lowed.
While the broadcast criticisms were relatively
mild, some Western observers here suggested
that they also could constitute a warning to the
church.
In the radio commentary, analyst Jerzy
Malczynski said that some "lower Catholiccler
gy" were reviving "old sources of conflict" by
objecting to state policy forbidding the exhibi
tion of religious symbols in public places, state
institutions and schools.
"Sometimes this is being done in an under
handed manner," he said. "Thus, a priest in
northern Poland appealed to parents to oppose
efforts to remove crosses from schools even if
they were fired upon in the process."

single threat today to a healthy, lasting re
covery" from the recession. Major banks in
creased the prime rate Wednesday from 16.4 to
17 percent.
The president said the boost reflected con
cern that the Federal Reserve Board might ease
monetary policy, and that the administration
might tolerate ever-higher deficits. Reagan's
own budget projects record deficits, with the
figure this year estimated at $98.6 billion.
But he said the Federal Reserve and the ad
ministration can and will work together to pro

duce monetary and fiscal policies that should
quell concerns in the money markets."I will de
vote the resources of my presidency to keeping
deficits down over the next several years," he
said.
The president said he inherited an economic
mess when he took office a year ago, and "since
then we have made progress on many fronts."
He cited the declining inflation rate.
Reagan also:
—Defended his nomination of Sam Hart, a re
ligious broadcaster from Philadelphia, to the
Civil Rights Commission. "I'm quite confident
about his ability," Reagan said, responding to
criticism of Hart's position on equal rights for
women and busing. "He is not against equal
rights. He's for them. He just happens to be op
posed to the ER A," Reagan said.
—Expessed concern about the plight of the
American farmer. "I don't know what sector of
the economy is hurt worse than the American
farmer," he said. He said he would use a grain
embargo as a foreign policy tool "only as part of
an across-the-board embargo" because he
"won't penalize one sector of our industry —
the farmers."
—Refused to comment on whether the Sovi
ets have introduced offensive weapons in Cuba
in violation of an understanding that stemmed
from the Cuban missile crisis.
—Declined to say whether the United States
will again save the Polish government from de
fault on loans to U.S. banks. "Default as it stands
right now would make Poland more dependent
on the Soviet Union," he said, but "we haven't
made a decision on that."
—Defended cuts in federal college loan pro
grams. "It had become so loose that we had
people borrowing money for college loans be
cause they could then reinvest that money on
current high interest rates and make money,"
he said. "I don't believe there is going to be any
cut for a student with true need who really must
have that kind of help to go to college."
Poland attacks Church
Warsaw—Polish Radio broadcast a new at
tack on Poland's Roman Catholic Church yes
terday, critizing priests for inflaming anti
martial law attitudes and for objecting to the
treatment of internees.
The broadcast, which criticized some priests
for acting "irresponsibly" and sowing dissent
with martial law, was the second attack this
week on Poland'sclergyandsuggestedgrowing
official sensitivity to the church's role in the
crisis.
Poland's Catholic primate, Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, has personally criticized the conditions
in which some internees are being held under
martial law and has objected to the removal of
crucifixes and other religious symbols from
buildings where they previously had been al
lowed.
While the broadcast criticisms were relatively
mild, some Western observers here suggested
that they also could constitute a warning to the
church.
In the radio commentary, analyst Jerzy
Malczynski said that some "lower Catholiccler
gy" were reviving "old sources of conflict" by
objecting to state policy forbidding the exhibi
tion of religious symbols in public places, state
institutions and schools.
"Sometimes this is being done in an under
handed manner," he said. "Thus, a priest in
northern Poland appealed to parents to oppose
efforts to remove crosses from schools even if
they were fired upon in the process."

Treasury cuts foreign loans
Washingon—The Reagan administration yes
terday announced plans to cut funding of sub
sidized loans through international lending in
stitutions to the world's poor countries by near
ly 26 percent over the next five years.
This reduction, from $1,537 billion in fiscal
1983 to $1.139 billion in fiscal 1987, is even more
severe v\hen the effect of inflation is taken into
account The cut will dramatically reduce the
ability of the World Bank and the Inter-Ameri
can Development Bank (IADB) to offer aid at
concessional terms to developing countries.
The specific budget plans were announced
by Trea-ury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkel and
Assistant Treasury Secretary Marc Leland in
conjunction with issuance of a long-awaited re
port on United States Participation in the Mul
tilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in the
1980s."
"There's little value in throwing money at
these (poor) countries," Sprinkel told a news
conference, "unless they adopt the necessary
macro- and micro-economic policies to make
them work."
The Treasury report conceded that this will
cut U.S. soft loan aid 30 percent to 45 percent in
real terms from levels originally negotiated, and
allow only the very poorest countries to receive
subsidized loan money through the interna
tional banks.
Small dollar increases are planned for the
Asian Development Bank and the African De
velopment Fund over this five-year period, but
in real terms their funding from the United
States will also go down as part of a com
prehensive new Reagan administration ap
proach that gives priority to"hard window"de
velopment loans, andstressesan increasing role
for the private sector.
South African flagship sinks
Cape Town, South Africa—The flagship of the

The President Kruger carried a crew of about
203 men, but there was no immediate word on
casualties. However, a spokesman said the Pres
ident Kruger went down shortly after the col
lision, and another frigate and other ships and
helicopters were picking up survivors.
A navy spokesman said the accident occurred
80 miles southwest of Cape Town in gale force

The navy said the Tafelberg was damaged but
was able to proceed to the nearest port.

Policy reviewed on El Salvador
Washington—The Reagan administration is considering a change in
regulations that would permit U.S. military advisers in El Salvador to take
their M-16 automatic rifles into the field under certain circumstances,
according to administration sources.
Although officials indicated that the matter was not decided, they
said some change was expected very soon, perhaps a regulation using
vague language that, for example, would allow advisers to keep "per
sonal" weapons such as an M-16 with them under specific situations.
The new look at regulations that currently limit U.S. advisers to carry
ing only sidearms comes in the aftermath of a controversial episode that
unfolded in El Salvador last week and which also has caused some be
hind-the-scenes controversy in Washington.
In that episode, the American ambassador in El Salvador, Deane Hin
ton, ordered a U.S. Army lieutenant colonel to leave the country after
the officer and two other junior officers were photographed — by a tel
evision crew — carrying their M-16s. The advisers were supervising con
struction of a pre-fabricated bridge to replace one blown up by guer
rillas fighting the U.S.-backed government.
Although Hinton was acting under regulationsthat currently prohibit
the carrying of combat weapons by American advisers, sources here say
the ambassador's action, which one official characterized as an "over
reaction," annoyed the Pentagon and also caused concern within the
State Department and the White House.
The concern in Washington, the official explained, was how the pub
lic here would react if a Gl helping to build a bridge in El Salvador is
killed by guerrillas in an area where he was not supposed to be carrying
a weapon to protect himself.
The situation illustrates a dilemma for the administration that is deep
ening as the American involvement with the besieged government of El
Salvador grows.
When the United States began to step up its military aid to El Salvador
a year ago, the administration went to gteat lengths to try to allay fears
that this increased involvement was similar to the way American in
volvement began in Vietnam. , . i
The administration stressed that the U.S. mili
tary personnel would be trainers and not "com
bat advisers," would remain in garrisons or oth
erwise safe zones, would carry only sidearms
and would not go into combat zones.
As the war has expanded, however, and as the
territory that guerrillas are contesting has
grown, it is far less clear what a combat zone is.
The area where the officers were heading last
week was one Hinton described later as "rea
sonably safe," yet it obviously was also an area
where guerrillas had blown up a bridge.
Deng is still in command
Peking—Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese Com
munist Party's powerful vice chairman, whose
five-week absence touched off widespread
concern about his health and his political posi
tion, reappeared yesterday with assurances that
he is as much in command here as ever.
Deng, the principal navigator of China's
course for the past 3 1-2 years, said that the cur
rent campaign to reduce China's massive bu
reaucracy was proceeding without major prob
lems and that the country's top leaders were
fully agreed on the need for it if China is to
modernize.
"It is going on very smoothly," Deng said, re
jecting speculation that he faced such substan
tial opposition on the question that his own
strength had been significantly eroded. "The
comrades in our party, including the older
ones, hold identical views on this issue. I think
the job can be finished much earlier than ex
pected."
Deng was speaking to Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian chief of state,
at the Great Hall of the People yesterday morn
ing, his first public appearance since Jan. 12. Af
terward Sihanouk said Deng, 77, looked "very
strong, very vigorous," and on the evening tele
vision news, Deng appeared fit and self-confi
dent.
China's present political situation, Deng told
Sihanouk, was "one of unprecedented stabil
ity," the official New China News Agency re
ported. "It was due to this political stability and
the continuity of policy in recent yearsthat Chi
na could come to grips with bureaucracy and
cut back on overlapping (offices) and overstaf
fing," the agency quoted Deng as saying.
Deng told Sihanouk he was aware of the
questions raised by his absence, explaining that
he had taken "nearly one month's rest in other
parts of the country" over the Chinese lunar
new year.
"The whole truth has now come out," the of
ficial news agency quoted Sihanouk as replying.
"The world pays special attention to the stability
of your country and world opinion wishes you
good health so that you will fulfil the historical
mission your country and nation have entrusted
to you."

the ambassador's action, which one official characterized as an "over
reaction," annoyed the Pentagon and also caused concern within the
State Department and the White House.
The concern in Washington, the official explained, was how the pub
lic here would react if a Gl helping to build a bridge in El Salvador is
killed by guerrillas in an area where he was not supposed to be carrying
a weapon to protect himself.
The situation illustrates a dilemma for the administration that is deep
ening as the American involvement with the besieged government of El
Salvador grows.
When the United States began to step up its military aid to El Salvador
a year ago, the administration went to gteat lengths to try to allay fears
that this increased involvement was similar to the way American in
volvement began in Vietnam. , . i
The administration stressed that the U.S. mili
tary personnel would be trainers and not "com
bat advisers," would remain in garrisons or oth
erwise safe zones, would carry only sidearms
and would not go into combat zones.
As the war has expanded, however, and as the
territory that guerrillas are contesting has
grown, it is far less clear what a combat zone is.
The area where the officers were heading last
week was one Hinton described later as "rea
sonably safe," yet it obviously was also an area
where guerrillas had blown up a bridge.
Deng is still in command
Peking—Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese Com
munist Party's powerful vice chairman, whose
five-week absence touched off widespread
concern about his health and his political posi
tion, reappeared yesterday with assurances that
he is as much in command here as ever.
Deng, the principal navigator of China's
course for the past 3 1-2 years, said that the cur
rent campaign to reduce China's massive bu
reaucracy was proceeding without major prob
lems and that the country's top leaders were
fully agreed on the need for it if China is to
modernize.
"It is going on very smoothly," Deng said, re
jecting speculation that he faced such substan
tial opposition on the question that his own
strength had been significantly eroded. "The
comrades in our party, including the older
ones, hold identical views on this issue. I think
the job can be finished much earlier than ex
pected."
Deng was speaking to Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian chief of state,
at the Great Hall of the People yesterday morn
ing, his first public appearance since Jan. 12. Af
terward Sihanouk said Deng, 77, looked "very
strong, very vigorous," and on the evening tele
vision news, Deng appeared fit and self-confi
dent.
China's present political situation, Deng told
Sihanouk, was "one of unprecedented stabil
ity," the official New China News Agency re
ported. "It was due to this political stability and
the continuity of policy in recent yearsthat Chi
na could come to grips with bureaucracy and
cut back on overlapping (offices) and overstaf
fing," the agency quoted Deng as saying.
Deng told Sihanouk he was aware of the
questions raised by his absence, explaining that
he had taken "nearly one month's rest in other
parts of the country" over the Chinese lunar
new year.
"The whole truth has now come out," the of
ficial news agency quoted Sihanouk as replying.
"The world pays special attention to the stability
of your country and world opinion wishes you
good health so that you will fulfil the historical
mission your country and nation have entrusted
to you."
Reagan: interest rates a threat
Washington —President Ronald Reagan said
that high interest rates represent "the greatest
single threat today to a healthy, lasting re
covery" from the recession. Major banks in
creased the prime rate Wednesday from 16.4 to
17 percent.
The president said the boost reflected con
cern that the Federal Reserve Board might ease
monetary policy, and that the administration
might tolerate ever-higher deficits. Reagan's
own budget projects record deficits, with the
figure this year estimated at $98.6 billion.
But he said the Federal Reserve and the ad
ministration can and will work together to pro

duce monetary and fiscal policies that should
quell concerns in the money markets."I will de
vote the resources of my presidency to keeping
deficits down over the next several years," he
said.
The president said he inherited an economic
mess when he took office a year ago, and "since
then we have made progress on many fronts."
He cited the declining inflation rate.
Reagan also:
—Defended his nomination of Sam Hart, a re
ligious broadcaster from Philadelphia, to the
Civil Rights Commission. "I'm quite confident
about his ability," Reagan said, responding to
criticism of Hart's position on equal rights for
women and busing. "He is not against equal
rights. He's for them. He just happens to be op
posed to the ER A," Reagan said.
—Expessed concern about the plight of the
American farmer. "I don't know what sector of
the economy is hurt worse than the American
farmer," he said. He said he would use a grain
embargo as a foreign policy tool "only as part of
an across-the-board embargo" because he
"won't penalize one sector of our industry —
the farmers."
—Refused to comment on whether the Sovi
ets have introduced offensive weapons in Cuba
in violation of an understanding that stemmed
from the Cuban missile crisis.
—Declined to say whether the United States
will again save the Polish government from de
fault on loans to U.S. banks. "Default as it stands
right now would make Poland more dependent
on the Soviet Union," he said, but "we haven't
made a decision on that."
—Defended cuts in federal college loan pro
grams. "It had become so loose that we had
people borrowing money for college loans be
cause they could then reinvest that money on
current high interest rates and make money,"
he said. "I don't believe there is going to be any
cut for a student with true need who really must
have that kind of help to go to college."
Poland attacks Church
Warsaw—Polish Radio broadcast a new at
tack on Poland's Roman Catholic Church yes
terday, critizing priests for inflaming anti
martial law attitudes and for objecting to the
treatment of internees.
The broadcast, which criticized some priests
for acting "irresponsibly" and sowing dissent
with martial law, was the second attack this
week on Poland'sclergyandsuggestedgrowing
official sensitivity to the church's role in the
crisis.
Poland's Catholic primate, Archbishop Jozef
Glemp, has personally criticized the conditions
in which some internees are being held under
martial law and has objected to the removal of
crucifixes and other religious symbols from
buildings where they previously had been al
lowed.
While the broadcast criticisms were relatively
mild, some Western observers here suggested
that they also could constitute a warning to the
church.
In the radio commentary, analyst Jerzy
Malczynski said that some "lower Catholiccler
gy" were reviving "old sources of conflict" by
objecting to state policy forbidding the exhibi
tion of religious symbols in public places, state
institutions and schools.
"Sometimes this is being done in an under
handed manner," he said. "Thus, a priest in
northern Poland appealed to parents to oppose
efforts to remove crosses from schools even if
they were fired upon in the process."

Treasury cuts foreign loans
Washingon—The Reagan administration yes
terday announced plans to cut funding of sub
sidized loans through international lending in
stitutions to the world's poor countries by near
ly 26 percent over the next five years.
This reduction, from $1,537 billion in fiscal
1983 to $1.139 billion in fiscal 1987, is even more
severe v\hen the effect of inflation is taken into
account The cut will dramatically reduce the
ability of the World Bank and the Inter-Ameri
can Development Bank (IADB) to offer aid at
concessional terms to developing countries.
The specific budget plans were announced
by Trea-ury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkel and
Assistant Treasury Secretary Marc Leland in
conjunction with issuance of a long-awaited re
port on United States Participation in the Mul
tilateral Development Banks (MDBs) in the
1980s."
"There's little value in throwing money at
these (poor) countries," Sprinkel told a news
conference, "unless they adopt the necessary
macro- and micro-economic policies to make
them work."
The Treasury report conceded that this will
cut U.S. soft loan aid 30 percent to 45 percent in
real terms from levels originally negotiated, and
allow only the very poorest countries to receive
subsidized loan money through the interna
tional banks.
Small dollar increases are planned for the
Asian Development Bank and the African De
velopment Fund over this five-year period, but
in real terms their funding from the United
States will also go down as part of a com
prehensive new Reagan administration ap
proach that gives priority to"hard window"de
velopment loans, andstressesan increasing role
for the private sector.
