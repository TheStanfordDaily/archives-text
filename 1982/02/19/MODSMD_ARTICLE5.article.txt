# CAPS defends its rape counseling
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
Recent dissatisfaction with the ser
vices of the Counseling and Psy
chological Service Confer (CAPS) on
the part of rape victims may have
arisen because crisis resolution was
not immediate, according to CAPS
Director David Dorosin.
" A rape can leave a long-term scar
in some cases. It creates a huge input
of emotions. Overwhelming feelings
are mobilized. Clarification (of these
feelings) must be done at the individ
ual's speed, and that may be slow,"
he said.
A rape victim's desire for support
and immediate emotional clari
fication may cause dissatisfaction
with counseling services, said Leah
Kaplan, member of the CAPS staff.
But, she said, "It's natural. Anyone
may feel she is not getting enough
help . . . We can't make it (the hurt)
go away magically."
Dorosin said he fears CAPS's repu
tation has been damaged by the pub
lication in Campus Report and the
Daily of discussions by two of the vic
tims. The two victims said the CAPS
service did not provide them with the
support they needed.
"I wanted help to gain control of
my life after my rape and he (the
counselor) wanted to know about my
childhood," said one victim.
Another victim said her counselor
"wanted to discuss everything but
what was mv real problem (which
was the attack)."
Kaplan said in some cases a more
Freudian method of interpretation
may be necessary, but that counsel
ors only begin such discussions when
a woman brings up family questions.
"It may or may not be a loaded top
ic," she said.
Dorosin said conflict between a pa
tient and a counselor may arise when

,in individual misunderstands the
direction of a counseling session or
may not feel comfortable with a par
ticular counselor. "If you don't feel
comfortable with the first person you
see, ask to see someone else," he
said.
"We are available as a back-up
support. We try to utilize the natural
ly occurring support networks too.
We support the motion of sequenc
ing of decisions, the reinstating of
control. In general, we like to come
in when the person asks to see us
rather than v\hen the person is asked
to see us. We are not indifferent," he
said.
Both Dorosin and Kaplan em
phasized that professional counsel
ing may not be the best "therapy" for
an individual. For some victims, other
more informal kinds of counseling
are more effective, they said.
"Both (professional and informal
counseling) are important. It de
pends on the situation," said Kaplan.
"It has become easier to talk to peo
ple outside a professional counseling
situation now The subject (of rape) is
on more people's minds and it is no
longer a taboo subject," she said.
One rape victim said, "The best
(therapv) was the meeting with the
other rape victims during rny coun
seling session . . . only other victims
can understand. Counselors can be
sensitive but they can't really under
stand."
Out of that first meeting among
some of the rape victims has grown a
support group organized through
Patricia Brandt of the Office of Stu
dent Activities. Eight women have
called about the group so far, said
Brandt.
Four of the women were victims of
earlier rapes who felt they had re
covered and wanted to help other
