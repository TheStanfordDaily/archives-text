# New labs to best other university facilities, allow high-tech research

Stanford's new Center for Integrated Systems facility,
the backbone of a plan to incorporate the many ele
ments of integrated systems research under one roof,
will contain laboratories far superior to those at any oth
er university, according to Jacques Beaudouin, chief en
gineer for CIS.
The new facility, which will be located at the southwest
corner of Via Palou and Campus Drive on the present site
of Ventura Hall, will allow electrical engineers, com
puter scientists, and material scientists to work in close
proximity on the various aspects of integrated systems
research.
Ventura Hall will be "moved as an entity" toa newsite,
according to University Planner Roger Cairns, who acts
as a liaison between the University and the CIS architect.
There are other spots on campus where the CIS facility
could have been located which would not have required
moving an existing building; however, the designers of
CIS felt that it was essential the facility be near the various
departments involved. CIS is presently using facilities in
the McCullough Building, Durand Building, Applied
Electronics Research Lab, Electronics Research Lab and
Margaret Jacks Hall.
"Ventura Hall needed to be brought up to code any
way," Beaudouin said. "The building would have to be
lifted out of it's foundation" to complete the refurbish
ments, so the University decided to move Ventura Hall in
the process.
The new CIS facility will have many special features to
accommodate the sophisticated research that will go on
in its labs. "The laboratories are isolated from the offices,
and are set on a concrete bloc k, to make them as 'vibra
tion-free' as possible," Beaudouin said,

He added that "the labs themselves will have 100 per
cent HEPA filtered air." One hundred percent HEPA
filtered air, extremely pure air low in suspended parti
cles, is necessary for the fabrication of integrated
circuits, which are so small that they could be con
taminated by normal household dust.

" I here will be space for some of our 'dirty' apparatus
(that would contaminate the lab's pure environment),
including vacuum pumps, and various gasses, in the
basement," Beaudouin said. "All of the air ducting sys
tems will be overhead, and will not contaminate the lab.
"Some the best facilities in industry may be similar,"
he went on, "but as far as universities go, none even
come close.
"\\ e are bringing together some of the strongest facul
ty and staff in the various areas of integrated system re
search and puttingthem in the most sophisticated facility
available at any university."
Construction, originally scheduled to start late this
spring, may be delayed until October, Beaudouin said,
but if there are no major setbacks the new facility should
be readv for use bv the beginning of 1984.
