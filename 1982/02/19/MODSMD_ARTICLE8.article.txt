# Stolen check spurs arrest at Tresidder
## 
### 
A woman was arrested yesterday
afternoon at the Wells Fargo bank on
the second floor of Tresidder Union
after bank officials told the Stanford
police that she was trying to cash a
stolen $1600 check.
The suspect, identified as Jodi Staf
ford of San Jose, was booked on
charges of "check forgery" and
possesion of stolen property at the
Elmwood Women's Detention Cen
ter in Milpitas, where she is still being
held on $16,000 bail, according to ar
resting officer Del Bandy.
After subsequent investigation,
Handy said police learned Stafford
was wanted on a drug-related felony
charge in Alameda County. He said
that because Stafford failed to appear
in court on her previous charge she
had forfeited a $10,000 bond.
Bandv said police determined that
Stafford's identification was stolen
and that it was connected to an auto
burglary in San Jose. Immediately af
ter the arrest, Stafford falsely identi
fied herself, according to Bandy.
Wells Fargo officials declined to
comment on the incident. Stafford is
not affiliated with the University.
