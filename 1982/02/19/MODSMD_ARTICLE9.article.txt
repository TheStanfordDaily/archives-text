## 'Network' promotes class unity 
### Rose Chan 
Shrill conversations rose above the din
of clattering plates and buzzing micro
phones. It seemed a typical night at the
Coffee House. But scattered among the
old house regulars were some new and
younger faces — faces that belonged to
members of Stanford's sophomore class.
The spotlight at the Coffee House last
night focused on the talents of the Class of
1984. Sponsored by STAN (Student-Alum
ni Network), the Sophomore Talent/
No-Talent Show supplied a relaxing eve
ning of music, comedy and class
camaraderie. Those sophomores present
came to watch and to support friends ap
pearing on stage.
Gordon Hecker and Pam Wilson headed
the recruiting and publicity committees
for the event. The first 100 sophomores to
show up received fifty-cent coupons good
toward any Coffee House purchase. Em
cees John Affeldt and Brian Mariscal
opened the show at 9 p.m., and Lisa Lovett
joined them later in the evening.
The event's sponsor, STAN, is a year-old
organization aimed at promoting class ac
tivities for freshmen, sophomores and jun
iors. "After freshman year, or even after
freshman orientation, the class dissipates
and you never again have class activities,"
said Hecker.
"One of the major goals of STAN has
been to promote class unity. The idea of
have study breaks or a talent show is a great
opportunity to see old friends you don't
have time to see anymore," Hecker ex
plained.
STAN is the brainchild of Margo Nelson,
the director of classes and student services

at Bowman Alumni House who is de
scribed by Hecker as a "power house."
Nelson said, " It didn't seem to make sense
that we should only have programs for sen
iors."
A graduate of the Class of 1978, Nelson
used the contacts she had made as an R.A.
and as an academic advisor to get people
together for the then unnamed organiza
tion's first meeting in January of last year.
"The first problem we had last year was
an identity crisis," said Hecker. "We had
an organization. We had to figure out what
we wanted to do with it. Financial prob
lems last year were limiting, but we were
still able to put on major productions," he
said.
For the freshman luau held last spring,
STAN representatives requested dona
tions of punch and food from individual
dorms. Expectations momentarily
dropped as the STAN project found less
enthusiastic support in the four-class
dorms. "That's why it's so important that
we got the fee assessment," said Hecker.
"It would be silly to have first the
freshmen, then the sophomores, then the
juniors come to make requests," Hecker
explained.
"We're really looking forward to spring
quarter," said Hecker. "We're hoping to
have a major event for each class during
the spring," he added. A "re-orientation"
for the sophomores is one possibility for a
STAN event.
The success of last year's freshman luau
has been incentive for the luau which the
freshman committee plans to stage this
coming spring. An example of a STAN
project on a smaller scale is the junior class

ice cream study break scheduled for Feb
ruary 23.
"What I really like about it (STAN) is the
tremendous diversity within it," Hecker
said. "We have some degree of interaction
with all four classes at ameeting. I know
what each class is up to and within the
committees we have the opportunity to
meet other sophomores," said Hecker.
STAN is also in close touch with Univer
sity administrators. "University officials
come in and talk to us at meetings," said
committee member Lisa Hudson. "We're
aware of how the University works. We're
sort of informed public servants."
Although STAN was founded primarily
to promote unity among freshmen,
sophomores and juniors, it does have
projects which serve seniors as well. The
most established STAN project is the Con
tact Service which was started by the
Alumni Association three years ago. Up
dated listings are housed at Bowman
Alumni House and give information on
alumni living in about a doz
en geographicallocations covering the East
Coast, the Bay Area, Southern California,
the Midwest and Southwest.
This past week, STAN held a human
biology get together as part of their ongo
ing Experience-by-Degrees program. Re
ceptions for Economics and Psychology
majors and prospective majors are next on
their calendar.
A Day-on-the-Job program is another
STAN project soon to start serving stu
dents, and the Summer Employment Ser
vice should be available in March. "We are
now in the age where you need a lot of
contacts," said Nelson.

The success of last year's freshman luau
has been incentive for the luau which the
freshman committee plans to stage this
coming spring. An example of a STAN
project on a smaller scale is the junior class

ice cream study break scheduled for Feb
ruary 23.
"What I really like about it (STAN) is the
tremendous diversity within it," Hecker
said. "We have some degree of interaction
with all four classes at ameeting. I know
what each class is up to and within the
committees we have the opportunity to
meet other sophomores," said Hecker.
STAN is also in close touch with Univer
sity administrators. "University officials
come in and talk to us at meetings," said
committee member Lisa Hudson. "We're
aware of how the University works. We're
sort of informed public servants."
Although STAN was founded primarily
to promote unity among freshmen,
sophomores and juniors, it does have
projects which serve seniors as well. The
most established STAN project is the Con
tact Service which was started by the
Alumni Association three years ago. Up
dated listings are housed at Bowman
Alumni House and give information on
alumni living in about a doz
en geographicallocations covering the East
Coast, the Bay Area, Southern California,
the Midwest and Southwest.
This past week, STAN held a human
biology get together as part of their ongo
ing Experience-by-Degrees program. Re
ceptions for Economics and Psychology
majors and prospective majors are next on
their calendar.
A Day-on-the-Job program is another
STAN project soon to start serving stu
dents, and the Summer Employment Ser
vice should be available in March. "We are
now in the age where you need a lot of
contacts," said Nelson.

CLASS ACTS — As part of the Student Alumni Network's efforts to promote class unity,
sophomore members sponsored a talent show held last night in the Coffee House.
Shrill conversations rose above the din
of clattering plates and buzzing micro
phones. It seemed a typical night at the
Coffee House. But scattered among the
old house regulars were some new and
younger faces — faces that belonged to
members of Stanford's sophomore class.
The spotlight at the Coffee House last
night focused on the talents of the Class of
1984. Sponsored by STAN (Student-Alum
ni Network), the Sophomore Talent/
No-Talent Show supplied a relaxing eve
ning of music, comedy and class
camaraderie. Those sophomores present
came to watch and to support friends ap
pearing on stage.
Gordon Hecker and Pam Wilson headed
the recruiting and publicity committees
for the event. The first 100 sophomores to
show up received fifty-cent coupons good
toward any Coffee House purchase. Em
cees John Affeldt and Brian Mariscal
opened the show at 9 p.m., and Lisa Lovett
joined them later in the evening.
The event's sponsor, STAN, is a year-old
organization aimed at promoting class ac
tivities for freshmen, sophomores and jun
iors. "After freshman year, or even after
freshman orientation, the class dissipates
and you never again have class activities,"
said Hecker.
"One of the major goals of STAN has
been to promote class unity. The idea of
have study breaks or a talent show is a great
opportunity to see old friends you don't
have time to see anymore," Hecker ex
plained.
STAN is the brainchild of Margo Nelson,
the director of classes and student services

at Bowman Alumni House who is de
scribed by Hecker as a "power house."
Nelson said, " It didn't seem to make sense
that we should only have programs for sen
iors."
A graduate of the Class of 1978, Nelson
used the contacts she had made as an R.A.
and as an academic advisor to get people
together for the then unnamed organiza
tion's first meeting in January of last year.
"The first problem we had last year was
an identity crisis," said Hecker. "We had
an organization. We had to figure out what
we wanted to do with it. Financial prob
lems last year were limiting, but we were
still able to put on major productions," he
said.
For the freshman luau held last spring,
STAN representatives requested dona
tions of punch and food from individual
dorms. Expectations momentarily
dropped as the STAN project found less
enthusiastic support in the four-class
dorms. "That's why it's so important that
we got the fee assessment," said Hecker.
"It would be silly to have first the
freshmen, then the sophomores, then the
juniors come to make requests," Hecker
explained.
"We're really looking forward to spring
quarter," said Hecker. "We're hoping to
have a major event for each class during
the spring," he added. A "re-orientation"
for the sophomores is one possibility for a
STAN event.
