# Labor squabbles persist at T & C
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
A grocery store near campus has become the
focus of a labor-management battle involving
unionization, accusations of unfair hiring practices
and alleged state health code violations.
Former employees of the Town and Country
Market have been picketing the store in the Town
and Country Village shopping center since it re
opened under new ownership last Monday.
The employees, who are all members of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Local 428,
say the new owner, John Meany, fired them
without even 24 hours notice and refused to ac
cept the old employees' requests to submit new
job applications.
"They (the new owner) wouldn't even take my
application and they wouldn't take some of the
others' too. I even said I'd go out of the union,"
said Jo Anna Valentine, a 12-year employee of the
old market.
But Meany said the workers' allegations are un
true. "The employees' jobs were terminated
before we took over," he said. "All we're trying to
do is run a store. We didn't terminate anyone . . .
We're just a victim of circumstances."
Meany, who also owns John's Valley Foods in
Portola Valley, said when he bought the Town and
Country Market he brought over employees from
the other store and hired a few of the former mar
ket's workers to fill any empty jobs.
"We hired back what we felt we could use and

when the store starts doing well,we'll hire some
others . . . but it's not the case that we won't accept
(old employees) applications. Anyone can submit
an application," he said.
Meany said he hired four or five former employ
ees. But Albert Manzano, one of the fired employ
ees, said only one employee has been rehired.
That employee may face some kind of union fine
for her actions, he said.
Meany claimed the crux of the issue is
unionization. He said he has no objections to his
workers unionizing, but "they (the picketers) are
trying to force our employees to join the union
without a choice," he said.
Manzano and the other picketing workers said
Meany should have honored their union contracts
and then renegotiated when those contracts ex
pired.
"The store has always been union. He was sup
posed to sign a union contract and then he could
do what he wanted to do after," he said.
Employees of Meany's Portola Valley store do
not belong to the union. About five years ago,
Meany said, union members tried to force his em
ployees to join the union by forcing an election
vote. The union's efforts were unsuccessful at that
time.
Both the Teamsters Union and the Santa Clara
County Labor Council are respecting the strikers'
picket line. For Meany, this means difficulty in
keeping shelves stocked.
"I have to get the supervisors of the (goods)
companies, who are not union members, todothe

deliveries. It just means a lot more hassles for us,"
he said.
But Manzano said Meany has more trouble with
deliveries than he asserts. He said picketers have
seen meat brought into the store in the back of a
Pinto. "We took pictures of the car with the (meat)
blood stains . . . that violates the state health
codes," he said.
Meany said all goods have been brought in ac
cording to the state health laws. "Everything is
coming in exactly under the law," he said.
Manzano and the strikers have submitted the
pictures to the California State Board of Health.
That office will look into the allegations and then
write its report.
Both sides say they can see no direct end to the
strike at this time The picketers "are turning the
customers away like mad," according to Manzano.
"Our clientele know us. They're not coming
back," he said.
Meany said it is hard to judge if his business has
been hurt by the strike. "Business is certainly not
down from the way it was under the previous
owner. It is hard to say. We may only be hurt by
past history. After all, the past owner went
bankrupt . . . and the pickets showed up when we
opened," he said.
The previous owner, Cole Bridges, declared a
form of bankruptcy and the store's jurisdiction
passed to the State Board of Trade last November.
The Town and Country Shopping Center took over
management until Meany acquired ownership.

job applications.
"They (the new owner) wouldn't even take my
application and they wouldn't take some of the
others' too. I even said I'd go out of the union,"
said Jo Anna Valentine, a 12-year employee of the
old market.
But Meany said the workers' allegations are un
true. "The employees' jobs were terminated
before we took over," he said. "All we're trying to
do is run a store. We didn't terminate anyone . . .
We're just a victim of circumstances."
Meany, who also owns John's Valley Foods in
Portola Valley, said when he bought the Town and
Country Market he brought over employees from
the other store and hired a few of the former mar
ket's workers to fill any empty jobs.
"We hired back what we felt we could use and

when the store starts doing well,we'll hire some
others . . . but it's not the case that we won't accept
(old employees) applications. Anyone can submit
an application," he said.
Meany said he hired four or five former employ
ees. But Albert Manzano, one of the fired employ
ees, said only one employee has been rehired.
That employee may face some kind of union fine
for her actions, he said.
Meany claimed the crux of the issue is
unionization. He said he has no objections to his
workers unionizing, but "they (the picketers) are
trying to force our employees to join the union
without a choice," he said.
Manzano and the other picketing workers said
Meany should have honored their union contracts
and then renegotiated when those contracts ex
pired.
"The store has always been union. He was sup
posed to sign a union contract and then he could
do what he wanted to do after," he said.
Employees of Meany's Portola Valley store do
not belong to the union. About five years ago,
Meany said, union members tried to force his em
ployees to join the union by forcing an election
vote. The union's efforts were unsuccessful at that
time.
Both the Teamsters Union and the Santa Clara
County Labor Council are respecting the strikers'
picket line. For Meany, this means difficulty in
keeping shelves stocked.
"I have to get the supervisors of the (goods)
companies, who are not union members, todothe

deliveries. It just means a lot more hassles for us,"
he said.
But Manzano said Meany has more trouble with
deliveries than he asserts. He said picketers have
seen meat brought into the store in the back of a
Pinto. "We took pictures of the car with the (meat)
blood stains . . . that violates the state health
codes," he said.
Meany said all goods have been brought in ac
cording to the state health laws. "Everything is
coming in exactly under the law," he said.
Manzano and the strikers have submitted the
pictures to the California State Board of Health.
That office will look into the allegations and then
write its report.
Both sides say they can see no direct end to the
strike at this time The picketers "are turning the
customers away like mad," according to Manzano.
"Our clientele know us. They're not coming
back," he said.
Meany said it is hard to judge if his business has
been hurt by the strike. "Business is certainly not
down from the way it was under the previous
owner. It is hard to say. We may only be hurt by
past history. After all, the past owner went
bankrupt . . . and the pickets showed up when we
opened," he said.
The previous owner, Cole Bridges, declared a
form of bankruptcy and the store's jurisdiction
passed to the State Board of Trade last November.
The Town and Country Shopping Center took over
management until Meany acquired ownership.

TOWN & COUNTRY MARKET — Disgruntled workers at the market
have walked a picket line since Monday, when new owners assumed
control of the store following a bankruptcy.
A grocery store near campus has become the
focus of a labor-management battle involving
unionization, accusations of unfair hiring practices
and alleged state health code violations.
Former employees of the Town and Country
Market have been picketing the store in the Town
and Country Village shopping center since it re
opened under new ownership last Monday.
The employees, who are all members of the
United Food and Commercial Workers Local 428,
say the new owner, John Meany, fired them
without even 24 hours notice and refused to ac
cept the old employees' requests to submit new
job applications.
"They (the new owner) wouldn't even take my
application and they wouldn't take some of the
others' too. I even said I'd go out of the union,"
said Jo Anna Valentine, a 12-year employee of the
old market.

true. "The employees' jobs were terminated
before we took over," he said. "All we're trying to
