# International flavor graces life of former diplomat, teacher
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
When 76-year-old George Duca left his
teaching position with Stanford last Septem
ber, it might easily have been thought that
the quick-witted gentleman had been on
campus 40 years; after all, one does not be
come an academic adviser, an under
graduate specials teacher and a visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution overnight
. . . unless they're George Duca.
Duca arrived here only six and a half years
ago, leaving behind 20 years of diplomatic
service for Romania and a lifetime of interna
tional service. In these six years, he has be
come renowned for his great personal
warmth and interest in his students as well as
for his popular classes. Duca spends many
extra hours with his students, sharing worries
and joys.
What brought this talented and rare man
to the farm? "At the age of 70, I decided to
leave my position in New York/'explained
Duca. "I wanted to be master of my inde
pendence, you see, free to pick my own
times and places for once. And I wanted very
much to work with and help young people,
so I sold and gave away all my possessions —
yes, yes, almost everything I owned except
for some clothes — and I came here."
And help people Duca has. Through his re
lationships with colleagues and students,

Duca has offered his insight to life and its
meaning.
"What has this life taught me you ask? First
and above all, the paramount importance of
man; human beings are fascinating. This,
and these three things —love, compassion
and tolerance — are the most important. If
you have missed these, not shown love and
affection, you've missed the big things in life,
because they're what it's really all about.
Duca had an additional mission in coming
West. As the child of lon G. Duca, leader of
Rumania's Liberal Party and one-time Prime
Minister and Princess Aleandrine Morusi
(whose ancestry traces back to Byzantine
times), Duca received a grant from Hoover
to edit for publication his father's memoirs.
He had donated them to Hoover's Romanian
collection some time earlier. These valuable
papers document the colossal events of 20th
century Europe before 1933.
But Duca's own memoirs are filled with
unique reminiscences as well as memories
from a life-time of viewing changing worlds
and traveling the globe. By the age of 22,
Duca had left his homeland and was living on
his own as a member of the Romanian Em
bassy In Washington, D.C.. For the following
12 years (1928-1939) Duca traveled about the
world representing Romania in Tokyo, Rio
De Janeiro and again in Washington. Master

of four languages — Romanian, German,
French, English, as well as a working knowl
edge of Swedish and Portuguese — Duca
was sell-suited to the international lifestyle.
In 1939, with the advent of World War 11,
Duca returned home to serve his country as
Assistant Chief of the Political Divison of the
Foreign Service and later as the Head of Per
sonnel in Bucharest.
By 1942, Duca's diplomatic talents again
found him abroad, this time in Finland as
Charge d'Affairs. Helping with covert nego
ciations at Stockholm as a representative of
the King of Romania and Romania's Demo
cratic Opposition, Duca was instrumental in
bringing his county under the wing of the Al
lies during this period.
But being part of one of Romania's most
influential political families brought tragedy
as well as fortune to Duca. In 1933, Duca's
father was assassinated by fascists, less than a
year after the liberal-minded leader had
ascended to power as Prime Minister. Then,
in the early 19405, the communists seized
control of Duca's Romania.
One wonders at Duca's good humor and
compassion, which have prevailed despite
these great personal and national tragedies.
This optimism does not mitigate Duca's in
tense feelings about his losses, however.
"No, I will never return to Romania," he

stated resolutely. "It is not my country any
more. Under such a criminal regime I could
not go back." And about his father Duca
said, "They say my father was one of the
greatest speakers of the century. But I saw
very little of him; he was very busy, and had
little time for me."
After the communist take-over, Duca im
migrated to the United States and settled in
New York City. From 1947 until 1958, Duca
continued to support the Romanians by
working for the Romanian Welfare Program,
Free Europe Inc. and other organizations.
But in 1958, Duca's oratory gift resituated
him overseas, this time in Japan. Duca stayed
there for two years as a Free Europe repre
sentative, lecturing about democracy versus
totalitarianism at 17 universities and visiting
villages across the county, accompanied by
his students.
Duca returned to the States in 1961, just in
time to take on the position of Executive Di
rector for the Federation of French Al
liances, the world's largest cultural organiza
tion. "They had me criss-crossing America,
lecturing at universities, schools and local
groups about French history and culture. I
was proud of this job and enjoyed it im
mensely.
"I saw most of this country in my travels
and I found that the further I discovered it,

the less I knew it. America has a puzzling va
riety of contradictory currents running
through it. One cannot easily put labels on
them," said Duca.
Coping with a busy and sometimes stormy
life was made easier for Duca through his
daily writing.
"I never felt confused, because since the
age of 13 I've had my diary as an anchor. It's
64 volumes now, illustrated with pictures of
all my friends and travels," admitted Duca
(Selections of this documentary work were
on display in the Hoover Library when the
diary accomplished 60 years).
Despite his love of worldwide travel and
this unifying thread in his life, Duca returned
from his American tour ready for a dramatic
change. Thus, in 1975, he came to Stanford,
and began working on his father's — and his
own — memoirs.
Duca's zest and genuine affection for stu
dents quickly brought him further involve
ment with Stanford. He was soon teaching a
series of freshman and undergraduate spe
cials and seminars, acting as an academic ad
viser, and befriending many. In fact, Duca's
busy schedule had him up at 4 a.m. each day,
writing and attending to his responsibilites.
This September, however, Duca decided
not to teach anymore, allowing himself more
time to prepare his memoirs.

riety of contradictory currents running
through it. One cannot easily put labels on
them," said Duca.
Coping with a busy and sometimes stormy
life was made easier for Duca through his
daily writing.
"I never felt confused, because since the
age of 13 I've had my diary as an anchor. It's
64 volumes now, illustrated with pictures of
all my friends and travels," admitted Duca
(Selections of this documentary work were
on display in the Hoover Library when the
diary accomplished 60 years).
Despite his love of worldwide travel and
this unifying thread in his life, Duca returned
from his American tour ready for a dramatic
change. Thus, in 1975, he came to Stanford,
and began working on his father's — and his
own — memoirs.
Duca's zest and genuine affection for stu
dents quickly brought him further involve
ment with Stanford. He was soon teaching a
series of freshman and undergraduate spe
cials and seminars, acting as an academic ad
viser, and befriending many. In fact, Duca's
busy schedule had him up at 4 a.m. each day,
writing and attending to his responsibilites.
This September, however, Duca decided
not to teach anymore, allowing himself more
time to prepare his memoirs.
When 76-year-old George Duca left his
teaching position with Stanford last Septem
ber, it might easily have been thought that
the quick-witted gentleman had been on
campus 40 years; after all, one does not be
come an academic adviser, an under
graduate specials teacher and a visiting
scholar at the Hoover Institution overnight
. . . unless they're George Duca.
Duca arrived here only six and a half years
ago, leaving behind 20 years of diplomatic
service for Romania and a lifetime of interna
tional service. In these six years, he has be
come renowned for his great personal
warmth and interest in his students as well as
for his popular classes. Duca spends many
extra hours with his students, sharing worries
and joys.
What brought this talented and rare man
to the farm? "At the age of 70, I decided to
leave my position in New York/'explained
Duca. "I wanted to be master of my inde
pendence, you see, free to pick my own
times and places for once. And I wanted very
much to work with and help young people,
so I sold and gave away all my possessions —
yes, yes, almost everything I owned except
for some clothes — and I came here."
And help people Duca has. Through his re
lationships with colleagues and students,

Duca has offered his insight to life and its
meaning.
"What has this life taught me you ask? First
and above all, the paramount importance of
man; human beings are fascinating. This,
and these three things —love, compassion
and tolerance — are the most important. If
you have missed these, not shown love and
affection, you've missed the big things in life,
because they're what it's really all about.
Duca had an additional mission in coming
West. As the child of lon G. Duca, leader of
Rumania's Liberal Party and one-time Prime
Minister and Princess Aleandrine Morusi
(whose ancestry traces back to Byzantine
times), Duca received a grant from Hoover
to edit for publication his father's memoirs.
He had donated them to Hoover's Romanian
collection some time earlier. These valuable
papers document the colossal events of 20th
century Europe before 1933.
But Duca's own memoirs are filled with
unique reminiscences as well as memories
from a life-time of viewing changing worlds
and traveling the globe. By the age of 22,
Duca had left his homeland and was living on
his own as a member of the Romanian Em
bassy In Washington, D.C.. For the following
12 years (1928-1939) Duca traveled about the
world representing Romania in Tokyo, Rio
De Janeiro and again in Washington. Master

of four languages — Romanian, German,
French, English, as well as a working knowl
edge of Swedish and Portuguese — Duca
was sell-suited to the international lifestyle.
In 1939, with the advent of World War 11,
Duca returned home to serve his country as
Assistant Chief of the Political Divison of the
Foreign Service and later as the Head of Per
sonnel in Bucharest.
By 1942, Duca's diplomatic talents again
found him abroad, this time in Finland as
Charge d'Affairs. Helping with covert nego
ciations at Stockholm as a representative of
the King of Romania and Romania's Demo
cratic Opposition, Duca was instrumental in
bringing his county under the wing of the Al
lies during this period.
But being part of one of Romania's most
influential political families brought tragedy
as well as fortune to Duca. In 1933, Duca's
father was assassinated by fascists, less than a
year after the liberal-minded leader had
ascended to power as Prime Minister. Then,
in the early 19405, the communists seized
control of Duca's Romania.
One wonders at Duca's good humor and
compassion, which have prevailed despite
these great personal and national tragedies.
This optimism does not mitigate Duca's in
tense feelings about his losses, however.
"No, I will never return to Romania," he

stated resolutely. "It is not my country any
more. Under such a criminal regime I could
not go back." And about his father Duca
said, "They say my father was one of the
greatest speakers of the century. But I saw
very little of him; he was very busy, and had
little time for me."
After the communist take-over, Duca im
migrated to the United States and settled in
New York City. From 1947 until 1958, Duca
continued to support the Romanians by
working for the Romanian Welfare Program,
Free Europe Inc. and other organizations.
But in 1958, Duca's oratory gift resituated
him overseas, this time in Japan. Duca stayed
there for two years as a Free Europe repre
sentative, lecturing about democracy versus
totalitarianism at 17 universities and visiting
villages across the county, accompanied by
his students.
Duca returned to the States in 1961, just in
time to take on the position of Executive Di
rector for the Federation of French Al
liances, the world's largest cultural organiza
tion. "They had me criss-crossing America,
lecturing at universities, schools and local
groups about French history and culture. I
was proud of this job and enjoyed it im
mensely.
"I saw most of this country in my travels
and I found that the further I discovered it,

the less I knew it. America has a puzzling va
