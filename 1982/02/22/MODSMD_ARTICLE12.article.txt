## Jeff Phillips Democratic spinelessness 
### 
For once I agree with President
Ronald Reagan. His recent challenge
to the "paid political complainers" to
"put up or shut up" makes him the
early favorite for the 1982 Spiro T.
Agnew Nattering Nobobs of
Negativism Award which is given
each year for the most flowery put
down of the preachers of gloom and
doom. Let's face it, even a Daily col
umnist could shoot holes in Reagan's
economic policy, but the response to
his policies from the Democrats sug
gests they have a severe case of "na
tional malaise."
If Reagan is assaulting the econo
my, the Democrats are acting like the
typical private citizen. They are re
pulsed, but they are too self-serving
to become constructively involved.
We have the coalition of conserva
tive Southern Democrats, the so
called 801 l Weevils, who didn't have
the guts to stand up to Reagan in '81
and now don't have the guts to stand
up with him in '82. It's as if there are a
hundred backbone-less Jimmy
Carter clones in the Congress.
The Republicans have claimed that
many government programs are not
solving the problems they were ori
ginally advertised as being able to
solve. A drive through the inner
neighborhoods of any of our major
cities would convince most people
that they are at least partly right. Hav
ing sensed this failure, they now sug
gest we should just give up after one
attempt. I only wish Reagan would
have come to the same conclusion af
ter his first unsuccessful attempt for
the presidency. Clean air and free
dom from hunger are far too impor
tant to give up on simply because
they are hard to achieve.
On the other hand, mainly be
cause they were their ideas in the first
place, the Democrats refuse to ac
knowledge the programs have faults
and suggest only that we do not cut
them back quite so much. While I am
in total agreement with the rationale
behind the original programs, I find
the Democrats' current defense of
them depressing. If .the programs
aren't working, they need improve
ment, not continued mediocrity.
Part of the blame for the lack of in

novative approaches to our troubles
falls on the budgetary process itself
which allows quantitative, but not
qualitative, changes in government
functions. Even more of the blame
falls on the Democratic Party's lack of
imagination. They have not had an
original idea since Reagan's election.
At least the President has exposed
us to supply-side economics, the
New Federalism and Urban Free En
terprise Zones. The Democrats have
been quick to say the latter won't
work, but they have not been so
quick with alternative proposals to
cure the inner cities' chronic un
employment blues.

If Reagan is assaulting
the economy, the
Democrats are acting
like the typical private
citizen. They are
repulsed but they are
too selfâ€”serving to
become
constructively
involved.

The argument that things would be
better if Jimmy Carter had been
elected holds little weight. While he
surely would have had the sense not
to spend billions on thousands of nu
clear warheads, there was nothing
said in his campaign to suggest he
would have used any new ap
proaches to solving our economic
woes. His four years as president pro
duced no domestic programs or poli
cy of note save for the Departments
of Energy and Education which were
really only enlargements of the pro
grams of previous administrations.
I could tell you how John An
derson would have solved all our
problems if he had been elected, and

I could also tell you how I would have
been an All-America wide receiver if
I had only made my undergraduate
school's football team, but I won't. I
will only say Anderson at least re
alized neither wishful thinking nor
business as usual would solve our ec
onomic problems.
If the Democratic Party hopes to
hold its own in the 1982 elections, it
better start developing a constructive
policy for economic recovery that
separates the Party from both the
trickle down policy of the Re
publicans and its ineffective "throw
some-money-at-it" policies of the
past. Come November, without a
coherent second choice, even Rea
ganomics (or not voting at all) will
look good to John and Jane Q. Pub
lic.
Whether the Democrats will be
able to present such a choice is
doubtful. No one speaks for the
Democratic party these days. House
Speaker Tip O'Neill (D-Mass) can't
even control his end of the Capitol,
while Senate Minority Leader Robert
Byrd (D-WVa) has the personality of
tapioca pudding. Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass) and former Vice-
President Walter Mondale have na
tionwide recognition but may be too
associated with the failed policies of
the past to be effective spokesmen
for the future.
The Party should spotlight some of
its young mavericks such as Ken
nedy's colleague from Massachu
setts, Paul Tsongas and Senator Gary
Hart (D-Col), who took his lumps as
George McGovern's campaign man
ager in the 1972 slaughter. It should
also encourage new candidates with
fresh ideas to take on the endless
stream of right-wing Republican
newcomers.
Should the Democrats, instead,
choose to take the easy way out and
continue to criticize Reagan ad in
finitum, our "acting president" will
continue to taunt them to "put up or
shut up" and will score political
points every time he does.
