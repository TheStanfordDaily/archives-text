## Philippine extradition a mockery 
### 
Not content with having con
vinced his people that a "revolution
from the top" has saved them the
trauma of a "revolution from
below," Ferdinand Marcos, Presi
dent of the Republic of the Philip
pines, means to legitimate the legal
ized extension of martial rule to the
Filipino community in the U.S. . The
U.S.-Republic of Philippines (RP). An
extradition treaty now awaiting ratifi
cation in the U.S. Senate will enable
Marcos to ask for extradition of
Filipinos and American citizens de
emed to have committed acts that are
considered criminal by both govern
ments.
While the proposed treaty lists 42
such crimes, it states unequivocally
that other unlisted crimes could also
constitute a basis for extradition. The
treaty provides that "extradition shall
not be granted if the offense for
which it is requested is political, or is
connected with a political offense,"
but the deciding authority will be the
executive branch, insteadof the judi
ciary. In other words, this means that
the executive will have the legal right
to determine the "political offense
exception," i.e. to decide whether
extradition requests are based on po
litical motivations, or on valid crimi
nal grounds.
There is of course little doubt that
repressive regimes like that of
Marcos could easily prepare a sophis
ticated allegation of probable cause
for the commission of common
crimes to be used as a smokescreen
for political arrests. In fact, in antici
pation of the treaty being ratified, the
regime in the Philippines has already

filed charges in Manila against its
"U.S.-based opponents."
Extradition for political reasons is
banned under the current U.S. ex
tradition laws. But, three Senate bills
have already been introduced to re
vise the law in order to eliminate pro
cedural delays in extradition, and to
make the process smoother and
more effective. Proponents of
stronger extradition treaties in the
U.S. are piqued by the "procedural
protection" that hampers the proc
ess and even makes it open to re
versal.
Often cited is the case of Ziyad Abu
Eain, a Palestinian whose extradition
to Israel last December took more
than two years to process. Of course,
the officials also want to avoid a re
peat of the case of two Irish Re
publican Army (IRA) members
whose alleged "crimes" were proven
in a U.S. court to have been political,
thus excluding them from being ex
tradited under the U.S.-British ex
tradition agreement. Obviously, the
bills in Congress are aimed at block
ingall possibilities that might delayor
prevent actual extradition.
It is clear why the Reagan Adminis
tration wants to humor Marcos in ev
ery possible way. The Philippines
hosts the two largest American mili
tary bases outside the United States
— bases whose military capacity
reaches as far as Southeast Asia and
the Near East. And, Reagan knows
that his ability to secure the region
dependsa great dealon Marcos'con
tinued power. Assured of U.S. sup
port, Marcos isall settospread his re
pressive tactics across continents.

Professor Richard Ealk of Prince
ton's international law department,
in his testimony opposing the treaty
at a congressional hearing, succintly
summed up what the real implica
tions of the treaty are. "One has to
view with certain alarm the nego
tiations of treaties such as the pend
ing U.S.-Philippine Extradition Treaty
because here we have a situation
where a foreign government has
consistently manipulated its
domestic law to fabricate charges. ..
that makes therefore a mockery of
the showing of "probable cause' in
our own courts," he said. Falks also
asserted that it was inappropriate, as
a matter of constitutional and human
rights policy, to establish an extradi
tion treaty with such a government
which was inconsistent with the exist
ing laws within the United States.
Viewed in the larger context U.S.
foreign policy, this treaty is in keep
ing with what the administration has
been doing — helping repressive re
gimes which are allied to the U.S. to
stabilize their political environment
vis-a-vis their opponents. To divest
the judicial system of its responsi
bility for determining the nature of
an offense and vest it in the executive
and the vagaries of foreign policy
seems absurd, especially when the
dangers of abuse would be greater
with regimes like the Marcos govern
ment, which has no independent ju
diciary. Under the circumstances,
this virtually amounts to making the
rights of an individual an incident of
foreign policy.

rights of an individual an incident of
foreign policy.

Not content with having con
vinced his people that a "revolution
from the top" has saved them the
trauma of a "revolution from
below," Ferdinand Marcos, Presi
dent of the Republic of the Philip
pines, means to legitimate the legal
ized extension of martial rule to the
Filipino community in the U.S. . The
U.S.-Republic of Philippines (RP). An
extradition treaty now awaiting ratifi
cation in the U.S. Senate will enable
Marcos to ask for extradition of
Filipinos and American citizens de
emed to have committed acts that are
considered criminal by both govern
ments.
While the proposed treaty lists 42
such crimes, it states unequivocally
that other unlisted crimes could also
constitute a basis for extradition. The
treaty provides that "extradition shall
not be granted if the offense for
which it is requested is political, or is
connected with a political offense,"
but the deciding authority will be the
executive branch, insteadof the judi
ciary. In other words, this means that
the executive will have the legal right
to determine the "political offense
exception," i.e. to decide whether
extradition requests are based on po
litical motivations, or on valid crimi
nal grounds.
There is of course little doubt that
repressive regimes like that of
Marcos could easily prepare a sophis
ticated allegation of probable cause
for the commission of common
crimes to be used as a smokescreen
for political arrests. In fact, in antici
pation of the treaty being ratified, the
regime in the Philippines has already

filed charges in Manila against its
"U.S.-based opponents."
Extradition for political reasons is
banned under the current U.S. ex
tradition laws. But, three Senate bills
have already been introduced to re
vise the law in order to eliminate pro
cedural delays in extradition, and to
make the process smoother and
more effective. Proponents of
stronger extradition treaties in the
U.S. are piqued by the "procedural
protection" that hampers the proc
ess and even makes it open to re
versal.
Often cited is the case of Ziyad Abu
Eain, a Palestinian whose extradition
to Israel last December took more
than two years to process. Of course,
the officials also want to avoid a re
peat of the case of two Irish Re
publican Army (IRA) members
whose alleged "crimes" were proven
in a U.S. court to have been political,
thus excluding them from being ex
tradited under the U.S.-British ex
tradition agreement. Obviously, the
bills in Congress are aimed at block
ingall possibilities that might delayor
prevent actual extradition.
It is clear why the Reagan Adminis
tration wants to humor Marcos in ev
ery possible way. The Philippines
hosts the two largest American mili
tary bases outside the United States
— bases whose military capacity
reaches as far as Southeast Asia and
the Near East. And, Reagan knows
that his ability to secure the region
dependsa great dealon Marcos'con
tinued power. Assured of U.S. sup
port, Marcos isall settospread his re
pressive tactics across continents.

Professor Richard Ealk of Prince
ton's international law department,
in his testimony opposing the treaty
at a congressional hearing, succintly
summed up what the real implica
tions of the treaty are. "One has to
view with certain alarm the nego
tiations of treaties such as the pend
ing U.S.-Philippine Extradition Treaty
because here we have a situation
where a foreign government has
consistently manipulated its
domestic law to fabricate charges. ..
that makes therefore a mockery of
the showing of "probable cause' in
our own courts," he said. Falks also
asserted that it was inappropriate, as
a matter of constitutional and human
rights policy, to establish an extradi
tion treaty with such a government
which was inconsistent with the exist
ing laws within the United States.
Viewed in the larger context U.S.
foreign policy, this treaty is in keep
ing with what the administration has
been doing — helping repressive re
gimes which are allied to the U.S. to
stabilize their political environment
vis-a-vis their opponents. To divest
the judicial system of its responsi
bility for determining the nature of
an offense and vest it in the executive
and the vagaries of foreign policy
seems absurd, especially when the
dangers of abuse would be greater
with regimes like the Marcos govern
ment, which has no independent ju
diciary. Under the circumstances,
this virtually amounts to making the
rights of an individual an incident of
foreign policy.
