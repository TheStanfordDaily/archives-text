## CompSci courses reflect 'real life' 
### 
I found Steve Mitchel's recent edi
torial on "Fear and loathing in CS
106" mildly amusing, but it was hard
ly accurate. I completely disagree
with his rather heavy-handed remark
that nobody should take computer
science, that it is a waste of time. I am
teaching CS 105, the partner course
to 106, for my fourth quarter now. I
believe the intro courses in com
puter science to be very worthwhile.
I can believe that Mr. Mitchel might
have had a bad experience with his
course. But that doesn't give him the
right to imply that his negative ex
perience is universal. Let's talk about
facts, not personal gripes.
There is only one complaint about
these courses that I consider to be
universally valid and that is that they
are very time-consuming. My stu
dents last quarter averaged fifty to
sixty hours on the computer for the
quarter, with at least that much time
spent off the computer writing out
the programs ahead of time. We
make no apologies for this. Learning
to program takes a long time for most
people and the only way you learn is
by doing, hours and hours of doing.
If a student doesn't have the time to
devote to this course, then he
shouldn't be taking it. Every instruc
tor makes that very clear the first day
of class.
Mitchel made several complaints
about the computer itself in his arti
cle, talking about having to wait in
line before being able to get on the
computer and having the system ran
domly stop working. My response to
that is that when things like that hap
pen, students are learning about
computers. They are finding out that
computers are not completely re
liable and that computer time is not
cheap. The only time I consider this
to be a valid complaint is when the
unreliability or the overcrowdedness
of the computer becomes in
ordinate. That did happen Winter
Quarter last year and I genuinely felt
sorry for the students who happened

to take the courses that quarter. That
was the quarter when we saw four
and five hour waits to get on the
computer during Dead Week when
everyone was trying to finish their
final projects.
Many people had been saying for
quite some time that the computing
facility was not adequate for our
needs and it became quite apparent
to everyone that quarter that this was
true. That problem has been under
consideration for a long time, and
the University is currently in the
process of making a decision for a
permanent solution. In the mean
time we have been using several
stop-gap solutins which have worked
quite adequately for us. Students
very soon learn which computerthey
are supposed to work on. I spend a
lot of time at CERAS and I can say
from my experience that there has
been no major problem since a year
ago. And provided that the Univer
sity makes a good decision about
what sort of computer facilities to
make available to us on a permanent
basis, things will continue to go
smoothly.
Another of Mitchel's complaints
that I find particularly disturbing is
that the assignments bear no re
semblance to anything in real life. It's
true that in the early stages of the
course the assignments must be
simple because the students don't
know enough of the language to do
intricate problems, but by the time
they get around to doing their final
projects, they know enough to write
fairly substantial, practical programs.
We always try to give out assignments
that are similar to applications of
computers that students will find in
real life, an automated bank teller, an
inventory program, a program to cal
culate taxes, computer games, a pro
gram to generate student grade
sheets and class lists, etc..
I know from looking at course
evaluation statistics that most stu

dents find these courses both en
joyable and rewarding. We allow 360
students to take the courses each
quarter and each quarter the class
lists fill up completely during pre
reg. I expect that Mitchel's article will
not significantly disturb that pattern,
but I know that it upset many people.
I know many people who work hard
to make 105 and 106 good courses,
the instructors and TAs and the peo
ple who work with us at the various
computing facilities.
I, for one, refuse to be phased by
Mitchel's negativism. I think that
almost everyone should take one of
these courses if they can fit it into
their schedule.

Immitation immortality
The shock that accompanies any
bicycle accident is especially disturb
ing here at the University. Stanford
students, on the whole, seem to har
bor a belief in their immortality. One
constantly observes students riding
their bikes with hands in their
pockets, riding without braking for
stop signs and weaving in and out of
automobile traffic. Perhaps a youth
ful zeal coupled with the advantages
and rewards that reflect a Stanford
education lead to this sense of special
exemption from harm.
However, our world, (as far as we
know), is not the one of Heaven Can
Wait nor even of Stanford Can Wait.
It is a world with constant reminders
of reality. If a student can learn to
take the constant precaution of lock
ing a bike, so can he/she learn the re
alities of personal harm. At the min
imum, ride with a light, obey basic
traffic laws and look out for the unex
pected. Even Stanford students
bleed.

The shock that accompanies any
bicycle accident is especially disturb
ing here at the University. Stanford
students, on the whole, seem to har
bor a belief in their immortality. One
constantly observes students riding
their bikes with hands in their
pockets, riding without braking for
stop signs and weaving in and out of
automobile traffic. Perhaps a youth
ful zeal coupled with the advantages
and rewards that reflect a Stanford
education lead to this sense of special
exemption from harm.
However, our world, (as far as we
know), is not the one of Heaven Can
Wait nor even of Stanford Can Wait.
It is a world with constant reminders
of reality. If a student can learn to
take the constant precaution of lock
ing a bike, so can he/she learn the re
alities of personal harm. At the min
imum, ride with a light, obey basic
traffic laws and look out for the unex
pected. Even Stanford students
bleed.

I found Steve Mitchel's recent edi
torial on "Fear and loathing in CS
106" mildly amusing, but it was hard
ly accurate. I completely disagree
with his rather heavy-handed remark
that nobody should take computer
science, that it is a waste of time. I am
teaching CS 105, the partner course
to 106, for my fourth quarter now. I
believe the intro courses in com
puter science to be very worthwhile.
I can believe that Mr. Mitchel might
have had a bad experience with his
course. But that doesn't give him the
right to imply that his negative ex
perience is universal. Let's talk about
facts, not personal gripes.
There is only one complaint about
these courses that I consider to be
universally valid and that is that they
are very time-consuming. My stu
dents last quarter averaged fifty to
sixty hours on the computer for the
quarter, with at least that much time
spent off the computer writing out
the programs ahead of time. We
make no apologies for this. Learning
to program takes a long time for most
people and the only way you learn is
by doing, hours and hours of doing.
If a student doesn't have the time to
devote to this course, then he
shouldn't be taking it. Every instruc
tor makes that very clear the first day
of class.
Mitchel made several complaints
about the computer itself in his arti
cle, talking about having to wait in
line before being able to get on the
computer and having the system ran
domly stop working. My response to
that is that when things like that hap
pen, students are learning about
computers. They are finding out that
computers are not completely re
liable and that computer time is not
cheap. The only time I consider this
to be a valid complaint is when the
unreliability or the overcrowdedness
of the computer becomes in
ordinate. That did happen Winter
Quarter last year and I genuinely felt
sorry for the students who happened

to take the courses that quarter. That
was the quarter when we saw four
and five hour waits to get on the
computer during Dead Week when
everyone was trying to finish their
final projects.
Many people had been saying for
quite some time that the computing
facility was not adequate for our
needs and it became quite apparent
to everyone that quarter that this was
true. That problem has been under
consideration for a long time, and
the University is currently in the
process of making a decision for a
permanent solution. In the mean
time we have been using several
stop-gap solutins which have worked
quite adequately for us. Students
very soon learn which computerthey
are supposed to work on. I spend a
lot of time at CERAS and I can say
from my experience that there has
been no major problem since a year
ago. And provided that the Univer
sity makes a good decision about
what sort of computer facilities to
make available to us on a permanent
basis, things will continue to go
smoothly.
Another of Mitchel's complaints
that I find particularly disturbing is
that the assignments bear no re
semblance to anything in real life. It's
true that in the early stages of the
course the assignments must be
simple because the students don't
know enough of the language to do
intricate problems, but by the time
they get around to doing their final
projects, they know enough to write
fairly substantial, practical programs.
We always try to give out assignments
that are similar to applications of
computers that students will find in
real life, an automated bank teller, an
inventory program, a program to cal
culate taxes, computer games, a pro
gram to generate student grade
sheets and class lists, etc..
I know from looking at course
evaluation statistics that most stu

dents find these courses both en
joyable and rewarding. We allow 360
students to take the courses each
quarter and each quarter the class
lists fill up completely during pre
reg. I expect that Mitchel's article will
not significantly disturb that pattern,
but I know that it upset many people.
I know many people who work hard
to make 105 and 106 good courses,
the instructors and TAs and the peo
ple who work with us at the various
computing facilities.
I, for one, refuse to be phased by
Mitchel's negativism. I think that
almost everyone should take one of
these courses if they can fit it into
their schedule.
