## Rogers shines in losses Card drops another pair 
### Mike Oneal 
Maybe all those Puritan re
ligious thinkers were right. You
know — the ones that made
man look like a piece of gum
on God's shoe.
Stanford head basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso must think
so anyway. Life has become
one long and ugly nightmare
for him and his team — a
shaggy dog story with a worn
out punchline. Afterthis week
end's trip to Los Angeles, it
wouldn't be surprising to see
Dißiaso perched atop the dish
waving his fist heavenward and
yelling "What the hell did I do
to you!"
Consider the broad picture.
Months ago, Stanford lost two
of its best players, Keith Jones
and Hans Wichary to academic
problems and injury. Without
their speed, the Cardinal then
slipped into an eight-game los
ing streak. Next, coach Dißiaso
decided to retire after seven
years of losing and last week
two more players, Orlando
Ward and Roger Lemons,
dropped out of the line-up be
cause of injuries. That left Stan
ford to face USC and UCLA, the
two fastest teams in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference, with only
eight players — five starters
and the last three men on the
depth chart.
Furthermore, the Cardinal
had to play the Trojans in the
Sports Arena Friday night and
UCLA in Pauley at noon the
next day. The 14 hours in
between is just about enough
time to drive from Watts to
Westwood.
By 2:30 p.m. Saturday, Bruin
head coach Larry Farmer was
saying, "It's fun to play games
like this," and Stanford was
limping to LAX with a 2-13 rec
ord in league play, 7-17 overall.
The Cardinal lost to USC 74-59
and UCLA 79-53.
Commenting on the Friday-

Saturday afternoon scheduling
which the conference has
taken on extensively this sea
son for television purposes,
Dißiaso said, "I don't think it's
good for the Pac-10. It helps
the gifted teams more than the
onesthat havetowork because
they can look better on TV (Sat
urday). The rich just end up
getting richer."
And poor Stanford keeps on
getting poorer.
Both games this weekend
were lost in the second half.
The Cardinal simply tired out
by then mostly because both
first halfs were spent trying to
run with the speedy Trojans
and Bruins.
But there was another prob
lem. Stanford's leading scorer,
John Revelli (16.7 avg.), failed
to produce up to par in either
game. Slumping to .429 from
his usual .607 field goal per
centage in the four games prior
to the LA trip, Revelli con
tinued to struggle with his shot
underneath this weekend and
ended up with 13 points Friday
and only six Saturday.
Dißiaso, who insists that he
doesn't change his game plan
when Revelli isn't scoring, then
had to rely on forwards Brian
Welch and Johnny Rogers who
both came through admirably.
Welch had 12 points both Fri
day and Saturday and Rogers
hit for 16 and 17 in the two
games.
Senior guard Dwight An
derson spearheaded the Trojan
effort. Easily the fastest and
most exciting guard in the
league, Anderson shot for 18
points and dished off two as
sists — all in overdrive. The
thing about the guy is that he
drives as well as he shoots and
passes from the outside. Look
ing like a faster, bigger and
more talented Nate 'Tiny'
Archibald, he confounded
Stanford by slipping inside and

shooting before the Cardinal
defenders could react.
Anderson'., 12 and senior
forward Mo William's eight
first half points paced USC to a
35-24 halftime lead.
Stanford pulled the game to
within nine points at 16:15 in
the second half, but a "Dwight
Lightning" fast break dunk at
12:35 followed by a Williams
break prompted a Stanford
time out with the score at
51-39. Af*«-* if -it it was all USC.
The UCLA game was much
more interesting — at least in
the first half
Shooting a miserable 32.4
percent from the floor in that
half, the Bruins were unable to
capitalize on a quick 6-2 lead.
At 17:13, Stanford went on a six
point run spurred by a Welch
drive and jumper and held the
lead for the next seven
minutes. UCLA pulled ahead
with five minutes remaining
when forward Mike Sanders
converted four free throws in a
row, and the Bruins headed to
the locker room with a 29-25
lead.
Stanford came out in the sec
ond half looking as if it was seri
ous about breaking the
UCLAn's 11-game win streak. It
wasn't until 14:23 of the second
period that the Bruins took
charge with an eight-point un
answered surge capped by a
Kenny Melds streaking slam
dunk. At that point, Stanford,
losing 48-35, took a time out,
Pauley Pavilion went crazy with
the U-C-L-A cheer and the
Cardinal was finished.
The Bruins ran past a tired
Stanford for six more un
answered points with five
minutes left and took off un
hindered to their 26-point vic
tory.
Fields and junior reserve
guard Michael Holton led
UCLA with 15 points apiece.

tinued to struggle with his shot
underneath this weekend and
ended up with 13 points Friday
and only six Saturday.
Dißiaso, who insists that he
doesn't change his game plan
when Revelli isn't scoring, then
had to rely on forwards Brian
Welch and Johnny Rogers who
both came through admirably.
Welch had 12 points both Fri
day and Saturday and Rogers
hit for 16 and 17 in the two
games.
Senior guard Dwight An
derson spearheaded the Trojan
effort. Easily the fastest and
most exciting guard in the
league, Anderson shot for 18
points and dished off two as
sists — all in overdrive. The
thing about the guy is that he
drives as well as he shoots and
passes from the outside. Look
ing like a faster, bigger and
more talented Nate 'Tiny'
Archibald, he confounded
Stanford by slipping inside and

shooting before the Cardinal
defenders could react.
Anderson'., 12 and senior
forward Mo William's eight
first half points paced USC to a
35-24 halftime lead.
Stanford pulled the game to
within nine points at 16:15 in
the second half, but a "Dwight
Lightning" fast break dunk at
12:35 followed by a Williams
break prompted a Stanford
time out with the score at
51-39. Af*«-* if -it it was all USC.
The UCLA game was much
more interesting — at least in
the first half
Shooting a miserable 32.4
percent from the floor in that
half, the Bruins were unable to
capitalize on a quick 6-2 lead.
At 17:13, Stanford went on a six
point run spurred by a Welch
drive and jumper and held the
lead for the next seven
minutes. UCLA pulled ahead
with five minutes remaining
when forward Mike Sanders
converted four free throws in a
row, and the Bruins headed to
the locker room with a 29-25
lead.
Stanford came out in the sec
ond half looking as if it was seri
ous about breaking the
UCLAn's 11-game win streak. It
wasn't until 14:23 of the second
period that the Bruins took
charge with an eight-point un
answered surge capped by a
Kenny Melds streaking slam
dunk. At that point, Stanford,
losing 48-35, took a time out,
Pauley Pavilion went crazy with
the U-C-L-A cheer and the
Cardinal was finished.
The Bruins ran past a tired
Stanford for six more un
answered points with five
minutes left and took off un
hindered to their 26-point vic
tory.
Fields and junior reserve
guard Michael Holton led
UCLA with 15 points apiece.

ROGERS AND OUT — Stanford freshman forward Johnny
Rogers led Stanford in offense last weekend, but the
Cardinal dropped two more conference games in Los An
geles.
Maybe all those Puritan re
ligious thinkers were right. You
know — the ones that made
man look like a piece of gum
on God's shoe.
Stanford head basketball
coach Dick Dißiaso must think
so anyway. Life has become
one long and ugly nightmare
for him and his team — a
shaggy dog story with a worn
out punchline. Afterthis week
end's trip to Los Angeles, it
wouldn't be surprising to see
Dißiaso perched atop the dish
waving his fist heavenward and
yelling "What the hell did I do
to you!"
Consider the broad picture.
Months ago, Stanford lost two
of its best players, Keith Jones
and Hans Wichary to academic
problems and injury. Without
their speed, the Cardinal then
slipped into an eight-game los
ing streak. Next, coach Dißiaso
decided to retire after seven
years of losing and last week
two more players, Orlando
Ward and Roger Lemons,
dropped out of the line-up be
cause of injuries. That left Stan
ford to face USC and UCLA, the
two fastest teams in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference, with only
eight players — five starters
and the last three men on the
depth chart.
Furthermore, the Cardinal
had to play the Trojans in the
Sports Arena Friday night and
UCLA in Pauley at noon the
next day. The 14 hours in
between is just about enough
time to drive from Watts to
Westwood.
By 2:30 p.m. Saturday, Bruin
head coach Larry Farmer was
saying, "It's fun to play games
like this," and Stanford was
limping to LAX with a 2-13 rec
ord in league play, 7-17 overall.
The Cardinal lost to USC 74-59
and UCLA 79-53.
Commenting on the Friday-

Saturday afternoon scheduling
which the conference has
taken on extensively this sea
son for television purposes,
Dißiaso said, "I don't think it's
good for the Pac-10. It helps
the gifted teams more than the
onesthat havetowork because
they can look better on TV (Sat
urday). The rich just end up
getting richer."
And poor Stanford keeps on
getting poorer.
Both games this weekend
were lost in the second half.
The Cardinal simply tired out
by then mostly because both
first halfs were spent trying to
run with the speedy Trojans
and Bruins.
But there was another prob
lem. Stanford's leading scorer,
John Revelli (16.7 avg.), failed
to produce up to par in either
game. Slumping to .429 from
his usual .607 field goal per
centage in the four games prior
to the LA trip, Revelli con
tinued to struggle with his shot
underneath this weekend and
ended up with 13 points Friday
and only six Saturday.
