# Gymnasts scare California
## 
### Casey Raftery 
Spinning, hurling bodies
characterized the men's and
women's combined gym
nastics meet Friday night at
Maples Pavilion. The women
scored their highest mark of
the season in a sweeping vic
tory over NorCal opponent
Fresno State, and non-con
ference foe Sacramento State,
while the men pulled out a
score of 268.6 to Berkeley's
275.2.
Men's coach Sadao Hamada
commented earlier in the week
that "if all goes well, Cal is still
ten points ahead of us," so the
seven point loss was well on the
mark.
With six teams competing in
a total of eight events — the
balance beam, floor, vault, un
even parallel bars, rings, par

allel bars, high bar, and pom
mel horse — Maples was a
menagerie.
The men were suspended
above the floor on the rings at
the same time the women spun
around the uneven parallel
bars. The women threw dan
gerous tricks on the beam
while the men simultaneously
hurled their bodies around the
high bar.
Highlights of the meet in
cluded Cal'sl9Bl NCAA pom
mel horse champion, Mike
Bergman, who according to
Hamada, "is the best pommel
horse champion in the world,"
and Cal's powerful star, Billy
Paul. The muscular Paul threw
an incredible triple somersault
dismount off the high bar to
win that event. Stanford was

slightly hurt when senior Mike
Lee flew from the high bar in
the middle of his routine, but
he landed on his feet, and
made up for the mistake with a
precise dismount. The men did
exceptionally well on the par
allel bars with senior Jeff
Chung leading the team to a
series of on target dismounts.
The No. 18 Stanford women
were again led by sophomore
All-America Merilyn Chap
man, who gave a spirited per
formance on the floor exercise,
scoring her season and person
al best, a 9.5. The team as a
whole looked lithe and fit,
ready for NCAA regional and
national competition, which
they expect toqualify forat the
NorCal Championships in
March.
