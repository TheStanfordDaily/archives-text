# Hardgrave belts final-inning HR

### Adam Berns 
There's an old saying that
good teams seem to get all the
breaks. When the game is on
the line, and the pressure is on,
the good teams are the ones
that are always able to snatch
victory from defeat.
This weekend, Stanford's
baseball team again showed
the character which it has dis
played all year long and won all
three games they played over
the weekend, pulling out the
final game with a two-run
homer in the bottom of the
seventh inning â€” the final in
ning of that game.
Friday, the Cardinal defeated
Cal-Poly Pomona 5-2.
On Saturday, Stanford swept
a double-header with the Pep
perdine Waves, winning the
first game 4-2, and the second
3-2.
"It was a good series," Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess said
following Saturday's double
header. "All of the games were
close and we weren't really hit
ting. But we were doing
enough to win."
Again it was the Cardinal de
fense which pulled them
through this weekend. While
the offense has been struggl

ing, Stanford's pitching and de
fensive play in the field has
been consistently good.
Pepperdine had an 8-2 rec
ord going into Saturday's con
test and boasted a team batting
average of .330 before meeting
the Cardinal.
In the first game of Satur
day's twin-bill, it didn't take
long for the Cardinal to score.
With one out, first baseman
Mike Aldrete doubled and
then went to third on a passed
ball. He scored moments later
on a ground ball by infielder
Loring Davies, which Wave
shortstop David Rhoades was
unable to handle.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the fifth inning, taking
advantage of Pepperdine mis
takes.
Outfielder Mike Dotterer
reached first base on an error.
Pepperdine's pitcher Jon
Furman then tried to pick Dot
terer off and threw the ball
wildly past first base. Dotterer
moved to third on the bad
throw. Aldrete followed with a
single and Dotterer easily
scored. DavieS singled follow
ing Aldrete's hit putting
runners on first and second
base. A sacrifice bunt by out
fieider Mike Toothman moved
the runners to second and
third. Aldrete then scored by
tagging on a fly ball hit by
catcher Bob Hauslatin.
Pepperdine finally got a run
in the sixth inning when Wave
infielder Martin Montano sin
gled and eventually scored on
a hit by left fielder Doug Fritz.
In the seventh inning, Pep
perdine scored again. Wave in
fielder Ralph Sheffield singled,
stole second, and moved to
third on a wild pitch. He then
scored on a single by right
fielder Dana Saraceno, narrow
ing the game's margin to 3-2.
Stanford came back in the
eighth inning to cushion its
leadto4-2asshortstop Bob De-
Costa scored on a base hit by
designated hitter Eric Hard
grave.
In the second game of the
doubleheader, Pepperdine
scored the games first run in
the third inning. Taking advan
tage of a walk and an error by
Davies, the Wave put runners
on first and second. After a sac
rifice which moved the runners
to second and third, Pep
perdine scored on a fielder's
choice by Fritz.
In the fourth inning, Stan

ford tied the game at 1-1.
Aldrete walked and then
moved to second on a sacrifice
fly. DeCosta then drove him in
with a base hit.
In the top of the seventh in
ning, Wave outfielder Brad
Rierly walked. He moved to
second on a single by infielder
Chris Johnson. The runners
then advanced to second and
third on a sacrifice bunt. The
next batter was intentionally
walked to load the bases.
Saraceno then singled to drive
in a run.
At this point, the Cardinal
made one of the biggest pla>s
of the game. Catcher Rick
Lundblade threw to third
baseman Davies following a
pitch by reliever Mike Sullivan
and picked the runner off.
Davies then threw to second
base and picked off the runner
on second.
In the bottom half of the sev
enth, second baseman Steve
Buechelle singled with one
out. Coach Mark Marquess
then called up Eric Hardgrave
to pinch hit for Lundblade.
With a 1-0 count, Hardgrave
blasted a home run over the
left field fence to give the
Cardinal an exciting 3-2 vic
tory.
