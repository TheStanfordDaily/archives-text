# Hardgrave belts final-inning HR

There's an old saying that
good teams seem to get all the
breaks. When the game is on
the line, and the pressure is on,
the good teams are the ones
that are always able to snatch
victory from defeat.
This weekend, Stanford's
baseball team again showed
the character which it has dis
played all year long and won all
three games they played over
the weekend, pulling out the
final game with a two-run
homer in the bottom of the
seventh inning â€” the final in
ning of that game.
Friday, the Cardinal defeated
Cal-Poly Pomona 5-2.
On Saturday, Stanford swept
a double-header with the Pep
perdine Waves, winning the
first game 4-2, and the second
3-2.
"It was a good series," Stan
ford coach Mark Marquess said
following Saturday's double
header. "All of the games were
close and we weren't really hit
ting. But we were doing
enough to win."
Again it was the Cardinal de
fense which pulled them
through this weekend. While
the offense has been struggl

ing, Stanford's pitching and de
fensive play in the field has
been consistently good.
Pepperdine had an 8-2 rec
ord going into Saturday's con
test and boasted a team batting
average of .330 before meeting
the Cardinal.
In the first game of Satur
day's twin-bill, it didn't take
long for the Cardinal to score.
With one out, first baseman
Mike Aldrete doubled and
then went to third on a passed
ball. He scored moments later
on a ground ball by infielder
Loring Davies, which Wave
shortstop David Rhoades was
unable to handle.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0
lead in the fifth inning, taking
advantage of Pepperdine mis
takes.
Outfielder Mike Dotterer
reached first base on an error.
Pepperdine's pitcher Jon
Furman then tried to pick Dot
terer off and threw the ball
wildly past first base. Dotterer
moved to third on the bad
throw. Aldrete followed with a
single and Dotterer easily
scored. DavieS singled follow
ing Aldrete's hit putting
runners on first and second
