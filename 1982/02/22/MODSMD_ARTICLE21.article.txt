# Davis falters; men win NorCals

### Sally Jenkins 
If the wily and crafty Dick
Gould could co .nt, he would
have known that he didn't have
to be wily and crafty about the
NorCal Intercollegi.iie men's
tennis tournament. Ho just had
to say "Let's rally guvs" and let
his top two doubles teams get
to it.
Stanford carried dwav the
NorCal team title b/ i;iie [joint
Saturday at San jose State,
thanks to an al! Stanford
doubles final that gave them a
34-33 edge on UC-Berkeley.
But the way Cardinal conch
Gould had counted the poin's,
his team didn't have a chance.
Stanford found itself down by
one point to the loathsome
Bears going into the doubles
semi-finals, bnt Gou'd had
counted it up as more like
three or four.
A series of upsets earlier in
the tournament, including No.
1 Cardinal Scott Davis drop
ping like a dead weight to Cal's
Randy Nixon 3-6, 1-6, made it
look like the Stanford might
lose the title for only the sec
ond time in 12 years.
"I thought the best we could
do was come within one or two
points," said Gould. "I'm not
going to count them again," he
laughed. Fortunately his add
ing wasoff, and it was Davisand
partner Jeff Arons who won a
six-pack from Scott Bondurant
and John Corse in the doubles
filial, 6-2 6-3.
Nixon's victory gave Cal a
edge, setting up the Stin
ford-Cai semi-final confronta
tion between Davis-Arons and
Mark McNally and Mark
Woolridge, and Bondurant-
Corse vs. Doug Stone and John
Severly. Davis and Arons strug
gled for about one minute with
the Bears before wrapping up a
friendly two set victory 6-3, 6-4.
But one court away Bond
urant and Corse were leaving
pieces of Stone and Severly
strewn across the court. They
were cheering on their team
mates from courtside before
Davis and Arons reached the
second set, blowing through
the Bears 6-1 6-0.
Davis and Arons ran into
trouble in the second set as
they let match point after
match point slip away after
jumping out to a 5-2 three
game lead. But then Arons
double-faulted away three

points as he served for match.
A Davis forehand into the
net and two double faults put
him in a very large 1-3 hole. He
made it 2-3 with a very large ov
einead on the next point, but
then double-faulted again to
give the Bears the undeserved
game.
The Cards put McNally in the
same 1-3 holeon hisown serve,
a.i Hit was triple match point
again. But an Arons forehand
hit ■!). i.ipc and Davis floated a
backhand return into the net to
even it up. At 3-3 McNally
sliced a backhand drop shot
that twistea and turned its way
into Davis' alley, but he over
ran it and Cal suddenly had a
comeback going with Davis
serving at 5-2.
The so.ihomore's serve
proved too much for the Bears
though, and when McNally's
backhand return went soaring
out at 3-2, and the Cardinal had
the match 6-3 6-4, as well as the
Normal title.
The Cardinal didn't fare as
well earlier in the tournament,
a fact that made Gould just a lit
tle uncomfortable. No one is
quite sure what happened to
Davis in the singles final, and all
Gould could offer up was,
"Nixon happened to him."
Between Nixon's recent im
provement — he moved all the
way from No. 4 singles last year
— and an atrocious serving
match for Davis, it was Cal's sin
gles title this year.
We really had our chances,"
Gould said of the tournament
as a whole. "I was really getting
mad because we lost so many
close matches. And it's not like
Cal didn't lose a lot of guys last
season either. We've been
playing pretty well, but not
quite doing it. Maybe this will
put us over the hump com
petitively."
Two close matches in partic
ular were the most troubling
for him. Junior transfer Mark
McKeen and freshman Paul
Robinson had a chance to up
set Stone and Severly in the
doubles but let three match
points slip away to lose 2-6,6-4,
5-7. Scott Bondurant, seeded
No. 6, also let three match
points go by and was upset by
Brett Dickinson of San Jose
State in the round of 16, 6-3,
2-6, 5-7.

Davis and Arons ran into
trouble in the second set as
they let match point after
match point slip away after
jumping out to a 5-2 three
game lead. But then Arons
double-faulted away three

points as he served for match.
A Davis forehand into the
net and two double faults put
him in a very large 1-3 hole. He
made it 2-3 with a very large ov
einead on the next point, but
then double-faulted again to
give the Bears the undeserved
game.
The Cards put McNally in the
same 1-3 holeon hisown serve,
a.i Hit was triple match point
again. But an Arons forehand
hit ■!). i.ipc and Davis floated a
backhand return into the net to
even it up. At 3-3 McNally
sliced a backhand drop shot
that twistea and turned its way
into Davis' alley, but he over
ran it and Cal suddenly had a
comeback going with Davis
serving at 5-2.
The so.ihomore's serve
proved too much for the Bears
though, and when McNally's
backhand return went soaring
out at 3-2, and the Cardinal had
the match 6-3 6-4, as well as the
Normal title.
The Cardinal didn't fare as
well earlier in the tournament,
a fact that made Gould just a lit
tle uncomfortable. No one is
quite sure what happened to
Davis in the singles final, and all
Gould could offer up was,
"Nixon happened to him."
Between Nixon's recent im
provement — he moved all the
way from No. 4 singles last year
— and an atrocious serving
match for Davis, it was Cal's sin
gles title this year.
We really had our chances,"
Gould said of the tournament
as a whole. "I was really getting
mad because we lost so many
close matches. And it's not like
Cal didn't lose a lot of guys last
season either. We've been
playing pretty well, but not
quite doing it. Maybe this will
put us over the hump com
petitively."
Two close matches in partic
ular were the most troubling
for him. Junior transfer Mark
McKeen and freshman Paul
Robinson had a chance to up
set Stone and Severly in the
doubles but let three match
points slip away to lose 2-6,6-4,
5-7. Scott Bondurant, seeded
No. 6, also let three match
points go by and was upset by
Brett Dickinson of San Jose
State in the round of 16, 6-3,
2-6, 5-7.
If the wily and crafty Dick
Gould could co .nt, he would
have known that he didn't have
to be wily and crafty about the
NorCal Intercollegi.iie men's
tennis tournament. Ho just had
to say "Let's rally guvs" and let
his top two doubles teams get
to it.
Stanford carried dwav the
NorCal team title b/ i;iie [joint
Saturday at San jose State,
thanks to an al! Stanford
doubles final that gave them a
34-33 edge on UC-Berkeley.
But the way Cardinal conch
Gould had counted the poin's,
his team didn't have a chance.
Stanford found itself down by
one point to the loathsome
Bears going into the doubles
semi-finals, bnt Gou'd had
counted it up as more like
three or four.
A series of upsets earlier in
the tournament, including No.
1 Cardinal Scott Davis drop
ping like a dead weight to Cal's
Randy Nixon 3-6, 1-6, made it
look like the Stanford might
lose the title for only the sec
ond time in 12 years.
"I thought the best we could
do was come within one or two
points," said Gould. "I'm not
going to count them again," he
laughed. Fortunately his add
ing wasoff, and it was Davisand
partner Jeff Arons who won a
six-pack from Scott Bondurant
and John Corse in the doubles
filial, 6-2 6-3.
Nixon's victory gave Cal a
edge, setting up the Stin
ford-Cai semi-final confronta
tion between Davis-Arons and
Mark McNally and Mark
Woolridge, and Bondurant-
Corse vs. Doug Stone and John
Severly. Davis and Arons strug
gled for about one minute with
the Bears before wrapping up a
friendly two set victory 6-3, 6-4.
But one court away Bond
urant and Corse were leaving
pieces of Stone and Severly
strewn across the court. They
were cheering on their team
mates from courtside before
Davis and Arons reached the
second set, blowing through
the Bears 6-1 6-0.
