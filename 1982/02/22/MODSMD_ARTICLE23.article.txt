# Netters crush UOP; prepare for Bears

Stanford tore unmercifully
through the University of the
Pacific 9-0 in women's tennis
Saturday in preparation for
tomorrow's first major test
against California.
Stanford improved its record
to 3-0 and dropped only one
set in dismantling UOP.
The Cardinal will be paced in
both singles and doubles by
three-time All-America Alycia
Moulton. Last year, Moulton
teamed with Caryn Copeland
for the Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics for
Women doubles title and fin
ished second in the singles final

"We're going to
be tough. This is
the best team
we've had in my
three years here/'

for the second consecutive
year.
Moulton beat Eve Zim
merman 6-3, 6-2 Saturday, but
Moulton-Copeland struggled
through a three-set — 6-2, 4-6,
6-4 — win in doubles. It was the
only close match the Cardinal
faced all day.
"We (Copeland and
Moulton) haven't played to
gether a lot since last year,"
Copeland said. "We also let up
a little bit since we won the first

set easily. We came back strong
in the third, though."
Stanford dominated the rest
of the matches at the elegant
Marine Club Courts in Stock
ton.
The junior Copeland looks
forward to a good season for
Stanford.
"We're going to be tough,"
Copeland continued. "This is
the best team we've had in my
three years here. We have a lot
of talent, we just have to get ev
eryone going."
Stanford coach Frank Bren
nan has not set a definite line
up for the Berkeley matches,
but it will almost certainly have
Moulton at the No. 1 singles
and Moulton-Copeland at the
No. 1 doubles spots.
The No. 2 singles spot will be
played by either sophomore
Elise Burgin or freshman Kate
Gompert. Copeland, Michelle
Weiss and Linda Gates will bat
tle for the bottom three spots.
Susie Jaeger, recovering from a
car-accident injury, may also
see action.
Copeland respects Califor
nia's power, but feels Stanford
will have no problems if they
play up to their potential.
"Cal is pretty good all the
way down," Copeland said,
"but they aren't as strong as us.
It should be a good match, but
we could win every match if we
play well."
