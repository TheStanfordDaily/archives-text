# Swimmers drown Cal with surprising ease
## 
### Mark Zeigler 
What was touted as a near
even Stanford-California
men's swim meet ended
with Stanford routing the
Bears 76-37 Saturday.
In fact, Stanford, ranked
third nationally, won 11 of
15 swimming events and
qualified people in five
races for the March NCAA
Championships.
Senior Joe Jiminez, who
placed first in the 100-yard
breaststroke (57.56), was
amazed with the Card's per
formance Saturday. "I
didn't think we were going
to beat Cal (ranked sixth) by
such a big margin," Jiminez
said. "I don't think anyone
did."
Juniors Bari Weick and
John Simons won two

events apiece. Weick easily
took firsts in the 1650 and
500 freestyles, qualifying for
the NCAAs in both races. Si
mons, victorious in the 200
individual medly (1:52.02)
and 200 breast (2:05.02), also
finished second behind
teammate Todd Lincoln in
the 400 IM.
Wade Flemons (100
backstroke), John Engs (200
backstroke), and Jon Denny
(200 butterfly) also qualified
for the NCAA Cham
pionships.
Mike Leahey and Spencer
Rogers went 1-2 for the
Cardinal in the three-meter
springboard competition.
Although the Cardinal
held a 21-15 en
tering the one-meter diving
competition, it blew the

dual meet wide open in the
next set of swimming
events. Stanford actually
clinched the decision by the
second diving event and led
60-26 at that point.
For the Bears, only Paolo
Revelli, Dave Boatwright,
Pelle Holmertz, and its 400
free relay team brightened
an otherwise dismal after
noon.
The victory left Stanford
with a dual meet record of
10-2, compared with Cal's
mark of 8-6.
The only events left for
the Cardinal are the Pac-10
and NCAA Championships.
The Pac-10 event is sched
uled for March 4,5, and 6.
The NCAAs come three
weeks later.
