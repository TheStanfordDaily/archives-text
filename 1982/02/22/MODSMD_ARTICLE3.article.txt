Brookings predicts failure of S&Ls
Washington — Continued high interest rates and the cumulative ef
fects of government regulation will cause more than 1000 savings in
stitutions to merge or fail by the end of 1983, according to a Brookings
Institution study to be released today.
Separately, a key congressional leader on financial institution prob
lems, House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St. Germain (D-
R. 1.), proposed yesterday a $7.5 billion emergency fund to help bail out
troubled savings and loan associations, banks and credit unions. He said
it is "imperative" that Congress act quickly on the measure.
Government assistance to troubled or failing savings and loan associa
tions or mutual savings banks hit record levels last year, but that was just
the first installment of a savings-industry merger wave that could cost
federal agencies more than $8 billion, the Brookings study concludes.
Although deposits will continue to be protected and customers will
receive normal financial services during painful transition periods at
various institutions, regulatory agencies face a large administrative and
financial burden, warns Brookings research associate Andrew Carron in
a report on his year-long study.
Because of losses caused by the wide gap between return on mort
gage loans outstanding and the interest that must be paid to attract de
posits, overall industry losses will exceed $9 billion in the 1981-1983 peri
od, reducing the value of the industry by half, he says.
Meanwhile, St. Germain said he would introduce a bill to provide $7.5
billion in assistance to the industry. He said the proposed "Home Mort
gage Capital Stability Fund" is needed because the Reagan adminis
tration has allowed housing construction to slip to "historic lows."
St. Germain said he would introduce his bill tomorrow and plans to
open hearings on it next month. The proposal would let federal regu
latory agencies deposit Treasury funds in financially strapped institu
tions.
In another development, the U.S. League of Savings Associations, an
industry trade group, has mailed a letter to its more than 4000 members,
outlining a proposed new federal agency that could invest in ailing S&Ls
with Treasury subsidies estimated at $10 billion in one year. The pro
posed Community Depository Conservation Corporation would issue
promissory notes to savings and loans to improve their net worth.
The trade group also endorsed a plan designed to resuscitate the sick
housing industry. It would permit lenders to receive an allowance from
the Treasury, offsetting part of the difference between prevailing rates
and the return on low-rate mortgage loans in their portfolios. Under a
third DroDQsal. Treasury and lending-institution money would be used

to subsidize new mortgages.
