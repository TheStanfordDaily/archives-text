Brookings predicts failure of S&Ls
Washington — Continued high interest rates and the cumulative ef
fects of government regulation will cause more than 1000 savings in
stitutions to merge or fail by the end of 1983, according to a Brookings
Institution study to be released today.
Separately, a key congressional leader on financial institution prob
lems, House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St. Germain (D-
R. 1.), proposed yesterday a $7.5 billion emergency fund to help bail out
troubled savings and loan associations, banks and credit unions. He said
it is "imperative" that Congress act quickly on the measure.
Government assistance to troubled or failing savings and loan associa
tions or mutual savings banks hit record levels last year, but that was just
the first installment of a savings-industry merger wave that could cost
federal agencies more than $8 billion, the Brookings study concludes.
Although deposits will continue to be protected and customers will
receive normal financial services during painful transition periods at
various institutions, regulatory agencies face a large administrative and
financial burden, warns Brookings research associate Andrew Carron in
a report on his year-long study.
Because of losses caused by the wide gap between return on mort
gage loans outstanding and the interest that must be paid to attract de
posits, overall industry losses will exceed $9 billion in the 1981-1983 peri
od, reducing the value of the industry by half, he says.
Meanwhile, St. Germain said he would introduce a bill to provide $7.5
billion in assistance to the industry. He said the proposed "Home Mort
gage Capital Stability Fund" is needed because the Reagan adminis
tration has allowed housing construction to slip to "historic lows."
St. Germain said he would introduce his bill tomorrow and plans to
open hearings on it next month. The proposal would let federal regu
latory agencies deposit Treasury funds in financially strapped institu
tions.
In another development, the U.S. League of Savings Associations, an
industry trade group, has mailed a letter to its more than 4000 members,
outlining a proposed new federal agency that could invest in ailing S&Ls
with Treasury subsidies estimated at $10 billion in one year. The pro
posed Community Depository Conservation Corporation would issue
promissory notes to savings and loans to improve their net worth.
The trade group also endorsed a plan designed to resuscitate the sick
housing industry. It would permit lenders to receive an allowance from
the Treasury, offsetting part of the difference between prevailing rates
and the return on low-rate mortgage loans in their portfolios. Under a
third DroDQsal. Treasury and lending-institution money would be used

to subsidize new mortgages.
A Senate bill to facilitate a restructuring of the industry, in
troduced last fall by Banking Committee Chairman Jake
Garn (R-Utah) has been stalled in committee. The delay is
largely the result of determined efforts by competing in
terests in the financial industry to gain — or not lose — any
advantages.
Garn's bill was sharply critized over the weekend by a
coalition of consumer and public-interest groups that called
for its defeat.
Describing the bill as "unsound, anti-housing and anti
consumer legislation."the coalition, led by Ralph Nader's
Public Interest Research Group, contends it would void key
consumer-protection laws, particularly state usury limits.
Thrift institutions —S&Ls in particular — are experiencing
their worst earnings crisis since World War 11. Net worth de
clined 15 percent last yearasthe nation's S&Ls suffered losses
totaling $5 billion.
Despite a wave of voluntary mergers, federal regulators
were forced to arrange nearly two dozen government-as
sisted mergers of failing S&Ls into stronger institutions last
year, and voluntary and supervisory mergers continue to be
the order of the day. Indeed, four Chicago associations were
merged over the weekend to form the nation's seventh-larg
est S&L.
Poland plans to reorganize unions
Warsaw — The Polish government yesterday issued a draft
plan for reorganization of the country's trade-union move
ment. The draft document prohibits unions from engaging
in political activities and from organizing by territorial units,
as did Solidarity, the suspended independent union.
The paper, which has been weeks in preparation, is in
tended to serve as the basis for a national discussion that au
thorities say will precede final passage of an official trade
union bill.
The paper says that all employees will be free to join a
union, except for employees of the Defense Department
and police, the state administration staff, judges and prose
cutors. Solidarity had battled with authorities previously
over the right of police and civil servants to belong to a trade
union.
The right to strike is acknowledged as "the ultimate meas
ure," but the paper goes on to say strikes should not be over
used and it outlaws "political strikes."
The document says that trade unions will be allowed to
carry on their own research and analysis and have their own
press and access to mass media — a point for which Solidarity
long fought. But under the current tight censorship rules, it is
doubtful that even a revived Solidarity will enjoy the same
liberties of publication and broadcast that the union was ap
proaching last year.
It is still unclear to what extent Solidarity leaders now in
terned will be able to participate in the debate on the trade
union movement, or how long the discussion is to last. Gov
ernment officials have indicated, however, that they intend
to ignore comments by political extremists, a category into
which many of Solidarity's unrepenting leadership is placed.
Yesterday's document asserts that the government does
not intend to force any specific idea of rearranging trade
unionson the Polish people, promisingthatthe"voiceof ev
ery honest working man should be heard clearly and firmly."
At the same time it plainly states that the way Solidarity
functioned was unacceptable and that fundamental changes
in the union's charter will be necessary before it will be per
mitted to operate again.
"The trade union movement cannot contribute through
its political activities to the split of society," the paper says,
"spreading anarchy and tensions."
In an apparent attempt to block the kind of contacts with
Western trade organizationsthat lent assistance to Solidarity,
the government's paper says that trade unions "cannot link
with political forces and foreign trade union centers which
are hostile to socialist Poland."
Watt shifts policy on mining
Washington — Interior Secretary James Watt, in a surprise
policy shift, said yesterday that he will ask Congress this week
to enact a bill to forbid mining and drilling in wilderness
areas until the end of the century.
The announcement left some environmentalist groups

stunned at what they saw as a reversal of the administration's
position on wilderness development. Other environmen
talists, however, voiced suspicions of what one called a "Tro
jan horse," containing new threats to the nation's wil
derness.
Watt's statement came on "Meet the Press" (NBC) when
the secretary was asked about his statements that he would
like to open up wilderness areas to oil exploration.
"This week I will ask the Congress. . . to quickly adopt new
legislation that would prohibit the drilling or mining in the
wilderness to the end of the century," Watt said. He said
there would be only "one exception: if there is an urgent na
tional need, the president should then, with the concur
rence of Congress, be allowed to withdraw those few acres
that might be needed to meet that national need."
Watt said in a telephone interview yesterday that his pro
posal includes two deadlines within the next five years, after
which no new wilderness areas could be designated or pro
posed.
The reaction from environmental groups was strong and
mixed:
Tim Mahoney, Washington representative of the Sierra
Club, said he felt the Watt proposal is a "Trojan horse."
Mahoney, noting the deadlines on wilderness proposals,
said the deal amounted to "Watt saying I will protect wil
derness from oil and gas drilling, in return for cutting off the
designation of any new wilderness for ever and ever."
But William Turnage, head of the Wilderness Society, said,
"We congratulate the administration. It is a victory for the
American people and for wilderness preservation.. .. This is
a complete turnaround in administration policy."
Stockman speaks to governors
Washington—Reagan administration budget director
David Stockman yesterday urged the nation's governors to
keep their views of the president's New Federalism program
separate from their complaints about federal budget cuts
that have reduced their state treasuries.
But the nation's governors gave a mixed and often skep
tical reaction yesterday to administration arguments that
there will be "no winners, no losers" under President Ronald
Reagan's "new federalism" proposal.
Although Stockman contended that the budget is a sepa
rate and distinct issue that "really has no bearing" on "new
federalism," many of the governors disagreed.
"Are you saying to me . . . that this deficit is not impor
tant?" New Hampshire Gov. Hugh Gallen, a Democrat,
asked Stockman during a session of the National Governors'
Association.
"I have not suggested anything of the kind," Stockman re
sponded.
Scott Matheson, the Democratic governor of Utah, re
called the White House promise that there would be neither
winners nor losers if the president's plans for swapping fed
eral and state programs goes through.
"The truth is that the states are already losers," Matheson
said, citing budget cuts enacted in 1982 and proposed for
1983.
After federal aid for the states was cut about-25 percent in
the 1982 budget, the governors' association adopted a reso
lution urging the administration not to make further reduc
tions. But according to an analysis by the governors' associa
tion staff, federal grants to state and local governments
would drop from $91.2 billion in fiscal 1982 to $81.4 billion in
fiscal 1983 under Reagan's proposals. According to the staff
calculations, the reductions would give the states only 74
percent of the purchasing power of the aid grants they had in
fiscal 1981.
When Reagan unveiled his new federal program last
month — including the transfer of food stamp and welfare
programs to the states in return for a federal takeover of
Medicaid — many governors expressed concern about their
states' ability to handle the added responsibilities with the
reduced federal support.
Stockman and Richard Williamson, presidential assistant
for inter-governmental relations, also emphasized that the
administration was willing to adjust many detailsof its feder
alism proposals to suit the needs of the governors.
However, White House spokesmen got some support
from Republican governors including James Thompson of Il
linois, who noted that the governors' association has long fa
vored the idea of exchanging responsibilities with Washing

ton. "It would be a helluva note if we suddenly abandoned
that principle now," he said.
Arafat dismisses expanded cease-fire
Beirut, Lebanon — Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat yester
day dismissed suggestions that he broaden a U.S.-sponsored
cease-fire between Israel and his guerrillas into a general
truce.
At a guerrilla rally here, the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion leader said he would make no commitment beyond
July's agreement not to launch raids into Israel from Leba
non.
Arafat's declaration appeared to be a public response to
private urgings reported to have come from the United Na
tions, Western European states and, through them, the Unit
ed States that his guerrilla movement avoid provoking Israeli
leaders into a new attack on southern Lebanon, where PLO
units are based.
Widely published reports say Israel has been planning
such an attack. Arafat has predicted it a number of times in
recent weeks.
Israeli leaders, speaking against the background of these
reports, have accused Arafat's guerrillas of violating the sev
en-month cease-fire by building up forces in southern Leba
non and staging a raid Jan. 28 from Jordan.
The announcement in July of the cease-fire worked out by
special U.S. envoy Philip Habib omitted any mention of the
parties to the agreement and did not mention the word
"cease-fire," but sources on all sides acknowledged that it
was a tacit understanding involving Israel and the PLO.
Arafat said yesterday that the July agreement contained
only a renewal of earlier Palestinian pledges.
"I cannot declare a cease-fire so long as there is any oc
cupied Palestinian land. And there is no Palestinian leader
ship that will agree to a cease-fire as long as there is occupied
Palestinian land," he said.
Soviets used chemical weapons
Washington — A secret intelligence report prepared for
the White House provide "very grotesque" evidence that
the Soviet Union used chemical warfare to kill thousands of
people in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan, sources say.
The classified National Intelligence Estimate by the CIA
contains additional "hard evidence" of Soviet use of potent
chemical weapons including "yellow rain," say the sources,
who declined to be identified.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig charged last week that
the United States has "incontrovertible evidence" that the
Soviets are using chemical weapons in Afghanistan, Laos and
Cambodia.
In a television interview Feb. 14, he said the poisons have
killed "scores of thousands of non-combatants in all three
target areas."
The sources said a "sanitized" version of the intelligence
report will be made public within the next several weeks to
provide further support for the charges made by Haig and
other U.S. officials.
One official familiar with the report said, "a lot of this evi
dence is very grotesque stuff." But he declined to go into de
tail.
Casualty estimates are difficult to come by, but they range
from 5000 to 30,000 people, the sources said.
Koch to run for governor
New York — Ed Koch, the mayor of New York City, has de
cided to seek the Democratic nomination for governor of
New York state, an aide said yesterday.
"That's all I can say now," said the aide, Evan Cornog. He
said Koch would declare his candicacy today at a news con
ference at Gracie Mansion, his official residence.
Koch thus becomes the immediate frontrunner for the job
being vacated by Gov. Hugh Carey, a Democrat, who is not
seeking a third term. Koch won re-election to a second may
oral term in the fall by a landslide with his name on both the
Democratic and Republican ballots.
