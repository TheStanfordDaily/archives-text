# Briefly Writers

### 
Whether you wrote your last news
story last night or last month — or
haven't even written one at all — we
invite you to drop by the Daily news
office to shuffle through the assign
ments and pick up a story. There are a
lot of great pieces stagnating in the
story assignment box. And don't let
your choices be limited to assign
ments that we generate — if you have
an idea for a story, stop by and discuss
it with the news editors. We're here
any time after 2:00 p.m.
Bookish?

power to wine tasting. If you are in
terested, please come to an informa
tional meeting tomorrowat4:ls p.m.
in the Daily editorial offices.
