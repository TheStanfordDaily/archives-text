# Two proposals for COP structure clash
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Conflicts between a proposed by
laws change and a constitutional
amendment, both designed to re
distribute authority within the ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP), will be
hammered out tomorrow at the
ASSU Senate Rules Committee meet
ing.
Both Senate Vice-Chair Roc
Blumenthal's proposed by-laws
changes and COP member Fred
Buhl's idea for a constitutional
amendment, would reform the pres
ent system of four co-equal presi
dents, but Blumenthal's plan is much
more drastic than Buhl's.
Under Blumenthal's plan, the
members of the council would still
be elected as a slate, but within two

weeks they would choose one of
their members to serve as the "chief
executive" of the ASSU.
The remaining three members of
the COP would divide the executive
duties among themselves, with each
member overseeing one of three
areas: ASSU Boards and Bureaus,
ASSU finances and University rela
tions.
Blumenthal advocated instituting
the reforms through a by-laws
change rather than a constitutional
amendment because he said it was
important to test the changes. "We
don't know how it's going to oper
ate," he said. "If it worked, we could
put it into the constitution."
However, Rules Committee Chair
man Jim McGrath said Blumenthal's
bill as written is "borderline as to its

constitutionality.
"It's very clear that the COP can
divide their duties among them
selves. But once they make one
member slightly more equal than the
others," the change must be in
corporated in the form of a constitu
tional amendment, he said.
Although Blumenthal said he
sensed support for his bill both inside
and outside the Senate, Buhl said he
opposed the measure and doubted
that it would pass.
"I'm against it,"he said. "I think it
goes against the intents and purposes
of the constUution."
Buhl admitted that some re-or
ganization of the COP is necessary,
but he said that the changes should
be enacted by a constitutional

amendment that would allow the
student body to discuss the re-or
ganization rather than by a "covert"
change in the by-laws.

By-id*vs changes must be approved
by two-thirds of the senate members
present and voting. A constitutional
amendment can only be placed on
the ballot by a two-thirds vote of all
the senators and then must be ap
proved by two-thirds of the student
body voting in an election.
Calling Blumenthal's plan "ex
traordinary for a bylaw change,"
Buhl said he is drafting a constitu
tional amendment that will allow one
member of the COP to act as a "pri
mary coordinator" and to speak for
the COP in emergency situations.
Rather than having one COP mem
ber be the permanent chairperson,
Buhl said that his amendment might
call for the alternation of the chair
among the four COP members.
Blumenthal said Buhl's plan of hav
ing a "floating chair" would "shoot
down the whole purpose of having
one person in charge."
According to Jeff Bradach, former
ASSU senator, the ideas behind
Blumenthal's bill were originally for
mulated by him and former Senate
chair Doug Mitchell. "Roc Blumen
thal's reform is essentially my reform
that he formalized," he said.
Bradach said Buhl's plan of alter
nating the chairmanship among the
COP members was "absurd" and de
feated the purpose of "assuring polit
ical accountability.
"Passing the chair around will just
serve to confuse everybody," he said.
Mitchell criticized Buhl's plan asan
attempt by the ASSU to "dilute" the
reforms rather than institute real
changes.
"Fred's plan is 0.K., but Roc's is
good," he said.
Blumenthal stressed that his bill is
only in a preliminary form and might
be changed substantially before it
reaches the Senate. He said that there
is some support in the Senate for re
quiring that the slate of COP can
didates specify which of their mem
bers will be in charge and some sup
port for a totally revised system con
sisting of a president and three vice
presidents.

be enacted by a constitutional

amendment that would allow the
student body to discuss the re-or
ganization rather than by a "covert"
change in the by-laws.

By-id*vs changes must be approved
by two-thirds of the senate members
present and voting. A constitutional
amendment can only be placed on
the ballot by a two-thirds vote of all
the senators and then must be ap
proved by two-thirds of the student
body voting in an election.
Calling Blumenthal's plan "ex
traordinary for a bylaw change,"
Buhl said he is drafting a constitu
tional amendment that will allow one
member of the COP to act as a "pri
mary coordinator" and to speak for
the COP in emergency situations.
Rather than having one COP mem
ber be the permanent chairperson,
Buhl said that his amendment might
call for the alternation of the chair
among the four COP members.
Blumenthal said Buhl's plan of hav
ing a "floating chair" would "shoot
down the whole purpose of having
one person in charge."
According to Jeff Bradach, former
ASSU senator, the ideas behind
Blumenthal's bill were originally for
mulated by him and former Senate
chair Doug Mitchell. "Roc Blumen
thal's reform is essentially my reform
that he formalized," he said.
Bradach said Buhl's plan of alter
nating the chairmanship among the
COP members was "absurd" and de
feated the purpose of "assuring polit
ical accountability.
"Passing the chair around will just
serve to confuse everybody," he said.
Mitchell criticized Buhl's plan asan
attempt by the ASSU to "dilute" the
reforms rather than institute real
changes.
"Fred's plan is 0.K., but Roc's is
good," he said.
Blumenthal stressed that his bill is
only in a preliminary form and might
be changed substantially before it
reaches the Senate. He said that there
is some support in the Senate for re
quiring that the slate of COP can
didates specify which of their mem
bers will be in charge and some sup
port for a totally revised system con
sisting of a president and three vice
presidents.
Conflicts between a proposed by
laws change and a constitutional
amendment, both designed to re
distribute authority within the ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP), will be
hammered out tomorrow at the
ASSU Senate Rules Committee meet
ing.
Both Senate Vice-Chair Roc
Blumenthal's proposed by-laws
changes and COP member Fred
Buhl's idea for a constitutional
amendment, would reform the pres
ent system of four co-equal presi
dents, but Blumenthal's plan is much
more drastic than Buhl's.
Under Blumenthal's plan, the
members of the council would still
be elected as a slate, but within two

weeks they would choose one of
their members to serve as the "chief
executive" of the ASSU.
The remaining three members of
the COP would divide the executive
duties among themselves, with each
member overseeing one of three
areas: ASSU Boards and Bureaus,
ASSU finances and University rela
tions.
Blumenthal advocated instituting
the reforms through a by-laws
change rather than a constitutional
amendment because he said it was
important to test the changes. "We
don't know how it's going to oper
ate," he said. "If it worked, we could
put it into the constitution."
However, Rules Committee Chair
man Jim McGrath said Blumenthal's
bill as written is "borderline as to its

constitutionality.
"It's very clear that the COP can
divide their duties among them
selves. But once they make one
member slightly more equal than the
others," the change must be in
corporated in the form of a constitu
tional amendment, he said.
Although Blumenthal said he
sensed support for his bill both inside
and outside the Senate, Buhl said he
opposed the measure and doubted
that it would pass.
"I'm against it,"he said. "I think it
goes against the intents and purposes
of the constUution."
Buhl admitted that some re-or
ganization of the COP is necessary,
but he said that the changes should
be enacted by a constitutional

amendment that would allow the
student body to discuss the re-or
ganization rather than by a "covert"
change in the by-laws.
