# Two proposals for COP structure clash
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Conflicts between a proposed by
laws change and a constitutional
amendment, both designed to re
distribute authority within the ASSU
Council of Presidents (COP), will be
hammered out tomorrow at the
ASSU Senate Rules Committee meet
ing.
Both Senate Vice-Chair Roc
Blumenthal's proposed by-laws
changes and COP member Fred
Buhl's idea for a constitutional
amendment, would reform the pres
ent system of four co-equal presi
dents, but Blumenthal's plan is much
more drastic than Buhl's.
Under Blumenthal's plan, the
members of the council would still
be elected as a slate, but within two

weeks they would choose one of
their members to serve as the "chief
executive" of the ASSU.
The remaining three members of
the COP would divide the executive
duties among themselves, with each
member overseeing one of three
areas: ASSU Boards and Bureaus,
ASSU finances and University rela
tions.
Blumenthal advocated instituting
the reforms through a by-laws
change rather than a constitutional
amendment because he said it was
important to test the changes. "We
don't know how it's going to oper
ate," he said. "If it worked, we could
put it into the constitution."
However, Rules Committee Chair
man Jim McGrath said Blumenthal's
bill as written is "borderline as to its

constitutionality.
"It's very clear that the COP can
divide their duties among them
selves. But once they make one
member slightly more equal than the
others," the change must be in
corporated in the form of a constitu
tional amendment, he said.
Although Blumenthal said he
sensed support for his bill both inside
and outside the Senate, Buhl said he
opposed the measure and doubted
that it would pass.
"I'm against it,"he said. "I think it
goes against the intents and purposes
of the constUution."
Buhl admitted that some re-or
ganization of the COP is necessary,
but he said that the changes should
be enacted by a constitutional

amendment that would allow the
student body to discuss the re-or
ganization rather than by a "covert"
change in the by-laws.
