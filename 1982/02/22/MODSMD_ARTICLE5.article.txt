# Coffee House to tighten liquor policy
## Soph 'hassles' prompt ID crackdown 
### Douglas Jehl 
Problems revolving around the saleof alcohol to
minors at last Thursday's sophomore talent night at
the Coffee House will lead to even more stringent
enforcement of liquor laws there, according to
Coffee House manager Steve Weiss.
Weiss also reported that two "one-of-a-kind"
lithographs that had been hanging on the east wall
of the Coffee House were discovered missing Fri
day morning and were probably stolen that same
Thursday evening. Weiss valued the lithographs at
$200 each.
Weiss said the Coffee House has always been
aware of the problem of minors attempting to buy
alcohol. But he said that after contacting the Alco
holic Beverage Commission (ABC) Friday after
being informed by Coffee House employees of
Thursday's problems, he has decided to train em
ployees to scrutinize identifications (IDs) more
carefully and to buy a book that pictures and de
scribes various IDs from around the country.
"They (the ABC) told me that the busier you get,
the more they (the ABC) watch you," Weiss said.
Carrie Little, a student manager of the Coffee

House who was working Thursday night, said
"there was no real rowdy scene . . . but there was
just an undercurrent of tension."
She said that after watching people she knew to
be sophomores drinking beer and wine during the
talent show, she told cashiers to be "extra strict"
and to start "proofing everyone." She said that she
and another student manager also approached of
fending students and tried to impress upon them
the problems that they might be creating for the
Coffee House by purchasing alcohol.
"I thought it was really unfortunate and embar
rassing that they had attitudes of 'what does it mat
ter, we've got fake IDs,' " Little said.
In the event of an ABC inspection, the Coffee
House would be held legally responsible for serv
ing to a minor even if he did show a fake ID — "no
matter how good it was," Little said.
Weiss met with Margot Nelson, director of
classes and student services for the Alumni As
sociation, to discuss the problem. Nelson serves as
an adviser to the Student Alumni Network (STAN)
which was sponsoring the talent show.
Some Coffee House employees initially ex

pressed feelings that Thursday night's alcohol-re
lated "hassles" and the theft of the lithographs
might have been related. But Weiss, Little and
Nelson all refused to make any connection be
tween the two events. "It would be totally unfair"
to make such a connection, Nelson said.
The lithographs, mounted in metal and glass
frames measuring about two square feet, had been
hung by wires attached to "sure hooks" imbedded
in the wall, according to Weiss. He said Stanford
Police Sergeant Philip Love, who investigated the
theft Friday morning, said that the wires appeared
to have been "twisted until they broke." Little said
she had locked the Coffee House securely at about
1:30 Friday morning when she left and that there
were no signs of forced entry when the Coffee
House opened again later that morning.
The stolen lithographs, the works of artist Levi
Moross, were two of six lithographs that Weiss said
the Coffee Flouse had purchased to "make the
place look nicer." Weiss expressed a hope that the
lithographs might be returned, "no questions
asked." "We don't care who did it," Weiss said.
"We just want the prints back."
