# Harvard's 1st woman dean: educator Graham
## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
When Prof. Patricia Graham, a respected scholar
with what one Stanford colleague called "a con
cern for equality which is no longer in fashion," as
sumes the deanship of the Harvard School of
Education July 1, she will become Harvard's first
woman dean.
The search committee surprised no one when
they named her as the replacement for current
Dean Paul Ylvisaker. They simply chose the top
candidate for the job, said History and Education
Prof. David Tyack. Graham has taught at Harvard
since 1974 and headed the National Institute of
Education (NIE) from 1977-79.
The quality of teacher and administrator training
in the United States today is better than it was 20
years ago, Graham told the Daily Saturday, "but
not nearly as good as it should be."
Educators need a clearer focus of purpose and a
strategy for getting all students, regardless of back
ground, to achieve those purposes, according to
Graham. "The most important thing a school
should do is makeeverystudent literate, literate in
a complicated definition of literacy â€” the ability to
read, compute, communicate, make judgements
and take actions resulting from them.
"We have traditionally done that with the chil
dren who came with those skills all ready to be
opened up, but we have not done that with chil
dren who were less interested or whose families
were less interested in having that done,"she said.
Now, though, the entire population must have
these skills. "It's good for the individual children

but it's also necessary for the society in which we
all live/' she said.
"We used to get rid of the students who we
didn't deal with easily. We just tossed them out.
Now we've got to do well with all children."
We're still some distance from that goal today,
"but closer with elementary children than we've
ever been in the past," Graham said.
"Nine-year-olds in this country are reading bet
ter than nine-year-olds in this country have ever
read," she explained. "The hope is that as these
nine-year-olds move through the educational sys
tem we will be able to capitalize on these new
strengths."
Graham was here last weekend for "Workshop
on Gender and the History of Education," a gather
ing of 13 historians and social scientists sponsored
by the National Academy of Education.
Most of the participants were young scholars
and assistant professors, explained Tyack, who
conceived and coordinated the weekend along
with Graham.
"She (Graham) is really good at sponsoring
young scholars, but not in a condescending way,"
he said, "She gives tough criticisms."
Tyack praised Graham's longtime commitment
to equality.
"She didn't just discover the women's move
ment in the '60s or '70s. Her mother got a PhD in
history from the University of Wisconsin and never
really got an adequate job. That was a very impor
tant lesson to Pat," added Graham's colleague and
friend.

Graham gained a good sense of the political side
of institutions from her job at NIE, he said. "You
may be fooled into thinking she's a wide-eyed
Midwestern farm girl, but in fact she's one of the
canniest people I know about how organizations
run, where the power is, and how to use that
power for good purposes."
Graham worries now about the effects of budget
cuts on research funds. "The federal government
has been a very important source of support for re
search and for the graduate students who con
tribute to that research," she said.
Graham sees problems, too, for women in
higher education. "Most universities do not have
very many tenured spots coming up and there has
been in the last 10 to 15 years a tremendous in
crease in the proportion of women getting doc
torate degrees.
"These women are now at the point at which ap
propriately they should be getting tenure and
they're ready for tenure just at the moment univer
sities don't have any tenured places," she said.
"The single greatest contribution that greater
concern about women brings to these issues is
women have traditionally placed a higher value on
the significance of their personal lives in making
decisions about their lives than men," she added.
"It's always seemed to me that as a country we
ought to value military service and childbearing at
least equally, but we haven't. We protect jobs for
veterans, but we've never felt it necessary to pro
tect jobs for mothers."
