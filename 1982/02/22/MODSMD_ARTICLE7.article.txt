# Romania: vexed by Internal crises, outside pressures
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bucharest, Romania â€” "This is the darkest
capital in Eastern Europe," a U.S. diplomat
said recently, adding that Bucharest's cold
and gloomy appearance is appropriate for a
nation where light, heat and food are ra
tioned because of the country's severe eco
nomic problems.
Among the Soviet Bloc nations, only Po
land has an economy that is in worse shape.
Romania has the lowest standard of living per
capita, ranking as an underdeveloped nation.
It also has the most repressive internal secur
ity system of any country in the bloc.
Asked how long Poland's Solidarity trade
union movement would survive here, anoth
er U.S. diplomat said: "About half an hour."
Romania and its economy are of special
concern to the United States because this na
tion has the most independent foreign policy
of any country in the Soviet Bloc, an attitude
Washington supports and encourages.
There had been some fear that Romania's
economic difficulties, particularly its need for
imported oil, would give Moscow leverage to
force President Nicolae Ceausescu back into
line.
"We saw no sign of that," said a senior of

ficial on Secretary of State Alexander Haig's
plane last weekend after Haig's one-day visit
here. Still, even as Haig left, the Romanian
government ordered price increases averag
ing 35 percent on all basic food products.
Romania also once supplied oil to much of
southeast Europe from its Ploesti fields. Now
these fields produce less than half of the na
tion's needs, and their output is steadily
dropping, according to CIA estimates.
Romania's economic troubles stem largely
from this domestic oil shortage, which forces
it to import large quantities of petroleum at
high world prices, which it must pay in hard
currencies.
Most of Romania's imported oil comes
from Western nations and Third World coun
tries in the Middle East. But three years ago,
Romania also turned to the Soviet Union. The
initial trickle of Soviet oil has now risen to
one-fifth its total imports.
Moscow, seizing the opportunity to punish
the maverick Ceausescu, treats Romania like
a Western customer rather than as a member
of its satellite community eligible for bargain
rates.
