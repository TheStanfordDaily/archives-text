## El Salvador rebels display gains 
### Washington Post 
Palo Grande, El Salvador — A
guerrilla commander has told a
group of American journalists
brought to this rebel-con
trolled village near the capital
of San Salvador that insurgents
fighting to overthrow the
Salvadoran government have
taken the initiative in the civil
war and intend to step up the
pace of the fighting.
Alejandro Montenegro, ap
pearing Thursday with five oth
er regional battle commanders
of the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front in a
stronghold less than 30 miles
north of San Salvador, said,
however, that the guerrilla
forces' stepped-up activity was
not aimed solely at disrupting
national elections scheduled
for March 28.
The Christian Democratic
and military-led junta has
challenged the leftist guerrilla
forces to compete in the elec
tions for a constituent assembly
and to end the civil war, but the
rebels have refused.
The guerrillas invited and

guided five American journal
ists, who traveled from San
Salvador to visit the territory, to
demonstrate their control of
the area and their efforts to
build what they called the
"embryo" of the type of socie
ty they hope to have if they
take power. The press con
ference was designed to em
phasize the unity of the guer
rilla factions under a coordi
nated command.
But despite the show of
unity, there were signs that the
Liberation Front still has a long
way to go to overcome the
lingering, potentially explosive
frictions among the five
groups, all of which have fight
ing units in this region.
Montenegro and the other
rebel leaders told the reporters
in a news conference on the
slopes of the Guazapa Volcano
that they expect to win the
fight against the civilian-mili
tary government headed by
President jose Napoleon
Duarte unless the United States
intervenes directly in the fight
ing.

The Reagan administration
has not publicly ruled out
direct U.S. military involve
ment to prevent a leftist victory
here, but it says it is not plan
ning such involvement. The
administration's stated policy is
to increase economic and mili
tary aid to the Duarte govern
ment and to back next month's
elections.
The guerrillas said they still
hope for a political solution to
the Salvadoran conflict, but
they cited the U.S. decision to
replace immediately heli
copters destroyed by guerrillas
at the llopango air base last
month as "proof that it is the
United States that is obliging
us" to continue fighting.
Montenegro, who said he
planned the commando assault
on the air base, said, "We know
that it is the Reagan adminis
tration on which the junta de
pends. The key is whether the
Reagan administration will try
to shut us off with more force
of arms or with a political solu
tion. We do not want more
deaths."

The region around the
Guazapa Volcano, where the
guerrillas appear in complete
control despite repeated Army
efforts to dislodge them, is
strategically important because
of its closeness to the capital.
Another rebel area, in
Morazan Province in the
northeast along the Honduran
border, was visited in January
by a group of journalists, in
cluding special correspondent
Alma Guillermoprieto of The
Washington Post.
Estimates earlier this year
quoted by U.S. intelligence
sources indicated that govern
ment forces have lost control
of at least a quarter of El
Salvador's territory.
While the five guerrilla fac
tions operating in this area co
operated to create a highly
structured political organiza
tion among the approximately
5,000 remaining residents, the
differences among them were
apparent. Even the rifles car
ried by fighters are labeled
with the initials of their faction.

ment to prevent a leftist victory
here, but it says it is not plan
ning such involvement. The
administration's stated policy is
to increase economic and mili
tary aid to the Duarte govern
ment and to back next month's
elections.
The guerrillas said they still
hope for a political solution to
the Salvadoran conflict, but
they cited the U.S. decision to
replace immediately heli
copters destroyed by guerrillas
at the llopango air base last
month as "proof that it is the
United States that is obliging
us" to continue fighting.
Montenegro, who said he
planned the commando assault
on the air base, said, "We know
that it is the Reagan adminis
tration on which the junta de
pends. The key is whether the
Reagan administration will try
to shut us off with more force
of arms or with a political solu
tion. We do not want more
deaths."

The region around the
Guazapa Volcano, where the
guerrillas appear in complete
control despite repeated Army
efforts to dislodge them, is
strategically important because
of its closeness to the capital.
Another rebel area, in
Morazan Province in the
northeast along the Honduran
border, was visited in January
by a group of journalists, in
cluding special correspondent
Alma Guillermoprieto of The
Washington Post.
Estimates earlier this year
quoted by U.S. intelligence
sources indicated that govern
ment forces have lost control
of at least a quarter of El
Salvador's territory.
While the five guerrilla fac
tions operating in this area co
operated to create a highly
structured political organiza
tion among the approximately
5,000 remaining residents, the
differences among them were
apparent. Even the rifles car
ried by fighters are labeled
with the initials of their faction.
