## 'Gummy Bear' makes book debut 
### Polly Grunfeld 
Bears in the Sierras seem
logical enough. But the idea
of candy Gummy Bears
going to camp in the Sierras
is stretching it a bit, no mat
ter how popular the candies
are with West Coast resi
dents.
According to Gourmet
Specialties, a candy dis
tributor, Gummy Bears are
the number-one gourmet
candy in the state of Califor
nia. Even at $4.50 to $6.50
per pound, they are pretty
stiff competition for
M & M's and Snickers.
And Bob Moog, Anne
Boreta and Sue Cashel have
captured them in words and
pictures.
Gummy Bear Goes to
Camp, authored by the
three Stanford alumni, is
making its debut at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
The rear of a bus, with a
license plate reading, "I M
K-N-D," adorns the book's
cover. The design features a
"cut-out" window, with a
package of TIM-TIM gum
my bear candies peeking
out.
"When we originally de
signed the cover," Moog
said, "we designed it with
the candy in mind. We as
sumed (the TIM-Tim com
pany) would (supply the

candy free of charge) be
cause it was a neat idea."
"Gummies are so yum
my" that the three are think
ing of sealing up the book to
prevent gummy-swiping.
Moog, Boreta and Cashel
are inserting the packages
into their first five thousand
books by hand.
Inspired by the authors'
stay at Stanford's Sierra
Camp, as well as the Gummy
Bear phenomenon, Moog,
Boreta and Cashel tell of the

"THE LOOK" Move over alligators!
Cummy and associates urge. Everyone
can have the 'in'shirt. Place Cummy Bear
on that shirt you've never worn.
Congratulations, you have the 8.C.0.C.

"Gummy Bear was a real
big thing and a personality
up at camp," said Boreta.
The Gummy Bear book
did not begin as "real
work," but rather as a "fun
project to do with our
friends," according to
Moog. "We're all friends so

settings were parties. A cou
ple of ideas were drug-in
duced. A couple were alco
hol-induced. A lot of peo
ple gave us ideas, but the
three of us put the book to
gether."
"Keeping your en
thusiasm up was the biggest
problem," said Boreta. After
about a year, and spurred
on by positive reactions, the
three decided to "go into
business."
"We're doing this totally

on a shoestring," said
Moog. "To do it right we
would have needed $15,000.
We did everything. Each de
cision was a financial de
cision plus a time decision.
And it was a two to one de
cision process.
The book is copyrighted
and they plan to trademark
their logo. Moog, Boreta

and Cashel are toying with
the idea of writing another
Gummy Bear adventure.
They are also thinking of
launching off into novelties
â€” Gummy Bear cards,
Gummy Bear giftwrap and
Gummy Bear status shirts (to
replace that poor, tired al
ligator).
"We have four to five
thousand in bills still left to
pay," Moog estimated. "But
we expect to make a profit
between one and two mil
lion. That's a conservative
estimate. It doesn't include
the t-shirts, giftwrap and
neckties."
"Sounds like a joke,"
Cashel commented.
"One radio station called
me and asked if it was really
a book," Moog added. "But
it's something anybody can
enjoy. We ended up with a
children's book that can be
read at an adult level."
Gummy Bear made his
grand debut at the Golden
Spike restaurant last Tues
day night.
"We're doing the fun
stuff now," Moog said.
"Shows, authograph
parties, etc."
The trio anticipates selling
their first 5000 books in six
weeks.
