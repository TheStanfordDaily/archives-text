What do engineers do at IBM?
A guide for graduating engineers.
There isn't enough space in this publication to describe
j£T\ r the variety of projects that IBM engineers
) jEjv £p\ undertake in small teams. But. just for example...
Electrical Engineers work on such projects as
display technology, electrical communications.
electrical design and packaging, microcode develop
ment. optics, process engineering, product test and
assurance, systems architecture and analysis.
systems programming and test equipment design. 1 12,
Mechanical Engineers explore acoustics,
computer-aided design, manufacturing engineering,
mechanical design and packaging, quality
engineering, process engineering, product test and
assurance, and thermal analysis.
Chemists and Chemical Engineers study
lithography technology, manufacturing engineering,
materials development and analysis, process
engineering, quality engineering, and semiconductor
design.
Industrial and Manufacturing Engineers engage
in electrical packaging, facilities engineering.
industrial and manufacturing engineering, materials
management, quality engineering.
Computer Scientists and Computer Engineers
work on such projects as application programming,
computer-aided design, electrical communications,
language programming, mathematical analysis,
microcode development, software engineering.
systems architecture and analysis, and systems
programming.
