# Building starts for Music Center
## 
### Kathy Christie 
The area between Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the post office
will be fenced in today in antici
pation of next week's scheduled
start of construction of the Braun
Music Center.
Construction of the center,
which was proposed as early as 23
years ago, is scheduled to begin
March 1, although workers have
been excavating the site for nearly
a year. The expected completion
date of both the center and the
restoration of Lasuen Mall, which
will take place simultaneously, is
fall 1983.
The center will consolidate the
many classrooms, offices and stu
diosof the Music Department into
one central location. The music li
brary will be moved down from
the Knoll, and there will also be
space to store the department's
large collection of valuable musi
cal instruments. The center will
also house a major rehearsal hall
with a capacity of 200.
Of the $7.4 million allotted to
the project, $1,716,000 comes
from the University and the rest

from gifts.
According to Albert Cohen,
chairman of the Music Depart
ment, the construction of the cen
ter is "very exciting for us," be
cause "our facilities have been in
adequate for awhile."
Cohen said there are not
enough classrooms in the Knoll,
and that the ones that do exist do
not have acoustically treated
walls. Aside from this, the struc
ture, which was not originally in
tended to be a music building, is
in such poor shape that the floor
of the library almost caved in four
years ago, he said. The Knoll will
continue to be used by the de
partment.
Cohen also commented on the
diverse locations of other music
facilities on campus, saying, "It's
time to bring this whole thing to
gether. We want to be where ev
erything is going on. Musicshould
be central to activities."
The design of the new music
center, which Cohen called "very
striking," includes a large archway
leading through the building that
will continue the Lasuen Mall

from Lathrop House into White
Piaza. The structure will be two
stories high, with a partial base
ment.
A system of reinforced concrete
will block outside noises from en
tering and inside noises from
being transmitted out of the build
ing. The windows will consist of
double frames with eight inches
of air space, which will block the
transmission of low frequencies.

These construction measures will
also conserve energy. The walls
will be less susceptible to heat
loss, so that few sections of the
building will have to be air-condi
tioned or heated.
Construction is being done by
the San Fransisco-based partner
ship of Engstrum & Norse-Stolte,
and the architectural firm of Mar
quis Associates is responsible for
the center's design.
