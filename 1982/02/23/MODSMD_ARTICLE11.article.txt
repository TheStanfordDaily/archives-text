## Editorial As you bike it: acting safely 
### 
On the morning of Feb. 10, Janet, late for
Western Culture, jumped on her bike and sped
for the quad. She raced through a stop sign on
the corner and strode into class seconds before
the bell.
At noon on the same day, Alex was peddling
back to his dorm for lunch. His brakes didn't
work so he coasted through the corner stop
sign. A car screeched to a stop a few feet from
him and he was first in line for a grilled ham and
cheese.
Afterdinnerthat night, Mark headed off for
the library. He'd never bothered to get a light
for his bike. Not many people did and everyone
knew the police were lenient. He cruised
through the corner stop sign and the next thing
he remembers is waking up in the hospital with
severe head lacerations and spinal fractures,
having flown through the windshield of the car
that hit him. He had been at fault and was lucky
to be alive.
The first two scenarios are probable and the
third was tragically witnessed a little over a week
ago. The difference between the outcomes of
thethree incidents waschance —all bikers took
the same risk. Bikesafety atthe University isa
serious issue.
The Dept. of Health and Safety here reports
that the major cause of accidents is non
observation of rules. Riding on the wrong side
of the road, auto and pedestrian carelessness,
running stop signs and riding at night without a
light have led to the most collisions. Thev noted

that inattention isa major problem as the vast
majority of accidents involve two bikers hitting
each other. Aspokesman from Cowell Health
Center said that they receive biking victims daily
with injuries rangingfrom minor lacerationsto
separated shouldersand broken bones —
victims whoare both bikersand pedestrians.
Because of the rise in biking accidents we feel
it is necessary to remind studentsof some
important University biking rules:
• No mopeds under powerare allowed within
the inner campus demarcated by bollards.
• No parking of bikes in handicapped zones
(which includes all ramps exits), or in marked
walkways and fire exits.
• Cyclists must stop at stop signs, hand signal
when turning and obey all other traffic laws
when riding on streets. Using roads, bikelanes
or bike paths is preferred to riding on sidewalks.
• Brakes must be in good working order.
• Oncoming bikers pass on the right,
overtakers pass on the left and signal your
intention.
• A light must be used at night.
Remember: these are laws, not suggestions.
We urge students to observe them carefully. At
the same time we urge the University to enforce
their use and to take steps to alleviate hazard
potential.
Next time you are hankering for that grilled
ham and cheese, don't let it cloud your reason.
Being second in the lunch line is a lot better than
eating hospital food.
