## Time-limit housing: best for most 
### 
We are writing to clarify a few is
sues and to correct some factual er
rors in Chris Moylan's recent letter
on the new time-limit policy for
graduate students living on-campus.
Moylan assumes that adminis
trators originated the time-limit con
cept to achieve "improved looking
statistics." In fact, the idea was first
proposed by a graduate student
member of the Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee (a student ad
visory body to Residential Educa
tion). He felt that Stanford's lack of
any on-campus time-limit was unfair.
Some students with "poor" random
numbers were entirely excluded
from on-campus housing, while
those with "good" numbers enjoyed
unlimited use of a very scarce re
source during their tenure at Stan
ford. If only 40 percent of the gradu
ate student body can be ac
comodated on campus at any one
time, the student representative
argued, that privilege should be
made equally available to everyone
at some point in their academic ca
reer.
The Committee considered the
question: at which point would on
campus housing be most beneficial?
The Committee felt strongly, as did
the Associate Deans of the respective
graduate schools last spring, that
new, incoming students have the
greatest need for housing their first
year at Stanford. It is harder for new
comers to cope with the off-campus
market than it is for students who are
acclimated to student life here. The
fairest way that new students could
be given priority, students felt, was
through reserving a certain portion
of spaces for them and setting a
smaller portion aside for continuing
students — both of which would be
allocated in a spring lottery.
A Ph.D. student member of the
committee spoke in favor of a one
year time limit, renewable through a
continuing student lottery, rather
than an arbitrary limit to years on
campus which would never be
enough time to accomodate Ph.D.
students. A lottery would give Ph.D.
students a fair chance to stay in on
campus housing through their
course of study, while not cutting
into spaces reserved for the orien
tation of new, incoming students.
The administrators, who had gone
into that meeting with several mod
erate time-limit options designed to

stimulate turn-over on-campus and
prevent abuses (example: students
staying 13, 10 or 8 years in Escondido
Village), were convinced of the valid
ity of this well-thought out, excellent
student proposal. The Dean of Stu
dent Affairs was also impressed by
the student proposal and took it to
the Graduate Deans Advisory Coun
cil of the Graduate Division to seek
their responses. They endorsed the
idea as a fair way to allocate a scarce
resource to students, and at the time
they would need it the most.
Does this new policy mean that the
administrators fail to recognize that
"top graduate students, like faculty,
are vital to this University?" On the
contrary, the new policy indicates
that grads are valued highly and de
serve better orientation to the area
before they might potentially face
the off-campus market. This new pol
icy benefits the 2000 graduate stu
dents least able to speak for them
selves . .. next year's newly admitted
entering class. Moylan's under
standable concern for students like
himself, currently living on-campus,
blinds him to the difficulties faced by
new, incoming students when they
cannot secure immediateon-campus
accomodations. Giving new students
preference will allow them to get to
know each other, facilitate the for
mation of groups that can rent
houses together, and allow them to
make on-campus connections that
will last for years. If they do not fare
well in the continuing students' lot
tery in spring, after their actual initial
academic year they will have four
month's notice at the time of greatest
turn-over of off-campus housing and
be in an excellent position to seek
out the best possible living ac
comodations.
Through the efforts of the Off-
Campus Rental Housing Office (a
Clearinghouse will be held in late
May for off-campus housing) and
through programs planned for
Escondido Village, students will have
a chance to prepare themselves to
deal in an informed way with the off
campus market as they go into the
second year of their program. Only
widespread recognition that gradu
ate students are a vital segment of the
University community — and that
they each deserve a fair chance to
live on campus — could have led to
this basic policy change and tothe re
cent appointment of a University

committee to explore the consuuc
tion of new graduate housing in the
near future.
Moylan maintains that Stanford
houses a "very small percentage of
those who desire to live here." It is
unfortunate that he did not contact
the Housing Center or the Escondido
Village Housing Office toobtain cur
rent figures, but relied rather on a re
port done in 1979. Prior to that re
port, the University housed approx
imately 26 percent of its graduate stu
dents on-campus. In 1979 nearly 100
Escondido Village low-rises were re
designated for single student use,
bringing the figure up to 31.8 per
cent. In 1980 with the redesignation
of Blackwelder High-Rise from mar
ried to single student use, the per
centage housed rose to 33.5 percent.
With the addition of spaces Man
zanita Park and elsewhere on campus
in the 1982-83 academic year, we will
be housing more than 40 percent of
the graduate population on campus.
Therefore, it seems to us that it is in
accurate to call the percentage
housed — while not large enough —
"very small."
He also indicates that the Univer
sity does not compare very well to
other major universities when it
comes to housing graduate students.
Not so, according to the Director of
Housing at Berkeley, that institution
houses just under 10 percent of its
graduate students on campus. Yale
houses 18.33 percent of its graduates.
Overall figures for Harvard are not
available, since each school main
tains its own housing, but the School
of Arts and Sciences reported that it
houses 300 of its 2700 graduate stu
dents, or about 11 percent. Each of
these major universities reported
tight housing markets, expensive off
campus rents and extremely high de
mand for on-campus housing. This
survey confirms our sense that Stan
ford does very well in terms of the
number of spaces and the quality of
housing it provides its graduate stu
dents. Doing comparatively well,
however, is not enough to make us
complacent or decrease our wish to
build housing to bring more students
on-campus.

they each deserve a fair chance to
live on campus — could have led to
this basic policy change and tothe re
cent appointment of a University

committee to explore the consuuc
tion of new graduate housing in the
near future.
Moylan maintains that Stanford
houses a "very small percentage of
those who desire to live here." It is
unfortunate that he did not contact
the Housing Center or the Escondido
Village Housing Office toobtain cur
rent figures, but relied rather on a re
port done in 1979. Prior to that re
port, the University housed approx
imately 26 percent of its graduate stu
dents on-campus. In 1979 nearly 100
Escondido Village low-rises were re
designated for single student use,
bringing the figure up to 31.8 per
cent. In 1980 with the redesignation
of Blackwelder High-Rise from mar
ried to single student use, the per
centage housed rose to 33.5 percent.
With the addition of spaces Man
zanita Park and elsewhere on campus
in the 1982-83 academic year, we will
be housing more than 40 percent of
the graduate population on campus.
Therefore, it seems to us that it is in
accurate to call the percentage
housed — while not large enough —
"very small."
He also indicates that the Univer
sity does not compare very well to
other major universities when it
comes to housing graduate students.
Not so, according to the Director of
Housing at Berkeley, that institution
houses just under 10 percent of its
graduate students on campus. Yale
houses 18.33 percent of its graduates.
Overall figures for Harvard are not
available, since each school main
tains its own housing, but the School
of Arts and Sciences reported that it
houses 300 of its 2700 graduate stu
dents, or about 11 percent. Each of
these major universities reported
tight housing markets, expensive off
campus rents and extremely high de
mand for on-campus housing. This
survey confirms our sense that Stan
ford does very well in terms of the
number of spaces and the quality of
housing it provides its graduate stu
dents. Doing comparatively well,
however, is not enough to make us
complacent or decrease our wish to
build housing to bring more students
on-campus.

We are writing to clarify a few is
sues and to correct some factual er
rors in Chris Moylan's recent letter
on the new time-limit policy for
graduate students living on-campus.
Moylan assumes that adminis
trators originated the time-limit con
cept to achieve "improved looking
statistics." In fact, the idea was first
proposed by a graduate student
member of the Graduate Housing
Advisory Committee (a student ad
visory body to Residential Educa
tion). He felt that Stanford's lack of
any on-campus time-limit was unfair.
Some students with "poor" random
numbers were entirely excluded
from on-campus housing, while
those with "good" numbers enjoyed
unlimited use of a very scarce re
source during their tenure at Stan
ford. If only 40 percent of the gradu
ate student body can be ac
comodated on campus at any one
time, the student representative
argued, that privilege should be
made equally available to everyone
at some point in their academic ca
reer.
The Committee considered the
question: at which point would on
campus housing be most beneficial?
The Committee felt strongly, as did
the Associate Deans of the respective
graduate schools last spring, that
new, incoming students have the
greatest need for housing their first
year at Stanford. It is harder for new
comers to cope with the off-campus
market than it is for students who are
acclimated to student life here. The
fairest way that new students could
be given priority, students felt, was
through reserving a certain portion
of spaces for them and setting a
smaller portion aside for continuing
students — both of which would be
allocated in a spring lottery.
A Ph.D. student member of the
committee spoke in favor of a one
year time limit, renewable through a
continuing student lottery, rather
than an arbitrary limit to years on
campus which would never be
enough time to accomodate Ph.D.
students. A lottery would give Ph.D.
students a fair chance to stay in on
campus housing through their
course of study, while not cutting
into spaces reserved for the orien
tation of new, incoming students.
The administrators, who had gone
into that meeting with several mod
erate time-limit options designed to

stimulate turn-over on-campus and
prevent abuses (example: students
staying 13, 10 or 8 years in Escondido
Village), were convinced of the valid
ity of this well-thought out, excellent
student proposal. The Dean of Stu
dent Affairs was also impressed by
the student proposal and took it to
the Graduate Deans Advisory Coun
cil of the Graduate Division to seek
their responses. They endorsed the
idea as a fair way to allocate a scarce
resource to students, and at the time
they would need it the most.
Does this new policy mean that the
administrators fail to recognize that
"top graduate students, like faculty,
are vital to this University?" On the
contrary, the new policy indicates
that grads are valued highly and de
serve better orientation to the area
before they might potentially face
the off-campus market. This new pol
icy benefits the 2000 graduate stu
dents least able to speak for them
selves . .. next year's newly admitted
entering class. Moylan's under
standable concern for students like
himself, currently living on-campus,
blinds him to the difficulties faced by
new, incoming students when they
cannot secure immediateon-campus
accomodations. Giving new students
preference will allow them to get to
know each other, facilitate the for
mation of groups that can rent
houses together, and allow them to
make on-campus connections that
will last for years. If they do not fare
well in the continuing students' lot
tery in spring, after their actual initial
academic year they will have four
month's notice at the time of greatest
turn-over of off-campus housing and
be in an excellent position to seek
out the best possible living ac
comodations.
Through the efforts of the Off-
Campus Rental Housing Office (a
Clearinghouse will be held in late
May for off-campus housing) and
through programs planned for
Escondido Village, students will have
a chance to prepare themselves to
deal in an informed way with the off
campus market as they go into the
second year of their program. Only
widespread recognition that gradu
ate students are a vital segment of the
University community — and that
they each deserve a fair chance to
live on campus — could have led to
this basic policy change and tothe re
