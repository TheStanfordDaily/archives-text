## The 						'drifters' finally anchor? 
### 
There has been a popular notion among those who
watch the college scene that college students are the
best educated and the least informed of all people. The
Stanford Senior Survey (Daily Feb 10, 1982) revealed
some information that contradicted this belief, at least
among Stanford students. First of all, 63 percent of Stan
ford Seniors rated their ability to "understand social
processes and institutions" as "good" or "excellent,"
and 61 percent rated their abilities similarly with regard
to making "judgments about international problems fac
ing the country." In contrast to the belief that college
students are indifferent to news and events like this,
these students rated these abilities of "great" or "very
great" importance 59 percent and 70 percent of the time
on these respective two questions. Assuming that stu
dents are able toassess their abilities accurately, these re
sults are both surprising and heartening.
Ours is perhaps a fiercely opinion less and opinionated
generation. The amount of information that is available
on any conceivable subject is astounding, and yet this
very superabundance seems to frustrate many who seek
to learn about an event or situation in its basic form.
News is necessarily incremental: it builds each day upon
previous information as an event progresses without
going into the background details. In order to really un
derstand an issue, one must follow it from its birth as a
newsworthy event. Thus while there are those who are
very well informed, and usually opinionated, there are
also many others who shut themselves off from the news
because of its complexity and scope.
The opinionless half of our generation is probably
worth discussing. In general, it is hard to find any incen
tives for being well-informed. It is not necessary to have
an opinion on most subjects beyond consumer choice.
Our society has become so power-centralized that the
average citizen does not seem to feel that he or she
makes any difference in the political decision-making
process. Most issues seem so removed from the common
control that opinions are superfluous in light of one's
ability to affect outcomes.

Furthermore, the sources of news today are short on
hard comprehensible news and long on soft digestible
news. For instance, Time and Newsweek do cover stories
on pregnancy and Willie Nelson, (no offense meant to
fans of Willie or pregnancy) and feature Newsmakers
and Lifestyle sections that are much more interesting to
the average reader than articles on Poland, El Salvador,
or the budget. The hard news sections of the news
weeklies have a much less important role in subscribers'
minds than do the other sections.
The opinion-free generation loosely described here
may be coming to an end. The '80s promise to be a
decade when individuals must make important and dif
ficult choices for themselves and others. Perhaps the tax
revolts of California and Massachusetts are early ex
amples of an increasingly politically motivated populace.
The perceived threats of nuclear war and nuclear power,
formerly issues of indirect concern to most people, are
being discussed (and condemned) by many groups, such
as physicians, clergymen, and ordinary citizens. It is in
teresting to note that at least the first two of these groups
have not been politically vocal until now on issues of
common concern. Perhaps as times appear more per
ilous, people will be willing to find out about and act
upon the issues that confront them. People seem most of
all sensitive to change for the worse. As economic and
political misfortune turns from potential to real, the lib
erty of leading an opinion less existence becomes a liabil
ity.
The results of the Stanford Senior Survey may fore
shadow the end of the opinionless generation . The typi
cally uninformed and unaware, especially college stu
dents, are becoming just the opposite. The change is a
positive sign that people will exercise their rights to
speak and act on matters they feel are critical. Perhaps it
is no longer a matter of choice to have an opinion. An
opinion is the requisite to fighting for increasingly diver
gent views about the directions we take in the '80's.
