## No honor code amongst premeds 
### 
The Honor Code is a sacred institu
tion at Stanford. Unfortunately it is
not being observed. Therefore it
should be revised thoroughly or dis
carded.
I am a premedical student. Thus I
am a part of what is probably the larg
est group of undergraduates at this
university.
Last fall, I took Vertebrate Biology
along with several hundred other

premeds. The course grades de
pended upon a midterm and a final
exam. Since the applicant to
matriculant ratio reaches6oor higher
at many medical schools, I cannot
emphasize enough how thoroughly
important biology course grades are.
Since professors are forbidden to
proctor exams, all hell broke loose.
When the exam officially ended, few
students immediately stopped work-

ing. Five minutes after the tests were
called in, dozens of students re
mained in their seats, writing. Many
others were making last minute cor
rections as they slowly moved up the
aisle.
Since this exam was highly pres
sured with respect to time, those five
minutes may have made a difference
of five to ten points or more for stu
dents who were unable to answer all
the questions previously. Those of us
who stopped working on time were
rewarded with a higher class mean
and lower relative scores.
Many science courses I have taken
at other universities have also been
plagued by cheaters. Stanford is cer
tainly not unique in that respect. In
none of those schools, however, was
the level of disregard for the rules of
the exam so high or the remedial
measures available to the professor
so completely lacking in substance.
Many premeds are diligent, honest
and dedicated. It is not right to penal
ize these individualsortoputthemat
a competitive disadvantage to those
students who cannot handle the
pressures of this rigorous university.

Reinventing the wheel
During my stay at Stanford, I have
often been amused by what seems to
be a preference for reinventing the
wheel in order to avoid imitating
eastern universities. However, the
article, "Suite Housing Ahead" (Dai
ly, Feb. 17), was downright up
roarious. I wonder how many people
here are aware that this "totally new
concept" has been in existence at
MIT at least since 1975, when I lived
in Burton-Connor. Suites in Burton
had a common living area, bath
room, and kitchen, and housed from
five to eight students. Moreover, you
had your choice of living in an all
female suite, an all-male suite, or (oh,
horrors!) a coed suite. Yes, we had
coed bathrooms, and no, no one
died from it.
