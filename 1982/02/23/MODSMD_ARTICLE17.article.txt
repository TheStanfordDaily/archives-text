## Threepenny: Surgical working of Brecht the Knife 
### Bryan Trevor 
The Threepenny Opera
S.U. Drama Dept/Memorial Auditorium
Last quarter Geoffrey Reeves, on behalf of
the Stanford Drama Department, turned
George Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer
into imitation Brecht, with something less
than rousing success. This time around,
Lome Buchman has assayed the genuine
article, Brecht's Threepenny Opera, and if
the outcome is decidedly more auspicious,
some of the same problems that plagued
Reeve's production ironically reappear.
As with Reeves, however, one must first
give Buchman all due praise for fashioning
such a highly finished, professional-looking
show in a form where others at Stanford have
spectacularly failed. Anyone who has ever
attended a Ram's Head musical will im
mediately appreciate the care and precision
of Buchman's work, his painstaking atten
tion to detail and conceptual ingenuity.
Ram's Head musicals are really just dorm
shows on a grand scale. Their amateur-night
atmosphere is, in fact, a very large part of
their appeal, as students come out of all
kinds of academic closets to sing and dance
their hearts out in the best Mickey Rooney-
Judy Garland-hey-let's-do-a-show tradition.
Ram's Head shows could never be accused
of genuine artistry or technical discipline but
instead thrive on freshness, bounciness, and
adolescent bravado.
More than anything else, they are in
variably undone by two things: a lack of per
formers who can both sing and act, and a
lack of honest-to-God directors. Three
penny Opera is blessed in both respects.

Nearly every key performer not only acts
with sureness and style but also proves equal
to the demands of Kurt Weill's sophisticated
musical score, one of the most formidable in
contemporary theater. In addition, Three
penny Opera gives the surest sign of con
summate directorial control. Buchman has
overseen the show's immense coordination
of effort and orchestration of effect with
considerable skill. He has, for the most part,
structured the show well, and made im
aginative use of the space. He deploys his ac
tors with strategic exactness, artfully moving
and placing people to provide proper focus
and, in the crowd scenes, taking care that ev
ery person has an intention and an attitude
to the action.
Indeed, on the technical level, Three
penny Opera is virtually seamless. Thanks to
Richard Garretson's sound design and Claire
\ Kelm's musical supervision, the balance
) and synchronization between singers
orchestra, a traditional pitfall of musical
productions, is impeccable. Michael
Ramsaur's prodigious lighting and set design
give the show visual distinction as well.
If Buchman were dealing with more dis
posable material — Kiss Me, Kate or The Mu
sic Man — all this talent and technical prow
ess might have carried the show. But Three
penny Opera, beyond its obvious entertain
ment value, is also a piece of serious theater,
with a dimension of social commentary that
demands a deeper exploration. Regrettably,
like The Recruiting Officer, this Threepenny
Opera is probably too slick for its own good.
For all its professional gloss, it never really
engages the audience's imaginative sympa
thies or critical faculties. It's a curiously static

show. A small part of the problem is perhaps
technical: to animate so vast an environ
ment, Buchman probably needs more fre
quency and variety of movement, as well as
more energy from his performers which, on
opening night at least, was noticeably lack
ing in places. Buchman might also have been
well advised to take the scissors to the text,
which seems ripe for cutting in several repe
titious places.
A larger part of the problem isconceptual.
The entire production is so mannered that it
is ultimately unmoving and misses its in
tended impact. Again the comparison with
The Recruiting Officer is apt: the characters
never really come to life because the acting
is so unvaried, uninflected and one
dimensional. We may admire the skill of
some performances, but it's the same ad
miration we feel for circusstunts and athletic
feats. The cast fails to animate the passions
that Brecht invested in the work.
My criticism perhaps smacks of
Philistinism to those familiar with the popu
lar conception of Brecht as a theatrical revo
lutionary who, far from desiring an au
dience's emotional involvement, devised
strategiesof alienation in ordertoholdthem
at arm's length, hoping to arouse their in
tellects rather than theiremotions. One such
strategy was a highly stylized form of acting
that called attention to its own artificiality, so
that audiences would never be tempted to
confuse art with life.
Unfortunately, this popular conception is
largely fallacious. Brecht was not anti-emo
tion, but rather anti-empathy. He opposed

an audience's sympathetic identification
with a single central figure, but depended on
their emotional involvement in the action as
a whole to drive home his political points.
Unless people are moved by what they see,
are emotionally affected enough to take in
terest in the issues, they can hardly be ex
pected to absorb a play's message and leave
the theater enriched and enlightened. There
is no less likely convert to an ideology than a
person who simply loses interest in its mode
of presentation.
Also, while Brecht's opposition to em
pathy did indeed lead him to advocate an
unnaturalistic acting style, his concept can
hardly be construed as a license for his
trionics or superficiality. If he wanted au
diences to avoid getting caught up in an ac
tor's characterization, he also wanted them
wholly attentive to the human content of the
actor's work. The demonstrative style of
Hrechtianactinghasa purpose: topresentan
aspect of life with enough vigor and clarity to
capture the audience's interest and prepare
them for illumination.
Buchman's Threepenny Opera often lacks
this vigor and clarity. Ironically, his produc
tion might have worked better if the acting
had been more naturalistic, establishing a
conventional frame of reference which the
satires and ironies of the text could then ov
erturn. The audience might then find itself

alternately pulled in and pushed back, emo
tionally involved but also intellectually pro
voked, which seems to be just what Brecht
had in mind.
The aim of Brecht's theater is not alien
ation but rather surprise or defamiliarization
— to cast the familiar in a new and strange
light so that the audience is moved to ques
tion all their old assumptions and values. In
Threepenny Opera, Brecht's bit of de
familiarization is that the folk-hero criminal,
about whom popular ballads are sung, is ac
tually a bourgeois capitalist, a ruthless ex
ploiter of his fellow human beings — not a
defender of the oppressed but an oppressor.
As Macheath, Kurt Reinhardt gives us half
the formula, playing the exacting gentleman
without the folk hero's disarming roguery,
thereby missing much of Macheath'sintrigu
ing ambiguity. Reinhardt gives a stylish,
polished, immensely skilful performance.
He has a fine singing voice and invests his
songs with passion and nuance. Still, Rein
hardt is too controlled and contained. He
has the authority but not the insouciance,
the swagger or the engaging raffishness —
in short, the charm.
At first Anne Hotchkiss looks like an in
spired choice for Polly. She has a gorgeous
voice and plays her first scenes with a vacant
ingenuousness that seems just 'right. Un
fortunately, she spends the entirety of the
play at just that level, without varying or
deepening her portrayal, without connect
ing to a genuine feeling. She doesn't really
act; she just carries out an attitude. Such
one-dimensionality is most unfortunate be
cause Pollv too is a defamiliarized fi«ure, vio

lating our initial expectations of the conven
tional ingenue with her rebelliousness, tier
ability to take over Mac's gang and to trade
insults and punches with her rival Lucy
Brown. Hotchkiss has the perfect ingenue
look, and might have played against type to

marvelous effect.
As played by Claudia Borish and Steve
Vineberg, the Peachums are the biggest
crowd-pleasers in the cast. Borish is by far
the show's funniest performer. Her comic
extravagances come perilously close to mug
ging at times but she is a skilful enough co
medienne to pull it off. The main trouble is
that her blowzy, addle - headed approach to
the part de-fangs Mrs. Peachum, deprives
her of a potential malevolence. A harder
edge would have better suited the play's iro
nies and tensions. Borish too much a lovable

madcap to ever be threatening.
Vineberg brings a better balance to his
c haracterization. He gives Peachum's hard
ened cynic ism the full quantity of menace
but his villainous bravado is also occasionally
very funny, as when ho browbeats his re
calcitrant beggars or puts down the hapless
Tiger Brown.
Lilli Ann Linford leaves the role of Lucy
Brown pretty much where she found it, ex
cept in the 'jealousy Aria' where she dist
inguishes herself with some delightful comic
acting. She has a strong enough voice to
make the operatic parody work and adds
some deliriously wicked gleams and leers.
Laura Esserman cuts an impressive figure
as Jenny but her manner seems too arist
ocratically arch and her costume too Las
Vegas to suit her 'Low-Dive' sobriquet.
The only truly hopeless case in the cast is
Derek Evan, who as Tiger Brown is so full of
affectations and hyperbolic flounces that I
wanted to storm the stage and strangle him.
He c an't deliver a line without some furious
gestirulative accompaniment or vocal his
trionic:. It's tfie most relentlessly false and ex
asperatingly artificial performance I've seen
in quite some time.
The supporting cast is a cornucopia of tal
ent, and its (fioral singing is simply the best
I've heard in a Stanford production. The only
trouble is that the chorus only has twenty or
so lines to sing. The Turnbridge whores are
perhaps too fresh-faced and cherubic, with
the exception of the peerless Drue Bralove,
who has the courage to be truly disgusting.
Among the incongruously boyish and
beamish criminals who comprise Mac's

garifj, Laurence Maslon turns in yet another
finely-tuned comic performance.
Despite its flaws, Threepenny Opera is a
creditable production and should be seen by
anyone who has an interest in serious thea
ter. In all fairness to Buchman, Brecht'sscript
has some unmistakable weaknesses, not the
least of which is that it aspires to arouse sup
port for the oppressed without directly de
picting their plight. Brecht focuses instead
on the oppressors, Macheath and Peachum,
and the case against them is made only in
directly, almost in the abstract. In addition,
some moments inßu< hman's productiondo
have the appropriate sting of social protest,
especially the first and second finales, with
Steve Vineberg and Kurt Reinhardt respec
tively leading the chorus in bitter, re
barbative numbers that directly confront the
audience and challenge its complacencies.
Unfortunately, the failure of the third
finale is ultimately most representative of the
production as a whole. Because Buchman
doesn't stage Mat heath's near-execution in
a way that leads us to believe his life is really
on the line, and because Reinhardt's inac
cessible portrayal makes us indifferent to
Mac's fate anyway, we have no real sense of
relief when the royal messenger arrives and
therefore have no occasion to realize the
absurdity of that sense of relief when an an
gry mob descends on us at the final moment
and exhorts us to remember that saviors on
horseback dre rare in real life. We might
have been sfMit out with something to think
about, but this production of Threepenny
Opera is unlikely to linger in the mind. It's a
good show, but it might have been more.
