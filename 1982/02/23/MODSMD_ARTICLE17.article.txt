## Threepenny: Surgical working of Brecht the Knife 
### Bryan Trevor 
The Threepenny Opera
S.U. Drama Dept/Memorial Auditorium
Last quarter Geoffrey Reeves, on behalf of
the Stanford Drama Department, turned
George Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer
into imitation Brecht, with something less
than rousing success. This time around,
Lome Buchman has assayed the genuine
article, Brecht's Threepenny Opera, and if
the outcome is decidedly more auspicious,
some of the same problems that plagued
Reeve's production ironically reappear.
As with Reeves, however, one must first
give Buchman all due praise for fashioning
such a highly finished, professional-looking
show in a form where others at Stanford have
spectacularly failed. Anyone who has ever
attended a Ram's Head musical will im
mediately appreciate the care and precision
of Buchman's work, his painstaking atten
tion to detail and conceptual ingenuity.
Ram's Head musicals are really just dorm
shows on a grand scale. Their amateur-night
atmosphere is, in fact, a very large part of
their appeal, as students come out of all
kinds of academic closets to sing and dance
their hearts out in the best Mickey Rooney-
Judy Garland-hey-let's-do-a-show tradition.
Ram's Head shows could never be accused
of genuine artistry or technical discipline but
instead thrive on freshness, bounciness, and
adolescent bravado.
More than anything else, they are in
variably undone by two things: a lack of per
formers who can both sing and act, and a
lack of honest-to-God directors. Three
penny Opera is blessed in both respects.

Nearly every key performer not only acts
with sureness and style but also proves equal
to the demands of Kurt Weill's sophisticated
musical score, one of the most formidable in
contemporary theater. In addition, Three
penny Opera gives the surest sign of con
summate directorial control. Buchman has
overseen the show's immense coordination
of effort and orchestration of effect with
considerable skill. He has, for the most part,
structured the show well, and made im
aginative use of the space. He deploys his ac
tors with strategic exactness, artfully moving
and placing people to provide proper focus
and, in the crowd scenes, taking care that ev
ery person has an intention and an attitude
to the action.
Indeed, on the technical level, Three
penny Opera is virtually seamless. Thanks to
Richard Garretson's sound design and Claire
\ Kelm's musical supervision, the balance
) and synchronization between singers
orchestra, a traditional pitfall of musical
productions, is impeccable. Michael
Ramsaur's prodigious lighting and set design
give the show visual distinction as well.
If Buchman were dealing with more dis
posable material — Kiss Me, Kate or The Mu
sic Man — all this talent and technical prow
ess might have carried the show. But Three
penny Opera, beyond its obvious entertain
ment value, is also a piece of serious theater,
with a dimension of social commentary that
demands a deeper exploration. Regrettably,
like The Recruiting Officer, this Threepenny
Opera is probably too slick for its own good.
For all its professional gloss, it never really
engages the audience's imaginative sympa
thies or critical faculties. It's a curiously static

show. A small part of the problem is perhaps
technical: to animate so vast an environ
ment, Buchman probably needs more fre
quency and variety of movement, as well as
more energy from his performers which, on
opening night at least, was noticeably lack
ing in places. Buchman might also have been
well advised to take the scissors to the text,
which seems ripe for cutting in several repe
titious places.
A larger part of the problem isconceptual.
The entire production is so mannered that it
is ultimately unmoving and misses its in
tended impact. Again the comparison with
The Recruiting Officer is apt: the characters
never really come to life because the acting
is so unvaried, uninflected and one
dimensional. We may admire the skill of
some performances, but it's the same ad
miration we feel for circusstunts and athletic
feats. The cast fails to animate the passions
that Brecht invested in the work.
My criticism perhaps smacks of
Philistinism to those familiar with the popu
lar conception of Brecht as a theatrical revo
lutionary who, far from desiring an au
dience's emotional involvement, devised
strategiesof alienation in ordertoholdthem
at arm's length, hoping to arouse their in
tellects rather than theiremotions. One such
strategy was a highly stylized form of acting
that called attention to its own artificiality, so
that audiences would never be tempted to
confuse art with life.
Unfortunately, this popular conception is
largely fallacious. Brecht was not anti-emo
tion, but rather anti-empathy. He opposed
