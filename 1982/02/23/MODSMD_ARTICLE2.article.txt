# ASSU picks grad student for SFM post
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
An ASSU selection committee has chosen a
Graduate School of Business student to be the
probable successor to this year's student financial
manager (SFM) although the current SFM, an un
dergraduate, had reapplied for the job.
The committee Sunday chose Victor Hymes to
be the new ASSU associate student financial man
agerand likely student financial manager(SFM) for
next year. He was chosen over current SFM Cyn
thia Mathewson, an industrial engineering major,
who had made an unprecedented bid for a second
term in one of the ASSU's positions of highest re
sponsibility along with the Council of Presidents
and senate chair.
Although the committee has selected only the
associate SFM, the associate SFM has historically
been confirmed by the ASSU Senate as the SFM for
the following year.
Regarding Mathewson's training of Hymes,
Mathewson said her position will not be any dif
ferent from that of SFMs in previous years.
"He has a lot to learn, and I'm here to train him,"

she said.
Hymes agreed that Mathewson's bid for the job
will probably not pose problems in his training.
"I've met Cynthia and I've been impressed with
her integrity and the fine job she's done," he said.
"I look forward to working with her."
According to Jim McGrath, ASSU Senate rules
committee chair and a member of the selection
committee, the committee had a "very difficult"
time making the decision to appoint Hymes rather
than Mathewson to the SFM post.
McGrath said both students were "head and
shoulders above" the other candidates, but the
ASSU's "strong incentive to get new people" led to
the selection of Hymes. The committee had never
faced a similar choice, McGrath said, because no
previous SFM had ever reapplied for the job.
Mark Epstein, finance committee chair and an
other member of the committee, agreed that the
committee's desire to give the opportunity to
serve as SFM to another student influenced its final
choice of Hymes.
"We felt that the candidates were very equal,
but we felt that it was our responsiblity to provide
the educational opportunity" offered by the SFM

position to another student.
"Her (Mathewson's) experience and the need
for continuity were weighed against our obligation
to serve as an educational association for stu
dents," he said.
Hymes has previous experience in student gov
ernment from his undergraduate years at Oberlin
Collejp, where he served as Oberlin's equivalent
of the SFM.
According to McGrath, the position of associate
SFM was created to ease the transition in the finan
cial affairs of the ASSU from year to year. Tradi
tionally, the associate SFM is trained by the current
SFM for a few months and then confirmed by the
senate as the next year's SFM in the spring.
The SFM is charged with overseeing the daily
business activities of the ASSU. Among the man
ager's responsibilities are collection and distribu
tion of fee assessment funds, overseeing the ASSU
accountsof various student groups on campusand
evaluation of the ASSU projects. The SFM is the
only officer outside of the senate and the Council
of Presidents who is mentioned in the constitution
and who is subject to recall by the student body.
