Stories are everywhere at Stanford.
Each building, each person, each
passing season has its unique story to
tell. These stories are merely waiting

assignment. New and experienced

reporters are equally welcome. Also,
if you have any story ideas don't
hesitate to discuss them with the
news editors. Contrary to vicious
rumors, they are civilized, and they
are here, any time after 2 p.m.
