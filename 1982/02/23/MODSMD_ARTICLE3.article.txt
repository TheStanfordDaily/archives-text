Magnate offers U.S. $10-billion job fund
Washington — Calling it a "multi-billion dollar jumper cable" from a
Toyota to spark "the gigantic Cadillac limousine" of the U.S. economy,
Japanese-American businessman Kaytaro Sugahara yesterday laid
before the nation's governors his proposal for a $10-billion Japanese
fund to foster jobs in the United States.
Sugahara, a millionaire shipping magnate and chairman of the U.S.-
Asia Institute, called on the governors to submit suggestions for projects
in their states to the National Governors' Association's international
trade and foreign relations committee.
"We will ask the Japanese to form a parallel committee," Sugahara
said. "The U.S.-Asia Institute will coordinate between these two com
mittees" in deciding how to invest the funds, which are to be supplied
by private Japanese businessmen.
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan has more than doubled in the last
two years, soaring from $8 billion in 1979 to $18 billion last year. It is ex
pected to reach $20 billion this year.
Under the plan, projects in the United States would be financed
through low-interest loans. Among the projects expected to be pro
posed by the states are high-speed "bullet" trains in California and the
Northeast Corridor and improved port facilities to handle coal exports
from the West Coast, Sugahara said.
Formaldehyde foam insulation sales banned
Washington — The Consumer Product Safety Commission, citing
possible cancer hazards, ordered a ban yesterday on all future sales of
home insulation made with formaldehyde.
As many as half a million homes have been insulated with for
maldehyde foam since the mid-1970s as part of a massive government
campaign to convince homeowners to conserve energy.
Last year, formaldehyde foam sales totaled about $10 million.
Yesterday's ruling does not cover homes already insulated with for
maldehyde foam. Commission officials advise consumers to leave the
insulation alone if they have not experienced any health problems.
If problems have occurred, then consumers must solve them on their
own, perhaps by taking such drastic steps as ripping out the insulation.
Commission and industry officials estimate it could cost $15,000 to re
move existing formaldehyde insulation from homes — more than 10
times the original installation cost.
The commission, in a 4-to-1 vote, concluded that a ban was the only
effective way to protect consumers from the formaldehyde gas that is
frequently released after the insulation is installed.
Formaldehyde has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and in hu
mans it is known to cause such adverse health effects as nausea, head
aches, dizziness, respiratory ailments, bloody noses and eye and skin ir
ritations.
It was chiefly the fear that formaldehyde might cause cancer in hu
mans that led the commission to call the insulation an "unreasnable
health risk."
The commission rejected industry pleas for a less onerous regulatory
scheme — either labeling or a mandatory installation standard. The ban
is to take effect within five months, although the commission could
change that timetable.
Baker proposes defense surtax
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) yesterday suggested a fed
eral income surtax as one way of financing a mil
itary buildup while reducing deficits, and con
gressional budget leaders said President Ronald
Reagan's red-ink budget is all but dead on
Capitol Hill.
While even Baker aides characterized the sur
tax idea as just a "trial balloon," the proposal —
and others that surfaced as Congress returned
from a one-week recess — underscored mount
ing congressional determination to try to bring
down interest rates by reducing budget deficits.
Although Baker did not go into details, other
sources said a temporary surtax of 5 percent or
10 percent is being "discussed" among Senate
Republicans. They said a 10 percent surtax
would raise about $37 billion to help offset, or at
least meet, the projected $91.5 billion deficit for
next year.
That surtax would virtually wipe out the 10
percent tax cut that Congress has approved for
this year, although technically it would leave
the Reagan tax program in place. It also would
be raising taxes for another of Reagan's top
priorities: defense.
"It's a signal that we need to look at every
idea out there ... that something's got to be
done," said a Senate Republican leadership
aide.
Initial reaction from administration officials
was cool, but they did not immediately pop the
balloon.
Budget Director David Stockman said a de
fense surtax was "one of the more creative pro
posals" that Congress has made, although he
questioned such earmarking of tax revenues.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan also ex
pressed reservations but did not dismiss the
proposal outright, as he did another con
gressional budget alternative last week.
Chile, Letelier death linked
Washington — The Chilean government paid
legal fees and family support during 1978 and
1979 for Michael Townley, the man who was
convicted of plotting and helping to carry out
the car-bombing assassination in Washington
of exiled former Chilean diplomat Orlando
Letelier, according to private letters Townley
wrote from prison to officials in Chile.
Copies of 52 letters, covering the period from
June 1978, two months after Townley was
turned over to the United States by the Chilean
government, to October 1979, were obtained
by The Washington Post and authenticated by
federal officials.
The letters portray the still-imprisoned
Townley as frustrated and despondent over ef

forts by the Chilean government publicly to dis
associate itself from him, and by the slow
payment of his bills. At the same time, the let
ters contain assurances that Townley will con
ceal additional information concerning Chilean
intelligence activities — including contacts with
rightist European terrorists — from U.S. prose
cutors.
During the Letelier assassination trials, feder
al prosecutors presented extensive evidence
that Townley, an American citizen, was a senior
agent in Chile's intelligence service, then
known as DINA, and had carried out the Sep
tember 1976 assassination of Letelier and an as
sociate, Ronni K. Moffitt, under direct DINA or
ders. The Chilean government, which refused
to extradite three senior DINA officials who
were indicted in the case based on Townley's
testimony, at the time characterized Townley as
a low-level functionary in the secret police who
never was authorized to assassinate anyone.
Since then, Chile consistently has denied any
connection with Townley, including payment
of his legal and personal expenses. In Septem
ber of 1978, for example, Gen. Cesar Mendoza
Duran, a member of the Chilean junta de
nounced Townley as "an agent of the CIA, the
KGB and at the same time an agent of Cuba."
• Asked yesterday about the information con
tained in the Townley letters, Juan Prado, a
spokesman at the Chilean Embassy, said: "This
is another lie. Every statement Mr. Townley
makes about Chile is false."
New Federalism rebuffed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
controversial New Federalism and budget pro
posals both suffered public rebuffs yesterday.
The nation's governors at their annual meet
ing here voted 36-5 to adopt a counterproposal
on New Federalism that would defer "for
further negotiations" the Reagan plan to turn
full financial responsibility for welfare and food
stamps over to the states.
The welfare-food stamp turnover is a key part
of the plan Reagan unveiled in his State of the
Union address. Under the plan, the federal gov
ernment would assume all the costs of Medica
id.
Later in the day the chairmen of the Senate
and House budget committees both told the fis
cal affairs committee of the National Gov
ernors' Association that Reagan's budget could
not gain approval on Capitol Hill, mainly be
cause of its $91.5 billion deficit.
"I don't think as presently presented that it
has a significant chance," said Senate Budget
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.). "There are
probably not more than a handful of Re
publican or Democratic votes that would sup
port it," said House Budget Chairman James R.
Jones (D-Okla.).

Both chairmen recommended reducing the
president's proposed increase in defense
spending, slowing down the increased cost of
entitlement programs, such as Social Security,
and finding additional federal revenue through
changes in current tax law.
"The deficits are going to be larger than the
president predicted," Domenici said.
Salvadoran army stays neutral
San Salvador — The Salvadoran armed forces,
fearing a wave of terrorist attacks before the
March 28 election, promised yesterday not to
take sides with any of the seven political parties
vying for power here.
Earlier, the military had said that members-of
the armed forces would not be allowed to vote.
Yesterday's announcement was a blow to right
wing parties seeking the favor of the military
but it offered no support, either, to the Chris
tian Democratic leaders of the U.S.-backed ci
vilian-military junta.
"Our dedication is to the country and to the
people, and in no way will we accept alliances
with, nor will we support, any of the legally reg
istered parties," the defense Minister, Gen. Jose
Guillermo Garcia, said in a statement released
at a press conference.
Garcia prepared the statement after leaders
of the country's armed forces debated the mili
tary's stance toward the March 28 elections,
which are to seat a constitutional assembly that
will be able to set up a legal government.
The military has a reputation here of having
interfered with elections over the decades and
of having disallowed victories won by can
didates of whom it disapproved. The junta
headed by Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon
Duarte now runs El Salvador jointly with the mil
itary forces.
Market hits 21-month low
The stock market plunged to a 21-month low
yesterday in an afternoon selloff blamed on
mounting recession worries.
High-technology and health care stocks were
among the biggest losers in a session that began
with a rally and ended in a rout.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 8 points at the outset, was off 13.04 at
811.26 by the close.
The last time the widely recognized average
closed lower was May 12,1980, when it stood at
805.20.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow. Lows in the upper 30s
and 40s, highs in the upper 50s to mid-60s.
Northwesterly winds 10 to 20 mph.

Sugahara, a millionaire shipping magnate and chairman of the U.S.-
Asia Institute, called on the governors to submit suggestions for projects
in their states to the National Governors' Association's international
trade and foreign relations committee.
"We will ask the Japanese to form a parallel committee," Sugahara
said. "The U.S.-Asia Institute will coordinate between these two com
mittees" in deciding how to invest the funds, which are to be supplied
by private Japanese businessmen.
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan has more than doubled in the last
two years, soaring from $8 billion in 1979 to $18 billion last year. It is ex
pected to reach $20 billion this year.
Under the plan, projects in the United States would be financed
through low-interest loans. Among the projects expected to be pro
posed by the states are high-speed "bullet" trains in California and the
Northeast Corridor and improved port facilities to handle coal exports
from the West Coast, Sugahara said.
Formaldehyde foam insulation sales banned
Washington — The Consumer Product Safety Commission, citing
possible cancer hazards, ordered a ban yesterday on all future sales of
home insulation made with formaldehyde.
As many as half a million homes have been insulated with for
maldehyde foam since the mid-1970s as part of a massive government
campaign to convince homeowners to conserve energy.
Last year, formaldehyde foam sales totaled about $10 million.
Yesterday's ruling does not cover homes already insulated with for
maldehyde foam. Commission officials advise consumers to leave the
insulation alone if they have not experienced any health problems.
If problems have occurred, then consumers must solve them on their
own, perhaps by taking such drastic steps as ripping out the insulation.
Commission and industry officials estimate it could cost $15,000 to re
move existing formaldehyde insulation from homes — more than 10
times the original installation cost.
The commission, in a 4-to-1 vote, concluded that a ban was the only
effective way to protect consumers from the formaldehyde gas that is
frequently released after the insulation is installed.
Formaldehyde has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and in hu
mans it is known to cause such adverse health effects as nausea, head
aches, dizziness, respiratory ailments, bloody noses and eye and skin ir
ritations.
It was chiefly the fear that formaldehyde might cause cancer in hu
mans that led the commission to call the insulation an "unreasnable
health risk."
The commission rejected industry pleas for a less onerous regulatory
scheme — either labeling or a mandatory installation standard. The ban
is to take effect within five months, although the commission could
change that timetable.
Baker proposes defense surtax
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) yesterday suggested a fed
eral income surtax as one way of financing a mil
itary buildup while reducing deficits, and con
gressional budget leaders said President Ronald
Reagan's red-ink budget is all but dead on
Capitol Hill.
While even Baker aides characterized the sur
tax idea as just a "trial balloon," the proposal —
and others that surfaced as Congress returned
from a one-week recess — underscored mount
ing congressional determination to try to bring
down interest rates by reducing budget deficits.
Although Baker did not go into details, other
sources said a temporary surtax of 5 percent or
10 percent is being "discussed" among Senate
Republicans. They said a 10 percent surtax
would raise about $37 billion to help offset, or at
least meet, the projected $91.5 billion deficit for
next year.
That surtax would virtually wipe out the 10
percent tax cut that Congress has approved for
this year, although technically it would leave
the Reagan tax program in place. It also would
be raising taxes for another of Reagan's top
priorities: defense.
"It's a signal that we need to look at every
idea out there ... that something's got to be
done," said a Senate Republican leadership
aide.
Initial reaction from administration officials
was cool, but they did not immediately pop the
balloon.
Budget Director David Stockman said a de
fense surtax was "one of the more creative pro
posals" that Congress has made, although he
questioned such earmarking of tax revenues.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan also ex
pressed reservations but did not dismiss the
proposal outright, as he did another con
gressional budget alternative last week.
Chile, Letelier death linked
Washington — The Chilean government paid
legal fees and family support during 1978 and
1979 for Michael Townley, the man who was
convicted of plotting and helping to carry out
the car-bombing assassination in Washington
of exiled former Chilean diplomat Orlando
Letelier, according to private letters Townley
wrote from prison to officials in Chile.
Copies of 52 letters, covering the period from
June 1978, two months after Townley was
turned over to the United States by the Chilean
government, to October 1979, were obtained
by The Washington Post and authenticated by
federal officials.
The letters portray the still-imprisoned
Townley as frustrated and despondent over ef

forts by the Chilean government publicly to dis
associate itself from him, and by the slow
payment of his bills. At the same time, the let
ters contain assurances that Townley will con
ceal additional information concerning Chilean
intelligence activities — including contacts with
rightist European terrorists — from U.S. prose
cutors.
During the Letelier assassination trials, feder
al prosecutors presented extensive evidence
that Townley, an American citizen, was a senior
agent in Chile's intelligence service, then
known as DINA, and had carried out the Sep
tember 1976 assassination of Letelier and an as
sociate, Ronni K. Moffitt, under direct DINA or
ders. The Chilean government, which refused
to extradite three senior DINA officials who
were indicted in the case based on Townley's
testimony, at the time characterized Townley as
a low-level functionary in the secret police who
never was authorized to assassinate anyone.
Since then, Chile consistently has denied any
connection with Townley, including payment
of his legal and personal expenses. In Septem
ber of 1978, for example, Gen. Cesar Mendoza
Duran, a member of the Chilean junta de
nounced Townley as "an agent of the CIA, the
KGB and at the same time an agent of Cuba."
• Asked yesterday about the information con
tained in the Townley letters, Juan Prado, a
spokesman at the Chilean Embassy, said: "This
is another lie. Every statement Mr. Townley
makes about Chile is false."
New Federalism rebuffed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
controversial New Federalism and budget pro
posals both suffered public rebuffs yesterday.
The nation's governors at their annual meet
ing here voted 36-5 to adopt a counterproposal
on New Federalism that would defer "for
further negotiations" the Reagan plan to turn
full financial responsibility for welfare and food
stamps over to the states.
The welfare-food stamp turnover is a key part
of the plan Reagan unveiled in his State of the
Union address. Under the plan, the federal gov
ernment would assume all the costs of Medica
id.
Later in the day the chairmen of the Senate
and House budget committees both told the fis
cal affairs committee of the National Gov
ernors' Association that Reagan's budget could
not gain approval on Capitol Hill, mainly be
cause of its $91.5 billion deficit.
"I don't think as presently presented that it
has a significant chance," said Senate Budget
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.). "There are
probably not more than a handful of Re
publican or Democratic votes that would sup
port it," said House Budget Chairman James R.
Jones (D-Okla.).

Both chairmen recommended reducing the
president's proposed increase in defense
spending, slowing down the increased cost of
entitlement programs, such as Social Security,
and finding additional federal revenue through
changes in current tax law.
"The deficits are going to be larger than the
president predicted," Domenici said.
Salvadoran army stays neutral
San Salvador — The Salvadoran armed forces,
fearing a wave of terrorist attacks before the
March 28 election, promised yesterday not to
take sides with any of the seven political parties
vying for power here.
Earlier, the military had said that members-of
the armed forces would not be allowed to vote.
Yesterday's announcement was a blow to right
wing parties seeking the favor of the military
but it offered no support, either, to the Chris
tian Democratic leaders of the U.S.-backed ci
vilian-military junta.
"Our dedication is to the country and to the
people, and in no way will we accept alliances
with, nor will we support, any of the legally reg
istered parties," the defense Minister, Gen. Jose
Guillermo Garcia, said in a statement released
at a press conference.
Garcia prepared the statement after leaders
of the country's armed forces debated the mili
tary's stance toward the March 28 elections,
which are to seat a constitutional assembly that
will be able to set up a legal government.
The military has a reputation here of having
interfered with elections over the decades and
of having disallowed victories won by can
didates of whom it disapproved. The junta
headed by Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon
Duarte now runs El Salvador jointly with the mil
itary forces.
Market hits 21-month low
The stock market plunged to a 21-month low
yesterday in an afternoon selloff blamed on
mounting recession worries.
High-technology and health care stocks were

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 8 points at the outset, was off 13.04 at
811.26 by the close.
The last time the widely recognized average
closed lower was May 12,1980, when it stood at

Magnate offers U.S. $10-billion job fund
Washington — Calling it a "multi-billion dollar jumper cable" from a

Japanese-American businessman Kaytaro Sugahara yesterday laid

The U.S. trade deficit with Japan has more than doubled in the last
two years, soaring from $8 billion in 1979 to $18 billion last year. It is ex
pected to reach $20 billion this year.
Under the plan, projects in the United States would be financed
through low-interest loans. Among the projects expected to be pro
posed by the states are high-speed "bullet" trains in California and the
Northeast Corridor and improved port facilities to handle coal exports
from the West Coast, Sugahara said.
Formaldehyde foam insulation sales banned
Washington — The Consumer Product Safety Commission, citing
possible cancer hazards, ordered a ban yesterday on all future sales of
home insulation made with formaldehyde.
As many as half a million homes have been insulated with for
maldehyde foam since the mid-1970s as part of a massive government
campaign to convince homeowners to conserve energy.
Last year, formaldehyde foam sales totaled about $10 million.
Yesterday's ruling does not cover homes already insulated with for
maldehyde foam. Commission officials advise consumers to leave the
insulation alone if they have not experienced any health problems.
If problems have occurred, then consumers must solve them on their
own, perhaps by taking such drastic steps as ripping out the insulation.
Commission and industry officials estimate it could cost $15,000 to re
move existing formaldehyde insulation from homes — more than 10
times the original installation cost.
The commission, in a 4-to-1 vote, concluded that a ban was the only
effective way to protect consumers from the formaldehyde gas that is
frequently released after the insulation is installed.
Formaldehyde has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and in hu
mans it is known to cause such adverse health effects as nausea, head
aches, dizziness, respiratory ailments, bloody noses and eye and skin ir
ritations.
It was chiefly the fear that formaldehyde might cause cancer in hu
mans that led the commission to call the insulation an "unreasnable
health risk."
The commission rejected industry pleas for a less onerous regulatory
scheme — either labeling or a mandatory installation standard. The ban
is to take effect within five months, although the commission could
change that timetable.
Baker proposes defense surtax
Washington — Senate Majority Leader How
ard Baker (R-Tenn.) yesterday suggested a fed
eral income surtax as one way of financing a mil
itary buildup while reducing deficits, and con
gressional budget leaders said President Ronald
Reagan's red-ink budget is all but dead on
Capitol Hill.
While even Baker aides characterized the sur
tax idea as just a "trial balloon," the proposal —
and others that surfaced as Congress returned
from a one-week recess — underscored mount
ing congressional determination to try to bring
down interest rates by reducing budget deficits.
Although Baker did not go into details, other
sources said a temporary surtax of 5 percent or
10 percent is being "discussed" among Senate
Republicans. They said a 10 percent surtax
would raise about $37 billion to help offset, or at
least meet, the projected $91.5 billion deficit for
next year.
That surtax would virtually wipe out the 10
percent tax cut that Congress has approved for
this year, although technically it would leave
the Reagan tax program in place. It also would
be raising taxes for another of Reagan's top
priorities: defense.
"It's a signal that we need to look at every
idea out there ... that something's got to be
done," said a Senate Republican leadership
aide.
Initial reaction from administration officials
was cool, but they did not immediately pop the
balloon.
Budget Director David Stockman said a de
fense surtax was "one of the more creative pro
posals" that Congress has made, although he
questioned such earmarking of tax revenues.
Treasury Secretary Donald Regan also ex
pressed reservations but did not dismiss the
proposal outright, as he did another con
gressional budget alternative last week.
Chile, Letelier death linked
Washington — The Chilean government paid
legal fees and family support during 1978 and
1979 for Michael Townley, the man who was
convicted of plotting and helping to carry out
the car-bombing assassination in Washington
of exiled former Chilean diplomat Orlando
Letelier, according to private letters Townley
wrote from prison to officials in Chile.
Copies of 52 letters, covering the period from
June 1978, two months after Townley was
turned over to the United States by the Chilean
government, to October 1979, were obtained
by The Washington Post and authenticated by
federal officials.
The letters portray the still-imprisoned
Townley as frustrated and despondent over ef

forts by the Chilean government publicly to dis
associate itself from him, and by the slow
payment of his bills. At the same time, the let
ters contain assurances that Townley will con
ceal additional information concerning Chilean
intelligence activities — including contacts with
rightist European terrorists — from U.S. prose
cutors.
During the Letelier assassination trials, feder
al prosecutors presented extensive evidence
that Townley, an American citizen, was a senior
agent in Chile's intelligence service, then
known as DINA, and had carried out the Sep
tember 1976 assassination of Letelier and an as
sociate, Ronni K. Moffitt, under direct DINA or
ders. The Chilean government, which refused
to extradite three senior DINA officials who
were indicted in the case based on Townley's
testimony, at the time characterized Townley as
a low-level functionary in the secret police who
never was authorized to assassinate anyone.
Since then, Chile consistently has denied any
connection with Townley, including payment
of his legal and personal expenses. In Septem
ber of 1978, for example, Gen. Cesar Mendoza
Duran, a member of the Chilean junta de
nounced Townley as "an agent of the CIA, the
KGB and at the same time an agent of Cuba."
• Asked yesterday about the information con
tained in the Townley letters, Juan Prado, a
spokesman at the Chilean Embassy, said: "This
is another lie. Every statement Mr. Townley
makes about Chile is false."
New Federalism rebuffed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's
controversial New Federalism and budget pro
posals both suffered public rebuffs yesterday.
The nation's governors at their annual meet
ing here voted 36-5 to adopt a counterproposal
on New Federalism that would defer "for
further negotiations" the Reagan plan to turn
full financial responsibility for welfare and food
stamps over to the states.
The welfare-food stamp turnover is a key part
of the plan Reagan unveiled in his State of the
Union address. Under the plan, the federal gov
ernment would assume all the costs of Medica
id.
Later in the day the chairmen of the Senate
and House budget committees both told the fis
cal affairs committee of the National Gov
ernors' Association that Reagan's budget could
not gain approval on Capitol Hill, mainly be
cause of its $91.5 billion deficit.
"I don't think as presently presented that it
has a significant chance," said Senate Budget
Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.). "There are
probably not more than a handful of Re
publican or Democratic votes that would sup
port it," said House Budget Chairman James R.
Jones (D-Okla.).

Both chairmen recommended reducing the
president's proposed increase in defense
spending, slowing down the increased cost of
entitlement programs, such as Social Security,
and finding additional federal revenue through
changes in current tax law.
"The deficits are going to be larger than the
president predicted," Domenici said.
Salvadoran army stays neutral
San Salvador — The Salvadoran armed forces,
fearing a wave of terrorist attacks before the
March 28 election, promised yesterday not to
take sides with any of the seven political parties
vying for power here.
Earlier, the military had said that members-of
the armed forces would not be allowed to vote.
Yesterday's announcement was a blow to right
wing parties seeking the favor of the military
but it offered no support, either, to the Chris
tian Democratic leaders of the U.S.-backed ci
vilian-military junta.
"Our dedication is to the country and to the
people, and in no way will we accept alliances
with, nor will we support, any of the legally reg
istered parties," the defense Minister, Gen. Jose
Guillermo Garcia, said in a statement released
at a press conference.
Garcia prepared the statement after leaders
of the country's armed forces debated the mili
tary's stance toward the March 28 elections,
which are to seat a constitutional assembly that
will be able to set up a legal government.
The military has a reputation here of having
interfered with elections over the decades and
of having disallowed victories won by can
didates of whom it disapproved. The junta
headed by Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon
Duarte now runs El Salvador jointly with the mil
itary forces.
Market hits 21-month low
The stock market plunged to a 21-month low
yesterday in an afternoon selloff blamed on
mounting recession worries.
High-technology and health care stocks were

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 8 points at the outset, was off 13.04 at
811.26 by the close.
The last time the widely recognized average
closed lower was May 12,1980, when it stood at

Magnate offers U.S. $10-billion job fund
Washington — Calling it a "multi-billion dollar jumper cable" from a
Toyota to spark "the gigantic Cadillac limousine" of the U.S. economy,
Japanese-American businessman Kaytaro Sugahara yesterday laid
before the nation's governors his proposal for a $10-billion Japanese
fund to foster jobs in the United States.
Sugahara, a millionaire shipping magnate and chairman of the U.S.-
Asia Institute, called on the governors to submit suggestions for projects
in their states to the National Governors' Association's international
trade and foreign relations committee.
"We will ask the Japanese to form a parallel committee," Sugahara
said. "The U.S.-Asia Institute will coordinate between these two com
mittees" in deciding how to invest the funds, which are to be supplied
by private Japanese businessmen.
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan has more than doubled in the last
