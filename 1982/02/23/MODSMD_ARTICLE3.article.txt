Magnate offers U.S. $10-billion job fund
Washington — Calling it a "multi-billion dollar jumper cable" from a
Toyota to spark "the gigantic Cadillac limousine" of the U.S. economy,
Japanese-American businessman Kaytaro Sugahara yesterday laid
before the nation's governors his proposal for a $10-billion Japanese
fund to foster jobs in the United States.
Sugahara, a millionaire shipping magnate and chairman of the U.S.-
Asia Institute, called on the governors to submit suggestions for projects
in their states to the National Governors' Association's international
trade and foreign relations committee.
"We will ask the Japanese to form a parallel committee," Sugahara
said. "The U.S.-Asia Institute will coordinate between these two com
mittees" in deciding how to invest the funds, which are to be supplied
by private Japanese businessmen.
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan has more than doubled in the last
two years, soaring from $8 billion in 1979 to $18 billion last year. It is ex
pected to reach $20 billion this year.
Under the plan, projects in the United States would be financed
through low-interest loans. Among the projects expected to be pro
posed by the states are high-speed "bullet" trains in California and the
Northeast Corridor and improved port facilities to handle coal exports
from the West Coast, Sugahara said.
Formaldehyde foam insulation sales banned
Washington — The Consumer Product Safety Commission, citing
possible cancer hazards, ordered a ban yesterday on all future sales of
home insulation made with formaldehyde.
As many as half a million homes have been insulated with for
maldehyde foam since the mid-1970s as part of a massive government
campaign to convince homeowners to conserve energy.
Last year, formaldehyde foam sales totaled about $10 million.
Yesterday's ruling does not cover homes already insulated with for
maldehyde foam. Commission officials advise consumers to leave the
insulation alone if they have not experienced any health problems.
If problems have occurred, then consumers must solve them on their
own, perhaps by taking such drastic steps as ripping out the insulation.
Commission and industry officials estimate it could cost $15,000 to re
move existing formaldehyde insulation from homes — more than 10
times the original installation cost.
The commission, in a 4-to-1 vote, concluded that a ban was the only
effective way to protect consumers from the formaldehyde gas that is
frequently released after the insulation is installed.
Formaldehyde has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and in hu
mans it is known to cause such adverse health effects as nausea, head
aches, dizziness, respiratory ailments, bloody noses and eye and skin ir
ritations.
It was chiefly the fear that formaldehyde might cause cancer in hu
mans that led the commission to call the insulation an "unreasnable
health risk."
The commission rejected industry pleas for a less onerous regulatory
scheme — either labeling or a mandatory installation standard. The ban
is to take effect within five months, although the commission could
change that timetable.
