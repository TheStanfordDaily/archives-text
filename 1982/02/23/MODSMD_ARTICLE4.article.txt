# State assembly drops bill for representation
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
The California Assembly yesterday
defeated a bill proposed by local As
sembly Rep. Byron Sher (D-21st Dis
trict) which would have assured rep
resentation in the State Senate be
tween 1982 and 1984 for some 600,000
local residents, including those who
live in Stanford, Palo Alto and other
local communities.
Representation is scheduled to be
suspended for that time as a result of
the controversial reapportionment
plan approved last year by the Cali
fornia State Legislature. The plan is
being challenged in court by the Re
publican Party.
The Palo Alto City Council voted
last night to join another lawsuit over
lack of representation being filed by
by the cities of San Mateo, Redwood
City, Belmont, San Carlos, Foster
City, Half Moon Bay, Woodside,
Cupertino, Los Altos and Los Gatos,
and by San Mateo County.
San Mateo City Attorney Doug
Dang said the suit will claim local
citizens are being denied equal pro
tection because they will have no
representative. "We are not trying to
change the lines which were drawn,"
Dang said.
Under the legislature's plan, the
10th and 12th Districts, represented
by Republicans Marz Garcia and Dan
O'Keefe, have been combined to
form District 11, stretching from San
Mateo to Los Gatos.
Sher's bill called for a change of
numbers between the new district 11
here and district 5 in Sacramento,
and a similar switch between districts
32 and 37 in Orange County, so that
these districts would have elections
every four years.
Reapportionment takes place ev
ery 10 years following completion of
the federal census. Legislative dis
tricts are redrawn to assure that dis
tricts have equal populations.
1.-: 1982, according to state law, all
even-numbered districts will hold
senate elections. Odd-numbered
districts will hold elections in 1984.
This leaves the district without a
senator for two years because the
terms of Garcia and O'Keefe, who
were elected in 1978, expire at the
end of this year.
"There's no catch," said Jim
Bourgart, legislative assistant to Re
publican Senate Floor Leader Bob
Naylor. "It's hard to believe, it's dis

graceful, but they did it."
Bourgart said heavily Republican
areas here and in Orange County
would not have elections in six years,
while some strongly Democratic
areas of the state where district num
bers were changed would have elec
tions after only two years.
Melanie Adams-Darling, staff
member of the Senate Election and
Reapportionment Committee, de
fended the switch. "When the popu
lations of districts change, you're
going to have to move people
around" to assure that voters are rep
resented equally, she said. In a state
which has staggered elections, it is in
evitable that some people will have
their representation deferred, she
said, while others will get to vote
twice in two years.
The committee has kept such dis
ruption to a minimum, Adams-Darl
ing said. A plan drawn up under the
guidance of the State Supreme Court
in 1973 resulted in 18 counties
switching their district numbers, she
said, while current plans require only
10 such switches. Under the commit
tee's plan, "70 percent of the changes
give people an opportunity to vote
after two years," she added.
"It's a very political issue," Sher
said shortly before the measure was
killed. In the Committee on Elections
and Reapportionment, "all the
negative votes were Democrats."
Adams-Darling of the committee
said Sher's bill was unconstitutional
because districts must be numbered
consecutively from north to south of
the state.
"The (current) senate bill is not
perfect in that respect either," Sher
replied.
The Republican party has taken the
issue to the California Supreme
Court. The Justice Department has
declined to intervene because the
reapportionment had "no dis
criminatory effect or purpose,"
Adams-Darling said.
Bourgart said the reapportionment
was politically motivated and blamed
senate majority leader Dave Roberti
for the renumbering. Mel Osca of
Sen. Roberti's office said it was "part
ly correct" that the senator pushed
the measure through, but that he was
"not directly involved" in the re
numbering. That was decided by the
Elections and Reapportionment
Committee, he said.
