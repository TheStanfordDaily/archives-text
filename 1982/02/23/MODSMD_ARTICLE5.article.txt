# Palo Alto City Council votes to sue state
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night voted to join a lawsuit by sever
al neighboring communities against
the state because the area will have
no state senator between the end of
this year and 1984.
The council also approved an or
dinance which may put a snag in
plans to convert the Oak Creek
Apartments to condominiums and
recommended that the state enact a
law prohibiting bicyclists from wear
ing stereo headphones.
Palo Alto Mayor Fred Eyerly said
before last night's meeting that Palo
Alto would join the representation
suit if the council determined the suit
was not a partisan one. Republicans
have objected to the reapportion
ment plan which was drawn up and
passed in the legislature, in which the

Democrats have a majority.
The council approved an or
dinance regulating the resale of
housing financed with Santa Clara
County mortgage revenue bonds.
Scott Carey, a developer who plans
to convert the 750 Oak Creek apart
ments on land owned by Stanford to
condominiums, objected to the or
dinance, which requires that the city
receive the first right of refusal on
any housing unit financed with these
funds. Carey's Oak Creek Associates
have applied to use mortgage reven
ue bonds to assist low and moderate
income buyers to purchase con
dominium units.
Carey said that Stanford, which
had put up some $20 million for the
project in exchange for a guarantee
of ownership of 200 of the units, had
been guaranteed the right of first re

fusal on the remaining units.
A right of first refusal means that a
party must be the first to be asked to
purchase a unit that is available for
sale. If that party refuses, the owner is
then free to sell the unit to someone
else.
That right is "an integral part of my
agreement with Stanford," Carey
said outside the meeting. He said last
night's vote was another impediment
to a project that may not get off the
ground.
Council member Ellen Fletcher re
quested that the council ask the state
to enact a law prohibiting bicyclists
from wearing stereo headphones
while riding. The council approved
that resolution, citing safety hazards
involved. Drivers of; motor vehicles
are currently prohibited from wear
ing such headsets.

The city's staff was directed to re
view how the city monitors ground
water quality. Council member
Fletcher said monitoring of
chemicals is currently performed by
the fire department, which wants
some industrial products stored un
derground to prevent explosions and
fires. However, some would prefer
chemicals to be stored above ground
where there was less chance they
would seep intothe city's ground wa
ter. Although Palo Alto's main water
supply does not come from ground
water, the city's emergency supplies
are composed of groundwater.
Council member Emily Renzel said
she presumed companies were
aware of the problems caused by im
proper storage of chemicals and that
companies should be responsible for
what they store.
