# Ex-employee attacks secret CIA operations
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Former CIA agent John Stockwell
described the CIA as a "rogue
elephant leading the government
where it wants to go around the
world" and compared reports of es
calating U.S. involvement in Central
America to his experiences as Angola
Task Force commander under the
National Security Council during the
Angolan crisis.
"It smells so much like Angola,"
Stockwell said to more than 100 peo
ple at the Center for Educational Re
search and Study (CERAS).
Stockwell worked for ten years on
African operations and for three
years in Vietnam, immediately fol
lowing the withdrawal of most Amer
ican troops in 1973. Throughout his
career with the agency, Stockwell be
came increasingly alarmed at the na
ture of CIA operations.
"The secrecy," Stockwell said, "is
designed to prevent Americans from
knowing what the CIA is doing."

"I could see too many cases that
the CIA had done what it had wanted
to do, then set up the president and
lied to him," he said.
Stockwell claimed that ClA
directed actions have resulted in the
deaths of 800,000 people around the
world, including 500,000 casualties
from the Vietnam war and 300,000
deaths resulting from other opera
tions as cited in a Senate Foreign Re


John Stockwell
lations Committee report.
"How many people are we willing
to kill in El Salvador, Nicaragua orany
of the rest of these places?"
Stockwell asked. "At what point do
you lose your moral leadership of the
world?"
In Angola, Stockwell said the CIA
covertly fought a war against Soviet
backed and Cuban regular forces
while American leaders openly
deplored any form of violence or in
tervention by other countries.
"We were fighting it secretly with

the CIA," Stockwell said.
"We lied extensively throughout
this program," he continued, "and
we were shackled by those lies. We
lied to the president and we lied to
the Senate Oversight Committee
about what we were doing."
Disillusioned by the nature and
mentality of CIA operations,
Stockwell left the agency in 1977 to
write In Search of Enemies, a book
describing covert actions conducted
by the CIA in Angola.
In 1978, the federal government
sued Stockwell, winning an injunc
tion that requires that he submit for
review any publication discussing the
agency.
