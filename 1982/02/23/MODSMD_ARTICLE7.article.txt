# Cartoonist criticizes 'restrictive' comics
## 
### Anthea Stratigos 
Comic strip author Bill Griffith
last night said the initial shock val
ue of the underground comics of
the '60s and 70s has dissipated and
that creators of today's under
ground characters are seeking ac
ceptance from the mainstream
audiences which their predeces
sors did not reach.
He also said that such contem
porary popular comic strips as
"Doonesbury," "Garfield" and
"Fred Bassett," look "too restric
tive and censored ... (They're)
just there with your morning cof
fee."
He spoke in Cubberley Hall to
an audience of about 150, some of
whom were dressed as his interna
tionally known comic character
"Zippy the Pinhead."
In his talk on the history of un
derground comics, Griffith said
that underground comics have
never been the same since Mad

magazine began, and called the
magazine an inspiration for the
underground comics of the '60s
and 70s. He also credited
"Popeye the Sailor" with touching
"the American nerve" with his "I
am what I am" philosophy.
Underground comics, which of
fer satire on conventional ways of
life often are liberating to their
adult audiences and give them the
feeling of "giddiness," says Grif
fith.
Such characters as "the Freak
Brothers," "Di Di," "Fritz the Cat"
and Griffith's own "Toadettes"
are meant to parody the reading
audience, he said.
The audience laughed when
Griffith, asserting that his charac
ters' purpose was to make people
question themselves and their dai
ly lifestyles, gave slide examples of
"Zippy" in zany action. But he said
that "Zippy," whom he c reated in
the mid-'7os, had "socially re
deeming qualities." For instance,
a concerned "Zippy" was shown
telling a man eating a hot dog he
was "too tan and beefy looking"
to send pig grounds and linoleum

down his gullet.
Griffith is being paid $1000 by
the ASSU Guest Professorship
Board for his two-day stay at the
University. Today he will give a
workshop in the Cummings Art
Building and will speak at a sherry
hour this afternoon in Branner
lounge.
