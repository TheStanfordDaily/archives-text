## Brain deterioration threatens 4 million Americans 
### Bruce Quinn 
Severe, progressive and ir
reversible brain damage afflicts
more than one million Ameri
cans. Mild to moderate brain
deterioration affects more than
three million more, and repre
sents one of the major threats
to quality of life forthe increas
ing proportion of Americans
over age 60.
Historically, a decline in
brain function, medically
known as dementia, was
viewed as an inevitable part of
aging and was usually at
tributed to "hardening of the
arteries." But in the last 10
years, new research has
challenged this view, through
the discovery of numerous
biochemical and cellular
changes which may lead to
premature cell death in the
brain.
A major focus of current re
search is to understand exactly
what causes these changes, and
why they suddenly strike some
individuals in their 50s and 60s,
while others remain mentally
active into their ninth decade
of life.

Although dementia, defined
by memory loss, disorientation
and personality disintegration,
may have a number of causes,
more than half of the demen
tias in persons over age 60 are
now being attributed to
Alzheimer's disease, a
diagnosis once reserved for
cases where certain neu
robiological changes began in
mid-life. Alzheimer-type men
tal decline is an increasing na
tional health problem, since
dementia afflects 5-10 percent
of individuals over age 65, an
age group which has tripled in
proportion since 1900, and will
triple again in the next 20 years.
According to Dr. Leslie
Dorfman, associate professor
of neurology here, "we would
like to believe that, with in
creasing average lifespan,
mental function will remain
high. But in fact, for a signifi
cant proportion of the popu
lation, this is not so."
An individual with
Alzheimer's disease may ex
perience months or even a few
years of increasing for
getfulness before memory im

pairment and associated be
havioral changes become se
vere enough to attract the at
tention of family and friends.
According to Dorfman, the first
approach to clinical signs of in
creasing cognitive impairment

An individual with Alzheimer's disease
may experience months or even a few
years of increasing forgetfulness before
memory impairment and associated
behavioral changes become severe
enough to attract the attention of family
and friends.

is to rule out causes such as
tumors, hormonal problems,
and infections involving the
brain. No effective treatments
for progressive Alzheimer
type decline are known, and
the patient requires increasing
amounts of care.
"People should be aware of
the inadequacy of the medical
care system in the face of this
kind of problem," said Dr. Wil
liam Hoffman, professor of
neurology. "It is a social, eco
nomic and political problem,
requiring teams to deal with
the patient and family as the
patient requires chronic and

increasing care. Because of the
social stigma associated with
brain disease, the family must
often deal both with the loss of
a loved one who is physically
'still there,' and the lack of un
derstanding by others of what

they're going through."
Although no specific treat
ment is known, a number of
hypotheses have been pro
posed for the cause of
Alzheimer's disease. A cardinal
sign of the disease is tangled
neurofilaments, which nor
mally support the transport of
materials from the nerve's cell
body through the cell's long
axon to its terminals. This dis
ruption of neurofilaments may
in turn impair the neuron's
ability to signal messages to
other neurons.
A second cause of dys
function may be decline in

concentrations of a neu
rotransmitter, acetylcholine,
which is found in brain areas
associated with memory. This
finding led some researchers to
give patients drugs boosting
acetylcholine activity, a line ot
research which proved unsuc
cessful.
Other researchers have
noted an increase in brain
aluminum, which is toxic to
neurons. However, it is not
clear whether this is a cause of
cell death, or merely the result
of a previous defect in cell ac
tivity. Although a few rare vi
ruses causing brain cell death
are known, there is no con
clusive evidence that a virus
causes Alzheimer-type demen
tia.
Dr. Jerome Yesavage, assis
tant professorof psychiatry and
director of psychiatric in
tensive care at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hos
pital, has suggested that there
may be a decline in the effec
tiveness of enzymes for sugar
metabolism, due to ac
cumulated DNA damage as
neurons age. Because brain
cells are highly active
metabolically, a decline in
enzyme action could cause
dysfunction and eventual cell
death. This theory is consistent

with reports that a combina
tion of "metabolic enhancers"
and neurotransmitters may
produce some reduction in
cognitive decline. If so, even
tually a drug treatment may be
found which compensates for
most biochemical changes
before they result in cell death.
Yesavage is also conducting
research on psychological
therapy which has benefits for
the mildly impaired, and in
cases where poor memory
function is related to depres
sion. However, such therapy is
less productive when dementia
reaches advanced stages.

In California, a pilot project
first funded in 1979 provides
consultation to help families
react to the short and long
term need<; they face to sup
port a family member with
brain damage. Karla Griffin, of
the Family Survival Project in
San Francisco, said that helping
families with an Alzheimer's
patient is a major part of their
work. "Once family members
find out that they are not alone,
and that the behavioral
changes are an organic disease
problem, they are better able
to cope with the strain of grief
and 24-hour care demands,"
said Griffin.
