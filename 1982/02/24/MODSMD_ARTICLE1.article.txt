# Times college guide proves controversial

Stanford boasts a comprehensive
rating matched by only two other
schools in the nation, according to
The New York Times' Selective Guide
to Colleges.
The recently published catalogue,
which was edited by Edward Fiske,
Times education editor, also gave
Brown University and the University
of Virginia five-star ratings for aca
demics and "quality of life" and four
stars for social life.
However, the assessment which
ranks Stanford so highly is not quite
as generous to other universities, and
it has touched off a flurry of con
troversy nationwide. Schools not in
cluded in the upper echelons and
educators both question the validity
of the study, especially the system of
ranking schools' academic programs,
social life, and general quality of life
on a scale of one to five stars.
Ray Hornback, vice president for
university relations of the University
of Kentucky, (which received a one
star academic rating), was one of
those dissatisfied with the survey.
"We question the methodology," he
told Newsweek recently.
In the meantime, Fiske maintained
that "the stars weren't designed to
add up to which school is best," ac
cording to Newsweek.
From the nation's approximately
2000 four-year colleges and univer
sities, Fiske compiled descriptions of
265 which were either "well-known
or unique in some way." In addition
to a two or three page description of
the school, each was assigned a rank
ing, on a scale of one to five, of its ac
ademic program, campus social life
and overall quality of life.
Other campuses which received
perfect scores in the quality of life
category were: Long Island Univer
sity, Arizona State University, Ben
nington College, UC-Santa Cruz,
University of Colorado at Boulder,
Earlham University in Indiana, and
Evergreen State University in Wash
ington.
Both "the Stanford of the

East"( Harvard) and its traditional Ivy
League rival, Yale University, each
only received 12 out of a possible 15
ratings points, tying with 19 other col
leges for third place.
Each summary also contained
comments on specific departments,
highlighting areas of particular
strength. Stanford was cited for "an
unusual major in human biology ...
which gets rave reviews," the"luxury
and leisure of the overseas cam
puses," and the mixture of high
caliber work and laid-back quality
which "seems to thrive under the
Western sun."
The write-up the University re
ceives seems to be a fitting trans
lation of its ratings. "Take an Ivy
League university," the summary be
gins, "plunk it down on a campus
replete with palm treesand low Me
diterranean-style buildings with red
roofs, add a bunch of former high
school valedictorians wearing san
dals and riding expensive 10-speed
bikes, and you can name it Stanford
University."
Stanford casts a giant shadow, ac
cording to the guide â€” all the way to
Southern California and beyond.
Pomona College, a selective private
college in Claremont, Calif., "has the
burden of living in the shadow of
Stanford." In that respect, it is com
parable to Tufts University in Boston,
"often considered a haven for
Harvard rejects."
The three-page summary de
scribed Stanford as the "lone private
university in its area of the country to
move into the top ranks of American
higher education." Though one out
of-stater found "more seemingly
empty California blonds" than she
expected, the summary noted that
"achievement is the name of the
game among undergraduates, and a
preprofessional attitude pervades
much of the curriculum .. . Scratch
the surface, though, and you find
plenty of low-profile, hard-working
intellectuals."
Carol Capelli, a 1978 graduate of
Brown who is presently a doctoral
candidate in psychology here, said
she feels that both schools generally
merit the ratings given them. Like
Stanford, "it's possible to get an ex
cellent undergraduate education at
Brown, but it depends on the stu
dent's initiative."
In order to gather the information
needed for such a voluminous study
of so many schools, the Times used
regular reporters,questioned admin
istrators at each school, and dis
tributed questionnaires to its "str
ingers" from various universities
around the nation.
Seth Zuckerman, who contributed
to the Stanford report and "recog
nizes about half the content, plus
quite a few phrases" as his own, is a
senior majoring in energy studies
here.
Daily editor Joan O'Connell also
contributed to the report.
