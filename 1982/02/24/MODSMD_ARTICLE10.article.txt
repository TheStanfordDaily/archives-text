# Actors contest Asner policies

### 
Los Angeles (AP) — It's the stuff that motion
picture and television dramas are made of —
Ben-Hur vs. Lou Grant — but the battle is not
Hollywood make-believe.
Since January, a fight for philosophical control
of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the powerful
50,000-member actors union, has divided the
entertainment industry and led to a death threat
and a recall movement against its president, Ed
Asner, star of television's "Lou Grant."
"This whole thing has gotten out of hand,"
said one SAG official who asked not to be identi
fied.
The drama began in January when SAG first
awarded its annual award to Ronald Reagan, a
six-time president of the union, and then re
tracted it.
That move, ostensibly over the president's
handling of the air controllers strike last sum
mer, was bitterly criticized by actor and former
SAG president Charlton Heston as "a gross
blunder" and an "example of the radicalization
of the Guild."
The White House had no comment on the
award's withdrawal.
Heston, star of such movie hits as "The Ten
Commandments" and "Ben-Hur," said that
SAG, with Asner as president, has drifted deeper
into political waters. He pointed to a movement
to merge three actors unions, plus the Guild's
donation of money last summer to the striking

air traffic controllers and a board resolution in
December that the union speak out more on po
litical issues — including endorsement of can
didates.
"Actors are very touchy about having people
speak for them," Heston said in an interview.
"What they want from their union is attention to
the jobs problem," in an industry where, he said,
76 percent of the SAG members earned lessthan
$2500 last year.
The death threat against Asner surfaced last
Wednesday when a man called SAG head
quarters and told his secretary a group was "out
to get" the actor for his aid to rebels in El
Salvador.
The caller referred to a Washington news con
ference Asner and several other prominent ac
tors held Feb. 15 to announce a $1 million fund
raising drive to send medical supplies into vio
lence-tom El Salvador through left-wing guer
rillas.
Bodyguards have been assigned to Asner, se
curity guards were posted at the entrance to the
"Lou Grant" set, security was increased at the
studio gates and Asner has temporarily stopped
giving interviews, said his spokesman Mike
Mamakos.
Also on Wednesday, SAG member Tony
Cecere began a drive to unseat Asner and
claimed he had already gathered 300 signatures.
