## Right-wingers pressure Reagan 
### Washington Post 
Washington — One of the lesser-noted
accomplishments of President Ronald
Reagan's first year in office was his success
in separating hiseconomicprogram from a
set of divisive civil rights and conservative
social issues.
But today, pressure from the political
right that helped elect Reagan, and a series
of seemingly unrelated actions by his ad
ministration, has plunged the president
into a far-reaching and potentially treach
erous agenda on issues that deeply divide
the nation.
Theagenda includes efforts to end legal
ized abortion, ease enforcement of job
discrimination laws, restore prayer in pub
lic schools, halt "judicial activism" in fed
eral courts, alter the way school integra
tion and voting rights cases are handled
and diminish federal efforts in seeking ra
cial and sexual equality.
The agenda does not exist in any presi
dential pronouncement or legislative
package. And there is no David Stockman
of civil rights or social issues to frame an
overall strategy.
But an unmistakable pattern emerges
from the words and actions of the Reagan
administration.
It involves the reversal of a host of ac
tions by Republican and Democratic presi
dents, bipartisan majorities of Congress
and federal courts during the last 25 years.
Among the recent moves:
•In 1972, the Supreme Court in Swann

vs. Charlotte-Mecklenburg County unani
mously ruled that busing and quotas were
appropriate ways of ending school segre
gation. The case set public policy for
almost a decade.
Under Reagan, the Justice Department
has abandoned busing as a remedy in
school desegregation cases, and reversed
decisions on several sensitive desegrega
tion plans. Last week, for example, it pro
posed a voluntary plan in Chicago that in
volves no mandatory busing.
•In 1964, the Civil Rights Act began a
steady expansion of equal opportunity
laws, including such affirmative action
measures as quotas and timetables as rem
edies for job discrimination. The Equal Em
ployment Opportunity Commission was
set up that same year.
Under Reagan, the Departments of La
bor and Justice have taken steps to ban the
use of quotas and generally eased enforce
ment. A recent Justice Department settle
ment of a New Hampshire state police
case, for example, called for "recruitment
goals" instead of quotas for hiring minor
ities and women.
•In 1957, underthe Eisenhower adminis
tration, the Commission on Civil Rights
was established as an independent, in
formation-gathering body to serve as the
conscience of the government on racial
equality. Every president since has ap
pointed well-known figures, including
university presidents, former Cabinet
members and former governors, to the

commission.
Reagan recently broke that tradition by
nominating Sam Hart, a black evangelist
unknown to civil rights groups as well as
Republican leaders in Hart's home state, to
the commission.
Hart, backed for the job by fundamen
talist religious groups, said he opposes the
Equal Rights Amendment, busing to inte
grate public schools and the concept of
civil rights for homosexuals.
• In 1970, Richard Nixon approved a poli
cy later followed by Gerald Ford and Jim
my Carter that denied tax-exempt status to
private schools that discriminate.
In January, the administration aban
doned the policy, restoring tax exemp
tions for schools that discriminate against
minorities. When the decision came under
severe criticism, the president said he
thought the matter should be dealt with by
congressional rather than administrative
action.
•Since the mid-19605, federal courts
have repeatedly stepped into sensitive
areas of public policy, such as racial dis
crimination and abortion, on grounds that
issues involved are so fundamental that
they cannot be left to majority rule.
Under Reagan, Attorney General Wil
liam French Smith has led a well-or
chestrated attack on "judicial activism."
He has accused "unelected judges" of
substituting "their own policy preferences
for the determinations of the public's
elected representatives."
