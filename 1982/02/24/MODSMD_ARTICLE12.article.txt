# New Orleans faces another Mardi Gras
## 
### 
New Orleans (AP) — A
black-faced King Zulu took to
the streets today with his pa
rade of coconut-throwing rev
elers in outlandish grass skirts
and feathers as Mardi Gras
began, the final day of a two
week Carnival celebration
before Lent.
The weather was perfect —
clear blue skies with tem
peratures rising to the mid-80s
— and the crowds began jam
ming parade routes shortly af
ter daylight.
Zulu, the black community's
traditional satire of the pom
pous side of Mardi Gras, fea
tured the traditional long line
of floats ridden by black
dignitaries in black-face.

The Zulu parade began on
schedule at 8:30 a.m., the first
of the day's paradesthat will in
clude the city's top celebra
tion, involving Rex, king of
Carnival.
William Reily 111 of Metairie,
president of a coffee company
that bears his name, will serve
as Rex. Katherine Waters of
New Orleans, a junior at the
University of Alabama, is his
consort.
Fashionable St. Charles Ave.
along the parade routes was
blocked early this morning. En
trances from interstates into
the city were jammed, and
some roads were barricaded.
Traffic over the Mississippi
River bridge was slow.

The jails were already
jammed with more than 2800
prisoners, and more than 150
state police had been sent in to
help free police for parade
duties.
U.S. District Judge Frank
Polozola, who has ordered
Sheriff Charles Foti to limit the
inmate population, relaxed his
orders somewhat for the 14-
day Carnival season.
Polozola, who is overseeing
lawsuits attacking overcrowd
ing in the jails, met with Foti on
Monday to discuss the prob
lems.
"I think he's satisfied," Foti
said after the meeting. "We've
done what we needed to do —
protect the citizens and the

tourists from the unlawful ele
ment and remain within the
court-imposed (jail popu
lation) limits.
"Thank God it only comes
once a year," said Foti.
Mayor Dutch Morial praised
police and citizens Monday for
the lack of any serious violence
and called for restraint. "The
response has been tremen
dous," he said.
Police reported many minor
incidents, including picked
pockets, some snatched purses
and several booze-inspired fis
tfights.
The festivities officially end
at midnight, when revelers
usher in Lent.
