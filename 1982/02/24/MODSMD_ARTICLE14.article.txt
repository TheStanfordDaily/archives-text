Sophomore Karen Whitaker paid for fall
quarterout of herown savings, she hastwo
jobs and a Guaranteed Student Loan to pay
for winter quarter. Now she asks,"How am I
going to pay for spring quarter?"
Whitaker says she is caught in the middle —
her father's assets are too high for her to
recieve financial aid, yet she may not be able
to pay for spring registration.
When she applied late for financial aid, the
Financial Aid Office (FAO) told her she was
not eligible because her father owns an
expensive house in LakeTahoe. Yetshesaid
his assets are tied up because he cannot sell
the house at current interest rates.
"It really doesn't look on a piece of paper
like I need any help," she said, "but my father
doesn't have any money right now."
Assets which are tied up (or not liquid) are a
problem for the FAO, according to Assistant
Director Vincent De Anda. "We can't expect
parents to sell their home and property," he
said. The FAO usually tries to provide loans in
such a situation, he said.
But Whitaker has not yet recieved any aid

package. "It was never really resolved, and I
haven't gotten any information about my
package," she said.
According to De Anda, cases in which need
is difficult to determine often take longer
time to process. "If something in the
application isn't clear, ittakestime," he said.
Whitaker said she understands and expects
delays from the FAO."Those people who
work there are only human," she said, was
nonetheless upset by an earlier incident with
the FAO which wasseparate from her
applicationforaid.
When she first discovered her financial
problem her employer suggested she apply
to the Bernard Osher Foundation fora
scholarship. As part of her application she
needed a cover letter from the FAO saying
she was on file as an applicant. She said she
gave the scholarship application to the FAO
and asked them to send it wit ha cover letter
to the foundation.
Her employer later told her the foundation
had never received her application. "I was
really upset because they were jeopardizing
my chance of gettingthe scholarship,"she

said.
When she called the FAO to ask why her
application was never sent, someone told her
the person responsible forthe cover letter
was on varation. "I felt it was very unfair," she
said. '
According to De Anda, there is sometimes
a delay in filling out forms for outside
agencies depending on the time of year.
"We're limited in staff," he said, "and we
have different priorities at different times of
the year."
Whitaker said she is able to juggle her two
jobs and herstudying without too much
frustration. "I enjoy both jobs," she said. "It
lakes up some of my time, but I don't
consider it too much of a hardship."
She hasconsidered transferring to
Berkeley because, "it's a hell of a lot
cheaper."
"Sometimes when I'm down I think that
going to a private college is too much of a
luxury," she said. "I have thought about
transferring , but I don't want to do it. I like it
here. I try to keep a positive attitude. I'll get
through here if I really wantto."
