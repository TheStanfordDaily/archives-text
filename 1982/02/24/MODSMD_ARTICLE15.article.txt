Without financial aid, sophomore Cecile
Leßoux could not have come to Stanford.
Now, she may have to leave unlessshe gets
more aid.
"At Christmas my parentstold methere's
no more money left to pay for school,"
Leßoux explained. She went to the Financial
Aids Office (FAO) to ask why the FAO
expected her parents to be able to contribute
money they actually did not have."lt wasa
confrontation between me who sees the
reality and they who look at last year's
information," she said. The FAO had based
their decision on the application she wrote
last spring.
Leßoux appealed the FAO decision,
presenting new information about her
father's income. The FAO reviewed her
application and sent hera newfinancial aid
package last week. Her case is an example of
the F AO's flexible appeals process.
But in spite of the new aid package, Leßoux
said she may have to transfer to Berkeley for a
year or two to save money. "I havean
application to Berkeleysittingon my desk,"
she said, "and every time I look at it I get so
upset."
For Leßoux, adjustingtoStanfordasa
freshman was difficult and she does not want
to have to go through the process again. "I
would have rather had to adapt to Berkeley
from the start," she said. "It hurts me because
I want to stay here."
Leßoux said she told the FAO she might
have to transfer unless she received more
financial aid. She said the FAO responded,
"something to the effect that 'Berkeley's a
good school.'" According to Leßoux, the
FAO does not want news of intent to transfer
to influence theirdecisions. "They don't like
that because it'sthreatening," she said.
Assistant Director Vincent De Anda said
the FAO does not want student intentions to
transfer to influence decisions. "But for
people caught in the middle, we can
generally do something," he said.
Leßoux said she is not happy with the self
help portion of her aid package.
Leßoux said she feels frustrated because
the self-help portion of her aid package
expects her to find a jobpayings4.soan hour
and to work 72 hours a week.
"It's hard to find a job that pays $4.50 an
hourand 12hoursa week isa lottoaskofa
student," she said. "They put unfeasible
expectations on us."
Leßoux said working puts her in a bind.
"Since I work," she said," I can't take such a
heavy course load, but if I don't take a heavy
course load I can'tgraduateearlytosave
money."
The FAO providesanadvisingserviceto
helpstudents understand alternatives they
have in financingtheireducation. "Advisers
deal with situationsthat aren't clearcut," De
Anda said.
Leßoux said she was disappointed in her
advising session. "If they explained things
and were more personal it would help,"she
said.
In her frustration with the financial aids
process, Leßoux said she did not want to
blame the FAO entirely for her difficulties.
"I'm angry and upset," she said, "but I don't
want to direct my anger at them. It's just
unfortunate that it isthis way."
