## Editorial Pub Board needs autonomy 
### 
Recent ASSU Senate changes in the
Publications Board by-lawsspringfrom an
apparently sincere desire toensure responsible
use of fee assessment funds, but many of the
changes increase the possibilities of arbitrary
interference with publications'funding and of
manipulation of editorial policy.
Under the revisions passed by the senate last
week, pub board allocation proposals will be
brought before the senate, which then hasthe
opportunity to redistribute funds as it wishes.
Further, the senate can remove any
organization from the publications board if it
finds evidence of "unethical business conduct."
Although the senate holdsthe power to
regulate the pub board, it has until now wisely
left the board with a broad degree of autonomy.
The publicationson the board resolve theirown
disputes and have a vested interest in ensuring
their scarce funds are used efficiently.
Despite the contentions of senators to the
contrary, publications cannot be treated as just
another arm of the ASSU. Unlike any other
ASSU assessment, pub board funding brings
with it the possibility of editorial control,
arbitrary aesthetic judgments and political
manipulation. The power of line-by-line
allocations should be leftwitha body sensitive
to the need for editorial freedoms — such as the
pub board — rather than with a political body —
such as thesenate.
There is no reason toconclude that the
current senate is proceeding with anything but
the best intentions, but the changes make it
much easier for future senates to exercise
editorial control over small publications by
witholding funds. Although the Daily receives
no pub board funding, we know that the
possibility for coercion is vast in funding
decisions — or even with the threat of funding
changes. It is now too easy for any senator to
make specific allocation changes to strike
against any publication whose editorial content,
presentation or membershipoffendsorannoys
that politician.
Similarly, changes permitting senate removal

of a pub board member for "unethical business
conduct" allows too great a possibility of
editorial control. Almost any publication action
including choice or style of story, has financial
implications; in its search for board
accountability, the senate needs to narrow the
grounds for expulsion from the pub board if it
retains that right at all.
Although the pub board ideally would be
independent of the ASSU (thus removing the
possibility of senateeditorial control), its being
part of the ASSU does does justify senate
oversight of itsactivities. The senate's actions to
make ASSU organizations accountable for their
activities and for theirassessment spending are
often needed, and that responsibilitv doe* lie
with the senate. However, especially with the
pub board, groups should be held ultimately
accountable to the senate without fearing
excessive senate interference in details of their
operations.
To ensure this pub board accountability the
senate should be able to veto the pub board
allocation proposal — but only as a blanket veto
exercised within clearlv defined guidelines
preventing gross mismanagement bv the pub
board. Removing item-bv-item adjustment
power from the senate while allowing the bodv
to reject the entire proposal under clearlv
defined conditions would balance fairlv
accountability against editorial freedom.
Provisions for limiting the discretionary fund
to 10 percent of the total assessment and. for
allowing the allocation of pub board funds only
after senate action are reasonable limitations as
long as protections against editorial coercion
are maintained.
We urge the senate to revoke the by-laws
changes that threaten arbitrary intervention in
editorial decisions or, at worst, manipulation of
publications receiving money from the pub
board. If they fail to enact such changes, we urge
senators to remember that inherent conflias of
interest exist when politiciansfund publications
and to grant the pub board the greatest degree
of autonomy possible.
