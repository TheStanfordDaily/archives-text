## 'New freedom': social cancer 
### 
Patrick Henry's historic cry "Give
me liberty or give me death" has
moved the hearts of grade school his
tory students since the printing of the
first textbook. As adults, we know
that no redcoats lie in wait to ambush
our freedom and our options don't
appear quite as harsh as Henry's. But
a new adversary, looking very much
like Liberty herself, threatens to de
stroy freedom from within with a
cancer that has already begun to
sicken society.
The new definition made its public
debut years ago on jean patches and
bumper stickers. It simply en
couraged "Do your own thing." Lat
er this gave way to the arnmendment
"If it feels good, do it."
Though playfully echoed on
animal posters, the two phrases have
become serious additions to the
American definition of "freedom."
But in these new definitions, one im
portant element seems to be missing
— responsibility.
Someone once said, "No one can
enjoy freedom unless he is willing to
surrender some part of it." An aware
ness of the rights of others and the ef
fects of our own actions are the van
guards for freedom. Take away re
sponsibility from liberty and we will
drift into license.
Sociologists bicker as to what
degree we are products of a "Me"
generation. Yet few would doubt
that in the past 15 years America has
experienced a value shift that has
"freed" Americans to exercise their
ambitions and pleasures with less re
gard for authority and repercussions.
One year ago, Time magazine's
special edition "American Renewal"
observed, "the past 15 years were
centrifugal, no moral center of grav
ity exerted a restraining force so that
almost any social behaviour short of a
display of necrophilia in public parks
could lay claim to legitmacy."
I would agree with the sociologists
who maintain that America's tradi
tional values, responsibility toward
one another and ethically upright
standards in work and relationships,
have not died. On the contrary, I sus
pect they are immortal. Yet the ques
tioning of traditional valuesand mor
als has encouraged many Americans
to experiment with new moral stan
dards. Apparently, they have ac
cepted the challenge.
As Americans observe one another
bending the rules of everyday life,
they become more convinced that
"everybody's doing it." It is a weak
justification widely claimed in a soci
ety where all our struggling is to stay
on top of the pile. A rush for our own
rights has resulted in an avid search
for legal loopholes and a general un
awareness of the needs of others.
Law books have bulged with the
expanding task of defining what peo
ple can and can't do. Laws them
selves have been forced to take re
sponsibility for the preservation of
women's rights, the cessation of child
abuse, and the protection of human
life.
Closer to home, increased em

phasis on material success has placed
students on a pursuit of happiness
that often results in tunnel vision.
Occupied by our own goals, we to
lerate no interruptions, we have little
flexibility in our relationships, and
we become insensitive to those
around us who may be suffering from
defeat and depression.
This attitude also causes some to
break ethical standards in their
schoolwork and in their jobs, with lit
tle thought of the consequences suf
fered by others. Psychology Today
concluded "Given the amount of
rule breaking our survey documents,
it would seem unwise to place too
much faith in an honor system."
From the same survey results, Psy
chology Today reported that Ameri
cans as a whole are "increasingly per
missive" sexually, with many Ameri
cans "severely troubled" by the
changing standards. Indeed, the
questioning of traditional taboos
have encouraged sexual experimen
tation which has resulted in bizarre
forms of sexual behaviour.
It is inconceivable to think that in
creased emphasis on sexual per
missiveness does not have some rela
tion to the increase of sex-related
crimes that society, and especially
Stanford, has so acutely witnessed.

Responsibility as it is needed in to
day's society cannot be legalized.
Laws and political pressure groups,
though possibly able to hinder the
abuses, cannot change people's
hearts.
The Apostle Paul, though speaking
to Christians, suggested a principle
that could apply well to the present
dilemma of false freedom in society.
He said, "Do not use your freedom as
an opportunity for the flesh (self
ishness) but through love serve one
another." This call to freedom re
quires a regard for others' rights and
needs which does not depend on
their attitudes of actions. It is an un
conditional desire to serve others.
The problem will not go away. Rus
sian author Fyodor Dostoevsky said
"Man commits sin just to remind
himself he is free." History has
proven that the abuse of freedom in
one generation will become the
norm in the next generation. The cy
cle continues until degeneration de
mands reform or ends in destruction.
If we individually continue to pursue
our own myopic sense of freedom,
then collectively we will crush our
liberty.

degree we are products of a "Me"
generation. Yet few would doubt
that in the past 15 years America has
experienced a value shift that has
"freed" Americans to exercise their
ambitions and pleasures with less re
gard for authority and repercussions.
One year ago, Time magazine's
special edition "American Renewal"
observed, "the past 15 years were
centrifugal, no moral center of grav
ity exerted a restraining force so that
almost any social behaviour short of a
display of necrophilia in public parks
could lay claim to legitmacy."
I would agree with the sociologists
who maintain that America's tradi
tional values, responsibility toward
one another and ethically upright
standards in work and relationships,
have not died. On the contrary, I sus
pect they are immortal. Yet the ques
tioning of traditional valuesand mor
als has encouraged many Americans
to experiment with new moral stan
dards. Apparently, they have ac
cepted the challenge.
As Americans observe one another
bending the rules of everyday life,
they become more convinced that
"everybody's doing it." It is a weak
justification widely claimed in a soci
ety where all our struggling is to stay
on top of the pile. A rush for our own
rights has resulted in an avid search
for legal loopholes and a general un
awareness of the needs of others.
Law books have bulged with the
expanding task of defining what peo
ple can and can't do. Laws them
selves have been forced to take re
sponsibility for the preservation of
women's rights, the cessation of child
abuse, and the protection of human
life.
Closer to home, increased em

phasis on material success has placed
students on a pursuit of happiness
that often results in tunnel vision.
Occupied by our own goals, we to
lerate no interruptions, we have little
flexibility in our relationships, and
we become insensitive to those
around us who may be suffering from
defeat and depression.
This attitude also causes some to
break ethical standards in their
schoolwork and in their jobs, with lit
tle thought of the consequences suf
fered by others. Psychology Today
concluded "Given the amount of
rule breaking our survey documents,
it would seem unwise to place too
much faith in an honor system."
From the same survey results, Psy
chology Today reported that Ameri
cans as a whole are "increasingly per
missive" sexually, with many Ameri
cans "severely troubled" by the
changing standards. Indeed, the
questioning of traditional taboos
have encouraged sexual experimen
tation which has resulted in bizarre
forms of sexual behaviour.
It is inconceivable to think that in
creased emphasis on sexual per
missiveness does not have some rela
tion to the increase of sex-related
crimes that society, and especially
Stanford, has so acutely witnessed.

Responsibility as it is needed in to
day's society cannot be legalized.
Laws and political pressure groups,
though possibly able to hinder the
abuses, cannot change people's
hearts.
The Apostle Paul, though speaking
to Christians, suggested a principle
that could apply well to the present
dilemma of false freedom in society.
He said, "Do not use your freedom as
an opportunity for the flesh (self
ishness) but through love serve one
another." This call to freedom re
quires a regard for others' rights and
needs which does not depend on
their attitudes of actions. It is an un
conditional desire to serve others.
The problem will not go away. Rus
sian author Fyodor Dostoevsky said
"Man commits sin just to remind
himself he is free." History has
proven that the abuse of freedom in
one generation will become the
norm in the next generation. The cy
cle continues until degeneration de
mands reform or ends in destruction.
If we individually continue to pursue
our own myopic sense of freedom,
then collectively we will crush our
liberty.

Patrick Henry's historic cry "Give
me liberty or give me death" has
moved the hearts of grade school his
tory students since the printing of the
first textbook. As adults, we know
that no redcoats lie in wait to ambush
our freedom and our options don't
appear quite as harsh as Henry's. But
a new adversary, looking very much
like Liberty herself, threatens to de
stroy freedom from within with a
cancer that has already begun to
sicken society.
The new definition made its public
debut years ago on jean patches and
bumper stickers. It simply en
couraged "Do your own thing." Lat
er this gave way to the arnmendment
"If it feels good, do it."
Though playfully echoed on
animal posters, the two phrases have
become serious additions to the
American definition of "freedom."
But in these new definitions, one im
portant element seems to be missing
— responsibility.
Someone once said, "No one can
enjoy freedom unless he is willing to
surrender some part of it." An aware
ness of the rights of others and the ef
fects of our own actions are the van
guards for freedom. Take away re
sponsibility from liberty and we will
drift into license.
