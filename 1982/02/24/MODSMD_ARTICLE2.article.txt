Governors ponder federalism
Washington — The nation's governors yesterday formally agreed to
begin negotiations with President Ronald Reagan on a bipartisan plan
for sorting out federal and state responsibilities.
They acted unanimously after Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.), describing this as a "now-or-never" opportunity, pledged
Senate hearings this spring on the federalism issue and said he would try
for a floor vote before adjournment.
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) however, describing
the sorting-out proposal as "part of the overall retrenchment on social
policy" of the Reagan administration, told the governors there would
be "hard scrutiny" of the idea in House hearings.
But under prodding from some Democratic governors who advocate
the sorting-out process, O'Neill promised that the House "will not take
federalism and put it under the table." He even suggested that the con
gressional Democrats might try to draft an alternative of their own.
Thus, the three days of the midwinter governors' meeting produced
what Reagan operatives had hoped to obtain: an agreement to nego
tiate the substantial differences between the original Reagan plan and
the governors' traditional position, in an atmosphere where partisan
differences do not foredoom the product to automatic defeat in Con
gress.
Reagan has proposed that the federal government take over the fed
eral-state Medicaid program while the states pick up food stamps, now
all federal, and the state-federal program of Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Predictably, the governors like the first half of this but
have asked Reagan to set aside the second. Their traditional position has
been that the federal government should take over all support pro
grams for the poor.
The White House has promised extensive consultations with mayors,
state legislators and county officials before sending legislation to Con
gress but the administration has not yet made any arrangements with
those groups for doing so.
"We understand that it's an open process that they are talking about,"
said Mike Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, whose
big city mayor members have been among the most vocal opponents to
federalism. "I guess feelings would be hurt if we couldn't be a part of
that process."
The final session of the governors' meeting was full of re
minders of the partisan and policy differences that threaten
the federalism initiative and still might sink it in the tricky
process ahead.
Democratic governors, at a party caucus preceding the
formal session, submerged their endorsement of the in
itiative in a statement lambasting the Reagan budget and ec
onomic policy and warning that "the promises of federalism
will ring hollow" unless the economy is cured.
Baker gave it a push forward by pleading that it not be
come "a political football" and promising to seek a Senate
vote this year.
But then O'Neill, after calling Reaganomics a "blueprint
for disaster," began throwing cold water on the federalism
initiative. He said he could "very easily" agree to returning
about 17 of the 43 programs Reagan suggested sending back
to the states — mainly in the education and transportation
fields.
But he questioned whether any income-support programs
should be included in the swap and asked "if a time of re
cession is a good time" even to be discussing such a switch.
Bombs explode in Beirut market
Beirut — Two huge bombs exploded within minutes of
each other in one of the city's main market areas yesterday
killing and wounding dozens of people who were doing
their noon-hour shopping.
The first of the blasts exploded at about 12:20 p.m. and the
second followed four minutes later, just as a crowd was
gathering to watch the beginning of frantic rescue opera
tions. The second bomb was so powerful that it transformed
25 cars into twisted pieces of metal, blew up two gas stations,
and ignited a fire that was still out of control two hours later.
All windows in a 16-story building directly across the street
were blown out and residents there staggered to the ground
floor, searching for medical help.
In the confusion, there was no official estimate of those
killed in the explosion. Figures ranged from seven to 70. The
explosion was the worst in Beirut since last October, when a
car bomb detonated in a Palestinian section of the city killed
more than 70 people.
Last year, more than 200 people were killed in 18car bomb
ings throughout Beirut, with various causes and groups
claiming responsibility for them.
A short time after yesterday's explosion, a group calling
itself the "Holy War Front" took responsibility for the double
bombing, saying it was in retaliation for the deaths of inno
cent families in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. An
other group known as the Front for the Liberation of Leba
non from Foreigners also claimed responsibility.
For the past week, Tripoli has been the scene of heavy
fighting between Syrian peace-keeping forces and members
of Palestinian and other leftist groups. Eighteen people were
reported killed in that fighting, which is seen by some ob
servers here as an extension of the sectarian fighting now
going on in Syria.
An hour after yesterday's Beirut explosion, the cordoned
off area was still a scene of panic as ambulances raced in to
carry out the dead and wounded. Firemen poured water on
the red-hot tin roofs in an attempt to keep the fire from
spreading.
Wreckers, working in the thick, black smoke, picked up
the burned-out shells of cars and dropped them in a pile on
the other side of the street. Men with megaphones pleaded
with civilians to leave the area because of the possibility of
another explosion.
Reagan to promise trade benefits
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's speech to the
Organization of American States today will propose new
trade benefits and offer the modest sum of about $300 mil
lion in economic assistance to the countries of the Caribbean
basin.
For diplomatic and other reasons, however, the long-de
layed speech will soft-pedal the administration's rising ap
prehension over the increased military threat posed by
Cuba.
Concerned both by Cuba's role in helping topple estab
lished governments in the region, and by development of
bases in Cuba and neighboring Grenada that could be used
by the Soviet Union for thrusts against vital allied shipping
lanes, the United States and its NATO allies will conduct ma
jor air and naval exercises in the Caribbean next month.
But the difficulty of winning regional support for the ad
ministration's view of problems in the Caribbean was under
scored yesterday by a State Department announcement dis
missing Mexico's offer to mediate between the United States
and Nicaragua, another Caribbean trouble spot.
The statement, read by spokesman Dean Fischer but bear
ing the sanction of Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
brushed aside President Jose Lopez Portillo's proposed
strategy for reducing tension between the two countries on
grounds that Nicaragua must first stop supporting insurgents

in El Salvador.
Other elements of Lopez Portillo's proposal — offered
Sunday in the course of a speech in the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua, and heralded as a major initiative — are still under
study, Fischer said. These include a suggested dialogue be
tween Washington and Havana through Mexican in
termediaries and a negotiated end to the civil war in El
Salvador.
Reagan has made a special effort to improve U.S.-Mexican
relations through personal contacts with Lopez Portillo. But
the perfunctory tone of the State Department's reaction to
the Mexican president's personal initiative seemed likely to
undermine that effort. And Mexico has never shown much
enthusiasm for Reagan's anti-Cuba and anti-Nicaragua poli
cies.
Partially out of deference to Mexico's view of the Carib
bean situation, Reagan's OAS speech is expected to concen
trate on economic aid and expanded trade proposals — on
which the United States had conferred with Mexico, Canda
and Venezuela. But the text may still contain some tough
rhetoric aimed at Cuba and Nicaragua.
Haig is understood to have pushed hard for language in
the text reflecting the view that an economic program aimed
at "alleviating social unrest" in the region should also be pre
sented as a program aimed at thwarting Cuban allies in the
region.
U.S. warship monitors El Salvador
Washington — The United States is keeping a destroyer
equipped with sophisticated electronic gear off the coast of
El Salvador to listen in on radio communications, Pentagon
sources said yesterday.
Defense officials who asked not to be identified waved
aside suggestions that the warship was meant to be a show of
force. A single destroyer does not pack enough combat
power for that, they said.
Although intelligence-gathering methods are closely
guarded, it is known that the destroyers of the Spruance class
are fitted with the most advanced equipment for what is
called communications intelligence. The Deo, on station in
the Pacific off El Salvador since some time in January, and the
Caron, which recently relieved it, are both of the Spruance
class.
It could not be determined whose radio traffic was being
intercepted. But the ship would be in a position to overhear
communications among guerrilla units in El Salvador and be
tween those units and supporters in neighboring Nicaragua.
The sources said the relief of the Deo indicated the in
telligence mission would continue indefinitely.
Committee proposes budget plan
Washington — The chairman of the Senate Budget Com
mittee proposed the most comprehensive alternative to date
for President Ronald Reagan's embattled budget yesterday
and predicted that his plan will win bipartisan support in
Congress.
The chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), rejecting the
president's deficit-laden plan, proposed a compromise
budget with bigger tax increases, less defense spending and
lower deficits than Reagan envisioned.
His action, backed up by criticism of the administration's
budget proposal by Republican senators who usually sup
port the president, was the strongest indication so far that
Reagan's spending plan will undergo major revision in Con
gress.
Domenici said that the deficit in Reagan's budget "threat
ens to crush any hope of economic recovery," adding that a
stalemate between the White House and Congress "could
push us to the brink not only of a serious and prolonged re
cession in America, but of a dangerous economic slowdown
throughout the industrialized world."
Domenici said his plan would reduce projected federal
deficits by $320 billion over the next three years, partly by
halting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits
and other federal programs.
Other highlights of the plan:
•Defense. Reduce the president's spending requests by
imposing a limit of 5 percent, after adjustment for inflation,
on annual increases for the Pentagon, saving from $20 billion
to $25 billion over three years.
•Taxes. A series of unspecified changes that would raise
$18 billion in fiscal year 1983, another $49 billion in fiscal 1984
and $55 billion in fiscal 1985.
•Federal pay. A freeze would be imposed on government
salaries in fiscal year 1983, with a 5 percent increase in 1984
and 1985, saving $25 billion.
•Domestic spending. Freeze most non-defense domestic
programs at current levels of spending for three years, saving
$34 billion.
•Medicare. Limit increases in Medicare and Medicaid pro
grams to the rise in the Consumer Price Index, saving $22
billion over three years.
The president stood firm behind his budget, however, and
was quoted by presidential spokesman David Gergen as tell

ing Republican congressional leaders at the White House
yesterday that he was as unhappy about the deficits as they
were.
Impact of Poland sanctions minor
London — America's allies have moved only hesitantly
toward joining the United States in sanctions against the So
viet Union and Poland because of the imposition of martial
law in Poland.
The impact of most of the actions appears minor, although
together they represent growing displeasure at the Polish
clampdown Dec. 13. In addition, a major deal with the Sovi
ets to pipe gas to Western Europe apparently is going ahead
with the participation of West Germany, France and Japan
despite U.S. opposition.
In mid-January, the NATO allies announced that further
credits for goods other than food for Poland would be
placed in abeyance, and negotiations on 1982 payments on
Polish debts would be suspended.
Yesterday, the Common Market agreed to limit imports of
certain goods from the Soviet Union to apply pressure for a
relaxation of martial law in Poland. The decision affects a
small but still undetermined percentage of the $11 billion
worth of goods the countries import annually from the Sovi
et Union.
Common Market officials said the action would involve
lowering quotas or raising tariffs on manufactured and lux
ury goods purchased from the Soviet Union. Most likely to
be hit would be caviar, diamonds, furs and alcoholic
beverages.
But an overwhelming amount of Common Market imports
are energy products and raw materials, which would not be
affected.
Castro endorses Mexico's peace plan
Mexico City — Fidel Castro has endorsed a Mexican peace
plan for Central America that calls for talks between Cuba
and the United States. But he set a condition — that the Rea
gan administration stop what he called "continuous threats"
against its neighbors.
The Cuban president, in a letter to Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo, also said he was "ready to offer the fullest
guarantees" that weapons in Cuba will not be used for ag
gression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.
He did not elaborate on what was meant by "guarantees."
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina made the letter
public here yesterday. Castro was responding to a three-part
peace initiative outlined Sunday by Lopez Portillo in Mana
gua, Nicaragua. It called for a negotiated settlement of El
Salvador's civil war, a non-aggression pact between the Unit
ed States and Nicaragua, and U.S.-Cuban talks to cool mutual
hostility.
Although Castro did not refer directly to what Lopez
Portillo has called the "real possibility" of U.S.-Cuban talks,
Castro offered to participate in the peace plan if the United
States"promises not to assault its neighbors, if it stops its con
tinuous threats, if it stops using its arms and money to sup
port genocidal regimes, if it stops its subversive activities."
The Reagan administration has accused Castro of building
up Cuba's aggressive military might.
Washington has also given El Salvador's junta $90 million in
military aid to fight guerrillas that President Ronald Reagan
says are armed with weapons sent from Cuba through leftist
ruled Nicaragua.
Nicaragua and Cuba deny an arms flow. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig has repeatedly hinted at U.S. military action
to stop it.
The leader of Nicaragua's leftist junta, Daniel Ortega, has
also endorsed Lopez Portillo's proposed non-aggression
pact. It calls on Nicaragua to reduce a military buildup pro
vided Washington ends threats of military action and disarms
Nicaraguan exiles in the United States it says are training to
retake their homeland.
Stock market has a mixed day
New York — The stock market was mixed in what analysts
termed a trendless session yesterday after falling to a 21-
month low on Monday.
Investors failed to decisively respond to either the first re
duction in the prime lending rate since Dec. 1, or a govern
ment report indicating continued economic weakness.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled
13.04 points Monday, rose 1.72 to close at 812.98.
Banks nationwide reduced their prime lending rate to 16.5
percent from 17 percent, but interest rates stabilized in the
credit markets after falling sharply the three previous ses
sions.
Gold was $361 per ounce in New York yeterday.
Today's weather
Fair, with northwesterly winds. Highs in the upper 50sto
mid 60s, lows in the upper 30s to 40s.

federalism. "I guess feelings would be hurt if we couldn't be a part of
that process."
The final session of the governors' meeting was full of re
minders of the partisan and policy differences that threaten
the federalism initiative and still might sink it in the tricky
process ahead.
Democratic governors, at a party caucus preceding the
formal session, submerged their endorsement of the in
itiative in a statement lambasting the Reagan budget and ec
onomic policy and warning that "the promises of federalism
will ring hollow" unless the economy is cured.
Baker gave it a push forward by pleading that it not be
come "a political football" and promising to seek a Senate
vote this year.
But then O'Neill, after calling Reaganomics a "blueprint
for disaster," began throwing cold water on the federalism
initiative. He said he could "very easily" agree to returning
about 17 of the 43 programs Reagan suggested sending back
to the states — mainly in the education and transportation
fields.
But he questioned whether any income-support programs
should be included in the swap and asked "if a time of re
cession is a good time" even to be discussing such a switch.
Bombs explode in Beirut market
Beirut — Two huge bombs exploded within minutes of
each other in one of the city's main market areas yesterday
killing and wounding dozens of people who were doing
their noon-hour shopping.
The first of the blasts exploded at about 12:20 p.m. and the
second followed four minutes later, just as a crowd was
gathering to watch the beginning of frantic rescue opera
tions. The second bomb was so powerful that it transformed
25 cars into twisted pieces of metal, blew up two gas stations,
and ignited a fire that was still out of control two hours later.
All windows in a 16-story building directly across the street
were blown out and residents there staggered to the ground
floor, searching for medical help.
In the confusion, there was no official estimate of those
killed in the explosion. Figures ranged from seven to 70. The
explosion was the worst in Beirut since last October, when a
car bomb detonated in a Palestinian section of the city killed
more than 70 people.
Last year, more than 200 people were killed in 18car bomb
ings throughout Beirut, with various causes and groups
claiming responsibility for them.
A short time after yesterday's explosion, a group calling
itself the "Holy War Front" took responsibility for the double
bombing, saying it was in retaliation for the deaths of inno
cent families in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. An
other group known as the Front for the Liberation of Leba
non from Foreigners also claimed responsibility.
For the past week, Tripoli has been the scene of heavy
fighting between Syrian peace-keeping forces and members
of Palestinian and other leftist groups. Eighteen people were
reported killed in that fighting, which is seen by some ob
servers here as an extension of the sectarian fighting now
going on in Syria.
An hour after yesterday's Beirut explosion, the cordoned
off area was still a scene of panic as ambulances raced in to
carry out the dead and wounded. Firemen poured water on
the red-hot tin roofs in an attempt to keep the fire from
spreading.
Wreckers, working in the thick, black smoke, picked up
the burned-out shells of cars and dropped them in a pile on
the other side of the street. Men with megaphones pleaded
with civilians to leave the area because of the possibility of
another explosion.
Reagan to promise trade benefits
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's speech to the
Organization of American States today will propose new
trade benefits and offer the modest sum of about $300 mil
lion in economic assistance to the countries of the Caribbean
basin.
For diplomatic and other reasons, however, the long-de
layed speech will soft-pedal the administration's rising ap
prehension over the increased military threat posed by
Cuba.
Concerned both by Cuba's role in helping topple estab
lished governments in the region, and by development of
bases in Cuba and neighboring Grenada that could be used
by the Soviet Union for thrusts against vital allied shipping
lanes, the United States and its NATO allies will conduct ma
jor air and naval exercises in the Caribbean next month.
But the difficulty of winning regional support for the ad
ministration's view of problems in the Caribbean was under
scored yesterday by a State Department announcement dis
missing Mexico's offer to mediate between the United States
and Nicaragua, another Caribbean trouble spot.
The statement, read by spokesman Dean Fischer but bear
ing the sanction of Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
brushed aside President Jose Lopez Portillo's proposed
strategy for reducing tension between the two countries on
grounds that Nicaragua must first stop supporting insurgents

in El Salvador.
Other elements of Lopez Portillo's proposal — offered
Sunday in the course of a speech in the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua, and heralded as a major initiative — are still under
study, Fischer said. These include a suggested dialogue be
tween Washington and Havana through Mexican in
termediaries and a negotiated end to the civil war in El
Salvador.
Reagan has made a special effort to improve U.S.-Mexican
relations through personal contacts with Lopez Portillo. But
the perfunctory tone of the State Department's reaction to
the Mexican president's personal initiative seemed likely to
undermine that effort. And Mexico has never shown much
enthusiasm for Reagan's anti-Cuba and anti-Nicaragua poli
cies.
Partially out of deference to Mexico's view of the Carib
bean situation, Reagan's OAS speech is expected to concen
trate on economic aid and expanded trade proposals — on
which the United States had conferred with Mexico, Canda
and Venezuela. But the text may still contain some tough
rhetoric aimed at Cuba and Nicaragua.
Haig is understood to have pushed hard for language in
the text reflecting the view that an economic program aimed
at "alleviating social unrest" in the region should also be pre
sented as a program aimed at thwarting Cuban allies in the
region.
U.S. warship monitors El Salvador
Washington — The United States is keeping a destroyer
equipped with sophisticated electronic gear off the coast of
El Salvador to listen in on radio communications, Pentagon
sources said yesterday.
Defense officials who asked not to be identified waved
aside suggestions that the warship was meant to be a show of
force. A single destroyer does not pack enough combat
power for that, they said.
Although intelligence-gathering methods are closely
guarded, it is known that the destroyers of the Spruance class
are fitted with the most advanced equipment for what is
called communications intelligence. The Deo, on station in
the Pacific off El Salvador since some time in January, and the
Caron, which recently relieved it, are both of the Spruance
class.
It could not be determined whose radio traffic was being
intercepted. But the ship would be in a position to overhear
communications among guerrilla units in El Salvador and be
tween those units and supporters in neighboring Nicaragua.
The sources said the relief of the Deo indicated the in
telligence mission would continue indefinitely.
Committee proposes budget plan
Washington — The chairman of the Senate Budget Com
mittee proposed the most comprehensive alternative to date
for President Ronald Reagan's embattled budget yesterday
and predicted that his plan will win bipartisan support in
Congress.
The chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), rejecting the
president's deficit-laden plan, proposed a compromise
budget with bigger tax increases, less defense spending and
lower deficits than Reagan envisioned.
His action, backed up by criticism of the administration's
budget proposal by Republican senators who usually sup
port the president, was the strongest indication so far that
Reagan's spending plan will undergo major revision in Con
gress.
Domenici said that the deficit in Reagan's budget "threat
ens to crush any hope of economic recovery," adding that a
stalemate between the White House and Congress "could
push us to the brink not only of a serious and prolonged re
cession in America, but of a dangerous economic slowdown
throughout the industrialized world."
Domenici said his plan would reduce projected federal
deficits by $320 billion over the next three years, partly by
halting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits
and other federal programs.
Other highlights of the plan:
•Defense. Reduce the president's spending requests by
imposing a limit of 5 percent, after adjustment for inflation,
on annual increases for the Pentagon, saving from $20 billion
to $25 billion over three years.
•Taxes. A series of unspecified changes that would raise
$18 billion in fiscal year 1983, another $49 billion in fiscal 1984
and $55 billion in fiscal 1985.
•Federal pay. A freeze would be imposed on government
salaries in fiscal year 1983, with a 5 percent increase in 1984
and 1985, saving $25 billion.
•Domestic spending. Freeze most non-defense domestic
programs at current levels of spending for three years, saving
$34 billion.
•Medicare. Limit increases in Medicare and Medicaid pro
grams to the rise in the Consumer Price Index, saving $22
billion over three years.
The president stood firm behind his budget, however, and
was quoted by presidential spokesman David Gergen as tell

ing Republican congressional leaders at the White House
yesterday that he was as unhappy about the deficits as they
were.
Impact of Poland sanctions minor
London — America's allies have moved only hesitantly
toward joining the United States in sanctions against the So
viet Union and Poland because of the imposition of martial
law in Poland.
The impact of most of the actions appears minor, although
together they represent growing displeasure at the Polish
clampdown Dec. 13. In addition, a major deal with the Sovi
ets to pipe gas to Western Europe apparently is going ahead
with the participation of West Germany, France and Japan
despite U.S. opposition.
In mid-January, the NATO allies announced that further
credits for goods other than food for Poland would be
placed in abeyance, and negotiations on 1982 payments on
Polish debts would be suspended.
Yesterday, the Common Market agreed to limit imports of
certain goods from the Soviet Union to apply pressure for a
relaxation of martial law in Poland. The decision affects a
small but still undetermined percentage of the $11 billion
worth of goods the countries import annually from the Sovi
et Union.
Common Market officials said the action would involve
lowering quotas or raising tariffs on manufactured and lux
ury goods purchased from the Soviet Union. Most likely to
be hit would be caviar, diamonds, furs and alcoholic
beverages.
But an overwhelming amount of Common Market imports
are energy products and raw materials, which would not be
affected.
Castro endorses Mexico's peace plan
Mexico City — Fidel Castro has endorsed a Mexican peace
plan for Central America that calls for talks between Cuba
and the United States. But he set a condition — that the Rea
gan administration stop what he called "continuous threats"
against its neighbors.
The Cuban president, in a letter to Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo, also said he was "ready to offer the fullest
guarantees" that weapons in Cuba will not be used for ag
gression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.
He did not elaborate on what was meant by "guarantees."
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina made the letter
public here yesterday. Castro was responding to a three-part
peace initiative outlined Sunday by Lopez Portillo in Mana
gua, Nicaragua. It called for a negotiated settlement of El
Salvador's civil war, a non-aggression pact between the Unit
ed States and Nicaragua, and U.S.-Cuban talks to cool mutual
hostility.
Although Castro did not refer directly to what Lopez
Portillo has called the "real possibility" of U.S.-Cuban talks,
Castro offered to participate in the peace plan if the United
States"promises not to assault its neighbors, if it stops its con
tinuous threats, if it stops using its arms and money to sup
port genocidal regimes, if it stops its subversive activities."
The Reagan administration has accused Castro of building
up Cuba's aggressive military might.
Washington has also given El Salvador's junta $90 million in
military aid to fight guerrillas that President Ronald Reagan
says are armed with weapons sent from Cuba through leftist
ruled Nicaragua.
Nicaragua and Cuba deny an arms flow. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig has repeatedly hinted at U.S. military action
to stop it.
The leader of Nicaragua's leftist junta, Daniel Ortega, has
also endorsed Lopez Portillo's proposed non-aggression
pact. It calls on Nicaragua to reduce a military buildup pro
vided Washington ends threats of military action and disarms
Nicaraguan exiles in the United States it says are training to
retake their homeland.
Stock market has a mixed day
New York — The stock market was mixed in what analysts
termed a trendless session yesterday after falling to a 21-
month low on Monday.
Investors failed to decisively respond to either the first re
duction in the prime lending rate since Dec. 1, or a govern
ment report indicating continued economic weakness.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled
13.04 points Monday, rose 1.72 to close at 812.98.
Banks nationwide reduced their prime lending rate to 16.5
percent from 17 percent, but interest rates stabilized in the
credit markets after falling sharply the three previous ses
sions.
Gold was $361 per ounce in New York yeterday.
Today's weather
Fair, with northwesterly winds. Highs in the upper 50sto
mid 60s, lows in the upper 30s to 40s.
Governors ponder federalism
Washington — The nation's governors yesterday formally agreed to
begin negotiations with President Ronald Reagan on a bipartisan plan
for sorting out federal and state responsibilities.
They acted unanimously after Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.), describing this as a "now-or-never" opportunity, pledged
Senate hearings this spring on the federalism issue and said he would try
for a floor vote before adjournment.
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) however, describing
the sorting-out proposal as "part of the overall retrenchment on social
policy" of the Reagan administration, told the governors there would
be "hard scrutiny" of the idea in House hearings.
But under prodding from some Democratic governors who advocate
the sorting-out process, O'Neill promised that the House "will not take
federalism and put it under the table." He even suggested that the con
gressional Democrats might try to draft an alternative of their own.
Thus, the three days of the midwinter governors' meeting produced
what Reagan operatives had hoped to obtain: an agreement to nego
tiate the substantial differences between the original Reagan plan and
the governors' traditional position, in an atmosphere where partisan
differences do not foredoom the product to automatic defeat in Con
gress.
Reagan has proposed that the federal government take over the fed
eral-state Medicaid program while the states pick up food stamps, now
all federal, and the state-federal program of Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Predictably, the governors like the first half of this but
have asked Reagan to set aside the second. Their traditional position has
been that the federal government should take over all support pro
grams for the poor.
The White House has promised extensive consultations with mayors,
state legislators and county officials before sending legislation to Con
gress but the administration has not yet made any arrangements with
those groups for doing so.
"We understand that it's an open process that they are talking about,"
said Mike Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, whose
big city mayor members have been among the most vocal opponents to
federalism. "I guess feelings would be hurt if we couldn't be a part of

killed in the explosion. Figures ranged from seven to 70. The
explosion was the worst in Beirut since last October, when a
car bomb detonated in a Palestinian section of the city killed
more than 70 people.
Last year, more than 200 people were killed in 18car bomb
ings throughout Beirut, with various causes and groups
claiming responsibility for them.
A short time after yesterday's explosion, a group calling
itself the "Holy War Front" took responsibility for the double
bombing, saying it was in retaliation for the deaths of inno
cent families in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. An
other group known as the Front for the Liberation of Leba
non from Foreigners also claimed responsibility.
For the past week, Tripoli has been the scene of heavy
fighting between Syrian peace-keeping forces and members
of Palestinian and other leftist groups. Eighteen people were
reported killed in that fighting, which is seen by some ob
servers here as an extension of the sectarian fighting now
going on in Syria.
An hour after yesterday's Beirut explosion, the cordoned
off area was still a scene of panic as ambulances raced in to
carry out the dead and wounded. Firemen poured water on
the red-hot tin roofs in an attempt to keep the fire from
spreading.
Wreckers, working in the thick, black smoke, picked up
the burned-out shells of cars and dropped them in a pile on
the other side of the street. Men with megaphones pleaded
with civilians to leave the area because of the possibility of
another explosion.
Reagan to promise trade benefits
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's speech to the
Organization of American States today will propose new
trade benefits and offer the modest sum of about $300 mil
lion in economic assistance to the countries of the Caribbean
basin.
For diplomatic and other reasons, however, the long-de
layed speech will soft-pedal the administration's rising ap
prehension over the increased military threat posed by
Cuba.
Concerned both by Cuba's role in helping topple estab
lished governments in the region, and by development of
bases in Cuba and neighboring Grenada that could be used
by the Soviet Union for thrusts against vital allied shipping
lanes, the United States and its NATO allies will conduct ma
jor air and naval exercises in the Caribbean next month.
But the difficulty of winning regional support for the ad
ministration's view of problems in the Caribbean was under
scored yesterday by a State Department announcement dis
missing Mexico's offer to mediate between the United States
and Nicaragua, another Caribbean trouble spot.
The statement, read by spokesman Dean Fischer but bear
ing the sanction of Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
brushed aside President Jose Lopez Portillo's proposed
strategy for reducing tension between the two countries on
grounds that Nicaragua must first stop supporting insurgents

in El Salvador.
Other elements of Lopez Portillo's proposal — offered
Sunday in the course of a speech in the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua, and heralded as a major initiative — are still under
study, Fischer said. These include a suggested dialogue be
tween Washington and Havana through Mexican in
termediaries and a negotiated end to the civil war in El
Salvador.
Reagan has made a special effort to improve U.S.-Mexican
relations through personal contacts with Lopez Portillo. But
the perfunctory tone of the State Department's reaction to
the Mexican president's personal initiative seemed likely to
undermine that effort. And Mexico has never shown much
enthusiasm for Reagan's anti-Cuba and anti-Nicaragua poli
cies.
Partially out of deference to Mexico's view of the Carib
bean situation, Reagan's OAS speech is expected to concen
trate on economic aid and expanded trade proposals — on
which the United States had conferred with Mexico, Canda
and Venezuela. But the text may still contain some tough
rhetoric aimed at Cuba and Nicaragua.
Haig is understood to have pushed hard for language in
the text reflecting the view that an economic program aimed
at "alleviating social unrest" in the region should also be pre
sented as a program aimed at thwarting Cuban allies in the
region.
U.S. warship monitors El Salvador
Washington — The United States is keeping a destroyer
equipped with sophisticated electronic gear off the coast of
El Salvador to listen in on radio communications, Pentagon
sources said yesterday.
Defense officials who asked not to be identified waved
aside suggestions that the warship was meant to be a show of
force. A single destroyer does not pack enough combat
power for that, they said.
Although intelligence-gathering methods are closely
guarded, it is known that the destroyers of the Spruance class
are fitted with the most advanced equipment for what is
called communications intelligence. The Deo, on station in
the Pacific off El Salvador since some time in January, and the
Caron, which recently relieved it, are both of the Spruance
class.
It could not be determined whose radio traffic was being
intercepted. But the ship would be in a position to overhear
communications among guerrilla units in El Salvador and be
tween those units and supporters in neighboring Nicaragua.
The sources said the relief of the Deo indicated the in
telligence mission would continue indefinitely.
Committee proposes budget plan
Washington — The chairman of the Senate Budget Com
mittee proposed the most comprehensive alternative to date
for President Ronald Reagan's embattled budget yesterday
and predicted that his plan will win bipartisan support in
Congress.
The chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), rejecting the
president's deficit-laden plan, proposed a compromise
budget with bigger tax increases, less defense spending and
lower deficits than Reagan envisioned.
His action, backed up by criticism of the administration's
budget proposal by Republican senators who usually sup
port the president, was the strongest indication so far that
Reagan's spending plan will undergo major revision in Con
gress.
Domenici said that the deficit in Reagan's budget "threat
ens to crush any hope of economic recovery," adding that a
stalemate between the White House and Congress "could
push us to the brink not only of a serious and prolonged re
cession in America, but of a dangerous economic slowdown
throughout the industrialized world."
Domenici said his plan would reduce projected federal
deficits by $320 billion over the next three years, partly by
halting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits
and other federal programs.
Other highlights of the plan:
•Defense. Reduce the president's spending requests by
imposing a limit of 5 percent, after adjustment for inflation,
on annual increases for the Pentagon, saving from $20 billion
to $25 billion over three years.
•Taxes. A series of unspecified changes that would raise
$18 billion in fiscal year 1983, another $49 billion in fiscal 1984
and $55 billion in fiscal 1985.
•Federal pay. A freeze would be imposed on government
salaries in fiscal year 1983, with a 5 percent increase in 1984
and 1985, saving $25 billion.
•Domestic spending. Freeze most non-defense domestic
programs at current levels of spending for three years, saving
$34 billion.
•Medicare. Limit increases in Medicare and Medicaid pro
grams to the rise in the Consumer Price Index, saving $22
billion over three years.
The president stood firm behind his budget, however, and
was quoted by presidential spokesman David Gergen as tell

ing Republican congressional leaders at the White House
yesterday that he was as unhappy about the deficits as they
were.
Impact of Poland sanctions minor
London — America's allies have moved only hesitantly
toward joining the United States in sanctions against the So
viet Union and Poland because of the imposition of martial
law in Poland.
The impact of most of the actions appears minor, although
together they represent growing displeasure at the Polish
clampdown Dec. 13. In addition, a major deal with the Sovi
ets to pipe gas to Western Europe apparently is going ahead
with the participation of West Germany, France and Japan
despite U.S. opposition.
In mid-January, the NATO allies announced that further
credits for goods other than food for Poland would be
placed in abeyance, and negotiations on 1982 payments on
Polish debts would be suspended.
Yesterday, the Common Market agreed to limit imports of
certain goods from the Soviet Union to apply pressure for a
relaxation of martial law in Poland. The decision affects a
small but still undetermined percentage of the $11 billion
worth of goods the countries import annually from the Sovi
et Union.
Common Market officials said the action would involve
lowering quotas or raising tariffs on manufactured and lux
ury goods purchased from the Soviet Union. Most likely to
be hit would be caviar, diamonds, furs and alcoholic
beverages.
But an overwhelming amount of Common Market imports
are energy products and raw materials, which would not be
affected.
Castro endorses Mexico's peace plan
Mexico City — Fidel Castro has endorsed a Mexican peace
plan for Central America that calls for talks between Cuba
and the United States. But he set a condition — that the Rea
gan administration stop what he called "continuous threats"
against its neighbors.
The Cuban president, in a letter to Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo, also said he was "ready to offer the fullest
guarantees" that weapons in Cuba will not be used for ag
gression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.
He did not elaborate on what was meant by "guarantees."
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina made the letter
public here yesterday. Castro was responding to a three-part
peace initiative outlined Sunday by Lopez Portillo in Mana
gua, Nicaragua. It called for a negotiated settlement of El
Salvador's civil war, a non-aggression pact between the Unit
ed States and Nicaragua, and U.S.-Cuban talks to cool mutual
hostility.
Although Castro did not refer directly to what Lopez
Portillo has called the "real possibility" of U.S.-Cuban talks,
Castro offered to participate in the peace plan if the United
States"promises not to assault its neighbors, if it stops its con
tinuous threats, if it stops using its arms and money to sup
port genocidal regimes, if it stops its subversive activities."
The Reagan administration has accused Castro of building
up Cuba's aggressive military might.
Washington has also given El Salvador's junta $90 million in
military aid to fight guerrillas that President Ronald Reagan
says are armed with weapons sent from Cuba through leftist
ruled Nicaragua.
Nicaragua and Cuba deny an arms flow. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig has repeatedly hinted at U.S. military action
to stop it.
The leader of Nicaragua's leftist junta, Daniel Ortega, has
also endorsed Lopez Portillo's proposed non-aggression
pact. It calls on Nicaragua to reduce a military buildup pro
vided Washington ends threats of military action and disarms
Nicaraguan exiles in the United States it says are training to
retake their homeland.
Stock market has a mixed day
New York — The stock market was mixed in what analysts
termed a trendless session yesterday after falling to a 21-
month low on Monday.
Investors failed to decisively respond to either the first re
duction in the prime lending rate since Dec. 1, or a govern
ment report indicating continued economic weakness.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled
13.04 points Monday, rose 1.72 to close at 812.98.
Banks nationwide reduced their prime lending rate to 16.5
percent from 17 percent, but interest rates stabilized in the
credit markets after falling sharply the three previous ses
sions.
Gold was $361 per ounce in New York yeterday.
Today's weather
Fair, with northwesterly winds. Highs in the upper 50sto
mid 60s, lows in the upper 30s to 40s.
Governors ponder federalism
Washington — The nation's governors yesterday formally agreed to
begin negotiations with President Ronald Reagan on a bipartisan plan
for sorting out federal and state responsibilities.
They acted unanimously after Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.), describing this as a "now-or-never" opportunity, pledged
Senate hearings this spring on the federalism issue and said he would try
for a floor vote before adjournment.
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) however, describing
the sorting-out proposal as "part of the overall retrenchment on social
policy" of the Reagan administration, told the governors there would
be "hard scrutiny" of the idea in House hearings.
But under prodding from some Democratic governors who advocate
the sorting-out process, O'Neill promised that the House "will not take
federalism and put it under the table." He even suggested that the con
gressional Democrats might try to draft an alternative of their own.
Thus, the three days of the midwinter governors' meeting produced
what Reagan operatives had hoped to obtain: an agreement to nego
tiate the substantial differences between the original Reagan plan and
the governors' traditional position, in an atmosphere where partisan
differences do not foredoom the product to automatic defeat in Con
gress.
Reagan has proposed that the federal government take over the fed
eral-state Medicaid program while the states pick up food stamps, now
all federal, and the state-federal program of Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Predictably, the governors like the first half of this but
have asked Reagan to set aside the second. Their traditional position has
been that the federal government should take over all support pro
grams for the poor.
The White House has promised extensive consultations with mayors,
state legislators and county officials before sending legislation to Con
gress but the administration has not yet made any arrangements with
those groups for doing so.
"We understand that it's an open process that they are talking about,"
said Mike Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, whose
big city mayor members have been among the most vocal opponents to
federalism. "I guess feelings would be hurt if we couldn't be a part of
that process."
The final session of the governors' meeting was full of re
minders of the partisan and policy differences that threaten
the federalism initiative and still might sink it in the tricky
process ahead.
Democratic governors, at a party caucus preceding the
formal session, submerged their endorsement of the in
itiative in a statement lambasting the Reagan budget and ec
onomic policy and warning that "the promises of federalism
will ring hollow" unless the economy is cured.
Baker gave it a push forward by pleading that it not be
come "a political football" and promising to seek a Senate
vote this year.
But then O'Neill, after calling Reaganomics a "blueprint
for disaster," began throwing cold water on the federalism
initiative. He said he could "very easily" agree to returning
about 17 of the 43 programs Reagan suggested sending back
to the states — mainly in the education and transportation
fields.
But he questioned whether any income-support programs
should be included in the swap and asked "if a time of re
cession is a good time" even to be discussing such a switch.
Bombs explode in Beirut market
Beirut — Two huge bombs exploded within minutes of
each other in one of the city's main market areas yesterday
killing and wounding dozens of people who were doing
their noon-hour shopping.
The first of the blasts exploded at about 12:20 p.m. and the
second followed four minutes later, just as a crowd was
gathering to watch the beginning of frantic rescue opera
tions. The second bomb was so powerful that it transformed
25 cars into twisted pieces of metal, blew up two gas stations,
and ignited a fire that was still out of control two hours later.
All windows in a 16-story building directly across the street
were blown out and residents there staggered to the ground
floor, searching for medical help.
In the confusion, there was no official estimate of those
killed in the explosion. Figures ranged from seven to 70. The
explosion was the worst in Beirut since last October, when a

lished governments in the region, and by development of
bases in Cuba and neighboring Grenada that could be used
by the Soviet Union for thrusts against vital allied shipping
lanes, the United States and its NATO allies will conduct ma
jor air and naval exercises in the Caribbean next month.
But the difficulty of winning regional support for the ad
ministration's view of problems in the Caribbean was under
scored yesterday by a State Department announcement dis
missing Mexico's offer to mediate between the United States
and Nicaragua, another Caribbean trouble spot.
The statement, read by spokesman Dean Fischer but bear
ing the sanction of Secretary of State Alexander Haig,
brushed aside President Jose Lopez Portillo's proposed
strategy for reducing tension between the two countries on
grounds that Nicaragua must first stop supporting insurgents

in El Salvador.
Other elements of Lopez Portillo's proposal — offered
Sunday in the course of a speech in the Nicaraguan capital,
Managua, and heralded as a major initiative — are still under
study, Fischer said. These include a suggested dialogue be
tween Washington and Havana through Mexican in
termediaries and a negotiated end to the civil war in El
Salvador.
Reagan has made a special effort to improve U.S.-Mexican
relations through personal contacts with Lopez Portillo. But
the perfunctory tone of the State Department's reaction to
the Mexican president's personal initiative seemed likely to
undermine that effort. And Mexico has never shown much
enthusiasm for Reagan's anti-Cuba and anti-Nicaragua poli
cies.
Partially out of deference to Mexico's view of the Carib
bean situation, Reagan's OAS speech is expected to concen
trate on economic aid and expanded trade proposals — on
which the United States had conferred with Mexico, Canda
and Venezuela. But the text may still contain some tough
rhetoric aimed at Cuba and Nicaragua.
Haig is understood to have pushed hard for language in
the text reflecting the view that an economic program aimed
at "alleviating social unrest" in the region should also be pre
sented as a program aimed at thwarting Cuban allies in the
region.
U.S. warship monitors El Salvador
Washington — The United States is keeping a destroyer
equipped with sophisticated electronic gear off the coast of
El Salvador to listen in on radio communications, Pentagon
sources said yesterday.
Defense officials who asked not to be identified waved
aside suggestions that the warship was meant to be a show of
force. A single destroyer does not pack enough combat
power for that, they said.
Although intelligence-gathering methods are closely
guarded, it is known that the destroyers of the Spruance class
are fitted with the most advanced equipment for what is
called communications intelligence. The Deo, on station in
the Pacific off El Salvador since some time in January, and the
Caron, which recently relieved it, are both of the Spruance
class.
It could not be determined whose radio traffic was being
intercepted. But the ship would be in a position to overhear
communications among guerrilla units in El Salvador and be
tween those units and supporters in neighboring Nicaragua.
The sources said the relief of the Deo indicated the in
telligence mission would continue indefinitely.
Committee proposes budget plan
Washington — The chairman of the Senate Budget Com
mittee proposed the most comprehensive alternative to date
for President Ronald Reagan's embattled budget yesterday
and predicted that his plan will win bipartisan support in
Congress.
The chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), rejecting the
president's deficit-laden plan, proposed a compromise
budget with bigger tax increases, less defense spending and
lower deficits than Reagan envisioned.
His action, backed up by criticism of the administration's
budget proposal by Republican senators who usually sup
port the president, was the strongest indication so far that
Reagan's spending plan will undergo major revision in Con
gress.
Domenici said that the deficit in Reagan's budget "threat
ens to crush any hope of economic recovery," adding that a
stalemate between the White House and Congress "could
push us to the brink not only of a serious and prolonged re
cession in America, but of a dangerous economic slowdown
throughout the industrialized world."
Domenici said his plan would reduce projected federal
deficits by $320 billion over the next three years, partly by
halting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits
and other federal programs.
Other highlights of the plan:
•Defense. Reduce the president's spending requests by
imposing a limit of 5 percent, after adjustment for inflation,
on annual increases for the Pentagon, saving from $20 billion
to $25 billion over three years.
•Taxes. A series of unspecified changes that would raise
$18 billion in fiscal year 1983, another $49 billion in fiscal 1984
and $55 billion in fiscal 1985.
•Federal pay. A freeze would be imposed on government
salaries in fiscal year 1983, with a 5 percent increase in 1984
and 1985, saving $25 billion.
•Domestic spending. Freeze most non-defense domestic
programs at current levels of spending for three years, saving
$34 billion.
•Medicare. Limit increases in Medicare and Medicaid pro
grams to the rise in the Consumer Price Index, saving $22
billion over three years.
The president stood firm behind his budget, however, and
was quoted by presidential spokesman David Gergen as tell

ing Republican congressional leaders at the White House
yesterday that he was as unhappy about the deficits as they
were.
Impact of Poland sanctions minor
London — America's allies have moved only hesitantly
toward joining the United States in sanctions against the So
viet Union and Poland because of the imposition of martial
law in Poland.
The impact of most of the actions appears minor, although
together they represent growing displeasure at the Polish
clampdown Dec. 13. In addition, a major deal with the Sovi
ets to pipe gas to Western Europe apparently is going ahead
with the participation of West Germany, France and Japan
despite U.S. opposition.
In mid-January, the NATO allies announced that further
credits for goods other than food for Poland would be
placed in abeyance, and negotiations on 1982 payments on
Polish debts would be suspended.
Yesterday, the Common Market agreed to limit imports of
certain goods from the Soviet Union to apply pressure for a
relaxation of martial law in Poland. The decision affects a
small but still undetermined percentage of the $11 billion
worth of goods the countries import annually from the Sovi
et Union.
Common Market officials said the action would involve
lowering quotas or raising tariffs on manufactured and lux
ury goods purchased from the Soviet Union. Most likely to
be hit would be caviar, diamonds, furs and alcoholic
beverages.
But an overwhelming amount of Common Market imports
are energy products and raw materials, which would not be
affected.
Castro endorses Mexico's peace plan
Mexico City — Fidel Castro has endorsed a Mexican peace
plan for Central America that calls for talks between Cuba
and the United States. But he set a condition — that the Rea
gan administration stop what he called "continuous threats"
against its neighbors.
The Cuban president, in a letter to Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo, also said he was "ready to offer the fullest
guarantees" that weapons in Cuba will not be used for ag
gression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.
He did not elaborate on what was meant by "guarantees."
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina made the letter
public here yesterday. Castro was responding to a three-part
peace initiative outlined Sunday by Lopez Portillo in Mana
gua, Nicaragua. It called for a negotiated settlement of El
Salvador's civil war, a non-aggression pact between the Unit
ed States and Nicaragua, and U.S.-Cuban talks to cool mutual
hostility.
Although Castro did not refer directly to what Lopez
Portillo has called the "real possibility" of U.S.-Cuban talks,
Castro offered to participate in the peace plan if the United
States"promises not to assault its neighbors, if it stops its con
tinuous threats, if it stops using its arms and money to sup
port genocidal regimes, if it stops its subversive activities."
The Reagan administration has accused Castro of building
up Cuba's aggressive military might.
Washington has also given El Salvador's junta $90 million in
military aid to fight guerrillas that President Ronald Reagan
says are armed with weapons sent from Cuba through leftist
ruled Nicaragua.
Nicaragua and Cuba deny an arms flow. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig has repeatedly hinted at U.S. military action
to stop it.
The leader of Nicaragua's leftist junta, Daniel Ortega, has
also endorsed Lopez Portillo's proposed non-aggression
pact. It calls on Nicaragua to reduce a military buildup pro
vided Washington ends threats of military action and disarms
Nicaraguan exiles in the United States it says are training to
retake their homeland.
Stock market has a mixed day
New York — The stock market was mixed in what analysts
termed a trendless session yesterday after falling to a 21-
month low on Monday.
Investors failed to decisively respond to either the first re
duction in the prime lending rate since Dec. 1, or a govern
ment report indicating continued economic weakness.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled
13.04 points Monday, rose 1.72 to close at 812.98.
Banks nationwide reduced their prime lending rate to 16.5
percent from 17 percent, but interest rates stabilized in the
credit markets after falling sharply the three previous ses
sions.
Gold was $361 per ounce in New York yeterday.
Today's weather
Fair, with northwesterly winds. Highs in the upper 50sto
mid 60s, lows in the upper 30s to 40s.
Governors ponder federalism
Washington — The nation's governors yesterday formally agreed to
begin negotiations with President Ronald Reagan on a bipartisan plan
for sorting out federal and state responsibilities.
They acted unanimously after Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.), describing this as a "now-or-never" opportunity, pledged
Senate hearings this spring on the federalism issue and said he would try
for a floor vote before adjournment.
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) however, describing
the sorting-out proposal as "part of the overall retrenchment on social
policy" of the Reagan administration, told the governors there would
be "hard scrutiny" of the idea in House hearings.
But under prodding from some Democratic governors who advocate
the sorting-out process, O'Neill promised that the House "will not take
federalism and put it under the table." He even suggested that the con
gressional Democrats might try to draft an alternative of their own.
Thus, the three days of the midwinter governors' meeting produced
what Reagan operatives had hoped to obtain: an agreement to nego
tiate the substantial differences between the original Reagan plan and
the governors' traditional position, in an atmosphere where partisan
differences do not foredoom the product to automatic defeat in Con
gress.
Reagan has proposed that the federal government take over the fed
eral-state Medicaid program while the states pick up food stamps, now
all federal, and the state-federal program of Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Predictably, the governors like the first half of this but
have asked Reagan to set aside the second. Their traditional position has
been that the federal government should take over all support pro
grams for the poor.
The White House has promised extensive consultations with mayors,
state legislators and county officials before sending legislation to Con
gress but the administration has not yet made any arrangements with
those groups for doing so.
"We understand that it's an open process that they are talking about,"
said Mike Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, whose
big city mayor members have been among the most vocal opponents to
federalism. "I guess feelings would be hurt if we couldn't be a part of
that process."
The final session of the governors' meeting was full of re
minders of the partisan and policy differences that threaten
the federalism initiative and still might sink it in the tricky
process ahead.
Democratic governors, at a party caucus preceding the
formal session, submerged their endorsement of the in
itiative in a statement lambasting the Reagan budget and ec
onomic policy and warning that "the promises of federalism
will ring hollow" unless the economy is cured.
Baker gave it a push forward by pleading that it not be
come "a political football" and promising to seek a Senate
vote this year.
But then O'Neill, after calling Reaganomics a "blueprint
for disaster," began throwing cold water on the federalism
initiative. He said he could "very easily" agree to returning
about 17 of the 43 programs Reagan suggested sending back
to the states — mainly in the education and transportation
fields.
But he questioned whether any income-support programs
should be included in the swap and asked "if a time of re
cession is a good time" even to be discussing such a switch.
Bombs explode in Beirut market
Beirut — Two huge bombs exploded within minutes of
each other in one of the city's main market areas yesterday
killing and wounding dozens of people who were doing
their noon-hour shopping.
The first of the blasts exploded at about 12:20 p.m. and the
second followed four minutes later, just as a crowd was
gathering to watch the beginning of frantic rescue opera
tions. The second bomb was so powerful that it transformed
25 cars into twisted pieces of metal, blew up two gas stations,
and ignited a fire that was still out of control two hours later.
All windows in a 16-story building directly across the street
were blown out and residents there staggered to the ground
floor, searching for medical help.
In the confusion, there was no official estimate of those
killed in the explosion. Figures ranged from seven to 70. The
explosion was the worst in Beirut since last October, when a
car bomb detonated in a Palestinian section of the city killed
more than 70 people.
Last year, more than 200 people were killed in 18car bomb
ings throughout Beirut, with various causes and groups
claiming responsibility for them.
A short time after yesterday's explosion, a group calling
itself the "Holy War Front" took responsibility for the double
bombing, saying it was in retaliation for the deaths of inno
cent families in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. An
other group known as the Front for the Liberation of Leba
non from Foreigners also claimed responsibility.
For the past week, Tripoli has been the scene of heavy
fighting between Syrian peace-keeping forces and members
of Palestinian and other leftist groups. Eighteen people were
reported killed in that fighting, which is seen by some ob
servers here as an extension of the sectarian fighting now
going on in Syria.
An hour after yesterday's Beirut explosion, the cordoned
off area was still a scene of panic as ambulances raced in to
carry out the dead and wounded. Firemen poured water on
the red-hot tin roofs in an attempt to keep the fire from
spreading.
Wreckers, working in the thick, black smoke, picked up
the burned-out shells of cars and dropped them in a pile on
the other side of the street. Men with megaphones pleaded
with civilians to leave the area because of the possibility of
another explosion.
Reagan to promise trade benefits
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's speech to the
Organization of American States today will propose new
trade benefits and offer the modest sum of about $300 mil
lion in economic assistance to the countries of the Caribbean
basin.
For diplomatic and other reasons, however, the long-de
layed speech will soft-pedal the administration's rising ap
prehension over the increased military threat posed by
Cuba.
Concerned both by Cuba's role in helping topple estab
lished governments in the region, and by development of
bases in Cuba and neighboring Grenada that could be used
by the Soviet Union for thrusts against vital allied shipping

Washington — The United States is keeping a destroyer
equipped with sophisticated electronic gear off the coast of
El Salvador to listen in on radio communications, Pentagon
sources said yesterday.
Defense officials who asked not to be identified waved
aside suggestions that the warship was meant to be a show of
force. A single destroyer does not pack enough combat
power for that, they said.
Although intelligence-gathering methods are closely
guarded, it is known that the destroyers of the Spruance class
are fitted with the most advanced equipment for what is
called communications intelligence. The Deo, on station in
the Pacific off El Salvador since some time in January, and the
Caron, which recently relieved it, are both of the Spruance
class.
It could not be determined whose radio traffic was being
intercepted. But the ship would be in a position to overhear
communications among guerrilla units in El Salvador and be
tween those units and supporters in neighboring Nicaragua.
The sources said the relief of the Deo indicated the in
telligence mission would continue indefinitely.
Committee proposes budget plan
Washington — The chairman of the Senate Budget Com
mittee proposed the most comprehensive alternative to date
for President Ronald Reagan's embattled budget yesterday
and predicted that his plan will win bipartisan support in
Congress.
The chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), rejecting the
president's deficit-laden plan, proposed a compromise
budget with bigger tax increases, less defense spending and
lower deficits than Reagan envisioned.
His action, backed up by criticism of the administration's
budget proposal by Republican senators who usually sup
port the president, was the strongest indication so far that
Reagan's spending plan will undergo major revision in Con
gress.
Domenici said that the deficit in Reagan's budget "threat
ens to crush any hope of economic recovery," adding that a
stalemate between the White House and Congress "could
push us to the brink not only of a serious and prolonged re
cession in America, but of a dangerous economic slowdown
throughout the industrialized world."
Domenici said his plan would reduce projected federal
deficits by $320 billion over the next three years, partly by
halting cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits
and other federal programs.
Other highlights of the plan:
•Defense. Reduce the president's spending requests by
imposing a limit of 5 percent, after adjustment for inflation,
on annual increases for the Pentagon, saving from $20 billion
to $25 billion over three years.
•Taxes. A series of unspecified changes that would raise
$18 billion in fiscal year 1983, another $49 billion in fiscal 1984
and $55 billion in fiscal 1985.
•Federal pay. A freeze would be imposed on government
salaries in fiscal year 1983, with a 5 percent increase in 1984
and 1985, saving $25 billion.
•Domestic spending. Freeze most non-defense domestic
programs at current levels of spending for three years, saving
$34 billion.
•Medicare. Limit increases in Medicare and Medicaid pro
grams to the rise in the Consumer Price Index, saving $22
billion over three years.
The president stood firm behind his budget, however, and
was quoted by presidential spokesman David Gergen as tell

ing Republican congressional leaders at the White House
yesterday that he was as unhappy about the deficits as they
were.
Impact of Poland sanctions minor
London — America's allies have moved only hesitantly
toward joining the United States in sanctions against the So
viet Union and Poland because of the imposition of martial
law in Poland.
The impact of most of the actions appears minor, although
together they represent growing displeasure at the Polish
clampdown Dec. 13. In addition, a major deal with the Sovi
ets to pipe gas to Western Europe apparently is going ahead
with the participation of West Germany, France and Japan
despite U.S. opposition.
In mid-January, the NATO allies announced that further
credits for goods other than food for Poland would be
placed in abeyance, and negotiations on 1982 payments on
Polish debts would be suspended.
Yesterday, the Common Market agreed to limit imports of
certain goods from the Soviet Union to apply pressure for a
relaxation of martial law in Poland. The decision affects a
small but still undetermined percentage of the $11 billion
worth of goods the countries import annually from the Sovi
et Union.
Common Market officials said the action would involve
lowering quotas or raising tariffs on manufactured and lux
ury goods purchased from the Soviet Union. Most likely to
be hit would be caviar, diamonds, furs and alcoholic
beverages.
But an overwhelming amount of Common Market imports
are energy products and raw materials, which would not be
affected.
Castro endorses Mexico's peace plan
Mexico City — Fidel Castro has endorsed a Mexican peace
plan for Central America that calls for talks between Cuba
and the United States. But he set a condition — that the Rea
gan administration stop what he called "continuous threats"
against its neighbors.
The Cuban president, in a letter to Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo, also said he was "ready to offer the fullest
guarantees" that weapons in Cuba will not be used for ag
gression anywhere in the Western Hemisphere.
He did not elaborate on what was meant by "guarantees."
The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina made the letter
public here yesterday. Castro was responding to a three-part
peace initiative outlined Sunday by Lopez Portillo in Mana
gua, Nicaragua. It called for a negotiated settlement of El
Salvador's civil war, a non-aggression pact between the Unit
ed States and Nicaragua, and U.S.-Cuban talks to cool mutual
hostility.
Although Castro did not refer directly to what Lopez
Portillo has called the "real possibility" of U.S.-Cuban talks,
Castro offered to participate in the peace plan if the United
States"promises not to assault its neighbors, if it stops its con
tinuous threats, if it stops using its arms and money to sup
port genocidal regimes, if it stops its subversive activities."
The Reagan administration has accused Castro of building
up Cuba's aggressive military might.
Washington has also given El Salvador's junta $90 million in
military aid to fight guerrillas that President Ronald Reagan
says are armed with weapons sent from Cuba through leftist
ruled Nicaragua.
Nicaragua and Cuba deny an arms flow. Secretary of State
Alexander Haig has repeatedly hinted at U.S. military action
to stop it.
The leader of Nicaragua's leftist junta, Daniel Ortega, has
also endorsed Lopez Portillo's proposed non-aggression
pact. It calls on Nicaragua to reduce a military buildup pro
vided Washington ends threats of military action and disarms
Nicaraguan exiles in the United States it says are training to
retake their homeland.
Stock market has a mixed day
New York — The stock market was mixed in what analysts
termed a trendless session yesterday after falling to a 21-
month low on Monday.
Investors failed to decisively respond to either the first re
duction in the prime lending rate since Dec. 1, or a govern
ment report indicating continued economic weakness.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which tumbled
13.04 points Monday, rose 1.72 to close at 812.98.
Banks nationwide reduced their prime lending rate to 16.5
percent from 17 percent, but interest rates stabilized in the
credit markets after falling sharply the three previous ses
sions.
Gold was $361 per ounce in New York yeterday.
Today's weather
Fair, with northwesterly winds. Highs in the upper 50sto
mid 60s, lows in the upper 30s to 40s.
