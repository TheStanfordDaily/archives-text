Governors ponder federalism
Washington â€” The nation's governors yesterday formally agreed to
begin negotiations with President Ronald Reagan on a bipartisan plan
for sorting out federal and state responsibilities.
They acted unanimously after Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.), describing this as a "now-or-never" opportunity, pledged
Senate hearings this spring on the federalism issue and said he would try
for a floor vote before adjournment.
House Speaker Thomas (Tip) O'Neill (D-Mass.) however, describing
the sorting-out proposal as "part of the overall retrenchment on social
policy" of the Reagan administration, told the governors there would
be "hard scrutiny" of the idea in House hearings.
But under prodding from some Democratic governors who advocate
the sorting-out process, O'Neill promised that the House "will not take
federalism and put it under the table." He even suggested that the con
gressional Democrats might try to draft an alternative of their own.
Thus, the three days of the midwinter governors' meeting produced
what Reagan operatives had hoped to obtain: an agreement to nego
tiate the substantial differences between the original Reagan plan and
the governors' traditional position, in an atmosphere where partisan
differences do not foredoom the product to automatic defeat in Con
gress.
Reagan has proposed that the federal government take over the fed
eral-state Medicaid program while the states pick up food stamps, now
all federal, and the state-federal program of Aid to Families with Depen
dent Children. Predictably, the governors like the first half of this but
have asked Reagan to set aside the second. Their traditional position has
been that the federal government should take over all support pro
grams for the poor.
The White House has promised extensive consultations with mayors,
state legislators and county officials before sending legislation to Con
gress but the administration has not yet made any arrangements with
those groups for doing so.
"We understand that it's an open process that they are talking about,"
said Mike Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Mayors, whose
big city mayor members have been among the most vocal opponents to
federalism. "I guess feelings would be hurt if we couldn't be a part of
that process."
