## Tuition rise, a dad's demise 
### 
Boy was Dad bummed. We broke the bad news to him
as subtly as we could after he had downed a few drinks
one night over Christmas break. But how subtle can a 15
percent tuition increase be? Remembering President
Donald Kennedy's letter of advice to Stanford students
with more than one sibling here, we tried a few of his
top 10 excuses to tell your father about a tuition in
crease."
We soon realized it was useless — another scotch
would not even ease the pain. Dad slumped to his knees
and a pained look crossed his face which we had not
seen since Mom ran over Skippy with the Malibu.
We understood what he was going through. It was not
easy to put one, much less two, children through a
school with one of the highest tuitions in the country.
But surely, what worried him most was that our little
brother John was a senior in high school and had nothing
but private universities on his mind.
Our feelings of guilt mounted as the vacation got long
er. Dad had begun to glare accusingly at all three of us
every night over dinner. We also noticed that he had re
cently picked up a small twitch in his face. We tried to be
as nice to him as we could. Heck, we let him beat us in
ping-pong and even let him listen to classical music
while we were in the car, but we could tell it did not
make him feel any better. He was obviously not in the
Christmas spirit either — the only present he gave us was
Frommer's "College on $5 a Day."
It had become so uncomfortable that the two of us de
cided to present Dad with a plan. We volunteered to
drop out of school immediately and start work at Baskin-
Robbins. We were quite relieved when he refused to call
our bluff.
"I have a better plan," he said with a grin. "I don't want
to ruin your educations at this point, but we must keep
John away from Palo Alto."
He pulled out a file stamped "confidential" from a
locked desk drawer and looked over what we realized
was a well thought-out scheme.
"Boys," he smiled without twitching, "I have been
preparing for this disaster the past three years and my
plan for John has been under effect this fall." Dad re
fused to reveal his plan to us that night, but he told us not
to worry about the "little guy."
A couple of weeks later we received a package from
home. Enclosed was a tape recorder, photographs of var
ious Zetes and comp sci majors, and a note from Dad
wishing us good luck with "Operation Slippery Rock."
We turned on the tape and listened.
"Good morning Messrs. Kohn. Your mission, should
you choose to accept it, is to search and destroy all ideas
that your brother John has about going to your fine
Western university. The following is the four-step plan
that was under effect this fall but which (there is a pause
in the tape here and sobbing) has yet to work on the little
tyke.
"First, when I saw the Stanford application on his desk
this fall, I reminded him that he never got along with you
two anyway. I reminded him about the time you hung

him up in the tree by his underwear when he was six. I
also tried to convince him that he should take a year off
and gel his head together about the whole college idea.
Besides, I told him, Leon Spinks never went to college,
and look at him.
"Second, I took him out drinking before the SATs. He
complained that he had already missed the Stanley
Kaplan course because I had snuck off to New York the
day I promised to sign him up, and that being drunk
would not help him get into Stanford. I convinced him
that Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon did not want
nerds anyway. Drinking, I told him, was a much ap
preciated extracurricular activity. That little guy can real
ly hold his liquor — he scored 1430.

application on his desk this fall, I

"Third, I had seen only private school applications on
John's desk so I decided to send away for a few myself.
Applications from Ball State, St. Louis Community Col
lege and Slippery Rock came soon thereafter. I tried to
convince John that these football powerhouses were
perfect places to hone his punting skills. I also told him
that San Diego State was not a party school, but he did
not believe me.
"Fourth, I doctored John's Stanford application. I
switched his recommendations from Joe Montana and
President Ronald Reagan to Roman Polanski and Rich
ard Nixon. I took the liberty to change his formal picture
for one I took of him doing flaming shots before the
SATs. I also changed his descriptive adjective to 'proph
ylactic,' and then rewrote his essay in crayon.
"Boys, so far my efforts have been to no avail. The let
ter John received from Hargadon voiding his right toap
ply to Stanford did not work as John quickly recognized
my handwriting. Our last hope at discouraging him will
be when he goes college visiting there soon. Be sure that
he meets the Zetes and comp sci majors seen in the
enclosed pictures. A drive through scenic East Palo Alto
is also crucial.
"I want this to be a college visit that John will never
forget and never want to remember. Keep in jnind that
Baskin-Robbins has agreed to accept both your job ap
plications in case of your failure. Mom says 'Hi' and we
are considering wallpapering the den. What do you
think — sky blue or avocado? This tape will self-destruct
in 15 seconds. Best of luck — Dad."

nerds anyway. Drinking, I told him, was a much ap
preciated extracurricular activity. That little guy can real
ly hold his liquor — he scored 1430.

Applications from Ball State, St. Louis Community Col

perfect places to hone his punting skills. I also told him
that San Diego State was not a party school, but he did
not believe me.

switched his recommendations from Joe Montana and

Boy was Dad bummed. We broke the bad news to him
as subtly as we could after he had downed a few drinks
one night over Christmas break. But how subtle can a 15
percent tuition increase be? Remembering President
Donald Kennedy's letter of advice to Stanford students
with more than one sibling here, we tried a few of his
top 10 excuses to tell your father about a tuition in
crease."
We soon realized it was useless — another scotch
would not even ease the pain. Dad slumped to his knees
and a pained look crossed his face which we had not
seen since Mom ran over Skippy with the Malibu.
We understood what he was going through. It was not
easy to put one, much less two, children through a
school with one of the highest tuitions in the country.
But surely, what worried him most was that our little
brother John was a senior in high school and had nothing
but private universities on his mind.
Our feelings of guilt mounted as the vacation got long
er. Dad had begun to glare accusingly at all three of us
every night over dinner. We also noticed that he had re
cently picked up a small twitch in his face. We tried to be
as nice to him as we could. Heck, we let him beat us in
ping-pong and even let him listen to classical music
while we were in the car, but we could tell it did not
make him feel any better. He was obviously not in the
Christmas spirit either — the only present he gave us was
Frommer's "College on $5 a Day."
It had become so uncomfortable that the two of us de
cided to present Dad with a plan. We volunteered to
drop out of school immediately and start work at Baskin-
Robbins. We were quite relieved when he refused to call
our bluff.
"I have a better plan," he said with a grin. "I don't want
to ruin your educations at this point, but we must keep
John away from Palo Alto."
He pulled out a file stamped "confidential" from a
locked desk drawer and looked over what we realized
was a well thought-out scheme.
"Boys," he smiled without twitching, "I have been
preparing for this disaster the past three years and my
plan for John has been under effect this fall." Dad re
fused to reveal his plan to us that night, but he told us not
to worry about the "little guy."
A couple of weeks later we received a package from
home. Enclosed was a tape recorder, photographs of var
ious Zetes and comp sci majors, and a note from Dad
wishing us good luck with "Operation Slippery Rock."
We turned on the tape and listened.
"Good morning Messrs. Kohn. Your mission, should
you choose to accept it, is to search and destroy all ideas
that your brother John has about going to your fine
Western university. The following is the four-step plan
that was under effect this fall but which (there is a pause
in the tape here and sobbing) has yet to work on the little
tyke.
"First, when I saw the Stanford application on his desk
this fall, I reminded him that he never got along with you
two anyway. I reminded him about the time you hung

him up in the tree by his underwear when he was six. I
also tried to convince him that he should take a year off
and gel his head together about the whole college idea.
Besides, I told him, Leon Spinks never went to college,
and look at him.
"Second, I took him out drinking before the SATs. He
complained that he had already missed the Stanley
Kaplan course because I had snuck off to New York the
day I promised to sign him up, and that being drunk
would not help him get into Stanford. I convinced him
that Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon did not want
nerds anyway. Drinking, I told him, was a much ap
preciated extracurricular activity. That little guy can real
