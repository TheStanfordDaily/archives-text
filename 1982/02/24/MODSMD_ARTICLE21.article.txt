## Living with crime in society 
### 
I was somewhat surprised at the re
sponses to my letter "Use Care when
Alone," by Alex McDavid (Daily, Feb.
12) and Shari Libicki and Joan Warren
(Daily, Feb. 16). I think they and oth
ers with their attitudes need to un
derstand what crime is about in a
large urban area such asthe San Fran
cisco Bay Area.
Their responses indicate to me that
they come from extremely low- or
no-crime areas of the country. In
fact, there are so many criminals re
siding in and around urban areas that
it is impossible to effectively
eliminate the possibility of a crime
being committed. Because of this im
possibility, rape awareness programs
(e.g. self-defense courses, ASSU rape
whistles) or mass crime-fighting
techniques cannot succeed by them
selves. My suggestion to never go
alone to isolated or deserted areas of
the campus is therefore necessary to
combat the rape problem.
McDavid refered to my solution as
"slavery," and stated "men shouldn't
be telling women how to run their
lives." My only response is that no
one is forcing women to comply with
my suggestion of common sense and
safety (fortunately, most women are
complying).
McDavid also suggested that "men
should be teaching other men how
to respect every individual's right to
freedom." This is a very nice concept,
but how does he think this can re
alistically effect a change in the rape
problem? Should we offer a class for

rapists and prospective rapists on
"Respect for Individuals' Freedom?"
Rape isa much more serious crime,
so it requires much more serious
safety precautions. "Women are not
naive ..." As a group, women are
not naive, but anyone who pretends
that urban crime is not a factor in our
lives is naive. "They are humans, with
every right to a free life." Who can
argue with that? Unfortunately, as I
have stated above, because of the
potential for crime in this area, we all
must sacrifice some freedoms to live
here.
Libicki asked, "how can I function
. . . if I must forever find someone to
accompany me to a place which is
'lonely'?" Obviously everyone will
have specific problems with my sug
gested precautions. Here are the
three realistic solutions I could think
of for your particular concerns: 1)
Disregard the rape problem and take
your chances; 2) Rearrange your
schedule so you don't need to go to
"lonely" places; or 3) Learn to func
tion while using escorts. It's really not
as hard as you might think — plenty
of men and women (besides the
SURE escort service) would be happy
to escort someone concerned about
her safety. Perhaps a late night prob
lem could be arranged two or three
days in advance.
Libicki again: "Let's be serious!.. .
we should attack the cause, not the
symptoms," and "we persist in blam
ing the victim instead of the rapist."

First of all, if you really don't believe
that my safety precautions are seri
ous, I suppose you believe Solution 1
above is the way to go. Secondly, at
tacking crime ("the cause") in an ur
ban area can lessen its effect, but,
once again, we can never fully
eliminate its presence. This is why we
can completely avoid rapeonly by us
ing precautions. "Blaming the vic
tim?" / never blamed the victim. My
original letter explicitly stated that
the victim was never to be blamed (it
was edited not by the Daily), but the
no-blame concept was implied nev
ertheless in the printed version.
Warren: "I do not consider the
choice between the bad and the hor
rible a real choice." What are the
choices? These are the realistic
choices I see: take precautions and
avoid rape; don't take precautions
and run the risk of being raped; or
move to a crime-free area.
Warren also saw "naivete ... in
thinking that the restriction of hu
man freedom is'incredibly simple.' "
Everyone knows it is grossly unfair to
have to sacrifice freedom to gain
safety (in fact, I said just that in my or
iginal letter), but we must do so in an
urban area in order to live safely.
Anyone who ignores these facts
about urban crime is making a seri
ous mistake — far outweighing the
prospective gained freedom.

one is forcing women to comply with
my suggestion of common sense and
safety (fortunately, most women are
complying).
McDavid also suggested that "men
should be teaching other men how
to respect every individual's right to
freedom." This is a very nice concept,
but how does he think this can re
alistically effect a change in the rape
problem? Should we offer a class for

rapists and prospective rapists on
"Respect for Individuals' Freedom?"
Rape isa much more serious crime,
so it requires much more serious
safety precautions. "Women are not
naive ..." As a group, women are
not naive, but anyone who pretends
that urban crime is not a factor in our
lives is naive. "They are humans, with
every right to a free life." Who can
argue with that? Unfortunately, as I
have stated above, because of the
potential for crime in this area, we all
must sacrifice some freedoms to live
here.
Libicki asked, "how can I function
. . . if I must forever find someone to
accompany me to a place which is
'lonely'?" Obviously everyone will
have specific problems with my sug
gested precautions. Here are the
three realistic solutions I could think
of for your particular concerns: 1)
Disregard the rape problem and take
your chances; 2) Rearrange your
schedule so you don't need to go to
"lonely" places; or 3) Learn to func
tion while using escorts. It's really not
as hard as you might think — plenty
of men and women (besides the
SURE escort service) would be happy
to escort someone concerned about
her safety. Perhaps a late night prob
lem could be arranged two or three
days in advance.
Libicki again: "Let's be serious!.. .
we should attack the cause, not the
symptoms," and "we persist in blam
ing the victim instead of the rapist."

First of all, if you really don't believe
that my safety precautions are seri
ous, I suppose you believe Solution 1
above is the way to go. Secondly, at
tacking crime ("the cause") in an ur
ban area can lessen its effect, but,
once again, we can never fully
eliminate its presence. This is why we
can completely avoid rapeonly by us
ing precautions. "Blaming the vic
tim?" / never blamed the victim. My
original letter explicitly stated that
the victim was never to be blamed (it
was edited not by the Daily), but the
no-blame concept was implied nev
ertheless in the printed version.
Warren: "I do not consider the
choice between the bad and the hor
rible a real choice." What are the
choices? These are the realistic
choices I see: take precautions and
avoid rape; don't take precautions
and run the risk of being raped; or
move to a crime-free area.
Warren also saw "naivete ... in
thinking that the restriction of hu
man freedom is'incredibly simple.' "
Everyone knows it is grossly unfair to
have to sacrifice freedom to gain
safety (in fact, I said just that in my or
iginal letter), but we must do so in an
urban area in order to live safely.
Anyone who ignores these facts
about urban crime is making a seri
ous mistake — far outweighing the
prospective gained freedom.

I was somewhat surprised at the re
sponses to my letter "Use Care when
Alone," by Alex McDavid (Daily, Feb.
12) and Shari Libicki and Joan Warren
(Daily, Feb. 16). I think they and oth
ers with their attitudes need to un
derstand what crime is about in a
large urban area such asthe San Fran
cisco Bay Area.
Their responses indicate to me that
they come from extremely low- or
no-crime areas of the country. In
fact, there are so many criminals re
siding in and around urban areas that
it is impossible to effectively
eliminate the possibility of a crime
being committed. Because of this im
possibility, rape awareness programs
(e.g. self-defense courses, ASSU rape
whistles) or mass crime-fighting
techniques cannot succeed by them
selves. My suggestion to never go
alone to isolated or deserted areas of
the campus is therefore necessary to
combat the rape problem.
McDavid refered to my solution as
"slavery," and stated "men shouldn't
be telling women how to run their
lives." My only response is that no
one is forcing women to comply with
my suggestion of common sense and
safety (fortunately, most women are
complying).
McDavid also suggested that "men
should be teaching other men how
to respect every individual's right to
freedom." This is a very nice concept,
but how does he think this can re
