## Questioning United States aid to El Salvador Sandra Boddy Electoral politics — a sham 
### 
Saving the "free world" from com
munism has become such an ob
session among U.S. foreign policy
makers that the rationale for the
directive now defies reason. At one
time, perhaps, "containment" made
sense, but we are no longer living in
the Cold War. The realities of our age
expose the hypocrisy of our govern
ment's anachronistic outlook on the
world.
El Salvador is a classic case in point.
At the expense of an oppressed and
impoverished populace, the United
States actively supports a right-wing
military junta because a Marxist take
over would be, by definition, morally
reprehensible. "Never mind the suf
fering and repression," say our incor
rigible policy-makers — "nothing is
worse than communism." Well,
frankly, the logic escapes me.
Amnesty International reports that
over the past two years, the rate of
killings by the Salvadoran security
forces has been higher than any
where else in the world. If the fact
that most of the victims are unarmed
peasants is not enough to jangle the
nerves of any all-American-minded
legislator or taxpayer, then mere
mention of the excesses exhibited by
the army during combat with the lef
tist guerilla forces should at least dis
concert anyone genuinely satisfied
with the integrity of this nation's
commitment to stand up for de
mocracy and the basic human rights
which all communist regimes
purportedly violate.
Fear of communism runs deep in El
Salvador. Ever since the peasant re
volt of 1932, in which the Com
munists played an active but not cen
tral role, the Salvadoran ruling elite
has equated communism with
peasant agitation. The uprising, trig
gered by the collapse of the coffee
market upon which the landless
peasants depended for their live

lihood, was brutally suppressed by
the army which then took control of
the government.
After the military take-over, elec
toral politics were a total sham until
the situation began to change in the
early 19705. A new electroal law pre
vented the army from controlling the
outcome of the elections and the op
position parties began to build up
strength. The 1972 presidential elec
tion was won by a Christain Demo
crat, Jose Napolean Duarte, but a mil
itary coup prevented his accession to
power.
The 1977 presidential election in
dicated that little had changed on the
El Salvadoran political scene. Army
general Carlos Humberto Romero
declared himself the victory over a
coalition of the Christian Democrats,
Social Democrats and Communists
and organized a right-wing para-mil
itary organization to harass and kill
peasant leaders. One of the govern
ment-financed death squads, the
White Warriors' Union, threatened
to kill all the Jesuits in El Salvador,
who, they claimed, were a Com
munist-front organization.
Only then did the situation in El
Salvador draw a negative response
from the United States. The Carter
administration nominally con
cerned with human rights, post
poned a vote of a $90 million Inter-
American Development Bank loan to
El Salvador. The activities of the death
squads temporarily subsided.
A few months later, however, the
loan went through. The Romero gov
ernment carried on much as before,
only worse. It passed a series of
draconian laws which censored the
press, banned public meetings, out
lawed strikes and suspended judicial
proceedings. Washington was silent.
Today it is outspoken, but it would
seem that the chief exponent of
Western ideals is backing the wrong

horse because, by an internal, out
dated logic, to support or even toler
ate a Marxist intrusion upon the hem
ispheric hegemony of the United
States would be tantamount to
treason. But where lies the wisdom in
sending aid to the government of El
Salvador? Historically, it has shown
no respect for freedom, liberty and
justice for all.
We have seen how far the United
States will go in trying to prevent
freedom-loving people from de
termining their own destiny when
ever communism has come upon the
scene. The situation in El Salvador is
yet another tragic illustration of what
such a single-minded and, yes,
simple-minded policy can produce.

crat, Jose Napolean Duarte, but a mil
itary coup prevented his accession to
power.
The 1977 presidential election in
dicated that little had changed on the
El Salvadoran political scene. Army
general Carlos Humberto Romero
declared himself the victory over a
coalition of the Christian Democrats,
Social Democrats and Communists
and organized a right-wing para-mil
itary organization to harass and kill
peasant leaders. One of the govern
ment-financed death squads, the
White Warriors' Union, threatened
to kill all the Jesuits in El Salvador,
who, they claimed, were a Com
munist-front organization.
Only then did the situation in El
Salvador draw a negative response
from the United States. The Carter
administration nominally con
cerned with human rights, post
poned a vote of a $90 million Inter-
American Development Bank loan to
El Salvador. The activities of the death
squads temporarily subsided.
A few months later, however, the
loan went through. The Romero gov
ernment carried on much as before,
only worse. It passed a series of
draconian laws which censored the
press, banned public meetings, out
lawed strikes and suspended judicial
proceedings. Washington was silent.
Today it is outspoken, but it would
seem that the chief exponent of
Western ideals is backing the wrong

horse because, by an internal, out
dated logic, to support or even toler
ate a Marxist intrusion upon the hem
ispheric hegemony of the United
States would be tantamount to
treason. But where lies the wisdom in
sending aid to the government of El
Salvador? Historically, it has shown
no respect for freedom, liberty and
justice for all.
We have seen how far the United
States will go in trying to prevent
freedom-loving people from de
termining their own destiny when
ever communism has come upon the
scene. The situation in El Salvador is
yet another tragic illustration of what
such a single-minded and, yes,
simple-minded policy can produce.

Saving the "free world" from com
munism has become such an ob
session among U.S. foreign policy
makers that the rationale for the
directive now defies reason. At one
time, perhaps, "containment" made
sense, but we are no longer living in
the Cold War. The realities of our age
expose the hypocrisy of our govern
ment's anachronistic outlook on the
world.
El Salvador is a classic case in point.
At the expense of an oppressed and
impoverished populace, the United
States actively supports a right-wing
military junta because a Marxist take
over would be, by definition, morally
reprehensible. "Never mind the suf
fering and repression," say our incor
rigible policy-makers — "nothing is
worse than communism." Well,
frankly, the logic escapes me.
Amnesty International reports that
over the past two years, the rate of
killings by the Salvadoran security
forces has been higher than any
where else in the world. If the fact
that most of the victims are unarmed
peasants is not enough to jangle the
nerves of any all-American-minded
legislator or taxpayer, then mere
mention of the excesses exhibited by
the army during combat with the lef
tist guerilla forces should at least dis
concert anyone genuinely satisfied
with the integrity of this nation's
commitment to stand up for de
mocracy and the basic human rights
which all communist regimes
purportedly violate.
Fear of communism runs deep in El
Salvador. Ever since the peasant re
volt of 1932, in which the Com
munists played an active but not cen
tral role, the Salvadoran ruling elite
has equated communism with
peasant agitation. The uprising, trig
gered by the collapse of the coffee
market upon which the landless
peasants depended for their live

lihood, was brutally suppressed by
the army which then took control of
the government.
After the military take-over, elec
toral politics were a total sham until
the situation began to change in the
early 19705. A new electroal law pre
vented the army from controlling the
outcome of the elections and the op
position parties began to build up
strength. The 1972 presidential elec
tion was won by a Christain Demo
crat, Jose Napolean Duarte, but a mil
itary coup prevented his accession to
power.
