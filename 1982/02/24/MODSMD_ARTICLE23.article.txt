## Reagan's mythical 'human rights' 
### 
A careful look at the situation in El
shows that the Reagan ad
ministration's interpretation of
events is superficial and misleading.
We want to explode three of the of
ficially promulgated myths central to
the administration's interpretation
here.
The first myth is that El Salvador is
what Alexander Haig called a "text
book case" of indirect Communist
subversion. The impression you get
from the administration is that the
opposition forces are supplied and
directed by Cuba and that the threat
the opposition poses could be sub
stantially reduced by severing the
Cuban connection.
This myth is based on the State De
partments' White Paper entitled
"Communist Interference in El
Salvador." The arguments in the pa
per belie a shallow, wholly military
view of the problems facing the peo
ple in El Salvador.
Not surprisingly, the attempts of
Reagan's special envoy, Lawrence
Eagleburger, to "sell" the White Pa
per to the Europeans in order to
build international support for the
U.S. stance were fruitless. The Eu
ropeans criticized the methods and
conclusions of the document. Much
of the U.S. press and Congress also
refused to swallow the propoganda.
Recently, one of the authors of the
paper publicly admitted that he had
extrapolated considerably.
Another myth promulgated by the
administration is that the current
government in El Salvador is "cen
trist" — that it is beseiged by ex
tremes of both left and right. The
guerrillas and death squads are
charged with the bulk of the
thousands of indiscriminate killings.
It is alleged that although President
Jose Duarte and the other moderate
civilians don't have total control of
the government, they are slowly and
surely gaining that control.
A most accurate characterization
of the government would be that of a
rightist military (ruling in alliance
with the oligarchy) with a civilian
facade. The power remains where it
always was — with the repressive, re
actionary military.
The most recent attempt at reform,
that of the progressive officers who
staged the palace coup of October
1979, met the same fate. The officers
sincerely desired to effect sweeping
reforms to benefit the population
and formed a junta with moderate ci
vilians to this end. However, at every
turn, these officers were forced into a
dilemma between proceeding with
reform (thus jeopardizing their hold
on power by alienating the strong
conservative factions in their ranks)
and holding on, however tenuously,
to power. The progressives were nev
er willing to risk dividing the military.
So the conservative factions quickly
i

regained power again forcing the
progressives out. The civilians have
been retained for show.
The agrarian reform of March 1980
is often proposed as evidence of the
government's will to reform and of its
essentially civilian character. The
agrarian reform is a sham. It left un
touched 91 percent of the coffee fin
cas, the economic source of the
oligarchy's power. Sharecropping
peasants were to receive titles to the
miniscule plots of land they farm —
the vast majority have not. The
peasants are still landless and poor.
Why has the reform been so inef
fective? The reform plan was
adopted under heavy U.S. pressure.
The military acceded to the plan in
theory because of this pressure, but
in operation the military used the ac
companying state of seige, (os
tensibly declared to facilitate "en
forcement" of the reform) to turn it
into a bloodbath. Under the aegis of
the reform, the military swept
through the countryside killing in
discriminately.
In a typical reform incident, re
counted by a Salvadorean land re
form official, the peasants on a large
plantation were informed that the
land was now theirs and told to form
a cooperative and elect leaders. The
next morning the military returned
and shot the leaders.
This is hardly the kind of reform a
centrist government would carry out.
It is exactly the kind of reform to be
expected from a military government
with a civilian facade.
The Reagan administration has
also put forward the alleged im
provement in human rights vio
lations as evidence of the growing
power of the civilians in the govern
ment. Respected organizations such
as Amnesty International, the United
Nations and the Catholic Church, all
agree that the government's per
formance has worsened con
siderably.
All the evidence indicates that
there has been no change in the dis
tribution of power in the
Salvadorean government. The power
to reform remains with those op
posed to it. The war will not end until
the reforms necessary to satisfy the
demands of the population are car
ried out. The government of El
Salvador continues to brutally op
pose reform. Only the outward ap
pearance has changed.
The third myth is that the opposi
tion, the FDR/FMLN has no popular
support.
The number and diversity of
groups organized under the um
brella of the FDR/FMLN speaks to
the opposition's broad base of-sup
port. Aimost every student, worker
and peasant organization in the
country as well as many professionals
(teachers, doctors, lawyers) have

joined the mass political organiza
tions and guerillas in the FDR/FMI N.
Some of the groups are Marxist.
Moderates intent on meaningful re
form, like the civilians in the first two
juntas, have joined.
The recent absence of a big anti
government demonstration in San
Salvador is cited by the adminis
tration as evidence of dwindling
popular support for the opposition.
Demonstrations involving up to
300,000 people are no longer a tactic
employed by the opposition because
all too often, they were broken up by
government troops firing into the
crowd. To continue demonstrating
would be suicide.
The U.S. government says the
guerrillas are able to move freely
through 10 to 15 provinces. They
could not doso without considerable
popular support.
Also, Murat Williams, a former U.S.
ambassador to El Salvador, estimates
that 80 percent of the population
supports the armed opposition.
Clearly, the left is supported by a
large part of the population — that
part which has been left out of the
political process for centuries. The
left is supported because it addresses
the needs which the government
neglects. Any representative govern
ment must include the left's partici
pator.
After stripping away the obfusca
tion in the Reagan administration's
official line on El Salvador, we see a
clear choice between the current
military government, protective of
the oligarchy, and an opposition gov
ernment responsive to the needs of
the poor majority.
Any lasting resolution to the civil
war must address its causes — the so
cial, political, and economic struc
tures which keep the majority of
Salvadoreans in poverty and fear. We
believe the current regime is in
capable of every carrying out mean
ingful reforms which address these
causes. This incapacity is a result of
the military's proven allegiance to
the oligarchy and brutal methods of
defending their entrenched posi
tion, which only give further cause
for revolt.
So the choices for a lasting resolu
tion of the war boil down to a bitterly
acquired FDR/FMLN victory or a ne
gotiated settlement. Because the U.S.
government obviously opposes an
outright rebel victory and this victory
would involve thousands of deaths,
we believe the United States should
immediately cut off aid to El Salvador
and put its pressure and what re
mains of its prestige behind the pos
sibility of a negotiated settlement
that would bring the left and the
commitment to reform it represents
into the government.
