## Aiding El Salvador: a necessary choice 
### 
While I appreciated Daily colum
nist joe Kennedy's attempt to justify
his "liberal" viewpoint on El Salvador
as both pragmatic and morally cor
rect (El Salvador: A liberal's ap
proach, Feb. 19), his arguments just
didn't hold up upon closer examina
tion. As much as he may feel that "the
time has come for liberals to start
arguing the practicality of morality,"
I, for one, hold that it is time for us all
to start arguing the morality of prac
f'Cfn'order to do this, we have to look
frankly at the current situation and
consider carefully the options open
to us. There is no choice to be made
between the way things are and the
way we would like them to be. Times
as they are, our options are limited
and, while we are sometimes forced
to choose the lesser evil rather than
the highest good, such a choice

proves to be more moral than the
"liberal" course of action which
often aims for an impractical higher
good and ends in an even greater
evil.
Kennedy claims that "the conser
vative argument draws its strength
from concerns for the military and
economic security of the United
States" and that the liberal stance
must be similarly based if it is to stand
a chance. I disagree.
It is the moral practicality of the
conservative argument which gives it
its strength. Granted, the govern
ment in El Salvador is little more than
a repressive military oligarchy but
sometimes a "little more" can make a
big difference. History offers us a
prime example (one which many lib
erals seem to have conveniently for
gotten) of what a "little more" has
done in Spain.
Not that long ago, Spain was em
broiled in a civil war which was even
tually lost by the leftist revolu
tionaries (much to the dismay of
high-minded intellectuals in Europe
and the United States). Although the
military strong-man who took con
trol of the country following the rev
olution sometimes employed op
pressive tactics and policies, he al
lowed many freedoms as well as lim
ited freedom of the press.
At that time, liberals complained
that General Francisco Franco's gov
ernment was "little more" than an
oppressive military dictatorship. To
day Spain has become one of the
most democratic and socialist
countries in Europe and not one shot
has been fired. The lesson is clear:
Spanish civil liberties were won
through evolution rather than revo
lution.

If liberty and democracy for the
people of El Salvador is our goal, we
cannot hope to obtain these ends
through revolution. Not once in the
history of man has communist-in
spired revolution led to the founda
tion of a democracy and there is no
reason to believe that the situation is
any different now.
Unfortunately, my liberal friends
prefer to deny the lessons of history
whenever these interfere with their
self-righteous concept of the higher
good. El Salvador's revolutionary
movement does have considerable
popular support and many leaders
who sincerely want the best for the
people of their country.
In order to keep control, the new
"peoples' government" would em
ploy the same Machiavelian
strategies they once opposed so vig
orously and the end would be even
less tolerable than conditions before
the revolution. Economic freedoms
would be eliminated, personal liber
ties (such as freedom of religion) lim
ited still more and the press would no
longer need to maintain even the
semblance of independence; it
would simply become another
branch of government.
The idea that we could withdraw
our support from El Salvador, ac
quiesing to "the forces of change,"
then form an economic alliance with
the victors is very appealing but at the
same time not credible. Kennedy
pinpoints the falacy of this argument
with hisstatement, "The first concern
of any government is to feed its peo
ple."
Although I wish that this were the
case, it seems that the first concern of
any government is actually to stay in
power. If feeding the people is a pre

requisite to keeping control, the gov
ernment will attempt to do so but as
we saw in Cambodia, terror is often
more effective than food.
Instead of choosing its allies on the
basis of "which country has more to
offer a poor, underdeveloped nation
in terms of markets, technology and
aid" as Kennedy indicates, the first
revolutionary government of El
Salvador would be likely to choose
the ally which is most interested in
helping it stay in power. The Soviet
Union, which has never been known
to include morality in its foreign poli
cy formulae, often proves to be a
more effective and dependable ally
in these terms.
While it is certain that we should
continue our support of El Salvador,
it less certain exactly what that sup
port should entail. Clearly, more
pressure must be exerted on the gov
ernment there to improve its human
rights record.
Equally alarming as the reports of
civilian massacre is the fact that
American military advisors are now
carrying their M-76's with them into
the field. In Vietnam, we learned that
it was impossible for one country to
fight successfully on behalf of one
side in another country's civil war.
Still, as difficult as it may seem mor
ally to commit our resources to a war
in which both the revolutionaries
and the establishment are guilty of
terrible atrocities, we must do so.
Any other choice, though perhaps
superficially more moral, will, in the
long run, bring even greater hard
ships upon the people and virtually
eliminate any chance for the desired
evolution toward democracy.

Instead of choosing its allies on the
basis of "which country has more to
offer a poor, underdeveloped nation
in terms of markets, technology and
aid" as Kennedy indicates, the first
revolutionary government of El
Salvador would be likely to choose
the ally which is most interested in
helping it stay in power. The Soviet
Union, which has never been known
to include morality in its foreign poli
cy formulae, often proves to be a
more effective and dependable ally
in these terms.
While it is certain that we should
continue our support of El Salvador,
it less certain exactly what that sup
port should entail. Clearly, more
pressure must be exerted on the gov
ernment there to improve its human
rights record.
Equally alarming as the reports of
civilian massacre is the fact that
American military advisors are now
carrying their M-76's with them into
the field. In Vietnam, we learned that
it was impossible for one country to
fight successfully on behalf of one
side in another country's civil war.
Still, as difficult as it may seem mor
ally to commit our resources to a war
in which both the revolutionaries
and the establishment are guilty of
terrible atrocities, we must do so.
Any other choice, though perhaps
superficially more moral, will, in the
long run, bring even greater hard
ships upon the people and virtually
eliminate any chance for the desired
evolution toward democracy.

While I appreciated Daily colum
nist joe Kennedy's attempt to justify
his "liberal" viewpoint on El Salvador
as both pragmatic and morally cor
rect (El Salvador: A liberal's ap
proach, Feb. 19), his arguments just
didn't hold up upon closer examina
tion. As much as he may feel that "the
time has come for liberals to start
arguing the practicality of morality,"
I, for one, hold that it is time for us all
to start arguing the morality of prac
f'Cfn'order to do this, we have to look
frankly at the current situation and
consider carefully the options open
to us. There is no choice to be made
between the way things are and the
way we would like them to be. Times
as they are, our options are limited
and, while we are sometimes forced
to choose the lesser evil rather than
the highest good, such a choice

proves to be more moral than the
"liberal" course of action which
often aims for an impractical higher
good and ends in an even greater
evil.
Kennedy claims that "the conser
vative argument draws its strength
from concerns for the military and
economic security of the United
States" and that the liberal stance
must be similarly based if it is to stand
a chance. I disagree.
It is the moral practicality of the
conservative argument which gives it
its strength. Granted, the govern
ment in El Salvador is little more than
a repressive military oligarchy but
sometimes a "little more" can make a
big difference. History offers us a
prime example (one which many lib
erals seem to have conveniently for
gotten) of what a "little more" has
done in Spain.
Not that long ago, Spain was em
broiled in a civil war which was even
tually lost by the leftist revolu
tionaries (much to the dismay of
high-minded intellectuals in Europe
and the United States). Although the
military strong-man who took con
trol of the country following the rev
olution sometimes employed op
pressive tactics and policies, he al
lowed many freedoms as well as lim
ited freedom of the press.
At that time, liberals complained
that General Francisco Franco's gov
ernment was "little more" than an
oppressive military dictatorship. To
day Spain has become one of the
most democratic and socialist
countries in Europe and not one shot
has been fired. The lesson is clear:
Spanish civil liberties were won
through evolution rather than revo
lution.

If liberty and democracy for the
people of El Salvador is our goal, we
cannot hope to obtain these ends
through revolution. Not once in the
history of man has communist-in
spired revolution led to the founda
tion of a democracy and there is no
reason to believe that the situation is
any different now.
Unfortunately, my liberal friends
prefer to deny the lessons of history
whenever these interfere with their
self-righteous concept of the higher
good. El Salvador's revolutionary
movement does have considerable
popular support and many leaders
who sincerely want the best for the
people of their country.
In order to keep control, the new
"peoples' government" would em
ploy the same Machiavelian
strategies they once opposed so vig
orously and the end would be even
less tolerable than conditions before
the revolution. Economic freedoms
would be eliminated, personal liber
ties (such as freedom of religion) lim
ited still more and the press would no
longer need to maintain even the
semblance of independence; it
would simply become another
branch of government.
The idea that we could withdraw
our support from El Salvador, ac
quiesing to "the forces of change,"
then form an economic alliance with
the victors is very appealing but at the
same time not credible. Kennedy
pinpoints the falacy of this argument
with hisstatement, "The first concern
of any government is to feed its peo
ple."
Although I wish that this were the
case, it seems that the first concern of
any government is actually to stay in
power. If feeding the people is a pre

requisite to keeping control, the gov
ernment will attempt to do so but as
we saw in Cambodia, terror is often
more effective than food.
