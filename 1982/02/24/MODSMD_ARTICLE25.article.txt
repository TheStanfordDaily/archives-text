## United States subsidy for murder 
### 
At least 9000 civilians were killed in
El Salvador in 1980, most by right
wing death squads associated with
official security forces. For 1981,
there isagreement amongtheCatho
lic Church of El Salvador, Amnesty In
ternational and the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights that
the figure went up to 12,000, with the
ruling junta responsible for about 80
percent.
This gives the lie to President
Konald Reagan's assertion that only
6000 were killed in 1981, which he
used as a pretext to justify his
certification to Congress on Jan. 28
that the junta is making progress in its
respect for human rights.
With that certification, $26 million
was freed for "aid" to El Salvador, in
addition to $55 million that Reagan
took from another fund not requir
ing Congressional approval.
CBS News has reported that he will
ask for as much as $800 million more
in the next 18 months, mostly for mili
tary equipment. (All of this is over
and above the Reagan adminis
tration's five-year $1.64 trillion pro
gram of military expansion.)
Such have been the bitter fruits of
our past aid to El Salvador's military
junta. Escalation of American com
mitment on the scale clearly con
templated by Reagan could have re
sults tantamount to genocide unless
enough angry Americans demand an
end to the slaughter. We have the
right and the responsibility: our
weapons (and our money to pay for
them) are being used in the
massacres that we now see pictures
of almost daily in the press and on tel
evision.
It is a total fiction that our heli
copters and machine guns, our
Green Beret-type "advisers" and the
special training courses we give the
Salvadoran military at Fort Brag rep
resent "aid" to the people of El
Salvador. By fundingthis blood-bath,
we are propping up an illegitimate

regime, providing it with the means
to murder its own population.
Even the original junta that seized
power in 1979 by deposing Gen.
Carlos Romero ("elected" in 1977 in
what was internationally recognized
as a fraudulent election and himself
responsible for the murder of hun
dreds of civilians) has vanished.
Its relatively moderate members,
sickened by the ruthless domination
of the new regime by ultra-conserva
tive military officers, have joined the
FDR (Democratic Revolutionary
Front) or sought refuge in other
countries (among them Col. Adolfo
Majano, whose eloquent appeal for a
negotiated settlement appeared in
the San Francisco Chronicle recent
ly).
Our help goes to a tiny dominant
fraction of the population, adamant
ly opposed to democracy, to eco
nomic justice, to truly free elections
and even to the pitifully inadequate
agrarian reforms supported by the
Carter administration.
With little more evidence than its
now totally discredited White Paper,
our State Department still clings to its
own myth that the struggle against
brutal regimes in Central America isa
"Communist" plot and that
Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet
Union are the architects of a situation
that has been brewing for decades.
Indeed, if there is any foreign
power that has contributed substan
tially to the woeful conditions in El
Salvador, it is the United States,
which under all our presidents since
Dwight Eisenhower, has sent military
missions there, supported a string of
military dictatorships and provided
their army and police with the weap
ons to do their despicable work.
Americans who are concerned
about the atrocities committed in
their name and with the resources
being provided by their government
should call upon their elected repre
sentatives in Congress to halt the
flow of arms and other military aid to

the junta. Two concrete actions are
under way that our congressmen can
be urged to join.
More than 80 congressmen, led by
Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) have
sponsored House Joint : Resolution
399 to nullify Reagan's certification
and suspend all military aid. Another
group led by Rep. George Crockett
(D-Mich.), are suing in federal courts
to end illegal military aid to El
Salvador. They need support.
The United States must stopfinanc
ing murder to stabilize the shabby
foreign regimes our politicians
foster. In El Salvador, the FDR repre
sents the country's best hopes.
Without overtly supporting that
coalition, however, we can at least
cut our ties with the Duarte regime
and encourage negotiations for
cessation of hostilities and the prepa
ration of genuine free elections.
Such elections cannot take place
now.
Those planned by the junta can be
only a theatrical performance.
Among other reasons (like intimida
tion of the population), the armed
forces have placed the entire leader
ship of the FDR on a "traitors list."
Understandably, the FDR have re
fused to participate in the elections
under those conditions. With dissen
ters shut out, what choice can there
be?
Majano writes: "Flections in my
country have set a terrible precedent
of fraud and death. The few who
have held power in collaboration
with the military have never allowed
the results of any honest election to
be implemented" (San Francisco
Chronic/e, Feb. 11).
there can be no honest elections
in El Salvador until President Jose
Duarte and his junta stop making war
against their own people. Withhold
ing the weapons he needs for that
unsavory enterprise is the kind of aid
the people of El Salvador really need.

At least 9000 civilians were killed in
El Salvador in 1980, most by right
wing death squads associated with
official security forces. For 1981,
there isagreement amongtheCatho
lic Church of El Salvador, Amnesty In
ternational and the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights that
the figure went up to 12,000, with the
ruling junta responsible for about 80
percent.
This gives the lie to President
Konald Reagan's assertion that only
6000 were killed in 1981, which he
used as a pretext to justify his
certification to Congress on Jan. 28
that the junta is making progress in its
respect for human rights.
With that certification, $26 million
was freed for "aid" to El Salvador, in
addition to $55 million that Reagan
took from another fund not requir
ing Congressional approval.
CBS News has reported that he will
ask for as much as $800 million more
in the next 18 months, mostly for mili
tary equipment. (All of this is over
and above the Reagan adminis
tration's five-year $1.64 trillion pro
gram of military expansion.)
Such have been the bitter fruits of
our past aid to El Salvador's military
junta. Escalation of American com
mitment on the scale clearly con
templated by Reagan could have re
sults tantamount to genocide unless
enough angry Americans demand an
end to the slaughter. We have the
right and the responsibility: our
weapons (and our money to pay for
them) are being used in the
massacres that we now see pictures
of almost daily in the press and on tel
evision.
It is a total fiction that our heli
copters and machine guns, our
Green Beret-type "advisers" and the
special training courses we give the
Salvadoran military at Fort Brag rep
resent "aid" to the people of El
Salvador. By fundingthis blood-bath,
we are propping up an illegitimate

regime, providing it with the means
to murder its own population.
Even the original junta that seized
power in 1979 by deposing Gen.
Carlos Romero ("elected" in 1977 in
what was internationally recognized
as a fraudulent election and himself
responsible for the murder of hun
dreds of civilians) has vanished.
Its relatively moderate members,
sickened by the ruthless domination
of the new regime by ultra-conserva
tive military officers, have joined the
FDR (Democratic Revolutionary
Front) or sought refuge in other
countries (among them Col. Adolfo
Majano, whose eloquent appeal for a
negotiated settlement appeared in
the San Francisco Chronicle recent
ly).
Our help goes to a tiny dominant
fraction of the population, adamant
ly opposed to democracy, to eco
nomic justice, to truly free elections
and even to the pitifully inadequate
agrarian reforms supported by the
Carter administration.
With little more evidence than its
now totally discredited White Paper,
our State Department still clings to its
own myth that the struggle against
brutal regimes in Central America isa
"Communist" plot and that
Nicaragua, Cuba and the Soviet
Union are the architects of a situation
that has been brewing for decades.
Indeed, if there is any foreign
power that has contributed substan
tially to the woeful conditions in El
Salvador, it is the United States,
which under all our presidents since
Dwight Eisenhower, has sent military
missions there, supported a string of
military dictatorships and provided
their army and police with the weap
ons to do their despicable work.
Americans who are concerned
about the atrocities committed in
their name and with the resources
being provided by their government
should call upon their elected repre
sentatives in Congress to halt the
flow of arms and other military aid to

the junta. Two concrete actions are
under way that our congressmen can
be urged to join.
