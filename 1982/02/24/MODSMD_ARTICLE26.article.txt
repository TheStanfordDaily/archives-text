One small step for Sooners
The University of Oklahoma news
paper is taking advantage of the tem
porary restraining order prohibiting state
action against newspaper and billboard
companies that carry liquor ads and has
begun accepting advertisements for hard
liquor, according to Collegiate Hedlines,
a weekly Wisconsin publication.
Oklahoma is the only state in the nation
which prohibits liquor-by-the-drink sales
statewide. Before the temporary restraint
was issued, the newspaper ran happy
hour ads from local restaurants which
function as "private clubs" for the
purpose of selling liquor by the drink. Af
ter the state law against advertising "in
toxicating beverages" other than 3.2 beer
was challenged in federal court by a
group of Oklahoma television stations,
resulting in the temporary restraint, The
Oklahoma Daily began securing liquor
advertising contracts.
Susan Sasso, assistant director of stu
dent publications at 0.U., said the paper
hopes to generate considerable revenue
through the sale of liquor ads.
Oklahoma State University in Stillwater
is not following the example of its rival in
Norman, however. The Daily
O'Collegian's board of directors voted to
continue accepting only beer ads. Leland
Tenney, adviser to the O'Collegian, said,
"I can't really speak for the entire board,
but I believe they felt we're just not ready
for liquor ads."
Too early to rise?
What's this world coming to? Next
thing you know they'll be scheduling 8
a.m. classes at Harvard — at least that's the
latest fear at the Stanford of the East. The

Harvard Crimson reports that a college
rule dating back to the 19th century
which prohibits courses from meeting
before 8:40 a.m., when chapel starts,
without express permission from the
dean of the college, will be waived next

year in an attempt to cope with the space
shortage caused by renovation work
planned for Harvard's largest classroom
building.
The Crimson reports that, while pro
fessors will not be forced to teach at speci
fied times, they are urged "to offer
courses at traditionally unpopular hours,
especially recommending 8 and 9 a.m.
sessions and 90-minute classes on Tues
day and Thursday." Take heart, Math 41
and Geo 1 — at least you don't get
frostbitten on the way to class.
Video games addicts!
The next time your friends and family
accuse you of wasting money, time and
energy "on those stupid games" tell them
you're simply following the example of
the Harvard video game wiz who made
good. The Harvard Crimson reports that a
sophomore, Thomas Hirschfeld, spent 10
hours every day for a month collecting
empirical data (playing video games)
before authoring the new bestseller Mas
ter the Video Games.
The book includes "seven steps to mas
tery" of the 30 most popular games and
gives specific advice on each game. There
is also a section on rhythm and hand-eye
coodination.
Hirschfeld reportedly spoke to many
expert players, including some who have
played the Asteroids game for more than
50 hours on one quarter. It took
Hirschfeld approximately two and a half
months to write the book, of which there
are 675,000 copies in print.

The author defended his favorite pas
time saying that video games develop re
flexes and coordination and "help people
get used to computers."
So you no longer have to feel guilty
when you stop by the Law School lounge
in between classes for a quick Pac Man fix
you can do it in the name of research,
or at the very least, to bone up on your
newly acquired Comp Sci 105 skills.

Snow never hurts anyone
Or does it? A University of Michigan re
searcher said he was surprised to find
such high acidity in the snow which fell
over Ann Arbor during a February 3
snowstorm. The Michigan Daily reports
that Perry Samson, assistant professor of
atmospheric and oceanic science, said
the snow samples were as acidic as the
"acid rain" that has killed fish and plants
in the Adirondack Mountains of New
York and Pennsylvania.
Samson said that Michigan's soil and
water should not suffer any lasting ill ef
fects from the snow because the relatively
basic soil and water in the state will neu
tralize the acidity. The professor plans to
further investigate his findings.
Crass is always greener
And, sun worshippers, if a weather
forecast of light showers and a low of 50
degrees sends you into deep depression,
try eating your granola over The Michi
gan Daily front page which promises
"UGLINESS — Winter storm watch today
and tonight. Cloudy with freezing rain,
mixed with sleet and light snow. High
near 30." So count your blessings as you
don your shorts and shades in February.
No free parking here
One Harvard student wants to give you
the opportunity to park, free of charge, in
the middle of Harvard Square. Sound sus
picious? You bet. His ad in The Harvard
Crimson includes the catch — the use of
your car. Bruce McMeekin's bargain offer
could prove to be the costliest experience
of your life. Remember Milton Friedman.
