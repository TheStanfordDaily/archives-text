# Career women offer job advice

### Rose Chan 
Calling on the people who are in posi
tions you would someday like to be in can
be intimidating or even impossible. An
"externship" program sponsored by the
Stanford Professional Women of Los An
geles County is striving to facilitate the
opening of these doors for students.
The program gives students the op
portunity to spend half a day to a day dur
ing spring break with an alumna in the
field they are considering for jobs or ca
reers.
"There's no pressure involved," said
Stanford alumna Nell Byrne, because the
women professionals will more likely be
the student's counterparts, rather than
potential employees. Through the pro
gram, students may find a professional
tthey can relate to and who can serve as a
Lnentor. According to Byrne, a significant
riumber of successful women have had
Inentors.
I "For those of us who have not had work
ing mothers, this is especially important,"
|he said. "All through life we have models
|>112 academicians, but we don't have
Ipiodels for professional women in the
working world. The whole idea of mentors
is very useful."
Byrne is a public relations representative
With the Los Angeles Times. While at Stan
ford, Byrne's major interest was in clinical

psychology.

school like this is there are too many
choices and too little guidance," Byrne

"There's a real desire to help students,"
Byrne said of the women's association.
"It's an accessible group. They're open
and warm, and giddy with success and with
how the group is going."
Established just three years ago by six
women, the group boastsalmost 300 mem
bers employed in numerous fields. The
women (and one man) represent Stanford
graduating classes from 1935 to 1981.
"They're definitely not your tea time
and white gloves type of ladies," said
Byrne. "There's real achievement going on
in this group." At the same time, Byrne
emphasized that the people who look
great don't always feel that way on the in
side, and that professionals enjoy giving
younger counterparts a hand.
Byrne described the groupas"terrifical
ly ambitious." The association sets up
scholarship funds for working people who
want to continue their education, holds
career workshops for members and rec
ommends women to positions on corpo
rate boards and government committees.
A study is currently being done on women
and careers.
"I really think it's important for people
to stop being shy and to make contacts,"
said Byrne. "Push every door open now.
Maybe five years down the line, you'll
come back to that person, even if you
don't now."
