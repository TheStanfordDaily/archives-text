# Student employment office explores internships
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Tucked away in the cramped back rooms
of the Stanford Career Planning and Place
ment Center, the University's Student Em
ployment Office (SEO) may at first seem in
significant.
Yet to the more than 3700 students esti
mated to use the SEO's services each year to
look for employment, the office can be of
great importance. Manydaysitstinyquarters
are packed with students, most of whom are
browsing through listings of more than 500
summer internships.
"Sometimes it gets to the point where
people are tripping over one another," ex
plained Hector Cuevas, director of the SEO.
"People even have to sit on the floor next to
the .wall."
Hgjwever, the SEO has not always enjoyed
such popularity. Cuevas said that the office
his*developed from a part-time job listing
service with one staff member into an in

ternship advising service with a staff of three
professional counselors.
"We've kind of outgrown this space," he
said. "Space is a problem for us but sup
posedly there is no other space on the Uni
versity (campus) for us to use," Cuevas said.
Cuevas and the other counselors, Lynne
Mason and Mary Wolf, schedule appoint
ments with about 15 students per week to of
fer advice on how to go about the job search
process. Resume and cover letter writing as
well as interviewing are explained in both
these individual appointments and group
workshops.
"Getting a summer job should not be dif
ficult if a person is willing to put in some
work," Cuevas said. "I think the majority of
the people who put in diligent effort trying
to get a summer job, and allow time for that,
will be successful.
"It's the equivalent of taking another
course if you put in the right amount of

time."
One occurrence that Cuevas said has sur
prised him is the number of younger stu
dents seeking internships. "Students are
more career-minded at an earlier age in their

'/ think the majority of the people who put in diligent
effort trying to get a summer job, and allow time for that,
will be successful. It's the equivalent of taking another
course if you put in the right amount of time/

academic career now," he said. "We're
seeing a lot more freshmen, and that's a new
phenomenon for us."
Locations of internships listed at the SEO
are varied, ranging from the Cincinnati Zoo
to Walt Disney Productions, from Rolling
Stone Magazine to the Smithsonian Institu
tion. Some offer salaries while others do not.
However, non-paying internships can often

be arranged for academic credit.
According to Cuevas the average in
ternship salary is $800 to $1000 per month.
Cuevas said that engineering and business
jobs usually offer the highest pay, while pub-

lie interest jobs often pay nothing.
"We have a policy that if the internship is
with a profit-making organization, we ask
them to pay a salary," he said. "We've actual
ly turned down companies because of this."
The most popular internships are in busi
ness, engineering and communications.
Cuevas said the office has attempted to re

spond this year to the increasing interest in
business internships by actively seeking
sponsors to offer positions.
Many companies, however, do not need
to be prodded to set up an internship. More
than 90 companies, mostly engineering and
technical firms, come on campus to specifi
cally recruit students for summer jobs,
Cuevas said.
The SEO has difficulty in trying to measure
how successful it has been in placing stu
dents in jobs. Even though the office sends
out surveys to students who used the service,
Cuevas reported that only about 20 percent
of the surveys are returned.
"We don't have time to track down stu
dents and to compile numbers," he said.
The most common complaint among stu
dents is that the SEO does not list enough
jobs in their hometowns, Cuevas said.
"More students are flexible now, though
and are willing to stay in the Bay Area or to go
to another state for a job."
