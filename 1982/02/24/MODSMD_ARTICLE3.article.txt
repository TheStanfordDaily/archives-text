Three scientists with connections to the University will
serve on the 13-member White House Science Council
created last week to aid Dr. George Keyworth, President
Ronald Reagan's adviser on technological issues.
Those scholars with a link to Stanford include: Dr. Ed
ward Teller, a senior research fellow in the Hoover In
stitution and the "father of the hydrogen bomb;" Dr.
David Packard, a 1934 graduate of Stanford who later co
founded the Palo Alto based Hewlett-Packard Company
and who currrently serves on the Board of Trustees; and
Richard Hunter, an alumnus of Stanford who is currently
president of the Western Research Company.
The panel will advise Keyworth on technology related
issues facing the nation. "They work directly for jay (Key
worth)," said Dr. Tom Johnson, special assistant to the
technical adviser.

Ability, scientific credentials, and "good, solid
judgement" were Keyworth's main criteria in selecting
the Council members, Johnson said. He described the
slate of corporate presidents, professors emeritus, and
research fellows as "all very distinguished people."
"I hope to contribute as much as I can . . . and a bit
more," said Teller, who is known for his work in nuclear
physics.
In creating the advisory group, the technical adviser
did not attempt to reflect the American scientific com
munity demographically, according to Johnson. How
ever, Johnson said, "We wanted to span the range of ex
pertise needed to deal with any national issue." He de
clined to predict the specific issues the Council will dis
cuss.
The Council will convene for the first time March 9. Af
ter that, it will meet "as often as necessary," but in any
case at least six times a year.
