## Men's tennis team beats San Diego in easy win 
### Sally Jenkins 
The University of San Diego
men's tennis team tasted a
Stanford upset for a few
minutes yesterday, but went
home the same way most of the
spectators did. Tired and hun
gry-
Stanford won five of six sin
gles matches — three of them
short, three long — and
waltzed off with a 6V2-2V2 vic
tory after splitting three mean
ingless doubles contests down
the middle.
Scott Davis barely fended off
boredom and beat Peter Her
rmann 6-4, 6-2 at No.l, Scott
Bondurant sliced through
Terry Ward 6-3, 6-2 at No. 2,
and John Corse whipped Eric
Steinbroner 6-2, 6-2 at No. 4.
But for a time San Diego gave
the Cardinal something to
think about. It was at singles
Nos. 3, 5 and 6 that the rough
spots showed, and they are
liable to be troubling question
marks for Stanford coach Dick
Gould all season long.
At No. 3, Jeff Arons broke
freshman lan Mclaughlin at 5-4
to win the first set, but
Mclaughlin returned the favor
at 4-4 in the second, then held
his own serve to win the set 6-4
and even it up.

Paul Robinson was even
tireder than Tye Ferdinandsen
at No. 6, dropping the first set
7-6, winning the second 6-4,
and folding like a chair 0-6 in
the third.
Meanwhile Mark McKeen
was getting lobbed to death by
Jay Massart at No. 5. He snuck
by him 7-5 in the first set but
lost the second 4-6, setting an
other three-set confrontation.
Arons' experience was too
much for Mclaughlin. The
Cardinal senior broke him
twice in the third set, once 4-0
with the help of two
Mclaughlin double faults to
give himself a 5-3 game edge.
But Mclaughlin broke back
when Arons missed three first
serves and double faulted
once, and suddenly he had to
break serve for a second time if
he wanted to get out of the set
anytime in the near future.
Which he did. Another
Mclaughlin double fault
helped him to a 3-1 lead, he
couldn't get a handle on the
next two serves to make it 3-3,
and then took the optic-yellow
fuzz off of a forehand passing
shot to break Mclaughlin and
lock away the final set.
Three courts away McKeen
was catching a second wind.

He and Massart both held serve
until 4-4, and then the Cardinal
seized an opportunity to break
when Massart's net game left
without him in spite of a 3-0
point edge.
Massart put a forehand half
volley in the net, McKeen
pulled out a gorgeous
backhand return and a lob that
Masart couldn't touch to make
it 3-3, and then the southerner
put yet another forehand vol
ley in the net to give McKeen
the crucial game. McKeen held
serve to make it 6-4 and the
Cardinal had a 5-1 route in the
singles.
In the doubles, Davis and
Arons ran over Herrmann and
Mclaughlin 6-3, 6-2, Jeremy
Semple and Karl Miller of Stan
ford lost to Ward and Eddie
Farrow 4-6, 2-6, and at No. 3
George Harding and Steve
Winterbauer fought Massart
and Pat Rea to a 7-6, 5-5 tie until
the match was called because
of darkness.

ARONS TURNS TIDE — Jeff Arons beat San Diego's lan
Mclaughlin 6-4,4-6,6-4 in a thrilling three set match yes
terday to give Stanford a clear edge after singles and an
eventual 6V2-2V2 win.
The University of San Diego
men's tennis team tasted a
Stanford upset for a few
minutes yesterday, but went
home the same way most of the
spectators did. Tired and hun
gry-
Stanford won five of six sin
gles matches — three of them
short, three long — and
waltzed off with a 6V2-2V2 vic
tory after splitting three mean
ingless doubles contests down
the middle.
Scott Davis barely fended off
boredom and beat Peter Her
rmann 6-4, 6-2 at No.l, Scott
Bondurant sliced through
Terry Ward 6-3, 6-2 at No. 2,
and John Corse whipped Eric
Steinbroner 6-2, 6-2 at No. 4.
But for a time San Diego gave
the Cardinal something to
think about. It was at singles
Nos. 3, 5 and 6 that the rough
spots showed, and they are
liable to be troubling question
marks for Stanford coach Dick
Gould all season long.
At No. 3, Jeff Arons broke
freshman lan Mclaughlin at 5-4
to win the first set, but
Mclaughlin returned the favor
at 4-4 in the second, then held
his own serve to win the set 6-4
and even it up.

Paul Robinson was even
tireder than Tye Ferdinandsen
at No. 6, dropping the first set
7-6, winning the second 6-4,
and folding like a chair 0-6 in
the third.
Meanwhile Mark McKeen
was getting lobbed to death by
Jay Massart at No. 5. He snuck
by him 7-5 in the first set but
lost the second 4-6, setting an
other three-set confrontation.
Arons' experience was too
much for Mclaughlin. The
Cardinal senior broke him
twice in the third set, once 4-0
with the help of two
Mclaughlin double faults to
give himself a 5-3 game edge.
But Mclaughlin broke back
when Arons missed three first
serves and double faulted
once, and suddenly he had to
break serve for a second time if
he wanted to get out of the set
anytime in the near future.
Which he did. Another
Mclaughlin double fault
helped him to a 3-1 lead, he
couldn't get a handle on the
next two serves to make it 3-3,
and then took the optic-yellow
fuzz off of a forehand passing
shot to break Mclaughlin and
lock away the final set.
Three courts away McKeen
was catching a second wind.

He and Massart both held serve
until 4-4, and then the Cardinal
seized an opportunity to break
when Massart's net game left
without him in spite of a 3-0
point edge.
Massart put a forehand half
volley in the net, McKeen
pulled out a gorgeous
backhand return and a lob that
Masart couldn't touch to make
it 3-3, and then the southerner
put yet another forehand vol
ley in the net to give McKeen
the crucial game. McKeen held
serve to make it 6-4 and the
Cardinal had a 5-1 route in the
singles.
In the doubles, Davis and
Arons ran over Herrmann and
Mclaughlin 6-3, 6-2, Jeremy
Semple and Karl Miller of Stan
ford lost to Ward and Eddie
Farrow 4-6, 2-6, and at No. 3
George Harding and Steve
Winterbauer fought Massart
and Pat Rea to a 7-6, 5-5 tie until
the match was called because
of darkness.
