# Card drubs Cal; looks to indoors
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Frank Brennan was a little
, uptight before yesterday's
women's tennis match at Cali
fornia.
•It was the first real test of his
-..team. A team phenomenal on
""paper, but that hadn't been
tested to see how good it really
• "was.
•San Diego cancelled its
Thursday match at Stanford
and Brennan didn't know if his
team would be prepared for
next week's National Indoor
Championships in Ann Arbor,
,(*Mich. "It's one of those un-
Bri f<yrtunate things," Stanford
coach Brennan said of the San
Diego move, "It was un
professional. If this kind of
thing happened in basketball
or football all sorts of things
would break loose."
•He was unveiling his top
; line-up for the first time all
year.
Brennan feels a lot better
now.
"It was a great day,"he said
after the Cardinal waltzed past
Cal 9-0 without dropping a set.
"I was a little worried before
the match."
Three-time All-America
Alycia Moulton set things in
motion breezing past Barrie
Bulmore 6-1, 6-2 in No. 1 sin
gles.
Elise Burgin followed suit

and buried Nina Bland 6-2, 7-5
at No. 2.
Freshman Kate Gompert
coasted by Vicki Corrales 6-0,
6-2; Linda Gates started slow
but shot past Wendy Driver 7-6,
6-0; Michelle Weiss beat Julie
Grummel 6-1, 6-4; and Caryn
Copeland blasted Stacy Savides
6-3, 6-0.
In the doubles, Moulton and
Copeland — defending na
tional champions — ripped
Corrales and Grummel 6-1,
6-3; Burgin-Gates beat
Bulmore-Bland 6-2, 6-1; and
Gompert-Weiss edged Hannah
Sommerville and Chris Breed
6-3, 6-4.
The most encouraging thing
Brennan saw in the rout was
that Cal is not a bad team.
"It's good that everyone
played well and beat good
players," Brennan said.
Stanford improved its record
to 4-0 and is now idle until the
indoor championships March
3-7.
"I can't complain about what
we did today," Brennan said,
"but the indoors are going to
be a big meet and now we
don't have our Thursday match
— that will hurt. But I guess we
looked pretty ready today.
