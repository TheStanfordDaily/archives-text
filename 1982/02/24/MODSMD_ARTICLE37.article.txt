Here's to those knights not always in shin
ing armor. You all saw TomWeiskopf'sfan on
the 16th hole in the Glen Campbell L.A. Open
Saturday, but did you catch Johnny Miller?
Miller called himself "the best frontrunner in
the game" and then bogeyed 17 and 18 Sun
day to drop into a tie with a charging Tom
Watson. The former Stanford golfer then
blasted out of traps to save par on the first two
sudden-death playoff holes before sinking a
40 foot birdie putt on the third to win the title
— his first of the year.

Here's a paradox for you. The Association
of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women
(AIAW) has been turned down in an attempt
to get a preliminary injuction levied against
the National Collegiate Athletic Association
to prohibit the NCAA from conducting wom
en's championships until a decision is ren
dered in AlAW's lawsuit charging the NCAA
with violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
Until this year, the NCAA dealt exclusively
with male sports while the AIAW governed
the women's athletics. Now the NCAA has
moved into the female arena causinga split in
the AlAW's member schools. (You may recall
two weeks ago when Stanford — No. 1,
NCAA — hosted Texas — No. 1, AIAW — in
women's swimming for a mythical cham
pionship meet.)
The AIAW charges that the NCAA is break
ing anti-trust legislation by breaking into
their monopoly of women's athletics.
Last week, Judge Charles Richey of the U.S.
District Court of the District of Columbia de
nied the motion for the preliminary injuc
tion.
AIAW President Merrily Baker said she will
appeal the decision and is "hopeful that the
U.S. Court of Appeals will act expeditiously in
reversing Judge Richey's ruling."

Last Sunday and Monday, Stanford tied the
University of Pacific for second place in the
team competition of the U.S. Intercollegiate
Golf Tournament at Stanford Golf Course
with a team total of 1108. UCLA won the 16-
team event with a 1089. UCLA's Cory Pavin
took medalist honors with a 211, just one
stroke off the tournament record. Stanford
was led by Doug Thompson who tied for sec
ond, four strokes off the pace.

Remember when Stanford's women's soc
cer team lost a scrimmage to Paly High to start
the season. They've since scored 23 points in
four games to storm out to a 4-0 mark. Stan
ford hosts Chico State Saturday at 2 p.m.

Freshman Barbara Baughman went the dis
tance, giving up only two runs Friday as Stan
ford beat Mission College in women's soft
ball 5-2. Another freshman, Melanie Chan,
provided the offense going 2 for 3 from the
plate and driving in a run.

Stanford women's lacrosse club hosts San
Jose Saturday at 11 a. m. at Roble Field. Stan
ford trounced Berkeley 16-4 last Saturday.
The women's rugby club suffered a rare
loss Saturday falling 12-0 to San Jose.

The men's lacrosse team is off to a roaring
start outscoring their opponents 35-5 in their
first two games for an undefeated mark.
□ □ □
The men's rugby team continued its quest
toward a national championship with a 40-0
shutout of the Santa Clara Broncos Saturday.
Stanford also picked up a big victory over
UCLA last week, but dropped alB-15 decision
to the University of British Columbia — the
Canadian Collegiate Champions.
