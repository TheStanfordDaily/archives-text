## New John Wooden 
### 
Larry Farmer came stroll
ing up the concrete steps
that flank Pauley Pavilion
looking more lawyer than
coach. Dapper in a tailored
blue blazer and tapered
grey slacks, he russled in a
pocket, rubbed his upper
lip, acknowledged some
"Hey Coach" catcalls and
* disappeared into the gym.
Farmer had a purposethat
day — a small purpose, but a
purpose nonetheless. His
team had to play Stanford.
Certainly the Cardinal, hap
less in the Pac-10 celler,
didn't pose the greatest of
threats to UCLA, but the
Bruins were riding an 11-
game win streak and they
hadn't had a 12-gamer in
four years — not since Gene
Bartow did it with the team
he inherited from john
Wooden.
The coach and his team
wanted this one. See, UCLA
hasn't settled down since
the "Wizard of Westwood"
left. Plagued by coaching
difficultiesandanother kind
of wizardry wrought by one
Sam Gilbert, the Bruins
needed Saturday's win and
the 12-game streak more
than ever. Farmer knew this.
And, still, it's all so
perfect.
UCLA might be on proba
tion for God knows how
long but the family's still to
gether. All a "Bruin
Booster" (and they are übi
quitous) need do is walk
into Pauley and look to the
rafters. There, 10 national
championship banners will
ripple slowly and soothingly
and whisper to him that ev
erything will be all right.
Larry knew this too, which
is why he walked into Pauley
like a man in the know, a
central cog in the nation's
most remarkable sporting
machine. The crux of the
matter is that he knows the
bad and the good. He's
been a member of the fami-

ly from way back as a player,
an assistant coach and now,
of course, as head coach.
Never truly outstanding
on the court, Farmer was,
nevertheless, the quitessen
tially Woodenesque player.
He was tireless, he hustled
and his teams won a lot —
89 out of 90 games. He was
that way as a recruiter too in
the interim years. Now he's
carried it over, ever so sub
tley, to the first seat on the
bench. With an 11-3 con
ference record in his first
year, he's sitting pretty.
We've yet to see if Farmer
will finally fill the void left by
Wooden, but it's a good bet
he will. I should say that he
looks likely to fill it suffi
ciently because nobody in
Westwood expects the
saviour's return so quickly.
But Farmer is just what the
doctor ordered. He knows
the Bruin diplomat role,
he's been a Bruin winner,
he's shown he is a good
coach and, most important
ly, he knows what the tradi
tion is all about. He even
married an old Bruin
cheerleader for christsake.
In the first half of the Stan
ford game, even though the
Cardinal led through most
of it, Farmer appeared con
cerned but never ruffled.
He knew about second halfs
in Pauley. Even when Stan
ford came out of the locker
room looking tough,
Farmer was cool.
Then it happened. UCLA
went on an eight-point run
five minutes into the half
and the entire pavilion went
nuts. It wasn't just the stu
dents, though they started ii
with a cheer-screaming pyr
amid in the stands, it wasthi
hangers-on — the West
wood bandwagon.
They love it, bad press oi
no press, and they like Larrv
Farmer. They forget about
Sam Gilbert and all that
abortion stuff and the tradi
tion lives on.

less in the Pac-10 celler,
didn't pose the greatest of
threats to UCLA, but the
Bruins were riding an 11-
game win streak and they
hadn't had a 12-gamer in
four years — not since Gene
Bartow did it with the team
he inherited from john
Wooden.
The coach and his team
wanted this one. See, UCLA
hasn't settled down since
the "Wizard of Westwood"
left. Plagued by coaching
difficultiesandanother kind
of wizardry wrought by one
Sam Gilbert, the Bruins
needed Saturday's win and
the 12-game streak more
than ever. Farmer knew this.
And, still, it's all so
perfect.
UCLA might be on proba
tion for God knows how
long but the family's still to
gether. All a "Bruin
Booster" (and they are übi
quitous) need do is walk
into Pauley and look to the
rafters. There, 10 national
championship banners will
ripple slowly and soothingly
and whisper to him that ev
erything will be all right.
Larry knew this too, which
is why he walked into Pauley
like a man in the know, a
central cog in the nation's
most remarkable sporting
machine. The crux of the
matter is that he knows the
bad and the good. He's
been a member of the fami-

ly from way back as a player,
an assistant coach and now,
of course, as head coach.
Never truly outstanding
on the court, Farmer was,
nevertheless, the quitessen
tially Woodenesque player.
He was tireless, he hustled
and his teams won a lot —
89 out of 90 games. He was
that way as a recruiter too in
the interim years. Now he's
carried it over, ever so sub
tley, to the first seat on the
bench. With an 11-3 con
ference record in his first
year, he's sitting pretty.
We've yet to see if Farmer
will finally fill the void left by
Wooden, but it's a good bet
he will. I should say that he
looks likely to fill it suffi
ciently because nobody in
Westwood expects the
saviour's return so quickly.
But Farmer is just what the
doctor ordered. He knows
the Bruin diplomat role,
he's been a Bruin winner,
he's shown he is a good
coach and, most important
ly, he knows what the tradi
tion is all about. He even
married an old Bruin
cheerleader for christsake.
In the first half of the Stan
ford game, even though the
Cardinal led through most
of it, Farmer appeared con
cerned but never ruffled.
He knew about second halfs
in Pauley. Even when Stan
ford came out of the locker
room looking tough,
Farmer was cool.
Then it happened. UCLA
went on an eight-point run
five minutes into the half
and the entire pavilion went
nuts. It wasn't just the stu
dents, though they started ii
with a cheer-screaming pyr
amid in the stands, it wasthi
hangers-on — the West
wood bandwagon.
They love it, bad press oi
no press, and they like Larrv
Farmer. They forget about
Sam Gilbert and all that
abortion stuff and the tradi
tion lives on.
