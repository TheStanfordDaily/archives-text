# Card to play Bulldogs
## 
### Sarah Carrel 
On Thursday night the
Cardinal women's basketball
team faces Fresno State on the
road. Stanford beat the Lady
Bulldogs earlier in the season
77-70 without high-scoring
senior forward Louise Smith in
the lineup.
With Smith back, things look
good for Stanford, although
head coach Dotty McCrea ad
mits, "It's tough on the road."
If Stanford wins this game

â€¢and their final regular season
game against the University of
San Francisco, it will gain a spot
in the NCAA regional playoffs
to be held here in Maples Pavil
ion.
The Cardinal's Northern Cal
ifornia Athletic Conference
record is now 7-3.
"The last two games are very
important," McCrea said.
However, with the most tal
ented Stanford team in years,
the playoffs are easily within
reach.
