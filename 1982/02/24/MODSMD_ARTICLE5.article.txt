# Vidal raps Reagan
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Lambasting President Ronald Rea
gan because "he doesn't know the
difference between the Medici and
Gucci — except that his wife wears
something made by one of them,"
Gore Vidal presented his self-styled
"state of the Union address" to a
turn-away crowd at Kresge
Auditorium last night.
Vidal spent almost the entire
speech criticizing Reagan adminis
tration policy and the Republican
president himself with witticisms
characteristic of the books and essays
which have brought him national ac
claim.
He spent no time discussing his
works, however, except in respond
ing to questions from the audience
which, although it more than filled
available seating, was smaller than
past Kresge crowds. More than 30
people were turned away because of
room capacity regulations imposed
by the fire marshall.
Vidal, 56, also confirmed to the
largely supportive audience that he
will run for the U.S. Senate seat now
held by Republican S.I Hayakawa,
and outlined the political platform
on which he will base his campaign.
Vidal said, "I think I will win" the
election.
Ironically, Bill Chase, an assistant
dean of humanitiesandscienceswho
introduced Vidal last night, quoted
Vidal as writing: "I'm a pessimist who
triestoact like an optimist. It is better
to be futile than passive."
Vidal, who in 1960 ran as a Demo
crat for the Congressional seat in
New York's 29th Congressial District
and was between 1968 and 1972 ac
tive in the Peace and Freedom Party,
offered to "get the government off
our fronts" with a variety of pro
posals.
Claiming that modern society is
"paternalistic," Vidal posited the
elimination of all victimless crimes
which take up 50 percent of the po

lice force's time according to Vidal.
"We should dismantle our pater
nalistic society in favor of a grown-up
society," he said.
He also proposed radical changes
in the present tax structure, offering
a uniform 10 percent tax for all indi
viduals and a large tax on organized
religion. However, he shied away
from attempting to tax large corpo
rations, which, he said, control the
country.
Vidal spent a large amount of time
giving his view of the economic and
military history of the United States
which he said has been altered by the

rulers who control what is taught in
school.
Saying that the United States has
continally been at war since World
War 11, he proposed 25 percent cuts
in defense spending. He also said that
the country should halt its increasing
ly militaristic policies, which "will
end in nuclear war or the economic
collapse of the United States."
Vidal also decried the revival of the
peacetime draft, which he says will
lead to "enslavement of the young."
"The rnaintanence of a large land
army today is useless unless we use it
to fight in Nicaragua or El Salvador,"
he said.
Vidal especially attacked Reagan
administration military policy.
"The United States has become the


Gore Vidal
Clark Kent of the world — we are
going back to the phone booth now.
Vice President (George) Bush said re
cently that we can survive a nuclear
war... he has managed to psych out
two-thirds of the population who
now believe in the inevitability of
war," he said.
Vidal ended with a quotation from
Bertrand Russell, a English concien
tious objector to World War I.
" 'Life, not death, is the source of
all good,' " Vidal quoted.
