# Reporter 'prepared to go to jail' for contempt
## 
### Carolyn Lumsden 
A reporter for the San Jose Mercury may face ar
rest in two weeks if he refuses to answer certain
questions about a murder case that has shocked
the nation.
The San Jose municipal court found reporter
Glenn Bunting in contempt yesterday for
withholding information on Anthony Jacques
Broussard, a Milpitas youth charged with the rape
and Nov. 3 murder of a14-year-old girl.
Judge Wayne Kanemoto gave Bunting two
weeks to appeal the ruling.
Bunting, a recent graduate of the communica
tions department here, repeated to the court what
he had already reported — that Ron Matz, a
classmate of Broussard's, overheard the youth

boasting about the murder. (Matz denied the
statement before the court on Monday.)
When the district attorney probed for details
that may be crucial in establishing whether
Broussard raped his young victim, the reporter
balked, claiming that was privileged information.
"He wants to know who else was there (when
Matz made his statement), and I'mnotgoingtoan
swer that," Bunting said after the hearing, which
was closed to the public.
"I am prepared to go to jail," the reporter de
clared during a court recess, shortly before return
ing for further questioning, which, he joked, was
"likely to stack contempt upon contempt." But he
added that he was "relieved" at the court's com
promise decision, which leaves him free until the
appellate court hands down its ruling.

The Broussard case attracted national attention
because at least eight Milpitas High School stu
dents were shown the corpse and not one re
ported the murder to the police.
Two days after the murder, according to Bunt
ing's account, rumors about the body reached a
worker at a nearby assembly plant, who found it
and notified authorities.
Police are holding two of Broussard's classmates
as accessories to murder.
Mark Fowlkes, 17, was arrested last Thursday at
Milpitas High Schoolon chargesthat he led several
expeditions to view the body.
Kirk Rasmussen,l6, was sentenced in January to
the California Youth Authority for covering the
victim's partly clad body with leaves.
