# Distributor's mistake causes 'flick' foul-up
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Two unrelated corporate errors —
a company bankruptcy and failure of
a film to arrive on time — have
caused a rearrangement of the Sun
day flicks schedule. For Your Eyes
Only, originally scheduled for last
Sunday, will be shown this Sunday
and The First Monday in Ocfoberwill
be dropped from the schedule alto
gether.
Moviegoers were in for a surprise
last Sunday when they discovered
that the James Bond movie they had
come to see had been replaced by
Kentucky Fried Movie.
The reason for the last minute
switch, according to ASSU Sunday
Flicks Manager Brian Boorstein, was
the failure of the company that dis
tributes the film to send it on the cor
rect date.

In order to assuage patrons' disap
pointment, Boorstein decided not to
charge admission for the substitute
film.
The mix-up cost the ASSU an esti
mated $650 in promotional and other
expenses and took an unknown toll
in lost profits.
Although the Flicks don't always
make money, Boorstein said he had
estimated that the popularity of
James Bond films would have drawn
enough people to turn a profit. Rev
enues for the Sunday Flicks are de
termined by the number of tickets
sold.
Boorstein said he did not find out
about the mix-upuntil6p.m. on Sun
day, at which point he considered
several options before obtaining Sat
urday night's Chapparal film and re
showing it. Chapparal will be paid
$200 for the use of the film, he said.
Among the options Boorstein con
sidered were not showing a film or
postponing the Bond movie until
Monday. "It bothered me more to
cancel the flicks than to lose the
money," he said, adding that the
purpose of the Flicks was to provide
"good and cheap" entertainment —
not to make money.
Boorstein said he learned last Fri
day that The First Monday in October
would not be sent here because the
company that distributes it, Audio-
Branden, has gone bankrupt. The
company which assumed ownership
discovered that no prints of the film
had been made.
The Flicks is considering a refund
to season ticket holders for the 60
cent cost of the missed film for sea
son ticket holders who contact
Boorstein, he said.
"The bureacratic tape will hardly
be worth the monetary value,"
Boorstein said.
