# Inside: FAO: Stanford affordable for all

The University will continue to
meet the demonstrated need of
all admitted applicants, said Dr.
Robert Huff, director of financial
aid, and will continue itsaid-blind
admissions policy.
He made these remarks to allay
growing student concerns that
Stanford tuition is no longer af
fordable. In spite of this official
statement, one student worker at
the Financial Aid Office (FAO)
said there is evidence to the con
trary. "I've heard of so many cases
where the need is not met," the
worker said.
Saying they cannot afford a
Stanford education, some transfer
to less expensive schools, though
most eventually return to obtain a
Stanford degree.
However, Huff said there is no
evidence students are transferring
to less expensive schools in signifi
cant numbers.
The Credit Evaluations Office
has reported a "marked increase"
since 1974 in the number of units
students transfer towards a Stan
ford degree. This increase could
reflect a rise in the number of stu
dents leaving Stanford to save
money and then returning to
graduate, according to Laurie
Pollock, credit evaluations office
supervisor.
"I can't say this increase is only
because of finances," she said,
"but in my opinion, I would think
it's primarily because of tuition in
creases."
Registrar Sally Mahoney, on the
other hand, said there is no evi
dence of an increase in the
number of students leaving Stan
ford because they cannot afford

tuition. "There's a lot of talk, but
it's not really happening," she
said. In fact, she said students may
be relatively better off here be
cause of Stanford's com
prehensive aid program.
Some students say they are
caught in the middle: their pa
rents' income is too high for them
to receive financial aid, yet too
low for them to afford tuition,
room and board costs.
"We've tried to provide re
sources to deal with those kind of
situations," Huff said. "I know
from the standpoint of a parent
with a daughter in college, it's not
easy to meet costs."
Huff said students from middle
class families are still coming to
Stanford in the same ratio as pre
vious years. "The evidence sug
gests that the acceptance rate
across the income span has been
constant."

Losing students to less ex
pensive universities has not been
a serious problem for Stanford,
according to Huff. "The students
that we do lose tend to be going to
other institutions similar in costs
to Stanford," he said.
The FAO relies on parents to
contribute a certain amount of
money to their child's education,
depending on income, assets, and
family size. For example, parents
earning $28,000 a year for a family
of four with $30,000 in assets are
expected to contribute $2150.
The formula used by the FAO is
not rigid, Huff said. "We always
look at what the parents say they
can contribute," he said. "It's our
responsibility to figure out some
way to close that gap."
Assistant Director Vincent De
Anda, however, said the FAO has
to expect parents to contribute
significantly. "If we would allow
parents to contribute what they
wanted to contribute we couldn't
afford it,"he said.
Stanford is one of only a dozen
or so universities still able to ac
cept students regardless of their
financial background. Recently,
Wesleyan University was forced to
give up its aid-blind policy.
Even undertheaid-blind policy,
the FAO relies on students to con
tribute at least 25 percent of the
total costs of attending Stanford
through self-help. The self-help
portion of an aid package usually
includes about $1450 in loans and
$1350 in work earnings during the
school year.
The FAO usually expects stu
dents to work 10 hours a week, ac
cording to De Anda. "That seems
reasonable to me," he said. If the
student feels it is unreasonable,
often the FAO can increase the
loan portion of the self-help con
tribution to compensate for the
diminished job earnings, he said, j
