# Burmese forces fight opium warlord
## 
### Washington Post 
Rangoon, Burma — In an effort to capi
talizeon recent Thai military strikesagainst
the Golden Triangle's leading opium war
lord, the Burmese army has sent three
troop battalions to attack the drug king
pin's rebel force in the rugged mountains
of eastern Burma, according to diplomats
and Burmese sources.
The Burmese operation threatens to dis
rupt further the opium and heroin traffick
ing activities of the Shan United Army, a
Burmese rebel group led by Chang Chi-fu,
who is regarded by the U.S. Drug Enforce
ment Administration as the world's biggest
narcotics dealer.
However, the splintering of the group of

rebel Shan tribesmen, some foreign and
Burmese sources fear, could also con
tribute to the growing involvement in the
drug trade of the Burmese Communist Par
ty, which is supported by China and is the
biggest armed group battling the Burmese
government.
The Thai attack on a Shan United Army
stronghold in a Thai village deeply grat
ified Burmese authorities, who had been
soured by years of Thai inaction, the
sources said.
Now the two sides are showing signs of
dropping their longstanding mutual suspi
cions and moving toward some coordi

nated military action against the drug traf
ficking "armies" that also ostensibly seek
independence from Burma for their
tribesmen. The fertile Golden Triangle
drug-growing area also includes some Lao
tian territory.
Thailand is preparing to send a high
level team of narcotics officials to Rangoon
early next month to confer with their
Burmese counterparts and "try to coordi
nate some sort of action," a well-informed
Western official said. The United States has
long encouraged this sort of cooperation,
but the Burmese in the past have sus
pected corrupt Thai officials of leaking
word about impending anti-narcotics op
erations to the traffickers.
