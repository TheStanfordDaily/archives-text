## Hot air building in Congress over Clean Air Act renewal 
### Anne Larson 
Controversial proposed re
visions to the Clean Air Act are
sparking a flurry of con
gressional debate, as all sides
gear up for what many regard
as the first major environmen
tal battle to test the Reagan ad
ministration's commitment to
regulatory reform.
First passed in 1963, the
Clean Air Act provides the
basis for federal, state and local
efforts to combat air pollution.
The Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) is in charge of the
federal effort and establishes
basic goals and objectives for
the clean-up.
The Clean Air Act was
amended in 1966, 1970 and
1977. Considered a landmark
victory for environmentalists,
the 1970 legislation set strict na
tional ambient air quality stan
dards for several pollutants and
left the states the responsibility
of developing implementation
plans (SIPs) that specified how
each state would achieve the
standards.
The 1970 act also instigated a
10-year review and re
authorization period. In Sep
tember 1981, while the law
itself did not actually expire,
congressional authority to ap
propriate funds for its adminis
tration ended until Congress
reauthorizes the present or an
amended Clean Air Act.
The present melee is over a
bipartisan bill, H.R. 5252, sup

ported by the Reagan adminis
tration and the EPA. "We hope
that this bill will alleviate the
serious concerns of our friends
in the environmentalorganiza
tions who have expressed fears
that changes that Congress
may make to the law would be
too extensive," said Rep.
Thomas Luken (D-Ohio), one
of the bill's sponsors.
However, a spokesperson
for the National Clean Air
Coalition (NCAC) said "the
sponsorsof H.R. 5252claimthat
it is a moderate bill, a com
promise, but it's not. It is ex
treme and ignores some prob
lems, such as acid rain and toxic
pollutants, totally."
Part of the disagreement
concerns how the Clean Air
Act should be enforced:
whether or not there should be
compliance deadlines and
penalties, and whether author
ity should be located at the fed
eral or at the state level.
H.R. 5252 proposes ex
tensions of deadlines for meet
ing air pollutant standards,
elimination of sanctions for
non-compliance, and an in
crease in state authority.
According to Jerrie Hen
nessey of the American Lung
Association, "it would betragic
for more power to be given to
the states. So many industries
are national, and air travels
from state to state."
Jeff Gabe of Citizens for a
Better Environment (CBE)

agreed. "The states had the au
thority in the past and did not
do what was necessary to meet
the standards," he said. Cali
fornia would suffer particular
ly, Gabe said, because in
dustries would move to states
where the standards were less
stringent. "Because of com
petition for economic de
velopment, California would
have to relax its standards," he
said.
Industry groups believe that
state and regional authority
would make enforcement
more appropriate to each area.
Smaller local penalties would
serve as effective warnings that
non-compliance might result
in federal action.
Another major area of con
troversy is the Prevention of
Significant Deterioration (PSD)
program. The confusion and
administrative red tape gener
ated by this program has
caused all sides to recommend
some changes.
The program is based on an
increment system that allows a
different specified increase in
total pollution above existing
levels in each of the three clas
sified areas (Class 1 being the
most protected — national
parks and wilderness areas —
and Class 3 being the most in
dustrial). H.R. 5252 would
eliminate the increment sys
tem for Class 2 and 3 areas.
Business interests fear that
the PSD program will block de

velopment in areas that cur
rently have good air quality.
Environmentalists say that the
increment system will simply
cause development to proceed
more slowly, allowing more in
dustries in the long run be
cause of improvements in con
trol technology.
According to Steve Hellem
of the National Environmental
Development Agency (NEDA),
the increments are not neces
sary. "It's not the increments
that made the system (of clean
ing up the air) work; it's clearly
the technology," Hellem said.
The regulation of mobile
sources of air pollution (prima
rily automobiles) isalso a major
battleground. The automobile
industry wants emissions stan
dards made less stringent,
claiming that the costs greatly
outweigh the benefits. In H.R.
5252, both the carbon monox
ide (CO) and the oxides of ni
trogen (NOx) standards are
doubled, meaning that twice
the maximum levels now man
dated to be necessary to pro
tect human health would be to
lerated.
The auto industry claims that
relaxing emission standards
will reduce costs to the con
sumer. Stan Hall, manager of
new product publicityfor Gen
eral Motors, said "(The tighter
standards) are not necessary
anywhere except maybe in Los
Angeles."
But according to the NCAC
and the Manufacturers of
Emission Controls Association,
the more stringent CO stan
dard is necessary to clean up
heavily polluted areas. Since
most 1981 cars already meet the
tighter standard, Detroit can
no longer claim, as it has in oth
er clean air debates, that the
technology does not exist.
Some states with severe CO
and/or NOx problems, particu
larly Colorado and California,
fear that weakening these stan
dards would require tightening
of the stationary source stan
dards to compensate.
"H.R. 5252 would effect Cali
fornia's ability to set and en
force its own vehicle emissions
standards," according to Gabe.
It would allow California to set
different standards for
tailpipes, "but the tailpipe is
only a small part. There is also
testing, certification, and en
forcement, which H.R. 5252
would not allow, meaning that
California would have to rely
on the EPA," Gabe said.
In one major compromise to
environmentalists and strong
public sentiment, H.R. 5252

does not cripple the concept of
the national ambient air quality
standards, although NEDA and
others have claimed that the
standards are not scientifically
based or accurate enough to
merit their stringency and cost
liness.
According to Hellem, "We at
NEDA genuinely believe that
we can continue to reach clean

California would suffer particularly
because industries would move to states
where the standards were less stringent.
'Because of competition for economic
development, California would have to
relax its standards/
— Jeff Gabe, Citizens for a Better
Environment

air goals and also obtain eco
nomic payoffs. We very firmly
believe in that."
"The American Lung As
sociation's major target is to
maintain the NAAQS," accord
ing to Hennessey. "The prima
ry standards must be set to pro
tect the health of all population
groups."
"Nothing in H.R. 5252 is
going to keep people from
meeting the NAAQS," Hall
said. "Nobody isgoing to reach
them by the present deadlines
anyway, but I don't think
there's anybody right now
dying in the streets because of
air pollution," he said.

According to Gabe, "Basical
ly (H.R. 5252) is saying that the
federal government is just
going to look the other way. It
keeps the health-based stan
dards but eliminates every
means of achieving and main
taining those standards."
A further point of conten
tion is acid rain, and stems from
disagreement about whether

to take immediate action or to
continue with research until
the problem is better under
stood. Acid rain is a general
term for the phenomenon of
certain gaseous pollutants
being converted in the at
mosphere to corrosive acids
that contaminate the rain.
According to Myron Uman
of the National Academy of
Science, the NAS recently con
ducted research on acid rain,
and their report concluded
that the only way to save a
number of waterways in the
northern United States from ir
reversible damage is by retro
fitting existing industrial and

power plants with control
technology to reduce
emissions of gases such as sul
fur oxides (SOx).
"Once lake ecosystems go,
you're not going to be able to
retrieve them," Uman said.
However, Hall said "I do not
think we know enough to sup
port draconian measures to
deal with acid rain."
On toxic pollutants, there is
disagreement over who should
have the authority to decide
which air pollutants are haz
ardous and how they should be
regulated. H.R. 5252 does not
propose any major changes in
the present system.
But according to Hennessey,
"the existing process has been
ineffective. We support the ad
dition of strengthening
amendments which would fa
cilitate the EPA's ability to con
trol toxic substances."
Uman and representatives
from General Motors, the
American Lung Association,
the United Steelworkers, the
Sierra Club, the EPA, the Na
tional Clean Air Coalition,
ARCO, and other involved or
ganizations will be coming to
Stanford for a week-long sym
posium on the act next week,
March 1-4.
Sponsored by Stanford for
Environmental Education and
the University Public Policy
Symposium Committee, the
five programs are intended to
bring a broad range of per
spectives on the act to the Stan
ford community.
