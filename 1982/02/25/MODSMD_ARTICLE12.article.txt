## Viewpoint/Joe Walder Coping with nuclear disaster 
### 
"Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction.
Their various effects may cover vast areas and the de
struction of the intended target, whether civilian or mili
tary, can be made as complete as desired through the
choice of weapon yield and the point of explosion.
There is therefore no target strong enough to resist the
intense effects of nuclear weapons. Protection in nuclear
war, when it exists, does so because of limits imposed on
the strength of the attack. In this sense, mankind is faced
with the ultimate weapon." — Nuclear Weapons: Re
port of the Secretary General of the United Nations.
On Jan. 15, KQED-TV began a six week series on nucle
ar weapons with the film The Last Epidemic, in which
physicians describe the medical consequences of nucle
ar war. In the discussion afterward, an assistant director
of the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons lab, Dr.
Joseph Landauer, nervously denounced the film as "un
informative" — a patently false statement — and
"ghoulish." Landauer is wrong on both counts. The film
did inform, and it is the prospect of a nuclear war, not the
film, that is ghoulish. Using Landauer's line of reasoning,
we should condemn as a "ghoul" the physician who
warns his patient to quit smoking lest the patient develop
lung cancer. Perhaps Landauer needs to come to grips
with the intrinsic immorality of the job he has chosen to
perform.
The Soviet leadership has repeatedly stated that the
use of nuclear weapons, even at the battlefield level,
would inevitably lead to full-scale nuclear war, with de
struction of the United States, the Soviet Union and Eu
rope. Nonetheless, Teller insists upon a policy of first use
of nuclear weapons if Western Europe is attacked by the
Warsaw Pact nations.
This hardly sounds logical to me. Could Teller's
judgment here be guided (perish the thought) by emo
tion? Could his apparent hatred for the Russian oc
cupiers of the land of his birth color his judgment? Could
it be that those emotional, fearful Europeans opposed to
new missile deployment are the supremely rational
ones?
President Ronald Reagan recently announced his in
tention to seek approximately $10 billion to prepare for
so-called civil defense against nuclear attack. The plan
calls for hardening of industrial sites, blast shelters for
"key industrial workers,"and evacuation of urban popu
lations.
The notion that urban populations could be protected
or "saved" by mass evacuation is a complete and cruel
hoax. The Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), which is in the habit of preparing upbeat ap
praisals of its ability to cope with disaster, acknowledged
in Congressional hearings that it would take many weeks
to evacuate the millions of people covered in the plans.
(How would that protect from surprise attack?) The tech
nical problems of providing shelter, food, water, sani
tation and health care for these millions are mind-boggl
ing. In any case, would the populace willingly comply
with orders that could only mean that the President ac
tually intended to "fight" a nuclear war? It seems likely
that revolt would occur, in which case the "protectors of
democracy" would have to resort to police state tactics
to restore order.
Local disaster planners are as hopelessly deluded as
the president on the subject of "civil defense" from nu
clear blasts. Dan Allen, assistant emergency services co
ordinator for Santa Clara County, was quoted in the Jan.
16 Peninsula Times Tribune as saying, "If the Soviets un
leashed everything they have, it might affect five percent

of our geographic area." Allen is clearly unaware of stud
ies showing that such an attack would destroy about half
of all cropland through radioisotope contamination, in
addition to the hundreds of thousands of square miles
directly affected by fire and blast. The U.S. Forest Service
estimated in 1961, that a minimum of five percent of the
land area of the United States (about 140,000 square
miles) would simply burn after nuclear attack. Consider
ing Allen's total unfamiliarity with the relevant studies, I
suggest that he admit his ignorance and submit his resig
nation.
William Chapman, head of FEMA's civil defense
division, has some interesting notions about the state of
medical care available after nuclear attack. He suggests
(Daily, Jan. 18) that in the predicted nearly total absence
of doctors, nurses, hospitals, drugs, blood plasma, respi
rators ... that "people would have to help each other
during the emergency" by use of first aid. This must be
what the president had in mind when he mentioned the
"spirit of volunteerism." I suppose that Chapman will
also have enough foresight to distribute to the citizenry
gauze pads, adhesive tape, Vaseline and aspirin for the
millions of third degree burn victims. That should suf
fice, considering that we've got Yankee ingenuity and
God on our side.
T.K. Jones, recently of Boeing Corp. and now a deputy
undersecretary of defense, maintains (Daily, Jan. 18) that
U.S. recovery from nuclear war would be complete
within "two to four years." Jones is clearly ignorant of
the fact that strontium 90 contamination of cropland
would render such land useless for farming for decades
... unless, of course, the survivors didn't mind getting
bone cancer in addition to the other cancers caused by
shorter term radiation hazards.
As for industrial recovery, Jones is well-known for his
proposals to dismantle and bury industrial equipment,
so as to be able to unearth it after nuclear war and 're
build.' (Isn't capitalism a remarkably flexible system?)
One might ask how the unearthing process is to be ac
complished, as that process itself would presumably re
quire large amounts of heavy equipment and fuel. Of
course, it may be that shovels and slave labor are what
Jones has in mind for this particularly prickly aspect of his
"solution."
Does it seem alarming that suddenly, governmental
representatives at all levels have begun to speak of "sur
viving" and "winning" nuclear war? That we are hearing
another round of blandishment about our supposed
ability to rise Phoenix-like from a nuclear holocaust?
That the head of the U.S. arms negotiating team wanted
to stall the beginning of the Geneva talks? That our "civil
defense" planners are grossly ignorant of important
studies about the actual effects of nuclear attacks? That
the president of the United States, that mythical protec
tor of freedom and peace, speaks openly about "lim
ited" nuclear war?
Are these so-called leaders of our nation pragmatists,
truly concerned about the welfare of the populace? I
rather think that they have blinded themselves to the ac
tual dangers of nuclear war and have committed the un
forgivable act of consciously deluding the public into be
lieving that nuclear war is some sort of game. These men
(I have yet to read or hear of any female "nuclear war
riors") pose a greater danger to the survival of the United
States as a viable nation than do all the "Communists,"
"domestic and international terrorists," "foreign hit
squads," "environmental exremists," and the other
scapegoats we have had foisted upon us.
