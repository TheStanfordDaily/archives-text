## Reverse discrimination vs. merits 
### 
Three weeks ago, I saw a film of
Martin Luther King saying, "I dream
of a world where people are judged
not by the color of their skin but by
the content of their character."
We all dream of a world where ra
cial discrimination is non-existent. To
me, the only valid goal of a "civil
rights activist" is to create a world
where race does not matter, where a
person's character and not his race
determine his place in society. So, I
find the actions of King's successors
particularly puzzling. Today, civil
rights leaders advocate policies
which do violence to King's dream.
Affirmative action in employment
and education sanctions precisely
what King abhorred — discrimina
tion based on race, not merit.
Now I have to admit to some per
sonal biasagainst affirmative action. I
believe that those hurt most by af
firmative action are lower-income
white males whose ancestors may
have had to deal with private sector
discrimination in their time. I re
member my great-grandfather re
counting his arrival in America in the
late nineteenth century. He and his
relatives were greeted with signs that
read "No Irish" or "Irish need not ap
ply." With the name Quinn, he had a
wonderful time in the land of op
portunity. As it turns out, he and his
fellow Irishmen overcame these
private barriers only to have their
grandchildren greeted with public
barriers a century later. The only dif
ference isthat signsare not used any
more.
Aside from personal feelings, how
ever, there is a more fundamental
position which argues against all
forms of unjust discrimination, in
cluding affirmative action. Through
out history, many radicals (including
Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson,
Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther
King, to name a few) have held a be
lief in a meritocracy, wherein each
person is granted societal privileges
solely on the basis of his or her quali
fications (merit) . For example, mak
ing the basketball team depends on
one's basketball skills. Whether one
is admitted to a prestigious school
depends on one's academic skills.
Whether one is offered a job de
pends on one's vocational skills, etc. .
I think this is the most moral, rea

sonable position that can be held. A
meritocracy is the most equitable
way of distributing to some members
of society the privileges which, for
practical reasons, cannot be ex
tended to all of its members. Why is it
most equitable? Simply because it
disallows precisely the kind of dis
crimination which "civil rights ac
tivists" deplore — discrimination
based on accidents of birth, be they
race, sex, creed, or socio-economic
status; and it allows precisely the
kindof discrimination which benefits
society — discrimination which pre
vents the less qualified from displac
ing the more qualified, ensuring
each individual the social and eco
nomic mobility he or she has earned.
Whenever I discuss my views on
the meritocracy, I am inevitably con
fronted with the following retorts:
"But what is considered to be merit?
Maybe being black or being a wom
an is a qualification in itself. Maybe
blacks and women have had to over
come instances of racism or sexism —
and this is an achievement, a quali
fication."
What is merit? If we're talking
about admission to medical school,
then I would assume that the aca
demic record would be foremost, fol
lowed by considerations of interests,
activities, etc. . Racial or sexual status
in and of itself is not a qualification. If
we're talking about a job in a factory,
then I would assume that job ex
perience and ability are foremost.
Again, racial or sexual status in and
of itself is irrelevant. It might be the
case, though, where the personality
of an applicant is important in quali
fying him or her for a privilege. Re
silience and perserverance, for ex
ample, may be traits which a certain
privilege-holder should have; there
fore, possession of these traits in this
case would constitute merit. How
ever, blindly assuming that all minor
ities and all women (and only minor
ities and women) necessarily possess
certain qualities by virtue of their
race and/or sex alone, is absurd as
well as racist.
Of course, affirmative action is not
the only policy which undermines
the meritocracy. Racism, sexism,
nepotism and favoritism to children
of alumni also undermine the meri
tocracy. I dwell on affirmative action

because one find so many "en
lightened" people in favor of it.
Any kind of favoritism or dis
favoritism based on non-merit ori
ented principles is wrong. Should the
government outlaw these abuses?
What the scope of governmental au
thority should be in this matter is a
complex issue. But one thing is for
sure: the government should not
punish those who practice a merito
cracy. Unfortunately, that is exactly
what our government does when it
pursues a policy of affirmative action.

person is granted societal privileges
solely on the basis of his or her quali
fications (merit) . For example, mak
ing the basketball team depends on
one's basketball skills. Whether one
is admitted to a prestigious school
depends on one's academic skills.
Whether one is offered a job de
pends on one's vocational skills, etc. .
I think this is the most moral, rea

sonable position that can be held. A
meritocracy is the most equitable
way of distributing to some members
of society the privileges which, for
practical reasons, cannot be ex
tended to all of its members. Why is it
most equitable? Simply because it
disallows precisely the kind of dis
crimination which "civil rights ac
tivists" deplore — discrimination
based on accidents of birth, be they
race, sex, creed, or socio-economic
status; and it allows precisely the
kindof discrimination which benefits
society — discrimination which pre
vents the less qualified from displac
ing the more qualified, ensuring
each individual the social and eco
nomic mobility he or she has earned.
Whenever I discuss my views on
the meritocracy, I am inevitably con
fronted with the following retorts:
"But what is considered to be merit?
Maybe being black or being a wom
an is a qualification in itself. Maybe
blacks and women have had to over
come instances of racism or sexism —
and this is an achievement, a quali
fication."
What is merit? If we're talking
about admission to medical school,
then I would assume that the aca
demic record would be foremost, fol
lowed by considerations of interests,
activities, etc. . Racial or sexual status
in and of itself is not a qualification. If
we're talking about a job in a factory,
then I would assume that job ex
perience and ability are foremost.
Again, racial or sexual status in and
of itself is irrelevant. It might be the
case, though, where the personality
of an applicant is important in quali
fying him or her for a privilege. Re
silience and perserverance, for ex
ample, may be traits which a certain
privilege-holder should have; there
fore, possession of these traits in this
case would constitute merit. How
ever, blindly assuming that all minor
ities and all women (and only minor
ities and women) necessarily possess
certain qualities by virtue of their
race and/or sex alone, is absurd as
well as racist.
Of course, affirmative action is not
the only policy which undermines
the meritocracy. Racism, sexism,
nepotism and favoritism to children
of alumni also undermine the meri
tocracy. I dwell on affirmative action

because one find so many "en
lightened" people in favor of it.
Any kind of favoritism or dis
favoritism based on non-merit ori
ented principles is wrong. Should the
government outlaw these abuses?
What the scope of governmental au
thority should be in this matter is a
complex issue. But one thing is for
sure: the government should not
punish those who practice a merito
cracy. Unfortunately, that is exactly
what our government does when it
pursues a policy of affirmative action.

Three weeks ago, I saw a film of
Martin Luther King saying, "I dream
of a world where people are judged
not by the color of their skin but by
the content of their character."
We all dream of a world where ra
cial discrimination is non-existent. To
me, the only valid goal of a "civil
rights activist" is to create a world
where race does not matter, where a
person's character and not his race
determine his place in society. So, I
find the actions of King's successors
particularly puzzling. Today, civil
rights leaders advocate policies
which do violence to King's dream.
Affirmative action in employment
and education sanctions precisely
what King abhorred — discrimina
tion based on race, not merit.
Now I have to admit to some per
sonal biasagainst affirmative action. I
believe that those hurt most by af
firmative action are lower-income
white males whose ancestors may
have had to deal with private sector
discrimination in their time. I re
member my great-grandfather re
counting his arrival in America in the
late nineteenth century. He and his
relatives were greeted with signs that
read "No Irish" or "Irish need not ap
ply." With the name Quinn, he had a
wonderful time in the land of op
portunity. As it turns out, he and his
fellow Irishmen overcame these
private barriers only to have their
grandchildren greeted with public
barriers a century later. The only dif
ference isthat signsare not used any
more.
Aside from personal feelings, how
ever, there is a more fundamental
position which argues against all
forms of unjust discrimination, in
cluding affirmative action. Through
out history, many radicals (including
Samuel Adams, Thomas Jefferson,
Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther
King, to name a few) have held a be
lief in a meritocracy, wherein each
person is granted societal privileges
solely on the basis of his or her quali
fications (merit) . For example, mak

is admitted to a prestigious school
