## Reading doesn't improve grades 
### 
How many times have you walked
into an exam, after having blown off
80 percent of the reading and 10 lec
tures, and aced it? After looking with
pride and astonishment at that big,
beautiful "A" on the blue book, you
can't wait to tell yourstudiousfriends
in the class "Wow! I can't believe it! I
didn't do squat-diddly for this test,
and just look at my grade (wave exam
in their faces)!" They mutter "won
derful," having gotten "B" s them
selves. At this point, you remember
to add modestly, "Well, I guess the
prof must have graded them in his
sleep. I mean, you knew the material
so much better than me; there just
must be some mistake." Meanwhile,
you are chuckling to yourself, "Tee
hee hee, I really am a genius! I can
just breeze my way into law school,
while these morons slave their way
through mediocrity."
Well, sorry to burst your bubble,
but you're not so smart, after all. Af
ter having congratulated myself over
the past two years for my intelligence
and fairy godmother, reality has just
slapped me smack-dab in the face
this morning in the form of a
midterm. "What happened?" you
may ask. The answer is that I did all
the reading.
Having heard horror stories about
the professor's grading system, how
he was far and by large the toughest
prof in the department, how he
thought the alphabet began with the
letter "C," I decided to take a revolu
tionary step for a fuzzy-studies major

and buckle down.
For the first time in my Stanford ca
reer since Human Sex (which I
bombed, embarrassingly enough), I
did all the reading — yes, even the
dreaded reserve reading, too. My
head thus filled with knowledge, I
waltzed smilingly into the classroom,
and floundered miserably. Trudging
out of the room a grim hour later, I
thought bitterly that what they say is
true — no good deed goes un
punished. Yet the more I thought
about the irony of it all, the more I re
alized it made sense. Of course you
will do better if you don't do all the
work. And here is why:
ID questions: In most exams, you
have a choice — in this case, it was
four out of 10. Now, since I had done
the reading, I was familiar with all 10
terms. Therefore, I had to waste time
deciding which four I knew best. If I
hadn't studied so much, I would only
have heard of four or five of them,
and could have chosen instantly.
Essay choice: As with the ID's, you
will most likely be incapable of un
derstanding more than one question
if you've blown off the reading —
again, you don't have to make a de
cision. Your own ignorance makes it
for you.
The desire to show off your knowl
edge to the prof: You've done all the
reading, and you want to make damn
sure he knows it. So you insert specif
ic details which will impress him and
assert your superiority over the rest
of the class. Example: Toure, the Pres

ident of Guinea, who was active in
strikes and labor unions, having
dropped out of school at age 15, en
joying chess and canasta in his spare
time, never one to say "no" to
Martini and Rossi on the rocks, and
whose cousin once dated Ethel
Merman, led the country to inde
pendence in 1958.
The professor will not be im
pressed. Furthermore, the more de
tails you put in, the more apt you are
to make mistakes, and then have
points taken off for misinformation.
Ethel Merman probably dated the
President of Ghana's cousin, not the
President of Guinea's.
So think twice about checking out'
those reserve readings. Remember,
the more you know, the more you
forget. The brain is not a bottomless
pit. As more facts are thrust into the
poor cerebrum, the more it re-,,
sembles a cluttered attic: ideas be
come jumbled together, severely J
hampering any organization ofj
thoughts. Thus, stick to the basics.J
Even if you only know a few things,
you will at least know them well,
probably well enough to fool thltf "
prof. You see, the beautiful thiri£
about blowing off the reading is that
no one will ever know. And your
brain will be left happy and carefree,
with room to breathe. So don't scoff
at simple-mindedness — it usually
works for me.

The professor will not be im
pressed. Furthermore, the more de
tails you put in, the more apt you are
to make mistakes, and then have
points taken off for misinformation.
Ethel Merman probably dated the
President of Ghana's cousin, not the
President of Guinea's.
So think twice about checking out'
those reserve readings. Remember,
the more you know, the more you
forget. The brain is not a bottomless
pit. As more facts are thrust into the
poor cerebrum, the more it re-,,
sembles a cluttered attic: ideas be
come jumbled together, severely J
hampering any organization ofj
thoughts. Thus, stick to the basics.J
Even if you only know a few things,
you will at least know them well,
probably well enough to fool thltf "
prof. You see, the beautiful thiri£
about blowing off the reading is that
no one will ever know. And your
brain will be left happy and carefree,
with room to breathe. So don't scoff
at simple-mindedness — it usually
works for me.

How many times have you walked
into an exam, after having blown off
80 percent of the reading and 10 lec
tures, and aced it? After looking with
pride and astonishment at that big,
beautiful "A" on the blue book, you
can't wait to tell yourstudiousfriends
in the class "Wow! I can't believe it! I
didn't do squat-diddly for this test,
and just look at my grade (wave exam
in their faces)!" They mutter "won
derful," having gotten "B" s them
selves. At this point, you remember
to add modestly, "Well, I guess the
prof must have graded them in his
sleep. I mean, you knew the material
so much better than me; there just
must be some mistake." Meanwhile,
you are chuckling to yourself, "Tee
hee hee, I really am a genius! I can
just breeze my way into law school,
while these morons slave their way
through mediocrity."
Well, sorry to burst your bubble,
but you're not so smart, after all. Af
ter having congratulated myself over
the past two years for my intelligence
and fairy godmother, reality has just
slapped me smack-dab in the face
this morning in the form of a
midterm. "What happened?" you
may ask. The answer is that I did all
the reading.
Having heard horror stories about
the professor's grading system, how
he was far and by large the toughest
prof in the department, how he
thought the alphabet began with the
letter "C," I decided to take a revolu
tionary step for a fuzzy-studies major

and buckle down.
For the first time in my Stanford ca
reer since Human Sex (which I
bombed, embarrassingly enough), I
did all the reading — yes, even the
dreaded reserve reading, too. My
head thus filled with knowledge, I
waltzed smilingly into the classroom,
and floundered miserably. Trudging
out of the room a grim hour later, I
thought bitterly that what they say is
true — no good deed goes un
punished. Yet the more I thought
about the irony of it all, the more I re
alized it made sense. Of course you
will do better if you don't do all the
work. And here is why:
ID questions: In most exams, you
have a choice — in this case, it was
four out of 10. Now, since I had done
the reading, I was familiar with all 10
terms. Therefore, I had to waste time
deciding which four I knew best. If I
hadn't studied so much, I would only
have heard of four or five of them,
and could have chosen instantly.
Essay choice: As with the ID's, you
will most likely be incapable of un
derstanding more than one question
if you've blown off the reading —
again, you don't have to make a de
cision. Your own ignorance makes it
for you.
The desire to show off your knowl
edge to the prof: You've done all the
reading, and you want to make damn
sure he knows it. So you insert specif
ic details which will impress him and
assert your superiority over the rest
of the class. Example: Toure, the Pres

ident of Guinea, who was active in
strikes and labor unions, having
dropped out of school at age 15, en
joying chess and canasta in his spare
time, never one to say "no" to
Martini and Rossi on the rocks, and
whose cousin once dated Ethel
Merman, led the country to inde
pendence in 1958.
