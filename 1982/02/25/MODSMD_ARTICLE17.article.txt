## Even rigged election will backfire 
### 
1 was having a telephone conversa
tion last Saturday morning with a
long-time follower of U.S. foreign
policy in Latin America. My friend,
Frank, is well into his sixties now and
from his years of experience I hoped
to get a better perspective on the
pros and cons of elections in El
Salvador.
"My Boy," he started in his fatherly
way. "The first problem most Ameri
cans have with respect to El

Salvador's upcoming elections is sort
ing out the issues correctly."
"Well," I asked, " what are the real
issues?"
"First of all, my boy, you've got to
understand that the question of fair
elections is a non-issue. How can
there be anything approaching a fair
election • when right-wing death
squads murder potential condidates
with impunity and those who survive
the attacks of death squads are re
quired to submit a list of 3000 sup
porters with their names, addresses
and place of work to El Salvador's in
famous Treasury Police?
"Can you imagine? The Treasury Po
lice!" he snorted.
"Then what is the issue," I per
sisted impatiently, knowing how
Frank could drag on once he had a
captive audience.
"The issue is what our Congress,
the Reagan administration and De
fense Minister Garcia — the real
power in El Salvador — will do if the
ultra-right wing candidates dominate
the elections," he answered with a
grim chuckle. "After all my boy, it's
not elections for the sake of elections
they're having down there. The U.S.
State Department boys only want
elections to justify Napoleon Duarte,
the junta's figurehead leader. And
the only reason he's even a figleaf for
Garcia is becase the Carter adminis
tration forced him on Defense Min
ister Garcia."
"So Duarte is merely a front for the
Defense Minister Garcia," I an
swered, "and we need an election to
create the illusion of a civilian gov
ernment — a government to which
the Reagan administration will find it
easier to justify giving military aid."
"That's part of the story," Frank an
swered, "but not the whole story.
The repression of the left opposition
leaders which has succeeded in
keeping them out of the elections
was intended to guarantee Duarte's
Christian Democratic party control
of the assembly. But, ironically, it has
dangerously narrowed the contest to
the ultra-right wing groups and
Duarte. The right wing parties are
taking advantage of the elections to

undermine Duarte and replace him
with one of their people."
"But what happened to all the
moderates? How have these right
wing groups become so strong?" I
asked, a bit puzzled by this new in
formation.
"There is a civil war going on in El
Salvador," he answered."and more
than that," he continued, "this civil
war has forced almost everyone to
take sides. It has become a war very
much like our own Civil War be
tween the Union and the Con-

between the Union
and the Confederate
States.

federate States. In El Salvador today,
just like the Civil War then, one
either sided with progress and
against slavery or suported the old
plantation system. While El
Salvador's peasants may not be
slaves, their oppression is sufficiently
similar to justify the comparison."
"Then what will happen if the right
wing parties win the Assembly elec
tions?"! asked, beginning to regret
having started the discussion.
"If Defense Minister Garcia has to
fix the election results not only by ex
cluding the left but by stuffing the
ballot box against the right to guaran
tee Duarte's election and pacify the
U.S. Congress," he answered
thoughtfully, "then Defense Min
ister Garcia could wind up isolated
from his own base of support among
the land owning oligarchy who also
fund the right wing parties.
"Do you mean to tell me that even
a rigged election might backfire on
our State Department and Garcia?" I
asked incredulously. "I don't believe
it!"
"That, my boy, is the problem. No
one does."
