## The 						China connection New exchange program begins 
### Mark Zeigler 
Stanford may seem like it is everywhere
with its overseas studies programs at cam
puses all across the world. But Beijing, Chi
na? Give the Department of Asian Lan
guages here until fall quarter, 1982, and in
all likelihood a few University graduate
students will be hittingthe booksat Beijing
University.
John Wang, chairman of the Depart
ment of Asian Languages, has set up an ad
vanced graduate exchange program with
Beijing University's famous Chinese Lan
guage and Literature department. The ex
change will go into effect next fall. Ap
plication deadline is Monday, March 1.
The program is available to those Chi
nese language and literature students who
would benefit from studying at Beijing
University. Wang pointed out that the uni
versity possesses exclusive research mate
rials and "particular scholars that are bet
ter, more specialized" than those here.
In the humanities and social sciences,
Beijing "is probably the most prestigious
university in China," Wang said. "A lot of
the Chinese leaders were connected in
one way or another with it."
According to Guang Zang, those stu
dents fulfilling Stanford's end of the deal
should be honored to study at Beijing.
Zang, a graduate student presently study
ing chemistry here, attended Beijing Uni
versity for nearly nine years.
"It is a comprehensive university. Bei
jing has a higher reputation there than
Stanford does here," she noted.
Zang said Beijing is highly selective,

much more so than even Stanford. "In
China, one or two, maybe three, percent
(of high school graduates) can go to col
lege, and Beijing University is the best.
"The Chinese Language and Literature
Department is one of the best in the uni
versity. It is very difficult to get in to,"she
continued.
However, the opportunity to study at
Beijing will not be inexpensive. Besides
paying the regular Stanford tuition, those
involved will have to pay $4000 extra to
cover room, board and research costs at
the university. This program fee does not
include travel expenses.
Nevertheless, once-in-a-lifetime cul l
tural benefits are offered along with the
academic opportunities. "It will certainly
be an interesting cultural experience for
them," said Karleen Oickey, associate
dean of the graduate division, said.
Dickey indicated that those Americans
taking part in the exchange will be well-ac
cepted at Beijing. "The Chinese are
fascinated with Americans," she said.
"I would rate the cultural opportunities
just as important as the research op
portunities," Wang said. "They will be liv
ing in an environment where they will
have to speak the language all the time.
Just by being there would help them quite
a bit culturally."
Looking at the exchange from Beijing
University's perspective, the program will
open a few important doors. The Chinese
government funds U.S. study for their top
scholars in the sciences, especially engi
neering and computer science, "where

they have the most catching-up to do," ac
cording to Dickey. "Their government is
not funding for humanities exchanges,"
she added.
"We want to bring more people in the
humanities to the states," Wang explained.
If successful, the exchange program would
do just this.
The program is also Stanford's first "of
ficial exchange" with Beijing, said Dickey.
"It is unique in that, while there are a lot
of universities that have established rela
tions with China, on the departmental
level I think ours will be the first one,"
Wang said. The exchange will be strictly an
interdepartmental one, meaning that stu
dents going to Beijing can only take
coursesin the Chinese Languageand Liter
ature Department.
While in Beijing, Zang said he felt that
the Stanford students will notice a marked
ly different social and academic at
mosphere than at Stanford.
"I studied almost all the weekends while
I was there," she said. "Most of the Chi
nese students study much harder (than
their American counterparts). Here it
seems much more relaxed."
Zang also said he believed Beijing is
more competitive than Stanford. "They
don't ask students to study very deeply
here," she commented.
Beijing University operates on a semes
ter system, with the initial half of the aca
demic year from September to the middle
of January. Aftera two week break, thestu
dents return until mid-July, when a IV2
month vacation starts.
