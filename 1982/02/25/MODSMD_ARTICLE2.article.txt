# Anderson returns to academic life
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
Martin Anderson, a prominent member of
President Ronald Reagan's inner circle, said yes
terday that his resignation as director of the White
House Office of Policy Development was
prompted by desires to return to the Hoover In
stitution and an academic environment.
Anderson denied suspicions voiced by conser
vatives that Anderson and other ideologically loyal
supporters of the administration are being forced
out by a pragmatic faction led by White House
Chief of Staff James Baker.
"I never had a desire to be a career public of
ficial. I have been on leave from Hoover four of the
last six years. I want to get back to my academic
work for a while," he said. "As for any rumors (on
being forced out of his position), they are not
based. They make no sense."
Anderson will resume his post as a senior fellow
at Hoover March 1, when he officially leaves his
White House job.

"We're delighted to have him back," said W.
Glenn Campbell, director of the Institution.
However, Anderson will not sever all his ties
with the White House. He will remain a memberof
both the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory
Board and his Economic Policy Advisory Board.
"I continue to feel very much part of your ad
ministration and I look forward to working with
you and other members of your staff and Cabinet,"
Anderson said in a letter to the president.
His major project while at the University will be a
book on the rise of conservative ideologies and the
Reagan administration.
"The book will be on the power of ideas over the
last 15 to 20 years, particularly conservative ideol
ogies and how they led to the candidacy and then
to the presidency for Ronald Reagan. Then the
book will look at current national policies," An
derson said.
Although Anderson and his wife are making ar
rangements for a house near the University,
further research and interviews for the book will
require them to spend much of theirtime in Wash

ington D.C. until the book's completion, he said.
Much of Anderson's work while in the Office of
Policy Development, he said, concerned analysis
of the Reagan economic program. Anderson was
one of the few White House insiders to oppose the
proposal for new excise taxes, a proposal which
Reagan eventually rejected. Anderson also op
posed limits on Japanese auto imports â€” limits
which Reagan accepted.
Anderson previously served as director of re
search in former President Richard Nixon's presi
dential campaign and was the architect for the pro
posal during that administration for the all-volun
teer army.
Anderson's wife, Annelise Graebner, will re
main in her present position as an associate direc
tor to David Stockman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget.
Anderson was one of five Hoover fellows with
full-time White House-based government posi
tions. Twenty-four Hoover scholars currently serve
the administration in various other capacities.
