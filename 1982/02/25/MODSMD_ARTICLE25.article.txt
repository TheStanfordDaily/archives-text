## Baryshnikov who?': ABT erases director's absence 
### Mary Walp 
The Bay Area is gettingatreat
ight now — two week* of
\merican Ballet Theatre. Al
hough it is unfortunate that
vtikhail Baryshnikov injured
lis knee in rehearsal and can't
jerform, the strength of the
est of the company more than
ronsoles the audience for his
ibsence. At least the four
Dallets on last Thursday's pro
gram did.
Paul Taylor's beautiful Airs
/vas the first ballet of the eve
ning. Free and loose, it is all an
nterplay of movement, tempo
and space between the dan
cers. Of course this is what
dance is all about, but Taylor is
celebrating these elements
themselves rather than using
them to something
else. The dancers weave in and
out of groups, developing and
varying the themes. The dan
cers move in unison, then one
breaks off to start something
new which the others join.
Taylor's choreography
evokes a sense of growth and
continuation, but Thursday
night there was a slight wood
enness in the dancing which
kept Airs from flowing as it
should have. Except for Elaine
Kudo and Johan Renvall, the
dancers seemed to be holding
themselves back a little. These
two, however, brought that ex
tra sparkle to their pas de deux
that comes with total com
munication between dancers.
They were playful, sometimes
almost coy, but never syrupy.
The high point of the eve
ning, ABT's brand new produc
tion 6f Kenneth MacMillan's
The Wild Boy, was next. Robert
LaFosse replaced Baryshnikov
in the role of the boy, and did
an excellent job of erasing the
disoppointment of not seeing
the company's new director in
that role. Natalia Makarova as
the woman with Kevin
McKenzie as her husband and
Brian Adams as his friend were
equally convincing in their
roles, dancing the story of a
spirited, natural boy who is
transformed by others into a
.veak and pathetic individual.
I The ballet begins with
faF osse dancing alone in the

forest, moving freely, perhaps
a little warily, but obviously en
joying the simple act of move
ment. I hen the animals,! his
kindred spirits it would seem,
dressed in masks and boldly
colored leotards, come out
from the dark, shadowy sets,
and dance a very powerful,
almost tribal number fists
and hips everywhere. The wild
boy returns, they scatter, ana||
the two men enter, their pow
erful dancing reminiscent of
oriental warriors: legs like
swords, turns and jumps full of
strength. There is a struggle
with the boy and they net him,
but LaFosse manages to etc ape.
A pas de trcm with McKenzie,
Adams and Makarova follows.
It should be sensual, yet there
seems'to be a struggle under
lying the whole thing.
Finally, the men leave her
alone and LaFosse returns. A
pas de deux follows and al
though an element of fear and
distrust is present, this time the
dancing is sensual. They are
tense and uns i,r e, yet unlike

the pas de trois, neither at
tempts to overpower the other.
However, the husband and
friend reenter and a battle be
tween the three men occurs.
The boy escapes, leaving his
oppressors and "their" woman
to dance again. They are angry
and drag her about the stage,
keeping her in their control
until they finally sink to the
floor. LaFosse returns, this time
dressed in a large cumbersome
garment, holding a bottle. His
dancing is now confined, hav
ing lost his previous freedom.
He falls to the floor. The
animals, who have been watch
ing in the background, crawl
up to him. Each one examines
the boy and each one quickly
retreats, leaving him alone in
the middle, ending the ballet
on this negative note.
MacMillan's The Wild Boy is
a wonderful ballet, very mov
ing in its power struggle. Each
of the dancers, from LaFosse,
making up for Baryshnikov's
absence, to the animals,
danced superbly Thursday.

LaFosse convincingly showed
the change from naivity to con
fusion and fear. Makarova was
sensual, although defeated
from the start, and McKenzie
and Adams danced with the
necessary strength and de
termination of the boy's op
pressors. The costumes and set
complimented MacMillan's
choreography perfectly, creat
ing a primal forest, exactly the
place forwild things. This ballet
works very well, and Thursday
night the dancers lived up to
both the acting and technical
levels which it requires.
Makarova and McKenzie
then danced Jerome Robbins's
Other Dances. This ballet is ac
companied only by piano,
which is placed onstage right
alongside the dancers, connec
ting Chopin's music closely to
the dancing. Robbins'
choreography accentuates this
connection as well. The dan
cers casually walk on stage, lis
ten to the music a moment
before starting to dance, and
then casually walk off. The

choreographer is almost done
away with.
It might even seem that the
dancers are as yet unsure of the
music and are improvising
directly. For example, at one
point, McKenzie does a series
of quick turns and then stops.
But the music keeps going, so
he picks up and continues the
turns to keep up with the mu
sic. Occasionally the dancers
adopt affected styles, but it's all
in fun, all a part of movement.
Although Robbins is always
present somewhere in Other
Dances, the ballet brings us
back to the music — the in
spiration — from which the
ballet is created. McKenzie and
Makarova were perfect on
Thursday, performing with just
the right amount of hesitation
to accentuate the vivacity and
enjoyment they got from their
dancing.
Tutus, sequins, chandeliers
and golden fans. Balanchine's
Bouree Fantasque takes off
from this classical glitter, then
goes on to parody many of

ballet's classical affectations.
The extreme poses taken by
the dancers are funny, the not
quite-classical steps aren't
always too blatant, and the
dancing had all the energy that
this ballet requires. The corps
did a magnificent job with its
precision and playfulness, even
if the ballet itself, for all its glit
ter and fun, drags at times.
Thankfully, Bouree was
danced with humor and vital
ity, with Christine Spizzo and
Ronald Perry standing out in
the Latin influenced pas de
deux of the "Fete Polonaise.'
Their dancing was exquisite,
filled with breathtaking lifts
and leaps and catches. Every
time that the two appeared
they brought an extra excite
ment to the whole cast.
Although this sort of neo
classic Balanchine fluff is not
my favorite sort of dancing,
ABT performed with such en
thusiasm that I couldn't help
but be charmed by the dan
cers, if not the ballet.
