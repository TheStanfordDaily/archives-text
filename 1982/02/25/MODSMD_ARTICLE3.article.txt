News Analysis

Bunting, a reporter for the San lose
Mercury, faces 60 days in jail if he
continues to refuse to reveal con
fidential information in preliminary
hearings in the case of Anthony Jac
ques Broussard, a Milpitas youth ac
cused of rape and murder. On Tues
day, Municipal Court Judge Wayne
Kanemoto found Bunting guilty of
contempt of court, but withheld im

"If ever there was a case that you
would want to test the shield law
with," Bunting said, "this is it."
Added Bob Engel,executiveeditorof
the Mercury: "We will take it certain

Supreme Court."
The shield law, adopted into the
California Constitution by a referen
dum in 1980, states that anyone con

adjudged in contempt" for refusing
to disclose sources of information.
Bunting is now judged in contempt

his stories on Broussard, whom one
classmate quoted as having bragged
about the murder of a 14-year-old
girl. Bunting also refuses to hand

over his notes to the court or to tell
whether he reviewed them before
testifying.
A shield rule similar to California's
was struck down by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1978 in the famous case of
Myron Farber, a New York Times re
porter who went to jail rather than
reveal sources in his investigation
into mysterious murders at a New
Jersey hospital.
The Court found in Farber that the
defendant's constitutional right to a
fair trial to take precedence over the
reporter's right to confidentiality.
In Bunting's case — as in Farber's
— the criminal defendant has the
right to obtain witnesses and evi
dence in his defense. The shield law
"cannot apply," said Marc Franklin, a
