Reagan announces Latin aid program
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, warning of the danger that
"new Cubas will arise from the ruins of today's conflicts," yesterday
proposed an economic plan for Central America and the Caribbean
that includes increased financial aid and duty-free access to the United
States for virtually all the region's exports.
In a speech to the Organization of American States, Reagan spelled
out details of the long-awaited Caribbean basin initiative, conceived by
his administration as a means of dealing with the poverty and social ine
quality that has produced such regional upheavals as the civil war in El
Salvador.
Reagan's speech committed his administration and his personal pres
tige more clearly than ever before to the complex and controversial pol
icy of anti-leftist activism in Central America.
Beyond the details of the long-promised Caribbean basin economic
support program, much of which had become known during the eight
months of its bureaucratic incubation, Reagan's address was notable for
his very tough rhetoric in describing the security problems of the area
and his avoidance of details or even strong clues about a future U.S. mil
itary response.
To justify the increased aid and economic concessions as well as the
increased U.S. military support and involvement, Reagan described the
U.S. "vital interest" in Central America as an area close at hand and an
artery for imported oil and other trade.
"Let our friends and our adversaries understand that we will do what
ever is prudent and necessary to ensure the peace and security of the
Caribbean area," declared Reagan in addressing future policy. He did
not go beyond this very general statement, despite expectations raised
in last Thursday's presidential press conference when he turned aside
several pointed questions because of the forthcoming speech.
In keeping with a White House decision early last year that personal
involvement with the El Salvador problem could be politically damag
ing to the president, Reagan until yesterday had little to say in public
about the growing U.S. involvement in Central America. Haig, presi
dential counselor Edwin Meeise 111, Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger and lesser officials spoke out strongly while Reagan stood aloof.
In yesterday's speech, Reagan said he will ask Congress to eliminate
tariffs on all Caribbean products except textiles. That would mean duty
free entry to U.S. markets for such commodities as sugar, the economic
lifeblood of many Caribbean countries.
