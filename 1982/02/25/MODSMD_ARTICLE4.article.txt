Reagan announces Latin aid program
Washington — President Ronald Reagan, warning of the danger that
"new Cubas will arise from the ruins of today's conflicts," yesterday
proposed an economic plan for Central America and the Caribbean
that includes increased financial aid and duty-free access to the United
States for virtually all the region's exports.
In a speech to the Organization of American States, Reagan spelled
out details of the long-awaited Caribbean basin initiative, conceived by
his administration as a means of dealing with the poverty and social ine
quality that has produced such regional upheavals as the civil war in El
Salvador.
Reagan's speech committed his administration and his personal pres
tige more clearly than ever before to the complex and controversial pol
icy of anti-leftist activism in Central America.
Beyond the details of the long-promised Caribbean basin economic
support program, much of which had become known during the eight
months of its bureaucratic incubation, Reagan's address was notable for
his very tough rhetoric in describing the security problems of the area
and his avoidance of details or even strong clues about a future U.S. mil
itary response.
To justify the increased aid and economic concessions as well as the
increased U.S. military support and involvement, Reagan described the
U.S. "vital interest" in Central America as an area close at hand and an
artery for imported oil and other trade.
"Let our friends and our adversaries understand that we will do what
ever is prudent and necessary to ensure the peace and security of the
Caribbean area," declared Reagan in addressing future policy. He did
not go beyond this very general statement, despite expectations raised
in last Thursday's presidential press conference when he turned aside
several pointed questions because of the forthcoming speech.
In keeping with a White House decision early last year that personal
involvement with the El Salvador problem could be politically damag
ing to the president, Reagan until yesterday had little to say in public
about the growing U.S. involvement in Central America. Haig, presi
dential counselor Edwin Meeise 111, Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger and lesser officials spoke out strongly while Reagan stood aloof.
In yesterday's speech, Reagan said he will ask Congress to eliminate
tariffs on all Caribbean products except textiles. That would mean duty
free entry to U.S. markets for such commodities as sugar, the economic
lifeblood of many Caribbean countries.
El Salvador, where the administration has given top priori
ty to supporting the civilian-military government's struggle
against leftist guerrillas, clearly was the motivating force be
hind the plan outlined by the president. Although his stress
was on the need for peaceful economic development, Rea
gan also laced his speech liberally with tough rhetorical
warnings against Cuba and the Soviet Union attempting to
extend their influence in the Western Hemisphere.
In this country, the president's words undoubtedly were
listened to most closely for clues about the future course of
his controversial El Salvador policy, which already has caused
comparisons with Vietnam and triggered speculation about
whether the administration might be weighing the dispatch
of U.S. combat forces to assist the Salvadoran government.
In that respect, Reagan's speech contained no clear-cut
signals that the administration is planning any dramatic
changes of direction or escalation of the U.S. involvement in
El Salvador beyond previously announced increases in eco
nomic and military aid.
But, in its economic aspects, the speech had a significance
that potentially goes far beyond the plan's connection to the
immediate situation in El Salvador. Its "centerpiece" pro
vision marks the first time that the United States has offered
other countries a system of preferential tariff treatment that
U.S. officials described as "one-way free trade."
Watt misuses federal funds
Washington — Government auditors said yesterday that
Secretary of the Interior James Watt improperly used about
$4300 in government funds to throw two Christmas recep
tions at the historic home of Gen. Robert E. Lee, the South's
commander in the Civil War.
However, the controversial Watt and members of his staff
apparently are going to resist paying the bill because they be
lieve that, as Watt put it yesterday, "we did it the same way
everybody else does it."
"What would make it illegal for us would have made it il
legal for previous administrations," Watt said outside a hear
ing on Capitol Hill. He added that although he did not know
the details of the legal opinion, "I just know it was a great
party."
Douglas Baldwin, Watt's chief spokesman, disputed Gen
eral Accounting Office fundings that the money was used
improperly.
"The department carefully researched the procedures,
propriety and legality of the Lee Mansion events before they
occurred," Baldwin said. "We are convinced that everything
about them was handled correctly. If the GAO has come to
any other conclusion, the GAO is in error."
However, the GAO rejected a Department of Interior
argument that funds donated to it could be used to pay for
the event because "the guests' visits to the house were de
signed to acquaint them with the historic significance of the
house and to enhance their further understanding and ap
preciation of (Watt's) role in historic preservation."
The GAO said that the breakfast and the remaining cost for
the cocktail party, after the $4500 from the official reception
fund is expended, "must be paid for by the Interior officials
who authorized the expenditures."
Romania defaults on U.S. loan
Washington — Romania has failed to pay the Commodity
Credit Corporation (CCC) $5.8 million it owes for U.S. agri

cultural products, becoming the second Soviet bloc com
munist country after Poland to go into arrears in its debts to
the U.S. government.
Officials at the corporation, the Department of Agricul
ture's bank, said yesterday that checks are to be sent this
week to reimburse two New York banks handling collection
of money due from Romania on government commodity
loans.
The latest development in the unfolding financial crisis in
Eastern Europe raises the prospect of a new political embar
rassment for the Reagan administration, which is already fac
ing criticism for allowing Poland's military regime to delay
paying its debts.
Although Romania, like Poland, is a member of the Soviet
dominated Warsaw military pact, its foreign policy is con
sidered the most independent in Eastern Europe, and the
United States has supported its economic development.
Nevertheless, the non-payment could increase pressures in
side the administration against any new U.S. "bailout" in
Eastern Europe.
Romania owes the United States $91.3 million this year un
der old commodity buying loans.
The International Monetary Fund suspended Romania's
right to draw new credits last November and reportedly is in
sisting on substantial reforms in Romania's rigid, Soviet-style
economy as a condition for continued financing.
Jaruzelski criticizes U.S.
Warsaw — Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech
jaruzelski opened the first Central Committee meeting un
der martial law yesterday by denouncing U.S. policy towards
Poland as a threat to world peace.
He also criticized anti-state propaganda by underground
media that have sprung up since martial law was decreed
Dec. 13, and called for party unity and stability.
Jaruzelski said the United States had shifted from a policy
of negotiations to "a policy of confrontation."
The two-day meeting of the 200-member Central Commit
tee was considered significant because it was elected by an
emergency congress last July under pressure for reforms by
the now-suspended Solidarity union. Many committee
members had reportedly sympathized with Solidarity and
are demoralized because of the military crackdown.
Jaruzelski criticized dissidents, commenting a slogan
dabbed on walls in some cities which reads "the winter is
yours but the spring is ours."
"The spring will not be yours or ours," Jaruzelski said. "It
will simply be Polish and socialist."
"Unfortunately in recent periods, the threat to peace is in
creasing seriously," Jaruzelski said. "The main responsibility
for this is borne by the American administration."
The United States has demanded that Poland rescind
martial law, free more than 4000 politicial dissidents and
unionists being held without charge and resume talks with
Solidarity. The Polish government has rejected the U.S. posi
tion as interference in Poland's internal affairs.
Political split in S. Africa
Johannesburg, South Africa — A serious split over racial
policy developed in South Africa's National Party Wednes
day when 23 prominent party members refused to endorse
Prime Minister, Pieter Botha, the party leader.
The divided vote, and subsequent walkout by the party re

bels — all members of parliament — followed a plea by
Botha at a party caucus to support his intention to give col
ored (mixed-race) and Asian (mainly from India) citizens a
voice in government through representation in Parliament.
Even though Botha does not intend to give similar repre
sentation to the nation's black majority, the prospect of hav
ing any "non-whites" sitting in Parliament is being resisted
by arch-conservatives in the party. This apparently pre
cipitated the defiance at the party caucus.
However, the vote among National Party members of Par
liament attending the caucus favored Botha 100 to 22, in
dicating that he retains considerable support.
Since coming to power 34 years ago, the National Party has
introduced legalized segregation of all races, a system that
results in discrimination against the country's black majority.
Racial tension has steadily increased in the nation and South
Africa suffers a degree of political and economic isolation,
organized by the United Nations, because of its white-su
premacy doctrine.
Alternative budget proposal
Washington — The Reagan administration, in the most
conciliatory stand to date over the embattled 1983 budget,
pronounced as "very interesting" Wednesday a Senate Re
publican's alternative that would trim the president's big def
icits.
But the president's men offered no specific indication that
Reagan would accept Budget Chairman Pete Domenici's call
for a scaledown in the proposed Pentagon buildup, a boost
in some taxes and a possible postponement of the basic,
three-year cut in income taxes.
Still, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan said he found the
counterplan of the New Mexico Republican a "reasonable
proposal."
But during a break in the hearing, Regan said the phased
tax cut passed last year should not be changed.
Budget Director David Stockman, asked about Domenici's
proposal, said: "It's a good-faith effort to generate a com
prehensive proposal. But there are problem areas that need
to be looked at."
Stockman did not elaborate, but Murray Weidenbaum,
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers mentioned
three "obvious concerns" before the Senate Appropriations
Committee — Domenici's unspecified plans to raise taxes by
$122 billion over three years, his proposal to slice $20 billion
to $25 billion from the Pentagon budget through 1985 and his
suggestion of a spending freeze on hundreds of domestic
programs.
Stocks rally for huge gain
New York — The stock market ran up its biggest gain in
almost a month yesterday in a late rally paced by heavy activi
ty in the depressed oil issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up only a fraction
as late as 2 p.m., wound up with a 13.79-point gain at 826.77.
That marked the average's best showing since it climbed
21.59 points on Jan. 28.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached 64.80 million
shares, up from 60.10 million Tuesday.
Gold was $362.75 per ounce in New York yesterday.
Today's weather
