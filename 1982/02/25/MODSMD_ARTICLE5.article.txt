# Kennedy will lead joint university,defense advisory committee

### Sally Newman 
In order to discuss ways of correct
ing "problems of mutual concern,"
universities and the federal govern
ment have formed a joint committee
to be led by University President
Donald Kennedy and Richard De
lauer, undersecretary of the Dept. of
Defense.
The committee, which concluded
its first meeting Tuesday, is com
posed of Defense Dept. officials and
university administrators chosen by
the American Association of Univer
sities (AAU).
"We've created a mechanism to
handle a series of issues," Delauer, a
Stanford graduate, said. "They in
clude research funding for univer
sities, foreign language training in
universities, problems associated
with various career stages in engi
neering and the sciences, and export
controls and questions about classi
fied research."
This last topic has been the subject
of controversy on university cam
puses for some time. The controversy
has grown more acute since Feb. 27,
1981, when Kennedy and four other
university presidents expressed
"grave concern" at government at
tempts to limit foreign access to
teaching and research.
Since then, "the Department of
Defense has made a thoroughly re
sponsible effort to talk the problem
through," according to Kennedy.
The Defense Dept. organized the
committee, and the AAU selected
Kennedy as its chair.
The aim of the committee is to re
solve problems through discussion
alone. However, Delauer did not rule

out the possibility that it might pro
pose one or several bills relating to
federal attempts to impose "export"
controls on academic teaching and
research. "We don't want to propose
legislation," Delauer said, "but if
necessary,. . . maybe."
A star-studded cast of about a
dozen university officials, including
David Saxon, Chancellor of the Uni
versity of California, Cal Tech presi
dent Marvin Goldberger, and John
Deutsch, dean of sciences at MIT,
represent the AAU, while Delauer
and his staff are still "generating the
rest of the committee."
Delauer called the committee a
"management group" which would
rely on information from experts in
the topics under consideration.
"Take export of technology, or ca
reer switching, orthe shortage of en
gineering faculty and under
graduates," Delauer said. "Those are
the kind of things that need experts."
Grad schools do not produce
enough engineers and scientists, ac
cordingto Delauer, and of those who
do make it through to the Ph.D., just
under half are foreign students. This
is because the demand is so high for
engineers with bachelor's degrees
that most go directly into industry.
As a result, the outlook for national
defense is bleak. "Where do you
think all our stuff comes from?" he
asked. "There is a need for science
and technology and not enough go
into the sciences. Far too many go
into journalism, and there are way
too many lawyers," he said.
Kennedy, vacationing in Utah, was
unavailable for comment.
