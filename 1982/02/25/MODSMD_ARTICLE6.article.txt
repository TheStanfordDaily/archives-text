# Student food waste criticized
## 
### Gail Schares 
Every day, Stanford students
send one ton of food discarded
from dining hall trays to the Palo
Alto dump. The yearly contribu
tion totals 230 tons, or $500,000
worth of food, according to
statistics compiled by the ASSU
Task Force on University Food
Service.
The figures were presented last
night at the World FHunger Forum
at Tresidder Union.
"We have to start thinking
about the food that is going into
the garbage here every day," said
task force founder and Council of
Presidents member Dragan
Popov, one of several speakers at
the forum.
Rod Beckstrom, task force

member and ASSU senator, cited
the all-you-can-eat food service
policy at Stanford as a major factor
contributing to food waste. "If
you had to pay for each sandwich,
you might not go back for the
third one."
Beckstrom proposed several
solutions to the food waste prob
lem here including a coupon or
charge card service that might in
crease the cost of food to students
who eat more food or waste food.
Another alternative was a din
ing system that would allow stu
dents to eat at any of several loca
tions on campus including the
Coffee House, Encina Station, and
dining co-ops.
In April, the task force will sub
mit several proposals to cut food

waste here.
Other speakers at the forum in
cluded Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy and Nevida
Preston, director of the Ecu
menical Hunger Project in Palo
Alto.


Prof. David Abernethy
Abernethy, who discussed the
problems of distributing foreign aid,
remained optimistic about the use
fulness of government food distribu
tion programs. "Whether we are
motivated by self-interest, the desire
to get rid of surplus food, or the gen
uine desire to feed hungry people,
the important thing is if the programs
actually work."
Abernethy added that aid can be
counterproductive when it boosts a
demand for American goods and de
creases the demand for local goods.
Meanwhile, the local hunger situ
ation is worsening according to Pres
ton, who discussed the effects of
President Ronald Reagan's recent
budget cuts on social programs.
