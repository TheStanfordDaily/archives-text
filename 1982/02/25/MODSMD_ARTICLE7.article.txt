# How your tuition dollars are allocated
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Once Stanford students pay their
tuition checks, the funds are al
located according to the University
budget for services from salaries to
student aid, but tuition alone does
not nearly cover the cost of operating
the University.

News Analysis

Tuition feeds the University's op
erating budget, which makes uponly
39 percent of the entire University
consolidated budget. The rest of the
consolidated budget is comprised of
income sources that are channeled
primarily to the programs which gen
erate them. Included in these are
programs that receive federal re
search grants and contracts, the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) which generates income, and
auxiliary enterprises which break
even, such as the residences, food
service and Tresidder Union.
The operating budget, 47 percent
of which is supplied by tuition, is
therefore the main source of funds
available to the University to allocate
freely. From this budget comes fund
ing for instruction and departmental
research, libraries, student aid, stu
dent services, operation and main
tenance, administration and general
expenses.
The largest portion — 45.9 percent
— of this year's operating budget
goes to instruction and departmental
research. Faculty salaries aind bene
fits consume most of this allotment,

but some teaching equipment and
salaries for teaching assistants are
also included.
The second largest expenditure is
for operation and maintenance,
which takes 15.4 percent of the oper
ating budget. This covers salaries and
equipment of those who maintain
the plant. A portion of this also goes
to heat and utility costs.
Administration costs, 11.1 percent
of the operating budget this year, are
spent mostly on administrators'
salaries, with a small portion going to
expendable materials (office sup
plies) and travel expenses.
Libraries draw on 10.4 percent of
the budget for salaries, maintenance,
and the acquisition of materials.
The 6.3 percent of funds budgeted
for student services pay the salaries of
staff members of the Old Union and
the Career Planning and Placement
Center, as well as those in similar stu
dentservice offices. Student financial
aid consumes 5.4 percent of the op
erating budget, and the remaining
5.5 percent goes to miscellaneous ex
penses.
The percentage allocations for
next year (1982-83) will not be avail
able until the entire budget proposal
is presented to the Board of Trustees
for approval next month.
A primary factor influencing the
1982-83 tuition increase, an increase
of inflation plus six percent, was Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company's utili
ty rate increase announced last year.
The announcement came after this
year's budget had already been ap
proved. Instead of adding to the al

ready announced 13 percent tuition
increase for 1981-82, the University
opted to incur a loss for the year and
smooth out the increase. Thus the
Office of Budget and Management
(OMB) predicts inflation plus six per
cent increases for 1982-83 and
1983-84. Inflation plus three percent
increases is predicted for the follow
ing two years.

Timothy Warner, assistant provost
of OMB, stressed that this is only a
proposal formulated now as a meth
od for spreading out the impact of
the utility increase. While the tuition
increase for 1982-83 reflects this fore
cast, tuition increases for the follow
ing years may deviate from the
projection because of unforeseen
circumstances.


1981-82 Operating Budget: $177.9 Million
