## El Salvador gains foreign aid 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Salvador, El Salvador — More than $400
million in foreign economic aid is expected to
pour intoembattled El SaJvadorthisyear, includ
ing the largest share of a fund President Ronald
Reagan proposed yesterday to help nations of
the Caribbean region.
The United States, striving to helpstem a leftist
rebellion, has now proposed $240 million in eco
nomic aid for this Central American nation this
year. That includes $100 million marked for El
Salvador's share of the $350 million Reagan
called for yesterday as aid to the 20-nation Carib
bean Basin area.
Other international lending agencies and
donor nations have another $160 million in aid
destined for El Salvador by year's end, a study of
assistance programs indicates.
Before the leftist guerrillas launched a cam
paign to overthrow the U.S.-backed civilian-mil
itary junta here, El Salvador received relatively
little foreign aid. The United States, the biggest
donor, provided $7-$ lO million a year.
The huge figures involved now reflect El
Salvador's new role in the East-West struggle. In
telling the Organization of American States in
Washington yesterday of the American concept
of a Caribbean Basin Initiative, Reagan warned
that "new Cubas" might arise from"the ashes of
today's conflicts."
The United States believes that helping El
Salvador to overcome its major economic prob
lems will help to end the civil war — by reducing
unemployment and economic uncertainties
that the guerrilla forces now exploit.
El Salvador — which economists thought a few
years ago might develop into the "Taiwan of
Central America" — now is virtually broke.
The aggressive businessmen of El Salvador, re
lying on a hard-working labor force, built up a
growing mercantile and manufacturing sector in
the late 19705. Without natural resources, El
Salvador developed a plastics industry, a grow

ing electronics assembly industry, much light
manufacturing and a pharmaceutical business.
But the uncertainties of war caused a flight of
capital that some economists here say took as
much as $1 billion out of the country. Now, El
Salvador has no foreign currency reserves and
has immediate debts of more than $108 million.
With no dollars to buy petroleum for plastics,
parts for television sets, or chemicals for phar
maceuticals, the economy last year staggered
toward bankruptcy. In the last three years,
merchandizing dropped by 28 percent, manu
facturing by 32 percent, and the gross domestic
product by 9.6 percent.
Agriculture, hit by falling international prices
for El Salvador's chief farm exports — coffee,
cotton and sugar — sank by 9 percent. Un
employment in some areas rose to 30 percent.
Attacks by guerrillas against communications
and transportation equipment caused tens of
millions of dollars in damage.
But economists here now predict a bottoming
out of the local recession by mid-1982, as the
promised dollars begin to reach the battered
economy.
The United States already had planned to pro
vide $140 million in economic aid, and the
Caribbean Basin Initiative proposal announced
Wednesday calls for another $100 million or
more, which would be an "economic support
fund" to be injected directly into the banking
system here — enabling banks to provide the
working capital to get the private sector back to
work.
The United States, it is expected, will retain
tight control of the funds to hold capital flight —
the smuggling of dollars to Miami, for instance
— to a minimum. The U.S. Agency for Interna
tional Development will administer the eco
nomic support fund.
Reagan said the United States will encourage
its allies to contribute to the aid of the countries
of the region including El Salvador.
