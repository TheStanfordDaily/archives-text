TUNE IN TO
A SOUND REVOLUTION.
SONY'S FM WALKMAN* STEREO RADIO.
FM stereo-to-go strolls into a new age with Sony's revolution in per
sonal listening. We call it the FM Walkman. It's a miniature FM stereo
receiver that clips onto your belt or hides in a pocket. Plug in the
featherweight stereo headphones and hang on to your socks. The
full-range sound is so exceptional, it rivals your home stereo system.
Weighing a mere six ounces, our FM Walkman is perfect for rock
'n roll skating, skiing, jogging or relaxing to the strings of Stravinsky.
And you can plug in an optional second pair of headphones and share
the FM riches with a friend. The headphone wire doubles as an
antenna. There are separate right and left volume controls. An LED
stereo indicator. And highly sophisticated circuitry for clear reception.
Walk in soon and h£ar our exciting stereo FM Walkman. At $79, it's
hard to keep our personal portable from running out.
