# Female science grads underrepresented
## 
### Christine Myers Jonathan Greene 
More women are enrolling in
Stanford's graduate science and
engineering departments these
days, but in most instances they
are still vastly underrepresented
— especially in Ph.D. programs.

News analysis

In engineering, for example,
women comprise about 27 per
cent of undergraduate majors but
only about 10 percent of graduate
students.
Stanford may also have a prob
lem retaining these students, who
often complain of a lack of role
models and limited personal sup
port.
Between 1970 and 1980, the per
centage of female science and en
gineering grad students increased
markedly — for example, from 10
to 23 percent in the School of
Earth Sciences. Compared with
the national average (in 1979,
three percent of all engineering
Ph.D.s in the United States were
conferred upon women), Stan
ford's enrollment is good.
Yet women are not applying to
graduate school at the same rate
as men. Last year, applications
from females exceeded 20 per
cent in only a few areas.
Assoc. Dean of Graduate Stud
ies Jean Fetter, a former physics
professor at San Jose State Univer
sity, heads a recruiting program
that includes visits to major wom
en's colleges and women's groups
within predominantly male in
stitutions. A new booklet, Stan
ford Women in Science and Engi
neering, is aimed at recruiting
more women into these areas.
Even when women apply and
enroll here, however, they don't
always stay. Ph.D. candidates may
complete their doctorates and be
come professors or consultants,
settle for a master's and a more lu
crative position in industry,
transfer to another school or de
partment, or leave for personal or
academic reasons.
Women who have completed
their degrees feel that those most
likely to succeed in the Ph.D. pro

grams know what they're getting
into, are directed, and don't want
to give up.
"You look around and see all
men in your classes and begin to
wonder if you really belong
there," said one woman. "Men
have more peer pressure to finish
the degree," while the message
for women is that it's okay to quit.
She felt that friendships with
women colleagues provided sub
stantial personal and academic
support.
Another woman said that the
relationship with an adviser, who
supports and directs the student's
research activities, is often inade
quate for female students. She be
lieves the reason is that most of
the faculty is male, and there are
"not that many men who work
well with women."
One assistant professor said she
believed the key to surviving
graduate school, as well as life as
an academic, is competence and a
competent self-image. "I tell ad
visees, 'Think of yourself as a pro
fessional, not as a woman,' " she
said. But she acknowledged that
the main difference she saw be
tween male and female students
was that "women seem to need
more encouragement, even if
they're doing a great job."
"I feel like I can't receive the
same level of personal support
and guidance as the male stu
dents," said a woman in the
School of Engineering of her fac
ulty contacts.
She also indicated that the
"heavy duty" recruitment effort
may be backfiring, because,
"when women are really wanted,
they (are) admitted with lesser
qualifications." She said that, even
though she was "unprepared" for
the rigors of first-year graduate
work, she was not allowed to
make up necessary prerequisites.
She is now leaving her Ph.D. pro
gram with a master's degree.
Other departments have had
high rates of attrition among their
female grad students for similar
reasons.
Ten of the 16 women admitted
to the Operations Research Ph.D.
program between 1975-1981 have

left the program, according to
Arthur Veinott, chairman of the
department. This is more than
twice the 30 percent rate among
the 82 males admitted in the same
period.
Some of the women cited insuf
ficient opportunity to take back
ground courses within the de
manding program and a "basically
cold" faculty as reasons for their
departure, to other schools in
some cases.
Attrition of female graduate
students will be explored in a two
year study co-sponsored by the
Dean of Graduate Studies, Coun
seling and Psycological Services
(CAPS) and the Center for Re
search on Women.
Dr. Larraine Zappert of CAPS,
who wilt lead the study, said her
concern stems from the reports of
graduate and professional school
women in her counseling groups
of "feelings of isolation and lack
of connectedness to their depart
ment."
When asked what could be
done to attract and retain more
female graduate students in the
sciences and engineering, Zap
pert said, "increase the number of
women . . . both students and fac

ulty."
Only 38 faculty out of a total of
630 in science and engineering
departments are women; 20 de
partments have no women facul
ty-
Cecelia Burciaga, who coordi
nates faculty affirmative action
programs, said she believes wom
en science and engineering facul
ty have fair access to opportunity,
amd that the ratio of tenured to
untenured women is "good."
"The appointment process at
the junior level is so careful that
we have not brought on women
who . . . don't have a clear possi
bility of being tenured," Burciaga
said.
The new booklet was prepared
with money contributed by
Syntex, Hewlett-Packard and
Ampex, which have an interest in
affirmative action to create a more
diverse pool of scientists and engi
neers, according to Fetter.
Fetter, who helped produce the
booklet, said the major criticism
of it is that "it paints too rosy a pic
ture" of Stanford women's partici
pation in the science and engi
neering fields, and might create
unrealistic expectations.
