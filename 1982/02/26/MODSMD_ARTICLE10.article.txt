## Viewpoint/Lauren Saunders Democratic district drawing 
### 
Any realistic observer of politics
knows that policies or reforms are
rarely enacted without the backing
of groups who have something to
gain in the process. This is a natural
and unavoidable aspect of our sys
tem* and need not detract from the
legitimacy of the issues itself. Un
fortunately, at times, the debate be
tween immediately affected parties
becomes so great that it detracts at
tention from the real issue, which is
seen only in the context of a power
struggle between competing in
terests. Reapportionment of voting
districts in California is such an issue.
Following the decennial national
census, the boundaries of voting dis
tricts for both the national and state
legislatures are redrawan so as to ac
count for population changes, and
thus to provide for more even repre
sentation. (As a result, Stanford is
now in the 11th Congressional Dis
trict, currently represented by Dem
ocrat Tom Lantos, instead of thel2th,
represented by Republican Pete Mc-
Closkey.)
This reapportionment takes place
in the state legislatures. In other
words, those who are directly af
fected by the results — politicans
who will be running for re-election
in the newly redrawn districts — con
trol the process. Not surprisingly, it is
subject to much manipulation.
Following the Supreme Court's
"one man, one vote" ruling in the
19605, gross numerical inequalities
have been eliminated. Beyond this
limitation, however, it is still possible
to draw the district lines in order to
protect incumbants by dividing op
posing political, racial, or economic

groups, to name a few, between dif
ferent districts, thus diluting their
voting strength.
This process is known as "ger
rymandering," after Elbridge Gerry,
the governor of Massachusetts in
1812, who created a salamander
shaped district to benefit Gerry's
Democratic Party.
Gerrymandering is alive and well
in America of the 20th century, as any
California Republican will tell you.
Following the 1980 consensus, the
Democratic-controlled California
legislature redrew the districts, pre
dictably, to benefit incumbant Dem
ocrats. Naturally, the Republicans are
furious and are seeking a referen
dum on the November ballot toover
turn the results. But the question still
remains: who will control the proc
ess if it is to be redone?
A current proposal, initiated by
Common Cause, a public interest
group, calls for the establishment of
an independent bi-partisan com
mission to take over the process, thus
removing it one step from the im
mediate beneficiaries now entrusted
with the task.
Recently, the traditionally liberal
group has formed a coalition with the
Republican Party, which as the un
derdog political party in the state has
realized that it will gain by a more
balanced method of reapportion
ment. Beyond the partisan dispute,
however, reform of the reapportion
ment process is needed and should
be supported regardless of one's par
ty affiliation. Petitions to put the pro
posal on the November ballot (along
with the Republican referendum)
will begin circulating this week.

The plan provides for a 10 person
commission as follows: four mem
bers will be chosen, one each, by the
major party caucuses of both houses
of the State Legislature (i.e. one
Democrat and one Republican from
the Assembly and one each from the
Senate). Provisions are included to
expand this number to include a
third party if it were to receive sub
stantial representation in the legisla
ture.
Two members will be chosen, one
each, by the chairs of the two major
political parties. A panelof seven sen
ior, presiding justices of the Court of
Appeals (no more than four of whom
may have been registered with the
same political party) will appoint four
additional members, who should be
"knowledgeable, politically inde
pendent women and men who will
give the Commission geographic, so
cial, and ethnic diversity."
The proposal mandates that district
lines be drawn so as to provide fair
and effective representation for all
citizens, including racial, ethnic, and
language minorities, and for all polit
ical parties. In addition, the proposal
calls for districts that are compact,
contiguous, and that minimize the
crossing of city and county lines.
All decision must be made by a
two-thirds vote of the Commission,
and must include approval by three
of the four judicial appointees as well
as at least one of the three Com
missioners from each major partisan
bloc. If the Commission cannot come
up with an acceptable plan, the proc
ess will be turned over to the Califor
nia Supreme Court, which in any case
may review the results. There is thus

an incentive for the parties to work
out acceptable compromises in the
Commission itself, where each re
tains input into the final decision.
The current method of reappor
tionment, with all its gerrymander
ing, is not pro-incumbant. In Califor
nia, of course, the majority of incum
bants are Democrats. Conversely, the
establishment of an independent
commission is not a pro-Republican
measure but a pro-competition one.
Even if the proposal succeeds, the
California Legislature will most likely
remain Democratic, as is the majority
of California voters.
However, this advantage may be
reduced somewhat so as to more

closely parallel the actual proportion
of Democrats in the state.
Furthermore, more carefully drawn
districts should encourage greater
competition within the respective
parties. With disadvantaged groups
no longer split between districts, ef
fectively disenfranchized, the legisla
ture should more accurately repre
sent the diversity of the population.
Independent commissions are al
ready in effect in Colorado, Mon
tana, and Hawaii, though none of
these cases is analagous to Califor
nia's, with its large geographic size,
and population and its high number
of congressional districts — a ger

rymandered paradise.
A democratically elected govern
ment such as ours should provide for
the representation of all its citizens.
But when the districts in which elec
tions take place are defined so as to
predetermine the outcomes and to
protect incumbants, this defeats the
purpose of elections altogether.
An independent commission, as
provided for on the currently
circulating petitions, may not prove
faultless. But it cannot be any worse
than the existing process, and it cer
tainly deserves a try.

Any realistic observer of politics
knows that policies or reforms are
rarely enacted without the backing
of groups who have something to
gain in the process. This is a natural
and unavoidable aspect of our sys
tem* and need not detract from the
legitimacy of the issues itself. Un
fortunately, at times, the debate be
tween immediately affected parties
becomes so great that it detracts at
tention from the real issue, which is
seen only in the context of a power
struggle between competing in
terests. Reapportionment of voting
districts in California is such an issue.
Following the decennial national
census, the boundaries of voting dis
tricts for both the national and state
legislatures are redrawan so as to ac
count for population changes, and
thus to provide for more even repre
sentation. (As a result, Stanford is
now in the 11th Congressional Dis
trict, currently represented by Dem
ocrat Tom Lantos, instead of thel2th,
represented by Republican Pete Mc-
Closkey.)
This reapportionment takes place
in the state legislatures. In other
words, those who are directly af
fected by the results — politicans
who will be running for re-election
in the newly redrawn districts — con
trol the process. Not surprisingly, it is
subject to much manipulation.
Following the Supreme Court's
"one man, one vote" ruling in the
19605, gross numerical inequalities
have been eliminated. Beyond this
limitation, however, it is still possible
to draw the district lines in order to
protect incumbants by dividing op
posing political, racial, or economic

groups, to name a few, between dif
ferent districts, thus diluting their
voting strength.
This process is known as "ger
rymandering," after Elbridge Gerry,
the governor of Massachusetts in
1812, who created a salamander
shaped district to benefit Gerry's
Democratic Party.
Gerrymandering is alive and well
in America of the 20th century, as any
California Republican will tell you.
Following the 1980 consensus, the
Democratic-controlled California
legislature redrew the districts, pre
dictably, to benefit incumbant Dem
ocrats. Naturally, the Republicans are
furious and are seeking a referen
dum on the November ballot toover
turn the results. But the question still
remains: who will control the proc
ess if it is to be redone?
A current proposal, initiated by
Common Cause, a public interest
group, calls for the establishment of
an independent bi-partisan com
mission to take over the process, thus
removing it one step from the im
mediate beneficiaries now entrusted
with the task.
Recently, the traditionally liberal
group has formed a coalition with the
Republican Party, which as the un
derdog political party in the state has
realized that it will gain by a more
balanced method of reapportion
ment. Beyond the partisan dispute,
however, reform of the reapportion
ment process is needed and should
be supported regardless of one's par
ty affiliation. Petitions to put the pro
posal on the November ballot (along
with the Republican referendum)
will begin circulating this week.

The plan provides for a 10 person
commission as follows: four mem
bers will be chosen, one each, by the
major party caucuses of both houses
of the State Legislature (i.e. one
Democrat and one Republican from
the Assembly and one each from the
Senate). Provisions are included to
expand this number to include a
third party if it were to receive sub
stantial representation in the legisla
ture.
Two members will be chosen, one
each, by the chairs of the two major
political parties. A panelof seven sen
ior, presiding justices of the Court of
Appeals (no more than four of whom
may have been registered with the
same political party) will appoint four
additional members, who should be
"knowledgeable, politically inde
pendent women and men who will
give the Commission geographic, so
cial, and ethnic diversity."
The proposal mandates that district
lines be drawn so as to provide fair
and effective representation for all
citizens, including racial, ethnic, and
language minorities, and for all polit
ical parties. In addition, the proposal
calls for districts that are compact,
contiguous, and that minimize the
crossing of city and county lines.
All decision must be made by a
two-thirds vote of the Commission,
and must include approval by three
of the four judicial appointees as well
as at least one of the three Com
missioners from each major partisan
bloc. If the Commission cannot come
up with an acceptable plan, the proc
ess will be turned over to the Califor
nia Supreme Court, which in any case
may review the results. There is thus

an incentive for the parties to work
out acceptable compromises in the
Commission itself, where each re
tains input into the final decision.
The current method of reappor
tionment, with all its gerrymander
ing, is not pro-incumbant. In Califor
nia, of course, the majority of incum
bants are Democrats. Conversely, the
establishment of an independent
commission is not a pro-Republican
measure but a pro-competition one.
Even if the proposal succeeds, the
California Legislature will most likely
remain Democratic, as is the majority
of California voters.
However, this advantage may be
reduced somewhat so as to more

closely parallel the actual proportion
of Democrats in the state.
Furthermore, more carefully drawn
districts should encourage greater
competition within the respective
parties. With disadvantaged groups
no longer split between districts, ef
fectively disenfranchized, the legisla
ture should more accurately repre
sent the diversity of the population.
Independent commissions are al
ready in effect in Colorado, Mon
tana, and Hawaii, though none of
these cases is analagous to Califor
nia's, with its large geographic size,
and population and its high number
of congressional districts — a ger

rymandered paradise.
A democratically elected govern
ment such as ours should provide for
the representation of all its citizens.
But when the districts in which elec
tions take place are defined so as to
predetermine the outcomes and to
protect incumbants, this defeats the
purpose of elections altogether.
An independent commission, as
provided for on the currently
circulating petitions, may not prove
faultless. But it cannot be any worse
