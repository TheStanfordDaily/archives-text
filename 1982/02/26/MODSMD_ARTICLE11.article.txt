## El Salvador: what is best for them, or what is best for U.S.? 
### 
The various positions expressed in the Daily's Forum
on El Salvador (Feb. 24) all dealt in one way or another
principally with the questions of what is best for the peo
ple of El Salvador? All based their arguments on some
concept of what is going on in El Salvador; who is killing
who; and why various factions have acted as they have.
I would prefer to ask the question: what is best for the
people of the United States? And, I assert that we do not
and probably cannot know what is really going on in El
Salvador, nor do we need to know in order to find out
what is best for our own country.
Let me attempt to justify this apparently "selfish" con
cern. The United States is still, at least in my opinion, the
freest country in the world. I value freedom, and I think
that my countrymen do too, above all other aspects of
any political/economic system.
This freedom is derived directly from adherence to the
tenents of the U.S. Constitution with its division of
powers and its Bill of Rights, and from respect for the
principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence.
Certainly, I would like to see this system of protection of
individual freedom extended to the rest of the world,
but can this be accomplished by supplying arms and ar

mies to El Salvador? — at what price?
If the price is the sacrifice of our own freedom and the
system of government that we cherish, then it is ludi
crous and in no one's best interests. And, I submit, that
this is the price of commitment of our forces in El
Salvador, as it was in Vietnam, and as it will be in similar
conflicts, until our system is destroyed.
First, to enter into a civil war in a foreign country is
almost inevitably to fight an undeclared war. Picture
Congress giving the president s declaration of war
against a vaguely defined group of insurgents, or against
the "superpowers" that back them — highly unlikely.
Fighting undeclared wars, regardless of what the Su
preme Court has said, is unconstitutional, and it is
damned hard for soldiers to feel that they are "defend
ing the constitution" when they are fighting an un
constitutional war.
Second, these kinds of conflicts generally become
wars conducted from the executive branch of govern
ment. Since Congress is uncooperative, the president
comes to lie to Congress and to the people, and to main
tain a degree of executive secrecy that flies in the face of
the concept of a "president, not a king" intended by the

founding fathers. The balance of power envisioned by
them is subtroverted and the presidential oath of office
becomes a mockery.
Third, the Declaration of Independence clearly states
the commitment of this country to self-determination,
by revolution if necessary. Whether or not the revolu
tion in El Salvador represents the best interests of the
people, our opposition to it represents grinding into the
dust the very principle on which our system was created,
i.e., the right of a people to form a government of their
own design when their rights are not respected by the
current regime.
Fourth, the laws of the United States, from the Con
stitution to local ordinances all reflect that the lives and
liberties of individuals are not to be taken by the state ex
cept when those individuals violate the rights of others,
i.e., commit crimes, and then only by due process.
The soldier justifies his killing and capturing by the
"self-defense" argument and the argument that he is
protecting his country. Killing peasant revolutionaries in
a foreign land won't stand up by either justification. We
aren't enforcing our laws by our system of justice — it is a
foreign country! Neither are we defending our country

from attack. Ignoring our own concepts of legality and
justice can only serve to corrode our own security.
Finally, there is the draft. Unpopular wars cannot be
fought without conscription. The draft deprives a part of
our citizenry of their liberties, and often their lives, and is
therefore destructive of freedom. It is inevitable if we
persist in committing troops to conflicts such as that in El
Salvador.
The Vietnam war reached gigantic proportions before
it began to tear apart the fabric of American life in the'6os
and 70s — a testimony to the stability of American socie
ty. However, after the destruction of credibility that it
waged, I doubt that it will take so long if we commit more
forces to El Salvador.
The loss of integrity, the destruction of federal checks
and balances, the "shredding" of the constitution and
bill of rights, the destruction of founding principles, all
will eventually destroy the system we have and would
like to see spread.
The price of involvement in El Salvador is simply too
high.
