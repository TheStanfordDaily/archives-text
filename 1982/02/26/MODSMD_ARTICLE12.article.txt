## A
						review worth three pennies 
### 
During my four years at Stanford
I've read a lot of Daily reviews. Some I
agreed with, others I disagreed with
or thought were poorly written. But
Bryan Trevor's review of the Drama
Department's production of Three
Penny Opera (Daily, Feb. 23) is the
first that has actually made me angry
and concerned enough to write a let
ter to the Daily. In the review Trevor's
obsession with being a thorough
critic becomes more important than
the show he is supposed to be re
viewing.
Trevor's own misunderstanding of
his function as a drama critic be
comes evident early in the review
when he makes an unwarranted at
tack against Ram's Head. He calls
Ram's Head musicals "dorm shows
on a grand scale" and adds on a high
ly condescending note that they
"could never be accused of genuine
artistry or technical discipline," thriv
ing rather on "adolescent bravado."
Why the Daily permitted such ir
responsible writing to make it to the
page in the first place is incom
prehensible. Yet what is worse, while
occupying half of the leadingcolumn
of the review, his vindictive remarks
against Ram's Head have absolutely
no relevance to the Drama Depart
ment oroduction at all.
Through the rest of the article his
writing becomes so self-indulgent
that it makes me question his
motives. When he says that an actor
has "the authority but not the insou
ciance, the swagger or the engaging
raffishness â€” in short, the charm,"
why not just say "the charm?" Is he
trying to inform us or is he simply
sporting his new thesaurus?
He has in the past shown some
pretty fine writing. With this more re
cent article, however, I can't help but
feel that Trevor is using the Daily and
us, who read this opinion in print, to
prove his own intellectual prowess.
The point I am making is this; it is
one thing to give a thorough critical
review of a production, it is quite an
other to get carried away with over

intellectualizing. When beingexhibi
tionistic rather than being in
formative becomes the objective, all
that is left to see is the reviewer's ego,
not the merits of the particular pro
duction.
Perhaps Trevor should listen to his
previous review, and work within his

own "confines." Only then will he be
able to say what needs to be said, in
half the space, without getting so
caught up in being a "critic" that he
forgets who he's writing for, and why
his name appears in black and white.
