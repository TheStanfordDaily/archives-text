## Demonstrating concern for Polish refugees 
### 
As the crisis continues to develop
in Poland, the United States has qui
etly granted refugee status to
thousands of Poles currently residing
in Austrian transit camps. The flow of
Polish refugees to the United States
has in fact already begun, and is ex
pected to increase over the next few
months.
Due to a wide variety of reasons, a
sizeable proportion of these refu
gees will be coming to the Bay Area.
They will need your help.
The vast majority of the refugees
coming to the United States from Po
land are Solidarity (or other inde
pendent union) members. Many
were activists in the union before
martial law was imposed in Decem
ber 1981.
The following statement from
Miloslaw Buras, one of the Polish ref
ugees expected to arrive in the Unit
ed States soon, indicates succinctly
the kind of situation in which many
found themselves while in Poland:
"Since October 1980,1 was a mem

ber of the Independent Union of Stu
dents at the Academy of Agriculture
in Cracow, On November 4, 1980, I
was arrested for the first time for
sticking up posters. This was re
peated twice in 1981 and I was beaten
up for refusing cooperation, and
threatened repeatedly. I am unable
to return home because of reprisals."
Now Miroslaw and his compatriots
must start their new lives in America.
Single men and women (most of the
refugees are single) commonly arrive
in the United States with no more
than one small suitcase in their
possession. Most speak little English
and have no relatives in the country
to help them.
They do, however, usually possess
marketable skills. They tend to be
young, well-educated people from
the major urban centers of Poland.
When compared to other refugee
groups, these Poles are generally
well-equipped to make the difficult
transition to life in America. But, like
all refugees, they cannot make that

transition without timely and sub
stantial assistance from the com
munities into which they are reset
tled.
The Stanford community now hasa
great opportunity to demonstrate its
concern for these people and the na
tion from which they have fled. Refu
gees need all kinds of help. They
need to learn English, find housing,
start working and adapt to a new way
of life in the States.
As a refugee resettlement counsel
or for the past two years, I can assure
you that it is not an easy task to pro
vide these services to refugees.
Sometimes it is rather frustrating; but
it can be a uniquely rewarding ex
perience when done effectively. I am
convinced that, with the almost lim
itless resources available to the
greater Stanford community, effec
tive resettlement aid could be pro
vided to these new refugees.
