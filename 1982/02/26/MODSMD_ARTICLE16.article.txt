The Stanford women's
basketball team hasdone it â€” it
has virtually assured itself a
spot in the NCAA regional
playoffs with last night's victory
on the road against Fresno
State. The final score was 74-64.
The Cardinal beat the Lady
Bulldogs earlier this year 77-70,
but Fresno State is known for its
staying power.
The Lady Bulldogs led
throughout the first half and
were up at halftime 39-35.
Then, with three minutes re
maining in the game, Fresno hit
and cold streak, while at the
same time the Stanford attack
came alive, as the Cardinal
scored six straight points.
Junior center Meg Metzger
led the scoring for Stanford
with 25 points, before fouling
out in the game's final seconds.
With her outstanding play this
season, Metzer is a sure bet for
All-Conference honors.
Metzer, who took over the
center position after junior
Kim Kupferer got hurt earlier
in the year, has earned top
scoring honors in eight games
so far this season.
Stanford seniors played par
ticularly well against Fresno
State. Louise Smith, absent in
the last game against the Lady
Bulldogs, scored 13 points and
was strong throughout the
game. Guard Anne Miller
played her usual aggressive de
fense, as well as contributing

six assists. Point-guard Debi
Gore also played well.
Currently, Stanford stands
second behind UC-Berkely in
the Northern California Athlet
ic Conference However,
Berkeley is a member of the
AIAW while Stanford belongs
to the NCAA, and therefore
will not compete with the
Cardinal for a playoff spot.
Stanford has spent most of
the season battling San Jose
State for second position. Last
night's win gives the Cardinal a
solid two game lead over the
Spartans.
Under head coach Dotty
McCrea's leadership, Stanford
has battled its way into the top
32 teams in women's basket
ball.
The Cardinal plays its final
regular season game at the
University of San Francisco
next Wednesday. The next stop
will be the playoffs in mid-
March here at Maples Pavilion.
