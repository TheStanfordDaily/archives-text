### Mark Kerber 
The Cardinal has been un
known in wrestling circles in
recent years. But the resurgent
grapplers may have a few sur
prises for the reigning West
Coast powers when they
gather for the Conference
Championships at Maples Pa
vilion Sunday.
Doug Perkins is the

Cardinal's worst kept secret.
After finishing third in the
Pac-10 last year, the exciting
177-pounder is one of the fa
vorites for the conference
crown.
Freshman Ed Katz at 190
pounds and sophomore Tom
Mullen at 167 pounds also fig
ure to be factors in the meet.
In the other weight classes,

Brad Hightower will compete
at 126 pounds, Derrick
Strahorn at 134, Brigham John
son at 142, Bruce Rubin at 150,
and Jody Williams at 158.
