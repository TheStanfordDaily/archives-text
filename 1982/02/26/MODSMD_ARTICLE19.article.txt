# Card ends home season
## 
### Steve Odell Senior sports writer 
The Stanford men's basket
ball team — depleted to essen
tially an eight man roster be
cause of injuries, defeated in 12
of their last 13 games, and de
moted to last place in the Pacif
ic-10 after two losses in Los An
geles last weekend — close out
their 1981-82 home season this
weekend against Arizona and
Arizona State.
The Wildcats (2-12 con
ference, 7-16 overall) invade
Maples Pavilion Saturday night
and are in ninth place in the
Pac-10. Sixth place ASU (5-9,
10-13) is due tonight. Both
games begin at 8 p.m.
The last time these three
teams collided, Stanford blew
early opportunities and came
home with two losses.
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
explained what his team will
have to do differently to pre
vent what happened in the Ari
zona desert a month ago from
happening again. "We'll have
to do a better job blocking
out," he said. "And both teams
play a lot of zone. We will have
to execute our zone offense
better and hit the boards in or
der to get second shots."
This weekend's games mark
the last two home appearances
for Dißiaso, who announced

his resignation to become ef
fective at the end of the season
on Feb. 5. It is also the last
Maples Pavilion performances
for Cardinal seniors Brian
Welch, Orlando Ward, and
Doug Marty.
Dißiaso warned his team
could not afford to get in a run
ning game with either team,
because he is down to basically
a three-man bench behind his
starters. "We cannot afford,
either Friday or Saturday," he
said, "to get into an uptempo
game. We've had a whole week
to practice with Brian (Welch)
at our second guard on offense
and defense. We're going to try
to turn our lack of depth into
an advantage somehow."
Forward Ward might see
"minimal action at best," ac
cording to Dißiaso because of
knee tendonitis that has been
bothering him since early Feb
ruary. And swingman Roger
Lemons is out with strained
knee ligaments he suffered last
week in practice.
That makes five players on
the hardluck Cardinal who are
missing from action who
started at one time or another
last season. The other three are
Hans Wichary (foot stress frac
ture), Keith Jones (academic
problems), and Terry Smith (in
jured back.)

There is one more thing
Stanford will have to do — stop
Lafayette "Fat" Lever.
Lever is an All-America can
didate guard for the Sun Devils
who exploded for a school rec
ord 38 points last Saturday in an
82-56-thrashing over Arizona.
Lever also collected a career
high 13 rebounds, made seven
steals, and had six assists.
The other Devil guard, Paul
Williams, stands six-foot-six
and is averaging 16.7 points a
game.
Stanford could possibly
emerge out of the cellar with a
victory over Arizona. The Wild
cats are the only Pac-10 team to
come close to having as dismal
season as the Cardinal have
had, having lost four straight
games to put them just one
half game ahead of the
Cardinal in the conference
standings. UA is in a similar sit
uation as Stanford is another
respect — head coach Fred
Snowden resigned earlier in
the year.
Dißiaso expressed concern
over the explosive Wildcat for
ward tandem of Greg Cook
(14.0 ppg) and six-foot-10 Greg
Cook (13.9 ppg).
"Smith and Cook can pose
problems inside with their ag
gressive rebounding and scor
ing," Dißiaso said.

10-13) is due tonight. Both
games begin at 8 p.m.
The last time these three
teams collided, Stanford blew
early opportunities and came
home with two losses.
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
explained what his team will
have to do differently to pre
vent what happened in the Ari
zona desert a month ago from
happening again. "We'll have
to do a better job blocking
out," he said. "And both teams
play a lot of zone. We will have
to execute our zone offense
better and hit the boards in or
der to get second shots."
This weekend's games mark
the last two home appearances
for Dißiaso, who announced

his resignation to become ef
fective at the end of the season
on Feb. 5. It is also the last
Maples Pavilion performances
for Cardinal seniors Brian
Welch, Orlando Ward, and
Doug Marty.
Dißiaso warned his team
could not afford to get in a run
ning game with either team,
because he is down to basically
a three-man bench behind his
starters. "We cannot afford,
either Friday or Saturday," he
said, "to get into an uptempo
game. We've had a whole week
to practice with Brian (Welch)
at our second guard on offense
and defense. We're going to try
to turn our lack of depth into
an advantage somehow."
Forward Ward might see
"minimal action at best," ac
cording to Dißiaso because of
knee tendonitis that has been
bothering him since early Feb
ruary. And swingman Roger
Lemons is out with strained
knee ligaments he suffered last
week in practice.
That makes five players on
the hardluck Cardinal who are
missing from action who
started at one time or another
last season. The other three are
Hans Wichary (foot stress frac
ture), Keith Jones (academic
problems), and Terry Smith (in
jured back.)

There is one more thing
Stanford will have to do — stop
Lafayette "Fat" Lever.
Lever is an All-America can
didate guard for the Sun Devils
who exploded for a school rec
ord 38 points last Saturday in an
82-56-thrashing over Arizona.
Lever also collected a career
high 13 rebounds, made seven
steals, and had six assists.
The other Devil guard, Paul
Williams, stands six-foot-six
and is averaging 16.7 points a
game.
Stanford could possibly
emerge out of the cellar with a
victory over Arizona. The Wild
cats are the only Pac-10 team to
come close to having as dismal
season as the Cardinal have
had, having lost four straight
games to put them just one
half game ahead of the
Cardinal in the conference
standings. UA is in a similar sit
uation as Stanford is another
respect — head coach Fred
Snowden resigned earlier in
the year.
Dißiaso expressed concern
over the explosive Wildcat for
ward tandem of Greg Cook
(14.0 ppg) and six-foot-10 Greg
Cook (13.9 ppg).
"Smith and Cook can pose
problems inside with their ag
gressive rebounding and scor
ing," Dißiaso said.
