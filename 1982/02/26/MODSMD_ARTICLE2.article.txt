# Heating 'experiment' gets chilly reception
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
An attempt on the part of a Univer
sity official to save energy early this
week resulted in several days without
heat for many residents of the Row as
well as some criticism of the handling
of the experiment.
After observing windows and
doors regularly being, left open,
Heloisa Edwards, manager of the
Row and Cluster Facilities Office,
sent a memo to residents of Delta
Kappa Epsilon (Deke), Delta Upsilon
(DU) and Beta Theta Pi (Beta)
fraternity houses Feb. 16, informing
them of her decision to turn off their
heat that evening for a one-week pe
riod as an experiment.
Members of the DU house called
Edwards the next day complaining
that the house was too cold without
heat, and the heat in their house was
restored that Thursday morning.
On Feb. 17, Edwards decided that it
was unjust to single out the
fraternities as the only participants in
the energy conservation experiment,
and she wrote each of the Row
houses, asking for responses from
residents on her proposal to turn
off the heat for a week in all Row
and cluster residences.
Although she received mixed re
sponses from Row and cluster house
managers in a meeting held last Fri
day, the warm weather over the
weekend encouraged Edwards to go
ahead with her plan, and on Sunday
she ordered the heat for all cluster
housing to be turned down to the pi
lot light. She continued the experi
ment on Monday, ordering the heat
for all Row houses turned off as well.
The decision proved to be a mis
take.
"Monday and Tuesday were the
coldest days in probably three
weeks," Edwards said. "I just got un
lucky."
By Tuesday complaints from
chilled residents began pouring into
Edwards' office, and the heat was
turned back on in ail residences that
evening.
Reaction to the experiment varied
drastically. Some students supported
the effort to reduce energy bills and
were appreciative of the speed with
which their calls for heat were
heeded. Others criticized Edwards
for failing to give more advance no
tice of the heat reduction or for sing

ling out their houses for the experi
ment.
"They were really responsive,"
Grace Carter, a house manager at
Roth, said. "We called them and they
turned the heat right back on."
"I think we share the same basic
concern for conserving energy and
saving money," she continued. "But
it might be a little bit early in the sea
son for turning off the heat com
pletely."
Howard Sewell, house manager for
the Dekes, said that his house went
about seven days with the heat
turned down.
"We realized that it was a cons
cientious effort to save energy,"
Sewell said "It was a fair experi
ment."
"Finally,"he continued, "it got a
little too cold. We don't pay this
much money to go to bed freezing at
night."
Doug Sunde, DU House Manager,
agreed about the the high price they
were paying to be cold but was less
understanding of Edwards' motiva
tions in selecting three fraternities
for the initial experiment.
"When it gets down to 40 degrees
at night, and 45 inside the house, I
think that it's unreasonable living
conditions," Sunde said.
"We feel that that she's trying to
make some attack on fraternities
rather than a conservation move," he
continued. "If she had been making
a conservation move, she would have
gone after the housesthat were using
the most energy, and she certainly
did not do that."
Sunde explained that the DU
house is operating 10 percent below
its rate of energy use for last year
while other Row housesare consum
ing at much higher rates.
The poorly-timed weather and at
tendant criticism didn't bother Ed
wards, however. She immediately
launched into an alternative plan of
energy conservation, utilizing timers
that will turn the heat on during peri
ods most desired by residents, gener
ally from 7-10 p.m. and 5-8 a.m.
"However," Edwards said, "some
of the houses have three heating sys
tems that will need timers, and this
may take some time."
While some houses were com
plaining about the loss of heat, Ed
wards said that others had voluntarily
shut off their heat.
"Warm hearts are better than
warm feet," said Cynthia Vitt-jarvis,
resident advisor at Synergy House,
where residents decided to turn off
the heat for the rest of the winter
more than a week ago.
Vitt-jarvis said the decision was
reached because residents felt the
house was using too much natural
gas "for a house that prides itself on
being energy conscious."
Edwards promised that the heat
would remain on in all residences,
either with timers or without, until
the residents request the heat turned
off.
"The cold weather and the heat
I've gotten from the students won't
stop me," Edwards said. "I'll just try
to think and do things more careful
ly-"
"Heloisa will strike again â€” I have
not given up," she said.
