# Steve Odell: Keep pro basketball gimmicks out of the college game

We do not need a shot clock
in college basketball.
If we want to turn the game
of college basketball, the love
ly piece of artwork that it is,
into a slightly less glorified pro
game, then by all means, insert
the stupid thing.
The problem with basket
ball, on the professional level
especially, is that the
rulemakers keep tampering
with the game.
Now we don't even have
jump balls. Jump balls, for
crying out loud! They used to
jump ball after every basket in
the good ol' days. Not to say
that this is what we need now,
but leave a few jump balls in
there for the sake of tradition,
if nothing else.
The National Collegiate Ath

letic Association seems to think
that a change in the rules will
enhance the game. Leave the
game alone! Slow down games
are very far and few between,
and they keep the sport from
getting into a serious rut of pre
dictability.
People are crying because
the scoring is down a bit this
year. But seriously, think about
it, is a one-point game decided
in the final seconds more excit
ing if the final score is 71-70 in
stead of 55-54?
Bringing in a shot clock
would disassemble the parity
that has so painstakingly been
established and which has
made it impossible for one
team to dominate the No. 1
spot. Without a shot clock, less
talented teams can challenge
the big boys on the block

through discipline, execution,
and strategy.
The biggest crime about in
serting a shot clock in col
legiate basketball, though, is
that it takes away so much of
the strategy that belongs to col
lege hoops and no other sport.
One need only remember
back to 1977, in the NCAA
finals between Marquette and
North Carolina, between Al
McGuire and Dean Smith, be
tween two utterly genius
coaches and two exceptionally
talented teams.
It was a chess game, played
by two masters with finely
crafted pieces. It was a battle of
the wits. And it was one of the
greatest college basketball
games ever played.
Professional basketball issuf

fering from a lack of popu
larity. Attendance is down.
Watching a regular season
game is like watching rat ball.
One wonders if NBA Com
misioner Larry O'Brien has per
haps tried to play God just one
too many times, destroying the
beauty and excitement that is
inherent in the game James
Naismith created almost a cen
tury ago.
This column is not an at
tempt to downgrade the NBA.
Pro basketball has probably
the finest athletes in the world,
and it is making a resurgence.
Rather, it is a caution to the
NCAA: leave well enough
alone, instead of creating a
cheap imitation and taking
away so much strategy that is
college basketball.
