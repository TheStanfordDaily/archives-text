## Sunday brunching at the Peninsula's finest The 						Gatehouse

Gatehouse
265 Lytton Ave.

If you have plenty of money
and don't know where to
spend it all, a Sunday brunch at
Palo Alto's Gatehouse will
probably do the trick.
If you're simplydyingtoeata
Sunday brunch at the
Gatehouse because you've
heard so much about it, but
you subsist on a student's
budget, it might not be a bad
idea to wait until the folks
come out at the end of the
year.
In other words, if you

haven't picked it up already,
Sunday brunch at the
Gatehouse is ex-pen-sive. And
in truth, this should probably
come as no surprise. The
Gatehouse has a long tradition
of excellence. Its decor is
elegant, it has a beautiful out
side terrace in the sun, the ser
vice is considerate and the
food is generally of high quali
ty. Plus, there's complimentary
champagne or orange juice.
So why all the complaining
about a lousy $11 per person
for all that food? Well, maybe it
just seems that there are many
lower-priced and lesser
known but equally-nice
brunches in Palo Alto. And

also, there seems to be little
logic in paying more than $11
for a buffet style ("all you can
eat") brunch.
I, for one, don't often feel
like stuffing my face to make
sure I get $12 worth of food
before noon. Not only does the
quality of the food become
wasted on a bloated stomach,
but it makes you feel like
spending the rest of the day in
bed.
As buffets go, though, the
Gatehouse has a pretty spec
tacular one. It consists of three
very burdened tables — one
for salads, one for main dishes
and one for dessert. The salad
table holds about 15 bowls and

platters, each carrying a dif
ferent salad or salad-like sub
stance. They range from thinly
sliced pieces of ham and turkey
to unusual spicy concoctions of
vegetables. And, of course,
there's fruit. And even some
salad. Plenty of it, as a matter of
fact.
As might be expected, the
salad table held enough food
for several brunches. But no.
Onward to the main dishes,
where trays of good-but-not
spectacular eggs benedict, ex
cellent cheese blintzes, big,
crispy pieces of bacon, slightly
greasy sausage and barbecued
pork ribs wiated. Naturally, I
felt obligated to sample a little

of each, which was more than a
little too much.
After all this food, and more
than a couple glasses of that
complimentary champagne,
any normal person would
probably pay the bill and bolt
for the door, right? But that's
not the way it seems to work at
the Gatehouse, for me or most
of the people sitting near me.
You gotta go grab one, at least
one, of those desserts. Even
when you know you didn't in
tend to stuff yourself at that
hour.
My date and I both chose
good-sized "bearclaws,"
stuffed with a sweet honey
filler. They were decent, but

didn't seem particularly fresh. I
suspected as much, but figured
they would be better than the
large red jello mold or the sug
ar-intense cake. I guess I'll nev
er know.
Just about the time we were
finishing our desserts, our
waitress came around with
some much-needed coffee.
Carried only by the ensuing
caffeine rush, I was able to pull
myself from my chair and
leave.
All told, the Gatehouse is a
fine place to stuff yourself in
style. On a student's budget,
however, it's just not quite
worth the price.
