pelicious, mouth-water
inf and absolutely de
ligitful are just a few words
th.t accurately describe the
Suiday champagne brunch
at-hez Justine.
or $9.95 per adult ($7.95

cesfully melt their Saturday
ni ht fiesta into a perfect
Snday morning continua
ticn of the weekend.
Jpon being seated, we
wire overwhelmed by the
brght, colorful, and sunny
atnosphere created by the
geenery and skylight
abve. This was a perfect
ccnpliment to the Spanish
st le decor.
A/e were immediately
geeted by our waiter who
p»ured Chateau Saint
Gorges champagne and
offee, and throughout our
rr?al promptly cared for ev
ey need.
We began by serving
oirselves fresh fruit. All that
isrnaginable was set out in a
l</ish display surrounding a
hge fruit wagon center
pece garnished with bright
f)wers.
Fresh kiwi, figs, melons,
(trus fruits, peaches, pears,
I'htly sweetened straw
ferries, pineapple and
liked apples were individ
ully laid in huge platters,
•irrounded by sweet rolls,
luffins and all the butter
<ne could need. This first
ourse was fresh and incom
arable.
Moving to the main
ourse, we found servings
>112 traditional breakfast
oods, as well as the not-so
raditional, all kept piping
lot in generous warmers.
The scrambled eggs, light
and fluffy, could be com
plimented by perfectly
cooked bacon strips or ham
— neither of which were ov
erpoweringly salty* The
hash browns were cooked
to perfection and not mushy
or * *"*
Eggs benedict were
served along with a de
licious seafood plate con
sisting of scallops, crab,
shrimp and covered by a
delicate mornay sauce.
Crepes, filled with flaked
chicken and covered by a
cream sauce, were light and
tasty. And the liver,

smothered in brown sauce,
offered a nice contrast to a
traditional morning meal.
Our plates were filled by
this lovely food and our ap
petites were more than sat
isfied. I can't think of any
thing else I would want in a
brunch.
The true temptations
were still to be tasted. The
beautifully arranged dessert
table featured huge bowls
of chocolate mousse
topped with strawberries.
Near the mousse, sat trays of
pastries.
The apple pastry, loaded
with applies, cinnamon,
butter, and surrounded by
thin pastry dough was light,
flaky and a wonderful
treat.
A platter of little pastries,
such as one consisting of a

cookie base topped with
cake and chocolate icing
with a hint of liquer was in
the midst of the dessert
table. This was impossible to
pass by.
The cheese blintzes, deli
cately prepared, were by far
my favorite. The crepe, tast
ing a hint of orange com
bined with the berry sauce
which topped it made a de
lightful dessert.
Who can resist this beau
tiful buffet? Probably no
one — and no one should —
as this is a wonderful op
portunity to enjoy an ex
quisite meal in an im
maculate, fresh at
mosphere. The service is ex
cellent — the food even
more so — and the price is
exceptionally right.
