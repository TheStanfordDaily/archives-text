This weekend I visited the
Mardis Gras in New Orleans!
Or did I?
Now that I think back, I guess
the furthest I traveled was just
down El Camino to Bourbon
Street, a cafe in the Old Mill
with the distinct air of New Or
leans.
As we entered the Old Mill,
my date (as I shall call her) and I
were beckoned by the strum of
jazz musicians across the pond.
We approached the trio and
found ourselves in the midst of
fast-paced waiters and
waitresses, all in full costume in
celebration of the Mardis Gras.
Our maitre d' gave us the
choice of an intimate dimly-lit
table for two inside the restau
rant or an umbrella-topped
table on the patio. We chose
the latter because it gave us full
view of the pond, the fish, the
mall, and the diners at neigh
boring restaurants. (Besides,
Sunday brunch is not the op
timum time for intimacy.)
Once seated, we were
promptly greeted by our
waitress who offered us the
selection of any of their exotic
drinks. I chose the Hurricane, a
most attractive drink which un
fortunately offered a less at
tractive taste. My date selected

the New Orleans Fizz, also at
tractive but equally distasteful.
(We concluded that what the
drinks lack in alcohol, they
make up for in appearance.)
From there the meal quickly
improved. We began with the
pastry and fruit buffet. This in
cluded an elegant array of
mangos, pineapple, grapefruit
segments, watermelon and
almost every fruit in season,
along with lettuce salad, dainty
cinnamon pastries, and five as
sorted varieties of cheeses
(Buffet alone is $6.25).
This would have been a meal
in itself, but no review is com

plete without a sampling of the
entrees. I ordered the Pain Per
du ($7.25 including buffet)
which is Cajun french toast
sprinkled with powdered sug
ar. Alongside came a silver de
canter of syrup and a ceramic
pot of jelly, both of which en
hanced the already tasty item.
My date ordered the Shirred
eggs ($7.75 including buffet) at
our waitress' suggestion. This
unique dish came with smoked
sausage and Creole sauce
served bayou style. She en
joyed the platter, which she
couldn't quite finish, but said it
was a bit spicier than she would

have preferred.
Glancing at other tables, I
noticed an immense variety of
other selections I would have
liked to try, had I had the time
and the appetite. Unfortunate
ly, the somewhat slow service
makes Bourbon Street the kind
of place to go if you want a par
ticularly leisurely brunch.
I have no hesitations about
sending anyone to Bourbon
Street for their Sunday brunch.
I he ambiance is elegant, clean,
and fun; the hearty portions,
delicious. A most enjoyable af
ternoon!
