You've got to treat yourself
right in life.
One of the best ways to do
this on a sunny Sunday morn
ing is to grab yourself a cute
Texan with a fast sports car,
peel back the top (of the car!)
and head out to brunch.
Sunday brunch is meant to
be a celebration of life and it's
vital that the restaurant you
choose takes its Sunday brunch
service seriously.
Hugo's puts on a very serious
Sunday brunch (munch).
Your waiter (Glenn, in our
case) sets upon you instantly,
prepared, it would seem, to sat
isfy your every pleasure for the
next two hours.
"Champagne?" he asks po
litely. "Fresh-squeezed orange
juice?"

In a moment glasses are filled
and emptied of the most de
licious mixture of orange juice
and champagne you ever
rolled across your parched,
morning breath scented
tongue, and heaven can't be
far off. Nor is it!
Wasting neither time nor
formality, we passovera tempt
ing selection of breakfast en
trees for the brunch we came
for.
Wondrous arrays of fruit and
vegetable salads enticed us,
meats and stuffings entranced
us and plate after plate we
filled until we could hold no
more.
But more there was: cakes
and sundaes, cookies and can
dies, if only we'd have saved
some for dessert. Oh well,
merely an excuse to return for
another Sunday brunch at
Hugo's.
