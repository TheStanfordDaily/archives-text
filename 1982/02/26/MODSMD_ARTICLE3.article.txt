Watt cited for contempt of Congress
Washington — The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted
23-19 yesterday to cite Interior Secretary James Watt for contempt of
Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents.
The vote, which could lead to a major constitutional confrontation
between the House and the Reagan administration, came after Demo
cratic critics accused Watt of a pattern of obstructionism in an investiga
tion that began last July.
If the contempt citation goes to the House floor and the House con
curs in it, Watt could be brought to trial in a U.S. District Court or, in a
seldom-used alternative, arrested and tried by the House itself. The
penalty on conviction would be a fine of up to $1000 and a jail sentence
of up to 12 months.
Researchers said yesterday they could find no modern example in
which a Cabinet officer was cited for contempt by a house of Congress.
The House Intelligence Committee voted to cite former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger in 1975, but the case was settled before it reached
the House floor. In two more recent cases, citations voted by subcom
mittees never reached the full committees.
The Watt vote was along party lines except for one Democrat who
voted against the citation and one Republican voting for it.
Committee Democrats charged Watt withheld many documents for
weeks and has still refused tp turn over between seven and 11 docu
ments related to an administration study of Canada's oil policy.
Republicans retorted that Watt was being assailed for strictly partisan
reasons because of his controversial policies at Interior or pilloried by
foes who dislike his manner.
In a statement later, Interior spokesman Douglas Baldwin
said only seven documents are still in dispute, all of them
protected on orders of President Ronald Reagan. The case of
executive privilege probably will be resolved by the Su
preme Court, he said.
The administration contends the remaining documents
fall under executive privilege because of foreign policy con
siderations or because they represent internal discussions at
the Cabinet level.
The affair began last year when the committee's oversight
subcommittee sought details on an administration inquiry
into Canada's new energy policy, which some American
firms think is discriminatory against U.S. oil companies.
Watt originally was asked to answer a series of questions
and to turn over more than 200 documents. In response to
continuing committee pressure, Watt has submitted all but
seven or 11 of them (the exact number is disputed). They are
said to involve State Department cables or accounts of Cabi
net deliberations which the White House insists are pro
tected by executive privilege claims.
Dingell said yesterday the committee sought the docu
ments "so we could know how well the law was working,
how well he was doing his job and what, if anything, needed
to be changed," Dingell said. "His response was to hugger
mugger the documents that would have answered those
questions. When we pushed our point, he ran to the presi
dent."
Inflation down, unemployment up
Washington — A worsening recession held inflation to a
3.5 percent annual rate in January, the lowest pace since the
nation was in the throes of its last recession 18 months ago,
according to government figures released yesterday.
Economists also announced that unemployment, now at
8.5 percent, will rise to 9 percent by next year, the highest
rate since World War 11.
Food prices showed a large rise for the first time in four
months, mainly because of rocketing increases for fresh veg
etables and fruit, and medical care continued to post large
price jumps. However, housing costs rose only slightly and
transportation and clothing costs actually declined from De
cember, reflecting recession-dampened consumer demand.
Overall, the Labor Department reported, consumer prices
increased 0.3 percent during the first month of 1982, the
smallest increase since July 1980, when the economy was at
the bottom of a short but steep recession. If January's rise
were to be repeated for the rest of the year, the annual rate
would be 3.5 percent.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said the
January figure shows "a continuing trend of improvement"
in the inflation rate. "We have reduced it by one-third," he
said, referring to a decline from 12.4 percent in 1980 to 8.9
percent in 1981.
Private economists said President Ronald Reagan's success
with inflation is being achieved at the cost of a severe re
cession and high unemployment — a point conceded by
chief White House economist Murray Weidenbaum.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker, whose
anti-inflationary tight-money policy has been blamed for

causing the recession, conceded before the same group that
the improved inflation outlook has "been achieved partly at
the expense of unemployment and savage pressureson prof
its of many companies."
However, "high unemployment and a depressed econo
my can't be an acceptable base for sustaining" the fight
against inflation, Volcker added.
Town evacuated after toxic leak
Greensboro, Ca. — Eleven cars of a Georgia Railroad train
derailed yesterday near downtown Greensboro, leaking a
toxic chemical and forcing the evacuation of most of the
town's 2985 residents, officials said.
Mayor James Smith said a state of emergency was declared
after the 6:50 a.m. derailment off the 27-car train.
No injuries were reported, and the cause of the accident
was not immediately determined.
Harry Murphy, spokesman for .1 he state Department of
Transportation, identified the chemical as phosphorus
trichloride.
Smith said the substance "when breathed in high concen
trations can cause skin burns and lung damage."
City Clerk Charlton Veazey said the chemical could ex
plode when mixed with water, so city workers were closing
off sewer lines. The National Weather Service predicted a
chance of rain later in the day.
"The majority of the citizens of Greensboro have been
evacuated by noon," said Veazey. Most were taken to Union
Point, seven miles east.
Israeli ambassador hints at attack
Washington — Israel's new ambassador hinted strongly
yesterday that his nation may soon ordera military strike into
Southern Lebanon if there is no abatement of the arms
buildup by Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) forces.
Moshe Arens told reporters the danger to Israel is "grow
ing day by day"and "you might almost say it's a matter of
time" before his government feels compelled to take"some
action that would bring about casualties."
Such a development would be certain to exacerbate ten
sions throughout the region. President Ronald Reagan's spe
cial Mideast negotiator, Philip Habib, was dispatched to the
area this week in another attempt to head off hostilities.
Arens, who just last week presented hiscredentials to Rea
gan as Israel's ambassador, stopped short of predicting a pre
emptive strike by Israel into Lebanon that could break the
existing cease-fire, although he didn't rule it out.
He made clear, however, he believes there is a greater like
lihood of a provocation by the PLO, such as shelling into Is
rael, that could ignite a retaliatory strike.
The only sure way to prevent such a conflict, he said,
would be "to find some way to disarm the PLO."
Arens said the PLO is being supplied with heavy Soviet
guns which are being paid for by Saudi Arabia. He said the
PLO and Syria now control virtually all of Lebanon except for
the small portions run by Israeli-supported Christian ele
ments.
Arens said Israel is losing its military advantage over its
Arab neighbors, and said the United States is partly to blame
because it is selling the most sophisticated weapons it has to

countries like Saudi Arabia.
The loss of military advantage, Arens said, "is pushing Is
rael into a corner where it has no choice but to take pre
emptive action" if the trend continues.
Liberals abandon anti-busing filibuster
Washington — Senate liberals led by Lowell Weicker (R-
Conn.) yesterday abandoned a months-long battle to block
tough new anti-busing legislation, clearing the way for cer
tain Senate approval of the bill early next week.
Weicker, running out of supporters on the floor, calledoff
a filibuster against the bill that had kept the Senate in session
until 1:30 a.m. yesterday.
A final vote on the bill, which would impose stringent
curbs on court-ordered busing to achieve racial balance in
public schools, was scheduled for Tuesday. Senators favoring
the bill are in a solid majority.
The liberals had fought the legislation for nine months,
and still had 70hoursof debate remaining before Senate M
ajority Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) vowed to end the
filibuster.
"I intend to finish this bill," Baker said before Weicker and
his allies, who had been using Senate rules to postpone a
final vote, gave up the fight.
Polish leaders crack down
Warsaw — The country's Communist leaders called yester
day for a crackdown on opposition and said expectations
that martial law restrictions would be eased soon were "too
optimistic," a party source said.
A high-ranking military official also said anti-state activity
was now aimed toward Poland's armed forces, and he de
manded a stop to these "perfidious actions."
The 200-member Central Committee was expected to ap
prove the state of emergency declared Dec. 13 by party chief
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski. It appeared determined to end
the era of the independent Solidarity union, returning Po
land to a rigid socialist system practiced in other Soviet-bloc
nations.
Jaruzelski, speaking to the committee Wednesday,
blamed U.S. policy and internal opposition for slowing his
timetable to ease martial law restrictions by the end of Febru
ary.
