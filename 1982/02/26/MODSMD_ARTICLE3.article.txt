Watt cited for contempt of Congress
Washington — The House Energy and Commerce Committee voted
23-19 yesterday to cite Interior Secretary James Watt for contempt of
Congress for refusing to turn over subpoenaed documents.
The vote, which could lead to a major constitutional confrontation
between the House and the Reagan administration, came after Demo
cratic critics accused Watt of a pattern of obstructionism in an investiga
tion that began last July.
If the contempt citation goes to the House floor and the House con
curs in it, Watt could be brought to trial in a U.S. District Court or, in a
seldom-used alternative, arrested and tried by the House itself. The
penalty on conviction would be a fine of up to $1000 and a jail sentence
of up to 12 months.
Researchers said yesterday they could find no modern example in
which a Cabinet officer was cited for contempt by a house of Congress.
The House Intelligence Committee voted to cite former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger in 1975, but the case was settled before it reached
the House floor. In two more recent cases, citations voted by subcom
mittees never reached the full committees.
The Watt vote was along party lines except for one Democrat who
voted against the citation and one Republican voting for it.
Committee Democrats charged Watt withheld many documents for
weeks and has still refused tp turn over between seven and 11 docu
ments related to an administration study of Canada's oil policy.
Republicans retorted that Watt was being assailed for strictly partisan
reasons because of his controversial policies at Interior or pilloried by
foes who dislike his manner.
