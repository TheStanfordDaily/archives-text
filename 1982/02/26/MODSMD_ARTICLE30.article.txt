## Thelonious Sphere Monk 
### Ted Gioia 
Even those who only glance casually at newspaper 112
obituaries were probably intrigued by the recent
appearance there of the name Thelonious Sphere Mopk.,
Yet those familiar with the music of Monk, the jazz pi Jnlst
who passed away on Feb. 17, would doubtless argue'
that the man's compositions were every bit as peculiar as his !
singular name. J.
Fans perceived something quasi-mystical abou| Msnk^^
The hipsters dubbed him the "high priest of bopll^fcut
though his demeanor may have struck some as somehow
priestly, his music bore only the most tangential l|pl||
resemblances to bebop. Indeed it bore little relation to
anythingelseinjazz. jf L
At times one could perceive the influence of Monk's
predecessors on his playing, but these stylistic echoes of the
past sounded fresh and new when they
into Monk's sparse and rhythmicmusic. Several years bpck,
jazz archivists stumbled upon some tapes of Monk made
when the pianist was still young and l/rgely unknown,
the influence of stride and swing pianists,'such as Art fatum
and Teddy Wilson, was clearly evident. But within a few
years Monk had pushed these influencesinto the
background, and had acquired that starkly dissonant
approach to the piano that was uniquely his own.
Those fond of technical analysis will point out t||Stne 19
distinctive sound of Monk's music stems from hislj»pf ■}
whole-tone scales, minor seconds, and various forms of
dissonance. In fact, these were the most banal elements of
Monk's playing. More important was rhe crazy sort of logic
in Monk's music that almost defies technical analysis.. Monk
typically bases his compositions on the mosjrblnrjfe musical
motifs, yet he develops these lop-sided such
serious persistence thatone wonders whether there is not
some hidden Chopinesque beauty to them after all. With
Monk, as with Buster Keaton, the ever present poker-face
half-convinces us that we perceive as odd is actually quite
normal, or if not, it is only our own warped fpag/
prevents it from being so. Monk is ultimately like the'
rhetorician who takes an absurd argument to fits logical

( onclusion; what we end up with is quite peculiar yet how
or at what point it becomes so is never really clear,
of its oddity, Monk's playing has had a way of
imitators. Those who tried to sound like Monk
inevitably succeeded only in sounding likea gross parody of
Monk, With Monk's playing, as with an impressionist
painting, the more one seizes on details, the more the total
effect is bound to be neglected, and with Monk it was only
that the imitators pounced upon.
This is not to say that Monk did not influence other
important musicians. Like any creditable high priest, Monk
Jiad his share of disciples. Randy Weston, Steve Lacy,
Charlie Rouse, McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Rowles, Barry Harris,
and even Bud Powell, the founder of modern jazz piano, all
came under the spell of Monk's music. But they were never
so foolhardly as to attempt to sound just like Monk; they
r eali/ed that with Monk, as with the heavyweight boxing
c hampion or the fastest gun-slinger in Dodge City, they
were dealing with someone of whom there could be one
andonjyone.
Monk, always reclusive, became even more so during the
last decade of his life. Recordings and performances, for the
rpost part, simply did not take place. But Monk, even at his
most private, was also publicly accessible in a crazy sort of
way. His phone number was listed in the Manhattan phone
book; even after his face appeared on the cover of Time
magazine, he saw no reason to acquire an unlisted number.
Neighbors of Monk were familiar with his hatted figure as
he strolled to and fro. What made Monk a recluse was not
the fact that one could not get in touch with him (that was in
fact quite easy) but that even within his presence one felt
distant or like a stranger.
in the world of jazz, where eccentricity is almost a
prerequisite to fame, Monk was in a way the ultimate
eccentric. His unique, often odd behavior went beyond
mannerism and lifestyle and into the crevices of his music.
But it is with this unique perspective that Monk was able to
create music that still sounds fresh almost a generation after
it was made, and will, one suspects, sound just as fresh, and
amusing, and cryptic years from now.

Monk, With Monk's playing, as with an impressionist

that the imitators pounced upon.
This is not to say that Monk did not influence other
important musicians. Like any creditable high priest, Monk
Jiad his share of disciples. Randy Weston, Steve Lacy,
Charlie Rouse, McCoy Tyner, Jimmy Rowles, Barry Harris,
and even Bud Powell, the founder of modern jazz piano, all
came under the spell of Monk's music. But they were never
so foolhardly as to attempt to sound just like Monk; they
r eali/ed that with Monk, as with the heavyweight boxing
c hampion or the fastest gun-slinger in Dodge City, they
were dealing with someone of whom there could be one
andonjyone.
Monk, always reclusive, became even more so during the
last decade of his life. Recordings and performances, for the
rpost part, simply did not take place. But Monk, even at his
most private, was also publicly accessible in a crazy sort of
way. His phone number was listed in the Manhattan phone
book; even after his face appeared on the cover of Time
magazine, he saw no reason to acquire an unlisted number.
Neighbors of Monk were familiar with his hatted figure as
he strolled to and fro. What made Monk a recluse was not
the fact that one could not get in touch with him (that was in
fact quite easy) but that even within his presence one felt
distant or like a stranger.
in the world of jazz, where eccentricity is almost a
prerequisite to fame, Monk was in a way the ultimate
eccentric. His unique, often odd behavior went beyond
mannerism and lifestyle and into the crevices of his music.
But it is with this unique perspective that Monk was able to
create music that still sounds fresh almost a generation after
it was made, and will, one suspects, sound just as fresh, and
amusing, and cryptic years from now.
Even those who only glance casually at newspaper 112
obituaries were probably intrigued by the recent
appearance there of the name Thelonious Sphere Mopk.,
Yet those familiar with the music of Monk, the jazz pi Jnlst
who passed away on Feb. 17, would doubtless argue'
that the man's compositions were every bit as peculiar as his !
singular name. J.
Fans perceived something quasi-mystical abou| Msnk^^
The hipsters dubbed him the "high priest of bopll^fcut
though his demeanor may have struck some as somehow
priestly, his music bore only the most tangential l|pl||
resemblances to bebop. Indeed it bore little relation to

At times one could perceive the influence of Monk's
predecessors on his playing, but these stylistic echoes of the
past sounded fresh and new when they
into Monk's sparse and rhythmicmusic. Several years bpck,
jazz archivists stumbled upon some tapes of Monk made
when the pianist was still young and l/rgely unknown,
the influence of stride and swing pianists,'such as Art fatum
and Teddy Wilson, was clearly evident. But within a few
years Monk had pushed these influencesinto the
background, and had acquired that starkly dissonant
approach to the piano that was uniquely his own.
Those fond of technical analysis will point out t||Stne 19
distinctive sound of Monk's music stems from hislj»pf ■}
whole-tone scales, minor seconds, and various forms of
dissonance. In fact, these were the most banal elements of
Monk's playing. More important was rhe crazy sort of logic
in Monk's music that almost defies technical analysis.. Monk
typically bases his compositions on the mosjrblnrjfe musical
motifs, yet he develops these lop-sided such
serious persistence thatone wonders whether there is not
some hidden Chopinesque beauty to them after all. With
Monk, as with Buster Keaton, the ever present poker-face
half-convinces us that we perceive as odd is actually quite
