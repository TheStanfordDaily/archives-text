# Soloists save ABT's dying 'Swan'

### Mary Walp 
American Ballet Theatre's new Don
Quixote doesn't send the audience away
saying, "Wow, what a great ballet!" But
fortunately, on Sunday night, Martine Van
Mamel and Patrick Bissel sent everyone
away saying, "Wow, what great dancers!"
Kitri and Basil, they provided two of the
few bright spots of Mikhail Baryshnikov's
staging of the ballet.
Baryshnikov's Don Quixote takes forev
er to get going, and even when it does, it
drags so much that at times one wonders
\Vhether the whole ballet is just going to
fade into the dazzling sets. The first act is
encumbered by far too much formal pan
tomime. True, the audience must know
\vhat is going on, but there is so much arm
â– jwaving, hands pressed to hearts, and exag

gerated sighs that it all begins to look the
same. Also, the energy level of the dancing
was very low and rather sloppy, only be
ginning to pick up towards the end of Act
One. The two flower girls got together on
their timing in the final variation, and the
corps finally perked up for a little while
and showed a little interest in the action.
The corps was incredibly precise
throughout the whole ballet, yet they rare
ly showed any enthusiasm or interest. This
attitude was acceptable for the dream se
quence which calls for tranquility, but
even then there were moments when it
seemed as if they were the ones who were
dreaming rather than Don Quixote.
Without Van Hamel and Bissel, Don
Quixote would never have found enough
energy to keep itself going.

Technically, they were almost flawless,
performing breathtaking leaps, pirouettes
that went on and on, and unending bal
ances. These two went far beyond mere
technical excellence, however. Van Hamel
always charms the audience with her danc
ing as well as her acting. Bissel supported
her gallantly and the two were beautiful
partners, complimenting each other in ev
ery way. The famous pas de deux in Act
Two was extraordinary; the two were in
complete communication, dancing with
great feeling that set off the remarkable
executions of lifts, turns, and balances. If
Don Quixote had been of this quality
throughout, there would have been
absolutely no need for complaint; but as it
is, this particular staging does not give the
dancers much to work with.
