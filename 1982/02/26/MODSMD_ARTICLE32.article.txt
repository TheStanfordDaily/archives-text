# Salinas goes Hollywood

### Steve Vineberg 
David Ward must live in a
movie memorabilia shop. He
won an Oscar for his last pro
duced script, The Sting, but giv
ing him an award for that col
lection of gags from old come
dies and Damon Runyon
stories was like voting the Na
tional Book Award to the edi
tor of a new anthology. Can
nery Row, which marks his di
rectorial debut (he also wrote
the screenplay), is officially
based on two books by John
Steinbeck, Cannery Row and
Sweet Thursday, about a crew
of down-and-outers in the
northern California of the late
Depression, but there's more
Hollywood than Steinbeck in
it. Ward makes a conscious ef
fort to recapture the studio
style of the thirties — in the
cardboard cut-out sets de
signed by Richard Mac Donald,
the strong, simple narrative
line, and the broad, overstated
acting. But because he's not a
very precise craftsman, Ward
offers us all the vices of the
movies of that epoch and none
of the virtues (fine gloss, solid
pacing, distinctive person
alities). Cannery Row is a dead
ly slow, stolidly old-fashioned
picture.
I wasn't looking forward to a
film version of these novels,
which not only are condescen
dingly folksy — Steinbeck's
reverence for the working class
was always suspect — but also
abound in the slightly sick
ening camaraderie of sloppy
male characters to whom a
woman who is not a whore rep
resents the threat of civilizing
forces. Steinbeck's writing is
too platitudinous and self-seri
ous to support this point of
view amiably — he wasn't ex
actly Mark Twain. And the last
adaptation of this material, the
Rodgers and Hammerstein
musical Pipe Dream in the mid
'sos, was pretty awful (though it
yielded one good tune, "Ev
erybody's Got a Home but
Me"). Surprisingly, however,
Ward bypasses most of the
thematic and characterological
difficulties in the books — only
to whip up his own. The
whores at the Bear Flag Restau
rant, assembled under the

cautious eye of madam Fauna
(Audra Lindley), are not Stein
beck's line-drawn comic mis
fits; they are the benevolent
earth mother types familiar to
us from movies like The Re
ivers. Mack (Emmet Walsh) and
his gang, who occupy a
flophouse they refer to as The
Palace, employ an acting style
that can most generously be
labeled "vaudevillian." And
the hero, Doc (Nick Nolte), has
been given a past that taps a
whole field of cliches no one
else reading Steinbeck would
have dreamed of: he's a former
ball player who turned to
marine biology when one of
his pitches knocked a batter

into a coma — and now he
takes care of his wounded
friend (Sunshine Parker), who
calls himself The Seerand plays
trumpet at the oceanside every
morning at sunrise.
For the focal romance be
tween Doc and Suzy, a tough
cookie who gets work at the
Bear Flag out of desperation,
Ward probably wanted Clark
Gable and Jean Harlow, but
Nick Nolte (the closest star to
Gable we've got, and a much
better actor) seems to be mov
ing in slow motion here, and
Debra Winger, who was a fire
ball in her last film, Urban
Cowboy, is rather shrill, so
Ward ends up with Spencer

Tracy and Betty Hutton. It's not
a dazzling match, and the ex
tended courtship scene, in
which they plod through five
or six contemporary dance
styles while "In the Mood"
plays on the jukebox, doesn't
work in the comic-romantic
mode in which it was clearly
conceived.
At their worst, Hollywood
movies of the '30s could be like
primers, holding every image
long enough for the slowest
kindergarten child to drink it
in. Ward subscribes to this ap
proach; fast readers are ad
vised to bring along a good
book to Cannery Row. It also

takes us back to the bad old'
days of racial and sexual stere
otyping. Santos Morales plays a
Chicano shopkeeper named
Joseph and Mary, and Frank
Mcßae, who was so funny in
Used Cars, is stuck playing a big
black lug for whom thinking is
a painful physical exertion. He
brings Doc and Suzy together
by breaking Doc's arm with a
baseball bat so that Suzy will
want to take care of him.
(Earlier in the movie, she cleans
up his house, launders his shirts
and leaves stew simmering on
the stove for him). Cannery
Row is a return to the kind of
movie no one needed to see
again.

Nick Nolte (the closest star to
Gable we've got, and a much
better actor) seems to be mov
ing in slow motion here, and
Debra Winger, who was a fire
ball in her last film, Urban
Cowboy, is rather shrill, so
Ward ends up with Spencer

Tracy and Betty Hutton. It's not
a dazzling match, and the ex
tended courtship scene, in
which they plod through five
or six contemporary dance
styles while "In the Mood"
plays on the jukebox, doesn't
work in the comic-romantic
mode in which it was clearly
conceived.
At their worst, Hollywood
movies of the '30s could be like
primers, holding every image
long enough for the slowest
kindergarten child to drink it
in. Ward subscribes to this ap
proach; fast readers are ad
vised to bring along a good
book to Cannery Row. It also

takes us back to the bad old'
days of racial and sexual stere
otyping. Santos Morales plays a
Chicano shopkeeper named
Joseph and Mary, and Frank
Mcßae, who was so funny in
Used Cars, is stuck playing a big
black lug for whom thinking is
a painful physical exertion. He
brings Doc and Suzy together
by breaking Doc's arm with a
baseball bat so that Suzy will
want to take care of him.
(Earlier in the movie, she cleans
up his house, launders his shirts
and leaves stew simmering on
the stove for him). Cannery
Row is a return to the kind of
movie no one needed to see
again.

David Ward must live in a
movie memorabilia shop. He
won an Oscar for his last pro
duced script, The Sting, but giv
ing him an award for that col
lection of gags from old come
dies and Damon Runyon
stories was like voting the Na
tional Book Award to the edi
tor of a new anthology. Can
nery Row, which marks his di
rectorial debut (he also wrote
the screenplay), is officially
based on two books by John
Steinbeck, Cannery Row and
Sweet Thursday, about a crew
of down-and-outers in the
northern California of the late
Depression, but there's more
Hollywood than Steinbeck in
it. Ward makes a conscious ef
fort to recapture the studio
style of the thirties — in the
cardboard cut-out sets de
signed by Richard Mac Donald,
the strong, simple narrative
line, and the broad, overstated
acting. But because he's not a
very precise craftsman, Ward
offers us all the vices of the
movies of that epoch and none
of the virtues (fine gloss, solid
pacing, distinctive person
alities). Cannery Row is a dead
ly slow, stolidly old-fashioned
picture.
I wasn't looking forward to a
film version of these novels,
which not only are condescen
dingly folksy — Steinbeck's
reverence for the working class
was always suspect — but also
abound in the slightly sick
ening camaraderie of sloppy
male characters to whom a
woman who is not a whore rep
resents the threat of civilizing
forces. Steinbeck's writing is
too platitudinous and self-seri
ous to support this point of
view amiably — he wasn't ex
actly Mark Twain. And the last
adaptation of this material, the
Rodgers and Hammerstein
musical Pipe Dream in the mid
'sos, was pretty awful (though it
yielded one good tune, "Ev
erybody's Got a Home but
Me"). Surprisingly, however,
Ward bypasses most of the
thematic and characterological
difficulties in the books — only
to whip up his own. The
whores at the Bear Flag Restau
rant, assembled under the

cautious eye of madam Fauna
(Audra Lindley), are not Stein
beck's line-drawn comic mis
fits; they are the benevolent
earth mother types familiar to
us from movies like The Re
ivers. Mack (Emmet Walsh) and
his gang, who occupy a
flophouse they refer to as The
Palace, employ an acting style
that can most generously be
labeled "vaudevillian." And
the hero, Doc (Nick Nolte), has
been given a past that taps a
whole field of cliches no one
else reading Steinbeck would
have dreamed of: he's a former
ball player who turned to
marine biology when one of
his pitches knocked a batter

into a coma — and now he
takes care of his wounded
friend (Sunshine Parker), who
calls himself The Seerand plays
trumpet at the oceanside every
morning at sunrise.
For the focal romance be
tween Doc and Suzy, a tough
cookie who gets work at the
Bear Flag out of desperation,
Ward probably wanted Clark
Gable and Jean Harlow, but
Nick Nolte (the closest star to
Gable we've got, and a much
better actor) seems to be mov
ing in slow motion here, and
