North by Northwest****
Monday, Kresge
This superb Hitchcock thriller
finds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual
— the working title was not North
by Northwest but The Man on
Lincoln's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi
nessman forced into flight after
he is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer. Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcok's ice
beauties, plays a woman of
dubious loyalties who finds her
life thrown into the same
"alphabet soup" (the CIA, the
FBI . . . ) as Grant's.
Everything gels — the per
formances are smooth,
scriptwriter Ernest Lehmann's
dialogue is polished and witty,
and Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant.
Double billed with The Wrong
Man.
— Jim Mattson
The Wrong Man ★★★
Monday, Kresge
Interestingly, one of the few
Hitchcock films based on a true
story (and, at the time it was re
leased, much ballyhooed for its
"documentary" technique) finds
the familiar Hitchcock motifs and
fixations firmly in place. Henry
Fonda plays the "wrong man" ac
cused of robbery and, as has hap
pened to so many other
Hitchcock heroes, he can find
almost no one who will believe
his innocence. Vera Miles, giving
a striking performance, plays his
wife. She is so confused and dis
turbed by the conflicting reports
she's received that she is slowly
driven into madness. And even
the misplaced "happy" ending
(placed there, one assumes, at
the studio's request) cannot erase
its earlier images of entrapment
(reinforced by the director's
often-subjective camera) and
lingering doubt about who is in
nocent and who is not.

Dial M For Murder
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
In 3-D! Alfred Hitchcock
filmed this thriller using the new
process in the '50s, but by the
time it was released the 3-D craze
had abated and Warner Brothers
decided to show it flat. In 1980, a
dedicated film buff persuaded
the studio to dig up the old
negatives, find some glasses, and
release it as Hitchcock filmed it.
As you might expect, the director
uses the gimmick with restraint,
using it for shock value only
twice, once in a famous scene in
volving a pair of scissors and
again in another involving a key.
The rest of the time, he's content
with layering lamps and rows of
bottles in the foreground to give
a rather sinuous sense of depth.
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star. Kelly plays the not-so-inno
cent wife (who's having an affair
with Robert Cummings). Milland
plays the husband who realizes
that his wife's affections — and

fortune — may be turning
elsewhere, and who also realizes
that a well-planned murder
might be the perfect solution.
Filmed in under a month and
adhering very closely to the stage
play, this is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts. But the play, by Frederick
Knott, is very clever, the per
formances (especially by John
Williams, who plays the Scotland
Yard Inspector in charge of the
case) enjoyable, and the direc
tion amazingly fluid in what is es
sentially a one-set movie. Filmed .
in the unstable Warnercolor, so i
the colors have drifted toward |112
the pinks and yellows.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
Eipirit; it's a

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely viewof
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisly ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

I or the lirst hour and .1 quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a hoy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old

less exciting and more high

serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
(i.illipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com

Atlantic City ★★★*
Belmont Theater, Belmont
In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older build
ings — remnants of a past gran
deur and a more recent decay —
tumble to the ground. In the vi
sion of director Louis Malle and
screenwriter John Guare, the en
vironmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change
that has seized the lives of the
people of the city. Atlantic City's
people try with varying degrees
of success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for some
people to adjust to new condi
tions and to make a new life out
of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives. The film features
fine performances by Burt Lan
caster, Susan Sarandon, and Kate
Reid.

The Wrong Man ★★★
Monday, Kresge
Interestingly, one of the few
Hitchcock films based on a true
story (and, at the time it was re
leased, much ballyhooed for its
"documentary" technique) finds
the familiar Hitchcock motifs and
fixations firmly in place. Henry
Fonda plays the "wrong man" ac
cused of robbery and, as has hap
pened to so many other
Hitchcock heroes, he can find
almost no one who will believe
his innocence. Vera Miles, giving
a striking performance, plays his
wife. She is so confused and dis
turbed by the conflicting reports
she's received that she is slowly
driven into madness. And even
the misplaced "happy" ending
(placed there, one assumes, at
the studio's request) cannot erase
its earlier images of entrapment
(reinforced by the director's
often-subjective camera) and
lingering doubt about who is in
nocent and who is not.

Dial M For Murder
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
In 3-D! Alfred Hitchcock
filmed this thriller using the new
process in the '50s, but by the
time it was released the 3-D craze
had abated and Warner Brothers
decided to show it flat. In 1980, a
dedicated film buff persuaded
the studio to dig up the old
negatives, find some glasses, and
release it as Hitchcock filmed it.
As you might expect, the director
uses the gimmick with restraint,
using it for shock value only
twice, once in a famous scene in
volving a pair of scissors and
again in another involving a key.
The rest of the time, he's content
with layering lamps and rows of
bottles in the foreground to give
a rather sinuous sense of depth.
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star. Kelly plays the not-so-inno
cent wife (who's having an affair
with Robert Cummings). Milland
plays the husband who realizes
that his wife's affections — and

fortune — may be turning
elsewhere, and who also realizes
that a well-planned murder
might be the perfect solution.
Filmed in under a month and
adhering very closely to the stage
play, this is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts. But the play, by Frederick
Knott, is very clever, the per
formances (especially by John
Williams, who plays the Scotland
Yard Inspector in charge of the
case) enjoyable, and the direc
tion amazingly fluid in what is es
sentially a one-set movie. Filmed .
in the unstable Warnercolor, so i
the colors have drifted toward |112
the pinks and yellows.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely viewof
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisly ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to

the Boardwalk, the older build

tumble to the ground. In the vi

screenwriter John Guare, the en

flects the disorienting change
that has seized the lives of the
people of the city. Atlantic City's
people try with varying degrees
of success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for some
people to adjust to new condi

of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele

Monday, Kresge
Interestingly, one of the few
Hitchcock films based on a true
story (and, at the time it was re
leased, much ballyhooed for its
"documentary" technique) finds
the familiar Hitchcock motifs and
fixations firmly in place. Henry
Fonda plays the "wrong man" ac
cused of robbery and, as has hap
pened to so many other
Hitchcock heroes, he can find
almost no one who will believe
his innocence. Vera Miles, giving
a striking performance, plays his
wife. She is so confused and dis
turbed by the conflicting reports
she's received that she is slowly
driven into madness. And even
the misplaced "happy" ending
(placed there, one assumes, at
the studio's request) cannot erase
its earlier images of entrapment
(reinforced by the director's
often-subjective camera) and
lingering doubt about who is in
nocent and who is not.

Dial M For Murder
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
In 3-D! Alfred Hitchcock
filmed this thriller using the new
process in the '50s, but by the
time it was released the 3-D craze
had abated and Warner Brothers
decided to show it flat. In 1980, a
dedicated film buff persuaded
the studio to dig up the old
negatives, find some glasses, and
release it as Hitchcock filmed it.
As you might expect, the director
uses the gimmick with restraint,
using it for shock value only
twice, once in a famous scene in
volving a pair of scissors and
again in another involving a key.
The rest of the time, he's content
with layering lamps and rows of
bottles in the foreground to give
a rather sinuous sense of depth.
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star. Kelly plays the not-so-inno
cent wife (who's having an affair
with Robert Cummings). Milland
plays the husband who realizes
that his wife's affections — and

fortune — may be turning
elsewhere, and who also realizes
that a well-planned murder
might be the perfect solution.
Filmed in under a month and
adhering very closely to the stage
play, this is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts. But the play, by Frederick
Knott, is very clever, the per
formances (especially by John
Williams, who plays the Scotland
Yard Inspector in charge of the
case) enjoyable, and the direc
tion amazingly fluid in what is es
sentially a one-set movie. Filmed .
in the unstable Warnercolor, so i
the colors have drifted toward |112
the pinks and yellows.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely viewof
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisly ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

I or the lirst hour and .1 quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a hoy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old

less exciting and more high

rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young

and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the

Atlantic City ★★★*

In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older build
ings — remnants of a past gran
deur and a more recent decay —
tumble to the ground. In the vi
sion of director Louis Malle and
screenwriter John Guare, the en
vironmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change
that has seized the lives of the
people of the city. Atlantic City's
people try with varying degrees
of success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for some
people to adjust to new condi

of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives. The film features
fine performances by Burt Lan

Dial M For Murder
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
In 3-D! Alfred Hitchcock
filmed this thriller using the new
process in the '50s, but by the
time it was released the 3-D craze
had abated and Warner Brothers
decided to show it flat. In 1980, a
dedicated film buff persuaded
the studio to dig up the old
negatives, find some glasses, and
release it as Hitchcock filmed it.
As you might expect, the director
uses the gimmick with restraint,
using it for shock value only
twice, once in a famous scene in
volving a pair of scissors and
again in another involving a key.
The rest of the time, he's content
with layering lamps and rows of
bottles in the foreground to give
a rather sinuous sense of depth.
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star. Kelly plays the not-so-inno
cent wife (who's having an affair
with Robert Cummings). Milland
plays the husband who realizes
that his wife's affections — and

fortune — may be turning
elsewhere, and who also realizes
that a well-planned murder
might be the perfect solution.
Filmed in under a month and
adhering very closely to the stage
play, this is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts. But the play, by Frederick
Knott, is very clever, the per
formances (especially by John
Williams, who plays the Scotland
Yard Inspector in charge of the
case) enjoyable, and the direc
tion amazingly fluid in what is es
sentially a one-set movie. Filmed .
in the unstable Warnercolor, so i
the colors have drifted toward |112
the pinks and yellows.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely viewof
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisly ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the

Atlantic City ★★★*

In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older build
ings — remnants of a past gran
deur and a more recent decay —
tumble to the ground. In the vi
sion of director Louis Malle and
screenwriter John Guare, the en
vironmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change
that has seized the lives of the
people of the city. Atlantic City's
people try with varying degrees
of success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for some
people to adjust to new condi

of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives. The film features
fine performances by Burt Lan

North by Northwest****

This superb Hitchcock thriller
finds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual
— the working title was not North
by Northwest but The Man on
Lincoln's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi

he is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer. Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcok's ice
beauties, plays a woman of
dubious loyalties who finds her
life thrown into the same
"alphabet soup" (the CIA, the
FBI . . . ) as Grant's.
Everything gels — the per

scriptwriter Ernest Lehmann's
dialogue is polished and witty,
and Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant.

The Wrong Man ★★★
Monday, Kresge
Interestingly, one of the few
Hitchcock films based on a true
story (and, at the time it was re
leased, much ballyhooed for its
"documentary" technique) finds
the familiar Hitchcock motifs and
fixations firmly in place. Henry
Fonda plays the "wrong man" ac
cused of robbery and, as has hap
pened to so many other
Hitchcock heroes, he can find
almost no one who will believe
his innocence. Vera Miles, giving
a striking performance, plays his
wife. She is so confused and dis
turbed by the conflicting reports
she's received that she is slowly
driven into madness. And even
the misplaced "happy" ending
(placed there, one assumes, at
the studio's request) cannot erase
its earlier images of entrapment

time it was released the 3-D craze
had abated and Warner Brothers
decided to show it flat. In 1980, a
dedicated film buff persuaded
the studio to dig up the old
negatives, find some glasses, and
release it as Hitchcock filmed it.
As you might expect, the director
uses the gimmick with restraint,
using it for shock value only
twice, once in a famous scene in
volving a pair of scissors and
again in another involving a key.
The rest of the time, he's content
with layering lamps and rows of
bottles in the foreground to give
a rather sinuous sense of depth.
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star. Kelly plays the not-so-inno
cent wife (who's having an affair
with Robert Cummings). Milland
plays the husband who realizes
that his wife's affections — and

fortune — may be turning
elsewhere, and who also realizes
that a well-planned murder
might be the perfect solution.
Filmed in under a month and
adhering very closely to the stage
play, this is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts. But the play, by Frederick
Knott, is very clever, the per
formances (especially by John
Williams, who plays the Scotland
Yard Inspector in charge of the
case) enjoyable, and the direc
tion amazingly fluid in what is es
sentially a one-set movie. Filmed .
in the unstable Warnercolor, so i
the colors have drifted toward |112
the pinks and yellows.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
Eipirit; it's a
/ie.

A Clockwork Orange****
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Stanley Kubrick directed this
violent, upsetting movie right af
ter he made 2001, and it seems as
if he tried to turn everything he
did there inside out. From Arthur
Clarke's dreamy, leisurely viewof
a giant leap into the future, he
turned to Anthony Burgess'
world where future shock is a giv
en and where anything that gets
one through the day is better
than boredom. Malcom
McDowell is the"protagonist" —
he's so violent that his society has
to use violent therapy to calm
him down, and its not clear which
one is more reprehensible. The
movie is garish and ugly — the
audience is being assaulted, too,
and our responses are being ma
nipulated as much as McDowell's
character's are. It's either a great
movie or a very terrible one — it
may be both.
This is being re-released with a
new, grisly ad campaign, pre
sumably to capture the recent
gore-ghoul market.

\Gallipoli **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
I or the lirst hour and .1 quarter,
Peter Weir's movie is a hoy's ad
venture in the spirit of the old
f.unga Din. though considerably
less exciting and more high
ininded. He wants to establish a
serene mood with this eclectic
rites-of-manhood material about
the shared experience of young
soldiers barely out of high school,
and then present the jarring con
trast of war which robs them of
their youth. The problem is that
he misses the real movie: Weir
gives us elaborate tableaux of the
dead and the wounded in the
(i.illipoli scenes rather than the
battle itself, and you can't com
municate the tragedy of war
without offering a taste of its ex
(itemen!. Despite Weir's talent
and the talent of Russell Boyd,
the photgrapher, it's a bloodless
movie.

Atlantic City ★★★*
Belmont Theater, Belmont
In the "new" Atlantic City, the
dizzy burst of gambling fever has
shuffled the new and the old to
gether. As new casinos go up on
the Boardwalk, the older build
ings — remnants of a past gran
deur and a more recent decay —
tumble to the ground. In the vi
sion of director Louis Malle and
screenwriter John Guare, the en
vironmental transformation re
flects the disorienting change
that has seized the lives of the
people of the city. Atlantic City's
people try with varying degrees
of success to cope with this
anomie. Somewhat surprisingly,
Malle ends on an optimistic note
It is possible, we see, for some
people to adjust to new condi
tions and to make a new life out
of the confusion around them.
Likewise, the film itself emerges
from a mass of discordant ele
ments to form a new, vital
tapestry of lives. The film features
fine performances by Burt Lan
caster, Susan Sarandon, and Kate
Reid.
