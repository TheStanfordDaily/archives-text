# Developer calls real estate market 'volatile'
## 
### Anthea Stratigos 
Calling the problems of the real es
tate industry "political," Buzz
McCoy, managing director of
Morgan Stanley, a corporate real es
tate consultant and development
company, said that until inflation
goes down, the government spends
reasonable amounts on defense and
rids itself of a budget deficit, the mar
ket will remain "volatile."
McCoy, who spoke to an audience
of about 50 last night in CERAS, is cur
rently the president of Morgan
Stanley's subsidiary Brooks, Harvey
and is an executive in residence at
the Graduate School of Business. His
talk on careers and investments in
real estate was sponsored by the new
ly formed Real Estate Association at
Stanford (REAS).
McCoy said that the commercial
and residential real estate market,
traditionally constructed around

long-term, low interest first mort
gages were the largest consumer of
credit. "The party was over when we
got into inflation," he said.
Describing the real estate business
as "cyclical and entrepreneurial," he
said that the supply of money has
been drying up in recent years. One
reason isthatdevelopersare no long
er subsidized by insurance com
panies, because the insurance com
panies lost capital when policy
holders stopped purchasing long
term policies.
Commerical banks which
"pumped out billions of dollars in
open-ended construction loans"
were hurt, he said, causing one more
source of money to be in trouble.
Keeping an eye on money market
funds will give clues to real estate
trends. The funds doubled last year,
he said, adding that "almost all the

long-term capital is parked there."
When the public's confidence in
the government is restored, the
money will circulate. Then, when in
vestments are made, it will be easy for
them to end up in real estate, he said,
adding that a lot of money is now
coming in from such areas as Japan,
Singapore and the Middle East.
He's not pessimistic about the role
of the real estate developer, he said,
because developers with "the hun
ger and the guts" willing to take the
risks that institutions won't, may be
able to survive.
It is one of "the many things to get
involved in within the industry," he
said, adding that "you won't want to
be an investment banker unless
you're optimistic."
Chip Conley, a co-founder of
REAS, said he was impressed with the
organization's first event and was

glad to see that so many people
showed. The purpose of the or
ganization is to provide an op
portunity for members of the Stan
ford community interested in real es
tate to interface with each other.
