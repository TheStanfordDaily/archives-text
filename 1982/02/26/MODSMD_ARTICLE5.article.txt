# Time head: no conflict between media
## 
### Samuel Howe 
San Francisco — Presiding over a
corporation which publishes seven
of the country's most widely read
magazines, he talks as an in
defatigable advocate of the power
and appeal of the written word.
Serving for the same corporation
which also has extensive interests in
the "exploding" field of cable tele
vision, he speaks of an American
public making increasing demands
for the visual images of the screen.
But Ralph Davidson, 1950 Stanford
graduate and chairman of the board
of Time Inc., says he sees no real con
flict between the two forms of com
munication — rather, there is a
mutually sustaining relationship.
"My belief is . . . that cable and
print are going to have a synergistic
relationship," Davidson told the Dai
ly in an interview last Friday. Justas"a
sports person loves to go and read
about a game he or she was watch
ing," Davidson maintained, most
people who use the "headline ser
vice" of news reports still want to
read more about the news.
"(Print media) engages you in a dif

ferent way — there is still an involve
ment between the reader and his
newspaper or the magazine that's a
different kind. It's an active rela
tionship, whereas watching TV is a
passive relationship. I don't believe
that's going to change a great deal."
Afternoon newspapers such as The
Washington Star are folding, accord
ing to Davidson, primarily because
they can't compete with their morn
ing counterparts and not because of
television. However, he conceded,
"To say that TV has had no impact on
newspapers would be ridiculous."
Time Inc.'s principal lines of busi
ness include publishing of maga
zines, books and recordings; forest
products such as paper and
cardboard; and cable television sys
tems, including HBO (Home Box Of
fice). Although the video line ac
counted for only about 15 percent of
the company's total revenues in fiscal
year 1980, it provided 28 percent of
operating profit, according to the
Standard & Poor's report. Cable is
also its fastest-growing line.
Davidson, who was president of
the Stanford Alumni Association in

1972-73 and has been a lecturer for
the Communication Department,
also spoke about the editorial policy
of Time magazine, which with a
domestic circulation of 4.4 million is
the country's best-selling news
magazine.
He said that those who run Time
have views which are reflected in the
content of the magazine: "We be
lieve that the United States is the
strongest country in the free world,
and it should remain so. We do be
lieve that the United States' position
of complete dominanace of the
19405, '50s and early '60s has changed,
and that our foreign policy should
take that into account . . . We think
the hegemony of the Russians is
something that needs to be
curtailed."
Domestically, "We try to take a
somewhat conservative approach to
the businessof economic reporting.
We believe in the free enterprise sys
tem, and we believe we should not
be overregulated, that American
business should have the opportuni
ty to grow and expand, and that re
quires modification of the tax struc
ture of the country."
Saying that Time has "the power
commensurate with the credibility of
the publication . . . amongst our
readers" to influence world events,
Davidson maintained that "We need
to document our reasons, then we
could have an impact."
He denied, for example, that Time
supported Jimmy Carter's election in
1976 by giving him extensive news
coverage early in the primaries. "A
lot of people take that (kind of cov
erage) as a statement of support of
the candidate .. . We just happened
to be good news people — we sniffed
out this news story of this governor in
Georgia before anybody else did be
cause we took him seriously as a can
didate."
If Time had not covered Carter as it
did, "We would have missed a story,"
Davidson said.
While Davidson criticized Carter's
presidency because he "could not
chart a course and stick to it,"he was

generally positive about President
Ronald Reagan and said that Time
and its sister publications, Fortune
and Money, are "generally sup
portive" of the president's economic
program.
"I guess I find Ronald Reagan the
kind of personality . . . you can put
the tag 'leadership' next to," said
Davidson. "He does have the ability
to say, 'This is where we're going, and
I'm going to take you there.' "
While Time may have "quarrels
with certain aspects" of the Reagan

program, it tries to present a
"thoughtful approach" to the politi
cal debate about its merits. For exam
ple, Davidson cited a chart which the
magazine recently printed "to point
out how much remains of the job
programs and welfare programs and
aid to people who really need it . . .
Before everybody says 'Hell, it's all
been dismantled,' we (present) the
facts and you make up your mind
whether that's dismantling or not."
Saying that "those who have the
opportunity to go to Stanford are
damn lucky," Davidson defended
the virtues of private as opposed to
state-funded education, saying, "We
can't afford to let a privately en
dowed university be in the hands of
somebody who's going to try to con
trol the way the curriculum is han
dled, the way that people are taught,


Ralph Davidson
the freedom that they have . . . and
the way that you preserve that is get
ting money from corporate America,
and from private individuals, and
(from) foundations."
Davidson, who was born in Santa
Fe, New Mexico, spent most of his
childhood in Los Angeles, then came
to Stanford, where he wasan interna
tional relations major, player on the
rugby club, and president of both the
Interfraternity Council and the Zeta
Psi fraternity.
After travel in Europe and three
years' work with the Central In
telligence Agency in Washington, he
"went to work for Time by putting a
dime in a telephone call to the per
sonnel department."
