## Journalist writes to expose corruption 
### Adam Goodman 
When Lidia Wasowicz's classmates made fun of her
21 years ago, they probably never thought the shy
Polish girl who could not even speak English would
one day be a successful journalist.
Wasowicz was born in Krakow, Poland in 1951 and
fled to San Francisco with her parents when she was
nine years old. Currently at the age of 30, she is an in
vestigative reporter and day news editor for United
Press International (UPI) in San Francisco as well as a
professional journalism fellow here.
Wasowicz said she believes the driving force be
hind her work may stem from her childhood in Po
land. "In Poland I saw what lack of freedom is," she
said. "The appreciation of freedom and justice had a
personal meaning to me."
"You have a cause and you have to fight for it," she
said. "My own motivation has been the pursuit of jus
tice. Sure there is injustice but (as a reporter) you can
expose it."
When she was 14, Wasowicz moved to Salt Lake
City, Utah. It was there that her interest in journalism
began.
Because of its large Mormon population, Salt Lake
City may not have been the easiest place for a woman
to start a career in journalism, but Wasowicz never
claims to have led an easy life.

Wasowicz began working for The Deseret News,
Salt Lake City's evening daily newspaper, while she
was in high school and went on to obtain her
bachelor's degree in journalism from the University
of Utah in 1973. While there she was hired by the Salt
Lake City bureau of UPi — the first woman reporter
they had employed.
However, soon after she had started a new bureau
chief called her into his office and told her that he did
not believe that women should be working in a ca
reer.
"He asked me, 'Why aren't you barefoot and preg
nant and in the kitchen,' " Wasowicz recalled. Next
she said he put her on the overnight — a shift from 11
p.m. to 7:30 a.m. — even though she had to be at
school at 8:45 a.m.
"Every time a good story came up ... I was not sent
out because I was a woman," Wasowicz said.
From Salt Lake City, Wasowicz moved back to San
Francisco in 1975 to work in UPl's San Francisco bu
reau, where she rewrote news for broadcasts and did
some investigative reporting before reaching her ed
iting position in charge of news coverage for 13
Western states.
Wasowicz has written numerous investigative
pieces on organized drug trafficand nuclear weapons
testing. She has interviewed such people as Charles

Manson and Sirhan Sirhan. Possibly her most famous
work was an in-depth story on the Unification Church
in which she spent three days living with the "Moon
ies" undercover.
Though it may seem from her experiences that as a
woman Wasowicz faced extra difficulties in her ca
reer, she said being a woman is "one of the great ad
vantages" in her work.
"Women have a lot to offer through their feminini
ty," she said. "I approach people on a human level.
You don't abuse your femininity. You don't flirt. You
just be sincere and compassionate.
"I'm not sounding chauvinistic. I'm not saying that
men can't have these qualities, but compassion has a
place in journalism. I don't have to act like a man and
can keep my femininity."
The life of a journalist is a life Wasowicz saidsheen
joys. "There's nothing in the world like it," she said. "I
wouldn't trade it for anything. Journalists have an im
portant function to serve and important purpose.
Without us society couldn't function. We're the eyes
and ears of the people. We should take ourselves seri
ously.
"We can take anyone on. Look at Nixon, supposed
ly the most powerful man in the U.S., but the press
caused his downfall."

When Lidia Wasowicz's classmates made fun of her
21 years ago, they probably never thought the shy
Polish girl who could not even speak English would
one day be a successful journalist.
Wasowicz was born in Krakow, Poland in 1951 and
fled to San Francisco with her parents when she was
nine years old. Currently at the age of 30, she is an in
vestigative reporter and day news editor for United
Press International (UPI) in San Francisco as well as a
professional journalism fellow here.
Wasowicz said she believes the driving force be
hind her work may stem from her childhood in Po
land. "In Poland I saw what lack of freedom is," she
said. "The appreciation of freedom and justice had a
personal meaning to me."
"You have a cause and you have to fight for it," she
said. "My own motivation has been the pursuit of jus
tice. Sure there is injustice but (as a reporter) you can
expose it."
When she was 14, Wasowicz moved to Salt Lake
City, Utah. It was there that her interest in journalism
began.
Because of its large Mormon population, Salt Lake
City may not have been the easiest place for a woman
to start a career in journalism, but Wasowicz never
claims to have led an easy life.

Wasowicz began working for The Deseret News,
Salt Lake City's evening daily newspaper, while she
was in high school and went on to obtain her
bachelor's degree in journalism from the University
of Utah in 1973. While there she was hired by the Salt
Lake City bureau of UPi — the first woman reporter
they had employed.
However, soon after she had started a new bureau
chief called her into his office and told her that he did
not believe that women should be working in a ca
reer.
"He asked me, 'Why aren't you barefoot and preg
nant and in the kitchen,' " Wasowicz recalled. Next
she said he put her on the overnight — a shift from 11
p.m. to 7:30 a.m. — even though she had to be at
school at 8:45 a.m.
"Every time a good story came up ... I was not sent
out because I was a woman," Wasowicz said.
From Salt Lake City, Wasowicz moved back to San
Francisco in 1975 to work in UPl's San Francisco bu
reau, where she rewrote news for broadcasts and did
some investigative reporting before reaching her ed
iting position in charge of news coverage for 13
Western states.
Wasowicz has written numerous investigative
pieces on organized drug trafficand nuclear weapons
testing. She has interviewed such people as Charles

Manson and Sirhan Sirhan. Possibly her most famous
work was an in-depth story on the Unification Church
in which she spent three days living with the "Moon
ies" undercover.
Though it may seem from her experiences that as a
woman Wasowicz faced extra difficulties in her ca
reer, she said being a woman is "one of the great ad
vantages" in her work.
"Women have a lot to offer through their feminini
ty," she said. "I approach people on a human level.
You don't abuse your femininity. You don't flirt. You
just be sincere and compassionate.
"I'm not sounding chauvinistic. I'm not saying that
men can't have these qualities, but compassion has a
place in journalism. I don't have to act like a man and
can keep my femininity."
The life of a journalist is a life Wasowicz saidsheen
joys. "There's nothing in the world like it," she said. "I
wouldn't trade it for anything. Journalists have an im
portant function to serve and important purpose.
Without us society couldn't function. We're the eyes
and ears of the people. We should take ourselves seri
ously.
"We can take anyone on. Look at Nixon, supposed
ly the most powerful man in the U.S., but the press
caused his downfall."
