# University nurses threaten strike

Nurses at Stanford University Hos
pital may strike unless an agreement
for a new contract can be reached
before March 9. The nurses' previous
20-month contract expired at mid
night last night.
Negotiations have been underway
since early last month between the
hospital administration and the
Committee for the Recognition of
Nursing Achievement (CRONA), the
union representing the 1250 regis
tered nurses here. But no agreement
had been reached by Friday, when
talks were suspended for the week
end and the nurses threatened to
walk off March 9 if an agreement is
not reached.
By announcing the nurses' intent
to strike, CRONA fulfilled a require
ment under labor law that requires
unions to givelO days notice before

striking at a hospital.
The hospital responded by cancell-
of the 52 admissions scheduled
for last weekend. "We are making
plans to ensure that our critically ill
patients will be completely cared
for," said Sheldon King, executive
vice president of the hosptial.
This development comes in the
wake of a labor dispute at four San
Jose hospitals where nurses have
been on,strike for more than seven
weeks. Nurses there, represented by
the California Nurses Association
(CNA), have made bargaining pro
posals centered on an argument for
"comparable worth."
The concept of "comparable
worth" calls for establishing pay
equity between jobs traditionally
held by women and those held pre
dominantly by men.
Contending that nursesare rough

ly comparable to hospital pharma
cists, the CNA has demanded wage
increases of up to 37 percent in nego
tiations with O'Connor, Good
Samaritan, San Jose and Alexian
Brothers hospitals.
CRONA and the Stanford adminis
tration have agreed not to reveal the
details of ongoing negotiations, or
comment on their progress. There is
conflicting information, however, as
to whether "comparable worth" isan
issue at the bargaining table.
Priscilla Wheeler, the University's
chief labor attorney, has said "com
parable worth" has not been raised
as an issue in the talks. Wheeler said
Friday there was disagreement on
wages and benefits and other issues
still on the table, but that she was
"surprised and disappointed" when
CRONA gave notice of its intent to
strike.

Hedv Dumpel, CRONA president
and rhief negotiator, said com
parable pay for comparable work is
an issue for the Stanford nurses.
"Comparable worth means we are
no longer interested in keeping
salaries for hospital-based nurses a
closed market," Dumpel said on Sat
urday.
Should negotiations break down
and the Stanford nurses strike, Valley
Medical Center in San Jose would be
the only major full-service hosptial in
Santa Clara County untouched by la
bor troubles. Ruth O'Shea, deputy
directorof nursing at Valley Medical
Center, said "we're at full capacity al
reaoy just dealing with the crisis in
San Jose. We'll just have to take it as it
comes."
Stanford nurses last went out on
strike in 1974, when there was a 10-day
walkout.
