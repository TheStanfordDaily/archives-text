## DIVERSIONS Getting out of the pressure cooker 
### Bob Cohn 
It doesn't seem like the
weekend could really be over.
The days spent in Meyer and
Greene have all blurred into
one. But it's Monday morning
and classes are calling. The
week promises to be over
whelming.
The pressures of papers and
midterms have left the hard
working student floundering
in a flood of rough drafts, out
lines, periodic tables, scores of
books and a slew of incom
prehensible notes. Climbing
out of the clutter seems a futile
effort as the problem sets pile
up and the unread chapters ac
cumulate. The mounting work
continues to soar and academ

ic suffocation seems inevitable.
When the tension of excess
schoolwork strikes, students
need to find activities to vent
their frustration and relieve
their cluttered minds of the
machine-like whir of the aca
demic world. Here at Stanford,
there seems to be no shortage
of diversions that a mentally
exhausted body can use as an
escape from midterm crunch
or the end-of-quarter blues.
"After some sort of mentally
frustrating event, I like to do
some sort of mindless physical
activity like swim or run," said
sophomore Colleen Hen
dershott. "After you think for
so long, it's good to do the
types of activities where" you

can't think."
Dave Weiss, a fifth year in
dustrial engineering major,
echoes Hendershott's senti
ments: "I liketotrytogetsome
physical activity in — I don't
think about things when I'm
playing and by not thinking
about anything in particular I
can get rid of some of the ir
relevant stuff that bogs down
your mind when you're study
ing. Being physically active
helps release the tension in
your body that builds up from
concentrating so hard."
Indeed, there is something
to be said,, at least according to
Stanford students, for the vir
tue of a good wholesome
swedt. The seemingly soothing
effects of a wide variety of ex
ercises are advocated by many
as a release of frustration and
mental anguish. Freshman
Tommy Battat said, "When you
get out of a bad math class, the
only you < an think of is
hitting a tennis ball at hard as
you can."
Still others see physical ac
tivity a> a means of escape i—
albeit temporary — from (their
academic woes. John Gallon
Will do'"anything to take my
mind off my studies. When I'm
dfjying for a shot in soccer, or
cheering on my friends at a
swim meet, I'm not thinking,
about the integration formula
for tangent/'' Freshman
Barbara Blank uses dancing as
her escape; "When I have
midterms on Friday, \ have to
go dancing on the weekend to
clear my mind." j/
For Valerie Bfeft, a senior
majoring in edi'th resources
and economics* "the combina
tion of musioand exercise at
jazz aerobics < lass helps me to
relax when I'm faced with a lot
of work,"
]Yet for some, a pick-up foot
ball game or a jaunt up to the
dish is just notenought. "Forty
five minutes of exercise just
doesn't tlo it for me," said Eric
Weintz, Weintz

likes to offset his weekdays of
studying with weekends away
from Stanford. "I like it (going
out of town) because you're
out of the environment that
you associate with studying.
Whenever I go away, whether
it's just San Francisco or up to
Tahoe, I consider it a vacation
and I escape all the pressuresof
academics. It's a good way of
getting away from it all and
focusing on something else
and then just refocusing when
you return."
There are many who find
solace in things that are nearer
and dearer to their hearts than
exercise, namely friends and
food. Mary Williamson ac
knowledged the comfort one
can'find in merely talking to
friends when work becomes
ovorbearlrtgy''f go knock on a
doOr, vay and chat awhile.
Talking to gpod friends is just a
chance to say whatever you
want, even if it sounds stupid."
the omnipresence of a Doiti
inos Pizza Man in the halls of
dorms every night is testimony
to the fact that a great number
of people are closing their
books and turning to a large
cheese and sausage. The com
bination of a deserved study
break and ravenous hunger
spells late, night food for
freshman Jim Kohn. "If I've
been even when I
haven'i, a g6od way to relax is
to round friends, or
der a pizjta and sit around a
talk. It sure takes my'mjnd off
my Western Culturefeading,"
Indeed, .mapy night are not
complete studenjs
without d igarne of tards, a coy
pie begii and a call for pizza:'
Yet e&d* person unwinds in
his or Vierown way/»nd Louise
Kuo, a freshman, releases aca
demic tension in quite a dif
ferent manner. "What most
people do is they drink, they
order pizzas and they blare
their stereos. What I really like
to do is spend time by myself
when I'm working hard."

Whether it's a quiet walk
around campus, a tun around
the lake, or a soothing session
of listening to favorite records,
many students find that spend
ing time alone, something that
is not always easy to do, is the
most effective way of tem
porarily blocking out whatever
is on their mind.
While retreating to one's
own world is helpful to some,
many others relieve tension
through compansionship. Just
kicking back and talking to
roommates and friends is a vital

part of making it through each
day. Jeff Katzman is a member
of the Partners Program, in
which a Stanford student is
paired with an area youth who
may fall under the category we
loosely term "juvenile delin
quent." As a Senior Partner,
Katzman served as a role model
and finds it a great chance to
clear his mind. "When I'm sick
of work, I call my kid and I talk
to him because that way I deal
with his life and his problems
and don't have to worry about
my own." Phil Halperin, a

freshman from the Bay Area,
unwinds through a different
form of companionship. "I go
home and play with my dog.
Playing frisbee with J.D. makes
me forget about everything.
The rule for finding an ap
propriate diversion seems to
be that there is no rule. What
ever activity helps ease aca
demic pressures and makes life
manageable in this competitive
environment, seems to be the
best one to do. To each his
own.



THE ULTIMATE —
Rumored to be one of the
more popular Stanford
sports, ultimate frisbee is
one way students purfge
themselves of academic
frustrations.
