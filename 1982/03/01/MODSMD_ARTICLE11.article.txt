# ... but avoiding the danger zone
## 
### 
Students may unknowingly be in
creasing the anxiety they feel in their
lives through their own tension re
leasing physical activities, according
to Dr. Douglas Daher.
Daher, a staff psychologist with
the Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) program, specified
that "when we talk about anxiety, we
talk about two different things.
There is a worrying component,
which encompasses feelings and
thinking, and a tension component,
and that's physical."
DabsKexplained that stressors are
the thiftfis that cause stress, which is
112 ethnically a relationship between
and individual and the stressors in
his life, and anxiety — worry and ten
sion — can be a direct effect of this
stress.
It is the tension that students feel
that often leads to physical exercise

as an outlet. Since tension is a physi
cal response to anxiety, it may follow
that many students cope by turning
to physical activities.
"I think any kind of physical activi
ty helps release tension," said Nancy
Knowles, a fullback on the Stanford
women's soccer team. "You just get
out there, start running, and forget
about everything for two hours.
Whenever I'm out there, I forget
about all my work."
But Daher warns that people
should be wary of some sports as an
outlet. "It's not particularly helpful
to do physical exercise if it's going to
increase your worrying," he said.
While exercise may take care of the
physical aspects of anxiety, it may
only heighten the worrying part.
' If when you go exercise," Daher
added, "you're still worried about
your work, then you're not taking

care of the worrying aspect.
"For some people, competitive
sports may be a way for lots of ex
ercise, release of tension, and no
worry at all. For other people, com
petitive sports may only add to the
worrying aspect and anxiety."
Daher also emphasized the bene
fits of a balance between work and
play. It is important to allot time for
both, he said. "Toallow all yourtime
for work isn't efficient, but to allow
90 percent for play isn't efficient
either."
The psychologist admitted that "it
can be difficult for students to give
themselves clear permission to
play," but it is important to do so.
"One of the consequences can be
that you have a period of time where
you're not worried about your work
load."
Other ways to deal with anxiety,

according to Daher, are getting ade
quate sleep, taking one thing at a
time, and talking problems out with
friends. Taking things one at a time
an "give one a sense of ability to gain
control," Daher said.
Daher also suggested "writing
people letters who you owe letters
to. To make a gesture to concern,
kindness, consideration and atten
tiveness can help to break up }he
mood of studying."
Senior Valerie Brett agrees. "I like
towrite letters when I've beenstudy
ing really hard. It takes my mind off
of this competitive world and back
to the midwest."
Finally, Daher said it is"important
to avoid substance abuse — alcohol
and drugs. They work particularly
well to relieve worry, but in the long
run they complicate the issue."
