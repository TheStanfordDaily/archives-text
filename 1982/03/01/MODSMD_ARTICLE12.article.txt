## A
						case of budget deficiency 
### 
When President Ronald Reagan
took office in 1981, many people
were hoping for a change. Thirteen
months later, there has indeed been
a change — a change for the worse.
Over the past year, we have wit
nessed soaring interest rates, record
unemployment and a deepening re
cession. The once loudly-applauded
Reagan economic program now
stands in serious doubt. Nowhere is
this more obvious than in the area of
budget deficits.
After originally promising to bal
ance the budget by 1983 (and maybe
even by 1982), Reagan soon shifted
this target date to 1984. Several
months later, he quietly abandoned
the goal of a balanced budget.
By early December, it had become
clear exactly why the administration
had relinquished its objective of
eliminating budget deficits. Official
estimates projected an astounding
$109 billion deficit for fiscal year 1982,
and even more amazing deficits of
$152 billion for 1983 and $162 billion
for 1984.
Although the fiscal 1983 budget
submitted by Reagan last month pre
dicts somewhat lower annual deficits
(dipping to the $90-100 billion
range), virtually all outside experts
believe that the administration's fig
ures are far too optimistic and that
the forecasts released in December
are much more likely to occur. In
deed, the Congressional Budget Of
fice has recently estimated that the
deficit could climb as high as $188
billion by 1984 and to more than $200
billion a year thereafter.
Furthermore, even under the op
timistic assumptions used by the ad
ministration to reach its lower fig

ures, the deficits could still amount to
a record of nearly $300 billion over
the next three years — a total only
slightly lower than the sum of all the
deficits incurred by the Nixon, Ford
and Carter administrations.
Confronted by these staggering
figures, many in the administration
have tried to claim that they are not
really responsible for the deficits.
Previous administrations, they argue,
created such a dismal economic situ
ation that the size of the current defi
cits was unavoidable.
But, in fact, these assertions are
highly misleading. The huge multi
year tax cuts passed last summer have
significantly diminished revenues —
revenues that could otherwise be
used to help reduce the deficit. The
supply-side notion of increasing rev
enues through tax cuts turned out to
be just as naive as many had warned it
would be all along.
As the tax cut accelerates and tax
expenditures surge over the next few
years, lost revenues will increase dra
matically, exceeding $150 billion by
1984. Additional problems will arise
when inflation indexing begins in
1985.
Also contributing to the deficits is
the fact that the Reagan adminis
tration has not succeeded in ap
preciably reducing government
spending (or even the growth in gov
ernment spending), despite its inten
tions to do so. The administration
has, to be sure, pursued a different
pattern of expenditures, emphasiz
ing military spending over social pro
grams. But it has simply not cut the
overall budget in any meaningful
way; nor is it likely to do so.
While seeking to pass off much of
the blame for the budget deficits
onto its predecessors, the adminis
tration has also been attempting to
downplay the significance of the
projected gaps. Even Treasury Secre

tary Donald Reagan, who earlier
called budget deficits the "number
one cause of inflation," now has
claimed that the deficits don't really
matter that much, after all.
It is unfortunate that Reagan and
his advisers have so quickly gone
back on their principles. The fact is
that the deficits will have profound
implications for the long-term future
of the economy, as the following
considerations indicate:
First, the deficits will be infla
tionary. The administration's main
strategy for combating inflation thus
far has been to accept severe con
straints on monetary growth. Mone
tary policy, however, cannot be ex
ecuted in isolation; it must be ac
companied by a sound fiscal policy. If
budget deficits continue indefinitely,
the money markets and the general
public will assume that monetary re
straint must eventually be aban
doned in order to finance the deficit.
Under such circumstances, investors
and consumers will take steps to
guard against future inflation, and
the tight-money policies will not
have their intended effect.
Second, the deficits will drive in
terest rates even higher than they are
now. To finance its deficits, the gov
ernment must borrow large sums of
money, in direct competition with
borrowers from the private sector. As
deficit-induced borrowing increases,
there is less capital available to meet
private demand. And as loan demand
— both public and private — outruns
supply, interest rates go up and
private borrowers are "crowded
out."
Economic forecasters expect that
the deficit in 1982 will absorb as much
as 26-27 percent of total financing in
capital markets. That would be
higher than even the 25.8 percent fig
ure recorded in 1976, the year of the

previous record deficit.
Moreover, if off-budget expen
dituresand new loan guarantee com
mitments are included, the propor
tion of federal borrowing could ac
tually reach 45-50 percent this year.
And that may be only the beginning.
The percentage could rise substan
tially in 1983 and 1984, particularly if
economic growth remains slow.
Given the especially difficult prob
lems of financing the enormous defi
cits that lie ahead, the administration
will face an unpleasant choice: either
to maintain a tight-money policy and
allow interest rates to skyrocket or to
ease restrictions on the money supp
ly and risk setting off a new round of
inflation.
No matter which alternative is
selected, the revitalization and ex

pansion of industry — a basic goal of
the administration — will be serious
ly hindered.
Finally, the deficits will perpetuate
themselves and create more deficits.
In each succeeding year, the govern
ment must continue to pay interest
on the already-accumulated debt
(and, indeed, interest payments are
now the most rapidly growing item in
the budget). These financing costs
result in more borrowing, which in
turn creates a larger deficit, which in
turn leads to more borrowing, and so
on into the future. As time passes, it
becomes increasingly unlikely that a
balanced budget will ever be ac
complished.
With the national debt already in
excess of $1 trillion, there are, of
course, limits on what can be

achieved in the near term. But if, as
now forecast, the administration
augments that total by 45 percent or
more over the next three years, it
may jeopardize the prospects for a
truly healthy economy for decades to
come.
The Reagan administration should
have retained a balanced budget as
one of its highest priorities. It is
foolish to believe that lasting eco
nomic recovery can be achieved on
an unsound foundation. But, un
fortunately, the administration has
set its courses, and, as a result, the
economy will continue to de
terioriate.
