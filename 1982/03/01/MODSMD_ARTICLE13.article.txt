## Time-limit concept miscredited 
### 
The basis of effective cooperation between students
and administrators in University policy-making is trust —
a belief that while disagreements may occur, both sides
will represent the other's positions and opinions fairly
and be willing to take responsibility for their own. In
their Daily column of Feb. 23, Rodger Whitney and Jan
Marx (Assistant Deans of Student Affairs and Directors of
the Housing Center and Escondido Village, respectively)
have violated„that trust, for their column distorts the his
torical record of the origins of time limits for graduate
housing.
Whitney and Marx give the impression that the con
cept of time limits first came from students, indeed, that
the student members of the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee (GHAC) urged the adoption of time limits
and that Whitney and Marx merely responded to this de
mand with "several moderate time-limit options." They
paint a picture, too, of graduate students initiating the
idea of giving priority to first-year students. As student
members of GHAC from its inception through last
spring, we feel that our reputations, as well as the truth
itself, are badly served by this account of events. Minutes
of committee meetings reveal a different story.
At the very first committee meeting of April 17, 1980,
Marx and Whitney distributed a list of possible topics for
discussion including "Time limit for on-campus hous
ing: TGR; 4 years; 5 years; different limits for different
programs." At the next meeting Whitney delegated the
time limit issue to himself, Marx and Pat Weiss of the
Graduate Program Office; no students were included in
this study group.
The concept of time limits for housing was included in
a list of discussion topics distributed by Marx and
Whitney to the committee at its first meeting in April
1980, but the full dimensions of the issue first surfaced at
the meeting of May 19. During discussion it became clear
to the students that "we were considering two wholly
different levels of problems at once: are we trying to deal
with the minority who stay very long (e.g. those who are
not working expeditiously toward their degree) or are
we trying to deal with the fact that we have much less
graduate housing than we'd like to have?" (From GHAC
Minutes). Unfortunately, Whitney and Marx continued
to discuss time-limit proposals without making an ex
plicit decision as to which of these problems they wanted
to address. Although no action was taken at this time, it is
clear that administrators took the lead in proposing time
limits as early as the spring of 1980, a year before the cur
rent policy was decided upon.
That fall, the committee was informed that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons felt that first-year graduate
students should have priority in housing. While we rec
ognized the benefits this would have for incoming stu
dents (admirably detailed by Whitney and Marx in their
column), we also expressed preferences for other priori
ty schemes. From this point on, however, we recognized
that opening up more spaces for first-year students was

an additional goal included in the committee's charge.
First, last and always, the students saw this goal as coming
directly from Dean Lyons.
Time limits again became the central item on the
GHAC agenda during March and April of 1981, but no
agreement was reached on any specific proposal ad
vocated by the Graduate Deans Advisory Council of the
Graduate Division and approved with slight changes by
the Residential Education policy committee.
This plan would set non-renewable on-campus hous
ing limits of one year for MA/MS students and two years
for Ph.D. candidates without children, and twice these
limits for students with children. (This is what Whitney
and Marx describes in their column as a "moderate"
proposal, "designed to stimulate turn-over on campus
and prevent abuses.") In discussing this proposal, stu
dents pointed out that it imposed unequal burdens on
students in different programs and in different family sit
uations and that it locked into University housing policy
an inflexible that made it difficult to plan for changes in
demand or supply.
Dean Lyons, who attended this meeting at the invita
tion of student members, stressed his commitment to
open up more spaces for incoming graduate students. At
this point David Kraus, then a third-year law student,
came up with a proposal for a one-year housing period
renewable by lottery. If the principal goal was to assure
housing priority for new students, he argued, then the
most direct way to do this would be to designate a ma
jority of the available housing for new students and al
locate the remainder to returning students by a lottery.
This proposal was endorsed by the other students on the
committee. But it is important to understand why we en
dorsed it.i
We never initiated or approved of the idea of time lim
its in the first place. Student members repeatedly urged
that the GHAC devote more of its attention to planning
for building additional graduate student housing as soon
as possible, not leaving it as a vague wish for the "suit by
and-by." But it was obvious, first, that Whitney and Marx
felt the need to use time limits as well as the problem of
people staying for many years, and second, that strong
pressure to give priority to first-year students was com
ing from Dean Lyons. Giventhatsomethingwasdefinite
ly going to be done, we chose David Kraus's proposal as
the most direct, least unfair and most flexible way to
achieve the University's goals and certainly preferable to
the "arbitrary limit to years on campus" (as Whitney and
Marx describe it) then under consideration by the Uni
versity.
In retrospect, we still would choose this alternative;
we cannot, however, accept the degree of credit for the
concept which Marx and Whitney would attribute to the
students on the committee.

this point David Kraus, then a third-year law student,
came up with a proposal for a one-year housing period
renewable by lottery. If the principal goal was to assure
housing priority for new students, he argued, then the
most direct way to do this would be to designate a ma
jority of the available housing for new students and al
locate the remainder to returning students by a lottery.
This proposal was endorsed by the other students on the
committee. But it is important to understand why we en
dorsed it.i
We never initiated or approved of the idea of time lim
its in the first place. Student members repeatedly urged
that the GHAC devote more of its attention to planning
for building additional graduate student housing as soon
as possible, not leaving it as a vague wish for the "suit by
and-by." But it was obvious, first, that Whitney and Marx
felt the need to use time limits as well as the problem of
people staying for many years, and second, that strong
pressure to give priority to first-year students was com
ing from Dean Lyons. Giventhatsomethingwasdefinite
ly going to be done, we chose David Kraus's proposal as
the most direct, least unfair and most flexible way to
achieve the University's goals and certainly preferable to
the "arbitrary limit to years on campus" (as Whitney and
Marx describe it) then under consideration by the Uni
versity.
In retrospect, we still would choose this alternative;
we cannot, however, accept the degree of credit for the
concept which Marx and Whitney would attribute to the
students on the committee.

The basis of effective cooperation between students
and administrators in University policy-making is trust —
a belief that while disagreements may occur, both sides
will represent the other's positions and opinions fairly
and be willing to take responsibility for their own. In
their Daily column of Feb. 23, Rodger Whitney and Jan
Marx (Assistant Deans of Student Affairs and Directors of
the Housing Center and Escondido Village, respectively)
have violated„that trust, for their column distorts the his
torical record of the origins of time limits for graduate
housing.
Whitney and Marx give the impression that the con
cept of time limits first came from students, indeed, that
the student members of the Graduate Housing Advisory
Committee (GHAC) urged the adoption of time limits
and that Whitney and Marx merely responded to this de
mand with "several moderate time-limit options." They
paint a picture, too, of graduate students initiating the
idea of giving priority to first-year students. As student
members of GHAC from its inception through last
spring, we feel that our reputations, as well as the truth
itself, are badly served by this account of events. Minutes
of committee meetings reveal a different story.
At the very first committee meeting of April 17, 1980,
Marx and Whitney distributed a list of possible topics for
discussion including "Time limit for on-campus hous
ing: TGR; 4 years; 5 years; different limits for different
programs." At the next meeting Whitney delegated the
time limit issue to himself, Marx and Pat Weiss of the
Graduate Program Office; no students were included in
this study group.
The concept of time limits for housing was included in
a list of discussion topics distributed by Marx and
Whitney to the committee at its first meeting in April
1980, but the full dimensions of the issue first surfaced at
the meeting of May 19. During discussion it became clear
to the students that "we were considering two wholly
different levels of problems at once: are we trying to deal
with the minority who stay very long (e.g. those who are
not working expeditiously toward their degree) or are
we trying to deal with the fact that we have much less
graduate housing than we'd like to have?" (From GHAC
Minutes). Unfortunately, Whitney and Marx continued
to discuss time-limit proposals without making an ex
plicit decision as to which of these problems they wanted
to address. Although no action was taken at this time, it is
clear that administrators took the lead in proposing time
limits as early as the spring of 1980, a year before the cur
rent policy was decided upon.
That fall, the committee was informed that Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons felt that first-year graduate
students should have priority in housing. While we rec
ognized the benefits this would have for incoming stu
dents (admirably detailed by Whitney and Marx in their
column), we also expressed preferences for other priori
ty schemes. From this point on, however, we recognized
that opening up more spaces for first-year students was

an additional goal included in the committee's charge.
First, last and always, the students saw this goal as coming
directly from Dean Lyons.
Time limits again became the central item on the
GHAC agenda during March and April of 1981, but no
agreement was reached on any specific proposal ad
vocated by the Graduate Deans Advisory Council of the
Graduate Division and approved with slight changes by
the Residential Education policy committee.
This plan would set non-renewable on-campus hous
ing limits of one year for MA/MS students and two years
for Ph.D. candidates without children, and twice these
limits for students with children. (This is what Whitney
and Marx describes in their column as a "moderate"
proposal, "designed to stimulate turn-over on campus
and prevent abuses.") In discussing this proposal, stu
dents pointed out that it imposed unequal burdens on
students in different programs and in different family sit
uations and that it locked into University housing policy
an inflexible that made it difficult to plan for changes in
demand or supply.
