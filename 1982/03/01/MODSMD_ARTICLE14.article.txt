## Housing: fair as in Pharaoh 
### 
Let me tell you my objections to
the University's new graduate stu
dent housing policy regarding limit
ing the duration of residence.
First, I want to discuss the issue of
"fairness," because although I do not
live by such socialistic values myself,
apparently the University does. Di
rector of Escondido Village Housing
Jan Marx, asserted in an open letter
to Escondido Village residents that
the motivating drive behind this
change in policy was a desire to be
more fair to all concerned. For some
graduate students to obtain relatively
inexpensive housing by chance while
others do not is, indeed, inequitable.
However, to spread the unfairness
around does not reduce it! There is
the same amount of unfairness no
matter how it is distributed.
If 5000 graduate students spend
four years each at the University,
there are 20,000 student-years of rent
to be paid. If the University makes
available 1000 graduate housing
units, it can provide 4000 student
years of lower rent during that time.
There remain 16,000 student-years of
higher rent no matter who pays it
when! The new policy is no more fair.
Let me offer an analogy. If the
pharoah is determined to kill 20,000
male chidren, killing one child in

each of 20,000 families is no more fair
than killing four children in each of
5000 families. Nor is killing 10,000
girls along with 10,000 boys. The only
way for the pharaoh is to be more fair
is for him to kill fewer children.

Limiting duration of
stay is a mistaken — if
not deceptive —
smokescreen which
avoids and obscures
the only real issue of
graduate housing:
the number of
housing units
available.

And the only way for the University
to reduce the total amount of unfair
ness in graduate housing is to pro
vide more housing units.
Limiting duration of stay is a mis
taken — if not deceptive —
smokescreen which avoids and ob
scures the only real issue of graduate
housing: the number of housing

units available. If the University re
fuses to provide graduate housing in
the same spirit with which it provides
undergraduate housing, let it say so
honestly. This talk of "fairness"
doesn't fool me.
Second, I.want to discuss the issue
of agreements and contracts. I have
in my possession a copy of my Escon
dido Village Apartment Rental
Agreement signed by you and me
June 25, 1980. It stipulates the terms
and conditions of my occupancy. In
particular, it lists the reasons for
which the University may evict me.
"The University deciding it wants to
spread around the unfairness" isn't
one of them.
.This document clearly states that:
1) occupancy continues month to
month until the Tenant or the Uni
versity terminates occupancy; 2) The
University may terminate occupancy
on three conditions: cessation of stu
dent eligibility, violation of apart
ment rules, or failure to pay rent; 3)
the agreement may be changed only,
in writing signed by both parties, ex
cept that the University may change
the apartment rules and eligibility
regulations according to certain pro
visions; 4) the apartment rules cover
matters such as noise, waterbeds,
pets etc., and are irrelevant to the
matter at hand; 5) the provision for
changing the eligibility regulations
is: "The foregoing regulations may
be changed by the University at any
time, without notice, but any
changes will be prospective only and
not to impair or terminate existing
tenancies."
The University is attempting to
break its agreement with me. I do not
grant it the right to unilaterally
change our agreement, just as it does
not grant me that right. I don't get to
unilaterally throw out the quietness
rule and the University does not get
to unilaterally adopt a duration-of
stay-rule.
If the University wants tochange its
agreement with me, it does not get to
do so unilaterally; nor does it get to
do so after talking to some advisory
council: the University must talk to
me. And I have to agree. As it hap
pens, I don't. That's the way business
is conducted in America: you make
agreements and you live by them.
If the University wants to make a
different agreement with new resi
dents, that's between the University
and them; it's none of my business.
But the University has an agreement
with me and I expect the University
to abide by it.
In summary, limiting duration of
graduate student residence does not
make the University Housing Policy
more fair. Only increasing the
amount of housing available can do
that. The University has an agree
ment with me in egard to my dura
tion of stay. The agreement prohibits
the University from introducing new
grounds for terminating my tenancy,
and I intend to enforce it.
