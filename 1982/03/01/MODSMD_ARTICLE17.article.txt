## A
						visit to the baylands 
### Anthea Stratigos 
Seagulls circle the wet
marshlands below; the sound
of ducks quacking as they
make the rounds of "their"
pond can be heard from the
boardwalk.
Amid this seaside setting
atop a salt marsh at the end of
Embarcadero Road in Palo
Alto, school children wander
from exhibit to exhibit at the
Baylands Nature Center, in
vestigating local wildlife.
The Lucy Evans Baylands Na
ture Interpretive Center pre
serves the 120-acre marshland
that once extended west of the
Bayshore freeway, in addition
to serving as an interpreter to
educate visitors about the
ecological niche.
Built on more than 50 pilings,
it features a lecture room, read
ing and exhibit areas, a labora
tory, an exposed deck area and
a boardwalk which provides
access into the marsh — even
during high tide.
The center operates under
the philosophy that you can't
take one thing from nature
without affecting everything
else. The marsh is living proof
of this philosophy. Surrounded
by life, it is an example of a deli
cate food web and offers in
formation on the many dif
ferent types of marsh plants,
mice, marine animals (micro
scopic and otherwise) and
birds which inhabit the
baylands.
Visited by approximately 500

visitorseach weekend, the cen
ter provides a conducive at
mosphere to both relax and in
vestigate the local wildlife.
Exhibits, movies, slide shows,
guided nature walks and
ecology workshops, which
open the microscopic world of
the marsh to humans are all of
fered there. Though it has been
a victim of financial cutbacks,
volunteer workers have
enabled the center to maintain
its services.
The center, which co-exists
with the Junior Museum and
Foothills Park Nature In
terpretive Center was con
structed in 1969 and is under
the jurisdiction of the Arts and
Sciences Division of the City of
Palo Alto.
It was built in response to the
growing awareness of the en
vironmental significance of
that part of Palo Alto, said Ted
Chanik, a naturalist who works
at the center. According to
Chanik, the center was named
for Lucy Evans, a long-time Palo
Alto historian and conserva
tionist.
Despite cutbacks, "we have
proven we are serving an im
portant function for citizens,"
said Chandik who claims that
the city has recognized the im
portant function the center
serves.
One of the favorite uses of
the center is birdwatching. Be
cause there are no trees in

which they can hide and be
cause the birds there are easily
categorized, it is a good place
to watch the more than 150
kinds of flying creatures in the
area.
"Easy access (makes) it a big
attraction for people who are
casually attracted to birds,"
said Chandik.
Chandik attributes the cen
ter's popularity to its ability to
"make people feel good about
learning." It is a "neat realiza
tion" when people sense dis
covery and visually see the
things in nature that happen in
a short time at the center,
Chandik said.
Photography exhibits cur
rently on display include black
and white shots of birds in their
habitat. Soaring in the sky or
floating atop the bay, the
photos are crisp and clear and
the birds beautifully portrayed.
The center is open from 2
p.m. until 5 p.m. Wednesday
through Friday for certain mid
week programs. A fee is
charged and the programs are
generally visited by grammar
school groups. The programs
for children allow them an op
portunity for "hands-on"
learning. Microscopes, nets
and binoculars are all a part of
their life and conservation
studies, Chandik explained.
Weekend activities are free of
cost and open to visitors of all
ages.
