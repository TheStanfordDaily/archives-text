# High-pressure sodium to light Roth Way
## Energy-efficient new lights to be tested 
### Susan McCarthy 
A test installation of high-pressure
sodium (HSP) lights will be the first
step in a University study of the bene
fitsof converting all outdoor lighting
on campus to this energy-saving
form.
The Office of Planning will put up
the test lights along Roth Way be
tween Lomita Drive and Campus
Drive as soon as necessary parts ar
rive.
A joint proposal of the Energy Pro
gram Office and the Office of Plan
ning for the conversion of about 40
percent of the campus's current
mercury-vapor pole-mounted out
door lights projects a savings of
$43,000 a year after the conversion of
750 lights.
HPS lights give "almost twice as
much light using the same amount of
energy," according to Cari Johnson
of the Energy Programs Office. In ad
dition, the bulbs need replacing less
often. Johnson said that although
both mercury-vapor and HPS bulbs
are listed as having a life of 24,000
hours, the economic life of a
mercury-vapor bulb is only 16,000

hours, since they eventually fade and
must be replaced even though they
have not completely given out.
Johnson said that, under a pilot
program, the University might re
ceive an incentive rebate from PG&E
of around $29,000 if the conversion is
completed in time. Johnson expects
PG&E to make an offer in aboutthree
weeks. The University would then
have four months to convert the
lights.
Johnson said that the conversion,
which would cost more than
$200,000, would produce a payback
in slightly less than four years.
Some areas using the HPS lights
have reported that the bulbs
don't last as long as anticipated, but,
according to Johnson, the difference
is a small one, and the HPS bulbs
would yield an energy savings even if
they lasted no longer than mercury
vjpoi- bulbs--. -* -
In a November 1981 meeting, the
Administrative Council expressed
concern over possible difficulties
with visual perception under the
high-pressure sodium lights and sug
gested further study.
Three seniors in the Human

Biology program, Debbie Singer,
Gloria Browning and Debbie
Guatelli, had planned to do a study
on reactions to the Roth Way lights,
but due to the delay in installation,
had to change the focus of their
study. They researched the literature
on the subject and drew up recom
mendations for the eventual study by
the Office of Planning.
Singer said their research confirms
the lower energy consumption
claimed for HPS lights. "It's very
clearcut that there is a definite sav
ings and it's quite substantial," she
said.
They recommend more financial
analysis of the possible conversion of
other outdoor lighting, such as the
exterior lights on buildings.
When HPS lights were first de
signed, Singer said, they were called
'security lights', because of the in
•fieawrl-amount of light they shed.
Studies have yielded inconclusive re
sults. Some localities that have
switched to HPS lighting have re
ported crime down, but others re
port no change.
In laboratory experiments color
perception is poorer under HPS light.

In one San Diego study, however, it
was tound that people prefer the col
or perception under HPS.
Singer said that, after doing the
study, her personal opinion is that
the University should switch to HPS
lighting.
HPS lights are already up in a few
places on campus. They may be seen
at the blood bank, by Synergy House,
on the service road behind the
museum, and on the new extension
of Campus Drive. They are also upon
parts of highways 101 and 280, and on
El Camino in some towns. HPS lights
are increasingly being used all over
the state.
The proposal is to convert first
street lights, then parking lot lights,
then major path lights. This would
represent about 40 percent of the
pole mounted outdoor lights, in
ducing all those of the higher wat
tag^v

Way goes up, the Office of Planning
will assess community reaction, from
the points of view of aesthetics, per
sonal safety and traffic safety, before
deciding whether to convert any
more outdoor lighting.

In a November 1981 meeting, the
Administrative Council expressed
concern over possible difficulties
with visual perception under the
high-pressure sodium lights and sug
gested further study.
Three seniors in the Human

Biology program, Debbie Singer,
Gloria Browning and Debbie
Guatelli, had planned to do a study
on reactions to the Roth Way lights,
but due to the delay in installation,
had to change the focus of their
study. They researched the literature
on the subject and drew up recom
mendations for the eventual study by
the Office of Planning.
Singer said their research confirms
the lower energy consumption
claimed for HPS lights. "It's very
clearcut that there is a definite sav
ings and it's quite substantial," she
said.
They recommend more financial
analysis of the possible conversion of
other outdoor lighting, such as the
exterior lights on buildings.
When HPS lights were first de
signed, Singer said, they were called
'security lights', because of the in
•fieawrl-amount of light they shed.
Studies have yielded inconclusive re
sults. Some localities that have
switched to HPS lighting have re
ported crime down, but others re
port no change.
In laboratory experiments color
perception is poorer under HPS light.

In one San Diego study, however, it
was tound that people prefer the col
or perception under HPS.
Singer said that, after doing the
study, her personal opinion is that
the University should switch to HPS
lighting.
HPS lights are already up in a few
places on campus. They may be seen
at the blood bank, by Synergy House,
on the service road behind the
museum, and on the new extension
of Campus Drive. They are also upon
parts of highways 101 and 280, and on
El Camino in some towns. HPS lights
are increasingly being used all over
the state.
The proposal is to convert first
street lights, then parking lot lights,
then major path lights. This would
represent about 40 percent of the
pole mounted outdoor lights, in
ducing all those of the higher wat
tag^v
After the test installation on Roth
Way goes up, the Office of Planning
will assess community reaction, from
the points of view of aesthetics, per
sonal safety and traffic safety, before
deciding whether to convert any
more outdoor lighting.
A test installation of high-pressure
sodium (HSP) lights will be the first
step in a University study of the bene
fitsof converting all outdoor lighting
on campus to this energy-saving
form.
The Office of Planning will put up
the test lights along Roth Way be
tween Lomita Drive and Campus
Drive as soon as necessary parts ar
rive.
A joint proposal of the Energy Pro
gram Office and the Office of Plan
ning for the conversion of about 40
percent of the campus's current
mercury-vapor pole-mounted out
door lights projects a savings of
$43,000 a year after the conversion of
750 lights.
HPS lights give "almost twice as
much light using the same amount of
energy," according to Cari Johnson
of the Energy Programs Office. In ad
dition, the bulbs need replacing less
often. Johnson said that although
both mercury-vapor and HPS bulbs
are listed as having a life of 24,000
hours, the economic life of a
mercury-vapor bulb is only 16,000

hours, since they eventually fade and
must be replaced even though they
have not completely given out.
Johnson said that, under a pilot
program, the University might re
ceive an incentive rebate from PG&E
of around $29,000 if the conversion is
completed in time. Johnson expects
PG&E to make an offer in aboutthree
weeks. The University would then
have four months to convert the
lights.
Johnson said that the conversion,
which would cost more than
$200,000, would produce a payback
in slightly less than four years.
Some areas using the HPS lights
have reported that the bulbs
don't last as long as anticipated, but,
according to Johnson, the difference
is a small one, and the HPS bulbs
would yield an energy savings even if
they lasted no longer than mercury
