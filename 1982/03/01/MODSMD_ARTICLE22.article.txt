# Katz, Perkins qualify for NCAA'S

### Mark Kerber 
Stanford's trio of Mullen,
'erkins, and Katz wrestled with
ntensity and courage in last
light's Pac-10 Championships,
>ut two unpopular calls cost
he Cardinal a championship
ind a national qualifier.
The first of the questionable
decisions came in the final sec
ands of 177-pounder Doug
Perkin's championship match.
After defeating his first two op
ponents 16-5 and 15-1, Perkins
had his hands full in the finals.
Tall and lanky Jim
Baumgardner of Oregon State
frustrated the Cardinal grap
pler through the early going,
using his leverage advantage to
gain a 4-1 lead, but Perkins re
fused to give up. Suddenly, late
in the final period, Perkins

rolled Baumgardner to his back
for a reversal, a near fall, and a
5-4 lead. But the Beaver
scrambled free for an escape,
sending the match into over
time.
The overtime was even more
frustrating. Perkins again fell
behind early, but came storm
ing back with a big closing
furry. With only seconds re
maining, Perkins executed a
beautiful lifting double leg at
tack. As he brought
Baumgardner to the mat, the
partisan crowd exploded. But
then there was silence. The
head official hesitated, then
asked the mat judge for a rul
ing. No takedown. Again the
crowd exploded, this time with
a chorus of boos.
Perkins still qualified for na

tionals, but the loss was a tough
one for the intense junior to
take.
The other questionable call
did not occur until Maples Pa
vilion was empty and dark. To
qualify for nationals, a wrestler
must either finish in the top
two in the Pac-10, or be voted
in as one of ten wild card selec
tions. Thus, most third place
finishers earned a trip to Ames
lowa for the national tour
nament.
Mullen, after losing in the
first round to top seeded Joe
Koeth of Arizona State, came
back with two convincing wins.
First he put away Jeff Smyth of
Oregon State. Then he sub
dued Washington State's Don
Hanson 8-4 to lock up third
place.

To leave Mullen home,
Pac-10 officials would have to
take a fourth place finisher.
When coach Chris Horpel
emerged from the meeting, he
announced that Mullen had
been refused a national birth.
Ed Katz, who also finished
third, could not be rejected.
Katz' only loss was a last second
heartbreaker to eventual
champion Gene Webb of Ore
gon State. Katz gave the champ
all he wanted as they battled
through every second of a 6-5
decision. Webb then easily
took the title with a controlled
7-3 victory.
Oregon took the team
trophy, edging Oregon State.
Arizona State was third, fol
lowed by Washington State
and Stanford.
