# Lever, Smith fly past Card; DiBiaso leaves with a bang
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Everything changed but the
outcome.
The scattered die-hards at
Maples got excited, the Stan
ford players got excited and
Dick Dißiaso, coaching his final
home game at Stanford, yeh,
he got excited too.
Saturday, it was all for
naught as Arizona forward
Frank Smith scored a career
high 27 points to lead the Wild
cats past Stanford 72-67.
Friday, Walt Stone sank four
clutch free throws in the last 10
seconds as Arizona State
nipped Stanford 70-69.
Arizona, behind Smith's 19
first-half points stormed out to
a 38-33 half time lead.
Stanford trailed 29-28 with
2:23 remaining in the half
when referee Ron Labetich
called a questionable travelling
call on Stanford forward Kent
Seymour.
Dißiaso exploded and was
slapped with only his second
technical foul of the season —
he had none last year. By the
time the 2754 fans at Maples Pa
vilion could explode and
Dißiaso could shout "what!",
he was given another techni
cal.
John Vlahogeorge sank
three of the four technical foul
shots and Keith Jackson con

nected on an offensive re
bound after the Arizona in
bounds to give the Wildcats a
36-29 edge.
The real story emerged un
der the basket in the battle be
tween Smith and Stanford cen
ter John Revelli.
Revelli scored 24 points and
grabbed nine rebounds to
counter Smith's 27 points and
10 rebounds.
Stanford fought back to take
a 65-64 lead with 1:54 remain
ing.
Senior guard Doug Marty,
who along with Brian Welch
and Orlando Ward was playing
his final home game of his ca
reer, hit a wide-open Revelli
underneath.
Revelli laid the ball in, but
Arizona reclaimed the lead
when forward Jack Magno hita
jumper from the side at the
other end.
Stanford missed on the con
version and guard Donald
Mellon scooted unmolested
through a drawn-out Cardinal
zone giving Arizona a three
point lead.
Greg Cook then picked off a
Stanford pass and broke down
the court when Johnny Rogers
fouled him from behind to pre
vent the basket.
Cook flew off the court in a
heap and had to be helped to

the bench. Vlahogeorge came
on to sink another designated
free throw.
After a Stanford miss, Arizo
na called time out and Cook re
turned.
Play resumed and Marty hit a
streaking Welch with a football
pass down the left sideline and
Welch hit a waiting Cook in
full-stride to pick up a charging
foul.
Cook again had to be helped
from the floor, but the game
was decided.
A rizona coach Fred
Snowden, who along with
Dißiaso decided to retire after
the season, credited Smith and
his bench strength with the
win.
"We got excellent help from
the bench tonight." Snowden
said, "I would have to say that
was the difference. Frank Smith
played a solid game and I
thought Cook showed a lot of
courage with his defense."
Dißiaso also credited Smith.
"He's agile, he's quick and
he's up there higher than you
think," Dißiaso said, "They did
a great job of getting the ball
into him and gearing their of
fense to him in the first half."
Smith credited Revelli after
their tough match-up under
neath.
