## Jaeger upsets Lloyd in Oakland 
### Associated Press 
Oakland â€” Andrea
Jaeger came of age in women's
tennis Sunday with her first vic
tory over Chris Evert Lloyd, 7-6,
6-4, to win the $150,000 Avon
Championship for the second
straight year.
Jaeger, a 16-year-old from
Chicago, seemed like a mirror
image of Lloyd with her two
fisted backhand, high lobs, deft
drop shots and powerful
baseline strokes.
But Jaeger added to that
arsenal a scrappiness and de
sire that Lloyd lacked. It was
Lloyd's first tournament in two
monthsand Jaegartook advan
tage of that layoff to run the 27-
year-old veteran around the
court and win the $30,000 top
prize.
Jaeger, who lost six previous
matches against Lloyd, fell be
hind in the first set with a
number of unforced errors,
but charged back from a 2-5

deficit to win in a tiebreaker.
Talking aloud to herself, slap
ping her leg and breaking
Lloyd's rhythm with timely
pauses to wipe off her racket,
Jaeger refused to quit.
In the ninth game of the first
set, Lloyd was two points from
winning the set but Jaeger ran
her from sideline to sideline
and broke on a crosscourt fore
hand out of Lloyd's reach.
Jaeger held at love, nearly
broke Lloyd in the 11th game,
then forced the tiebreaker on a
winning net cord.
In the tiebreaker, both
players were erratic. Evert lost
on service four times, includ
ing a double fault. Leading 6-5,
Jaeger slapped a forehand into
the net and angrily cried out
"gimme a break." That's exact
ly what she got, breaking
Lloyd's next serve to win the
tiebreaker 7-5 and take the first
set in 1 hour, 21 minutes.
Jaeger needed only a half

hour to win the second set,
coming back this time from 1-3
to take the match as Lloyd
seemed to tire. In the last game
of the match, Evert double
faulted to fall behind 15-40,
saved one match point then
lost it on wide forehand.
Llovd, the top-ranked wom
en's player, came back to win
after dropping the first set
against Jaeger in their last two
encounters in 1981 but
couldn't do it this time.
"I wasn't patient enough,"
Lloyd said. "Andrea was mixing
the pace a lot, she was hitting
hard, blooping it up and it
worked."
Lloyd said the fact she'd
beaten Jaeger so many times
previously put more pressure
on her.
"Vou build up a certain pres
sure when you've beaten
someone and now it's broken
and next time I'll be more

eager to pla\ her.
Jaeger is oil to a strong start
this year, reaching the finals of
three of the tour tournaments
she's entered and winning the
Avon tournament in Detroit.
She is now in second place on
the women s money list this
year, behind Martina

"Everyone is out there try ing
to improve in the rankings, I'm
just trying to improve my
game," Jaeger said. "I don't
even think about being ranked
fourth in the world. If I win the
big tournaments, like
Wimbledon and the U.S.
Open, then I can think about
being number one
Jaeger said the importance
of the victor\ didn t strike her
even though she felt she was
about to win the match in the
second set
It doesn ; really sink in right
awav," she said. It was sort of
like it's not reallv happening."
