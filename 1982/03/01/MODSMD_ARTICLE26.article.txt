# 'Stick' fans meet nemesis; Smith joins hated ex-rivals
## 
### Associated Press 
Scottsdale, Ariz. — One day last Septem
ber, the Candlestick Park hecklers so angered
Keggie Smith he charged into the stands to
get at them. Now, as a member of the San
Francisco Giants, he'll be playing in front of
them regularly.
But Smith says he thinks he'll shed the cat
calls and jeers along with his Los Angeles
Dodger blues.
"I think if I play as well for the Giants as I
played against them, that will turn around,"
he said. "I think one of the reasons for the
problems I had was that I did well against the
Giants."
At 37, the perennial all-star outfielder is re
covering from a season and a half of near-in
activity following a severe shoulder injury.
But Giants owner Bob Lurie is willing to bet
$300,000 — plus incentive clauses — this year
that there's still some punch in Smith's bat.
"I'm staying in the game only because

(Giants manager) Frank Robinson, (coach)
Don Buford and Mr. Lurie made me believe
they wanted me, needed mo and would give
me the opportunity to make them a cham
pionship ball club," Smith said.
He had played out his option with the
Dodgers and rejected a larger money offer
from the New York Yankees, despite passing
a strenuous physical examination in New
York.
The switch-hitter brings the Giants, a medi
ocre team in recent years, a lifetime record of
.287, with 296 home runs, 1,036 runs batted in
and a history of winning pennants with the
Dodgers and Boston Red Sox.
Robinson said he wouldn't hand the first
base job to Smith without a fight. "He's not a
proven first baseman. He'll have to beat the
others out of the job," Robinson said, refer
ring to Enos Cabell, Dave Bergman and Doe
Bovland.
