# Fencers foiled at regionals
## 
### Craig Spearman 
Stanford failed to qualify any
fencers for the national tour
nament Saturday competing in
Women's Western Cham
pionships held at San Jose State
Friday and Saturday.
"Psychology is what did us
in," head coach Jean Helliwell
said following the meet. "We
were really psyched out."
There were six teams at the
competition over the week
end. Stanford placed third as a
team, finishing behind San Jose
State and Northridge. The
Spartans dominated with a
70-10 record, while Northridge

finished with a 48-32 record.
In the first day of competi
tion, Stanford had no problems
staying ahead of Northridge.
However, on the second day,
Stanford lost their match with
Northridge 4-12 and this
proved to be the turning point
in the competition. Only the
first and second place teams
qualify for the NCAA Cham
pionships.
The Card "psyche out" was
further reflected in the individ
ual results. None of the
Cardinal women qualified to
go the NCAA's by placing in
the top five of the individual

competition.
One of the biggest disap
pointments of the tournament
was that Pamela Hencke failed
to qualify for the national tour
nament. Hencke had a 14-9
record, and teammate Cathy
Correa finished at 13-10. They
took eighth and ninth place re
spectively.
Even though the Card wom
en did lessthanspectacularthis
weekend, the Stanford fencing
season is not over. Next week
end, the Men's Western Cham
pionship will be held in Long
Beach, California.
