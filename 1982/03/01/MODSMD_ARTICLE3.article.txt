# Cramer nominated as Coffee House president

### Bill Ainsworth 
Chris Cramer, current ASSU
Course Guide project manager, will
be next year's Coffee House presi
dent if approved by the Coffee
House board of trustees tomorrow.
Current Coffee House President
and ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) member Chris Greene said it is
likely that Cramer will gain the
board's approval.
Cramer, who was nominated for
the position by the Presidential
Selection Committee, learned of his
selection last Friday.
If approved, Cramer will become
the first appointed president of the
Coffee House. In the past, Greene
said, the job had been taken by one
of the four members of the COP.

This policy waschanged forseveral
reasons, according to Greene.
Among these were the insufficent
time after COP elections to ade
quately train the new president, and
the feeling that the president should
be elected by the board because they
have to place their confidence in
him, he said.
Another reason for the change was
that there were no guarantees that
each year one of the COP members
would be interested enough and tal
ented enough to run the Coffee
House corporation, Greene said.
Cramer said that his main goal as
president will betoconvinceasmany
students as possible "that drinking
coffee will improve the quality of

their lives" and that the Coffee
House is the best place to drink cof
fee.
Achieving that goal will entail
more advertising, more flyers and
more special events at the Coffee
House, Cramer said.
Cramer also hopes to increase the
sales of the special types of coffee
sold at the Coffee House. "I think
there is a great potential to sell Cof
fee House coffee to students and to
dorms," he said. "I want to make
more dorms aware that it is avail
able," he added.
Cramer vowed to continue the
present policy of keeping prices as
low as possible, and said that he sup
ports the current efforts by the Cof
fee House to construct a patio.
