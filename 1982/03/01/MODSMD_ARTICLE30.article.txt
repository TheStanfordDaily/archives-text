## Simon hearing postponed 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
A preliminary hearing for Stanford
student Robert Simon which was to
have been held last Friday has been
postponed until March 12, because
Simon's defense attorney, William
Keogh, was ill. The Friday hearing
was already a postponement from
the original date, set for Feb. 5.
Simon is charged with two counts
of manslaughter and one count of
felony drunk driving stemming from
a car accident last October in which
two students, Kevin MacMillan and
Michael Becker, were killed.
"(Robert) Simon is entitled to ef
fective counsel from someone with
familarity with the file," said Judge
James Stewart while considering the
defense's request for a delay of hear
ing.
Simon was represented by Alan
Marer, Keogh's partner in Keogh,
Marer and Flicker Attorneys. Marer
said he had received word only the
morning of the hearing that Keogh
would be unable to appear in court.
If convicted on all three counts, Si
mon could face a maximum sentence
of six years in state prison, Keogh told
the Daily earlier this month.
