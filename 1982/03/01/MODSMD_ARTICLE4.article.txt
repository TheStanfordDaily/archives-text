Senate expulsion hearings begin Wednesday
Washington — The Senate is about to begin the job of deciding
whether to make Harrison Williams the first senator to be expelled since
1862.
After several delays, and 10 months after his conviction in the FBI s
Abscam investigation, the Senate opens debate Wednesday on a resolu
tion of expulsion against the New Jersey Democrat.
Williams, 61, has been sentenced to serve three years in prison and
fined $50,000 on charges that he agreed to accept a hidden interest in a
titanium mine in exchange for using his personal influence as a senator
to help the venture obtain military contracts.
Despite private urgings by senior Democrats that he resign, Williams,
a member of the Senate for 22 years, has insisted that he was trapped
into a phony conspiracy by FBI agents using illegal investigatory tech
niques.
He has steadfastly insisted he did nothing illegal, although conceding
some faulty judgment.
The Senate ethics committee recommended unanimously Aug. 25
that Williams be expelled because of his conduct.
He will be defended on the Senate floor by Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii)
who was persuaded to take the job after at least two others declined.
If faced with imminent expulsion, it is expected that Williams will
consider whether to beat the final vote by resigning.
In other business this week, the Senate is expected to vote approval
tomorrow of the toughest anti-busing legislation ever passed by either
house of Congress.
Leniency for non-registrants called for
Washington Congress will be asked this week to eliminate the pos
sibility of jailing hundreds of thousands of young men who failed to
meet yesterday's deadline to register for the draft.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a member of the House Armed Services
Committe, said he plans to introduce legislation this week that would
make non-registration a misdemeanor carrying a maximum fine of $200
and no jail term.
Currently, failure to register within 30 days of one's 18th
birthday is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison
and a $10,000 fine. A grace period for an estimated 900,000
non-registrants born between 1960and February 1964 to sign
up without fear of prosecution expired yesterday.
Aspin said his bill would avoid making "martyrs" out of
draft resisters and boost registration because judges would
be less inclined to let violators off "scot free." if a draft is or
dered, his bill would reimpose the stiffer penalties three
weeks later, he said.
Selective Service Director Thomas Turnage and Attorney
General William French Smith have promised to prosecute
non-registrants, likely beginning in April or May.
But Selective Service spokeswoman Joan Lamb said
latecomers who want to sign up at any U.S. post office won't
be turned away.
The idea, she said, is to get compliance with the law, not
prosecutions. While latecomers technically will be in vio
lation, it isn't likely they will be taken to court, she said.
Lamb said more than 900,000 eligible young men have not
registered, primarily because of confusion over whether the
program would be continued.
President Ronald Reagan originally opposed peacetime
registration, but he changed his mind after martial law was
imposed in Poland and announced on Jan. 7 that it will con
tinue.
Aid proposal called "waste of money"
Washington — Guillermo Ungo, a leader of the
Salvadoran opposition, said yesterday that the Reagan ad
ministration's proposal for increased economic aid to El
Salvador is "a waste of money."
Speaking on Meet the Press (NBC), Ungo said El Salvador
has lost $800 million in capital and $400 million in export in
come in the last two years, and"the American taxpayer is
wasting his money" in providing a new infusion of economic
aid.
"It doesn't go to achieve peace and stability," he added.
"So that money goes down the drain."
At a news conference called to respond to Ungo's charges,
El Salvador's ambassador here, Ernesto Rivas-Gallont, said his
nation has been "drained of its economic resources" by "a
number of factors," one of which is "the terrorism of Mr.
Ungo's followers." The proposed economic aid, the am
bassador said, is "welcome and useful."
In the television interview, Ungo, whose social democratic
party is one of more than a dozen political, labor and pro
fessional organizations making up the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front, reiterated the front'scall for negotiations with
the civilian-military government headed by Jose Napoleon
Duarte. The Democratic Revolutionary Front is allied with
the coalition of Marxist-oriented guerrilla groups fighting to
overthrow the Duarte government.
Ungo was Duarte's running mate in the 1972 presidential
elections, whose results were overturned by the military. He
charged in the television show that his former political ally is
now controlled by the military.
First MXs will be based in existing silos
Los Angeles — The Pentagon has decided to put the first 40
of its controversial MX missiles in existing, unhardened
Minuteman silos in Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado, the
Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.
Citing unidentified Pentagon officials, the newspaper said
as many as 14 new silos would be built around the old ones to
hide or "deceptively base" the missiles. Each MX will be
housed in a transportable canister and moved at intervals
from silo to silo.
The Pentagon also may order an anti-ballistic missile de
fense to protect the missiles despite an agreement with the
Soviet Union under which the United States is allowed such
defenses only at its Grand Forks, N.D. base.
The Grand Forks base was ruled out for MX basing because
its geological features are not favorable to the missile, the
newspaper said.
The missile, proposed in the mid-19705, had been set for a
racetrack mode basing in Nevada and Utah under President
Jimmy Carter, a system severely criticized by Ronald Reagan
in his presidential campaign.
After taking office, Reagan announced he had decided
against puttingthe missiles in Nevada and Utah andwascon

sidering hardening existing Minuteman silos.
The newspaper says under the new plan, the silos will not
be hardened, because the $3 billion cost for the change to 40
silos would bring "very little added protection."
Brown sees Senate race turning point
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund "Jerry" Brown, with low pop
ularity ratings and trailing most of his Republican challengers
in political polls, says a turning point is coming and that he
will win the race for the U.S. Senate.
Brown said he will focus his campaign on jobs and the
economy.
In an interview published yesterday in the Los Angeles
Times, Brown said his formal campaign will begin March 10.
He said he believes there is a "turning coming on the is
sues."
President Ronald Reagan's theories are not working out,
Brown says, so his campaign will be on economic well-being
and jobs.
"It'll be on how to bring jobs to California," he said. "I'll
fight for that in the Senate. For California, not for lowa . ..
not for Wisconsin.
"It's high-tech where the jobs are," Brown said. "Right
now, 40 percent of the new jobs in California are coming in
high technology."
Brown testified before the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee in Washington that the president ought to start
protecting U.S. high technology firms from Japanese com
petition. He said he will continue to work on that theme in
his campaign.
Brown also said he expects state Controller Ken Cory will
decide against opposing him in the primary.
Republican hopefuls are Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr., Pete
McCloskey and Bob Dornan; San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reagan's daughter, Maureen, state Sen. John Schmitz, and
former Lear Corp. president Ted Bruinsma.
Brown's Democratic opponents include Fresno Mayor
Daniel Whitehurst, state Sen. Paul Carpenter, Klansman Tom
Metzger and one unannounced challenger, novelist Gore
Vidal.
Attack on Khadafy revealed
Washington — The CIA has evidence Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy was the target of an assassination attempt
two months ago and apparently escaped with a bullet nick in
the jaw, The Washington Post reported in yesterday's edi
tions.
The newspaper quoted an unnamed "senior government
official" as the source of its report.
News reports of the attack appeared in Rome and Tunis
but were not given much credence at the time. The Post re
port said the CIA now has sufficient evidence to confirm the
incident, but did not describe what the evidence was.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson was out of town and un
reachable, his family said.
The reported attack was carried out by "one or more of
ficers" of Khadafy's army, probably after they returned from
the Libyan invasion of Chad, and the attempt received no ex
ternal support from any foreign country, the newspaper said.
The attack took place during the last two weeks of Decem
ber while the military strongman was visiting a headquarters
area in the Libyan countryside, the report said.
The reports from Rome and Tunis said the attempt oc
curred Dec. 19 and that an eastern area army commander,
Col. Khalifa Khadir, was shot and killed by Khadafy's bod
yguards during the attempt, the newspaper said.
Pope endorses El Salvador elections
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II joined El Salvador's Ro
man Catholic bishops yesterday in condemning the "great
powers" for what he called meddling in the Central Ameri
can country's civil war.
It was the pontiff's first major statement on the country in
more than a year, and he endorsed a statement by El
Salvador's bishops supporting elections planned there
March 28. The pope also called for an end to all political vio
lence and alleged abuses against civilians by El Salvador's
army and security forces.
Vatican sources said the pope's statement was directed
against the United States for supplying arms to El Salvador's
civilian-military junta and against the Soviet Union for al

legedly supplying arms via its ally Cuba to a coalition of leftist
guerrillas.
"The arms come from abroad, but the dead are all our own
people," the pope said, quoting the apostolic administrator
of San Salvador, Bishop Arturo Rivera y Damas.
The Reagan administration has sent millions of dollars in
military aid to the junta, which came to power after an Octo
ber 1979 coup. The administration, under fire for its policies
from U.S. church groups, claims the Soviets and Cuba are
supplying the rebels with weapons and training.
The guerrillas say they are fighting a repressive regime and
receive no outside help. More than 32,000 people have died
in the fighting since the 1979 coup, church and human rights
groups estimate.
Japanese workers demand tax cut
Tokyo — In the first mass labor rally here in nearly a dec
ade, Japanese workers converged on a Tokyo park yesterday
and demanded a 1 trillion yen — about $4.3 billion — tax cut
for fiscal 1982.
Rally sponsors put the number of participants at 200,000,
but the Metropolitan Police Board said only 66,000 workers
demonstrated at Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo.
The rally was organized by four major labor federations,
including the 4.5 million-member General Council of Trade
Unions of Japan (Sohyo). Six leaders of opposition political
parties, led by Chairman Ichio Asukata of the Japan Socialist
Party, also demonstrated, rally organizers said.
Sohyo leader Motofumi Makieda accused the govern
ment of drastically increasing the defense budget for fiscal
1982 while allowing only slight increases in funding for
education and social welfare.
In 1980, the average income for a family of four in Japan
was the equivalent of $15,900, of which about $1,100 was paid
in taxes, a tax official said.
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki's government so far has re
jected the call for a tax cut, saying there are no financial re
sources to support it.
Auto workers approve Ford contract
Detroit — United Auto Workers members overwhelming
ly ratified a historic concessions contract with Ford Motor
Co. that guarantees them more job security while promising
Ford savings of up to $1 billion, the union announced late
yesterday.
The tally from the week-long voting in the 56 Ford locals
was 43,683-15,933 — a 3-1 margin — in favor of the contract
with the No. 2 U.S. automaker, UAW president Douglas
Fraser and vice president Donald Ephlin said. About 170,000
UAW-represented Ford workers were eligible to vote.
The company has 54,261 workers on indefinite layoff as car
sales continue at a snail's pace, though slightly better than
last year at this time. And how much, if anything, the new
contract might do to bring workers back to the assembly
lines isn't known, although the pact guarantees newly laid
off workers preferential selection for new jobs.
The contract, to run through Sept. 14,1984, asks Ford's au
toworkers to give up all eight paid personal holidays per
year, accept a wage freeze for the contract's duration and de
fer cost-of-living allowance payments for nine months.
Today's weather
Locally heavy rains this morning, turning to showers this
afternoon and tonight. Cloudy tomorrow with chance of
showers. Chance of rain 80 percent today, 60 percent to
night. Lows mid 40s to low 50s, highs upper 50s to low 60s.

fense to protect the missiles despite an agreement with the
Soviet Union under which the United States is allowed such
defenses only at its Grand Forks, N.D. base.
The Grand Forks base was ruled out for MX basing because
its geological features are not favorable to the missile, the
newspaper said.
The missile, proposed in the mid-19705, had been set for a
racetrack mode basing in Nevada and Utah under President
Jimmy Carter, a system severely criticized by Ronald Reagan
in his presidential campaign.
After taking office, Reagan announced he had decided
against puttingthe missiles in Nevada and Utah andwascon

sidering hardening existing Minuteman silos.
The newspaper says under the new plan, the silos will not
be hardened, because the $3 billion cost for the change to 40
silos would bring "very little added protection."
Brown sees Senate race turning point
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund "Jerry" Brown, with low pop
ularity ratings and trailing most of his Republican challengers
in political polls, says a turning point is coming and that he
will win the race for the U.S. Senate.
Brown said he will focus his campaign on jobs and the
economy.
In an interview published yesterday in the Los Angeles
Times, Brown said his formal campaign will begin March 10.
He said he believes there is a "turning coming on the is
sues."
President Ronald Reagan's theories are not working out,
Brown says, so his campaign will be on economic well-being
and jobs.
"It'll be on how to bring jobs to California," he said. "I'll
fight for that in the Senate. For California, not for lowa . ..
not for Wisconsin.
"It's high-tech where the jobs are," Brown said. "Right
now, 40 percent of the new jobs in California are coming in
high technology."
Brown testified before the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee in Washington that the president ought to start
protecting U.S. high technology firms from Japanese com
petition. He said he will continue to work on that theme in
his campaign.
Brown also said he expects state Controller Ken Cory will
decide against opposing him in the primary.
Republican hopefuls are Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr., Pete
McCloskey and Bob Dornan; San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reagan's daughter, Maureen, state Sen. John Schmitz, and
former Lear Corp. president Ted Bruinsma.
Brown's Democratic opponents include Fresno Mayor
Daniel Whitehurst, state Sen. Paul Carpenter, Klansman Tom
Metzger and one unannounced challenger, novelist Gore
Vidal.
Attack on Khadafy revealed
Washington — The CIA has evidence Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy was the target of an assassination attempt
two months ago and apparently escaped with a bullet nick in
the jaw, The Washington Post reported in yesterday's edi
tions.
The newspaper quoted an unnamed "senior government
official" as the source of its report.
News reports of the attack appeared in Rome and Tunis
but were not given much credence at the time. The Post re
port said the CIA now has sufficient evidence to confirm the
incident, but did not describe what the evidence was.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson was out of town and un
reachable, his family said.
The reported attack was carried out by "one or more of
ficers" of Khadafy's army, probably after they returned from
the Libyan invasion of Chad, and the attempt received no ex
ternal support from any foreign country, the newspaper said.
The attack took place during the last two weeks of Decem
ber while the military strongman was visiting a headquarters
area in the Libyan countryside, the report said.
The reports from Rome and Tunis said the attempt oc
curred Dec. 19 and that an eastern area army commander,
Col. Khalifa Khadir, was shot and killed by Khadafy's bod
yguards during the attempt, the newspaper said.
Pope endorses El Salvador elections
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II joined El Salvador's Ro
man Catholic bishops yesterday in condemning the "great
powers" for what he called meddling in the Central Ameri
can country's civil war.
It was the pontiff's first major statement on the country in
more than a year, and he endorsed a statement by El
Salvador's bishops supporting elections planned there
March 28. The pope also called for an end to all political vio
lence and alleged abuses against civilians by El Salvador's
army and security forces.
Vatican sources said the pope's statement was directed
against the United States for supplying arms to El Salvador's
civilian-military junta and against the Soviet Union for al

legedly supplying arms via its ally Cuba to a coalition of leftist
guerrillas.
"The arms come from abroad, but the dead are all our own
people," the pope said, quoting the apostolic administrator
of San Salvador, Bishop Arturo Rivera y Damas.
The Reagan administration has sent millions of dollars in
military aid to the junta, which came to power after an Octo
ber 1979 coup. The administration, under fire for its policies
from U.S. church groups, claims the Soviets and Cuba are
supplying the rebels with weapons and training.
The guerrillas say they are fighting a repressive regime and
receive no outside help. More than 32,000 people have died
in the fighting since the 1979 coup, church and human rights
groups estimate.
Japanese workers demand tax cut
Tokyo — In the first mass labor rally here in nearly a dec
ade, Japanese workers converged on a Tokyo park yesterday
and demanded a 1 trillion yen — about $4.3 billion — tax cut
for fiscal 1982.
Rally sponsors put the number of participants at 200,000,
but the Metropolitan Police Board said only 66,000 workers
demonstrated at Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo.
The rally was organized by four major labor federations,
including the 4.5 million-member General Council of Trade
Unions of Japan (Sohyo). Six leaders of opposition political
parties, led by Chairman Ichio Asukata of the Japan Socialist
Party, also demonstrated, rally organizers said.
Sohyo leader Motofumi Makieda accused the govern
ment of drastically increasing the defense budget for fiscal
1982 while allowing only slight increases in funding for
education and social welfare.
In 1980, the average income for a family of four in Japan
was the equivalent of $15,900, of which about $1,100 was paid
in taxes, a tax official said.
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki's government so far has re
jected the call for a tax cut, saying there are no financial re
sources to support it.
Auto workers approve Ford contract
Detroit — United Auto Workers members overwhelming
ly ratified a historic concessions contract with Ford Motor
Co. that guarantees them more job security while promising
Ford savings of up to $1 billion, the union announced late
yesterday.
The tally from the week-long voting in the 56 Ford locals
was 43,683-15,933 — a 3-1 margin — in favor of the contract
with the No. 2 U.S. automaker, UAW president Douglas
Fraser and vice president Donald Ephlin said. About 170,000
UAW-represented Ford workers were eligible to vote.
The company has 54,261 workers on indefinite layoff as car
sales continue at a snail's pace, though slightly better than
last year at this time. And how much, if anything, the new
contract might do to bring workers back to the assembly
lines isn't known, although the pact guarantees newly laid
off workers preferential selection for new jobs.
The contract, to run through Sept. 14,1984, asks Ford's au
toworkers to give up all eight paid personal holidays per
year, accept a wage freeze for the contract's duration and de
fer cost-of-living allowance payments for nine months.

Senate expulsion hearings begin Wednesday
Washington — The Senate is about to begin the job of deciding
whether to make Harrison Williams the first senator to be expelled since
1862.
After several delays, and 10 months after his conviction in the FBI s
Abscam investigation, the Senate opens debate Wednesday on a resolu
tion of expulsion against the New Jersey Democrat.
Williams, 61, has been sentenced to serve three years in prison and
fined $50,000 on charges that he agreed to accept a hidden interest in a
titanium mine in exchange for using his personal influence as a senator
to help the venture obtain military contracts.
Despite private urgings by senior Democrats that he resign, Williams,
a member of the Senate for 22 years, has insisted that he was trapped
into a phony conspiracy by FBI agents using illegal investigatory tech
niques.
He has steadfastly insisted he did nothing illegal, although conceding
some faulty judgment.
The Senate ethics committee recommended unanimously Aug. 25
that Williams be expelled because of his conduct.
He will be defended on the Senate floor by Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii)
who was persuaded to take the job after at least two others declined.
If faced with imminent expulsion, it is expected that Williams will
consider whether to beat the final vote by resigning.
In other business this week, the Senate is expected to vote approval
tomorrow of the toughest anti-busing legislation ever passed by either
house of Congress.
Leniency for non-registrants called for
Washington Congress will be asked this week to eliminate the pos
sibility of jailing hundreds of thousands of young men who failed to
meet yesterday's deadline to register for the draft.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a member of the House Armed Services
Committe, said he plans to introduce legislation this week that would
make non-registration a misdemeanor carrying a maximum fine of $200
and no jail term.
Currently, failure to register within 30 days of one's 18th
birthday is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison
and a $10,000 fine. A grace period for an estimated 900,000
non-registrants born between 1960and February 1964 to sign
up without fear of prosecution expired yesterday.
Aspin said his bill would avoid making "martyrs" out of
draft resisters and boost registration because judges would
be less inclined to let violators off "scot free." if a draft is or
dered, his bill would reimpose the stiffer penalties three
weeks later, he said.
Selective Service Director Thomas Turnage and Attorney
General William French Smith have promised to prosecute
non-registrants, likely beginning in April or May.
But Selective Service spokeswoman Joan Lamb said
latecomers who want to sign up at any U.S. post office won't
be turned away.
The idea, she said, is to get compliance with the law, not
prosecutions. While latecomers technically will be in vio
lation, it isn't likely they will be taken to court, she said.
Lamb said more than 900,000 eligible young men have not
registered, primarily because of confusion over whether the
program would be continued.
President Ronald Reagan originally opposed peacetime
registration, but he changed his mind after martial law was
imposed in Poland and announced on Jan. 7 that it will con
tinue.
Aid proposal called "waste of money"
Washington — Guillermo Ungo, a leader of the
Salvadoran opposition, said yesterday that the Reagan ad
ministration's proposal for increased economic aid to El
Salvador is "a waste of money."
Speaking on Meet the Press (NBC), Ungo said El Salvador
has lost $800 million in capital and $400 million in export in
come in the last two years, and"the American taxpayer is
wasting his money" in providing a new infusion of economic
aid.
"It doesn't go to achieve peace and stability," he added.
"So that money goes down the drain."
At a news conference called to respond to Ungo's charges,
El Salvador's ambassador here, Ernesto Rivas-Gallont, said his
nation has been "drained of its economic resources" by "a
number of factors," one of which is "the terrorism of Mr.
Ungo's followers." The proposed economic aid, the am
bassador said, is "welcome and useful."
In the television interview, Ungo, whose social democratic
party is one of more than a dozen political, labor and pro
fessional organizations making up the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front, reiterated the front'scall for negotiations with
the civilian-military government headed by Jose Napoleon
Duarte. The Democratic Revolutionary Front is allied with
the coalition of Marxist-oriented guerrilla groups fighting to
overthrow the Duarte government.
Ungo was Duarte's running mate in the 1972 presidential
elections, whose results were overturned by the military. He
charged in the television show that his former political ally is
now controlled by the military.
First MXs will be based in existing silos
Los Angeles — The Pentagon has decided to put the first 40
of its controversial MX missiles in existing, unhardened
Minuteman silos in Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado, the
Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.
Citing unidentified Pentagon officials, the newspaper said
as many as 14 new silos would be built around the old ones to
hide or "deceptively base" the missiles. Each MX will be
housed in a transportable canister and moved at intervals
from silo to silo.
The Pentagon also may order an anti-ballistic missile de
fense to protect the missiles despite an agreement with the
Soviet Union under which the United States is allowed such
defenses only at its Grand Forks, N.D. base.
The Grand Forks base was ruled out for MX basing because
its geological features are not favorable to the missile, the
newspaper said.

but the Metropolitan Police Board said only 66,000 workers
demonstrated at Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo.
The rally was organized by four major labor federations,
including the 4.5 million-member General Council of Trade
Unions of Japan (Sohyo). Six leaders of opposition political
parties, led by Chairman Ichio Asukata of the Japan Socialist
Party, also demonstrated, rally organizers said.
Sohyo leader Motofumi Makieda accused the govern
ment of drastically increasing the defense budget for fiscal
1982 while allowing only slight increases in funding for
education and social welfare.
In 1980, the average income for a family of four in Japan
was the equivalent of $15,900, of which about $1,100 was paid
in taxes, a tax official said.
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki's government so far has re
jected the call for a tax cut, saying there are no financial re
sources to support it.
Auto workers approve Ford contract
Detroit — United Auto Workers members overwhelming
ly ratified a historic concessions contract with Ford Motor
Co. that guarantees them more job security while promising
Ford savings of up to $1 billion, the union announced late
yesterday.
The tally from the week-long voting in the 56 Ford locals
was 43,683-15,933 — a 3-1 margin — in favor of the contract
with the No. 2 U.S. automaker, UAW president Douglas
Fraser and vice president Donald Ephlin said. About 170,000
UAW-represented Ford workers were eligible to vote.
The company has 54,261 workers on indefinite layoff as car
sales continue at a snail's pace, though slightly better than
last year at this time. And how much, if anything, the new
contract might do to bring workers back to the assembly
lines isn't known, although the pact guarantees newly laid
off workers preferential selection for new jobs.
The contract, to run through Sept. 14,1984, asks Ford's au
toworkers to give up all eight paid personal holidays per
year, accept a wage freeze for the contract's duration and de
fer cost-of-living allowance payments for nine months.

Senate expulsion hearings begin Wednesday
Washington — The Senate is about to begin the job of deciding
whether to make Harrison Williams the first senator to be expelled since
1862.
After several delays, and 10 months after his conviction in the FBI s
Abscam investigation, the Senate opens debate Wednesday on a resolu
tion of expulsion against the New Jersey Democrat.
Williams, 61, has been sentenced to serve three years in prison and
fined $50,000 on charges that he agreed to accept a hidden interest in a
titanium mine in exchange for using his personal influence as a senator
to help the venture obtain military contracts.
Despite private urgings by senior Democrats that he resign, Williams,
a member of the Senate for 22 years, has insisted that he was trapped
into a phony conspiracy by FBI agents using illegal investigatory tech
niques.
He has steadfastly insisted he did nothing illegal, although conceding
some faulty judgment.
The Senate ethics committee recommended unanimously Aug. 25
that Williams be expelled because of his conduct.
He will be defended on the Senate floor by Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii)
who was persuaded to take the job after at least two others declined.
If faced with imminent expulsion, it is expected that Williams will
consider whether to beat the final vote by resigning.
In other business this week, the Senate is expected to vote approval
tomorrow of the toughest anti-busing legislation ever passed by either
house of Congress.
Leniency for non-registrants called for
Washington Congress will be asked this week to eliminate the pos
sibility of jailing hundreds of thousands of young men who failed to
meet yesterday's deadline to register for the draft.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a member of the House Armed Services
Committe, said he plans to introduce legislation this week that would
make non-registration a misdemeanor carrying a maximum fine of $200
and no jail term.
Currently, failure to register within 30 days of one's 18th
birthday is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison
and a $10,000 fine. A grace period for an estimated 900,000
non-registrants born between 1960and February 1964 to sign
up without fear of prosecution expired yesterday.
Aspin said his bill would avoid making "martyrs" out of
draft resisters and boost registration because judges would
be less inclined to let violators off "scot free." if a draft is or
dered, his bill would reimpose the stiffer penalties three
weeks later, he said.
Selective Service Director Thomas Turnage and Attorney
General William French Smith have promised to prosecute
non-registrants, likely beginning in April or May.
But Selective Service spokeswoman Joan Lamb said
latecomers who want to sign up at any U.S. post office won't
be turned away.
The idea, she said, is to get compliance with the law, not
prosecutions. While latecomers technically will be in vio
lation, it isn't likely they will be taken to court, she said.
Lamb said more than 900,000 eligible young men have not
registered, primarily because of confusion over whether the
program would be continued.
President Ronald Reagan originally opposed peacetime
registration, but he changed his mind after martial law was
imposed in Poland and announced on Jan. 7 that it will con
tinue.
Aid proposal called "waste of money"
Washington — Guillermo Ungo, a leader of the
Salvadoran opposition, said yesterday that the Reagan ad
ministration's proposal for increased economic aid to El
Salvador is "a waste of money."
Speaking on Meet the Press (NBC), Ungo said El Salvador
has lost $800 million in capital and $400 million in export in
come in the last two years, and"the American taxpayer is
wasting his money" in providing a new infusion of economic
aid.
"It doesn't go to achieve peace and stability," he added.
"So that money goes down the drain."
At a news conference called to respond to Ungo's charges,
El Salvador's ambassador here, Ernesto Rivas-Gallont, said his
nation has been "drained of its economic resources" by "a
number of factors," one of which is "the terrorism of Mr.
Ungo's followers." The proposed economic aid, the am
bassador said, is "welcome and useful."
In the television interview, Ungo, whose social democratic
party is one of more than a dozen political, labor and pro
fessional organizations making up the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front, reiterated the front'scall for negotiations with
the civilian-military government headed by Jose Napoleon
Duarte. The Democratic Revolutionary Front is allied with
the coalition of Marxist-oriented guerrilla groups fighting to
overthrow the Duarte government.
Ungo was Duarte's running mate in the 1972 presidential
elections, whose results were overturned by the military. He
charged in the television show that his former political ally is
now controlled by the military.
First MXs will be based in existing silos
Los Angeles — The Pentagon has decided to put the first 40
of its controversial MX missiles in existing, unhardened
Minuteman silos in Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado, the
Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.
Citing unidentified Pentagon officials, the newspaper said
as many as 14 new silos would be built around the old ones to
hide or "deceptively base" the missiles. Each MX will be
housed in a transportable canister and moved at intervals
from silo to silo.
The Pentagon also may order an anti-ballistic missile de
fense to protect the missiles despite an agreement with the
Soviet Union under which the United States is allowed such
defenses only at its Grand Forks, N.D. base.
The Grand Forks base was ruled out for MX basing because
its geological features are not favorable to the missile, the
newspaper said.
The missile, proposed in the mid-19705, had been set for a
racetrack mode basing in Nevada and Utah under President
Jimmy Carter, a system severely criticized by Ronald Reagan
in his presidential campaign.
After taking office, Reagan announced he had decided
against puttingthe missiles in Nevada and Utah andwascon

sidering hardening existing Minuteman silos.
The newspaper says under the new plan, the silos will not
be hardened, because the $3 billion cost for the change to 40
silos would bring "very little added protection."
Brown sees Senate race turning point
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund "Jerry" Brown, with low pop
ularity ratings and trailing most of his Republican challengers
in political polls, says a turning point is coming and that he
will win the race for the U.S. Senate.
Brown said he will focus his campaign on jobs and the
economy.
In an interview published yesterday in the Los Angeles
Times, Brown said his formal campaign will begin March 10.
He said he believes there is a "turning coming on the is
sues."
President Ronald Reagan's theories are not working out,
Brown says, so his campaign will be on economic well-being
and jobs.
"It'll be on how to bring jobs to California," he said. "I'll
fight for that in the Senate. For California, not for lowa . ..
not for Wisconsin.
"It's high-tech where the jobs are," Brown said. "Right
now, 40 percent of the new jobs in California are coming in
high technology."
Brown testified before the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee in Washington that the president ought to start
protecting U.S. high technology firms from Japanese com
petition. He said he will continue to work on that theme in
his campaign.
Brown also said he expects state Controller Ken Cory will
decide against opposing him in the primary.
Republican hopefuls are Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr., Pete
McCloskey and Bob Dornan; San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reagan's daughter, Maureen, state Sen. John Schmitz, and
former Lear Corp. president Ted Bruinsma.
Brown's Democratic opponents include Fresno Mayor
Daniel Whitehurst, state Sen. Paul Carpenter, Klansman Tom
Metzger and one unannounced challenger, novelist Gore
Vidal.
Attack on Khadafy revealed
Washington — The CIA has evidence Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy was the target of an assassination attempt
two months ago and apparently escaped with a bullet nick in
the jaw, The Washington Post reported in yesterday's edi
tions.
The newspaper quoted an unnamed "senior government
official" as the source of its report.
News reports of the attack appeared in Rome and Tunis
but were not given much credence at the time. The Post re
port said the CIA now has sufficient evidence to confirm the
incident, but did not describe what the evidence was.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson was out of town and un
reachable, his family said.
The reported attack was carried out by "one or more of
ficers" of Khadafy's army, probably after they returned from
the Libyan invasion of Chad, and the attempt received no ex
ternal support from any foreign country, the newspaper said.
The attack took place during the last two weeks of Decem
ber while the military strongman was visiting a headquarters
area in the Libyan countryside, the report said.
The reports from Rome and Tunis said the attempt oc
curred Dec. 19 and that an eastern area army commander,
Col. Khalifa Khadir, was shot and killed by Khadafy's bod
yguards during the attempt, the newspaper said.
Pope endorses El Salvador elections
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II joined El Salvador's Ro
man Catholic bishops yesterday in condemning the "great
powers" for what he called meddling in the Central Ameri
can country's civil war.
It was the pontiff's first major statement on the country in
more than a year, and he endorsed a statement by El
Salvador's bishops supporting elections planned there
March 28. The pope also called for an end to all political vio
lence and alleged abuses against civilians by El Salvador's
army and security forces.
Vatican sources said the pope's statement was directed
against the United States for supplying arms to El Salvador's
civilian-military junta and against the Soviet Union for al

legedly supplying arms via its ally Cuba to a coalition of leftist
guerrillas.
"The arms come from abroad, but the dead are all our own
people," the pope said, quoting the apostolic administrator
of San Salvador, Bishop Arturo Rivera y Damas.
The Reagan administration has sent millions of dollars in
military aid to the junta, which came to power after an Octo
ber 1979 coup. The administration, under fire for its policies
from U.S. church groups, claims the Soviets and Cuba are
supplying the rebels with weapons and training.
The guerrillas say they are fighting a repressive regime and
receive no outside help. More than 32,000 people have died
in the fighting since the 1979 coup, church and human rights
groups estimate.
Japanese workers demand tax cut
Tokyo — In the first mass labor rally here in nearly a dec

and demanded a 1 trillion yen — about $4.3 billion — tax cut
for fiscal 1982.
Rally sponsors put the number of participants at 200,000,
but the Metropolitan Police Board said only 66,000 workers
demonstrated at Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo.

lation, it isn't likely they will be taken to court, she said.
Lamb said more than 900,000 eligible young men have not
registered, primarily because of confusion over whether the
program would be continued.
President Ronald Reagan originally opposed peacetime
registration, but he changed his mind after martial law was
imposed in Poland and announced on Jan. 7 that it will con
tinue.
Aid proposal called "waste of money"
Washington — Guillermo Ungo, a leader of the
Salvadoran opposition, said yesterday that the Reagan ad
ministration's proposal for increased economic aid to El
Salvador is "a waste of money."
Speaking on Meet the Press (NBC), Ungo said El Salvador
has lost $800 million in capital and $400 million in export in
come in the last two years, and"the American taxpayer is
wasting his money" in providing a new infusion of economic
aid.
"It doesn't go to achieve peace and stability," he added.
"So that money goes down the drain."
At a news conference called to respond to Ungo's charges,
El Salvador's ambassador here, Ernesto Rivas-Gallont, said his
nation has been "drained of its economic resources" by "a
number of factors," one of which is "the terrorism of Mr.
Ungo's followers." The proposed economic aid, the am
bassador said, is "welcome and useful."
In the television interview, Ungo, whose social democratic
party is one of more than a dozen political, labor and pro
fessional organizations making up the Democratic Revolu
tionary Front, reiterated the front'scall for negotiations with
the civilian-military government headed by Jose Napoleon
Duarte. The Democratic Revolutionary Front is allied with
the coalition of Marxist-oriented guerrilla groups fighting to
overthrow the Duarte government.
Ungo was Duarte's running mate in the 1972 presidential
elections, whose results were overturned by the military. He
charged in the television show that his former political ally is
now controlled by the military.
First MXs will be based in existing silos
Los Angeles — The Pentagon has decided to put the first 40
of its controversial MX missiles in existing, unhardened
Minuteman silos in Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado, the
Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.
Citing unidentified Pentagon officials, the newspaper said
as many as 14 new silos would be built around the old ones to
hide or "deceptively base" the missiles. Each MX will be
housed in a transportable canister and moved at intervals
from silo to silo.
The Pentagon also may order an anti-ballistic missile de
fense to protect the missiles despite an agreement with the
Soviet Union under which the United States is allowed such
defenses only at its Grand Forks, N.D. base.
The Grand Forks base was ruled out for MX basing because
its geological features are not favorable to the missile, the
newspaper said.
The missile, proposed in the mid-19705, had been set for a
racetrack mode basing in Nevada and Utah under President
Jimmy Carter, a system severely criticized by Ronald Reagan
in his presidential campaign.
After taking office, Reagan announced he had decided
against puttingthe missiles in Nevada and Utah andwascon

sidering hardening existing Minuteman silos.
The newspaper says under the new plan, the silos will not
be hardened, because the $3 billion cost for the change to 40
silos would bring "very little added protection."
Brown sees Senate race turning point
Los Angeles — Gov. Edmund "Jerry" Brown, with low pop
ularity ratings and trailing most of his Republican challengers
in political polls, says a turning point is coming and that he
will win the race for the U.S. Senate.
Brown said he will focus his campaign on jobs and the
economy.
In an interview published yesterday in the Los Angeles
Times, Brown said his formal campaign will begin March 10.
He said he believes there is a "turning coming on the is
sues."
President Ronald Reagan's theories are not working out,
Brown says, so his campaign will be on economic well-being
and jobs.
"It'll be on how to bring jobs to California," he said. "I'll
fight for that in the Senate. For California, not for lowa . ..
not for Wisconsin.
"It's high-tech where the jobs are," Brown said. "Right
now, 40 percent of the new jobs in California are coming in
high technology."
Brown testified before the Congressional Joint Economic
Committee in Washington that the president ought to start
protecting U.S. high technology firms from Japanese com
petition. He said he will continue to work on that theme in
his campaign.
Brown also said he expects state Controller Ken Cory will
decide against opposing him in the primary.
Republican hopefuls are Reps. Barry Goldwater Jr., Pete
McCloskey and Bob Dornan; San Diego Mayor Pete Wilson,
Reagan's daughter, Maureen, state Sen. John Schmitz, and
former Lear Corp. president Ted Bruinsma.
Brown's Democratic opponents include Fresno Mayor
Daniel Whitehurst, state Sen. Paul Carpenter, Klansman Tom
Metzger and one unannounced challenger, novelist Gore
Vidal.
Attack on Khadafy revealed
Washington — The CIA has evidence Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy was the target of an assassination attempt
two months ago and apparently escaped with a bullet nick in
the jaw, The Washington Post reported in yesterday's edi
tions.
The newspaper quoted an unnamed "senior government
official" as the source of its report.
News reports of the attack appeared in Rome and Tunis
but were not given much credence at the time. The Post re
port said the CIA now has sufficient evidence to confirm the
incident, but did not describe what the evidence was.
CIA spokesman Dale Peterson was out of town and un
reachable, his family said.
The reported attack was carried out by "one or more of
ficers" of Khadafy's army, probably after they returned from
the Libyan invasion of Chad, and the attempt received no ex
ternal support from any foreign country, the newspaper said.
The attack took place during the last two weeks of Decem
ber while the military strongman was visiting a headquarters
area in the Libyan countryside, the report said.
The reports from Rome and Tunis said the attempt oc
curred Dec. 19 and that an eastern area army commander,
Col. Khalifa Khadir, was shot and killed by Khadafy's bod
yguards during the attempt, the newspaper said.
Pope endorses El Salvador elections
Vatican City — Pope John Paul II joined El Salvador's Ro
man Catholic bishops yesterday in condemning the "great
powers" for what he called meddling in the Central Ameri
can country's civil war.
It was the pontiff's first major statement on the country in
more than a year, and he endorsed a statement by El
Salvador's bishops supporting elections planned there
March 28. The pope also called for an end to all political vio
lence and alleged abuses against civilians by El Salvador's
army and security forces.
Vatican sources said the pope's statement was directed
against the United States for supplying arms to El Salvador's
civilian-military junta and against the Soviet Union for al

legedly supplying arms via its ally Cuba to a coalition of leftist
guerrillas.
"The arms come from abroad, but the dead are all our own
people," the pope said, quoting the apostolic administrator
of San Salvador, Bishop Arturo Rivera y Damas.
The Reagan administration has sent millions of dollars in
military aid to the junta, which came to power after an Octo
ber 1979 coup. The administration, under fire for its policies
from U.S. church groups, claims the Soviets and Cuba are
supplying the rebels with weapons and training.
The guerrillas say they are fighting a repressive regime and
receive no outside help. More than 32,000 people have died
in the fighting since the 1979 coup, church and human rights
groups estimate.
Japanese workers demand tax cut
Tokyo — In the first mass labor rally here in nearly a dec
ade, Japanese workers converged on a Tokyo park yesterday
and demanded a 1 trillion yen — about $4.3 billion — tax cut
for fiscal 1982.
Rally sponsors put the number of participants at 200,000,
but the Metropolitan Police Board said only 66,000 workers
demonstrated at Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo.
The rally was organized by four major labor federations,
including the 4.5 million-member General Council of Trade
Unions of Japan (Sohyo). Six leaders of opposition political
parties, led by Chairman Ichio Asukata of the Japan Socialist
Party, also demonstrated, rally organizers said.
Sohyo leader Motofumi Makieda accused the govern
ment of drastically increasing the defense budget for fiscal
1982 while allowing only slight increases in funding for
education and social welfare.
In 1980, the average income for a family of four in Japan
was the equivalent of $15,900, of which about $1,100 was paid
in taxes, a tax official said.
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki's government so far has re
jected the call for a tax cut, saying there are no financial re
sources to support it.
Auto workers approve Ford contract
Detroit — United Auto Workers members overwhelming
ly ratified a historic concessions contract with Ford Motor
Co. that guarantees them more job security while promising
Ford savings of up to $1 billion, the union announced late
yesterday.
The tally from the week-long voting in the 56 Ford locals
was 43,683-15,933 — a 3-1 margin — in favor of the contract
with the No. 2 U.S. automaker, UAW president Douglas
Fraser and vice president Donald Ephlin said. About 170,000
UAW-represented Ford workers were eligible to vote.
The company has 54,261 workers on indefinite layoff as car
sales continue at a snail's pace, though slightly better than
last year at this time. And how much, if anything, the new
contract might do to bring workers back to the assembly
lines isn't known, although the pact guarantees newly laid
off workers preferential selection for new jobs.
The contract, to run through Sept. 14,1984, asks Ford's au
toworkers to give up all eight paid personal holidays per
year, accept a wage freeze for the contract's duration and de
fer cost-of-living allowance payments for nine months.

Senate expulsion hearings begin Wednesday
Washington — The Senate is about to begin the job of deciding
whether to make Harrison Williams the first senator to be expelled since
1862.
After several delays, and 10 months after his conviction in the FBI s
Abscam investigation, the Senate opens debate Wednesday on a resolu
tion of expulsion against the New Jersey Democrat.
Williams, 61, has been sentenced to serve three years in prison and
fined $50,000 on charges that he agreed to accept a hidden interest in a
titanium mine in exchange for using his personal influence as a senator
to help the venture obtain military contracts.
Despite private urgings by senior Democrats that he resign, Williams,
a member of the Senate for 22 years, has insisted that he was trapped
into a phony conspiracy by FBI agents using illegal investigatory tech
niques.
He has steadfastly insisted he did nothing illegal, although conceding
some faulty judgment.
The Senate ethics committee recommended unanimously Aug. 25
that Williams be expelled because of his conduct.
He will be defended on the Senate floor by Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii)
who was persuaded to take the job after at least two others declined.
If faced with imminent expulsion, it is expected that Williams will
consider whether to beat the final vote by resigning.
In other business this week, the Senate is expected to vote approval
tomorrow of the toughest anti-busing legislation ever passed by either
house of Congress.
Leniency for non-registrants called for
Washington Congress will be asked this week to eliminate the pos
sibility of jailing hundreds of thousands of young men who failed to
meet yesterday's deadline to register for the draft.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a member of the House Armed Services
Committe, said he plans to introduce legislation this week that would
make non-registration a misdemeanor carrying a maximum fine of $200
and no jail term.
Currently, failure to register within 30 days of one's 18th
birthday is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison
and a $10,000 fine. A grace period for an estimated 900,000
non-registrants born between 1960and February 1964 to sign
up without fear of prosecution expired yesterday.
Aspin said his bill would avoid making "martyrs" out of
draft resisters and boost registration because judges would
be less inclined to let violators off "scot free." if a draft is or
dered, his bill would reimpose the stiffer penalties three
weeks later, he said.
Selective Service Director Thomas Turnage and Attorney
General William French Smith have promised to prosecute
non-registrants, likely beginning in April or May.
But Selective Service spokeswoman Joan Lamb said
latecomers who want to sign up at any U.S. post office won't
be turned away.
The idea, she said, is to get compliance with the law, not
prosecutions. While latecomers technically will be in vio
lation, it isn't likely they will be taken to court, she said.
Lamb said more than 900,000 eligible young men have not
registered, primarily because of confusion over whether the
program would be continued.
President Ronald Reagan originally opposed peacetime
registration, but he changed his mind after martial law was
imposed in Poland and announced on Jan. 7 that it will con
tinue.
