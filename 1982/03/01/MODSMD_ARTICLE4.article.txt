Senate expulsion hearings begin Wednesday
Washington — The Senate is about to begin the job of deciding
whether to make Harrison Williams the first senator to be expelled since
1862.
After several delays, and 10 months after his conviction in the FBI s
Abscam investigation, the Senate opens debate Wednesday on a resolu
tion of expulsion against the New Jersey Democrat.
Williams, 61, has been sentenced to serve three years in prison and
fined $50,000 on charges that he agreed to accept a hidden interest in a
titanium mine in exchange for using his personal influence as a senator
to help the venture obtain military contracts.
Despite private urgings by senior Democrats that he resign, Williams,
a member of the Senate for 22 years, has insisted that he was trapped
into a phony conspiracy by FBI agents using illegal investigatory tech
niques.
He has steadfastly insisted he did nothing illegal, although conceding
some faulty judgment.
The Senate ethics committee recommended unanimously Aug. 25
that Williams be expelled because of his conduct.
He will be defended on the Senate floor by Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii)
who was persuaded to take the job after at least two others declined.
If faced with imminent expulsion, it is expected that Williams will
consider whether to beat the final vote by resigning.
In other business this week, the Senate is expected to vote approval
tomorrow of the toughest anti-busing legislation ever passed by either
house of Congress.
Leniency for non-registrants called for
Washington Congress will be asked this week to eliminate the pos
sibility of jailing hundreds of thousands of young men who failed to
meet yesterday's deadline to register for the draft.
Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), a member of the House Armed Services
Committe, said he plans to introduce legislation this week that would
make non-registration a misdemeanor carrying a maximum fine of $200
and no jail term.
