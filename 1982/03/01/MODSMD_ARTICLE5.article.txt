# Theta Chi national may cancel campus charter
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The 10 Theta Chi fraternity mem
bers here may find themselves
without a charter unless they can
reach an agreement with their na
tional organizaton about the short
age of members in the Stanford
chapter.
Theta Chi President William Atkins
told the Daily, "We are having prob
lems with the national fraternity
trying to pull our charter, but they
haven't done so yet."
Theta Chi currently has five active
members and five pledges, all living
in the Theta Chi house on Campus
Drive and Alvarado. Membership has
been about the same for the past 10
years, he said.
The national fraternity has been
putting informal pressure on the
chapter here to increase member
ship since 1972, Atkins said. But
earlier this year the grievences were
made formal.
Theta Chi is in the midst of nego
tiations with the national organiza
tion, and Atkins said he cannot pre
dict what the outcome will be. "I
honestly can't tell you" whether they
will pull the charter, he said.
"If the national were to pull our

charter," Atkins "we couldn't
call ourselves Theta Chi, but that
would in no way affect ownership of
the Theta Chi house."
The house, built in 1926, is owned
by a local Theta Chi alumni corpo
ration. Atkins said, "There are local
alums who really want it to stay an in
dependent house."
The shortage of fraternity mem
bers has had another affect on the
house — it is now co-ed. Atkins ex
plained that in the 1960s and '70s,
when the fraternity was declining in
membership, the house took in
boarders. But boarders were a vio
lation of the University housing sys
tem because they had not been
placed through the housing draw.
Theta Chi members, Atkins said,
decided to let people draw into the
house. The University rule was that if
the house were opened to the draw,
it must be opened to women as well
as men. The result was that since 1972
the house has been co-ed. "They did
that basically to save the frat," he
added.
The national organization does not
seem to mind the women living
there. "Frankly," Atkins said, "their
main concern is membership. Worn-

THETA CHI FRATERNITY is under pressure from its national to drum
up membership or possibly lose its charter. The fraternity currently
involves only 10 residents of the coed draw house. Membership has
been at this level for the last ten years, since the independently
owned house entered the University draw in 1972 to cut losses by
admitting boarders. Only those assigned to the house through the
draw are eligible to rush the fraternity.
en in the house haven't been men
tioned."
Because of its dual status, Theta Chi
cannot recruit members the way
most of the other fraternities here
do. Prospective members must draw
into the house before they can be
rushed into the fraternity. Atkins said
the fraternity decided it wants to con
tinue rushing only those already liv
ing in the house because members
not living there would not feel as
much a part of the fraternity.
While trying to negotiate to retain
its national charter, Theta Chi is also
negotiating repayment of its debts.
The house has incurred debts mainly
because the alumni corporation that
owns the house has not maintained a
capital improvement fund. The
house has therefore had to borrow
money to make repairs, including a
University loan for a new roof put on
in the fall.
Row Director Diana Conklin de
nied a rumor that the University has
offered to buy the house and assume
the debts. She said that the University
made clear that the roof loan last fall
would be the last one and has sent a
letter to the house exploring all pos
sibilities. "It (the letter) said that if it
came to selling the house, the Uni
versity buying it and assuming the
loans was one possibility," Conklin
said.
Atkins said, "The Row Office is
very happy about the way the house
is run." Conklin agreed, saying she is
not at all displeased with the way the
house is being managed.

into the house before they can be
rushed into the fraternity. Atkins said
the fraternity decided it wants to con
tinue rushing only those already liv
ing in the house because members
not living there would not feel as
much a part of the fraternity.
While trying to negotiate to retain
its national charter, Theta Chi is also
negotiating repayment of its debts.
The house has incurred debts mainly
because the alumni corporation that
owns the house has not maintained a
capital improvement fund. The
house has therefore had to borrow
money to make repairs, including a
University loan for a new roof put on
in the fall.
Row Director Diana Conklin de
nied a rumor that the University has
offered to buy the house and assume
the debts. She said that the University
made clear that the roof loan last fall
would be the last one and has sent a
letter to the house exploring all pos
sibilities. "It (the letter) said that if it
came to selling the house, the Uni
versity buying it and assuming the
loans was one possibility," Conklin
said.
Atkins said, "The Row Office is
very happy about the way the house
is run." Conklin agreed, saying she is
not at all displeased with the way the
house is being managed.
The 10 Theta Chi fraternity mem
bers here may find themselves
without a charter unless they can
reach an agreement with their na
tional organizaton about the short
age of members in the Stanford
chapter.
Theta Chi President William Atkins
told the Daily, "We are having prob
lems with the national fraternity
trying to pull our charter, but they
haven't done so yet."
Theta Chi currently has five active
members and five pledges, all living
in the Theta Chi house on Campus
Drive and Alvarado. Membership has
been about the same for the past 10
years, he said.
The national fraternity has been
putting informal pressure on the
chapter here to increase member
ship since 1972, Atkins said. But
earlier this year the grievences were
made formal.
Theta Chi is in the midst of nego
tiations with the national organiza
tion, and Atkins said he cannot pre
dict what the outcome will be. "I
honestly can't tell you" whether they
will pull the charter, he said.
"If the national were to pull our

charter," Atkins "we couldn't
call ourselves Theta Chi, but that
would in no way affect ownership of
the Theta Chi house."
The house, built in 1926, is owned
by a local Theta Chi alumni corpo
ration. Atkins said, "There are local
alums who really want it to stay an in
dependent house."
The shortage of fraternity mem
bers has had another affect on the
house — it is now co-ed. Atkins ex
plained that in the 1960s and '70s,
when the fraternity was declining in
membership, the house took in
boarders. But boarders were a vio
lation of the University housing sys
tem because they had not been
placed through the housing draw.
Theta Chi members, Atkins said,
decided to let people draw into the
house. The University rule was that if
the house were opened to the draw,
it must be opened to women as well
as men. The result was that since 1972
the house has been co-ed. "They did
that basically to save the frat," he
added.
The national organization does not
seem to mind the women living
there. "Frankly," Atkins said, "their
main concern is membership. Worn-

THETA CHI FRATERNITY is under pressure from its national to drum
up membership or possibly lose its charter. The fraternity currently
involves only 10 residents of the coed draw house. Membership has
been at this level for the last ten years, since the independently
owned house entered the University draw in 1972 to cut losses by
admitting boarders. Only those assigned to the house through the
draw are eligible to rush the fraternity.
en in the house haven't been men
tioned."
Because of its dual status, Theta Chi
cannot recruit members the way
most of the other fraternities here
do. Prospective members must draw
into the house before they can be
rushed into the fraternity. Atkins said
the fraternity decided it wants to con
tinue rushing only those already liv
ing in the house because members
not living there would not feel as
much a part of the fraternity.
