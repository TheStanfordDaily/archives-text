# Theta Chi national may cancel campus charter

### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The 10 Theta Chi fraternity mem
bers here may find themselves
without a charter unless they can
reach an agreement with their na
tional organizaton about the short
age of members in the Stanford
chapter.
Theta Chi President William Atkins
told the Daily, "We are having prob
lems with the national fraternity
trying to pull our charter, but they
haven't done so yet."
Theta Chi currently has five active
members and five pledges, all living
in the Theta Chi house on Campus
Drive and Alvarado. Membership has
been about the same for the past 10
years, he said.
The national fraternity has been
putting informal pressure on the
chapter here to increase member
ship since 1972, Atkins said. But
earlier this year the grievences were
made formal.
Theta Chi is in the midst of nego
tiations with the national organiza
tion, and Atkins said he cannot pre
dict what the outcome will be. "I
honestly can't tell you" whether they
will pull the charter, he said.
"If the national were to pull our

charter," Atkins "we couldn't
call ourselves Theta Chi, but that
would in no way affect ownership of
the Theta Chi house."
The house, built in 1926, is owned
by a local Theta Chi alumni corpo
ration. Atkins said, "There are local
alums who really want it to stay an in
dependent house."
The shortage of fraternity mem
bers has had another affect on the
house â€” it is now co-ed. Atkins ex
plained that in the 1960s and '70s,
when the fraternity was declining in
membership, the house took in
boarders. But boarders were a vio
lation of the University housing sys
tem because they had not been
placed through the housing draw.
Theta Chi members, Atkins said,
decided to let people draw into the
house. The University rule was that if
the house were opened to the draw,
it must be opened to women as well
as men. The result was that since 1972
the house has been co-ed. "They did
that basically to save the frat," he
added.
The national organization does not
seem to mind the women living
there. "Frankly," Atkins said, "their
main concern is membership. Worn-

THETA CHI FRATERNITY is under pressure from its national to drum
up membership or possibly lose its charter. The fraternity currently
involves only 10 residents of the coed draw house. Membership has
been at this level for the last ten years, since the independently
owned house entered the University draw in 1972 to cut losses by
admitting boarders. Only those assigned to the house through the
draw are eligible to rush the fraternity.
