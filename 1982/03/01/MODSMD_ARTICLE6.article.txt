# Frontrunner Goldwater misses debate
## 
### Peggy Hernandez 
San Francisco â€” It was the battle of
the "Petes" last Friday when Rep.
Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) and San Diego Mayor Pete
Wilson met for the first one-on-one
debate in the campaign for the U.S.
Senate seat now held by Republican
Sen. S. I. Hayakawa.
The two men began the debate by
lambasting Rep. Barry Goldwater (R-
Los Angeles) for not appearing at the
San Francisco event. Although he
was invited, Goldwater has said he
will not attend any debates until after
the March 12 filing deadline, when
he said he'll know who"the real can
didates are."
A recent Field poll indicates Mc-
Closkey and Wilson are presently
tied for a distant second place among
the nine candidates seeking the Re
publican nomination. Goldwater is in
first place.
Wilson criticized Goldwater for his
failure to appear, saying "His famous
father, on whose name he's running,
would not have ducked this debate.
Vou cannot win a statewide race in
California by staying in the closet,
and you don't deserve it."
McCloskey said he suspected the
reason Goldwater didn't show up
was because Goldwater "knows that,
in a debate, he can't stand up."
The two men then took turns call
ing each other "my good friend"

before criticizing each other's politi
cal stances.
"Pete McCloskey is my friend, a
man of conscience, courage and
conviction, but his record is replete
with good intentions gone bad,"
Wilson said. He chastised McCloskey
for the congressman's support of $9
billion less in budget cuts than Presi
dent Ronald Reagan's $50 billion

proposal, unconditional sale of the
Airborne Warning and Control Sys
tems (AWACS) to Saudi Arabia and
the creation of a Palestinian home
land.
McCloskey, on the other hand,
said Wilson would make a better gov
ernor than he, but that his 14 years in
Congress better prepared Mc-

Closkey for the U.S. Senate and that
"it would take Pete Wilson five years
to become a competent member of
Confess." Wilson has run for gov
ernor twice and lost.
McCloskey attacked the mayor's
last-minute support of the AWACS
sale and criticisms of porpoise-kill
quotas at tuna industry events.
The debate also touched on El
Salvador. McCloskey said he believes
U.S. military advisers should not be
sent to the country and worries that
"there is a mind-set in (Secretary of
State Alexander) Haig's adminis
tration that we will stand up to com
munism and revolutionaries when
we believe they are a tool of a repres
sive government."
Wilson called McCloskey "naive,"
saying there "is, in effect, a Soviet
Bloc presence in Nicaragua and El
Salvador" with which the United
States should deal.
An awkward moment in the hour
long debate came when Wilson was
asked the dollar figure of Reagan's
proposed budget cuts. Wilson
paused, then made a few remarks,
but failed to offer any figures despite
the fact the figure was mentioned
early in the debate.
"You honestly don't know what
the size of the tax cuts would be, do
you?" McCloskey said to Wilson.
McCloskey then gave the $50 billion
dollar figure.
