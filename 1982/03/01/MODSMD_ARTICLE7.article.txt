## Polish church urges end to martial law 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's Roman
Catholic Church continued Saturday to
press the government to reopen a
dialogue with Solidarity and for the first
time, called for amnesty to be granted
both to persons arrested for striking and
other martial law crimes and to others on
the wanted list for similar offenses.
At the same time, the country's Council
of Bishops said in a communique that Poles
should be "guided by a sense of realism"
in their expectations and warned them
against an attitude of "everything or noth
ing."
The communique was issued two days
after the Communist Party Central Com
mittee had adopted an uncompromising
stance on political opposition and just
before the expected visit to Moscow of
Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Poland's party
and martial law chief.
The Polish church has been trying ever
since mid-December to pressure the au
thorities for a return of civil liberties
stripped away by the martial law decree.
Sources close to the church, however, say
those efforts have been largely ineffective
to date.
And there has been evidence here re
cently of growing tensions between the

church, which claims the allegiance of
some 90 percent of the Polish nation, and
the authorities. The government has tried
to downplay differences between the two,
but the episcopate communique indicated
otherwise. It accused the authorities of an
attempt "to return to the programmed
atheization of children and youth."
Also, a church official flatly denied a
statement by government spokesman
Jerzy Shubert during an interview several
days ago, in which Shubert had alleged
that the authorities offered the church
more access to Polish radio and television
but that the offer had been rejected.
"In fact, the church is interested in
broader access to the media," the church
official said. "Talks were being held on the
subject before martial law, but the whole
issue was shelved afterwards."
The church has been trying to act as an
intermediary to reopen talks between the
independent trade union Solidarity and
the government, but those efforts have so
far proved fruitless. The major problem
appears to be that the government has not
yet decided on how to handle the problem
of some 4,000 Solidarity leaders and sym
pathizers still being detained. The in
ternees are not charged with any crime,
but officials have said repeatedly that they

fear that if released, these individuals
would only become the focal point for re
sistance.
The episcopate communique, issued af
ter the first meeting of Poland's bishops
since shortly after martial law was declared
Dec. 13, again stressed that any "social ac
cord" must include "credible represent
atives of organized social groups," and it
stressed that "Solidarity, which enjoys
broad social approval, cannot be absent
here."
It is up to the government to create a
climate "condusive to this agreement" by
permitting "free and responsible dis
cussion" of the country's problems and by
"guaranteeing fundamental civic liber
ties." In this context, the communique
said, it is important that martial law be
lifted as soon as possible, that internees are
released, persons sentenced for martial
law crimes be given amnesty, fugitives
sought for similar offenses promised they
will not be prosecuted, and workers guar
anteed they will not be dismissed for union
membership. •
About 1000 people already have been
charged with participating in strikes or
other martial law violations since martial
law was imposed.
