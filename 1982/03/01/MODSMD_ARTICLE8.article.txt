# Report from El Salvador
## Searching for the war 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador, El Salvador — Where is the war, I
wondered, driving in from the airport past jeep
patrols and kids carrying wood on their heads
and finding, on a soft Saturday evening, a certain
loneliness in the streets but an unmistakable
tranquillity as well. Where is the war that, ac
cording to our TV, daily is crackling hotter in El
Salvador, reducing the country to death and
desperation, numbing the survivors?
And on Sunday: at the altar where
Archibishop Oscar Romero was gunned down,
Bishop Arturo Rivera y Damas reads a scholarly
sermon followed by a prudent homily, and
strolls to the rear of his bullet-pocked cathedral
for a friendly chat with the foreign press, which
is there just in case.
In the afternoon: a walk through the high
rent district of stores and newly walled homes
around the Camino Real Hotel, an eclair at a
well-kept shopping center where police with
guns at the ready drift through, a raucous go
kart competition in a parking lot.
Evening: dinner in his elegant, guarded home
with a government minister, a reformer who says
with a shrug that he does not know "whether I
will get it from the left or the right." His 17-year
old daughter, to fulfill a new high school re
quirement, is doing 300 hours of volunteer social
work — at a military hospital.
Business as usual
My first impression is of a country, or at least a
city, making do with an almost startling nor
mality. Missing are the tension and decay and
the sense of fugitive time evident in, say, a Beirut
or Kinshasa. En route I had heard, in Miami,
complaints of San Salvador's street lights not
being replaced; in San Salvador they are shining.
A woman reports she had fled with her children
in the worst of the urban terror of 1980 to Bos
ton, but she has now returned: "It's safer here."
Repeatedly, people shake their heads in awe at
the doggedness of commuters in improvising

ways to get to work on time even though the
guerrillas have burned 1,200 buses in two years.
The guards, the guns, the soldiers, the walls,
the peepholes — and, on the farms, the wire and
the patrols — all that I expect of a country at war.
What I do not expect arethe traffic jams, theear
ly-morning joggers, the fresh billboards, the un
eventful 50-kilometer drives in the countryside,
the traditional soccer craze, the tennis exhibi
tion.
The chief of the rural police observes proudly
that "the subversives," as the guerrillas are
called, threatened among other things to pre
vent the fields from being sown and harvested.
But though sugar cane has been burned, two
crops a year come in.
The undeniable violence
There is terrible war in this country, or a ter
rible condition of violence in which perhaps
more than 30,000 civilian lives have been lost in
two years. The word at the Camino Real bar is
that for $20 any cab driver will take you to view a
body, bound, at roadside. The press corps
murmurs that headsare being cut off again. Nev
er move hastily in the presence of anyone with a
gun, a newcomer is warned. A quarter of a mil
lion refugees, mostly peasants, are spread
through the country.
The economy is bleeding: international re
serves gone, most foreign investors scared off,
no new national investment, a brain and skill
drain, unemployment soaring. Some of this is
laid to the world tides — prices of coffee, sugar
and cotton are down. Another part, business
leaders insist, is due to failings of national eco
nomic policy. The cruelest share, still, is that of
the guerrillas.
But "the story" is not just the war. The story is
the pervasive determination . not to be in
timidated by the war, and the resourcefulness of
all kinds of people in coping. This may be one of
those preposterous journalistic impressions, but
•it is mine.
