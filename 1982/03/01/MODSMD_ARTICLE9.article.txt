# The
						Ganges: India's holy mess
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Varanasi, India — Hindu re
ligious leaders were pleased
when recent scientific studies
found that the sacred Ganges
River possessed special quali
ties that helped purify its wa
ters — an abnormally high
quantity of bacteria-killing
agents.
The studies added scientific
backing to their belief in the
river's spiritual cleansing
powers.
But the scientists noticed
something else — that three
decades of industrial ex
pansion and an unabated pop

ulation explosion have taxed
this self-purification quality to
its limit.
Here in the holy city of
Varanasi, for example, the
city's main sewage outlet,
which is just downstream from
the main religious bathing
areas, turns the river into a
foul-smelling mixture of
browns and greens.
"The discharge contains ev
erything, including animal
bodies," R. S. Ambasht, a
botany professor at the
Benares Hindu University here,
told an interviewer.
Like great rivers in Europe
and the United States, the
Ganges has become so pol
luted in some places that the
water there has been declared
unsuitable for human use.
Waste is dumped from in
dustries — sugar refineries, pa
per mills, tanneries, metal
working factories — that dot
the river's banks along its 1500-
mile course from the Hima
layas to the Bay of Bengal.

Soon, an oil refinery and a nu
clear power plant will add
more waste.
Dams and canals diverting
Ganges water for irrigation
have substantially reduced the
river's flow in many areas, in
creasing the impact of pollu
tion.
But the primary threat comes
from the teeming population
of the vast Ganges plain. Gov
ernment officials estimate that
100 million people regard the
Ganges as their primary source
of water.
Poor water quality, however,
has not dampened the spiritual
lure of the river that Hindus be
lieve is imbued with magical
powers.
Duringa religious festival last
month at Allahabad, the gov
ernment estimated that as
many as 10 million people
crowded into the river one day
on a four-mile stretch of
shoreline.
