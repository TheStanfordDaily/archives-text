RACE AWARENESS WEEK
UNLEARNING RACISM WORKSHOP
Facilitated by Ricky Sherover-Marcuse
Tuesday, March 2
7-9 p.m.
Meyer Forum Room
Open to the Stanford Community
The fundamental assumption of this workshop is that no one is born with racist
attitutdes and beliefs, that such misinformation is acquired involuntarily at an
early age through social conditioning. The workshop assumes that people
cling to misinformation because they have not been offered supportive ways to
unlearn it.
