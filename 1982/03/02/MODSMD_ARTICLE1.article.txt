Education demands the rekeying of
thraTrooms corresponding
rt: look at the
policy for key control here has shown
that secCftiHy not be as tight as
some administrators claim.

Following a week-long investiga
tion, the Daily has learned that:
• Master keys-— y/hich provide the
entrance exit ticket to
dormitories, otffwf-es and rooms — are
often unaccountable, untraceable
and in the hands of unauthorized
persons.
• When a room or master key dis
appears it is often impossible to de
termine the degree of risk to resi
dents because records of if and when
a building has had all its locks
changed ("rekeyed") until recently
were kept in fragments.
• When room keys are misplaced,
duplicates are often ordered before
it has been established that the keys
are indeed lost. Hence dormitory key
boards become crowded with excess
room keys, creating a nuisance to res
idence office staff and a security risk

to residents.
• Students who lose their keys can
expect a charge of about $34 to rekey
their locks, while summer conferees
are not charged and often the locks
are not rekeyed at all.
• While lock-shop employees
stamp on keys the imposing, or
dinance-supported order "DO NOT
DUPLICATE," students have not only
been able to duplicate their room
keys, but one Stanford amateur
locksmith even took apart his door
lock and cut a master key from it.
In much the manner of a
monarchy, the University lock shop
confers degrees of "nobility" on
keys: the "grand master," allowing
passage through all but specially
locked doors in a building, reigns
king. The roommaster follows in
clearance rank, opening all student
room doors in a specified area. Some
roommasters fit all the room locks in
a house, while others fit only the
locks on a single hall. The peasant
room key, only unlocking a single
door, has the lowest rank.
The University's Resident Man
ager's Office (RMO), which is re
sponsible for the operation and
maintenance of the nine major resi
dence halls, only issues grand mas
ters to custodial supervisors who dis
tribute them to their subordinates.
Ray Henard, custodial supervisor
for Crothers Memorial Hall (Cro
Mem) takes the responsibility seri
ously. Henard said that in the past,
custodial workers who lost a master
key were fired. The Resident Man
ager's files do not record a grand

master key ever being lost.
Where roommasters are con
cerned, however, some
suggest doors are not nearly so se
cure.
For quite some time, according to a
resident assistant (RA) in Manzanita
Park, a rumor has circulated that sev
eral Manzanita Park "trailermasters"
had been lost over the years and that
the University could not account for
them. The number of unaccounted
for keys has been conjectured to be
as high as 23 or 24, according to Jan
Van Houten, resident fellow for the
trailers. However, Van Houten said
this was only a rumour, and neither
the loss nor the figure could be con
firmed.
Inaccessible and incomplete rec
ords shroud in doubt the figures for

the number of master keys ordered,
the number of room keys duplicated,
and the number of "rekeys" or
dered. A person would have to sift
through the 50,000 work orders
which circulate around the Univer
sity each year to come up with master
key statistics, according to Jason
Mavis, director of facilities and ser
vices.
No accessible, centralized filing
system existed to process the work
orders until about six months ago,
and the newly established computer
records only go back half a year. Nik
Kirichenko, master locksmith for
Operations and Maintenance, keeps
the lock-shop work orders from past
years on file. Kirichenko refused to
release these records to the Daily,
saying it would jeopardize residence
security.
When asked how many
trailermasters have been made since
Manzanita Park was built, Mavis re

sponded, "That's like asking how
many angels are on the head of a pin.
I don't know and nobody does."
Not only do dorm staff find it dif
ficult to account for keys they know
have been ordered, but master keys
which the field staff did not even
know existed have turned up, ac
cording to RAs and staff in Cro Mem.
Last June, a custodian found four
identical University master keys
stamped "Do not duplicate" in a
Crothers trash can. All four keys fit
doors in Crothers, but no keys had
been reported missing, according to
Victoria Baker, who was then a secre
tary in Crothers.
Ed Scoles, director of housing and
food services, said he had neither
heard of the Crothers incident nor
the lost Manzanita mastersand didn't
think either proposed a great secur
ity risk.
"Having master keys floating
around is a problem enough in

itself," said Neil Midkiff, a summer
RA in Cro Mem. "We don't know
how many keys were made, or where
they are." The University has decided
to rekey Cro Mem to minimize the
security risk posed by these missing
keys, according to Ed Scoles, director
of housing and food services.
When she took over the Cro Mem
office, Baker said there may have
been two missing masters. During
her tour of duty in the Cro Mem of
fice, two masters disappeared. One
was anonymously returned in an un
marked envelope. Then two masters
not known to be missing were re
turned by students leaving Cro Mem.
"At the time, I was very worried. I
thought it (the losses) would reflect
badly on me," Baker said. "But with
so many strange twists of events, I
concluded it I was not at fault. How
ever, I'm still concerned about stu

dent security."
"I don't think there's a big prob
lem with losing master keys.. said
Elizabeth Hiyama, administration di
rector for residential education. "In
cases when people don't return keys,
we do rekeys."
Marvin Herrington, Stanford po
lice chief, said that he could trace no
thefts to the lose of master keys in re
cent years, but that it would be
almost impossible to trace the crime
to such a cause unless the officer saw
the thief entering a room using a
master key.
Terry McGovern, housing facilities
manager, said the University is trying
to crack down on master key control.
All master key orders and issuances
are now channeled through the Resi
dent Manager's office, and key v» >rk
order records are funneled intc a
computer.

keys, according to Ed Scoles, director
of housing and food services.
When she took over the Cro Mem
office, Baker said there may have
been two missing masters. During
her tour of duty in the Cro Mem of
fice, two masters disappeared. One
was anonymously returned in an un
marked envelope. Then two masters
not known to be missing were re
turned by students leaving Cro Mem.
"At the time, I was very worried. I
thought it (the losses) would reflect

"I don't think there's a big prob

some administrators claim.

Following a week-long investiga
tion, the Daily has learned that:
• Master keys-— y/hich provide the
entrance exit ticket to
dormitories, otffwf-es and rooms — are
often unaccountable, untraceable
and in the hands of unauthorized
persons.
• When a room or master key dis
appears it is often impossible to de
termine the degree of risk to resi
dents because records of if and when
a building has had all its locks
changed ("rekeyed") until recently
were kept in fragments.
• When room keys are misplaced,
duplicates are often ordered before
it has been established that the keys
are indeed lost. Hence dormitory key
boards become crowded with excess
room keys, creating a nuisance to res
idence office staff and a security risk

to residents.
• Students who lose their keys can
expect a charge of about $34 to rekey
their locks, while summer conferees
are not charged and often the locks
are not rekeyed at all.
• While lock-shop employees
stamp on keys the imposing, or
dinance-supported order "DO NOT
DUPLICATE," students have not only
been able to duplicate their room
keys, but one Stanford amateur
locksmith even took apart his door
lock and cut a master key from it.
In much the manner of a
monarchy, the University lock shop
confers degrees of "nobility" on
keys: the "grand master," allowing
passage through all but specially
locked doors in a building, reigns
king. The roommaster follows in
clearance rank, opening all student
room doors in a specified area. Some
roommasters fit all the room locks in
a house, while others fit only the
locks on a single hall. The peasant
room key, only unlocking a single
door, has the lowest rank.
The University's Resident Man
ager's Office (RMO), which is re
sponsible for the operation and
maintenance of the nine major resi
dence halls, only issues grand mas
ters to custodial supervisors who dis
tribute them to their subordinates.
Ray Henard, custodial supervisor
for Crothers Memorial Hall (Cro
Mem) takes the responsibility seri
ously. Henard said that in the past,
custodial workers who lost a master
key were fired. The Resident Man
ager's files do not record a grand

master key ever being lost.
Where roommasters are con
cerned, however, some

For quite some time, according to a
resident assistant (RA) in Manzanita
Park, a rumor has circulated that sev
eral Manzanita Park "trailermasters"
had been lost over the years and that
the University could not account for
them. The number of unaccounted
for keys has been conjectured to be
as high as 23 or 24, according to Jan
Van Houten, resident fellow for the
trailers. However, Van Houten said
this was only a rumour, and neither
the loss nor the figure could be con
firmed.
Inaccessible and incomplete rec
ords shroud in doubt the figures for

the number of master keys ordered,
the number of room keys duplicated,
and the number of "rekeys" or
dered. A person would have to sift
through the 50,000 work orders
which circulate around the Univer
sity each year to come up with master
key statistics, according to Jason
Mavis, director of facilities and ser
vices.
No accessible, centralized filing
system existed to process the work
orders until about six months ago,
and the newly established computer
records only go back half a year. Nik
Kirichenko, master locksmith for
Operations and Maintenance, keeps
the lock-shop work orders from past
years on file. Kirichenko refused to
release these records to the Daily,
saying it would jeopardize residence
security.
When asked how many
trailermasters have been made since
Manzanita Park was built, Mavis re

sponded, "That's like asking how
many angels are on the head of a pin.
I don't know and nobody does."
Not only do dorm staff find it dif
ficult to account for keys they know
have been ordered, but master keys
which the field staff did not even
know existed have turned up, ac
cording to RAs and staff in Cro Mem.
Last June, a custodian found four
identical University master keys
stamped "Do not duplicate" in a
Crothers trash can. All four keys fit
doors in Crothers, but no keys had
been reported missing, according to
Victoria Baker, who was then a secre
