rt: look at the
policy for key control here has shown
that secCftiHy not be as tight as
some administrators claim.

Following a week-long investiga
tion, the Daily has learned that:
• Master keys-— y/hich provide the
entrance exit ticket to
dormitories, otffwf-es and rooms — are
often unaccountable, untraceable
and in the hands of unauthorized
persons.
• When a room or master key dis
appears it is often impossible to de
termine the degree of risk to resi
dents because records of if and when
a building has had all its locks
changed ("rekeyed") until recently
were kept in fragments.
• When room keys are misplaced,
duplicates are often ordered before
it has been established that the keys
are indeed lost. Hence dormitory key
boards become crowded with excess
room keys, creating a nuisance to res
idence office staff and a security risk

to residents.
• Students who lose their keys can
expect a charge of about $34 to rekey
their locks, while summer conferees
are not charged and often the locks
are not rekeyed at all.
• While lock-shop employees
stamp on keys the imposing, or
dinance-supported order "DO NOT
DUPLICATE," students have not only
been able to duplicate their room
keys, but one Stanford amateur
locksmith even took apart his door
lock and cut a master key from it.
In much the manner of a
monarchy, the University lock shop
confers degrees of "nobility" on
keys: the "grand master," allowing
passage through all but specially
locked doors in a building, reigns
king. The roommaster follows in
clearance rank, opening all student
room doors in a specified area. Some
roommasters fit all the room locks in
a house, while others fit only the
locks on a single hall. The peasant
room key, only unlocking a single
door, has the lowest rank.
The University's Resident Man
ager's Office (RMO), which is re
sponsible for the operation and
maintenance of the nine major resi
dence halls, only issues grand mas
ters to custodial supervisors who dis
tribute them to their subordinates.
Ray Henard, custodial supervisor
for Crothers Memorial Hall (Cro
Mem) takes the responsibility seri
ously. Henard said that in the past,
custodial workers who lost a master
key were fired. The Resident Man
ager's files do not record a grand
