# Stimulation of brain may better lives of cerebral palsy patients
## 
### 
Researchers here have
begun an 18-month project to
access electrical stimulation of
the brain as a technique for im
proving the lives of cerebral
palsy patients. The technique,
called "cerebellar stimu
lation", involves implanting in
the patient's abdomen a
pacemaker which continually
sends electrical signals to the
cerebellum, the part of the
brain responsible for body-bal
ance and muscular coordi
nation.
Although cerebellar stimu
lation was developed in the
early 1970s by Dr. Irving Coop
er, a New York neurosurgeon,

a thorough study of the tech
nique has not been done.
"Prospective studies have in
dicated that between 60 and 90
percent of patients with
cerebral palsy benefit from the
treatment," said Dr. Richard
Britt, assistant professor of
surgery and project director.
This evidence comes from
studies done by Cooper, which
showed that patients were able
to live more fulfilling lives.
Results similar to these have
been produced in research
done by Dr. Ross Davis of
Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami,
Fla. "In his experience," said
Britt, "the primary effect of

cerebellar stimulation has
been a loweringofspasticmus
cle tone in 90 percent of his pa
tients."
While these reports are op
timistic, there has been con
troversy concerning the true
benefit of the stimulation tech
nique. Britt said the con
troversy stems from results of
studies involving a small
number of patients. In some
studies, the stimulators were
defective so the results were
inaccurate, while others in
dicated that the technique is
effective only when the patient
knows the stimulator is on.
"For this reason, clinicians

dealing with cerebral palsy
children and adults agree that a
well-designed double-blind,
cross-over study is required to
prove the value of cerebellar
stimulation," said Britt.
The Stanford research in
volves 50 patients with signifi
cant spasticity, all of whom will
have a stimulator implanted.
"If the results of the Stanford
study turn out to be as positive
as earlier claims," said Britt,
"the technique might be rapid
ly accepted, leading to signifi
cant improvements in the lives
of some 700,000 disabled pa
tients in the United States."
