## The 						Umnov controversy Faculty speak out on foreign scholar's visit here 
### Steve Trousdale 
On Feb. 16, Gerald Lieberman, dean of
graduate studies and research, gave a
speech outlining University policy
towards research access by foreign scien
tists. In this speech he criticized research
guidelines developed by the State De
partment that, in effect, prevented the
free flow of information between the
United States and other countries, espe
cially the Soviet Union.
Lieberman's speech also discussed the
recent case of Soviet walking machine ex
pert Nikolai Umnov, whose planned visit
to Stanford, and several other American
universities, was at first cancelled because
the University refused to comply with
these State Department guidelines. These
restrictions banned any discussion of De
fense Department research that had not
already been published in the open liter
ature — that is, literature freely available
to all — and forbade visits to local in
dustries.
Later, however, the State Department

Michael Taksar, an assistant professor of operations
research here... maintains that Soviet researchers who
travel to the United States come for the purpose of
transferring vital information and technology from the
United States to the Soviet Union.

modified its decision and said that Umnov
would be allowed to view research
funded by the Defense Department, if
such research was intended to be (instead
of "had already been") published. Since,
according to Bernard Roth, a professor of
mechanical engineering here and Um
nov's proposed host, all university re
search is for publication, this restriction
was in fact not a restriction at all.
Furthermore, Roth said he does not in
tend to send Umnov on visits to industry,
and so the latter restriction would not ap
ply.
University policy in this regard present
ly maintains that access to research must
remain open because secrecy cannot be
tolerated, and is indeed coun

terproductive, in an academic at
mosphere.
However, some opposition to this poli
cy has been voiced by several Stanford
professors. Michael Taksar, an assistant
professor of operations research here, is a
Russian immigrant who worked for six
years in various sections of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences and who maintains
that Soviet researchers who travel to the
United States come for the purpose of
transferring vital information and tech
nology from the United States to the Sovi
et Union.
For instance, Taksar said that "anybody
who comes here (the United States) . . .
has to sign a paper" which requires each
researcher to adhere strictly to the princi
ple opinions espoused in the central (Par
ty) newspapers anytime a question on hu
man rights arises. It also forbids them
from sitting in the same compartment —
usually on a train — with a member of the
opposite sex.
Taksar said further that the chief of the

division on external relationsof the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, which deals with
the exchange program, is a colonel in the
KGB (the Soviet secret police). Within
each group of scientists which travels to
the United States are one or two "moles,"
or informants, who report back to Russia
on each individual's movements, he said.
Communist party and visitors
Because of this informant policy, then,
Taksar said that coming to the United
States alone, as Umnov is doing, is a great
privilege almost always reserved for a
member of the Communist Party.
But Roth disagreed, saying that scien
tists who come here are not necessarily
membersof the Communist Party. "There
are people in very high positions who are

not members of the party," he said, be
cause the Russians try to place the best
people, not just Party members, in high
positions.
Although Roth did not deny that peo
ple he has hosted may have signed such a
document as alleged by Taksar, he said
that often the terms of such contracts
were broken once the scientists were
here. Concerning these contracts, he said
"it seems absurd — they're interested in
Levi's, drinking ..." Roth said, "I'd be
surprised if they were some kind of
agent."
Visitors restricted in USSR
John McCarthy, a computer science
professor here, also disagreed with the
University position in this area. His dissent
stems from his trips to various parts of
Russia, including Leningrad, where he
said restrictions were often placed on his
activities.
McCarthy said he believes that the Uni
versity "should more seriously consider
the (factors) involved in the exchange
program," especially in regard to three
areas: what message the United States is
giving the Russians — for example, vis-a
vis the Polish crisis, the reciprocity of the
program, and less transferring of militarily
useful information.
Designing a University policy
McCarthy and three others, Paul Flory,
professor emeritus of chemistry; Edward
Feigenbaum, professor of computer sci
ence; and Thomas Binford, an adjunct
professor in computer science; ap
proached Lieberman on Feb. 1 in re
sponse, in part, to the Umnov affair. Out
of this meeting came a statement, which
at press time only McCarthy had seen,
containing five policies which McCarthy
said he believes the University should
adopt concerning foreign scholars and
their access to research.
First, he said, the University should
avoid a security atmosphere; second, it
should show "the visitors a society more
open than their own;" third, the Univer
sity should try to minimize the loss of mili
tarily useful technology without resorting
to security measures; fourth, it should
strive towards increasing reciprocity, and

fifth, the University should maintain good
relations with the State Department and
the government in general. But McCarthy
said he believes the University must also
balance these sometimes conflicting
points to form an overall policy.
McCarthy said he was especially con-

allowed contact with foreigners.

cerned with the University's conception
of reciprocity. From his experience in
Russia he learned that many Russian in
stitutions were closed to him and to all
foreigners. He also said that any Soviets
involved in classified research were not
allowed contact with foreigners.
University research classification
Furthermore, he said the Russians are
more stringent in their classification of re
search. In fact, he said he believes that
perhaps one-half of research conducted
at Stanford would be classified in the So
viet Union.
Taksar placed this figure at 95 percent.
However, McCarthy said he is against
materials being classified because he be
lieves that such classification "slows down
our progress." He stated that the Russians
are bogged down in science precisely be
cause of the fact that so much of their re
search is classified.
Thus, McCarthy said that in the interest
of true reciprocity, Russian scientists
should be denied access to individual fa
cilities. He therefore plans"not to invite"
Umnov to the Computer Science Robot
ics Laboratory, which he and Binford
lead.
Taksar has a similar view of University
policy in this area of research access, call
ing it "absolutely insane" because it does
not sufficiently consider the topic of re
ciprocity.

Prof. Thomas Connolly, associate chair
man of the mechanical engineering de
partment, said he agrees that classified re
search should not be conducted at the
University because, "Once you begin to
classify . . . you have no idea where to
draw the line."

However, Connolly also said that re
search done here, which by Faculty Sen
ate policy is always unclassified, "could
prove useful to the military operations of
the Soviet Union."
Benefits of research exchange
Despite this possibility, however, he
said that exchanges should be continued
because the "more channels of com
munication you have open, the betterthe
situation is." Connolly added that the bet
ter one knows a group the less likely he
will "conjure up" strange and negative
opinions about it. Thus Connolly said he
believes that the risks involved in ex
changes are small compared to the pos
sible benefits.
Roth also saidd that exchangesare ben
eficial to both sides because"! don't think
learning any one fact .. . makes a dif
ference." Instead, a person who enters an
exchange leaves with a different attitude
about the hosts and their society, accord
ing to Roth, who has also visited the Sovi
et Union.
In regard to the leakage of technology,
Roth stated that "that's the way the world
is" and said that it is standard practice for
competitors in the computer industry to
buy each other's machines and dis
assemble them to learn how they work.
Roth also said that, even if the Russians
obtain vital technology, it is often beyond
their capacity to use it.

Prof. Thomas Connolly, associate chair

In regard to the leakage of technology,
Roth stated that "that's the way the world

competitors in the computer industry to

Roth also said that, even if the Russians

On Feb. 16, Gerald Lieberman, dean of
graduate studies and research, gave a
speech outlining University policy
towards research access by foreign scien
tists. In this speech he criticized research
guidelines developed by the State De
partment that, in effect, prevented the
free flow of information between the
United States and other countries, espe
cially the Soviet Union.
Lieberman's speech also discussed the
recent case of Soviet walking machine ex
pert Nikolai Umnov, whose planned visit
to Stanford, and several other American
universities, was at first cancelled because
the University refused to comply with
these State Department guidelines. These
restrictions banned any discussion of De
fense Department research that had not
already been published in the open liter
ature — that is, literature freely available
to all — and forbade visits to local in
dustries.
Later, however, the State Department

Michael Taksar, an assistant professor of operations
research here... maintains that Soviet researchers who

United States to the Soviet Union.

modified its decision and said that Umnov
would be allowed to view research
funded by the Defense Department, if
such research was intended to be (instead
of "had already been") published. Since,
according to Bernard Roth, a professor of
mechanical engineering here and Um
nov's proposed host, all university re
search is for publication, this restriction
was in fact not a restriction at all.
Furthermore, Roth said he does not in
tend to send Umnov on visits to industry,
and so the latter restriction would not ap
ply.
University policy in this regard present
ly maintains that access to research must
remain open because secrecy cannot be
tolerated, and is indeed coun

terproductive, in an academic at
mosphere.
However, some opposition to this poli
cy has been voiced by several Stanford
professors. Michael Taksar, an assistant
professor of operations research here, is a
Russian immigrant who worked for six
years in various sections of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences and who maintains
that Soviet researchers who travel to the
United States come for the purpose of
transferring vital information and tech
nology from the United States to the Sovi
et Union.
For instance, Taksar said that "anybody
who comes here (the United States) . . .
has to sign a paper" which requires each
researcher to adhere strictly to the princi
ple opinions espoused in the central (Par
ty) newspapers anytime a question on hu
man rights arises. It also forbids them
from sitting in the same compartment —
usually on a train — with a member of the
opposite sex.
Taksar said further that the chief of the

division on external relationsof the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, which deals with
the exchange program, is a colonel in the
KGB (the Soviet secret police). Within
each group of scientists which travels to
the United States are one or two "moles,"
or informants, who report back to Russia
on each individual's movements, he said.
Communist party and visitors
Because of this informant policy, then,
Taksar said that coming to the United
States alone, as Umnov is doing, is a great
privilege almost always reserved for a
member of the Communist Party.
But Roth disagreed, saying that scien
tists who come here are not necessarily
membersof the Communist Party. "There
are people in very high positions who are

not members of the party," he said, be
cause the Russians try to place the best
people, not just Party members, in high
positions.
Although Roth did not deny that peo
ple he has hosted may have signed such a
document as alleged by Taksar, he said
that often the terms of such contracts
were broken once the scientists were
here. Concerning these contracts, he said
"it seems absurd — they're interested in
Levi's, drinking ..." Roth said, "I'd be
surprised if they were some kind of
agent."
Visitors restricted in USSR
John McCarthy, a computer science
professor here, also disagreed with the
University position in this area. His dissent
stems from his trips to various parts of
Russia, including Leningrad, where he
said restrictions were often placed on his
activities.
McCarthy said he believes that the Uni
versity "should more seriously consider
the (factors) involved in the exchange
program," especially in regard to three
areas: what message the United States is
giving the Russians — for example, vis-a
vis the Polish crisis, the reciprocity of the
program, and less transferring of militarily
useful information.
Designing a University policy
McCarthy and three others, Paul Flory,
professor emeritus of chemistry; Edward
Feigenbaum, professor of computer sci
ence; and Thomas Binford, an adjunct
professor in computer science; ap
proached Lieberman on Feb. 1 in re
sponse, in part, to the Umnov affair. Out
of this meeting came a statement, which
at press time only McCarthy had seen,
containing five policies which McCarthy
said he believes the University should
adopt concerning foreign scholars and
their access to research.
First, he said, the University should
avoid a security atmosphere; second, it
should show "the visitors a society more
open than their own;" third, the Univer
sity should try to minimize the loss of mili
tarily useful technology without resorting
to security measures; fourth, it should
strive towards increasing reciprocity, and

fifth, the University should maintain good
relations with the State Department and
the government in general. But McCarthy
said he believes the University must also
balance these sometimes conflicting
points to form an overall policy.

Furthermore, he said the Russians are
more stringent in their classification of re

perhaps one-half of research conducted
at Stanford would be classified in the So

Taksar placed this figure at 95 percent.
However, McCarthy said he is against
materials being classified because he be

Designing a University policy

professor emeritus of chemistry; Edward
Feigenbaum, professor of computer sci
ence; and Thomas Binford, an adjunct
professor in computer science; ap
proached Lieberman on Feb. 1 in re
sponse, in part, to the Umnov affair. Out
of this meeting came a statement, which
at press time only McCarthy had seen,
containing five policies which McCarthy
said he believes the University should
adopt concerning foreign scholars and
their access to research.
First, he said, the University should
avoid a security atmosphere; second, it
should show "the visitors a society more
open than their own;" third, the Univer
sity should try to minimize the loss of mili
tarily useful technology without resorting
to security measures; fourth, it should
strive towards increasing reciprocity, and

fifth, the University should maintain good
relations with the State Department and
the government in general. But McCarthy
said he believes the University must also
balance these sometimes conflicting
points to form an overall policy.

cerned with the University's conception
of reciprocity. From his experience in
Russia he learned that many Russian in
stitutions were closed to him and to all
foreigners. He also said that any Soviets
involved in classified research were not
allowed contact with foreigners.
University research classification
Furthermore, he said the Russians are
more stringent in their classification of re
search. In fact, he said he believes that
perhaps one-half of research conducted
at Stanford would be classified in the So
viet Union.
Taksar placed this figure at 95 percent.
However, McCarthy said he is against
materials being classified because he be
lieves that such classification "slows down
our progress." He stated that the Russians
are bogged down in science precisely be
cause of the fact that so much of their re
search is classified.
Thus, McCarthy said that in the interest
of true reciprocity, Russian scientists
should be denied access to individual fa
cilities. He therefore plans"not to invite"
Umnov to the Computer Science Robot
ics Laboratory, which he and Binford
lead.
Taksar has a similar view of University
policy in this area of research access, call
ing it "absolutely insane" because it does
not sufficiently consider the topic of re
ciprocity.

Prof. Thomas Connolly, associate chair
man of the mechanical engineering de
partment, said he agrees that classified re
search should not be conducted at the
University because, "Once you begin to
classify . . . you have no idea where to
draw the line."

However, Connolly also said that re
search done here, which by Faculty Sen
ate policy is always unclassified, "could
prove useful to the military operations of
the Soviet Union."
Benefits of research exchange
Despite this possibility, however, he
said that exchanges should be continued
because the "more channels of com
munication you have open, the betterthe
situation is." Connolly added that the bet
ter one knows a group the less likely he
will "conjure up" strange and negative
opinions about it. Thus Connolly said he
believes that the risks involved in ex
changes are small compared to the pos
sible benefits.
Roth also saidd that exchangesare ben
eficial to both sides because"! don't think
learning any one fact .. . makes a dif
ference." Instead, a person who enters an
exchange leaves with a different attitude
about the hosts and their society, accord
ing to Roth, who has also visited the Sovi
et Union.
In regard to the leakage of technology,
Roth stated that "that's the way the world
is" and said that it is standard practice for
competitors in the computer industry to
buy each other's machines and dis
assemble them to learn how they work.
Roth also said that, even if the Russians
obtain vital technology, it is often beyond
their capacity to use it.
On Feb. 16, Gerald Lieberman, dean of
graduate studies and research, gave a
speech outlining University policy
towards research access by foreign scien
tists. In this speech he criticized research
guidelines developed by the State De
partment that, in effect, prevented the
free flow of information between the
United States and other countries, espe
cially the Soviet Union.
Lieberman's speech also discussed the
recent case of Soviet walking machine ex
pert Nikolai Umnov, whose planned visit
to Stanford, and several other American
universities, was at first cancelled because
the University refused to comply with
these State Department guidelines. These
restrictions banned any discussion of De
fense Department research that had not
already been published in the open liter
ature — that is, literature freely available
to all — and forbade visits to local in
dustries.
Later, however, the State Department

Michael Taksar, an assistant professor of operations
research here... maintains that Soviet researchers who
travel to the United States come for the purpose of
transferring vital information and technology from the
United States to the Soviet Union.

modified its decision and said that Umnov
would be allowed to view research
funded by the Defense Department, if
such research was intended to be (instead
of "had already been") published. Since,
according to Bernard Roth, a professor of
mechanical engineering here and Um
nov's proposed host, all university re
search is for publication, this restriction
was in fact not a restriction at all.
Furthermore, Roth said he does not in
tend to send Umnov on visits to industry,
and so the latter restriction would not ap
ply.
University policy in this regard present
ly maintains that access to research must
remain open because secrecy cannot be
tolerated, and is indeed coun

terproductive, in an academic at
mosphere.
However, some opposition to this poli
cy has been voiced by several Stanford
professors. Michael Taksar, an assistant
professor of operations research here, is a
Russian immigrant who worked for six
years in various sections of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences and who maintains
that Soviet researchers who travel to the
United States come for the purpose of
transferring vital information and tech
nology from the United States to the Sovi
et Union.
For instance, Taksar said that "anybody
who comes here (the United States) . . .
has to sign a paper" which requires each
researcher to adhere strictly to the princi
ple opinions espoused in the central (Par
ty) newspapers anytime a question on hu
man rights arises. It also forbids them
from sitting in the same compartment —
usually on a train — with a member of the
opposite sex.
Taksar said further that the chief of the

division on external relationsof the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, which deals with
the exchange program, is a colonel in the
KGB (the Soviet secret police). Within
each group of scientists which travels to
the United States are one or two "moles,"
or informants, who report back to Russia
on each individual's movements, he said.
Communist party and visitors
Because of this informant policy, then,
Taksar said that coming to the United
States alone, as Umnov is doing, is a great
privilege almost always reserved for a
member of the Communist Party.
But Roth disagreed, saying that scien
tists who come here are not necessarily
membersof the Communist Party. "There
are people in very high positions who are

not members of the party," he said, be
cause the Russians try to place the best
people, not just Party members, in high
positions.
Although Roth did not deny that peo
ple he has hosted may have signed such a
document as alleged by Taksar, he said
that often the terms of such contracts
were broken once the scientists were
here. Concerning these contracts, he said
"it seems absurd — they're interested in
Levi's, drinking ..." Roth said, "I'd be
surprised if they were some kind of
agent."
Visitors restricted in USSR
John McCarthy, a computer science
professor here, also disagreed with the
University position in this area. His dissent
stems from his trips to various parts of
Russia, including Leningrad, where he
said restrictions were often placed on his
activities.
McCarthy said he believes that the Uni
versity "should more seriously consider
the (factors) involved in the exchange
program," especially in regard to three
areas: what message the United States is
giving the Russians — for example, vis-a
vis the Polish crisis, the reciprocity of the
program, and less transferring of militarily
useful information.
