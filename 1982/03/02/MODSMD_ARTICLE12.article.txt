## Editorial Space over atmosphere 
### 
Last Wednesday night, Kresge Auditorium was
overflowing again as hundreds of students,
faculty, staff and local residents came out to hear
author Gore Vidal expound on the faults of the
Reagan administration. Yesterday, people
wanting to hear former National Security
Adviser Richard Allen speak had to be turned
away from the doors of Bishop Auditorium.
Such audiences are a credit to Vidal and Allen,
but ought to chagrin the sponsor of the
speeches — theASSU Speakers Bureau
The Vidal speech, which marked the last of six
Winter Writers Series presentations, also
marked the third time in the series when there
were more people than seats in the auditorium,
and the first time that the doors had to be locked
and people turned away after the fire marshall
decided that the auditorium could not safely
hold any more people.
This has happenedatotherspeeches
sponsored by other groups. Organizations such
as the Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE), which co-sponsored the
Phyllis Schlafly — Catharine MacKinnon debate,
have repeatedly eitherscheduled popular
speakers in auditoriums that are too small, or
unpopular ones in facilities that are too big.
We realize that these groups havea difficult
task when they schedule speakers. They must
coordinate the schedule of the speaker — who
often hasonly one day when heorshecan be
here — with that of the University auditoriums,
which are often booked far in advance.
In addition, they must predict what kind of a
turnout the speakersare likely to receive, and

take intoconsideration otherfactors — such as
midterms — which might affect the size of the
audience. Sometimes they are only able to
confirm at the last moment that big-name
speakers like Allen will come to Stanford.
But these groupsarefundedalmostentirely
by fees assessed to the entire student body.
Because of this, their responsibility must be to
the association asa whole. Ratherthan pick an
auditorium because itsatmosphere would be
pleasant or because it has good acoustics,
sponsoring organizations should attempt to
accomodate any and all students who choose to
attend the speech.
Yesterday's placement by the Speaker's
Bureau of loudspeakersoutside Bishop
Auditorium so that those who could not get
inside to hear Allen could at least hear him was a
step in the right direction. Seeing speakers,
however, is often at least as important as hearing
what they have tosay; groups mustallow
students to get inside an auditorium that can
safely hold its audience so they can seethe
speakers deliver their speeches. If ensuring this
necessitates scheduling speeches in Memorial
Auditorium or in rarelyused Fairchildor
Stauffer Auditoriums, so be it.
We urge groups like the Speaker's Bureau, the
Guest Professorship Board, SCOPE and SPA —
who use fee assessment funding to bring
speakers to campus — to rank accomodation
over atmosphere in theirselection of an
auditorium for the event, and to work harder in
planning events ahead of time to allow more
choices to remain available.
