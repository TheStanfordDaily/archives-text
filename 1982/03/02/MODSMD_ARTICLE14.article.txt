## Quick-fix aid for Nicaragua 
### 
Managua, Nicaragua — There was
laughter in the offices of the Sand
inista junta here as top government
officials listened to the Voice of
America broadcast of President
Ronald Reagan's Caribbean Basin In
itiative speech on Feb. 17.
But no one here with any sense
thinks Reagan's $410 million package
is a laughing matter.
As one official wryly remarked to
us moments after learning the details
of Reagan's proposal, "It's the same
old pitiful business. Ronald Reagan is
going back to carrot-and-stick days.
It's sad that so many countries are in
such desperate financial straits that
they would accept any conditions for
U.S. aid."
As proposed, Reagan's Caribbean
Basin Initiative would extend $350
million in immediate economic aid
and $60 million in military help to
carefully-selected countries in the
region. Socialist Nicaragua, however,
will receive little aid of either kind,
and is likely to be denied even the
"one-way free-trade status" that
crowns Reagan's plan.
Not surprisingly, Sandinista of
ficials criticize Reagan's program on
at least two grounds. For one, they
know that the package is little more
than peanuts for a region which, ac
cording to a recent United Nations
report, needs $5 billion in outside aid
to stand on its own feet. Moreover,
Nicaraguans resent being excluded
from the proposal for political rea
sons.
At least one Sandinista official
made no bones about the potential
consequences of America's neglect
for this economically-deprived
country of 2.7 million people. From
this revolutionary's point of view,
Reagan's attempt to penalize
Nicaragua for its brash foreign policy
can only insure the president's worst
nightmare about all-out socialism in
this country.
"What the United States is doing is
making it harder for our people to
live," explained the official. "And by
so doing, they are going to radicalize
us. The less we have, the more we are
going to be forced to nationalize the
private sector. We are going to have
to distribute misery."
While the Reagan team might dis
miss such talk as Marxist-Leninist
whining, the Nicaraguan business
community shares the government's
anxiety over foreign aid. Though the

private sector still controls more than
half the economy (and up to 80 per
cent of total output), America's ef
forts to discourage foreign invest
ment here are undermining the basis
for a strong economy and a demo
cratic future in Nicaragua.
Hard-currency shortages have
helped limit imports of spare parts
for agricultural machinery, medical
supplies and a host of other essential
amenities, including toilet paper.
Sugar is rationed in a country that ex
ports it. Minerals are running low.
"I haven't been able to put up a
new billboard in six months," said
one businessman. "There is not
enough zinc for the paint I need."
Where Nicaraguan businessmen
differ with their government ison the
consequences of U.S. assistance to
other Central American countries.
Improved economies elsewhere,
they feel, might have trickle-down
benefits for Nicaragua.
"Once the economies of Costa
Rica, Panama and Honduras im
prove," said one construction com
pany executive, "we'll be in a better
position to get help from them."
Should this scenario evolve, Rea
gan's Caribbean package would
backfire here and eventually aid the
very government it is designed to ex
tinguish.
Meanwhile, the Sandinistas them
selves are writing their own law to
lure foreign investment. If their
forthcoming package of incentives
and guarantees yields a crop of for
eign capital and new jobs (from such
countries as France and Mexico), the
socialist Sandinistas would beat Rea
gan at his own game.
Americans would do well to un
derstand that Nicaragua is inhabited
by more than a gang of rabid, anti-
U.S. ideologues in army fatigues.
Nicaraguans of many stripes and
backgrounds fear that the immediate
effect of U.S. policy could result in
the "Polandization" of domestic life.
By withdrawing economic support,
the U.S. may force the government
here to clamp down on what remains
of private enterprise and political
pluralism. And Nicaraguans have al
ready seen enough Cubans and
Eastern Europeans to last them a life
time.
Even the Sandinistas aren't blind to
their past mistakes. Yet with the sym
pathy and support of Americans,

among others, many Nicaraguans
sense their inexperienced govern
ment could straighten out its shaky
course. This, after all, is a young
country, and there is still no love lost
for the former regime of Anastasia
Somoza.
At the very least, it's clear that most
Nicaraguans simply want the United
States to let them determine their
own future. But Reagan's quick-fix
proposal for the Carribean makes
their goal all that more elusive.

from the proposal for political rea
sons.
At least one Sandinista official
made no bones about the potential
consequences of America's neglect
for this economically-deprived
country of 2.7 million people. From
this revolutionary's point of view,
Reagan's attempt to penalize
Nicaragua for its brash foreign policy
can only insure the president's worst
nightmare about all-out socialism in
this country.
"What the United States is doing is
making it harder for our people to
live," explained the official. "And by
so doing, they are going to radicalize
us. The less we have, the more we are
going to be forced to nationalize the
private sector. We are going to have
to distribute misery."
While the Reagan team might dis
miss such talk as Marxist-Leninist
whining, the Nicaraguan business
community shares the government's
anxiety over foreign aid. Though the

private sector still controls more than
half the economy (and up to 80 per
cent of total output), America's ef
forts to discourage foreign invest
ment here are undermining the basis
for a strong economy and a demo
cratic future in Nicaragua.
Hard-currency shortages have
helped limit imports of spare parts
for agricultural machinery, medical
supplies and a host of other essential
amenities, including toilet paper.
Sugar is rationed in a country that ex
ports it. Minerals are running low.
"I haven't been able to put up a
new billboard in six months," said
one businessman. "There is not
enough zinc for the paint I need."
Where Nicaraguan businessmen
differ with their government ison the
consequences of U.S. assistance to
other Central American countries.
Improved economies elsewhere,
they feel, might have trickle-down
benefits for Nicaragua.
"Once the economies of Costa
Rica, Panama and Honduras im
prove," said one construction com
pany executive, "we'll be in a better
position to get help from them."
Should this scenario evolve, Rea
gan's Caribbean package would
backfire here and eventually aid the
very government it is designed to ex
tinguish.
Meanwhile, the Sandinistas them
selves are writing their own law to
lure foreign investment. If their
forthcoming package of incentives
and guarantees yields a crop of for
eign capital and new jobs (from such
countries as France and Mexico), the
socialist Sandinistas would beat Rea
gan at his own game.
Americans would do well to un
derstand that Nicaragua is inhabited
by more than a gang of rabid, anti-
U.S. ideologues in army fatigues.
Nicaraguans of many stripes and
backgrounds fear that the immediate
effect of U.S. policy could result in
the "Polandization" of domestic life.
By withdrawing economic support,
the U.S. may force the government
here to clamp down on what remains
of private enterprise and political
pluralism. And Nicaraguans have al
ready seen enough Cubans and
Eastern Europeans to last them a life
time.
Even the Sandinistas aren't blind to
their past mistakes. Yet with the sym
pathy and support of Americans,

among others, many Nicaraguans
sense their inexperienced govern
ment could straighten out its shaky
course. This, after all, is a young
country, and there is still no love lost
for the former regime of Anastasia
Somoza.
At the very least, it's clear that most
Nicaraguans simply want the United
States to let them determine their
own future. But Reagan's quick-fix
proposal for the Carribean makes
their goal all that more elusive.

Managua, Nicaragua — There was
laughter in the offices of the Sand
inista junta here as top government
officials listened to the Voice of
America broadcast of President
Ronald Reagan's Caribbean Basin In
itiative speech on Feb. 17.
But no one here with any sense
thinks Reagan's $410 million package
is a laughing matter.
As one official wryly remarked to
us moments after learning the details
of Reagan's proposal, "It's the same
old pitiful business. Ronald Reagan is
going back to carrot-and-stick days.
It's sad that so many countries are in
such desperate financial straits that
they would accept any conditions for
U.S. aid."
As proposed, Reagan's Caribbean
Basin Initiative would extend $350
million in immediate economic aid
and $60 million in military help to
carefully-selected countries in the
region. Socialist Nicaragua, however,
will receive little aid of either kind,
and is likely to be denied even the
"one-way free-trade status" that
crowns Reagan's plan.
Not surprisingly, Sandinista of
ficials criticize Reagan's program on
at least two grounds. For one, they
know that the package is little more
than peanuts for a region which, ac
cording to a recent United Nations
report, needs $5 billion in outside aid
to stand on its own feet. Moreover,
Nicaraguans resent being excluded
from the proposal for political rea
sons.
