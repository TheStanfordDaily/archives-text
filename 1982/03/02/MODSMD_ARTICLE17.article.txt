# Nuclear fuel cycle is harmful
## 
### 
As Gore Vidal pointed out here Feb. 23, even though
we think of ourselves as a peaceful nation, we haven't
known a minute's real peace since the bombing of Pearl
Harbor. We have been constantly at war, fighting wars
both hot and cold.
We see ourselves as living in a world split down the
middle, with the forces of good all on one side; ourown.
As a nation we are swollen with hubris, false and arrogant
pride. As any student of Greek tragedy knows, not only is
hubris the stuff of which tragedies are made, it is also the
stuff after which they inevitably follow. Yet ever since the
atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, our hubris has
been coupled with an unceasing and unconscious ter
ror.
The novelist Arthur Koestler has written: "From the
dawn of consciousness until Aug. 6,1945, man had to live
with the prospect of his death as an individual; since the
day when the first atomic bomb outshone the sun over
Hiroshima, mankind as a whole has had to live with the
prospect of its extinction as a species."
This terrible knowledge, that the atomic age is and
must be something totally different from all past ages in
human history, weighs heavily on some of us in this
country but not, apparently, on all. In our blind worship
of profits and technology we are rushing ahead with a
domestic nuclear technology that plainly, obviously, car
ries suicidal risks and questionable benefits. You don't
believe me? Come, then, let's take a quick look at the na
ture of the beast, at its guts and inner workings. Straight
from the atom's nucleus, the ninth wonder of the world,
the nuclear fuel cycle:
1. Uranium mining: Exposed piles of uranium tailings
contain radium, a radioactive element found naturally
with uranium ore. As it ages, it releases radon, a
chemically inert gas which is, like radium, a potent cause
of lung cancer.
Huge piles of these tailings lie unattended less than a
stone's throw away from Navajo Indian homes and
worse, they were used in the construction of thousands
of homes, and as landfill, by Navajos and others who
were never warned how dangerous the wastes are.
Apparently the Navajos were useful as human burros
to Kerr-McGee and the other large energy corporations:
once the uranium ore had been mined they cared
neither about the land they had despoiled nor the peo
ple whose way of life they were destroying.
According to Dr. Leverne Huston, a practicing physi
cian in the area of Red Rock, Ariz, since 1970: "The ex
posed radon gas attaches itself to dust particles which are
breathed into the lung. The radon eventually breaks
down into lead and implants itself into the lung wall. It
remains radioactive, which causes the cancer, but first
scar tissue forms around the particles, builds up, and

causes pulmonary fibrosis."
2. Enrichment: Natural uranium contains a mix of two
isotopes, U-235 and U-238. To increase the proportion of
U-238 to a fissionable level, the "yellowcake" from the
mine is chemically converted to gas, the gas runs
through an expensive and elaborate process (consuming
an enormous amount of electrical power which would
otherwise be available to the consumer), and then the
"enriched" gas is turned back into solid form for use as a
reactor fuel.
Health studies (covering the years 1950-1969) of wom
en in counties bordering the Oak Ridge (Tenn.) en
richment plant show that these women suffer from
leukemia and lung cancer at four times the normal rate.
3. Fuel fabrication: Uranium and reprocessed
plutonium are formed into pellets and inserted into re
actor fuel rods. The plutonium fuel fabrication plant op
erated by Kerr-McGee near Crescent, Okla., internally
contaminated 200 workers with plutonium. According to
an article in Science, (Sept. 29,1974) there was "a dismal
repetition of leaks in glove boxes, of inoperative radi
ation monitors, of employees who failed to follow in
structions, of managers accused by the AEC of ineptness
and failing to provide safety supervision or training to
employees.
4. Inside the reaction: Through fission, products such
as iodine 131, strontium 90, cesium 137 and plutonium
are produced. The first three are beta-emitters, which
give off electrons. Plutonium is an alpha-emitter, which
emits a helium nucleus. Both kinds of radioactive
emission damage cell function, kills cells and cause
cancer.
Plutonium, in fact, is so toxic that people who've
worked with it say they haven't been able to find a low
enough dose to keep dogs to whom it has been adminis
tered from getting lung cancer. That's not normal in
medical research. Usually there's some treshhold in a
drug below which it does not harm.
Plutonium is an interesting metal. If exposed to air, it
ignites spontaneously, forming tiny, aerosol-like parti
cles which can easily be breathed into the lung. The
many nuclear reactors all across the country will produce
thousands of tons of this substance, so deadly that less
than one-millionth of an ounce of it will cause lung
cancer if inhaled. This is what a nuclear reactor does
when working correctly, as it is designed to work.
5. Reprocessing and storage: The time required for
each radioactive element to become stable varies with
the element; it ranges from fractions of a second to
billions of years. I haven't even mentioned the cost
spiral, the numerous design flaws, the low bid construc
tion with improper and inadequate inspection, and the
impossibility of containing the spent fuel to the degree
of absolute perfection that is required.
I make no claim to being religious, but the following
lines seem relevant here: "I have set before you life and
death, a blessing and a curse. Choose life that you and
your seed may live." (Deut. 30:19).
Welcome to the nuclear age.
