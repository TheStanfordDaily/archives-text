## Female stereotypes unfair 
### 
This is my response to the Kohns'
column, "Tuition rise, dad'sdemise,"
(Daily, Feb. 24). The article pro
mulgates a sexual stereotype in its
non-portrayal of Mom. To imply that
the mother does not care about tui
tion increases is wrong, yet this is
how she is portrayed in the article.
Mom only appears on the scene in
two incidental ways, one of which is
to ask what color the wallpaper
should be. The authors' perception
of Mom is at best one-sided; it is at
least uninformed.
Mothers do care about tuition
rises. Many mothers pay entirely for
their childrens' education, even at
Stanford. There is a whole spectrum
of caring/paying in there as well.
Many women at Stanford, and
elsewhere, feel angered by the non
view of Moms that is offered us.
Editors, what are we to think? Do
you endorse this? Is it funny? The
headline seems apt enough, but with
some thought it could have read a lit
tle differently, substituting "parent"
for "dad." These are the subtle ways
our perceptions about life can be
manipulated.

I'm concerned about the subtle —
sometimes not so subtle — slander of
the Mormon church in the Daily. I
finally feel moved to write after the
Feb. 26 article on Polish journalist

Lidia Wasowicz.
The article stated, "Because of its
large Mormon population, Salt Lake
City may not have been the easiest
place for a woman to start a career in
journalism ..." With this statement,
the Daily directly connects sexism
and prejudice against women with
the Mormon church, and in effect
blames the church members forall of
the sexism in the city.
The statement is supported by the
report of Wasowicz's first job at The
Deseret News where "a new bureau
chief" asked her why she wasn't
"barefoot and pregnant and in the
kitchen." While he was obviously an
uninformed, sexist man, it is not fair
to blame the chief's attitude on the
Mormon church.
I've known many men with the
same attitude as Wasowicz's em
ployer — some Mormon, some not.
That attitude is not particular to the
Mormon church, nor is it supported
by the church. The church believes,
even'stresses, that women and men
are equal, but there are some mem
bers who are slow to learn.
It is important to remember that
those people are not sexist because
they are Mormon, but in spite of it.
As a supposedly non-biased news
paper, it is the responsibility of the
Daily not to perpetuate prejudices
against any church or group of peo
ple.
