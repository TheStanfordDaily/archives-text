Thousands of students deluge Washington
to lobby against education cuts
Washington — Carrying signs and chanting "books, not bombs,"
thousands of college students from across the country swarmed over
Capitol Hill yesterday lobbying lawmakers against the Reagan adminis
tration's proposed cuts in federal aid to higher education.
At the same time, the National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities predicted that more than 500,000 students would be
forced to quit school or switch to less-expensive institutions if President
Ronald Reagan's proposals are adopted.
In still another development, 21 freshmen Republican House mem
bers announced their support of the student lobbyists. "We supported
the president down the line last year because his proposals were rea
sonable," said Rep. Jim Dunn (R-Mich.) head of the GOP group. "We
don't think they're reasonable this year."
A Democrat, Rep. Peter Peyser of New York, who helped organize
the "National Student Lobby Day", that brought the youths to Washing
ton, said that the cuts would deal a "crippling blow" to economic and
cultural institutions. He told an assembly of students in a congressional
caucus room: "If the Congress takes funds away from education, it will
betray the young men and women of the United States and — for that
matter — all Americans."
The Reagan administration has asked that federal spend
ing for grants and work-study programs for college students
be cut to less than half their fiscal 1981 levels by fiscal 1904. It
has also proposed major changes in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program, including making graduate and professional
students ineligible for the loans.
John Phillips, president of the National Association of In
dependent Colleges and Universities, which represents
some 900 private institutions, said that students attending
them would lose about $1.3 billion in student aid funds un
der Reagan's spending cuts. He said that 500,000 — 28 per
cent — of the 1.8 million students enrolled in the schools
would be forced to abandon their education.
"The budget proposals will close academic doors on hun
dreds of thousands of low-to-middle-income students who
heretofore were guaranteed access... to diverse programs
in higher ecucation," he said.
The 21 Republican House members, wrote to the presi
dent last week protesting the spending cuts.
Leading economic indicators fall again
Washington — The government's leading economic in
dicators fell in January forthe ninth month ina row, signaling
that the recession has not yet hit bottom, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
It said that the indicators declined by 0.6 per cent last
month but would have plunged by 2.8 per cent if a sharp
weather-related drop in the average workweek had not
been omitted from the January calculation.
That omission, unprecedented in the 21-year history of the
index of leading indicators, was challenged by some private
economists on grounds it could be an attempt to mask bad
news by adjusting the numbers.
Other private analysts and Department of Commerce of
ficials, however, justified the change on grounds that it pro
vided a more balanced picture of where the economy is
headed.
In a significant revision of a previous report, the depart
ment also said yesterday that later data showed that the in
dicators for December declined by 0.3 per cent instead of ris
ing by 0.6 per cent as first announced.
While noting that recent declines in the economy were
much smaller than downturns in the index last fall, Secretary
of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said, "They still provide evi
dence that the recession has not yet run its course."
Despite the setbacks, Baldrige said, the economy still can
recover from the recession in the second quarter of this year
as the Reagan administration has predicted.
Task force ends Atlanta probe
Atlanta — The special police task force investigating the
murders of 28 young blacks here will close its doors for good,
Public Safety Commissioner Lee Brown said yesterday, two
days after Wayne Williams was convicted in the killings of
two of the victims on the task force's list.
Brown said authorities have evidence tying Williams to 21
other victims, 20 of whom were on the list. Evidence from the

murder of the 21st victim was introduced at Williams' trial, as
was evidence from nine other murders investigated by the
task force. Williams was not charged with the nine other
murders.
Brown met yesterday with state, county and federal law
enforcement officials and local prosecutors who reviewed
the cases and closed the files on them.
"With Wayne Williams' conviction, we've reviewed all the
cases and cleared 23," Brown told a news conference.
"Do you believe Wayne Williams committed 23 murders?"
Brown was asked.
"Yes we do," said Brown, speaking at task force head
quarters on West Peachtree Street, where the walls were
once hung with composite sketches of killers drawn from
psychics' visions.
Almost 200,000 bits of information were fed into computer
terminals in the downtown headquarters, a converted car
dealership. The phones once rang off the hook with tipsters
reporting sightings of "the snatcher."
The walls are bare now, save for an area map and a motto
— "In God We Trust, All Others We Polygraph." The phones
ceased jangling — and the string of similar killings stopped —
soon after Williams was stopped for questioning last May 22
when he drove across a bridge over the Chattahoochee
River.
Brezhnev lauds Polish martial law
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, praised Po
land's martial-law restrictions yesterday as "timely meas
ures." Brezhnev promised continued economic aid as Po
land's premier, Gen. Woiciech Jaruzelski, arrived in Moscow
on his first foreign visit since imposing martial law Dec. 13.
The Soviet Union, Brezhnev said at a Kremlin dinner hon
oring Jaruzelski, viewed martial law in Poland "with full un
derstanding."
"These are timely measures," Brezhnev said, according to
the official Tass press agency. "Had the Communists given
way to the counter revolution, had they wavered under the
furious attacks by the enemies of socialism, the destinies of
Poland, stability in Europe and in the world at large would
have been jeopardized."
Jaruzelski expressed warm gratitude for the Kremlin's
"understanding" of Poland's problems and thanked Soviet
leaders for their conviction that Poland could solve them
"with our own forces."
There was no sign of disagreement between the two lead
ers, who exchanged what were probably the warmest public
greetings that have passed between Moscow and Warsaw
since labor unrest first gave rise to the now-suppressed Soli
darity independent trade Union movement in the summer
of 1980.
Reagan won't speed gas decontrol
Washington — President Ronald Reagan announced yes
terday he would not press for legislation this year to speed
the decontrol of natural gas, thereby dropping for the near
future a major energy plank of his 1980 campaign platform.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said the

president, after extensive consultations with congressional
leaders, had decided that any accelerated decontrol bill
would "overload an already heavy legislative agenda."
The White House retreat represents tacit acknowl
edgement of the political cost of pushing election-year legis
lation that could double natural gas prices by 1985. Roughly
half of the nation's homes are heated with natural gas.
Industry leaders, who had been waging an extensive lob
bying campaign in support of accelerated decontrol for the
past year, expressed their disappointment with the decision,
in the words of Gene Wright, chairman of the Natural Gas
Supply Association.
Consumer and labor groups were delighted with the
anouncement, but cautioned that they think Reagan now
will try to achieve through administrative action what he
could not accomplish through the legislative process.
They noted that the Reagan appointee who now chairs the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, C."Mike" Butler, is
preparing a proposal that would raise the average price of all
gas by about a third.
"We've won the battle, but we haven't yet won the war,"
said Robert Brandon, director of the Citizens-Labor Energy
Coalition, who claimed that Butler was prepared to "stretch
the limits of the law" in finding ways to achieve higher gas
prices administratively.
Dow Jones nudges upward
New York — The stock market turned upward near the
close of a drifting session to post a moderate gain yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off about 3 points
at its mid-day low, closed up 4.00 at 828.39.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached 53.01 million
shares, against Friday's total of 43.84 million.

Reagan won't speed gas decontrol
Washington — President Ronald Reagan announced yes
terday he would not press for legislation this year to speed
the decontrol of natural gas, thereby dropping for the near
future a major energy plank of his 1980 campaign platform.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said the

president, after extensive consultations with congressional
leaders, had decided that any accelerated decontrol bill
would "overload an already heavy legislative agenda."
The White House retreat represents tacit acknowl
edgement of the political cost of pushing election-year legis
lation that could double natural gas prices by 1985. Roughly
half of the nation's homes are heated with natural gas.
Industry leaders, who had been waging an extensive lob
bying campaign in support of accelerated decontrol for the
past year, expressed their disappointment with the decision,
in the words of Gene Wright, chairman of the Natural Gas
Supply Association.
Consumer and labor groups were delighted with the
anouncement, but cautioned that they think Reagan now
will try to achieve through administrative action what he
could not accomplish through the legislative process.
They noted that the Reagan appointee who now chairs the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, C."Mike" Butler, is
preparing a proposal that would raise the average price of all
gas by about a third.
"We've won the battle, but we haven't yet won the war,"
said Robert Brandon, director of the Citizens-Labor Energy
Coalition, who claimed that Butler was prepared to "stretch
the limits of the law" in finding ways to achieve higher gas
prices administratively.

Thousands of students deluge Washington
to lobby against education cuts
Washington — Carrying signs and chanting "books, not bombs,"
thousands of college students from across the country swarmed over
Capitol Hill yesterday lobbying lawmakers against the Reagan adminis
tration's proposed cuts in federal aid to higher education.
At the same time, the National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities predicted that more than 500,000 students would be
forced to quit school or switch to less-expensive institutions if President
Ronald Reagan's proposals are adopted.
In still another development, 21 freshmen Republican House mem
bers announced their support of the student lobbyists. "We supported
the president down the line last year because his proposals were rea
sonable," said Rep. Jim Dunn (R-Mich.) head of the GOP group. "We
don't think they're reasonable this year."
A Democrat, Rep. Peter Peyser of New York, who helped organize
the "National Student Lobby Day", that brought the youths to Washing
ton, said that the cuts would deal a "crippling blow" to economic and
cultural institutions. He told an assembly of students in a congressional
caucus room: "If the Congress takes funds away from education, it will
betray the young men and women of the United States and — for that
matter — all Americans."
The Reagan administration has asked that federal spend
ing for grants and work-study programs for college students
be cut to less than half their fiscal 1981 levels by fiscal 1904. It
has also proposed major changes in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program, including making graduate and professional
students ineligible for the loans.
John Phillips, president of the National Association of In
dependent Colleges and Universities, which represents
some 900 private institutions, said that students attending
them would lose about $1.3 billion in student aid funds un
der Reagan's spending cuts. He said that 500,000 — 28 per
cent — of the 1.8 million students enrolled in the schools
would be forced to abandon their education.
"The budget proposals will close academic doors on hun
dreds of thousands of low-to-middle-income students who
heretofore were guaranteed access... to diverse programs
in higher ecucation," he said.

Leading economic indicators fall again
Washington — The government's leading economic in
dicators fell in January forthe ninth month ina row, signaling
that the recession has not yet hit bottom, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
It said that the indicators declined by 0.6 per cent last
month but would have plunged by 2.8 per cent if a sharp
weather-related drop in the average workweek had not
been omitted from the January calculation.
That omission, unprecedented in the 21-year history of the
index of leading indicators, was challenged by some private
economists on grounds it could be an attempt to mask bad
news by adjusting the numbers.
Other private analysts and Department of Commerce of
ficials, however, justified the change on grounds that it pro
vided a more balanced picture of where the economy is
headed.
In a significant revision of a previous report, the depart

dicators for December declined by 0.3 per cent instead of ris
ing by 0.6 per cent as first announced.
While noting that recent declines in the economy were
much smaller than downturns in the index last fall, Secretary
of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said, "They still provide evi

Despite the setbacks, Baldrige said, the economy still can
recover from the recession in the second quarter of this year
as the Reagan administration has predicted.
Task force ends Atlanta probe
Atlanta — The special police task force investigating the
murders of 28 young blacks here will close its doors for good,
Public Safety Commissioner Lee Brown said yesterday, two
days after Wayne Williams was convicted in the killings of
two of the victims on the task force's list.
Brown said authorities have evidence tying Williams to 21
other victims, 20 of whom were on the list. Evidence from the

murder of the 21st victim was introduced at Williams' trial, as
was evidence from nine other murders investigated by the
task force. Williams was not charged with the nine other
murders.
Brown met yesterday with state, county and federal law
enforcement officials and local prosecutors who reviewed
the cases and closed the files on them.
"With Wayne Williams' conviction, we've reviewed all the
cases and cleared 23," Brown told a news conference.
"Do you believe Wayne Williams committed 23 murders?"
Brown was asked.
"Yes we do," said Brown, speaking at task force head
quarters on West Peachtree Street, where the walls were
once hung with composite sketches of killers drawn from
psychics' visions.
Almost 200,000 bits of information were fed into computer
terminals in the downtown headquarters, a converted car
dealership. The phones once rang off the hook with tipsters
reporting sightings of "the snatcher."
The walls are bare now, save for an area map and a motto
— "In God We Trust, All Others We Polygraph." The phones
ceased jangling — and the string of similar killings stopped —
soon after Williams was stopped for questioning last May 22
when he drove across a bridge over the Chattahoochee
River.
Brezhnev lauds Polish martial law
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, praised Po
land's martial-law restrictions yesterday as "timely meas

land's premier, Gen. Woiciech Jaruzelski, arrived in Moscow
on his first foreign visit since imposing martial law Dec. 13.
The Soviet Union, Brezhnev said at a Kremlin dinner hon
oring Jaruzelski, viewed martial law in Poland "with full un
derstanding."
"These are timely measures," Brezhnev said, according to
the official Tass press agency. "Had the Communists given
way to the counter revolution, had they wavered under the
furious attacks by the enemies of socialism, the destinies of
Poland, stability in Europe and in the world at large would
have been jeopardized."
Jaruzelski expressed warm gratitude for the Kremlin's

"with our own forces."

Despite the setbacks, Baldrige said, the economy still can
recover from the recession in the second quarter of this year
as the Reagan administration has predicted.
Task force ends Atlanta probe
Atlanta — The special police task force investigating the
murders of 28 young blacks here will close its doors for good,
Public Safety Commissioner Lee Brown said yesterday, two
days after Wayne Williams was convicted in the killings of
two of the victims on the task force's list.
Brown said authorities have evidence tying Williams to 21
other victims, 20 of whom were on the list. Evidence from the

murder of the 21st victim was introduced at Williams' trial, as
was evidence from nine other murders investigated by the
task force. Williams was not charged with the nine other
murders.
Brown met yesterday with state, county and federal law
enforcement officials and local prosecutors who reviewed
the cases and closed the files on them.
"With Wayne Williams' conviction, we've reviewed all the
cases and cleared 23," Brown told a news conference.
"Do you believe Wayne Williams committed 23 murders?"
Brown was asked.
"Yes we do," said Brown, speaking at task force head
quarters on West Peachtree Street, where the walls were
once hung with composite sketches of killers drawn from
psychics' visions.
Almost 200,000 bits of information were fed into computer
terminals in the downtown headquarters, a converted car
dealership. The phones once rang off the hook with tipsters
reporting sightings of "the snatcher."
The walls are bare now, save for an area map and a motto
— "In God We Trust, All Others We Polygraph." The phones
ceased jangling — and the string of similar killings stopped —
soon after Williams was stopped for questioning last May 22
when he drove across a bridge over the Chattahoochee
River.
Brezhnev lauds Polish martial law
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev, praised Po
land's martial-law restrictions yesterday as "timely meas
ures." Brezhnev promised continued economic aid as Po
land's premier, Gen. Woiciech Jaruzelski, arrived in Moscow
on his first foreign visit since imposing martial law Dec. 13.
The Soviet Union, Brezhnev said at a Kremlin dinner hon
oring Jaruzelski, viewed martial law in Poland "with full un
derstanding."
"These are timely measures," Brezhnev said, according to
the official Tass press agency. "Had the Communists given
way to the counter revolution, had they wavered under the
furious attacks by the enemies of socialism, the destinies of
Poland, stability in Europe and in the world at large would
have been jeopardized."
Jaruzelski expressed warm gratitude for the Kremlin's
"understanding" of Poland's problems and thanked Soviet
leaders for their conviction that Poland could solve them
"with our own forces."
There was no sign of disagreement between the two lead
ers, who exchanged what were probably the warmest public
greetings that have passed between Moscow and Warsaw
since labor unrest first gave rise to the now-suppressed Soli
darity independent trade Union movement in the summer
of 1980.
Reagan won't speed gas decontrol
Washington — President Ronald Reagan announced yes
terday he would not press for legislation this year to speed
the decontrol of natural gas, thereby dropping for the near
future a major energy plank of his 1980 campaign platform.
White House deputy press secretary Larry Speakes said the

president, after extensive consultations with congressional
leaders, had decided that any accelerated decontrol bill
would "overload an already heavy legislative agenda."
The White House retreat represents tacit acknowl
edgement of the political cost of pushing election-year legis
lation that could double natural gas prices by 1985. Roughly
half of the nation's homes are heated with natural gas.
Industry leaders, who had been waging an extensive lob
bying campaign in support of accelerated decontrol for the
past year, expressed their disappointment with the decision,
in the words of Gene Wright, chairman of the Natural Gas
Supply Association.
Consumer and labor groups were delighted with the
anouncement, but cautioned that they think Reagan now
will try to achieve through administrative action what he
could not accomplish through the legislative process.
They noted that the Reagan appointee who now chairs the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, C."Mike" Butler, is
preparing a proposal that would raise the average price of all
gas by about a third.
"We've won the battle, but we haven't yet won the war,"
said Robert Brandon, director of the Citizens-Labor Energy
Coalition, who claimed that Butler was prepared to "stretch
the limits of the law" in finding ways to achieve higher gas
prices administratively.

Thousands of students deluge Washington
to lobby against education cuts
Washington — Carrying signs and chanting "books, not bombs,"
thousands of college students from across the country swarmed over
Capitol Hill yesterday lobbying lawmakers against the Reagan adminis
tration's proposed cuts in federal aid to higher education.
At the same time, the National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities predicted that more than 500,000 students would be
forced to quit school or switch to less-expensive institutions if President
Ronald Reagan's proposals are adopted.
In still another development, 21 freshmen Republican House mem
bers announced their support of the student lobbyists. "We supported
the president down the line last year because his proposals were rea
sonable," said Rep. Jim Dunn (R-Mich.) head of the GOP group. "We
don't think they're reasonable this year."
A Democrat, Rep. Peter Peyser of New York, who helped organize
the "National Student Lobby Day", that brought the youths to Washing
ton, said that the cuts would deal a "crippling blow" to economic and
cultural institutions. He told an assembly of students in a congressional
caucus room: "If the Congress takes funds away from education, it will
betray the young men and women of the United States and — for that
matter — all Americans."
The Reagan administration has asked that federal spend
ing for grants and work-study programs for college students
be cut to less than half their fiscal 1981 levels by fiscal 1904. It
has also proposed major changes in the Guaranteed Student
Loan Program, including making graduate and professional
students ineligible for the loans.
John Phillips, president of the National Association of In
dependent Colleges and Universities, which represents
some 900 private institutions, said that students attending
them would lose about $1.3 billion in student aid funds un
der Reagan's spending cuts. He said that 500,000 — 28 per
cent — of the 1.8 million students enrolled in the schools
would be forced to abandon their education.
"The budget proposals will close academic doors on hun
dreds of thousands of low-to-middle-income students who
heretofore were guaranteed access... to diverse programs
in higher ecucation," he said.
The 21 Republican House members, wrote to the presi
dent last week protesting the spending cuts.
Leading economic indicators fall again
Washington — The government's leading economic in
dicators fell in January forthe ninth month ina row, signaling
that the recession has not yet hit bottom, the Department of
Commerce reported yesterday.
It said that the indicators declined by 0.6 per cent last
month but would have plunged by 2.8 per cent if a sharp
weather-related drop in the average workweek had not
been omitted from the January calculation.
That omission, unprecedented in the 21-year history of the
index of leading indicators, was challenged by some private
economists on grounds it could be an attempt to mask bad
news by adjusting the numbers.
Other private analysts and Department of Commerce of
ficials, however, justified the change on grounds that it pro
vided a more balanced picture of where the economy is
headed.
In a significant revision of a previous report, the depart
ment also said yesterday that later data showed that the in
dicators for December declined by 0.3 per cent instead of ris
ing by 0.6 per cent as first announced.
While noting that recent declines in the economy were
much smaller than downturns in the index last fall, Secretary
of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said, "They still provide evi
dence that the recession has not yet run its course."
Despite the setbacks, Baldrige said, the economy still can
recover from the recession in the second quarter of this year
as the Reagan administration has predicted.
