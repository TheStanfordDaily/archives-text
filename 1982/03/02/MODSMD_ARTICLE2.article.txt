Thousands of students deluge Washington
to lobby against education cuts
Washington — Carrying signs and chanting "books, not bombs,"
thousands of college students from across the country swarmed over
Capitol Hill yesterday lobbying lawmakers against the Reagan adminis
tration's proposed cuts in federal aid to higher education.
At the same time, the National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities predicted that more than 500,000 students would be
forced to quit school or switch to less-expensive institutions if President
Ronald Reagan's proposals are adopted.
In still another development, 21 freshmen Republican House mem
bers announced their support of the student lobbyists. "We supported
the president down the line last year because his proposals were rea
sonable," said Rep. Jim Dunn (R-Mich.) head of the GOP group. "We
don't think they're reasonable this year."
A Democrat, Rep. Peter Peyser of New York, who helped organize
the "National Student Lobby Day", that brought the youths to Washing
ton, said that the cuts would deal a "crippling blow" to economic and
cultural institutions. He told an assembly of students in a congressional
caucus room: "If the Congress takes funds away from education, it will
betray the young men and women of the United States and — for that
matter — all Americans."
