I as expansive as the Opera

i All-star concerts such as this
one often degenerate into
loosely structured jam sessions,
with little concern for subtlety
or balance, but this was defi
nitely not the case most of
Monday night's performance.
The promoters, for the most
part, kept the performing units
small in size, thus letting the
musicians generate a tighter,
more intimate sound. This al

lowed each of the artists to
stretch out at length over famil
iar turf, without the fear of
stepping on the toes of some
other major jazz figure.
For example, Denny Zeitlin,
probably the least known of
the performers, was given the
opportunity to showcase his
considerable talent on a solo
piano piece. Zeitlin, who leads
the double life of a jazz musi
cian and prominent San Fran
cisco psychiatrist, recorded
some of the most exciting jazz
piano albums of the '60s for
Columbia Records, but was
dropped from the label when
he refused to give up his medi
cal practice to tour and pro
mote his music. With those
albums virtually impossible to

find, Zeitlin is largely unknown
among jazz fans, even here in
the Bay Area. The packed Op
era House crowd was probably
the largest audience Zeitlin has
played for in over a decade, but
he showed little nervousness.
On his composition "Cascade"
he revealed the feathery touch
and the distinctive chord voic
ings which have so long been
his trademark.
Later in the performance
Ffancock joined Zeitlin for two
piano duets dedicated to the
late Thelonious Monk. Han

cock mentioned to the au
dience his long-standing ad
miration of Zeitlin going back
to the mid-'6os. These two
men both emerged on the jazz
scene at the same time, both
espousing a melodic, yet har
monically innovative style of
playing the piano. Hancock's
more recent involvement in
funk has obscured these early
similarities, but during the
acoustic piano duet the pow
erful affinity these two have for
each other was brought to the
forefront. Their reworking of
Monk's "Round Midnight"
was especially inspirational.
FHancock was playing as
creatively Monday night as at
any time I have heard him dur
ing the past decade. The lack of
ease with the piano he showed
during the VSOP tour or during
other recent jaunts into
acoustic settings was nowhere
in sight. The last time I had
heard Hancock approach the
heights he hit on Monday was
in 1979 at the benefit concert
for the radio station KJAZ,
which was then in danger of
losing its license; then he tore
through several standards like
a man possessed. Fronting a un
illustrious house rhythm sec
tion he took "Autumn Leaves"
and tried to make it into some
sort of jazz equivalent of
Beethoven's "Diabelli Vari
ations."
This same inspired Hancock
showed up for Monday's per
formance. His duets with vibra
phonist Bobby Hutcherson
were, to my mind, the higlight
of the show. They worked
through an attractive version of
Hutcherson's piece "Little B's
Poem" in which Hancock pro
vided sensitive accompani
ment to Hutcherson's florid

playing. But it was on the next
piece, Hancock's "Maiden
Voyage," that the performance
really clicked. Both musicians
succumbed to the spontaneity
of the occasion and playfully
reworked the tune in a variety
of ingenious ways. There were
rough edges — a mix-up on
when Hutcherson should enter
with the melody — but some
how one didn't mind; when
one improvises with this kind
of daring and aplomb, one risks
all kinds of mistakes. The ele
ment of humor was never lack
ing — at the music's most

ethereal point, Hutcherson in
terspersed a musical quote
from the commercial jingle for
a well known chain of ham
burger stands.
One would have imagined
that these moving duets would
have been impossible to fol
low, and indeed under most
circumstances that would have
been true. But not when Sonny
Rollins is waiting off-stage to
follow with one of his much
heralded solo saxophone im
provisations. Two things are
often said in reference to the
much praised Rollins: 1) His

recordings are only a pale in
dication of the excitement he
can generate in concert; 2) He
is perhaps the only saxophonist
who sounds just as good
playing by himself as with a
group.
Monday's performance
lends credence to both these
claims. When Rollins plays
alone, his music becomes a
free association of familiar
motifs and improvisational in
tricacy. Rollins prancedaround
the stage, blaring out his horn
in a delightful stream-of-con
sciousness manner. He im
provised fancifully, meanwhile
quoting a myriad of songs —
"On the Trail," "I've Got it Bad
and That Ain't Good,"
"Autumn Nocturne," "A Shave
and a Haircut," and even, quite
unseasonably, "Joy to the
World," — and then danced
off stage as swiftly as he had
come on.
The second half of the eve
ning's performance lacked the
tight structure of the first half,
but was still noteworthy for
several fine moments. The
young trumpeter Wynton
Marsalis demonstrated his full
bodied, bugle-boy tone, when
he shared a set with Wayne
Shorter. Shorter, a man much
admired in jazz circles, has not
impressed me in recent years,
and on this occasion, when he
had to follow Sonny Rollins, his
playing struck me as being par
ticularly empty. If Rollins
playing was a stream-of-con
sciousness, one only got i
trickle from Shorter. To make
matters worse, Shorter woulc
interrupt Marsalis's attractive
solos with gratuitous notes.
Marsalis was in a playfu
mood throughout the evening
despite the foreboding ap
pearance of his nicely tailore<
suit. While stating the melod
of Tony William's thin-tinge*
composition "Sister Cheryl,'
Marsalis took the melod
which is written as:

and played it every time:

lingering on the highly disso
nant b flat, which clashes
against the A major chord in
the bass. Despite quirks like
this, Marsalis played beau
tifully on William's composi
tion, and showed the more in
rospective side of his im
provisational talent.
A more hectic Marsalis blew
over a fast paced tune based on
the chord changes to "I've Got
Rhythm"; here Shorter con
tributed his finest playing of
the night, but was still no match
for the fiery Marsalis.
But saxophone fans, on the
whole saw an exciting evening.
In addition to Rollins and
Shorter, Lew Tabackin per
forned a tribute to Don Byas
(another master of Adolphe
Saxe's fine invention) based on
the chord changes to the song
"Indiana." Tabackin, like Roll
ins, combines his playing with
intriguing footwork; but while
Rollins struts, Tabackin seems
to be doing some sort of in
genious stretching exercise.
One would be distracted from
the music, if it wasn't for
Tabackin's superlative playing.
Tabackin also showed off his
flute playing, in a duet with his
wife Toshiko Akiyoshi. This
piece idulged in too much
flowery romanticism for my
taste, but as its best moments
sounded reminiscent of the
popular piano/flute works
composed by Claude Boiling.
This fine evening of jazz
stretched out into a fine night
of jazz. The audience which
seated itself around 7:30 on
Monday evening, found it was
Tuesday already by the time
they left. But the long per
formance was inevitable with
this combination of talent.
Most jazz afficionados would
anticipate having to go to Fan
tasy Island for a show such as
this one; fortunately for those
jazz buffs in the Bay Area, it was
only in their backyard.
