### Mary Walp Swan Lake American Ballet Theatre/S.F. Opera House 
American Ballet Theatre brought a
'magical and shining Swan Lake to
|the Opera House Friday night. With
'the exception of a little shaky danc
* ing in the first act, everything was ex-
quisite, from the lighting and sets to
Susan Jaffe as Odette-Odile and Pa
trick Bissel as Prince Siegfried.
The sloppy corps which opened
Act I seemed to be not so much the
fault of the dancers but that of the
-orchestra. From the way they were
"dancing it appeared that the or
chestra was playing much slower
than the dancers were used to, con
sequently forcing their timing off. By
the time the curtain raised for Act II

things had improved immensely and
the spell of the lake scene was
created by a flock of sparkling white
swans. Fluttering arms, tight
bourees, and precision completed
the enchanted lake and forest where
Odette, Siegfried's beloved, makes
her first appearance.
Jaffe's Odette is delicate and
frightened. Birdlike, she timidly
dances with the gallant Bissel, who
supports her as the strong gentle
prince, gradually calming the ner
vous Odette.
The transformation from Odette
to Odile for Act 111 was easily carried
off by Jaffe. She.appeared on stage
with the sorcerer, von Rothbart,
ready to decieve the love-stricken
Siegfried. Bissel naively remained

the devoted prince, supporting the
evil Odile who he mistakenly be
lieves is Odette. Jaffe led him on with
coy and flirtatious dancing, occa
sionally turning to Rothbart for ad
vice. Jaffe skillfully included the au
, dience in the conspiracy — a whis
per to Rothbart and a smirk thrown
to the audience before she dances
with poor Siegfried who is the only
one left out of the plot.
Then in Act IV, with Jaffe as Odette
once again and Siegfried now aware
of his mistake, the two lovers ap
peared distraught and helpless. The
acting and dancing of both Jaffe and
Bissel was done so convincingly, es
pecially Jaffe's handling of the
double character of Odette-Odile,
that even though she didn't quite

finish the famous 32 fouettes of Act
111, it didn't really matter.
All of the acting, which is so essen
tial to Swan Lake, was excellent on
Friday. The necessary amount of
melodrama was present without
ever being overdone. Frank Smith as
the wicked von Rothbart was espe
cially bewitching. Cunning and
malevolent, he contrasted Bissel's
princely Siegfried and com
plimented Jaffe's dangerous Odile
perfectly.
Not only did the swans of the lake
dance beautifully, but the corps also
brought a refreshing snap to Act 111
through the Spanish and Russian
character dances. Their energy and
technique atoned for the embarrass
ingly sloppy first act.
