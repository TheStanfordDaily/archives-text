# Zeta Psi jogathon deemed violation
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
A jogathon sponsored by the sus
pended chapter of the Zeta Psi
fraternity Sunday at Angell Field was
in violation of University policy, de
spite its charitable design that netted
almost $1000 for a local physical ther
apy swimming program.
Organizations which do not have
official University recognition can
not use LJniversity facilities forevents
or meetings, according to james
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
"When the Zetes lost their recog
nition (last Oct. 30), they lost access
to University facilities," he said.
But administrators say they re
ceived word of the jogathon too late
to stop the event. Norman Robinson,
associate dean for residential educa
tion, said he was unaware of the
event until the fliers were distributed
and the newspaper advertising
placed.
"We just found out too late," said
Robinson, ". . . though I hate to look
like I'm anti-aiding worthy causes."
Robinson said the fraternity should

have been told they could not use
the field to sponsor a fraternity event,
but members of the Athletic Depart
ment who are responsible for allocat
ing facilities may not have known of
the restriction placed on un
recognized groups.
The Doily has since been told that
Robinson was notified of the
jogathon last Tuesday, after fraternity
plans had been finalized but before
the advertisement for the run ap
peared in the Daily.
Daily sources said Robinson al
lowed the run because it was for a
charitable event, but said he would
deny knowledge of the event if
asked, for fear of angering the six un
recognized sororities and any other
unrecognized organizations on cam
pus.
When questioned, Robinson did
not deny that Zeta Psi members had
come to discuss the matter with him
last Tuesday, but denied the allega
tion that he would not admit to
knowledge of the event for fear of
angering unrecognized groups.
