# Library staff expresses job frustrations

A recent survey of Stanford University Libraries
(SUL) staff which found that there is widespread
dissatisfaction with communication in the librar
ies' "organizational hierarchy" has drawn mixed
reactions from the workers whose attitudes it
sought to document.
The 28-page report, co-authored by independ
ent consultants Alice Handley-lsaksen and Nancy
Roberts, suggested that while staff members were
positive about interaction with co-workers, they
felt negatively about the hierarchical structure of
decision-making, interaction with superiors and
grievance procedures.
The survey report itself, and the plans for its
future use, have met with varied reactior among
library staff members, many of whom have beer*
outspoken in their criticism of the study.
Lise Giraud, who has been with the libraries for
24 years, suggested the real problem in the librar
ies is that University Libraries Director David
Weber's administration is an "authoritarian, un
compromising regime."
"There is a tacit understanding among most
people in the library that the only possibility for
change is the total replacement of our top man
agement," Giraud said. "But the feeling is that this
is unthinkable."
In response to criticism of his managerial style
Weber said that "as is to be expected there are
complaints in some units."
"I'm aware that there are a variety of styles
within the library. One of the things that makes it
such a good library is various men and women with
diverse backgrounds." he said.
Handley-lsaksen, who worked with Roberts and
a fiver-member task force to conduct the survey last
July, said the library administration decided to un

dertake the study a year-and-a-half ago out of
"concern for a morale problem" among its em
ployees.
University Ombudsman John Goheen said he
has heard a number of grievances made by library
staff. "It's been largely a matter of communica
tion," Goheen said, "from the bottom up."
Keith Smith, an assistant provost who hears oc
casional grievances from library personnel, said
one of the problems he sees in the libraries is that
people are "well-educated, very bright and
capable, and could feel under-employed" as a re
sult of organizational structure.
"I hear it in the wind," Smith said, "that people
are frustrated and unhappy."
The administration plans to use the survey re
sults as a "spring-board" in the next phase of the
study, which begins this week. Staff members will
meet in groups of 10 to discuss problems in what
Personnel Director Carolyn Henderson called
"the interactive method."
Many staff members have voiced skepticism that
the survey and the administration's "interactive
method" of discussion groups will provide solu
tions to the library's problems.
"I think they're holding out false hopes through
this survey," said George Esenwein, who has been
a support staff member for four years. "The pre
tense is that we have some sort of democratic proc
ess here when in fact we have no power at all."
Ghaida Firestone, a 14-year veteran of the library
system, expressed optimism regarding the survey.
"I feel this is an honest attempt to remedy the situ
ation," she said.
Weber was also optimistic. "I intend it to be a
very constructive process that will benefit the or
ganization and the individuals involved," he said.
Several staff members pointed out that a similar
study was done just four years ago when a special

commission was formed to examine organiza
tional structure in the library, and that this pro
duced no discernable results.
"They spent a lot of time and came out with rec
ommendations," Esenwein said, "and then noth
ing came of it."
One librarian, a supervisor who asked that her
name not be used, said discussion groups are
bound to fail because most staff will be afraid to
speak up about problems for fear they will be
marked as troublemakers.
"There's an underground blacklist," she said,
"and people are terrified that they'll get on it."
When asked about the legitimacy of such fears,
Henderson said, "I think what's happening is that
everybody, including myself and the directors, has
some inner fear of reprimand."
Henderson said methods for the discussion
groups have been designed to avoid personal is
sues. "We're trying to focus on the problems
themselves," she said, "and eliminate the threat of
reprimand."
"We tried to work within the hierarchical sys
tem," Henderson said, "but for some reason it
wasn't working."
Several staff members criticized the way the fin
dings of the survey were presented in the report.
"The way the information is being disseminated
is unclear to a lot of people," said Bob
Levenhagen, a member of the support staff.
Data in the report are presented in terms of
"mean" and "standard deviation" for responses to
clusters of questions, rather than in percentages
for responses to each particular question.
Handley-lsaksen said she and Roberts mistaken
ly assumed most of the library staff would have a
better understanding of statistical methods when
they wrote the report.
