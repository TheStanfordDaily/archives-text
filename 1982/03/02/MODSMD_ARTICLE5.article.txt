# Richard Allen speaks; defends Reagan's policies
## Former U.S.security advisor criticizes press in interview

1982, The Stanford Daily
by Douglas Jehl

Richard Allen, former national
security adviser to President
Ronald Reagan, yesterday exuded
loyalty to the Reagan adminis
tration and blamed the press for
the inflation into a national scan
dal of a government investigation
of his personal conduct involving
the handling of gifts.
"There were no allegations,
there were no charges," Allen
told the Daily in an exclusive in
terview yesterday."The only al
legations and charges were those
that were generated by the press
in their own minds." He com
plained that investigative bodies
appointed to investigate Allen's
alleged misconduct were forced
to respond to allegations brought
only by the press.
He said his decision to place
himself and his staff off limits re
sulted in a "substantial amount of
dissatisfaction" among the press
and may have been the reason
why the press treated the incident
the way it did.
Allen also said that reports of a
personal animosity between him
and Secretary of State Alexander
Haig were "by and large the in
vention of the media," and said
that while there were obvious dif
ferences of view on matters per

taining to policy, there was never
any personality conflict.
The numerous reports of in
fighting and conflicts within the
Reagan administration, Allen said,
"are in large measure baloney."
"It has come to a point where
the press is willing to print any
thing," Allen said. He added that
he thought the press should never
print leaks or materials that are
sensitive or classified, and that in
stances like the recent printing of
Haig's notes from a private staff
meeting are a "totally unwar
ranted invasion of privacy."
A senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution from 1966 to 1968, Al
len came to the University yester
day to attend a private luncheon
in his honor and to deliver a lec
ture sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau.
Allen resigned from his admin
istration post in early January after
taking a leave of absence Nov. 29
to allow the Justice Department to
complete its investigation. Al
though he was exonerated of any
wrongdoing, Allen never re
turned to his position.
Although it has been widely re
ported that other Reagan aides
had used the scandal as a way to
get rid of Allen, Allen said he has
retained no hard feelings. "You

could say that I don't feel with the
same level of intensity about ev
eryone in the administration, but
after all, who does feel that way?"
"I came on to serve the presi
dent," Allen said. "He was truly
the only constituency whose polit
ical future I was interested in."
Allen denied that his resigna
tion from the administration, as
well as that of Hoover Senior Fel
low Martin Anderson this Febru
ary, represent any indication that
the influence of the institution is
waning in Washington."The pres
ident is deeply committed to the
implementation of his mandate,"
Allen said, "and that mandate is
one which people who I have
known to be associated with the
Hoover Institution feel very com
fortable."
Allen said that the public —
whose vision is developed by the

press — too often views policy de
cisions as battles between actors
like Haig and Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger. In the pres
ent administration, the president
always makes the final decision,
Allen said. He said that their role is
merely to advise the president.
There should be no hard feel
ings among cabinet officers if the*
president doesn't support your
proposal, Allen said. "If you lose,
you lose . . . what you think is to
tally irrelevant."
Allen, who currently works
"about a day-and-a-half a week"
at the Heritage Foundation, a con
servative institution in Washing
ton D.C., said he was pleased to
come back to Hoover and see his
old colleagues. He has already de
livered speeches at other univer
sities this winter.
