# Allen calls hostage release Reagan's 'first achievement'
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
To a chorus of hisses from the
audience, Richard Allen, former
national security adviser, yester
day called the return of the Amer
ican hostages from Iran "the first
significant achievement of the
Reagan administration."
The proclamation came as part
of an attack of foreign policy un
der the Carter administration, as
Allen defended the Reagan for
eign policy and offered an agenda
for it in a speech to an overflow
crowd of 400 in Bishop
Auditorium.
In an interview afterwards, Al
len said that he considered the re
turn of the hostages to be a Rea
gan administration achievement
because the Iranians were so un
certain about what would happen
once President Ronald Reagan
was inaugurated that they were
driven to release the hostages
rather than chance possible re
taliation.
He also said that Reagan and
former President Jimmy Carter
aides had worked "hand-in
glove" during the interim be
tween the election and the in
auguration to negotiate the re
lease, and that intelligence
sources had informed him that the
Iranians were unlikely to release

the hostages before the inaugura
tion for fear that Reagan might re
nege on any deals established.
After many in the crowd re
sponded negatively to his claim,
Allen reminded them of a warning
he had given earlier. He had re
lated an anecdote about deliver
ing an address before an audience
in a mental hospital. Allen said
that after a man in the back of the
hospital auditorium had rudely
criticized him three times, he
looked to the director of the hos
pital for help. The directortold Al
len: "That man's been here for 10
years and that's the first intelligent
thing he's ever said."
Here at Stanford, Allen warned,
"If I hear any more hisses, the
comparison I shall make (to the
mental hospital) back in Washing
ton shall be more graphic."
Allen's speech was sponsored
by the ASSU Speakers Bureau, al
though he charged no fee for the
appearance.
Allen defended the Reagan ad
ministration's concern with the
nuclear arms balance and cited
the Cuban missile crisis as an ex
ample of its benefits. "The os
tensible success of the resolution
of the crisis came because of
American nuclear superority," he
said Hp rallpd Snvipt military/
build-up that followed the crisis
"the most important in the history
of mankind."
Allen said that the United States
should not view that accumula
tion of weaponry as if the Soviets
planned to make an unprovoked,
pre-emptive attack on the United
States, but rather as an attempt to
achieve leverage. "The Soviet
Union does indeed seek to
achieve respect for its objectives,"
particularly among U.S. allies in
Western Europe, he said.
The most important challenge
on the agenda for the Reagan for
eign policy, Allen said, will be to
strengthen the NATO alliance. He
emphasized West Germany,
where, he said, there is increasing
pacifistic and neutralist thought.
In the future, Allen said, "West
Germany will be called upon to
declare herselfasa memberofthe
NATO alliance or not."
He predicted that the United
States would seek to gain in
fluence over moderates like Saudi
Arabia and Oman in the Mideast
and said that the Reagan adminis
tration would continue tosupport
the process of change in Latin
America, giving the people the
right to decide their future. "That
is why President Reagan supports
the notion of elections in El
Salvador however imperfect . . .
they may be." ,
