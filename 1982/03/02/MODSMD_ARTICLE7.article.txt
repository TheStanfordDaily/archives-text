## Grand planet alignment unlikely 
### Kristen Christopher 
The solar system's nine
planets will be closer to
gether March 10 than they
have been since the late
1400s, but scientists are not
worried about a 1974 pre
diction that they will line up
in a row and cause a dis
asterous earthquake in Los
Angeles.
According to National
Geographic sources,
astronomer Leßoy Doggett
of the U.S. Naval Ob
servatory said,"As far as we
know there's never been
such a 'Grand Alignment'
and probably never will be.
Studies of planetary motion
over millions of years have
not uncovered a time when

the planets would ever be in
a straight line or even close.
The lupiter Effect by John
Gribben presented the
troublesome prediction in
1974, but there is actually no
scientific evidence that the
gravitational attractions be
tween the planets is con
nected with earthquake ac
tivity. Scientists do know
that planet alignments af
fect tidal patterns on Earth,
but not significantly.
Planets are brought into
alignment through normal
celestial movements. The
planets cyclically pass each
other as they move around
the sun at different rates.
The varying rates depend on
a planet's distance from the

sun — the closer it is, the
shorter its circling time.
Mercury, the closest planet,
circles the sun in 88 days,
while Pluto, the outermost
planet, takes 248 years.
While the eight inner
planets come into rough
alignment every 179 years,
Pluto is generally excluded
because of its long circling
time.
Even though the planets
will not be as close together
for another 500 years,
March 10 should be a day
without disaster for Los An
geles residents. The Naval
Observatory in Washington,
D.C. plans to have a routine
day, charting planetary
movements as usual.
