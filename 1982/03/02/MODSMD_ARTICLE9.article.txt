The planning department here will in
vestigate the possibility of using a
cogeneration facility as a means of reduc
ing today's large energy bills.
"Cogeneration is simply the use of a sin
gle fuel to simultaneously generate elec
tricity and steam," said Jack Barkle,
cogenerational facility project manager.
Presently, the campus' energy needs are
met by two separate sources. Four steam
generators on campus generate steam for
heating and cooling, while essentially all of
the electrical needs are supplied by Pacific
Gas and Electric (PG&E).
"If we were to install a technology in a
cogeneration facility that uses a single fuel
and generates both electricity and steam,
we could use less fuel than is now used in
the two facilities, PG&E, and the University
steam plant," said Barkle. "This is the ben
efit gained by cogeneration."
One of the simplest examples of
cogeneration is use of a gas turbine, a sys
tem similar to a jet engine. Energy is used
to produce gas vapor or high pressure
steam which turns the turbine, in turn driv
ing an electric generator. Waste heat from
this process, similar to exhaust from a jet
engine, is supplied to a waste heat boiler
which boils water and generates steam.
The planning department is looking into
a wide variety of technologies more com
plex than this simple example. "We are
looking at combinations of equipment
that are commercially available to produce

the best overall arrangement and most ef
ficient power plant for our particular con
ditions," said Barkle.
On Feb. 1, the Planning Department re
tained Kaiser Engineers to work with them
in studying the feasibility of differentavail
able options. This feasibility study will ex
amine primarily the economics of building
a cogeneration plant, although matters of
reliability, maintainance, and efficiency
will also be considered.
There are no results to talk about yet, ac
cording to Barkle. "We expect to go to the
board of trustees with a recommendation
in October," he said. "If accepted, we
would expect to move immediately into
design and construction of such a facility."
Barkle said he would expect it to be in
operation by 1985, but no figures were
available regarding the possible cost of
such a project, as it is highly dependent on
the capacity of the plant.
Although the use of cogeneration on
college campuses is not unprecedented
(Harvard University, University of Texas,
and UC-Davis are involved in cogenera
tion programs), "we are taking a leading
roie in it," said Barkle.
While the technology necessary for
cogeneration facilities is well-known and
readily available, its actual use largely de
pends upon decisions made in the political
process. Even though cogeneration facil
ities assume most of the role of the power
company in supplying energy needs, the
facilities remain somewhat dependent on

the power company.
It is needed as a supplier of electricity
during periods of high energy consump
tion and as a buyer of electricity in the
event of surplus production. Government
intervention in the form of regulatory leg
islation has been necessary to maintain a
workable relationship between the two in
terests.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Com
mission (FERC) established some ground
rules which required utility companies to
interact with cogeneration facilities, and
also to buy energy from them at marginal
cost. However, the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Washington, D.C. invalidated
these FERC rules on Jan. 22, as a result of a
suit filed by three utilities in the East.
"We don't know where we are going as
far as federal legislation is concerned,"
said Barkle.
However, the State of California Public
Utilities Commission issued an order on
Jan. 21 which "in essence instructs regu
lated utilities in California, within 45 days,
to submit proposed rates for buying
energy from cogenerators," according to
Barkle.
"Everyone looks on it as favorable to
both cogenerators and utilities," he said.
"Utilities avoid having to build new capaci
ty at an extremely high cost in poor finan
cial situations" since cogenerators are sup
plying them with surplus electricity, and
cogenerators receive steam and electricity
at lower cost.
