# ASSU fee assessment proposal tabled
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate last night tabled a constitu
tional amendment to reform the fee assessment
system after deciding that the amendment lacked
the number of votes necessary for approval.
In order to be placed before the student body
for ratification, a proposed amendment must be
approved by two-thirds of the senate, which trans
lates into 14 votes. After an hour and a half of de
bate, only 14 senators remained at the meeting,
and a few of them were plainly opposed to the
amendment.
Rules Committee Chair Jim McGrath said he
would introduce the proposed amendment again
at the special senate meeting next Tuesday. If it still
does not pass, he said he may attempt to get the
amendment on the spring ballot by student peti
tion.
McGrath said it is important to allow the student
body to vote on the reforms. "This is a good sys
tem, it seems to address most of the points, and I
think we should allow the student body to decide
this question," he said.
The proposed amendment would provide fee
assessment refunds only to students who voted in
the election in which the assessments were author
ized. But some senators opposed the refundable
aspect of the reform program, especially the re
fundability of a $3 "association fee" that would
support small student groups.

"I don't think that refunds are this big privilege
we have to give to the students," said Senator Bam
bi Markel. "I think we should figure out how to
fund these groups, not how the students can take
this funding away."
But McGrath said the refunds were established
so that students wouldn't have to support groups
to which they were "radically opposed."
"Refunds are put in there so if you really, really
felt strongly against a group, you wouldn't have to
support it,"he said.
Senator Andy Benn said he disagreed with the
fact that the refund only applied to students who
had voted in the assessment election.
"If the fee is non-bindingforone member of the
Association, it should be just as non-binding for
any other member of the Association," Benn said.
"I don't think that's at all fair, just or right."
However, Senator Rod Beckstrom said such a
non-refundable system would never attain the ap
proval of two-thirds of the voting student body
that is necessary for ratification.
"I think a mandatory assessment would be the
most simple program, the most efficacious, that we
could establish — but it's absurd," he said. "The
students will not approve it."
Senator Marty Roberts introduced a motion to
make the association fee of $3 levied for the sup
port of small groups non-refundable.
The motion did not pass, however, because most
senators thought that it was important to ensure

that students were not forced to support groups
they opposed.
"People should have the right to say 'I don't sup
port these small groups,' " McGrath said.
In addition to limiting refunds only to voting stu
dents and instituting the association fee, the pro
posed amendment would reform the present sys
tem by making it harder for student groups desir
ing fee assessment money to get on the assessment
ballot.
The senate did agree to place three other con
stitutional amendments on the spring ballot. If ap
proved by the student body, these amendments
would improve the efficiency of the Nominations
Commission, provide for a smoother transition be
tween successive terms of the senate and Council
of Presidents (COP), and allow for the disposition
of assets in the event of the dissolution of the
ASSU.
The senate also approved a resolution proposed
by the Student Affairs Committee that will estab
lish a student books/items exchange. The ex
change will enable students to buy and sell used
books, bikes, and household items beginning late
next quarter in White Plaza.
The special order of the meeting was the annual
meeting of the Coffee House stockholders. Chris
Greene, Coffee House president and COP mem
ber, informed the senate of the present financial
state of the Coffee House and talked about future
improvements it is considering.

the election in which the assessments were author
ized. But some senators opposed the refundable
aspect of the reform program, especially the re
fundability of a $3 "association fee" that would
support small student groups.

"I don't think that refunds are this big privilege
we have to give to the students," said Senator Bam
bi Markel. "I think we should figure out how to
fund these groups, not how the students can take
this funding away."
But McGrath said the refunds were established
so that students wouldn't have to support groups
to which they were "radically opposed."
"Refunds are put in there so if you really, really
felt strongly against a group, you wouldn't have to
support it,"he said.
Senator Andy Benn said he disagreed with the
fact that the refund only applied to students who
had voted in the assessment election.
"If the fee is non-bindingforone member of the
Association, it should be just as non-binding for
any other member of the Association," Benn said.
"I don't think that's at all fair, just or right."
However, Senator Rod Beckstrom said such a
non-refundable system would never attain the ap
proval of two-thirds of the voting student body
that is necessary for ratification.
"I think a mandatory assessment would be the
most simple program, the most efficacious, that we
could establish — but it's absurd," he said. "The
students will not approve it."
Senator Marty Roberts introduced a motion to
make the association fee of $3 levied for the sup
port of small groups non-refundable.
The motion did not pass, however, because most
senators thought that it was important to ensure

that students were not forced to support groups
they opposed.
"People should have the right to say 'I don't sup
port these small groups,' " McGrath said.
In addition to limiting refunds only to voting stu
dents and instituting the association fee, the pro
posed amendment would reform the present sys
tem by making it harder for student groups desir
ing fee assessment money to get on the assessment
ballot.
The senate did agree to place three other con
stitutional amendments on the spring ballot. If ap
proved by the student body, these amendments
would improve the efficiency of the Nominations
Commission, provide for a smoother transition be
tween successive terms of the senate and Council
of Presidents (COP), and allow for the disposition
of assets in the event of the dissolution of the
ASSU.
The senate also approved a resolution proposed
by the Student Affairs Committee that will estab
lish a student books/items exchange. The ex
change will enable students to buy and sell used
books, bikes, and household items beginning late
next quarter in White Plaza.
The special order of the meeting was the annual
meeting of the Coffee House stockholders. Chris
Greene, Coffee House president and COP mem
ber, informed the senate of the present financial
state of the Coffee House and talked about future
improvements it is considering.
