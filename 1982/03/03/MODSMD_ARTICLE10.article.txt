The state of Delaware was once a Swedish
colony. Early Russian settlements in the Unit
ed States penetrated as far as Fort Ross, Calif.
In years past, California was spelled with a
"K" and was believed to be an island sepa
rated by the Gulf of California from the rest of
America.
So say many of the maps in the special col
lections exhibit of rare and beautiful maps
showing through April 15 in Greene Library.
The maps are dated from as early as 1587 to
1856, said Charles Tanenbaum, a long time
fancier and collector of cartographs,(maps
and charts) who volunteered to aid the spe
cial collections staff in preparing the exhibit.
"The maps are being used to tell a story
about how the U.S. continent grew as a whole
and not from east to west," explained Tanen
baum. "You can almost open a dialogue with
them."
"The concept of having an exhibit coordi
nated to tell a story rather than having the
itmes randomly placed is rare," said exhibit
coordinator Fred Cheever.
A colorful story is painted by these his
torical documents whose titles are sur
rounded by ornate decoration. "This is be
cause they were the coffee table books of the
period," said Tanenbaum. The maps were
printed in black and white and then colored
by hand, he said.
The early maps show California as an island.
The error lasted for about 100 years and re
flects how errors perpetuate in this art,
Tanenbaum explained.
The maps show the earliest permanent set
tlements, which were Spanish, surging from
the southeast. Anda French mapdated 1650 is
one of the earliest maps depicting the Great
Lakes.
Waterways used for French trading and ex
ploring are also pictured in the map. A closer
look reveals a fascinating depiction of the Rio
Grande emptying into the gulf of which Cali
fornia was an island.
Cheever said the maps "always attempt to
make order out of what is really confusion."
He added that the maps look crowded when
indeed there was much unsettled land.
According to Cheever the English would
actually settle where other countries just
claimed land because until actual settlements

were established the territory couldn't really
be claimed.
A map dated 1753, one of the first which
shows California as a part of the U.S. conti
nent, is a sea map and includes both the Pacif
ic and Atlantic Oceans. Hawaii is non-exis
tant. California is claimed by both the English
and the Spanish and bears names from both
countries. Other maps show the pressure
from the English heading south, the Spanish
heading north and later the Americans head
ing east — all to settle the west.
A depiction of the Louisiana Purchase high
lights the magnitude of the arrangement, ac
cording to Tanenbaum. The purchase bought
12 of today's states.
Tanenbaum said his favorite is a large map
by John Melish dated 1820. "Melish was one
of the first cartographers with a continental
vision," said Tanenbaum. Here California is in
full scale, undwarfed and not drawn in an in
set.
Other maps depict the development of
some state borders. The record of Texas'
struggle for independence was according to
Tanenbaum the beginning of "dynamic de
velopments" such as the concept of manifest
destiny. Still another map showed the revised
borders that came from the peace treaty of
the Mexican-American War and yet another
viewed the established borders, via the
Gadsden Purchase, of the continental United
States as known today.
Route maps explaining how to get to Cali
fornia and railroad maps are also on display.
One of the particularly noteworthy maps
on display is an anti-slave map used by Re
publican abolitionists."lt was a political pro
poganda tool," said Tanenbaum. In it the
United States is distorted so that the South ap
pears to be overwhelming the North. The
purpose of the distortion was to scare citizens
into thinking slavery was rampant. Centered
at the top of the map is a picture of George
Washington, flanked by the then current
nominees for president and vice-president.
The maps, most of which are from atlases,
are on loan from a U.C.-Berkeley library,
Greene Library's own special collections,
Margaret Sowers, another volunteer, and
Tanenbaum himself. "This is a team effort of
many organizations and individuals," said
Tanenbaum.

CALIFORNIA ISLAND? — One of the many rare maps currently on display in
Greene Library, this map mistakenly pictures California as floating in the Pacific. Or
did its maker know about the predicted earthquake?
Hjstorical maps
The state of Delaware was once a Swedish
colony. Early Russian settlements in the Unit
ed States penetrated as far as Fort Ross, Calif.
In years past, California was spelled with a
"K" and was believed to be an island sepa
rated by the Gulf of California from the rest of
America.
So say many of the maps in the special col
lections exhibit of rare and beautiful maps
showing through April 15 in Greene Library.
The maps are dated from as early as 1587 to
1856, said Charles Tanenbaum, a long time
fancier and collector of cartographs,(maps
and charts) who volunteered to aid the spe
cial collections staff in preparing the exhibit.
"The maps are being used to tell a story
about how the U.S. continent grew as a whole
and not from east to west," explained Tanen
baum. "You can almost open a dialogue with
them."
"The concept of having an exhibit coordi
nated to tell a story rather than having the
itmes randomly placed is rare," said exhibit
coordinator Fred Cheever.
A colorful story is painted by these his
torical documents whose titles are sur
rounded by ornate decoration. "This is be
cause they were the coffee table books of the
period," said Tanenbaum. The maps were
printed in black and white and then colored
by hand, he said.
The early maps show California as an island.
The error lasted for about 100 years and re
flects how errors perpetuate in this art,
Tanenbaum explained.
The maps show the earliest permanent set
tlements, which were Spanish, surging from
the southeast. Anda French mapdated 1650 is
one of the earliest maps depicting the Great
Lakes.
Waterways used for French trading and ex
ploring are also pictured in the map. A closer
look reveals a fascinating depiction of the Rio
Grande emptying into the gulf of which Cali
fornia was an island.
Cheever said the maps "always attempt to
make order out of what is really confusion."
He added that the maps look crowded when
indeed there was much unsettled land.
According to Cheever the English would
actually settle where other countries just
claimed land because until actual settlements

were established the territory couldn't really
be claimed.
A map dated 1753, one of the first which
shows California as a part of the U.S. conti
nent, is a sea map and includes both the Pacif
ic and Atlantic Oceans. Hawaii is non-exis
tant. California is claimed by both the English
and the Spanish and bears names from both
countries. Other maps show the pressure
from the English heading south, the Spanish
heading north and later the Americans head
ing east — all to settle the west.
A depiction of the Louisiana Purchase high
lights the magnitude of the arrangement, ac
cording to Tanenbaum. The purchase bought
12 of today's states.
Tanenbaum said his favorite is a large map
by John Melish dated 1820. "Melish was one
of the first cartographers with a continental
vision," said Tanenbaum. Here California is in
full scale, undwarfed and not drawn in an in
set.
Other maps depict the development of
some state borders. The record of Texas'
struggle for independence was according to
Tanenbaum the beginning of "dynamic de
velopments" such as the concept of manifest
destiny. Still another map showed the revised
borders that came from the peace treaty of
the Mexican-American War and yet another
viewed the established borders, via the
Gadsden Purchase, of the continental United
States as known today.
Route maps explaining how to get to Cali
fornia and railroad maps are also on display.
One of the particularly noteworthy maps
on display is an anti-slave map used by Re
publican abolitionists."lt was a political pro
poganda tool," said Tanenbaum. In it the
United States is distorted so that the South ap
pears to be overwhelming the North. The
purpose of the distortion was to scare citizens
into thinking slavery was rampant. Centered
at the top of the map is a picture of George
Washington, flanked by the then current
nominees for president and vice-president.
The maps, most of which are from atlases,
are on loan from a U.C.-Berkeley library,
Greene Library's own special collections,
Margaret Sowers, another volunteer, and
Tanenbaum himself. "This is a team effort of
many organizations and individuals," said
Tanenbaum.
