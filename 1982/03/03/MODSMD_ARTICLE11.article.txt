# Rental office helps find housing
## 
### Margi Bethke 
On the third floor of Old Union stu
dents and university employees will find
not only a large listing of houses, apart
ments and rooms for rent, hut will also dis
cover helpful information concerning off
campus life: where to go, what to do, and
how to get around.
"I've had seniors come in who didn't
even know that we existed," said June
Becker, supervisor of the Off-Campus
Rental Housing Service. "I think it's better
advertised off campus than on."
Becker attributed the Housing Office's
obscurity to the fact that most students
here live in university housingfortheirfirst
year or two, and thus don't think about the
problems of looking for an apartment and
taking on the responsibilities of a tenant.
Despite its relative anonymity, the Off-
Campus Rental Housing Office services an
average of 20 people a day. Its two person
staff is overworked trying to meet increas
ing demands.
In September, the Housing Office oper
ates the Clearinghouse, a temporary ex
tension of the Rental Housing Office. Dur
ing this time, the number of people using
the service expands between 100-200 daily.
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and director of the Stanford
Housing Center said Stanford attracts the
listings of many landlords because the uni
versity's 12,000 students, faculty and staff
are generally recognized as responsible

tenants.
"We don't have a thorough investigative
service (to inspect all the listings)" says
Whitney, "but we don't have many com
plaints by students about their landlords,
either." Becker added that the amount of
complaints the Housing receives averages
fewer than one or two a year, and usually
concern excessive deposits, discrimina
tion and violations of privacy.
"I am not qualified to be an arbitrator,"
said Becker. She does direct tenants to the
pertinant agencies, which may help the
tenant: the ASSU Legal Counseling Office,
the Rental Housing Mediation Task Force
or the Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing.
Becker said that in many cases landlords
become upset because they find out that
their tenants are not Stanford students, but
have in fact borrowed a friend's I.D. in or
der to take advantageof the listing service.
The aim of the Off-Campus Rental Hous
ing Service however, is not only to provide
listings. An equally important aim is to
educate members of the Stanford com
munity so that they "know what to expect
of a landlord, what questions to ask, and
what their responsibilities are."
This is accomplished through seminars
offered when the Clearinghouse is operat
ing. The Housing Office also plans to offer
a Spring Clearinghouse this year, designed
to help students set up housing for next fall
before they leave for the summer.

Though varying by individuals, off cam
pus students tend to spend less for food,
but this is often offset by higher rents and
transportation expenses.
For an unfurnished house with three
bedrooms and two baths, tenants may ex
pect to pay anywhere from $700 to $1500.
For a two bedroom apartment, un
furnished, rent may range from $450 to
$800. Furnished houses generally cost $40
to $70 more, while furnished apartments
run from $30 to $60 more per month.
Prices also vary according to neighbor
hood. In downtown Palo Alto, a two
bedroom apartment may start at about
$500, but in East Palo Alto a comparable
apartment will cost approximately $100
less.
In Menlo Park, along Alameda De Las
Pulgas, a tenant may pay $450 for a
furnished, one bedroom apartment, but
west of Ravenswood Avenue, a similar
apartment will go for around $300.
To aid off-campus dwellers, the Housing
Office will be publishing a 56-page guide
called "Life Off The Farm." The book,
available at the end of March, will provide
complete information about dealing with
utilities and transportation as well as sug
gestions for the best places to shop, ser
vices and programs in the communities
surrounding the University and tips on
recreation and entertainment in the Bay
Area.

Prices also vary according to neighbor
hood. In downtown Palo Alto, a two
bedroom apartment may start at about
$500, but in East Palo Alto a comparable
apartment will cost approximately $100
less.
In Menlo Park, along Alameda De Las
Pulgas, a tenant may pay $450 for a
furnished, one bedroom apartment, but
west of Ravenswood Avenue, a similar
apartment will go for around $300.
To aid off-campus dwellers, the Housing
Office will be publishing a 56-page guide
called "Life Off The Farm." The book,
available at the end of March, will provide
complete information about dealing with
utilities and transportation as well as sug
gestions for the best places to shop, ser
vices and programs in the communities
surrounding the University and tips on
recreation and entertainment in the Bay
Area.
On the third floor of Old Union stu
dents and university employees will find
not only a large listing of houses, apart
ments and rooms for rent, hut will also dis
cover helpful information concerning off
campus life: where to go, what to do, and
how to get around.
"I've had seniors come in who didn't
even know that we existed," said June
Becker, supervisor of the Off-Campus
Rental Housing Service. "I think it's better
advertised off campus than on."
Becker attributed the Housing Office's
obscurity to the fact that most students
here live in university housingfortheirfirst
year or two, and thus don't think about the
problems of looking for an apartment and
taking on the responsibilities of a tenant.
Despite its relative anonymity, the Off-
Campus Rental Housing Office services an
average of 20 people a day. Its two person
staff is overworked trying to meet increas
ing demands.
In September, the Housing Office oper
ates the Clearinghouse, a temporary ex
tension of the Rental Housing Office. Dur
ing this time, the number of people using
the service expands between 100-200 daily.
Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of stu
dent affairs and director of the Stanford
Housing Center said Stanford attracts the
listings of many landlords because the uni
versity's 12,000 students, faculty and staff
are generally recognized as responsible

tenants.
"We don't have a thorough investigative
service (to inspect all the listings)" says
Whitney, "but we don't have many com
plaints by students about their landlords,
either." Becker added that the amount of
complaints the Housing receives averages
fewer than one or two a year, and usually
concern excessive deposits, discrimina
tion and violations of privacy.
"I am not qualified to be an arbitrator,"
said Becker. She does direct tenants to the
pertinant agencies, which may help the
tenant: the ASSU Legal Counseling Office,
the Rental Housing Mediation Task Force
or the Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing.
Becker said that in many cases landlords
become upset because they find out that
their tenants are not Stanford students, but
have in fact borrowed a friend's I.D. in or
der to take advantageof the listing service.
The aim of the Off-Campus Rental Hous
ing Service however, is not only to provide
listings. An equally important aim is to
educate members of the Stanford com
munity so that they "know what to expect
of a landlord, what questions to ask, and
what their responsibilities are."
This is accomplished through seminars
offered when the Clearinghouse is operat
ing. The Housing Office also plans to offer
a Spring Clearinghouse this year, designed
to help students set up housing for next fall
before they leave for the summer.

Though varying by individuals, off cam
pus students tend to spend less for food,
but this is often offset by higher rents and
transportation expenses.
For an unfurnished house with three
bedrooms and two baths, tenants may ex
pect to pay anywhere from $700 to $1500.
For a two bedroom apartment, un
furnished, rent may range from $450 to
$800. Furnished houses generally cost $40
to $70 more, while furnished apartments
run from $30 to $60 more per month.
