## Editorial Meal plan: eat what you take 
### 
Every day one ton of University Food Service
leftovers gets carted to the Palo Alto dump,
according toan ASSU task force study.
"One ton of food wasted everyday?"
"How disgusting!"
"I can't believe it!"
"Gross!"
"Ready to go to the flicks?"
"Yeah, I can't finish this stuff, let's go."
Half-eaten trayfuls find their way to the
dishroom slop pails; students exit. It'sa
common scene. We were probably all pretty
shocked to hear that one ton of our Food
Service staples go daily to the Palo Alto dump,
but let's face it — habits are hard to break. A
habit like leaving food on your plate is especially
hard to give up when one can justify the action
by a slew of excuses:
The Economist:
"We pay outrageous prices for meal plans. If
we take lots of food and eat what we can, we're
just exercising ourownershipoption. We'll get
our money's worth."
The Consumer:
"Hashers dump too much on our plates. It's

notourfault ifwe can't eat it all."
The Dieter:
"I like to pick at my food. If I always eat less
than I take, I'll lose weight!"
The Picky Eater:
"It's hard totell thatthe food isgoing to taste
bad before you take it."
The Rationalizer:
"After all we only leavea little bit here, a little
bit there."
The overriding fact is that all the little bits add
up, and when they add up to the one ton of food
wastage daily, it's just too much. Director of
University Food Service Maxine Anderson,
estimates that 7-8 percent of food cost winds up
in wastage. Thirty-four dollars per meal is
wasted by the number of students who leave
one pat of butter on their plates.
Can we learn to ask a hasher for less? To come
back for seconds or grab dessert at the end of
the meal when we're sure we have room for it?
There seems to be moral, economicand even
dietetic (the extra trips to the counter may
expend a few calories) incentive for a change of
habit. Take what you want but eat what you take.
