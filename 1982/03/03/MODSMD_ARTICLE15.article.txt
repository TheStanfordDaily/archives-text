# Water, water everywhere...

California is on the verge of mak
ing a disastrous mistake. It's heart
ening to know we can prevent it and
frightening to realize we might not.
The choice will appear as Proposition
9 on the primary ballot in June.
Nine's passage would allow construc
tion of the Peripheral Canal, arguably
the most expensive, energy-drain
ing, environmentally disruptive and
unnecessary public project in Cali
fornia history.
Beginning at the town of Hood on
the lower Sacramento River, the
Canal would skirt the San Joa
quin/Sacramento Delta for 43 miles
before joining the California
Aqueduct west of Tracy. With a
depth of 30 feet and the width of a 13-
lane freeway, the ditch would be able
to carry a \arge ocean freighter, if
there were a profit. Instead it will
carry 16.3 million acre-feet (about 53
trillion gallons) of additional water

from Northern to Southern Califor
nia every year, doubling the current
water transfer.
The Metropolitan Water District
(MWD) of Los Angeles, which whole
sales water to six southern counties
and half the state's population, takes
a lordly view of the project. "The
people in the north have the im
pression that when they vote on
Prop. 9, the question will be whether
or not to divert water," said MWD
spokesman Jay Malinowski. "The
question is what's the best method to
divert water." He points out that
MWD's clientele, 12 million today,
will reach 15 million by the year 2000.
Now the MWD says that we have to
watch the Delta suffer. By cutting off
as much as 70 percent of the Sacra
mento's flow above the Delta, the
Canal could effectively extend the
Pacific Ocean well to the east of San
Francisco Bay; judging from the salt
water intrusion during the 1977
drought, full Canal diversion could
make Stockton a beach city.
Even more central to this dis
cussion is an essential fact about Cali
fornia water: 85 percent of it is used
for agriculture. And we're not talking
about old McDonald's farm here.

The rich central strip of California is
owned primarily by corporate con
glomerates.
Their names appear like a Fortune
500 roll-call at the top of the list of
Prop 9 contributors: Shell Oil
($30,000), Getty and Arco Oil ($25,000
each), Union Oil, Mobil Oil, Fluor
Corporation, Southern Pacific Rail
road, Knudson Corporation, and 25
others. The oil companies own 15
percent of the state-irrigated land in
Kern County, which has been prom
ised the largest share of new Canal
water.
California's water pricing schedule
still looks as if it were written in cor
porate boardrooms. Currently the
MWD pays the state about $150 per
acre-foot, retailing it to any comers
— mostly southland homeowners,
renters, and businesses — for more
than $200/a.f. Anything left after
metropolitan needs are met be
comes State Surplus Water, which
Kern County "farmers" buy for 53.50
per acre-foot.
Now, keep this rather remarkable
bargain in mind, and consider the
fact that Southern California will lose
1.3 million a.f. of its Colorado River

allotment beginning in 1985. Assum
ing that L.A.'s water consumption
holds steady or increases the loss will
have to be made up with MWD water
from existing state projects. Which
means that the supply of surplus wa
ter that the state virtually gives to
agricorporations will shrink by 1.3
million a.f. plusany rise in residential
consumption over present levels.
The corporations can respond to
thisnjnhappy turn of events in one of
three ways. First, they could bid
against city buyers for first rights to
the water, paying 40-50 times more
than they did under the "surplus" ar
rangement. Some might call this idea
naive, since corporations pass in
creased costs on to their customers
and San Joaquin growers have no in
tention of giving up their subsidies.
Second, they could replace flood
irrigation with drip irrigation, which
uses 1/3 to 2/3 less water. The con
version would cost some money, and
drip irrigation takes more main
tenance and supervision than just
pulling a gate and covering the land
with half a foot of water. In light of
how much water it would free up,
this conversation would be uniquely
economical. But, if it costs more than
$3.50/a.f., why should corporate
farmers want to carry it out?
The third alternative is the only
sound one from the business point of
view: sell Californians a new, im

proved water project that will keep
that "surplus" water, that water that
just happens to be left over after the
city users are done, flowing strong
for decades.
On the face of it, that might sound
like a tough sale. Prop 9 suggests that
we pay more than any state public
works project has ever cost for the
package that features the Canal. The
above-line construction cost is esti
mated at $10 billion. Whenpower fa
cilities for pumping the new water,
construction delays, inflation, in
terest rates, and support highways
are factored in, the total cost looks
more like $20-30 billion, which was
about the size of the whole state
budget in 1980.
But Canal promoters have a twice
proven strategy to use against these
grim figures. It accepts the fact that
northerners won't be wild to pay
through the nose for a project that
drains water to the south, that could
devastate the fisheries and farms of
the Delta, and that threatens the wild
North Coast river by bringing them
within range of a new southbound
delivery system. The strategy also re
members that northerners don't
have a hell of a lot to say about what
happens to California water. The
Feather River Project, backbone of
the state system, was brought to life
in 1960 by Proposition 1. Northern
Californians boted against Prop 1 by a
2-to-1 margin, but it carried state
wide. Northern opposition to the

huge dam project on the Stanislaus
River was even more lopsided in
1974, but guess what happened when
all the votes were counted?
So you won't hear much media
promotion of Prop 9 around these
parts. The MWD had already spent
$635,000 in public funds to convince
southland residents that the Canal is
all that stand between them and ter
minal thirst. The District
doesn't mention the fact that lining
existing canals against seepage
would yield several hundred
thousand acre-feet yearly for Los An
geles. It could also point out that a 10
percent cutback of current domestic
use would have the same effect, but it
doesn't. In fact the MWD spends less
than a dime on conservation educa
tion for every dollar it spends pro
moting new projects.
There are a few more facts that
don't reach MWD brochures. Ac
cording to Michael Storper of
Friends of the Earth, the District has
pledged L.A.'s allotment of northern
water to Kern County in the event of
a drought. "During the past ten
years," Storper goes on, "the people
of Southern California have sub
sidized Kern County to the tune of
$170 million worth of water." It looks
as if the losers in California's water
scam live in both halves of the state.
