## The
						Clean Air Act: speak now or forever hold your breath 
### 
Since its passage in 1971, the Clean
Air Act has been a major foundation
of environmental protection, reduc
ing dramatically several majorpollut
ants, including particulants, sulfur
oxides, carbon monoxide, and ni
trogen oxides. Although many areas
of the country have yet to attain
healthy air quality, the act has proven
very effective.
Last December, legislation was
proposed that would prevent the
achievement of healthful air, speed
up the destruction of lakes in the
United States and Canada by acid
rain and worsen air quality in areas
that are relatively clean. The Reagan
administration, the auto industry,
coal companies and utilities will all

rally around the new bill, H.R. 5252,
appropriately nicknamed the "Dirty
Air Bill."
The Reagan administration sup
ports the relaxation of clean air stan
dards in the interests of spurring eco
nomic growth. They feel the Clean
Ari Act must be adjusted to reflect
the economic realities faced by busi
nesses. Big business claims to spend
$16 billion a year to abide by environ
mental regulations — too high a
price.
So, if passed, H.R. 5252 would:
• Relax autoemission standards for
carbon monoxide from 3.4 grams per
mile to 7.0 grams per mile and double
allowable emissions of nitrogen ox
ides from 1.0 grams per mile to 2.0

grams per mile.
• Allow a 400 percent increase in air
pollution in 90 percent of the country
by eliminating provisions which pre
vent significant deterioration of air
quality in areas not yet polluted.
• Monitor only annual average air
pollution in national parks and wil
derness areas. This would quintruple
the number of days in which air qual
ity in those areas could exceed their
air pollution standards.
• Extend deadlines until 1987 for
protecting public health even in
cities not needing an extension, add
ing five years to the time the public
will breathe unhealthful air.
• Permit new pollution in the worst
polluted areas. The current law re-

quires that industries starting up in
areas dirtier than the standards allow,
reduce emissions elsewhere so as to
reduce total emissions in the area.
H.R. 5252 would eliminate this re
quirement. Such a requirement,
however, strikes a compromise be
tween health needs and industrial
expansion, while steadily improving
air quality.
• Sustain the acid rain and toxic
pollutant problem through inaction.
Sulfur emissions from power plants
have increased six-fold in the last 40
years, and the acidity of rain in the
Northeastern U.S. has increased 10-
fold. Hundreds of lakes in the U.S.
and Canada are lifeless because of
acid rain. Acid rain also leaches heavy

metals such as lead into water sup
plies, threatening public health.
Opponents of a strong Clean Air
Act charge that stringent pollution
controls are inconcistent with a
healthy, growing economy. How
ever, the facts don't support these
claims. First of all, auto emission reg
ulations have not seriously hurt the
American automobile industry. The
National Commission on Air Quality
concluded that factors such as in
terest rates, petroleum pricesand im
ports, and not pollution control re
quirements, are responsible for the
auto industry's problems.
The Clean Air Act does not cause
inflation. The National Commission
on Air Quality concluded: "The ef
fect of the Act's requirements on in
flation and GNP has not caused un
employment." The EPA concluded,
Jobs are created in the pollution
control industry and in all industries
to operate and maintain pollution
equipment and facilities. By 1987
there will be a net increase of 524,000
additional jobsasa result of pollution
controls."
But what is most significant is that
more than 80 percent of Americans

want the Clean Air Act protected or
strengthened (Harris Poll Survey,
Sept. 1981). Louis Harris himself said
this huge majority in favor of strong
pollution controls "is as clear-cut as
anything I have ever seen in my pro
fessional career." Elected represent
atives must get this basic message.
Congress must get this basic
message. Congress must be re
minded that the fight over the Clean
Air Act is a fight about public health
and the public's right to breathe
clean air.
According to a study done by the
National Croploss Assessment
Network, ozone (resulting from sun
light reacting with automative or in
dustrial waste) is causing at least a $10
billion loss per year from damaged
crops (San Francisco Chronicle Feb.
17). By reducing clean air standards,
the death toll from cancer, lung dis
ease, and heart attacks will increase,
especially in the large cities where
the air is dangerously polluted.
The Clean Air Act must remain in
its full strength, so speak now or for
ever hold your breath!
