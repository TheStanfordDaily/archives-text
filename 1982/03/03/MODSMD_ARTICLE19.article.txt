## Watt's in our wilderness? 
### 
James Watt's recent celebrated
proposal to ban until the end of the
century mining, oil and gas leases in
the nation's wilderness is a deceptive
political ploy with dangerous conse
quences for America's pristine wil
derness and roadless areas.
The Secretary of the Interior has
actually traded the permanent ban
on leasing and new mining claims in
wilderness (which would have gone
into effect on Jan. 1,1984, under the
1964 Wilderness Act) for a temporary
one. Under Watt's bill, America'sfew
remaining wilderness areas will be
open to drilling and mining 18 years
from now.
Watt's proposal also gives the ex
ecutive branch the power to exploit
fragile "wilderness study aras" that
have been set aside by the Bureau of
Land Management. The proposal sets
unjustifiably short deadlines for Con
gressional enactment of any new wil
derness. This would allow com
mercial interests the chance to stall
Congress and force study lands to
lapse into a non-wilderness status,
where they could be subject to drill
ing and mining.
The federal government has al
ready opened hundreds of millions
of acres of land to development,
much of which is being scarred
without yielding resources. In a re
cent study by Alfred Voelker of the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory, it
was estimated that only 3 percent of
the nation's undiscovered oil and 2

percent of its natural gas resources lie
under remaining wilderness. Despite
the obsession of Watt, it's simply not
worth breaching the natural beauty
and wonder of the last American wil
derness to get at scant energy re
serves.
