# Speakers favor 'environmentalist' version of Clean Air Act proposals
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
The former president of the California Coalition for
Clean Air said last night that while too little control over
air quality might expose the public to illness or death,
too much control might harm business or society in gen
eral.
"There are great uncertainties and great risks" in enac
ting such legislative controls, Dr. Thomas English said.
Both English and William Klinefelter, a lobbyistforthe
United Steelworkers of America, spoke in favor of the
environmentalist version of the.Clean Air Act currently
under consideration in Congress. The program in An
nenberg Auditorium was the second in a week-long
symposium series on the Clean Air Act sponsored by
Stanford for Environmental Education (SEE).
"We have very clear legislative options," Klinefelter
said.
According to Klinefelter, H.R. 5555 strengthens the
Clean Air Act of 1977 by requiring that areas not present
ly meeting air health standards attain these standards and
by ensuring that areas presently meeting air health stan
dards continue to maintain programs that exceed the
minimum standards.
The legislation also includes new statutes dealing with
acid rains and a list of "hazardous pollutants," suspected
as carcinogens, to be controlled by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).
Klinefelter said that the opposing legislation, H.R.
5252, which is backed by industry, would extend current

deadlines for meeting air health standards and drop the
requirement that new factories use the best available
clean-up technology. In addition, he said it would sub
stantially weaken the Prevention of Significant De
terioration Program which protects national parks and
forests and provides measurement levels in order to de
termine air quality throughout the country.
However, Klinefelter said that current economic con
cerns are receiving more attention in the current debate
over the two bills than those of environmentalists.
"When the Clean Air Act debate began," he said, "it
was a health issue. Basically the debate has shifted and it
has become an economic debate."
In response to industry charges that H.R. 5555 threat
ens present and potential jobs by requiring mills to install
costly pollution abatement equipment, Klinefelter said
that new technology associated with recapturing pollut
ants has provided some 500,000 new jobs against an esti
mated 20,000 lost jobs.
"What we have here," Klinefelter said, "is basically an
Act that is working and working well. If it's having an ef
fect on the economy, it's having a positive effect."
He also said that the benefits derived from a healthier
population and the drive toward modernizing aging
steel plants supported by the bill would contribute to in
creased productivity and efficiency.
"Whenever it saves them (the industry) money,"
Klinefelter said, "they're going to develop better tech
nologically, and I think that's the way to go."
