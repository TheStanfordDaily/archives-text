Cal goes conservative
They're not going berserk at Berserkley
anymore, Berkeley's Daily Californian
tells us. According to a recent survey by
the American Council on Education, stu
dents nationwide are more conservative
thiis year, and Cal is no exception. The 20
percent of the first-year students at Cal
who called themselves conservative was
the highest such figure ever.
Interestingly enough UC Berkeley stu
dents are three percentage points below
'the national average when it come to
"participating in organized demonstra
tions." Forty-one percent of the students
also call themselves "middle-of-the
road," reflecting a growing political
apathy. What happened to that radical
image, Cal?
From frats to fish
It sounds fishy, but it's true. University
of Virginia student joseph Cross lost his
$400 class ring during a storm on the
Chesapeake Bay, when the gold ring fell
from his finger, and he gave up hope of
ever seeing it again. But three months lat
er, the ring was returned to its owner by a
University of Virginia alumni, Coleman
Maddox, who spotted it in a fishmarket
garbage about 140 miles west of the bay
where it was lost. Apparently it had been
swallowed by a fish, and turned up in the
fishmarket. Maddox noted the engraved
fraternity, initials and date, and even
tually tracked down the owner.
Prof get F for giving A's
Maybe the whole class deserved A's,
but University officials at the University of

North Carolina in Wilmington couldn't
quite believe that. An assistant professor
who gave A's to all his students has been
suspended, has lost part of his salary, and
faces a hearing procedure that could lead
to his dismissal.
Mathematics professor Jules Kaplan
declined to state why he gave out all A's,
claiming he had never done so,
and he is now writing a book about it.
Cheaters never prosper
If you've ever "borrowed" a short story
for your fiction writing class, only to dis
cover it was written by the professor un
der a pen name, at least you're not in the
minority, the Cornell Daily Sun reports..
In an anonymous poll last year, two-thirds
of Stanford undergraduates said they
have plagiarized or padded biblio
graphies. Asa Washington Post columnist
said, "Plagiarism in the academic world is
almost as difficult to blot out as it is to
spell."
"Cheating," The Sun reports," is also
prevalent. One out of every three Prince
ton, Dartmouth, Amherst and Johns
Hopkins students confessed to cheating
at least once in 1980 campus surveys.
"Some cheaters devise elaborate meth
ods of climbing the grading curve. For ex
ample: "a University of Maryland student
last year used the University's computer
system to raise the grades of 40 of his
fraternity brothers. At Georgia Institute of
Technology, test-takers slipped crib
sheets inside their ball point pens. The
pen casings were made of clear plastic
which magnified physics and math for
mulas written in tiny script on the pieces
of paper.

"Remember, these are the guys who
got caught. The really crafty cheaters are
now probably in law school. ..
Rats for roommates
Complaining may get some people no
where, but it got 25 students at UC Santa
Barbard a total of $1700 last week when
they won a small claims court suit against
the University in a case of negligence in
dorm facilities upkeep.
"Specific complaints about the first
floor of San Miguel East dormitory in
cluded non-functioning urinals, toilets
and water fountain, as well as an invasion
of rats and ants in bathroom, lounge and
hallway areas, and in individual rooms.
"The action marked the first time in at
least 10 years that UCSB students have
won compensation in court over un
sanitary dormitory conditions, "Director
of Residential Services Everett Kirkelie
said.
"We try to maintain facilities as best we
can," Kirkelie said. "We could have the
most beautiful facilities but then students
couldn't afford to live there."
The ultimate dorm room
The automated dorm room has made
its debut at Ohio State University in Co
lumbus, Ohio, through the inventive gen
ius of sophomore electrical engineering
major Thomas Yocom.
Want to open the door? No keys,
please. Merely code in the correct se
quence on the buttons Yocom has in
stalled, and the lock releases. Lying in
bed, too lazy to answer the door? Speak
to your visitors through the intercom sys
tem he designed and built. And should

the visitors please you, invite them in:
Simply press the button that locks and un
locks the front door (all while reclining in
the comfort of bed).
When night falls and the weary student
prepare s for sleep, simply touch a panel
above the bed to activate the bed
warmer. This ingenious device Yocom
built by placing light bulbs in coffee cans.
The inventor is modest. He makes light
of the chandelier and dimmer switch he
built from scratch, brushes aside the oak
clock he made completely by hand.
"There's not much practical value in it,"
he says. "Some people like to knit; I like
to build things."
Courses in the winter?
According to the Williams Record, Wil
liams College in Massachusetts is serious
ly considering the termination of their
winter study program. Since 1966 the
school has offered special informal
classes to its students during the month of
january.
The classes offer a "change of pace" for
students in between two regular semes
ters of study in order to relieve the "regu
larity, fragmentation, and overload" of a
two-semester, five course curriculum.
"The first winter study period was like
heaven on earth," according to Biology
Prof. William Grant. Grant is now on
a committee at Williams to review the
program which has received complaints,
most from faculty members who criticize
the effectiveness of the classes.

The Record said that other colleges in
cluding Tufts, Mt. Holyoke, University of
Delaware, Wesleyan, and starting this
year, Amherst, all have instituted winter
study programs-
Seems like since we don't get the win
ter weather we can't expect to have a win
ter "study?" period. Hasn't anyone out
there ever heard of the quarter system?
Name your favorite course
"Principles of economics" may be im
portant but "Philosophy of law" runs a
close second. At least that is what Harvard
students believe, according to the
Harvard Crimson.
The course enrollment list at Harvard
show that 937 students wish to take Prof.
Otto Eckstein's economics class this
spring, while 797 students signed up for
Oxford visiting Prof. Ronald Dworkin's
philosophy class. The two are way out in
front of other classes.
"I'd like to have every student take Ec
10," Warburg told The Crimson, saying
that "bigness is better" for introductory
economics classes. He said the courses'
popularity is due to the fact that "the
country's big problems are economic."
Dworkin had planned his class to be a
discussion but the enrollment has
changed his mind. It "makes life harder,"
he said.
All visiting professors should be so
lucky. And he isn't even a former presi
dential candidate.

Rats for roommates
Complaining may get some people no
where, but it got 25 students at UC Santa
Barbard a total of $1700 last week when
they won a small claims court suit against
the University in a case of negligence in
dorm facilities upkeep.
"Specific complaints about the first
floor of San Miguel East dormitory in
cluded non-functioning urinals, toilets
and water fountain, as well as an invasion
of rats and ants in bathroom, lounge and
hallway areas, and in individual rooms.
"The action marked the first time in at
least 10 years that UCSB students have
won compensation in court over un
sanitary dormitory conditions, "Director
of Residential Services Everett Kirkelie
said.
"We try to maintain facilities as best we
can," Kirkelie said. "We could have the
most beautiful facilities but then students
couldn't afford to live there."
The ultimate dorm room
The automated dorm room has made
its debut at Ohio State University in Co
lumbus, Ohio, through the inventive gen
ius of sophomore electrical engineering
major Thomas Yocom.
Want to open the door? No keys,
please. Merely code in the correct se
quence on the buttons Yocom has in
stalled, and the lock releases. Lying in
bed, too lazy to answer the door? Speak
to your visitors through the intercom sys
tem he designed and built. And should

the visitors please you, invite them in:
Simply press the button that locks and un
locks the front door (all while reclining in
the comfort of bed).
When night falls and the weary student
prepare s for sleep, simply touch a panel
above the bed to activate the bed
warmer. This ingenious device Yocom
built by placing light bulbs in coffee cans.
The inventor is modest. He makes light
of the chandelier and dimmer switch he
built from scratch, brushes aside the oak
clock he made completely by hand.
"There's not much practical value in it,"
he says. "Some people like to knit; I like
to build things."
Courses in the winter?
According to the Williams Record, Wil
liams College in Massachusetts is serious
ly considering the termination of their
winter study program. Since 1966 the
school has offered special informal
classes to its students during the month of
january.
The classes offer a "change of pace" for
students in between two regular semes
ters of study in order to relieve the "regu
larity, fragmentation, and overload" of a
two-semester, five course curriculum.
"The first winter study period was like
heaven on earth," according to Biology
Prof. William Grant. Grant is now on
a committee at Williams to review the
program which has received complaints,
most from faculty members who criticize
the effectiveness of the classes.

The Record said that other colleges in
cluding Tufts, Mt. Holyoke, University of
Delaware, Wesleyan, and starting this
year, Amherst, all have instituted winter
study programs-
Seems like since we don't get the win
ter weather we can't expect to have a win
ter "study?" period. Hasn't anyone out
there ever heard of the quarter system?
Name your favorite course
"Principles of economics" may be im
portant but "Philosophy of law" runs a
close second. At least that is what Harvard
students believe, according to the
Harvard Crimson.
The course enrollment list at Harvard
show that 937 students wish to take Prof.
Otto Eckstein's economics class this
spring, while 797 students signed up for
Oxford visiting Prof. Ronald Dworkin's
philosophy class. The two are way out in
front of other classes.
"I'd like to have every student take Ec
10," Warburg told The Crimson, saying
that "bigness is better" for introductory
economics classes. He said the courses'
popularity is due to the fact that "the
country's big problems are economic."
Dworkin had planned his class to be a
discussion but the enrollment has
changed his mind. It "makes life harder,"
he said.
All visiting professors should be so
lucky. And he isn't even a former presi
dential candidate.

Cal goes conservative
They're not going berserk at Berserkley
anymore, Berkeley's Daily Californian
tells us. According to a recent survey by
the American Council on Education, stu
dents nationwide are more conservative
thiis year, and Cal is no exception. The 20
percent of the first-year students at Cal
who called themselves conservative was
the highest such figure ever.
Interestingly enough UC Berkeley stu
dents are three percentage points below
'the national average when it come to
"participating in organized demonstra
tions." Forty-one percent of the students
also call themselves "middle-of-the
road," reflecting a growing political
apathy. What happened to that radical
image, Cal?
From frats to fish
It sounds fishy, but it's true. University
of Virginia student joseph Cross lost his
$400 class ring during a storm on the
Chesapeake Bay, when the gold ring fell
from his finger, and he gave up hope of
ever seeing it again. But three months lat
er, the ring was returned to its owner by a
University of Virginia alumni, Coleman
Maddox, who spotted it in a fishmarket
garbage about 140 miles west of the bay
where it was lost. Apparently it had been
swallowed by a fish, and turned up in the
fishmarket. Maddox noted the engraved
fraternity, initials and date, and even
tually tracked down the owner.
Prof get F for giving A's
Maybe the whole class deserved A's,
but University officials at the University of

North Carolina in Wilmington couldn't
quite believe that. An assistant professor
who gave A's to all his students has been
suspended, has lost part of his salary, and
faces a hearing procedure that could lead
to his dismissal.
Mathematics professor Jules Kaplan
declined to state why he gave out all A's,
claiming he had never done so,
and he is now writing a book about it.
Cheaters never prosper
If you've ever "borrowed" a short story

In an anonymous poll last year, two-thirds
of Stanford undergraduates said they
have plagiarized or padded biblio
graphies. Asa Washington Post columnist
said, "Plagiarism in the academic world is
almost as difficult to blot out as it is to
spell."
"Cheating," The Sun reports," is also
prevalent. One out of every three Prince
ton, Dartmouth, Amherst and Johns
Hopkins students confessed to cheating
at least once in 1980 campus surveys.
"Some cheaters devise elaborate meth
ods of climbing the grading curve. For ex
ample: "a University of Maryland student
last year used the University's computer
system to raise the grades of 40 of his
fraternity brothers. At Georgia Institute of

"Principles of economics" may be im
portant but "Philosophy of law" runs a
close second. At least that is what Harvard
students believe, according to the
Harvard Crimson.
The course enrollment list at Harvard
show that 937 students wish to take Prof.
Otto Eckstein's economics class this
spring, while 797 students signed up for
Oxford visiting Prof. Ronald Dworkin's
philosophy class. The two are way out in
front of other classes.
"I'd like to have every student take Ec
10," Warburg told The Crimson, saying
that "bigness is better" for introductory
economics classes. He said the courses'
popularity is due to the fact that "the
country's big problems are economic."
Dworkin had planned his class to be a
discussion but the enrollment has
changed his mind. It "makes life harder,"
he said.
All visiting professors should be so
lucky. And he isn't even a former presi
dential candidate.
