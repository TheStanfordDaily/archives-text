## Card drops doubles but beats UC-Irvine 
### Sally Jenkins 
Between the clouds that
wouldn't rain and the serves
that wouldn't break, yesterday
was not a prizewinner for UC
lrvine men's tennis coach Greg
Patton.
Despite the fact that Stan
ford's No. 3 player Jeff Arons
was absent from the lineup, a
discovery which sent Patton
into a smiling reverie, the
Cardinal closed out the dual
match by sweeping all six sin
gles contests.
Arons'absence, the presence
of reserve player George Har
ding at No. 6 singles as a result,
and the windy and foreboding
weather all combined to spell a
Stanford upset in flashing red
letters. But it was Harding who
provided the upset, whipping
through Irvine freshman Bob
Zoller 6-3, 6-1 in the time it
takes to beat an egg.
Irvine took as much revenge
as it could in the doubles later
in the afternoon. They swept all
three matches without drop
ping a set, a statistic that left
Stanford head coach Dick
Gould feeling like he had just
swallowed a mouthful of warm
beer.
"I was really disappointed in
the doubles," he said. "We
can't let up on a lead, we aren't
good enough. But I was
pleased with what we did in the
singles."
Harding merely started off a
deluge. At No. 1 Stanford's
sophomore wonder Scott
Davis defeated junior Jim
Snyder, a top-ranked amateur
with unorthodox strokes and a
tough serve, in two sets, 6-2,
6-4. Davis made his move and
broke Snyder at 3-3 in the sec
ond set, but at break point on
his own serve in the next game,
he couldn't decide if a Snyder
forehand had caught the
baseline or not.
Snyder came around the net
and both players got on their
hands and knees to look for a
ball mark, and Davis gave up
the point.
\\ cost him his serve, but
Davissimply broke him again at
4-4 and held his own serve 4-1
\o win the match.
At N0.2 senior Scott Bond

urant had one of his tougher
matches, barely avoiding a
third set against Eric Quade, a
junior who counts USC's N0.2
player Roger Knapp and Utah's
No.l seed Jeff Robbins among
his upsets so far this year.
Bondurant slipped by 6-4, 7-5,
but had to break at 5-5 in the
second to do it.
At 2-3 double-break point
Quade slammed a backhand
volley down the line on Bond
urant's high return to make it
3-3, but at break point again he
put the same volley into the
net. With Bondurant serving
for the match Quade mis-hit
three backhand returns, un
able to find anything but
graphite. Bondurant hit two
backhands long to make it 3-2,
but Quade's forehand volley
fell into the net to give Stanford
it's third match of the day.
Senior John Corse replaced
Arons at N0.3 and dropped
Irvine's Ed McPherson in three
sets. Corse took a 3-0 lead in
every set, but McPhearson
cameback in the first to break
him three times and take the
set 5-7.
Corse returned with a ven
geance in the second set, 6-2.
He wasted no time in getting
off the court in the third either
as McPhearson — a senior who
puts every conceivable thing
on the ball save grease or spit
— could hold his serve only
twice.
Patton's big shock of the day
came where he least expected
it, and where he most expected
to take some matches away
from Stanford — the lower half
of the lineup. But Harding's
blowout victory set the pace
for freshmen Mark McKeen at
N0.4 and Paul Robinson at
N0.5.
McKeen walked over junior
Rob Nelson in two sets, 6-3 6-1,
but Robinson stumbled into a
three-set match against
sophomore Mark Ramos after
taking the first 6-3. He dropped
the second 3-6, and the fist
fight began.
Broken in the third game,
Robinson fell behind 2-4. He
held to make it 3-4, and then

FIGHTING BACK — Freshman Paul Robinson fought back from a 4-5 deficit in the third
set by breaking the serve of UC-lrvine's Mark Ramos twice in a row to take the No. 5
singles 6-3,3-6,7-5 yesterday.

broke without losing a point
only to drop his serve again.
The break gave Nelson a 5-4
game advantage as he served
for the match, and put Rob
inson in the position of having
to break twice to win.
But Robinson sunk his teeth
into Nelson's serve and at 3-3
broke him in style with a
scathing backhand passing
shot down the line.
Robinson held his own serve
4-1, then proceeded to break
Nelson yet again to win the
match. His first return was a
backhand winner, then
Nelson's overeager overhead
went long on Robinson's weak
second return to make it 0-2.
Robinson's next forehand
return went into the net to
make it 1-2, Nelson couldn't
get a handle on his next return,
and finally did himself in at tri
ple match point when a fore
hand volley fell wide.
At No.l doubles Davis and
the tardy Jeff Arons were de
feated by Quade and Snyder
3-6, 4-6. At No. 2 McKeen and
Robinson subbed in for Bond
urant and Corse and lost to
McPherson and Zoller 6-7
(4-7), 6-7 (3-7), and Karl Miller
and Jeremy Semple lost a 3-6,
1-6 laugher to Nelson and
Ramos.
Stanford's next home match
will be Friday at 1:30 p.m
against the University of Utah.
