While most students on
the farm think that this is
merely the week before
dead week, two weeks
before finals, and a time to
hide one's head and study,
the frustrated jocks know
differently. This is playoff
week for intramural basket
ball and soccer. How can
one possibly study for a final
with all these "big games"
to watch? Playing at some of
the most ungodly hours —
11:30 p.m. on a school night
— these frat bros, dorm
studs, and other over-the
hill high school jocks learn
the true meaning of the
word athletics.
On the subject of in
tramurals, you ever notice
how people choose the
strangest names for teams.
While college mascots are
usually lions, tigers, birds or
even colors (in the most
prestigious universities), in
tramural teams usually
choose names like
Zapathetics, Nads,
Chainsaws and the Guys
Who Talk Like Zetes. Let's
face it, an intramural mind is
just not normal.

For those of you who
want a study break this
weekend, pull out a polo
shirt, put on your khakis,
and watch the women's
lacrosse team play in the
California Mid-Season
Tournament at Roble Field
Saturday.
The Canadian Nationa\
Box Lacrosse Champions,
Kirby's Klippettes, will be at
the tournament and should
provide quite a challenge
for the Cardinal.
While most students on
the farm think that this is
merely the week before
dead week, two weeks
before finals, and a time to
hide one's head and study,
the frustrated jocks know
differently. This is playoff
week for intramural basket
ball and soccer. How can
one possibly study for a final
with all these "big games"
to watch? Playing at some of
the most ungodly hours —
11:30 p.m. on a school night
— these frat bros, dorm
studs, and other over-the
hill high school jocks learn
the true meaning of the
word athletics.
On the subject of in
tramurals, you ever notice
how people choose the
strangest names for teams.
While college mascots are
usually lions, tigers, birds or
even colors (in the most
prestigious universities), in
tramural teams usually
choose names like
Zapathetics, Nads,
Chainsaws and the Guys
Who Talk Like Zetes. Let's
face it, an intramural mind is
just not normal.
