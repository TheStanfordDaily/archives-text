"There's a difference in pick

with five counts of sexual as
sault on a USF female student.
"I think it is an embarrass

American."
Boggs said nine men were on
the selection committee.

Young University, has started

Scottsdale, Ariz. (AP) — Reg
gie Smith took the field early
on his first day in a San Francis
co Giants uniform but also left
early, when he felt some
cramps in his legs after two
hours of spring training prac
tice.
"I talked with (Manager)
Frank Robinson about letting
me set my own pace. There's
no hurry, no reason to try to do
it all in one day," said Smith,
the 36-year-old player signed
as a free agent over the week
end.
Smith has been an outfielder
throughout his big league
baseball career. He suffered a
shoulder injury two years ago,
and he and will try to win the
Giants' starting first base job.
He began working at the posi
tion Tuesday and also took
some batting practice.
Smith, who has 296 career
home runs, left a world cham
pionship team, the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
San Francisco (AP) — Quin
tin Dailey, University of San
Francisco's star guard, was
knocked off an All-America
basketball team after the selec
tion committee learned he had
been charged with sexual as
sault.
Frank Boggs, president ofthe
United States Basketball Writ
ers Association, said today that
Dailey, a junior, was removed
from the the list of 10 All-Amer
icans on Feb. 22, the day Dailey
was arrested and one day after
he was selected.
"There's a difference in pick
ing an All-Star team and an Ail-
American team," said Boggs,
sports editor of the Colorado
Springs Sun. An athlete picked
for "All-American should ex
emplify excellent athletic abili
ty and excellent behavior off
the court," Boggs said in a tele
phone interview.
Dailey has been charged
with five counts of sexual as
sault on a USF female student.
"I think it is an embarrass
ment to the committee," said
Pete Barry, Dailey's coach. "Ac
ting like both judge and jury
appears to me to be a bit un-

American."
Boggs said nine men were on
the selection committee.
