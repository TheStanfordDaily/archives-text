## The 						problem is not DiBiaso 
### 
Throngs of Stanford students applaud Dick
Dißiaso's pressured resignation as coach of
Stanford's basketball team, most of whom
have rarely, if ever, seen a game.
As the Cardinal coach for the past seven
years hits the showers after failing to produce
a winning season here at Stanford, some of
the mounds of negative press should be al
layed. Sure, Dißiaso will never be heralded as
a great coach, nor should he be, but Dißiaso
deserves a lot more credit than he has been
given, especially for this past season.
When Stanford beat Harvard earlier this
season, throttling the Ivy League power by 23
points, no one cared. When the Cardinal held
the nation's most talented team, UCLA, to 42
points at Maples Pavilion and led them
through half of the game at Pauley — where
no one but UCLA wins — people yawned.
When Stanford went into "the Pit,"
McArthur Court in Eugene, the day Dißiaso
resigned and pulled our a frantic overtime
win, people were just happy to see him go.
All the student body seems to care about is
the record — the rare wins and frequent
losses. The conditions Dißiaso and the
Cardinal have had to play under, or against,
have made opponents of not only other
schools, but Stanford as well.
At that game in Eugene, Stanford and the
University of Oregon had approximately the

same record. They, too, were playing poorly
and their season was history. Unlike Maples,
however, one knew there was a basketball
game to be played there an hour before the
game, as the place was packed. The victory
was beautiful, all the cliches intact, as the
Cardinal won one for the resigning coach.
In Eugene, not to mention Corvallis,
Tempe, Los Angeles, Pullman, and Seattle,
the fans and the student body support their
team, win or lose. Dißiaso and the entire team
are fighting their own school, getting blamed
for the end, rather than credited for the
means.
George Raveling, coach of Washington
State, said it best. "The rest of the Pac-10 has
cannons, Stanford only has rifles." Looking at
what the other schools have talent-wise
makes it seem very unfair that we should be
so deprived. It is amazing that schools like
USC and Washington State lose as much as
they do with the talent they have. Just one of
their starters, or even one of UCLA's top 10
players, would move Stanford a notch or two
up the Pac-10 ladder.
This also ignores the fact that our best
guard and quickest forward were lost for the
season. Both will be back, of course, but Keith
Jones, who Dißiaso (among others) credits
with "unlimited potential" lost a year of
eligibility.
