# Prepare for NCAA's
## Stanford closes season 
### Sarah Carrel 
Stanford Women's basketball team does not
anticipate any problems tonight as it faces the
University of San Francisco on the road in its last
regular season game.
The Cardinal handled the Lady Dons easily
78-56 earlier in the season.
What makes this game unique for Stanford is
thaWt will be one of the few times this season
that'ithe injury-ridden Cardinal will be at full
strength.
A'-victory over USF will assure Stanford a
playoff spot in the NCAA Regional Playoffs.
The first round of the playoffs will be an
nounced on Sunday, when the Stanford team
will be notified of its opponent and the location
of the game. Should the Cardinal advance to the

second round, that game will be played at
Maples Pavilion.
Occasionally, the USF team has produced
some surprises, and assistant coach Sue Ro
jcewicz expressed her concern about the team
getting overconfident.
"USF has been inconsistent all year," she said,
" but they are capable of scoring 80 points on
any one night."
This season, the Cardinal has compiled an 18-7
record. Stanford is currently 8-3 in the the
Northern California Athletic Conference and in
second place behind Berkeley.
Head coach Dottty McCrea, with last Thurs
day's victory over Fresno State, has now com
piled 100 wins in only six years at Stanford.
