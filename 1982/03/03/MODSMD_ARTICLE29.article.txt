Top-seeded Stanford will
face Clemson in the first round
of the eight-team National In

Ann Arbor, Mich, tomor

Coach Frank Brennan is
pleased with the opening
draw.
"I'm real happy with the
draw, Brennan said. "We
haven't had too many matches
so far this season â€” probably
fewer than any team here."
The top eight teams in the
nation are divided into two
four-team divisions. The four
teams play a round robin tour
nament and the winners of the
divisions meet on Sunday for
the Championship.
Stanford, No. 4 seed Trinity,
Clemson and Florida make up
one bracket while No. 2 seed
UCLA, No. 3seed USC, Indiana
and Miami comprise the other.
"I think UCLA will come out
of the other half," Brennan
said. "We'regladthatwearen't
in USC and UCLA's bracket.
We play both of them twice this
season so we don't like to run
into them too many times."
Stanford will be paced in sin
gles by senior three-time All-
America Alycia Moulton.
Moulton teamed with Caryn

Copeland to win the Associa
tion of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women doubles cham
