Haig: Salvadoran guerrillas get outside aid
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig said yesterday the
military operations of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement are being
directed from outside the country by non-Salvadoran forces which he
refused to identify.
Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Haig said he
could not provide more details because this could jeopardize American
intelligence sources.
Haig made the statement to emphasize that the turmoil in El Salvador
does not stem exclusively from local discontent, as some critics of Rea
gan administration policy have alleged.
The evidence for his assertion is "overwhelming and irrefutable,"
Haig said.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said that on Feb. 25, CIA Director William Casey and others
gave the panel a briefing which "left no doubt that there is active in
volvement by Sandinista (Nicaraguan) government officials in support
of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement."
"This support includes arrangements for the use of Nicaraguan terri
tory for the movement of arms and munitions to guerrillas in El
Salvador, the continuing passage of guerrillas in and out of Nicaragua
for advanced training in sabotage and other terrorist tactics, and the
presence of high-level guerrilla headquarters elements in Nicaragua,"
Goldwater said.
The House overwhelmingly adopted a resolution yesterday urging
President Ronald Reagan to press for "unconditional discussions"
among major political factions in war-torn El Salvador.
The measure, adopted by vote of 396 to 3, said such talks should aim to
"guarantee a safe and stable environment" for the Salvadoran elections.
