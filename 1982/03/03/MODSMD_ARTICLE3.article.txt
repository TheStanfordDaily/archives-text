Haig: Salvadoran guerrillas get outside aid
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander Haig said yesterday the
military operations of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement are being
directed from outside the country by non-Salvadoran forces which he
refused to identify.
Testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Haig said he
could not provide more details because this could jeopardize American
intelligence sources.
Haig made the statement to emphasize that the turmoil in El Salvador
does not stem exclusively from local discontent, as some critics of Rea
gan administration policy have alleged.
The evidence for his assertion is "overwhelming and irrefutable,"
Haig said.
Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) chairman of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, said that on Feb. 25, CIA Director William Casey and others
gave the panel a briefing which "left no doubt that there is active in
volvement by Sandinista (Nicaraguan) government officials in support
of the Salvadoran guerrilla movement."
"This support includes arrangements for the use of Nicaraguan terri
tory for the movement of arms and munitions to guerrillas in El
Salvador, the continuing passage of guerrillas in and out of Nicaragua
for advanced training in sabotage and other terrorist tactics, and the
presence of high-level guerrilla headquarters elements in Nicaragua,"
Goldwater said.
The House overwhelmingly adopted a resolution yesterday urging
President Ronald Reagan to press for "unconditional discussions"
among major political factions in war-torn El Salvador.
The measure, adopted by vote of 396 to 3, said such talks should aim to
"guarantee a safe and stable environment" for the Salvadoran elections.
Asked by reporters what purpose is
served by a broadly worded resolution on El
Salvador, House Mafority Leader jim Wright
replied, "We often express ourselves on a
subject when we don't know what to do
about it."
Polish-Soviet tie firmed
Moscow — Polish military ruler General
Wojtiech Jaruzelski took his country back
into a tight Kremlin embrace yesterday,
pledging formally to increase political, mili
tary and economic ties with Soviet bloc
countries and to squash "in a most resolute
manner" any attempt to change the socialist
system in Poland.
The pledges, contained in a joint Soviet-
Polish communique, suggested the two
countries have established a closer rela
tionship than at any time since the outbreak
of worker unrest in Poland in August 1980.
In the communique, the Polish leader
ship said Poland "is and will be a socialist
state" with an economic and political sys
tem "based on social property of the means
of production" and"the power of the work
ing class, of the working people."The com
munique recognized "the steering role" of
the Polish Communist Party.
It said the imposition of martial law was
taken in accord with the Polish constitution
to prevent counter-revolutionary forces
aided by "imperialist circles" from over
thorwing the socialist system.
"It was stressed by the Polish side that any
attempts to resume actions aimed at causing
economic disarray, at resumption of anar
chy, disturbances, at changing the social
and political system will be cut short most
resolutely in the future," the communique
said.
The Soviet Communist Party, the com
munique said, "highly values the role and
significance of the trade unions in building
communism" and in other aspects of life
such as strengthening labor discipline, par
ticipating in the management of production
and caring for working and living condi
tions.
Moscow is known to favor the continua
tion of martial law for some time to allow
the Polish party to regain its strength. Given
Poland's almost total dependence on the
Soviet Union's economic assistance, Mos
cow's view must have carried considerable
weight.
Israel-Lebanon tension rises
Beirut, Lebanon — Israel is sending sig
nals that, on Lebanon's side of the border,
seem clearly warlike.
In the past few days there have been re
ports here o<:
• Israeli overflights into southern Leba
non involving jet fighters and helicopters.
• Israeli gunboats off the Lebanese coast.

• Stepped-up movement across the
border from Israel into the southern Leba
non enclave occupied by the forcesof rene
gade Lebanese army Major Saad Haddad.
Despite word from Jerusalem that war jit
ters there have subsided after hitting a peak
early last month, the Lebanese still expect
the worst.
"The danger of the resumption of
hostilities," a diplomat here said, "is higher
now than it was before the Israeli annexa
tion of the Golan Heights."
In another development yesterday, Is
raeli's chief of military intelligence, Major
General Yohoshua Saguy, called a press
conference to announce that Palestinian
guerrillas in southern Lebanon have
doubled their potential firepower since last
July, when the cease-fire ended a bitter war
of bombs, rockets and artillery across the Is
rael-Lebanese border.
For now, the two sides have managed to
restrain themselves, but the delicate bal
ance in southern Lebanon might be upset
by the slightest incident.
"We're getting into a kind of craziness,"
the diplomat here said. "The tripwire is
neck-high."
Senate is against busing
Washington — The Senate easily ap
proved legislation yesterday that would all
but eliminate busing as a method of inte
grating public schools. The vote capped the
first round of efforts by Senate conserva
tives to limit federal court authority over so
cial questions.
Although the 57-37 tally was a major vic
tory for Senate conservatives, the measure
faces a highly uncertain future in the House.
"The fight is not over," said Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.) who has fought the pro
posal since last summer. "This legislation
will not be enacted into law in thissession of
Congress."
Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) a key
backer of the bill, conceded there is "a big
hill to climb in the House" and said he was
aware that "tricks" in the House rules might
be used against him.
The bill would pass if the House is per
mitted to vote, Johnston said.
The emotional battle was the first in a
series in which conservatives are seeking to
reverse social policy by limiting authority of
federal courts to act on busing, abortion,
school prayer and other constitutional
questions. Critics condemn the tactics as a
backdoor approach to amending the Con
stitution.
Specifically, the anti-busing bill would
prohibit federal judges from ordering stu
dents to be transported to schools more
than 15 minutes or five miles from their
homes.
It would also bar the Justice Department
from asking courts to use busing as a de
segregation remedy.

Cranston fights Abscam
Washington — With the battle just 24
hours off, Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.)
served notice yesterday that he will try to
head off the proposed expulson of Sen.
Harrison Williams (D-N.J.) by offering a res
olution under which the Senate would
merely censure Williams.
Cranston charged that the Department of
Justice and the FBI "engaged in improper
conduct" during their Abscam investigation
of Williams and some of the six House mem
bers who also were convicted in the scan
dal. Federal law enforcers, he said, sought
"to induce members of Congress to commit
crimes" and the conduct of the agents and
prosecutors should be investigated further
by the Senate.
Cranston, who is the Senate minority
Whip, said he would offer his censure reso
lution as a substitute for explusion after the
Senate takes up the expulsion move today.
The Senate Ethics Committee has unani
mously recommended that Williams be ex
pelled for "ethically repugnant" conduct.
Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.) vice chairman
of the ethics committee, said Cranston's ef
fort for a censure "could well be suc
cessful." But Heflin, former chief justice of
the Alabama Supreme Court, said he still be
lieved that expulsion was warranted in Wil
liams' case.
There is precedent for moderating the ac
tion against Williams. Three years ago the
Senate rejected a proposal to censure Sen.
Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) for financial mis
conduct and voted instead to "denounce"
him, a lesser sanction under which he could
not be stripped of his Agriculture Commit
tee chairmanship.
A spokesman for Williams said yesterday
that even a censure resolution was not ac
ceptable to the senator, and that Williams
had not conferred with Cranston about it.
Reagan stands on budget
Albuquerque, New Mexico — A freshly
combative President Ronald Reagan yester
day hit back at critics of his defense spend
ing program, charging that they would risk
the nation's survival at a time the Soviet
Union is vastly increasing its own military
capabilities.
"As much as I detest the idea of deficits, as
president I must accept a large deficit if that
is what it takes to buy peace for the rest of
the century," Reagan said, also tying the
deficit to national defense at a fund-raiser
for Sen. Harrison Schmitt (R-N.M).
The Schmitt speech was one of two in
which the president once again indicated
that he will not back down from his in
sistence on a record military spending in
crease and a 10 percent income tax cut this
year.
Before stopping here, the president, who
is en route to a vacation in California, also

stopped in Cheyenne for a fund-raiser for
Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.). His theme
both places was that it would be dangerous
to retreat even marginally from the 18 per
cent increase he has proposed in the mili
tary budget.
"We dare not reduce our defense
budget," Reagan said in Cheyenne. "The
bulk of the increase is not going for fancy
new planes or elaborate weapon systems.
Most of the money is for basic essentials
now in dangerously short supply. It's going
to go for manpower, maintenanceand read
iness.
"If we eliminated all the major weapons
programs that are scheduled it would only
reduce next year's deficit by $6.5 billion in
our $3 trillion economy. I don't think Amer
icans want their armed forces held together
with chewing gum and baling wire, unable
to move for want of spare parts," he said.
Sinai begins withdrawl
Jerusalem — The Israeli army will begin to
evict ultra-nationalist squatters from the
northern Sinai town of Yamit today as part
of a coordinated plan to clear the way for a
peaceful surrender of the desert peninsula
to Egypt next month.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin and De
fense Minister Ariel Sharon disclosed plans
yesterday for the forced evacuation. They
urged anti-withdrawal activists to cooperate
with the army to avoid needless bloodshed.
But the situation is expected to be ex
plosive in Yamit, a 10-year-old town built on
the desert beside the Mediterranean. Yamit
and the surrounding northern Sinai farming
communities have been the strongholds of
anti-withdrawal sentiment ever since the
Camp David peace treaty was signed in
1978.
Anti-withdrawal leaders pledged yester
day night that their resistance will be only
passive, but the atmosphere in the town was
extremely tense.
Under the terms of the Israeli-Egyptian
peace treaty, Israel must relinquish the final
one-third of the Sinai to Egyptian control by
midnight April 25.

and closed at 825.82
