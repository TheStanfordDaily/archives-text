# Solar heating unit for DeGuerre pool a possibility

A solar-heating system, which could save Stanford $12-15,000
or more in annual heating costs, may soon be installed at de-
Guerre Pool.
If the project is completed, according to Wim Steenbakkers,
former assistant director of athletics, it would become the larg
est solar energy system on the campus.
The Athletic Department and the California Energy Invest
ment Corporation (CEIC) of Palo Alto are currently negotiating
the possibility of a limited partnership in which the latter would
lease the space needed for the solar system from the University.
The corporation would then build the system and sell the
energy generated by it to Stanford.
While the University would most likely benefit greatly from
the proposed system, the nature of the business relationship
leaves the job of raising capital funding with CEIC. The corpo

ration would be responsible for soliciting funds from private in
vestors.
According to Steenbakkes, the reasons for the roundabout
nature of the arrangements are numerous.
First, CEIC would pay for the initial estimated capital cost of
$300,000 to $350,000.
"This way the Athletic Department doesn't have to come up
with the original capital outlay," Steenbakkers said. "And we
just don't have $300,000 sitting in our back pocket."
The corporation, on the other hand, has the additional bene
fit of being eligible for solar tax credits. The University, as a non
profit organization, would not be eligible for such credits if it
were to build the solar system on its own.
Following its initial construction on the roof of the handball
and squash courts, the system would be owned outright by
CEIC for five years. During that period, the Athletic Department

would buy the solar energy from the CEIC at about one-half the
rate they now pay the University for steam-guarded heat.
Steam costs for the pool are budgeted at $115,000 for the
1981-82 academic year, and the solar system is expected to con
tribute 20-25 percent of the heating needs for the pool. Thus,
the savings to Stanford during the five year period would be
substantial withut even taking energy price increases into ac
count.
"We incur tremendous costs in operating the pool," Steen
bakkers said, "but until now all of our conservation projects in
volved in the electrical system. The next most attractive energy
conservation measure in a solar heating system."
After the contract period, the system would be donated to
the University, at which time the partnership would get a large
tax write-off.
