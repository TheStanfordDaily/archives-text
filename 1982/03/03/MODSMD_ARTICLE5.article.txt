# No lost key fees for summer conferees
## 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer Second in a series 
Stanford from June to August. The
Summer Conferences Office trans
forms many University residences
from dorms into "pseudo-hotels."
Gone are the frayed dorm curtains,
the graffiti-splashed walls, the
stained carpets.. .and in many cases,
the Daily has discovered through its
week-long investigation of Univer
sity key policy, gone are the keys.
During the summer months, Resi
dential Education turns over the
management of many of the large
dorms and Row houses to the Sum
mer Conferences Office (SCO). Dur
ing this period last year, the SCO lost
more than 200 dorm keys and almost
89 row house keys. Lois Fariello, man
ager of conferences, estimated that
her office ordered between lOand 15
lock changes ("rekeys") last summer.
When a conference guest loses
keys, or forgets to return them, the
Conference Office determines
whether or not there is a risk and if
there is a possibility security could be
jeopardized, the locks are changed,
Fariello said. However, she added
that most conferees come from far
away and rekeys usually aren't or
dered because it is assumed that the
key is has ended up in a desk drawer
or basement in New York, Tokyo, or
some other distant place.
A considerably ditierent key loss

ing the regular school year. Every
time a student loses a key, the lock on
the door is changed and the student
is charged $34.
This dichotomy has incited some
students and staff to cry "double
standard" and criticize the Con
ference Office policy. The office
charges students and younger vis
itors such as cheerleaders $34 to re
key rooms while it does not charge
summer conferees when it orders
duplicate keys.
Ed Scoles, director of housing and
food services, said he didn't see any
inconsistency between Conference
Office and Residential Education pol
icy. "The consistency is that you have
to look at each situation on its mer
its," Scoles said.
A lost key found during the school
year by a student familiar to the cam
pus might pose a risk because the stu
dent would have an idea of what lock
the key fit, while a summer visitor
foreign to the University would not
have any idea what lock fit a lost key,
Scoles said.
"It's a double standard, but it's a to
tally different system," said Leo Cun
ningham, a senior who worked for
the Conference Office last summer.
Cunningham said none of the pe
jorative issues that surround a double
standard apply. "It would be like .. .
(if you went) to a Ramada Inn and
you lost a key and they charged you
for it,"he said.
The conference concession

grosses about $2.5 million in a sum
mer season, according to Fariello. A
student paying conference rates
would have to pay about $1000 a
quarter to live in the dorms. Fariello
explained that these higher rates
cover the cost of rekeying and it
would be preposterous to charge
conferees a fee for necessary lock
changes.
For every 20 duplicate room keys
ordered last summer, one rekey
work order was processed, according
to Fariello's statistics. It costs $40 a
shot to rekey a single room. Chang
ing all the locks in a dormitory or
house — the action called for when a
master key is lost — is a $3000 to $7000
proposition.
"Conferences doesn't want to do it
(re-key in every case) because it will
make them look like they're making
less money," said Victoria Baker, the
dorm secretary in Stern Hall who
processes keys. "The hidden cost is
student security."
From her experiences in Stern,
Baker said she has gotten the im
pression that the Conference office,
while it records the number of keys
lost, does not keep tabs on who loses
the keys, whether lost keys are ever
returned after duplicates have been
made, or what happens to the dupli
cates after they are ordered.
The Conference Office's main
concern, said Assistant Manager of
Con\erente% Kathv Wauen, is to lo
the dorm office key boards in August
matches the number hooked there in
june.
The Conference Office last year
left the Stern office, which admin
isters the Stern complex as well as
Branner, Toyon, and Crothers Halls
during the summer, a legacy of
riches. More than 100 extra room du
plicates are tied at the bottom of the
Stern keyboard. Five master keys
coded with a Branner stamp were
found in the office. When tried in
Branner doors, two of the keys af
forded the Daily entry.
"Nobody knows what goes on be
tween Conferences and the office
staff in the summer," said Sis Allsopp,
a former Branner secretary. "Con
ferences couldn't find two (master)
keys, so we ordered two more. Then
Vicky (secretary in Stern) called and
said she'd found two Branner keys
Fariello said, "We have never lost a
master key."
According to Scott Hayes, a resi
dent assistant (RA) in Granada, a mas
ter key appeared from nowhere last
September. "As far as we can tell,"
Hayes said. "The key was lost by con
ferences."
Barbara Howard, Lagunita office
secretary, said she knew nothing
about a master key being found,
saying that was the Conference Of
fice's territory. Fariello also said she
was not aware of a master key being

mysteriously found in Lagunita. In
any case, whether the master was lost
or not, Granada RAs Scott Hays and
Madeline Rawley confirmed that
Granada was rekeyed early last quar
ter.
The lack of continuous records
makes it doubly difficult to de
termine what happens in incidents
like the one in Lagunita. When the
Conference Office turns over dorm
administration to Residential Educa
tion in September, "Our office is
coming in, and another one is going
out," said Jan Van Houten, resident
fellow for Manzanita Park. "It's as if
they're totally different."
"They (Conference Office inven
tory sheets) are useless to me," said
Baker. "They don't tell me what the
security risk to the dorm is. Number
one: They don't keep track of who
loses the keys. Number two: I don't
get the records. They don't give
those records to field staff."
Warren said that her office would
share key records with Baker and
other field staff but that she doubted
Baker "had a reason to know" what
the records contained.
A group of field staff and adminis
trators recently had a meeting to
come up with suggestions for im
proving Conference record-keep
ing, according to Cunningham, who
has worked for both Conferences
and Residential Education. Though
Cunningham said he considered rec
ord complaints "a much-ado-about
nothing-issue," he added that the
committee had agreed Conference
key control could be improved by
keeping a log of what keys had been
lost and who had lost them. These
records are currently kept, but not in
a unified format.

would have to pay about $1000 a
quarter to live in the dorms. Fariello
explained that these higher rates
cover the cost of rekeying and it
would be preposterous to charge
conferees a fee for necessary lock
changes.
For every 20 duplicate room keys
ordered last summer, one rekey
work order was processed, according
to Fariello's statistics. It costs $40 a
shot to rekey a single room. Chang
ing all the locks in a dormitory or
house — the action called for when a
master key is lost — is a $3000 to $7000
proposition.
"Conferences doesn't want to do it
(re-key in every case) because it will
make them look like they're making
less money," said Victoria Baker, the
dorm secretary in Stern Hall who
processes keys. "The hidden cost is
student security."
From her experiences in Stern,
Baker said she has gotten the im
pression that the Conference office,
while it records the number of keys
lost, does not keep tabs on who loses
the keys, whether lost keys are ever
returned after duplicates have been
made, or what happens to the dupli
cates after they are ordered.
The Conference Office's main
concern, said Assistant Manager of
Con\erente% Kathv Wauen, is to lo
the dorm office key boards in August
matches the number hooked there in

The Conference Office last year
left the Stern office, which admin
isters the Stern complex as well as
Branner, Toyon, and Crothers Halls
during the summer, a legacy of
riches. More than 100 extra room du
plicates are tied at the bottom of the
Stern keyboard. Five master keys
coded with a Branner stamp were
found in the office. When tried in
Branner doors, two of the keys af
forded the Daily entry.
"Nobody knows what goes on be
tween Conferences and the office
staff in the summer," said Sis Allsopp,
a former Branner secretary. "Con
ferences couldn't find two (master)
keys, so we ordered two more. Then
Vicky (secretary in Stern) called and
said she'd found two Branner keys
Fariello said, "We have never lost a
master key."
According to Scott Hayes, a resi
dent assistant (RA) in Granada, a mas
ter key appeared from nowhere last
September. "As far as we can tell,"
Hayes said. "The key was lost by con
ferences."
Barbara Howard, Lagunita office
secretary, said she knew nothing
about a master key being found,
saying that was the Conference Of
fice's territory. Fariello also said she
was not aware of a master key being

mysteriously found in Lagunita. In
any case, whether the master was lost
or not, Granada RAs Scott Hays and
Madeline Rawley confirmed that
Granada was rekeyed early last quar
ter.
The lack of continuous records
makes it doubly difficult to de
termine what happens in incidents
like the one in Lagunita. When the
Conference Office turns over dorm
administration to Residential Educa
tion in September, "Our office is
coming in, and another one is going
out," said Jan Van Houten, resident
fellow for Manzanita Park. "It's as if
they're totally different."
"They (Conference Office inven
tory sheets) are useless to me," said
Baker. "They don't tell me what the
security risk to the dorm is. Number
one: They don't keep track of who
loses the keys. Number two: I don't
get the records. They don't give
those records to field staff."
Warren said that her office would
share key records with Baker and
other field staff but that she doubted
Baker "had a reason to know" what
the records contained.
A group of field staff and adminis
trators recently had a meeting to
come up with suggestions for im
proving Conference record-keep

has worked for both Conferences
and Residential Education. Though
Cunningham said he considered rec
ord complaints "a much-ado-about
nothing-issue," he added that the
committee had agreed Conference
key control could be improved by
keeping a log of what keys had been
lost and who had lost them. These
records are currently kept, but not in
a unified format.

that most conferees come from far

The lack of continuous records
makes it doubly difficult to de
termine what happens in incidents
like the one in Lagunita. When the
Conference Office turns over dorm
administration to Residential Educa
tion in September, "Our office is
coming in, and another one is going
out," said Jan Van Houten, resident
fellow for Manzanita Park. "It's as if
they're totally different."
"They (Conference Office inven
tory sheets) are useless to me," said
Baker. "They don't tell me what the
security risk to the dorm is. Number
one: They don't keep track of who
loses the keys. Number two: I don't
get the records. They don't give
those records to field staff."
Warren said that her office would
share key records with Baker and
other field staff but that she doubted
Baker "had a reason to know" what
the records contained.
A group of field staff and adminis
trators recently had a meeting to
come up with suggestions for im
proving Conference record-keep
ing, according to Cunningham, who
has worked for both Conferences
and Residential Education. Though
Cunningham said he considered rec
ord complaints "a much-ado-about
nothing-issue," he added that the
committee had agreed Conference
key control could be improved by
keeping a log of what keys had been
lost and who had lost them. These
records are currently kept, but not in
a unified format.
