## 1983 Budget—who Is right? 
### Assoicated Press 
New York — Which estimate of the 1983
budget deficit is correct? The Reagan adminis
tration's $91.5 billion or the Congressional
Budget Office's figure of $121 billion? Who is
right: Reagan or Rivlin?
To suggest that neither is right might be cor
rect, but verification awaits the passage of time.
Meanwhile, the disparity can be accounted for
Dy an old peristent theme: differences in expec
tations.
Those differences, many so subjective they
cannot be measured, demostrated or proven by
any scientific technique, pervade today's eco
nomic analyses and in fact the direction of the
economy itself.
In the budget dispute, the president assumes
that the economy will improve more sharply and
provide more revenues than Alice Rivlin, direc
tor of the budget office. On the spending side,
he feels he can operate more efficiently than
Rivlin and staff assume he can.
To say that the administration's view of things
includes a good deal of hope might be close to
the truth. It assumes, for example, that leases of
federal lands will be at maximum rates, recession
or not.
The budget office, however, is no less guilty,
assuming as it does that the country will enjoy
bumper crops, thus adding to the cost of price
supports, an assumption that no farmer would

take for granted.
Equally subjective expectations and assump
tions are found throughout the economic
world, even among those econometric model
builders who reduce economic activity to piles
of numbers and then seek to make the numbers
interact in what they think is a manner similar to
,the economy.
The result of their activity is, of course, more
numbers, some drawn out to hundredths of a
unit of whatever it is they are measuring or
projecting, giving the impression of great ac
curacy and objectivity.
Some of this activity is nonsense. Some of the
numbers that go into the recipe are guesses.
Many are rounded estimates. And some of the
hardest looking numbers used are, for practical
purposes, inaccurate.
National income as provided by the Com
merce Department, for example, measures only
domestic activity, though the U.S. economy op
erates extensively overseas. Corporate profits as
reported to the Internal Revenue Service differ
from profits as reported to shareholders because
of accounting procedures. Still, they are some
times interchanged.
Inevitably, and especially when a forecaster
has a choice between using one or the other of
two differing measures of the same economic
activity, his own subjective expectations are like
ly to intrude.
