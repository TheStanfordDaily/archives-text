# Panel examines history of SALT
## 
### Washington Post 
Austin, Texas — From 1969 to 1979, the
strategic-arms-control process acronymed
SALT was a centerpiece of American
diplomacy. Then it disappeared from the
diplomatic scene. For two days here last
week a group of 14 experts and observers
tried to figure out what had happened to it
and whether it will soon be revived.
The meeting at the Lyndon B. Johnson
School of Public Affairs had the flavor of a
Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony. These
particular lights have been turned off since
the SALT II treaty died after the Soviet army
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979.
Turning them on again made the eyes
blink.
The conference here demonstrated that
American arms-control specialists have
got used to the fact that the national con
sensus that made 10 years of SALT possible
has collapsed, leaving the country deeply
divided about the purposes of nuclear
weapons and the best ways to limit the un
precedented dangers these weapons pose.
The wreckage of that consensus has left
an odd division of opinion about the
future prospects for formal agreements to
limit nuclear arms. Representatives of the
Reagan administration insisted here that
new progress is possible and that signs of
progress would soon be visible.
George Bundy, John F. Kennedy's na
tional-security adviser and formerly presi
dent of the Ford Foundation, said he didn't
think so. "The prospects for new arms
control agreements in the next five years
are very low," Bundy said. New American

weapons programs would complicate any
chances of success, he added.
But Paul Warnke, the principal nego
tiator of SALT II and a man who has often
been vilified by conservative opponentsof
that treaty, many of them members of the
Reagan administration, was much more
hopeful. Arms control is "an unnatural
act," Warnke observed, but there is still
momentum behind it.
He suggested that the current "In
termediate Nuclear Forces" negotiations
in Geneva, aimed at limiting nuclear weap
ons deployed in Europe, really amount to a
resumption of the SALT talks, or START
talks in the Reagan administration's pre
ferred acronym, standing for Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks.
Warnke said the Reagan adminis
tration's interest in the European talks may
have been forced by West European opin
ion and the negotiations may have been
"conceived in sin," but they have a life of
their own and could succeed.
William Hyland, one of Henry Kissin
ger's closest associates in the Nixon and
Ford administrations, took up the same
point, arguing that the European nego
tiations "are probably doomed to suc
ceed."
If a compromise can be reached on Eu
ropean-based missiles, Hyland added, a
new compromise on the intercontinental
weapons that are the subject of the SALT or
START talks could follow.
The administration has discovered,
Hyland said, that it is better to campaign as
the "peace candidate" than as the "war

candidate." He noted that the adminis
tration had both respected the unratified
SALT II treaty that Ronald Reagan ran
against in 1980 and declined to "link" con
tinued arms negotiations to acceptable So
viet behavior in other areas.
The administration decided not to sus
pend the Geneva talks on European weap
ons after the declaration of martial law in
Poland, though it did postpone beginning
a new round of START talks on intercon
tinental weapons because of the Polish
events.
The senior representatives of the Rea
gan administration here indicated that
"linkage" would not be invoked to put off
further those START talks. Ambassador
James Good by, deputy chief of the admin
istration's delegation to the as-yet-uncon
vened talks, said the discussions could be
gin "later in the summer or perhaps in the
fall."
Other participants were much less
hopeful. Dmitri Simes, a Russian-born pro
fessor at the Johns Hopkins University
School for Advanced International Stud
ies, said the administration's "zero-op
tion" proposal to eliminate all nuclear
ballistic missiles in Europe was so un
realistic that it is unlikely to lead anywhere.
In the manner of academicconferences,
this one ended with no agreement. The
subject — nuclear weapons — was the one
contribution to the human condition that
could turn this generation into the pariah
of all history, but there was no sense of ur
gency in the discussion.

ons deployed in Europe, really amount to a
resumption of the SALT talks, or START
talks in the Reagan administration's pre
ferred acronym, standing for Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks.
Warnke said the Reagan adminis
tration's interest in the European talks may
have been forced by West European opin
ion and the negotiations may have been
"conceived in sin," but they have a life of
their own and could succeed.
William Hyland, one of Henry Kissin
ger's closest associates in the Nixon and
Ford administrations, took up the same
point, arguing that the European nego
tiations "are probably doomed to suc
ceed."
If a compromise can be reached on Eu
ropean-based missiles, Hyland added, a
new compromise on the intercontinental
weapons that are the subject of the SALT or
START talks could follow.
The administration has discovered,
Hyland said, that it is better to campaign as
the "peace candidate" than as the "war

candidate." He noted that the adminis
tration had both respected the unratified
SALT II treaty that Ronald Reagan ran
against in 1980 and declined to "link" con
tinued arms negotiations to acceptable So
viet behavior in other areas.
The administration decided not to sus
pend the Geneva talks on European weap
ons after the declaration of martial law in
Poland, though it did postpone beginning
a new round of START talks on intercon
tinental weapons because of the Polish
events.
The senior representatives of the Rea
gan administration here indicated that
"linkage" would not be invoked to put off
further those START talks. Ambassador
James Good by, deputy chief of the admin
istration's delegation to the as-yet-uncon
vened talks, said the discussions could be
gin "later in the summer or perhaps in the
fall."
Other participants were much less
hopeful. Dmitri Simes, a Russian-born pro
fessor at the Johns Hopkins University
School for Advanced International Stud
ies, said the administration's "zero-op
tion" proposal to eliminate all nuclear
ballistic missiles in Europe was so un
realistic that it is unlikely to lead anywhere.
In the manner of academicconferences,
this one ended with no agreement. The
subject — nuclear weapons — was the one
contribution to the human condition that
could turn this generation into the pariah
of all history, but there was no sense of ur
gency in the discussion.
Austin, Texas — From 1969 to 1979, the
strategic-arms-control process acronymed
SALT was a centerpiece of American
diplomacy. Then it disappeared from the
diplomatic scene. For two days here last
week a group of 14 experts and observers
tried to figure out what had happened to it
and whether it will soon be revived.
The meeting at the Lyndon B. Johnson
School of Public Affairs had the flavor of a
Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony. These
particular lights have been turned off since
the SALT II treaty died after the Soviet army
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979.
Turning them on again made the eyes
blink.
The conference here demonstrated that
American arms-control specialists have
got used to the fact that the national con
sensus that made 10 years of SALT possible
has collapsed, leaving the country deeply
divided about the purposes of nuclear
weapons and the best ways to limit the un
precedented dangers these weapons pose.
The wreckage of that consensus has left
an odd division of opinion about the
future prospects for formal agreements to
limit nuclear arms. Representatives of the
Reagan administration insisted here that
new progress is possible and that signs of
progress would soon be visible.
George Bundy, John F. Kennedy's na
tional-security adviser and formerly presi
dent of the Ford Foundation, said he didn't
think so. "The prospects for new arms
control agreements in the next five years
are very low," Bundy said. New American

weapons programs would complicate any
chances of success, he added.
But Paul Warnke, the principal nego
tiator of SALT II and a man who has often
been vilified by conservative opponentsof
that treaty, many of them members of the
Reagan administration, was much more
hopeful. Arms control is "an unnatural
act," Warnke observed, but there is still
momentum behind it.
He suggested that the current "In
termediate Nuclear Forces" negotiations
in Geneva, aimed at limiting nuclear weap
ons deployed in Europe, really amount to a
resumption of the SALT talks, or START
talks in the Reagan administration's pre
ferred acronym, standing for Strategic
Arms Reduction Talks.

tration's interest in the European talks may
