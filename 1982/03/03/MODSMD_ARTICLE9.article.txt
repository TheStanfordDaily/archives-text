# Studies indicate alarming rise in crime

### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Crime has
grown at a rapid rate in all of
America's cities, regardless of
their size, location, minority
populations or whether they
are gaining or losing popu
lation.
It no longer is a local prob
lem to be dealt with on a local
level but is a nationwide
phenomenon growing at
almost the same rate from Long
Island to Los Angeles, beyond
the control of local govern
ments.
These are some of the sur
prising conclusions of a 3V2-
year study done for the Justice
Department by Northwestern
University's Center for Urban

Affairs and Policy Research.
"The growth of crime ap
pears to be the result of fun
damental changes in the life
styles of Americans," write Drs.
Herbert Jacob and Robert
Lineberry, who conducted the
$923,000 study for the National
Institute of Justice. "It is the re
sult of greater affluence which
made more valuable goods
available for theft, a condition
aggravated by the greater pro
pensity of Americans to leave
goods unguarded in empty
homes and expose themselves
to dangerous situations in trav
eling around their cities.
"It is also the consequence,"
Jacob and Lineberry go on, "of
there being a larger pool of

potential offenders for reasons
not well understood by crimi
nologists."
The result of all this, the two
political scientists say, is that
"crime has surged everywhere
in the United States regardless
of local efforts to stem the
flood tide. Whether local of
ficials engaged in herculean ef
forts or none at all, the crime
wave affected their communi
ty-"
The Northwestern study cov
ers the 31 years from 1948
through 1978 and involves 396
cities, every city in the country
with more than 50,000 resi
dents. In-depth studies were
done of 10 cities, those with de
clining populations such as
Newark, Philadelphia and Bos
ton, booming dynamos such as
Phoenix, Houston and San
Jose, distressed cities such as
Atlanta and Oakland and rela

tively well-off cities.
Jacob and Lineberry say their
study shows a remarkably simi
lar rise in crime rates for cities
that bear no resemblance to
each other: "Both the Newarks
and the Houstons of the United
States experienced substantial
rises in their reported crime
rates. Those increases,
moreover, occurred at about
the same time and with the
same velocity for all kinds of
cities."
All 10 cities studied in depth
suffered huge increases in their
crime rates over the three dec
ades covered. Newark suffered
the most, a sevenfold increase
in property crime and an elev
enfold rise in violent crime. But
the thriving cities of San jose
and Phoenix saw property
crime more than double and
violent crime more than quad
ruple.
