# Burma attacks Buddhist ways
## 
### Washington Post 
Sagaing, Burma â€” As the rising sun glints
off the white pagodas dotting the hills of
this town in central Burma, a steamy mist
rises from the plain below, mingling with
the smoke from a thousand fires.
A Buddhist monk surveying the scene by
the banks of the Irrawaddy River softly
chants a prayer as the strains of Burmese
music waft from the town below and
people begin preparing the dawn meal for
the area's 11,000 monks.
But the serenity of Sagaing, considered
the religious center of what is probably the
most devoutly Buddhist country in the
world, belies a certain ferment in the Bur
mese monk community these days. In a
purge backed by Burma's socialist gov
ernment, unorthodox doctrines have
been put on trial and monks have been
defrocked for unbecoming conduct.
The purge seems to have widespread
support, for the 100,000 Burmese monks
had acquired a reputation for harboring
loafers content to live off charity and to
engage in some less-than-devout activities
on the side.
On the other hand, some Burmese seem
to have misgivings about what they see as

government involvement in religious mat
ters. They argue that a heretical or just
plain bad monk will get his just deserts in
the next life, according to Buddhist doc
trine.
In any event, the court cases have
aroused great interest among Burma's 85
percent Buddhist population, although
some of the trials involve doctrinal points
that even the devout find difficult to fol
low.
Ihe interest illustrates the central place
that Buddhism occupies in Burmese life.
Although the government is resolutely
socialist and secular, the faith permeates
its guiding philosophy, called "The Bur
mese way to socialism."
"Burma is a different socialist country
than any other," a Western diplomat in
Rangoon commented. "The Burmese way
to socialism is the Buddhist way to
socialism. Buddhism comes first."
In the view of some foreign and Bur
mese observers, the faith may explain
some of the recent actions of Burma's
leader, Ne Win, 70, who resigned last year
as president but still runs the country as
head of the ruling political party.

Because of the reclusiveness of Ne Win
and his government officials, his actions
seem to spawn much guesswork and
rumor in diplomatic circles. One of the
more intriguing rumors, which has gained
a certain currency in the capital, has it that
religious concerns influenced Ne Win's
1980 declaration of an amnesty for his
political opponents.
"He's probably a late convert to Buddh
ism and wanted to clear his slate before he
dies," a diplomat said. According to
another account, a soothsayer told the
former general he was heading for a fall,
prompting him to enter a monastery for a
few days before reaching his decision to
declare an amnesty.
In any case, the amnesty and the purge
of the monks are generally regarded as
triumphs for Ne Win.
According to U San Daw Batha, the head
monk in a large monastery in Anarapura
across the river from Sagaing, "Ne Win is a
very religious man." The 60-year-old
monk, who said he knows Ne Win person
ally, added that "we have a socialist state
here, but it has nothing to do with relig
ion."
