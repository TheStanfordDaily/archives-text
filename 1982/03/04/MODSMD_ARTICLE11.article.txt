# China closes communes
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Peking — China is beginning to abolish the
system of rural people's communes that the late
Chairman Mao Tse-tung launched almost 25
years ago to bring communism to the Chinese
countryside.
More than 100 rural communes have been
ordered disestablished already this year on an
experimental basis and, depending on the re
sults, virtually all 52,000 communes could be
transformed in the next two to three years.
Elected township governments are to take
over the communes'administrative and political
functions, typically governing half a dozen vil
lages with combined populations of 35,000 to
40,000. Newly-tormed farmers cooperatives are
already taking over most ot the communes'
economic responsibilities.
It carried out as planned, this transformation
ot the commune system will materially affect the
daily lives of 800 million Chinese peasants —
how they farm, their earnings and how they
spend it, where their children study and work —
and should reinforce and accelerate the rural
reforms, initiated three years ago, that are start
ing to bring prosperity to much of the coun
tryside.
Communes are now the basic unit of govern
ment in China's rural areas, administering the
affairs of several villages and overseeing agricul
tural production. They also operate small fac
tories and mills, provide social services, run
local schools and help build public works pro
jects. The average commune has about 15,000
peasants — roughly 3400 families — and is di
vided into production brigades, each usually a
single hamlet, and production teams, grouping
about 30 families. As originally conceived by
Mao, they were to be the basis for the model
society he believed communism would create in
China.

Resistance to their abolition is likely, how
ever, by the ideologically orthodox, who see
abandonment of the communes a reversal of
socialism's achievements in China and by com
mune officials who will find themselves without
jobs.
But the move has the support of Deng Xiaop
ing, the Communist Party's powerful vice
chairman, who regarded Mao's communes as a
mistake when they were introduced in 1958, and
their disestablishment is being overseen by
Premier Zhao Ziyangand his top deputy, Wan Li,
who began the rural reforms as provincial leader
in 1978 and 1979.
Communes in Sichuan province in south
western China, where Zhao had been party
leader, and in East China's Anhui province,
where Wan was leader, are reverting on a
selected basis to the Xiang township system that
existed before Mao established the people's
communes.
Peasants will farm their land, which will re
main collectively owned, in small groups, often
family-based, and join with other peasants from
their own and neighboring hamlets to process
and market their crops, buy tractors and other
machinery and build and maintain roads and
irrigation systems.
Small rural industries that have been estab
lished under the communes will either become
collectively owned enterprises or be turned
over to the new township governments. Some
will be developed into rural agricultural
industrial-commercial complexes and largely
Ireed from all government administration.
Similar experiments are beginning this month
and next, informed sources said, in Fujian,
Guangdong, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, Kuangsu,
Shandong, Shanxi and Yunnan provinces and
outside the cities of Peking and Shanghai. The
sources said that communes in about 20 pro
vinces will be involved by midyear.
