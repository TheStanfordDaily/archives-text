# Moscow airs spring fashion line

### Associated Press 
Moscow — The mirrored
hall on the third floor of Mos
cow's largest department store
on Red Square looked more
like the setting for a Com
munist Party rally than a stage
for the new spring fashions.
Slogans on bright red ban
ners greeted the Soviet armed
forces and praised the current

economic five-year-plan.
"Hemlines will move up, but
knees will be mostly covered,"
a woman announced gravely
trom the stage. The audience
appeared bored by the wo
man's brief, introductory re
marks.
After paying a fee equivalent
to 70 cents, the audience —
mostly stout middle-aged

women with their fur hats on —
waited for the sound of West
ern disco music that signalled
the start of the show at GUM,
the state department store
More than 70 coats, suits,
dresses and evening gowns
were shown by half a dozen tall
young women and two older
women trying desperately to
keep their balance on four
inch stiletto heels.
Applause was scarce and
seemed meant more as an en
couragement for the models
than approval of what they
wore. Invariably cheered were
the two shy, ample-bosomed
women in their 50s who
blushed almost every time they
appeared on the runway.
The dresses shown at the
GUM show would be hard to
find in a fashion show in the
West.
