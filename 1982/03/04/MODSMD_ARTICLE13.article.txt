## The 						handicapped: Physically limited students overcome the many barriers of collegiate life 
### Jane McConnell 
The biggest problem with the University's program for physi
cally limited students is that there is no such program, according
toa University consultant on planningfor handicapped facilities.
"The University doesn't seem all that interested in having dis
abled students here," said Consultant Nick Zirpolo, a graduate
student here.
Currently thereare2l students considered physically limited at
Stanford — a low figure in comparison with schools like Berkeley,
which has close to 150 disabled students. "Despite the fact that
according to a study done last year Stanford is one of the most
physically accessible campuses for handicapped students, we
don't have nearly as live a handicapped program as most other

'The University doesn't seem all that
interested in having disabled students
here. . . . Despite the fact that according
to a study done last year, Stanford is one
of the most physically accessible
campuses for handicapped students, we
don't have nearly as live a handicapped
program as most other schools/

schools," said Zirpolo.
The main reason that Stanford does not have a "live" hand
icapped program is the low number of handicapped students
here. While this number is low, it is in turn, a reflection of the
weakness of the program. "It's a Catch-22 situation," said
Thomas Massey, coordinator of the services for the physically
limited. "We don't have a very big program because there aren't
many students who need it, but until we get more students who
need it, we won't be able to expand the program,"
The University's current approach towards handicapped stu
dents is not to contact them, but rather to let them contact the
University if they desire assistance. "We ask them to identify
themselves," said Massey. "We don't seek them out."
This approach can cause problems for tHe disabled Zirpolo said
he feels. "It's very difficult for them to have to go through the
whole process when they don't really have a precedent to fol
low," he said.
Zirpolo said he believes that the admissions process needs to
be examined. "There is no outreach in admissions towards dis
abled students as there is to, say, blacks."
The University maintains a policy of not recruiting
however, there is an effort to contact certain groups, among
which handicapped students are not included. "The problem
with contacting physically limited students is that you don't find

many in the regular school system, and the University makes no
outreach to specialized schools," said Tanya Austen, graduate
coordinator for the physically limited student services. "Many
physically limited students don't bother to apply to Stanford
because they feel that they wouldn't be welcome at this kind of
University, or that they couldn't cope."
Massey accounted for this differently. "The University doesn't
make special dispensations in admissions, and the high standards
just weed out most handicapped sfudents. Much of their lives aire
a struggle to overcome their handicap, which consumes a lot of
energy. It's an extremely diligent student who can accomodate a
system which doesn't accomodate them, and can compete with
able-bodied students." if
However, a physical limitation will not count against a student
in admissions. Said Massey, "It's taken into account just as any
special consideration is. It's looked at as a triumph over adversity,
but at the same time there is a concern that as to whether the
handicapped student will be able to manipulate the academic
environment."
Once handicapped students have been accepted to Stanford,
they are basically on their own. If, however, they face problems;
they can contact the Committee on Services for the Physically

Limited.
The committee responds to the needs of the handicapped by
providing equipment, arranging placement in accessible ,ms
and classrooms, coordinating a special orientation and registra
tion procedure, and helping with career planning and placement.
In addition, the committee is currently working on programatic
access — making student events accessible to handicapped stu
dents.
Also working on program access for the disabled is affirmative
action specialist, Bill Sideman. "Our policy is that if a student is
qualified for a program he or she shouldn't be exempt because of
a physical limitation. We try to make reasonable accomodations,
such as shifting classes around, buying special equipment, and
working with professors," Sideman said.
In addition to program accessibility, the University also recog
nizes a need for physical accessibility. The point of this, accord
ing to Zirpolo, is so that segregating isn't enforced by architec
tural barriers. Existing facilities include wheelchair ramps, gym
nasium modification, handicapped parking areas, and residence
modifications.
Besides physical barriers, handicapped students also face a
social barrier in the lack of awareness of the student body. "It's
hard to stay aware when you don't see that many physically
limited students," Austen said. "Thereare so many little things to
be remembered, and often the physically limited feel awkward
having to have their needs catered to when they are one among
so many.
"There needs to be an increased awareness of their capabilities
— a redefinition of normality," added Massey. Zirpolo agreed,
"Many times people just assume that handicapped students
don't want to or can't do certain things, when they really can."
There is also a common assumption that physically limited
students are mentally limited as well. Dr. David Kaplan of the
Help Center noted, "There is a feeling that somehow handicap
ped people are less than human, when their real limitations come
not from their handicap but from society."
To broaden the awareness, of the student body Kaplan will
offer a class this spring entitled "Human problems with physical
limitations/differences: barriers and change strategy."
The course, which was designed by Provost Al Hastorf and has
been very popular in past years, will be taught by panels of
disabled students and lecturers dealing with such topics as com
pensation devices for mitigating disabilities, plastic surgery, and
the ethical issues of babies born with defects.

University if they desire assistance. "We ask them to identify
themselves," said Massey. "We don't seek them out."
This approach can cause problems for tHe disabled Zirpolo said
he feels. "It's very difficult for them to have to go through the
whole process when they don't really have a precedent to fol
low," he said.
Zirpolo said he believes that the admissions process needs to
be examined. "There is no outreach in admissions towards dis
abled students as there is to, say, blacks."
The University maintains a policy of not recruiting
however, there is an effort to contact certain groups, among
which handicapped students are not included. "The problem
with contacting physically limited students is that you don't find

It's a catch-22 situation. We don't have a
very big program because there aren't
many students who need it, but until we
get more students who need it we won 't
be able to expand the program/

many in the regular school system, and the University makes no
outreach to specialized schools," said Tanya Austen, graduate
coordinator for the physically limited student services. "Many
physically limited students don't bother to apply to Stanford
because they feel that they wouldn't be welcome at this kind of
University, or that they couldn't cope."
Massey accounted for this differently. "The University doesn't
make special dispensations in admissions, and the high standards
just weed out most handicapped sfudents. Much of their lives aire
a struggle to overcome their handicap, which consumes a lot of
energy. It's an extremely diligent student who can accomodate a
system which doesn't accomodate them, and can compete with
able-bodied students." if
However, a physical limitation will not count against a student
in admissions. Said Massey, "It's taken into account just as any
special consideration is. It's looked at as a triumph over adversity,
but at the same time there is a concern that as to whether the
handicapped student will be able to manipulate the academic
environment."
Once handicapped students have been accepted to Stanford,
they are basically on their own. If, however, they face problems;
they can contact the Committee on Services for the Physically

Limited.
The committee responds to the needs of the handicapped by
providing equipment, arranging placement in accessible ,ms
and classrooms, coordinating a special orientation and registra
tion procedure, and helping with career planning and placement.
In addition, the committee is currently working on programatic
access — making student events accessible to handicapped stu
dents.
Also working on program access for the disabled is affirmative
action specialist, Bill Sideman. "Our policy is that if a student is
qualified for a program he or she shouldn't be exempt because of
a physical limitation. We try to make reasonable accomodations,
such as shifting classes around, buying special equipment, and
working with professors," Sideman said.
In addition to program accessibility, the University also recog
nizes a need for physical accessibility. The point of this, accord
ing to Zirpolo, is so that segregating isn't enforced by architec
tural barriers. Existing facilities include wheelchair ramps, gym
nasium modification, handicapped parking areas, and residence
modifications.
Besides physical barriers, handicapped students also face a
social barrier in the lack of awareness of the student body. "It's
hard to stay aware when you don't see that many physically
limited students," Austen said. "Thereare so many little things to
be remembered, and often the physically limited feel awkward
having to have their needs catered to when they are one among
so many.
"There needs to be an increased awareness of their capabilities
— a redefinition of normality," added Massey. Zirpolo agreed,
"Many times people just assume that handicapped students
don't want to or can't do certain things, when they really can."
There is also a common assumption that physically limited
students are mentally limited as well. Dr. David Kaplan of the
Help Center noted, "There is a feeling that somehow handicap
ped people are less than human, when their real limitations come
not from their handicap but from society."
To broaden the awareness, of the student body Kaplan will
offer a class this spring entitled "Human problems with physical
limitations/differences: barriers and change strategy."
The course, which was designed by Provost Al Hastorf and has
been very popular in past years, will be taught by panels of
disabled students and lecturers dealing with such topics as com
pensation devices for mitigating disabilities, plastic surgery, and
the ethical issues of babies born with defects.

The biggest problem with the University's program for physi
cally limited students is that there is no such program, according
toa University consultant on planningfor handicapped facilities.
"The University doesn't seem all that interested in having dis
abled students here," said Consultant Nick Zirpolo, a graduate
student here.
Currently thereare2l students considered physically limited at
Stanford — a low figure in comparison with schools like Berkeley,
which has close to 150 disabled students. "Despite the fact that
