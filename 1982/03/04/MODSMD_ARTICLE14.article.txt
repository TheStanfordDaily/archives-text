# Blind ambition

Sophomore Connie Conley has skied her
way to international competition in Switzer
land — an amazing feat when you consider
that she is blind.
Conley won the title of national blind ski
ing champion this winter in Michigan, after
taking gold medals in the slalom and giant
slalom events. She will represent the United
States MarcVi 7-18.
Considered legally blind, Conley does
have 20/200 vision in her right eye. With a
guide Skiing in front of her, wearing some
thing bright, she is able to follow the course.
"I can't see the gates or the moguls, but
I've gotten pretty good at following some
one's tracks," she says.
Conley has been skiing since she was nine
years old, and in recent years has always
trained with the sameguide. "She (theguide)
has learned to predict my reaction times. It
requires a lot of trust to follow her."
When : he skis crowded areas, Conley
wears some kind of identification labeling
her as a blind skier, and most people watch
out for her.
She can follow almost anyone who skis in
control, and even skis by herself on occasion.
"I'll ski on anything — I can't see it anyway!"
Conley is equally daring on campus, and
often rides her bike to and from class. "I rely
on rhy hearing. It's pretty suicidal, but if it
gets too crowded I get off and walk," she
said.
When she first got here, it took her awhile
to learn her way around campus, but now she

has routes well memorized. "It took me
about four weeks to get my bearings. I found
that I learned to get some places better by
getting lost and finding them myself rather
than having someone take me there."
"There are lots ol places where I still get
lost. It's especially hard at night," she adds.
Besides getting around, Conley also has
problems keeping up in her classes. "It takes
me so much longer VV\ar\ most peop\e >o gel
everything done. Last quarter I took 20 units
and I was constantly having to nerd out."
"It's a lot harder for me to get good grades
here than it was in high school," she said.
"My high school had a really good program
for the blind, but here you're basically on
your own."
Conley cannot see the board at all in class,
and usually asks teachers to repeat aloud
what they have written on the board. "Most
teachers do it if they can remember. It's hard,
though, because they don't realize how little
I can see. It takes tham a long time to under
stand my problem."
Most books she listens to on tape. One
problem, however, is that the tapes take
three to four weeks to order, and often don't
arrive in time for a class.
"In some cases I get someone to read to
me, or use a visual reader, which blows up
the print," Conley said. "If nothing else
works I just squint."
Conley feels that the student body here is
very helpful. "People can't tell I'm blind by
just looking at me, but once they figure it out
they're very willing to help me out."
