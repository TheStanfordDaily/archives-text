# Life in a wheelchair
## 
### Adam Goodman 
Freshman John Brennan's
second night here was a dif
ficult one.
That night he decided to at
tend a party at Toyon on cam
pus. He rode over to the party
in his wheelchair only to find
no handicapped access in
which to enter. Leaving his
chair parked outside, Brennan
had to use his crutches to get
in.
When he later came back out
to leave the party, he found his
wheelchair had disappeared.
About 3 a.m. police found
another student joyriding in
Brennan's chair on the other
side of the campus.
Though most handicapped
students probably do not have
their wheelchairs stolen, col
lege life for a handicapped stu
dent may be more problematic
than most people realize.
It was 11 years ago that Bren
nan was riding his bicycle in
front of his neighbor's home in
Hartland, Wise., when he was
struck by a car. Ever since, he
has been confined to a wheel
chair.
For a student in a wheel
chair, even being on time to
classes scattered across cam
pus can prove quite difficult.
However, Brennan thinks he
may have found a solution to
that problem. He lets someone
on a bicycle pull him around
campus.
And so friends of Brennan
have been towing him along
between classes for the past

five months. "I've only wiped
out once and have a pretty
good track record," he said.
While Brennan had been
satisitied with the accessibility
of Stanford's classrooms, he
said he sees opportunity for
improvement in the universi
ty's student residences. Bren
nan criticized Stanford's build
ing program in regard to pro
viding adequate handicapped
facilities.
"They really shouldn't sit
back and say "we're done" be
cause they've only done more
temporary measures. Even
when they redid Storey House
they redid the whole thing and
decided not to put in an
elevator. It's supposed to be a
handicapped house but a
handicapped person could not
even go up to the second floor
and see anyone else," he said,
referring to the University's
most recent renovation pro
ject. Storey House is to have
special rooms on the first floor
for handicapped students.
Brennan'said he has no trou
ble entering his own dorm and
his first-floor room, but the
problem is when he wants to
go visit friends in another
dorm. "Just try getting in one,"
he said. "You better not have
any friends who live on the
second floor or even one step
up.
"Since I have my crutches I
can get around. If I couldn't
use them I wouldn't be too
happy at all."
The library is another place
that Brennan said he has trou
ble entering. He blamed the

problem on bikes blocking the
wheelchair ramp.
"Almost every night I can't
get through. I haven't com
plained to Greene (personnel)
or anyone else though," he
said. "If I go with somebody I
have them move the bikes and
if I'm alone, I try to move them
myself or ask someone around
to help."
Overall, Brennan said he has
enjoyed his first year at Stan
ford so far and "certainly
wouldn't put the year at a
minus.
"I don't feel excluded in any
dorm activities," he said.
Other advantages the Ifi
year-old has found away from
his home in Wisconsin are "be
ing out of snow and being able
to traverse the campus." How
ever, Brennan said he does
miss driving a car, which he can
do at home by using hand con
trols.
"When everything is as far
off campus as it is here, then
even to go to the shopping
center you might as well take a
backpack and a tent,'' he said.
Brennan said other students
often offer their aid by being
considerate, polite and help
ful. "People I don't even know
pull up to me in my wheelchair
and ask it I'd like a tow."
Currently Brennan said he
plans on majoring in
economics and possibly going
on to business or law school.
He said he does not let his
handicap get in his way.
"I try to make nothing of it. If
you do that other people will
act as if it is nothing too."
