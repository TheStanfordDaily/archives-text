## Editorial Praise for a good job 
### 
They're playing musical chairs at the ASSU offices
these days â€” project managers and presidents, business
managers and senators, all seem to be spending their
days in meetings, formulating next year's rosters and
preparing to run or apply for different jobs on the politi
cal fronts.
One of the first appointments announced was that of
associate business manager for the ASSU. The position
was awarded to Business School student Victor Heinz.
Heinz will spend spring quarter training under the gui
dance of current Financial Manager Cynthia Mathewson
and will likely receive the endorsement of the senate to
become official financial manager for next year.
The selection committee, composed of Council of
Presidents members Chris Greene and Fred Buhl, Rules
Committee Chairman ]im McCrath and Financial Com
mittee Chairman Mark Epstein, was faced with a unique
and difficult task posed by receipt of an application from
Mathewson herself. While this situation was not an un
precedented event, Mathewson forced the committee
to weigh options above and beyond the usual criteria of

experience and potential.
Those in the ASSU this year have lauded Mathewson
for bringing the financial manager back into the
mainstream of the ASSU, especially in regard to involv
ing the COP and senate in budget negotiations with the
University. The fine job she did and the experience she
gained forced a choice between her and Heinz, whose
qualifications and experience were very impressive as
well.
The committee decided to go with Heinz, noting that
one function of a student position such as financial man
ager is to provide an educational opportunity for stu
dents here, a goal which would be thwarted by allowing
even a capable and qualified person such as Mathewson
to repeat her term.
We support this rationale behind the selection pro
cess and hope the various selection committees con
tinue to display this kind of sound reasoning. We also
appreciate Mathewson's contributions to the ASSU this
year, and her offer to continue serving the student body.
Thanks, Cynthia.
