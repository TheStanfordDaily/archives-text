# Ron plays Beat the Press
## 
### 
"Good evening, ladies and gent
lemen, and welcome to Beat the
Press. I'm Bob Parker, and I'll be the
moderator as our panel of press re
porters challenges our contestant's
knowledge of basic national and in
ternational issues. Johnny, who'sour
next contestant?"
"Bob, our next contestant is an el
derly actorfrom sunny California . . .
Ronald Reagan, come on down!"
"Now, Ron, as you know, you'll
have to answer questions from our
panel of reporters as they attempt to
trap you into making gross factual
errors and exhibiting a dangerous
lack of knowledge on major policy
issues. Are you ready, Ron?"
"I sure am, Bob. My advisers and I
have been preparing for this all
week, and I really feel that I've got
everything right this time. Why, it
reminds me of a time when I was
rehearsing my lines for Bedtime for
Bonzo and I. . .
"Great. We'll have Dick start the
ba\\ roWtng w'Uh our V\rst question.
Dick?"
"Thanks, Bob. Now, Ron, my first
question is 'Do you still think that the
economy will start to strongly move
out of its recession in the late spring
and early summer as you and your
advisers have predicted'?"
"Well, Dick, let me say that I think
that in the months ahead and in the
coming year we'll see the recession
bottom out."
"Good answer, Ron. I see our
panel is giving you five points in the
'Vague Backtracking to a Meaning
less Generality' category. Now for a
question with a bonus point follow
up from a member of our panel.
Tom?"
"Right. I'd like to know if Ron
could tell us under what cir
cumstances he would consider send
ing U.S. troops to El Salvador?"
"As you know, Tom, I just don't
think its right for me to discuss any of
my options in advance of doing
them. that if they drop
ped a bomb on the White House I

might get mad."
"Good answer, Ron. We'll give
you five points for 'Standard Evasion'
and another five in the 'Disarming
but not Very Funy Joke' category.
Tom?"
"Yes, I'd like to follow up by as king
if the U.S. is undertaking or con
templating covert actions against
Nicaragua?"
"Well, no, we're supporting them,
the — oh, wait a minute, wait a mi
nute, I'm sorry, I was thinking El Sal
vador, because of the previous ques
tion, when you said Nicaragua. Here
again, this is something upon which
national security interests, I just — I
will not comment. Next week I'll be
addressing the Organization of
American States on Central America,
and I'll save answers on such ques
tions until then."
"Ron, I'm afraid that we'll have to
deduct five points in the 'Harmless
Error That Looks Bad in an Aging
Man' category, but it looks like

'As you know, Tom, I just don't think it's right for
me to discuss any of my options in advance of
doing them. Let's just say that if they dropped a
bomb on the White House I might get mad.'
'Good answer, Ron. We'll give you five points for
'Standard Evasion' and another five in the
'Disarming but not Very Funny Joke' category/

you've earned five points for 'Post
poning a Question to the Future
when it won't be Answered.' Sarah?"
"Yes, I'd like to ask if there is any
possibility that the government or
the CIA might surreptitiously in
crease U.S. involvement in El Sal
vador as it did in Vietnam?"
"Well, Sarah, I'm not in total ag
reement about the premise about
Vietnam. As you know, the U.S.
openly sent advisors to Vietnam and
then only escalated its involvement
when advisers were attacked by
people there, and then Kennedy sent
ina division of marines, so I don't see
any relation to our advisers in El Sal
vador."
"Ron, I'm sorry, but it looks like a
five point deduction for 'Faulty Use
of a Historical Analogy' and 10 points

for 'Cross Factual Error' since it was
Johnson who sent in the marines.
That brings your point total to zero as
we come to the critical final ques
tion, a question selected especially
for you by our panel. Johnny, what
do we have for Ron if he correctly
answers our final question?"
"Bob, if Ron gets this question,
he'll win . . .a one-way trip to El Sal
vador! Yes, Ron, you could soon be
spending over $300 million of the
taxpayers money in this beautiful lit
tle war-torn country in what could
prove to be the most memorable
foreign policy debacle of the decade.
Bob?"
"OK, Ron, here's the Big Ques
tion: Do you really think you're qual
ified to run the economy and the
foreign policy of the most powerful
country in the world?"
"Well, Bob, as you know, that
question is under review and discus
sion in my administration and in
Congress, and I'd rather not answer

that until I have a chance to study it
further."
"Folks, it looks like we have a
Grand Prize winner here. I'm afraid
that's all we have timefor, and I hope
we'll see you next time when we play
Beat the Press."

'Disarming but not Very Funny Joke' category/

you've earned five points for 'Post
poning a Question to the Future
when it won't be Answered.' Sarah?"
"Yes, I'd like to ask if there is any
possibility that the government or
the CIA might surreptitiously in
crease U.S. involvement in El Sal
vador as it did in Vietnam?"
"Well, Sarah, I'm not in total ag
reement about the premise about
Vietnam. As you know, the U.S.
openly sent advisors to Vietnam and
then only escalated its involvement
when advisers were attacked by
people there, and then Kennedy sent
ina division of marines, so I don't see
any relation to our advisers in El Sal
vador."
"Ron, I'm sorry, but it looks like a
five point deduction for 'Faulty Use
of a Historical Analogy' and 10 points

for 'Cross Factual Error' since it was
Johnson who sent in the marines.
That brings your point total to zero as
we come to the critical final ques
tion, a question selected especially
for you by our panel. Johnny, what
do we have for Ron if he correctly
answers our final question?"
"Bob, if Ron gets this question,
he'll win . . .a one-way trip to El Sal
vador! Yes, Ron, you could soon be
spending over $300 million of the
taxpayers money in this beautiful lit
tle war-torn country in what could
prove to be the most memorable
foreign policy debacle of the decade.
Bob?"
"OK, Ron, here's the Big Ques
tion: Do you really think you're qual
ified to run the economy and the
foreign policy of the most powerful
country in the world?"
"Well, Bob, as you know, that
question is under review and discus
sion in my administration and in
Congress, and I'd rather not answer

that until I have a chance to study it
further."
"Folks, it looks like we have a
Grand Prize winner here. I'm afraid
that's all we have timefor, and I hope
we'll see you next time when we play
Beat the Press."

"Good evening, ladies and gent
lemen, and welcome to Beat the
Press. I'm Bob Parker, and I'll be the
moderator as our panel of press re
porters challenges our contestant's
knowledge of basic national and in
ternational issues. Johnny, who'sour
next contestant?"
"Bob, our next contestant is an el
derly actorfrom sunny California . . .
Ronald Reagan, come on down!"
"Now, Ron, as you know, you'll
have to answer questions from our
panel of reporters as they attempt to
trap you into making gross factual
errors and exhibiting a dangerous
lack of knowledge on major policy
issues. Are you ready, Ron?"
"I sure am, Bob. My advisers and I
have been preparing for this all
week, and I really feel that I've got
everything right this time. Why, it
reminds me of a time when I was
rehearsing my lines for Bedtime for
Bonzo and I. . .
"Great. We'll have Dick start the
ba\\ roWtng w'Uh our V\rst question.
Dick?"
"Thanks, Bob. Now, Ron, my first
question is 'Do you still think that the
economy will start to strongly move
out of its recession in the late spring
and early summer as you and your
advisers have predicted'?"
"Well, Dick, let me say that I think
that in the months ahead and in the
coming year we'll see the recession
bottom out."
"Good answer, Ron. I see our
panel is giving you five points in the
'Vague Backtracking to a Meaning
less Generality' category. Now for a
question with a bonus point follow
up from a member of our panel.
Tom?"
"Right. I'd like to know if Ron
could tell us under what cir
cumstances he would consider send
ing U.S. troops to El Salvador?"
"As you know, Tom, I just don't
think its right for me to discuss any of
my options in advance of doing
them. that if they drop
ped a bomb on the White House I

might get mad."
"Good answer, Ron. We'll give
you five points for 'Standard Evasion'
and another five in the 'Disarming
but not Very Funy Joke' category.
Tom?"
"Yes, I'd like to follow up by as king
if the U.S. is undertaking or con
templating covert actions against
Nicaragua?"
"Well, no, we're supporting them,
the — oh, wait a minute, wait a mi
nute, I'm sorry, I was thinking El Sal
vador, because of the previous ques
tion, when you said Nicaragua. Here
again, this is something upon which
national security interests, I just — I
will not comment. Next week I'll be
addressing the Organization of
American States on Central America,
and I'll save answers on such ques

deduct five points in the 'Harmless
Error That Looks Bad in an Aging
Man' category, but it looks like
