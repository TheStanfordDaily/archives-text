# Wells Fargo savers alerted to service charge changes
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
People with savings accounts at
Wells Fargo Bank will have to keep
their accounts well stocked if they
want to avoid additional charges.
Wells Fargo Bank recently an
nounced to its customers that begin
ning Apr. 1 a service charge of $2.00
will be assessed in each calendar
quarter that the customer's average
quarterly balance is less than $200.
Wells Fargo is among the last
banks in the area to institute such a
service charge, and has the lowest
charge among those banks.
Bank of America, Crocker Bank,
and First Interstate Bank on Jan. 1 all
instituted comparable charges for
savings accounts.
Both Bank of America and First In
terstate Bank charge its customers
$3.00 for each quarter that their
minumum balance falls below $200.
Crocker Bank charges $2.40.
The other new charge affects with
drawals from savings accounts. Cus
tomers will be charged 50 cents for
each Express Stop withdrawal and
$1.00 for each in-branch withdrawal
exceeding three per quarter.

Such withdrawal charges have also
been instituted at Bank of America,
which does not distinguish between
express and in-branch withdrawals.
Crocker Bank and First Interstate
Bank do not have such a charge, but
Security Pacific Bank does.
According to Jody Sloane, assistant
manager of the Stanford campus
branch of Wells Fargo, the service
charges have been implemented be
cause many people no longer use
savings accounts to save money, but
use them as transaction accounts.
"The new withdrawal charges are
designed to cut down on people
using savings accounts as checking
accounts," Sloan said.
When customers frequently with
draw money from their savings ac
counts, the bank cannot rely on that
money being available for loans, and
consequently cannot make money
on it.
"For people who are still having
savings accounts," she said, "there's
not going to be a charge. They'll put
their money in and leave it."
"When there was no charge on
savings accounts it was because
people put in money and left it there.

The bank knew it could lend it out."
The increase of postal rates has
also made the maintenance of sav
ings accounts morecostly. Banks rely
heavily on the postal service for the
mailing of Internal Revenue Service
forms, transaction updates and bank
statements.
The lower charge on Express Stop
withdrawals, Sloane said, is intended
to cut down on traffic inside the
bank. "We'd like to encourage use of
the machines in every instance pos
sible," Sloane said.
She said that approximately 10 sav
ings accounts per day have been
closed since the new charges were
announced.
"I don't feel that our charges are
out of line," she added. "Every
body's been hit by inflation." Sloane
explained that all banks saw their
profits on long-term real estate loans
dwindling as the interest rates bor
rowers paid remained fixed while
current interest rates, which the
bank must pay to borrow, increased
considerably. Asa result, banks have
had to create additional service
charges to meet financial losses.
