## Split roll property tax reform 
### 
There is emerging public consensus that 1982 is going
to be a big, big political year. Not only Jerry Brown, but
now Alan Cranston is thinking of running for president.
William Shockley is running for the Senate. Florence
Mac Donald is running as a peace candidate for state
controller.
Then there's the ERA countdown. There's the Nuclear
Free Initiative, setting up for the United Nations Special
Session on Disarmament. There's El Salvador. Poland. A
little closer to home, there's the Peripheral Canal; the
Bottle Bill; not to mention the Med-fly, whose season is
upon us once again. Add these to the first summer of the
Reagan policy impact, and there's no denying that this
will be a year of years.
With such an important agenda, it may seem odd that I
try to convince you that a property tax reform initiative
will be the most heated battle of the year in California.
Nevertheless, a coalition of homeowners, renters, pa
rents, teachers, students, senior citizens, public
employees and service recipients are backing the Split
Roll Tax Drive to qualify for the November 1982 ballot.
Powerful business interests such as the Manufacturers
Association and the Business Roundtable have vowed to
raise $50 million to stop this plan — an unheard of sum
even by today's standards. It is clear that some heavy
hitters are lining up early on the Split Roll. But what's the
fuss?
For the answer, we need to go back to 1978, when
Howard Jarvis began the tax revolt that still captures the
hearts of many people. In a smoke-and-mirrors act that
many believe inspired the Trojan Horse economic
policies of the current administration, Proposition 13
passed by a 2-to-1 margin, and threw the state into an
uproar.
— Prop. 13 was meant to give tax breaks to homeowners
and renters, they said — but instead big business has
gotten more than 2/3 of the benefits. California corpora
tions received over $6 million in tax breaks last year.
Market theory says that lower prices should have re
sulted. Dream on. . . .
— Sometimes we cut off the nose to spite the face. In an
effort to starve the bureaucracy, Prop. 13 actually closed
schools, libraries, firehouses, after-school centers,
sports for kids, senior centers and special education.
Since more women and minorities are employed in the
public service sector, Prop. 13 has had a negative effect
on affirmative action. I suppose it was only reasonable to
expect that the bureaucrats would cut back on services
insted of the bureaucracy.
— There is a major structural inequity written in the tax
laws. Property is reassessed for taxation when it changes

hands. Since homes turn over about once every seven
years (businesses change hands only once in 25 years),
business actually pays much less tax relative to the mar
ket value of the property.
Secondly, neighbors in equivalent houses, with the
same incomes, can pay drastically different taxes. The
house Jane bought in 1975 for $50,000 costs her $500 a
year in taxes, but when John bought an identical house
next door last month for $150,000, he was socked with a
$1500 a year tax. Triple the taxes for exactly the same fire,
school, police and library services.
So if we pay rent, own our homes, have kids in school,
get help from the Kidney foundation, want good fire
protection, or the libraries open, it is in our interests to
reform Prop. 13.
Now — what does the Split Roll initiative do to remedy
all this?
— Split Roll extends additional tax benefits to renters
and makes it easier to get them. This means at least $100
per year for single renters, $200 for couples or families
adding up to $250 million total for renters in California.
— Split Roll exempts from taxation 1/2 of John's increase
in value due to change in ownership, for residences
only. So that $1500 per year example would now read
$1000 per year. It doesn't eliminate the inequity, but it
lessens it substantially, and makes home buying easier
for the middle-income consumer.
— Split Roll will assess business property more regularly
than every 25 years to make sure business pays its fair
share of the burden.
— Split Roll sets the tax rate for commercial property at
1.33 percent (presently 1 percent), which allows
businesses to keep over half of their Prop. 13 windfall.,
Since pre-Jarvis taxes were 3 percent, there is no indica
tion that this 1/3 percent increase will cause businesses
to relocate or cut production.
— Split Roll puts almost $.5 billion into the state treas
ury, and $1.2 billion/year into local revenues for items
like school funding, handicapped services and fire pro
tection.
At Stanford a coalition of students, faculty, staff and
administrators is working to qualify the Split Roll initia
tive for the November 1982 ballot; 5000 signatures of
registered voters are needed from the Stanford com
munity by April 30.
We all have a stake in the passage of the Split Roll. Do
yourself a favor by picking up a petition at the table in
White Plaza.
