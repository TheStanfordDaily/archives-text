## Honor Code efficiency requires tight time limit 
### 
Kenneth Smith's letter, "No honor
code among premeds" (Daily, Feb.
23), raises several issues concerning
the Honor Code which I would like
to comment on.
Smith began his letter with the
rather broad statement that the
Honor Code is not being observed
and that it should therefore be
thoroughly revised or discarded. I
must point out that although the
Honor Code may not be observed
100 percent of the time, acceptance
and adherence to the code is the
general norm at Stanford. A survey of
students here last year showed that
the overwhelming majority of Stan
ford students are honest in their
academic work and that there is no
data to support the contention that
"a lot of cheating" goes on. Further
more, a study on academic dishon
esty nationwide by the Columbia
University Bureau of Applied Social
Research found that school quality
and academic honor systems are
both associated with lower levels of
cheating. They also found that Stan
ford compared favorably with the
other schools nationwide. In view of
this, we should seriously examine
the suggestions offered by Smith.
Abolishing the Honor Code is not
something to be considered without
careful thought. It would mean a re
turn to the proctoring system, which
many students object to because it
breeds an atmosphere of distrust and
restricts their freedom in such op
tions as taking an exam in the library
or on an alternate day. Also, we
should realize that there is more than
one way to cheat, and that the ab
sence of the Honor Code will by no
means guarantee total academic
honesty.
Instead of revising the Honor
Code, as Smith also suggested do
ing, it may make more sense to
propose that we revise our attitude

towards the code. Its implications
and importance to the Stanford
community should be stressed to all
students and faculty from the time
that they firstarrive. It should mean a
great deal more than a signature at
the bottom of the blue book. If both
the faculty and the students take an
active interest in making the Honor
Code work, then many of the
sporadic problems which occur
would be solved. Take the example
which Smith described of students
handing exams in five to 10 minutes
past the allowed time. All that is re
quired in that situation is that the in
structor state clearly when exams
must be turned in and, at the end of
the specified time period, leave the
exam room and strictly refuse to ac
cept late tests. This method has
proven to be extremely effective.
The real problem lies in getting the
faculty to realize that it is their re
sponsibility to implement such pro
cedures, and a reminder from the
students of the class is often suffi
cient to do so.
The Stanford Honor Code is work
ing now as it was designed to work —
it removes constraints caused by
suspicion and distrust. It would work
better, however, if we make a collec
tive effort to educate ourselves about
it and, most importantly, to act in the
spirit of the Honor Code.

Again. For what reason? And to what
effect? As a measure to focus atten
tion and educate the public concern
ing our national nuclear weapons
programs, it is only partially success

ful, neglecting the more important
problems of how to face the reality of
our present nuclear world.
Education and discussion are
necessary, there is no doubt. But it
must be rational and objective. The
immensity and importance of the
subject is too great to engage in per
sonal defamation or half-truths. Un
fortunately, this irrationality has
dominated the present nuclear
weapons debate here at Stanford.
Joe Walder's recent denunciation
of American civil defense policy is
representative of this one-sided
dialogue. While I agree that civil de
fense is hopelessly ineffective and
that "limited nuclear war" would be
potentially devastating, I do not con
cur with the personal denunciations
and overexaggerations Walder
employs to explain his misleading
characterization of American
strategic policy.
Walder, for instance, claims that
the American nuclear umbrella pro
tecting Western Europe and Japan
from Soviet attack is the direct result
of Dr. Edward Teller's personal ex
periences and world view. But this
neglects the fact that the policy con
tinues, and is advocated by govern
ment officials as United States de
claratory policy, even though Teller
does not occupy, and has never oc
cupied, a position within the gov
ernment which places responsibility
on him for this policy.
Rather, the nuclear umbrella is an
integral part of the collective security
arrangements with our allies and is
intimately related to our own na
tional security, not the opinions of an
Hungarian emigre. Walder neglects
to mention that this guarantee is the
result of a massive and continuous
Soviet conventional buildup which
leaves them with undisputed
superiority in Europe. Nor does he
propose alternatives to deal with this
situation.
Primarily, those blockading the

Livermore Lab advocate a position
which does not reflect the complex
ity of the present world. A world free
of nuclear weapons is certainly de
sirable, but the difficulties which
must be overcome could prove in
surmountable. Technology has
progressed to the point where sev
eral Third World nations either pos
sess, or will soon possess, their own
nuclear arsenals. The possibility of
terrorists armed with nuclear devices
is no longer to be fancifully dismis
sed. These prospects have frighten
ing consequences for international
stability. As proliferation continues,
disarmament negotiations become
infinitely more complex, if not im
possible.
We must understand that the na
ture of our world, in which sovereign
states rely on themselves for their
security, requires no less than total
nuclear disarmament before useful
programs designed to maintain our
security in such an unstable envi
ronment are ended. But is that goal
attainable? I doubt it. Nuclear
weapons have come to represent a
form of international power and pres
tige which many nations are unable
to attain through more traditional
economic, political and military
means. In such a world, we must
consider mutual arms control and
limitation and unilateral actions in
order to strengthen confidence in
our retaliatory capability. These un
ilateral actions include the efforts at
Livermore Labs to improve the relia
bility of our strategic deterrent and
decrease the probability of an acci
dental detonation. Regarding mutual
arms limitation, the continuing
Geneva Conference, which bilater
ally deals with tactical nuclear
weapons, is a good beginning; our
efforts can most effectively be di
rected toward the immediate com
mencement of the START talks.

surmountable. Technology has
progressed to the point where sev
eral Third World nations either pos
sess, or will soon possess, their own
nuclear arsenals. The possibility of
terrorists armed with nuclear devices
is no longer to be fancifully dismis
sed. These prospects have frighten
ing consequences for international
stability. As proliferation continues,
disarmament negotiations become
infinitely more complex, if not im
possible.
We must understand that the na
ture of our world, in which sovereign
states rely on themselves for their
security, requires no less than total
nuclear disarmament before useful
programs designed to maintain our
security in such an unstable envi
ronment are ended. But is that goal
attainable? I doubt it. Nuclear
weapons have come to represent a
form of international power and pres
tige which many nations are unable
to attain through more traditional
economic, political and military
means. In such a world, we must
consider mutual arms control and
limitation and unilateral actions in
order to strengthen confidence in
our retaliatory capability. These un
ilateral actions include the efforts at
Livermore Labs to improve the relia
bility of our strategic deterrent and
decrease the probability of an acci
dental detonation. Regarding mutual
arms limitation, the continuing
Geneva Conference, which bilater
ally deals with tactical nuclear
weapons, is a good beginning; our
efforts can most effectively be di

mencement of the START talks.

Kenneth Smith's letter, "No honor
code among premeds" (Daily, Feb.
23), raises several issues concerning
the Honor Code which I would like
to comment on.
Smith began his letter with the
rather broad statement that the
Honor Code is not being observed
and that it should therefore be
thoroughly revised or discarded. I
must point out that although the
Honor Code may not be observed
100 percent of the time, acceptance
and adherence to the code is the
general norm at Stanford. A survey of
students here last year showed that
the overwhelming majority of Stan
ford students are honest in their
academic work and that there is no
data to support the contention that
"a lot of cheating" goes on. Further
more, a study on academic dishon
esty nationwide by the Columbia
University Bureau of Applied Social
Research found that school quality
and academic honor systems are
both associated with lower levels of
cheating. They also found that Stan
ford compared favorably with the
other schools nationwide. In view of
this, we should seriously examine
the suggestions offered by Smith.
Abolishing the Honor Code is not
something to be considered without
careful thought. It would mean a re
turn to the proctoring system, which
many students object to because it
breeds an atmosphere of distrust and
restricts their freedom in such op
tions as taking an exam in the library
or on an alternate day. Also, we
should realize that there is more than
one way to cheat, and that the ab
sence of the Honor Code will by no
means guarantee total academic
honesty.
Instead of revising the Honor
Code, as Smith also suggested do
ing, it may make more sense to
propose that we revise our attitude

towards the code. Its implications
and importance to the Stanford
community should be stressed to all
students and faculty from the time
that they firstarrive. It should mean a
great deal more than a signature at
the bottom of the blue book. If both
the faculty and the students take an
active interest in making the Honor
Code work, then many of the
sporadic problems which occur
would be solved. Take the example
which Smith described of students
handing exams in five to 10 minutes
past the allowed time. All that is re
quired in that situation is that the in
structor state clearly when exams
must be turned in and, at the end of
the specified time period, leave the
exam room and strictly refuse to ac
cept late tests. This method has
proven to be extremely effective.
The real problem lies in getting the
faculty to realize that it is their re
sponsibility to implement such pro
cedures, and a reminder from the
students of the class is often suffi
cient to do so.
The Stanford Honor Code is work
ing now as it was designed to work —
it removes constraints caused by
suspicion and distrust. It would work
better, however, if we make a collec
tive effort to educate ourselves about
it and, most importantly, to act in the
spirit of the Honor Code.

Again. For what reason? And to what
effect? As a measure to focus atten
tion and educate the public concern
ing our national nuclear weapons
programs, it is only partially success

ful, neglecting the more important
problems of how to face the reality of
our present nuclear world.
Education and discussion are
necessary, there is no doubt. But it
must be rational and objective. The
immensity and importance of the
subject is too great to engage in per
sonal defamation or half-truths. Un
fortunately, this irrationality has
dominated the present nuclear
weapons debate here at Stanford.
Joe Walder's recent denunciation
of American civil defense policy is
representative of this one-sided
dialogue. While I agree that civil de
fense is hopelessly ineffective and
that "limited nuclear war" would be
potentially devastating, I do not con
cur with the personal denunciations
and overexaggerations Walder
employs to explain his misleading
characterization of American
strategic policy.
Walder, for instance, claims that
the American nuclear umbrella pro
tecting Western Europe and Japan
from Soviet attack is the direct result
of Dr. Edward Teller's personal ex
periences and world view. But this
neglects the fact that the policy con
tinues, and is advocated by govern
ment officials as United States de
claratory policy, even though Teller
does not occupy, and has never oc
cupied, a position within the gov
ernment which places responsibility
on him for this policy.
Rather, the nuclear umbrella is an
integral part of the collective security
arrangements with our allies and is
intimately related to our own na
tional security, not the opinions of an
Hungarian emigre. Walder neglects
to mention that this guarantee is the
result of a massive and continuous
Soviet conventional buildup which
leaves them with undisputed
superiority in Europe. Nor does he
propose alternatives to deal with this
situation.
Primarily, those blockading the

Livermore Lab advocate a position
which does not reflect the complex
ity of the present world. A world free
of nuclear weapons is certainly de
sirable, but the difficulties which
must be overcome could prove in
surmountable. Technology has
progressed to the point where sev
eral Third World nations either pos
sess, or will soon possess, their own
nuclear arsenals. The possibility of
