# Extension in question
## Voting rights a political issue 
### Patrick O'Reilly 
From the size of the crowd at the Vot
ing Rights Act symposium held last
week it wouldn't seem that the exten
sion of the act is one of the hottest
items currently on Capitol Hill. An au
dience of five turned out to hear His
tory Prof. Clay Carson and Law Prof.
William Gould discuss the history and
current status of voting rights legisla
tion. Provisions of the 1975 Voting Right
Act which extended earlier laws are due
to expire on Aug. 2.

News Analysis

The debate over the current legisla
tion involves the definition of discrimi
nation. President Ronald Reagan favors
legislation which requires proof of in
tent to discriminate in an election be
fore a voting rights violation is estab
lished. The House has already passed,
by a 389 to 24 margin, a stronger bill
which does not require proof of inten
tional discrimination to constitute an
abridgement of voting rights. Rather, a
plaintiff need demonstrate only that an
election procedure "results" in a dis
criminatory election.
The bill would prohibit such proce
dures as at-large elections, majority
vote requirements, inconvenient loca
tion of registration or polling places,
and mandatory re-registration ofvoters
when the procedure results in weaken
ing the voting strength of a minority
group. Could supports the House bill
because proving intent in civil rights

law is such a cumbersome task. "Show
ing a particular result is much less dif
ficult," he said.
The House version has 62 co
sponsors in the Senate, although it is
currently stalled in the Senate judiciary
Committee. Such widespread support
for the stringent bill in both houses
suggests that the coalition Reagan
amassed on economic issues may de
sert the president on so-called "social
issues." The participants at the sym
posium were as interested in the
reasons for the president's position as
in the debate over the merits of the bill.
Is Reagan's opposition to a strong bill
based on a legal principle or a commit
ment to weaken the enforcement of
civil rights laws in general?
Attorney General William French
Smith adamantly defends the presi
dent's proposal. Smith argues that
showing discrimination without prov
ing an intent to discriminate will lead to
"quotas in the political process." Some
conservatives have suggested that
taken to its logical extreme, the lan
guage approved by the House would
require proportionate representation
of minority groups among their elected
officials.
Could cited the House report on the
bill in arguing that the administrations
concern over racial quotas is un
founded. That report states that an
"aggregate of factors" should be con
sidered in determining each case of al
leged voting discrimination. Gould cal
led Reagan's stance a "ruse" to obscure
the issue of continuing inequities in the
voting process. "Race discrimination in

voting is still very much a problem,"
Could said. An "environment of hostil
ity and intimidation" persists in certain
voting districts despite passage of the
landmark Voting Rights Act ot 1965,
Gould said.
Prof. Kennell ]ackson, African and
Afro-American studies program chair
man, echoed Gould's concerns and
questioned Reagan's political wisdom
on the issue. While predicting ultimate
passage of the House version, Jackson
criticized Reagan's politically risky
stands on civil rights. "Clearly Reagan
couldn't care less about the black
vote," so he "sees profit in adopting a
stance that is anti-black," Jackson said.
He warned that black voters may
"punish Reagan" at the polls in this
year's Congressional elections.
Reagan's obstinacy poses a serious
political problem. It appears likely that
Reagan's conservative coalition will
abandon him on the voting rights Act.
More important to his long-range polit
ical credibility is the possibility that Vot
ing Rights will provide the issue around
which the traditional Democratic coali
tion will rally. The leadership Confer
ence on civil rights, an umbrella or
ganization of minority, laborand liberal
groups, last week attacked as a
"travesty" the administration's handl
ing of civil rights.
The Democrats may have more suc
cess in coalescing on the Voting Rights
Act and Civil Rights in general than they
did on budget and tax matters. If they
succeed, Reagan will face perhaps the
most determined and cohesive opposi
tion of his presidency.
