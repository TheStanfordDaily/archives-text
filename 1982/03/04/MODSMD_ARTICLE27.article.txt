## New respect for Rodney Dan[Illegible] 
### Allen Cohn Rodney Dangerfield 
Civic Auditorium
20 February 1982
I tell you, I don't get no respect. Why just
the other day my psychiatrist told me I was
crazy. I said, 'Doc, if you don't mind, I'd
like a second opinion.'
He said, 'OK, you're ugly too!'

Even before the show began Rodney
Dangerfield really impressed me, for
around the auditorium I saw everyone
from high school couples, to trucker types
with beer bellies wearing AC/DC T-shirts,
to well-dressed, matronly women (al
though blacks and orientals were con
spicuously missing). For some reason
there is near-universal appeal in seeing a
60-year-old man sweat like a horse and tell
off-color jokes your 60-year-old grand
father would not approve of.
The show started 25 minutes late with
comedian Dennis Blair, who mainly did
parodies of popular music on his guitar.
His first 15 minutes were quite uneven, but
it took that long for the hall to finally fill.
After that, his act got better and better.
("Joe Cocker would be a natural to do
Sanka commercials.")
Blair's biggest problem was that he
launched into his routine without getting
the audience's attention. Rodney, on the

other hand, marched right out and started
talking to the audience and joking with the
people in the first row. Of course, it is
easier for Rodney si nee everyone imagines
they are already on a first name basis with
him. In fact, his whole character is, "I'm
just like you and have the same problems
as you, only worse!" ("My wife just cut me
down to sex twice a month. I feel lucky — I
know two guys she cut off completely!")
I had seen Rodney once before at
Northwestern University and so I won
dered how he would change his act for this
more diverse and conservative crowd. I
knew there was no way I could take notes
on his rapid-fire delivery, so I carefully
snuck in a tape recorder. Unfortunately, I
left it on "pause," or else I would have
more quotes for this article. (Note: If you
need to hide a tape recorder in your pants
and so you discretely face an obscure
building's wall, a police car will pull up
behind you to see if you are urinating.) To
my surprise, he did much of the same and
similar material, and the audience loved it.
("I found a guy in bed with my wife, so I
said, 'Who told you you could fool around
with my wife?' He said, 'Everybody!') I did
not enjoy the show as much as the first
time (when I fell off my seat laughing),
since his style requires the element of sur
prise. Unfortunately, I got the feeling that
some of his lines are so famous because of
his records that he feels compelled to

keep using them.
Rodney finished his 35-minute set and]
insistent applause brought him back on
stage. Then he did a little more material
and tried to answer some questions from
theaudience, which was quite unwieldy in
the Civic Auditorium. As is tradition, he
offered his tie for a kiss and a future-
Miss-Universe-type beat all the other at
tractive groupies to the stage. I guess
that's another thing that impresses me
about Rodney — this 60-year-old man who
sweats like a horse has redefined "sexy"
for himself. ("In France I met a beautiful
young girl who told me American men are
the best lovers. Then she said Americans
who are comedians are the best lovers and
she invited me home. I turned her down; I
figured I was too good for her.") Rodney
let the Q&A go on for a self-indulgent
amount of time, but finally picked up the
hint from the anxious crowd.
After the show I stuck around until he
came out. Up close it was obvious that this
was an old man ("At my age I envy a stiff
breeze.") who has been on the circuit a
long time. But his following is still growing
and his career has not peaked yet (he will
start his second movie soon). Which is not
to say we give him any respect.

fire!' and she says, 'Quiet, you'll wake
Daddy.'
