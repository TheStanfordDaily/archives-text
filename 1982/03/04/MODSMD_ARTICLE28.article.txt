# Tempting, cloying, struggling...
## A
						dazzling finish for ABT 
### Mary Walp 
American Ballet Theatre ended their two
week visit to San Francisco with a dazzling
evening of four short ballets. The dancing
was excellent, and the dancers themselves
were appealing, leaving the City with a
marvelous impression of the troupe.
A moving performance of Balanchine's
Prodigal Son opened Sunday evening's
program. Robert LaFosse did an excellent
job of portraying the rebellious son, carry
ing off the transformation from an angry
youth who can barely stand to be in his
father's presence to a naive young man
swept away by temptation. Balanchine's
choreography for this temptation, which
comes in the form of nine male Drinking
Companions and a Siren (Martine Van
Hamel), is full of treachery and seduction.
The dancers added an effective bit of
humor to their steps, just to show us how
naive the boy is. The drinking companions
were loose and foolish while Van Hamel
tempted with daVfting full of deceptive
sex. She was enticing, yet hard and obvi
ously bored with the boy's innocent ex
citement. LaFosse's aloneness when he

was deserted by his new "friends" was
almost painful to watch, which led to an
especially touching moment when he
crawled back into the arms of his father at
the end of the ballet.
Les Rendezvous, the next work on the
evening's agenda, is Frederick Ashton's
idealization of youth's flirtations. It is
bubbly and coy — "A suite of dances with
the theme of young people meeting in a
park," as the program notes state. Every
thing is nice and sparkly in this ballet, from
the choreography to the dancers them
selves. It almost cloys, in fact. Each girl
manages to find a boy by the end of the
ballet, and the carefree couples go skip
ping offstage.
The dancers were brilliant, however,
giving Les Rendezvous the appropriate
glitter and playfulness. The girls were
sweet and demure; the boys were gallant
supporters. Kristine Elliott and Warren
Conover shone as the principal couple
among a very bouyant but neat corps.
Following, and completely contrasting
Les Rendezvous, was Torso. Martine Van
Hamel and Kevin McKenzie were superb

in Jiri Kylian's tension filled ballet set in a
dingy slum to Toru Takemitsu's abstract
music.
Torso opens with McKenzie onstage
alone —tense then suddenly limp, stretch
ing, yet never reaching freedom. Van
Hamel appears with the same tension, and
the two dance together, curling into, then
escaping from each other. It is a struggle
between the two, although once or twice
the two verge on gentleness. A burst away
from this feeling always transformed it into
violence, however, until the two finally
walk offstage together, exhausted.
Kylian's choreography is incredible, full
of tensions and despair. With Van Hamel
and McKenzie bringing so much of their
own emotions to the stage with them, the
whole audience seemed to breathe a sigh of
relief as the curtain came down, returning
us to our safe Opera House seats.
The program closed with Paul Taylor's
Airs. The company danced with lightness
and fluidity, giving the audience a feeling
for their obvious joy in movement. Each
member of the cast was brilliant, leaving
San Francisco eager for next February and
ABT's next visit.
