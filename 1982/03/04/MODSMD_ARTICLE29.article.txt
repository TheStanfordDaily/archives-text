# Dueling tubas in SF
## 
### Andy Clarke 
One hundred fifty assorted tubas,
euphoniums, baritones, sousaphones and heli
cons playing everything from ).S. Bach to Scott
loplin can't be serious. And if you went to the
San Francisco Symphony's Tubafest II Tuesday
evening expecting to hear a program of techni
cally excellent music played by professionals,
you were most certainly disappointed. But if
instead you approached Davies Hall wanting no
more than to appreciate the novelty of the
event, you were probably satisfied.
The big brass was brought together to kick off
the Symphony's fund-raising drive that includes
a marathon radio broadcast beginning tonight at
7 on KKHI and continuing through midnight
Sunday. The Symphony Guild has also compiled
an amazingly extensive catalog of "collecti
bles," available to contributors to the drive.
Gifts range from assorted delicatessen goodies
for a $5 donation to a chamber music concert in
your home for a $2000 gift. The symphony is also
offering for sale, wine from its own private bottl
ing, T-shirts, posters, frisbees and is sponsoring
a "pamper yourself" raffle as part of its effort to
raise money.
The Tubafest program opened with "America
the Beautiful" arranged by one of the perfor
mers, Paul Chauvin. The first few chords were
grand and impressive, but before the orchestra
had played eight measures it was evident that
Chauvin was more concerned with giving
everyone an interesting part to play than with
properly voicing chords and emphasizing
melodic lines. This problem of overly-thick
chords and a profusion of moving parts that did
nothing more than create a rumble was charac
teristic of nearly every arrangement that the en
semble played. This is understandable, al
though not excusable, when you realize how
tuba players approach an arrangement. They
know the kind of boring oom-pa-pas that tubas
are usually stuck with, and fry in a three-minute
piece to make up for centuries of oppression by

the trumpet section. A notable exception was
Abe Nole's arrangement of a Sarabande and
Gavotte by Corelli. Nole used even-textured
chords in the Sarabande and managed to project
<1 feeling of levity in the Gavotte.
Not only were the arrangements poor, but the
performance was only fair at best. The tuba is a
marvelously mellow-sounding instrument, but
in chorus it can sound awfully droning. This
need not be so, however, as the Tubafest or
chestra proved in the famous Colonel Bogey
march. Perhaps the bright brassy sound that the
orchestra achieved in this piece could have
been applied elsewhere to accentuate melodies
and counterpoint.
Another problem the ensemble had was con
veying a sense of rhythm, especially in the
march numbers. This is surprising since tubas
are usually the pulse of a marching band brass
section.
The high point of the evening was without
doubt the San Francisco Tuba Quartet's rendi
tion of the famous dance from Sleeping Beauty.
Floyd Cooley demonstrated the type of
technique that earned him his position of prin
cipal tuba of the San Francisco Symphony, while
the other quartet members provided delicate
yet solid accompaniment. The remainder of the
quartet's performance was a great disappoint
ment, however. The difficulty of their selections
was far below their demonstrated abilities, yet
they managed to goof up frequently, and their
intonation (or lack of it) was at times painful.
In spite of the musical mediocrity, the audi
ence response was enthusiastic. Conductor/
announcer Scott Beach was a likable ham,
whose humor seemed to say, "Don't take this
stuff too seriously, folks." Tuba ensemble per
formance is a relatively young art that at present
offers more to tuba players than it does to their
audiences. We can hope, however, that by
Tubafest IV or V some of the finer points of
arranging for and performing in a tuba orchestra
will have been mastered.
