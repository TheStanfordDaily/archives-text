# Keys duped with ease
## Herrington says number of key copies is 'astronomical'

Thousands of times each year
metal rings on metal as a University
locksmith stamps a University key
with the commandment "DO NOT
DUPLICATE." Although this order is
backed by law, it is almost impossible
to prevent people from making
copies ot their keys, said Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
All one must do, according to Her
rington, is place some tape over the
words "DO NOT DUPLICATE/' and a
hurried locksmith would knowingly
cut an illegal duplicate key.
This is exactly what happened at
two of the six lock shops the Daily
visited to try to get a tape-camoflaged
Roble room key duplicated.
Most locksmiths in the University
area can spot Stanford keys and will

not duplicate them.
It says "Stanford University â€” DO
NOT DUPLICATE" the proprietor of
Bay Area Locksmith in Palo Alto told
The Daily. "I can (duplicate the key),
but I won't."
As soon as he saw the "Stanford
University" stamp on the Robie key,
the locksmith in Armando's Key
Shop in Palo Alto sai>i, "It's an en
forced law."
Even if a locksmith i> willing to cut
the key illegally, chances are he
won't have the uncut key blank in
stock. Keys to many University build
ings are cut on blanks made espe
cially for Stanford.
The Woolworth's on University
Ave. was willing to cut a Roble key
although the correct key blank was
not in stock. The A-A Lock and Alarm
Shop in Menlo Park, however, had
the correct blank and cut a duplicate

key.
It's pretty difficult to trace some
thing like that down," said Her
rington. "You'd have to be there
when they do it (duplicate the key)."
No police officer was around when
Mark Gottleib, a Stanford graduate,
armed himself with vise and file, dis
assembled four or five of his friends
locks and cut a master key in less
than two hours. Hallmates had been
pestering Gottlieb, an amateur
locksmith, to pick their door locks
when they forgot their keys. Gottlieb
decided that a master kev would save
hm some time.
Everyone in the dorm knew about
the key after a few days, Gottleib
said, but the resident fellow and of
fice staff didn't know what to do with
him.
"If we took the key away from him,
"he would have just made another

onp," said Jan Vnn Houten, resident
fellow tor Gottleib's dorm, Crother's
Memorial. Van Houten decided to
make Cottleib an "honorary resident
assistant." Gottleib said he only used
the master key to open friends'
doors, except once when he and a
friend got into the attic to rewire the
