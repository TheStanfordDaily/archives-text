# Keys duped with ease
## Herrington says number of key copies is 'astronomical' 
### Heather Millar Senior staff writer Last in a series 
Thousands of times each year
metal rings on metal as a University
locksmith stamps a University key
with the commandment "DO NOT
DUPLICATE." Although this order is
backed by law, it is almost impossible
to prevent people from making
copies ot their keys, said Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
All one must do, according to Her
rington, is place some tape over the
words "DO NOT DUPLICATE/' and a
hurried locksmith would knowingly
cut an illegal duplicate key.
This is exactly what happened at
two of the six lock shops the Daily
visited to try to get a tape-camoflaged
Roble room key duplicated.
Most locksmiths in the University
area can spot Stanford keys and will

not duplicate them.
It says "Stanford University — DO
NOT DUPLICATE" the proprietor of
Bay Area Locksmith in Palo Alto told
The Daily. "I can (duplicate the key),
but I won't."
As soon as he saw the "Stanford
University" stamp on the Robie key,
the locksmith in Armando's Key
Shop in Palo Alto sai>i, "It's an en
forced law."
Even if a locksmith i> willing to cut
the key illegally, chances are he
won't have the uncut key blank in
stock. Keys to many University build
ings are cut on blanks made espe
cially for Stanford.
The Woolworth's on University
Ave. was willing to cut a Roble key
although the correct key blank was
not in stock. The A-A Lock and Alarm
Shop in Menlo Park, however, had
the correct blank and cut a duplicate

key.
It's pretty difficult to trace some
thing like that down," said Her
rington. "You'd have to be there
when they do it (duplicate the key)."
No police officer was around when
Mark Gottleib, a Stanford graduate,
armed himself with vise and file, dis
assembled four or five of his friends
locks and cut a master key in less
than two hours. Hallmates had been
pestering Gottlieb, an amateur
locksmith, to pick their door locks
when they forgot their keys. Gottlieb
decided that a master kev would save
hm some time.
Everyone in the dorm knew about
the key after a few days, Gottleib
said, but the resident fellow and of
fice staff didn't know what to do with
him.
"If we took the key away from him,
"he would have just made another

onp," said Jan Vnn Houten, resident
fellow tor Gottleib's dorm, Crother's
Memorial. Van Houten decided to
make Cottleib an "honorary resident
assistant." Gottleib said he only used
the master key to open friends'
doors, except once when he and a
friend got into the attic to rewire the

phone connections and avoid a $15
Pacific Telephone fee.
Despite Gottleib's exploits, resi
dent manager Bob Mibach said that
he is "unaware of any keys that have
been duplicated by students," al
though "I wouldn't deny that that
could have happened."
Herrington said that "the number
of keys out there is astronomical."
We find people regularly that have
keys that they shouldn't have. When
we do, we take them (the keys) away
from them."

Herrington also confirmed a
rumor that a Mirrielees resident last
spring either stole or duplicated a
master key and used it to steal from
her neighbor's apartments. He could
not disclose further details, how
ever, because the case record is not
in the current filing system.
Despite such incidents, Her
rington said "the buildings around
here are very secure considering the
number of keys (in unauthorized
hands)." Gottleib supported this
view from experience. "In general,
keys at Stanford are almost impossi
ble to get blanks for," Gottlieb said.
But he said it was possible to get
blanks for dorm keys "if you try hard
enough."

"I don't think we'll ever have a
foolproof system, not as long as
human beings are carrying keys
around," said Terry McCovern,
housing facilities manager. "Our job
is to minimize the risk."
McGovern added, "I'm sure it
happens all over the world. It's
something you have to face. It's a
way of life."
FHerrington said he doubts the
situation could be greatly improved
without resorting to mesaures which
would change University life drasti
cally. At the University of Illinois at
Chicago Circle, Herrington said,
every night at 6 p.m. a prison-style
"lock-down" seals all the doors on
campus.

FHerrington said he doubts the
situation could be greatly improved
without resorting to mesaures which
would change University life drasti
cally. At the University of Illinois at
Chicago Circle, Herrington said,
every night at 6 p.m. a prison-style
"lock-down" seals all the doors on
campus.
Thousands of times each year
metal rings on metal as a University
locksmith stamps a University key
with the commandment "DO NOT
DUPLICATE." Although this order is
backed by law, it is almost impossible
to prevent people from making
copies ot their keys, said Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington.
All one must do, according to Her
rington, is place some tape over the
words "DO NOT DUPLICATE/' and a
hurried locksmith would knowingly
cut an illegal duplicate key.
This is exactly what happened at
two of the six lock shops the Daily
visited to try to get a tape-camoflaged
Roble room key duplicated.
Most locksmiths in the University
area can spot Stanford keys and will

not duplicate them.
It says "Stanford University — DO
NOT DUPLICATE" the proprietor of
Bay Area Locksmith in Palo Alto told
The Daily. "I can (duplicate the key),
but I won't."
As soon as he saw the "Stanford
University" stamp on the Robie key,
the locksmith in Armando's Key
Shop in Palo Alto sai>i, "It's an en
forced law."
Even if a locksmith i> willing to cut
the key illegally, chances are he
won't have the uncut key blank in
stock. Keys to many University build
ings are cut on blanks made espe
cially for Stanford.
The Woolworth's on University
Ave. was willing to cut a Roble key
although the correct key blank was
not in stock. The A-A Lock and Alarm
Shop in Menlo Park, however, had
the correct blank and cut a duplicate

key.
It's pretty difficult to trace some
thing like that down," said Her
rington. "You'd have to be there
when they do it (duplicate the key)."
No police officer was around when
Mark Gottleib, a Stanford graduate,
armed himself with vise and file, dis
assembled four or five of his friends
locks and cut a master key in less
than two hours. Hallmates had been
pestering Gottlieb, an amateur
locksmith, to pick their door locks
when they forgot their keys. Gottlieb
decided that a master kev would save
hm some time.
Everyone in the dorm knew about
the key after a few days, Gottleib
said, but the resident fellow and of
fice staff didn't know what to do with
him.
"If we took the key away from him,
"he would have just made another

onp," said Jan Vnn Houten, resident
fellow tor Gottleib's dorm, Crother's
Memorial. Van Houten decided to
make Cottleib an "honorary resident
assistant." Gottleib said he only used
the master key to open friends'
doors, except once when he and a
friend got into the attic to rewire the

phone connections and avoid a $15
Pacific Telephone fee.
Despite Gottleib's exploits, resi
dent manager Bob Mibach said that
he is "unaware of any keys that have
been duplicated by students," al
though "I wouldn't deny that that
could have happened."
Herrington said that "the number
of keys out there is astronomical."
We find people regularly that have
keys that they shouldn't have. When
we do, we take them (the keys) away
from them."

Herrington also confirmed a
rumor that a Mirrielees resident last
spring either stole or duplicated a
master key and used it to steal from
her neighbor's apartments. He could
not disclose further details, how
ever, because the case record is not
in the current filing system.
Despite such incidents, Her
rington said "the buildings around
here are very secure considering the
number of keys (in unauthorized
hands)." Gottleib supported this
view from experience. "In general,
keys at Stanford are almost impossi
ble to get blanks for," Gottlieb said.
But he said it was possible to get
blanks for dorm keys "if you try hard
enough."

"I don't think we'll ever have a
foolproof system, not as long as
human beings are carrying keys
around," said Terry McCovern,
housing facilities manager. "Our job
is to minimize the risk."
