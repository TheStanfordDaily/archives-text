A new look .. .
But we didn't plan it that way. Last
night, we at the Daily got a taste of
what it used to be like in the days of
Fiduccia, Leslie, et al. That's right, no
nifty computer terminals to type
stories on. The VDT plug got put in
the wrong hole and POOF â€” back to
the typewriters.
Seriously, things will bea little hec
tic for the next few days. Reporters
and editors should check in to see
about revised procedures and up
dated deadlines, and anyone with
time should come in to help proof
read copy.
Fee assessments
Keep those filled petitions coming
in and help qualify the Daily fee as
sessment for the spring ballot. If you
don't know what petition we're talk
ing about, drop by the Daily offices
to find out and to pick one up.
A happy hour ...
And we'll need one this week.
Take some time Friday from 4:30 on
to havea drink, munch on somefood
and generally relax after a hectic
week.
And a pub night
Tonight's senior pub night will be
at the Golden Spike beginning at 9,
rather than at the Goose as previ
ously advertised.
