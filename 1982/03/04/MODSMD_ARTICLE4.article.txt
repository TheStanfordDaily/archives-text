# Storey House spots reserved for theme core
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
More than one-third of the spots in
the newly renovated Storey House
were automatically awarded to
members of an organizing commit
tee for the new East Asian studies
theme house regardless of their
housing draw numbers, according to
Diane Conklin, director of row
facilities.
Of spring quarter's 44 new resi
dents, 17 will be committee mem
bers. "It will be a core group of plan
ners. They'll be living together so it
will be easier to organize East House
(the East Asian studies theme house)
for next year's opening," said Con
klin.

The campus' newest theme house,
which was approved four years ago,
expects to open in the new dormit
ory complex west of Lagunita Court
next fall.
The office of Residential Education
decided to reserve the committee's
spots in Storey House "early last
quarter," according to Conklin.
"When you're living with people,
you have freedom and flexibility to
do the house's planning," she said.
Frequent committee meetings
alone would not allow sufficient time
both to organize the house structure
and to plan theme programs, said
Hotel ling, a member of the East Asian
studies house organizing commit
tee.

Hotelling said her group's organi
zation plans include: choosing
books for the library, developing a
house government and hiring a
cook.
She said Storey House will also
serve as a base for interested stu
dents' inquiries during open houses
and stamping of priority cards during
the spring housing draw.
"But we want to avoid people
thinking that Storey House will serve
as the temporary East House. We're
not taking over the house, but we
will be one of the things going on in
Storey House this spring," she said.
"There may be a natural division
(between committee members and
other house members) but we want

to work together into a unified
Storey House," she said.
Hotelling said her group has not
yet planned any specific theme ac
tivities, such as sherry hours with
professors, for spring quarter. But,
she said, activities will not be
scheduled in conflict with dormitory
functions.
"Any activities they propose will
have to come up at a house meeting
for the residents to decide," Tazuke
said.
Although Conklin said her office
has received no formal complaints
from students, an informal tele
phone survey by The Daily
revealed that some students wait
listed for Storey House said they felt
that assigning spots regardless of
draw numbers was unfair.
Only 27 wait-listed students have
received spots in Storey House so far

after the first round of the housing
draw.
No handicapped students have re
quested a space in one of the two
doubles specially designed for
wheelchair-bound students. These
rooms next quarter will be occupied
by students who are not physically
handicapped, said Mario Acquesta
who is in charge of undergraduate
housing assignments.
