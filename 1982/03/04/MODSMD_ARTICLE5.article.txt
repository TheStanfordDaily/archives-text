### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Wells Fargo Bank has recently
opted tor a five-year lease which will
allow the bank to remain in Tresidder
Union until at least September 1987.
Ten years ago, Wells Fargo was
chosen to inhabit its current site by a
committee of faculty, staff and stu
dents which also considered several
other banks. The lease signed by
Wells Fargo was for 10years, with the
option to renew for another five
vrars. tnrrv Onvtriwn. assistant ctt
rector of Tresidder Union, explained
that the contract allowed for the au
tomatic renewal of the lease upon
request by the bank.
Davidson said the contract bet
ween Tresidder Union and Wells
Fargo Bank is only a property-owner
tenant lease. The contract does not
specify any services the bank must
provide aside from banking. Check
cashing was the only service discus
sed initially in an informal communi
cation between Tresidder and the
bank, but it is not mentioned in the
lease, Davidson said.
The renewal of the lease does not
mean, however, that Tresidder offi
cials are unaware of or unconcerned

about student banking complaints.
"We're assessing all of our services
in Tresidder, including the bank,"
Davidson said.
Included in a written question
naire pertaining to all Tresidder ser
vices, are questions asking the Stan
ford community what it expects from
the bank. The questionnaire was
mailed in late February to a random
ample of 2000 faculty, students
and staff.
Davidson explained that the Uni
vr-r'MTy vcrv Vm\r* inftuenc** on t\te
Wells Fargo office because it is just
one branch in a very large organiza
tion. He pointed out that the man
agement decisions made by Wells
Fargo are made for all the branches
and do not usually take into account
individual branches.
Davidson said, "I know students
are unhappy about the $200 limit on
savings accounts. We're examining
the whole situation and negotiating
with Wells Fargo Bank as the main
organization. Between now and then
(1987 when the lease expires) we
have lots of time for negotiation."
The complaints many students
voice against Wells Fargo would
probably be the same for any bank
