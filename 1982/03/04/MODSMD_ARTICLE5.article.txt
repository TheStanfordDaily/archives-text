# Campus bank will remain here for 5 more years
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Wells Fargo Bank has recently
opted tor a five-year lease which will
allow the bank to remain in Tresidder
Union until at least September 1987.
Ten years ago, Wells Fargo was
chosen to inhabit its current site by a
committee of faculty, staff and stu
dents which also considered several
other banks. The lease signed by
Wells Fargo was for 10years, with the
option to renew for another five
vrars. tnrrv Onvtriwn. assistant ctt
rector of Tresidder Union, explained
that the contract allowed for the au
tomatic renewal of the lease upon
request by the bank.
Davidson said the contract bet
ween Tresidder Union and Wells
Fargo Bank is only a property-owner
tenant lease. The contract does not
specify any services the bank must
provide aside from banking. Check
cashing was the only service discus
sed initially in an informal communi
cation between Tresidder and the
bank, but it is not mentioned in the
lease, Davidson said.
The renewal of the lease does not
mean, however, that Tresidder offi
cials are unaware of or unconcerned

about student banking complaints.
"We're assessing all of our services
in Tresidder, including the bank,"
Davidson said.
Included in a written question
naire pertaining to all Tresidder ser
vices, are questions asking the Stan
ford community what it expects from
the bank. The questionnaire was
mailed in late February to a random
ample of 2000 faculty, students
and staff.
Davidson explained that the Uni
vr-r'MTy vcrv Vm\r* inftuenc** on t\te
Wells Fargo office because it is just
one branch in a very large organiza
tion. He pointed out that the man
agement decisions made by Wells
Fargo are made for all the branches
and do not usually take into account
individual branches.
Davidson said, "I know students
are unhappy about the $200 limit on
savings accounts. We're examining
the whole situation and negotiating
with Wells Fargo Bank as the main
organization. Between now and then
(1987 when the lease expires) we
have lots of time for negotiation."
The complaints many students
voice against Wells Fargo would
probably be the same for any bank
on campus, said Jody Sloane, assis
tant manager of the Stanford branch
of Wells Fargo.
Many students complain about the
long lines during the lunch hour.
Sloane said these cannot be helped.
Although students want to do their
banking at noon, "we have to eat
too," she said. The bank has hired
several students to work during
lunch time to meet the influx of cus
tomers.
Another busy time, Sloane said, is
Fridays. Stanford employees get paid

and want to cash their pay checks,
and students want money for the
weekend. "Often we have a 'jeans
day' on Fridays," she said. "Some
times it requires track shoes."
"We really don't get that many
complaints," Sloane added.
A common grievance raised by the
students is that Wells Fargo has a
monopoly on campus. Sloane said,
"I've heard the University will bring
other banks on campus in the fall to
solicit student accounts. I don't see
any reason not to."
The only other bank on campus is
the Stanford Credit Union which
cannot offer services to all Stanford
students. The Credit Union serves

people employed by Stanford Uni
versity and Stanford Hospital, as well
as graduate students and some
people in the industrial park area.
These categories contain a small per
centage of undergraduates.
Sloane said it is very difficult to
keep track of the number of accounts
at Wells Fargo held by Stanford stu
dents because the bank opens about
2000 accounts in the fall each year
and closes roughly the same number
each spring. The Stanford branch has
an approximate total of 15,000 ac
counts, Sloane said.
"I think we do a very fine job for
the students on campus," Sloane
said. "We certainly try!"

the whole situation and negotiating
with Wells Fargo Bank as the main
organization. Between now and then
(1987 when the lease expires) we
have lots of time for negotiation."
The complaints many students
voice against Wells Fargo would
probably be the same for any bank
on campus, said Jody Sloane, assis
tant manager of the Stanford branch
of Wells Fargo.
Many students complain about the
long lines during the lunch hour.
Sloane said these cannot be helped.
Although students want to do their
banking at noon, "we have to eat
too," she said. The bank has hired
several students to work during
lunch time to meet the influx of cus
tomers.
Another busy time, Sloane said, is
Fridays. Stanford employees get paid

and want to cash their pay checks,
and students want money for the
weekend. "Often we have a 'jeans
day' on Fridays," she said. "Some
times it requires track shoes."
"We really don't get that many
complaints," Sloane added.
A common grievance raised by the
students is that Wells Fargo has a
monopoly on campus. Sloane said,
"I've heard the University will bring
other banks on campus in the fall to
solicit student accounts. I don't see
any reason not to."
The only other bank on campus is
the Stanford Credit Union which
cannot offer services to all Stanford
students. The Credit Union serves

people employed by Stanford Uni
versity and Stanford Hospital, as well
as graduate students and some
people in the industrial park area.
These categories contain a small per
centage of undergraduates.
Sloane said it is very difficult to
keep track of the number of accounts
at Wells Fargo held by Stanford stu
dents because the bank opens about
2000 accounts in the fall each year
and closes roughly the same number
each spring. The Stanford branch has
an approximate total of 15,000 ac
counts, Sloane said.
"I think we do a very fine job for
the students on campus," Sloane
said. "We certainly try!"

RENOVATED STOREY HOUSE — will be used to house a group of students who
will form the core organizers of the East Asian Studies theme house in the new
dorm.
Wells Fargo Bank has recently
opted tor a five-year lease which will
allow the bank to remain in Tresidder
Union until at least September 1987.
Ten years ago, Wells Fargo was
chosen to inhabit its current site by a
committee of faculty, staff and stu
dents which also considered several
other banks. The lease signed by
Wells Fargo was for 10years, with the
option to renew for another five
vrars. tnrrv Onvtriwn. assistant ctt
rector of Tresidder Union, explained
that the contract allowed for the au
tomatic renewal of the lease upon
request by the bank.
Davidson said the contract bet
ween Tresidder Union and Wells
Fargo Bank is only a property-owner
tenant lease. The contract does not
specify any services the bank must
provide aside from banking. Check
cashing was the only service discus
sed initially in an informal communi
cation between Tresidder and the
bank, but it is not mentioned in the
lease, Davidson said.
The renewal of the lease does not
mean, however, that Tresidder offi
cials are unaware of or unconcerned

about student banking complaints.
"We're assessing all of our services
in Tresidder, including the bank,"
Davidson said.
Included in a written question
naire pertaining to all Tresidder ser
vices, are questions asking the Stan
ford community what it expects from
the bank. The questionnaire was
mailed in late February to a random
ample of 2000 faculty, students
and staff.
Davidson explained that the Uni
vr-r'MTy vcrv Vm\r* inftuenc** on t\te
Wells Fargo office because it is just
one branch in a very large organiza
tion. He pointed out that the man
agement decisions made by Wells
Fargo are made for all the branches
and do not usually take into account
individual branches.
Davidson said, "I know students
are unhappy about the $200 limit on
savings accounts. We're examining
the whole situation and negotiating
with Wells Fargo Bank as the main
organization. Between now and then
(1987 when the lease expires) we
have lots of time for negotiation."

voice against Wells Fargo would
probably be the same for any bank
