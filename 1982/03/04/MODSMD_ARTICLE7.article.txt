Senate hears Williams' plea
Washington — A packed Senate was urged yesterday to cast out one
of its own for the first time since the Civil War, on ground that the
Abscam crimes of Harrison Williams (D-N.j.) "sullied both his reputa
tion and that of this institution."
Williams, a 23-year veteran of the Senate, "traded on his office tor
personal gain, declared Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, the ranking
Democrat on the Ethics Committee.
"At any point in this drawn-out, sordid affair, Sen. Williams could
have said 'Wait a minute, what you're proposing is wrong. This is not
what I had in mind. I can't be involved in this,' Heflin said.
"But he didn't. He stayed; he discussed; he agreed; he promised;
he pledged — to abuse his office, his public trust for which now he
must be expelled," Heflin said.
One colleague, Assistant Democratic Leader Alan Cranston of
California, fought for a lesser penalty, censure, by which Williams
could escape banishment from office.
But the Ethics Committee's report said Williams conduct was ethi
cally repugnant and tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and
disrepute . . . Only the most severe sanction is appropriate.
The 62-year-old Williams, dressed in a dark gray suit, blue shirt with
white collar and a red tie, sat in the second row of seats to the right of
the chair from which Vice President George Rush presided. Nearly all
members were present for the debate, which could last until I uesday.
Shortly before the session opened, Williams told a crowd of repor
ters outside the capitol that he was eager to present his case.
"I have an opportunity to prove that I should be staying in the
Senate," he said. "That's what this is all about as tar as I m concerned.
I did nothing wrong."
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker urged the entire member
ship to attend throughout the debate. To help keep their attention
focused, an anteroom where newsmen usually interview senators was
placed off-limits.
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia called on his.col
leagues to "cast aside all feelings of friendship, collegiality and
camaraderie" in considering the resolution.
Senator Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) and Heflin
explained the committee's report.
The Senate's options short of expulsion include
censure, returning the case to a committee for
further study or deferring it until Williams' legal ap
peals are exhausted.
Expulsion requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate;
censure can be decreed by a simple majority.
The last Senate expulsion was in 1862 when Jesse
Bright (D-lnd.) was ousted for conspiring to sell guns
to the Confederacy.
U.S. eyes Soviet bomber
Washington — The Soviet Union has developed and
U.S. intelligence has now seen a new bomber that
could hit the United States, "underlining the need to
improve our continental air defense in all ways," De
fense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said yesterday.
Weinberger said in an interview that the new Soviet
long-range bomber resembles the American B-1 now
under construction.
The B-1 is designed to drop down low when invad
ing enemy airspace to avoid detection by radar
beams.
The United States already has a force of B-52 bom
bers that have been strengthened to fly in low against
the Soviet Union carrying nuclear bombs. The Soviet
Union currently has no comparable bomber force but
instead has stressed missiles in building its land
based nuclear offense.
Development of the new Soviet aircraft would pose
additional problems for American air defenses.
Weinberger would not go into how many of the
B-1-type planes the Soviets have built or whether they
are actually in flight tests. Other sources said that
U.S. spy satellites have taken pictures of the bomber,
leading specialists to believe it is being flight tested
but is not necessarily in full production.
"There seems to be no doubt that they do have
another long-range bomber which apparently has
many of the characteristics of the B-1," Weinberger
said. "It is new."
His disclosures about the nature of the new Soviet
bomber threat come at a time when he and other
Pentagon executives are under attack about the size
of the fiscal 1983 defense budget. Chairman Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.) of the Senate Budget Committee
had told Weinberger a few hours before the interview
that "the present defense request represents too
ambitious a spending program which cannot be sus
tained into the future."
Weinberger said that he feels as secretary of de
fense that he has no choice but to stress the gravity of
the Soviet military threat as part of his effort to keep
Congress from slashing the new defense budget. He
said the Soviet B-1-type bomber is "part of the
enormous, growing, continued expansion of Soviet
military strength.
"We don't see any lessening of their effort," Wein
berger said in a grave voice during the interview. "We
see an increasing effort each year. We don't see any
pause or anything that has slowed them down."

The Pentagon in a brochure last year entitled
"Soviet Military Power" said a new Soviet bomber
was under construction. But Weinberger's com
ments yesterday revealed for the first time what type
of aircraft it appears to be.
Trying to protect the United States against a low
flying, Soviet B-1-type plane would cost billions of
dollars in new radars, warning and interceptor air
craft and anti-aircraft weapons. The United States in
the 1960s virtually abandoned the pursuit of a fool
proof bomber defense, largely because an attack by
Soviet missiles looked like the main threat to this
country.
Head shop ban okayed
Washington — Communities trying to curb illegal
drug use won Supreme Court permission yesterday
to regulate the sale of drug paraphernalia at so-called
"head shops."
But the unanimous decision appeared to leave un
resolved whether the courts will allow an outright
ban of such businesses.
The justices resurrected a Hoffman Estates, 111., or
dinance that requires such shops to obtain licenses
for selling items "designed or marketed for use with"
illegal drugs, such as marijuana or cocaine.
A federal appeals court had ruled that the ordi
nance was unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme
Court disagreed.
"Many American communities have recently
enacted laws regulating or prohibiting the sale of
drug paraphernalia ... We hold only that such legis
lation is not facially overbroad or vague if it does not
reach constitutionally protected conduct and is
reasonably clear in its application," Justice Thurgood
Marshall wrote for the court.
Whether Marshall's method of laws "prohibiting"
such sales ia a hint as to how the court would view a
total ban likely will be the subject of future legal
fights.
"Today's decision is not of much importance," said
Kevin Zeese, executive director of the National Or
ganization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. "It does
not close down head shops, it merely regulates
them."
Israeli troops raid Sinai
Hatzar Adar, Israeli-occupied Sinai — Israeli soldiers
and police staged a dawn raid on this tiny compound
of shacks and house trailers yesterday, evicting about
60 angry Jewish settlers in the first test of Prime Minis
ter Menachem Begin's campaign to overpower resis
tance to Israel's withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula.
It took about one hour for troops to load onto
buses the entire population of Hatzar Adar, a
makeshift agricultural settlement established two
months ago, in defiance of the government, by the
militant Movement to Stop the Withdrawal from
Sinai. The settlers were transported to Beersheba in
the Israeli Negev, where they were released.
The troops used axes and crow bars to force open
the doors of the one-room shanties and the wheel less
trailers. Many of the settlers were dragged to the

buses, shouting curses. Others showed their anger
by setting tires on fire.
Neither the soldiers nor the settlers used weapons
during the confrontation. A teen-age girl, who broke
her leg trying to jump from a bus, sustained the only
serious injury.
Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon told the
Knesset, or Parliament, that the army began yesterday
to remove temporary squatters from the town of
Yamit and the 14 agricultural settlements clustered
around it on the northeast corner of the Sinai along
the Mediterranean coast.
Theaction is to prepare for the return of the Sinai to
Egyptian control by midnight April 25, as called for by
the Camp David accords. Israel captured the Sinai
from Egypt during the Six-Day War of 1967.
The action yesterday was extremely limited. The
troops moved only against Hatzar Adar, leaving Yamit
— the unofficial capital of the northern Sinai — and
the rest of the farming communities undisturbed, at
least for the time being.
Reagan woos Republicans
Washington — President Ronald Reagan moved
yesterday to heal a widening breach with members of
his party, saying his recent swipes at budget critics do
not apply to Republicans.
Some White House aides described it as a con
ciliatory gesture that could lead to an eventual budget
compromise, although Reagan was described as
"dug in" on his tax cut and military buildup prog
rams, which some congressional leaders are pushing
to modify.
Concerned by reports that Senate Republicans
were miffed at his criticism Tuesday of lawmakers
whoare attempting to rewrite his budget, Reagan put
in a telephone call from Los Angeles to Senate Major
ity Leader Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) to say that he
wasn't talking about fellow members of the GOP.
"I'm talking about those fellows who have been
around here for the last 21 years running up the
deficits and not offering any alternatives," Reagan
told Baker, according to deputy White House press
secretary Larry Speakes.
"Tell your guys I wasn't talking about us," an aide
to Baker quoted the president as saying.
The effort to mollify the critical senators came as
Reagan lost support in another major quarter: lead
ers of the Business Roundtable agreed on a new posi
tion paper that breaks cleanly with the president on
economic policy.
At the Capitol, Republican leaders were taking a
grin-and-bear-it approach to the sharp words the
president threw their way on Tuesday, when Reagan,
during a vacation swing through the West, said many
of the lawmakers who are preparing alternatives to
his budget are more concerned with saving their own
"political hides" than saving the economy.
They vowed to continue their work on a budget
alternative despite Reagan's hard-line rhetoric, and
White House officials in California with Reagan said
the president is willing to consider the results of their
endeavors.

Haig raps Central America
Washington — The Central America crisis could
pose "a very fundamental threat" to the security of
Mexico "in the very predictable future" but political
constraints make it difficult for Mexico's leders to
respond, Secretary of State Alexander Haig said yes
terday.
And, Haig said in an interview with the Los Angeles
Times, it is only "a matter of weeks or months" before
Guatemala begins to undergo a crisis comparable to
that in El Salvador today — with even more potential
to damage U.S. interests.
"It's nota question ofoneblackchip knocking over
another," Haig said of the rapidly escalating crisis,
"but it is a clear self-influencing sequence of events
which could sweep all of Central America into a
Cuba-dominated region."
Haig's warning on the threat to Mexico and other
Central American nations, the gravest and most
specific the Reagan administration has issued during
its campaign aginst Cuban and Soviet intervention in
Latin America, came during a 90-minute breakfast
session with the Times Washington Bureau.
That would "put a very fundamental threat on
Mexico in the very predictable future," he said.
A guerrilla threat to Mexico from Guatemala or El
Salvador could be particularly dangerous because
Mexico's vast oil fields lie in its southern region.
Uninterrupted oil sales are vital to the economic
growth on which Mexico has pinned its hopes for
alleviating widespread poverty.
Yet Mexico's leaders, Haig said, "are constrained
by political reality from doing what an external ob
server might presume to be logical action.
"The leadership in Mexico sits over a tightly ba
lanced constituency in which interests and attitudes
are balanced off continuously day-to-day and hour
to-hour," he said.
Specifically, Haig linked Mexico's policy toward
Central American leftists to what he called "a massive
economic crisis" in Mexico. "They've had to take
reactionary steps in terms of contemporary Mexico"
to deal with the economic crisis and as a result, he
said, "the leaders have to compensate with external
policies which are less than reactionary."
