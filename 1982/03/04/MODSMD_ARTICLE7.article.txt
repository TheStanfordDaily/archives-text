Senate hears Williams' plea
Washington — A packed Senate was urged yesterday to cast out one
of its own for the first time since the Civil War, on ground that the
Abscam crimes of Harrison Williams (D-N.j.) "sullied both his reputa
tion and that of this institution."
Williams, a 23-year veteran of the Senate, "traded on his office tor
personal gain, declared Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama, the ranking
Democrat on the Ethics Committee.
"At any point in this drawn-out, sordid affair, Sen. Williams could
have said 'Wait a minute, what you're proposing is wrong. This is not
what I had in mind. I can't be involved in this,' Heflin said.
"But he didn't. He stayed; he discussed; he agreed; he promised;
he pledged — to abuse his office, his public trust for which now he
must be expelled," Heflin said.
One colleague, Assistant Democratic Leader Alan Cranston of
California, fought for a lesser penalty, censure, by which Williams
could escape banishment from office.
But the Ethics Committee's report said Williams conduct was ethi
cally repugnant and tends to bring the Senate into dishonor and
disrepute . . . Only the most severe sanction is appropriate.
The 62-year-old Williams, dressed in a dark gray suit, blue shirt with
white collar and a red tie, sat in the second row of seats to the right of
the chair from which Vice President George Rush presided. Nearly all
members were present for the debate, which could last until I uesday.
Shortly before the session opened, Williams told a crowd of repor
ters outside the capitol that he was eager to present his case.
"I have an opportunity to prove that I should be staying in the
Senate," he said. "That's what this is all about as tar as I m concerned.
I did nothing wrong."
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker urged the entire member
ship to attend throughout the debate. To help keep their attention
focused, an anteroom where newsmen usually interview senators was
placed off-limits.
Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia called on his.col
leagues to "cast aside all feelings of friendship, collegiality and
camaraderie" in considering the resolution.
