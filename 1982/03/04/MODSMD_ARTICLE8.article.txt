# Stanford dean calls FPPC rule 'counterproductive'
## Cal faculty must disclose financial interests 
### Carolyn Lumsden 
If the state's recent ruling on conflict of interest
applied to Stanford, several faculty members here
would immediately come under investigation.
"Fortunately, we are not subject to the whims of
the state of California," said Gerald Lieberman,
vice-provost and dean of graduate research. The
state watchdog agency, the Fair Political Practices
Commission (FPPC), reaffirmed on Monday that
professors of the University of California system
come under the same conflict-of-interest law,
within limits, that applies to other state officials.

Under the new FPPC measure, which Lieberman
called "unnecessary and counterproductive," a
UC professor who receives a research grant from a
company in which he has some financial interest
much disclose this as a potential conflict of in
terest.
"That's one of the perils of being a state institu
tion," Lieberman said. "The state has a right to
intrude."
The ruling, which passed in spite of objections
by UC officials, may be the only one of its kind,
according to Al Meyerhoff of the California Rural
Legal Assistance(CßLA), the public-interest group
that pushed the ruling through.
It is a "narrow" and "limited" decision, said a
spokesman for FPPC that applies "only to those
professors who have financial ties to companies
sponsoring research, only to about two percent of
research."
Even so, it marks the first application of the
state's Political Reform Act — often called the
"post-Watergate act" — to university faculty.

It reflects a recent "public perception" that "ad
vances in modern biological and medical research
are such that some faculty could get diverted from
their work" by the lure of fabulous financial re
wards, said Dr. Eric Shooter of the medical de
partment.
Stanford's longstanding policy on conflict of in
terest is laissez-faire compared with the UC ruling,
but "much more explicit than any other universi
ty's," said Dr. Shooter, who added that Harvard
adopted its own policy just last year.
Under Stanford's guidelines, amended in 1981,
no routine disclosure is required, but faculty must
avoid "even the appearance" of a conflict of in
terest. They also must provide, if asked by certain
officials, the number of days spent on outside
work as well as the names of those for whom they
work.
"It's not a matter of must tell," one official said,
"but that they must tell if asked."
Lieberman recalls the university requesting dis
closure only once — during a government audit of
consulting practices. Federal investigators asked a
random sample of 100 faculty members to report
on their "activities" outside the University.
Some "innocent workaholics," as one source
called them, exceeded the hours allowed for con
sulting. They were quietly reprimanded.
In 1977, the FPPC exempted faculty from the
Political Reform Act on the understanding that
state universities would "take care of their own
problems," according to special assistant John
Meade.
But when the act came up for readoption last
year, the CRLA presented a "fairly good amount of
evidence of conflict, paticularly in genetics,"
Meade said.

Among cases cited by the CRLA was that of
Raymond Valentine of the plant-growth laboratory
at UC Davis. While at Davis, Valentine founded
Calgene, a firm specializing in agriculture bioen
gineering. The university later denied Valentine's
department a $2.5 million grant from Allied Corp.
when it discovered that Allied had 20 percent
ownership in Calgene.
The CRLA also named Herbert Boyer, a UC San
Francisco professor, who collaborated with Stan
ley Cohen, chairman of Stanford's department of
genetics, on a gene-splicing technique that has
earned their respective schools more than one
half million dollars thus far.
Boyer is vice-president of the genetic engineer
ing firm Genentech. The Berkeley Gazette claimed
that he held $50 million worth of stock in the com
pany.
Ownership in a company seems the trend, if not
the rule, in some departments at Stanford. Ken
nedy estimated last year that "perhaps 20 mem
bers of our biomedical research faculty have re
cently concluded or are now considering equity
arrangements with outside companies." This
number is probably a fraction of those who con
sult.
Monday's ruling may discourage blatant viola
tions of faculty privileges, or it may prove to be an
even greater evil. "The main problem all along,"
said UC attorney Gary Morrison, "was the fear that
the ruling would inhibi :r .mdertaking of useful
research projects bv t Jity averse to come under
investigation.
Al Meyerhoff of the CRLA sees Monday's ruling
as a "first -.tep." If all goes well for him, meaning
not well tor UC, he said the state "may be willing to
drop the other toot."

Ownership in a company seems the trend, if not

Monday's ruling may discourage blatant viola

If the state's recent ruling on conflict of interest
applied to Stanford, several faculty members here
would immediately come under investigation.
"Fortunately, we are not subject to the whims of
the state of California," said Gerald Lieberman,
vice-provost and dean of graduate research. The
state watchdog agency, the Fair Political Practices
Commission (FPPC), reaffirmed on Monday that
professors of the University of California system
come under the same conflict-of-interest law,
within limits, that applies to other state officials.

Under the new FPPC measure, which Lieberman
called "unnecessary and counterproductive," a
UC professor who receives a research grant from a
company in which he has some financial interest
much disclose this as a potential conflict of in
terest.
"That's one of the perils of being a state institu
tion," Lieberman said. "The state has a right to
intrude."
The ruling, which passed in spite of objections
by UC officials, may be the only one of its kind,
according to Al Meyerhoff of the California Rural
Legal Assistance(CßLA), the public-interest group
that pushed the ruling through.
It is a "narrow" and "limited" decision, said a
spokesman for FPPC that applies "only to those
professors who have financial ties to companies
sponsoring research, only to about two percent of
research."
Even so, it marks the first application of the
state's Political Reform Act — often called the
"post-Watergate act" — to university faculty.

It reflects a recent "public perception" that "ad
vances in modern biological and medical research
are such that some faculty could get diverted from
their work" by the lure of fabulous financial re
wards, said Dr. Eric Shooter of the medical de
partment.
Stanford's longstanding policy on conflict of in
terest is laissez-faire compared with the UC ruling,
but "much more explicit than any other universi
ty's," said Dr. Shooter, who added that Harvard
adopted its own policy just last year.
Under Stanford's guidelines, amended in 1981,
no routine disclosure is required, but faculty must
avoid "even the appearance" of a conflict of in
terest. They also must provide, if asked by certain
officials, the number of days spent on outside
work as well as the names of those for whom they
work.
"It's not a matter of must tell," one official said,
"but that they must tell if asked."
Lieberman recalls the university requesting dis
closure only once — during a government audit of
consulting practices. Federal investigators asked a
random sample of 100 faculty members to report
on their "activities" outside the University.
Some "innocent workaholics," as one source
called them, exceeded the hours allowed for con
sulting. They were quietly reprimanded.
In 1977, the FPPC exempted faculty from the
Political Reform Act on the understanding that
state universities would "take care of their own
problems," according to special assistant John
Meade.
But when the act came up for readoption last
year, the CRLA presented a "fairly good amount of
evidence of conflict, paticularly in genetics,"
Meade said.

Among cases cited by the CRLA was that of
Raymond Valentine of the plant-growth laboratory
at UC Davis. While at Davis, Valentine founded
Calgene, a firm specializing in agriculture bioen
gineering. The university later denied Valentine's
department a $2.5 million grant from Allied Corp.
when it discovered that Allied had 20 percent
ownership in Calgene.
The CRLA also named Herbert Boyer, a UC San
Francisco professor, who collaborated with Stan
ley Cohen, chairman of Stanford's department of
genetics, on a gene-splicing technique that has
earned their respective schools more than one
half million dollars thus far.
