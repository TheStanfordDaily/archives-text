## Lively Arts: keeping dance alive 
### Lael Stone 
Though dance companies
nationwide have been dis
banding because of financial
difficulties, the University says
it will continue to sponsor
quality dance performances
such as that of jose Limon, cur
rently on campus.
The University's Lively Arts
Director Vicki Holt noted that
"when I came here five years
ago, the attendance at dance
events had been somewhat
uneven, but the Lively Arts staff
believed that by letting people
know how interesting and ex
citing dance can be, a wider
audience could be reached."
This audience is being
reached more and more as
Holt quoted an attendance fi
gure of 75 people for a Reper
tory Dance Theater lecture
demonstration seven years
ago, as opposed to an atten
dance of 750 to 1000 at similar
events recently. Holt said stu
dents now constitute up to 50
percent of the audience at
Lively Arts dance perfor
mances and about 25 percent
of chamber music concerts.
The Lively Arts has been
given the responsibility of
bringing dance groups of na

tional and international stature
to campus for performances
and community outreach ac
tivities.
Under this philosophy the
Lively Arts has sponsored dur
ing the years 1977 through
1981 groups such as Pilobolus,
Repertory Dance Theater, Paul
Taylor Dance Company as well
as the Alvin Alley Dance Thea
ter, the last in conjunction with
Berkeley's Arts and Lectures
program. Due to time, space
and money constraints, the
Lively Arts brings three or four
dance groups to campus per
year, Holt said.
Next year signals a change in
the national orientation of the
Lively Arts dance presentations
to a more regional one, due to
decreased governmental fund
ing and general economic
conditions.
"The driving force for artist
fees are airfares, which have
risen 150 percent in some
cases, especially for the short
hops," Holt said.
Holt said she did not believe
Lively Arts' new emphasis on
regional dance companies
would interfere with another
dance group on campus, the
Dance Division. The Dance Di

vision in conjunction with the
Dance Quorum produced a
series of talks, master classes,
films and a performance as part
of last week's Dance Week.
"We would not be compet
ingwithanylongterm teaching
and exchange relationships
that the Dance Division might
form with regional com
panies," Holt said.
"Next year will be the last
one with National Endowment
for the Arts funding for dance
residencies. After this, dance
companies will receive funds
directly to use at their discre
tion to produce home seasons,
tours, etc.," Holt said.
Another, much smaller fund,
on whose advisory panel Holt
sits, will continue to provide
some support to sponsors of
events such as the Lively Arts.
Because the Bay Area is the
second national capital for
dance, this coming regional
focus still allows for high qual
ity and varied dance perfor
mances here. For next year,
this all translates into presenta
tions by the Paul Taylor Co. of
New York City, the Bella
Lewitzky Co. of Los Angeles
and the Oberlin Dance Collec

tive of San Francisco
Because the Oberlin Dance
Collective works and performs
in the Mission Distrir t of San
Francisco, Holt and her col
leagues have been able to ar
range for a month long series
of master classes and lecture
demonstrations by the group
to culminate in their perfor
mances in April 1985. This will
allow the campus to "get to
know the dance company,"
Holt said.
All artists contracted by the
Lively Arts have the obligation
to participate in some type of
community outreach program.
These activities, currently
coordinated by Sally Metzer of
Lively Arts, include elementary
school or senior citi/en con
certs as well as master classes.
For example, the Limon
company gave a free lecture
demonstration in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday.
For the 30 to 35 perfor
mances scheduled during the
school year, Metzer arranges
between 100 to 115 outreach
activities funded by the Lively
Arts program.
The Limon company will be
the Lively Arts' third and last
dance residency this year. This
company is the only dance
group to survive the death of
its founder. Jose Limon was a
Mexican-born dancer who
trained and performed origi
nally with the Humphrey-
Weidman company. One of
Limon's best known works is
the "Moor's Pavane" currently
in the repertory of many ballet
companies worldwide.
While the quality of dance
performances here will not
diminish, the Limon company
itself may not return soon. This
group of strong and unique
dancers will present works by
Murray Louis, Lucas Moving
and Limon, on Friday and by
Doris Humphrey Limon, Anna
Sokolov and Carla Maxwell on
Saturday.

"when I came here five years
ago, the attendance at dance
events had been somewhat
uneven, but the Lively Arts staff
believed that by letting people
know how interesting and ex
citing dance can be, a wider
audience could be reached."
This audience is being
reached more and more as
Holt quoted an attendance fi
gure of 75 people for a Reper
tory Dance Theater lecture
demonstration seven years
ago, as opposed to an atten
dance of 750 to 1000 at similar
events recently. Holt said stu
dents now constitute up to 50
percent of the audience at
Lively Arts dance perfor
mances and about 25 percent
of chamber music concerts.
The Lively Arts has been
given the responsibility of
bringing dance groups of na

tional and international stature
to campus for performances
and community outreach ac
tivities.
Under this philosophy the
Lively Arts has sponsored dur
ing the years 1977 through
1981 groups such as Pilobolus,
Repertory Dance Theater, Paul
Taylor Dance Company as well
as the Alvin Alley Dance Thea
ter, the last in conjunction with
Berkeley's Arts and Lectures
program. Due to time, space
and money constraints, the
Lively Arts brings three or four
dance groups to campus per
year, Holt said.
Next year signals a change in
the national orientation of the
Lively Arts dance presentations
to a more regional one, due to
decreased governmental fund
ing and general economic
conditions.
"The driving force for artist
fees are airfares, which have
risen 150 percent in some
cases, especially for the short
hops," Holt said.
Holt said she did not believe
Lively Arts' new emphasis on
regional dance companies
would interfere with another
dance group on campus, the
Dance Division. The Dance Di

vision in conjunction with the
Dance Quorum produced a
series of talks, master classes,
films and a performance as part
of last week's Dance Week.
"We would not be compet
ingwithanylongterm teaching
and exchange relationships
that the Dance Division might
form with regional com
panies," Holt said.
"Next year will be the last
one with National Endowment
for the Arts funding for dance
residencies. After this, dance
companies will receive funds
directly to use at their discre
tion to produce home seasons,
tours, etc.," Holt said.
Another, much smaller fund,
on whose advisory panel Holt
sits, will continue to provide
some support to sponsors of
events such as the Lively Arts.
Because the Bay Area is the
second national capital for
dance, this coming regional
focus still allows for high qual
ity and varied dance perfor
mances here. For next year,
this all translates into presenta
tions by the Paul Taylor Co. of
New York City, the Bella
Lewitzky Co. of Los Angeles
and the Oberlin Dance Collec

tive of San Francisco
Because the Oberlin Dance
Collective works and performs
in the Mission Distrir t of San
Francisco, Holt and her col
leagues have been able to ar
range for a month long series
of master classes and lecture
demonstrations by the group
to culminate in their perfor
mances in April 1985. This will
allow the campus to "get to
know the dance company,"
Holt said.
All artists contracted by the
Lively Arts have the obligation
to participate in some type of
community outreach program.
These activities, currently
coordinated by Sally Metzer of
Lively Arts, include elementary
school or senior citi/en con
certs as well as master classes.
For example, the Limon
company gave a free lecture
demonstration in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday.
For the 30 to 35 perfor
mances scheduled during the
school year, Metzer arranges
between 100 to 115 outreach
activities funded by the Lively
Arts program.
The Limon company will be
the Lively Arts' third and last
dance residency this year. This
company is the only dance
group to survive the death of
its founder. Jose Limon was a
Mexican-born dancer who
trained and performed origi
nally with the Humphrey-
Weidman company. One of
Limon's best known works is
the "Moor's Pavane" currently
in the repertory of many ballet
companies worldwide.
While the quality of dance
performances here will not
diminish, the Limon company
itself may not return soon. This
group of strong and unique
dancers will present works by
Murray Louis, Lucas Moving
and Limon, on Friday and by
Doris Humphrey Limon, Anna
Sokolov and Carla Maxwell on
Saturday.

A PLACE TO PERFORM — Roble Gym's main dance studio may provide a beautiful place to rehearse
those dance steps,but without better technical facilities it will never be able to host a special perfor
mance.

nationwide have been dis
banding because of financial
difficulties, the University says
it will continue to sponsor
quality dance performances
such as that of jose Limon, cur
