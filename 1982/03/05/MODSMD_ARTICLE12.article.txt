Class French doors line one wall; heavy
wrought-iron chandeliers grace its ceiling; a
large balcony overlooks its wide expanse of
polished wooden floor.
Roble Gym's main studio may have all the
grandeur of a theater, but it lacks the technical
facilities necessary to host a professional per
formance.
"We could have here a warm intimate per
forming area to hold not just dance events but
also lectures and guest speakers in the other arts
as well," said Inga Weiss, director of the Univer
sity's dance division. "We have been trying to
get the studio re-equipped as a performing
space. Stanford is very short of auditoriums. We
have just now covered sound but we still must
rent lights which is very expensive."
Despite these technical difficulties though,
the dance division, a part of both the Athletics
Department and the School of Education, has

and will continue to sponsor dance events.
These as Weiss said, "feature the talents of our
own students, faculty and alumni of the master's
program in education (specialization in Dance)
who wish to perform as well as local and
younger artists."
Weiss noted that she "would like to see more
partnership (with other University organiza
tions) in letting people see what talent this area
has to offer."
Through activities such as the recent Dance
Week and the Open Gate Series the Division and
the Dance Quorum have sponsored many mas
ter classes workshops and performances. These
have included dancers and choreographers
such as Daniel Nagrin and musicians such as
Gwendolyn Watson.
There are usually two full-scale University
produced dance performances during the
school year. One was presented last Saturday
and the larger spring performance will occur in
late May.
