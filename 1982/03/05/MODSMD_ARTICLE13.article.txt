## Editorial GP Board purpose mistaken 
### 
The ASSU Guest Professor Board's decision to
sponsor underground cartoonist Bill Griffith for
a two-day lecture stint last month is not consis
tent with our understanding of the board's pur
pose.
What concerns us is not the choice of Griffith
perse. He may have turned out to be a remarka
bly good guest professor had he been hired to
teach a quarter-length course. The distressing
fact is that the board, in allocating its resources
to a two-day limited engagement event,
usurped the function of other groups, and the
ASSU Senate did nothing to stand in its way.
Although the ASSU by-laws do not state
explicitly what constitutes a guest professor,
Griffith's two days lecturing and chatting at
sherry hours here can hardly be called a profes
sorship.
The responsibility to find guest lecturers does
not lie with the Guest Professorship Board.
That's the job of such organizations as the ASSU
Speakers Bureau and the Stanford Committee
On Political Education (SCOPE), both of which

have done an outstanding job of hosting promi
nent and interesting lecturers this year.
When students voted overwhelmingly last
spring to support the ASSU Guest Professorship
fee assessment, they were presumably endors
ing a group that would find people to teach
unusual classes not normally available to un
dergraduates. The bureau has thus performed a
serious disservice to students who thought their
fee assessment money would be used to fund
professorships — in the full sense of that word.
Theslooo-spenton Griffith represents money
that should have been spent on someone wil
ling to teach an accredited course. Had the
board found no one suitable — and this would
be cause for some concern — the money should
have stayed in the ASSU coffers, to be used next
year.
We recognize the difficulty in getting guest
professors and the efforts this year's board has
made, but we nonetheless believe the money
should fund course instructors, not speakers.
