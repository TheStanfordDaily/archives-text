# Making protests register: sign up, then refuse induction
## 
### 
Nonregistration for the draft is at best an ineffective
way of resisting war and at worst a cop out. Many point
to the likelihood of a U.S. military intervention in the
affairs of a third world nation in the near future and
proffer nonregistration as the best means of resistance.
Nonregistration may be a legitimate option for indi
viduals who oppose war in any and all forms or who
â– simply cannot accept the infringement on personal lib
erty by government implicit in conscription. However,
for those who oppose involvement in "another Viet
nam" and who want their opposition to be significant,
'registration followed by refusal of induction is the better

way.
The most effective method of protesting an unpopular
war is by filling up the nation's jails with the bestand the
brightest of its youth. It's visible, tangible and would be
a more compelling statement than the "invisible pro
test" of thousands of young Americans who simply did
not show up at their post office on their 18th birthday.
Such a protest would also eliminate the ambiguity of
purpose which haunts anti-war movements and chal
lenges their legitimacy. Are the "invisible thousands"
staying home because they wish to make a political
statement or to avoid the terrible personal cost of going
to war?
Presented with this ambiguity, many would assume
the latter, and what begins as an exercise of social re
sponsibility on the part of the resistors turns into a denial
of responsibility in the eyes of the nation.
I believe that many of those who would criticize an
anti-war movement would do so not because they love
war but because they hate the idea of young Americans
evading responsibilities which their grandfathers did

not. The message which becomes lost, of course, is that
the war which we are likely to be fighting bears little or
no resemblance to the World War thatgrandfatherwon.
Only an "active" resistance in which protestors bear
the costs of their actions will make it absolutely clear that
the issue is not a lack of devotion to country but a
reluctance to see it embroiled in a war that serves no
one's interests.
Such a course of action demands sacrifice, but the
dynamics of wartime public opinion would require it.
During any military conflict, the media will be domi
nated by accounts of casualties among those whose
consciences led them to answer the call to arms. Only a
counter-sacrifice would command the attention and re
spect of those witnessing the conflict. Imprisonment is a
hard thing to face, but war is a hard thing to resist; its
power over the emotions and idealisms of people is a
documented historical fact.
Such a sacrifice might also be necessary to maintain
one's own sense of purpose and integrity. If the non

registration movement were to take hold and I could be
safe at home, hiding among the thousands of other
non-registrants, how could I know in my heart of hearts
that I was making a protest and not merely an evasion?
The knowledge that civil disobedience has worked in
the past and could work again would make that question
especially hard to answer.
I'm tired of being referred to as part of the "me gener
ation." I don't believe that it's true. If the teenagers of
the '70s seem politically apathetic then, perhaps it's be
cause neither the glittering generalizations of the '60s
nor the Cold War assumptions of the '50s seem valid
anymore. Until a new consensus which escapes both
extremes emerges, judgment about our commitment to
our country and its political process.
In the meantime, let's not encourage such doubts of
our commitment by trying to protest in absentia.
