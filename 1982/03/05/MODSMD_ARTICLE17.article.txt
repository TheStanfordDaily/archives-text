## Paint or poverty: where do priorities lie? 
### 
I am sick and tired of the unfeel
ingness of Stanford students. Tues
day night Roble had a discussion on
class and race barriers in equal ac
cess to health care. Four dorm resi
dents out of 300 showed up. Tuesday
also, we were supposed to send two
residents to Residential Education's
Unlearning Racism workshop. No
one volunteered to go.
I brought it up at last night's resi
dence staff meeting. The response
was that we shouldn't (horrors!)
force anyone to attend, and obvi
ously no one was interested. End of
discussion.
No. I don't want to end this discus
sion . Maybe it's time we started forc
ing ourselves to face such uncom
fortable subjects as our own racism,
unequal access to health care in the
United States or world hunger.
But oh, no, not at beautiful Stan
ford. Let's not dirty our clean white
world. After all, these are the years of
our lives we must enjoy to the hilt.
And we're going to make damn sure
we do just that.
Do you know what "cause" gener
ated the most enthusiasm at Roble
last week? The ugly color of the new
paint on our doors. A petition to have
it removed currently has more than
200 signatures. That's 80 more
people than signed up for Fast Day
here last November. Also in conjunc
tion with Fast Day, the Corridor
Council for fall quarter was ap
proached with a request for a $50-75
donation to the Stanford Committee
on Hunger. The Corridor Council
budget for the quarter was $4500.
The vote was 11-1 against the dona
tion.
Justification: Corridor Council
coudn't posibly dip into the $15 dues
each student had faithfully put into
its hands in order to ensure a great
dorm social life that quarter. And be
sides, the other charities might start
hassling us for money. Keep that
world clean and white and beautiful,
Stanford.
I can hear the protests now: Stan
ford students don't have time to be
<oncerned with issues. After all, it's
dlmost Dead Week. So watch how
many people magically find time for
the all-dorm Happy Hour this after
noon. justification: a little fun and

relaxation before Dead Week . . .
I guess I have somewhere picked
up this naive notion that people of
our age are supposed to care, to
think things can change, to fight to
change them. It's a bitter discovery
to find that, all around, paint color is
more provoking than poverty and
drinking margaritas more meaning
ful than unlearning racism.

Richard Rosenberg has accused
me of spreading "half-truths" and
engaging in "personal denunciations
and over-exaggerations (sic)" in my
writings on nuclear weaponry and
nuclear war. I totally reject these ac
cusations.
Rosenberg seems to consider it a
"personal denunciation" when I
question the fundamental tenets of
the nuclear weapons establishment.
For example, Dr. Edward Teller,
whose advice has been and con
tinues to be sought by military plan
ners, has explicitly and publicly cal
led for first use of tactical nuclear
weapons in the event of a Warsaw
Pact attack on NATO. Whether or not
Teller holds an elective office is ir
relevant, because he is a leading
spokesperson for this particular,
frightening strategic concept. Am I
not allowed to question Teller's
views and their foundation? Rosen
berg seems to feel that to do so is an
ad hominem attack on Teller.
Rosenberg also accuses me of "ir
rationality." It is difficult to under
stand how he arrives at this conclu
sion. My approach has been to
examine carefully public statements
made by the nuclear weapons elite
and to critique these statements. Is it
"irrational" to point out that gov
ernment officials intentionally de
ceive the public on matters of nuc
lear weapons, nuclear war, and civil
defense?
Rosenberg seems content with
American policy concerning
strategic nuclear weapons. I suggest
that he learn a bit about the history of
this policy. For example, in the early
19505, before the USSR posed any
real nuclear threat, U.S. bombers

were based in Britain, ready to de
liver several dozen nuclear bombs to
the USSR in the event of a European
war. U.S. policy at that time was
"nuke them first, ask questions la
ter." Rosenberg might also note the
first use of nuclear weapons. The
Soviets have done so. Belligerence
was not invented in Moscow.

examine carefully public statements
made by the nuclear weapons elite
and to critique these statements. Is it
"irrational" to point out that gov
ernment officials intentionally de
ceive the public on matters of nuc
lear weapons, nuclear war, and civil
defense?
Rosenberg seems content with
American policy concerning
strategic nuclear weapons. I suggest
that he learn a bit about the history of
this policy. For example, in the early
19505, before the USSR posed any
real nuclear threat, U.S. bombers

were based in Britain, ready to de
liver several dozen nuclear bombs to
the USSR in the event of a European
war. U.S. policy at that time was
"nuke them first, ask questions la
ter." Rosenberg might also note the
first use of nuclear weapons. The
Soviets have done so. Belligerence
was not invented in Moscow.

I am sick and tired of the unfeel
ingness of Stanford students. Tues
day night Roble had a discussion on
class and race barriers in equal ac
cess to health care. Four dorm resi
dents out of 300 showed up. Tuesday
also, we were supposed to send two
residents to Residential Education's
Unlearning Racism workshop. No
one volunteered to go.
I brought it up at last night's resi
dence staff meeting. The response
was that we shouldn't (horrors!)
force anyone to attend, and obvi
ously no one was interested. End of
discussion.
No. I don't want to end this discus
sion . Maybe it's time we started forc
ing ourselves to face such uncom
fortable subjects as our own racism,
unequal access to health care in the
United States or world hunger.
But oh, no, not at beautiful Stan
ford. Let's not dirty our clean white
world. After all, these are the years of
our lives we must enjoy to the hilt.
And we're going to make damn sure
we do just that.
Do you know what "cause" gener
ated the most enthusiasm at Roble
last week? The ugly color of the new
paint on our doors. A petition to have
it removed currently has more than
200 signatures. That's 80 more
people than signed up for Fast Day
here last November. Also in conjunc
tion with Fast Day, the Corridor
Council for fall quarter was ap
proached with a request for a $50-75
donation to the Stanford Committee
on Hunger. The Corridor Council
budget for the quarter was $4500.
The vote was 11-1 against the dona
tion.
Justification: Corridor Council
coudn't posibly dip into the $15 dues
each student had faithfully put into
its hands in order to ensure a great
dorm social life that quarter. And be
sides, the other charities might start
hassling us for money. Keep that
world clean and white and beautiful,
Stanford.
I can hear the protests now: Stan
ford students don't have time to be
<oncerned with issues. After all, it's
dlmost Dead Week. So watch how
many people magically find time for
the all-dorm Happy Hour this after
noon. justification: a little fun and

relaxation before Dead Week . . .
I guess I have somewhere picked
up this naive notion that people of
our age are supposed to care, to
think things can change, to fight to
change them. It's a bitter discovery
to find that, all around, paint color is
more provoking than poverty and
drinking margaritas more meaning
ful than unlearning racism.

Richard Rosenberg has accused
me of spreading "half-truths" and
engaging in "personal denunciations
and over-exaggerations (sic)" in my
writings on nuclear weaponry and
nuclear war. I totally reject these ac
cusations.
Rosenberg seems to consider it a
"personal denunciation" when I
question the fundamental tenets of
the nuclear weapons establishment.
For example, Dr. Edward Teller,
whose advice has been and con
tinues to be sought by military plan
ners, has explicitly and publicly cal
led for first use of tactical nuclear
weapons in the event of a Warsaw
Pact attack on NATO. Whether or not
Teller holds an elective office is ir
relevant, because he is a leading
spokesperson for this particular,
frightening strategic concept. Am I
not allowed to question Teller's
views and their foundation? Rosen
berg seems to feel that to do so is an
ad hominem attack on Teller.
Rosenberg also accuses me of "ir
rationality." It is difficult to under
stand how he arrives at this conclu
sion. My approach has been to
examine carefully public statements
made by the nuclear weapons elite
and to critique these statements. Is it
"irrational" to point out that gov
ernment officials intentionally de
ceive the public on matters of nuc
