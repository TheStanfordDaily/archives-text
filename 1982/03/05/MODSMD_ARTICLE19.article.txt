## Acting on affirmative need 
### 
As a philosophy major, Bill Sneed
should have been trained to examine
his assumptions and look at both
sides of a problem. Apparently
Sneed has not learned this; for in his
critique of affirmative action (Daily,
Feb. 25) he evokes superficial argu
ments and views the issue only from
the narrow standpoint of "reverse
discrimination."
Sneed objected to affirmative ac
tion because, by involving racial con
sideration, it conflicts with the ideal
of meritocracy where preference is
based solely on individual merit. He
pointed out that those civil rights
groups who have traditionally es
poused this idea most adamantly
now support the very policy which
comprises it. His conclusion is that
we should reject affirmative action as
"as policy which undermines the
meritocracy" just as racism did in the
past.
Part of what Sneed said is true; by
giving racial preference, affirmative
action does indeed compromise the
idea of a meritocracy. What Sneed
failed to see is that not having affir
mative action compromises it even
more.
Let's suppose that Sneed's wish is
fulfilled; universities do away with

affirmative action and adopt a
color-blind admissions policy.
Would this be a meritocracy? Hardly.
Consider a black child and a white
child each having equally outstand
ing talents and character. Both merit
to attend one day equally good uni
versities. As he grows up, however,
the black child will typically be sub-

The real issue, however, isn't whether or not
affirmative action is fair in rewarding merit.
With or without affirmative action our society is
still not a meritocracy. There are racial
inequalitities on every level which prohibit this.
In a true meritocracy there is equal opportunity
for everyone from age zero on up.

jected to a number of social disad
vantages: a lower economic status,
fewer educational opportunities and
racial prejudice, to name three.
When he reaches the stage of ap
plying to college the black will there
fore probably have lower qualifica
tions than the white. Thus where
there is only one opening at a par
ticular university, the white will be
chosen over the black â€” not because
he has greater merit, but because of
the social advantages of his race. Af
firmative action attempts to rectify
the black's disadvantage so, it any
thing, compromises the meritocracy
less than the colorblind system.
Of course one will object: "but
you are assuming that all blacks are
less privileged than all whites and
that is simply not true." This is a good
point. Clearly the best type of affir
mative action program would not
consider race at all but rather study
each individual's background to see
how he or she might have been dis
advantaged and give special consid
eration on this basis. However, to be
fair one would require a comprehen
sive view of the family, social, cul
tural and educational past of each
applicant. Unfortunately, this infor
mation is limited and so are the
methods for objectifying it.
While our knowledge of individu
als may be limited, we do, however,
know certain things about groups.
We know for instance, that blacks, as
a group, are enormously less
privileged than whites. By giving
blacks and other minorities prefer
ence we will be promoting justice on
the whole, even though there maybe
individual exceptions.
Many other elements of public pol
icy justifiably operate in this fashion.
Welfare, for example, divides society
into income groups, assuming that
everybody under a certain income
needs help to buy adequate food.
Maybe there is someone who needs
to eat very little, has a vegetable gar
den in his back yard and may not in
fact need food stamps. The expense
of obtaining this information would
end up hurting everyone. So, in spite
of some exceptions, we settle for in
come as an approximation of need.

But it will still be objected that race
is an unfair way of approximating so
cial disadvantage. The example often
cited is that of the overprivileged
minority who gets accepted over the
disadvantaged white. Vet in cases
where a minority is obviously advan
taged, a university could choose not
to give preference to an obviously

underprivileged white applicant.
But in the majority of cases there are
no such objective signs of social for
tune. In these cases one will be jus
tified in assuming a minority disad
vantage.
The real issue, however, isn't
whether or not affirmative action is
fair in rewarding merit. With or with
out affirmative action our society is
still not a meritocracy. There are ra
cial inequalities on every level which
prohibit this. In a true meritocracy
there is equal opportunity for
everyone from age ?ero on up. In this
way merit will manifest itself objec
tively in qualifications and achieve
ments; there will be no need to give
special consideration to any group.
The real issue here is how do we
bring about this ideal society, (Or,
more to the point, how do we cor
rect the racial inequalities which un
dermine it?)
Unfortunately, these inequalities
will not correct themselves.
Minorities will continue to have in
ferior jobs and education; their chil
dren will therefore be disadvan
taged, and the whole vicious cycle
will start all over again. It seems to
me that there are two ways to break
this cycle: affirmative action or
struggle on the part of individual
minorities.
Sneed seems to think struggle is
somehowthe morenoblealternative.
He waxed poetic as he told us how
his great-grandfather struggled to
overcome the 19th century prejudice
against Irish. The implication is: "we
had to do it, so should they." This
idea is callous and destructive. One
should not use one's own hardship
to justify that of others.
Nobility aside, affirmative action
seems to be a far better policy. It
involves less human misery and grea
ter expediency than any type of so
cial Darwinist alternative. If we are to
one day attain the meritocracy which
Sneed so reveres, we must start by
rectifying the racial inequalities
which exist today. Affirmative action,
though unpalatable to some, is the
fairest and most effective way of
doing this.
