# Unanimous resolution favors 'free and open inquiry'
## Faculty Senate supports Roth, Umnov 
### Jeff Biddulph 
In the first show of a unified stance supporting
faculty members who refused to restrict the re
search freedom of Soviet scholar Nikolay Umnov,
the Faculty Senate approved unanimously last
night a resolution affirming that the University
"operates in — and wishes to preserve — an envi
ronment of free and open intellectual inquiry."
The resolution was the first of its kind signifying
that the entire faculty supports Mechanical En
gineering Prof. Bernard Roth's decision to deny a
State Department recommendation to limit Um
nov's research in robotics here.
The statement, written by Senate Chairman
David Abernethy, cites as its support a decision in
1969 by the Faculty Senate which asserts that "the

principle of openness in research ... is one of
overriding importance." Entitled "Policy
Guidelines on Secrecy in Research," the 1969 rul
ing maintains that "no program of research that
requires secrecy ... be conducted" here.
Umnov, a Soviet specialist in robotics, was in
vited to the University last year to research the
facilities in that field here. The State Department
then asked Roth, Umnov's host, to limit Umnov's
research, something which Roth refused to do.
The State Department then cancelled Umnov's
visit, but the University has re-extended its invita
tion to the scholar. Currently University officials
are not sure whether Umnov will visit here.
Abernethy told the Senate that the resolution
gives faculty members a chance to concur publicly
with stands made by University President Donald

Kennedy, Vice President of Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig and Dean of Graduate Studies Gerald
Lieberman.
He also said that the resolution only reaffirmed
University policy defined in the 1969 guideline.
The statement would also not imply that gov
ernment officials do not have the authority to write
regulations concerning such events in the future,
or to decide what areas of research are classified,
Abernethy said.
"The resolution is phrased simply to take fully
into account the case for the positive links bet
ween an open university, an open society worth
defending and our ability to defend ourselves
through rapidly advancing scientific exploration,"
Abernethy told the Senate.
