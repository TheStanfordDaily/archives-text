# Exploration of foreign lifestyles

Unusual, reedy music fills
the air of the Bechtel Interna
tional Center. A group of high
school students stands in a cir
cle with clasped arms, trying to
learn a Turkish folk dance that
collapses into laughter and
confused hopping. Finally, the
music stops.
"The second dance is a lot
harder," exclaims a heavily
accented voice from some
where within the center of the
group. His statement is met by
laughter and hopeless smiles.
He is one of the Turkish in
structors at the "Experience
Another Culture at Stanford"
program.
The cultural program in
volves a series of workshops
which emphasize personal in
teraction with international
college students. The work
shops, held Saturdays Feb. 20
and 27 and March 6, give
Peninsula High School stu
dents a chance to learn about
the cultures of Japan, Korea,
Turkey, India, West Africa and
the Arab world.
The program was started last
year by Lee Ziegler, Bechtel di
rector. Ziegler is one of the
overall organizers of the work
shops, providing funds and
overseeing various activities.
"We have very rich re
sources in our international
students here," said Ziegler.
"We wanted to make high
school students more aware
about other cultures."
Last year Ziegler applied to
the National Association of
Foreign Student Affairs to ob

tain funding for the project,
and that organization sent the
center $1500. Ziegler found
that the workshops were such
a success that he decided to
make them into an annual
program, and this meant that a
new sponsor had to be found
for this year.
The Rotary Club of Palo Alto
soon opted to fulfill this func
tion. Rotary is known for its
frequent donations to youth
projects, and its pledge of ser
vice toward anything that pro
motes international under
standing.
The workshops are attended
by 150 students from 10 Bay
Area high schools. These stu
dents were selected to come to
the center because of their in
terest in international studies,
based on applications or essays
they submitted to their indi
vidual schools.
Kristin Moore, a student at
Mountain View High School
who attended the Feb. 27
seminars on Indian lifestyle,
seemed to enjoy herself. "I
think it's really interesting to
learn about new cultures,"
Moore said. "It's interesting to
learn how similar people are
but how different their cus
toms can be."
The high schoolers are in
structed by 15 foreign stu
dents, former students, or
spouses of students here at the
University from each country
or group represented.
The subjects of these infor
mal lectures varied greatly.
There were demonstrations of
yoga, Indian and Turkish art
and cooking, language les

sons, music and dancing.
"The program is valuable not
only in terms of the cultural ex
change, but because talking
about the realities of world af
fairs can help to influence the
decisions taken by young
people," said Nesim Erkip, a
Ph.D. student in engineering
here.
Another one of the interna
tional students,Renu Prasad, a
former student here who
worked with the Indian group,
commented on the goal of the
workshops. "The workshops
help to eliminate the typical
stereotypes that students

might have about a developing
country, and they help to pro
mote understanding," Prasad
said.
The program itself stems
from a nationwide concern
over the lack of foreign lan
guage and cultural exchange
among American high school
students. By bringing students
into close contact with people
from other cultures, Ziegler
and his associates hope to
bring an understanding of the
lifestyles of people outside of
America. And as Kristin Moore
said, "It's just a fun way to
spend the day."
