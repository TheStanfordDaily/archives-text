## Brennan alters line-up 
### Sid Spaeth 
After coasting by Clemson 9-0
yesterday, Stanford women's
tennis coach Frank Brennan will
take advantage of lenient tour
nament rules to shuffle his
line-up before today's critical
match with Trinity.
The No. 1 seeded Cardinal
faces a No. 4 Trinity team that
returns all members from last
year's national AIAW runner
up squad and has added some
talented freshmen in the Na
tional Indoor Tennis Champ
ionships.
Brennan will move No. 2
singles player Elise Burgin to
the No. 1 position and drop
Alycia Moulton to the No. 2
spot. Kate Gompert will remain
at No. 3.
"Right now, we're in a posi
tion where we have excellent
players at our top three spots,"
Brennan explained. "Gompert
our No. 3 player could play No.
1 on a lot of the teams here.
Burgin was ranked No. 2 at na
tionals last year and actually
beat Alycia once last year.
Alycia has been runner-up in
the AlAW's the last two years

along with winning the dou
bles twice."
Brennan will keep Linda
Gates at No. 4, but move Caryn
Copeland to No. 5 and
Michelle Weiss to No. 6.
"Gates is playing a little bet
ter than Garyn and Michelle,
right now," Brennan continued.
"Caryn and Michelle are also
playing well, but Linda has just
been on a tear. There hasn't
been much difference bet
ween the play of Caryn and
Michelle so I'm going to flop
them for a while
"It's still early in the season
so it's good to see players at
different positions," Brennan
continued. "It also gives the
girls who are going to have
trouble qualifying for nationals
to get a crack at some of the
girls who are going to be their
competition."
Brennan will leave his solid
double corps intact. Defend
ing AIAW champions Moulton
and Copeland will play No. 1
after receiving a breather
against Clemson yesterday.
Burgin-Gates will play No. 2
and Weiss-Gompert will play
the final spot.

Against Clemson, Stanford
breezed through the singles
without dropping a match to
clinch the win early.
Moulton was taken to three
sets at No. 1 after losing
concentration in the second,
but came back strong to mop
up Jane Forman 6-2 4-6 6-1.
"Alycia lost her concentra
tion in the second set," Brennan
said, "She got off to a fast start
and began looking around and
watching the other matches."
"Compert played well and
only lost one game," Brennan
continued. "She's really an in
tense competitor. She doesn't
get sloppy with games after she
takes control of the match."
The Cardinal will play Florida
Saturday. The eight teams are
divided into two four-team di
visions that play a round robin
tournament. Division winners
meet on Sunday for the champ
ionship.
In the other division, No. 2
seeded UCLA rolled over In
diana 8-1 and No. 3 seeded
USC blanked Miami 9-0, yes
terday.
USC meets UCLA today in
another crucial match.
