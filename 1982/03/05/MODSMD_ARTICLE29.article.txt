Closing out a fantastic sea
son, Cardinal women's bas
ketball has gained a new re
spectability and a new spot in
the realm of Stanford athletics.
After winning at the University
of San Francisco 66-60 on
Wednesday night, the team is
preparing for the first round of
the NCAA regional playoffs,
beginning next week.
It was a long hard road to this
playoff berth, which wasn't re
ally in sight until Stanford's
upset of San Jose State on Feb.
20. Since then, a steady succes
sion of wins, ending with
Wednesday's victory, made
the playoffs more and more of a
possibility, until the spot was
clinched late last week.
The game at USF was not one

of the Cards' better efforts, de
spite the fairly easy win. "We
were a little bit sluggish," said
head coach Dotty McCrea. "It
was not the most artistic
game."
Nevertheless, they wereable
to hold onto the lead without
much difficulty, and several
individuals did have good
games. Senior forward Louise
Smith who spent much of the
season benched with
mononucleosis, was playing
full-force. She scored a game
high 27 points, also her per
sonal season high. Junior
center Meg Met7ger, who has
been exceptional all year,
scored 15 points. Finally, for
ward Jeanne Rurak Hotf kept
the team alive with outstanding
defensive play.

"It was a great season," said
McCrea. "Now we're ready to
start another." With a record
like 19-7, things look bright for
the Cardinal women. They are
9-3 in the Northern California
Conference, and unchal
lenged for their second-place
spot behind Cal. Berkeley,
however will not be a threat in
the playoffs, as they are mem
bers of the AIAW rather than
the NCAA conference.
McCrea's team will take a
rest from practice this
weekend, during which their
opponents in the first round
will be announced. The Cardi
nal will return to work on
Monday in preparation for a
first crucial playoff game late
next week somewhere on the
road.
