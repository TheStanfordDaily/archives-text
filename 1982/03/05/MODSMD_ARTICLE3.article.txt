# Officials fight loan cutbacks

University Public Affairs officials
are currently lobbying Congress to
reject or modify President Ronald
Reagan's proposed 1982-83 budget,
under which Stanford would lose
approximately $4.8 million in loan
funds, and graduate and profes
sional students would be declared
ineligible for any funds disbursed
through the Guaranteed Student
Loan (GSL) program.
"Even some Republicans in Con
gress are increasingly critical of stu
dent aid cuts," said Larry Horton,
University director of governmental
relations. "We hope we can not only
stop the knife from going deeper but
restore some of the funds as well."
In order to lobby successfully,
Horton said that two factors — timing
and organization — are necessities.
The Reagan budget, which was sub
mitted to Congress Feb. 8, is pre
sently under review by the approp
riate congressional committees, and
is in "a state of flux," according to
Horton. "It's hard to predict what
will happen," he said, but "the wet
ter the ink, or better, getting to
people before the ink is on paper,"is
the most effective way to achieve re
sults. _
While dealing with national issues,
it is also very important to work in
coalition, Horton said. "It's wise to
coordinate activities; also, if we're
hurt badly, others must be hurt
worse." Consequently, the Univer
sity is lobbying against federal fund
ing cuts in concert with the Associa
tion of American Universities (AAU),
the Consortium for Financing of
Higher Education and the Associa
tion of Independent California Col

leges and Universities (AICCU).
These groups are more organized
this year than last, when Reagan got
his budget through Congress with a
minimum of opposition, according
to Horton. "Lots of Democratic con
gressmen are taking this very seri
ously," he said.
Underlying all lobbying efforts are
the twin goals of "understanding the
budget process so we can intervene
at the proper times" and "letting
people know what we think," ac
cording to Horton.
For the most part, though, "we
have to choose one or two issues,"
said Bob Freelen, associatevice pres
ident for public affairs.
This year, the University chose to
focus on countering Reagan's plan to
make graduate students ineligible
forGSLs. If theplandoes go through,
graduate and professional students
will have to turn to Auxiliary Loans to
Assist Students (ALAS). Under the
terms of this program, students
would have to pay interest and begin
loan repayments while still in school.
"We try to make a strong case for
each item," Horton said.
Numerous other student aid prog
rams are endangered to various de
grees. Budget projections circulated
by Financial Aids Director Robert
Huff estimate that Stanford alone
stands to lose about $547,000 next
year and about $2 million in 1983-84.
Pell Grants would lose around
$200,000; the State Student Incentive
Grant (SSIG), which subsidizes Cal
Grants, would be entirely elimi
nated; and $89,000 (about 13 per
cent) would be lopped off of Na-

tional Direct Student Loan (NDSL)
funds.
However, "lots of other institu
tions and organizations are already
focusing on undergraduate educa
tion," Freelen said. "We'll send let
ters and provide background infor
mation, but we don't want to be in
leadership roles" on those issues.
"We chose the GSL program be
cause there are fewer institutions in
the country which emphasize
graduate education to the extent that
we and the other AAU schools do,"
Freelen said. "Also, there is some
what more sympathy in Congress
and with Reagan for undergraduate
education."
Area legislators expressed mixed
emotions about the proposed GSL
and other student aid cuts.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), in
an as-yet-unpublished statement cal
led the plan "an appalling tragedy,"
and said that "it is ironic that as we
build and prepare our nation for the
21st century we concurrently destroy
the basis upon which our nation de
pends." The former economics pro
fessor at San Francisco State Univer
sity, who will begin to represent
Stanford in November when Con
gressional redistricting takes effect,
promised to do "everything physi
cally, intellectually and politically
possible to turn it around."
In contrast, Rep. Paul "Pete"
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park), told the
Daily in a telephone interview yes
terday that he doesn't believe,
everyone has a right to go to college.
He said he felt that young people
