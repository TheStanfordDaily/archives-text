# Stanford plays Cal: closes long season
## 
### Steve Odell Senior sports writer 
The curtain closes this
weekend on the Stanford bas
ketball team's dramatic tragedy
called 1981-82, with a final per
formance Saturday night
against California at Berkeley's
Harmon Gym at 8 p.m.
The Cardinal (2-15 in thecon
ference, 7-20 overall) added to
their frustration with two nar
row losses last weekend
against Arizona (72-67) and
Arizona State (70-69), driving
their losing streak to seven
games. Stanford has lost 14 of
their last 15 games, all Pacific
-10 contests.
It will be the last appearance
as Cardinal coach for Dick Di-
Biaso, who announced his res
ignation last month. It will also
mark the final game in a Stan
ford uniform for seniors Brian
Welch, Orlando Ward, and
Doug Marty. „
"I can't fault our players for
effort," said Dißiaso. "We've
played as hard as humanly pos
sible, bul the injuries and lack
of depth have taken their toll. A
victory in the final game would
provide some satisfication for
all of us."
The game takes on a little
more significance for the
Bears, as a victory would pro
vide Cal with a winning season.
The Bears stand at 13-13 overall
after dismissing witli both
Arizona (63-59) and Arizona
State (70-65) last weekend.
A winning season would be
Coach Dick Kuchen's first ever
at Cal., and the first in Berkeley
since Dick Edwards 1974-75
squad finished at 17-9.
The main impetus behind
the Bears' mild success this
season is Cal's anything-but
mild center Mark McNamara.
The six-foot-11 senior is lead
ing the Pac-10 in scoring (21.9),
rebounding (12.8), and field
goal percentage (.695).
McNamara suffered a
sprained ankle last weekend

against ASU, but should be
healthy for the game with Stan
ford.
"Offensively, McNamara
can dictate a game near the
basket area," said Dißiaso.
"He's been the most produc
tive center in the conference
this year, and I'm sure he'll be a
factor in his final collegiate
game."
McNamara will be qppqsed
in the pivot by Stanford's most
steady performer, center John
Revelli. The sophomore from
Scarsdale, N.V. combined for
48 points and 17 rebounds in
the Arizona losses last
weekend, and he netted a
career-high 27 points the last
time Stanford met Cal, an 87-78
Bear win in Maples Pavilion in
January.
Welch, the Cardinal's sec
ond leading scorer this season,
currently ranks as the sixth
most prolific point scorer in
Stanford history. Welch has
1407 points going into his final
game, and could surpass No. 5
Rich Kelly (1412) and No. 4 Ron
Tomsic (1416) Saturday.

•Stanford freshman forward
Johnny Rogers was named to
the Pac-10's All Rookie team
Wednesday.
Rogers scored 326 points this
year — 36 shy of teammate Re
vel li's record 362 points scored
as a rookie last year.
Rogers has shot 55 percent
from the field this season and
82 percent from the free throw
line.

• Revelli was named to the
Pac-10's All-Conference team
Wednesday. Revelli has shot til
percent from the field this sea
son and leads Stanford in scor
ing and rebounding. Revelli
helped out with Stanford's
depth problems by curing his
fouling-out tendencies of a
year ago.

in the pivot by Stanford's most
steady performer, center John
Revelli. The sophomore from
Scarsdale, N.V. combined for
48 points and 17 rebounds in
the Arizona losses last
weekend, and he netted a
career-high 27 points the last
time Stanford met Cal, an 87-78
Bear win in Maples Pavilion in
January.
Welch, the Cardinal's sec
ond leading scorer this season,
currently ranks as the sixth
most prolific point scorer in
Stanford history. Welch has
1407 points going into his final
game, and could surpass No. 5
Rich Kelly (1412) and No. 4 Ron
Tomsic (1416) Saturday.

Rookie of the year
Stanford forward Johnny Rogers was awarded Pac-tO All-
Rookie Honors Wednesday and center John Revelli was
named to the conference All-Star team. Rogers and Rev
elli lead Stanford against California in the final basketball
game of the season tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley's
Harmon Gymnasium.
The curtain closes this
weekend on the Stanford bas
ketball team's dramatic tragedy
called 1981-82, with a final per
formance Saturday night
against California at Berkeley's
Harmon Gym at 8 p.m.
The Cardinal (2-15 in thecon
ference, 7-20 overall) added to
their frustration with two nar
row losses last weekend
against Arizona (72-67) and
Arizona State (70-69), driving
their losing streak to seven
games. Stanford has lost 14 of
their last 15 games, all Pacific
-10 contests.
It will be the last appearance
as Cardinal coach for Dick Di-
Biaso, who announced his res
ignation last month. It will also
mark the final game in a Stan
ford uniform for seniors Brian
Welch, Orlando Ward, and
Doug Marty. „
"I can't fault our players for
effort," said Dißiaso. "We've
played as hard as humanly pos
sible, bul the injuries and lack
of depth have taken their toll. A
victory in the final game would
provide some satisfication for
all of us."
The game takes on a little
more significance for the
Bears, as a victory would pro
vide Cal with a winning season.
The Bears stand at 13-13 overall
after dismissing witli both
Arizona (63-59) and Arizona
State (70-65) last weekend.
A winning season would be
Coach Dick Kuchen's first ever
at Cal., and the first in Berkeley
since Dick Edwards 1974-75
squad finished at 17-9.
The main impetus behind
the Bears' mild success this
season is Cal's anything-but
mild center Mark McNamara.
The six-foot-11 senior is lead
ing the Pac-10 in scoring (21.9),
rebounding (12.8), and field
goal percentage (.695).
McNamara suffered a
sprained ankle last weekend

against ASU, but should be
healthy for the game with Stan
ford.
"Offensively, McNamara
can dictate a game near the
basket area," said Dißiaso.
"He's been the most produc
tive center in the conference
this year, and I'm sure he'll be a
factor in his final collegiate
game."
