## 
### Adam Berns 
I Junior centerfielder Darryl
Stephens was hit by a pitch in
the bottom of the 10th inning,
with the bases loaded to give
Stanford a 2-1 non-league vic
tpry over the University of
Santa Clara.
I Sophomore Greg Lorenzetti
was the driving force behind
Stanford's close win last Wed
-1 Lorenzetti, who is playing for
the injured Eric Hardgrave,
went three for four and drove
in the tying run in the bottom
of the ninth to send the game
into extra innings.
Wednesday's game was also
an opportunity for Stanford
coach Mark Marquess to
work-in a lot of his lesser used
pitchers.
Sophomore Steve Cottrell
pitched the first two innings
without giving up a run. Doug
Cwaltney pitched the third and
fourth innings, giving up the
Bronco's only run. Freshmen
Steve Stark and David Harris
also pitched two innings each.
Senior reliever Mike Sullivan
pitched the eighth, ninth, and
10th innings and picked up the
victory boosting his record to
3-0. Reliever Bill Conrad got
the loss for Santa Clara.
Santa Clara scored the
game's first run in the third in
ning. With two outs, sopho
more infielder Rich Martig
doubled. Outfielder Dave
Olivia then hita bloop single to
right field, scoring Martig.
Olivia was then picked off first
base to end the inning.
Santa Clara held the lead!
until the bottom of the ninth
inning. Steve Buechelle led off
the inning with a walk.
Freshman Pete Stanicek, who
went in to pinch run for
Buechelle, moved to second
on a sacrifice by Stephens.
Lorenzetti then came to the
plate and hit a sharp single to
right field scoring Stanicek and
sending the game into extra
innings.
In the bottom of the 10th,
third baseman Loring Davies
started the inning with a walk.
He then moved to second on a
sacrifice bunt by Bob DeCosta.
Rightfielder Mike Toothman
was intentionally walked. With
runners on first and second
base, Stanicek hit an infield

single to load the bases.
Bronco reliever Mark Miller
came in for pitcher Bill Conrad
and Stanford centerfielder
Darryl Stephenscameuptothe
plate. Stephens, who last sea
son set the Stanford single re
cord for being hit by pitches,
took a ball in the side of his
body. This forced in Davies,
giving the Cardinal a 2-1 vic
tory.
After the game, Lorenzetti
credited the victory to Mar
quess'coachingability. "When
you win close games, it is
mostly because of the coach
ing," he said following the
game.
Although Stanford still is not
hitting the ball as well as Mar
quess would like, Wednes
day's victory showed that Stan
ford not only has an outstand
ing starting pitching rotation,
but also had great depth as
well.
"All of the pitchers did an
outstanding job," Marquess
said. "We wanted to use four
or five pitchers. I was espe
cially impressed with (Steve)
Conttrell. He pitched the best
he has all year."
This weekend the Cardinal
travels to Southern California
to take on USC, currently in a
three-way tiewith Stanfordand
Arizona State for the confer
ence lead.
Last week, USC beat No. 3
UCLA in two of three games
and now has a 2-1 conference
record.
