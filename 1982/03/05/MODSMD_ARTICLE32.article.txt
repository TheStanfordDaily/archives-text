Stanford is heavily favored
going into tomorrow night's
Northern California Women's
Gymnastics Championships at
Berkeley's Harmon Gym
nasium.
The Cardinal, led by sopho
more Merilyn Chapman, will
be challenged by California,
Fresno State and San lose
State, but only a dramatic upset
will keep them from the title.
"We'd have to fall flat on our
faces not to dominate this
meet," coach Homer Sardinia
said. "We could conceivably
place 1-2-3-4-5 in the all
around.
"We're gearing up for reg

ionals next weekend," Sardinia
continued. "We're shooting
for a school record in points
this weekend so we don't lose
our competitive edge. We
know our conference is not
that strong so we have to set
personal goals not to overlook
this meet."
Sardinia said Chapman is
"obviously a superstar" but
can only be as good as the rest
of the team.
"Our depth is just remarka
ble," Sardinia said. "Kim
(Strauss) has done a great job
toward the end of the season
and Angie (Barnes) has also
done well. She is averaging
9.o's on all events the last

couple of meets."
"I could just go through our
whole roster and tell of the im
provements because it has
been so great toward the end
of the season."
Also competing for Stanford
will be Carlyn Tarkington,
Anne Smith and Julie Bledsoe.
"Our goal all season has
been to qualify for nationals as
a team," Sardinia said. "We
want to be the first Stanford
team to qualify for the nation
als. We've been having hard
workouts all this week so we
can get used to competing on a
day-to-day basis again. Our
real test will come next
weekend."
