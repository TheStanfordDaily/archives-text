## Seven years late 
### 
Having been a spectator
at all but one of Stanford's
home games in each of the
last two years, I beg to differ
with Andy Brandt's asser
tion (Daily, March 3) that
"Dißiaso deserves a lot
more credit than he has
been given, especially for
this past season."
First, Brandt praises
the Card's early season
drubbing of "Ivy League
power" (if you've ever seen
any of the Ivies play besides
some of the past Penn and
Princeton clubs you'll rec
ognize a contradiction in
terms) Harvard as signific
ant. My suspicions were
confirmed when I grabbed
the Chronicle and found
Harvard ranked sixth in the
Ivy League with a 4-7 ieague
mark and 9-14 overall. Some
power.
Secondly, Brandt cites
each of the efforts against
"the nation's most talented
team," UCLA, as noble.
Well, I haven't seen UCLA
among the top 15 teams in
either of the writer's polls
lately, and to assert that they
have more talent than North
Carolina, among others, is
ludicrous. Brandt implies
that holding UCLA to 42
points was a great defensive
effort, when it was actually
the result of delay games by
both sides, or that playing
one good half in Los
Angeles is enough for the
talent that Dißiaso has.
I contend, on the other

hand, that Dißiaso took last
year's Pac-10 rookie of the
year, John Revelli, a blue
chip recruit in Johnny Rod
gers, veteran shooting for
ward Brian Welch, along
with some promising un
derclassmen and created a
listless squad that defeated
one conference team (Ore
gon). He did this, not
through poor game plans,
but by forgetting his
simplest job — instilling in
tensity.
Night after night I'd watch
as the Card failed to dive for
loose balls, failed to execute
on offense, failed to hustle
back on defense, and failed
to play tough defense once
they got to the other end.
In his final game at
Maples, Doug Marty
showed Dißiaso how it
should have been done all
year long. He challenged
Arizona defensively and
when the rest of the team
followed his example,
Arizona coughed the ball up
a few times and Stanford —
and the crowd — was back
in the ballgame. Defense
doesn't take any new
players or new talent, just a
lot of desire.
Arizona State and Cal
lost key players this year and
won more than two league
contests. Ralph Miller has
won titles with less talent
than UCLA. Dißiaso has had
seven years to produce a
winner. Enough. Bring on
Bobby Knight.
