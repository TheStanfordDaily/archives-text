## 'Shoot the Moon': domestic pain in tears and blood 
### 
The most tiresome kind of
criticism leveled at American
actors is that they're always the
same. I've heard this comment
made about the most amazing
performers — Marlon Brando,
Robert DeNiro, Katharine
Hepburn, Jack Nicholson,
Dustin Hoffman — and it
always makes me wonder what
marvels an actor has to perform
in order to be considered ver

satile. Change his voice? Bran
do's done that; compare his
fragmented English in On the
Waterfront with the pre
posterous parody of an
aristocratic British accent in
Mutiny on the Bounty. Change
his body? DeNiro doesn't look
like the same person in Mean
Streets and Raging Bull.
Change his rhythm? Hoffman
accomplishes that within a sin
gle performance: the tense,
hurried executive in the early
scenes of Kramer vs. Kramer
turns into a slower-paced at
tentive parent in the course of
the movie. American actors,
especially American movie ac
tors, rely instinctively so much
more on their personalities
than, say, English actors that
there is an unfortunate ten
dency to see what they do
purely in terms of the personal
traits that distiguish them from
other performers and to ignore
the extreme difficulty of the
roles they may bring off or the
range they demonstrate. The
often-heard line, "Katharine
Hepburn always acts like
herself," ceases to have any
meaning when you consider
that in Long Day's Journey into
Night she displays a greater
emotional range than most
performers show in a lifetime.
And can anyone who thinks
that Jack Nicholson keeps giv
ing the same performance real
ly have watched him in The Last
Detail, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, The Missouri
Breaks and The Border?
Several of my friends com
plained that they just couldn't
believe Diane Keaton as Louise
Bryant in Reds, that all they saw
was the sweet, hazy neurotic of
Annie Hall. If so, the fault does
not lie with Keaton, who hasn't
given that performance in five
years. I suspect that the lack of
attention accorded her work in
Manhattan was largely due to
the fact that since she was
playing opposite Woody Allen
again, she was assumed to be

doing much the same thing she
had done in Annie Hall, when
in fact if the two pictures were
screened back to back we
might be surprised to see how
much stronger, sharper and
(courageously) less sympa
thetic she is in the later film. In
the first half of Reds, she coasts
on the appeal of her person
ality to a certain extent, it's
true, but the shape of the role

doesn't allow her to take it very
far, and in the second part both
Louise and Keaton attain real
maturity. How could anyone
confuse the precision of the si
lent sequence at the train sta
tion where Louise searches for
jack Reed with anything in An
nie Hall? The typing of actors
used to be blamed on studio
publicity, but these days it's
more likely to be the fault of
moviegoers who don't watch
what actors are really doing.
As Faith Dunlap in the new
Shoot the Moon, Diane Keaton
gives the best performance
I've seen from any American
actress in over a decade. It's the
kind of acting that is authentic
in every detail because it seems
to have been dug from the
bowels — like Brando's in Last
Tango in Paris, like Jane Fon
da's in Klute. Faith is the wife of
a prize-winning author,
George (Albert Finney) and the
mother of four girls (Dana Hill,
Viveka Davis, Tracey Gold, Tina

Yothers), and her marriage is
falling apart; when she de
duces that George is sleeping
with another woman (Sandy,
played by Karen Allen), she
packs his bag and throws him
out. Shoot the Moon, which
was written by Bo Goldman
and directed by Alan Parker,
deals with the process of
estrangement between hus
band and wife, parents and
children, with the interior con
flict between love and resent-

ment that separation causes to
surface and that most people
spend their lives trying to re
solve.
Faith is in agony from the
outset of the film: at the book
awards banquet where George
is lauded, she forces herself to
act the role of the supportive
wife though she knows that the
remnants of their marriage are
going to shatter as soon as they
return home. Keaton says
almost nothing in these early
scenes, but her tension in the
car on the way to the dinner,
her pain in the moment im
mediately after George has ac
cepted the honor and dedi
cated it to her, and her face in
the car afterwards, looking old
and scarred as she holds the
award in her lap, articulate
Faith's inner turmoil. Keaton
does something I thought only
Katharine Hepburn in Long
Day's Journey could pull off:
she uses the emotional equip
ment of the character she is
playing to vary her age. It's a
much younger Faith who flirts,
half-terrified, with Frank (Peter
Weller), the workman who has
contracted to build a tennis
court in her backyard, a much
older Faith who lies awkwardly
to her dying father (George
Murdock) about the state of
her marriage. Keaton's line
readings are marvelous, but
she creates Faith with her en
tire body, and she achieves
astonishing feats with it. I can't
ever recall seeing an actress
look blurred and jagged at the
same time before; it's a brilliant
emblem for emotional distress.
No one wins in this movie,
and in terms of the acting that
means that everyone's a win
ner. Albert Finney's per
formance equals Keaton's; af
ter making a career of playing
inaccessible brooders, he final
ly shows the kind of commit
ment to a role that is a little
frightening. There's a great
scene in Last Tango in which

Brando, for no stated reason,
starts to cry; without the as
sistance of a carefully struc
tured context, this must con
stitute the most rigorous de
mand a director can make on
an actor — pure emotion. Fin
ney's performance in Shoot the
Moon starts out with such a
scene — and it grows from
there. George's extramarital
involvement precipitates the
break-up, but he is no more or
less responsible for the dis-

astrous state of the marriage
than Faith, and no better
equipped to deal with the re
verberations of his departure
from the house. Finney shows
us a man who wants his family
to stay the same even though
he is no longer a part of it: he
opposes Faith's building the
tennis court because he abhors
the thought of the physical al
teration of the property he
used to share with her and with
their children — just as he
abhors the thought of Faith's
drinking wine with an old
friend on a date ("You hate
wine," he nags her) or sleeping
with Frank. And the most acute
ache of all for George is the bit
terness his eldest daughter,
Sherry (who must be 13 or so),
harbors against him when he
leaves.
This movie is as much about
parents and children as it is
about husbands and wives, and
Dana Hill, in the important role
of Sherry, acts with an intensity
and an emotional accuracy that
make her a third major player
in the film. In the last few years,
directors seem to have grown
aware of the necessity to
portray children in contem
porary movies as fully fleshed
out human beings and there
fore to cast performers who
can act truthfully rather than
simply mug endearingly in the
style of the Hollywood gamines
of the 19305; hence the emer
gence of Jodie Foster, Kristy
McNichol, Justin Henry and
other gifted young actors.
Dana Hill's performance in
Shoot the Moon illuminates
the complex of responses of a
mature, intelligent, sensitive
child to the dissolution of her
parents' marriage: the impulse
to behave in an adult fashion
for the sake of younger sibl
ings, the irresistible temptation
to play the parent with a now
single mother, the jealousy
over her father's time with an
other woman's child (Sandy
has a little boy), the massive ac
cumulation of blame leveled at
an absent parent — in this case,
of course, George. The conflict
between George and Sherry is
so highlycharged in this movie,
and almost entirely in scenes
that they don't share, because
Sherry wants nothing to do
with her father, or in moments
when their paths cross briefly
— she walks carefully past his
car without speaking to him,
steps into her school bus and
collapses in tears — that when
we finally get an extended con
versation between them, on
the dock outside Sandy's house
at night, it is an epiphany. And
like everything else in this mov
ie, it surpasses our expecta
tions.
The other daughters are sen
sitively portrayed, too; in fact,
the supporting cast is flawless.
George calls Frank "an overage
hippie," and Peter Weller does
give Frank a western '60s cool
that reflects without parody a
segment of the culture of

Marin County, where the mov
ie is laid. Frank is fascinating:
underneath the slightly be
hind-tempo passivity of this
man lies the capacity for vio
lence of a Hell's Angel. Karen
Allen's Sandy is a northern Cal
ifornian type, as well: unfail
ingly sweet and devoted to
George, but with enough self
possession and recognition of
her own needs to tell him, "If
you don't come through, I'll
find somebody else." And in
his single scene, George
Murdock gives Faith's father a
firm identity; it's a splendid
cameo.
The director, Alan Parker,
and the photographer,
Michael Seresin, so animate
the Victorian house where
Faith remains with her daugh
ter that it practically becomes

an additional protagonist, rath
er than just a means of tele
graphing the status of the char
acters, like the house in Or
dinary People. I don't know
how to account for Parker's
direction of this picture; I
thought his three earlier films
— Bugsy Malone, Midnight Ex
press and Fame — were thor
oughly artificial and despicably
manipulative, but I can't think
of more than two or three mo
ments in Shoot the Moon that
aren't graceful, genuine and
deeply moving. His work here
suggests a more agonized
domestic Renoir — like the
Irvin Kershner of Loving and

the non-fantasy sequences in
Up the Sandbox. In fact, in
mood and texture Shoot the
Moon sometimes recalls Lov
ing, a fine — now forgotten —
1970 drama in which George
Segal plays a kind of Saul
Bellow hero, a commercial ar
tist whose marriage and career
are falling apart. Parker sur
passes Kershner, though, in the
proliferation of immensely re
vealing small touches, like the
worried look on the face of one
of the girls as she watches her
mother struggling to get out of
bed in the morning, or the
carefully measured enthusiasm
both Faith and George employ
to get through a several-hours'
stretch of their children's high
spirits. The unfailing truthful
ness of Parker's depiction of
family existence exposes the

essential fraudulence ot a soap
opera like Ordinary People or
even Kramer vs. Kramer. This
movie signals Alan Parker's re
birth.
I wish I knew where Bo Gold
man learned to write this well.
His last script, Me/v/'n and
Howard, was such a wonderful
model of how to write
dialogue, character and milieu
that all screenwriters should be
required to study it; Shoot the
Moon, with its great double
pronged title (it refers ro going
for broke, as in a game of
hearts, as well as to the death of
romance), can lay claim to

being among the best film writ
ing ever done by an American.
Trying to explain to Sherry how
a marriage disintegrates, Faith
says, "You go through doors
together — and then some
body gets ahead." "Why don't
they wait for each other?"
Sherry demands. In another
scene, Faith sits in the bathtub
and sings the Beatles' "If I Fell"
absently to herself; suddenly
she realizes how relevant the
silly lyrics are to her own life.
Goldman and Parker have hit
on a brilliant insight here, I
think: at moments of crisis (or
tremendous happiness), our
feelings animate even the
cliches in pop songs and dumb
TV programs. There's another
idea implicit in the scene, too
— the characters in Shoot the
Moon live in a sort of nether

world where no subject is
"safe", no words are trivial.
O'Neill once confessed that
Long Day's Journey into Night
had been written in tears and
blood. I don't know what per
sonal hell Goldman dredged
up in order to be able to write
this film, but there are scenes in
it that brought back every dev
astating argument I ever over
heard, or participated in, as a
child as well as every marital
horror I've witnessed since.
Shoot the Moon may be the
most intense expression of
domestic pain ever conceived
for American movies.

out. Shoot the Moon, which
was written by Bo Goldman
and directed by Alan Parker,
deals with the process of
estrangement between hus
band and wife, parents and
children, with the interior con
flict between love and resent-

ment that separation causes to
surface and that most people
spend their lives trying to re
solve.
Faith is in agony from the
outset of the film: at the book
awards banquet where George
is lauded, she forces herself to
act the role of the supportive
wife though she knows that the
remnants of their marriage are
going to shatter as soon as they
return home. Keaton says
almost nothing in these early
scenes, but her tension in the
car on the way to the dinner,
her pain in the moment im
mediately after George has ac
cepted the honor and dedi
cated it to her, and her face in
the car afterwards, looking old
and scarred as she holds the
award in her lap, articulate
Faith's inner turmoil. Keaton
does something I thought only
Katharine Hepburn in Long
Day's Journey could pull off:
she uses the emotional equip
ment of the character she is
playing to vary her age. It's a
much younger Faith who flirts,
half-terrified, with Frank (Peter
Weller), the workman who has
contracted to build a tennis
court in her backyard, a much
older Faith who lies awkwardly
to her dying father (George
Murdock) about the state of
her marriage. Keaton's line
readings are marvelous, but
she creates Faith with her en
tire body, and she achieves
astonishing feats with it. I can't
ever recall seeing an actress
look blurred and jagged at the
same time before; it's a brilliant
emblem for emotional distress.
No one wins in this movie,
and in terms of the acting that
means that everyone's a win
ner. Albert Finney's per
formance equals Keaton's; af
ter making a career of playing
inaccessible brooders, he final
ly shows the kind of commit
ment to a role that is a little
frightening. There's a great
scene in Last Tango in which

Brando, for no stated reason,
starts to cry; without the as
sistance of a carefully struc
tured context, this must con
stitute the most rigorous de
mand a director can make on
an actor — pure emotion. Fin
ney's performance in Shoot the
Moon starts out with such a
scene — and it grows from
there. George's extramarital
involvement precipitates the
break-up, but he is no more or
less responsible for the dis-

astrous state of the marriage
than Faith, and no better
equipped to deal with the re
verberations of his departure
from the house. Finney shows
us a man who wants his family
to stay the same even though
he is no longer a part of it: he
opposes Faith's building the
tennis court because he abhors
the thought of the physical al
teration of the property he
used to share with her and with
their children — just as he
abhors the thought of Faith's
drinking wine with an old
friend on a date ("You hate
wine," he nags her) or sleeping
with Frank. And the most acute
ache of all for George is the bit
terness his eldest daughter,
Sherry (who must be 13 or so),
harbors against him when he
leaves.
This movie is as much about
parents and children as it is
about husbands and wives, and
Dana Hill, in the important role
of Sherry, acts with an intensity
and an emotional accuracy that
make her a third major player
in the film. In the last few years,
directors seem to have grown
aware of the necessity to
portray children in contem
porary movies as fully fleshed
out human beings and there
fore to cast performers who
can act truthfully rather than
simply mug endearingly in the
style of the Hollywood gamines
of the 19305; hence the emer
gence of Jodie Foster, Kristy
McNichol, Justin Henry and
other gifted young actors.
Dana Hill's performance in
Shoot the Moon illuminates
the complex of responses of a
mature, intelligent, sensitive
child to the dissolution of her
parents' marriage: the impulse
to behave in an adult fashion
for the sake of younger sibl
ings, the irresistible temptation
to play the parent with a now
single mother, the jealousy
over her father's time with an
other woman's child (Sandy
has a little boy), the massive ac
cumulation of blame leveled at
an absent parent — in this case,
of course, George. The conflict
between George and Sherry is
so highlycharged in this movie,
and almost entirely in scenes
that they don't share, because
Sherry wants nothing to do
with her father, or in moments
when their paths cross briefly
— she walks carefully past his
car without speaking to him,
steps into her school bus and
collapses in tears — that when
we finally get an extended con
versation between them, on
the dock outside Sandy's house
at night, it is an epiphany. And
like everything else in this mov
ie, it surpasses our expecta
tions.
The other daughters are sen
sitively portrayed, too; in fact,
the supporting cast is flawless.
George calls Frank "an overage
hippie," and Peter Weller does
give Frank a western '60s cool
that reflects without parody a
segment of the culture of

Marin County, where the mov
ie is laid. Frank is fascinating:
underneath the slightly be
hind-tempo passivity of this
man lies the capacity for vio
lence of a Hell's Angel. Karen
Allen's Sandy is a northern Cal
ifornian type, as well: unfail
ingly sweet and devoted to
George, but with enough self
possession and recognition of
her own needs to tell him, "If
you don't come through, I'll
find somebody else." And in
his single scene, George
Murdock gives Faith's father a
firm identity; it's a splendid
cameo.
The director, Alan Parker,
and the photographer,
Michael Seresin, so animate
the Victorian house where
Faith remains with her daugh
ter that it practically becomes

an additional protagonist, rath
er than just a means of tele
graphing the status of the char
acters, like the house in Or
dinary People. I don't know
how to account for Parker's
direction of this picture; I
thought his three earlier films
— Bugsy Malone, Midnight Ex
press and Fame — were thor
oughly artificial and despicably
manipulative, but I can't think
of more than two or three mo
ments in Shoot the Moon that
aren't graceful, genuine and
deeply moving. His work here
suggests a more agonized
domestic Renoir — like the
Irvin Kershner of Loving and

the non-fantasy sequences in
Up the Sandbox. In fact, in
mood and texture Shoot the
Moon sometimes recalls Lov
ing, a fine — now forgotten —
1970 drama in which George
Segal plays a kind of Saul
Bellow hero, a commercial ar
tist whose marriage and career
are falling apart. Parker sur
passes Kershner, though, in the
proliferation of immensely re
vealing small touches, like the
worried look on the face of one
of the girls as she watches her
mother struggling to get out of
bed in the morning, or the
carefully measured enthusiasm
both Faith and George employ
to get through a several-hours'
stretch of their children's high
spirits. The unfailing truthful
ness of Parker's depiction of
family existence exposes the

essential fraudulence ot a soap
opera like Ordinary People or
even Kramer vs. Kramer. This
movie signals Alan Parker's re
birth.
I wish I knew where Bo Gold
man learned to write this well.
His last script, Me/v/'n and
Howard, was such a wonderful
model of how to write
dialogue, character and milieu
that all screenwriters should be
required to study it; Shoot the
Moon, with its great double
pronged title (it refers ro going
for broke, as in a game of
hearts, as well as to the death of
romance), can lay claim to

being among the best film writ
ing ever done by an American.
Trying to explain to Sherry how
a marriage disintegrates, Faith
says, "You go through doors
together — and then some
body gets ahead." "Why don't
they wait for each other?"
Sherry demands. In another
scene, Faith sits in the bathtub
and sings the Beatles' "If I Fell"
absently to herself; suddenly
she realizes how relevant the
silly lyrics are to her own life.
Goldman and Parker have hit
on a brilliant insight here, I
think: at moments of crisis (or
tremendous happiness), our
feelings animate even the
cliches in pop songs and dumb
TV programs. There's another
idea implicit in the scene, too
— the characters in Shoot the
Moon live in a sort of nether

world where no subject is
"safe", no words are trivial.
O'Neill once confessed that
Long Day's Journey into Night
had been written in tears and
blood. I don't know what per
sonal hell Goldman dredged
up in order to be able to write
this film, but there are scenes in
it that brought back every dev
astating argument I ever over
heard, or participated in, as a
child as well as every marital
horror I've witnessed since.
Shoot the Moon may be the
most intense expression of
domestic pain ever conceived
for American movies.



Diane Keaton and Albert Finney, with their children in Shoot the Moon
The most tiresome kind of
criticism leveled at American
actors is that they're always the
same. I've heard this comment
made about the most amazing
performers — Marlon Brando,
Robert DeNiro, Katharine
Hepburn, Jack Nicholson,
Dustin Hoffman — and it
always makes me wonder what
marvels an actor has to perform
in order to be considered ver

satile. Change his voice? Bran
do's done that; compare his
fragmented English in On the
Waterfront with the pre
posterous parody of an
aristocratic British accent in
Mutiny on the Bounty. Change
his body? DeNiro doesn't look
like the same person in Mean
Streets and Raging Bull.
Change his rhythm? Hoffman
accomplishes that within a sin
gle performance: the tense,
hurried executive in the early
scenes of Kramer vs. Kramer
turns into a slower-paced at
tentive parent in the course of
the movie. American actors,
especially American movie ac
tors, rely instinctively so much
more on their personalities
than, say, English actors that
there is an unfortunate ten
dency to see what they do
purely in terms of the personal
traits that distiguish them from
other performers and to ignore
the extreme difficulty of the
roles they may bring off or the
range they demonstrate. The
often-heard line, "Katharine
Hepburn always acts like
herself," ceases to have any
meaning when you consider
that in Long Day's Journey into
Night she displays a greater
emotional range than most
performers show in a lifetime.
And can anyone who thinks
that Jack Nicholson keeps giv
ing the same performance real
ly have watched him in The Last
Detail, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, The Missouri
Breaks and The Border?
Several of my friends com
plained that they just couldn't
believe Diane Keaton as Louise
Bryant in Reds, that all they saw
was the sweet, hazy neurotic of
Annie Hall. If so, the fault does
not lie with Keaton, who hasn't
given that performance in five
years. I suspect that the lack of
attention accorded her work in
Manhattan was largely due to
the fact that since she was
playing opposite Woody Allen
again, she was assumed to be

doing much the same thing she
had done in Annie Hall, when
in fact if the two pictures were
screened back to back we
might be surprised to see how
much stronger, sharper and
(courageously) less sympa
thetic she is in the later film. In
the first half of Reds, she coasts
on the appeal of her person
ality to a certain extent, it's
true, but the shape of the role

doesn't allow her to take it very
far, and in the second part both
Louise and Keaton attain real
maturity. How could anyone
confuse the precision of the si
lent sequence at the train sta
tion where Louise searches for
jack Reed with anything in An
nie Hall? The typing of actors
used to be blamed on studio
publicity, but these days it's
more likely to be the fault of
moviegoers who don't watch
what actors are really doing.
As Faith Dunlap in the new
Shoot the Moon, Diane Keaton
gives the best performance
I've seen from any American
actress in over a decade. It's the
kind of acting that is authentic
in every detail because it seems
to have been dug from the
bowels — like Brando's in Last
Tango in Paris, like Jane Fon
da's in Klute. Faith is the wife of
a prize-winning author,
George (Albert Finney) and the
mother of four girls (Dana Hill,
Viveka Davis, Tracey Gold, Tina

child to the dissolution of her
parents' marriage: the impulse
to behave in an adult fashion
for the sake of younger sibl
ings, the irresistible temptation
to play the parent with a now
single mother, the jealousy
over her father's time with an
other woman's child (Sandy
has a little boy), the massive ac
cumulation of blame leveled at
an absent parent — in this case,
of course, George. The conflict
between George and Sherry is
so highlycharged in this movie,
and almost entirely in scenes
that they don't share, because
Sherry wants nothing to do
with her father, or in moments
when their paths cross briefly
— she walks carefully past his
car without speaking to him,
steps into her school bus and
collapses in tears — that when
we finally get an extended con
versation between them, on
the dock outside Sandy's house
at night, it is an epiphany. And
like everything else in this mov
ie, it surpasses our expecta
tions.
The other daughters are sen
sitively portrayed, too; in fact,
the supporting cast is flawless.
George calls Frank "an overage
hippie," and Peter Weller does
give Frank a western '60s cool
that reflects without parody a
segment of the culture of

Marin County, where the mov
ie is laid. Frank is fascinating:
underneath the slightly be
hind-tempo passivity of this
man lies the capacity for vio
lence of a Hell's Angel. Karen
Allen's Sandy is a northern Cal
ifornian type, as well: unfail
ingly sweet and devoted to
George, but with enough self
possession and recognition of
her own needs to tell him, "If
you don't come through, I'll
find somebody else." And in
his single scene, George
Murdock gives Faith's father a
firm identity; it's a splendid
cameo.
The director, Alan Parker,
and the photographer,
Michael Seresin, so animate
the Victorian house where
Faith remains with her daugh
ter that it practically becomes

an additional protagonist, rath
er than just a means of tele
graphing the status of the char
acters, like the house in Or
dinary People. I don't know
how to account for Parker's
direction of this picture; I
thought his three earlier films
— Bugsy Malone, Midnight Ex
press and Fame — were thor
oughly artificial and despicably
manipulative, but I can't think
of more than two or three mo
ments in Shoot the Moon that
aren't graceful, genuine and
deeply moving. His work here
suggests a more agonized
domestic Renoir — like the
Irvin Kershner of Loving and

the non-fantasy sequences in
Up the Sandbox. In fact, in
mood and texture Shoot the
Moon sometimes recalls Lov
ing, a fine — now forgotten —
1970 drama in which George
Segal plays a kind of Saul
Bellow hero, a commercial ar
tist whose marriage and career
are falling apart. Parker sur
passes Kershner, though, in the
proliferation of immensely re
vealing small touches, like the
worried look on the face of one
of the girls as she watches her
mother struggling to get out of
bed in the morning, or the
carefully measured enthusiasm
both Faith and George employ
to get through a several-hours'
stretch of their children's high
spirits. The unfailing truthful
ness of Parker's depiction of
family existence exposes the

essential fraudulence ot a soap
opera like Ordinary People or
even Kramer vs. Kramer. This
movie signals Alan Parker's re
birth.
I wish I knew where Bo Gold
man learned to write this well.
His last script, Me/v/'n and
Howard, was such a wonderful
model of how to write
dialogue, character and milieu
that all screenwriters should be
required to study it; Shoot the
Moon, with its great double
pronged title (it refers ro going
for broke, as in a game of
hearts, as well as to the death of
romance), can lay claim to

being among the best film writ
ing ever done by an American.
Trying to explain to Sherry how
a marriage disintegrates, Faith
says, "You go through doors
together — and then some
body gets ahead." "Why don't
they wait for each other?"
Sherry demands. In another
scene, Faith sits in the bathtub
and sings the Beatles' "If I Fell"
absently to herself; suddenly
she realizes how relevant the
silly lyrics are to her own life.
Goldman and Parker have hit
on a brilliant insight here, I
think: at moments of crisis (or
tremendous happiness), our
feelings animate even the
cliches in pop songs and dumb
TV programs. There's another
idea implicit in the scene, too
— the characters in Shoot the
Moon live in a sort of nether

world where no subject is
"safe", no words are trivial.
O'Neill once confessed that
Long Day's Journey into Night
had been written in tears and
blood. I don't know what per
sonal hell Goldman dredged
up in order to be able to write
this film, but there are scenes in
it that brought back every dev
astating argument I ever over
heard, or participated in, as a
child as well as every marital
horror I've witnessed since.
Shoot the Moon may be the
most intense expression of
domestic pain ever conceived
for American movies.



Diane Keaton and Albert Finney, with their children in Shoot the Moon
The most tiresome kind of
criticism leveled at American
actors is that they're always the
same. I've heard this comment
made about the most amazing
performers — Marlon Brando,
Robert DeNiro, Katharine
Hepburn, Jack Nicholson,
Dustin Hoffman — and it
always makes me wonder what
marvels an actor has to perform
in order to be considered ver

satile. Change his voice? Bran
do's done that; compare his
fragmented English in On the
Waterfront with the pre
posterous parody of an
aristocratic British accent in
Mutiny on the Bounty. Change
his body? DeNiro doesn't look
like the same person in Mean
Streets and Raging Bull.
Change his rhythm? Hoffman
accomplishes that within a sin
gle performance: the tense,
hurried executive in the early
scenes of Kramer vs. Kramer
turns into a slower-paced at
tentive parent in the course of
the movie. American actors,
especially American movie ac
tors, rely instinctively so much
more on their personalities
than, say, English actors that
there is an unfortunate ten
dency to see what they do
purely in terms of the personal
traits that distiguish them from
other performers and to ignore
the extreme difficulty of the
roles they may bring off or the
range they demonstrate. The
often-heard line, "Katharine
Hepburn always acts like
herself," ceases to have any
meaning when you consider
that in Long Day's Journey into
Night she displays a greater
emotional range than most
performers show in a lifetime.
And can anyone who thinks
that Jack Nicholson keeps giv
ing the same performance real
ly have watched him in The Last
Detail, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, The Missouri
Breaks and The Border?
Several of my friends com
plained that they just couldn't
believe Diane Keaton as Louise
Bryant in Reds, that all they saw
was the sweet, hazy neurotic of
Annie Hall. If so, the fault does
not lie with Keaton, who hasn't
given that performance in five
years. I suspect that the lack of
attention accorded her work in
Manhattan was largely due to
the fact that since she was
playing opposite Woody Allen
again, she was assumed to be

doing much the same thing she
had done in Annie Hall, when
in fact if the two pictures were
screened back to back we
might be surprised to see how
much stronger, sharper and
(courageously) less sympa
thetic she is in the later film. In
the first half of Reds, she coasts
on the appeal of her person
ality to a certain extent, it's
true, but the shape of the role

doesn't allow her to take it very
far, and in the second part both
Louise and Keaton attain real
maturity. How could anyone
confuse the precision of the si
lent sequence at the train sta
tion where Louise searches for
jack Reed with anything in An
nie Hall? The typing of actors
used to be blamed on studio
publicity, but these days it's
more likely to be the fault of
moviegoers who don't watch
what actors are really doing.
As Faith Dunlap in the new
Shoot the Moon, Diane Keaton
gives the best performance
I've seen from any American
actress in over a decade. It's the
kind of acting that is authentic
in every detail because it seems
to have been dug from the
bowels — like Brando's in Last
Tango in Paris, like Jane Fon
da's in Klute. Faith is the wife of
a prize-winning author,
George (Albert Finney) and the
mother of four girls (Dana Hill,
Viveka Davis, Tracey Gold, Tina

Yothers), and her marriage is
falling apart; when she de
duces that George is sleeping
with another woman (Sandy,
played by Karen Allen), she
packs his bag and throws him
out. Shoot the Moon, which
was written by Bo Goldman
and directed by Alan Parker,
deals with the process of
estrangement between hus
band and wife, parents and
children, with the interior con
flict between love and resent-

ment that separation causes to
surface and that most people
spend their lives trying to re
solve.
Faith is in agony from the
outset of the film: at the book
awards banquet where George
is lauded, she forces herself to
act the role of the supportive
wife though she knows that the
remnants of their marriage are
going to shatter as soon as they
return home. Keaton says
almost nothing in these early
scenes, but her tension in the
car on the way to the dinner,
her pain in the moment im
mediately after George has ac
cepted the honor and dedi
cated it to her, and her face in
the car afterwards, looking old
and scarred as she holds the
award in her lap, articulate
Faith's inner turmoil. Keaton
does something I thought only
Katharine Hepburn in Long
Day's Journey could pull off:
she uses the emotional equip
ment of the character she is
playing to vary her age. It's a
much younger Faith who flirts,
half-terrified, with Frank (Peter
Weller), the workman who has
contracted to build a tennis
court in her backyard, a much
older Faith who lies awkwardly
to her dying father (George
Murdock) about the state of
her marriage. Keaton's line
readings are marvelous, but
she creates Faith with her en
tire body, and she achieves
astonishing feats with it. I can't
ever recall seeing an actress
look blurred and jagged at the
same time before; it's a brilliant
emblem for emotional distress.
No one wins in this movie,
and in terms of the acting that
means that everyone's a win
ner. Albert Finney's per
formance equals Keaton's; af
ter making a career of playing
inaccessible brooders, he final
ly shows the kind of commit
ment to a role that is a little
frightening. There's a great
scene in Last Tango in which

Brando, for no stated reason,
starts to cry; without the as
sistance of a carefully struc
tured context, this must con
stitute the most rigorous de
mand a director can make on
an actor — pure emotion. Fin
ney's performance in Shoot the
Moon starts out with such a
scene — and it grows from
there. George's extramarital
involvement precipitates the
break-up, but he is no more or
less responsible for the dis-

astrous state of the marriage
than Faith, and no better
equipped to deal with the re
verberations of his departure
from the house. Finney shows
us a man who wants his family
to stay the same even though
he is no longer a part of it: he
opposes Faith's building the
tennis court because he abhors
the thought of the physical al
teration of the property he
used to share with her and with
their children — just as he
abhors the thought of Faith's
drinking wine with an old
friend on a date ("You hate
wine," he nags her) or sleeping
with Frank. And the most acute
ache of all for George is the bit
terness his eldest daughter,
Sherry (who must be 13 or so),
harbors against him when he
leaves.
This movie is as much about
parents and children as it is
about husbands and wives, and
Dana Hill, in the important role
of Sherry, acts with an intensity
and an emotional accuracy that
make her a third major player
in the film. In the last few years,
directors seem to have grown
aware of the necessity to
portray children in contem
porary movies as fully fleshed
out human beings and there
fore to cast performers who
can act truthfully rather than
simply mug endearingly in the
style of the Hollywood gamines
of the 19305; hence the emer
gence of Jodie Foster, Kristy
McNichol, Justin Henry and
other gifted young actors.
Dana Hill's performance in
Shoot the Moon illuminates
the complex of responses of a
mature, intelligent, sensitive
child to the dissolution of her
parents' marriage: the impulse
to behave in an adult fashion
for the sake of younger sibl
ings, the irresistible temptation
to play the parent with a now

says, "You go through doors
together — and then some
body gets ahead." "Why don't
they wait for each other?"
Sherry demands. In another
scene, Faith sits in the bathtub
and sings the Beatles' "If I Fell"
absently to herself; suddenly
she realizes how relevant the
silly lyrics are to her own life.
Goldman and Parker have hit
on a brilliant insight here, I
think: at moments of crisis (or
tremendous happiness), our
feelings animate even the
cliches in pop songs and dumb
TV programs. There's another
idea implicit in the scene, too
— the characters in Shoot the
Moon live in a sort of nether

world where no subject is
"safe", no words are trivial.
O'Neill once confessed that
Long Day's Journey into Night
had been written in tears and
blood. I don't know what per
sonal hell Goldman dredged
up in order to be able to write
this film, but there are scenes in
it that brought back every dev
astating argument I ever over
heard, or participated in, as a
child as well as every marital
horror I've witnessed since.
Shoot the Moon may be the
most intense expression of
domestic pain ever conceived
for American movies.



Diane Keaton and Albert Finney, with their children in Shoot the Moon
The most tiresome kind of
criticism leveled at American
actors is that they're always the
same. I've heard this comment
made about the most amazing
performers — Marlon Brando,
Robert DeNiro, Katharine
Hepburn, Jack Nicholson,
Dustin Hoffman — and it
always makes me wonder what
marvels an actor has to perform
in order to be considered ver

satile. Change his voice? Bran
do's done that; compare his
fragmented English in On the
Waterfront with the pre
posterous parody of an
aristocratic British accent in
Mutiny on the Bounty. Change
his body? DeNiro doesn't look
like the same person in Mean
Streets and Raging Bull.
Change his rhythm? Hoffman
accomplishes that within a sin
gle performance: the tense,
hurried executive in the early
scenes of Kramer vs. Kramer
turns into a slower-paced at
tentive parent in the course of
the movie. American actors,
especially American movie ac
tors, rely instinctively so much
more on their personalities
than, say, English actors that
there is an unfortunate ten
dency to see what they do
purely in terms of the personal
traits that distiguish them from
other performers and to ignore
the extreme difficulty of the
roles they may bring off or the
range they demonstrate. The
often-heard line, "Katharine
Hepburn always acts like
herself," ceases to have any
meaning when you consider
that in Long Day's Journey into
Night she displays a greater
emotional range than most
performers show in a lifetime.
And can anyone who thinks
that Jack Nicholson keeps giv
ing the same performance real
ly have watched him in The Last
Detail, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, The Missouri
Breaks and The Border?
Several of my friends com
plained that they just couldn't
believe Diane Keaton as Louise
Bryant in Reds, that all they saw
was the sweet, hazy neurotic of
Annie Hall. If so, the fault does
not lie with Keaton, who hasn't
given that performance in five
years. I suspect that the lack of
attention accorded her work in
Manhattan was largely due to
the fact that since she was
playing opposite Woody Allen
again, she was assumed to be

doing much the same thing she
had done in Annie Hall, when
in fact if the two pictures were
screened back to back we
might be surprised to see how
much stronger, sharper and
(courageously) less sympa
thetic she is in the later film. In
the first half of Reds, she coasts
on the appeal of her person
ality to a certain extent, it's
true, but the shape of the role

doesn't allow her to take it very
far, and in the second part both
Louise and Keaton attain real
maturity. How could anyone
confuse the precision of the si
lent sequence at the train sta
tion where Louise searches for
jack Reed with anything in An
nie Hall? The typing of actors
used to be blamed on studio
publicity, but these days it's
more likely to be the fault of
moviegoers who don't watch
what actors are really doing.
As Faith Dunlap in the new
Shoot the Moon, Diane Keaton
gives the best performance
I've seen from any American
actress in over a decade. It's the
kind of acting that is authentic
in every detail because it seems
to have been dug from the
bowels — like Brando's in Last
Tango in Paris, like Jane Fon
da's in Klute. Faith is the wife of
a prize-winning author,
George (Albert Finney) and the
mother of four girls (Dana Hill,
Viveka Davis, Tracey Gold, Tina

Yothers), and her marriage is
falling apart; when she de
duces that George is sleeping
with another woman (Sandy,
played by Karen Allen), she
packs his bag and throws him
out. Shoot the Moon, which
was written by Bo Goldman
and directed by Alan Parker,
deals with the process of
estrangement between hus
band and wife, parents and
children, with the interior con
flict between love and resent-

ment that separation causes to
surface and that most people
spend their lives trying to re
solve.
Faith is in agony from the
outset of the film: at the book
awards banquet where George
is lauded, she forces herself to
act the role of the supportive
wife though she knows that the
remnants of their marriage are
going to shatter as soon as they
return home. Keaton says
almost nothing in these early
scenes, but her tension in the
car on the way to the dinner,
her pain in the moment im
mediately after George has ac
cepted the honor and dedi
cated it to her, and her face in
the car afterwards, looking old
and scarred as she holds the
award in her lap, articulate
Faith's inner turmoil. Keaton
does something I thought only
Katharine Hepburn in Long
Day's Journey could pull off:
she uses the emotional equip
ment of the character she is
playing to vary her age. It's a
much younger Faith who flirts,
half-terrified, with Frank (Peter
Weller), the workman who has
contracted to build a tennis
court in her backyard, a much
older Faith who lies awkwardly
to her dying father (George
Murdock) about the state of
her marriage. Keaton's line
readings are marvelous, but
she creates Faith with her en
tire body, and she achieves
astonishing feats with it. I can't
ever recall seeing an actress
look blurred and jagged at the
same time before; it's a brilliant
emblem for emotional distress.
No one wins in this movie,
and in terms of the acting that
means that everyone's a win
ner. Albert Finney's per
formance equals Keaton's; af
ter making a career of playing
inaccessible brooders, he final
ly shows the kind of commit
ment to a role that is a little
frightening. There's a great
scene in Last Tango in which

Brando, for no stated reason,
starts to cry; without the as
sistance of a carefully struc
tured context, this must con
stitute the most rigorous de
mand a director can make on
an actor — pure emotion. Fin
ney's performance in Shoot the
Moon starts out with such a
scene — and it grows from
there. George's extramarital
involvement precipitates the
break-up, but he is no more or
less responsible for the dis-

astrous state of the marriage
than Faith, and no better
equipped to deal with the re
verberations of his departure
from the house. Finney shows
us a man who wants his family
to stay the same even though
he is no longer a part of it: he
opposes Faith's building the
tennis court because he abhors
the thought of the physical al
teration of the property he
used to share with her and with
their children — just as he
abhors the thought of Faith's
drinking wine with an old
friend on a date ("You hate
wine," he nags her) or sleeping
with Frank. And the most acute
ache of all for George is the bit
terness his eldest daughter,
Sherry (who must be 13 or so),
harbors against him when he
leaves.
This movie is as much about
parents and children as it is
about husbands and wives, and
Dana Hill, in the important role
of Sherry, acts with an intensity
and an emotional accuracy that
make her a third major player
in the film. In the last few years,
directors seem to have grown
aware of the necessity to
portray children in contem
porary movies as fully fleshed
out human beings and there
fore to cast performers who
can act truthfully rather than
simply mug endearingly in the
style of the Hollywood gamines
of the 19305; hence the emer
gence of Jodie Foster, Kristy
McNichol, Justin Henry and
other gifted young actors.
Dana Hill's performance in
Shoot the Moon illuminates
the complex of responses of a
mature, intelligent, sensitive
child to the dissolution of her
parents' marriage: the impulse
to behave in an adult fashion
for the sake of younger sibl
ings, the irresistible temptation
to play the parent with a now
single mother, the jealousy
over her father's time with an
other woman's child (Sandy
has a little boy), the massive ac
cumulation of blame leveled at
an absent parent — in this case,
of course, George. The conflict
between George and Sherry is
so highlycharged in this movie,
and almost entirely in scenes
that they don't share, because
Sherry wants nothing to do
with her father, or in moments
when their paths cross briefly
— she walks carefully past his
car without speaking to him,
steps into her school bus and
collapses in tears — that when
we finally get an extended con
versation between them, on
the dock outside Sandy's house
at night, it is an epiphany. And
like everything else in this mov
ie, it surpasses our expecta
tions.
The other daughters are sen
sitively portrayed, too; in fact,
the supporting cast is flawless.
George calls Frank "an overage
hippie," and Peter Weller does
give Frank a western '60s cool
that reflects without parody a
segment of the culture of

Marin County, where the mov
ie is laid. Frank is fascinating:
underneath the slightly be
hind-tempo passivity of this
man lies the capacity for vio
lence of a Hell's Angel. Karen
Allen's Sandy is a northern Cal
ifornian type, as well: unfail
ingly sweet and devoted to
George, but with enough self
possession and recognition of
her own needs to tell him, "If
you don't come through, I'll
find somebody else." And in
his single scene, George
Murdock gives Faith's father a
firm identity; it's a splendid
cameo.
The director, Alan Parker,
and the photographer,
Michael Seresin, so animate
the Victorian house where
Faith remains with her daugh
ter that it practically becomes

an additional protagonist, rath
er than just a means of tele
graphing the status of the char
acters, like the house in Or
dinary People. I don't know
how to account for Parker's
direction of this picture; I
thought his three earlier films
— Bugsy Malone, Midnight Ex
press and Fame — were thor
oughly artificial and despicably
manipulative, but I can't think
of more than two or three mo
ments in Shoot the Moon that
aren't graceful, genuine and
deeply moving. His work here
suggests a more agonized
domestic Renoir — like the
Irvin Kershner of Loving and

the non-fantasy sequences in
Up the Sandbox. In fact, in
mood and texture Shoot the
Moon sometimes recalls Lov
ing, a fine — now forgotten —
1970 drama in which George
Segal plays a kind of Saul
Bellow hero, a commercial ar
tist whose marriage and career
are falling apart. Parker sur
passes Kershner, though, in the
proliferation of immensely re
vealing small touches, like the
worried look on the face of one
of the girls as she watches her
mother struggling to get out of
bed in the morning, or the
carefully measured enthusiasm
both Faith and George employ
to get through a several-hours'
stretch of their children's high
spirits. The unfailing truthful
ness of Parker's depiction of
family existence exposes the

essential fraudulence ot a soap
opera like Ordinary People or
even Kramer vs. Kramer. This
movie signals Alan Parker's re
birth.
I wish I knew where Bo Gold
man learned to write this well.
His last script, Me/v/'n and
Howard, was such a wonderful
model of how to write
dialogue, character and milieu
that all screenwriters should be
required to study it; Shoot the
Moon, with its great double
pronged title (it refers ro going
for broke, as in a game of
hearts, as well as to the death of
romance), can lay claim to

being among the best film writ
ing ever done by an American.
Trying to explain to Sherry how
a marriage disintegrates, Faith
says, "You go through doors
together — and then some
body gets ahead." "Why don't
they wait for each other?"
Sherry demands. In another

she realizes how relevant the
silly lyrics are to her own life.
