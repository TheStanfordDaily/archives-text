# Con Funk Shun: they unpopular, they bad

They turned it out, they tore it up, they
got off. In other words, they were "bad"
— as in about as good as one can get.
Using formal English, Con Funk Shun
put on a show to end all shows two weeks
ago at San Carlos' Circle Star Theater.
This soul/funk band deserves much more
attention than it receives. The musicians
are talented, the song writers brilliant,
and their final result is a danceable model
of music. Best of all, Con Funk Shun's live
performance rivals that of a group like
Earth, Wind & Fire.
But still some, well, many, people we
ren't in attendance at their concert.
Perhaps this was the case because Con
Funk Shun, calling the Bay Area "home,"
puts on shows more often here. Or
maybe people decided to pass this one by
on account of Con Funk Shun's opening
band, LTD (Love, Togetherness & Devo
tion). The latter is not only a legitimate,
but a realistic excuse.
LTD played a 45-minute set which was
about as exciting as watching the Circle
Star's stage rotate for three quarters of an
hour. Besides the group's opening and
closing numbers, LTD's performance was
sui generis: Languid, Tiresome & Dread
ful. Their slow songs worked as effec
tively as Dad's bedtime stories. This is no
joke: a guy two seats away actually slept
through the second half of their show.
The audience, now thoroughly bored,
needed a musical upper to finish the
evening on a favorable note; Con Funk
Shun did not fail them. From start to
finish, they didn't let the audience catch
their breath, playing one hit song and
then immediately jumping into another
and another and, . . . you get the idea.
One became tired just watching, or even
listening, for that matter.
Con Funk Shun played a baker's dozen
of songs, nearly half of which were from
their most recent album, Con Funk Shun
7. The group, who is by no means new to
the soul/funk scene, has definitely
changed with the times.
The bassist is up on the latest slapping

and popping techniques and percussion
plays an increasingly important role in
their tunes. Also, the group employs a
vocoder in a few songs from the 1981 LP,
especially "Bad Lady." Furthermore, Con
Funk Shun has a magnificent horn sec
tion, which added definite body to their
songs.
However, the band's best performer
was guitarist Felton Pilate. He is a rare
breed of guitarist, one that should be in
high demand in coming years. Pilate can

Although the band
members are aging, all
systems are go as far as
Con Funk Shun's
future is concerned;
they are showing no
signs of going over the
hill. Now, if only a few
more people would
attend their
concerts...

play both rhythm and lead guitar with
equal excellence, opening up infinite
possibilities for Con Funk Shun's songs.
Perhaps the only flaw in the group's
performance was the lack of solos and
elongated songs. Most of their tunes, be
sides a few cosmetic alterations, were re
hashes of the studio versions. With such
an abundance of individual talent, one
would think Con Funk Shun would want
to display it. But they prefer to work as a
team and exhibit it in a unified fashion.
And by keeping their songs concise, Con
Funk Shun kept the audience on their
toes.
