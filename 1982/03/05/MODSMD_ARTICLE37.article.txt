# No 'Small Change' for Prism

Prism
Small Change
Capitol Records
When I listen to Prism's single "Don't Let
Him Go," I identify with those who used to
be Journey fans. Until their new album,
Small Change, Prism was my favorite un
known band. I half-wanted them to find suc
cess, but I also wanted to keep them as my
secret; it's difficult to feel you've made any
discovery when you come to like, say, the
Rolling Stones. Now that they've hit
Billboard's top 100, I feel cheated, since, as
happened with Journey, they've been dis
mantled of practically all but the logo. Gone
is lead singer Ron Tabak, and spiritually ab
sent are contributions from writers Lindsay
Mitchell and Allan Harlow.
Serving as a eulogy, then, is this brief his
tory. In 1977, a Canadian band called Prism
released their first album on Ariola Records.
Tabak sounded as if he were still recovering
from emphysema (a condition that never left
him) and Rodney Higgs wrote songs about
intergalactic success and "open soul
surgery." The next year they released See
Forever Eyes, and "Flyin' " became a modest
hit. They did songs on cloning, crime sprees,
and pathological distrust, and they seemed
to be establishing their style to be a kind of
kinky rockand roll. In '79theycameoutwith
Armageddon, still one of my favorite al
bums. The title song is their nightmare of
what could come when "Jerry and Linda are
in the White House" (every Californian's
fear). Armageddon went unnoticed, so they
made their big push for success in 1980 by
signing with Capitol Records. With some
more money behind them, Young And Rest
less was slicker and better looking than any
thing they'd done before. Before they went
into the studio, they got rid of Higgs, but
Lindsay Mitchell showed he had some
quirks of his own, writing "The Visitor," a
song about a stranger moving in and ter
rorizing a household. The album didn't do
well, and Capitol lost it's patience with
them. Enter Prism #2.
On Small Change, Prism no longer has any
particular focus. Rather than centering
around any songwriter, they use seven diffe
rent teams of them. Either by their choice or
by Capitol's prodding, they try to be all
things to all people. Many groups do both
faster and slower material, but not in such
divergent styles. I suppose this could have
been a plus for them, but none of their dif
fering types are done well. "Don't Let Him
Know" opens the album, and is probably its
most successful song. The number is a
middle-of-the-road rocker in a Foreigner/

Rush/Journey mold. But they follow it with a
"mellow" number that sounds like Cliff
Richard at his most banal. "Turn Your Radar
On" combines all of the elements that gave
Muzak a bad name: a mellifluous synth
esizer background, a harmonic chorus that
softly repeats the same line over and over to
substitute for a refrain, and no vitality. Then
comes another rocker, then another slow
one, then a rocker, then a slow one, and so
on. I detect a note of commercialism in their
attempt to play both sides of the street.
None of the numbers is particularly experi
mental or thought-provoking. All are in the
absolute center of their style.
In my bias, I found one song that sounds
remotely like "the old Prism" is "Hole In
Paradise," a trait which, perhaps, isn't sur
prising, since it was co-written by Mitchell.
But the man has conformed to the company
he keeps. He doesn't try anything different
or funny here, but just writes a mildly ag
gressive filler.
Small Change's only song that doesn't
center on love wasn't even written by a band
member. Jimmy Rodger's "In the Jailhouse
Now" is certainly the album's most enter
taining song, probably because it has its only
entertaining lyric. I can't dislike a song that
starts, "I had a friend named Ramblin' Bill/

He used to steal, gamble and kill."
As might be expected, I don't care for
Henry Small, Tabak's replacement on lead
vocals. Heck, the guy can sing. Vou can find
that in any band, but a good rasp is rare. His
problem is that he could be in any band;
there's nothing distinctive about him. A little
while ago, Rolling Stone wrote about the
"faceless bands," Styx, Rush, Journey and
Foreigner, saying they didn't have a strong
frontman, an individual style, or even their
pictures on theiralbum covers. Prism carries
this to an extreme. Like Small, the band
doesn't have a style of any kind. They not
only blend into the crowd, they blend into
several crowds. There's nothing about any
of their individual songs that stands out. Like
the others, they're not on their album cover,
although the cover of Small Change is its one
aspect that's particularly well-done. But they
stole that from Norman Rockwell.
In many ways Capitol would have been
better advised to form these people into a
new group than to try to resuscitate Prism
Then they would have an act with an emerg
ing personality, rather than one that's little
more than a group of musicians thrown to
gether in a last-ditch shot at popularity. But
Prism is finally making money, so Capitol
may have found a formula for success.
