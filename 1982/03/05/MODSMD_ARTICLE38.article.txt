# Colonialism returns: Clash in Hong Kong
## 
### Kevin Kelly 
The Clash
Hong Kong
It isn't every dav that the Da v se'uls someone hallway
across the world just to re\iew a punk concert. In fact,
the Daily isn't even vers keen on sending a reporter as
far as Sunnyvale without a s er\ good reason. So it was no
mean feat to get permission to re\ iew the Clash's recent
show in Hong Kong.
Not that I actually told the editors that the concert was
in Hong Kong. CertainK not. The budget-minded tolks
at Daily HQ just can't |ustif\ spending 53000 round-trip
air fare (coach, of just so that I can see a concert.
No siree. So I didn't tell them I was going to Hong Kong.
On my expense sheet I simpl\ put down m\ travel
expenses as $20 and attributed the remaining $2 l *80 to
"toll-booths and pay-toilets.
Waiting in the lobby betore the concert, surrounded
by literally thousands of Chinese punks wearing T-shirts
advertising every American and British musical per
former from the Sex Pistols to Barr\ Manilow . I began to
have second thoughts about the whole thing. After all,
I'm not really what vou would call a big Clash fan. I ow n a
copy of London Calling and while I like it. I can't hon
estly remember listening to it in well over a \ear. I also
bought their most recent effort (and a feeble effort it
was), Sandinista, but I only got halfway through the
second song before I tore it off m\ turntable and tried to
pawn if off on my brother.
To be quite honest, the onK reason I e\ en went to the
concert was to avoid watching the special two-hour

rerun ot The Dukes of Hazzard that was on Hong Kong
TV that night. (Ah, the wonderful way in which the
American image is promoted abroad!)
Once the concert began, though, my doubts subsided
... for a while. The band opened with a very enthusias
tic (i.e. noisy) rendition of "London Calling" and im
mediately had the audience screaming obscenities and
pushing each other around the room. (For the unin
itiated, it should be explained that at a punk concert
these are telltale signs that the crowd is having a "good
time.")
"London Calling'' was the first and last song that I
actually saw the Clash perform. Hoping to get a good
view of the concert, I had — at great personal risk —
worked my way to within a foot of the stage. Bad move.
Immediately after the opening song, the girl standing
right in front ot me lept onto the shoulders of her boy
friend, where she remained for the next two hours. I
hope she had a good view of the show. I couldn't see a
thing. And, unfortunately, the only thing harder than
working your way to the stage before a concert starts is
try ing to work your way away from the stage after it has
started. I was stuck. At one point during the show, a girl
asked it she could climb onto my shoulders. However,
while she was pretty, she was also quite hefty, and so I
refused. My getting a broken back wasn't going to help
either one of us.
Even though I couldn't see the concert, I couldn't help
but hear it. After "London Calling" the Clash went
straight through a line-up of their most popular songs —
everything from "Train in Vain" and"I Fought the Law"
to the more punk-oriented "London's Burning" and
"I'm So Bored With the U.S.A."

The real highlights of the show came when lead singer
Joe Strummer would interrupt a song to otter a public
service announcement such as "stop spitting on me,
I'm trying to sing!" Three times he went as tar as
to tell the rest of the band to stop playing because
people were fighting down in front of the stage. Strum
mer wouldn't let the playing continue until security
guards had removed the misguided youths (not the term
Strummer used) from the concert hall. I was particularly
thankful the third time this happened, because the punk
that Strummer had the guards remove was for some
reason angry at me and was threatening to move my
nose from the center of my face to somewhere in the
vicinity of my left ear.
When Strummer did let the band go back to playing
music, they did so in full force. They played the punk
anthem "Clash City Rockers" and followed it up with
two of their more popular anti-establishment statements
— "The Guns of Brixton" and "Working for the
Clampdown."
At this point, my earlier doubts came back to me with
renewed enthusiasm. In the 45 minutes that had passed
since the beginning of the concert, the band had played
every one of their most popular songs. What was left?
They might as well go home. Apparently, the band was
thinking along the same lines and, yelling "Good night,
Hong Kong," they fled the stage.

But this was not to be the end. After waiting a whole3o
seconds offstage (wouldn't want that applause to die
down), they triumphantly returned for the encore. And
what an encore! In this and their second encore (they
only held out 15 seconds before coming back for that
one), they played a total of not three, not four, but 16
songs! (Of which I think I recognized three.)
Not only was it the longest encore I've ever witnessed,
it was also the worst. And I went to a Ves concert a few
years back, so that's saying a lot.
After the seventh song, I gave up and started counting
the lights. After the ninth song, I started counting the
speakers. After the twelfth song, the audience rushed
the stage (to throw the Clash off, I thought wistfully).
After the fifteenth song, I started counting the people in
the balcony.
Finally, after grand finale #16, Strummer ended the
concert by screaming "Punks are Dead" at the top of his
lungs. At first, I thought he was referring to specific
members of the audience and I looked around for dead
bodies, but didn't see any. Maybe the security guards
had removed them. Or maybe it was just wishful think
ing by Strummer.
Actually, the concert may not have ended there. I
don't know. I left. If I was lucky, maybe I could catch the
end of The Dukes of Hazzard before I had to go to the
airport.

No siree. So I didn't tell them I was going to Hong Kong.
On my expense sheet I simpl\ put down m\ travel
expenses as $20 and attributed the remaining $2 l *80 to

Waiting in the lobby betore the concert, surrounded
by literally thousands of Chinese punks wearing T-shirts
advertising every American and British musical per
former from the Sex Pistols to Barr\ Manilow . I began to
have second thoughts about the whole thing. After all,
I'm not really what vou would call a big Clash fan. I ow n a
copy of London Calling and while I like it. I can't hon
estly remember listening to it in well over a \ear. I also
bought their most recent effort (and a feeble effort it
was), Sandinista, but I only got halfway through the
second song before I tore it off m\ turntable and tried to
pawn if off on my brother.
To be quite honest, the onK reason I e\ en went to the
concert was to avoid watching the special two-hour

rerun ot The Dukes of Hazzard that was on Hong Kong
TV that night. (Ah, the wonderful way in which the
American image is promoted abroad!)
Once the concert began, though, my doubts subsided
... for a while. The band opened with a very enthusias
tic (i.e. noisy) rendition of "London Calling" and im
mediately had the audience screaming obscenities and
pushing each other around the room. (For the unin
itiated, it should be explained that at a punk concert
these are telltale signs that the crowd is having a "good
time.")
"London Calling'' was the first and last song that I
actually saw the Clash perform. Hoping to get a good
view of the concert, I had — at great personal risk —
worked my way to within a foot of the stage. Bad move.
Immediately after the opening song, the girl standing
right in front ot me lept onto the shoulders of her boy
friend, where she remained for the next two hours. I
hope she had a good view of the show. I couldn't see a
thing. And, unfortunately, the only thing harder than
working your way to the stage before a concert starts is
try ing to work your way away from the stage after it has
started. I was stuck. At one point during the show, a girl
asked it she could climb onto my shoulders. However,
while she was pretty, she was also quite hefty, and so I
refused. My getting a broken back wasn't going to help
either one of us.
Even though I couldn't see the concert, I couldn't help
but hear it. After "London Calling" the Clash went
straight through a line-up of their most popular songs —
everything from "Train in Vain" and"I Fought the Law"
to the more punk-oriented "London's Burning" and
"I'm So Bored With the U.S.A."

The real highlights of the show came when lead singer
Joe Strummer would interrupt a song to otter a public
service announcement such as "stop spitting on me,
I'm trying to sing!" Three times he went as tar as
to tell the rest of the band to stop playing because
people were fighting down in front of the stage. Strum
mer wouldn't let the playing continue until security
guards had removed the misguided youths (not the term
Strummer used) from the concert hall. I was particularly
thankful the third time this happened, because the punk
that Strummer had the guards remove was for some
reason angry at me and was threatening to move my
nose from the center of my face to somewhere in the
vicinity of my left ear.
When Strummer did let the band go back to playing
music, they did so in full force. They played the punk
anthem "Clash City Rockers" and followed it up with
two of their more popular anti-establishment statements
— "The Guns of Brixton" and "Working for the
Clampdown."
At this point, my earlier doubts came back to me with
renewed enthusiasm. In the 45 minutes that had passed
since the beginning of the concert, the band had played
every one of their most popular songs. What was left?
They might as well go home. Apparently, the band was
thinking along the same lines and, yelling "Good night,
Hong Kong," they fled the stage.

But this was not to be the end. After waiting a whole3o
seconds offstage (wouldn't want that applause to die
down), they triumphantly returned for the encore. And
what an encore! In this and their second encore (they
only held out 15 seconds before coming back for that
one), they played a total of not three, not four, but 16
songs! (Of which I think I recognized three.)
Not only was it the longest encore I've ever witnessed,
it was also the worst. And I went to a Ves concert a few
years back, so that's saying a lot.
After the seventh song, I gave up and started counting
the lights. After the ninth song, I started counting the
speakers. After the twelfth song, the audience rushed
the stage (to throw the Clash off, I thought wistfully).
After the fifteenth song, I started counting the people in
the balcony.
Finally, after grand finale #16, Strummer ended the
concert by screaming "Punks are Dead" at the top of his
lungs. At first, I thought he was referring to specific
members of the audience and I looked around for dead
bodies, but didn't see any. Maybe the security guards
had removed them. Or maybe it was just wishful think
ing by Strummer.
Actually, the concert may not have ended there. I
don't know. I left. If I was lucky, maybe I could catch the
end of The Dukes of Hazzard before I had to go to the
airport.
