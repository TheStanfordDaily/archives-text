It's a Wonderful Life****
Saturday, Tresidder Large Lounge
The Second World War had
just ended, and mixed in with the
bright hopes for the future was a
lingering doubt about whether
what America had gained in
progress could ever replace the
old ways that had been lost. Frank
Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Wash
ington, It Happened One Night)
directed this masterful com
edy/fantasy/drama. Like the era
that produced it, It's a Wonderful
Life is a fascinating, disturbing
mixture of confidence and re
gret. The happy ending — and it
may be the happiest-feeling end
ing that has ever graced any mov
ie — is delightful because it
comes as the end of a comedy
veiled nightmare. This is Capra's
masterpiece and one of James
Stewart's finest films.
Stewart stars as a very good
man driven to the verge of sui
cide when all his fine plans seem
to be ruined. A messenger from
heaven stops him in his attempt
and then shows him how dif
ferent the lives of his family and
friends would have been had he
not been present.
Plays at midnight.

The French Lieutenant's
Woman ***
Aquarius, Palo Alto
John Fowles' book is a Vic
torian novel with its own built-in
set of twentieth-century notes;
the screenwriter, Harold Pinter,
has tried to approximate it by
adding modern scenes in which
Mike (Jeremy Irons) and Anna
(Meryl Streep) carry on an affair
during the filming of The French
Lieutenant's Woman. The charac
ters in these scenes are un
mistakably Pinter people. The di
rector, Karel Reisz, seems much
more at home in the period
scenes, which are beautifully fin
ished, if a bit chilly. Asheton
Gorton did the meticulous pro
duction design, Carl Davis wrote
a splendid score, and the photog
raphy is the work of the legend
ary Freddie Francis. Almost all of
the acting is excellent, especially
Streep's, Irons', and that of Pa
tience Collier, who plays Streep's
employer, Mrs. Poulteney, as a
Dickens character.

Talk of the Town ★***
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The paranoia of the McCarthy
era was still a decade away when
this very funny, very naive, and
unexpectedly liberal comedy was
"'»de. Cary Grant stars as
Leopold Dilg, a self-styled anar
chist who is accused of commit
ting arson. Jean Arthur, an actress
who made a fine career out of a
sweet face and a quavery voice,
plays the woman who believes
that he's innocent and shelters
him from the police. Director
George Stevens, who would later
lose his touch for comedy in epics
like Giant, is still in fine form
here.
Double-billed through
Wednesday with Mr. Smith Goes
to Washington, which was
directed by Frank Capra and stars
James Stewart.

On Golden Pond *
Park, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who manages to retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie in which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.

Taps *
Old Mill, Mountain View
The first half of this movie
about the takeover of a military
academy by its students to protest
its closing is a Reagan-era saga of
grand old ethics embattled; the
second half is an indictment of
those who accept the code they
are taught without stopping to
question it. The director, Harold
Becker, and the writers shift gears
to manipulate our emotions.
With Timothy Hutton as the cadet
major who leads the move and
George C. Scott, who has never
been worse, as a half-cracked old
general.

Dr. Straneelove
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The greatest comedy ever
made about the end of the world
by nuclear holocaust (it's even
funnier than Panic in the Year
Zero, and that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Sterling
Hayden) and finished by high
government officials, most of
whom are played by Peter Sellers.
We watch mankind's hopes for
survival being sealed off, one by
one; director Stanley Kubrick
wipes out the human race with
manic glee. Dr. Strangelove is a
wonderfully sustained exercise in
misanthropy — the threat of nu
clear war is so frightening that the
only way to deal with it is with de
risive laughter.
Tonight only with Being There.

Absence of Malice
Old Mill, Mountain View
Visually, Sidney Pollock's mov
ie is flat and conventional, and
Kurt Luedtke's script, an indict
ment of irresponsible journalism
and incidious methods of crimi
nal investigation, lacks punch,
too. The story is plausible, but the
filmmakers don't ask us to weigh
the issues: they've already de
cided who's to blame and how
the characters should have be
haved. As the journalist, Sally
Field gives a bland, unnuanced
performance. The movie's only
real substance is Paul Newman's
acting in the role of the man un
fairly implicated in the disap
pearance of a union leader.

Dial M For Murder ★**
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
In 3-D! Alfred Hitchcock
filmed this thriller using the new
process in the '50s, but by the
time it was released the 3-D craze
had abated and Warner Brothers
decided to show it flat. In 1980, a
dedicated film buff persuaded
the studio to dig up the old
negatives, find some glasses, and
release it as Hitchcock filmed it.
As you might expect, the director
uses the gimmick with restraint,
using it for shock value only
twice, once in a famous scene in
volving a pair of scissors and
again in another involving a key.
The rest of the time, he's content
with layering lamps and rows of
bottles in the foreground to give
a rather sinuous sense of depth.
Grace Kelly and Ray Milland
star. Kelly plays the not-so-inno
cent wife (who's having an affair
with Robert Cummings). Milland
plays the husband who realizes
that his wife's affections — and
fortune — may be turning
elsewhere, and who also realizes
that a well-planned murder
might be the perfect solution.
Filmed in under a month and
adhering very closely to the stage
play, this is by no means one of
Hitchcock's more ambitious ef
forts. But the play, by Frederick
Knott, is very clever, the per
formances (especially by John
Williams, who plays the Scotland
Yard Inspector in charge of the
case) enjoyable, and the direc
tion amazingly fluid in what is es
sentially a one-set movie. Filmed
in the unstable Warnercolor, so
the colors have drifted toward
the pinks and yellows.

Reds ★★★Vi
Palo Alto Square
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
markably coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could siand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than it is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapletorj as Emma Goldman.
— S.V.
The Sting ★
Fox, Redwood City
When Paul Newman and Rob
ert Redford first teamed, in Butch
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,
they didn't exactly create fire
works — except at the box office,
so four years later they repeated
their buddy-buddy schtick in this
slick, visually claustrophobic
Academy Award winner,
directed by George Roy Hill. The
gimmicky script is by David S.
Ward and the photography is by
Seal—a—Meal.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
The French Connection.

Raiders of the Lost Ark **
Mountain View Theater
Raiders is a tribute to the ad
venture serials of the '30s and '40s
(it's set in 1936) as well as the TV
serials and comics of the '50s. It
represents the combined efforts
of some of the most gifted
craftsmen in Hollywood: Steven
Spielberg (Jaws) directed;
George Lucas (Star Wars) and
Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the
Body Snatchers) wrote the script.
It has been acclaimed by the ov
erwhelming majority of critics as
a cliff-hanger classic. But I must
confess to a traitorous resistance
to all those good vibrations: I
didn't care for the movie very
much. Raiders achieves a weird
balance: it's exciting on the sur
face but dull at its center. For all
the hype about its adolescent
boys' tale spirit, I could discern
none of it. Raiders was made in an
acquisitive spirit; it's a
tradesman's movie.
— S.V. I
Time Bandits ★** 1 /2
Mountain View Theater
The Monty Python people
bring you something completely
different: a funny, by turns
charming and cynical fantasy
about a boy who inadvertently
gets caught up with the exploits
of six dwarfs who're out to
plunder the greatest treasures of
all time.The camera seldom raises
higher than about four-foot-one,
and maybe the air is richer down
there — this movie is faster and
more clever than any of the re
cent American fantasies popu
lated entirely by six-footers.
Double-billed with Raiders of
the Lost Ark.

Airplane **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
From most of the people who
brought you Kentucky Fried
Movie comes this disappointing
and largely unfunny parody of
disaster films. There are about a
million and a half jokes in this
one; unfortunately, only about
eight or nine of them are funny.
Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul-
Jabaar and a host of non-comedi
ans are the non-stars.
Tomorrow night, with Stripes.
— Peter Finch
Casablanca *★★★
Fox, Redwood City
The movie that's represented
romance for two generations of
moviegoers. As Rick and llsa,
Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman are one of the screen's
perfect couples: this was a match
made in movie heaven. Michael
Curtiz, a Warner Brothers con
tract director, was handed a rou
tine (and unfinished) script and
all the actors the studio had to of
fer. The result is a lot more than
routine — in its enduring appeal,
Casablanca has made movie his
tory.
Also featured are Dooley
Wilson, Claude Rains, Peter
Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and
many others. Plays Tuesday and
Wednesday with Wings.
