Stockman: recession is part of the cure
Washington â€” High interest rates, unemployment, rising ban
kruptcies and record-high deficits are "all part of the cure not the
problem" with the ailing economy, budget director David Stockman
said yesterday.
Stockman, delivering a self-described pep talk before the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, said the bad economic news in
recent weeks was basically a by-product of the rapid decline in the
inflation rate.
Therefore, he said, the nation has no choice but to continue with
President Ronald Reagan's basic tax and budget policies despite a
deeper and more prolonged recession than was expected a few months
ago.
Stockman's breakfast talk to business officials has the most candid
acknowledgement yet that he viewed the recession, near-record in
terest rates and bankruptcies as necessary evils that will help "end the
curse of inflation once and for all."
His comments came after The Business Roundtable, a group of < hiel
executives of the nation's biggest corporations, issued a statement
saying that Reagan's proposed defic its are too large. Sour< es said tin*
Roundtable also has urged the president to support a delay in the Hi
percent income tax < ut scheduled to take effed July I, I'Wi.
