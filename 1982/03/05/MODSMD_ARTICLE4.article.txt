Stockman: recession is part of the cure
Washington — High interest rates, unemployment, rising ban
kruptcies and record-high deficits are "all part of the cure not the
problem" with the ailing economy, budget director David Stockman
said yesterday.
Stockman, delivering a self-described pep talk before the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, said the bad economic news in
recent weeks was basically a by-product of the rapid decline in the
inflation rate.
Therefore, he said, the nation has no choice but to continue with
President Ronald Reagan's basic tax and budget policies despite a
deeper and more prolonged recession than was expected a few months
ago.
Stockman's breakfast talk to business officials has the most candid
acknowledgement yet that he viewed the recession, near-record in
terest rates and bankruptcies as necessary evils that will help "end the
curse of inflation once and for all."
His comments came after The Business Roundtable, a group of < hiel
executives of the nation's biggest corporations, issued a statement
saying that Reagan's proposed defic its are too large. Sour< es said tin*
Roundtable also has urged the president to support a delay in the Hi
percent income tax < ut scheduled to take effed July I, I'Wi.
The Roundtable, which strongly backed Reagan's
economic program last year, also called tor slowing
the defense buildup and tor major reductions in fed
eral programs with cost-of-living adjustments.
Stockman acknowledged that the recession was
deeper and more prolonged than the administration
had expected last fall, but he predicted a "permanent
recovery" later in 1982.
Stockman said the rapid tall in the rate ot inflation
— widely attributed to the Federal Reserve's tight
money policy — was more rapid than the administra
tion or the central bank anticipated or even intended.
Committees balk at budget cuts
Washington — A House health subcommittee yes
terday balked at the $3 billion in cuts that President
Ronald Reagan has proposed for Medicare next fiscal
year. Its voice vote was one of several indications that
committees that supported Reagan's spending cuts
last year will resist them this second time around.
The committees are balking at the specific cuts
even as many of their members are deploring the
budget deficits the president has projected.
Last year the congressional committees were cir
cumvented largely as Reagan's spending proposals
were wrapped together in a single bill. It is not clear
whether this will happen again this year.
The health subcommittee vote came on a report to
be made to the House Budget Committee, which is
trying to figure out what the various legislative com
mittees of the House are likely to do this year. The
Budget Committee wants guidance for the prepara
tion of Congress' first budget resolution for fiscal 1983
this spring.
In other recent expressions of intent affecting ma
jor benefit and other programs the president wants to
cut:
— The House public assistance subcommittee de
clined in a unamimous vote Tuesday to commit itself
to the $2.7 billion in cuts Reagan wants in Aid to Fami
lies with Dependent Children, other welfare pro
grams, unemployment insurance, low-income
energy assistance and assorted social service pro

grams. Instead, it said the Budget Committee should
count for now on all these programs going forward
without cuts.
— The House Agriculture Committee, which last
year cut the food-stamp program part of the way the
president wanted, on Wednesday advised the Budget
Committee that it did not know what cuts, if any, it
would adopt among the $2.3 billion recommended by
Reagan.
— Democrats on the House housing subcommit
tee, at a Wednesday caucus, voted to fund about
200,000 added units of low-income housing under
special new rules, unanimously rejecting Reagan's
proposal that no new units be funded. The full com
mittee is expected to follow suit.
— Both the Senate Labor and Human Resources
and House Education and Labor committees are ex
pected to resist new Reagan retrenchment proposals
for education and other programs under their juris
diction.
TVA to halt 3 nuclear projects
Washington — The Tennessee Valley Authority an
nounced yesterday that it will halt construction ot
three nuclear power plants on which it has spent $2. 1
billion, a move that will lay off 4800 workers in Ten
nessee and Alabama, where unemployment is above
the national average.
"We simply don't need all the plants we have under
construction, we have to put these plants in
mothballs," S. David Freeman, a TVA director, said in
a telephone interview. "Our electrical load forecast is
way down at the same time that the costs of construc
tion have escalated at an unbelievable rate." Freeman
is one of the two, out of three, directors who voted to
defer construction.
Construction will be halted on two reactors at
Hartsville, Tenn. lust north of Nashville, and on one
reactor at Yellow Creek, in the northeast corner of
Mississippi. One of the Hartsville reactors was 40
percent complete and the other was 30 percent com
plete, as was the Yellow Creek reactor.
About 2800 workers will be laid off in Tennessee,
where unemployment is at 12 percent. Deferral of

Yellow Creek will lay off 2000 workers, most of whom
are from the Muscle Shoals region of Alabama, where
unemployment is over 19 percent.
The three reactors would have generated almost
four million kilowatts ot electricity, and would have
cost $ 10.3 billion. They make a total of eight nuclear
power units to be deferred by the TVA in the last three
years. The TVA has four reactors operating and is
completing five more.
Freeman said that construction costs of the three
plants were rising so rapidly that their electricity
would have cost 13 cents a kilowatt hour when they
began producing power after their scheduled com
pletion in 1990 and 1991. This is more than three times
the TVA's wholesale charge for electricity today.
"We >till have five nuclear units under construction
that are further along than these three and will pro
duce much cheaper electricity," Freeman said,
"We're stopping our three most expensive nuclear
plants, those suffering the most from the inflation
rate and those that must be back-fitted with most of
the engineering changes mandated by the accident at
Three Mile Island."
Joint Chiefs head nominated
Washington — President Ronald Reagan an
nounced yesterday that he will nominate Army Gen.
John Vessey, a 59-year-old former mud soldier, to be
come chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, effective
July 1.
Assuming Senate confirmation, Vessey will succeed
Air Force Gen. David Jones, who was known in mili
tary circles more as a politically adept manager than as
a down-to-earth soldier.
Vessey, according to the Army, would become the
first Army general to become chairman of the Joint
Chiefs, the nation's top military post, without having
graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West
Point.
His selection also is unusual in that he would jump
from his current job as Army vice chief of staff to the
chairmanship without first becoming the chief of staff
of his service.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs runs the meetings

of the heads of the Army, Air Force, Ntovy and Marine
Corps and sets forth their positions in meetings with
the president. He is the president's military adviser on
the main issues of the day.
A White House official said that Reagan did not
know Vessey but directed his staff to find a man "of
absolute integrity who would be cool under fire."
Reagan was particularly impressed, the official said,
with the fact that Vessey was a former enlisted man
who received a battlefield commission on the Anzio
beachhead during World War 11.
