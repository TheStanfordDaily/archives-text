Happy Hour
The last happy hour of the quarter will take place in
the friendly offices of the Daily at 4:30 p.m. today.
Paychecks still available
Informing the public and preserving the people's
right to know are just some of the lofty ideals motivat
ing Daily staffers. For everyone else, paychecks are
still available. By the way, if you think you should re
ceive a paycheck and haven't received one its proba
bly because you haven't filled out the correct forms.

Fee assessment petitions
All staffers are reminded to turn in those filled out
fee assessment petitions to the Daily offices-
Correction
Yesterday's article on Storey House mistakenly at
tributed a quote concerning a natural division be
tween the East Asian Studies theme house organizing
committee and other non-committee house resi
dents to Joan Hotelling, a member of the organizing
committee. The quote should have been attributed to
Salli Tazuke, the Storey House resident advisor.
