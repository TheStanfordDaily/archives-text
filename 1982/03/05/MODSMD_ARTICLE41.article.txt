# Residential Education tries to promote social awareness

In its effort to "prorYiote all kinds of ac
tivities that are educational in the broad
sense," the Office of Residential Education
sponsors and cosponsors a wide variety of
programs on campus, according to Alice
Supton, assistant dean for residential educa
tion. She said Res Ed is concerned that life in
the residences consist of "more than eating
and sleeping.''
One example of these programs is the cur
rent Race Awareness Week, sponsored sol
ely by Res Ed, which includes speakers and
programs designed to heighten students'
understanding of race-re I a ted issues.
Another example is the recent workshop en
titled "How to Encourage and Support
Feminism in the Residences," sponsored by
Res Ed and the Women's Center.
Supton said she is proud to associate Re
sidential Education with feminism in the re
sidences. "There is still anti-feminist senti
ment in our world and in the residences. I'm
concerned about all kinds of aspects of the
quality of life here. I want women to feel
comfortable expressing their views, disag
reeing, assuming leadership positions. .
The residences, she said, should be a safe
environment in which to explore the whole
set of issues dealing with men and women
and their relationship to each other. Supton
said that although the Women's Center is
sometimes perceived as a stereotyped point
of view, it actually caters to a wide variety of

opinions.
She >aid many women "completely disas
sociate themselves from the term
(feminism), but associate themselves with
the concept." Feminism has to do with
women being given equal opportunities,
she said, to show that they are equally as
strong, as powerful and as influential as
men. Supton added, "we're encouraging
men and women to examine their attitudes
... to explore a little bit . . . if the total
woman point of view is not being rep
resented," she said, then Res Ed would try to
support discussion of that viewpoint.
Norm Robinson, associate dean for resi
dential education, said the office believes in
pooling resources in order to promote dis
cussion. He said that simply because Res Ed
sponsors a program does not necessarily
mean it advocates the issue or issues pre
sented. "What we're advocating is learning
to respect individuals for what they are," he
said. He said Res Ed would cosponsor a
program with any recognized campus or
ganization that would lead to an open dis
cussion of ideas. Res Ed is working to clarify
expectations so that Resident Assistants
(RAs) "will have a sense of their role as
educator," he said.
Supton said that in the last few years the
level of intellectual activity in the residences
has been "amazingly high." Several RAs ag
reed that while Res Ed can be used as a valu
able resource, it is up to RAs to provide the

core of activity in their particular dorm. For
example, at Branner Hall, home of the '60s
Week and the Edward Teller-Sidney Drell
debate, "there is a certain amount ot feisti
ness," according to RA Leo Cunningham.
"We are very autonomous from Res Fdhe
said. Res Ed is "biased in a positive way" and
does have "a progressive bent in that it is
opposed to closed-mindedness," he said.
Cunningham said he doesn't think Res Ed
imposes its views or restrictions on stu
dents. He cited the nuclear disarmament is
sue, saying that Res Ed didn't tell dorms what
to think but suggested discussing the topic.
"We could have posted a banner saying,
Nuke' 'em till they glow,' " he said.
Tim Duane, an RA in Florence Moore, said
he felt Res Ed is only biased in its selection of
topics. "People are going to gain a lot more
through seeing both sides," he said, "but
often the people who want programs are
from a liberal perspective and the other side
is not demanding to be heard."
Duane said his experience has been that
there is little demand for anything from stu
dents, and that Res Ed can't know dissatisfac
tion if the other side isn't showing up to
voice its concerns. He said that in Flo Mo the
RAs have a great deal of independence and
responsibility, but that there is a lot of am
biguity concerning the nature of the Resi
dent Fellows' <RFs) roles and that Res Ed, as
"the RF's RA," should develop more
clearly-defined ideas about the role of the

RF.
Kennell lackson, associate professor of
history and the RF in Branner, presented the
flip side of Duane's view by saying that the
tasks for RAs need to be identified and more
clearly defined. He said that while RAs
should be more highly trained and more
specialized they should also be allowed in
dependence once they assume their posi
tions. He said he felt the level of intellectual
activity in dorms should be made uniform,
but added that "that does not mean
homogenized."
Jackson expressed concern, however,
over the function of Res Ed as "the arm of
campus organizations." Hesaid although he
supports the women's movement and the
Feminist Studies program here — "I see
them as really new disciplinary departures"
— he fears that "feminism is associated with
some of the more radical causes by some
people." He said he feels that most students
do not see it as Res Ed does, that is, as a
complex and far-reaching set of issues and
attitudes. The broad definition of feminism
"isn't coming down to this end (the stu
dents). You want to stimulate ideas, and if
you seem to be biased you've got a prob
lem."
Jackson is currently chairing a committee
which is investigating the ways the Univer
sity can improve the intellectual caliber of
the residences. This subcommittee of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies in

eludes both faculty and students and is con
centrating primarily on the analysis of
freshman and sophomore years, tht* roles of
RAs and RFs, the structure of residential
education and the extension of residential
education intoareas where therecurrentlyis
none.
Jackson said the committee will issue a
report this spring which will include re
commendations for moderate changes. "If
you've got a very good system, you'd like to
make it better," he said.
According to Robert Hamrdla, assistant to
the president and a member of the sub
committee, this is the first time a separate
committee has been established to assess
the goals of Res Ed. Hamrdla said that the
committee was not formed because of a par
ticular problem but rather out of a to
establish "a permanent home" for this kind
of evaluation.
He said he felt Res Ed presented a broad
spectrum of programs and issues, "if we had
to make sure everyone felt comfortable with
every program, we'd have a bland diet. Part
of being at Stanford is being uncomfortable
with issues.
"While I don't think the University goes
out specifically to disturb students, I don't
think it is improper for Res Ed to sponsor a
particular program, with one assumption:
that someone who wanted to put on a prog
ram taking the opposite view could do so."
