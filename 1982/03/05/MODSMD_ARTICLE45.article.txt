When your're 11 years old
and your brother and his
friends have started a new
sport, naturally you want to
join in the fun. But what if the
sport is judo?
"My mother said it wasn't la
dylike," junior Robin LeCount
recalled, "but my father and I
talked to her, and now both my
parents are really happy that I
compete."
Indeed, her parents can be
proud. Since that disagree
ment some nine years ago, Le-
Count has developed into one
of the top three women judo
competitors in the country.
A contender in the 114 lb.
class, LeCount has won numer
oustitlesand honors, including
a third place award at the Na
tional Sports Festival last sum
mer. She also took second at
the Canadian Cup in 1981.
LeCount is also one of two
women who compete for the
Stanford judo club under the
direction of head coach Willie
Cahil, LeCount said she be
lieves thatCahil, who took the
United State's men's judo team
to world competition, is proba
bly the best coach in the coun
try. Under his instruction, she
placed second in the Col
legiate Nationals last year.
LeCount works out year
round, although the competi
tion schedule is heaviest dur
ing the spring and summer
months. She trains three times
a week in the afternoons here
with the judo club. On
Tuesdays and Thursdays she
travels north to work out with a

judo club in San Bruno.
LeCount supplements these
sessions with running, jumping
rope and weight lifting to in
crease her strength and en
durance.
She maintains, however, that
size and strength are not the
principle talents needed to win
judo competitions.
"I think coordination is
probably vital to competing
successfully," she stated. "You
have to think. When an oppo
nent pushes, you have to pull.
Movement is important."
LeCount explained that judo
asa sport is actually verysimilar
to wrestling. As in wrestling,
opponents attempt throws,
pins, and chokes.
"It's not for self-defense like
karate or some of the other
martial arts," she emphasized.
"The technique is much
smoother. In fact, judo actually
means 'gentle way'."
Although judo is not used for
protection in case of attack, Le-
Count said she believes in its
practical value.
"Judo has given me a lot of
self-confidence. If I were ever
in danger, I know that I would
never freeze up. I wouldn't be
dumb, but I wouldn't panic
either," she said.
When LeCount began partic
ipating in the sport, she was
only 11. She began competing
at age 12, and she took second
place at her first Junior Na
tional appearance in 1974. She
went on to earn her black belt
when she was 15.

LeCount plans to paricipate
in the 1982 Collegiate Nationals
at the UC-Berkeley, on March
27-28. She said that she believes
that Stanford's most de
termined competition will
come from Peninsula rival San
Jose State.
She will then stop out next
quarter to travel to Colorado
Springs, Colo, to train at the
Olympic Training Center
camp. Forty atheletes were
chosen to attend this spring
camp.
LeCount, who is rated third
in the nation, said she hopes
that the training she receives
will enable her to earn a berth
on the world team this sum
mer. She will compete at the
senior nationals in April and
the National Sports Festival in
July to acquire the necessary
points to win the title in her
division.
LeCount seemed optimistic
about her chances for winning
a slot on the U.S. squad. "Last
month I beat the girl who is
currently ranked first in my
division, so I hope that I can do
it again."
Whether she wins or loses,
LeCount will no doubt con
tinue to compete in the sport
she loves.
"I'll always enjoy judo be
cause it is a sport which doesn't
get boring. You can always
learn a new technique, and you
can participate when your're a
little kid until you're 60," she
said. "Judo is really just a way of
life for me."
