# Not all glory
## Injury — the athlete's enemy 
### Casey Raftery 
Pain flickers across the face
of the athlete as the electric
current from the galvanic stem
machine grips her muscle,
causing it to contract. Seconds
later, she is smiling again, for
the unit directional flow of
electricity has temporarily
stopped.
Nearby lies another athlete,
calmly reading while a trainer
applies ultra-sound to his gel
covered shoulder. Occasion
ally he flinches when the vibra
tions from the 850,000 to
1,000,000 cycles of sound per
second are applied near bone
where there is little soft tissue
coverage.
Alone in the midst of many, a
third athlete lies immobile, her
neck and back covered by
packs of hot sand.
Different as their treatments
may sound, these three ath
letes share one thing in com
mon: they are injured. They
are experiencing neither glory
nor success, but pain and frus
tration — the other side of ath
letics.
Sophomore catcher Lyle
Smith tore ligaments in his
ankle sliding into second base
this past fall. He still comes to
the athletic training room ev
ery day for treatment. Smith
talked openly about some of
the emotions an athlete feels
after an injury.
"At first I was feeling why
me, why now? Why did I have
to be injured in the fall, when
everyone is fighting for a posi
tion? After the surgery, I got my
head together and begin to set
some goals like getting the cast
off, then running," he said.
Commenting on some of the
fears of an injured athlete,
Smith said "my main fear was
that I would not be able to
come back all the way." Like
most athletes, Smith realized

that he "probably wouldn't
make it through college athlet
ics without getting hurt," but
had always hoped that it would
not be him.
After his surgery, Smith was
unable to practice for more
than two months. A non-ath
lete would assume Smith felt
relief at having the extra time
for academics, but Smith dis
agreed. "The coach kept tell
ing me that with all this extra
time I should do really well in
school, but my grades were the
worst ever. Being injured
throws your whole rhythm and
schedule off. I tried to work in
the afternoons, but I kept
thinking I was supposed to be
at practice. I was disassociated
and didn't get much done. All
in all it was a pretty negative ex
perience."
Sophomore hurdler Susan
Burrus shares Smith's opinion
about injury, though her ex
perience is quite different from
his. Burrus tore an upper
hamstring her senior year in
high school and has been
plagued by injury since.
Emotionally, Burrus' injury
added to the trauma of her
freshman year. "When I was a
freshman, being injured just
made everything harder. I had
run for so long that not being
able to run just compounded
my problems,"she said.
Burrus also said that her in
jury added to the feelings of
isolation and loneliness most
freshmen feel. "I didn't know
people in my dorm at first be
cause I wasat practice a lot, and
I wasn't able to get to know the
team because I couldn't train
with anyone."
Asked whether her injury
bothered other aspects of her
life, Burrus replied "I'm aware
of it, but I'm used to it."
"It has been almost two years
now," she said. "I know it's

there but it's just part of my life,
though I'm not happy about it.
When I'm walking to class and
it hurts I acknowledge it, but I
don't dwell on it."
One of the hardest things for
Burrus is her friends' misun
derstanding of her injury.
"They don't understand that I
still have to put in three or four
hours a day even while in
jured," she said. "They also
don't understand why I still
keep running track. I try to ex
plain that I have a commitment
to the team, and that I still en
joy track, but the real reason
doesn't come across. In the
back of my mind I know there
is still a possibility that I might
be able to run as I once did."
As part of the healing proc
ess, both Burrus and Smith
come to the training room ev
ery day for treatment. "You
would rather not come to the
training room because you
would rather not be injured,"
said Burrus, "but once here,
everyone is really friendly and
encouraging."
Smith said that "being in
jured is a very individual
thing," though he does feel
"some comeradery" in the
training room.
According to head trainer
Standley Scott, the training
room staff tries to keep a busi
ness-like atmosphere in the
training room. "This might
make the atmosphere sterile,"
said Scott, "but we must ac
knowledge that this is a treat
ment center."
Scott said the trainers like to
see injured athletes talking to
each other. "We think it helps
their mental attitudes. We try
to keep order, but if we got
very hard-nosed about it the
training room could become a
very sterile place with the kind
of down-in-the-mouth health
care that we don't want to see."
Scott said he senses that the
predominate mood of the
training room is hopeful.
"Some people are very
motivated in rehabilitation,
and some people are de
pressed, but I don't think there
is a dominant mood of depres
sion," he said, "though we do
have our somber moments."
