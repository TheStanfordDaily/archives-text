# Racquet club to rebuild squad
## 
### Steve Trousdale 
Although largely un
recognized as a sport here, the
racquetball club contains a
core of dedicated people who
play for the fun of it. The club
battles teams such as UC-Davis,
Cal, San Francisco State, UC-
Santa Cruz, and San Jose State,
explained Miguel Cortes, a stu
dent who runs the racquetball
club and coordinates activities
for the uncoached racquetball
team.
According to Yvonne Lanza,
Cortes' female counterpart,
the club and team differ in sev
eral aspects. Most of the mon
ey set aside for racquetball as a
club sport goes to the team,
which consists of six men, four
women, and one alternate of
each sex. Anyone can join the
club, but a player must show a
certain level of proficiency to
make the team.
There are some problems
with this split, said Lanza, "We
have trouble with the club, be
cause we don't know what to
offer people in the way of more
court hours and other privi
leges.".This trouble arises pri
marily from the lack of facilities
here, she said.
The club and the team have
two major goals in the upcom
ing years. The first is to oversee
the construction of four to
eight more courts. The second
goal is toacquire more funding

in order to hire a racquetball
coach.
The team's season started
winter quarter and will extend
into spring quarter, Cortes
said. Stanford currently has
one win and three losses in a
scl v_dule that holds six more
matches. Lanza said that she
believes that this season will be
a rebuilding year for the team,
especially for the women.
The team will hold a racquet
ball tournament in the spring,
and will try to earn money for
traveling and other expenses
through a fee assessment
spring quarter. With this mon
ey, the men's team.would like
to send some players to the
NCAA finals in Memphis,
Tenn.
Cortes, who is ranked
number two on the team, said
that the number one player,
Jeff Shapiro, would be unable
to go to the NCAA's because
he is not an undergraduate.
Lanza is the number one
ranked female.
Although Cortes said that he
had no desire to place the team
on the varsity level because of
lack of support, Lanza said she
feels that there would be many
advantages to such a move, pri
marily involving funding. How
ever, she said that better facil
ities would have to be built
before such a move could be
contemplated.
