# Group fighting to bring back equestrian tradition

### Joan O'Connell 
The iron statue amid the
gnarled oak trees on the
grounds of the Stanford stables
surveys the paddocks with a
weathered pride. A 55-year
old tribute to Sherwood — the
famous trotting sire of Gov.
Leland Stanford — the life
sized replica is a subtle re
minder of the days when
horses really did have the right
of way on the Stanford farm.
The once acclaimed horses
and horse people here have
not stood the years as well as
the statue, however. A glance
over to the imposing red barn
reveals the decline of the facil
ity: the buildings are sadly in
need of a coat of paint, the
roofs leak and chickens and
dogs muck around rusty farm
equipment and piles of
lumber.
What was once an
"equestrian showplace," ac
cording to Richard Cassin, a
graduate student in biology
and a boarder at the stables, is
now "in shambles."
Indeed disatisfaction among
the horsey set has been buidl
ing. Disgruntled students
trudge away from the grounds
at the beginning of each quar
ter, as the five riding classes

taught per week fill up quickly
and don't nearly meet the de
mand for riding opportunities.
Experiened riders complain
that the program allows those
who simply sign up in time to
progress in as few as five quar
ters from beginner to ad
vanced jumping status, placing
experienced riders with rela
tive novices in the last course of
the sequence.
One boarder even said that
she has trouble keeping weight
on her horse, despite the
$165-200 per month boarding
cost which is supposed to in
clude a full feeding program.
"The oat hay here is like
straw. And the roof leaks in the
barn so it gets moldy," she
noted.
Because of these and other
problems associated with the
stables — currently run by Lois
Melville who, with her hus
band jack, leased the facility
from the University 16 years
ago — a group of riders have
organized the Stanford
Equestrian Association, a club
they hope to turn into a non
profit foundation which can
undertake the task of renovat
ing the facilities and building
an equestrian education pro
gram.

One of the club's main goals
is to institute a major horse
show every year, said Cassin,
the new groups president.
They hope to put one together
for this spring. However,
Melville said she sees little
feasibility in the new group's
ambitious planning.
"Where are they going to get
the time? With tuition what it

is, students have too much stu
dying to do (to run the
stables)," Melville said. "And
who are they going to compete
with? The closest group is the
Davis Polo Club."
Melville estimated that the
barn can likely keep operating
as it is now for another 20 years.
Renovating it, she said, would
likely cost three quarters of a
million dollars. "They don't

build barns like this anymore.
Why, just to put a new roof on
would cost about $40,000."
Despite the obstacles, Cassin
says his group is optimistic that
both alumni and the University
will rally to help restore and
restructure the riding program
here and the barn itself which
is "almost a landmark," at Stan
ford.
