# Rugby tackles Cal Saturday for scrum axe
## 
### Jack Clark 
To many people, rugby is just
another game of soccer, only
rougher. To the 60 Stanford
men who practice the sport
three times a week, it is a game
of fatique, bruises, black eyes,
and bloody noses. For these

men rugby is not only a sport,
but a way of life.
Rugby can best be described
as a cross between soccer and
football. In fact, American
football developed out of
rugby. The game consists of
two4s-minute halvesanda five

minute halftime. Each team
competes with a squad of 15
players.
A "try" oc touchdown is
worth four points and is scored
when a player carries the ball
into the opposing teams end
zone and touches it to the

ground.
To a new observer, the sport
looks more or less like or
ganized mayhem without any
rules, due to the fact that there
are few rules limiting physical
contact. Because of the lack of
rules, the sport has been

named "the gentlemen's
game." If the players are not
gentlemen, rugby becomes
more of a battle than a game, as
many team members know.
"Sure it is tough, but that is
what makes the game so excit
ing to play and watch," said
club President Peter Frost.
Stanford rugby is a sport rich
with tradition, and this year's
squad is striving to continue
that tradition. Rugby was a
varsity sport here until 1974,
when it became a club sport.
During the years of varsity sta
tus, the rugby team won a total
of nine championships.
This year's team, which
sports a record of 6-0, thinks it
has a good chance to bring an
other national championship
back to the farm.
Head Coach Tom O'Grady
said that although the squad
has suffered some injuries,
they should have enough
depth to continue to win
games.
Stanford's attack has been
led by fullback David Andrews
(87 points), inside center Frank
Hicks (44 points), and wing Ned
Fleming (36 points). Seniors
Rich Bridgford and Jon Zirn, as
well as freshman Tom Briehl,
have anchored the defense
with bone-crushing tackling.
"If our scrum continues to
improve and our backs con
tinue to play tough defense, we
should do well in national play
offs."
