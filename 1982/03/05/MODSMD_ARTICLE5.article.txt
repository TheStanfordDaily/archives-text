# Budget raises graduate funds
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The proposed University operat
ing budget for 1982-83 includes
$908,000 in increases in graduate fi
nancial aid, part of which will be used
to create 100 new first-year fellow
ships.
University administrators yester
day "went public" with the proposed
budget of $208 million, presenting it
to both the Faculty Senate and stu
dents at a budget briefing. The board
of trustees is scheduled to vote
Tuesday on the proposal, which
would represent a total increase of
14.5 percent over this year's operat
ing budget.
The graduate financial aid in
creases includes464,ooofora normal
increase on fellowship stipends,
$69,000 for a special increase to bring
those stipends closer to the policy
level of 70 percent of student costs
and $375,000 to add 100 first year
graduate fellowships, primarily in
the sciences.
The proposed budget includes an
average 10.5 percent increase in fa
culty salaries. Non-exempt staff
(salaried staff paid by the hour) will
receive a minimum increase of 10
percent and within that group step
increments will afford most
nonexempt staff greater increases.
Merit increases for exempt staff (who
receive a fixed yearly salary) will
range from zero to 14 percent.
Among the proposed increases,
which will become part of the budget
base and therefore permanent in
creases, are:
— $20,000 for undergraduate teach
ing equipment inthe sciences;
— $65,000 to the provost as the
fourth of five increments to bring the
Western Culture budget to the ag
reed upon level;

— $962,000 to the School of En
gineering to reduce faculty salary
offsets from 25 percent to 10 percent
(engineering faculty are currently
required to finance 25 percent of
their own salary by soliciting re
search grants);
— $430,000 to the University, Hoover
and Law libraries to maintain their
purchasing power and to increase ef
forts in materials conservation; and
— $20,000 to the Department of Ath
letics, Physical Education and Recre
ation to increase supervision at
Roble and Encina gyms during even
ing and weekend hours.
Timothy Warner, assistant provost
for the Office of Management and
Budget, said this will be the Universi
ty's sixth consecutive balanced
operating budget.
Warner explained that the primary
emphasis in formulating the budget
for next year was placed on financial
aid and facilities maintenance.
Stanford remains committed to
aid-blind admissions for under
graduates, he said, and that will
necessitate a 31 percent increase in
undergraduate financial aid next
year.
Guaranteed Student Loans are
under particular attack in the execu
tive branch, Warner said, and the
University has a task force examining
the situation. "We have a good
handle on it (the loan situation), ex
cept lor the uncertainty of loans for
1982-83," he said.
Larry Owen, management as
sociate in the Management and Fi
nancial Planning Office, explained
the need for increased attention to
physical plant maintenance. Stan
ford's plant is relatively new, with 72
