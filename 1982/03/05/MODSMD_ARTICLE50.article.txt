# Walker waddles waiting for athletic recognition

Although she doesn't carry
any excess weight on her slight
5' 9" frame, freshman Juliann
Perrigo waddles when she
walks. Perrigo is a national race
walking champion.
Race walkers like Perrigo are
not well known because the
sport has yet to gain a large fol
lowing in this country. "Most
people don't even know it is an
international track and field
event," said Perrigo. "In Eu
rope, race walkers are re
spected athletes."
The distinctive style of walk
ing draws more laughs than
fans, according to Perrigo.
"People think it looks too fun
ny, so they never give it a try,"
she explained.
Race walkers are known for
their special technique which
features a swinging motion of
the hips accompanied by exag
gerated arm and shoulder
movement.
"Learning the correct form is
hard for most people, but for
some, it's real natural," Perrigo
remarked. "I know a few peo
ple who picked it up in just a
few hours."
There are only two rules
which restrict race walkers, ac
cording to Perrigo. First, one
foot must be touching the
ground at all times, and sec
ondly, each leg must be
straightened briefly while it is
in contact with the ground.
"When you're traveling at a
high rate of speed, it's easy to
break the rules, because you
tend to lift both feet off the
ground," she said. "It's ex
pecially hard for me since I was
a runner before I started con
centrating on race walking."
Perrigo said she began "duck
waddling" when she was 13.
She admits she didn't know the
sport even existed until she saw
some competitive walkers on
television. "Just out of curiosi
ty, I went outside and tried to
imitate them," she recalls. "It
was a lot of fun, so I decided to
learn more about it." Perrigo
checked out a library book

which described the history
and the rules of race walking.
After attending a few free
clinics, she entered and won
her first race.
The little gold-plated trophy
she earned in that race was in
centive enough to take race
walking more seriously. "Even
though I liked running, there
were too many track stars to
compete with," she said. "I fig
ured I had a better chance to
do well in walking races, be
cause there were rarely more
than three or four entrants my
age."
Perrigo competed in the Jun
ior Olympics in Yakima, Wash,
when she was 16. She broke the
national speed walking record
for girls 18 and under on the
three-mile course. Perrigo,
who lives in Richmond, Wash,
has competed in several races
throughout the Pacific
Northwest.
Race walking distances vary
from one to six miles. Walking
a mile takes between eight and
nine minutes. "Although race
walking is supposed to use

more muscles and energy than
jogging, I never really get
tired," the spirited student
said.
Perrigo claims that racewalk
ing is "a great sport for people
of all ages, and there are very
few injuries." She said that she
trains with a woman who is 50
years old.
There is no intercollegiate
competition yet, but Perrigo
thinks race walking "will be
added to Stanford's track pro
gram within a few years." That
her favorite sport isn't recog
nized doesn't mean she's ready
to abandon it. She heard about
a walking club in Menlo Park
and became a member this fall.
Perrigo continues to work out
on her own, walking five or six
miles a day.
"I usually train in the eve
nings when it's dark," she said.
"That way, I don't have to deal
with any sarcastic comments."
When Perrigo isn't practic
ing, she slows her pace down
and enjoys more sedentary ac
tivities such as reading, sewing,
and cooking.
