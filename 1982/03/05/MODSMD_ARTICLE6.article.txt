The University has bought out the Palo Alto Unified
School District's (PAUSD) lease on a University-owned
parcel of land which was for years the site of the Mayfield
School. Plans for the future use of the land have not
been formulated, according to Frank Morrow, director
of housing development at Stanford Real Estate.
The PAUSD, which had leased the site since 1923 and
whose current 50-year lease would not have expired
until 2023, had been renting the land for $1 a year. The
purchase price of the lease, determined in view of the
potential for building on the site, was $90,000. Negotia
tions with the PAUSD began with the school district
asking approximately $300,000, according to Kent Peter
son, associate vice president for business and finances
here.
The $1 payment had been a token to establish that a
contract had been entered into, said Rosemary Bednar,
property manager for the PAUSD. "Stanford had a re
sponsibility that the youngsters of faculty and parents in
the community receive an education nearby," said Bed
nar.

The University decided to negotiate for the lease
when the school building was no longer used for clas
sroom purposes. Palo Alto CETA programs had utilized
the site until December 1980, according to Bednar, at
which time they were moved to the Cubberley School.
Since then, the Mayfield School building had been used
for storage.
Morrow is currently involved in investigating the pos
sibilities for 112 future use of the 4.2 acre site, which is
located on El Camino Real near Page Mill Road. The city
of Palo Alto would liketosee housing there, he said, but
there are also possibilities for academic, commercial, or
mixed uses. Whatever proposals are made, "they will
grind through the University mill/' with the board of
trustees ultimately involved in the decision," he said. He
added that it may be a year before a decision is made.
For now, the only activity on the site has been the
demolition of the existing structure, which began early
this week. The University's first priority was to "(try) to
get rid of an attractive nuisance in order to minimize
liabilities," said Morrow. According to William Massy,
vice president of business and finance here, the cost for
termite repair alone would have been $400,000.
