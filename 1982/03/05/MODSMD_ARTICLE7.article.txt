## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Law School Prof. John Kaplan will
likely be named "a Resident Fellow
(RF) in one of the two new non
theme independent houses
scheduled to open this fall, accord
ing to sources within the University.
RFs have not been named for the
other non-theme house or for the
East Asian Studies theme house.
Kaplan told the Daily yesterday he
didn't think it was "official yet" that
he would be one of the new RFs.
"This kind of thing kind of 00/es
toward d result," Kaplan said, adding
that his appointment was "by no
means sure."
Norm Robinson, assot iate dean
lor residential education, would not
confirm the appointment.
"Ihere are some more meetings
next week and then the dec ision will
be c loser to being tinali/ecl," Robin
son said.
Kaplan, well known on < ampus loi

his popular undergraduate criminal
law class, said he sought the position
because he "thought it would be
fun." He added that his current posi
tion doesn't allow him enough time
for contact with undergraduates.
"My own kids are gone and I like to
have kids around," he said.
Kaplan was also intrigued by the
idea of working in the new dormitory
complex.
"I'm charmed by several ideas ot
working in a new dorm with no tradi
tion and a relatively small number ot
students," he said, adding that the RF
would be responsible lor only M)
students.
Now, University houses ol that
si/e do not have their own Rls.
Although he has a number ol new
program ideas, Kaplan said he did
not want lo divulge them yet bee ause
he wants lo lei the students decide
on ihem next yeai. I lowevei, Kaplan
said thai program ideas piesenl a leal

challenge.
"It's not so easy to engage Stan
ford students," he said.
According to Robinson, no special
efforts were made to obtain Kaplan
for the position.
Kaplan said that he had been ap
proached several years ago by resi
dential education about an RF job
and that he had kept in contact with
that office ever since.
Kaplan said that, if he were oftered
the position, he would probably only
accept it for one year. "I think one
year should be enough. I don't want
to carry this thing too tar," he said,
adding that it was c onceivable that he
would serve tor more than two years.
Kaplan's wile Elizabeth said that
the Kaplans will use this opportunity
to try living in a smaller place, be
cause they feel they have outgrown
their current home. I hey plan on re
nting out then house during their
stay in the doimitory, she said
