## Warning signs, pavement stripes, bike lanes suggested Plaza safety improvements proposed 
### Kathy Olmsted 
Physical improvements such as warning signs,
pavement stripes, bike lanes, "no bicycle" zones
and safety rules enforcement will be among a
Planning Office survey's recommendations for in
creasing campus bike safety, according to Campus
Planner Max Mazenko.
"We're basically trying to impose some order on
what is now an essentially uncontrolled situation,"
Mazenko said.
The report of the bicycle traffic survey of the
White Plaza area will be released in mid-March.
The Planning Office undertook the "sight
analysis" study in conjunction with the University
bicycle committee. Observers stationed at
strategic points of access in the White Plaza area
from »10 a.m. to 2 p.m. gathered data on traffic
patterns, points of conflict, accidents and poten
tial hazards.
Mazenko said White Plaza was selected as the
"target area" so that the study could focus its re

commendations on concrete suggestions for im
provements.
"We limited the area of study so we could be as
specific as possible," he said.

The area near Dinkelsgiel Auditorium is an
especially hazardous zone, Mazenko said, be
cause pedestrians linger to examine street ven
dors wares amidst high-speed bicycle traffic. He
said one way to avoid such dangerous situations

would be to declare the area a "no bicycle" zone.
Mazenko said the study's report would recom
mend physical improvements, emphasize
stronger enforcement of traffic rules and encour
age greater awareness of rider responsibility. Ear
lier bike traffic surveys have been undertaken by
the University, Mazenko said, but this study's de
tailed statistical analysis and recommendations for
actual physical improvements make it unique.
The study was initiated at the beginning of this
quarter. Mazenko said some "relatively easy" im
provements, such as pavement stripes and warn
ing signs, may be implemented as early as this
spring, but he said that actual physical reconfigur
ing would take longer.
Mazenko said it was difficult to determine the
precise cost of the survey, since volunteers, Uni
versity personnel and police officers were all in
volved. He said an outside bicycle traffic consul
tant will also be hired to "critique the report and
recommendations."
