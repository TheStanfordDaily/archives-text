THE SNEAKERS
The Stanford based band THE SNEAKERS are a five piece rock ensemble â€”
"ensemble" is the operative word here because The Sneakers don't rely on
grandiose effects or pyrotechnic solos aimed at getting that "gee-whiz" result.
Instead, The Sneakers have found a unicjue sound blending rock form and style
into a contemporary aesthetic. Also, The Sneakers are funky for your feet.
Thursday Night, March 10th
