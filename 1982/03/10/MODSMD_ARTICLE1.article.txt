Stanford's No. 3-ranked men's
swimming team wrested its first
Pac-10 championship from top
ranked UCLA this weekend at East
Los Angeles College pool.
The Cardinal edged the Bruins
426-415 on the final day of competi
tion, powered by a 1-2-3-4-5-6 sweep
of the JOO yard backstroke.
"I guess the one word that would
describe it is 'pride,' " coach Skip
Kennedy said. "They just put it all to
gether."
Although UCLA swimmers fin
ished either first or second in nine
events, Stanford's depth was the de
ciding factor The Cardinal qualified
more swimmers for this month's
NCAA championships, bringing its
total to 15. UCLA will send only 10
swimmers.
"In a championship style meet,

depth is really important," senior )oe
limine? said. Jiminez placed fourth
and broke a school record in the 100
yard breaststroke.
Leading the Cardinal attack, which
toppled five school records, was
Dave Bottom, who took second in
each of three individual events, hie
■set a varsity record in the 100 yard
butterfly with a 48.31 clocking.
Bottom finished second in the 200
yard backstroke behind John Engs
and ahead of three other Stanford
swimmers. All in all, the Cardinal
scored 68 points in the event and
"took a lot of wind out of UCLA,"
Kenney said.
Besides Jiminez and Bottom, Sam
Worden (200 IM) shattered school
marks. Lincoln and Engs were the
only two Card swimmers to take first
place honors.
After the first day of competition,

the Bruins held a 36 point advantage
over Stanford. However, the
Cardinal came back to lead UCLA by
only three points heading into Satur
day's final day of swimming.
Coach Kennedy and his team first
thought they had a legitimate chance
to win Stanford's first Pac-10 cham
pionship after the second day's com
petition. "We really didn't expect to
be ahead. The team was just so ex
cited that we knew we could win,"
Jiminez said.
All Stanford has to look forward to
now is the NCAA championships at
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the last
weekend in March. It should be a
three-way battle between Stanford,
UCLA and Texas. Kenney sees Texas
as the favorite.
In the individual events, "we're as
solid as any team that has ever swum
in the NCAAs," Kenney said.
