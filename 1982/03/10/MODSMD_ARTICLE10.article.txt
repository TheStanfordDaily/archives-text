# Inside
## Another night at 'the Goose' 
### Mark Peterson 
At 10 p.m. on Wednesday at the Dutch Goose, or "the Goose
as it is commonly known, footsteps crunch over a sea of peanut
shells that cover the bare cement floor.
Cigarette smoke lingers in the dimly-lit air above the sole pool
table and the jukebox plays rock'n'roll.
"No one under 21 allowed without a parent," a sloppy, hand
made sign reads. Only one of 15 tables is empty, and everyone
seems to be master of a glass or bottle of beer.
"My favorite dive" is the way junior Jim McGovern described
this Menlo Park bar. Calendar days seem to matter little here for
only the faces change from one night to the next. On any given
night, one can expect "the Goose" to seem busy, nearly full of
people in their early 20s, but still comfortable.
"The Goose" isn't for everyone, but it doesn't try to be. The
cappucino and croissant crowd have a host of restaurants and bars
to choose from, but the no-nonsense burgers and beer fare at
"the Goose" means that it isn't one of them.
The bar doubles as the food counter behind which a harried
young red-haired woman slings a patty from the grill to an ir
regularly shaped French bun. The completed burger, with just a
few token sesame seeds on it, rests in a small red plastic basket,
kept company by a tiny bag of plain potato chips.
"Gregg!" the redhead bellows. A young blond man steps for
ward. His contrived cool, La Coste shirt, designer jeans and
careful strut falter as his eyes light up in eager anticipation of the
burger waiting at the counter. After briefly pausing at the partially
hidden condiment counter, he quickly devours the treat.
Throughout the evening the burgers elicit signs of approval —
some are verbal, others nod in silent assent.

T/ie Coose'isn't for everyone, but it
doesn't try to be. The cappucino and
croissant crowd have a host of restaurants
and bars to choose from, but the no
nonsense burgers and beer fare at'the
Coose'means that it isn't one of them.

Peanuts seem not only a staple here, but also an object of recre
ation. Four bearded men in their mid-20s described by someone
at the bar as "engineering graduate students, sure as hell," seem
to take particular delight in discarding their shells onto the floor.
A 22-year-old glassy-eyed brunette contentedly flattens shells
on her table with the bottom of her beer glass, explaining to her
friends, "These hurt when you crunch them with your hands."
Her smashing tempo fluctuates with the music on the jukebox
and with her interest. Later in the evening, she proudly surveyed
her peanut powder and proclaimed, "I've done a good job."
The thick, wooden tables record the names and ideas of those
who have visited. A detailed soccer ball carved into one becomes
a pool of beer as the evening wanes.
Bob Dylan wails and no one seems to listen. The most inatten
tive are a predominantly male group who glued themselves early
in the evening to the six video games that line a far wall. One or
two men wait behind each fora chance to battle the machine.
"Asteroids" and "Centipede" demand special concentration, but
PacMan seems to be "the game to beat;" it often leaves its victims
tense and ready for another beer. A hollering, hack-slapping

camaraderie develops behind any player doing well.
Tom Petty hammers his electric guitar, "You don't! Have! To
live like a refugee!" The song fades into silence. The volume of
conversation grows. The jukebox resumes, and the volume drops.
An averaged-sized blond man about 25 years basks in the light
of the overhead Coors lamp as he bends over the pool table and
studies his shot. He hesitates much longer than he probably did
several beers earlier.
His opponent, a heavy, bearded man with a knife on his left hip,
jerkily moves his arms around before each shot, keeping the
mostly uninterested crowd at a comfortable distance.
With tables full, people drink and coverse standing in small
groups. Dress ranges from the greasiest t-shirts to coats and ties,
with the norm leaning well toward the former. Even those"well
dressed" look comfortable; comfort, it seems, is the only signifi
cant consideration.
Though "the Goose" is open until 2 a.m., the crowd begins to
thin around 12:30 a.m. Senior Mark Lazar, whose pile of shells in
dicates the length of his stay asked was asked why he comes to
"the Goose." With a quick glance toward the empty pitchers on
his table, he stroked his chin and responded, "It isa highly stimu
lating, highly intellectual atmosphere that allows me to pon
tificate on world affairs."
He grinned.


HAMBURGER HEAVEN —
Well-known for its hearty
fare and down to earth at
mosphere, the Dutch
Goose is a popular gather
ing place for students look

burger.

At 10 p.m. on Wednesday at the Dutch Goose, or "the Goose
as it is commonly known, footsteps crunch over a sea of peanut
shells that cover the bare cement floor.
Cigarette smoke lingers in the dimly-lit air above the sole pool
table and the jukebox plays rock'n'roll.
"No one under 21 allowed without a parent," a sloppy, hand
made sign reads. Only one of 15 tables is empty, and everyone
seems to be master of a glass or bottle of beer.
"My favorite dive" is the way junior Jim McGovern described
this Menlo Park bar. Calendar days seem to matter little here for
only the faces change from one night to the next. On any given
night, one can expect "the Goose" to seem busy, nearly full of
people in their early 20s, but still comfortable.
"The Goose" isn't for everyone, but it doesn't try to be. The
cappucino and croissant crowd have a host of restaurants and bars
to choose from, but the no-nonsense burgers and beer fare at
"the Goose" means that it isn't one of them.
The bar doubles as the food counter behind which a harried
young red-haired woman slings a patty from the grill to an ir
regularly shaped French bun. The completed burger, with just a
few token sesame seeds on it, rests in a small red plastic basket,
kept company by a tiny bag of plain potato chips.
"Gregg!" the redhead bellows. A young blond man steps for
ward. His contrived cool, La Coste shirt, designer jeans and
careful strut falter as his eyes light up in eager anticipation of the
burger waiting at the counter. After briefly pausing at the partially
hidden condiment counter, he quickly devours the treat.
Throughout the evening the burgers elicit signs of approval —
some are verbal, others nod in silent assent.

doesn't try to be. The cappucino and
croissant crowd have a host of restaurants
and bars to choose from, but the no
nonsense burgers and beer fare at'the
Coose'means that it isn't one of them.

Peanuts seem not only a staple here, but also an object of recre
ation. Four bearded men in their mid-20s described by someone
at the bar as "engineering graduate students, sure as hell," seem
to take particular delight in discarding their shells onto the floor.
A 22-year-old glassy-eyed brunette contentedly flattens shells
on her table with the bottom of her beer glass, explaining to her
friends, "These hurt when you crunch them with your hands."
Her smashing tempo fluctuates with the music on the jukebox
and with her interest. Later in the evening, she proudly surveyed
her peanut powder and proclaimed, "I've done a good job."
The thick, wooden tables record the names and ideas of those
who have visited. A detailed soccer ball carved into one becomes
