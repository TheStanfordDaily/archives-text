## Editorial Senate indecision harmful 
### 
After many campus organizations lost much of
their funding at the beginning of this quarter
due to an unprecedented number of fee
assessment refunds, it became obvious that the
current fee assessment system was faulty and
needed overhauling. More students claimed
refunds than voted in the fall election. We
believe that in the ideal system, only students
who vote should be allowed to claim a refund.
This practice would give students an incentive to
vote, probably increase voter turnout and thus
let more students indicate which groups they
think deserve financial support.
The ASSU Senate has spent countless hours
trying to formulate a single proposal that would
revamp the fee assessment system. Last night,
however, the deadlocked senate was finally able
to agree only on a proposal that did not even
address the all-important issue of refunds. The
senate was unable to resolve a conflict between
senators desiring a system much like the one
that the Daily suggested and senators desiring

changes that would make fee assessments
mandatory. As a last-gasp compromise, the
senate decided to put both measures on the
spring ballot to let students choose between the
two proposals or retain the present refund
system.
We feel that by doing this, the senate
abdicated its responsibility to negotiate and
propose a single amendment that would
address the major problem with the current
system: that students who don't bother to vote
are able to claim refunds and thereby cripple
student groups depending on fee assessment
funding. The issue is admittedly extremely
divisive; however, this divisiveness makes it
unlikely that the requisite two-thirds of the
voters will ratify the "refunds only for voters"
proposal when they have two other choices.
What is more likely — and extremely
unfortunate — is that neither plan will pass and
that the Association will be stuck with the
current faulty plan for at least two more years.
