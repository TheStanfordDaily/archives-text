## Discord in University library 
### 
Last July, the University Libraries'
entire work force was made to fill out
a long questionnaire, as part of a Li
brary staff survey.
Despite its grave flaws, it never
theless came up with some basic
truths. One was that the people who
work in the Library generally like and
respect each other; another, that the
very opposite is true of their feelings,
which range from "negative" to
"most negative," for the Library's ad
ministration and the way it does its
work. People "have most negative at
titudes about their personal frustra
tion" and"the degree to which job is
important to other aspects of one's
life" — in other words, a bad case of
alienation.
The negative attitude could have
been discovered free of charge for
years from any random sampling of
the staff. Instead, the University has
chosen to mount a major effort that
will, according to a Library official,
cost "at least a quarter million
dollars." We now have "leaders,"
"facilitators," "data collectors," a ton
of paperwork and a management
consultant to Ret us through Phase
Two of the Survey. That is when the
entire staff of about 350 will "break
out" into groups of 10 to spend
weeks on "problem identifying and
resolving."
The skeptics among us view this as
merely the latest and costliest in a
long and frustrating series of ex
ercises in futility, because we know
our administration to be most won
drously resistant to this sort of thing.
While, understandably, most
"problem identifying" has generally
been oral and informal, there is no
dearth of written proposals. Through
the years innumerable commissions,
task forces and committees — gener
ally created in answer to some crisis
— have come up with thoughtful and
well documented findings, which, if
acted on, could have spared us all a
lot of grief. The most salient were
consigned, in a virgin state, to a bot
tomless hole.
People have brought their prob
lems to the administration in every
possible way. In all too many cases,
they might as well have shot off paper
airplanes.
In 1980, the University treated the
Library's top brass to an expensive
Asilomar "retreat" to ponder the
question of "morale construction."
Morale is now where it had been
before — low.
There is about us a je ne sa/s quoi
that seems effectively to negate Stan
ford's attractions. Staff openings re
main unfilled very long. Despite the
economic straits of the profession,
good people from the outside seem
to find us easy to resist. On campus,
working in the library is viewed by
some as tantamount to exile in
Siberia.
The union could have handily won
last year's election had the rest of the
campus shared our regime.
Management in the Library is a rig
id hierarchy, responsive to what is
above and mostly deaf to staff below.
We are subject to policies on which
we never were consulted, made by
people who do not understand our
work and could not do it to save their
souls.
There are grave problems of job
classification, in which, the survey
says,"the staff felt most negatively
the influence of the directors."
Among professional librarians, wom
en are still clustered in the two lowest
ranks, where they outnumber men
by more than three to one. Most, no
matter how able and experienced,
are, by administrative decree, frozen
there in perpetuity.
Our directors are housed in a well
carpeted bunker, accessible through
an inconspicuous stairway well away
from the rest of the Library. From
there they emerge but rarely to man
ifest themselves to the staff. Some

people have never laid eyes on David
Weber, our chief director. Com
munication is clearly not invited.
Frank criticism is deemed, on fairly
solid evidence, to be professionally
suicidal. (I myself, long in open dis
agreement with the orthodoxy, dis
covered a notation in my personnel
file, made by Weber some years
before, labelling me "a dissident ele
ment" who had to be placed under
surveillance.)
As we approach that annual rite of
spring known as the performance ap
praisal, in which we struggle valiantly
to find intelligent and not too debas
ing answers to some humiliating
questions, it is galling to reflect how
much better we are at our work than
our judges are at theirs.
We are not exactly spoiled for ave
nues of recourse within the institu
tion. The Personnel Office is neither

empowered nor inclined to institute
remedial measures.
The Provost's man to oversee li
brarians, Keith Smith, seems blithely
disinterested in what goes on. No
one above him has so far shown
much visible concern. Stanford's
abominable grievance procedure
has a particularly discriminatory re
striction added for librarians, render
ing it virtually unusable as an instru
ment for redress.
Library officials tell us that "except
for benefit matters beyond Library

control," the resultsof thesurvey will
stay with the Library administration.
We are, our consultant tells us, to
"regard this like a medical check
up." But the trouble is that with us it
is the doctor who is causing the ill
ness and carrying our symptoms to
him is not likely to effect the cure.
There are people on the staff who
will uphold authority for its own
sake. There are also some so new, or
with jobs so narrowly confined, that
they do not feel themselves affected.
There are a few sanctuaries where
good and decent supervisors create a
buffer between their staffs and the
administration and people work in
congenial atmosphere. But what this
survey has revealed is the sentiment
of all too many and it should be
known outside the confines of the Li
brary.
The University never tires of re
minding us of the finiteness of its re
sources. But there are times when its
indulgence has no limit. In a less
perfect place, when a management,
presumed to be collecting an annual
$40-70,000 apiece, after many years in
office needs at least a quarter million
doMarj and the concerted labors of
350 of its staff to teach it how to do its
job, it might readily be certified as
hopeless and replaced.
But this is Stanford. And as we toil
— already conveniently idled for the
purpose by our near-defunct com
puter system — to do the work of our
august superiors, as we catalogue the
pettily repressive, the callously de
meaning measures, the coun
terproductive policies, the arrogant
and graceless acts and try to devise
ways of making the leopards change
their spots, there is no doubt already
waiting in the wings a savior. It is the
Stress Consultant — a permanent ad
dition to our directional corps. That
person will, of course, be a woman,
to prove that henceforth not all our
directors need be men. At a mere
$50,000 a year it will be her task to
make us co-exist in bovine bliss with
a system we have known and loathed
so long.
She will have her job cut out for
her.
