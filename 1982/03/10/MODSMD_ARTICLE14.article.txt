# Grades cannot measure self worth
## 
### 
Some people swear they exist. They say any day now
the letter grade gods will descend upon Stanford to dis
tribute quarterly evaluations to their subjects. Magically,
the gods will transform real people into walking, talking
letter grades. From the air, the campus will look like a
giant bowl of alphabet soup with bobbing As, Bs, Cs, Ds
and (the letter grade gods forbid) Fs.
Certainly it is ludicrous to suggest such polytheism ex
ists in the minds of students like ourselves. I myself do
not believe in the letter grade gods, but too often, I fear,
I allow the fantasy to thrive. In other words, I allow
grades to become the gods which judge my worth as a
human being. The trap is an easy one to fall into and a
difficult one to get out of. Before we grovel at the feet of
these gods, let us consider that grades can become a
faulty standard, a misleading indicator of our worth.
To begin with, grades are important. They are part of a
necessary system that provides students and adminis
trators with information about one's academic per
formance. They attempt to evaluate our understanding
of the subject and the amount of time we chose to put
into the course.
The problem arises when we allow grades to govern
beyond the domain for which they were designed. To
make grades the verdict on all aspects of our personality
is as unreliable a standard as judging the strength of all
animals by how well they can swim. The goldish wins; the

lion loses. Obviously, this will not work. In the same way,
grades do not measure our ability to have successful
friendships and the degree to which we address human
needs — areas which many scholars would consider the
goal of knowledge.
While many students would agree that grades ac
curately judge only a limited aspect of our lives, few peo
ple are able to put this perspective to practical use. The
transitory nature of grades puts many of us on an emo
tional roller coaster that either peaks or dips with the
final grade.
Such a loss of worth can give us a myopic outlook that
not only alters our perception of self but can affect our
relationships with others as well. Grades become a con
venient way to compare ourselves to 12,000 other stu
dents. A consistent view of ourselves as inferior can drain
us of motivation and lead us to envy. If we receive higher
than average marks, the temptation to consider all
aspects of our life as superior can lead to insensitivity and
arrogance.
For some, a valid measure of self-worth is the degree
to which we serve the needs of others. The ability to
achieve economic security for one's family will be anoth
er's criterion for worth. Still others will be satisfied with
their attempt to live in moral uprightness.
During these last days, some questions need answers.
If grades should not determine our worth, what should?
Do we have value that does not change with our suc
cesses and failures? If we are to avoid the instability and
tribulation that an inflated perspective of grades can
produce, we must seek a standard that will condemn the
letter grade gods to mythology.
