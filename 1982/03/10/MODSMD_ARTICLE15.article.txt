## Contradicting policies in CIA 
### 
Currently, there is a bill before
Congress that will make it a felony for
ex-CIA agents like John Stockwell,
(who lectured here on Feb. 22), to re
veal past CIA ativities. However, we
feel it is imperative that the public be
informed of the true subversive na
ture of the CIA. President Ronald
Reagan's current re-licensing of the
ClA's current activities presents a
grave danger to world peace.
If Reagan secures the passage of
this bill and continues to back the ef
forts of the CIA without closely
monitoring its activities, limited con
flicts like those in Nicaragua and El
Salvador could escalate into large
scale conventional warfare or possi
bly nuclear conflict.
After reflecting on Stockwell's lec
ture, we were alarmed by the degree
to which American policy is de
termined by our "invisible govern
ment" — namely the CIA.
Stockwell's enlightening exposure of
past CIA acitivities necessitates a re
examination of Reagan's current rel
icensing of the ClA's covert actions.
In essence, Reagan is freeing the CIA
to assume autonomous activities
characterized by abusive methods
which contradict the basic freedoms
upon which our government was
founded.
By subverting the intentions of
American foreign policy officials, the
CIA directs our foreign affairs
without the sanction of the presi
dent, Congress, or the electorate.
Given Stockwell's analysis of the
negative consequences of CIA in
volvement in Vietnam and Angola,
we fear that Reagan's policy could re
sult in a contemporary revival of CIA
subversion in military hotbeds such
as Nicaragua and El Salvador.

In his 13 years with the CIA,
Stockwell witnessed numerous CIA
abuses, the most shocking of which
occurred when he was a top-level ad
visor to the National Security Coun
cil. Commenting on his first assign
ment as a case officer in Africa, he
mentioned a specific incident in
which the CIA indirectly stimulated a
communist rebellion. Because
Stockwell had been under pressure
to reveal communist infiltration, he
in turn pressured one of the African
agents to come up with anything
which might indicate communist ac
tivity. The repeated inquiries of his
agent actually encouraged one dis
illusioned government official to
plan a communist-backed coup.
Stockwell was rewarded with a pro
motion for uncovering a plot which
he had indirectly brought to fruition.
In Vietnam, Stockwell became
further disenchantd when he was
forced to manipulate information
from his North Vietnamese agents.
Stockwell's attempts to relay ac
curate information which would
have resulted in appropriate and
more succesful policy measures were
halted by the CIA.
Furthermore, the information was
altered to match the policies and de
sires that top-level officials, such as
former Sec. of State Henry Kissenger,
promoted in the United States. Con
sequently, as Stockwell expected,
American leaders were extremely
surprised when South Vietnam fell
under a well-organized Northern at
tack.
Three months after returning from
Vietnam, Stockwell was appointed
the head of the Angola Task Force.
During this assignment, Stockwell

was among the joint chiefs of staff ad
vising Kissenger. Although Stockwell
personally opposed American in
tervention in Angola, his CIA con
temporaries waged a covert war
against Soviet and Cuban forces
without the authority of the presi
dent, the National Security Council,
or the Congress. Moreover, the CIA
also operated a propaganda program
designed to misinform the American
public about the actual occurances in
Angola.
Because the CIA openly lied to the
president and to Congress about U.S.
involvement in Angola, American of
ficials openly denounced interven
tion by any nation. As a result, the
U.S. government found itself preach
ing one doctrine while unknowingly
abiding by another.
Allowing the CIA unabridged free
dom to control our foreign policy
raises several questions. Are the
means by which the CIA protects for
eign nations from communist
takeover acceptable? Furthermore,
are their ends desirable? It is ironic
that the CIA secures our nation's
freedom from communism with cor
rupt and abusive methods like
bribery, extortion and assassination
which are antithetical to our demo
cratic values of liberty and freedom.
It is our opinion that the CIA, in its
autonomous foreign adventures, has
subverted American foreign policy
goals, thereby causing increased ten
sion and hostility between the Unit
ed States and its communist ad
versaries.

feel it is imperative that the public be
informed of the true subversive na
ture of the CIA. President Ronald
Reagan's current re-licensing of the
ClA's current activities presents a
grave danger to world peace.
If Reagan secures the passage of
this bill and continues to back the ef
forts of the CIA without closely
monitoring its activities, limited con
flicts like those in Nicaragua and El
Salvador could escalate into large
scale conventional warfare or possi
bly nuclear conflict.
After reflecting on Stockwell's lec
ture, we were alarmed by the degree
to which American policy is de
termined by our "invisible govern
ment" — namely the CIA.
Stockwell's enlightening exposure of
past CIA acitivities necessitates a re
examination of Reagan's current rel
icensing of the ClA's covert actions.
In essence, Reagan is freeing the CIA
to assume autonomous activities
characterized by abusive methods
which contradict the basic freedoms
upon which our government was
founded.
By subverting the intentions of
American foreign policy officials, the
CIA directs our foreign affairs
without the sanction of the presi
dent, Congress, or the electorate.
Given Stockwell's analysis of the
negative consequences of CIA in
volvement in Vietnam and Angola,
we fear that Reagan's policy could re
sult in a contemporary revival of CIA
subversion in military hotbeds such
as Nicaragua and El Salvador.

In his 13 years with the CIA,
Stockwell witnessed numerous CIA
abuses, the most shocking of which
occurred when he was a top-level ad
visor to the National Security Coun
cil. Commenting on his first assign
ment as a case officer in Africa, he
mentioned a specific incident in
which the CIA indirectly stimulated a
communist rebellion. Because
Stockwell had been under pressure
to reveal communist infiltration, he
in turn pressured one of the African
agents to come up with anything
which might indicate communist ac
tivity. The repeated inquiries of his
agent actually encouraged one dis
illusioned government official to
plan a communist-backed coup.
Stockwell was rewarded with a pro
motion for uncovering a plot which
he had indirectly brought to fruition.
In Vietnam, Stockwell became
further disenchantd when he was
forced to manipulate information
from his North Vietnamese agents.
Stockwell's attempts to relay ac
curate information which would
have resulted in appropriate and
more succesful policy measures were
halted by the CIA.
Furthermore, the information was
altered to match the policies and de
sires that top-level officials, such as
former Sec. of State Henry Kissenger,
promoted in the United States. Con
sequently, as Stockwell expected,
American leaders were extremely
surprised when South Vietnam fell
under a well-organized Northern at
tack.
Three months after returning from
Vietnam, Stockwell was appointed
the head of the Angola Task Force.
During this assignment, Stockwell

was among the joint chiefs of staff ad
vising Kissenger. Although Stockwell
personally opposed American in
tervention in Angola, his CIA con
temporaries waged a covert war
against Soviet and Cuban forces
without the authority of the presi
dent, the National Security Council,
or the Congress. Moreover, the CIA
also operated a propaganda program
designed to misinform the American
public about the actual occurances in
Angola.
Because the CIA openly lied to the
president and to Congress about U.S.
involvement in Angola, American of
ficials openly denounced interven
tion by any nation. As a result, the
U.S. government found itself preach
ing one doctrine while unknowingly
abiding by another.
Allowing the CIA unabridged free
dom to control our foreign policy
raises several questions. Are the
means by which the CIA protects for
eign nations from communist
takeover acceptable? Furthermore,
are their ends desirable? It is ironic
that the CIA secures our nation's
freedom from communism with cor
rupt and abusive methods like
bribery, extortion and assassination
which are antithetical to our demo
cratic values of liberty and freedom.
It is our opinion that the CIA, in its
autonomous foreign adventures, has
subverted American foreign policy
goals, thereby causing increased ten
sion and hostility between the Unit
ed States and its communist ad
versaries.

Currently, there is a bill before
Congress that will make it a felony for
ex-CIA agents like John Stockwell,
(who lectured here on Feb. 22), to re
veal past CIA ativities. However, we
feel it is imperative that the public be
informed of the true subversive na
