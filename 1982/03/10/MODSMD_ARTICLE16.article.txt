## Tight funding for guest professors 
### 
As the major policy maker of the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board, I feel it is my duty to explain to the Stan
ford community my board's Guest Fellowship program,
which brings lecturers to Stanford for prolonged en
gagements less than a quarter. While the Daily editorial
raises some good points ("GP Board purpose mis
taken," March 5), I feel it shows a basic misunderstand
ing of the program and its intent.
The program is not new to the Guest Professorship
Board or the ASSU and is loosely based on the "Guest
in-Residence" program initiated in 1974 by the ASSU,
which was designed to "weave together the larger and
more formal kinds of appearances that visiting speakers
normally make with smaller and more loosely structured
formats for interaction with students." Our program
proposes to do just this. The speakers we bring offer
practical workshops, educational lectures and in
formative sherry hours.
The Fellowship program of the Guest Professorship
Board was resuscitated this year in an attempt to increase
the flexibility and utility of the Board to the University
community; we bring more speakers to campus for fel

lowships than for professorships for simple monetary
and logistical reasons. We hope these fellowships will
further enrich each student's education experience
here.
This year, we mailed over forty invitations to members
of the media, the political and literary worlds, and the
corporate sector; this spring we will have one guest pro
fessor. The time constraints of teaching a ten week
course, even at a noted and respected institution such as
Stanford, are just too often too much for these individ
uals to fit into their schedules. Thus, we try to bring them
to campus for shorter periods of time.
These guest fellowships can be just as valuable to stu
dents as full professorships, and are inherently more at
tractive to the individuals we contact.
While we in no way will sacrifice our guest pro
fessorship program, we feel that the guest fellowship
program is a viable educational opportunity and, as such,
benefits the University community.
