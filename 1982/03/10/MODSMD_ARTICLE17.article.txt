## FEIFFER Commentary/Tracey Minkin A 						look beyond the scenes of this year's star films 
### 
With the arrival of the new year
and every living film critic's
best/worst lists for 1981 filling the
newspaper and magazine pages, I
have decided to submit for your con
sideration my top five film picks of
the past year. The films are in random
order.
REDS: A surprise. In the wake of
films like "The Greek Tycoon," a fic
tional (nudge nudge) story that ends
up remarkably similar to (wink wink)
some celebrity's personal life, this
film had a bit of a handicap against it.
But kudos to director Warren Beatty
whose unerring eye for fashion and
color turned Reds into a super-slick,
high-gloss, truly '80s film. The story
line is simple — in the near future,
the wife of the country's most pow
erful politician goes on an epic voy
age to find the perfect shade of
crimson for her husband's inaugural
ball. The scope of the film is indeed
epic; Beatty takes his crew on loca
tion from Rodeo Drive and sth Ave
nue to London and Paris and these in
ternational fashion show scenes rival
the ballroom sequences from "Dr.
Zhivago." Jane Wyatt is superb as
Nanette and the faded film star
Ronald Reagan (The Knute Rockney
Story) is passable as the President.
From the novel by Bill Blass, this is a
must-see for the aesthetic-conscious
film-goer.

The French
Lieutenant's
Accountant:
We first see the
mysterious Jacques
L Argent walking the
Champs Elysees in the
rain. As he unfolds his
story to a love-struck
foreign exchange
student, we discover
that he has been the
personal accountant
for Charles le Chien,
tha well-known
French military
leader.

PULLOVER: Mention the names
Fonda and Kristofferson in the same
breath and you have a breath that will
take you all the way to the bank to
collect — over and over. But
"Pullover" doesn't stop at the big
names that headline — this film truly
explores the breadth and depth of
those performer's talents by placing
them in roles quite outside of their
standard characters. Fonda is Muffy
St. Clair, sorority president at the
University of Virginia and Kristof
ferson is Big Wainwright, crew cap
tain and student body president. Im
mersed in what begins as a grapple
for social control of the university,
the two fall deeply in love and pair up
as a united force to take over U of Va.
Trouble arrives however, with an at

tempted deal with the small Com
munist Youth Brigade contingent
which leads to a climactic conclusion
that should not be revealed ahead of
time. Fonda is beautiful as ever in a
Talbot's collection of crew necks and
knee-socks, and Kristofferson,
without the beard, looks right at
home in button-downs and tartan
bow-ties. Their chemistry, as could
be predicted, is perfect. This film
should be commended for remind
ing us how the business of social stat
ure, not of foreign policy or econom
ics, is the stuff that keeps our world
on its precarious balance. "Pullover"
is a tight film; everyone who's any
one is seeing it.
THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S AC
COUNTANT: Since the birth of the
movies, filmmakers have utilized
their medium to make political
statements — from Chaplin's in
spired Hitlerian dance with a lighter
than-air globe in"The Great Dic
tator" to "Z's" brutal portrayal of in
ternational intrigue. 1981 has given
us another brilliant socio-political
commentary, "The French Lieuten
ant's Accountant." Set in modern
day France, we first see the mys
terious Jacques L'Argent walking the
windblown Champs Elysees in the
rain. As he unfolds his story to a love
struck foreign exchange student, we
discover that he has been the person
al accountant for Charles Le Chien,
the well-known French military lead
er. L'Argent, in a brilliantly acted
scene with the girl, recounts his trag
ic end with Le Chien at the election
of Mitterand and the rise of the so
cialist party in France. L'Argent, "le
materialiste," as he is now called by
his fellow Parisiennes, has become an
outcast in his own city. But as soon as
we become immersed in this tragic
tale, we are spun around and our
L'Argent is now an American tourist,
the girl a Russian ballet dancer, and
they are in occupied Paris during the
second World War. Exercises in visual
and textual non sequitor, these se
quences subtly imply the transitory
nature of the French government in
the recent years. A daring and in
tellectually challenging work, "The
French Leiutenant's Accountant"
takes its place with the world's finest
political films.
LARIATS OF FIRE: What I expected
to be just another squeeze of the
country-western grip on the nation
turned out to be one of the most
focused and loving portrayal of two
men and the competition that brings
them together that I have seen in
years. The story is of two lariat
twirlers — Murray Rosnik, an insur
ance salesman from Trenton, New
Jersey, and Buck "Wristwrangler"
Morris, a ranch-hand from Kalispel,
Montana — and their contrasted
paths which eventually cross at the
National Twirling and Hog Calling
Competition in Crystal, North Dako
ta. All of director Hugh Hudson's mo
tions sharpen the differences be
tween the men, from the salesman's
long nights of training to prove that
"urban cowboys can twirl alongside
any red-neck schlemeil," to Buck's
simple words to any army of photog
raphers and journalists. "I twirl to

please Him" (Him, we later discover,
is Roy Orbison). Hudson had em
ployed world-renowned cinemato
grapher Janos Komenicevek to vivify
his work of contrasts and the film be
comes like a two-sided masterpiece
— Komenicevek evokes the bone
dry dust of the ranches by actually
smudging dirt on the camera lens,
and calls up the gray grime of the
cities with a harshness I haven't seen
since "Midnight Cowboy." the pow
erful, moving score featuring slide
guitars and is available on RCA rec
ords.
ABSENCE OF DALLAS: A
documentary, this searing expose
picks up the lives of eight "Dallas"
viewers at the beginning of the sea
son and follows them over the eight
months of new programming. What
sets this film apart from the "day-in
the-life" cinema verite that has be
come such the cliche of late is an ad

dition of experimental control into
the situation — at the half-way point
of the season,, filmmaker Sidney

A documentary, this
searing expose picks
up the lives of eight
Dallas viewers at the
beginning of the
season and follows
them over the eight
months of new
programming.

Pollock and his team enter the eight
homes and forbid the subjects to
watch "Dallas" for the remainder of
the season. And the results, candidly

recorded, are electrifying. Memo
rable moments include subject Hetta
Q. running through the streets of
Chicago, carrying a scaled-down oil
well, looking for some open space to
"set up the new well that J.R. needs
after selling off that other one to save
Ewing Oil." Pollock's use of the
steadfcam in pursuing Hetta from
street into police car and finally to
Cook County Mental Rehabilitation
Facility is powerful — never ob
trusive. This film is frank, and its style
reflects this stance; Pollock has
staved off excessive artistry for veri
similitude, and it works — beau
tifully. In this age of psychology and
pursuit of self-understanding,
"Absence of Dallas" is a timely and
provocative piece.

English who should spend less time at
the movies and more time with her
homework.)
