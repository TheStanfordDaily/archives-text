## Painting a different picture 
### 
I feel compelled to write in objec
tion to Meredith Wadman's some
what bitter opinions about Roble
Hall residents and the world (Daily,
March 5). By comparing paint to pov
erty and margaritas to racism, she
concludes that Roble is a place where
people don't care about anything im
portant.
I agree with Wadman that world
poverty is a much more important is
sue than paint and likewise racism
than drinking a margarita. I also
agree that some people at Stanford
tend to behave selfishly. But I feel
that the rest of the article fails to con
sider the whole picture.
Wadman seems to imply that it is
almost shameful to become involved
with any causes that are not of world
wide significance. In other words, if I
feel strongly about something but it
is below a certain level of im
portance, I must always ignore it.
Such an attitude makes little sense to
me.
Since I was active in the Roble
paint petition drive, I would like to
correct Wadman's description of its
purpose, which she states was to "re
move" the paint. The intent behind
the petition was not to rip the doors
off their hinges, sandblast them and
repaint them. Rather, it was designed
(1), to prevent the University from
spending thousands of dollars to re
paint Roble when the vast majority of
students did not feel that it was nec
essary and (2), to encourage Main
tenance to ask student opinion
through Roble corridor council next
time to see if there is a consensus
before they suddenly appear and
start repainting the dorm a new col-

The results of the paint petition:
since Roble is almost completely
painted now, they will finish the job
but will ask for student opinion
before painting any dorms in the
future.
My major objection to Wadman's
viewpoint is the insinuation that peo
ple who do not pursue causes in the
way that she wants them to are there
fore obviously selfish and un
charitable. I spoke with a Roble
woman who, although she did not at
tend the "Unlearning Racism" work
shop, spends hours every week with
underpriveledged minority children.
Many people choose to give dona
tions directly to hunger organiza
tions rather than to fast fora day.
In conclusion, although I greatly
appreciate Wadman's efforts to in
crease campus involvement with
world causes, I would encourage a
greater respect for alternative means
by which to achieve the same ends.

We all wish the year had been
more successful for Stanford's bas
ketball team, whose members work
so hard and who have lost so many
close games. I for one would like to
thank the team members for their ef
forts and wish them well as they close
out the season. I particularly want to
thank Doug Marty and Brian Welch
who have provided so many memor
able moments over the past four
years. You will be missed!
