# Students to vote on fee assessment revisions
## 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate, deadlocked over
the issue of the refundability of fee
assessments, last night placed two
constitutional amendments on the
spring ballot so that students could
decide the issue.
In the election, students will
choose between between an amend
ment eliminating fee assessment re
funds and another that would limit
refunds to students who voted in the
election in which the assessments
were authorized. A third alternative
would be to vote against both of the
amendments, thus maintaining the
present refundable system.
After more than three hours of de
bate, senators were unable to muster
enough votes to approve a single
comprehensive plan to restructure
the fee assessment system and could
agree only to place a third amend

ment before the student body that
would alter the current procedures
for student groups to get on the
ballot.
The proposed amendments need
to be approved by two-thirds of the
voters to be ratified.
The senate could not agree on
whether a comprehensive amend
ment should institute a non-refun
dable system or should merely limit
refunds to students who voted. After
a series of votes demonstrated that
neither proposal was supported by
the 14 senators necessary for place
ment on the ballot, the senators de
cided to let the student body vote on
both alternatives.
"Let's let the student body decide
this," Finance Committee Chairman
Mark Epstein said. ' They're the ones
that hired us, they're the ones that'll
fire us."
"We can't seem to decide anything

The fee assessment reform dis
cussion began with the consideration
of a constitutional amendment pro
posed by the Rules Committee that
limited refunds to students who
voted and made it harder for student
groups seeking assessment funds to
be placed on the ballot.
Senator Marty Roberts then pro
posed that the bill be amended to de
lete a section outlining assessment
refund procedures, which would
have essentially eliminated refunds.
Although his amendment passed, the
