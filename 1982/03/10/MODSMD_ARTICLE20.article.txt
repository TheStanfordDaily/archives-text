## C League: it's the real thing 
### 
There's less than a minute left in
triple overtime and tempers are run
ning hot as one of our team's fouled
goes up fora shot. The opposition
disputes the call and ultimately has a
technical foul levied on them for un
sportsmanlike conduct.
Is this a pro basketball game with
big bucks resting on the outcome?
Nope. Then, is it NCAA cham
pionship action? Nope. Is it at least a
varsity game with pride resting on the
line? Again, nope. What we are deal
ing with here is the lowest o. the low,
the veritable scrubs of the scrubs: an
intramural C League game. This is a

There are those who
would argue that the
C Leagues are there
so that those without
talent (excuse me,
those whose talent
isn't as developed)
can pretend that
they're playing a real
game. / have only one
thing to say to that:
hogwash.

contest which should rightfully be
called a comedy of errors. It is a game
in which the team that wins should
be the one that has the most fun, not
the one with the most points at the
end.
Many — let's qualify that and say
most — people at Stanford have ag
gressive, competitive, type-A per
sonalities. How else would they have
gotten here?. They maintain that life
is serious business, and if you don't
take it seriously you'll never get what
you want/need (read: medical-law
business school or that oh-so-impor
tant IM win). They'll say, in so many
words, "I need to get where I'm
going, so don't get in my way or I'll be
forced to run you down." I won't be
hypocritical and exempt myself
wholly from this class of people, but I
do tend to spend long hours trying to
find respite from the proverbial rat
race.
I like to play basketball, but I don't
play very well, so it makes little dif
ference to me if I win or lose. The
most important thing, as far as I am
concerned, is to have a good time.
I've been playing C League hoop for
three years and I've been glad to see
that most of the other people in
volved share my attitude towards the
game. But occasionally I run across a
team such as the one mentioned
above, a team with the Vince Lom

bardl ""winning Is everything" view
port. It is hard enough coping with
this attitude in the real world, not to
mention the stepping up it under
goes in Stanford's academic world, so
when it invades my hiding places I
begin to get angry. Somehow the fun
goes out of it when you play with
people who point, yell, argue, insult
and taunt whenever you feel that the
powers-that-be have done them an
injustice. Unfortunately, it is all too
easy to get mad, not with these peo
ple, but at them. The world might be
a better place if good feelings were
more contagious than bad ones.

There are those who would argue
that the C Leagues are there so that
those without talent (excuse me,
those whose talent isn't as de
veloped) can pretend that they're

p\aymg a game. \ Yiave orrty one
thing to say to that: hogwash. There is
no such thing as a "real" game, as
they seem to define it, in intramural
sports, because the only thing at
stake is fun. Let's face facts; the out
come of the game isn't going to affect
anything. It won't change anyone's
life, destroy empires, or build
dynasties. It's just a game. I'm not
saying don't play to win, just don't
play only to win.
So relax, Stanford. Kick back and
have a beer. Watch a sunset. Go fora
walk. Do something that you enjoy
and ask yourself if the anxiety, the in
tensity, the pressure, are really worth
it. I think you'll find that they aren't.
Afterword: we won the game.

goes out of it when you play with
people who point, yell, argue, insult
and taunt whenever you feel that the
powers-that-be have done them an
injustice. Unfortunately, it is all too
easy to get mad, not with these peo
ple, but at them. The world might be
a better place if good feelings were
more contagious than bad ones.

There are those who would argue
that the C Leagues are there so that
those without talent (excuse me,
those whose talent isn't as de

thing to say to that: hogwash. There is
no such thing as a "real" game, as
they seem to define it, in intramural
sports, because the only thing at
stake is fun. Let's face facts; the out
come of the game isn't going to affect
anything. It won't change anyone's
life, destroy empires, or build
dynasties. It's just a game. I'm not
saying don't play to win, just don't
play only to win.
So relax, Stanford. Kick back and
have a beer. Watch a sunset. Go fora
walk. Do something that you enjoy
and ask yourself if the anxiety, the in
tensity, the pressure, are really worth
it. I think you'll find that they aren't.
Afterword: we won the game.

There's less than a minute left in
triple overtime and tempers are run
ning hot as one of our team's fouled

disputes the call and ultimately has a
technical foul levied on them for un
sportsmanlike conduct.
Is this a pro basketball game with
big bucks resting on the outcome?
Nope. Then, is it NCAA cham
pionship action? Nope. Is it at least a
varsity game with pride resting on the
line? Again, nope. What we are deal

the veritable scrubs of the scrubs: an

contest which should rightfully be
called a comedy of errors. It is a game
in which the team that wins should
be the one that has the most fun, not
the one with the most points at the
end.
Many — let's qualify that and say
most — people at Stanford have ag
gressive, competitive, type-A per
sonalities. How else would they have
gotten here?. They maintain that life
is serious business, and if you don't
take it seriously you'll never get what
you want/need (read: medical-law
business school or that oh-so-impor
tant IM win). They'll say, in so many
words, "I need to get where I'm
going, so don't get in my way or I'll be
forced to run you down." I won't be
hypocritical and exempt myself
wholly from this class of people, but I
do tend to spend long hours trying to
find respite from the proverbial rat
race.
I like to play basketball, but I don't
play very well, so it makes little dif
ference to me if I win or lose. The
most important thing, as far as I am
concerned, is to have a good time.
I've been playing C League hoop for
three years and I've been glad to see
that most of the other people in
volved share my attitude towards the
game. But occasionally I run across a
team such as the one mentioned
above, a team with the Vince Lom

port. It is hard enough coping with
this attitude in the real world, not to
mention the stepping up it under
goes in Stanford's academic world, so
when it invades my hiding places I
