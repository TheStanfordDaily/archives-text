Backpack injuries
Doctors have found that students who
wear their backpacks incorrectly may
have problems ranging from severe mus
cle pain to sway-back, according to The
University Daily Kansan. Martin
Wollman, director of Student Health Ser
vices there, said that overstuffed
backpacks, in particular, could cause
physical problems. Jean Hiebert, super
visor of physical therapy at Watkins Me
morial Hospital, said students could ex
perience spasms in the upper back or
shoulder area and muscle strain in the
lower back if they wore packs improperly.
She cited the large number of students
who wear backpacks slung over one
shoulder, which causes the weight of the
pack to be unevently distributed. A local
store owner told The Daily Kansan that
backpacks should be worn high on the
back and snug — so that the main body of
the pack is between the shoulders. He
said backpacks that hung away from the
back could cause continuous pressure on
the shoulders, and students whose
backpacks are too low on the back or too
heavy could get sway-back. Take heed,
Stanford, and if the backpack fits,..
Honesty's the best •••
A record number 6f student sus
pensions has been set at the University of
Maryland in College Park, reports its daily
newspaper, the diamondback. There
have been 34 suspensions for academic
dishonesty since last fall and more in one
week than there were in an entire year,
before the new student conduct code was

implemented two years ago, said Gary
Pavela, judicial programs director. He
said, "The new code puts the burden on
the student to convince the hearing panel
they should not be suspended. And one
quarter of first-time offenders have not
been able to do that." He said hearing
panels for cheaters are set up within the
academic division on an ad hoc basis, with
one student and two faculty members on
each panel. He said that panel decisions
can often produce a domino effect. A
year before the code went into effect,
fewer than six people were suspended,
said Pavel. Since then, however, the
number has increased with each semes
ter; "Once you break the ice and start sus
pending first offenders, other panels be
come less timid and will do it also," he
said.
Under the original student code, most
students caught cheating were auto
matically failed from the class and barred
from participating in all campus extracur
ricular activities. According to the new
code, adopted in January 1980, students
face a possible expulsion from the univer
sity and, as before, may see the act per
manently recorded on their academic
transcripts. Marilyn Berman, assistant en
gineering dean, said, "There isn't more
cheating; it's just being reported more."
Pavels said he thinks the stricter policies
will result in less cheating.
Changing lanes
The bicycle "experiment" designed to
promote safety for cyclists and pedestri
ans at the University of Oregon in Eugene
is currently being reviewed, according to

the Oregon Daily tmerald. The experi
ment began last fall when the university
passed a law restricting cyclists to "desig
nated bicycle routes and on streets gener
ally available to vehicular traffic" be
tween 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., weekdays.
Small traffic signs have been posted along
bicycle routes. The Emerald reports that
so far the restrictions haven't been
backed by formal enforcement. When
the campus planning committee pro
posed the "experiment," it said it hoped
that the regulations would be "largely
self-enforcing in that bicyclists will find
designated routes safer and more open
and that pedestrians will gently but firmly
call attention to bikers who have strayed
from the bike routes." Now the commit
tee is asking for student and faculty opin
ion concerning the cyclists prohibition
from sidewalks. Prof. Ron Sheriffs said he
had originally wanted a much tougher
proposal than that which was passed.
"There was a hazard," he said, because
"the cyclists were like so many sharks.
We've had more than our share of stu
dents and faculty being bumped by
bikes." Sheriffs said he is satisfied with the
current proposal which allows bicyclists
to reach "virtually every building on cam
pus." Are designated bike paths the an
swer to campus congestion at Stanford?
No more abuse
One look at the front page of the Daily
Kent Stater will tell you that the party's
over for those students in Kent, Ohio who
expect to get something for nothing. It
appears that the Student Center Food
Service has had its fill of students who

bring their own instant coffee and tea
bags to the Student Center Cafeteria, buy
the hot water and cups for five cents and
make their own beverage. "We had to
stop some people from abusing the situ
ation," said Ron Perkins, assistant director
for Student Center Food Service. And,
stop them they did, by draining the
source. Students must now pay 30 cents
fora cup of water. Frank Gaertner, direc
tor of students services for Kent Interhall
Council, said, "It was a fair thing to do. It
takes a lot of gall for some people to do
what they were doing. They wouldn't do
that in any other restaurant, so why do it
here?" Is this the same university where,
merely a decade ago, students' concerns
centered on national and international
political and moral issues?
Search the world over
The University of Pennsylvania is prid
ing itself on its ability to attract students
from the most remote corners of the
earth, with its International Admissions
program. Listen to this one from The Daily
Pennsylvanian: Before January of 1979 ad
missions recruiters in charge of California
were also responsible for the rest of the
world, according to International Ad
missions Director Dan Lundquist. After
that year, a separate office was created
and a foreign application form was de
veloped. Lundquist said that about 450
applications were processed last year and
the office is expecting 500 this year. Only
10 to 12 percent are admitted to the uni
versity each year and only about half of
those eventually matriculate. The biggest
barrier to admission is the cost, according

to Penn administrators, lundquist said he
hopes to travel to Europe next October to
establish "personal formal contacts with
the best schools in the world. We want to
increase the quality and the yield — not
the numbers," he said.
Cancerous classroom?
Going to class at Smith Hall at Rutgers
University in Newark, N. j. may be hazard*
ous to students' health, according to a re
port by the National Institute of Occupa
tional Safety and Health. Smith Hall, the
campus' largest classroom, was closed last
month in response to a federal study that
found airborne traces of an estrogen-type
hormone known to cause cancer in labo
ratory animals. The hormone, estradiol
benzoate, was used in the top-floor labs
of the Institute of Animal Behavior for ex
periments to control the ovulation cycles
of lab mice and guinea pigs. Rutgers Pres
ident Edward Blaustein closed Smith Hall
after receiving the report that levels of
estradiol benzoate hormone found in
classrooms were higher than the ac
cepted industrial standard. Last October,
the state Health Department completed
at $100,000 study that showed a "signifi
cant excess" of cancer among the build
ing's occupants. The cause, however,
could not be linked to Smith Hall. Seven
teen people have filed suits or workmen's
compensation claims for diseases they say
were contracted at Smith Hall. The 14-
year-old building will remain closed until
definitive conclusions can be reached
from tests results.

can often produce a domino effect. A
year before the code went into effect,
fewer than six people were suspended,
said Pavel. Since then, however, the
number has increased with each semes
ter; "Once you break the ice and start sus
pending first offenders, other panels be
come less timid and will do it also," he
said.
Under the original student code, most
students caught cheating were auto
matically failed from the class and barred
from participating in all campus extracur
ricular activities. According to the new
code, adopted in January 1980, students
face a possible expulsion from the univer
sity and, as before, may see the act per
manently recorded on their academic
transcripts. Marilyn Berman, assistant en
gineering dean, said, "There isn't more
cheating; it's just being reported more."
Pavels said he thinks the stricter policies
will result in less cheating.
Changing lanes
The bicycle "experiment" designed to
promote safety for cyclists and pedestri
ans at the University of Oregon in Eugene
is currently being reviewed, according to

the Oregon Daily tmerald. The experi
ment began last fall when the university
passed a law restricting cyclists to "desig
nated bicycle routes and on streets gener
ally available to vehicular traffic" be
tween 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., weekdays.
Small traffic signs have been posted along
bicycle routes. The Emerald reports that
so far the restrictions haven't been
backed by formal enforcement. When
the campus planning committee pro
posed the "experiment," it said it hoped
that the regulations would be "largely
self-enforcing in that bicyclists will find
designated routes safer and more open
and that pedestrians will gently but firmly
call attention to bikers who have strayed
from the bike routes." Now the commit
tee is asking for student and faculty opin
ion concerning the cyclists prohibition
from sidewalks. Prof. Ron Sheriffs said he
had originally wanted a much tougher
proposal than that which was passed.
"There was a hazard," he said, because
"the cyclists were like so many sharks.
We've had more than our share of stu
dents and faculty being bumped by
bikes." Sheriffs said he is satisfied with the
current proposal which allows bicyclists
to reach "virtually every building on cam
pus." Are designated bike paths the an
swer to campus congestion at Stanford?
No more abuse
One look at the front page of the Daily
Kent Stater will tell you that the party's
over for those students in Kent, Ohio who
expect to get something for nothing. It
appears that the Student Center Food
Service has had its fill of students who

bring their own instant coffee and tea
bags to the Student Center Cafeteria, buy
the hot water and cups for five cents and
make their own beverage. "We had to
stop some people from abusing the situ
ation," said Ron Perkins, assistant director
for Student Center Food Service. And,
stop them they did, by draining the
source. Students must now pay 30 cents
fora cup of water. Frank Gaertner, direc
tor of students services for Kent Interhall
Council, said, "It was a fair thing to do. It
takes a lot of gall for some people to do
what they were doing. They wouldn't do
that in any other restaurant, so why do it
here?" Is this the same university where,
merely a decade ago, students' concerns
centered on national and international
political and moral issues?

The University of Pennsylvania is prid

from the most remote corners of the
earth, with its International Admissions
program. Listen to this one from The Daily
Pennsylvanian: Before January of 1979 ad
missions recruiters in charge of California
were also responsible for the rest of the
world, according to International Ad
missions Director Dan Lundquist. After
that year, a separate office was created
and a foreign application form was de
veloped. Lundquist said that about 450
applications were processed last year and
the office is expecting 500 this year. Only
10 to 12 percent are admitted to the uni
versity each year and only about half of
those eventually matriculate. The biggest
barrier to admission is the cost, according

to Penn administrators, lundquist said he
hopes to travel to Europe next October to
establish "personal formal contacts with
the best schools in the world. We want to
increase the quality and the yield — not
the numbers," he said.
Cancerous classroom?
Going to class at Smith Hall at Rutgers
University in Newark, N. j. may be hazard*
ous to students' health, according to a re
port by the National Institute of Occupa
tional Safety and Health. Smith Hall, the
campus' largest classroom, was closed last
month in response to a federal study that
found airborne traces of an estrogen-type
hormone known to cause cancer in labo
ratory animals. The hormone, estradiol
benzoate, was used in the top-floor labs
of the Institute of Animal Behavior for ex
periments to control the ovulation cycles
of lab mice and guinea pigs. Rutgers Pres
ident Edward Blaustein closed Smith Hall
after receiving the report that levels of
estradiol benzoate hormone found in
classrooms were higher than the ac
cepted industrial standard. Last October,
the state Health Department completed
at $100,000 study that showed a "signifi
cant excess" of cancer among the build
ing's occupants. The cause, however,
could not be linked to Smith Hall. Seven
teen people have filed suits or workmen's
compensation claims for diseases they say
were contracted at Smith Hall. The 14-
year-old building will remain closed until
definitive conclusions can be reached
from tests results.

Backpack injuries
Doctors have found that students who
wear their backpacks incorrectly may
have problems ranging from severe mus
cle pain to sway-back, according to The
University Daily Kansan. Martin
Wollman, director of Student Health Ser
vices there, said that overstuffed
backpacks, in particular, could cause
physical problems. Jean Hiebert, super
visor of physical therapy at Watkins Me
morial Hospital, said students could ex
perience spasms in the upper back or
shoulder area and muscle strain in the
lower back if they wore packs improperly.
She cited the large number of students
who wear backpacks slung over one
shoulder, which causes the weight of the
pack to be unevently distributed. A local
store owner told The Daily Kansan that
backpacks should be worn high on the
back and snug — so that the main body of
the pack is between the shoulders. He
said backpacks that hung away from the
back could cause continuous pressure on
the shoulders, and students whose
backpacks are too low on the back or too
heavy could get sway-back. Take heed,
Stanford, and if the backpack fits,..

call attention to bikers who have strayed
from the bike routes." Now the commit
tee is asking for student and faculty opin
ion concerning the cyclists prohibition
from sidewalks. Prof. Ron Sheriffs said he
had originally wanted a much tougher
proposal than that which was passed.
"There was a hazard," he said, because
"the cyclists were like so many sharks.
We've had more than our share of stu
dents and faculty being bumped by
bikes." Sheriffs said he is satisfied with the
current proposal which allows bicyclists
to reach "virtually every building on cam
pus." Are designated bike paths the an
swer to campus congestion at Stanford?
No more abuse
One look at the front page of the Daily
Kent Stater will tell you that the party's
over for those students in Kent, Ohio who
expect to get something for nothing. It
appears that the Student Center Food
Service has had its fill of students who

bring their own instant coffee and tea
bags to the Student Center Cafeteria, buy
the hot water and cups for five cents and
make their own beverage. "We had to
stop some people from abusing the situ
ation," said Ron Perkins, assistant director
for Student Center Food Service. And,
stop them they did, by draining the
source. Students must now pay 30 cents
fora cup of water. Frank Gaertner, direc
tor of students services for Kent Interhall
Council, said, "It was a fair thing to do. It
takes a lot of gall for some people to do
what they were doing. They wouldn't do
that in any other restaurant, so why do it
here?" Is this the same university where,
merely a decade ago, students' concerns
centered on national and international
political and moral issues?
Search the world over
The University of Pennsylvania is prid
ing itself on its ability to attract students
from the most remote corners of the
earth, with its International Admissions
program. Listen to this one from The Daily
Pennsylvanian: Before January of 1979 ad
missions recruiters in charge of California
were also responsible for the rest of the
world, according to International Ad
missions Director Dan Lundquist. After
that year, a separate office was created
and a foreign application form was de
veloped. Lundquist said that about 450
applications were processed last year and
the office is expecting 500 this year. Only
10 to 12 percent are admitted to the uni
versity each year and only about half of
those eventually matriculate. The biggest
barrier to admission is the cost, according

to Penn administrators, lundquist said he
hopes to travel to Europe next October to
establish "personal formal contacts with
the best schools in the world. We want to
increase the quality and the yield — not
the numbers," he said.
Cancerous classroom?
Going to class at Smith Hall at Rutgers
University in Newark, N. j. may be hazard*
ous to students' health, according to a re
port by the National Institute of Occupa
tional Safety and Health. Smith Hall, the
campus' largest classroom, was closed last
month in response to a federal study that
found airborne traces of an estrogen-type
hormone known to cause cancer in labo
ratory animals. The hormone, estradiol
benzoate, was used in the top-floor labs
of the Institute of Animal Behavior for ex
periments to control the ovulation cycles
of lab mice and guinea pigs. Rutgers Pres
ident Edward Blaustein closed Smith Hall
after receiving the report that levels of
estradiol benzoate hormone found in
classrooms were higher than the ac
cepted industrial standard. Last October,
the state Health Department completed
at $100,000 study that showed a "signifi
cant excess" of cancer among the build
ing's occupants. The cause, however,
could not be linked to Smith Hall. Seven
teen people have filed suits or workmen's
compensation claims for diseases they say
were contracted at Smith Hall. The 14-
year-old building will remain closed until
definitive conclusions can be reached
from tests results.
