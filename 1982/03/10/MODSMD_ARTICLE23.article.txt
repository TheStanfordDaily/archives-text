## Crossroadsspeakerscriticize Reagan's "New Federalism" 
### Susan McCarthy 
Opposition to Reagan adminis
tration policies is the catalyst for in
creased political activism on the Left,
according to speakers at last week
end's "Students at the Crossroads"
conference here.
The conference, billed as a
"progressive student conference
dedicated to networking and fight
ing racism," featured speakers I.F.
Stone, longtime independent jour
nalist and activist; Deirdre English,
editor of Mother Jones magazine;
and Rev. Hubert Daughtry, minister
of the House of the Lord Church in
New York City. The conference was
organized by the California Students
United Network (CaISUN) and the
Stanford Progressive Alliance (SPA).
The conference was attended by
students from as far away as Hum
boldt State University and UC-San
Diego. Students from more than a
dozen other schools, including Palo
Alto High School, UC-Santa Cruz,
UC-Berkeley and Foothill College,
also attended all or part of the con
ference.
There were also panels on Third
World people in the United States,
the arms race, the draft, women's
equality and budget cuts in educa
tion. Sunday's speaker, Deirdre Eng
lish, was followed by caucus meet
ings of Third World students, a
CaISUN caucus and several meetings
on El Salvador, the draft and the anti
nuclear movement.

Hubert Daughtry
The Rev. Hubert Daughtry, min
ister of the House of the Lord church
in New York City, told participants
Saturday at the conference that he
has seen "a kind of spontaneous
combustion" across the country of
progressive student groups like
CaISUN.
He also criticized the Reagan ad
ministration for its failure to con
demn the invasion of Angola and its
belligerent Caribbean policy. Local
ly, Daughtry urged students to sup
port the incorporation of East Palo
Alto.
I.F. Stone
I.F. Stone, independent journalist,
former publisher of the I.F. Stone
Weekly and activist for more than
three decades, spoke next. Like
Daughtry, he devoted most of his
speech to criticism of the Reagan ad
ministration.
Stone characterized the Reagan
administration as "a certain section
of the super-rich . . . which is really
the stupidest section of all." Al
though the world is more com
plicated than ever, "we have the
most simple-minded administration
ever," Stone said.
Stone claimed that the military
itself is beginning to oppose the ad
ministration's defense and budget

priorities, quoting the March 1 edi
tion of Army Times as editorializing,
"The defense budget is not only large
but indiscriminate . . . Priorities must
be set. The administration has failed
to do this." Stone said the editorial
went on to call fora more realistic
foreign policy, one which does not
insist on the need to gear up for war
in every jungle desert or mountain
range around the world.
Stone urged students to avoid
murderously simple solutions, and to
study hard while in school.
Deirdre English
Deirdre English, an activist since
the 1960s and currently the editor of
Mother Jones magazine, stressed the
comparison between student move
ments of the '60s and '80s. "I feel like
I'm bringing you greetings from the
'605," she said.
Speaking of the student movement
of the '60s, she said, "It changed my
life â€” in fact it became my life,"
transforming her from someone who
never even read the papers to a full
time activist.
However, she said, in the '60s stu
dents organized only after the fact,
and she considers networks like the
conference a much better way to
proceed.
