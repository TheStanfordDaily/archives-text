The tradition continues...
After rigorous tryouts in front of the band and invited guests, the five new Stanford Dollies were
chosen this past Sunday. They are (left to right): Melinaa Myers (Sunnyvale, CA), Betsy de Palma
(Milwaukee, Wl), Sue Cameron (Portland, OR), Gina Moreno (Los Angeles, CA), and Diana Dobbs
(Kirkland, WA). All of the girls are freshmen and Melinda, Betsy, Sue, and Gina are roommates in
Branner.
