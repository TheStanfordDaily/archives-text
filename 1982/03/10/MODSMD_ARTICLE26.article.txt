# The 						urban plunge
## Experiencing poverty firsthand 
### Diane Johnson 
For one weekend last month five stu
dents here moved to the ghettos of San
Francisco. There fora short while they
were able to witness the life of the
homeless and the poverty-stricken.
These students are all part of a class
called Urban Plunge. Urban Plunge is an
effort of sophomore John Affeldt to ex
amine poverty in America. This quarter,
Affeldt offered the course through SCIRE
to five students and because of its success,
it will be offered through SWOPSI as a
three-unit class this spring.
"I intend to spend tny life attempting to
alleviate the problems society has
created," said Affeldt. "Poverty isonesuch
problem, but before we can do anything to
alleviate it, we have to find out more about
it. That's what this class is supposed to do,"
he said.
Affeldt described the course as one
which examines the institutionalization of
poverty in America through the social
structure, the attitudes of individuals of all
classes, and the economic and political
structure. It focuses on the Catholic
Church's stance on the issue, although the
course requires no religious affiliation.
The class also examines avenues for effect
ing change in these current structures.
Affeldt patterned tJie course after an Ur
ban Plunge program his sister pat ticipated
in at Notre Dame University. The main dif
ference, he said, is that Notre Dame's pro
gram concentrates on the experimental
aspect (the weekend field trip), while Stan
ford's includes an academic dimension,
(weekly readings, lectures and dis
cussions.)
"Our goal is to become more familiar
with the problems of the poor," said Af
feldt. "We must realize the complexity of
poverty. We certainly don't know all the
answers and we don't know all the prob
lems, but we're on the road to learning
more about them."
Urban Plunge met weekly this quarter to
listen to lectures and discuss readings on
poverty. The field ti ip was a culmination of
their learning, but was certainly not the

sole part of the experience, according to
Affeldt. " J he weeks we spent in class read
ing and discussing issues were just asmuch
a part of the total experience," he said.
Affeldt, along with Catherine Beck, Bob
Burns, Chris Knepper and Robin Le
counte, headed into San Francisco early on
a Friday morning. They first visited St. An
thony's Soup Kitchen, which provides free
lunches to appoximately 2000 im
poverished people each day. Affeldt re
called his feelings from the first time he ate
at St. Anthony's: "I feel a lot of anger at so
ciety, a lot of shame toward them for their
pungent smell and ragged dress and a lot
of compassion and helplessness when
thinking about ever eliminating the prob
lem," he said.
From here the group went on to visit El
Salvadorean refugees at a house for the
needy. I hey sang songs, played guitar and
laughed together, despite the language
battier.' When you actually visit with peo
ple who have fled from their country, you
realize they're really individuals," said Af
feldt. It's so easy to lose sight of them as hu
man beings — the massacres in El Salvador
became much more real after seeing these
people," he said.
"I would think most people have dis
torted perceptions of what life in a ghetto
is really like. Some people just don't think
about it. But even many of those who do
and are sympathetic toward the poor,
probably (Jo not have the whole picture,"
he said.
"Everything is not sad. They have their
ups as well as downs just like the rest of us.
The problem is that they must spend too
much of their lives grasping for survival
and don't have time to develop and add
quality to their lives," he said.
The group also visited the Tenderloin
Neighborhood Development Co-op
(TNDC) and the North of Market Coali
tion, both of which are working on hous
ing for the poor. Affeldt described the liv
ing situation in an apartment building
which is being renovated for low-cost,
low-income housing:
" 1 he residents of this building together

with the TNDC are renovating their
ranshackle building. One of the resident
workers showed us his room. It was small
and cold. The walls which had lacked
plaster for years displayed their insulation
and allowed rain to drip in. Then he
showed us a model finished room. It was
such a contrast: bright plastered walls,
wall-to-wall carpeting. They're a long way
from completion, but this is evidence that
change can and does happen," Affeldt
said.
The five participants spent the night at
the San Francisco Jesuit Volunteer House
and then spent Saturday in Oakland. They
visited Jubilee West, a center which trains
women for secretarial positions and
focuses on housing re-development. They
also talked with people at the Catholic
Worker House, which provides food and
housing for the needy, and spent time at
"The House" at San Quentin, a center for
visitors of prison inmates.
At each location, the class spoke with
the people running the programs, asking
why they're engaging in these projects,
what their ideas are on poverty elimina
tion and how they perceive the economic
and political welfare structures.
According to Affeldt, the first step in al
leviating poverty is to change the attitudes
of the people in power. "Poverty must be
come an issue again like it was in the '60s.
But we must learn something from the mis
takes of that decade," he said.
By making people aware of lower-class
conditions, changes can be made to bene
fit the poor, Affeldt said. These changes, in
turn, will give the impoverished hope and
faith that the American government can
work for their good. "It will be an issue
again once this wave of conservatism, in
spired by the Reagan administration,
ends," he said. "The poor realize what ef
fect Reagan's tax cuts will have on them —
they're not stupid. What America needs to
do is give the government back tothe peo
ple."
We will probably never wholly eliminate
poverty but we willaccomplish nothing if
we never start."

were able to visit renovation sites during their weekend stay in impoverished areas.
For one weekend last month five stu
dents here moved to the ghettos of San
Francisco. There fora short while they
were able to witness the life of the
homeless and the poverty-stricken.
These students are all part of a class
called Urban Plunge. Urban Plunge is an
effort of sophomore John Affeldt to ex
amine poverty in America. This quarter,
Affeldt offered the course through SCIRE
to five students and because of its success,
it will be offered through SWOPSI as a
three-unit class this spring.
"I intend to spend tny life attempting to
alleviate the problems society has
created," said Affeldt. "Poverty isonesuch
problem, but before we can do anything to
alleviate it, we have to find out more about
it. That's what this class is supposed to do,"
he said.
Affeldt described the course as one
which examines the institutionalization of
poverty in America through the social
structure, the attitudes of individuals of all
classes, and the economic and political
structure. It focuses on the Catholic
Church's stance on the issue, although the
course requires no religious affiliation.
The class also examines avenues for effect
ing change in these current structures.
Affeldt patterned tJie course after an Ur
ban Plunge program his sister pat ticipated
in at Notre Dame University. The main dif
ference, he said, is that Notre Dame's pro
gram concentrates on the experimental
aspect (the weekend field trip), while Stan
ford's includes an academic dimension,
(weekly readings, lectures and dis
cussions.)
"Our goal is to become more familiar
with the problems of the poor," said Af
feldt. "We must realize the complexity of
poverty. We certainly don't know all the
answers and we don't know all the prob
lems, but we're on the road to learning
more about them."
Urban Plunge met weekly this quarter to
listen to lectures and discuss readings on
poverty. The field ti ip was a culmination of
their learning, but was certainly not the

sole part of the experience, according to
Affeldt. " J he weeks we spent in class read
ing and discussing issues were just asmuch
a part of the total experience," he said.
Affeldt, along with Catherine Beck, Bob
Burns, Chris Knepper and Robin Le
counte, headed into San Francisco early on
a Friday morning. They first visited St. An
thony's Soup Kitchen, which provides free
lunches to appoximately 2000 im
poverished people each day. Affeldt re
called his feelings from the first time he ate
at St. Anthony's: "I feel a lot of anger at so
ciety, a lot of shame toward them for their
pungent smell and ragged dress and a lot
of compassion and helplessness when
thinking about ever eliminating the prob
lem," he said.
From here the group went on to visit El
Salvadorean refugees at a house for the
needy. I hey sang songs, played guitar and
laughed together, despite the language
battier.' When you actually visit with peo
ple who have fled from their country, you
realize they're really individuals," said Af
feldt. It's so easy to lose sight of them as hu
man beings — the massacres in El Salvador
became much more real after seeing these
people," he said.
"I would think most people have dis
torted perceptions of what life in a ghetto
is really like. Some people just don't think
about it. But even many of those who do
and are sympathetic toward the poor,
probably (Jo not have the whole picture,"
he said.
"Everything is not sad. They have their
ups as well as downs just like the rest of us.
The problem is that they must spend too
much of their lives grasping for survival
and don't have time to develop and add
quality to their lives," he said.
The group also visited the Tenderloin
Neighborhood Development Co-op
(TNDC) and the North of Market Coali
tion, both of which are working on hous
ing for the poor. Affeldt described the liv
ing situation in an apartment building
which is being renovated for low-cost,
low-income housing:
" 1 he residents of this building together

with the TNDC are renovating their
ranshackle building. One of the resident
workers showed us his room. It was small
and cold. The walls which had lacked
plaster for years displayed their insulation
and allowed rain to drip in. Then he
showed us a model finished room. It was
such a contrast: bright plastered walls,
wall-to-wall carpeting. They're a long way
from completion, but this is evidence that
change can and does happen," Affeldt
said.
The five participants spent the night at
the San Francisco Jesuit Volunteer House
and then spent Saturday in Oakland. They
visited Jubilee West, a center which trains
women for secretarial positions and
focuses on housing re-development. They
also talked with people at the Catholic
Worker House, which provides food and
housing for the needy, and spent time at
"The House" at San Quentin, a center for
visitors of prison inmates.
At each location, the class spoke with
the people running the programs, asking
why they're engaging in these projects,
what their ideas are on poverty elimina
tion and how they perceive the economic
and political welfare structures.
According to Affeldt, the first step in al
leviating poverty is to change the attitudes
of the people in power. "Poverty must be
come an issue again like it was in the '60s.
But we must learn something from the mis
takes of that decade," he said.
By making people aware of lower-class
conditions, changes can be made to bene
fit the poor, Affeldt said. These changes, in
turn, will give the impoverished hope and
faith that the American government can
work for their good. "It will be an issue
again once this wave of conservatism, in
spired by the Reagan administration,
ends," he said. "The poor realize what ef
fect Reagan's tax cuts will have on them —
they're not stupid. What America needs to
do is give the government back tothe peo
ple."
We will probably never wholly eliminate
poverty but we willaccomplish nothing if
we never start."
