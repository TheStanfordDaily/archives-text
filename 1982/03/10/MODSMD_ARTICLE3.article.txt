Mondale calls for policy changes
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale urged Con
gress yesterday to repeal key tax provisions of President Ronald Rea
gan's domestic program, which he called "the most serious economic
mistake in American history."
In a speech to the National Press Club, Mondale said Reagan sent to
Congress "the most misleading budget ever presented by a president."
He predicted that deficits would be far higher than projected by the
president.
On foreign and defense policy, Mondale said the president has pro
posed "a defense budget without a strategy." He said the adminis
tration has "shown disdain for the nuclear peril" and added that "I
wholeheartedly endorse the nuclear freeze initiative and urge all those
who have an opportunity to support it to do so."
The former vice president, regarded as the early front-runner for the
1984 Democratic presidential nomination, said the possible sale of
fighter planes and missiles to Jordan "dangerously escalates the arms
race, as well as threatens our allies."
He also urged Reagan "to join our allies in the search fora negotiated
settlement in El Salvador."
Mondale's speech resembled a campaign platform in its wide range,
but when the question was raised about 1984, he said he would not
make up his mind until next year.
"We don't have until 1984 to change these policies," he said of the
Reagan program.
US releases El Salvador intelligence
Washington — Two high U.S. intelligence officials made recon
naissance photographs public yesterday in support of Reagan adminis
tration allegations that Nicaragua has engaged in a major military
buildup that threatens its Central American neighbors.
John Hughes, deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
said the Nicaraguan buildup, which has been assisted by the Soviet
Union and Cuba, far exceeds anything Nicaragua needs for its own de-

fenses.
