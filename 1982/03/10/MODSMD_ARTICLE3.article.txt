Mondale calls for policy changes
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale urged Con
gress yesterday to repeal key tax provisions of President Ronald Rea
gan's domestic program, which he called "the most serious economic
mistake in American history."
In a speech to the National Press Club, Mondale said Reagan sent to
Congress "the most misleading budget ever presented by a president."
He predicted that deficits would be far higher than projected by the
president.
On foreign and defense policy, Mondale said the president has pro
posed "a defense budget without a strategy." He said the adminis
tration has "shown disdain for the nuclear peril" and added that "I
wholeheartedly endorse the nuclear freeze initiative and urge all those
who have an opportunity to support it to do so."
The former vice president, regarded as the early front-runner for the
1984 Democratic presidential nomination, said the possible sale of
fighter planes and missiles to Jordan "dangerously escalates the arms
race, as well as threatens our allies."
He also urged Reagan "to join our allies in the search fora negotiated
settlement in El Salvador."
Mondale's speech resembled a campaign platform in its wide range,
but when the question was raised about 1984, he said he would not
make up his mind until next year.
"We don't have until 1984 to change these policies," he said of the
Reagan program.
US releases El Salvador intelligence
Washington — Two high U.S. intelligence officials made recon
naissance photographs public yesterday in support of Reagan adminis
tration allegations that Nicaragua has engaged in a major military
buildup that threatens its Central American neighbors.
John Hughes, deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
said the Nicaraguan buildup, which has been assisted by the Soviet
Union and Cuba, far exceeds anything Nicaragua needs for its own de-

fenses.
But the administration left for later in the
week the long-awaited release of evidence it
says will document its accusations that the in
surgency in El Salvador is being directed and
controlled from Nicaragua and Cuba.
Adm. Bobby Inman, deputy director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, told reporters at a
State Department briefing that a Nicaraguan
government official had lied in declaring in
New York last week that the Nicaraguan army is
no larger now than it was under the ousted re
gime of Anastasio Somoza two years ago.
There was nothing essentially new in the in
formation presented by Inman and Hughes,
who Inman said was the "premier" interpreter
of aerial reconnaissance photographs gathered
by the U.S. intelligence community.
Guatemalan opposition loses
Guatemala City — Three civilian candidates,
protesting the apparent victory by Gen. Angel
Guevara in Guatemala's presidential election,
were seized last night as they marched on the
National Palace and taken to police head
quarters. A spokesman said they were freed an
hour later.
They had accused Guevara's military-backed
coalition of widespread fraud in Sunday's
balloting and called fora mass protest rally in
front of the National Palace.
All four presidential candidates belonged to
right-of-center coalitions in the election, which
was boycotted by leftists. Guevara was leading
in the slow vote count with 38 percent and ap
peared in line for the presidency.
Opposition parties withdrew their represent
atives from the vote counting on yesterday,
claiming there was widespread fraud and ma
nipulation in the vote count.
Guevara denied charges of electoral fraud

and said he would not agree to a new election.
"We are not disposed to having a second
election since we already won this one cleanly,"
Guevara said.
US will sell missiles to Israel
Washington — The Pentagon told Congress
on Monday it plans to sell Israel another 200 im
proved Hawk air defense missiles for $47 mil
lion.
Neighboring Jordan also has the Hawks, but
they are on launchers embedded in concrete.
Israel's weapons are on mobile launchers which
enable the Israelis to cover a wider area in pro
tecting their territory from encroaching hostile
aircraft.
The Pentagon announcement said Israel's ac
quisition of the additional 200 improved mis
siles "would not have any appreciable impact
on the balance of forces in the region."
The proposed sale, Congress was told, "is
consistent with the United States policy of
ensuring that Israel has the means to defend
itself within secure borders should it become
necessary."
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has
aroused Israeli ire by proposingthat Jordan, like
Israel, be provided mobile launchers for its
Hawk missile batteries.
Weinberger has said Jordan has not formally
asked for the mobile Hawks, but he has said he
would be willing to go to Congress to discuss a
possible sale of mobile air defense missile bat
teries to the Jordanians "if appropriate. A
Belushi laid to rest
Vineyard Haven, MA — With Dan Aykroyd
riding to the gravesite on a motorcycle and
James Taylor mournfully singing "That Lone
some Road," comedian John Belushi was

buried yesterday on an island off Cape Cod.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles, where Belushi
died last Friday, reports surfaced that his death
,may have been caused by a cocaine overdose.
The 33-year-old Belushi was a star of TV's
"Saturday Night Live".
The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday
that a source in the coroner's office said Belushi
died of complications from a cocaine overdose.
ABC News also reported that sources said a
drug overdose killed him, and said the drug was
"probably cocaine."
The Los Angeles coroner's office declined to
comment on the reports, saying only that the
autopsy and other tests have been inconclusive.
Belushi's nude body was found Friday on a
bed in a $200-a-day bungalow he had rented in
Los Angeles. He was in California to film a com
edy, "Noble Rot."
ABC also said Belushi, a heavy smoker, was
believed to have been suffering from a respira
tory disease.

Mondale calls for policy changes
Washington — Former Vice President Walter Mondale urged Con
gress yesterday to repeal key tax provisions of President Ronald Rea
gan's domestic program, which he called "the most serious economic
mistake in American history."
In a speech to the National Press Club, Mondale said Reagan sent to
Congress "the most misleading budget ever presented by a president."
He predicted that deficits would be far higher than projected by the
president.
On foreign and defense policy, Mondale said the president has pro
posed "a defense budget without a strategy." He said the adminis
tration has "shown disdain for the nuclear peril" and added that "I
wholeheartedly endorse the nuclear freeze initiative and urge all those
who have an opportunity to support it to do so."
The former vice president, regarded as the early front-runner for the
1984 Democratic presidential nomination, said the possible sale of
fighter planes and missiles to Jordan "dangerously escalates the arms
race, as well as threatens our allies."
He also urged Reagan "to join our allies in the search fora negotiated
settlement in El Salvador."
Mondale's speech resembled a campaign platform in its wide range,
but when the question was raised about 1984, he said he would not
make up his mind until next year.
"We don't have until 1984 to change these policies," he said of the
Reagan program.
US releases El Salvador intelligence
Washington — Two high U.S. intelligence officials made recon
naissance photographs public yesterday in support of Reagan adminis
tration allegations that Nicaragua has engaged in a major military
buildup that threatens its Central American neighbors.
John Hughes, deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency,
said the Nicaraguan buildup, which has been assisted by the Soviet
Union and Cuba, far exceeds anything Nicaragua needs for its own de-

fenses.
But the administration left for later in the
week the long-awaited release of evidence it
says will document its accusations that the in
surgency in El Salvador is being directed and
controlled from Nicaragua and Cuba.
Adm. Bobby Inman, deputy director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, told reporters at a
State Department briefing that a Nicaraguan
government official had lied in declaring in
New York last week that the Nicaraguan army is
no larger now than it was under the ousted re
gime of Anastasio Somoza two years ago.
There was nothing essentially new in the in
formation presented by Inman and Hughes,
who Inman said was the "premier" interpreter
of aerial reconnaissance photographs gathered
by the U.S. intelligence community.
Guatemalan opposition loses
Guatemala City — Three civilian candidates,
protesting the apparent victory by Gen. Angel
Guevara in Guatemala's presidential election,
were seized last night as they marched on the
National Palace and taken to police head
quarters. A spokesman said they were freed an
hour later.
They had accused Guevara's military-backed
coalition of widespread fraud in Sunday's
balloting and called fora mass protest rally in
front of the National Palace.
All four presidential candidates belonged to
right-of-center coalitions in the election, which
was boycotted by leftists. Guevara was leading
in the slow vote count with 38 percent and ap
peared in line for the presidency.
Opposition parties withdrew their represent
atives from the vote counting on yesterday,
claiming there was widespread fraud and ma
nipulation in the vote count.
Guevara denied charges of electoral fraud

and said he would not agree to a new election.
"We are not disposed to having a second
election since we already won this one cleanly,"
Guevara said.
US will sell missiles to Israel
Washington — The Pentagon told Congress
on Monday it plans to sell Israel another 200 im
proved Hawk air defense missiles for $47 mil
lion.
Neighboring Jordan also has the Hawks, but
they are on launchers embedded in concrete.
Israel's weapons are on mobile launchers which
enable the Israelis to cover a wider area in pro
tecting their territory from encroaching hostile
aircraft.
The Pentagon announcement said Israel's ac
quisition of the additional 200 improved mis
siles "would not have any appreciable impact
on the balance of forces in the region."
The proposed sale, Congress was told, "is
consistent with the United States policy of
ensuring that Israel has the means to defend
itself within secure borders should it become
necessary."
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger has
aroused Israeli ire by proposingthat Jordan, like
Israel, be provided mobile launchers for its
Hawk missile batteries.
Weinberger has said Jordan has not formally
asked for the mobile Hawks, but he has said he
would be willing to go to Congress to discuss a
possible sale of mobile air defense missile bat
teries to the Jordanians "if appropriate. A
Belushi laid to rest
Vineyard Haven, MA — With Dan Aykroyd
riding to the gravesite on a motorcycle and
James Taylor mournfully singing "That Lone
some Road," comedian John Belushi was

buried yesterday on an island off Cape Cod.
Meanwhile in Los Angeles, where Belushi
died last Friday, reports surfaced that his death
,may have been caused by a cocaine overdose.
The 33-year-old Belushi was a star of TV's
"Saturday Night Live".
The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday
that a source in the coroner's office said Belushi
died of complications from a cocaine overdose.
ABC News also reported that sources said a
drug overdose killed him, and said the drug was
"probably cocaine."
The Los Angeles coroner's office declined to
comment on the reports, saying only that the
autopsy and other tests have been inconclusive.
Belushi's nude body was found Friday on a
bed in a $200-a-day bungalow he had rented in
Los Angeles. He was in California to film a com
edy, "Noble Rot."
ABC also said Belushi, a heavy smoker, was
believed to have been suffering from a respira
tory disease.
