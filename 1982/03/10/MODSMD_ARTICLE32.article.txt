## Disgruntled profs publish themselves 
### Jiri Weiss 
Because of the rising cost of textbooks and longer delays
between the time a book is written and published, a group
of three political science professors have gone into the pub
lishing business themselves.
Jan Triska and Nobutaka Ike established the Notrik Press
in 1979. The name "Notrik" is a derivation of the names of
the authors of the only Notrik volume to date The World of
Superpowers, by Robert North, Triska and Ike.
"All of us have had experience in publishing with many
dissapointments," said Triska.
"Often books take six, seven,even eight years to publish
from the time a publisher approaches you," Triska con
tinued, "by that time publishers change hands.. . besides
books are getting more and more expensive."
But perhaps the major reason why Triska and Ike chose to
set up their own press is that they have complete editorial
control.
A political science book becomes outdated very quickly
— world events do not meet publisher deadlines — but
publishers are reluctant to print revised editions, Triska
said.
The World of Superpowers is a tabloid printed on book
quality paper with no cover which makes it look more like a

large newsprint magazine than its clothbound or even pa
perback relatives.
Despite its unusual appearance it is, at $4.95, a bargain
compared with the the $20 or $30 books students are often
asked to buy.
Publishing at Notrik press is literally "a shoestring cottage
industry," Triska said — Triska and Ike put in $2500 each and
printed a first edition of 2000 copies.
The book was written, edited, pasted up, proofread,
typeset and is now being distributed entirely by the pub
lishers.
The long and arduous process of layout and paste-up was
done by Ike and his wife at their dining room table.
Notrik press has no budget for promotion, but the au
thors have had the advantage of using their names which
are well known in the field of political science as well as the
fact that The World of Superpowers will be used for their
course of the same name this spring.
Triska mailed promotional copies and flyers to his col
eagues around the country.
Each morning Prof. Triska checks the post office mailbox
for orders. Whenever an order comes Triska packs the
tabloid copies into boxes and sends them off. Ike's garage is
used for storage.
"The response so far," said Ike, "has been dissapointing,
but then again we have been on the market only fora short
time."
Bookstores are not happy with the format, Triska said. At
Kepler's Bookstore in Menlo Park, the book is displayed
among the periodicals, "You pay for innovation," he
added.
As for the reaction of publishers: "Some think it is a good
idea," said Ike, "Other's think it is terrible ...
"After all, if this thing becomes popular their business
would be dramatically undercut."
But Notrik press is more a labor of love then profit. "Fora
professor it is fun to go into business," Triska said, "and
even if we don't make money we have the tax deductions."
