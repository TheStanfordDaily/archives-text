Superlatives in used car ads
and book titles bother me.
They almost always smack of
insincerity and telegraph their
phoniness with all the subtlety
of a 40-pound sledge. Take, for
instance, The Best American
Short Stories 1981.
Okay, I said. Says who?
American and Canadian maga
zine editors, for one, from
whose respective magazines
and literary quarterlies these 20
stories were gleaned. Shannon
Ravenel, for another, the Best
American Short Stories annual
editor who scanned approx
imately 1250 stories published
in 1980. And finally, Hortense
Calisher, this year's guest edi
tor, who hand-picked the
blushing 20 from the 120
finalists handed over by
Ravenel.
The final result? Twenty rec
ognizably North American
short stories of more or less
high literary merit bundled to
gether — alphabetically by last
name of author — under a
common cover and title. But,
"the best"?
I find myself able to defend

the merit of the annual Best
American Short Stories series
mostly on the grounds that the
new short stories aren't ori
ginally published for the mass
market.
A collection such as this may
justifiably be praised for pro
viding, if not "the best," at least
a respectable variety of stories
garnered from a variety of nu
merous literary magazines.
Talking specifics, Robert
Coover's contribution to the
collection "A Working Day," is
a real gem. Coover, one of the
best stylists writing in America,
has written a piece with both
the verve of his earlier stories
and the poker-faced repetition
of a porno movie.
Not unlike Robbe-Grillet's
novella, Jealousy, Coover's "A
Working Day" replays the
same scene again and again,
each time with slight mod
ifications. It works its way inch
by inch over the patterns of an
employer/employee rela
tionship.
Along the way the story re
veals something about the par
adoxes in the sadomasochistic
master/slave relationship em
bedded in the working world.
Coover is undeniably subtle.
He changes minor details in the
scenario which innevitably
ends with the employer beat
ing the hopelessly careless

maid — with either his belt, a
birch rod, a whip, a cane, a cat
o'-nine-tails, or a hairbrush —
the instrument determined by
the seriousness of her trans
gression.
As in a skin flick, the antici
pation of the final act becomes
tantamount to the act of whip
ping itself. Coover charges the
narrative throughout with a vir
tuosity of punning and playing
with words, creating real peo
ple in a surreal world.
Many other styles of writing
are represented in this collec
tion, from writers as different
as John Updike and Cynthia
Ozick to Walter Abish and Vin
cent Dethier.
The only piece I would ques
tion in the collection is
"Shiloh," a Southern-fried
storv bv Bobbie Mason.
Admittedly, Mason's task is a
difficult one; she has tried to
write a Southern story a la Flan
nery O'Connor, but has floun
dered along the way under a
mish-mash of Southern dialect
and manners.
"Shiloh" wants to be a story
about the small-town pathos in
the lives of a truck driver, Leroy
Moffit, and his wife, Norma
Jean.
All the ingredients of South
ern hillbilly lifestyle are thrown
in for good measure: a nagging
mother-in-law named Mabel
— naturally, plenty of "well, I
reckon"sand "like heck"s, a
little fried chicken and picnic
ham for dinner, and a little con
traband grass to smoke after
wards.
