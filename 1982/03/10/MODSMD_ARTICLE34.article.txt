Denise Levertov is here. And
so is her newest collection of
stories, essays and talks on
poetry, artistry, political ac
tivism — and the experience of
being alive in the 20th century.
She has been a visiting poet
in the Creative Writing Pro
gram this winter and she will
be migrating west from her
home in Boston every winter
quarter.
In her first collection of
prose since the appearance of
The Poet in the World (New
Directions) in 1973, Levertov
divides the book into six cate
gories: Three Stories, The Na
ture of Poetry, Poetry and Poli
tics, Political Commentary,
Memoirs and Other Writers.
Yet, there is no true division
between these subjects.
The title, Light up the Cave,
comes from a line of Anne Sex
ton's poetry to which Levertov
pays tribute in an essay written
a few weeks after Sexton's sui
cide in 1974:
Depression is boring, I think
and I would do better to make
some soup and light up the
cave.
In this essay, Levertov pro-*
tests the tendency of our cul

ture to romanticize the alien
ation of the artist which, in this
case, led to suicide. Rather
than fully appreciating the
positive example of artists who
don't die tragically and who
lead or have led long and pro
ductive lives, we tend to identi
fy unhappinfess with the
creative impulse.
She writes that our society
"romanticizes gifted individ
uals who have been distorted
into an alienated individ
ualism, a self-preoccupation,
that is not idividuation, not
maturation. . .To identify (Sex
ton's) love of death with her
love of poetry is to insult that
struggle (against her desire for
death)."
Levertov told me that she re
ceived many letters after this
essay was originally published,
most of which praised her for
"saying something which really
needed to be said."
Why, then, Levertov won
dered aloud, wasn't it said even
sooner? What do we have to
lose by no longer celebrating
the alienation of the artist?
Levertov writes, "the artist, the
poet.. .needs the stamina of an
astronaut and the energy de
rived only with being passion
ately in love with life and art."
The artist's love of life can be
especially well communicated

— although not exclusively —
in political poetry. Levertov
clarified the question often
asked, "can political poetry be
good poetry?" in"The Nature
of Poetry" and in other essays
in this collection.
In"The Nature of Poetry,"
she writes:
"The didactic has a place in
poetry, but only when it is in
separable from the intuitive —
e.g., opinion is not a source of
poetry, but the poetry of politi
cal anguish is at its best both
didactic and lyrical.
"In our time, a political
poetry untinged with anguish,
even when it evokes and
salutes moments of hope, is un
imaginable.
"Yet — because it creates au
tonomous structures that im
bued with life and which stir
the life of those who ex
perience them — poetry is, in
process and in being, in
trinsically affirmative."
Her longer essay, "On the
Edge of Darkness: What is Polit
ical Poetry?," is an erudite,

thouroughly readable re
assurance that there is "a tradi
tion for politcal poems, the
poetry of social criticism." She
notes that "the suspicion with
which political or social com
ment is often regarded is a
modern phenomenon and
arises from a mistaken idea of
the poem as always a private
expression of emotion which
the reader is permitted to over
hear."
Levertov's politics are
founded upon an anti-war,
anti-imperialistic, anti-nuclear
stance. She spoke out
vehemently against the Viet
nam War and is presently very
involved in the anti-nuclear
movement.
"What frightens me about
many young people is their
view of history," she said.
"They seem to see it as a
big pot in which famous events
are floating on the surface.
'Those are the Napoleonic
Wars over there; that's Viet
nam; that World War II over by
the edge of the pot.' It's all

equally distant and seemingly
unconnected to their own
lives."
In an address to the Com
mission on the Environment
and Energy at the World Peace
Parliament in Sofia, Bulgaria on
Sept. 24,1980, and another ad
dress to the International
Meeting of Writers four days
later in Sofia — both reprinted
in Light up the Cave —
Levertov declared herself
against three forms of war: lit
eral military war, the war on
human potential and the war
against natural resources and
our own genetic future.
"The truth is that as a species
we have made some very bad
mistakes," she told the con
ference. "These mistakes,
which have accelerated
enormously in the 20th cen
tury, have ancient roots in the
anthopocentric view of Man as
the natural ruler of the world,
whose 'manifest destiny' is to
'conquer Nature.' "
She likens those aspects of
20th century technology which

are "not ultimately life-enhan
cing but destructive" (i.e., nu
clear power) to an "addiction
to heroin."
To the writers she said, "we
must recognize again that the
Earth is our Mother. If poets
cannot understand this, who
will? . . . We must bring our
poet's imagination and our gift
of language to bring these re
alizations to others."

There is much, much more in
this book, including, in the
tradition of "Some Notes on
Organic Form" from The Poet
in the World, some of the
clearest notes on poetry as an
art form and on how to read
poetry that I have ever dis
covered. Discover, or continue
to discover, Denise Levertov
for yourself.
