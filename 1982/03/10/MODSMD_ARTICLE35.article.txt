# 'Sequoia' emphasizes art and grows past confines of literary magazine
## 
### Denny Dart 
Until this year Sequoia was
just Stanford's literary maga
zine with all art consigned to
the cover or squeezed into
margins. This year, Sequoia has
decided to give art a full third
of the space in the magazine.
The new emphasis on art is a
contribution Margaret Ward,
Sequoia's editor, has made
since she took over the finan
cially troubled literary maga
zine in January.
The second issue, which
comes out during finals week,
has prints of monotypes done
by Nathan Olivera, an artist at
Stanford; four photographic
portraits by Margo Davis of The
Center for Research on Wom
en; and more Japan photo
graphs by John Nordell, a stu
dent here.

To get the best possible re
productions of all of the
monotypes and photographs,
Sequoia is using high resolu
tion printing on glossy paper.
Olivera's monotypes, all
black and white, are compa
nion pieces to a series now on
show at the Metropolitan in
New York. Olivera made these
monotypes — two on construc
tion sites and two of rather
mysterious figures — by apply
ing ink to a metal plate some
times with a brush, sometimes
with his hand and then making
one single print from the plate.
Olivera's prints are so subtle
and intimate that Sequoia is
taking a risk in reproducing
them; the magic of these prints
could be completely lost in
translation. On the other hand,
it may be that the best way to

see a monotype is in an ex
quisite print which you can
hold on your lap. In a museum
the glass and velvet barriers do
not allow you to see the prints,
which are as small and intricate
as etchings.
Margo Davis has done four
photographic portraits. They
were taken in different parts of
the world, years apart, of men
who never knew each other,
and yet they are connected
companion pieces — a perfect
series of four.
The portraits stand beau
tifully without explanation but
Davis has written a story to go
with them which is a great mis
take — as is the fact that she
dedicates the story to her
father.
The story is about how she
convinced Saul Bellow to sit for

a portrait. Davis sneaked sever
al of her photographs into the
guest room where Saul Bellow
stayed when he visited Stan
ford. Saul Bellow was im
pressed and agreed to have his
portrait taken — insisting that
she let him wear a hat like the
two men whose portraits were
hanging on the wall. The story
includes a rather pretentious
fictional account of a conversa
tion between the men in the
portraits.
Davis doesn't need to tell us
that all of the men are wearing
hats, in fact she ruins the sur
prise because you don't notice
the hats immediately. I
couldn't decide whether the
portraits illustrate the story or
the story explains the portraits.
It doesn't complement her
photographs: the story only

competes with them for im
portance.
Davis' portrait of C.L.R.
James, the moststunningofthe
four printed in the issue, has
been further insulted by the
Sequoia staff. In an attempt to
design the magazine, they
placed it opposite a nothing
special photograph of pampas
grass in a jar by a coffee table.
Both photographs have an af
ternoon feeling, and the pam
pas grass is the same texture as
Jones' straw hat. I guess the
staff thought that the two
photos would "go together"
well.
Sequoia would have been
better off foregoing the pam
pas grass and coffee table.
In fact, there are quite a few
photographs in the Spring is
sue that Sequoia didn't need to

include at all. Not that any of
the photographs are bad; some
of them just aren't special like
John Nordell's photos of Japan
and Lianne Klapper's photo of
dead fish in the Winter issue.
For every story published in
Sequoia, fifty are rejected. The
art should be selected with as
much discrimination.
The Spring issue includes
two interviews, one with Diane
Levertov and the other, done
jointly with The Independent,
with Gore Vidal. Both maga
zines published the Vidal in
terview, but each publication
edited it differently: The Inde
pendent kept questions of po
litical interest and Sequoia the
literary questions. The result
reads like two different in
terviews.
To someone unfamiliar with
Levertov's poetry, the Levertov
interview at times makes dif
ficult reading. The interviewer,
Margaret War, spent a month
and-a-half reading Levertov
poetry closely, and the re
sult is something of an inside
conversation with questions
focusing on specific poems,
even specific images.
Such down-to-details ques
tions aren't inappropriate. se
quoia is a literary magazine af
ter all, but Sequoia should have
included the poems or frag

ments of poems discussed.
A similar interview with N.
Scott Momaday in Sequoia's
winter issue was done just in
this way. With passages of
Momaday's work included, the
Momaday interview reads very
smoothly.
Sequoia is not a publication
for student work; most of the
writers have been already pub
lished — the table of contents
often lists several well known
names.
Similarly, distribution is not
limited to Stanford. As many as
2000 copies of an issue have
been sold on the East coast. But
amidst the well-known names,
Sequoia includes a few pieces
by Stanford students.
Some of the best pieces in
the Spring issue, in fact, are by
students. Elizabeth Richard's
story "Summer People" is as
dry as any J.D. Sallinger story
with subtle details rather than
resounding conclusions.
By tradition, the best poem is
printed closest to the front of
the magazine. The Spring issue
honors in this way "Harle
quinade," by Graham Leggat, a
sophomore here. This poem
has a cocky rhythm and dialect
which maked you want to read
it aloud over and over. I read it
four or five times, and it was
humorous every time.

show at the Metropolitan in
New York. Olivera made these
monotypes — two on construc
tion sites and two of rather
mysterious figures — by apply
ing ink to a metal plate some
times with a brush, sometimes
with his hand and then making
one single print from the plate.
Olivera's prints are so subtle
and intimate that Sequoia is
taking a risk in reproducing
them; the magic of these prints
could be completely lost in
translation. On the other hand,
it may be that the best way to

see a monotype is in an ex
quisite print which you can
hold on your lap. In a museum
the glass and velvet barriers do
not allow you to see the prints,
which are as small and intricate
as etchings.
Margo Davis has done four
photographic portraits. They
were taken in different parts of
the world, years apart, of men
who never knew each other,
and yet they are connected
companion pieces — a perfect
series of four.
The portraits stand beau
tifully without explanation but
Davis has written a story to go
with them which is a great mis
take — as is the fact that she
dedicates the story to her
father.
The story is about how she
convinced Saul Bellow to sit for

a portrait. Davis sneaked sever
al of her photographs into the
guest room where Saul Bellow
stayed when he visited Stan
ford. Saul Bellow was im
pressed and agreed to have his
portrait taken — insisting that
she let him wear a hat like the
two men whose portraits were
hanging on the wall. The story
includes a rather pretentious
fictional account of a conversa
tion between the men in the
portraits.
Davis doesn't need to tell us
that all of the men are wearing
hats, in fact she ruins the sur
prise because you don't notice
the hats immediately. I
couldn't decide whether the
portraits illustrate the story or
the story explains the portraits.
It doesn't complement her
photographs: the story only

competes with them for im
portance.
Davis' portrait of C.L.R.
James, the moststunningofthe
four printed in the issue, has
been further insulted by the
Sequoia staff. In an attempt to
design the magazine, they
placed it opposite a nothing
special photograph of pampas
grass in a jar by a coffee table.
Both photographs have an af
ternoon feeling, and the pam
pas grass is the same texture as
Jones' straw hat. I guess the
staff thought that the two
photos would "go together"
well.
Sequoia would have been
better off foregoing the pam
pas grass and coffee table.
In fact, there are quite a few
photographs in the Spring is
sue that Sequoia didn't need to

include at all. Not that any of
the photographs are bad; some
of them just aren't special like
John Nordell's photos of Japan
and Lianne Klapper's photo of
dead fish in the Winter issue.
For every story published in
Sequoia, fifty are rejected. The
art should be selected with as
much discrimination.
The Spring issue includes
two interviews, one with Diane
Levertov and the other, done
jointly with The Independent,
with Gore Vidal. Both maga
zines published the Vidal in
terview, but each publication
edited it differently: The Inde
pendent kept questions of po
litical interest and Sequoia the
literary questions. The result
reads like two different in
terviews.
To someone unfamiliar with
Levertov's poetry, the Levertov
interview at times makes dif
ficult reading. The interviewer,
Margaret War, spent a month
and-a-half reading Levertov
poetry closely, and the re
sult is something of an inside
conversation with questions
focusing on specific poems,
even specific images.
Such down-to-details ques
tions aren't inappropriate. se
quoia is a literary magazine af
ter all, but Sequoia should have
included the poems or frag

ments of poems discussed.
A similar interview with N.
Scott Momaday in Sequoia's
winter issue was done just in
this way. With passages of
Momaday's work included, the
Momaday interview reads very
smoothly.
Sequoia is not a publication
for student work; most of the
writers have been already pub
lished — the table of contents
often lists several well known
names.
Similarly, distribution is not
limited to Stanford. As many as
2000 copies of an issue have
been sold on the East coast. But
amidst the well-known names,
Sequoia includes a few pieces
by Stanford students.
Some of the best pieces in
the Spring issue, in fact, are by
students. Elizabeth Richard's
story "Summer People" is as
dry as any J.D. Sallinger story
with subtle details rather than
resounding conclusions.
By tradition, the best poem is
printed closest to the front of
the magazine. The Spring issue
honors in this way "Harle
quinade," by Graham Leggat, a
sophomore here. This poem
has a cocky rhythm and dialect
which maked you want to read
it aloud over and over. I read it
four or five times, and it was
humorous every time.
Until this year Sequoia was
just Stanford's literary maga
zine with all art consigned to
the cover or squeezed into
margins. This year, Sequoia has
decided to give art a full third
of the space in the magazine.
The new emphasis on art is a
contribution Margaret Ward,
Sequoia's editor, has made
since she took over the finan
cially troubled literary maga
zine in January.
The second issue, which
comes out during finals week,
has prints of monotypes done
by Nathan Olivera, an artist at
Stanford; four photographic
portraits by Margo Davis of The
Center for Research on Wom
en; and more Japan photo
graphs by John Nordell, a stu
dent here.

To get the best possible re
productions of all of the
monotypes and photographs,
Sequoia is using high resolu
tion printing on glossy paper.
Olivera's monotypes, all
black and white, are compa
nion pieces to a series now on
show at the Metropolitan in
New York. Olivera made these
monotypes — two on construc
tion sites and two of rather
mysterious figures — by apply
