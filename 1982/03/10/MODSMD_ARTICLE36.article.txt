LA TOUR RESTAURANT
FRANCAIS
525 UNIVERSITY AVE
NUE, PALO ALTO.
321-6954
It is hard to imagine that
one of the Peninsula's finest
restaurants could be located
on the third floor of a rather
unassuming Palo Alto office
building. Yet, from the mo
ment one steps off the
elevator — in which the
number three has been re
place by the words LA
TOUR — it is amazingly easy
to forget that University Av
enue is just a peek away.
La Tour is comfortably
elegant. Fromtheoverhang
ing plants to the high
backed chairs to the tall,
curtained bay windows, the
atmosphere is special.
Our meal began with or

ders of Smoked Quail and
Artichoke with fresh Bay
Shrimp. The Quail was very
tasty, even worth the effort
of extraction and was served
on an excellent bedding of
wild rice and vegetables.
My Saumon en Croute
was delicious: the pastry
was light and flaky, as was
the fish itself and the
Hollandaise Sauce that
came with it was so delicate
as to perfectly complement,
not dominate, the other
flavors. My mentor's Steak
au Poivre was cooked to
perfection and the sauce
which included three dif
ferent types of pepper was
just spicy enough to leave a
pleasant tingle in the
mouth. Both dinners came
with vegetables on the side:
sweet, crispy Snow Peas

with both, Wild Rice with
the Salmon and Gratin
Dauphinois with the Steak.
Dessert was the piece de
resistance: Crepes Suzettes,
prepared in the traditional
way, at the table, with fresh
oranges, sugar, Grand
Marnier and then flambeed
with Cognac.
La Tour is not for the thrif
ty. An average bill for two
will probably hover around
$70 plus service. However,
great occasions merit equal
ly great meals and La Tour is
an ideal place to indulge
yourself, for whatever rea
son. Look at it this way:
since it's located virtually
right down the road, think
of all the money you save on
transportation!
