The tastefully alluring
neon light at the top of the
five-story inverted pyramid
building signalled to us that
we had arrived at La Baie.
Situated just one mile from
San Francisco Airport, La
Baie offers the best in
French haute cuisine and a
glittering panorama of the
city by the bay — definitely a
place for that very special
occasion.
We were greeted by Fran
cois, the maitre d', and were
shown to a table hemmed in
by palm trees. But the in
door landscaping didn't
block the breathtaking view
of the San Francisco lights,
the Bay, and numerous
wide-body jets on their final
descent into the airport
(seen but not heard).
A most intriguing mood
was set inside the restaurant
by sun and moon
projections cast above the
expansive windows. This
gave the diner the feeling of
being out inthesunatnight
ime — an unusual but ex
tremely enchanting decor.

With the contemporary,
tropical ambiance, how
could we help but treat
ourselves to a pina colada
and a fresh strawberry dai
quiri? Both of these helped
put school off in the dis
tance and set us in the right
frame of mind for the suc
culent dishes to follow. (If
this review makes La Baie
sound a bit like heaven, it's
because that's exactly
where we felt we were!)
Enough sipping of those
slushy delights and onto the
meal...
We began with the esca
rgots en croutades, a classic
preparation with garlic but
ter served in a light puff
pastry shell ($5.75). This was
delicious and went very
quickly, but fortunately we
had warm, crispy French
bread on our table to keep
our hunger "at bay" be
tween courses.
At the sugggestion of our
refined yet cordial waiter,
we sampled the potage du
jour (cream of broccoli — at
$2) and the Salade Victoria
($4.50), a finely laid-out as
sortment of avacados, en
dive, tomatoes, mushrooms
and hearts of palm, all
topped with a carefully

blended Dijon mustard
based house dressing.
Just before our main
courses arrived, we
cleansed our palates with a
small serving of orange
sherbet. We're not sure if it
was the sherbet or the chef
who did the trick, but what
ever the case, the entrees
were superb! We ordered
the specials of the evening
— the Beef Wellington and
the Abalone, each accom
panied by cooked carrots,
broccoli and potatoes au
gratin.
Although both selections
were attractive on the plate
and were cooked to per
fection, we would recom
mend the Abalone, a San
Francisco delicacy, over the
beef. Its buttery white wine

sauce was rich, flavorful,
and a perfect complement
to the fish. The $25 price for
each was a bit steep, con
sidering La Baie offers many
fine selections for between
$12 and $16.
To accompany our dinner
we chose a delightful
chablis, only one from a
wine list reported to be
Northern California's sec
ond largest.
We concluded our meal
with the individual souffle
au grand marnier ($5). The
souffle, fresh from the oven
to our table, was light,
golden brown and rich in li
queur flavor — the cul
mination of an evening
meal par excellence.
