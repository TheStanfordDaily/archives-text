La Bourgogne is certainly
not likely to become a regu
lar haunt unless you are
coming into a sizeable in
heritance, but for that ex
travagant occasion, what
ever it may be, you could
not possibly go wrong with
this gastronomic excursion
into San Francisco. Admit
tedly the decor is early San
Franciscan, not classical
French, as one might ex
pect, but it is comfortable,
and any minor aesthetic de
ficiencies are more than
compensated for by the
other attributes of the din
ing experience.
The busboys are very effi
cient and successfully com
plement the very French
service of the senior staff.
With the possible exception
of Lutece in New York, I
cannot remember service
anywhere in Europe or the
United States that has com
bined courtesy and
elegance with such a perfect
degree of intimacy. Jacques,
our waiter, helped create an
ambiance of luxury while at
the same time offering per
sonal suggestions and ad
vice with both meal and
wine selection.
The food was fabulous,
rich, and yet wonderfully
delicate and aromatic.
There wasa diverse offering
of both hot and cold hors
d'oeuvres. We sampled the
Galantine de Faisan, a
pheasant and stuffed meat
creation which was sea
soned to perfection. The

Quenelles de Sole Nantua, a
mousse of sole in a lobster
and cream sauce, were
feather-light and well com
plemented by the richly
flavored lobster sauce. The
piece de resistance, how
ever were the Crab Legs
Ambassador, fresh Dunge
ness crab legs delicately
cooked in a white wine
saure.,
Soups were also ex
cellent. The Onion Soup au
Cratin was light, generously
coated with cheese, and
very savory. The Sene
galaise, a type of vichyssoise
with curry and a touch of

saffron, is served cold, and
combines the velvety tex
ture of the pureed heeks,
potatoes and cream with the
slight pungency of the
curry.
Choosing entrees was ex
cruciatingly difficult, as the
selection varied from beef,
lamb and veal, prepared in a
wide variety of styles, to
chicken, squab and
pheasant, as well as crab,
salmon, sole and lobster. Af
ter much deliberation, and
suggestions from Jacques,

we opted for Mignon de
Veau aux Morilles and
Croute de Homard brillat
savarin. The veal, the ten
derest I have ever tasted was
covered with Morille
mushrooms (a rare
mushroom with a unique
texture and flavor) and a
light cream sauce. The
lobster, prepared from
fresh, live Maine crusta
ceans, was superb. The meat
was tender, sweet, juicy and
blended perfectly with the
sauce, similar to the Nantua,
and the surrounding pastry,
which could have been a
touch flakier.
We shared the house
souffle for dessert. This
creation was half chocolate
and half Grand Marnier,
with two sauces to accom
pany it. Although very light
and fluffy, and sufficiently
flavorful, I found it slightly
less exciting than the rest of
the meal.
The wine list is extensive,
and includes some very rare
selections, but unfortunate
ly the prices reflect this.
There are several less ex
pensive wines such as the
Blanc Fume de Pouilly
which we enjoyed, but even
these are somewhat over
priced. Overall, including
wine, it would be rather dif
ficult to fully explore the
menu and emerge with a
check for less than $70 for
two, and itisquite likely that
it will be more. Still if you
wish to be pampered and
enjoy some of San Francis
co's most exquisite cuisine
and service, I heartily rec
ommend La Bourgogne for
your next big evening out.
