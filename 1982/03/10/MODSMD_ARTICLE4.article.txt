# Athletic Department granted fundraising, investing power

The University's Department of
Athletics, Physical Education and
Recreation (DAPER) has been given
the right to autonomously raise and
invest unrestricted funds, following
an action of the University Board of
Trustees yesterday.
The board approved the DAPER
Investment Fund, which will obtain
roughly the same status as funds op
erating in the Graduate School of
Business, the Engineering Depart
ment and the Hoover Institution, ac
cording to University officials. A 17-
person Investment Board will be es
tablished to manage the funds, which
will be invested separately from the
general investment assets of the Uni
versity.
Prompted largely by DAPER
budget shortfalls which amounted to

5144,000 in 1979, $1.4 million in 1980
and $346,000 for 1981, one of the
main goals of the fund is to build up
unrestricted reserve funds. Those
funds currently amount to less than
$500,000 — an amount Alan Cum
mings, associate athletic director for
finance, said was "below the saftey
level for the program."
The Athletic Department has an
annual budget of more than $10 mil
lion. This year DAPER drew up a
break-even budget which, for the
first five months, is currently "right
on target," Cummings said.
There had been some initial con
cern whether this fund would in ef
fect compete with the efforts of the
Development Office, but according
to David Fulton of that office, the
DAPER staff had already taken some
"markpf soundines" and it had been

determined that most of the likely
sources were those which had al
ready been identified as having spe
cific interests in gifts to DAPER.
Board President William Kimball
said yesterday the two programs
would likely not interefere with
either the Buck Club or the Cardinal
Club — the two DAPER programs
which currently raise scholarship
funds for men's and women's athlet
ics, respectively — becausethe"min
imum entry fee" is $25,000.
In regard to investments, DAPER
Director of Development David
Glen, who worked in Major Gifts in
the Development Office himself for
11 years, said the kind of investments
which DAPER would likely involve
more risk and be of a less conserva
tive nature, hence necessitating in-
