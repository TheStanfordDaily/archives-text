# Clemons: not sure why, but it works

### Mike Hale 
Clarence Clemons and the
Red Bank Rockers
Keystone Palo Alto
6 March 1982
If an easy journalistic
cliche can be trusted (most
can), there were two groups
of people at this show last
Friday: a small crowd who
knew Clarence was going to
play classic soul, and who
came to hear it, and a much
larger group there because
Clarence is Springsteen's
sax player and didn't he do
that solo in "Jungleland"? I
don't know, no one was
shouting "BRUUUCE!" or
anything, butthatmayjust
have been out of courtesy
Which istosay, I'm not
really qualified tosay
anything of a critical nature
about the music itself, or to
recreate the great days of
Otis Redding and Wilson
Pickett and compare to
theirs the styles of Clarence
Clemons and J. D. Dalton,
respectively. I did recognize
"In the Midnight Hour" and
"Try a Little Tenderness"
and, of course,
Springsteen's "Fire"
(second encore). But mostly
I jumped up and down and
bathed in reflected glow, as
it were. What I can do is try
to explain why I was
jumping upanddown,
because I don't normally do
that sort of thing; and why
Laurie, who's from Fremont
and likes Loverboyand
Journey, loved Clarence,
which seems significant;
and why Jim didn't make
any clever remarks for9o
minutes, which is absolutely
groundshakirtK.
Every concert has its
theatrical and its purely
emotional components (did
he connect?), and Clemons
has learned crowd control
from Springsteen, a master
of that art. The influences
are obvious: he delivers

little monologues about his
life and career, which turn
into songs before your eyes
(it works even though he
didn'twritethesongs); he
can front, share the stage, or
melt into the band equally
well, and can do all three in
one song; and he makes his
respect for the audience
obvious.
Then there arethethings
that are his alone. Presence,
first. He's 6' 3", around 220
lbs., he tried out for the
Lions, and his football
player's lungs can hold a
note so long you need two
breaths to scream along
with it. There's nothing
"cool" about Clarence —
when he plays a solo, he
hunkers himself down in
the middle of the stage,
points his big butt toward
thedrums,and huncheshis
shoulders up around his
ears, oblivious of the crowd
for the duration.
And then there's the way
he plays. While he's faithful,
I'm told, to the styles of the
'60s and early'7os
saxophone greats he
lovingly recalls during the
show, all hissolos retain a
flavor of the sound he has
made famous on five
Springsteen albums, a style
now imitated by every
top-40 sessionman around.
Hard and fast, with a
minimum of wailing, his
sound seems punched
ratherthan forced out of the
saxophone.
And the same goes for the
group. The truth is,
Clarence Clemons and the
Red Bank Rockers take
great soul songs and turn
them into Rreat 'AOs rock
,os4r, e no,h,n ts ln
process (or perhaps gaining
as much as they lose).
Which is why Mary Rose
(our little rock n' roller)
stopped dancing, sat on the
stage, and listened to the
whole show.

And then there's the way
he plays. While he's faithful,
I'm told, to the styles of the
'60s and early'7os
saxophone greats he
lovingly recalls during the
show, all hissolos retain a
flavor of the sound he has
made famous on five
Springsteen albums, a style
now imitated by every
top-40 sessionman around.

minimum of wailing, his
sound seems punched
ratherthan forced out of the
saxophone.
And the same goes for the
group. The truth is,
Clarence Clemons and the
Red Bank Rockers take
great soul songs and turn
them into Rreat 'AOs rock

as much as they lose).
Which is why Mary Rose
(our little rock n' roller)
stopped dancing, sat on the
stage, and listened to the
whole show.
