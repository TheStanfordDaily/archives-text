The Cars
The Cow Palace/San Francisco
6 March 1982
The only American Cars that
are selling today are from Bos
ton, not Detroit. Ironically, the
same idea that is killing Detroit
is making a huge sue < ess of Ric
Ocasek & Co.; both Ocasek
and the Michigan automakers
found a good thing and de
cided to stick with it. For De
troit, the suicide lies in an in
sistence on produting big cars.
For Ocasek, the success lies in
the realization of his goal for
the last eight years—"to make
all my songs sound alike." Both
keep producing the same
product year after year, but De
troit's sales wane and the Cars'
popularity keeps on rising.
Who'da thunk that con
servatism would be more suc
cessful in the music industry
than in automobiles?
The Cars concert last Satur
day at the Cow Palace showed
just how boring their kind of
conservatism can be. It took
the crowd seven songs just to
get excited about the show,
and took the band eight songs
before they played anything
that merited an excited re
sponse. There was the predic
table cheering every time an
old favorite was played, but
crowd enthusiasm would wane
before the band had" gotten
through four bars of the song.
New material from the fourth
album was received largely in
silence.
The problem is a real lack of
any musical innovation what
soever. Ocasek's lyrics are
often cool, dispassionate, bit
ing, but are wasted against so
many tired riffs. The Cars' new
songs are largely (though not
' uniformly) a pursuit of the low
est common musical de
nominator, distilling the
creativity out of the music of
successful bands like Journey
playing only the phrases that
will make good hooks and bass
lines that thump slowly but
powerfully in cavernous
auditoriums. The songs were
definitely Cars songs, but the
incidentals that make music in

teresting—the guitar solos and
synthesizer eflet Is—c ould have
been lifted straight out of any
other heavy metal band. It is
this fungibility that makes the
Cars so exceptionally unin
teresting, and the indist
inguishability of their songs
from one another that makes
them so successful.
The Cars took so lonn to Ret
van sv vmi. '«»unv w UJ
uninspired. The first few songs
were weak, although they
managed to infuse more life
into "Bye Bye Love" than I
would have suspected pos
sible. One of the new songs,
"Touch and Go," is a perfet t

example of musical reduction
to inanity. How can you have
any respect fora song with lyr
ic s like "It felt so right" and a G-
Im C D thorus? I hadn't re
aped the Raspberries had had
so wide an influence. The Cars
did seem to get better as the
night wore on, but there were
notable lapses. "My Best
Friend's Girl" captured the
piuwu love ui a »-»-yc«u -010 idll
create, but somehow "You're
All I've Got Tonight" just didn't
make it as a showstopping en
core number.
When the Cars first arrived
on the scene in 1977, they were
seen >*s part of the vanguard of

a new power pop movement,
along with such bands as the
Pretenders, the Police, and the
Knack. While the Knack has
disbanded and the other two
groups are enjoying success of
their own, the Cars have gone
further astray by incorporating
vocal, instrumental, and ar
ranging styles from more com
mercial bands. Where the Po
icivnutri» viii vial, iiic v_ais
sound is always inntrolled.
There are no sharp edges, no
unexpected or < lever < hanges.
One senses that playing in the
Cars' rhythm section is a lot like
watching a ball roll downhill.
The band avoids inventiveness

with the same care and
aversion that CM avoids incur
ring the wrath of antitrust en
forcers.
Ocasek, guitarist and song
writer for the Cars, has lent his
homogenizing talents to pro
ducing other, lesser known
new wave bands on small
labels. While the effort is chari
table and may advance the for
tunes of some of the bands in
volved, it is doubtful whether
the industry as a whole would
benefit from an infestation of
Ocasek clones in the way that
Michael McDonald seemed to
have taken over a few years
ago. Ocasek took Romeo Void,
an inventive band with a fresh
and creative an outlook on the
proper function of music, and
the result was "Never Say Nev
er"—a song whose only charm
is a refrain lauding disin
terested, aloof promiscuity.
Even the refrain sounds like
four songs off "Candy-O":
perhaps Ocasek's idea of New
Wave is getting to be even
more suggestive than the kind
of lyrics the Cars sing.
The length of time it took the
crowd to get into the concert
reinstituted my faith in the
bunch. After all, what can you
expect from a crowd which
didn't even call back Nick
Lowe for an encore? Granted,
Lowe was a bit and the
Cow Palace acoustics tend to
favor powerful lines and not
the careful precison of Lowe's
music. Lowe approaches pop
and related genres the way an
art student copies the works of
the great masters—with careful
attention to detail and attempt
ing to play each song as per
fectly as possible. But the
acoustics alone can't account
for the different reception ac
corded Lowe and the Cars,
both of whom would have
been considered New Wave ar
tists three or four years ago.
Lowe is still waving, but the
Cars have moved to capture j
the same kind of success that
A«_/L»*_ nave touno. mere
were more Journey and Black
Sabbath T-shirts in the au
dience than Clash or B-525, and
that probably tells as much
about where the Cars have
gone as would volumes of
criticism and lament.
