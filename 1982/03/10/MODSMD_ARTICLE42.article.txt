# The
						deceptively difficult parody of Les Ball ets Trockadero
## 
### Kevin Reidy 
A gracefully provacative lunacy pranced
its way into the Opera House last Friday as
Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, the
all male travesty ballet corps, reared its
feminity to a packed house. In order for
parody to be successful, the artist must take
his comedy seriously; in essence, the parody
may surpass the quality of the parodied. The
talents of this corps de ballet are so vast that it
can easily vacillate between the classical and
the spoof, to the point where the untrained
eye is at times unable to distinguish between
the two.
The evening opened with the
Trockadero's traditional absurd announce
ments: "Anastasia Romanoff, known as the
' Little Orphan ' and who joined the
Trockadero on tour appearing cloaked in an
enigma (complete with zipout lining) is in a
good mood tonight." Other such com
ments, humorous in the given context,
ensued. Once the crowd settled down, the
evening of satirized dance opened with "Les
Sylphides," and was followed by "Spring
Waters," a take off of Martha Graham, "The
Lamentation of Jane Eyre," a dainty rendi
tion of the "Dying Swan," and the San Fran
cisco premiere of the"Pharoah's Daughter."

"Les Sylphides," done by Trockadero, is
the classic with a bit of schtick for good
measure. Tamara Boutndiyeva aired her
dance belt to the audience during lifts by
Ivanovitch Lermontov, keeping the au
dience rolling in the aisles. Â£amarina
Zamarkova's precise timing during the
number's second Mazurka was almost the
way it "should be done," barring an occa
sional doubletake to the audience at just the
right moment to bring gales of laughter.
My favorite piece was the acrobatic
"Spring Waters." Nadia Doumiafeyva and
"Biff" Stroganoff looked like Babilonia and
Gardner as they glided and pirouetted them
selves into each other's arms. They spiraled
around the stage as professionally as the
Bolshoi. Nadia's happiness with herself after
each bit (evidented by her Ultrabrite smile)
as well as her winking and flirting with the
audience, made the comedy.
"The Lamentations of Jane Eyre" was a
satirical romp of choreographic style. It
seemed to have been staged by Martha
Graham herself. Agrippina Proboskoyna
danced the leading Greek role of Bronta,
while Yurika Sakitumi and Sonia Leftova as
Gothica and Repressana, the Chorus of
Grief. The dance was quite polished, how

ever Ms. Eyre and her cohorts lamented far
too often, causing the tempo to drag a bit.
"The Pharoah's Daughter," the final piece,
was the gala event of the evening. In keeping

with the current vogue for exhuming and re
treading "old war horses" this number con
stituted the Trockadero's "own slightly al
tered new view of the dim past": a revival of
Marius Petipa's "La Fille du Pharon."
The dance was condensed down to two
closely knit scenes, in the British Museum of
1923 and in Thebes, 302 BC,thel6th birthday
of the Princess Aspica. Tamara Boumidiyeva
played the leading role of the madcap
heiress to the Throne of Egypt. She entered
in a somewhat classical style, with four hairy
matrons and a lion chasing them back and
forth across the stage. Proboskovna danced
Queen Tipitose XXVI, a stern disciplinarian
anxious to see her daughter married, and
Alexis Ivanovitch Lermotov was Lord Re
ginald Winthrope, Britain's richest most
handsome young archeologist (with what
seemed to be a head of straw).
All in all, to see a troupe of bewhiskered
ballerinas, with enough hair under their
arms to gag a maggot, in white tutus, execut
ing elegant pas de deux, is out-and-out
lunacy on stage. The creativity and pro
fessionalism of Les Ballets Trockadero is such
that everyone finds their comedy funny as
well as brilliant.
