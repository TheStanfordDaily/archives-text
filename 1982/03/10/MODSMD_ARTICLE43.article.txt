Amy Grant
San Jose Civic
6 March 1982
"Every time I perform in concert, people come up
to me and say, 'this really blessed me, you really
moved me tonight.'. .. really moved you to do what?
How are you going to walk away different tonight, dif
ferent in a way that you've never been different
beforef"
I often wonder why some musicians perform, what
their purpose is. Recently Daryl Hall and John Oates
sang on Saturday Night Live and it struck me that, after
about 10 years together they'd finally found success
with their Voices album, so now to maintain that suc
cess, they're forced to put all their expeience behind
a song like "Private Eyes," where they can't use it. At
Pat Benatar's concert earlier this year, her warm-up,
David Johansen , essentially told the audience that
he was up there to show them how bitchin' he was. It
seems a bit empty to me that someone would go into
music just to prove themselves to strangers, or to
throw away their talents to stay in the top 40.

"This is my hope for you, . . . (ha( you will take
something special with you when you go, that you will
receive from this concert more than just a couple of
hours of entertainment."
I hadn't heard Amy Grant's music until this concert
for this review came up. I knew that she was a popular
gospel singer, and I discovered that she was only 21
and had already made five albums. Someone who
worked on her publicity had left me an album, and I
listened and found her to have a rich alto voice, a de
cent band and a pop-rock style. It was a live rec
ording and her comments to the audience were very
serious, dealing with her own weaknesses as com
pared to the magnitude of her material, and with the
search for meaning. Many of her songs carried out the
latter theme, saying that the only way to tell of the
solution was to sing of personal discovery in songs like
"Look What Has Happened to Me."
Gary Chapman, her fiance, opened the show with
some rambling deadpan humor and a few of his
songs. After he walked on stage with only his guitar
and a can of Tab, he said, "I'd like to introduce the
band." He seemed to be relaxed and at ease with his
audience, not afraid to banter or take his time be

tween songs.
Grant came on after only a 10-minute break, during
which no stagehand moved anything, a change from
the usual concert's 45-minute wait. At first, it seemed
as if she was a little distant. She didn't seem nearly as
personable as Chapman and she looked beyond the
audience instead of at them. Still, her voice sounded
better than it did on her record and her band per
formed passionately. But the show began to move for
me when she got more involved with the crowd. She
wanted them to sing along with a psalm that Michael
Smith, her pianist, had put to music, and some people
did, but not many. Then she finished and, instead of
just forgetting it and going on, she had everybody
stand while the band played the song over again. The
ice was broken. I sang that time.
Throughout, she and Chapman flouted the usual
fear music stars show they have of their fans. They
were willing to share, there were no security guards to
keep the crowd away, and, after the concert, they
came out and sat on the edge of the stage so that any
one who wanted to come up and talk or stare at them
could. They sang a duet, which he had written two
weeks before proposing to her, directly to the other.
They didn't pull back and retreat with some nervous
humor and they didn't apologize for getting too per

sonal. They just looked at each other and sang and
trusted that people would want to share in their love.
Later, she talked about justifying and being able to
accept yourself.
"After a concert a girl came up and talked to me
and then handed me a paper bag. I thought, you
know, she'd probably put a Playgirl or a fifth in there
to mess up my image. But I opened it backstage and I
found a 16 page letter. She poured out her heart. . .
You can't justify yourself. Whether or not I've got my
face and voice stamped on vinyl won't mean anything
in eternity . . . Your justification is that you are, that
you've been put here."
A moment earlier in the show stays with me. After a
heavily orchestrated number, Amy sat down on a
stool and started into a ballad, accompanied only by
Smith's soft piano. In the back of the auditorium some
people started singing, echoing her. Then others fol
lowed them and more followed them and soon most
of the crowd was singing, harmonies mixing in with
melodies. Once the song ended, only a few ap
plauded, the others just looked ahead or at one an
other.
