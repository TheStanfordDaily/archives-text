0.K., here goes: The musical quiz of the
week. What comes to mind when you think
of the Beach Boys? A) Surf's Up B) Catch a
wave C) Wipe out D) Rhonda E) All of the
above .. . Finished? Right!
Well gang, on the new Beach Boys com
pilation Ten Years of Harmony you won't
find any of the above. On it you'll find some
of the best and worst non-surf and non-car
music from this quintet of eternal adoles
cents.
What we have here is an archetypal ex
ercise of two for oneness. Two mediocre
albums that would have made for one great
one. Drawing on material exclusively from
the 70s, the Beach Boys are apparently mak
ing one last gasp at regaining their late
'60s/early '70s popularity, culminated in
1974 s compilation Endless Summer. The
double greatest hits album was the last big
seller for the band and serves as a classical
summary of the innocence of the Southern
California beach life.
The Beach Boys spent much of the '70s in
search of profundity. It worked at times but
not often. The minor 1972 hit "Sail On Sail

or" immediately comes to mind and serves
as the highlight of this collection. One of the
most underrated pop tunes of the '70s, it
works well on two levels, a nice tune with a
great hook about sailing, and a worthwhile
statement about carrying on through life's
struggles.
The rest of the Beach Boys' success on Ten
Years comes from the easy going ballads and
the rock and roll love songs. "Good Timin',"
one of the few really well-produced cuts On
the album, mixes beautiful harmonies with
much more well-defined instrumental than
are found in the majority of Beach Boys' mu
sic. The emphasis has always been on the
multi-layered harmonies but the Beach Boys
are good musicians and it's refreshing to be
able to hear it for once.
"Goin' On" also fits this mold, a love
ballad surprisingly free from syrupy schlock
featuring impeccable harmonies and a rare
sax solo, bringing back memories of the two
note sax break in "Shut Down"from the End
less Summer collection.
Good dance music makes up the rest of
the album's strong material. As usual, topics
center around the coast, Southern Cal week
ends, adolescence and young (incredibly
innocent) love. "It's 0.K.," "Come Go With
Me " and Chuck Berry's "School Days" are
irresistable rockers in this vein. The live ver
sion of "Darlin' " also succeeds and reveals

the speed and raw edge the Boys were able
to produce live, elements all too often miss
ing in their studio work.
Rockers that only marginally succeed in
clude "Sea Cruise" and "She's Got Rhythm,"
redeemed only by the fact that the Boys
don't really take themselves seriously here
and nobody really listens to the words while
dancing anyway.

Much of Ten Years is taken up with efforts
to shed the exclusively beach, car, surf, girl
label that made the Beach Boys the biggest
thing since applesauce in the first place.
"Lady Lynda," a schlocky Al Jardine ballad is
an aural postcard of all the places he would
like to take this particular gal. "Surf's Up" is a

totally incomprehensible series of images
that would look fantastic in the hands of
Francis Ford Coppola but just don't work
here, and the music offers it no support. It
has nothing ic do with surfing either.
And this is where we begin to run into
trouble. After years of "California Girls,"
"Surfin' Safari," and your basic "Fun, Fun,
Fun," the Beach Boys fail rather miserably at

self imposed pretentiousness. "Don't Go
Near The Water," an anti-water pollution
statement, has got to be one of the silliest
protest songs of all time. "Don't go near the
water/ To do it any wrong/ To be cool with
the water/ Is the message of this song."
C'mon you guys . .

Ten Years of Harmony is a difficult work to
judge overall. Beach Boys music is fun and
always will be to this kid from Southern Cal.
It isdifficult tocriticizetheguyswhoconjure
up so many images of summers gone by,
even if they have written songs abut ev
erything at the beach except the molecular
structure of white sand.
But they started that way, succeeded that
way and still win new fans that way, yet how
can you criticize them for trying to be seri
ous? They just couldn't cut the mustard,
that's all. Southern California adolescents
never really grow up, just ask my friends. The
Beach Boys blew it when they tried to grow
up.
So Ten Years is a two record set that would
have made a fine single record swan song of
the all but ignored critically thrashed
70s Beach Boys' music. Beach Boy neo
phytes would probably enjoy it for its over
view of the band's music from the '70s and
avid buyers of "fun" music who have ever
spent a day on the beach or sailing will want
to consider this one also. Butforthedyed-in
the-rip-stop-nylon Beach Boys fan like me
who spent hours memorizing "California
Girls," don't bother.
Gotta go now, surf's up!
