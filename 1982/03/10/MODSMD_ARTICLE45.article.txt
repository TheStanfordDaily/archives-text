It certainly was not "just an
other show" Saturday night at
the Old Waldorf. In fact, Full
Moon's performance there
might well have been the best
concert I have ever seen.
And I have heard in concert
the likes of Al DiMeola, Earth,
Wind & Fire, Spyro Gyra, the
Dregs, and a whole host of oth
ers noted for their live shows.
When I place Full Moon at the
top of that list, I do so fora rea
son.
Formerly the Larsen-Feiten
Band, Full Moon is another one
of those groups you've proba
bly never heard of and simply
can't classify as being jazz,
rock, fusion, or whatever. To
call them a fusion band
wouldn't do them justice, as
every other song they played
was definitely rockand roll. But
labelling them "rock" is just as

bad, since it is unfair to toss
them in with such trash as Sam
my Hagar, AC/DC, and the
like. Tower Records files Full
Moon's albums in the talent
laden jazz/fusion section, and
perhaps they are correct — at
least from a purely talent stand
point.
Neil Larsen, Buzz Feiten,
Lenny Castro, Art Rodriguez,
and Vernon Porteraren't exact
ly household names. But
neither are they the type of
guys you'll find pumping gas in
Milpitas. They are Full Moon.
And they areamong the best —
at least in my mind and un
doubtedly in those of Satur
day's audience.
The two leaders of the band,
Larsen and Feiten, are almost
two completely different musi
cians, believe it or not. Larsen
opts for the fusion, all in
strumental sound, while Feiten
writes and sings Full Moon's
rockier tunes.
Their latest Warner Bros,
album is a case in point. Of the
eight tracks on "Full Moon,"
four are rock songs with
Feiten-composed lyrics; the
remaining four are Larsen

products and sound decidely
different. On the 1982 LP,
Feiten solos on his songs, and
Larsen on his. But in concert,
the two bridge this gap in a
simple and pleasureable way —
both solo on each other's
songs.
One of the best aspects of
Full Moon is that, as talented as

they are, they don't try too
hard to prove this to the con
cert audience. They simply act
normal; however, normal for
Full Moon far exceeds your or
dinary "normal." Each of the
performers has his unique per
sonality on stage. Feiten, by far
the main attraction, was a de
serving recipient of the most

spotlight time. He is like a sol
dier heading into battle, with
his guitar as his rifle — he is
possessed by a blind intensity
and thus plays with reckless
abandon. Feiten's solos are
somewhere between the
heaven of fusion and the hell of
rock; a sort of guitarists'
purgatory, if you will. They

struments. Using a per
cussionist in concert balanced
Full Moon, preventing them
from even temporarily drifting
into the realm of heavy metal
rock. Castro had a magnificent
solo, in which he demon
strated a versatility on per
cussion equalled by few, dur

the group's ninth tune. Porter
began by playing quick riffs up
and down the neck of the bass,
but, as if that was too easy, he
decided to change the pace of
the solo at its mid-point. Porter
virtually stopped playing and
stared directly into the eyes of
Castro in dubious anticipation.
A smile broke out on his face
and his hands broke intoa wild
slapping and popping frenzy
on his bass. Nothing but a roar
ing ovation could acknowl
edge his tremendous effort.
Full Moon played 12 total
songs, seven of which were vo
cal tracks. All but one or two of
the tunes were fast and played
with amazing intensity, often
featuring a heavy bassline. Ev
ery number contained at least
one Feiten solo, usually mortar
ing two bricks of lyrics togeth
er. Some of these songs were so
"hot" that I almost lost my cool
and ran fora fire extinguisher.
Thegroupperformed rough
ly half of their 1982 LP in con
cert, an album which should
make big waves in both the
jazz/fusion and rock worlds,
especially in the former. It is
one of the most satisfying LP s I
have ever had the honor to
hear, as it contains brilliant
song after song. It is the type of
album that could become a top
seller in all departments if it is
boosted by strong promotion.
Get to work, Warner Brothers,
you've got a real blue chipper
here.
The LP begins with "Phan
tom of the Footlights," proba
bly Full Moon's biggest hit so
far. It is followed by "American
Hero," a Larsen-composed in
strumental cut. The remainder
of the LP alternates between
Feiten vocal tracks and Larsen
fusion tunes, and because of
this becomes inconsistent at
times. Nevertheless, Full Moon
has a little bit of everything, in
cluding a quasi-reggae beat on
"Standing in Line." It is by far
Larsen Feiten's best album. Buy
it.
What does the future hold
for Full Moon? In the im
mediate future, they recorded
two tracks live at Montreaux

It certainly was not "just an
other show" Saturday night at
the Old Waldorf. In fact, Full
Moon's performance there
might well have been the best
concert I have ever seen.
And I have heard in concert
the likes of Al DiMeola, Earth,
Wind & Fire, Spyro Gyra, the
Dregs, and a whole host of oth
ers noted for their live shows.
When I place Full Moon at the
top of that list, I do so fora rea
son.
Formerly the Larsen-Feiten
Band, Full Moon is another one
of those groups you've proba
bly never heard of and simply
can't classify as being jazz,
rock, fusion, or whatever. To
call them a fusion band
wouldn't do them justice, as
every other song they played
was definitely rockand roll. But
labelling them "rock" is just as

bad, since it is unfair to toss
them in with such trash as Sam
my Hagar, AC/DC, and the
like. Tower Records files Full
Moon's albums in the talent
laden jazz/fusion section, and
perhaps they are correct — at
least from a purely talent stand
point.
Neil Larsen, Buzz Feiten,
Lenny Castro, Art Rodriguez,
and Vernon Porteraren't exact
ly household names. But
neither are they the type of
guys you'll find pumping gas in
Milpitas. They are Full Moon.
And they areamong the best —
at least in my mind and un
doubtedly in those of Satur
day's audience.
The two leaders of the band,
Larsen and Feiten, are almost
two completely different musi
cians, believe it or not. Larsen
opts for the fusion, all in
strumental sound, while Feiten
writes and sings Full Moon's
rockier tunes.
Their latest Warner Bros,
album is a case in point. Of the
eight tracks on "Full Moon,"
four are rock songs with
Feiten-composed lyrics; the
remaining four are Larsen

products and sound decidely
different. On the 1982 LP,
Feiten solos on his songs, and
Larsen on his. But in concert,
the two bridge this gap in a
simple and pleasureable way —
both solo on each other's
songs.
One of the best aspects of
Full Moon is that, as talented as

they are, they don't try too
hard to prove this to the con
cert audience. They simply act
normal; however, normal for
Full Moon far exceeds your or
dinary "normal." Each of the
performers has his unique per
sonality on stage. Feiten, by far
the main attraction, was a de
serving recipient of the most

spotlight time. He is like a sol
dier heading into battle, with
his guitar as his rifle — he is
possessed by a blind intensity
and thus plays with reckless
abandon. Feiten's solos are
somewhere between the
heaven of fusion and the hell of
rock; a sort of guitarists'
purgatory, if you will. They
