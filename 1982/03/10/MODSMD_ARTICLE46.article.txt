# Jose Limon Co. mixes, matches

### Martha Carter 
Last weekend brought to
Stanford the Jose Limon
Dance Company, one of the
longest established modern
dance companies in Ameri
ca. There are 12 dancers —
six men and six women. Jose
Limon, the founder of the
company who died in 1972,
was originally from Mexico,
and this seems to have at
tracted dancers from all
over the world — one mem
ber of the troupe is from
Venezuela, another from
Trinidad and another from
Israel.
The company's repertoire
is exciting and varied due to
the many acclaimed
choreographers who have
created for them. Friday's
performance consisted of
three pieces. Cleopatra,
choreographed by Murray
Louis, is a very stylized dra
matic dance recalling
Cleopatra's life. Next came
A Day In the Life, choreo
graphed by one of Limon's
first principal male dancers
Lucas Hoving. And third was
one of Jose Limon's choreo
graphies entitled There is A

Time based on the well
known verse of the same
name.
A Day In the Life was a
masterpiece in combining
music with dance. The
woman responsible for the
inspirational vocal and cello
score isGwendolyn Watson,
Stanford Dance Division's
resident dance accom
panist. She, in her music,
and Lucas Hoving, with his
design, together created the
images of Dawn, Morning,
Afternoon, and Night by
having dancers in timeless
clothing moving simply in
reflection of the musical
textures. The dancers dis
played fine technical profi
ciency while working with
the Limon fall and recovery
technique. It is the kind of
piece that mesmerizes,
sends shivers, and makes
you smile all at the same
time.
Saturday's performance
displayed an entirely dif
ferent program. The pro
gram started very suc
cessfully with Doris Hum
phrey's all-woman piece
choreographed to Bach's

calming "Air on a G String."
This was first performed in
1928 yet it still survives today
as a wonderful visual specta
cle as the five women move
gracefully in long shimmer
ing blue robes.
The second piece of the
evening, Jose Limon's The
Unsung, danced by all six
men of the company, had a
moving impact on the au
dience. It was choreo
graphed as a "paean to the
heroic defenders of the
American patrimony" who
are depicted by each of the
tall and powerful male
Limon dancers. It was
through Limon's influence
that the male dancer in
modern dance was able to
achieve a physical virtuosity
in the art as well as a psy
chologicat depth
The third piece, Magritte,
M a g r i t t e , a
dance/drama/comedy

about the works of the sur
realist painter Rene Ma
gritte with choreography by
Ann Sokolow was clever
and most entertaining.
However, if you go to see
pure Limon movement, this
ain't it.
The piece was rather dis
appointing. The choreo
graphy was done by the ar
tistic director of the com
pany Carla Maxwell, and re

studies whose lack of per
sonality make them quite
ambivalent — especially
compared to the vitality of
the company's other works.
I appreciate the company's
desire to experiment with
their own choreography,
but this particular experi
mem-was not really the most
inspiring way to conclude
two otherwise successful
performances.

contain enough rock riffs to
keep the listener uneasy, and
enough of fusion's fluidity to
relax him at the same time.
Feiten's guitar also has a per
sonal sound, a combination of
a scream and a whine. The nu
merous electronic devices he
employed only contributed to
his sheer brilliance. Feiten's
guitar is part of his body, and
he accordingly uses it as his vo
cal cords when not singing
through a microphone. One
had no choice but to enjoy.
Larsen, on the other hand, is
a much quieter, more compla
cent performer. He repre
sented the large pearl buried in
an oyster shell of keyboards.
Although the inconspicuous
member of the quintet, Larsen
comforted every ear in the
Waldorf with a lucious array of
notes when it came time for
Hirr\ to so\o.
On the opposite side of the
stage from Larsen stood Castro,
himself surrounded by a fine
arrangement of percussion in

ing "Little Cowboys," an in
strumental cut off "Full
Moon."
Helping Castro keep the beat
was bearded drummer Art
Rodriguez. Although he bears
only a slight resemblance to
drumming great Steve Gadd,
Rodriguez could be his twin
brother on sheer playing abili
ty. He holds the sticks in the
same fashion and Full Moon's
music requires him to have a
similar style. (In fact, Gadd
played on a 1978 Larsen album
entitled "Jungle Fever.")
Rodriguez performed like he
was at dinner — a meal of mu
sic — with his sticks as his eat
ing utensils and his high hat
and snare drum as his plates.
That leaves us with bassist
Vernon Porter. For the first
three-quarters of the show, he
stood almost invisibly to the
immecWau* of fe\ter\. He
seemed good, but the extent of
his ability was not readily ap
parent until his perfectly splen
did solo in "Casino Nights,"
