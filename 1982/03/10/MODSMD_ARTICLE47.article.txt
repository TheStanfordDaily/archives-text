# 'Quest for Fire': optimism among the Neanderthals
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Jean-Jacques Annaud's first
film, Black and White in Color,
was a delicately ironic account
of a French settlement on the
Ivory Coast in 1915 that learns
— months after the fact, due to
the slowness of the mails —
that France is at war with Ger
many; these complacent colo
nials, out of touch for so long
with their native country, must
become military leaders and
train Africans to kill Germans.
Black and White in Color was
distinguished by its under
statement and its lack of
cynicism; Annaud displayed
genuine compassion for the
deluded members of this set
tlement — who could never re
turn to the easy contentment
of the pre-war era — even as he
explored the comic possi

bilitiesof the situation. Annaud
has now released Quest for
Fire, a movie about the struggle
of early Homo Sapiens to find
fire. It sounds like a terrible
idea fora film, but it turns out
to be a lovely surprise; and
though it is a strikingly dif
ferent project from Black and
White in Color, it is similarly
un-cynical, both as a piece of
filmmaking and in its attitude
to the progress of our fore
runners toward civilization.
The story, which Gerard
Brach based on a popular turn
of-the-century novel by
J.H.Rosny, Sr., is simple. The
Ulam, a small tribe, is attacked
by Neanderthals (the
Wagabou) and in the subse
quent flight their crudely con
structed "lamp" goes out. The
Ulam are insufficiently ad

vanced to create fire for them
selves, so three tribesmen (Ev
erett McGill, Ron Perlman and
Nameer El-Kadi) set out in
search of it. They encounte a
band of cannibals (the Kzamm)
and manage both to escape
them and to liberate their pris
oners, one of whom — a
female, Ika (Rae Dawn Chong)
— attaches herself to the most
ingenious of the Ulam, Naoh
(McGill), until she approaches
her home tribe, the Ivaka. In
the much more advanced Ivaka
camp, where rough crafts have
developed and huts are made
from mud and straw, Naoh sees
fire created from the friction of
sticks; when he brings Ika back
to the Ulam, he also brings fire
— permanently.
Annaud understands that
this story can only be affecting
if it is presented without con
descension. Though it is a
huge, impressive movie, filmed
after three years of research
and utilizing a (felicitous) com
bination of vocal and body lan
guage developed by Anthony
Burgess and Desmond Morris,
what Annaud has concentrated
on is a very strong narrative
line. Quest for Fire is a beau
tifully made, intelligently
thought out adventure story
that in its solid plot construc
tion, integrity and pictorial

splendor recalls Irvin
Kershner's first-rate Return of a
Man Called Horse. Annaud not
only captures Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
And his photographer, Claude
Agostini (who also worked on
Black and White in Color),
seems to have participated in
the joys of discovery, too: ev
ery shot is a fresh canvas — the
world has never before looked
so new in a movie. (Quest for
Fire used locations in Kenya,
Scotland, Alberta and Ontario;
after you've seen the picture,
you may want to alter your
travel plans.)
A film about man in his
primitive stages (Quest for Fire
is set 80,000 years ago) might
have been a tract on the early
development of human ag
gression, but though the bat
tles are (understandably)
bloody, this is truly a portrait of
the beginning of civilization.
(Anthropologists may quibble
about its accuracy, but I doubt
any dramatist will.) Naoh is an
authentic hero: he and his fel
low Ulam are instinctively re
pelled by the concept of can
nibalism, and his impulses are
to tame and to create. In one
regal scene he befriends a herd
of wild elephants by offering

grass to them, and in the film's
best moment, he watches the
Ivaka produce fire and tears
run down his cheeks. "Quest"
is the right word for this tale;
Naoh's attitude toward fire
amounts to religious awe. And
for Annaud and Brach, the in
troduction of fire ushers in the
age of community — of
storytelling, laughter and a
sense of home. And they use
the fire-bringer, Ika, as the
emblem of another kind of civ
ilizing force as well: she brings
tenderness to what was pre
viously the most bestial kind of
sexual connection.
My ideal version of this ma
terial would have been a lot
funnier — perhaps because I
had such a good time at
Caveman — but one can't
quarrel with the honesty of An
naud's approach, or with the
way he's used his actors.
Without the restraint of English
stage dialogue, the actors are
free to investigate new ways of
revealing emotion, and the re
sults, especially in the case of
Everett McGill and Rae Dawn
Chong (who gives a really im
aginative comic performance),
are most pleasing: this is acting
full of energy and surprise. In
fact, my only serious objection
to Quest (or Fire is Philippe
Sarde's music, which makes a

bald attempt at grandeur and
ends up sounding self-im
pressed. (It also echoes Dvorak
in several key spots.) Sarde's re
sounding pseudo-primitivism
is the only really false note in
this sweet-natured movie.

from mud and straw, Naoh sees
fire created from the friction of
sticks; when he brings Ika back
to the Ulam, he also brings fire
— permanently.
Annaud understands that
this story can only be affecting
if it is presented without con
descension. Though it is a
huge, impressive movie, filmed
after three years of research
and utilizing a (felicitous) com
bination of vocal and body lan
guage developed by Anthony
Burgess and Desmond Morris,
what Annaud has concentrated
on is a very strong narrative
line. Quest for Fire is a beau
tifully made, intelligently
thought out adventure story
that in its solid plot construc
tion, integrity and pictorial

splendor recalls Irvin
Kershner's first-rate Return of a
Man Called Horse. Annaud not
only captures Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
And his photographer, Claude
Agostini (who also worked on
Black and White in Color),
seems to have participated in
the joys of discovery, too: ev
ery shot is a fresh canvas — the
world has never before looked
so new in a movie. (Quest for
Fire used locations in Kenya,
Scotland, Alberta and Ontario;
after you've seen the picture,
you may want to alter your
travel plans.)
A film about man in his
primitive stages (Quest for Fire
is set 80,000 years ago) might
have been a tract on the early
development of human ag
gression, but though the bat
tles are (understandably)
bloody, this is truly a portrait of
the beginning of civilization.
(Anthropologists may quibble
about its accuracy, but I doubt
any dramatist will.) Naoh is an
authentic hero: he and his fel
low Ulam are instinctively re
pelled by the concept of can
nibalism, and his impulses are
to tame and to create. In one
regal scene he befriends a herd
of wild elephants by offering

grass to them, and in the film's
best moment, he watches the
Ivaka produce fire and tears
run down his cheeks. "Quest"
is the right word for this tale;
Naoh's attitude toward fire
amounts to religious awe. And
for Annaud and Brach, the in
troduction of fire ushers in the
age of community — of
storytelling, laughter and a
sense of home. And they use
the fire-bringer, Ika, as the
emblem of another kind of civ
ilizing force as well: she brings
tenderness to what was pre
viously the most bestial kind of
sexual connection.
My ideal version of this ma
terial would have been a lot
funnier — perhaps because I
had such a good time at
Caveman — but one can't
quarrel with the honesty of An
naud's approach, or with the
way he's used his actors.
Without the restraint of English
stage dialogue, the actors are
free to investigate new ways of
revealing emotion, and the re
sults, especially in the case of
Everett McGill and Rae Dawn
Chong (who gives a really im
aginative comic performance),
are most pleasing: this is acting
full of energy and surprise. In
fact, my only serious objection
to Quest (or Fire is Philippe
Sarde's music, which makes a

bald attempt at grandeur and
ends up sounding self-im
pressed. (It also echoes Dvorak
in several key spots.) Sarde's re
sounding pseudo-primitivism
is the only really false note in
this sweet-natured movie.

Quest for Fire.
Jean-Jacques Annaud's first
film, Black and White in Color,
was a delicately ironic account
of a French settlement on the
Ivory Coast in 1915 that learns
— months after the fact, due to
the slowness of the mails —
that France is at war with Ger
many; these complacent colo
nials, out of touch for so long
with their native country, must
become military leaders and
train Africans to kill Germans.
Black and White in Color was
distinguished by its under
statement and its lack of
cynicism; Annaud displayed
genuine compassion for the
deluded members of this set
tlement — who could never re
turn to the easy contentment
of the pre-war era — even as he
explored the comic possi

bilitiesof the situation. Annaud
has now released Quest for
Fire, a movie about the struggle
of early Homo Sapiens to find
fire. It sounds like a terrible
idea fora film, but it turns out
to be a lovely surprise; and
though it is a strikingly dif
ferent project from Black and
White in Color, it is similarly
un-cynical, both as a piece of
filmmaking and in its attitude
to the progress of our fore
runners toward civilization.
The story, which Gerard
Brach based on a popular turn
of-the-century novel by
J.H.Rosny, Sr., is simple. The
Ulam, a small tribe, is attacked
by Neanderthals (the
Wagabou) and in the subse
quent flight their crudely con
structed "lamp" goes out. The
Ulam are insufficiently ad

vanced to create fire for them
selves, so three tribesmen (Ev
erett McGill, Ron Perlman and
Nameer El-Kadi) set out in
search of it. They encounte a
band of cannibals (the Kzamm)
and manage both to escape
them and to liberate their pris
oners, one of whom — a
female, Ika (Rae Dawn Chong)
— attaches herself to the most
ingenious of the Ulam, Naoh
(McGill), until she approaches
her home tribe, the Ivaka. In
the much more advanced Ivaka
camp, where rough crafts have
developed and huts are made
from mud and straw, Naoh sees
fire created from the friction of
sticks; when he brings Ika back
to the Ulam, he also brings fire
— permanently.
