# 'Evita' comes back the way it came in — with style
## 
### Katie Smith Tony Kelly 
You know a show has style
when Almond Roca is sold in
the lobby at intermission. For
Evita, currently playing at the
Golden Gate Theatre, Almond
Roca was all over the lobby,
and (in a more metaphorical
sense) all over the stage as well.
For writers Tim Rice and An
drew Lloyd Webber, previous
ly known for their collabora
tion on Jesus Christ Superstar,
there is a singular link between
Jesus Christ and Eva Peron —
the seductiveness of style, the
power of charisma in one who
is worshipped. The rock star
Christ and the Broadway
bombshell Evita share the
power of charm over others,
and they use this to full advan
tage in a world dependent on
optimistic saviors. But where in
Superstar the nature of the
messiah is (necessarily) taken as
a given, with the show focusing
on those surrounding Jesus,
Evita concentrates solely on the
desires and ambitions of Eva
Peron, leaving the audience to
fill in the blanks.
Picking up where they left
off in Jesus Christ Superstar,

writers Rice and Webber open
Evita with the death of a new
savior and the cynicism of a
modern-day Judas. Argentina's
"saint/' Eva Peron, passes on to
a presumed immortality, leav
ing the entire population
bereft with the exception of
Che Guevara (Scott Holmes),
the play's narrator.
The opening scene plunges
the audience into the heart of
Argentinian life — maybe a
stylized, Frito Bandito Argen
tinian life, but Argentinian life
nonetheless. One is given the
illusion of being at the movies.
In a sense, one is. Using a huge
projection screen, the opening
scene portrays a group of Ar
gentinians watching a shoot
em-up-get-the-gir l-kiss-the
horse-ride-off-into-the-sunset
Western — in espanol, por
supuesto. The effect grabs at
tention, and the medium of the
screen is used well throughout
the show.
A somewhat sketchy history

is given to us in Evita — vague
newsreels and grainy slides
prove that Eva Peron really
lived (and looked a lot like Loni
Ackerman), but one still can't
trust Evita for its historical ve
racity. The show is not just
about the stuff from which leg

ends are made, it is that same
stuff — offering a few factual
tidbits and then extrapolating
those incidents to form com
plete, yet simplistic characters
that are more myth than flesh.
Yeah, there may be something
manipulative in the process,
but since when did you go to
the Golden Gate Theatre for

jhistory lessons?
Besides, it's appropriate that
a show portraying Eva Peron as
„.an ambitious woman depen
dent on style accepts those
same characteristics itself. And

the style displayed in Evita issu
perb. Harold Prince, obviously
a man who knows what he is
doing around a stage, directs
the play with only the vaguest
nods toward realism — the '50s
Argentina that we see could
well be '30s America, or any
country that you care to name.
Instead, Prince concentrates
on the spectacle; Eva's early
fascination with Buenos Aires
for its fast pace and brassy na
ture is duplicated in the music
and the dancing.
As Eva, Loni Ackerman
creates one of those manipu
lative, magnetic characters
found in the likes of Scarlett
O'Hara or Brett Ashley. Her
machinations are repellent but
her steeled strength and cha

risma elicit a mixture of envy
and admiration. Ackerman
brings a strong voice to the
role, along with some high
steppin' hoofers — it's a shame
that she has only one flashy
dance number. Ackerman
does a convincing job of evolv
ing from Eva's late teens to a
prematurely decaying 33,
though her natural pizzazz and
easy cheesecake smile make
her far more convincing in the
early years.
Jon Cypher, on the other
hand, plays an entirely static
Juan Peron. The first hint that
Eva's husband is less than
dynamic comes when his rise
to power is portrayed in a game
of musical chairs. While Eva's
climb to fame is due solely to
her charm and driving ambi
tion, Juan succeeds by chance.
Who would you like more?
Cypher's singing voice is
strong, but his character is far
too weak to elicit much em
pathy. As a result, his ap-

pearances onstage are neces
sary, but far too frequent con
sidering the lack of develop
ment of his character.
Kelli lames, as a contrast,
makes a brief appearance as an
early mistress of Peron's that is
simply flawless. Her youth and
beauty combine to make James
a figure similar to Mary
Magdalene in Superstar, sing
ing"Wheream I goingto"atop
her suitcase. James brings off
her single number with a hu
mility and confused hurt befit
ting the anonymity of the role.
Far more outgoing in his per
formance, and outstanding in
his role, is Scott Holmes as Che
Guevara. Holmes editorializes
throughtout Evita, illuminating
the dark side of the Cinderella
story of Eva Duarte. He looks
and sounds the part of the
critic, cutting with sharp re
alism through the mourning
crowds in the opening "O
What a Circus." Most impor
tant, Holmes' instinctive
parody communicates what
the audience feels toward Eva
and Evita — an attitude of dis
dain mixed with a touch of
envy. While one may deplore
the lack of substance in the
show, you can't resist the style.
That's the point Rice and Web
ber seem to make, and it's car
ried off beautifully.
