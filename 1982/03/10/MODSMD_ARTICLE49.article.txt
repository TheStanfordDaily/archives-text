# ACT wanders back into the casino — and wins big

### Jiri Weiss 
To produce Mourning Becomes Electra,
the more than five-hour-long tragedy by
Eugene O'Neill, was a big gamble. It is the
kind of gamble that the American Con
servatory Theatre in San Francisco rarely
takes.But it has paid off splendidly. Mourn
ing Becomes Electra must be one of the out
standing productions ACT has produced.
In Mourning Becomes Electra O'Neill has
written a tragedy in the classical sense. The
plot follows loosely the Orestia, a trilogy by
Aeschylus. The names are basically the same
and there is even a chorus — a group of
townspeople — in this production, with
clear plastic masks that are barely visible. But
O'Neill wanted to make the tragedy more
believable to modern audiences who do not
share the classical conceptions of fate.
"Is it possible," asked O'Neill in his diary
in 1926 as he was beginningjo write the play,
"to get modern psychological approxima
tion of Greek sense of fate into such a play,
which an intelligent audience of today,
possessed of no belief in gods or super
natural retribution, could accept and be
moved by?"
O'Neill's answer was psychological
motivation. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung
provided not only the symbolism but also
the fatalism O'Neill needed to replace the
Greek belief in destiny. Instead of being
plagued by gods, O'Neill's characters are
plagued by neuroses.
The play is set in a small New England town
during the Civil War — a Puritan atmosphere
perverted through the worship of father and
God, a breeding ground for neuroses against
the background of a senseless and bloody
war which turned brother against brother.
At first, when you look at the massive
doorway that dominates the set designed by

Ralph Funicello, the set looks like the en
trance to a Greek temple or perhaps a tomb.
One thinks of the pillared porches of the
during the Civil War — a Puritan atmosphere
North with its slender and simple structures.
But the play depends on the Puritan concep
tions of sin and guilt, so the play is set in the
North.
A general, Ezra Mannon (Agamemnon in
the Orestia), returns from the Civil War to his
unfaithful wife Christine (Clytemnestra).
Christine cannot bear her married life any
longer, especially now that her adultery has
been discovered by her daughter Lavinia
(Electra). Lavinia holds Christine's life in her
hands. The only way out for Christine, the

only way for her to marry her lover Adam
Brant (Aegisthus), is to murder her husband.
The murder is carefully planned but not
carefully enough. Lavinia catches her moth
er red-handed, with her father dying of
poison. With his last breath Ezra accuses
Christine.
Lavinia manages to persuade her brother
Orin (Orestes) of their mother's guilt and
they revenge themselves by murdering their
mother's lover. Christine commits suicide
when she hears the news and Orin, guilt-rid
den by her death and by what he discovers to
be his incestuous desire for Lavinia, follows
her example.

In the escapist and cynical world we live in
it is difficult to imagine audiences flocking to
such a long and difficult play. But the dif
ficulties with producing Mourning Becomes
Electra do not lie only in length.
Mourning Becomes Electra is a play writ
ten for audiences more used to theatricality
then subtlety. O'Neill often takes a point and
hammers you over the head with it to make
sure you get it. There are places in the play
when for the modern audience drama turns
to melodrama. The climax, for example,
should have been dramatic, but most of the
audience laughed.
This happens when Ezra is poisoned by his
wife. He takes a long time to die — moaning
and groaning heavily. The noise coming out
of her parent's bedroom attracts Lavinia who
walks in just as her father is at his last gasp. He
points dramatically at Christine and gasps:
"She is guilty — medicine!" When Lavinia
starts to feel his pulse in desparation, her
mother says calmly "Let him alone. He's
asleep." The audience found this humorous.
But the scene is not over yet. After a
heated exchange the mother faints, conve
niently falling backwards onto the floor with
one of her hands grasping the poison vial
that gives Lavinia firm proof to her suspi
cions.
Playing this fora comic effect was a de
cision taken by Allen Fletcher,the director; it
certainly does not seem to be O'Neill's in
tent. But it is hard to tell whether one could
be successful with a different approach.
Another major difficulty with the play for
modern audiences is O'Neill's free use of
psychoanalytic concepts and symbolism.
There are hints of incest in all permutations
between father and daughter, mother and
son, and brother and sister. The women are
combined in a sort of archetypal image:

Lavinia is identified with her mother and
with the mistress of both tier grandfather
and his brother. I hey all share the same fea
ture — "that strange and beautiful hair."
Another powerful, albeit a little obvious,
image is that of a sexually unrepressed South
Sea Islands where "love is not a sin," where
you forget, as Lavinia tells Adam, "all men's
dirty dreams of greet! and power." All of the
major characters express the desire to go
there at one point or another — even when
they are in the process of commitingsuicide.
Unlike Aeschylus, O'Neill focuses all at
tention on Lavinia (Plectra) rather then Orin
(Orestes). Luckily for ACT, they have found a
stunning Lavinia in Julia Fletcher. You can
see the character of Lavinia develop in front
of your eyes. Lavinia starts as her father's girl,
full of the same starkness and lifelessness as
her father — she wears a gray dress through
out the first half of the play. As the play
progresses, Lavinia's personality changes to
be more and more sensuous like her mother
until she becomes her mother — complete
with her mother's favorite color: green.
Another exceptional performance is given
by Ann Lawder as Christine, the mother — it
is interesting to note that Ann Lawder is in
reality Julia Fletcher's mother. She has per
haps an even more dificult role than
F letcher. Because her character is more hys
terical and mercurial, Lawder overplays a lit
tle in a couple of scenes — especially in the
murder scene and just before her suicide.
One gets the feeling that the mother should
be a little more cunning and cool in keeping
with the Mannon tradition.
Thomas Ogelsby does an excellent job of
the confused and weak-willed Orin. He too
undergoes the subtle changes from his
mother's baby to the spoiled tyrant in a per
verse imitation of his father.
