# Nurses' strike averted
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
University Hospital nurses over
whelmingly approved a two-year
contract Sunday, averting a strikeand
possibly making nurses with the most
seniority at the facility the highest
paid in the nation.
The settlement came three days
before the nurses' strike deadline of
March 10. On Feb. 26 the nurses gave
the Hospital a 10-day strike notice, as
required by law.
University Hospital spokesman
Mike Goodkind said the terms of the
contract were "extremely com
plicated," but added that they
basically provided a 10 percent pay
increase in the first year and an eight
percent pay increase in the second
year.
Hedy Dumpel, the president of the
Committee for Recognition of Nurs
ing Achievement (CRONA), the
nurses union, said that under the
new contract nurses who have been
at the top of the pay scale for s'/2
years would be the highest paid in
the nation at $35,298 a year in the sec
ond year of the contract. The first
year nurses who fell under this cate
gory would be paid $31,293.
However, Goodkind called that
figure "deceptive" because in a
month or two other top institutions
will be renegotiating their contracts.
Dumpel said that 912 of the 992
nurses who voted on the contract
Saturday approved it.
University negotiator Nancy

Madsen, associate director of nurs
ing, said the threat of the nurses'
strike influenced the negotiations.
"We were anxious to settle before we
had to empty out the house," she
said.
"We told them we didn't want to
go down to the wire and they re
sponded," she said.
According to Madsen, one of the
goals of the negotiation team was to
reward those nurses with the most
seniority.
In anticipation of the strike,
Goodkind said the Hospital had
begun one of its contingency plans,
to cancel a small number of ad
missions of those patients who were
not seriously ill, a week before the
settlement. This plan, designed to re
duce patient load, resulted in five pa
tients a day being turned away, he
added.
Goodkind said that if the strike had
occurred it is likely that some pa
tients would have been moved to
nearby hospitals and more patients
would have been referred to other
hospitals. But he added, "There is ev
ery indication that we would have
continued quality care."
One provision of the contract
creates a Committee on Nursing
Practice to discuss professional issues
and standards.
The agreement, which is retro
active to March 1, ends the regular
negotiations that began Jan. 18.
