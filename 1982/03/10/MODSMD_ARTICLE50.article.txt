# ...And on the way out, slips on its own banana peel

Peter Shaffer's Black Comedy, playing at
the American Conservatory Theatre with a
companion one-act, Terence Rattigan's The
Browning Version, doesn't toliow the lines
of his later, more solemn, successes Equus
and Amadeus. The 1965 farce opens with ar
tist Brindsley Miller and his debutante girl
friend, Carol, chatting on a darkened stage
as they await the arrival of her disapproving
father and a multi-millionaire art-lover. Sud
denly a fuse blows, they curse, and the stage
lights switch on, signalling it's "dark " for the
characters. When someone lights a match,
the lights dim, and, when it invariably is
blown out, they brighten once more. During
the confusion, they're visited by Carol's
"monster father," Brindsley's looney neigh
bors, his vindicative former lover, and, final
ly, by the millionaire. During this, Brindsley
tries to keep his many secrets from coming to
light (in the dark, the point of the play), a task
at which he ultimately fails.
Shaffer's script is excruciatingly funny, but
any theater group attempting to stage it is
tempted to make it even funnier, by playing
up its opportunities for physical, slapstick
gags. Director James Edmondson decided to
approach it this way, and it played against
him, giving the play an amateurish look.
Within the first few minutes, he had poor
Thomas Harrison (Brindsley) flying over a
table, falling down stairs, and getting a con
nected telephone rammed into his crotch.
While Black Comedy calls fora good deal of

these physical punch lines, it's funny enough
by itslf that it doesn't need this crutch tc
"keep the action moving." The play began tc
pick up when these slapstick bits become
fewer and better staged, and worked espe
cially well in a scene in which Harrison fran
tically tried to return furniture he'd stolen
from his finicky gay neighbor, Harold, while
Harold was blindly sitting in the room, talk
ing to him.
In general, the acting was as overdone as
the action. When Jane Jones, as Clea,
Brindsley's former girlfriend, sneaked into
the room, every move she made was accom
panied by an elaborate mug. You saw her
pour whiskey on Carol and then saw her
look up, wide-eyed with glee, in case you
missed it. Sydney Walker, as Carol's father,
was guilty of the same thing. Although he
looked ideal for the part and he showed his
innate talent by deliveringsome linesexpert
ly, most of his time on stage was spent show
ing high school level facial expressions. Sur
prise! Anger! Bewilderment! They were all
there, and then some.
Harrison and Janice Garcia-Hutchins
showed more restraint, which worked to
their advantage. But they suffered from a
scene establishing they're in darkness that
seemed to have been blocked in a panic.
While Edmondson did have to convey the
play's gimmick to the audience, anyone in
true darkness who swings arms around as
wildly as thev did would frature 15 small

bones before the lights came back on. Har
rison's and Garcia-Hutchins' deliveries,
however, were right on, coming in on top of
one another in the clipped-off, British fash
ion.
Of the others, Bruce Williams played
Harold outrageously, but had an accent I
couldn't decipher; it sounded like Soho by
way of Ft. Worth. Mimi Carr looked and
sounded fine as Miss Furnival, the prudish

woman from upstairs who loses her inhibi
tions, but she also would have been much
more effective if her gestures, inflections,
and expressions were cut down. The same
went for William McKereghan's Shup
panzigh, the electrician mistaken for the mil
lionaire. Very funny, very fitting, but much
too broad.
It's surprising to me that Edmondson also
directed The Browning Version, since it's so
different. This play is slow to draw you in,
and, once it does, it's very subtle. It's the
quiet companion to Black Comedy's carnival

i barker. It's also well done in almost every
aspect.
Terence Rattigari said of the 1948 play, "If
today I had to justify my choice of career
before a heavenly jury, The Browning Ver
sion is the play I would want to represent
me." He centered the play on an incident in
his life in which a schoolmaster of his was
forced to resign in ridicule, with ill-health
and the knowledge that his teaching career
had been a failure even though he had been
a brilliant scholar. As a going-away present,

R.attigan presented him with a translation of
the teacher's favorite play, the Agamemnon,
one of the few acts of decency the master
had seen.
As Andrew Crocker-Harris, the teacher,
Raye Birk gave one of the most understated
and amazing performances I've ever seen on
the stage. He supplied the character with an
imperative dignity, without which he'd be
little more than a pitiable wimp. His slow
speech, his restraint, and his slow emotional
dissolvings must have taken weeks of
thought and practice to refine.
DeAnn Mears played his wife, Millie, a
bitch who "killed him years ago." I saw her
last year as the lead in ACT's Night and Day,
and I think she is much better here. In The
Browning Version she's pulled-in and icy,
evil without having to rage, where before
she was given more freedom to indulge in
broad theatrics. She has a scene here, where
she smothers Andrew's last glimmer of digni
ty, in which she's chilling.
Mark Murphey, Greg Patterson, and even
Sydney Walker (in a quick change) are equal
ly controlled, and all do well by their parts.
The only casting choice I question is that of
Isiah Whitlock, Jr. His accent (Jamaican?)
doesn't seem to fit in with what one would
expect from the charismatic young teacher
come to replace Crocker-Harris at the stately
British school.
