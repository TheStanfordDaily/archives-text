By the time No. 1 seeded
Stanford had waltzed to the
Women's National Indoor Te
nnis Tournament title in Ann
Arbor, Mich, last weekend,
Frank Brennan was beginning
to agree with tournament of
ficials.
By the time Stanford junior
Caryn Copeland walkedoff the
court with a clinching 6-4, 7-6
(11-9 tiebreaker) win over
Karen Huebner in No. 6 singles
of Sunday's final against UCLA,
she was the only one who
didn't know Stanford had won.
"I thought UCLA should
have maybe been seeded No. 1
going in," Stanford coach
Brennan said, "but I guess they
were right."
After Copeland's match
clinching win she said, "My
match was really close. I was
looking around at the other
courts to find out how we were
doing. I knew Linda (Gates) was
losing and I thought Tex (No. 1
player Alycia Moulton) lost.
When my tiebreaker was over I
walked off the court thinking

we had only won four and they
told me we had won."
Stanford's final match Sun
day, like their previous three
matches, were clinched after
the singles.
"Everything I thought could
have gone well this weekend
went well," Brennan said. "Ev
erybody played well — maybe
not as well as they could have
played — but certainly up to
their potential for this time of
the season. All of my older
players really came around.
Alycia played well, (Elise)
Burgin went undefeated,
freshman (Kate) Gompert only
lost one set in singles and went
undefeated, Gates beat two re
ally fine players in (Trinity's
Lisa) Sassano and went un
defeated and beat an All-
America in (UCLA's Kathy)
O'Brien, and Caryn played
good clutch tennis and won all
of her singles matches."
In Sunday's final, Moulton
snuck past UCLA's Kathrin Keil
7-6 (7-4 tiebreaker), 7-5.
Burgin, back down to No. 2 sin
gles after a big win over Trini

ty's Louise Allen in No. 1 singles
Friday, coasted by Shelley
Solomon 6-2, 6-4. Gompert
ripped Linda Lewis 6-0, 6-4, but
Gates dropped a tough 5-7, 4-6
decision to Heather Ludloff, a
All-America transfer from BYU.
Copeland wrapped up the
match with her three set win
over Huebner.
Stanford opened the eight
team tournament with a 9-0
trouncing of Clemson. The
•Cardinal then coasted by a
strong Trinity team with sur
prising ease 6-3, before coast
ing by Florida 9-0.
UCLA, playing in the other
bracket, came out of the round
robin preliminary round un
defeated to play Stanford in the
final.
"We were seeded No. 1 com
ing in so they expected us to
win," Brennan said. "We won
and did better than I ex
pected."
Stanford now has a two
week layoff for Dead Week and
finals before traveling south to
face USC and San Diego State
over Spring Break.
