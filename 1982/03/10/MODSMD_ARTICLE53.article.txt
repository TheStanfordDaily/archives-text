# Men whip Utah

### Sally Jenkins 
Utah limped into Stanford
nly to hobble out Friday asthe
tanford men's tennis team
?on its most important match
112 the winter season 7-2.
Stanford's first round oppo
ent in last year's NCAA cham
ionships, Utah is favored to
epeat its title as regional rep
esentative this year. But the
quad did not measure up Fri
day, as No. 1 seed Jeff Robbins
llayed with a bruised heel and
Lis teammates played like they
ivere taking a pop quiz.
"Overall it was a good ef
ort," said Stanford head coach
)ick Gould. "In fairness to
Jtah, they played a little tired,
"hey looked a little flat, so we
>ave to keep it in perspective."
And in all fairness to Utah,
he squad came to Stanford at
he end of a road trip that in
luded matches against the top
earns in California at USC,
JCLA, Pepperdine and Cal.
Stanford swept five of six sin
les matches in two hours, los
lg only five sets over the
ourse of the day. Gould made
is last preseason change in
loving No. 3 singles player Jeff
rons back to last year's posi
on of No. 4, and promoting
»hn Corse to the No. 3 spot, a
Biange that seemed to
■rengthen the squad.
■ "John has been playing bet-
Br," said Gould. "He's been
King a super job, and he de-
Brved a chance to play
higher."
■ Arons had an easier time at
No. 4 than he had in previous
Batches, beating Alan Barg in
pvo sets 6-4, 6-3. Barg ran hot
ahd cold, saving himself with a
series of backhand passing
shots when his forehand fell
asleep in the first set.
But it was his backhand that
deserted him in the second. He
broke Arons in the second
game to take a 1-3 lead, but the
Cardinal senior came back to
win the next five games and
put the match away.
Corse played tentatively in
his first set against John
Tsumas, but eventually
dragged Utah's No. 3 player
into the kind of endurance

contest he's best at. Corse
lulled Tsumas to sleep with
long baseline rallies to take the
first set 6-4, and held nothing
back in the second, winning
6-1.
Davis had the easiest time of
all with the injured Robbins.
He did everything but kick
Robbins in his sore heel, win
ning 6-1, 6-2 with every kind of
drop shot imaginable.
"The heel slowed me
down," said Robbins. "It's the
kind of thing that's there just
enough to throw you off. You
take advantage of that. He
moved me around and really
made me run for shots."
Utah's Greg Homes probably
should have been playing on
the No. 1 court as he ran
through Stanford's Scott Bond
urant in two sets 6-3, 6-3 at No.
2 singles. A junior Davis Cup
player, the freshman took ad
vantage of senior Bondurant's
sluggish serves to wrap things
up in little over an hour.
Stanford sophomore Mark
Mckeen felled Ed Heath in two
sets 6-3, 6-3, and freshman Paul
Robinson locked the match
away at No. 6 with a three set
victory over Beto Bloise.
In the doubles, Davis and
Arons defeated Robbins and
Holmes 6-3, 7-5, Bondurant
and Corse cruised to a 6-2, 6-2
win over Bloise and Brian
Monson, and McKeen and
Robinson lost to Heath and
Tsumas 3-6, 3-6.
