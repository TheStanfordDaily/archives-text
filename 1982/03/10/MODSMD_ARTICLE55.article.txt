Stanford and Florida will be
the top two contenders for the
first ever NCAA women's
swimming championship in
Gainsville, Fla., March
18-20.
The Gators, ranked first in a
NCAA coaches poll, feature
world record holder Tracy
Caulkins. The Cardinal is
ranked second and has quali
fied the maximum 17 swim
mers in 22 NCAA events.
"I think we rate pretty good
against Florida," Stanford
coach George Haines said.
"I'm not predicting that we will
win, but I'm saying that we
have a good chance."
Haines also pointed out that
Florida will have an advantage
swimming in their home pool
in front of their own fans.
Haines looks upon the free
style relays as being the key to
the title. "We have to win them
to counteract their
breaststroke power," he said.
Sophomore Anne Tweedy
leads the way for the Cardinal
having qualified in six individ
ual events, including all three

individual medley races.
Freshman Jenny Rapp also has
bettered NCAA marks in the
IM events as well as in the 200-
yard backstroke and butterfly.
Lisa Buese, another
freshman, has bested NCAA
cut-offs over the course of the
season in three butterfly races
and the 100 and 200 freestyles.
Backstroker Kim Carlisle also
qualified in five events, the 50,
100, and 200 backstrokes and
the 100 and 200 IMs.
Freshman Marybeth
Linzmeier, who holds national
bests in a number of events, is
entered in the 100, 200, 500,
and 1650 freestyles. Freshman
Isabel Reuss will swim in four
freestyle racewhile Stephanie
Elkins has qualified in three
freestyle events and the 200
backstroke.
Entered in three individual
events are Kelly Asplund, Sher
ri Hanna, Ellen Lewis and Pat
ty Spees. Krissie Bush, Barbara
Major, Claudia Schwartzer and
Libbie Beaudel have qualified
in two races apiece.
Mellisa Hoel and Kerry Neill
are also on the 17 member

squad. The 18th spot is
reserved for divers who will at
tempt to qualify this weekend.
The Cardinal has swimmers
entered in all five relays, the
200, 400, and 800 freestyles and
the 200 and 400 medley relays.
Seven Stanford swimmers
will race in both the 100 and 200
