# Card embarrassed in DiBiaso finale

Senior sports writer
Dick Dißiaso's fat e said it all.
Like a war-weary seargeant,
the Stanford coach forced the
words out of his mouth to the
group of huddled reporters
outside the Cardinal locker
room. California had just de
feated his team 78-59 in the
season finale for both schools
to drive Stanford's losing streak
to eight games last Saturday in
Berkeley's Harmon Gym.
After a few brief remarks,
Dißiaso stated, "This press con
ference is over." He then
turned and re-entered the
Stanford locker room for the
last time, ending a nightmarish
season in which the Cardinal
dropped 15 of their last 16
games.
There was reaily nothing for
the outgoing coach to say. The
script was written too perfectly
— from Cal's point of view.
•Consider the fact that the
win propelled Cal to 14-13,
marking their first winning sea
son since 1974-75, arid the first
ever for incumbent coach Dick
Kuchen.
•Consider the fact that Bear
center Mark McNamara,
playing in his final collegiate
contest, hit his first 10 field goal

attempts, allowing him to be
come only the second NCAA
player to shoot 70 percent from
the floor in a season, winning
him the Pacific-10 scoring title,
and netting him game-high
honors with 23 points.
•Consider the fact that
seldom-used Cal guard Tom
Lord got into the game and
provoked a thundering ova
tion when he followed his own
miss and scored off the re
bound for the first time all year.
It was, as they say, Berkeley's
day.
Jumping out to a 19-8 lead at
the outset, the Bears closed out
the half with an 18-10 spurt to
give them a 17-point edge at
the intermission, 44-27, and
seal the Cardinal's fate.
Stanford did manage to
creep to within 13 points with
12:47 remaining at 55-42, on
the strength of three John Rev
elli foul shots and a Johnny
Rogers turnaround jumper,
but it was as close as the
Cardinal would get. Senior
Brian Welch led Stanford with
15 points, despite being
hounded by the Cal student
section every time he touched
the ball.
