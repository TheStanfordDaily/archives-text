Kansas City, Mo. — NCAA
officials, breathing a sigh of re
lief over the lack of conference
tournament upsets, .believe
they've assembled the
strongest 48-team field ever for
their national basketball cham
pionship.
At the same time, Dave
Gavitt, commissioner of the Big
East Conference and chairman
of the NCAA Division I Basket
ball Committee, admitted Sun
day that the tournament did
not take in the nation's best 48
teams.
"But we're closer to having
the best 48 than in recent his
tory," Gavitt said in announc
ing the tournament pairings
and seedings on national tele
vision. "We did not get many
upset winners in post-season
tournaments at all."
By majority vote of NCAA
members, the committee is re
quired to give automatic invita
tions to the champions of 28
conferences, leaving 20 at
large invitations. Most con
ferences, in an effort to get as
many teams into the tour
nament as possible, stage post
season playoffs to determine

their automatic qualifier.
When teams that otherwise
would not be considered get
hot and win post-season tour
naments, the result can be dilu
tion of the field's overall
strength.
But Gavitt believes that is not
the case this year.
"This is the deepest and
strongest field we've ever
had," he said. "The word 'up
set' no longer applies in the
NCAA Tournament." In mak
ing the 20 at-large selections,
he added, "there were some
very close calls. Four or five
years ago, teams with nine de
feats, people would have said
didn't belong in the tour
nament. Last year, our cham
pion (Indiana) had nine
losses."
North Carolina, DePaul, Vir
ginia and Georgetown were
named the top seeds in the
four regionals. Geographically
speaking, top-ranked North
Carolina got the best deal and
Georgetown, ranked No. 8 in
The Associated Press Top 20,
got the worst.
North Carolina is the top
seed in the East Regional and
never would have to leave its

home state until the semifinals
in New Orleans. Georgetown
was assigned to the West Re
gional, about 3000 miles from
its Washington, D.C., campus.
Second-ranked DePaul is the
top seed in the Midwest, and
Virginia, ranked No. 3, is
seeded first in the Mideast.
Fourth-ranked Oregon State,
the Pacific 10 Conference
champion, is the No. 2 seed in
the West.
Among the more notable
teams left out and later picked
up by the National Invitational
Tournament were Bradley,
21-10; lona, 24-8; Nevada-Las
Vegas, 19-8, and San Diego
State, 20-8.
The top four seeds in each
region are given byes into the
second round. The regional
championships will be March
19-21 at Raleigh, N.C., in the
East and at St. Louis in the
Midwest. The semifinals and
finals in the Mideast will be
March 18-20 at Birmingham,
Ala., and March 18-20 in Provo,
Utah, in the West.
First-round games will be
played March 11-12 in all re
