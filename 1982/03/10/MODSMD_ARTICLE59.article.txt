# GREAT WRITING STARTS WITH A LITTLE LISTENING, A LITTLE BEER, AND A LOT Of LEGWORK.
## 
### Mickey Spillane 
When the guys at Miller asked me to
write an ad on writing, I said, "Forget it.
Not even if you held a gun to my head!' So
they held a bottle of Lite Beer to my mouth.
They're a pretty persuasive group.
THUGS TO MUGS
If you're going to write anything, know
what you're talking about. And that means
three things: Research, research, and
more research. The more you know, the
more you can \e\\ your reader.
Take my characters. A lot of them I
base on actual people. There's this buddy
of mine who pops up in every book I write.
In one story he's a cop. In another, a pri
vate eye. Once, I made him a millionaire.
Using him not only helped make character
development a heck of a lot easier, he was
so carried away by the rich image, he
bought me a lot of free dinners (and a lot of
Lite Beer from Miller). So use the people
you know as models.

Even locations should be based on
real things. If you're writing about a bar,
know that bar. Hang out there. Watch the
bartender. The customers. Whatever
they drink, you drink. When they drink
Lite Beer, you drink Lite Beer. Re
member-research is most fun when
you soak up as much subject matter as
you can. It can only help you paint a
better picture.
. HI. DOLL
No caper is complete without dames
(or ladies in proper English). Experience
has shown me that in mystery writing, the
sexier the dames, the better. Experience
has also shown me that sexy scenes make
great punctuation marks. This is where
research has the greatest potential. Use
your own discretion in this matter. But
when you write about it, don't be too
explicit. That way, your reader gets to paint
a more vivid picture.

CAPER TO PAPER
0.K., you've got your characters, loca
tions, and dames lined up. Now comes the
good part: Putting your caper to paper.
There's no mystery to it. As long as you
write the ending first, the rest will follow.
Write short, terse, to-the-point sentences.
Be as clear as possible. And make sure
you've got the right stuff around for when
you get thristy. After all, writing is pretty
* a coupie ui rnuys ui Lite
Beer- who ever heard of a caper that
didn't involve a couple of mugs?
Why Lite Beer? It's a lot like me and my
books-great taste, less filling (some
people can't get their fill of my books), and
always good to spend time with.
At any rate, follow my advice and, who
knows-you might turn out a heck of a
story. Or you might turn out to be a heck of
a Lite Beer drinker.
