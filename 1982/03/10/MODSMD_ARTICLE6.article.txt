# Row manager defends policies; refutes press
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
The recent energy conservation
experiment which turned off the
heat in many student residences
brought Heloisa Edwards, Row and
Cluster facilities office manager,
once again to the center of campus
controversy, provoking some stu
dents to call her policies heavy
handed and her statements to the
press unfair.
Yet others, including adminis
trators in the Housing Office, sup
port the first-year manager, saying
that her efforts have won the respect
of most of the students with whom
she works and contributed to signifi
cant improvements in many Univer
sity residences.
Edwards first gained attention last
fall after her proposal to inspect
rooms in Row and cluster residences
met with student opposition. The
plan was cancelled soon afterwards.
In December Edwards again be
came involved in controversy when
she discovered furniture in the Delta
Upsilon (DU) house that was similar
to descriptions of property reported
stolen from the Stanford Law School

in September. Members of the
fraternity were upset by Edwards'
role in assisting police to search the
house for possible contraband.
Two weeks ago, after implement
ing an energy conservation plan
which turned off the heating systems
in most Row and cluster houses for
one day, cold temperatures
prompted a flood of complaints and
Edwards turned the heat back on.
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, Edwards said the con
servation plan was "behavior mod
ification" designed to train students
"to put some clothes on their bodies
instead of running around in T-shirts,
cutoffs and no socks." She was also
quoted as saying that she had "better
things to do" than to respond to the
students' calls to turn on the heat.
Several students who saw her in
terviewed on a local television news
program said that Edwards called stu
dents here "spoiled children" be
cause they were unwilling to make
sacrifices in order to conserve
energy.
In an interview last week Edwards
denied some of the media accounts
of her statements.

"I would like to clear up the
Chronicle quote that I have 'bet
terthings to do' than to talk to stu
dents," she said. "I did not say that
and that was irresponsible journal
ism.
"Approximately 50 percent of my
time is spent talking with students
and helping students with problems.
Even the complaints I don't mind."
Edwards also denied saying that
students here are spoiled.
"I said that (implementing energy
conservation) was a difficult to

accomplish because it is behavior
modification and getting people to
change is difficult," she said.
However, some students said that
Edwards' remarks and her attempt to
modify their behavior were out of
place.
"She's not supposed to be a psych
teacher," said Jordan Bender, a DU
house resident, "she's supposed to
be a Row office manager. She has no
right to be trying experiments on the
houses."
Bender said that the television in
terview portrayed Edwards as "the
one-woman energy fighter of Stan
ford, putting the spoiled brats in their
place. That's not what was happen
ing. She decided that our windows
were being left open and she de
cided to punish us by turning off the
heat."
Howard Sewell, house manager for
the Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) house,
said that the comments he read in the
news stories did not match his ex
periences dealing with Edwards.
"I was very surprised at some of the
quotes and the way they came out,"
said Sfwpll "TIipv kind nf indimfpH a


Heloisa Edwards
'we're-out-to-get-them' attitude.
But those attitudes haven't been re
flected in my dealings with her."
The two Housing Office adminis
trators who work most closely with
Edwards supported her efforts to im
prove the residences, although both
were concerned with clarifying the
statements that have been attributed
to her.
"Her style is to operate quickly,
closely and very personally with peo
ple," said Terry McGovern, housing
facilities manager and Edwards' su
pervisor. "Generally I would say she's
been very successful with students."
"We may not always agree on the
way she phrases things," McGovern
said, "but I try to look at the whole
picture. I don't think it's fair to shoot
at people over one incident. Look at
the whole picture in context."
"Until she started working here,"

she continued, "it was.a constant
struggle to get the houses fixed up.
She has worked seven days a week
(last summer) to paint, fix and turn
over 37 fresh, nice-looking houses
for students to come back to."
Conklin was concerned, however,
that the news accounts gave the im
pression that Edwards is not as sensi
tive to the needs of students as she
should be.
"Those were very unfortunate,"
said Conklin, commenting on the
critical statements attributed to Ed
wards, "I didn't like reading those
and I didn't agree with them."
"What I think she needs to do,"
Bender said, "is sit down with the
house officers and discuss our house
needs and her pressures from the
University and decide together how
to run things."
Edwards said that she had learned
much from the heating experiment
and did not regret the idea, though
she will attempt to increase com
munication between her office and
residents in the future.
