Los Angeles — California Demo
crats at last weekend's convention at
the Los Angeles Hilton vowed to re
coup 1980 election losses and called
for party unity in order toavoid dom
ination by the well-financed Re
publican Party.
The party lashed out at President
Ronald Reagan's "scandalous" El
Salvador policies, comparing them to
the United States involvement in
Vietnam. Delegates voted to demand
negotiated settlements between the
U.S.-backed El Salvadoran govern
ment and guerilla forces.
The Salvadoran initiative was one
of many planks adopted at the three
day convention. The event aimed to
unify California Democrats prior to
the June primaries and November
general election. Speaker after
speaker told the 1500 attendees that
unless the party unites behind its
candidates, California will be led by
Republicans.
"We must mobilize and rebuild,"
Governor Jerry Rrown told the dele
gatos Saturday morning, in reference
to the Republican's 1980 landslide.
"The Republicans are proving, slow
ly, that what didn't work for Coolidge
or Hoover isn't working for Reagan."
Brown called Reagan's budget cuts
a bunch of "misguided oogie
woogie" and said the public is being
loci to believe that "all the pain is sup
posedly for long-term gain."
Despite Brown's call for unity, the
threat of party dissension dominated
the lackluster convention. Two of
Brown's challengers for the Demo
cratic U.S. Senate nomination were
among those who criticized the gov
ernor during their own campaign

speeches.
State Senator Paul Carpenter (D-
Cypress) and Fresno Mayor Dan
Whitehurst urged delegates to sup
port them in their Senate bids be
cause, they said, a Field poll indicates
Brown would lose the election to any
of the top three Republican Senate
candidates: Reps. Barry Goldwater
Jr., Paul "Pete" McCloskey and San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson.
Brown is expected to formally an
nounce his Senate candidacy tonight
at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel.
The event, advertised at the conven
tion, is open to the public at $25 a
person and promises the appearance
of "special celebrity guests."
Of the three gubernatorial can
didates — State Senator John Gar
amendi (D-Walnut Grove), Los An
geles Mayor Tom Bradley and Cali
fornia's former Secretary of Health
and Welfare Mario Obledo — only
Garamendi criticized Brown's per
formance as governor.
Fragmentation was also evident in
the Saturday itinerary when 12 dif
ferent caucus meetings were
squeezed into a four-hour period.
The meetings ranged from Hispanic
to Women's caucuses and from a
Gay/Lesbian caucus toa Businessand
Professional caucus.
The convention was also a cam
paign forum for U.S. Senator Alan
Cranston, who recently announced
his candidacy for the 1984 Presiden
tial race. Cranston and Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown were the most
warmly received speakers at the
event.
Cranston, the Senate Minority
Whin, is a rnnvpntinn.il anH firm-


Sen. Alan Cranston
voiced speaker. He urged the U.S. to
avoid a nuclear confrontation with
the Soviet Union, called for arms
control and said Reagan's "war on
poverty has become a war on the
poor."
Meanwhile, Brown was particular
ly critical of the Republican-spon
sored ballot initiative opposing the
reapportionment map recently ap
proved by the Democrat-controlled
Assembly and Senate.
"We drew a reapportionment plan
that reflects the interests of Califor
nia," Brown said. "It's a beautifully
drawn plan. It's a Picasso, not a Da
Vinci.
"When we started drawing the
map, we abided by all the rules," he
said. "And when you're doing it you
take care of your friends first and, if
there's anything left, you say to your
enemies: 'Divide it.'"
Brown also noted that while the
Republicans swept away the nation,
Californians elected a Democratic
majority in the state Senate and As
sembly. "Reagan is embarrassed that
in his own state he has less influence
than anyone else," Brown said.
He said California must continue
to vote Democratic to right the

wrongs of the Reagan adminis
tration. This would indicate "that we
know of the trickle-down theory and
who got tricked," Brown said pound
ing the podium."
Two unscheduled appearances at
the convention were made by former
California Governor Edmund "Pat"
Brown, Sr., who lauded his son, and
by Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther
King, jr.'s widow. King urged the del
egates at Saturday's luncheon to"get
fired up about what's going on in this
country" and register more Demo
cratic voters.
"Californians, you have to lead the
way because you gave us Ronald
Reagan," King said. "And you
know," she added with a smile,
"we'd love to retire him and give him
back."

Cypress) and Fresno Mayor Dan
Whitehurst urged delegates to sup
port them in their Senate bids be
cause, they said, a Field poll indicates
Brown would lose the election to any
of the top three Republican Senate
candidates: Reps. Barry Goldwater
Jr., Paul "Pete" McCloskey and San
Diego Mayor Pete Wilson.
Brown is expected to formally an
nounce his Senate candidacy tonight
at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel.
The event, advertised at the conven
tion, is open to the public at $25 a
person and promises the appearance
of "special celebrity guests."
Of the three gubernatorial can
didates — State Senator John Gar
amendi (D-Walnut Grove), Los An
geles Mayor Tom Bradley and Cali
fornia's former Secretary of Health
and Welfare Mario Obledo — only
Garamendi criticized Brown's per
formance as governor.
Fragmentation was also evident in
the Saturday itinerary when 12 dif
ferent caucus meetings were
squeezed into a four-hour period.
The meetings ranged from Hispanic
to Women's caucuses and from a
Gay/Lesbian caucus toa Businessand
Professional caucus.
The convention was also a cam
paign forum for U.S. Senator Alan
Cranston, who recently announced
his candidacy for the 1984 Presiden
tial race. Cranston and Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown were the most
warmly received speakers at the
event.
Cranston, the Senate Minority
Whin, is a rnnvpntinn.il anH firm-


Sen. Alan Cranston
voiced speaker. He urged the U.S. to
avoid a nuclear confrontation with
the Soviet Union, called for arms
control and said Reagan's "war on
poverty has become a war on the
poor."
Meanwhile, Brown was particular
ly critical of the Republican-spon
sored ballot initiative opposing the
reapportionment map recently ap
proved by the Democrat-controlled
Assembly and Senate.
"We drew a reapportionment plan
that reflects the interests of Califor
nia," Brown said. "It's a beautifully
drawn plan. It's a Picasso, not a Da
Vinci.
"When we started drawing the
map, we abided by all the rules," he
said. "And when you're doing it you
take care of your friends first and, if
there's anything left, you say to your
enemies: 'Divide it.'"
Brown also noted that while the
Republicans swept away the nation,
Californians elected a Democratic
majority in the state Senate and As
sembly. "Reagan is embarrassed that
in his own state he has less influence
than anyone else," Brown said.
He said California must continue
to vote Democratic to right the

wrongs of the Reagan adminis
tration. This would indicate "that we
know of the trickle-down theory and
who got tricked," Brown said pound
ing the podium."
Two unscheduled appearances at
the convention were made by former
California Governor Edmund "Pat"
Brown, Sr., who lauded his son, and
by Coretta Scott King, Martin Luther
King, jr.'s widow. King urged the del
egates at Saturday's luncheon to"get
fired up about what's going on in this
country" and register more Demo
cratic voters.
"Californians, you have to lead the
way because you gave us Ronald
Reagan," King said. "And you
know," she added with a smile,
"we'd love to retire him and give him
back."
Los Angeles — California Demo
crats at last weekend's convention at
the Los Angeles Hilton vowed to re
coup 1980 election losses and called
for party unity in order toavoid dom
ination by the well-financed Re
publican Party.
The party lashed out at President
Ronald Reagan's "scandalous" El
Salvador policies, comparing them to
the United States involvement in
Vietnam. Delegates voted to demand
negotiated settlements between the
U.S.-backed El Salvadoran govern
ment and guerilla forces.
The Salvadoran initiative was one
of many planks adopted at the three
day convention. The event aimed to
unify California Democrats prior to
the June primaries and November
general election. Speaker after
speaker told the 1500 attendees that
unless the party unites behind its
candidates, California will be led by
Republicans.
"We must mobilize and rebuild,"
Governor Jerry Rrown told the dele
gatos Saturday morning, in reference
to the Republican's 1980 landslide.
"The Republicans are proving, slow
ly, that what didn't work for Coolidge
or Hoover isn't working for Reagan."
Brown called Reagan's budget cuts
a bunch of "misguided oogie
woogie" and said the public is being
loci to believe that "all the pain is sup
posedly for long-term gain."
Despite Brown's call for unity, the
threat of party dissension dominated
the lackluster convention. Two of
Brown's challengers for the Demo
cratic U.S. Senate nomination were
among those who criticized the gov
ernor during their own campaign

speeches.
