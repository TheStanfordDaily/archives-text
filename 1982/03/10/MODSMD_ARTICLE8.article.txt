## Industry attacks Endangered Species Act 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Grizzly bears, bald eagles
and sundry other constituents from the po
litical wilds are back on the government's
agenda, and you might say hunting season
has opened.
The Endangered Species Act, designed
to protect imperiled flora and fauna from
man's bulldozers and oil rigs, is itself on
the endangered list, under the sharpest at
tack since it was enacted by Congress in
1973.
The act is up for reauthorization this
year, and industrial and development in
terests, buoyed by what they see as admin
istration sympathy to their cause, are prop
osing major changes to bring "balance" to
the law.
Critics have another term for it. "They
want to gut the act," said a congressional
observer.
But some conservationists fear that the
act is being eviscerated by the adminis
tration even before Congress gets a crack
at it.
Interior Secretary james Watt has asked
fora one-year extension of the act with
only minor changes, saying he wants time
to find administrative solutions to in
dustry's problems. Critics say the real rea
son for Interior's low profile on the re
authorization is that it wants to avoid a
potentially divisive political issue in an
election year.
Meanwhile, the budget for Interior's Of
fice of Endangered Species has been sliced

by more than 50 percent, from $4.1 million
to $1.9 million, forcing the office to cut
back on contracts for the biological studies
it uses to identify endangered species.
About 60 proposals for new listings un
der the act that have come in during the
Reagan administration are bottled up in
the solicitor general's office, awaiting
clearance under the Reagan adminis
tration's stringent rules for cost-benefit
analysis.
Only one species has made it through
the cost-benefit hoops — the Hays spring
amphipod, a tiny, shrimp-like creature in
itially proposed for listing during the
Carter administration. Considering that
the amphipod lives only in a spring in the
heart of Washington's National Zoo, con
servationists note archly, the adminis
tration could list it safely without offend
ing any industrial interest.
A major reason for the bottleneck, ac
cording to Ron Lambertson of the en
dangered-species office, is that the office
had no guidelines to determine the pos
sible benefit of, say, a Hays spring am
phipod, versus the cost of modifying or
scrapping development projects that
might destroy it.
Scientists point to important medical re
search done with certain plants — some of
them endangered — and argue that it is
not yet possible to determine the potential
value of some humble organisms.
Industry, however, sees the conflict in
more concrete terms, and it is mindful of

the tiny snail darter that held up the $120
million Tellico Dam for years until Con
gress granted an exemption from the act.
One of the changes in the act proposed
by industry associations, among them the
American Mining Congress and the Na
tional Forest Products Assocation, would
severely limit the listing of "lower forms of
life" — plants, insects and invertebrate
animals.
Interior's Lambertson says higher-life
forms get priority in his office as well, all
other factors being equal, albeit under a
different rationale. By protecting the habi
tat of a higher-life form, such as the grizzly
bear, he says, "you're protecting lower life
forms as well."
Another industry proposal would re
move the grizzly bear, along with other
popular species such as the bald eagle and
the sea otter, from the protection of the
act, on the grounds that the animals are
abundant in Alaska and there is no need to
"conflict with other national needs" by
protecting them in the lower 48 states.
The Endangered Species Act Re
authorization Coordinating Committee, a
coalition of environmental and conserva
tion groups, says that of 9686 consultations
conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service in the last three years, only 185 led
to preliminary findings that a proposed
project would jeopardize a protected
species.
