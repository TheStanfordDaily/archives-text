Two unexpected reversals — the
first Council of Presidents (COP) veto
this academic year and the impend
ing resignation of the Association's
student financial manager designee

— have forced the ASSU to backtrack
and begin two complicated proc
esses all over again.
The COP vetoed on March 12 an
ASSU Senate bill that would have

placed two constitutional amend
ments dealing with fee assessment
reforms on the spring ballot for ap
proval by the student body.
And current Student Financial
Manager (SFM) Cynthia Mathewson
told the Daily last night that Victor
Hymes, the recently appointed as
sociate student financial manager
(Associate SFM), had told her he was
planning to resign. The Associate
SFM has traditionally been ap
pointed to the full SFM post by the
senate at the end of the year. Hymes
refused to comment last night on the

possibility of his resignation.
Although the COP veto leaves the
issue of fee assessment reform off the
ballot for the time being, the COP say
theyt hope that the senate will put
the question of fee assessment refun
dability to the student body in the
form of a referendum, according to
Senate Chair Dave Phelps. Phelps
said the COP hopes that the reform
favored by the students — either a
mandatory or a refundable system —
will then be incorporated in the form
of a constitutional amendment. This
proposed amendment would in turn

be voted on by the students during a
runoff election to be held two weeks
after the general election.
The senate had voted to put the
two amendments on the ballot as a
compromise measure after extensive
debate at the last senate meeting
demonstrated that senators were
deadlocked over the issue of the re
fundability of fee assessments.
At the March 9 meeting, the sena
tors finally agreed to place two pro
posed amendments on the ballot,
one containing reforms that were
generally agreed upon and the other

offering the students the choice of a
non-refundable system, a system re
stricting refunds to students who
voted in the election in which the
assessments were authorized, in ad
dition to the current system.
However, the practice of offering
three alternatives within the same
amendment posed several problems.
In order for one of the alternatives to
pass, it would need to get twice as
many affirmative votes as both of the
other alternatives combined.
According to COP member Chris
Greene, the COP was afraid that

neither the non-refundable system
nor the restricted-refund system
would garner enough votes to pass. If
neither alternative passed, the cur
rent system would be maintained —
an option that Greene said was unac
ceptable to the COP.
"There area lot of different parts of
the current fee assessment system
that need to be changed," he said.
He said the COP enacted the
vetoes "almost in a cooperative way
with the senators" because most sen
ators realized that the constitutional
amendments proposed by the senate
were confusing.
"When we woke up the next morn
ing, senators on both sides of the is
sue felt that this was not the best way
to present the issue to the student
body," Greene said.
Three of the four members of the
COP are needed to veto senate ac
tion. Since COP member Mariarin
Byerwalter was at Lake Tahoe when
the veto deadline approached, she
did not sign the veto. However,
Greene said Byerwalter concurred
with the action taken by COP mem
bers Greene, Dragan Popov and Fred
Buhl.
"It (the veto) was something that

all four of us agreed we should do,"
he said.
Soon after the veto, some ASSU of- ,
ficeholders were startled by rumors j
that Hymes would resign. As early as
finals week, Mathewson, the current
SFM, told a Daily reporter that Hymes
would resign to accept a lucarative
job offer in New York.
Mathewson, said last night that
Hymes had told her he was planning
to resign. Mathewson said that she
had heen tpntativplv nffp-prj
position, but that she had turnecf id
down because she will be running a c><
a member of a COP slate in the up
coming election.
If Hymes does resign, the ASSU
may have to form another selection
committee to search for the next
SFM.
