## Radio station struggling, but looking to its future 
### Melissa Ignacio 
Operating on a yearly budget of about
$40,000 a year, KZSU, Stanford's student run
radio station, strives to put together quality
programming as well as providing a place for
students to get pre-professional training.
Relying mainly on fee assessments for fun
ding, KZSU has had to cut its budget by 40
percent this quarter because of the large
number of students who received refunds
from the ASSU winter quarter.
"Our life and death depends on fee
assessments," said Program Director
Michael Maroney. "I hope we can wake up
some of the students and make them realize
that the money cutbacks will really hurt this
station if it continues in the future."
News Director Kelly Moran added, "We
rely on our audio-equipment a lot, and
when it breaks down it affects our work.
Now that we don't have as much funding it
will hurt more."
Moran noted that if the money cutbacks
continue, it could mean serious impairment
to the station.
According to Maroney, however, KZSU
will be able "to make ends meet" despite the

fee assessment cutback. "Of course we need
the money that was cut, but a lot of improve
ments can be made that are not dependent
on money, but on people coming in and put
ting in the work."
A 500-watt station, KZSU is licensed by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
as an educational radio station and therefore
cannot advertise commercials for financing.
Being non-commercial provides for much
more freedom and creativity in the station
according to station workers.
"There is no structured format at KZSU as
far as programming is concerned," said Sta
tion Manager Max Ball. "Since no one is get
ting paid to be here, the reward is getting to
set up your own program on the air."
"Not being dependent on advertising
contributes to having greater freedom in
what we produce," commented Maroney.
Promotions Director Paul Salazar added,
"We're not operating on a money basis. This
gives us a chance to explore so many dif
ferent ways of doing things. It gives me a
chance to do things without fear. We don't
have to worry about pleasing sponsors by
playing music that sells."

Maroney, a senior who has been at KZSU
for four years, said, "We are a pure form of
radio. We are also at the extreme form of ra
dio. The music we play is total ly unrestricted.
No other radio station does this that I know
of."
KZSU's programming has matured from
broadcasting Food Service menus in the
1950s to a combination of various educa
tional and musical programs. Special pro
grams today include Album Week, Music
Meal and Open Files.
"We strive to be different from the KMEL's
and KSJO's. We need to offer something
they can't and the best thing we offer is di
verse, new and exciting music," said Ball.
As program director, Maroney said that
music is the primary function of KZSU. De
pending on the disc jockey's preference,
KZSU's repertoire consists primarily of rock
and roll, jazz, new wave and reggae. KZSU's
music library contains more than 8000 dif
ferent titles.
Maroney maintains that radio has always
been the support structure to the music in
dustry.

"New and different music is our aura," he
said. "However we do have other important
functions and responsibilities as an educa
tional station."
One of the functions of being an educa
tional station is devoting a significant
amount of work to public affairs. Under the
direction of sophomore Ellen Nerenberg,
KZSU has public affairs programs broad
casting from 7-8 p.m.Sunday through Thurs
day. Campus Conference is on Monday
nights and features such campus person
alities as Donald Kennedy and Fred
Hargadon. The Palo Alto City Council meet
ing are also broadcast on Monday evenings.
"Rising Again/' a politically oriented pro
gram airs on Tuesday nights. On Wednes
days KZSU broadcasts a series of programs:
"Community Forum," "Speak Out" and
"Punching In," a labor-oriented show.
"The program I take full responsibility for
is 'America Now' which is on Thursday
nights," said Nerenberg.
Just started this quarter, "America Now"
interviews guest speakers in the light of the
issues in America today. Featured guests
have included poet Adrienne Rich and writ
er John FHawkes.
Nerenberg said she sees her staff as being
"tremendously hard-working" which has
improved the quality of the public affairs
programs. She also noted that the quality of
programming is due largely to the stronger
organization in KZSU as a whole.
"We were very loosely structured before
and now there is a definite hierarchy in most
departments. The station is tightening up,"
said Nerenberg.
KZSU's more unified organization is the
product of long planning over several years.
"When I took over as program director I
had a definite strategy worked out," said
Maroney. "One of my aims was to get more
dedicated students." Last summer, Maroney
organized a summer workshop for new peo
ple to gain experience with the station's pro
cedures.
Moran, a senior who started at KZSU as a
sophomore said, "KZSU has progressed im
mensely through the years. When I first
started at the station it was more loosely run.
Everyone did their own thing. Now there's a
lot of interaction between the department
heads. Everyone wants everything to go
smoothly."
The biggest problem at KZSU is that there
is a 30 percent turnover of staff each quarter,
said Ball. Ball's goal is to give KZSU a solid
structure so it can survive from year to year.
"We want continuity and this can be
achieved through organized structure," he
said.
/\ new training program was instituted for
the first time this year. Nerenberg explained
that "training is where all the organization in
the station begins."
"We train new people not to make our
mistakes and teach them what works," she
said.
New staff members attend one two-hour
class per week for eight weeks and learn the
basic procedures of running a radio station.
The promotions department, guided by
Salazar, is trying to break out of its "low pro
file." One attempt to do so involved setting

up "KZSU Live at Field Day" during
Freshman Orientation this year. Music was
broadcast over loudspeakers and a live re
mote microphone was hooked up to the
KZSU radio station.
"At least freshmen would know that a
Stanford radio station existed," he said.
Another step Salazar has taken is "attack
ing the campus" with fliers in dorms and
cafeterias.
"We want to make students aware of
what's available at the station," Salazar said.
"Our public affairs for instance, merits a lot â€¢
of attention and and deserves promotion."
In addition to public affairs, KZSU delivers
local and national news. The broadcasts are
at 6, 7, and 8 p.m., Monday through Friday
and at 5 and 6 p.m.on Saturday and Sunday.
KZSU also provides live sports coverage of all
Stanford football and basketball games as
well as other sports.
As far as improving KZSU, Moran said she
sees the University as not being very atten
tive to the station.
"I think that the University hasn't done too
much for us. I think it's good that we have
the freedom, but it would be nice if the Uni
versity supported us more because it would
give us reliable economic support and en
courage more students to join the station,"
Moran said.
Many managers at KZSU have worked
more than 40 hours a week at the station, but
no credit is offered nor can they legally be
paid. "Everyone is strictly volunteer," said
Maroney.
Nerenberg added that she would like to
see some sort of alliance with the com
munication department. "We could get
more funds and our work could be acknowl
edged as worth maybe a unit or two," she
said.
KZSU's financial future is dependent on
University support. No matter how or
ganized and efficient the station man
agement is, KZSU still depends on fee
assessments to produce quality program
ming over the air.
The University has responded to KZSU by
forming a Board of Directors which will con
sist of faculty, students and some University
administrators. KZSU management hopes
that a Board of Directors would result in a
closer understanding of KZSU's needs and
problems. Vet the Board has been over two
years in the making and still has not material
ized.
Despite the lack of University support,
KZSU still provides services to students and
the community. Accomodating the students
who work at KZSU and accomodating the
audience is part of the dual function of the
radio station.
"We play some bizarre stuff, but we want
to keep our music loose and open,"
Maroney said. "We could get more listeners
if we wanted to, but we have to be respon
sible to our students."
"There is no other station like KZSU," em
phasized Maroney, "There is a certain mys
tique about this station. There are times
when we are so unprofessional and things go
wrong, but people forgive us because we
play good music and the music is magic."
