# ASSU guest professors
## In search of those extra special guests 
### Kathy Olmsted 
Would you like to take an acting class from Paul
Newman? What about a seminar on the American
presidency from Richard Nixon? Or would a jazz
course taught by Chuck Mangione be more to your
taste?
Newman, Nixonand Mangionearejusta fewofthe
long list of writers, actors, poets, journalists, musi
cians, politicians and other dignitaries invited by the
ASSU Guest Professorship Board to teach here for a
few days or for a quarter. Most of the invitations ex
tended are declined, but Guest Professorship Board
Chair Luke Cole said some interesting people are
considering teaching here.
According to Cole, the Board is presently nego
tiating with Writer John Cheever for a guest pro
fessorship spot next fall. The Board is also attempting
to interest Poet Allen Ginsberg and former President
Gerald Ford in teaching here sometime in the next
few years, but Cole said it would be "premature" to
speculate on the outcome of these negotiations.
Most of the people invited by the Guest Pro

fessorship Board have such busy schedules that it is
difficult for them to take the time to teach here. As a
consequence, the Board has received some very un
usual refusals.
Referring to the unenthusiastic reception students
here gave Guest Prof, john Anderson last spring,
Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau said he didn't
think he could "bear to suffer John Anderson's fate at
the hands of your students."
Radio Talk Show Host Larry King, on the other
hand, thought since he had "never gone to college it
would be an honor to be a visiting professor." King's
show, however, proved too costly to bring here.
National Football League Commissioner Pete
Rozelle said "negotiations coming up for television
contracts and the player bargaining agreement,"
among other things, prohibited him from making
speaking commitments.
Children's writer Theodor Seuss Geisel, otherwise
known as Dr. Seuss, declined the Board's invitation to
lecture here because of obligations "in the various
branches of the Green Egg Factory."

Cole said the number of qualified people who ac
cept invitations to be guest professors here from year
to year depends a lot on luck.
"Some years we have a good year with a lot of
positive replies," he said. "But sometimes we have a
bad year when we get next to no positive replies."
Cole said the Board sent more guest professorship
invitations this year than it had in any previous year,
but the gloomy economic outlook led to a high re
fusal rate.
Former President Jimmy Carter, Chrysler Chairman
Lee lacocca and NBC anchorman David Brinkley de
clined the Board's offers to speak here. Nixon, Man
gione, Newman, former vice-president Walter Mon
dale and actor Alan Alda are among those who have
not yet responded.
The Board has met with some success. Cartoonist
Bill Griffith accepted a two-day teaching stint last
month and Catharine MacKinnon will be a Guest Pro
fessor this spring quarter.
