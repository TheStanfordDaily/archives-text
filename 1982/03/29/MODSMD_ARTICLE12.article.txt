## Robotics revolution healthy 
### 
If you think yet another 10 weeks of class has got you
down, consider the plight of the United Auto Workers
union. While we Stanford students worry about our
GPA's, the UAW is faced with the choice of losing jobs to
either robots in Japan or to robots in the USA. Being the
patriotic type, the union will probably choose the latter.
Currently, half of this nation's 5000 industrial robots
are owned by the auto industry and there are more on
the way. General Motors, which has 450 robots now
wants to expand to 14,000 robots by 1990. One forecast
has estimated that 20 percent of the jobs in the auto in
dustry will be done by computer controlled machines in
1985.
The arguments for robots is clear. They can work 24
hours a day, seven days a week and don't demand over
time. There is no variation in the quality of the machine's
work; no Monday morning blahs; and they never go on
strike. In addition, Detroit is feeling the pinch from
Japan. While productivity in the US has grown at a rate of
only one percent per year since the late 70s, the Japanese
have been hitting seven percent every year.
Some people would argue that the union has created
theirown troubles byaskingfortoomuchatthe bargain
ing table. The auto companies have been whining a lot
lately about their labor costs being 20 to 30 percent more
than what Toyota must pay in Japan. What they don't
publicize is that their executive costs are between eight
and 10 times those of their Japanese competitors. Man
agement has been too generous all the way around.
The problems of the auto industry slapped me in the
face last year when I had the chance to see our tax dollars
at work at Chrysler's assembly plant outside St. Louis.
(This is the one of which Lee lacocca is so proud). I stood
with my jaw hanging open as I watched eight com
puterized welders spray sparks everwhere while zapping
sheet metal into a Chrysler Leßaron. It was impressive,
but I was shocked that so little of the assembly process
was using robots. I was equally shocked when I learned
that everyone there had at least 17 years of experience.
Those with less had been laid off indefinitely. A week lat
er, workers at the Chrysler Truck plant next door voted
to forego a previously granted wage increase. It was a
meaningless concession as the plant had been idle for
more than eight months.
One has to wonder what good robots will be if they
create an army of unemployed workers. Despite all their
features no robot has ever bought a car.
But will the so-called "robotics revolution" really
bring on massive unemployment? Are we heading for a
society resembling that in Vonnegut's Player Piano
where engineers have invented a machine for every task
save their own and are busy working on that?
Part of the problem with the revolution is that no one

seems to know what is going to happen. A recent article
in the Jan., 1982 issue of Black Enterprise cited a predic
tion that robots would displace one million workers by
1990. The article also quoted a spokesman for the robot
ics industry who felt that with adequate retraining, only
22,000 workers would be left looking for a job during the
same period.
Stanford mechanical engineering professor Bernard
Roth, a robotics researcher, wonders if the effects of ro
bots in industry may not be as revolutionary as some
would believe. He cites the case of numerically-con
trolledmachines which use coded tapes instead of hu
mans to direct the movements of a machine (usually a
lathe or drill) and are roughly analogous to a player pi
ano. While the technology has been around for 25 years,
it has penetrated only four percent of the market. Things
move slowly in the "real world."
Prof. Nathan Rosenberg of the economic department
echoes Roth's doubts about an explosion of robots in
American industry. He wonders if robots may not be
"another solar energy" — something that may be de
sirable but not economical except in limited applica
tions. Rosenberg also feels the utilization of robots will
be a strong function of the economy. If things are expan
ding it will be a lot easier for management to get worker
acceptance of the machines. When things are bad, a ro
bot becomes the enemy of a wage earner.
Perhaps some of the commotion surrounding any talk
about robots comes from the use of the word robot.
Most people immediately conjure upan image of some
thing like the Tin Man from Oz when you say "robot."
The technology has not got that far yet. The machines l
saw at Chrysler looked more like mutations of a dentist's
x-ray machine than Star Wars' R2D2. Scientists are far
from developing an independent or "universal" robot
and many experts feel most industrial tasks can be per
formed by less complex robotic systems.
I believe today's robots can be helpful to the economy
if we use them with discretion. The machines can be
used to remove people from dangerous and unpleasant
jobs such as spray painting and working around blast
furnaces. There is also historical evidence that new tech
nologies create more jobs than they displace. The most
spectacular example is that of the booming computer in
dustry.
Unfortunately, the jobs that are created are not neces
sarily filled by those who have been displaced. Man
agement and labor must cooperate to insure that retrain
ing is available for those who want it and care must be
taken in designing the automated systems so they are
used to improve job enhancement rather than making
the job more monotonous.
In conclusion, while the much-proclaimed robotics
revolution is not going to entail an invasion of our fac
tories by electronic androids, it does have the potential
to improve not only the country's productivity but also
make the American factory a healthier and more en
joyable place to work. It will also put an increased pre
mium on computer-oriented skills while putting a penal
ty on those classified as unskilled. Food thought while

features no robot has ever bought a car.
But will the so-called "robotics revolution" really
bring on massive unemployment? Are we heading for a
society resembling that in Vonnegut's Player Piano
where engineers have invented a machine for every task
save their own and are busy working on that?
Part of the problem with the revolution is that no one

seems to know what is going to happen. A recent article
in the Jan., 1982 issue of Black Enterprise cited a predic
tion that robots would displace one million workers by
1990. The article also quoted a spokesman for the robot
ics industry who felt that with adequate retraining, only
22,000 workers would be left looking for a job during the
same period.
Stanford mechanical engineering professor Bernard
Roth, a robotics researcher, wonders if the effects of ro
bots in industry may not be as revolutionary as some
would believe. He cites the case of numerically-con
trolledmachines which use coded tapes instead of hu
mans to direct the movements of a machine (usually a
lathe or drill) and are roughly analogous to a player pi
ano. While the technology has been around for 25 years,
it has penetrated only four percent of the market. Things
move slowly in the "real world."
Prof. Nathan Rosenberg of the economic department
echoes Roth's doubts about an explosion of robots in
American industry. He wonders if robots may not be
"another solar energy" — something that may be de
sirable but not economical except in limited applica
tions. Rosenberg also feels the utilization of robots will
be a strong function of the economy. If things are expan
ding it will be a lot easier for management to get worker
acceptance of the machines. When things are bad, a ro
bot becomes the enemy of a wage earner.
Perhaps some of the commotion surrounding any talk
about robots comes from the use of the word robot.
Most people immediately conjure upan image of some
thing like the Tin Man from Oz when you say "robot."
The technology has not got that far yet. The machines l
saw at Chrysler looked more like mutations of a dentist's
x-ray machine than Star Wars' R2D2. Scientists are far
from developing an independent or "universal" robot
and many experts feel most industrial tasks can be per
formed by less complex robotic systems.
I believe today's robots can be helpful to the economy
if we use them with discretion. The machines can be
used to remove people from dangerous and unpleasant
jobs such as spray painting and working around blast
furnaces. There is also historical evidence that new tech
nologies create more jobs than they displace. The most
spectacular example is that of the booming computer in
dustry.
Unfortunately, the jobs that are created are not neces
sarily filled by those who have been displaced. Man
agement and labor must cooperate to insure that retrain
ing is available for those who want it and care must be
taken in designing the automated systems so they are
used to improve job enhancement rather than making
the job more monotonous.
In conclusion, while the much-proclaimed robotics
revolution is not going to entail an invasion of our fac
tories by electronic androids, it does have the potential
to improve not only the country's productivity but also
make the American factory a healthier and more en
joyable place to work. It will also put an increased pre
mium on computer-oriented skills while putting a penal
ty on those classified as unskilled. Food thought while

If you think yet another 10 weeks of class has got you
down, consider the plight of the United Auto Workers
union. While we Stanford students worry about our
GPA's, the UAW is faced with the choice of losing jobs to
either robots in Japan or to robots in the USA. Being the
patriotic type, the union will probably choose the latter.
Currently, half of this nation's 5000 industrial robots
are owned by the auto industry and there are more on
the way. General Motors, which has 450 robots now
wants to expand to 14,000 robots by 1990. One forecast
has estimated that 20 percent of the jobs in the auto in
dustry will be done by computer controlled machines in
1985.
The arguments for robots is clear. They can work 24
hours a day, seven days a week and don't demand over
time. There is no variation in the quality of the machine's
work; no Monday morning blahs; and they never go on
strike. In addition, Detroit is feeling the pinch from
Japan. While productivity in the US has grown at a rate of
only one percent per year since the late 70s, the Japanese
have been hitting seven percent every year.
Some people would argue that the union has created
theirown troubles byaskingfortoomuchatthe bargain
ing table. The auto companies have been whining a lot
lately about their labor costs being 20 to 30 percent more
than what Toyota must pay in Japan. What they don't
publicize is that their executive costs are between eight
and 10 times those of their Japanese competitors. Man
agement has been too generous all the way around.
The problems of the auto industry slapped me in the
face last year when I had the chance to see our tax dollars
at work at Chrysler's assembly plant outside St. Louis.
(This is the one of which Lee lacocca is so proud). I stood
with my jaw hanging open as I watched eight com
puterized welders spray sparks everwhere while zapping
sheet metal into a Chrysler Leßaron. It was impressive,
but I was shocked that so little of the assembly process
was using robots. I was equally shocked when I learned
that everyone there had at least 17 years of experience.
Those with less had been laid off indefinitely. A week lat
er, workers at the Chrysler Truck plant next door voted
to forego a previously granted wage increase. It was a
meaningless concession as the plant had been idle for
more than eight months.
