## Faculty find on-campus property hard to buy 
### 
First, there is the issue of existing
housing on Stanford land, housing
which was clearly built with the ori
ginal intent of providing convenient
and affordable homes for Stanford
faculty. Unfortunately, the University
has over the years permitted the
prices of these homes to rise along
with the general market in the area. I
recently was sent a flyer by the cam
pus housing office, in which I noted
that the cheapest house now avail
able on campus is on the market for
$290,000. It is clear that no faculty
member solely dependent on a Stan
ford salary could qualify for purchase
of such a house.
It also seems clear to me that the
maximum prices of houses on Stan
ford land should have been held to
an index proportional to the salaries
paid to faculty. This would clearly
seem appropriate, since the object of
building these homes in the first
place was to provide faculty af
fordable housing on a continuing
basis, not to provide any particular
generation of Stanford homeowners
with a financial bonanza.
At this point, I would expect that
many people (with the noteable ex
ception of the Long-term Stanford
Land Homeowners Association)
would agree that limiting price in
creases on existing Stanford homes
would have been a good idea, but it's
too late to do anything now (bolting
the barn d00r... etc.). The obvious
guiding principles should be that
Stanford should sell newly-con
structed housing at the lowest pos
sible price and that future resale
prices of such housing should be lim
ited by a salary-related index as I have
suggested above.

Let us examine whether Stanford
appears to be learning from past ex
perience in the sale and future plans
for its latest faculty housing project,
the Peter Coutts Condominiums. I
was in the lottery by which these
units were awarded, but decided not
to buy when it was confirmed that
the average price for a unit in this de
velopment was going to be approx
imately $180,000. When I inquired as
to why the prices are at this level, I
was informed by the housing office
that the units are being sold at "mar
ket prices." In other words, the units
are priced so as to be competitive
with existing units in the area around
the campus, which we all know are
among the highest in the nation.
Such a comparison of prices isn't real
ly valid, since a very major part of the
purchase price of units in surround
ing areas reflects the inflated value of
the land on which they are built; the
Stanford units are, of course, on Stan
ford lease land.
In any case, if Stanford's goal is re
ally to make housing affordable for
its faculty, the prices of these units
should be determined or l, the ac
tual construction costs of the individ
ual units, rather than reflecting local
"market" prices. I would suspect, un
less Stanford really overpaid for the
construction of these units, that the
University stands to make a con
siderable profit by their sale. This
would be clearly inconsistent with
the goal of providing faculty housing
at the lowest possible cost.
And what about the future prices
of these units? To the best of my
knowledge, their resale prices will be
left free to soar even further beyond

the level affordable by a typical Stan
ford faculty member. History will be
free to repeat itself.
The University has stated that the
recruiting of excellent faculty will
suffer if it does not take steps to
enable new faculty members to buy
homes. There are very serious defi
ciencies in Stanford's past and cur
rent programs to meet this need. In
addition to a lack of foresight on the
part of responsible university of
ficials, it would appear that the prob
lems result from the unwillingness of
the University to accept any signifi
cant sacrifices in behalf of its stated
goal of affordable housing. It seems
to me that the overriding concern in
designing the above programs has
been ensuring the financial welfare
of the University, rather than provid
ing affordable housing for faculty.
When I recently criticized some of
the features of the COIN loan to an
official partly responsible for the pro
gram, I was informed that the pro
gram was "not a giveaway." This is
just the point â€” if the University is re
ally serious about helping faculty val
ue away in order to provide real as
sistance. I believe this could be
achieved in a number of ways which
follow from the above criticisms of
current programs. To begin with,
Stanford can use an invaluable re
source, its land (on a leased basis), to
build additional faculty housing for

which faculty are charged only the
actual cost of housing construction.
Alternatively, the University could
make improved lots available on
campus, at only the cost of such im
provements, so that faculty could
construct their own homes. It should
clearly be understood that the future
resale prices of these homes above
the costs of their construction and
subsequent improvement would be
pegged to an index of Stanford
salaries; if anyone wants to speculate
in real estate they would have to do it
somewhere else than in Stanford fac
ulty housing.
For individuals wanting to
purchase property off campus, I
think that the University should sim
ply provide conventional fixed or
variable rate mortgage money at a
substantial discount from prevailing
rates. Such a program would seem
much more attractive than the COIN
loan program, which appears unnec
essarily complex and restrictive; the
COIN interest rate of 25 percent also
seems unjustifiably high. If Stanford
is not prepared to employ some of its
land and financial resources to help
in a realistic manner with what is real
ly a crisis in housing for new faculty, I
think the half-baked inadequate pro
grams in place at present will provide
only very marginal assistance.
