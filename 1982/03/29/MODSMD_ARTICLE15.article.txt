## Deficient deferment forms 
### 
Each quarter, thousands of Stan
ford students who wish to defer tui
tion and dorm rent payments fill out
and sign the University's "Tuition
and Room Deferment" form. Un
fortunately, it appears that this form
does not meet the requirements of
the Federal Truth in Lending Act, the
law which governs these types of
transactions. Among the form's many
apparent deficiencies is its failure to
state the finance charge in terms of
an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or
to provide for periodic bills to be sent
to students.
The law also seems to provide that
when a "lender" (in this case the Uni
versity) fails to comply with one of
the Act's requirements, the "bor
rower" (in this case the deferring stu
dent) can collect from the lender a
civil penalty of twice the finance

charge (with a minimum recovery of
$100) plus attorney's fees and other
costs of collecting the penalty.
The University's deferment form
appears to be deficient in other ways
as well. For example, the "minimum
finance charge" may be applied to
very minor underpayments. If a stu
dent were charged $5 "minimum fi
nance charge" on a $10 payment that
was only a few days late, a practice we
understand to be fairly common, se
rious questions could be raised un
der California's usury statutes.
We hope the University will recog
nize and act upon its obligation to
obey the laws more closely in the
future.
