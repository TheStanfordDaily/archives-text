## Faithless tail end of the baby boom

Washington — Those weren't sim
ply 5000 spoiled brats on Capitol Hill
last week protesting Ronald Reagan's
proposed custs in federal aid to
higher education.
While college students have rea
son to be angry with Reagan, the
front page photographs of protesters
carrying "BOOKS, NOT BOMBS"
placards tell only half the story. Many
students, such as Harvard's John Ric
cardi, are bewildered on a number of
fronts. For Riccardi's peers, Reagan's
decisions to reduce the govern
ment's educational commitment is
only the most disturbing develop
ment.
"On one hand, we're told to have
faith in this administration's inten
tions," said Riccardi, a 20-year-old
Long Island native. "Yet we receive
little encouragement to do so on the
other. We're told to think about gov
ernment differently, but the adminis
tration is making it harder — not eas
ier — to do so."
Riccardi belongs to the trailing
edge of the nation's post-war baby
boom, the mysterious runt of the 70-
million-member little born between
1945 and 1965. Like many of his
friends, ' he was weaned on John
Belushi, New Wave music and peace

time draft registration. Judging from
freshman surveys and campus
bestseller lists, these students are
even more career-oriented, con
forming and conservative than their
older brothers and sisters.
Social scientists and journalists
have linked these traits to
diminishing expectations. But we
doubt that it's all so simple. To be
sure, the "student lobbyists" cm

screaming about the one cut that
would affect them most.
But the "bottom boomers" are fin
ding fault with other administration
policies.
Take foreign affairs. Even to some
one who only scans the graphics in
Newsweek, the world outside grows
more intricate by the day. Given the
multitudinous interests of different
nations, students of all disciplines can
only wonder why the United States
still fosters an expedient "all brawn,
no brains" approach to global prob
lem-solving. Many see no place for
themselves in such a system, so they
ignore global concerns altogether.
Closer to home, short-term think
ing by the government also leads stu
dents to shake their heads. The
younger generation can't see the
benefit of a policy which allows the
dumping of hazardous chemicals, as
the administration proposed last
week. Moreover, what's the sense,
they ask, of an energy source that
lacks a universally-approved method

of disposing its by-products or safely
mothballing the worn-out physical
plants that produce it?
Ronald Reagan may be expecting
too much. How can this generation's
rear guard devote itself to teaching,
to research, to helping others — and
refrain from more lucrative lines of
work — when its loan indebtedness is
expected to increase some 67 per
cent under new student aid
guidelines? (It doesn't help matters
when top White House aides, who
make upwards of $62,000 a year, say
the low salaries of government ser
vice will shortly force them to return
to the private sector.)
"A reordering of priorities is cer
tainly needed, but how can we be ex
pected to do it in the face of all these
contradictions?" Riccardi asked.
"Our faith in the future is getting
caught in the crossfire of what's sup
posed to be a battle for national re
newal."
Such heady comments could, of
course, represent little more than the
plaintive cries of a privileged young
er set. Admittedly, the sight of pro
testing private-college students begs,
our skepticism.
From their perspective, however,
college students are struggling to
find a place in these changing times.
They're neither typically liberal nor
typically conservative, but simply
confused by mixed signals from the
current leadership.
Remarkably, the government's
lack of foresight in student aid cut
backs may spur many collegians to
campaign against illogic in other pol
icies. Many in the bipartisan con
gressional group that met with stu
dent protesters in February en
couraged grassroots-style lobbying
and letter-writing. Whether the con
gressmen's audience will forge a
broader consensus is impossible to
predict.
But their inclination to view educa
tional aid cutbacks in the broader
context of administration policies
makes them less self-centered than
presumed. Sometimes it takes a shot
in the arm to feel the pain of others.
