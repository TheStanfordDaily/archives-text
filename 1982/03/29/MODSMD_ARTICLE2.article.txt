# Weinberger: strength will deter USSR
## 
### Bill Ainsworth 
Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger told a campus audience here
March 7, that the Reagan adminis
tration's massive arms buildup is a
necessary step to deter Soviet ag
gression.
. "None of us knows how much time
we may have," he said during his
speech to the highly responsive Dead
Week audience. "We barely had
time in World War 11. What we're
trying to do is regain the strength to
deter a war."
This statement drew some ap
plause, some hissing and some raised
arms sporting blue arm bands, which
some persons at the speech used to
signify their opposition to Wein
berger's policies.
An overflow crowd of nearly 600
packed Kresge for the speech, while
approximately 300 other students
watched and listened in two separate
rooms in the law school and about
200 people protested outside the
auditorium.
After the talk Weinberger received
an unexpected standing ovation
from the apparently hostile crowd.
At various times during the talk it be
came difficult to hear Weinberger
above the noise being made by pro
testers stationed outside the building
who beat on the glass windows and
chanted slogans such as "No Cap, no
war, U.S. out of El Salvador."
Various members of the audience
displayed signs criticizing Wein
berger and the administration's poli
cies and several people came with
white painted on their faces, symbol

izing opposition to Weinberger's
policies.
Weinberger, who appeared un
daunted by the protesters, denied
that the huge budget increases in mil
itary spending took money away
from social programs, adding that the
"best social welfare preserves the
peace of the people."
According to Weinberger,
throughout the past 21 years the So
viet Union has steadily increased its
"enormous military strength" while
the U.S. has not adequately main
tained its military capabilities.
Following his speech, Weinberger
answered questions submitted in
writing by the audience and selected
by Robert Rosenzweig, vice presi
dent for public affairs. In response to
a question regarding the Reagan ad
ministration's policy in Central
America, Weinberger denied that
the administration was concerned
with the internal policies of govern
mentsthere. Instead it fears Soviet in
fluences in the area, according to
Weinberger.
"We believe there is a movement
(in El Salvador) that is not only sup
ported but supplied and reinforced
by the Soviet Union." he said. "We
believe that there is a Soviet attempt
to gain clients states (on the Ameri
can continent), which would make
defense of the United States infinite
ly more difficult," he added.
The question regarding Central
America received roaring applause
from the audience, although the an
swer drew a mixed response.
Weinberger's speech dealth with

the question of U.S. security rela
tionships with Northeast Asia. In it,
he emphasized the growing im
portance of Northeast Asia by citing
U.S. trade statistics which show that
the United States conducts one
fourth of all its trade with nations in
that area.
"Our administration policy is to
work closely with our allies to im
prove defense capabilities against
the threat posed by the Soviet
Union," he said.
In addition to maintaining a
greater naval and air force presence
in this region, Weinberger said the
Soviet Union was going to deploy the
backfire bomber as well as a new
bomber that has recently been iden
tified by U.S. intelligence forces.
Weinberger said the contrast be
tween the United States' return of
Okinawa to the Japanese and the So
viet Union's annexation of Japanese

islands taken during the war was sym
bolic of the differences between the
two superpowers.
Japan's decision to increase its real
defense budget by 71/2 percent was,
according to Weinberger, a "promis
ing development." However, he
added that "the burden of their de
fense still rests very largely with us."
The U.S. approachment with China
which began in the '70s, is, according
to Weinberger, the event that "most
profoundly affected the balance of
power in the world."
The Reagan administration, ac
cording to Weinberger, will continue
to develop its relations with China
while maintaining ties with Taiwan.
Earlier in the day, in a seminar in
cluding 20 students, Weinberger said
that the purpose of draft registration
was to deter a first strike against the
United States by the Soviet Union, al
though the Reagan administration
has no plans to reinstitute the draft
under normal circumstances.
"We do have to do something
more than we've been doing by quite
a bit if we want to deter a situation in
which the Soviets are almost in effect
invited to launch a first attack," he
said.
In addition to the speech and the
seminar, Weinberger met with facul
ty at the Hoover Institution and
spoke at the Faculty Club on the top
ic of technology transfer and national
security,,
Weinberger's visit on campus was
sponsored by the Northeast Asia Fo
rum and the Stanford Committee on
Political Education.

though the Reagan administration
has no plans to reinstitute the draft
under normal circumstances.
"We do have to do something
more than we've been doing by quite
a bit if we want to deter a situation in
which the Soviets are almost in effect
invited to launch a first attack," he
said.
In addition to the speech and the
seminar, Weinberger met with facul
ty at the Hoover Institution and
spoke at the Faculty Club on the top
ic of technology transfer and national
security,,
Weinberger's visit on campus was
sponsored by the Northeast Asia Fo

the Reagan Administration's arms build-up policies.

pounded on windows and chanted epithets to harass the chief
spokesman for the Reagan Administration's defense policies.


Caspar Weinberger
Secretary of Defense Caspar Wein
berger told a campus audience here
March 7, that the Reagan adminis
tration's massive arms buildup is a
necessary step to deter Soviet ag
gression.
. "None of us knows how much time
we may have," he said during his
speech to the highly responsive Dead
Week audience. "We barely had
time in World War 11. What we're
trying to do is regain the strength to
deter a war."
This statement drew some ap
plause, some hissing and some raised
arms sporting blue arm bands, which
some persons at the speech used to
signify their opposition to Wein
berger's policies.
An overflow crowd of nearly 600
packed Kresge for the speech, while
approximately 300 other students
watched and listened in two separate
rooms in the law school and about
200 people protested outside the
auditorium.
After the talk Weinberger received
an unexpected standing ovation
from the apparently hostile crowd.
At various times during the talk it be
came difficult to hear Weinberger
above the noise being made by pro
testers stationed outside the building
who beat on the glass windows and
chanted slogans such as "No Cap, no
war, U.S. out of El Salvador."
Various members of the audience
displayed signs criticizing Wein
berger and the administration's poli
cies and several people came with
white painted on their faces, symbol

izing opposition to Weinberger's
policies.
Weinberger, who appeared un
daunted by the protesters, denied
that the huge budget increases in mil
itary spending took money away
from social programs, adding that the
"best social welfare preserves the
peace of the people."
According to Weinberger,
throughout the past 21 years the So
viet Union has steadily increased its
"enormous military strength" while
the U.S. has not adequately main
tained its military capabilities.
Following his speech, Weinberger
answered questions submitted in
writing by the audience and selected
by Robert Rosenzweig, vice presi
dent for public affairs. In response to
a question regarding the Reagan ad
ministration's policy in Central
America, Weinberger denied that
the administration was concerned
with the internal policies of govern
mentsthere. Instead it fears Soviet in
fluences in the area, according to
Weinberger.
"We believe there is a movement
(in El Salvador) that is not only sup
ported but supplied and reinforced
by the Soviet Union." he said. "We
believe that there is a Soviet attempt
to gain clients states (on the Ameri
can continent), which would make
defense of the United States infinite
ly more difficult," he added.
The question regarding Central
America received roaring applause
from the audience, although the an
swer drew a mixed response.
Weinberger's speech dealth with

the question of U.S. security rela
tionships with Northeast Asia. In it,
he emphasized the growing im
portance of Northeast Asia by citing
U.S. trade statistics which show that
the United States conducts one
fourth of all its trade with nations in
that area.
"Our administration policy is to
work closely with our allies to im
prove defense capabilities against
the threat posed by the Soviet
Union," he said.
In addition to maintaining a
greater naval and air force presence
in this region, Weinberger said the
Soviet Union was going to deploy the
backfire bomber as well as a new
bomber that has recently been iden
tified by U.S. intelligence forces.
Weinberger said the contrast be
tween the United States' return of
Okinawa to the Japanese and the So
viet Union's annexation of Japanese

islands taken during the war was sym
bolic of the differences between the
two superpowers.
Japan's decision to increase its real
defense budget by 71/2 percent was,
according to Weinberger, a "promis
ing development." However, he
added that "the burden of their de
fense still rests very largely with us."
The U.S. approachment with China
which began in the '70s, is, according
to Weinberger, the event that "most
profoundly affected the balance of
power in the world."
The Reagan administration, ac
cording to Weinberger, will continue
to develop its relations with China
while maintaining ties with Taiwan.
Earlier in the day, in a seminar in
cluding 20 students, Weinberger said
that the purpose of draft registration
was to deter a first strike against the
United States by the Soviet Union, al
though the Reagan administration
has no plans to reinstitute the draft
under normal circumstances.
"We do have to do something
more than we've been doing by quite
