## Card nine falls in Riverside 
### Adam Berns 
Stanford's No. 2 ranked baseball team entered the UC-
Riverside baseball tournament as the early favorite. The
Cardinal entered the tournament with a 26-3-1 record and
had just previously taken two of three games from UCLA.
Unfortunately. Stanford's bats failed to come alive as the
Cardinal won only three games while losing four.
"I was disappointed we didn't win more games," Stanford
coach Mark Marquess said about the tournament. "We
pitched well, but we didn't hit at all in the last four games."
The tournament started on March 22 and the finals were
played last Saturday night.
Stanford won its first three games, but then dropped its
next four. Until Saturday, Stanford still had a chance to
make the finals.
The Cardinal entered competition on Saturday with a
3-2-1 record. Stanford tied Tulane earlier in the week and
replayed the game early Saturday morning and lost 5-4.
Later in the day, the Cardinal lost another close game, this
time to Oral Roberts, by a score of 3-2. Oral Roberts went on
to advance to the finals of the tournament.

On Friday, the Cardinal lost to Brigham Young University
4-2. Stanford catcher Bob Hausladen hit a two-run double
in the fifth inning to give the Cardinal a 2-0 lead. However
BYU scored four runs late in the game, including two un
earned runs in the sixth inning, for the victory.
Although the results of the tournament were disappoint
ing for Marquess, none of the losses were conference
games. He also had a chance to use several pitchers who had
not seen much action this year, including sophomores
Doug Gwaltney and John Radtke, and freshman David
Harris. All three pitchers picked up victories at the tour
nament.
Marquess was also impressed by Brian Mignano's
pitching on Saturday even though he lost.
Another bright spot in the tournament was the play of
utility infielder Vince Sakowski who played for the injured
Steve Buechelle at second base. He played well defensively
throughout the tournament. Junior centerfielder Darryl
Stephens was also hurt during the tournament.
The Stanford baseball team still has an impressive 29-7-1
record. Its next game will be an important league series at
Arizona State April 2-4.
