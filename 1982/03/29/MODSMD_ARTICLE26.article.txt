## 
### Sid Spaeth 
The Stanford men's tennis
earn will take on a new look
Wednesday as they enter the
pring season and leave a disa
lointing Winter trek behind
hem.
Coach Dick Gould said he
vill reveal an altered line-up
Wednesday against San Jose (1
j.m. at Varsity Courts) to try
and get some magic into his
line-up.
"All four of our losses have
been by 5-4 scores," Gould
said, "and in three of those we
were a match point or two

away from winning. We're ac
tually only a couple of points
away from being undefeated.
We're close to being a good
team, but we haven't proved it
yet."
The Cardinal dropped a pair
of matches to Arizona State
and Arizona last weekend.
Friday, Arizona State
clinched a 5-3 win by winning
two doubles matches early
before the third was aban
doned because of darkness
tied at one set each and, Satur
day, Arizona controlled the
doubles for a 5-4 win.

The Arizona State match was
delayed until 4:30 p.m. be
cause of rain in Tempe and the
teams fought to a 3-3 draw after
the singles.
Scott Davis, John Corse and
Mark Mckeen led the Cardinal
through the singlesby picking
up wins.
"Mark McKeen played well
and so did Davis," Gould said,
"and I have been pleased with
John Corse all year. Saturday's
loss was his first of the year and
it was really a hard fought
match."
Arizona State controlled the
doubles to clinch the win.
Gary Donnelly and Todd
Nelson beat Davis and Jeff
Arons 6-3,6-2 and Dewey Grat
ton and Jim Settles eased by
Paul Robinson and Jeremy
Semple 6-0,7-5. Scott Bond
urant and Corse split sets with
Alex Levy and Brian Sullivan,
but darkness forced the
Cardinal to pack up and go
home with a 5-3 loss.
"We were just plain out
played and outcoached,"
Gould said.
Gould was much happier
with play Saturday, but the
Cardinal again dropped a 5-4
heartbreaker.
"We played a tough match
against Arizona on a neutral
court in L.A. earlier this year
and beat them 5-4," Gould ex
plained. "I thought we played
more competitively Saturday
even though we lost."
Davis and McKeen again
picked up singles wins against
Arizona and Jeff Arons han
dled Bill Moss, who had missed
the teams's previous meeting,
7-6,6-4.
Stanford again lost the match
in the doubles. Davis and
Arons beat Moss and Paul
Chamberlin in the No. 1 match,
but Arizona came back to take
the other two and the match.
Stanford hosts San- Jose
Wednesday and California Fri
day in what Dick Gould de
scribed as "pivotal matches.
"I feel this team will bounce
back and have a great April. We
have no choice, but to look at
April as a new season."
