Stanford fell from the first round of the
NCAA women's basketball playoffs March 14
in far-away Maryland to wrap up a highly suc
cesful season.
The tournament featuring the top 32 teams
in the nation, pitted the Cardinal against a
Maryland Terrapin team playing in their
home State. The Terrapins crushed Stanford
82-48.
Stanford completed a brilliant season, nev
ertheless. The Cardinal compiled a 19-7 over
all record and a 9-3 mark in the Northern Cali
fornia Conference.
All-Conference selections Meg Metzger
and Louise Smith le*d the team in scoring, but
the Card remained team-oriented.

Senior starters Debi Gore, Anne Miller and
Smith will be missed next year, but coach
Dotty McCrea looks forward to a good re
cruiting season after landing a berth in the
NCAA's.
Maples Pavillion was the site of the
Western Regionals March 19 and 21. Mary
land defeated Drake 89-78 to win the re
gional.
Maryland reached the final with a 80-68 win
over Missouri. The Terps led by only two at
the half, but applied a full-court press with six
minutes remaining to pull away from the
Tigers.
In the other game, Lori Bauman scored 26
points as Drake upset Long Beach 91-78.
