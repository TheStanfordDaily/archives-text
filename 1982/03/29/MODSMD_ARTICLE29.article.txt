# Tar Heels shoot for first No. 1

### Associated Press 
New Orleans — John
Thompson calls Monday's
NCAA title game between his
Georgetown Hoyas and North
Carolina's Tar Heels a "no
lose" situation. For him, may
be. But certainly not for Dean
Smith, his close friend and oc
cassional coaching rival.
For Thompson, a win would
mean, of course, everything.
And while a loss would bring
him disappointment, it also
would mean that a wrong had
been made right — that Smith,
once and for always, could put
to rest his image as the coach
who won them all but the big
one. Thompson, after swallow

himself to share Smith's joy.
"There can be no loser (to
night)," said Thompson on the
eve of his first NCAA cham
pionship game. "We both will
feel bad, but there's feeling
bad and there's feeling bad."
Smith knows full well the en
tire range of bad feeling on
such occasions. He is the reign

hastaken North Carolina tothe
Final Four. Three times the Tar
Heels lost in the semifinal
round; three times they lost in
the final. Only two coaches
have been to the national tour
nament more often, but no
one approaches his record for
Final Four futility.
Another loss wouldn't break
his will, probably just his heart.
There is at least a small irony
contained somewhere herein
that Thompson, certainly
Smith's closest friend in the
business, stands between him
and the end of those painful
questions.
"It won't affect our friend
ship," Smith said. "We might
even sit down and talk about it
some day."
North Carolina, ranked first
when the season began, is fa
vored to end the season as No.
1. The Tar Heels' starting five is
probably the in the col
