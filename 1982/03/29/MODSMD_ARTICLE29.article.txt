# Tar Heels shoot for first No. 1
## 
### Associated Press 
New Orleans — John
Thompson calls Monday's
NCAA title game between his
Georgetown Hoyas and North
Carolina's Tar Heels a "no
lose" situation. For him, may
be. But certainly not for Dean
Smith, his close friend and oc
cassional coaching rival.
For Thompson, a win would
mean, of course, everything.
And while a loss would bring
him disappointment, it also
would mean that a wrong had
been made right — that Smith,
once and for always, could put
to rest his image as the coach
who won them all but the big
one. Thompson, after swallow
ing hard, might even find it in
himself to share Smith's joy.
"There can be no loser (to
night)," said Thompson on the
eve of his first NCAA cham
pionship game. "We both will
feel bad, but there's feeling
bad and there's feeling bad."
Smith knows full well the en
tire range of bad feeling on
such occasions. He is the reign
ing expert. Six times before he
hastaken North Carolina tothe
Final Four. Three times the Tar
Heels lost in the semifinal
round; three times they lost in
the final. Only two coaches
have been to the national tour
nament more often, but no
one approaches his record for
Final Four futility.
Another loss wouldn't break
his will, probably just his heart.
There is at least a small irony
contained somewhere herein
that Thompson, certainly
Smith's closest friend in the
business, stands between him
and the end of those painful
questions.
"It won't affect our friend
ship," Smith said. "We might
even sit down and talk about it
some day."
North Carolina, ranked first
when the season began, is fa
vored to end the season as No.
1. The Tar Heels' starting five is
probably the in the col
lege game. Some would say the
same of their coach. Thomp
son, for one, would say that,
and does.
It's a curious relationship
they have struck. They are so
close that Smith won't sched
ule Georgetown in the regular
season for fear of putting a
strain on that friendship. This is
no coach-to-coach, let's-talk-
X's-and-O's affair. The two
men have forged a bond that
extends well beyond basket
ball. It is something special,
which makes tonight's game
perhaps even more special to
them than it already would be.
Smith isThompson's mentor.
He helped him get the
Georgetown coaching job.

When Smith coached the U.S.
Olympic team in 1976, he
chose Thompson to be his as
sistant. When the phone rings
at the Thompson house at 1
a.m., it means that Dean Smith
is on the line. Smith had
Thompson sit in on the Tar
Heels' pregame meal before
their 1977 NCAA title game.
When Thompson sends his son
to a basketball camp, it's Dean
Smith's camp he chooses.
"I hate to be praising Dean
so much," said Thompson,
who freely admits that he has
borrowed much of his
coaching philosophy from
Smith. "You know, I want to
beat that man."
Of course, Smith will not

alone beat Thompson, nor
Thompson Smith.
The two coaches bring suffi
cient talent to fill even the Su
perdome. North Carolina
(31-2) has All-Americans in
James Worthy and Sam Perkins.
Georgetown (30-6) counters
with Eric (Sleepy) Floyd and Pat
Ewing. Both teams play ex
cellent, if different brands, of
defense. Both can score.
Georgetown is deeper, Caroli
na more experienced.
And for those who give
Smith the coaching edge,
Smith offers this:
"It's not Thompson against
Smith. If it were, he'd take me
inside and kill me."
The story is told that during

the Montreal Olympics, they
played a little one-on-one.
And Thompson, the former
Boston Celtic who has about a
foot and a dozen years on
Smith, took him inside and,
sure enough, killed him, 6-0.
But Smith has the better of
the coaching rivalry, all one
game of it. That came last sea
son at the Great Alaska
Shootout when, before some
500 spectators, North Carolina
won, 83-71.
Thompson wouldn't mind
playing North Carolina in the
regular season. He believes
that having a friend for a rival is
"true sport." As Thompson ex
plains it, "You can coach in a
competitive vein and not get

into a hate thing. There are
some folks who I've lost games
to and it bothers me for a
month. And there are some
that it bothers me for two
days."
As much as Thompson cares
for Smith, this game might take
a little longer to get over.
There are no secrets be
tween the men; they know ev
ery move the other might
make. Georgetown tries to
take the game away from the
other team with a pressure de
fense and an aggressive 1-3-1
zone. Ewing, the imposing 7-0
freshman who can dominate
the lane, is the key to the zone.
But North Carolina plays well
against a zone. It has good pe

rimeter shooters in Michael
Jordan and Jimmy Black and
imposing inside performers in
Perkins and Worthy. Concen
trate on them and Matt Doher
ty seems to find the seams.
There is no lack of weapons
available to Smith, except for
an unusually short bench.
The Tar Heels play a com
bination of defenses, but most
ly man-to-man. Perkins and
Worthy will share the assign
ment on Ewing, as they did dur
ing the season on Virginia's 7-4
Kalph Sampson. Eloyd is
Georgetown's chief offensive
weapon and he will draw Car
olina's best defender in Black.
Eric Smith can score, but
neither Mike Hancock nor

Fred Brown is a particular
threat. For Georgetown to win,
it probably must get very big
games from Ewing and Floyd,
neither of whom scored much
in the semifinal win over Louis
ville.
The team that gets ahead late
in the game will hold the ball.
So don't expect a lot of scoring.
Smith has never had a team
in this position as such a clear
cut favorite. Last year, when
Carolina lost to Indiana in the
final, the game was rated even.
But Indiana's defense took the
Tar Fieels out of their game.
They might have had a slight
edge over Marquette in '77,
but Phil Ford had a hyper
extended elbow.
