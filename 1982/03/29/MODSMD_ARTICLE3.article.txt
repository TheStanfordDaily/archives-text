# Conference urges research policies

Pajaro Dunes, CA — As the line be
tween academic and industrial re
search becomes hazier, the need to
pursue a policy which will preserve
the "independence and integrity of
the university and its faculty" grows
more urgent, the presidents of five
leading research universities and
their counterparts in industry con
cluded Saturday after a three day,
"closed" conference here.
Among the means proposed in a
prepared statement to achieve the
end of "independence and integri
ty" were: publishing the relevant
provisions of university research con
tracts; creating a faculty committee
to review research contracts; allow
ing universities to negotiate ex
clusive licenses to develop univer
sity-generated technology as long as
this continues for only the time nec
essary to encourage the desired de
velopment; and finally, establishing
safeguards against university invest
ments which might damage the aca
demic atmosphere of the university.
While scholars from all over the
country participated in the meeting,
the conferees did not adopt any of
these provisions as "national re
search policy," according to Stanford
President Donald Kennedy. Con
ference participants included uni
versity presidents Derek Bok of
Harvard, Marvin Goldberger of the
California Institute of Technology,
Paul Gray of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, David Saxon of
the University of California system

and Kennedy, as well corporate ex
ecutives from firms such as Beckman
Instruments Inc., Eli Lilly and Co., and
Genetech.
Kennedy said that the proposals
outlined in the group's prepared
statement should be adopted or re
jected on their own merits by indi
vidual institutions. "What we hope is
that we've started a discussion and
constructed a useful framework for
the development of policy ... as to
teeth, we do not have any," Kennedy
said at a press briefing following the
conference.
Kennedy first suggested conven
ing a high-level meeting a year ago in
a speech at the University of Pennsyl
vania in which he voiced his concern
about the possible subversion of aca
demic projects due to the increasing
rapprochement between academic
scientists and industry, especially in
the field of gene-splicing. While at
one time, faculty inventors such as
Hewlett-Packard would move off
campus and start corporations, the
difference between basic and ap
plied research has tightened, Ken
nedy said.
Dr. Charles Vanofsky, a professor
of biology at Stanford and a consul
tant in industry, also took part in the
conference and said he viewed the
problem as temporary, at least in his
field. "I think we're in a period where
biotechnology can be applied and
the know-how is mostly in the uni
versities . . . rather quickly, there will
be technology in industry and there
will no longer be that (conflict)."
