### Mark Zeigler 
Both men's and women's
swim teams fell short against
NCAA foes in their respective
championships during the past
week.
The women's squad lived up
to its No. 2 ranking, falling to
No. 1 Florida at the Gators'
home pool in Gainsville, Flori
da.The men's team placed
third behind Texas and UCLA
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin this
past weekend.
Led by Olympians Tracy
Caul kins, kathy Trieble, anddi
ver Megan Neyer, Florida cap
tured 13 firsts to Stanford's six.
The Gators consequently out
scored the Cardinal 505 to 383,
in the first ever NCAA women's
championships.
Asked if swimming in the
Gators' pool had a bearing in

the final outcome, coach
George Haines replied, "That
had to he a small factor, but un
der the circumstances we did
about as well as we we could
have."
Marybeth Linzmeier certain
ly wasn't phased by any kind of
"home pool" advantage. In
fact, the freshman had a hand
in five of the Cardinal's six first
place efforts, winning the 200,
500, and 1650 yard freestyle
events and swimming on two
of Stanford's three victorious
relay teams. She set two varsity
records.
The Cardinal won all three
freestyle relays, setting a varsity
mark in the 800 yard event
(7:16.10). Stanford also broke
school records in the 200
(1:42.90) and 400 (3:45.51)
medley relays, placing third

and second, respetively.
After the first day of com
petition, Florida held a 170 to
111 advantage over the Card, a
lead it never relinquished. Al
though Stanford pulled to
within 32 points heading into
the final day, the Gators
coasted to a 122 point victory.
Coach Skip Kenney and his
men's team suffered a defeat
much harder to swallow.
Behind Texas, UCLA, and
California after the second of
three days of competition, the
Cardinal came up with too lit
tle, too late. UCLA edged Texas
in the final event to record a
219-210 victory over the fa
vored Longhorns. Stanford fin
ished with 191 points, a mere 28
shy of the Bruins.
Freshman Dave Bottom
paced the Cardinal attack, plac

ing third in thelOOyard butterf
ly and fourth in both the 100
and 200 backstrokes. His effort
in the 100 fly (48.08) set a varsity
record. Shattering his own
school mark in the 200 IM was
John Simons, who also placed
seventh in the 400 IM behind
teammate Todd Lincoln in
fifth.
John Engs took third in the
200 back and eighth in the 100
yard race with Wade Flemons
finishing seventh. Bari Weick
captured fourth place in the
1650 and seventh in the 500
free. The 200 breast saw Joe
Jiminez place sixth, clocking a
55.56, just .05 seconds off his
varsity record.
The Cardinal's 800 freestyle
relay team broke the school
record by more than three sec
onds.
