Staffers: Back to work
You had your fun. A week with no
problem sets to struggle with, no pa
pers to write and no reading assign
ments to mull over. No pressure.
But everything returns as the new
quarter begins. Registration. Books.
Deadlines. And story assignments.
We've got a lot of them.
So help us out. Help yourself to a
news or feature story. We've got

plenty of them waiting, just itching to
be covered. The editors are here
from 2:00 p.m. on.
Edit board meeting
Edit board members meet at 1:00
p.m. today in the Daily offices. This is
an important meeting to plan in
terviews for election endorsements
and to discuss edits for the week.
Don't miss it.
