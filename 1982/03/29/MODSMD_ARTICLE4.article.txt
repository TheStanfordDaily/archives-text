Duarte's party leads in El Salvador election
San Salvador, El Salvador — Salvadorans turned out in unexpected
numbers yesterday to vote for a constituent assembly, despite leftist
guerrilla attacks in the streets of the capital and elsewhere in the coun
try. Unofficial returns gave junta President Jose Napoleon Duarte's par
ty an early lead.
With 14 of the approximately 4500 voting stations reporting from six
of the 14 provinces, unofficial returns from the Central Elections Com
mission gave Duarte's Christian Democrats 1835 votes, or 39.6 percent,
and 1331, or 28.7 percent, for former Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson's ultra
right Republican National Alliance, the other major contender.
If the trend holds, the Christian Democrats would be short of the
absolute majority needed for outright control of the 60-rnember consti
tuent assembly, but a good position to form a ruling coalition with one
of four minor parties.
Attacks by guerrillas — including rooftop snipers made voting im
possible in Usulutan, El Salvador's fourth-largest city. But people
flocked to the voting stations elsewhere, sometimes casting ballots
within blocks of street gunbattles. At least 24 guerrillas were reported
killed in the capital.
The constituent assembly will be empowered to rewrite the constitu
tion and name a provisional administration as a prelude to represent
ative government. Leftists boycotted the vote, calling it a farce.
The unofficial returns heavily favored the
Christian Democrats in San Salvador, the largest
electoral district with 13 seats. Duarte's party
appeared to be doing poorly in sparsely popu
lated northern Morazan province, a guerrilla
stronghold where many voters could not get to
the polls because of violence.
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican
leading an eight-member U.S. observer team,
called the election "exceptionally fair."
The count at the first polling station to report
— in San Miguel, 67 miles east of here — gave
the Christian Democrats 204 votes, or 43.8 per
cent. Officials at the station said 466 ballots were
cast, and D'Aubuisson's party, known as Arena,
got 123, or 26.4 percent.
Fighting between leftist guerrillas and army
troops was heard in and around San Miguel be
tween 6 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. EST, but thousands of
people walked and rode in from rural villages as
far as 23 miles away to vote.
The voting station, in a school, was given
20,000 ballots, which ran out at mid-afternoon.
More were flown in from San Salvador — guer
rillas control the roads in the area — but by the
time they arrived, officials said, about 1500
potential voters had left.
Haig ties U.S aid to
El Salvador reforms
Washington — Secretary of State Alexander
Haig said yesterday the Salvadoran national
elections "deserve our support," but reaf
firmed that future American financial backing
will depend on a continuation of the existing
government's reform movement.
Haig, appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press,"
said, "The very fact of a free election... is a step
toward democratization."
But, he said, if Salvadoran voters elect a con
stituent assembly dominated by rightist political
forces, "that's their business.
"We have supported the current regime
based on the reforms they have instituted," he
said, "and it will be adherence to those prin
ciples that will determine the level of American
support."
The Reagan administration was presumed to
be supporting the Christian Democratic party
of President Jose Napoleon Duarte in yester
day's election.
Duarte appeared to be facing his biggest
challenge from the National Republican Al
liance, headed by Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson.
D'Aubuisson, descibed by former U.S. am
bassador to El Salvador Robert White as a
"pathological killer," has said he may try Duarte
on charges of treason if his party wins.
Haig, alluding to critics of administration pol
icy toward Central America, said Americans
should be "more clear-eyed and clear-headed"
about the alternatives to existing anti-com
munist regimes in the region.
He said the central problem is that "Marxism-
Leninism espouses revolution under the guise
of social justice" but its real objective is the "im
position of the kind of totalitarianism we are
seeing emerge in Nicaragua and the tragedy we
are seeing in Poland today."
Again addressing his critics, Haig said the
American people have "neither the luxury nor
the ability to recreate our own image" in coun
tries facing social and political upheaval.
Haig contrasted El Salvador's attempt to hold
national elections with the Sandinista regime in
Nicaragua which, he said, has yet to fix a date for
holding elections even though it took power
before the civilian-military junta in El Salvador.
Shuttle prepared for landing
Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Columbia's
astronauts gave their space shuttle an encourag
ing once-over yesterday and prepared for a
.midday landing today at a makeshift spaceport

on the white sands of New Mexico. But touch
down could come early — or even a day late —
to dodge the desert winds.
"We look forward to coming back," com
mander jack Lousma radioed before he and pi
lot Gordon Fullerton retired for the night.
A NASA forecast early yesterday evening
called for decent weather conditions in the
morning, but becoming windier and dustier af
ter noon, mountain time. Landing is scheduled
for 12:27 p.m. MST — 11 '.27 a.m. PST.
Flight director Neil Hutchinson said later in
Houston that he expected the landing to be on
time. He said any change would have to be de
cided within an hour of the astronaut's awak
ening at 5 a.m. EST, after NASA checked the
latest word on winds and clouds from New
Mexico.
Another flight director, Harold Draughon,
who is in charge of Columbia's descent, had
said earlier, "We maintain an option to come
home early." A decision to land one orbit early
would cut 90 minutes from the flight.
But Hutchinson said, "We have no plans right
now to come in one rev (orbit) early or two revs
early.
"We do have the option if we don't like it (the
weather) tomorrow to wait another day,"he
said. But "the prognostication for Tuesday is
about the same as tomorrow, so I think we're
going to work real hard to come in tomorrow."
A NASA news release, issued at White Sands,
said "the weather for Monday looks good for
landing" and predicted visibility of 10 to 40
miles. But the release added: "By noon blowing
dust may reduce visibility to less than seven
miles in some areas. Mission rules require a 7-
mile visibility minimum for Columbia's land
ing."
NASA officials have said Columbia has
enough fuel, power and food to extend its mis
sion for three days if necessary.
Lousma and Fullerton will guide Columbia
onto the White Sands Missile Range's Northrup
Strip, a barren backup site hurriedly equipped
to receive the billion-dollar space plane.
UAW nears pact with AMC
Southfieid, Mich. — The United Auto Work
ers and American Motors Corp. moved nearer
to an agreement on an employee investment
plan proposed by the company, the union's
chief negotiator with AMC said yesterday.
"We settled some items," Raymond Majerus,
UAW secretary-treasurer and head of the
union's AMC department.
Meanwhile, a small UAW local in Detroit ov
erwhelmingly ratified the union's tentative
concessions contract with General Motors
Corp.
Majerus said AMC's proposed investment
plan asking workers to give up part of their
wage increases, paid time off and cost-of-living
raises over 22 months "has been accepted by us
and is not a hang-up."
He said, "It's how we get there that we're
dealing with now."
The talks began in Milwaukee on March 8.
Among the main stumbling blocks was the
sharing of sacrifices by blue- and white-collar
employees, Majerus said.
Majerus acknowledged late Saturday that
bargainers were discussing whether AMC
should be asked to agree to a specified ratio for
the number of supervisors to blue-collar work
ers.
Autoworkers at AMC as well as Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp. have com
plained that during the recent sales slump,
when thousands of auto workers have been laid
off, managerial personnel have kept their jobs.
Majerus would not specify what other issues
were troublesome.
Meanwhile, workers at a Detroit GM plant
voted 129-9 yesterday to ratify the UAW's new
tentative agreement with the No. 1 U.S. auto
maker. The ratification vote was the first on the

GM tentative agreement.
Arabs killed in W. Bank clash
Jerusalem — The Israeli military command
said three Arab demonstrators were shot in the
occupied West Bank yesterday in the 10th
straight day of anti-Israeli violence.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's Cabinet,
meeting yesterday, endorsed the tough re
sponse the government is taking to the demon
strations. Israeli officials also said they have
proof the Palestine Liberation Organization was
plotting a major uprising for May.
PLO leader Yasser Arafat was quoted yester
day in the leftist Lebanese newspaper As Safir as
saying that his guerrillas would not remain inac
tive much longer in the face of continued West
Bank disturbances, which he said have brought
the Middle East to the verge of an "explosion."
"The Palestinian revolution . . . will not stand
by with its hands tied in the face of this criminal,
imperialist-Zionist conspiracy against our peo
ple in the occupied land," Arafat was quoted as
saying. He did not say what action the PLO
might take.
Meanwhile, eight West Bank mayors signed a
declaration saying they would refuse to meet
with Israel's civil administration for the oc
cupied territory.
The mayors of Hebron, Bethlehem, Gaza,
Tulkarim, Dura, Beit Sahour, Qalqilya and
Anabta signed the declaration. It said they
viewed the civil administration as a step toward
limited autonomy, Palestinian sources said.
Many Palestinians view autonomy as an unac
ceptable substitute for full independence. The
West Bank demonstrations were sparked by Is
rael's removal of three Arab mayors it said were
not cooperating with the civil administration.
Weinberger visits S. Korea
Seoul, South Korea — Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger flew here yesterday to un
derscore the Reagan administration's commit
ment to South Korea's defense.
Aides said Weinberger would listen sympa
thetically to South Korea's proposals that the
United States help ease the burden of main
taining and modernizing some 600,000 troops,
which consumes about one-third of South Ko
rea's budget.
The official purpose of Weinberger's visit, his
first to Korea, is to attend a two-day meeting of a
high-level group that annually assesses the mili
tary threat from Communist-ruled North Korea
and how best to deter it.
"The most important reason the secretary has
come to Seoul is to demonstrate graphically
that we are firmly behind South Korea," said an
aide, who stressed the Reagan administration's
approval of the regime headed by President
Chun Doo-hwan.
The South Koreans are looking for some eco
nomic support for their military. Sources in the
South Korean government indicated they
would likethe United States to agree to buy mil
itary hardware from Korean plants, which are
operating at only about 40 percent of capacity.
A paper prepared by Weinberger's staff made
no mention of buying artillery, ammunition or
other South Korean gear for the U.S. forces. It
did speak of using South Korean defense in
dustries "to increase contract maintenance of
U.S. equipment."
"We'd like to help them, but we must be
careful not to do anything that would cost
American jobs," an official in Weinberger's par
ty said.
Today's Weather
Showers are likely through tomorrow, with a
chance of thundershowers and small hail. High
temperatures will be in the 50s, and lows will be
in the upper 30s to mid 40s.
