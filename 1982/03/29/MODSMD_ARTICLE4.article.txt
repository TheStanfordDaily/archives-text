Duarte's party leads in El Salvador election
San Salvador, El Salvador — Salvadorans turned out in unexpected
numbers yesterday to vote for a constituent assembly, despite leftist
guerrilla attacks in the streets of the capital and elsewhere in the coun
try. Unofficial returns gave junta President Jose Napoleon Duarte's par
ty an early lead.
With 14 of the approximately 4500 voting stations reporting from six
of the 14 provinces, unofficial returns from the Central Elections Com
mission gave Duarte's Christian Democrats 1835 votes, or 39.6 percent,
and 1331, or 28.7 percent, for former Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson's ultra
right Republican National Alliance, the other major contender.
If the trend holds, the Christian Democrats would be short of the
absolute majority needed for outright control of the 60-rnember consti
tuent assembly, but a good position to form a ruling coalition with one
of four minor parties.
Attacks by guerrillas — including rooftop snipers made voting im
possible in Usulutan, El Salvador's fourth-largest city. But people
flocked to the voting stations elsewhere, sometimes casting ballots
within blocks of street gunbattles. At least 24 guerrillas were reported
killed in the capital.
The constituent assembly will be empowered to rewrite the constitu
tion and name a provisional administration as a prelude to represent
ative government. Leftists boycotted the vote, calling it a farce.
