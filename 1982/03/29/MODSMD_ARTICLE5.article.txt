# Coalition protests Secretary's views

### Heather Millar Senior staff writer 
The cries of 800 protesters chanting
"No more Reagan, no more war, U.S.
out of El Salvador," and "bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit," punctuated Secre
tary of Defense Caspar Weinberger's
speech delivered in Kresge
Auditorium March 12.
The protesters' chant filtering in
from outside, the flicker of the sever
al hundred eddies the demonstrat
ors held and the drumming of fists on
the windows lining Kresge's north
side besieged Weinberger and his
audience. Inside the auditorium, ob
jectors with their faces painted an
eerie white silently held protest ban
ners and raised blue arm bands every
time they disagreed with one of the
Secretary's statements.
Weinberger seemed to take the
protests in stride, halting his speech
when the window-pounding grew
deafening or the audience began to
boo his comments. When asked why
he subjected himself to speaking un

der such trying conditions, the Secre
tary replied, "I have an obligation to
explain the (Administration's de
fense) policies and the reasons for
those policies."
"The Weinberger Conversion
Project," an ad-hoc coalition of Stan
ford and community groups or
ganized the battery of protests
against the Administration's defense
policy. According to one of the Con
version Project's organizers, "We
tried to make a statement Wein
berger would hear, one he would lis
ten to."
Demonstrations that day — Friday
of Dead Week — started at noon with
a street theatre protest in White
Plaza, continued in the late after
noon with an "Ecumencial Service
... for World Peace," and cul
minated as a series of candlelight
marches converging on Kresge for a
rally just before "Secretary of Of
fense" Weinberger's speech.
"It felt very focused," said Karl
Snyder, a Menlo Park resident who
helped organize the substantial
group of protesters not affiliated with
the University. "People weren't out
of control yet people got across a
firm, determined message."
Speakers at the rally echoed the
claims in a flyer distributed by the
Conversion Project: The adminis
tration's budget cuts are merely "re
allocations" taking money from so
cial programs and funneling it into
defense programs. United States de
fense policy aggravates the already
unstable situation in Central Ameri
ca. Weinberger supports a danger
ous, and unnecessary, nuclear arms

build-up.
Preacher Robert McAfee Brown, a
former Stanford professor, warned
the gathering of about 200 at the ecu
menical service to "beware of
smooth words." He said the most
frightening difference between the
Vietnamese and the El Salvadoran
scenarios is that "back then (during
the Vietnam War) it was pretty easy to
spot the villains," but today this is no
longer so. The preacher reiterated
Chronicle columnist Art Hoppe's de
scription of the Secretary of Defense:
"Cap Weinberger is ... a charming,
gracious, eminently decent individ
ual and I think he (Weinberger) is
trying to kill me."
"There are better things to spend
our money on than building weap
ons and killing people," senior Kathy
Treimann said.
