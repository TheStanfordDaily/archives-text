# Researchers fear classification moves
## Stanford VP testifies today 
### Jonathan Greene 
"A bruising confrontation be
tween the government and univer
sities" could be in store if federal of
ficials blame leakage of academic re
search results abroad for the narrow
ing of America's technological edge,
Robert Rosenzweig, Stanford's vice
president for public affairs, will testi
fy in Congressional hearings today.
Calling an open society "our real
advantage" in the technology race,
Rosenzweig will warn that new re
strictions on academic research and
exchanges may "have effects exactly
opposite those that are intended,"
according to a copy of his statements.
Rosenzweig specifically addresses
the recent controversy involving the
proposed visit of Soviet robotics ex

pert Nikolai Umnov here.
"There is no denying the system
atic way in which the Russians plan
for and profit from the opportunities
afforded their people in this coun
try," Rosenzweig has written.
"(But) if work going on at Stanford
was judged to be too sensitive to be
exposed to a Russian visitor, then the
solution is to keep him away from the
University, not to ask the University
to play policeman."
The hearings before the House
Committee on Science and Technol
ogy will also consider a proposed
"Executive Order on Security Classi
fication," which was released by the
Reagan administration in February.
The order would weaken current lim
itations on what kinds of informa

tion, from either the government or
private sector, may be classified.
Three new categories of classifiable
information have been added. Ac
cess to documents under the Free
dom of Information Act will also be
affected.
The current order, adopted under
the Carter administration, permits
classification only if "identifiable"
damage to the national security
might otherwise result and explicitly
excludes "basic scientific research
not clearly related to the national se
curity."
These limitations have been
dropped in the Reagan draft, al
though the committee has been told
that the second will be reinstated
before the order is signed, a commit
tee staff member told the Daily. The
executive order does not require
congressional approval.
"We are concerned about the or

der as much for its ambiguity as for
what is says explicitly," Rosenzweig
told the Daily. "It appears to leave
some issues open that had been
closed in earlier versions."
One of the categories added in the
draft is research in cryptography, or
secrecy codes, which is pursued here
and at other universities as well as by
the National Security Agency (NSA).
Many researchers already submit
their work voluntarily to the NSA
prior to publication under a pro
cedure formulated by the Public
Cryptography Study Group (PCSG)
of the American Council on Educa
tion.
Electrical Engineering Professor
Martin Hellman, who served on the
PCSG, said he is very concerned
about the new order and is also dis
turbed that the House Committee on
Government Operations, which re
cently held hearings on the order,
seems to have misconstrued the
PCSG report as supporting controls.
"We supported establishment of
pre-publication review on a trial, vol
untary basis," Hellman said. "This
should not be construed as support
for a mandatory system, which we
felt would not work, was not called
for and had serious constitutional
questions."
Hellman said he had been re
assured privately by Adm. Bobby In
man, deputy director of the CIA, of
the government's commitment to
voluntary measures, but added that
"I'd feel a lot more comfortable" if
In man stated this publicly. In man will
also be testifying at the hearirfgs to
day.
(The Daily has learned of reports in
the cryptographic community that
publication of two papers has been
postponed by the authors at the re
quest of the NSA).
"There is an extremely fine line be

tween basic mathematical research
and cryptography," according to
Professor Leonard Adleman of the
University of Southern California. "It
would be difficult to make an ap
propriate judgement" as to vvhat
should be classified.
"The private sector is in vital need"
of cryptographic technology,
Adleman said, and classification
might impede its development.
In a controversial speech last Janu
ary, Inman proposed that technical
papers in critical fields such as com
puters, lasers, crop projection and
manufacturing processes be subject
to prepublication review.
Rosenzweig does not see volun
tary submission of research for gov
ernment review as a solution. "My
sense is that the more widely agree
ments of that sort were to be ex
tended . . . the closer we would be to
the next steps, namely, required pre
screening and government control
over the decision to publish."
Rather, he rejects "the premise
that our national security is threat
ened by the free communication that
marks our system of science."
