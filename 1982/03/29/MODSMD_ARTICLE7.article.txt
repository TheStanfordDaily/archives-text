## Arabian students struggle to survive amid West Bank strife 
### Los Angeles Times 
Ramallah, Israeli-occupied
West Bank — To get a college
education on the West Bank,
an Arab student needs, in addi
tion to the usual academic re
quirements, the ability to sense
when trouble is brewing and a
handy place to hide.
The four four-year colleges
in the territory are increasingly
the scenes of violence, usually
pitting pro-Palestine Liber
ation Organization students
armed with potentialy lethal
rocks against Israeli soldiers
who enforce the occupation
with tear gas and sometimes
bullets.
Twice this year, Israeli au
thorities have ordered Birzeit
University near Ramallah
closed for extensive periods
following violent disturbances.
University officials say they will
be fortunate if they can com
plete the fall semester by mid
june. Two other institutions —
Najah University in Nablus and
Bethlehem University — also
have been closed, although for
shorter periods. Both of those
colleges expect to complete
two semesters of classes this
year, although they may have
to run far into the summer to
do it.
One faculty member said,
with perhaps a touch of hyper
bole, that the combination of
student politics and military in
terference disrupts the educa
tional program "about 99.9
percent."
Everyone agrees that the sit
uation is deplorable. The Israeli
authorities blame student and
faculty militants and the PLO.
University administrators, fac
ulty and students mostly blame
the soldiers and the Israeli gov

ernment. There seems to be lit
tle doubt that there is blame
enough to go around.
In addition to the military-
PLO confrontations, the West
Bank colleges face disputes be
tween their secular Arab stu
dents and Moslem fundamen
talists. At Najah University, a
left-wing secular lecturer was
seriously injured when he was
forced to jump out of a high
window to escape a gang of Is
lamic zealots.
The fanatic Moslem Broth
erhood is also active at Birzeit
and Bethlehem universities al
though not to the extent that it
is at Najah where a fundamen
talist slate recently swept the
student council elections. The
council was promptly sus
pended by university author
ities.
University students have
often taken the lead in demon
strating against the Israeli oc
cupation, but the campuses
were unusually quiet last week
when violent disturbances
broke out throughout the West
Bank to protest the Israeli de
cision to dismiss the elected
Palestinian mayor and town
council of El Bireh.
Nevertheless, all involved
agreed that the universities
would not remain quiet for
long.
The big losers in the continu
ing confrontations are students
who prefer education to poli
tics. Far more than their coun
terparts on American cam
puses in the turbulent 19605,
these students find themselves
caught in a situation that
threatens to destroy the aca
demic vitality of the university.
University administrators in
sist that the colleges are main

taining academic standards de
spite the problems.
Brother Thomas, an Ameri
can-born monk who is vice
chancellor of the Roman Cath
olic-supported Bethlehem
University, said, "We conduct
higher education with difficul
ty because of the political situ
ation. But I think we are able to
succeed in conducting an aca
demic program which meets
the international standards."
But a series of interviews
with students, all of whom re
quested anonymity, showed
that some clearly are on cam
pus for political purposes, to
help fight against the Israeli oc
cupation of the West Bank
area, taken from Jordan in the
1967 Six-Day War. Others, who
expressed no love for the Is
raelis either, said that they
were more interested in educa
tion than in demonstration. For
this second group, campus life
can be a harrowing ex
perience.
One student said that mili
tants frequently force students
to take part in demonstrations
against the Israeli regime, often
guarding exits from the cam
pus to assure maximum partici
pation. Almost always these
demonstrations are broken up
by troops who arrest large
numbers of students, in
variably including some who
participated involuntarily, he
said. »
"When I see a demonstra
tion is about to start, I try to es
cape, "anotherstudentsaid. "If
you are arrested, maybe you
will get a year in prison. There
was a demonstration recently
and I was able to slip through
the trees and get on a bus. But I
was very afraid."
Another student said, "If I'm
at the university, I'm forced to
be in the demonstration. If I'm
outside, I stay outside."

Ramallah, Israeli-occupied
West Bank — To get a college
education on the West Bank,
an Arab student needs, in addi
tion to the usual academic re
quirements, the ability to sense
when trouble is brewing and a
handy place to hide.
The four four-year colleges
in the territory are increasingly
the scenes of violence, usually
pitting pro-Palestine Liber
ation Organization students
armed with potentialy lethal
rocks against Israeli soldiers
who enforce the occupation
with tear gas and sometimes
bullets.
Twice this year, Israeli au
thorities have ordered Birzeit
University near Ramallah
closed for extensive periods
following violent disturbances.
University officials say they will
be fortunate if they can com
plete the fall semester by mid
june. Two other institutions —
Najah University in Nablus and
Bethlehem University — also
have been closed, although for
shorter periods. Both of those
colleges expect to complete
two semesters of classes this
year, although they may have
to run far into the summer to
do it.
One faculty member said,
with perhaps a touch of hyper
bole, that the combination of
student politics and military in
terference disrupts the educa
tional program "about 99.9
percent."
Everyone agrees that the sit
uation is deplorable. The Israeli
authorities blame student and
faculty militants and the PLO.
University administrators, fac
ulty and students mostly blame
the soldiers and the Israeli gov

ernment. There seems to be lit
tle doubt that there is blame
enough to go around.
In addition to the military-
PLO confrontations, the West
Bank colleges face disputes be
tween their secular Arab stu
dents and Moslem fundamen
talists. At Najah University, a
left-wing secular lecturer was
seriously injured when he was
forced to jump out of a high
window to escape a gang of Is
lamic zealots.
The fanatic Moslem Broth
erhood is also active at Birzeit
and Bethlehem universities al
though not to the extent that it
is at Najah where a fundamen
talist slate recently swept the
student council elections. The
council was promptly sus
pended by university author
ities.
University students have
often taken the lead in demon
strating against the Israeli oc
cupation, but the campuses
were unusually quiet last week
when violent disturbances
broke out throughout the West
Bank to protest the Israeli de
cision to dismiss the elected
Palestinian mayor and town
council of El Bireh.
Nevertheless, all involved
agreed that the universities
would not remain quiet for
long.
The big losers in the continu
ing confrontations are students
who prefer education to poli
tics. Far more than their coun
terparts on American cam
puses in the turbulent 19605,
these students find themselves
caught in a situation that
threatens to destroy the aca
demic vitality of the university.
University administrators in
sist that the colleges are main

taining academic standards de
spite the problems.
Brother Thomas, an Ameri
can-born monk who is vice
chancellor of the Roman Cath
olic-supported Bethlehem
University, said, "We conduct
higher education with difficul
ty because of the political situ
ation. But I think we are able to
succeed in conducting an aca
demic program which meets
the international standards."
But a series of interviews
with students, all of whom re
quested anonymity, showed
that some clearly are on cam
pus for political purposes, to
help fight against the Israeli oc
cupation of the West Bank
area, taken from Jordan in the
1967 Six-Day War. Others, who
expressed no love for the Is
raelis either, said that they
were more interested in educa
tion than in demonstration. For
this second group, campus life
can be a harrowing ex
perience.
