# Honduras: surrounded in a 'circle of fire'
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tegucigalpa, Honduras — Mountainous
little Honduras is growing more and more
worried about the turmoil around it in
Central America, and the worry is driving it
deeper into its traditional dependence on
the United States.
That was reflected last week in an edito
rial in the Tegucigalpa newspaper La Trib
una. Honduras, the newspaper said, was
surrounded by "a circle of fire" and had to
defend its democracy, sovereignty and ter
ritory "within this black panorama of vio
lence and destruction."
All three of Honduras' neighbors stir
concern. To the southeast, the Sandinista
government of Nicaragua is expanding its
military forces and, according to the U.S.
government, is secretly transporting large
quantities of arms across Honduran terri
tory to the leftist rebels in El Salvador. To
the southwest, a civil war is enervating El
Salvador and the outcome is far from cer
tain. To the West, Guatemala is riven by a
guerrilla insurrection, interminable kill
ings of leftists and Indians, and, now, a mil
itary coup.
Out of this concern, Honduras has

turned to the United States for even more
help than usual. In the most dramatic re
sponse, the U.S. military has increased its
presence here to about 90 men, most of
them members of the U.S. Special Forces
training the Honduran armed forces.
These' American soldiers — the sensitive
U.S. Embassy refuses to call them "green
berets" — outnumber the contingent of 55
Americans in El Salvador that has caused so
much public debate in the United States.
Military training, however, is only part of
a relatively large program of assistance to
Honduras, which is regarded as the sec
ond-poorest country in Latin America,
richer than only Haiti. With a population of
3.7 million, Honduras has 200 American
Peace Corps volunteers, the sixth-largest
Peace Corps program in the world.
Honduras, as U.S. Ambassador John D.
Negroponte put it in a recent interview,
"has a sympathetic audience in the United
States."
Honduras is not entirely an innocent vic
tim of the turmoil around it. Nicaraguan
exiles — some of them followers of the late
dictator Anastasio Somoza, some of them
defectors from the Sandinistas, some of

them Miskito Indians — reportedly oper
ate several camps within Honduras from
which they mount incursions into
Nicaragua, killing soldiers and sabotaging
bridges.
Honduras denies that it allows the use of
its territory to stage foreign invasions, but a
few journalists trying to visit one of those
camps recently found their way blocked
by Honduran soldiers.
In a recent interview, Col. Mark Rich
ards, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command headquartered in Panama, esti
mated that 500 to 2,000 Nicaraguans oper
ated out of these Honduran camps.
"These camps are not sponsored by
Honduras," Richards said. "But Honduras
makes no effort to run them out of there.
Why the hell should they?"
Although U.S. officials insist that if El
Salvador and Guatemala join Nicaragua as
leftist states, Honduras might eventually
be forced to follow, it is still difficult to un
derstand how Honduras has so far man
aged to escape the kind of leftist guerrilla
challenge that has shaken so much of the
rest of Central America.
