New Spring Quarter Course
African & Afro-American
Studies 248
SOCIOLOGY OF KNOWLEDGE
AND THE BLACK EXPERIENCE
TTH 10-12, ULib 156, Wynter, 5 units
This course will use the main proposition of Carter G Woodson
that "if you control how a man thinks, you control how he will act" to
argue that the normative system of knowledge of each social order
is designed similar to a road blueprint, orienting our ways of se
eing, knowing, valuing, choosing, desiring, acting. The course will
analyze the "blueprints" of the official ways of thought of the
specific human system in which we live. It is particularly relevant
about the origins and "sociology" of that reflex mode of thinking
that we call "racism."
