Auditing
Students who register on a full-time basis are considered to have the privilege
of the University and may, with the consent of the instructors, audit lecture
courses in addition to the program taken for credit. Students registered on some
partial basis (such as half-tuition) may not audit additional courses without
payment of the regular tuition that would be charged for credit registration.
Changing from auditing basis to credit basis or vice versa is not permitted after the
published deadline for changing study lists.
Persons not registered at Stanford are permitted to audit only under unusual
circumstances; permission may be granted by the Associate Registrar on pay
ment of the Attendance Permit fee of $560 per quarter.
Stanford alumni and their spouses may register on Attendance Permit basis on
request and upon payment of the Attendance Permit Fee.
Faculty may attend another faculty member's class upon his or her invitation.
A member of the University staff may audit lecture courses with a letter from the
department head that auditing will not interfere with normal duties and that the
course in question will contribute to the ability to perform the assignment.
Spouses of University faculty and staff may audit lecture courses. In both of the
above cases a Courtesy card should be obtained from the Associate Registrar
(Room 137). In all cases of auditing the instructor's consent is requested.
No person should attend any class unless he or she is in one of the classifica
tions above.
