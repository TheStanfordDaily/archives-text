ADVENTURE
Some graduates like routine assignments. Others prefer technological
adventuring at, or beyond, the limits of the current state-of-the-art.
We would like to talk to the Adventurers.
Here's why. Our basic and applied research is in areas such as: high-energy
laser optics, infrared electro-optical systems, fiber optics; semiconductor,
microprocessor applications, sensor and actuator development; energy
conversion; materials technology; gas turbine technology, fluid dynamics,
emissions, combustion, noise, controls; V/STOL technology; manufacturing
technology, controls, CAD/CAM, robotics; automotive technology; industrial
and military systems analysis; computer sciences; scientific/commercial
programming; instrument research, design and development.
Over the past five years, United Technologies spent $2.5 billion on research
and development; during the next five years, there are plans to spend
another $4 billion or more.
Think about it!
To learn more, see us on campus, or write to Mr. F. M. Marcin at the United
Technologies Research Center, East Hartford, Connecticut 06108.
Positions are available at both the Optics & Applied Technology Laboratory,
West Palm Beach, Florida and East Hartford, Connecticut.
