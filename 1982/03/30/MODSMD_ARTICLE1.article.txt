# TMU restructuring draws fire
## 
### Mike Thurman Senior staff writer 
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Oppenheim's plan to
reorganize the staff structure of the union has sparked
concerns among some Tresidder program staff members
and a Tresidder Union Board student member's com
plaint that the board had been left out of the decision
making process.
During a March 3 meeting of the Union Board, Op
penheim announced her decision to promote Market
ing Coordinator Nartci Howe to the position of assistant
director, replacing Greg Larson, who had previously an
nounced his intention to leave Tresidder this summer.
She also introduced the new organization plan, which
will increase the number of responsibilities assigned to
that assistant director. The assistant director will remain
responsible for the marketing side of Tresidder, oversee
ing the operation of the Tresidder food services; how
ever, the position will expand to oversee the program
side of the organization. The program division currently
reports directly to Oppenheim.
The plan was presented to the board for information
only, and no vote was proposed.
Reflecting their concern that the new structure could
change the successful course of the Student Arts at Stan
ford (STARTS) program, Tresidder Program Director
Jean Martin and Assistant Program Director Lisa Ver
hovek have submitted an alternative reorganization pro
posal for Oppenheim's consideration.
"In my view," Oppenheim said, "the decision to ex
pand the assistant director position will allow usto better
support our staff structure. The assistant director will as
sume a greater program coordination role to provide
greater strength and more staff time to programming."
"It's an opportunity," she said, "to spread STARTS'
good work to outdoor programming, indoor program
ming, athletic events and student volunteer training."
Oppenheim also said that the new structure would
"streamline the rather cumbersome communication
channel that STARTS presently has to work with" by co
ordinating all program fund requests under the assistant
director position.
The other assistant director, Larry Davidson, is respon
sible for facilities and maintenance.
Mariann Byerwalter, an ex officio member of the
Union Board and a member of the ASSIJ Council of Pres
idents, voiced her concern that Oppenheim had failed

to include the students and staff members who sit on the
board on a topic as important as the staff reorganization.
"She changed the structure ot the organization,"
Byerwalter said. "She moved this person from a non-pol
icy-making position to a position making policy de
cisions."
"Some on the Union Board argued that it was a per
sonneldecisionandthatthe Union Board shouldn't have
been involved, but I argued that the structural changes
were policy decisions and the Union Board should have
been involved," she continued.
Rob Parker, director of University personnel and a
board member, said that the board's charter states that
the board will not be involved in personnel decisions.
"I don't think that the reorganization or the personnel
changes tamper in any way with the policies of program
ming that Tresidder is committed to ... so I guess I don't
see it as a policy change," Parker said.
Byerwalter was also concerned that the board was not
involved in a search for the new position created under
the plan. Without criticizing Howe, Byerwalter said that
Howe's position would be strengthened by surviving a
search process.
Oppenheim said that search committees will be
created to help fill the marketing coordinator position as
well as the assistant program director position, which
Verhovek has planned to leave this summer.
Verhovek said she is concerned that the new structure
could allow an imbalance to develop between the social
programs designed to promote Tresidder and the cul
tural programs designed to compliment the University's
academic programs.
"One of my big problems with the reorganization,"
Verhovek said, "is that this assistant director will be
working closely with marketing, food services and pro
grams. I feel that it's very important that the goals of
these three areas remain separate . . . that the marketing
goals remain distinct from the program goals."
"I think the program should have our own director
who concentrates on program goals within the context
of Tresidder's overall goals," she continued.
However, Verhovek added that her concerns do not
reflect on Howe's ability to perform well as an assistant
director and that she would support Oppenheim's final
decision.
The alternative reorganization
proposal suggests a structure that
would increase contact between the
STARTS program director and the
Tresidder director while keeping the
program side distinct from the mar
keting side, according to Verhovek.
In a memorandum to Oppenheim,
Martin expressed her concern that
the STARTS program continue to
function successfully.
"As far as the students are con
cerned," Martin wrote, "there needs
to be a strong show of confidence in
the program and in the future of

STARTS. There also needs to be a
clear understanding that the STARTS
programs will be allowed to continue
on their present successful course
without any threat to their present
momentum."
"I don't expect any change in the
basic STARTS programs," said
Martin, "and it's my intent that they
will not change."
Oppenheim said that her intent
was not to change the Tresidder pro
grams but rather to strengthen them.
"I think that programs are the life
blood of any college union," said
Oppenheim. "It's very much my aim
to continue to strengthen pro
grams."

nounced his intention to leave Tresidder this summer.
She also introduced the new organization plan, which
will increase the number of responsibilities assigned to
that assistant director. The assistant director will remain
responsible for the marketing side of Tresidder, oversee
ing the operation of the Tresidder food services; how
ever, the position will expand to oversee the program
side of the organization. The program division currently
reports directly to Oppenheim.
The plan was presented to the board for information
only, and no vote was proposed.
Reflecting their concern that the new structure could
change the successful course of the Student Arts at Stan
ford (STARTS) program, Tresidder Program Director
Jean Martin and Assistant Program Director Lisa Ver
hovek have submitted an alternative reorganization pro
posal for Oppenheim's consideration.
"In my view," Oppenheim said, "the decision to ex
pand the assistant director position will allow usto better
support our staff structure. The assistant director will as
sume a greater program coordination role to provide
greater strength and more staff time to programming."
"It's an opportunity," she said, "to spread STARTS'
good work to outdoor programming, indoor program
ming, athletic events and student volunteer training."
Oppenheim also said that the new structure would
"streamline the rather cumbersome communication
channel that STARTS presently has to work with" by co
ordinating all program fund requests under the assistant
director position.
The other assistant director, Larry Davidson, is respon
sible for facilities and maintenance.
Mariann Byerwalter, an ex officio member of the
Union Board and a member of the ASSIJ Council of Pres
idents, voiced her concern that Oppenheim had failed

to include the students and staff members who sit on the
board on a topic as important as the staff reorganization.
"She changed the structure ot the organization,"
Byerwalter said. "She moved this person from a non-pol
icy-making position to a position making policy de
cisions."
"Some on the Union Board argued that it was a per
sonneldecisionandthatthe Union Board shouldn't have
been involved, but I argued that the structural changes
were policy decisions and the Union Board should have
been involved," she continued.
Rob Parker, director of University personnel and a
board member, said that the board's charter states that
the board will not be involved in personnel decisions.
"I don't think that the reorganization or the personnel
changes tamper in any way with the policies of program
ming that Tresidder is committed to ... so I guess I don't
see it as a policy change," Parker said.
Byerwalter was also concerned that the board was not
involved in a search for the new position created under
the plan. Without criticizing Howe, Byerwalter said that
Howe's position would be strengthened by surviving a
search process.
Oppenheim said that search committees will be
created to help fill the marketing coordinator position as
well as the assistant program director position, which
Verhovek has planned to leave this summer.
Verhovek said she is concerned that the new structure
could allow an imbalance to develop between the social
programs designed to promote Tresidder and the cul
tural programs designed to compliment the University's
academic programs.
"One of my big problems with the reorganization,"
Verhovek said, "is that this assistant director will be
working closely with marketing, food services and pro
grams. I feel that it's very important that the goals of
these three areas remain separate . . . that the marketing
goals remain distinct from the program goals."
"I think the program should have our own director
who concentrates on program goals within the context
of Tresidder's overall goals," she continued.
However, Verhovek added that her concerns do not
reflect on Howe's ability to perform well as an assistant
director and that she would support Oppenheim's final
decision.
The alternative reorganization
proposal suggests a structure that
would increase contact between the
STARTS program director and the
Tresidder director while keeping the
program side distinct from the mar
keting side, according to Verhovek.
In a memorandum to Oppenheim,
Martin expressed her concern that
the STARTS program continue to
function successfully.
"As far as the students are con
cerned," Martin wrote, "there needs
to be a strong show of confidence in
the program and in the future of

STARTS. There also needs to be a
clear understanding that the STARTS
programs will be allowed to continue
on their present successful course
without any threat to their present
momentum."
"I don't expect any change in the
basic STARTS programs," said
Martin, "and it's my intent that they
will not change."
Oppenheim said that her intent
was not to change the Tresidder pro
grams but rather to strengthen them.
"I think that programs are the life
blood of any college union," said
Oppenheim. "It's very much my aim
to continue to strengthen pro
grams."
Tresidder Union Director Ellie Oppenheim's plan to
reorganize the staff structure of the union has sparked
concerns among some Tresidder program staff members
and a Tresidder Union Board student member's com
plaint that the board had been left out of the decision
making process.

penheim announced her decision to promote Market
ing Coordinator Nartci Howe to the position of assistant
