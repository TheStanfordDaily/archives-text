# X-rays could end exploratory surgery

The Medical Imaging Group, a coor
dinated effort of the Medical School
and the Department of Electrical Engi
neering here, is pioneering technology
that may someday replace exploratory
surgery.
While the group is working on a
number of diverse projects, multiple
energy imaging has been its most signif
icant area of research, according to Al
bert Macovski, head of the engineering
side of the group.
Multiple energy imaging represents a
vast improvement over conventional X
ray technology. "In conventional X
rays, you essentially take an X-ray beam
that is a broad spectrum of wavelengths
and there is nothing sensitive to indi
vidual wavelengths," said Macovski.
This phenomenon is similar to black
and white film being insensitive to dif
ferent colors. "As a result, all of the
body's tissues are superimposed on
each other and subtle structures are
missed."
"What we have been doing is study
ing ways to measure different parts of
the X-ray spectrum," said Macovski.
The method developed thus far in
volves pulsing X-rays of different
energy, meaning different
wavelengths, through the body. In

formation from each of the pulsesiscol
lected and synthesized in a computer.
Images can then be created on the im
age monitor by looking selectively at
different wavelengths of the X-rays.
This is useful because different sub
stances absorb different wavelengths.
For instance, bone will absorb primarily
long wavelengths, while soft tissue ab
sorbs shorter ones. Therefore, by ob
serving only specific wavelengths, a
doctor can examine just skeletal struc
ture for bone disease or soft tissue for
tumors.
This "wavelength selectivity" is con
trolled by a knob on their machine
which Macovski called "The Magic
Knob". By turning this knob, the opera
tor of the machine is able to make im
ages of parts of the body disappear and
reappear at will. According to
Macovski, one might compare it with
the hue control on a color television.
By utilizing the same information
used to create images on a monitor, the
machine can determine chemical com
position and density of body structures,
which allows doctors to assess the na
ture of tumors. Thus, exploratory
surgery could be replaced by an X-ray
examination.
According to Macovski, all the stud
ies they have been doing expose pa

tients to radiation levels comparable to
that of a chest X-ray. "The beauty of this
technique is that it obtains much more
information from similar radiation
doses."
Along with multiple energy imaging,
the Medical Imaging Group is actively
involved in ultrasound research.
"Basically, it (ultrasound) accomplishes
the same thing X-rays do except instead
of looking at energy transmitted, you
are looking at energy reflected," said
Macovski.
Another area of research for
Macovski's group is CAT (com
puterized tomography) scanning. This
technique is "an attempt to get an im
age similar to a cross-sectional slice
through the body,"said Macovski.
The most intriguing problem he
found was in constructing an image of
the beating heart. The difficulty here is
that because the heart is in constant
motion, images tend to appear blurred.
A method must be found to speed up
the scanning process so that each phase
of motion can be "frozen".
One drawback of this procedure is
the relatively high levels of radiation
the patient is exposed to: on the order
of 20-40 times that of the multiple
energy imaging process.
