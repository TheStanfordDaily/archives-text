## East Palo Alto voters to decide community status 
### Jeffrey Golden First in a series 
It is as densely populated as the cities that surround it, rib
boned with concrete and asphalt like all urban sections of
the Peninsula. But East Palo Alto, the 2 1 /? square mile section
of San Mateo County wedged between Palo Alto and San
Francisco Bay, is different from its neighbors in an essential,
defining sense: it is not a city.
All the services associated with city living are there, but
they are imported from other jurisdictions. Fire protection
comes from Menlo Park, natural gas from Belmont. Numer
ous sewer and water districts form a crazy-quilt map across
the community, which has control over neither service.
And police protection, public improvements, and a cluster
of other services come from the county seat in Redwood
City. There is a hint here of Gertrude Stein's comment
about Oakland. "There is," she said, "no there there."
The arrangement suits some of East Palo Alto's 18,000 resi
dents quite well. "We're riding on the coattails of a rich
county," says a young auto mechanic who has lived very
near the Bayshore Freeway for 12 years. "I'd sure like things
to stay that way."
They well may not. On April 13, the people of East Palo
Alto will decide in a special election whetherto incorporate
as an independent city. Passage of the measure would be
thesuccessful climax of two years' work by the East Palo Alto
Citizens' Committee on Incorporation (EPACCI). The
group was formed by the East Palo Alto Municipal Council,
a five-member board established in 1967 by the state legisla
ture to advise county supervisors on East Palo Alto issues.
As chair of the Municipal Council, which has no legisla
tive or executive power of its own, Barbara Mouton is the
mayor of East Palo Alto. She is also an outspoken leader of
EPACCI. "We have been the stepchild of San Mateo Coun
ty, and have not gotten the services we need and merit,"
says Mouton. "The county supervisors are not equipped to
run a municipality."
With voter approval, Mouton's municipality would be
come the city of East Palo Alto on July 1, run by a five-mem
ber city council that will also be elected on April 13. A city
manager would be appointed by the council members, who
assume office only if incorporation isapproved. Mouton isa
candidate for the council. The process of "helping to create
a city" exhilirates her. "When I'm ashes," she says,"I know
I'll leave something behind."
Some of Mouton's neighbors doubt whether that
achievement should make anyone proud. Incorporation
has become a hotly disputed issue in East Palo Alto, fueled
by strong emotions, complicated by geographic, economic,
and possibly racial divisions within the community and con
fused by unending reams of official reports. Reports so
amended and revised over the months, that they reach in
consistent conclusions about the potential of an in
corporated East Palo Alto to support itself. Charges of hy
pocrisy and political opportunism fly between the partisans
in both directions.
The rhetorical storm has swirled around every phase of
the long incorporation process. Before the issue could be
put to a vote, it needed the endorsement of the country's
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), which is
charged with preventing the chaotic and ill-planned pro
liferation of new cities.
EPACCI's Mouton sees LAFCo as antagonistic to her
cause. "They did everything they could do to defeat us,"
she says. It was at LAFCo's suggestion that EPPACI gave its
proposition the wording it will have on the April ballot.
Besides endorsing incorporation, voters will have to ap
prove four other measures that call for the dissolution of
East Palo Alto's sanitation, recreation, water, and county
service districts.
If just one of the five measures fail, the entire proposition
is defeated. Mouton says EPPACI was misled into adopting
this wording, and that East Palo Alto should be able to vote
incorporation up or down by itself, without qualifications,
just as the citizens of Dublin did two years ago. A senior
member of the LAFCo staff would not respond to the
charge, saying "I wouldn't give you a printable answer."
LAFCo is also criticized for modifying the proposed
boundaries of incorporation. It first removed the small area
lying west of the Bayshore Freeway, which has 4000 resi

dents. The relatively high property values of the West
Bayshore would make it especially important to a new city's
tax base, so EPPACI saw the exclusion as a serious loss.
Mouton also believes that racial factors were at work. The
West Bayshore is predominantly white, while East Palo Alto
as a whole is more than 60 percent black and Hispanic, ac
cording to 1970 census figures.
LAFCo said the decision was based on a petition, signed
by one quarter of the West Bayshore property owners, that
favored annexation of that neighborhood to the adjacent
city of Menlo Park.
LAFCo then commissioned Angus McDonald and As
sociates, a private consulting firm, to study the economic
viability of the remaining region, lying entirely east of the
Bayshore. McDonald summarized the area's expected ex
penditures and revenues and concluded that the East
Bayshore could not support itself as a city. Based on that fin
ding, LAFCo voted last September to place the East
Bayshore in a "holding sphere," delaying any vote on in
corporation for at least a year pending further study.
One month and one McDonald report later, LAFCo
changed its position. It divided the previously-excluded
West Bayshore into two parts, readmitting the section south
of Euclid Avenue to the proposed incorporation bound
aries. Only the "North Euclid" area, with hopes of being an
nexed by Menlo Park, was to be left out of the proposal.
McDonald reported that his new configuration would im
prove East Palo Alto's fiscal balance, but that the economic
viability of a new city was still doubtful.
Shortly thereafter, LAFCo voted 3-2 to submit to the vot
ers the proposal to incorporate the East Bayshore and the
West Bayshore/South Euclid Areas as the city of East Palo
Alto.
The new vote infuriated Arn Cenedella, who called it "an
unprincipled flip-flop." Cenedella, a realtor who owns his
own home in the West Bayshore/South Euclidarea, isactive
in a drive to have the entire West Bayshore annexed by
Menlo Park.
The endorsement of incorporation, Cenedella charges,
shows that LAFCo, two of whose members are also San
Mateo County supervisors, was motivated by the interest of
the county and not East Palo Alto. He refers to a county
memo issued between LAFCo votes that predicted "serious
problems in maintaining" a net subsidy of $500,000 per year
for East Palo Alto.
"So the County wants East Palo Alto to incorporate just to
get it off the county books," says Cenedella. "There are
problems in East Palo Alto that the county is just tired of
dealing with."
Tomorrow more controversy surrounding the problems of
incorporation and a look at overcoming obstacles.

EPACCI's Mouton sees LAFCo as antagonistic to her
cause. "They did everything they could do to defeat us,"
she says. It was at LAFCo's suggestion that EPPACI gave its
proposition the wording it will have on the April ballot.
Besides endorsing incorporation, voters will have to ap
prove four other measures that call for the dissolution of
East Palo Alto's sanitation, recreation, water, and county
service districts.
If just one of the five measures fail, the entire proposition
is defeated. Mouton says EPPACI was misled into adopting
this wording, and that East Palo Alto should be able to vote
incorporation up or down by itself, without qualifications,
just as the citizens of Dublin did two years ago. A senior
member of the LAFCo staff would not respond to the
charge, saying "I wouldn't give you a printable answer."
LAFCo is also criticized for modifying the proposed
boundaries of incorporation. It first removed the small area
lying west of the Bayshore Freeway, which has 4000 resi

dents. The relatively high property values of the West
Bayshore would make it especially important to a new city's
tax base, so EPPACI saw the exclusion as a serious loss.
Mouton also believes that racial factors were at work. The
West Bayshore is predominantly white, while East Palo Alto
as a whole is more than 60 percent black and Hispanic, ac
cording to 1970 census figures.
LAFCo said the decision was based on a petition, signed
by one quarter of the West Bayshore property owners, that
favored annexation of that neighborhood to the adjacent
city of Menlo Park.
LAFCo then commissioned Angus McDonald and As
sociates, a private consulting firm, to study the economic
viability of the remaining region, lying entirely east of the
Bayshore. McDonald summarized the area's expected ex
penditures and revenues and concluded that the East
Bayshore could not support itself as a city. Based on that fin
ding, LAFCo voted last September to place the East
Bayshore in a "holding sphere," delaying any vote on in
corporation for at least a year pending further study.
One month and one McDonald report later, LAFCo
changed its position. It divided the previously-excluded
West Bayshore into two parts, readmitting the section south
of Euclid Avenue to the proposed incorporation bound
aries. Only the "North Euclid" area, with hopes of being an
nexed by Menlo Park, was to be left out of the proposal.
McDonald reported that his new configuration would im
prove East Palo Alto's fiscal balance, but that the economic
viability of a new city was still doubtful.
Shortly thereafter, LAFCo voted 3-2 to submit to the vot
ers the proposal to incorporate the East Bayshore and the
West Bayshore/South Euclid Areas as the city of East Palo
Alto.
The new vote infuriated Arn Cenedella, who called it "an
unprincipled flip-flop." Cenedella, a realtor who owns his
own home in the West Bayshore/South Euclidarea, isactive
in a drive to have the entire West Bayshore annexed by
Menlo Park.
The endorsement of incorporation, Cenedella charges,
shows that LAFCo, two of whose members are also San
Mateo County supervisors, was motivated by the interest of
the county and not East Palo Alto. He refers to a county
memo issued between LAFCo votes that predicted "serious
problems in maintaining" a net subsidy of $500,000 per year
for East Palo Alto.
"So the County wants East Palo Alto to incorporate just to
get it off the county books," says Cenedella. "There are
problems in East Palo Alto that the county is just tired of
dealing with."
Tomorrow more controversy surrounding the problems of
incorporation and a look at overcoming obstacles.

FUTURE CITY — (Right)
East Palo Alto currently
uses Menlo Park's fire
services as well as the ser
vices of other local com
munities. (Upper right) If
the community decides
to incorporate in a spe
cial election April 13 this
sign may change to say
"The City of last Palo
Alto."
It is as densely populated as the cities that surround it, rib
boned with concrete and asphalt like all urban sections of
the Peninsula. But East Palo Alto, the 2 1 /? square mile section
of San Mateo County wedged between Palo Alto and San
Francisco Bay, is different from its neighbors in an essential,
defining sense: it is not a city.
All the services associated with city living are there, but
they are imported from other jurisdictions. Fire protection
comes from Menlo Park, natural gas from Belmont. Numer
ous sewer and water districts form a crazy-quilt map across
the community, which has control over neither service.
And police protection, public improvements, and a cluster
of other services come from the county seat in Redwood
City. There is a hint here of Gertrude Stein's comment
about Oakland. "There is," she said, "no there there."
The arrangement suits some of East Palo Alto's 18,000 resi
dents quite well. "We're riding on the coattails of a rich
county," says a young auto mechanic who has lived very
near the Bayshore Freeway for 12 years. "I'd sure like things
to stay that way."
They well may not. On April 13, the people of East Palo
Alto will decide in a special election whetherto incorporate
as an independent city. Passage of the measure would be
thesuccessful climax of two years' work by the East Palo Alto
Citizens' Committee on Incorporation (EPACCI). The
group was formed by the East Palo Alto Municipal Council,
a five-member board established in 1967 by the state legisla
ture to advise county supervisors on East Palo Alto issues.
As chair of the Municipal Council, which has no legisla
tive or executive power of its own, Barbara Mouton is the
mayor of East Palo Alto. She is also an outspoken leader of
EPACCI. "We have been the stepchild of San Mateo Coun
ty, and have not gotten the services we need and merit,"
says Mouton. "The county supervisors are not equipped to
run a municipality."
With voter approval, Mouton's municipality would be
come the city of East Palo Alto on July 1, run by a five-mem
ber city council that will also be elected on April 13. A city
manager would be appointed by the council members, who
assume office only if incorporation isapproved. Mouton isa
candidate for the council. The process of "helping to create
a city" exhilirates her. "When I'm ashes," she says,"I know
I'll leave something behind."
Some of Mouton's neighbors doubt whether that
achievement should make anyone proud. Incorporation
has become a hotly disputed issue in East Palo Alto, fueled
by strong emotions, complicated by geographic, economic,
and possibly racial divisions within the community and con
fused by unending reams of official reports. Reports so
amended and revised over the months, that they reach in
consistent conclusions about the potential of an in
corporated East Palo Alto to support itself. Charges of hy
pocrisy and political opportunism fly between the partisans
in both directions.
The rhetorical storm has swirled around every phase of
the long incorporation process. Before the issue could be
put to a vote, it needed the endorsement of the country's
Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo), which is
charged with preventing the chaotic and ill-planned pro
liferation of new cities.
