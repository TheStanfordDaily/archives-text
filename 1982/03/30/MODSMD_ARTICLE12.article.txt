## The 						windows of vulnerability 
### 
Those who do not know history are
doomed to repeat it. The audience
that listened to the recent speech
here by Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger should feel uneasy as it
contemplates this dictum. Wein
berger's theme that the Soviet Union
is pursuing the goal of world-wide
communism through military ex
pansionism was sharply reminiscent
of the cold war rhetoric of John
Foster Dulles. Not only was Wein
berger's speech thematically similar
to many of those by Dulles, but it was
conceptually similar as well in that it
grossly simplified the situation to the
point of being an outright distorted
view of reality.
Weinberger's ravings about a
"window of vulnerability" recall the
misplaced fears in the early '60s over
a non-existent "missile gap" in the
Soviet Union's favor. As in the '60s,
there is no"windowof vulnerability"
favoring the Soviet Union. While the
Soviets were engaging in a highly
publicized and very expensive
buildup of successive generations of
missiles, the United States was quietly
improving the capability of existing
missiles. Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wisc.), a
noted arms specialist, reported that
the U.S. approach was 6.4 times as
cost-effective in terms of increase in
accuracy per dollar than the Soviet
approach.
The "window" scenario in which
the Soviet Union destroys U.S. mis
siles using only some of its missiles to
do so and then deters the United
States from retaliating by holding the
rest in readiness is absurdly unlikely.
The Soviet Union would be insane to
undertake such a move under the as
sumption that the United States
would take a nuclear strike sitting
down. The Soviets could also never
be sure that the United States would
not have enough missiles left be
tween its land-based ICBMs and its
virtually invulnerable subs to launch
a strike against the remaining Soviet
missiles with only half of its missiles,
saving the rest to deter a Soviet sec

ond strike.
The uncertainties of launching a
first strike and the massive costs of a
nuclear war make "window of vul
nerability" arguments ridiculous: if
there isto bea nuclear war, it will cer
tainly not be one that either side can
confidently enter into with the idea
that it will emerge without suffering
incomprehensible damage.
The Soviets have far more reason
than the United States to fear a "win
dow of vulnerability" â€” the Pershing
II missiles that the United States is
planning to install in Europe would
take five minutes to strike the Soviet
Union, about one-third of the time
that the fastest Soviet strike on the
United States would take.
If there is a nuclear imbalance,
(which is unlikely given the essential
equality of our mutually assured de
structive capabilities,) it is one which
favors the United States.
The Soviets are also in a far more
insecure strategic position than the
United States. If one considers the
hysteria in the United States over
Cuba even before the Cuban missile
crisis and then compares this situ
ation with that of the Soviets, who
feel compelled to protect their 4500
mile border with China with a 750,000
man nuclear-equipped army, the
strategically superior security situ
ation of the United States is readily
apparent.
How large would the United States
army be if we faced the Chinese or
the Soviets across a border one and
one-half times the length of our
border with Canada? Furthermore,
China's nuclear force is aimed almost
exclusively at the Soviet Union, mak
ing the Soviet Union the only super
power to face two nuclear forces on
its very borders (if one can count
Eastern Europe as a Soviet border). In
the United States, the dominoes are
thousands of miles away; in the Sovi
et Union, they are on the doorstep.
Another idea being expressed by
the new cold warriors is the absurd
notion that somehow the Soviets' ex
panded military might is finding ex
pression in foreign policy "suc
cesses" such as Afghanistan and Po
land. How is it that it is considered a
"success" when the Soviet Union
finds it necessary to mount a massive

and costly invasion to support a
faltering friendly government and
suppress rebellion in a neighboring
country? By what flight of reason is
Soviet-backed martial law in a vol
atile satellite a sign of Soviet power?
These are by no means Soviet suc
cesses, rather, they are monumental
failures. It was the failure of less cost
ly means of exerting control that in
both cases forced the Soviets to use
heavy-handed tactics. Any time that a
nation feels that it can only achieve
its ends by brute force, whether in
Afghanistan, El Salvador or Vietnam,
it is a sign not of military success but
of social and diplomatic failure.
This entire edifice of misconcep
tions that forms the foundation of the
Reagan administration's foreign poli
cy is held together by the belief the
the leaders of the Soviet Union are
hard-line ideologues bent on world
domination. Because they are global
ly expansionistic, we have to take an
aggressive stand against communism
in Korea, in Vietnam, in El Salvador.
Because they think a nuclear war is
winnable, we have to make sure that
we can win one.
The fallacy of such mirror-image
thinking is obvious: we feel that we
have to aggressively respond to their
aggression, while they feel that they
are responding aggressively to our
aggression. What comes first, the ag
gressive act or the aggressive re
sponse?
There are hard-line cold warriors
in the Soviet Union, just as there are
in the United States, but there are
moderate and reasonable leaders in
both nations as well. The true men
ace we face from the Soviet Union is
that the imminent transition in Soviet
leadership as the aged Politburo
members are replaced might take
place in a cold war atmosphere. If this
happens, the hard-liners in the Soviet
Union will prevail. Should this hap
pen, Soviet-U.S. relations will be con
flictual for some time to come. The
history of the cold war, with its cul
mination in the Cuban missile crisis,
is one that we would be well-advised
not to repeat in this age in which nu
clear destruction is only five minutes
away.
