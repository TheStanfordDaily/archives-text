## Science taught with Apples? 
### 
Washington — Steven Jobs is again
grabbing headlines, this time with an
offer to put a personal computer —
free of charge — in each of America's
75,000 public elementary and secon
dary schools.
The 27-year-old co-founder of Ap
ple Computer, Inc. says he wants to
help schools address a nagging
"computer illiteracy" problem
among young Americans. He's even
willing to give up $200-to-$3OO mil
lion worth of new "Apple ll's," each
with a retail value of about $2495.
There's a small catch, of course.
Jobs wants Congress to give his com
pany — or any other so interested —
a charitable tax deduction of up to 30
percent for the donation of high
tech equipment to public schools.
With the inevitable promotional
gain, Apple (which had $39.4 million
in net earnings last year on sales of
$335 million) would probably end up
ahead.
Though congressmen clamor
about deficits, many aren't distracted
by the $20-to-$3O million in potential
Treasury losses resulting from the so
called "Technology Act of 1982." At
last count, 43 House members had
signed their names to the legislation.
Given reductions in federal aid to
education and scientific research,
some sponsors believe Apple's ap
parent altruism is the sort of corpo
rate behavior that needs to be en
couraged.
"We're having a big problem get
ting kids to study math and science,"
contends Rep. Fortney Stark (D-
Calif.), a leading co-sponsor of the
"Apple bill." "If a tax break helps to
stimulate interest in technology and
technical education, then it's a good
investment."
Indeed, relatively few school dis
tricts have made such effort to inte
grate high technology into their cur
ricula. According to a survey pub
lished last year by the National Cen
ter for Educational Statistics, only one
in four public schools keeps a micro
computer for instructional use by
students; nearly one in five lacks ac
cess to computers of any sort.
Meanwhile, says Andrew Molnar,
a program director at the National
Science Foundation here, Great Brit
ain plans to have equipped each of its
schools with a micro-computer by
the end of this year. The Japanese
and French, among others, have also
made a national policy of computer
education.
Unfortunately, Steven Jobs' offer
to put an "Apple" in every U.S.
elementary and secondary school

doesn't begin to address two pecul
iarly American problems: a shortage
of competent math and science
teachers at every educational level
and the outdated nature of math and
science curricula.
Moreover, as computers are pro
moted at the pre-coliege level, ma
chines will effectively eliminate
much of the basic addition and sub
traction drudgery, forcing teachers
to devote more time to the meaning
and practical uses of numbers. Prob
lem-solving, concedes Richard An
derson of the Council of Scientific
Society Presidents, has been woefully
neglected over the years.
Stark and his fellow congressional
computer buffs may require Apple —
if the company doesn't volunteer —
to provide teacher training in return
for any favors on the tax side. Accord

ing to a House Ways and Means
Committee aide, there's also a
chance that provisions may be in
cluded in the Apple bill fordonations
to high-tech teacher training at the
college level.
Without adequate preparation,
however, we're fooling ourselves to
think computersalonearethesimple
answer to more high-minded foreign
competitors. Jobs' "Apple giveaway"
smells of a pork barrel as long as the
United States lacks a coherent educa
tion policy programmed forthe com
puter age.
And remember, Steve: There's no
point in "putting a chicken in every
pot" when no one knows how to
cook it.
