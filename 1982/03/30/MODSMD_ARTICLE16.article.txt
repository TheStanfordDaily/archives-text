## Nuclear fuel cycle data erroneous 
### 
Steve Borish seems to be guilty of a large measure of
arrogance himself, "Nuclear fuel cycle is harmful" (Dai
ly, March 2). His columnbegins with thehorror of nuclear
weapons and very quickly moves into the nuclear power
arena. To answer all of his errors would require a lengthy
rebuttal. I shall therefore confine my comments to his al
legations about leukemia and lung cancer in women and
about mine tailings.
Borish claims that, "Health studies (covering the years
1950-1969) of women in counties bordering the Oak
Ridge (Tenn.) enrichment plant show that these women
suffer from leukemia and lung cancer at four times the
normal rate." Since no reference is cited I compared the
mortality rates for Anderson and Roane counties in Ten
nessee with the United States and Tennessee average.
This data comes from DHEW Publication No. (NIH)
74-615), "U.S. Cancer Mortality by County: 1950-1969."

It is indeed fortunate that the Oak Ridge plant was not
built in any of the following areas because simple

minded analysis would dictate that the very high
leukemia rates were caused by its radioactive emissions.

County/State Rate per 100,000 Cases
McPherson, Nebraska 19.3 1
Billings, North Dakota 21.9 3
Barnes, North Dakota 22.2 7
San Benito, California 43.8 1
Lake, South Dakota 595.2 1
Caledonia, Vermont 404.4 1
When compared to the U.S. norm the above rates
would seem to be highly significant. However, the popu
lations are very small and so are the number of cases dis
covered. This is the nature of statistics. The populations
must be large enough and they must be comparable in
order to infer a true impact. This would seem to be a
good example of biased selection of data to exploit a
point of view (if not intellectual dishonesty).
On the matter of radon from uranium mine tailings,
this is not the only place where increased radon concen
trations occur. Studies have shown that energy efficient
homes in Sweden and Norway have high concentrations
of radon also. I don't hear very much yelling and scream
ing about this source of human exposure brought about
by the technology of conservation.
There is no question that nuclear warfare isa dangerto
all life on earth. My quarrel with Borish is that he dilutesJ
the legitimate arguments against nuclear warfare by irf-l
troducing or mixing in another very complex issue con
cerned with nuclear power. More to the point he seems
to be playing on the irrational fears of the public by citing
erroneous information about nuclear power in an at
tempt to link the two issues directly.
