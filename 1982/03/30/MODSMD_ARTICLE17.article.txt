## Stanford hiring policies attacked 
### 
Is the employment of black staff
members at Stanford better now than
it was a year ago?
If an institution is serious about the
employment of black people, that se
riousness will be reflected in middle
and upper managerial positions. The
best index, or report card, for the
University's performance in this area
is the Faculty/Staff Directory pub
lished each year. If a review is made
of the Executive Officers for 1981-82
on page 5, it can be found that only
two of approximately 77 positions are
filled by a black person; if the reader
prefers numbers, that is .02 percent.
If a quality assessment is made, it
means that there are no black ex
ecutives in the president's and prov
ost's offices, Business and Finance,
Development, Public Affairs, the
Medical Center, and University
Counsel. If this does not suffice, turn
to pages 6 and 7 and consider the Ac
ademic Executive Officers. There are
approximately 45 non-faculty posi
tions here, and only two black peo
ple are employed in them.
In summary, these data show that
the schools are as poor as central ad
ministration in the appointment of

black people to managerial posi
tions. What is more troublesome
here is that these positions rarely re
quire highly specialized skills, which
hirers usually (and incorrectly) pose
as being the reason for not hiring
blacks. In most instances the posi
tions require only generalists, no
Ph.Ds in mathematical linguistics or
the like.
Last year President Donald Ken
nedy said: "All of us profit from hav
ing the pluralism of American society
honestly represented in the institu
tions where we obtain higher educa
tion." And on another occasion he
said: "... I won't change a single
goal or a single objective that I think
of with respect to affirmative action if
all those (governmental) require
ments went out of existence tomor
row. I think its right to do what we're
doing."
In spite of Kennedy's statements,
his feelings are not trickling down to
his subordinates; or, the University's
Affirmative Action Office and its rep
resentatives are not properly trans
lating the president's statements into
action.
Too many personnel malpractices

continue that negatively impact the
hiring of blacks: positions are
created and occupied by people al
ready chosen; blacks continue tci
trail in being recruited, getting pro
motions and merit increases; nepo
tism is no longer discouraged by the
University's Administrative Guide,
but is endorsed; management based
on racial stereotypes is becoming
more acceptable, as majority man
agers are feeling that they, too, re
ceived a mandate from President
Ronald Reagan.
The critical issue remains: The Uni
versity is not compelled by law or in
ternal policy to have an affirmative
action program. If it is not going to
have a program of substance and re
sults, then it is an insult to its in
tended beneficiaries for it to con
tinue. It is common practice in many
activities to blame current ills on pre
vious administrations. It is true:
blacks faired extremely poorly in the
past University administration, and
many people had high hopes for the
current administration. I hope it was
well placed.
