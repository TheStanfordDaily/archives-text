## Review of Sequoia interview unfairly done 
### 
I thought it was rather odd that a
Daily book reviewer, Denny Dart,
gave us a negative review of our De
nise Levertov interview, which, by
Dart's own admission to me, she had
not even finished reading at the time
the review was published in your
newspaper.
She did, though, give us a fine re
view of the Gore Vidal interview; it's
just a shame that she has never seen a
copy of it.
I also thought it was strange that
she criticized the quality of our art
when she hadn't even seen all of the
prints, but had only asked us what
they were like.
But what I most wanted to ask you
is why, when reviewing our literary
magazine, didn't she review any of
the literature?
We are amused.

I think that someone at the Daily
should have been aware of what Se
quoia's really about, that this is the
best issue that's come out in the last
15 years, and that someone should
have questioned that totally fabri
cated and irresponsible review. I
have, since the day of the review's
publication, received an apology
from the reviewer in which she says
that the review "spoke worse of (her)
than of Sequoia." She also admitted
to having been overzealous and un
fair.
But what good is an apology to me?
You people printed the thing! How
many thousand copies?
She admitted to me that she hadn't
even read some of the stuff she
criticized. Is this responsible journal
ism? Write as many untruths as you
want and then send a little apology
note? I think it's ludicrous.

I should also point out that you ran
the article on an inside news page,
not on the book review page. Was
this, then, supposed to be an in
vestigative article? Need I say that
some of the things (i.e., Sequoia is
not a publication for student work)
were absolute lies and a disservice ta
our reputation with the students?
