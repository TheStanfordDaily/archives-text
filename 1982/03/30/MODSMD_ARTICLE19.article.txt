# Life after break
## The
						ideal vacation place — home 
### Jan Mireles 
It's trite, but true. "Some days it just
doesn't pay to get out of bed." Un
fortunately it now seems that "some quar
ters it just doesn't pay."
Midst all the flurry of activity that typifies
the first week of any quarter, spring session
offers an activity uniquely its own — that is
the opportunity to ask the all time favorite
spring question: "What did you do over
break?" Yet somehow it seems that the
perpetrator of such questions is always
tanned a deep shade of golden brown.
The cities' names may change and a few
details, but the game remains the same.
You meet in the bookstore, at Old Union
or registration. After the initial greeting
the game begins.
The tanned and suddenly curious friend,
let's call him/her, Chris, no sooner asks the
famed question than he/she immediately
begins giving you a play by play account of
how he/she rode the "big one" and would
have lasted much longer if it hadn't been
for that nasty cramp and how much fun
you missed and would you believe that
your old biology professor was seen danc
ing the hula at some luau.
Out of air, Chris pauses for breath and
suddenly realizes he/she forgot to wait for
your answer. A contrite Chris apologizes
for "running on" and rephrases the ques
tion, "Tell, how was your break and what
did you do?" You'd just as soon he/she
forgot. How do you tell someone still shak
ing the Hawaiian sand from their beach
towels or emptying their pockets of old lift
tickets that you went home?
It's not easy and avoiding the question
isn't always possible. For instance you
could try being vague. "I went north." To

which your soon to be ex-friend replies,
"Tahoe?"
"Uh, no . .
Chris presses. "Then where?"
You're caught. "Sacramento."
"I see, you went home."
So much for the elusive approach.
Once you've admitted you went home
for break the conversation takes on the
traditional dimensions. Not wanting to rub
in the fact that your vacation was probably
somewhere between lukewarm and ex
ceedingly mild, Chris politely extolls the
virtues of doing time at home. "It's much
more restful." As a colleague put it, "rest
ful is merely a euphemism for boring."
With that the conversation dies a swift, but
merciful death.
But that's not the way it should be.
Going home is nothing to be ashamed of;
it's a chance to pick up the thread of family
life and feel more like a member of your
family than a sometime visitor. For me,
going home was like the calm after a tur
bulent storm. Sacramento offered a
chance to renew family relationships.
I spent one evening with my 17-year-old
sister. She took me to dinner. We lingered
over our meal discussing our shared in
terest in journalism and arguing over our
versions of embarrassing childhood mem
ories.
I learned that she still hadn't mastered
eating spaghetti but that she knew what it
meant to be both a sister and a friend. I re
membered when I was 17 and had taken
her to dinner.
Another afternoon was earmarked for
my 10-year-old brother and 12-year-old
sister. Known as the "little kids" both have

an honest and lively approach to life. We
went to a matinee showing of "Chariots of
Fire." Roughly two hours and several can
dy bars later I was treated to a rather in
teresting review from my Sunday school
going brother, "It wasn't churchy at all. It
was excellent."
I turned 21 during spring break, so natu
rally one of the highlights had to be the an
niversary of my birth. It was a quiet day.
The kids were at school and my dad at
work. My mom and I joked around while I
watched her decorate my cake.
At our house the main event is the eve
ning meal. I had picked the menu so I
looked forward to 6 p.m. Dinner was a suc
cess and the presents were appreciated,
but the best part was sitting around after
ward and talking.
I like talking with my parents. I can
bounce ideas off them without feeling like
the smart aleck college kid come home to
enlighten her prehistoric parents. And I
like hearing what they have to say about is
sues. Neither of us voted for the same man
in the last presidential election, so con
versation can be stimulating.
Too soon the vacation ended and I
headed back to school. The blowout I had
30 miles from Stanford should have
warned me. The smoke under my
dashboard following an electrical short
should have confirmed it. I said to myself,
"It's spring quarter, it's raining and ev
eryone is back all tan and full of storiesand
asking me, 'What did you do?' " What can I
say? It's only the first day of the quarter.
I guess there's one consolation. The na
tional weather service has predicted rain
throughout the rest of this week. Those
tans will fade soon enough.
