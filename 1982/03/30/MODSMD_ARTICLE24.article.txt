# Student ad agency to join the ranks of the ASSU
## 
### Polly Grunfeld 
The ASSU will be inheriting a thriving
young business, thanks to the en
trepreneurial (and philanthropic) spirit
of two students. Wayne Cooper and A.j.
Rosenblatt have decided to hand over
their advertising brainchild, the Cam
pus Connection, to the ASSU this
spring.
The Campus Connection, a IV2 year
old student-run ad agency, is aimed at
the University market. Headed by Co
oper, president, and Margot Scherr,
vice president, and staffed by 10 other
students, the agency offers a full range
of services — from mapping out a cam
paign idea to actually distributing flyers
and posters.
Although originally designed to pro
vide advertising and distribution ser
vices for on-campus groups, the Cam
pus Connection now serves a wide
range of clients, including local
merchants and national organizations
such as Morgan Stanley and Coors. But
Cooper emphasized that all campaigns
are geared towards the University.
The agency does a lot of business with
the ASSU. Campus Connection aver

ages about 15 campaigns per week, the
majority of which are solely distribu
tion. Discounts of up to 20 percent are
given to student organizations and
groups which bank with the ASSU.
The agency is a profit-making ven
ture which netted Cooper and Rosen
blatt about $2600 each last year. This
year Cooper expects that figure to in
crease by at least 50 percent. According
to Cooper, the profit comes from the
economies of scale in their distribution
operations. The campus is divided up
into six distribution sections. One
worker takes a section each week and is
responsible for the distribution of all
posters in that section.
"I came up with the idea when I was a
sophomore," Cooper explained. "I was
the president of the Ski Club, and I saw
the need for the service. So I started it at
the beginning of my junior year with
A.]. Rosenblatt, who is studying over
seas this year. We're an advertising
agency specializing in the Stanford
market.
"I was thinking about starting an ad
vertising agency when I got out of
school. I started the company for busi

ness experience.
Cooper's responsibilities as president
of the Campus Connection include
sales and public relations, as well as op
erating and overseeing the organiza
tion. "I put in 10 to 15 hours a week to
get (the company) going. I sell the Cam
pus Connection to different groups. A
major source of business was (my) hit
ting the sidewalk and knocking on
doors."
Cooper and Rosenblatt ran intosome
bureaucratic obstacles along the way.
"There were lots of legal angles (which
made) setting up complicated. When
we'd come to a wall, we'd try to jump
over it," said Cooper. "I knew there
would be a lot of problems, but I chose
not to face them right away. I learned
how to work with people. And it really
is hard to learn how to fire friends. But,
the whole thing is a good experience
which taught me a lot."
Cooper said he learned much from
his business venture and wanted to pass
on his new found experience. Donating
Campus Connection to the ASSU
seemed a means of doing just that.

"I felt a real devotion to Stanford,"
Cooper said, "so I wanted to do some
thing for the ASSU." Cooper plans on
going to business school next year, but
wants to see the Campus Connection
continue.
The ASSU had earlier expressed in
terest in bringing in the Campus Con
nection as a part of the ASSU. Mark Eps
tein, senate finance committee chair
man, explained that the ASSU will in
corporate the Campus Connection as a
project. Epstein said he anticipates that
the ASSU will operate the agency on a
low profit margin so that, overall, the
ASSU will break even.
Working with the new Office of Pub
lic Affairs, Campus Connection is
meant to help students generate mar
keting campaigns.
"We're looking at different ways to
sell marketing and advertising to on
campus groups. What we are trying to
do is to put together packages that are
more attractive to student groups to in
tegrate them into our organization,"
explained Epstein.

made) setting up complicated. When
we'd come to a wall, we'd try to jump
over it," said Cooper. "I knew there
would be a lot of problems, but I chose
not to face them right away. I learned
how to work with people. And it really
is hard to learn how to fire friends. But,
the whole thing is a good experience
which taught me a lot."
Cooper said he learned much from
his business venture and wanted to pass
on his new found experience. Donating
Campus Connection to the ASSU
seemed a means of doing just that.

"I felt a real devotion to Stanford,"
Cooper said, "so I wanted to do some
thing for the ASSU." Cooper plans on
going to business school next year, but
wants to see the Campus Connection
continue.
The ASSU had earlier expressed in
terest in bringing in the Campus Con
nection as a part of the ASSU. Mark Eps
tein, senate finance committee chair
man, explained that the ASSU will in
corporate the Campus Connection as a
project. Epstein said he anticipates that
the ASSU will operate the agency on a
low profit margin so that, overall, the
ASSU will break even.
Working with the new Office of Pub
lic Affairs, Campus Connection is
meant to help students generate mar
keting campaigns.
"We're looking at different ways to
sell marketing and advertising to on
campus groups. What we are trying to
do is to put together packages that are
more attractive to student groups to in
tegrate them into our organization,"
explained Epstein.
The ASSU will be inheriting a thriving
young business, thanks to the en
trepreneurial (and philanthropic) spirit
of two students. Wayne Cooper and A.j.
Rosenblatt have decided to hand over
their advertising brainchild, the Cam
pus Connection, to the ASSU this
spring.
The Campus Connection, a IV2 year
old student-run ad agency, is aimed at
the University market. Headed by Co
oper, president, and Margot Scherr,
vice president, and staffed by 10 other
students, the agency offers a full range
of services — from mapping out a cam
paign idea to actually distributing flyers
and posters.
Although originally designed to pro
vide advertising and distribution ser
vices for on-campus groups, the Cam
pus Connection now serves a wide
range of clients, including local
merchants and national organizations
such as Morgan Stanley and Coors. But
Cooper emphasized that all campaigns
are geared towards the University.
The agency does a lot of business with
the ASSU. Campus Connection aver

ages about 15 campaigns per week, the
majority of which are solely distribu
tion. Discounts of up to 20 percent are
given to student organizations and
groups which bank with the ASSU.
The agency is a profit-making ven
ture which netted Cooper and Rosen
blatt about $2600 each last year. This
year Cooper expects that figure to in
crease by at least 50 percent. According
to Cooper, the profit comes from the
economies of scale in their distribution
operations. The campus is divided up
into six distribution sections. One
worker takes a section each week and is
responsible for the distribution of all
posters in that section.
"I came up with the idea when I was a
sophomore," Cooper explained. "I was
the president of the Ski Club, and I saw
the need for the service. So I started it at
the beginning of my junior year with
A.]. Rosenblatt, who is studying over
seas this year. We're an advertising
agency specializing in the Stanford
market.
"I was thinking about starting an ad
vertising agency when I got out of
school. I started the company for busi

ness experience.
Cooper's responsibilities as president
of the Campus Connection include
sales and public relations, as well as op
erating and overseeing the organiza
tion. "I put in 10 to 15 hours a week to
get (the company) going. I sell the Cam
pus Connection to different groups. A
major source of business was (my) hit
ting the sidewalk and knocking on
doors."
Cooper and Rosenblatt ran intosome
bureaucratic obstacles along the way.
"There were lots of legal angles (which
made) setting up complicated. When
we'd come to a wall, we'd try to jump
over it," said Cooper. "I knew there
would be a lot of problems, but I chose
not to face them right away. I learned
how to work with people. And it really
is hard to learn how to fire friends. But,
the whole thing is a good experience
which taught me a lot."
