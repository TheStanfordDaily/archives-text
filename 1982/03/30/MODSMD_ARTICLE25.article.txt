# Wife abuse: fighting the man one loves

"Why do people find it hard to believe that there are
professors and students at Stanford who beat their
wives?" asked the director of a local support group
which handles 65 wife-abuse cases a month.
"There are so many myths about wife-beating —
people think it occurs in the ghettos, that the nice
man they know wouldn't hurt a fly, let alone beat his
wife," said Ann Wurr, director of the Mid-Peninsula
Support Network.
Wife abuse is common, so common that the FBI es
timates it occurs every 18 seconds in the United States.

beaten every year is 3 to 4 million. It is also one of the
most under-reported crimes.
"Most women are very protective of their husbands
and boyfriends and it is difficult to get them to make a
statement," said Marvin Herrington, Stanford police
chief. According to Herrington, there are 10 to 15 re
ported cases of wife-beating every year on the Uni
versity campus.
"Most of them occur in Escondido Village, and
cases of wife-beating in the home-owners area is

low," Herrington said.
Domestic violence is a serious crime. The National
Commission on Causes and Prevention of Violence
reported that husbands and wives kill each other with
equal frequency, but that wives are seven times more
likely than husbands to kill in self-defense.
"Most of the women are abused in their homes,
and not in unfamiliar surroundings as one might
think," Herrington said. According to Herrington,
domestic disturbance calls are the most dangerous
calls to which police officers must respond.
Either party could be armed, and could turn on the
officers. "There have been times when we have had
to break into homes to make sure no one is being
harmed," said Herrington.
In 1980 California law changed to make knowing
and willful violation of a domestic violence restrain
ing order a specific misdemeanor (Penal Code Sec
tion 273.6). This gives the police and district attorneys
a more effective tool without having to wait to view
the abuse. State law requires that these restraining or
ders be kept on file by police so that officers who re
spond to domestic violence calls can ascertain that an
order is in effect, and what the terms of the order are.
"Often victims are not told they have a right to get a
police report made and that a citizen's arrest is pos
sible," said Wurr.

One of the main hurdles, according to Herrington,
is dealing with women who are protective of their bat
terers.
"We once had a warrant for the arrest of a man who
used to beat his wife — there was enough other evi
dence we had, besides wife beating, on which he
could have been arrested, yet his wife pleaded with
me not to arrest him," he said. "What can the police
officer do in such a situation?"
According to Herrington, there is a pattern to the
way women behave. In nine out of 10 cases, he said
they change their minds when they are asked to testi
fy in court.
"We are aware that police officers, sometimes out
of frustration, can get impatient with victims, but that
does not mean we are callous," Herrington said, reac
ting to the criticism that police officers are often indif
ferent.
On the other hand, Herrington said, the police
have worked out a way whereby they can arrest the
batterer even if the woman does not make a
statement. "Since beating almost always occurs after
alcohol consumption, we try to get the man to come
out on the sidewalk and then we can arrest him on
other charges," he said.
