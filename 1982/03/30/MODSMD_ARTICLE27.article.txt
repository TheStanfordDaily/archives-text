## 'Personal Best': the unembarrassed camera view Personal Best 
### Steve Vineberg 
In the most interesting recent mov
ies, filmmakers are making an attempt
tofind newrhythms, newwaysofdefin
ing character and relationships — and
thus unusual ways of using actors. A
friend who shared my love of Shoot the
Moon suggested that the reason it has
had a lukewarm reception among au
diences as well as critics is that it refuses
to operate like a glorified television
drama such as Ordinary People: it
doesn't pause at carefully pre-pro
grammed key moments so that you can
click in and respond as expected. When
you watch Shoot the Moon, you have to
do more work than movies usually ask
of you, because neither the dialogue
nor the camera reveals everything
about the characters in the first five
minutes, or even the first hour; you
grow to understand what has torn this
home apart — and what created it in the
first place —slowly. The movie doesn't
violate the mystery of intimacy; in real
life, people just don't open themselves
to our scrutiny the way Mary Tyler
Moore does in the opening scenes of
Ordinary People.
I don't know how audiences will
react to Personal Best, a new film about
the coming of age of a rising pen
tatjilete, Chris Cahill (Mariel Heming
way), because it's daring and uncon
ventional; I don't think I've ever seen
another movie quite like it. And yet the
approach Robert Towne, who wrote,
directed and produced it, has taken to
the material is so logical that when I'd

left the theater I couldn't imagine any
other way he could have achieved his
results. Personal Best is conceived en
tirely in terms °112 body language.
Dialogue is only important for narrative
purposes and in order to complement
the action; Towne is not interested in
what the characters say to each other,
but in what their legs and torsos and
shoulders say, and — particularly since
he is dealing with athletes — we are
continually astonished at how eloquent
the bodies are.
Moments before Tory Skinner (Pa
trice Donnelly), the older and more ex
perienced Olympic candidate who be
friends Chris at the Hayward Field
tryouts, actually makes a pass at Chris,
we know that a sexual relationship be
tween these two young women is immi
nent because of the balance of tension
and relaxation in their juxtaposed
forms. The way in which Chris leans
toward a man at a party infuriates Tory,
because she understands — as we do —
that she is flirting with him, and when
she rests her elbow on the shoulder of
their trainer, Terry Tingloff (Scott
Glenn), we wonder along with Tory if
their relationship has exceeded the
purely professional.
The physical details delineate the dif
ferences between the women — Don
nelly's taut Indian face is a striking con
trast to Hemingway's wider, freer one,
and when they arm wrestle, we see two
kinds of concentration — and some
times they provide fresh, surprising
comic moments. Towne trains the cam
era on the struggle of the two women to

jog up a sand dune, and then he cuts to
Tingloff, lying on top of the dune,
drinking beer and commanding them
to repeat the exercise. After the fierce
strain of those legs combatting the
sand, Tingloff's position is so relaxed —
his legs are bent and the arm that mo
tions his charges to start over hangs
loose — that we have to laugh.
With almost no dialogue that you re
member afterwards, Personal Best says
a great deal more about athletes and
sport than the endlessly chattering
Chariots of Fire, in which, for all that
movie's whipped-up anxiety about the
outcome of a pair of races, the camera
was kept perversely in front of the
runners so that you couldn't tell who
was winning. Personal Best isn't con
cerned with winning; it's about the ex
penditure of physical and emotional
energy, and about the search for a deli
cate balance between friendship and
competitive drive; and yet Towne
doesn't sacrifice the excitement of the
greatly satisfying final race.
Towne's treatment of the bodies
of the competing women strikes its own
weird sort of balance. In motion —
there are exquisite montages of hurdl
ing and high jumping and shotputting
that take you right back to Leni
Riefenstahl's Olympiad and then sur
pass it — the bodies are extraordinarily
beautiful; Hemingway and Donnelly
look so great when they run together
that their physical relationship seems a
natural extension of their professional
friendship. (The photographer,
Michael Chapman, usesa pallettefamil

iar to those who have seen the paintings
of the English artist David Hockney — a
sensuous array of pastels — but the clar
ity of the bodies against what is some
times a hazy, dream-like background is
overpowering, as in hyperrealist art.)
But Towne somehow avoids adulation
(and exploitation). All the physical con
nections in Personal Best, including the
sexual ones, are gloriously free of self
consciousness; no one in the theater
giggles when Chris and Tory lie in bed
together the way an entire audience did
the night I saw Making Love, during
that painful first kiss between Michael
Ontkean and Harry Hamlin. Later,
when we see Chris in bed with the man
she grows to love, Denny Stites (Kenny
Moore), we can enjoy the sweetness
and good humor of their intimacy in a
way usually denied us in love scenes in
the movies, because Towne doesn't try
to use this encounter to score points for
or against any of the characters. (We're
not meant to compare this scene to the
Chris-Tory love scenes.)
This is Towne's directorial debut;
what is even more amazing is that his
background is entirely in screenwriting
— in fact, after writing The Last Detail
and Chinatown and Shampoo in the
early '70s he had pretty well estab
lished himself as Hollywood's premier
writer. He gives Scott Glenn one
hilarious diatribe about the difficulty of
managing women athletes (it reminded
me of the old George Kaufman sketch
"If Men Played Cards Like Women Do,"

but in the context of Tingloff's
obvious respect for the women
he coaches, it's not offensive in
the least), as if to remind us that
he hasn't forgotten how to
write first-rate dialogue, but all
through Personal Best he wears
a brand-new suit — one,
moreover, that doesn't re
semble at all whatanybodyelse
is wearing.
I'm not sure whether I am
more impressed by the visual
conception and working out of
the film or by the way in which
he has used his cast. As far as I
know, Mariel Hemingway and
Scott Glenn are the only pro

fessional actors in the movie;
Patrice Donnelly, Kenny
Moore, Jodi Anderson (who
plays the other major Olympic
candidate, Pooch) and the oth
ers are all athletes who have
never been in a movie before.
Obviously Towne must be
credited with the absolutely
consistent, naturalistic per
formances of the non-actors,
but since Hemingway and
Glenn also give unaffected, un
actorish performances, the ef
fect is of a director's having
toned down the pros rather
than toning up the amateurs.
To be fair, one must add that
Hemingway and Glenn (she
was the kid sister in Lipstick and
Woody Allen's teenage in
amorata in Manhattan; he was

the shy soldier in Nashville and
the bully in Urban Cowboy) are
among the most convincing
featured players in the last few
years of American movies. Of
all the acting in Personal Best,
Scott Glenn's illustrates the
greatest depth, but neither
Mariel Hemingway nor Patrice
Donnelly has a false moment
that I could spot. The authen
ticity of the performances, of
course, is part of Towne's ap
proach. Watching Personal
Best is like being invited to ob
serve the most private mo
ments of a young woman's rites
of passage — and then dis
covering that you don't have to
feel embarrassed at being
there. Robert Towne may have
invented a new kind of elation

invented a new kind of elation
In the most interesting recent mov
ies, filmmakers are making an attempt
tofind newrhythms, newwaysofdefin
ing character and relationships — and
thus unusual ways of using actors. A
friend who shared my love of Shoot the
Moon suggested that the reason it has
had a lukewarm reception among au
diences as well as critics is that it refuses
to operate like a glorified television
drama such as Ordinary People: it
doesn't pause at carefully pre-pro
grammed key moments so that you can
click in and respond as expected. When
you watch Shoot the Moon, you have to
do more work than movies usually ask
of you, because neither the dialogue
nor the camera reveals everything
about the characters in the first five
minutes, or even the first hour; you
grow to understand what has torn this
home apart — and what created it in the
first place —slowly. The movie doesn't
violate the mystery of intimacy; in real
life, people just don't open themselves
to our scrutiny the way Mary Tyler
Moore does in the opening scenes of
Ordinary People.
I don't know how audiences will
react to Personal Best, a new film about
the coming of age of a rising pen
tatjilete, Chris Cahill (Mariel Heming
way), because it's daring and uncon
ventional; I don't think I've ever seen
another movie quite like it. And yet the
approach Robert Towne, who wrote,
directed and produced it, has taken to
the material is so logical that when I'd

left the theater I couldn't imagine any
other way he could have achieved his
results. Personal Best is conceived en
tirely in terms °112 body language.
Dialogue is only important for narrative
purposes and in order to complement
the action; Towne is not interested in
what the characters say to each other,
but in what their legs and torsos and
shoulders say, and — particularly since
he is dealing with athletes — we are
continually astonished at how eloquent
the bodies are.
Moments before Tory Skinner (Pa
trice Donnelly), the older and more ex
perienced Olympic candidate who be
friends Chris at the Hayward Field
tryouts, actually makes a pass at Chris,
we know that a sexual relationship be
tween these two young women is immi
nent because of the balance of tension
and relaxation in their juxtaposed
forms. The way in which Chris leans
toward a man at a party infuriates Tory,
because she understands — as we do —
that she is flirting with him, and when
she rests her elbow on the shoulder of
their trainer, Terry Tingloff (Scott
Glenn), we wonder along with Tory if
their relationship has exceeded the
purely professional.
The physical details delineate the dif
ferences between the women — Don
nelly's taut Indian face is a striking con
trast to Hemingway's wider, freer one,
and when they arm wrestle, we see two
kinds of concentration — and some
times they provide fresh, surprising
comic moments. Towne trains the cam
era on the struggle of the two women to

jog up a sand dune, and then he cuts to
Tingloff, lying on top of the dune,
drinking beer and commanding them
to repeat the exercise. After the fierce
strain of those legs combatting the
sand, Tingloff's position is so relaxed —
his legs are bent and the arm that mo
tions his charges to start over hangs
loose — that we have to laugh.
With almost no dialogue that you re
member afterwards, Personal Best says
a great deal more about athletes and
sport than the endlessly chattering
Chariots of Fire, in which, for all that
movie's whipped-up anxiety about the
outcome of a pair of races, the camera
was kept perversely in front of the
runners so that you couldn't tell who
was winning. Personal Best isn't con
cerned with winning; it's about the ex
penditure of physical and emotional
energy, and about the search for a deli
cate balance between friendship and
competitive drive; and yet Towne
doesn't sacrifice the excitement of the
greatly satisfying final race.
Towne's treatment of the bodies
of the competing women strikes its own
weird sort of balance. In motion —
there are exquisite montages of hurdl
ing and high jumping and shotputting
that take you right back to Leni
Riefenstahl's Olympiad and then sur
pass it — the bodies are extraordinarily
beautiful; Hemingway and Donnelly
look so great when they run together
that their physical relationship seems a
natural extension of their professional
friendship. (The photographer,
Michael Chapman, usesa pallettefamil

iar to those who have seen the paintings
of the English artist David Hockney — a
sensuous array of pastels — but the clar
ity of the bodies against what is some
times a hazy, dream-like background is
overpowering, as in hyperrealist art.)
But Towne somehow avoids adulation
(and exploitation). All the physical con
nections in Personal Best, including the
sexual ones, are gloriously free of self
consciousness; no one in the theater
giggles when Chris and Tory lie in bed
together the way an entire audience did
the night I saw Making Love, during
that painful first kiss between Michael
Ontkean and Harry Hamlin. Later,
when we see Chris in bed with the man
she grows to love, Denny Stites (Kenny
Moore), we can enjoy the sweetness
and good humor of their intimacy in a
way usually denied us in love scenes in
the movies, because Towne doesn't try
to use this encounter to score points for
or against any of the characters. (We're
not meant to compare this scene to the
Chris-Tory love scenes.)
This is Towne's directorial debut;
what is even more amazing is that his
background is entirely in screenwriting
— in fact, after writing The Last Detail
and Chinatown and Shampoo in the
early '70s he had pretty well estab
lished himself as Hollywood's premier
writer. He gives Scott Glenn one
hilarious diatribe about the difficulty of
managing women athletes (it reminded
me of the old George Kaufman sketch
"If Men Played Cards Like Women Do,"

but in the context of Tingloff's
obvious respect for the women
he coaches, it's not offensive in
the least), as if to remind us that
he hasn't forgotten how to
write first-rate dialogue, but all
through Personal Best he wears
a brand-new suit — one,
moreover, that doesn't re
semble at all whatanybodyelse
is wearing.
I'm not sure whether I am
more impressed by the visual
conception and working out of
the film or by the way in which
he has used his cast. As far as I
know, Mariel Hemingway and
Scott Glenn are the only pro

fessional actors in the movie;
Patrice Donnelly, Kenny
Moore, Jodi Anderson (who
plays the other major Olympic
candidate, Pooch) and the oth
ers are all athletes who have
never been in a movie before.
Obviously Towne must be
credited with the absolutely
consistent, naturalistic per
formances of the non-actors,
but since Hemingway and
Glenn also give unaffected, un
actorish performances, the ef
fect is of a director's having
toned down the pros rather
than toning up the amateurs.
To be fair, one must add that
Hemingway and Glenn (she
was the kid sister in Lipstick and
Woody Allen's teenage in
amorata in Manhattan; he was

the shy soldier in Nashville and
the bully in Urban Cowboy) are
among the most convincing
featured players in the last few
years of American movies. Of
all the acting in Personal Best,
Scott Glenn's illustrates the
greatest depth, but neither
Mariel Hemingway nor Patrice
Donnelly has a false moment
that I could spot. The authen
ticity of the performances, of
course, is part of Towne's ap
proach. Watching Personal
Best is like being invited to ob
serve the most private mo
ments of a young woman's rites
of passage — and then dis

invented a new kind of elation
In the most interesting recent mov
ies, filmmakers are making an attempt
tofind newrhythms, newwaysofdefin
ing character and relationships — and
thus unusual ways of using actors. A
friend who shared my love of Shoot the
Moon suggested that the reason it has
had a lukewarm reception among au
diences as well as critics is that it refuses
to operate like a glorified television
drama such as Ordinary People: it
doesn't pause at carefully pre-pro
grammed key moments so that you can
click in and respond as expected. When
you watch Shoot the Moon, you have to
do more work than movies usually ask
of you, because neither the dialogue
nor the camera reveals everything
about the characters in the first five
minutes, or even the first hour; you
grow to understand what has torn this
home apart — and what created it in the
first place —slowly. The movie doesn't
violate the mystery of intimacy; in real
life, people just don't open themselves
to our scrutiny the way Mary Tyler
Moore does in the opening scenes of
Ordinary People.
I don't know how audiences will
react to Personal Best, a new film about
the coming of age of a rising pen
tatjilete, Chris Cahill (Mariel Heming
way), because it's daring and uncon
ventional; I don't think I've ever seen
another movie quite like it. And yet the
approach Robert Towne, who wrote,
directed and produced it, has taken to
the material is so logical that when I'd

left the theater I couldn't imagine any
other way he could have achieved his
results. Personal Best is conceived en
tirely in terms °112 body language.
Dialogue is only important for narrative
purposes and in order to complement
the action; Towne is not interested in
what the characters say to each other,
but in what their legs and torsos and
shoulders say, and — particularly since
he is dealing with athletes — we are
continually astonished at how eloquent
the bodies are.
Moments before Tory Skinner (Pa
trice Donnelly), the older and more ex
perienced Olympic candidate who be
friends Chris at the Hayward Field
tryouts, actually makes a pass at Chris,
we know that a sexual relationship be
tween these two young women is immi
nent because of the balance of tension
and relaxation in their juxtaposed
forms. The way in which Chris leans
toward a man at a party infuriates Tory,
because she understands — as we do —
that she is flirting with him, and when
she rests her elbow on the shoulder of
their trainer, Terry Tingloff (Scott
Glenn), we wonder along with Tory if
their relationship has exceeded the
purely professional.
The physical details delineate the dif
ferences between the women — Don
nelly's taut Indian face is a striking con
trast to Hemingway's wider, freer one,
and when they arm wrestle, we see two
kinds of concentration — and some
times they provide fresh, surprising
comic moments. Towne trains the cam
era on the struggle of the two women to

jog up a sand dune, and then he cuts to
Tingloff, lying on top of the dune,
drinking beer and commanding them
to repeat the exercise. After the fierce
strain of those legs combatting the
sand, Tingloff's position is so relaxed —
his legs are bent and the arm that mo
tions his charges to start over hangs
loose — that we have to laugh.
With almost no dialogue that you re
member afterwards, Personal Best says
a great deal more about athletes and
sport than the endlessly chattering
Chariots of Fire, in which, for all that
movie's whipped-up anxiety about the
outcome of a pair of races, the camera
was kept perversely in front of the
runners so that you couldn't tell who
was winning. Personal Best isn't con
cerned with winning; it's about the ex
penditure of physical and emotional
energy, and about the search for a deli
cate balance between friendship and
competitive drive; and yet Towne
doesn't sacrifice the excitement of the
greatly satisfying final race.
Towne's treatment of the bodies
of the competing women strikes its own
weird sort of balance. In motion —
there are exquisite montages of hurdl
ing and high jumping and shotputting
that take you right back to Leni
Riefenstahl's Olympiad and then sur
pass it — the bodies are extraordinarily
beautiful; Hemingway and Donnelly
look so great when they run together
that their physical relationship seems a
natural extension of their professional
friendship. (The photographer,
Michael Chapman, usesa pallettefamil

iar to those who have seen the paintings
of the English artist David Hockney — a
sensuous array of pastels — but the clar
ity of the bodies against what is some
times a hazy, dream-like background is
overpowering, as in hyperrealist art.)
But Towne somehow avoids adulation
(and exploitation). All the physical con
nections in Personal Best, including the
sexual ones, are gloriously free of self
consciousness; no one in the theater
giggles when Chris and Tory lie in bed
together the way an entire audience did
the night I saw Making Love, during
that painful first kiss between Michael
Ontkean and Harry Hamlin. Later,
when we see Chris in bed with the man
she grows to love, Denny Stites (Kenny
Moore), we can enjoy the sweetness
and good humor of their intimacy in a
way usually denied us in love scenes in
the movies, because Towne doesn't try
to use this encounter to score points for
or against any of the characters. (We're
not meant to compare this scene to the
Chris-Tory love scenes.)
This is Towne's directorial debut;
what is even more amazing is that his
background is entirely in screenwriting
— in fact, after writing The Last Detail
and Chinatown and Shampoo in the
early '70s he had pretty well estab
lished himself as Hollywood's premier
writer. He gives Scott Glenn one
hilarious diatribe about the difficulty of
managing women athletes (it reminded
me of the old George Kaufman sketch
"If Men Played Cards Like Women Do,"

but in the context of Tingloff's
obvious respect for the women
he coaches, it's not offensive in
the least), as if to remind us that
he hasn't forgotten how to
write first-rate dialogue, but all
through Personal Best he wears
a brand-new suit — one,
moreover, that doesn't re
semble at all whatanybodyelse
is wearing.
I'm not sure whether I am
more impressed by the visual
conception and working out of
the film or by the way in which
he has used his cast. As far as I
know, Mariel Hemingway and
Scott Glenn are the only pro

fessional actors in the movie;
Patrice Donnelly, Kenny
Moore, Jodi Anderson (who
plays the other major Olympic
candidate, Pooch) and the oth
ers are all athletes who have
never been in a movie before.
Obviously Towne must be
credited with the absolutely
consistent, naturalistic per
formances of the non-actors,
but since Hemingway and
Glenn also give unaffected, un
actorish performances, the ef
fect is of a director's having
toned down the pros rather
than toning up the amateurs.
To be fair, one must add that
Hemingway and Glenn (she
was the kid sister in Lipstick and
Woody Allen's teenage in
amorata in Manhattan; he was

the shy soldier in Nashville and
the bully in Urban Cowboy) are
among the most convincing
featured players in the last few
years of American movies. Of
all the acting in Personal Best,
Scott Glenn's illustrates the
greatest depth, but neither
Mariel Hemingway nor Patrice
Donnelly has a false moment
that I could spot. The authen
ticity of the performances, of
course, is part of Towne's ap
proach. Watching Personal
Best is like being invited to ob
serve the most private mo
ments of a young woman's rites
of passage — and then dis
covering that you don't have to
feel embarrassed at being
there. Robert Towne may have
invented a new kind of elation
