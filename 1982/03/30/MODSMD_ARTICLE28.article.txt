The Renard nf Flight
Victoria Theatre/San Fiancisco

Simultaneously tickling your funnybone
and tugging at your heartstrings, The Re
gard of Flight, Bill Irwin's new comedy now
playing in San Francisco, deftly draws upon
various sources — vaudeville, theater of
the absurd, the silent-movie tradition of
Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin — to
pay humorous homage to Murphy's Law
("If something can go wrong, it will") with
its own special brand of whimsy.
With help from two fellow actors, Bill
Irwin has proved once again that old theat
rical truth — that with little more than a
top-hat and cane, a steamer trunk full of
props, and an old upright piano —pro-
vided they are animated by a lively im
agination, a limber body, and a warm heart
— you can conjure up an entire world of
laughter. The Regard of Flight is a
vaudeville bandwagon that now and again
hits a pothole, but for the most part rolls
merrily along on a road of innocent de
light. The show's title conveys it's spirit:
daffy, quizzical, slightly askew with sur
realism and full of surprises.
The premise of the show is that Irwin is
trying to perform his one-man vaudeville
act, but he can't get on with the show be
cause he runs smack into one snafu after
another. He loses ono of his <hoes, he's as
saulted by inopportune spotlights, the cur
tain keeps coming down at the wrong
time. But the Really Major Snafus are 1) a
dense-brained pianist-accompanist who
seems to live in another world, 2) a mem
ber of the audience who leaps onstage and

demands to know what the hell Irwin is
trying to prove, and 3) the invisible and
nightmarish Forces of Disruption.
The pianist plays vamps that get stuck
like a needle in a broken record. He also
doubles as a stage-manager, broadcasting
untimely orders over the P.A. system
("Warning! Curtain coming down! Places
for the second dance number!"). The in
trusive audience-member harries Irwin
with critical comments and physical as
sault, and the Forces of Disruption deploy
a huge, invisible, man-eating vacuum
cleaner.
The success of The Regard of Flight is
largely due to the good feelings inspired
by the presence of Bill Irwin, who is a
gentle clown, a breezy dancer, and a natu
ral, unaffected actor. He is goofy in a subtle
way, and he pays his audience the compli
ment of trusting them to catch onto his hu
mor without having to be hit over the
head. Above all, he has an unforced, warm
manner that makes firm contact with the
audience. When, in his harried dashings
through the audience, he happened to
bump my knee, his hasty "Excuse me" was
genuinely spoken to me, not acted.
There's nothing phony orself-disguising in
his presence. He shows an honest desire to
please and entertain, and doesn't offer any
wooden nickels.
A few of Irwin's comic bits seem over-fa
miliar, like the struggle to put on a vest, or
the segment where he can't get through an
audition piece because the director keeps
interrupting him. But the familiar bits are
far outnumbered by the fresh-as-a-daisy
surprises, like the "pause for free associa

tion," the running translation into French,
or the vignette in which Irwin, stretched
out to go to sleep, tries over and over again
to simply rest his head on the pillow (in
somniacs will sympathize). It's too bad that
Irwin's whirling-dervish dancing is not a
larger part of the show, because lurking in
that silly-putty body, in those pretzelly
knees and floppy hands, are genuine
power and grace.
Thumping away on the upright piano is
Doug Skinner, who also composed the
colorful, jaunty music-hall tunes. In addi
tion, his deadpan, professorial commen
tary at the lectern on "The Nature of the
Drama" struck just the right, low-keyed
note, and he also does a turn as a ventrilo
quist.
Michael O'Connor, in the role of the
belligerent member of the audience — the
quintessential Intruder — is appropriately
beady-eyed and pugnacious. He takes on
various abrasive personalities (a prose
cuting attorney, an overbearing director,
an insinuating critic) with gusto and clarity.
My only real complaint about The Re
gard of Flight is that it's too short (1 Va
hours). The show has no intermission and
it ends disappointingly soon, in a way that
seems cut-off rather than concluded.
But The Regard of Flight is a diverting
evening of warmth and wackiness. Under
neath it all, Bill Irwin's clown represents all
of us: creatures who face an arbitrary, odd,
capricious, and fleeting world — a real
world that seems sometimes like a bad
dream — who struggle to assert ourselves,
to make our personal little dent in the Cos
mic indifference.
