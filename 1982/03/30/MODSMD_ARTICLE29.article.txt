# Joyful Christie cocktail party
## Evil Under the Sun 
### Steve Vineberg 
Evil Under the Sun is by
far the most buoyant and
enjoyable of the Agatha
Christie movies. Guy Hamil
ton, the director, doesn't
have much style, but the
script by Anthony Shaffer
(who wrote Sleuth as well as
the lumpy film version of
Death on the Nile) is full of
bons mots, and the cast is
mostly delightful.
Even the cleverest Christ
ie mysteries pose insur
mountable problems to a
filmmaker because they are
inherently undramatic:
once the murder has taken
place, the characters have
nothing to do but sit around
and wait while the sleuth
solves the crime. The
smartest plan, of course, is
to make the suspects such
glittering personalities that
we are pleasantly diverted
while the murderer is being
unearthed. It's the cocktail
party school of filmmaking,
but it works well in Evil Un
der the Sun.
Peter Ustinov plays
Hercule Poirot, the Belgian
detective, as he did in Death
on the Nile. With his sparse
hair curled and his

moustache twirled at the
ends, swathed in some of
costumer Anthony Powell's
wittiest creations (in one
scene: a bathrobe with
elephants and tigers printed
on it, a black bathing outfit
that suggests a perversion of
something Japanese, and a
cap that looks like a failed
orange souffle), Ustinov is
fussy and self-amused — a
parody of a continental fop.
He is hilarious, especially in
his scenes with Maggie
Smith, who sports a curly
red mop for her role as
Daphne Castle, the pro
prietress of the hotel on the
Adriatic where the film
takes place.
The scenes between the
two are the high points of
the picture; Daphne is anx
ious for Poirot to solve the
murder of one of her guests
(a stage star, played by
Diana Rigg) as quickly and
as quietly as possible, so that
her establishment won't suf
fer the effects of bad public
ity, and she tries valiantly to
assist him with several pet
theories of her own, each
more fatuous than the last.
Her undisguised pleasure at
the gory details of the
stories she concocts as pos
sible replays of the crime

and her ire at Poirot's finicky
dissatisfaction with the ho
tel service furnish the comic
edge for their encounters.
Smith, whose readings are
effortlessly deft, also gets to
thrust and parry with Diana
Rigg; their verbal jousts are
sweetly bitchy. It's a pity that
Shaffer and Hamilton liqui
date Rigg so quickly.
Also in attendance are
Colin Blakeley (who sports a
Hitler moustache and does
funny things with his nose
and eyes) as a Scottish lord,
and James Mason and Sylvia
Miles as a husband-and
wife producing team. Miles
is hopeless at comedy of
manners, and Powell's ef
forts to make her look like a
man in drag don't help, be
cause she's more obtrusiuve
that way and no more amus
ing. She wears a wig in one
scene that suggests a
burlesque version of Jean
Harlow in Dinner at Eight;
she even makes a stab at
Harlow's ridiculous
aristocratic accent; but Ma
son is so skilful that he can
make her look bad without
opening his mouth. He
hardly gets to open it at all
during this movie, though
he is given one terrific
speech about alibis.
