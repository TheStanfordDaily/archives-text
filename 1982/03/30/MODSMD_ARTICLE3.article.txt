No majority for Salvadoran parties
San Salvador, El Salvador — The centrist Christian Democrats and
their extreme-right challengers, both falling short of a majority in El
Salvador's election, scrambled for coalition partners yesterday to gov
ern the war-weary country.
As returns continued to trickle in yesterday, the major parties' shares
of the vote held steady. The Christian Democrats of Jose Napoleon
Duarte, president of the current U.S.-backed military-civilian junta, had
40 percent of the nationwide tally, and the ultra-rightist Republican Na
tionalist Alliance (ARENA) of former army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson
had 30 percent.
Each of the two parties predicted it would form a majority coalition
with one or more of the smaller conservative groups in the 60-member
assembly, which is to name an interim government and write a new con
stitution leading to general elections, probably next year.
The Reagan administration, meanwhile, sent a new signal on nego
tiations to end the civil war.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said in Washington the constituent
assembly elected here Sunday should "hold out the hand of concilia
tion" to leftist guerrillas who are ready to join in the democratic process
in this Central American nation.
There were no immediate official reports on the voter turnout, but
Salvadorans said it was the largest in recent memory.
The White House, noting the apparently large voter turnout, hailed
the election as a "victory for the people" and a defeat for the guerrillas,
who had sought futilely to disrupt the balloting
The left had boycotted the election, saying its
candidates would have been risking assassina
tion by El Salvador's right-wing "death squads."
With 500 of 4 600 polling stations reporting,
the Central Election Commission gave the fol
lowing count: Christian Democrats, 79,680
votes, 40.1 percent; ARENA, 58,646 votes, 29.5
percent; National Conciliation Party, 32,190
votes, 16.2 percent; Democratic Action Party,
18,828 votes, 9.4 percent; Popular Salvadoran
Party, 6 597 votes, 3.3 percent, and Popular Ori
entation Party, 2 605 votes, 1.3 percent.
Shuttle landing stalled
White Sands Missile Range, N.M. — Wind
whipped dust and drifting sands turned away
the space shuttle Columbia from this desert site
less than an hour before it was supposed to
swoop down here yesterday morning.
Space agency officials commanded the craft
to remain aloft another day and began to con
template shifting the landing site to a new run
way at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
Officials said that the space plane, carrying
astronauts Jack Lousma and C. Gordon Full
erton, would definitely be brought down today,
either at this Army base in the southeastern cor
ner of New Mexico or at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral.
A National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration spokesman said the "possibilities are
high" that the landing would take place in Flori
da because the weather there was expected to
be better.
Today's forecast for White Sands called for
winds as strong or stronger than those that
kicked up a dust haze several hundred feet
above the basin floor.
The 35-mph winds blew so much sand across
thex-shaped runways of the so-called Northrup
Strip where the Columbia was to touchdown
that the black centerline was covered over.
It was the first time a spacecraft landing had
been delayed because of weather. The shuttle,
which does not have power in its glide to earth,
is more sensitive to weather conditions than
conventional aircraft. The space capsules of
earlier missions were directed away from bad
weather for ocean landings.
Chariots of Fire best picture
Hollywood — Henry Fonda and Katharine
Hepburn won Oscars for their co-starring roles
as husband and wife in On Golden Pond at the
54th Academy Awards last night, and Chariots
of Fire was named best picture.
For the 76-year-old Fonda, it was his first Os
car for acting. It was the 72-year-old Miss Hep
burn's fourth — a record number for acting in a
leading role.
Chariots, a British film that won critical ac
claim, had not been considered among top
contenders for best picture of 1981. It told the
story of two runners — one a jew from Oxford,
the other a Scottish missionary — competing in
the Olympic Games of 1924.
Fonda, who played octogenarian Norman
Thayer in On Golden Pond, burst into tears
when his award was announced on television
Monday night, his wife said.
"He just burst into tears. He's so emotional,"
said his wife Shirlee Fonda outside the couple's
Bel-Air home following the conclusion of the
54th Annual Academy Awards presentation.
"I am so happy and proud," the 76-year-old
actor enthused when he learned he had re
ceived his first acting Oscar, Mrs. Fonda said.
Fonda, who has been confined for months to
his home with heart and other physical prob
lems, watched the awards on television and was

particularly pleased when the best actress Oscar
award went to his co-star Katharine Hepburn.
"He just beamed. He said, 'I told you so,' "
Mrs. Fonda said.
jane Fonda accepted the Oscar on behalf of
her father and was to bring it to his house after
the awards program.
Israelis disrupt Nablus rally
Televiv, Israel — Israeli troops used tear gas to
break up a Palestinian demonstration in Nablus
and an Israeli settler fired his pistol to escape a
road ambush in the occupied West Bank yester
day, the military command reported.
It was the 11th straight day of clashes in a wave
of troubles in the occupied Arab territories in
which five Arabs have been killed by Israeli
gunfire.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment, which said Sunday it would not tolerate
violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
meanwhile was bracing for trouble among Is
rael's Arab citizens today, the sixth anniversary
of clashes that killed six Israeli Arabs.
Many of Israel's Arab villages, where one
sixth of the population lives, will beonstriketo
day and three marches are scheduled to com
memorate those killed in 1976 and also to pro
test government policy in the West Bank.
The link between West Bank and Israeli Arab
issues sparked concern in Israel, where the Jew
ish majority hopes the Arab citizenry will re
main loyal.
The military command said five West Bank vil
lages and refugee camps were under total
curfew, including the village of Khadr, where
an Israeli settler was ambushed by a hail of
stones and burning tires were rolled at his car at
an improvised road barricade.
The Israeli, who is the treasurer at the nearby
settlement Gush Etzion, drew his pistol and
fired to drive off the rioters, the command said.
Blood was found on the ground, indicating
that one of the Palestinian youths might have
been wounded, but no gunshot wound was re
ported in hospitals, the command said.
The settler's car was destroyed, and the vil
lage of Khadr, five miles south of Jerusalem, was
put under curfew.
The command said curfews also were im
posed on the towns of Halhoul, Sair and Jaabed,
where three Palestinians were wounded Sun
day in anti-Israel riots, and on the refugee camp
at Jenin in the northern West Bank.
Haig hails voter turnout
Washington — The Reagan administration,
with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in the
forefront, yesterday hailed the high voter turn
out in El Salvador's elections as a defeat for the
guerrillas and hinted at new moves to entice the
insurgents "to take part peacefully in the demo
cratic process."
Although the outcome of the balloting for a
constituent assembly was still unclear, Haig
took the unusual step of appearing at the State
Department's daily press briefing to read a
statement calling the turnout "an unmistakable
repudiation of the advocates of force and vio
lence."
He said that for the guerrillas, who had
sought to make the elections virtually im
possible to carry out, the results were "a military
defeat quite as much as a political repudiation.
Despite their clear intention to disrupt the elec
tions, the guerrillas were unable to shake either
the people or the security forces at their mo
ment of greatest vulnerability."
While other U.S. officials said it was too early
to predict what kind of interim government is
likely to emerge from the elections, Haig hinted

that the administration believes U.S. persuasion
and pressure will lead to formation of a coali
tion pledged to continue U.S.-supported poli
cies of internal reform and resistance to leftist
attempts to win power by force.
He said, "We are confident that the consti
tuent assembly, given the extraordinary man
date it has received from the Salvadoran peo
ple, will find ways to hold out a hand of concilia
tion to those adversaries who are prepared to
take part peacefully in the democratic process
now so encouragingly under way in El
Salvador,"
Haig did not elaborate. However, it is known
that the administration, which gambled heavily
on the belief that the elections would demon
strate a lack of popular backing for the guer
rillas, now hopes that a new effort can be made
to convince the insurgents that their only hope
for a share of power lies in winning support
through the ballot box rather than on the bat
tlefield.
Laxalt urges compromise
Washington — Predicting that Republicans
will lose 30 or more House seats in November if
the budget impasse is not soon broken, Sen.
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), probably President Ronald
Reagan's closest friend in Congress, called on
the president yesterday to signal quickly that he
is willing to compromise on both defense
spending and Social Security benefits.
Laxalt's warning that "time is running out" on
a budget compromise came as senior White
House aides indicated some readiness to give
ground on spending questions as long as the or
iginal Reagan three-year tax cut is preserved.
In a speech to the National Association of Re
altors at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Reagan
continued to defend his original economic pro
gram and said he opposes a "budget-busting
bailout" for the troubled housing industry. But
Reagan also said he was "open to any and all
suggestions to reduce the size of the federal
deficit that do not endanger our freedom."
The president offered in the speech to "put
aside ... political differences," and aides
pointed to this passage, saying he was now seek
ing to avoid partisanship in the budget debate.
Laxalt told reporters that, "knowing Reagan,"
he was convinced "he will play his cards right to
the end, but he's not going to take the economy
and his party over the cliff."
But the senator, who headed Reagan's presi
dential campaigns in both 1976 and 1980, said
that is where they are headed unless a com
promise budget plan is passed by the middle of
May.
Stocks finish mixed
Blue chip issues showed some strength, but
the rest of the stock market finished mixed in a
sluggish session yesterday.
Trading set its slowest pace in more than six
weeks. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
fractionally lower going into the last hour,
closed up 5.90 at 823.32.
But the overall tally on the New York Stock
Exchange showed losers slightly outnumbering
gainers.
Gold closed at $318.50 per troy ounce in New
York.
Today's weather
Variable clouds with showers through tomor
row. A few thundershowers some with small
hail. Snow on the hills above about 1500 feet.
Lows in the 30s to mid 40s. Highs in the 50s.
Southwest winds 15 to 25 mph. Winds gusty
near thundershowers.

Laxalt urges compromise
Washington — Predicting that Republicans
will lose 30 or more House seats in November if
the budget impasse is not soon broken, Sen.
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), probably President Ronald
Reagan's closest friend in Congress, called on
the president yesterday to signal quickly that he
is willing to compromise on both defense
spending and Social Security benefits.
Laxalt's warning that "time is running out" on
a budget compromise came as senior White
House aides indicated some readiness to give
ground on spending questions as long as the or
iginal Reagan three-year tax cut is preserved.
In a speech to the National Association of Re
altors at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Reagan
continued to defend his original economic pro
gram and said he opposes a "budget-busting
bailout" for the troubled housing industry. But
Reagan also said he was "open to any and all
suggestions to reduce the size of the federal
deficit that do not endanger our freedom."
The president offered in the speech to "put
aside ... political differences," and aides
pointed to this passage, saying he was now seek
ing to avoid partisanship in the budget debate.
Laxalt told reporters that, "knowing Reagan,"
he was convinced "he will play his cards right to
the end, but he's not going to take the economy
and his party over the cliff."
But the senator, who headed Reagan's presi
dential campaigns in both 1976 and 1980, said
that is where they are headed unless a com
promise budget plan is passed by the middle of
May.

No majority for Salvadoran parties
San Salvador, El Salvador — The centrist Christian Democrats and
their extreme-right challengers, both falling short of a majority in El
Salvador's election, scrambled for coalition partners yesterday to gov
ern the war-weary country.
As returns continued to trickle in yesterday, the major parties' shares
of the vote held steady. The Christian Democrats of Jose Napoleon
Duarte, president of the current U.S.-backed military-civilian junta, had
40 percent of the nationwide tally, and the ultra-rightist Republican Na
tionalist Alliance (ARENA) of former army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson
had 30 percent.
Each of the two parties predicted it would form a majority coalition
with one or more of the smaller conservative groups in the 60-member
assembly, which is to name an interim government and write a new con
stitution leading to general elections, probably next year.
The Reagan administration, meanwhile, sent a new signal on nego
tiations to end the civil war.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said in Washington the constituent
assembly elected here Sunday should "hold out the hand of concilia
tion" to leftist guerrillas who are ready to join in the democratic process
in this Central American nation.
There were no immediate official reports on the voter turnout, but
Salvadorans said it was the largest in recent memory.
The White House, noting the apparently large voter turnout, hailed
the election as a "victory for the people" and a defeat for the guerrillas,
who had sought futilely to disrupt the balloting
The left had boycotted the election, saying its
candidates would have been risking assassina
tion by El Salvador's right-wing "death squads."
With 500 of 4 600 polling stations reporting,
the Central Election Commission gave the fol
lowing count: Christian Democrats, 79,680
votes, 40.1 percent; ARENA, 58,646 votes, 29.5
percent; National Conciliation Party, 32,190
votes, 16.2 percent; Democratic Action Party,
18,828 votes, 9.4 percent; Popular Salvadoran
Party, 6 597 votes, 3.3 percent, and Popular Ori
entation Party, 2 605 votes, 1.3 percent.
Shuttle landing stalled
White Sands Missile Range, N.M. — Wind
whipped dust and drifting sands turned away
the space shuttle Columbia from this desert site
less than an hour before it was supposed to
swoop down here yesterday morning.
Space agency officials commanded the craft
to remain aloft another day and began to con
template shifting the landing site to a new run
way at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
Officials said that the space plane, carrying
astronauts Jack Lousma and C. Gordon Full
erton, would definitely be brought down today,
either at this Army base in the southeastern cor
ner of New Mexico or at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral.
A National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration spokesman said the "possibilities are
high" that the landing would take place in Flori
da because the weather there was expected to
be better.
Today's forecast for White Sands called for
winds as strong or stronger than those that
kicked up a dust haze several hundred feet
above the basin floor.
The 35-mph winds blew so much sand across
thex-shaped runways of the so-called Northrup
Strip where the Columbia was to touchdown
that the black centerline was covered over.
It was the first time a spacecraft landing had
been delayed because of weather. The shuttle,
which does not have power in its glide to earth,
is more sensitive to weather conditions than
conventional aircraft. The space capsules of
earlier missions were directed away from bad
weather for ocean landings.
Chariots of Fire best picture
Hollywood — Henry Fonda and Katharine
Hepburn won Oscars for their co-starring roles
as husband and wife in On Golden Pond at the
54th Academy Awards last night, and Chariots
of Fire was named best picture.
For the 76-year-old Fonda, it was his first Os
car for acting. It was the 72-year-old Miss Hep
burn's fourth — a record number for acting in a
leading role.
Chariots, a British film that won critical ac
claim, had not been considered among top
contenders for best picture of 1981. It told the
story of two runners — one a jew from Oxford,
the other a Scottish missionary — competing in
the Olympic Games of 1924.
Fonda, who played octogenarian Norman
Thayer in On Golden Pond, burst into tears
when his award was announced on television
Monday night, his wife said.
"He just burst into tears. He's so emotional,"
said his wife Shirlee Fonda outside the couple's
Bel-Air home following the conclusion of the
54th Annual Academy Awards presentation.
"I am so happy and proud," the 76-year-old
actor enthused when he learned he had re
ceived his first acting Oscar, Mrs. Fonda said.
Fonda, who has been confined for months to
his home with heart and other physical prob
lems, watched the awards on television and was

particularly pleased when the best actress Oscar
award went to his co-star Katharine Hepburn.
"He just beamed. He said, 'I told you so,' "
Mrs. Fonda said.
jane Fonda accepted the Oscar on behalf of
her father and was to bring it to his house after
the awards program.
Israelis disrupt Nablus rally
Televiv, Israel — Israeli troops used tear gas to
break up a Palestinian demonstration in Nablus
and an Israeli settler fired his pistol to escape a
road ambush in the occupied West Bank yester
day, the military command reported.
It was the 11th straight day of clashes in a wave
of troubles in the occupied Arab territories in
which five Arabs have been killed by Israeli
gunfire.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment, which said Sunday it would not tolerate
violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
meanwhile was bracing for trouble among Is
rael's Arab citizens today, the sixth anniversary
of clashes that killed six Israeli Arabs.
Many of Israel's Arab villages, where one
sixth of the population lives, will beonstriketo
day and three marches are scheduled to com
memorate those killed in 1976 and also to pro
test government policy in the West Bank.
The link between West Bank and Israeli Arab
issues sparked concern in Israel, where the Jew
ish majority hopes the Arab citizenry will re
main loyal.
The military command said five West Bank vil
lages and refugee camps were under total
curfew, including the village of Khadr, where
an Israeli settler was ambushed by a hail of
stones and burning tires were rolled at his car at
an improvised road barricade.
The Israeli, who is the treasurer at the nearby
settlement Gush Etzion, drew his pistol and
fired to drive off the rioters, the command said.
Blood was found on the ground, indicating
that one of the Palestinian youths might have
been wounded, but no gunshot wound was re
ported in hospitals, the command said.
The settler's car was destroyed, and the vil
lage of Khadr, five miles south of Jerusalem, was
put under curfew.
The command said curfews also were im
posed on the towns of Halhoul, Sair and Jaabed,
where three Palestinians were wounded Sun
day in anti-Israel riots, and on the refugee camp
at Jenin in the northern West Bank.
Haig hails voter turnout
Washington — The Reagan administration,
with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in the
forefront, yesterday hailed the high voter turn
out in El Salvador's elections as a defeat for the
guerrillas and hinted at new moves to entice the
insurgents "to take part peacefully in the demo
cratic process."
Although the outcome of the balloting for a
constituent assembly was still unclear, Haig
took the unusual step of appearing at the State
Department's daily press briefing to read a
statement calling the turnout "an unmistakable
repudiation of the advocates of force and vio
lence."
He said that for the guerrillas, who had
sought to make the elections virtually im
possible to carry out, the results were "a military
defeat quite as much as a political repudiation.
Despite their clear intention to disrupt the elec
tions, the guerrillas were unable to shake either
the people or the security forces at their mo
ment of greatest vulnerability."
While other U.S. officials said it was too early
to predict what kind of interim government is
likely to emerge from the elections, Haig hinted

that the administration believes U.S. persuasion
and pressure will lead to formation of a coali
tion pledged to continue U.S.-supported poli
cies of internal reform and resistance to leftist
attempts to win power by force.
He said, "We are confident that the consti
tuent assembly, given the extraordinary man
date it has received from the Salvadoran peo
ple, will find ways to hold out a hand of concilia

break up a Palestinian demonstration in Nablus
and an Israeli settler fired his pistol to escape a
road ambush in the occupied West Bank yester
day, the military command reported.
It was the 11th straight day of clashes in a wave
of troubles in the occupied Arab territories in
which five Arabs have been killed by Israeli
gunfire.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment, which said Sunday it would not tolerate
violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
meanwhile was bracing for trouble among Is
rael's Arab citizens today, the sixth anniversary
of clashes that killed six Israeli Arabs.
Many of Israel's Arab villages, where one
sixth of the population lives, will beonstriketo
day and three marches are scheduled to com
memorate those killed in 1976 and also to pro
test government policy in the West Bank.
The link between West Bank and Israeli Arab
issues sparked concern in Israel, where the Jew
ish majority hopes the Arab citizenry will re
main loyal.
The military command said five West Bank vil
lages and refugee camps were under total
curfew, including the village of Khadr, where
an Israeli settler was ambushed by a hail of
stones and burning tires were rolled at his car at
an improvised road barricade.
The Israeli, who is the treasurer at the nearby
settlement Gush Etzion, drew his pistol and
fired to drive off the rioters, the command said.
Blood was found on the ground, indicating
that one of the Palestinian youths might have
been wounded, but no gunshot wound was re
ported in hospitals, the command said.
The settler's car was destroyed, and the vil
lage of Khadr, five miles south of Jerusalem, was
put under curfew.
The command said curfews also were im
posed on the towns of Halhoul, Sair and Jaabed,
where three Palestinians were wounded Sun
day in anti-Israel riots, and on the refugee camp
at Jenin in the northern West Bank.
Haig hails voter turnout
Washington — The Reagan administration,
with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in the
forefront, yesterday hailed the high voter turn
out in El Salvador's elections as a defeat for the
guerrillas and hinted at new moves to entice the
insurgents "to take part peacefully in the demo
cratic process."
Although the outcome of the balloting for a
constituent assembly was still unclear, Haig
took the unusual step of appearing at the State
Department's daily press briefing to read a
statement calling the turnout "an unmistakable
repudiation of the advocates of force and vio
lence."
He said that for the guerrillas, who had
sought to make the elections virtually im
possible to carry out, the results were "a military
defeat quite as much as a political repudiation.
Despite their clear intention to disrupt the elec
tions, the guerrillas were unable to shake either
the people or the security forces at their mo
ment of greatest vulnerability."
While other U.S. officials said it was too early
to predict what kind of interim government is
likely to emerge from the elections, Haig hinted

that the administration believes U.S. persuasion
and pressure will lead to formation of a coali
tion pledged to continue U.S.-supported poli
cies of internal reform and resistance to leftist
attempts to win power by force.
He said, "We are confident that the consti
tuent assembly, given the extraordinary man
date it has received from the Salvadoran peo
ple, will find ways to hold out a hand of concilia
tion to those adversaries who are prepared to
take part peacefully in the democratic process
now so encouragingly under way in El
Salvador,"
Haig did not elaborate. However, it is known
that the administration, which gambled heavily
on the belief that the elections would demon
strate a lack of popular backing for the guer
rillas, now hopes that a new effort can be made
to convince the insurgents that their only hope
for a share of power lies in winning support
through the ballot box rather than on the bat
tlefield.
Laxalt urges compromise
Washington — Predicting that Republicans
will lose 30 or more House seats in November if
the budget impasse is not soon broken, Sen.
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), probably President Ronald
Reagan's closest friend in Congress, called on
the president yesterday to signal quickly that he
is willing to compromise on both defense
spending and Social Security benefits.
Laxalt's warning that "time is running out" on
a budget compromise came as senior White
House aides indicated some readiness to give
ground on spending questions as long as the or
iginal Reagan three-year tax cut is preserved.
In a speech to the National Association of Re
altors at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Reagan
continued to defend his original economic pro
gram and said he opposes a "budget-busting
bailout" for the troubled housing industry. But
Reagan also said he was "open to any and all
suggestions to reduce the size of the federal
deficit that do not endanger our freedom."
The president offered in the speech to "put
aside ... political differences," and aides
pointed to this passage, saying he was now seek
ing to avoid partisanship in the budget debate.
Laxalt told reporters that, "knowing Reagan,"
he was convinced "he will play his cards right to
the end, but he's not going to take the economy
and his party over the cliff."
But the senator, who headed Reagan's presi
dential campaigns in both 1976 and 1980, said
that is where they are headed unless a com
promise budget plan is passed by the middle of
May.

Blue chip issues showed some strength, but
the rest of the stock market finished mixed in a

Trading set its slowest pace in more than six

No majority for Salvadoran parties
San Salvador, El Salvador — The centrist Christian Democrats and
their extreme-right challengers, both falling short of a majority in El
Salvador's election, scrambled for coalition partners yesterday to gov
ern the war-weary country.
As returns continued to trickle in yesterday, the major parties' shares
of the vote held steady. The Christian Democrats of Jose Napoleon
Duarte, president of the current U.S.-backed military-civilian junta, had
40 percent of the nationwide tally, and the ultra-rightist Republican Na
tionalist Alliance (ARENA) of former army Maj. Roberto d'Aubuisson
had 30 percent.
Each of the two parties predicted it would form a majority coalition
with one or more of the smaller conservative groups in the 60-member
assembly, which is to name an interim government and write a new con
stitution leading to general elections, probably next year.
The Reagan administration, meanwhile, sent a new signal on nego
tiations to end the civil war.
Secretary of State Alexander Haig said in Washington the constituent
assembly elected here Sunday should "hold out the hand of concilia
tion" to leftist guerrillas who are ready to join in the democratic process
in this Central American nation.
There were no immediate official reports on the voter turnout, but
Salvadorans said it was the largest in recent memory.
The White House, noting the apparently large voter turnout, hailed
the election as a "victory for the people" and a defeat for the guerrillas,
who had sought futilely to disrupt the balloting
The left had boycotted the election, saying its
candidates would have been risking assassina
tion by El Salvador's right-wing "death squads."
With 500 of 4 600 polling stations reporting,
the Central Election Commission gave the fol
lowing count: Christian Democrats, 79,680
votes, 40.1 percent; ARENA, 58,646 votes, 29.5
percent; National Conciliation Party, 32,190
votes, 16.2 percent; Democratic Action Party,
18,828 votes, 9.4 percent; Popular Salvadoran
Party, 6 597 votes, 3.3 percent, and Popular Ori

Shuttle landing stalled
White Sands Missile Range, N.M. — Wind
whipped dust and drifting sands turned away
the space shuttle Columbia from this desert site
less than an hour before it was supposed to
swoop down here yesterday morning.
Space agency officials commanded the craft
to remain aloft another day and began to con
template shifting the landing site to a new run
way at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
Officials said that the space plane, carrying
astronauts Jack Lousma and C. Gordon Full
erton, would definitely be brought down today,
either at this Army base in the southeastern cor
ner of New Mexico or at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral.
A National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration spokesman said the "possibilities are
high" that the landing would take place in Flori
da because the weather there was expected to
be better.
Today's forecast for White Sands called for
winds as strong or stronger than those that
kicked up a dust haze several hundred feet
above the basin floor.
The 35-mph winds blew so much sand across
thex-shaped runways of the so-called Northrup
Strip where the Columbia was to touchdown
that the black centerline was covered over.
It was the first time a spacecraft landing had
been delayed because of weather. The shuttle,
which does not have power in its glide to earth,
is more sensitive to weather conditions than
conventional aircraft. The space capsules of
earlier missions were directed away from bad
weather for ocean landings.
Chariots of Fire best picture
Hollywood — Henry Fonda and Katharine
Hepburn won Oscars for their co-starring roles
as husband and wife in On Golden Pond at the
54th Academy Awards last night, and Chariots
of Fire was named best picture.
For the 76-year-old Fonda, it was his first Os
car for acting. It was the 72-year-old Miss Hep
burn's fourth — a record number for acting in a
leading role.
Chariots, a British film that won critical ac
claim, had not been considered among top
contenders for best picture of 1981. It told the
story of two runners — one a jew from Oxford,
the other a Scottish missionary — competing in
the Olympic Games of 1924.
Fonda, who played octogenarian Norman
Thayer in On Golden Pond, burst into tears
when his award was announced on television
Monday night, his wife said.
"He just burst into tears. He's so emotional,"
said his wife Shirlee Fonda outside the couple's
Bel-Air home following the conclusion of the
54th Annual Academy Awards presentation.
"I am so happy and proud," the 76-year-old
actor enthused when he learned he had re
ceived his first acting Oscar, Mrs. Fonda said.
Fonda, who has been confined for months to
his home with heart and other physical prob
lems, watched the awards on television and was

particularly pleased when the best actress Oscar
award went to his co-star Katharine Hepburn.
"He just beamed. He said, 'I told you so,' "
Mrs. Fonda said.
jane Fonda accepted the Oscar on behalf of
her father and was to bring it to his house after
the awards program.

whipped dust and drifting sands turned away
the space shuttle Columbia from this desert site
less than an hour before it was supposed to
swoop down here yesterday morning.
Space agency officials commanded the craft
to remain aloft another day and began to con
template shifting the landing site to a new run
way at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
Officials said that the space plane, carrying
astronauts Jack Lousma and C. Gordon Full
erton, would definitely be brought down today,
either at this Army base in the southeastern cor
ner of New Mexico or at the Kennedy Space
Center at Cape Canaveral.
A National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration spokesman said the "possibilities are
high" that the landing would take place in Flori
da because the weather there was expected to
be better.
Today's forecast for White Sands called for
winds as strong or stronger than those that
kicked up a dust haze several hundred feet
above the basin floor.
The 35-mph winds blew so much sand across
thex-shaped runways of the so-called Northrup
Strip where the Columbia was to touchdown
that the black centerline was covered over.
It was the first time a spacecraft landing had
been delayed because of weather. The shuttle,
which does not have power in its glide to earth,
is more sensitive to weather conditions than
conventional aircraft. The space capsules of
earlier missions were directed away from bad
weather for ocean landings.
Chariots of Fire best picture
Hollywood — Henry Fonda and Katharine
Hepburn won Oscars for their co-starring roles
as husband and wife in On Golden Pond at the
54th Academy Awards last night, and Chariots
of Fire was named best picture.
For the 76-year-old Fonda, it was his first Os
car for acting. It was the 72-year-old Miss Hep
burn's fourth — a record number for acting in a
leading role.
Chariots, a British film that won critical ac
claim, had not been considered among top
contenders for best picture of 1981. It told the
story of two runners — one a jew from Oxford,
the other a Scottish missionary — competing in
the Olympic Games of 1924.
Fonda, who played octogenarian Norman
Thayer in On Golden Pond, burst into tears
when his award was announced on television
Monday night, his wife said.
"He just burst into tears. He's so emotional,"
said his wife Shirlee Fonda outside the couple's
Bel-Air home following the conclusion of the
54th Annual Academy Awards presentation.
"I am so happy and proud," the 76-year-old
actor enthused when he learned he had re
ceived his first acting Oscar, Mrs. Fonda said.
Fonda, who has been confined for months to
his home with heart and other physical prob
lems, watched the awards on television and was

particularly pleased when the best actress Oscar
award went to his co-star Katharine Hepburn.
"He just beamed. He said, 'I told you so,' "
Mrs. Fonda said.
jane Fonda accepted the Oscar on behalf of
her father and was to bring it to his house after
the awards program.
Israelis disrupt Nablus rally
Televiv, Israel — Israeli troops used tear gas to
break up a Palestinian demonstration in Nablus
and an Israeli settler fired his pistol to escape a
road ambush in the occupied West Bank yester
day, the military command reported.
It was the 11th straight day of clashes in a wave
of troubles in the occupied Arab territories in
which five Arabs have been killed by Israeli
gunfire.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's govern
ment, which said Sunday it would not tolerate
violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
meanwhile was bracing for trouble among Is
rael's Arab citizens today, the sixth anniversary
of clashes that killed six Israeli Arabs.
Many of Israel's Arab villages, where one
sixth of the population lives, will beonstriketo
day and three marches are scheduled to com
memorate those killed in 1976 and also to pro
test government policy in the West Bank.
The link between West Bank and Israeli Arab
issues sparked concern in Israel, where the Jew
ish majority hopes the Arab citizenry will re
main loyal.
The military command said five West Bank vil
lages and refugee camps were under total
curfew, including the village of Khadr, where
an Israeli settler was ambushed by a hail of
stones and burning tires were rolled at his car at
an improvised road barricade.
The Israeli, who is the treasurer at the nearby
settlement Gush Etzion, drew his pistol and
fired to drive off the rioters, the command said.
Blood was found on the ground, indicating
that one of the Palestinian youths might have
been wounded, but no gunshot wound was re
ported in hospitals, the command said.
The settler's car was destroyed, and the vil
lage of Khadr, five miles south of Jerusalem, was
put under curfew.
The command said curfews also were im
posed on the towns of Halhoul, Sair and Jaabed,
where three Palestinians were wounded Sun
day in anti-Israel riots, and on the refugee camp
at Jenin in the northern West Bank.
Haig hails voter turnout
Washington — The Reagan administration,
with Secretary of State Alexander Haig in the
forefront, yesterday hailed the high voter turn
out in El Salvador's elections as a defeat for the
guerrillas and hinted at new moves to entice the
insurgents "to take part peacefully in the demo
cratic process."
Although the outcome of the balloting for a
constituent assembly was still unclear, Haig
took the unusual step of appearing at the State
Department's daily press briefing to read a
statement calling the turnout "an unmistakable
repudiation of the advocates of force and vio
lence."
He said that for the guerrillas, who had
sought to make the elections virtually im
possible to carry out, the results were "a military
defeat quite as much as a political repudiation.
Despite their clear intention to disrupt the elec
tions, the guerrillas were unable to shake either
the people or the security forces at their mo
ment of greatest vulnerability."
While other U.S. officials said it was too early
to predict what kind of interim government is
likely to emerge from the elections, Haig hinted

that the administration believes U.S. persuasion
and pressure will lead to formation of a coali
tion pledged to continue U.S.-supported poli
cies of internal reform and resistance to leftist
attempts to win power by force.
He said, "We are confident that the consti
tuent assembly, given the extraordinary man
date it has received from the Salvadoran peo
ple, will find ways to hold out a hand of concilia
tion to those adversaries who are prepared to
take part peacefully in the democratic process
now so encouragingly under way in El
Salvador,"
Haig did not elaborate. However, it is known
that the administration, which gambled heavily
on the belief that the elections would demon
strate a lack of popular backing for the guer
rillas, now hopes that a new effort can be made
to convince the insurgents that their only hope
for a share of power lies in winning support
through the ballot box rather than on the bat
tlefield.
Laxalt urges compromise
Washington — Predicting that Republicans
will lose 30 or more House seats in November if
the budget impasse is not soon broken, Sen.
Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), probably President Ronald
Reagan's closest friend in Congress, called on
the president yesterday to signal quickly that he
is willing to compromise on both defense
spending and Social Security benefits.
Laxalt's warning that "time is running out" on
a budget compromise came as senior White
House aides indicated some readiness to give
ground on spending questions as long as the or
iginal Reagan three-year tax cut is preserved.
In a speech to the National Association of Re
altors at the Washington Hilton Hotel, Reagan
continued to defend his original economic pro
gram and said he opposes a "budget-busting
bailout" for the troubled housing industry. But
Reagan also said he was "open to any and all
suggestions to reduce the size of the federal
deficit that do not endanger our freedom."
The president offered in the speech to "put
aside ... political differences," and aides
pointed to this passage, saying he was now seek
ing to avoid partisanship in the budget debate.
Laxalt told reporters that, "knowing Reagan,"
he was convinced "he will play his cards right to
the end, but he's not going to take the economy
and his party over the cliff."
But the senator, who headed Reagan's presi
dential campaigns in both 1976 and 1980, said
that is where they are headed unless a com
promise budget plan is passed by the middle of
May.
