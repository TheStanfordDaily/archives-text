# 'Deathtrap' can't escape the stage
## Deathtrap 
### Steve Vineberg 
Cat-and-mouse mysteries
like Ira Levin's Deathtrap and
its unofficial source, Anthony
Shaffer's Sleuth, really work
only in a theater, where actors
can play hammily off an au
dience, particularly since the
plot devices are stagey tricks
designed to ring down the cur
tain of each act to a round of
enthusiastic applause. Death
trap is so blatantly derivative
that its longevity on the New
York stage attests mostly to the
willingness of Broadway thea
tergoers to rise to the lure of
the familiar; when you re
spond to the worn set-ups of a
play this one, you may feel a lit
tle like one of Pavlov's dogs.
The combination of the de
rivativeness and the staginess
of the material smothers
Deathtrap in the new movie
version, adapted by Jay Presson
Mien and directed by Sidney
L(iinet.
|A decade ago, Michael
Caine played the shrewd
young adversary in the film of
I Sleuth to Laurence Olivier's
seasoned detective story writer
(and stole the picture from un
der Olivier's nose). Now he's
role —
Sidney Bruhl in Deathtrap is a
Mmous writer of mystery plays
has just closed this third

flop in a row — and Christ
opher Reeve is the comer, Clif
ford Anderson, a student of
Bruhl's who threatens to sur
pass the master. (Talk of mas-

ters and disciples in this con
text is somewhat absurd, how
ever; what we see of Bruhl's
latest disaster is so incompe
tent that we don't believe he

could ever have produced a
play of even passable merit.)
This may be Caine's worst
performance. He whacks away
at the Neil Simonesque one-

liners Levin and Allen have
stuck him with, and is altogeth
er so vociferous and obnoxious
that not only does he alienate
us from the outset, but we can't

believe we're watching the
same Michael Caine who gave
such rich, muted line readings
in Dressed to Kill and Victory.
Reeve is more successful — he
has considerable charm and
gives a very good impression of
determined vacuousness —
but he tends to lapse into
something that resembles a
party version of Bill Murray.
Dyan Cannon has been cast
in the unfortunate role of
Bruhl's hysterical, fawning wife
Myra, which is really justan idi
otic extension of the funny
screaming bit she did in
Heaven Can Wait. After her
work in Honeysuckle Rose,
playing a messy line drawing
like Myra is a regression (like
GoldieHawn'sreturn todumb
dumb cutie-pie parts after Sug
ar/anc/ Express and Shampoo)
— and Cannon seems to know
it: her eyes register a mixtureof
impatience and disgust. The
other major performer in
Deathtrap is Irene Worth (as a
Dutch psychic neighbor of the
Bruhls). Worth is a legendary
stage actress, but she is so
broad and mannered in movies
— her performance here isn't
much different from what she
did in last year's Eyewitness —
that it's impossible to tell what
a theatergoer might see in her.
Deathtrap is full of mysteries,
but none of them are in the
script.
