# 'Passione': That's amore
## Passione d'Amore 
### Steve Vineberg 
Ettore Scola's Passione d'Amore has a terrific
plot. In the winter of 1862, Giorgio Bacchetti
(Bernard Giraudeau), a young captain fully con
scious of his own charm and good looks, leaves
the married woman with whom he has been
sleeping, Clara (Laura Antonelli), for a small
town where he is stationed under the command
of a genteel, hospitable colonel (Massimo Girot
ti). The colonel has a chronically ailing cousin,
Fosca (Valeria d'Obici), who is conspicuous by
her absence during the first weeks of Bacchetti's
stay; intrigued by the idea of her, he fancies her
an exquisite frail creature and begins to send her
books to read. When she finally emerges, he is
shocked to find that she is the ugliest creature he
has ever seen — and that she has conceived an
unbounded passion for him. Though he tries to
escape her, he cannot; she holds him by con
trolling the seriousness of her illness and threat
ening to die if he abandons her. However base
his treatment of her, she worships him. He loses
Clara, who decides to give him up for thiswoman
who obviously has a greater need of him. Finally
Fosca humiliates him before his fellow officers
by making a scene over his being transferred to
another post, and the colonel, who had not sus
pected the connection between his cousin and
the captain, misconstrues it and challenges
Giorgio to a duel. But by this time Giorgio has
been transformed; inevitably, the depth of
Fosca's devotion has made him fall in love with
her.
This fascinating scenario, which Scola and
Ruggero Maccari fashioned out of a short story
called "Fosca," is like a fusion of Truffaut's Story
of Adele H., wherein a young woman driven
mad with passion for an uncaring soldier follows
him across the ocean, and the great Jacobean
tragedy The Changeling by Middleton and
Rowley, in which a beautiful woman is obsessed
with an ugly servant who adores her and ul
timately, after he has murdered for her, falls in
love with him. It needs a director and an actress

of extraordinary poetic temperament to pull it
off, as Truffaut and Isabelle Adjani pulled off
Adele H., but what it has instead are Ettore Scola
and Valeria d'Obici.
Scola isn't a bad director — he's made at least
one good film, the touching 1977 We All Loved
Each Other So Much, about the aging of four
close friends — but unlike several of his coun
trymen, he isn't a director with the operatic sen
sibility required for a film of this nature. The long
confessional scenes seem nearly devoid of style,
so we become impatient with them, and when
he tries for high style the results are much worse.
(In one sequence, Bacchetti is suffering from a
fever; all Scola can think of to show us the young
man's delirium is a subjective close-up of the
doctor — played by Jean Louis Trintignant
grinning and blowing pipe smoke in his face.)
There are several celebrated actors in this pic
ture — Girotti, who is entirely wasted, and Trin
tignant and Bernard Blier (as a gluttonous ma
jor), who both have amusing moments — but
the trouble is that they aren't cast in key roles.
Bernard Giraudeau looks like a doughier version
of the late Jim Hutton, and he has a personality
to match. Though he's not nearly as attractive as
everyone keeps telling him he is (Massimo
Girotti, who bemoans the passing of his good
looks, is still an infinitely more interesting cam
era subject, some 40 years after devastating
audiences in Visconti's Ossessione), his pretty
boy face is appropriate, and in any case a good
actor isn't demanded for this role — in fact, a
dull actor might be a wittier choice. But without
a magnificent actress in the role of Fosca, an
Anna Magnani or an Isabelle Adjani, the movie
falls apart. Valeria d'Obici has crow-like features
in this movie (her hooked nose is exactly like a
beak) but she plays all of Fosca's scenes on a sin
gle hysterical note. The idea of Fosca is so funny
and finally so terrifying that after the first half
hour the film becomes compulsively watchable,
but it is very disappointing, and in an unusual
way. Few bad movies have scripts as good as this
one.

mad with passion for an uncaring soldier follows
him across the ocean, and the great Jacobean
tragedy The Changeling by Middleton and
Rowley, in which a beautiful woman is obsessed
with an ugly servant who adores her and ul
timately, after he has murdered for her, falls in
love with him. It needs a director and an actress

of extraordinary poetic temperament to pull it
off, as Truffaut and Isabelle Adjani pulled off
Adele H., but what it has instead are Ettore Scola
and Valeria d'Obici.
Scola isn't a bad director — he's made at least
one good film, the touching 1977 We All Loved
Each Other So Much, about the aging of four
close friends — but unlike several of his coun
trymen, he isn't a director with the operatic sen
sibility required for a film of this nature. The long
confessional scenes seem nearly devoid of style,
so we become impatient with them, and when
he tries for high style the results are much worse.
(In one sequence, Bacchetti is suffering from a
fever; all Scola can think of to show us the young
man's delirium is a subjective close-up of the
doctor — played by Jean Louis Trintignant
grinning and blowing pipe smoke in his face.)
There are several celebrated actors in this pic
ture — Girotti, who is entirely wasted, and Trin
tignant and Bernard Blier (as a gluttonous ma
jor), who both have amusing moments — but
the trouble is that they aren't cast in key roles.
Bernard Giraudeau looks like a doughier version
of the late Jim Hutton, and he has a personality
to match. Though he's not nearly as attractive as
everyone keeps telling him he is (Massimo
Girotti, who bemoans the passing of his good
looks, is still an infinitely more interesting cam
era subject, some 40 years after devastating
audiences in Visconti's Ossessione), his pretty
boy face is appropriate, and in any case a good
actor isn't demanded for this role — in fact, a
dull actor might be a wittier choice. But without
a magnificent actress in the role of Fosca, an
Anna Magnani or an Isabelle Adjani, the movie
falls apart. Valeria d'Obici has crow-like features
in this movie (her hooked nose is exactly like a
beak) but she plays all of Fosca's scenes on a sin
gle hysterical note. The idea of Fosca is so funny
and finally so terrifying that after the first half
hour the film becomes compulsively watchable,
but it is very disappointing, and in an unusual
way. Few bad movies have scripts as good as this
one.
Ettore Scola's Passione d'Amore has a terrific
plot. In the winter of 1862, Giorgio Bacchetti
(Bernard Giraudeau), a young captain fully con
scious of his own charm and good looks, leaves
the married woman with whom he has been
sleeping, Clara (Laura Antonelli), for a small
town where he is stationed under the command
of a genteel, hospitable colonel (Massimo Girot
ti). The colonel has a chronically ailing cousin,
Fosca (Valeria d'Obici), who is conspicuous by
her absence during the first weeks of Bacchetti's
stay; intrigued by the idea of her, he fancies her
an exquisite frail creature and begins to send her
books to read. When she finally emerges, he is
shocked to find that she is the ugliest creature he
has ever seen — and that she has conceived an
unbounded passion for him. Though he tries to
escape her, he cannot; she holds him by con
trolling the seriousness of her illness and threat
ening to die if he abandons her. However base
his treatment of her, she worships him. He loses
Clara, who decides to give him up for thiswoman
who obviously has a greater need of him. Finally
Fosca humiliates him before his fellow officers
by making a scene over his being transferred to
another post, and the colonel, who had not sus
pected the connection between his cousin and
the captain, misconstrues it and challenges
Giorgio to a duel. But by this time Giorgio has
been transformed; inevitably, the depth of
Fosca's devotion has made him fall in love with
her.
This fascinating scenario, which Scola and
Ruggero Maccari fashioned out of a short story
called "Fosca," is like a fusion of Truffaut's Story
of Adele H., wherein a young woman driven
mad with passion for an uncaring soldier follows
him across the ocean, and the great Jacobean
tragedy The Changeling by Middleton and
Rowley, in which a beautiful woman is obsessed
with an ugly servant who adores her and ul
timately, after he has murdered for her, falls in
love with him. It needs a director and an actress

of extraordinary poetic temperament to pull it
off, as Truffaut and Isabelle Adjani pulled off
