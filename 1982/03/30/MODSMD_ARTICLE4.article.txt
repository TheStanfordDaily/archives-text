# BC's Davis walks in to coach hoop
## 
### Sid Spaeth 
Boston College head basketball
coach Tom Davis has "bid farewell to
his players" and accepted the head
coaching job at Stanford, radio sta
tion WRKO in Boston reported yes
terday.
Davis, who led his team to the
quarterfinals of the NCAA Tour
nament this year, was offered the
position by Stanford Athletic Direc
tor Andy Geiger Wednesday, but
waited until this weekend to make
his decision, the Peninsula Times
Tribune reported yesterday.
Stanford Sports Information Direc
tor Bob Rose said yesterday the Ath
letic Department "will neither con
firm nor deny the report," and Bos
ton College Sports Information Di
rector Reid Oslin said that Stanford
officials have asked BC not to com
ment on the report until an an
nouncement is made.
Producer Frank Shorr of WRKO
told the Daily, "We have interviewed
the playersandtheytoldustheyhave
said good-bye. Davis met with his
team this morning and took off for
Stanford. It's final."
Shorr said Davis's father, Emery
Davis, confirmed the report and said
an announcement will be made here
this morning.
"The press conference has only
been speculated on by outside
sources," Rose said. "We have not
scheduled one."
Geiger and Davis met in New Or
leans over the weekend at the na
tional college coaches convention

held in conjunction with the Final
Four. Geiger remained in New Or
leans for the championship and will
fly back today. Davis flew back to
Boston yesterday to say good-bye to
his team, Shorr said.
The Stanford head coaching posi
tion became open Feb. 5 when Dick
Dißiaso resigned — under pressure,
according to some press accounts —
with one year remaining on his con
tract. Stanford finished 7-20 overall
this year, and was 2-16 in Pacific-10
Conference play.
Davis led Boston College to 22-10
record this season, including wins
over San Francisco, DePaul and Kan
sas State in the NCAA tournament.
Houston beat Boston College in the
Midwest Regional finals.
In his 11-year coaching career, in
cluding five seasons at Boston Col
lege, Davis has compiled a 216-91
record.
The Times Tribune reported that
Davis will receive more than $100,000
in salary and benefits at Stanford, in
cluding income from basketball
camps and athletic shoe endorse
ments.
Boston College sources said Davis
came to Stanford also because of his
love for culture and golf.
Knowledgeable sources said Davis
may have been disenchanted with
Boston College's inability to fill it's
less than 5000-seat arena for home
games while the hockey team sold
out Boston Garden for home games
against Harvard.
