# University's '82 energy bill jumps 35 %

I he University's projected energy costs Tor nscal
year 1982 represent a 35 percent increase over the
amount it actually spent in 1981, even though con
sumption has only gone up slightly.
In 1981 the University's electricity and gas bills
came to $9.3 million, while the projected costs for
1982 are $12.6 million, due to an appreciable rate
increase by Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E). Electricity is chiefly responsible for this in
crease; at $7.8 million, the budgeted cost for this
year is 58 percent higher than thes4.9 million Stan
ford paid PG&E last year.
The University's rising electricity expenses can
not be attributed to increased consumption, asthe
numberof kilowatt hoursthe University expects to
purchase from PG&E this year is up only 2.8 per
cent from last year. PG&E's rates, however, are 53
percent higher in 1982 than they were in 1981, and
thus the combination of rate and consumption
creates the 58 percent jump in electricity r osts.
So, while efforts at energy conservation may
help, they do not have much effect against rising

rates for electricity and gas. And, predicted PG&E
spokesperson kon Butkowski, "In the long run,
electric and gas rates wiil continue to go~up." At
the same time, Public Utilities Commission spokes
person Eugene Cresci said that increases in natural
gas rates are projected this spring, while electricity
rates are expected to decrease in June and July.
These forecasts have serious implications for the
University's budget, as Stanford's financial man
agers use energy-rate predictions as one factor in
setting the operating budget before a given fiscal
year. Thus, if PG&E rates are increased unpredic
tably during the year, the established budget may
have to be revised to cover the additional costs.
These increased expenses must be covered by
funds reallocated from other University activities,
which reduces money available for academic
needs such as student aid and salaries, according to
administrators.
The utilities budget has traditionally been ap
proved only by the internal budget group, but will
now be subject to the approval of the full Board of
Trustees. Approval for the fiscal 1983 utilities
budget will come up for vote at the June 11

meeting.
Since energy costs are so important to the Uni
versity's budget, Stanford has decided to' track the
schedule of PG&E's applications for rate increases
and decreases, in order to predict the results when
drawing up the budget.
This was not an easy task, as the PUC allowed
PG&E to apply for rate changes a total of 17 times
last year. Because of current economic conditions
it is necessary for the energy company to petition
several times a year to avoid a large lapse of time
between their application and the granting of the
money. A fuel cost adjustment takes two to three
months to process.
Specifically, PG&E is allowed three Electricity
Cost Adjustment Clauses and two Gas Adjustment
Clauses a year, which go into effect at specified
times during the year. In addition, the company
may apply for one General Rate Case every two
years, covering non-fuel related operational ex
penses. PG&E is also allowed one Interim General
Rate Case increase proposed on an annual basis,
and special adjustments for such factors as solar fi-
