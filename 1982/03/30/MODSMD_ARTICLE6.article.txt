# Mondale calls for nuke weapons freeze
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
San Francisco — Taking one more
step on what many say is a campaign
trail for the 1984 Democratic presi
dential nomination, former Vice
President Walter Mondale called
halting nuclear proliferation "the
number one and absolute solemn
priority of any president" in his
March 17 speech here.
In addition to criticizing President
Ronald Reagan's abandonment of
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT) as a move which left the Unit
ed States "with no proposals to deal
with the terror of rising nuclear
deployment," Mondale also urged
California residents to support a pro
posed referendum on the state ballot
which would direct state officials to
demand a nuclear weapons freeze.
Even the St. Patrick's Day spirit —
apparent everywhere from the Irish
coffee-toting visitors outside the
Sheraton Palace, to the plethora of
green ties on the dais, to the
shamrocks on the cheesecake — did
not prompt a particularly warm re

coption from Mondale's Com
monwealth Club audience. Most of
his speech centered on resource
conservation, but he took advantage
o! a question-and-answer session af
terwards to deliver some direct anti-
Keagan blows.
The Minnesota Democrat, a
former U.S. senator, received only
polite attention when he accused In
ti rior Secretary James Watt and the
Reagan administration of a "rape
and-run philosophy" for lifting Fed

eral regulators which he said threat
ened wildlife and natural resources.
Turning to the economy, Mondale
said the Reagan administration has
"promoted an economic policy that
brought a recession that didn't have
to happen."
He called for the repeal of the 1983
tax cuts and the 1984 tax indexing
plan, and said the defense budget
should be considered an area for
more cuts.
"At least $10 billion can be cut
from the defense budget without
hurting national security," he said.
"About all (Reagan has left for
Congress) istosteal wheelchairs back
from nursing homes," he said.
Mondale said that the state of the
economy demands environmental
protection as well as freedom. The
big losers — in what he called the
" 'war against the earth' — will not
just be those who care about the en
vironment, but American business as
well.
"The Reagan administration has
put foxes in charge of the environ

mental chicken coop/' he said.
The former Carter administration
official said the biggest problems
right noware"attitudinal (There isa)
use-it-up-now philosophy which re
peals the environmental progress of
the past decade."
He particularly called for main
tenance of tough clean air standards,
energy conservation, and standards
which allow adequate flexibility for
American industry.
Mondale seemed slightly un
familiar with his prepared environ
mental speech, frequently stumbling
and at one point admitting that he
had skipped a page.
This was not Mondale's first ap
pearance before the largely conser
vative Commonwealth Club, which
regularly features both state and na
tional figures at its weekly noon
luncheon speeches; as vice presi
dent, he had made several other ap
pearances, primarily speaking on
arms control and SALT, an area in
which he is considered strong.
