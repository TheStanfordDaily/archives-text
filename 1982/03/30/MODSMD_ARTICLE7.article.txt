# University 'joke file' closed amid staff complaints
## 
### 
A University computer file containing more than
1300 jokes proved to be no laughing matter to ad
ministrators here after a black Stanford staff mem
ber complained that some of the jokes were insult
ing and racially offensive. The file was removed
from public access Friday, nearly two months after
the official's request.
The joke file — accessible to staff, faculty and
students — was used as part of a training exercise
for employees learning to use the University's gen
eral computer system.
Started three years ago with a set of 100 non-of
fensive jokes, the file had grown to 1308 jokes, as
any user of the campus SPIRES system was able
to make additions, and officials at the Center for
Information Technology (CIT) did not review them
or disallow the practice, according to the Univer

sity's News Service.
The classifications for jokes included "clean,"
"dirty," "filthy" and "sick," and contained jokes
that disparage blacks, Jews, Poles and homosex
uals.
"We asked people to classify their own jokes and
never reviewed them for taste," said John Sack,
manager of SPIRES.
But Henry Organ, associate director for founda
tions in the Office of Development, learned of the
file Jan. 27, and sent a memo the next day to Ed
Shaw, CIT director, requesting that the offensive
jokes be deleted and that those responsible for
them be reprimanded. He sent copies of the
memo to University President Donald Kennedy
and Ombudsman John Goheen, but said that his
request failed to bring about any action, although

Goheen telephoned him to express his concern
and promise to look into the matter.
Organ sent a letter dated March 4 to the editor
of the Daily explaining the situation and lack of
University response, but it was received after page
layouts for the paper's final issue of Winter Quar
ter were planned.
Organ quoted a few of the jokes in the letter,
such as "Question — Did you hear about Ku Klux
Knievel? Answer — He jumped over fifty negroes
with a steam roller," and "Question — What wood
doesn't float? Answer — Natalie Wood," and said
that some of the jokes in the file had been on dis
play for more than a year. He concluded by saying
he had recieved no response as of that date from
CIT director Ed Shaw.
The file was finally removed from
public access by Shaw Friday, a few
hours after an inquiry by a reporter
from the Peninsula Times-Tribune. A
release the same day from the Uni
versity News Service said that "con
cern over censorship issues was a fac
tor in the delay."
Organ told the Daily yesterday that
after seeing some of the jokes about
blacks in the file, "I was pissed." He

said that he was not satisfied with the
University's slow response to the is
sue and that he does not considerthe
removal of the file an end to what he
calls an attitudinal problem. "I'd like
the administration to be a lot more
responsive to things that are of
fensive to individuals," he added.
Because individuals jokes could
tire file was removed from access. It is
now in the computer desk of John
Sack, SPIRES system manager, and ac
cessible only to him.
