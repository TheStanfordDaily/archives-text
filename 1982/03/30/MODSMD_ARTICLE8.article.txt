## Cell receptor for rabies virus Identified 
### Bruce Quinn 
The recent identification of a
normal cell surface molecule
which also serves as a receptor
for the rabies virus may hold
important clues for the under
standing of viral infections in
general.
Dr. Thomas Lentz and col
laborators at the Yale Univer
sity School of Medicine have
shown that in laboratory cell
cultures, the rabies virus rapid
ly accumulates at the junctions
between motor nerves and
muscle cells by binding to
dense clusters of receptors
which normally bind chemicals
involved in neurotransmission.
Binding to these receptors may
allow the virus to enter the mo
tor nerve, and travel thrugh the
nerve to the spinal cord and
brain. The effects of rabies vi
rus on the central nervous sys
tem are usually fatal.
Viruses which cause nervous
system diseases may be able to
bind only to specific natural re
ceptors on neurons, or nerve
cells, while a virus causing liver

disease may be adapted to bind
to a natural receptor found
only on liver cells. Under
standing exactly how a given
virus has evolved to take ad
vantage of the body's receptor
systems may provide the most
specific means of fighting a giv
en viral disease.
"Knowing the identity of the
receptor for any virus provides
a basis for preventing infection
by blocking the attachment of
the virus to the receptor,"
Lentz said, according to Na
tional Science Foundation
sources. "It may be possible to
identify non-toxic compounds
which would compete with a
virus for its receptor site. By
preventing binding by the virus
to its receptor, such an agent
would either prolong the time
the body needs to build up a
supply of antibodies to the vi
rus, or simply prevent viral in
fection of the cells."
Lentz's work developed
from his studies of the
acetylcholine receptor, which
is found both at the nerve
muscle junction and at junc

tions between neurons in the
brain. The neurotransmitter
acetylcholine is released at the
motor neuron's terminal with
the muscle fiber, where it is
bound by an acetylcholine re
ceptor on the muscle. This
causes a brief electrical pulse,
and the muscle fiber contracts.
Lentz's studies of the rabies
virus were made possible by a
group of drugs related to the
natural toxin curare, which
causes paralysis by blocking
the acetylcholine receptor.
When one of these drugs was
added to a laboratory prepara
tion of cells and rabies viruses,
the ability of the virus to enter
the cells was greatly reduced.
After the virus has travelled
up the spinal cord via a motor
nerve, the virus could continue
using the acetylcholine recep
tor to travel between brain
neurons that bind
acetylcholine. Once inside a
cell, a single virus can repro
duce itself hundreds of times,
and each new virus may be re
leased to infect other cells.
