# ICN tries discharge program

The birth of a premature or disabled baby can
understandably be a traumatic experience for
the parents. In particular, the baby's move from
the hospital, where professionals have been car
ing for the newborn, to the home may be fright
ening.
In recognition of these difficulties, Stanford
University Hospital's Intensive Care Nursery
(ICN) has instituted a one-year pilot program to
prepare parents for the problems they may face
once the baby is home.
In January, Kathy Petersen, who originally
proposed the program, took the newly estab
lished position of ICN discharge planner. "The
doctors were very receptive," she said, "espe
cially because I arranged my own financing
through the group, Friends of Children Needing
Special Care."
Petersen, who has a master's degree in early
education, said she saw the need for a program
of this type when she was a pediatric physical
therapist and worked with cerebral palsy chil
dren. "A large number of familiesdescribedthat
they had not been prepared to take their babies
home or that the babies had not been diagnosed

as early as they could have been, so I decided to
do something about it," she said.
Petersen's past experience working with fami
lies and their handicapped children enables her
to give parents the necessary support.
"A nurse is not normally experienced in emo
tional or psychosocial roles," Petersen said,
"and parent support networks are just for dis
abled babies, and premees don't fit in."
In addition to performing her routine duties,
Petersen said she has started a telephone follow
up program to find out how parents and their
babies are doing once they are home. She said
this is an important part of the program because
"although you can't really compare a premee to
a normal baby, the quality of interaction (be
tween parents and premees) tends to be less ad
vanced."
In developmental testing, it has been found,
Petersen said, that the psychological and motor
functioning of premature babies may be dif
ferent than for normal babies, and therefore, ad
justments in measuring progress need to be
made. For example, a baby that is born three
months early may only be at the stage of a nor
mal three-month baby when it is six months old.
