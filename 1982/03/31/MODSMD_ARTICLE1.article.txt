# Fee assessment options
## ASSU asks student input in spring vote 
### Kathy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
After three hours of debate, the
ASSU Senate last night agreed to put
a referendum on the spring ballot
that will allow students to indicate
whether they favor a refundable or
mandatory fee assessment system.
The referendum will offer students
two options: a fee assessment system
with no refunds, or one limiting re
funds to students who voted in the
election in which the assessments
were authorized.
The referendum is strictly an at
tempt to gauge student opinion and
does not bind the senate to any par
ticular action. If a clear majority of
voters favors either proposal, how
ever, senators intend to incorporate
the system favored by voters into a
constitutional amendment to be
voted on in a special election two
weeks after the general election.
Two-thirds of the students voting
in an election are needed to ratify a
constitutional amendment.
The senate action was motivated
by the recent Council of Presidents
(COP) veto of two senate bills that at
tempted to reform the assessment
system by placing two constitutional
amendments on the general election
ballot for student approval. How
ever, the COP members felt that the
bills were too complex and confusing
for voters to understand.
In the text of the veto, COP mem
bers said they vetoed the bills be
cause they felt obligated to "insure
... that each student knows exactly
the meaning of his or her vote."
Because COP members said the is
sue of fee assessment reform should
be addressed in the next election,
COP member Chris Greene worked
with Rules Committee Chairman Jim
McGrath to draw up the text of a ref
erendum that simplified and con
solidated the refund Issue.
Senate Deputy Chair Roc Blumen
thal said the special election neces
sary to pass the constitutional
amendment was too costly and
would likely have a low voter turn
out. He suggested that the senate set
a minimum voter percentage for the

special election to ensure that the
final fee assessment reforms reflect
ed true voter sentiment.
But Greene said the extra expen
diture — estimated to be between
$700 and $1000 — would be a "good
use of funds" and that even a small
number of voters would accurately
reflect the wishes of the entire stu
dent body.
McGrath agreed that a minimum
number of voters was not necessary
for the election to be valid.
"The constitution says two-thirds
of the people voting and I thinkthat's
perfectly sufficient," he said.
Some senators claimed that the or
iginal wording of the referendum
was slanted toward the refundable
system because McGrath, a sup
porter of the refundable system,
drew it up.
"What we have is a referendum
where the person who wrote the ref
erendum was clearly in favor of one
of the options," said Senator Jordan
Bender.
Senator Andy Benn also felt that
the original wording attempted to
"coach" the students into voting for
the refundable system. Benn sug
gested that the advantages of both
systems should be listed on the ballot
so that the students would have a
clearer idea of their alternatives.
Benn said it was essential for the
benefits of both proposals to be
listed on the ballot because other
wise students might not "take the
time to find out both sides of the is
sue."
McGrath said a list of the benefits
of the proposals had no place on the
ballot. "I think this is perfectly satis
factory as it stands," he said. The elec
tion handbook is a more appropriate
place for such opinions, he said.
But the senate turned down the
brief version offered by fvlcCjrath In a
close vote and eventually passed new
wording devised by Benn and Sena
tor Rod Beckstrom. The final draft of
the referendum listed the advantages
of both a mandatory and a non-re
fundable system on the ballot for stu
dent decision.

"The constitution says two-thirds
of the people voting and I thinkthat's
perfectly sufficient," he said.
Some senators claimed that the or
iginal wording of the referendum
was slanted toward the refundable
system because McGrath, a sup
porter of the refundable system,
drew it up.
"What we have is a referendum
where the person who wrote the ref
erendum was clearly in favor of one
of the options," said Senator Jordan
Bender.
Senator Andy Benn also felt that
the original wording attempted to
"coach" the students into voting for
the refundable system. Benn sug
gested that the advantages of both
systems should be listed on the ballot
so that the students would have a
clearer idea of their alternatives.
Benn said it was essential for the
benefits of both proposals to be
listed on the ballot because other
wise students might not "take the
time to find out both sides of the is
sue."
McGrath said a list of the benefits
of the proposals had no place on the
ballot. "I think this is perfectly satis
factory as it stands," he said. The elec
tion handbook is a more appropriate
place for such opinions, he said.
But the senate turned down the
brief version offered by fvlcCjrath In a
close vote and eventually passed new
wording devised by Benn and Sena
tor Rod Beckstrom. The final draft of
the referendum listed the advantages
of both a mandatory and a non-re
fundable system on the ballot for stu
dent decision.
