## The 						fight continues in East Palo Alto incorporation dispute 
### Jeffrey Golden 
Editor's note: Yesterday, writer Jeffrey Golden
identified the principal characters in East Palo Alto's
incorporation battle. In the fight the East Palo Alto
Citizens' Committee on Incorporation (EPPACCI) has
met with opposition from the San Mateo County's Lo
cal Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo).
In order to vote on incorporation East Palo Alto first
needed LAFCo's approval. Last September LAFCo
vetoed the proposal. One month later LAFCo re
versed its position.
The reversal incensed realtor Am Cenedella and
other opponents of incorporation. In a bid to thwart
the incorporation movement Cenedella filed a law
suit against LAFCo's second decision.
Today, the controversy continues.
Am Cenedella contends LAFCo's reversal was look
ing after the best interests of San Mateo County and
not of East Palo Alto residents.

Cenedella maintains that the second set of viability
figures in LAFCo's reversal prove the agency's indif
ference to East Palo Alto's fate. The city, according to
the agency's second McDonald report, would oper
ate at a yearly deficit of $250,000. A one-time sever
ance payment from the county of about $1.2 million
would keep the city going for a while, but by 1985-86 it
would plunge into the red.
EPACCI staff member Omowale Satterwhite dis
putes the point. Cenedella saw the second McDonald
report, Satterwhite says,"and that's when he fixated.
He won't recognize the revisions and memos that
have come out since then." Satterwhite says that the
yearly $250,000 shortfall will be counterbalanced by
funds from four sources that have come to light since
the report:
• The 1980-81 property tax figures, released later than
the report, will yield $125,000 more in revenue than

had been estimated.
• Another $30,000 to $40,000 will come from the North
Euclid's property taxes, even though it remains out
side of the boundaries. In return East Palo Alto will
provide some services for this area, which would be
too small and remote to serve efficiently from
Redwood City.
• A recent 2-cent increase in the state gasoline tax will
provide another $40,000.
• Every year the city would receive $90 per registered
voter from the state in vehicle in-lieu (excise) tax rev
enue. McDonald estimated a total of 6800 East Palo
Altan voters. Satterwhite says that more than 7500 are
registered now — an incremental boost of $63,000 —
and that 1000 to 3000 more could be registered by the
June 30 deadline. The ongoing EPACCI registration
drive is aimed as much at increasing this allocation as
at passing the incorporation proposal.
These revisions (excluding the prospect of future
registrants) add about $260,000 a year to the
McDonald's figures and give East Palo Alto a theo
retical budget surplus.
EPACCI also has a second opinion behind it. It com
missioned a $100,000 report from SRI International,
whifch corroborated the McDonald figures, the re
visions, and suggested other economies — such as
one-person police patrols — that would further re
duce expenses.
At the end of this extended trail of paper, the ques
tion of East Palo Alto's economic viability remains un
answered. Even the elements of the equation that are
normally predictable, such as federal revenue-shar
ing funds and state excise revenues, for which new
formulas are being devised, are uncertain today. A
senior staff member of LAFCo sounded weary when
asked about the statistical debate between Cenedella
and EPACCI. "The numbers have been done and re
done ad nauseum," he said. "The truth probably lies
somewhere in between."
Because of a pending lawsuit filed by Cenedella's
group, the official declined comment on LAFCo's ap
parent reversal on incorporation. But he described a
major split between the LAFCo staff, which processed
the consulting reports, and the LAFCo board over in
corporation approval. "The staff fought it down to the
last hour," he said. "We just got beat. A lot of politics
were involved. It was a close call, one of the poorest
I've ever seen."

The problems of forecasting the future budget tilt
of an incorporated East Palo Alto make the area's
potential for commercial and residential develop
ment a critical issue. Additional businesses and homes
that add to the new city's tax base could make the dif
ference.
EPACCI is quick to stress that the McDonald calcu
lations depend on no revenue from future develop
ment. But prospering new stores, industrial plants,
and housing projects are clearly part of the vision that
incorporation supporters have for their new city.
"There's a lot of vacant land and human energy here
that can make conditions right for all kinds of en
terprises," says Greta Pedersen, who canvasses door
to-docjr for EPACCI.
Barbara Mouton argues that incorporation would
give local officials the authority they need to make
their own arrangements with businessmen interested
in the area. And zoning could be designed with the
same end in mind. "If we can make our own rules
about how the land gets used, we can make it real in
viting for businesses to move in," says Ted Hopgood,
a 30-year resident and a Stanford deputy sheriff. "And
local businesses mean local jobs. The county doesn't
have any incentive to let business settle in here like
that."
In fact, says Mouton, the county's bias works in the
other direction. She blames the Bank of America's de

cision to close its East Palo Alto branch on county poli
cy. Because the area's tax revenues were deposited in
Redwood City, she says, the local bank lacked the as
sets necessary to continue operating.
Arn Cenedella is not impressed by the speculation
about future growth. "If there's been no develop
ment in the past six years, with the economy and real
estate booming," he says, "why should it come during
a recession? Just because the city incorporates? That's
ridiculous!" He predicts that continuing budget defi
cits will lead to a deterioration of city services that will
leave East Palo Alto less and less attractive to investors,
which in turn will starve the tax base, which will cause
a further cut in services, in a continuing downward
cycle.
Joseph Sanders, a 20-year resident, is just as skep
tical. He says the inventory of East Palo Alto businesses
speaks for itself. The community has a liquor store and
a laundromat in what used to be the Nairobi Shop
ping Center and a handful of grocery stores, gas sta
tions, cafes, and garages near the freeway. "If this
town were capable of expansion and development,"
he says, "we would have seen more than this."
"We don't have the base for a city now and nothing
points to one coming soon." Sanders plans to vote
against incorporation. "I don't believe in buying a pig
in a poke," he says."I believe in what I see."
As president of the East Palo Alto Sanitary district,
Sanders is familiar with the most immediate obstacle
to development. The district is allowing no new sew
age hook-ups because its system is running at 93 per
cent of capacity. The freeze has stopped at least four
businesses and subdivisions from locating in East Palo
Alto.
Incorporation's potential effect on this critical bot
tleneck is another point of contention. EPACCI says
that an autonomous city could negotiate with neigh
boring towns such as Los Altos Hills (which is using 75
percent of its capacity) for extra service. Edward Agh
jayan, who supervises the Palo Alto sewage plants
used by several area communities, says that that kind
of transfer of allotment could easily be accomplished.
But Cenedella sees the point as another exam
ple of ungrounded optimism. He says that East Palo
Alto would have to bid heavily against other expand
ing communities, particularly Mountain View, for any
excess sewage capacity. And he says that capacity at
the central plant is irrelevant if the trunk lines be
neath East Palo Alto are nearly full. Expanding the un
derground delivery system would be an enormous
expense. Cenedella believes that East Palo Alto faces
that expense in the near future, and that it will filter
down to residents in the form of higher user fees.
As another pivotal issue of incorporation, user fees
are, of course, another hot source of conflict. Most
residents are anxious first of all to know what a new
city will cost them in dollars and cents. EPACCI's
Pedersen says that most of the resistance she meets
while canvassing comes from fears that incorporation
would require huge tax increases. EPACCI's promo
tional material battles this notion in bold type. Several
sections of its fact sheet end with almost the same re
minder-. "THERE WOULD BE NO INCREASE IN THE
TAX RATE BASED ON INCORPORATION."
But incorporation's opponents say that even if that
promise can be kept, life in East Palo Alto could get
much more expensive. Cenedella believes that the in
tention of tax limitations can and will be circum
vented by increases in the rates charged for such ser
vices as sewer and water. The McDonald report calls
for an additional $351,000 in userfees — abouts2oper
resident per year — but Cenedella believes actual rate
hikes will be much higher. "And that," he says, "not
expensive subdivisions and condominiums, is the
fastest way to displace poor people."

provide some services for this area, which would be
too small and remote to serve efficiently from
Redwood City.
• A recent 2-cent increase in the state gasoline tax will
provide another $40,000.
• Every year the city would receive $90 per registered
voter from the state in vehicle in-lieu (excise) tax rev
enue. McDonald estimated a total of 6800 East Palo
Altan voters. Satterwhite says that more than 7500 are
registered now — an incremental boost of $63,000 —
and that 1000 to 3000 more could be registered by the
June 30 deadline. The ongoing EPACCI registration
drive is aimed as much at increasing this allocation as
at passing the incorporation proposal.
These revisions (excluding the prospect of future
registrants) add about $260,000 a year to the
McDonald's figures and give East Palo Alto a theo
retical budget surplus.
EPACCI also has a second opinion behind it. It com
missioned a $100,000 report from SRI International,
whifch corroborated the McDonald figures, the re
visions, and suggested other economies — such as
one-person police patrols — that would further re
duce expenses.
At the end of this extended trail of paper, the ques
tion of East Palo Alto's economic viability remains un
answered. Even the elements of the equation that are
normally predictable, such as federal revenue-shar
ing funds and state excise revenues, for which new
formulas are being devised, are uncertain today. A
senior staff member of LAFCo sounded weary when
asked about the statistical debate between Cenedella
and EPACCI. "The numbers have been done and re
done ad nauseum," he said. "The truth probably lies
somewhere in between."
Because of a pending lawsuit filed by Cenedella's
group, the official declined comment on LAFCo's ap
parent reversal on incorporation. But he described a
major split between the LAFCo staff, which processed
the consulting reports, and the LAFCo board over in
corporation approval. "The staff fought it down to the
last hour," he said. "We just got beat. A lot of politics
were involved. It was a close call, one of the poorest
I've ever seen."

The problems of forecasting the future budget tilt
of an incorporated East Palo Alto make the area's
potential for commercial and residential develop
ment a critical issue. Additional businesses and homes
that add to the new city's tax base could make the dif
ference.
EPACCI is quick to stress that the McDonald calcu
lations depend on no revenue from future develop
ment. But prospering new stores, industrial plants,
and housing projects are clearly part of the vision that
incorporation supporters have for their new city.
"There's a lot of vacant land and human energy here
that can make conditions right for all kinds of en
terprises," says Greta Pedersen, who canvasses door
to-docjr for EPACCI.
Barbara Mouton argues that incorporation would
give local officials the authority they need to make
their own arrangements with businessmen interested
in the area. And zoning could be designed with the
same end in mind. "If we can make our own rules
about how the land gets used, we can make it real in
viting for businesses to move in," says Ted Hopgood,
a 30-year resident and a Stanford deputy sheriff. "And
local businesses mean local jobs. The county doesn't
have any incentive to let business settle in here like
that."
In fact, says Mouton, the county's bias works in the
other direction. She blames the Bank of America's de

cision to close its East Palo Alto branch on county poli
cy. Because the area's tax revenues were deposited in
Redwood City, she says, the local bank lacked the as
sets necessary to continue operating.
Arn Cenedella is not impressed by the speculation
about future growth. "If there's been no develop
ment in the past six years, with the economy and real
estate booming," he says, "why should it come during
a recession? Just because the city incorporates? That's
ridiculous!" He predicts that continuing budget defi
cits will lead to a deterioration of city services that will
leave East Palo Alto less and less attractive to investors,
which in turn will starve the tax base, which will cause
a further cut in services, in a continuing downward
cycle.
Joseph Sanders, a 20-year resident, is just as skep
tical. He says the inventory of East Palo Alto businesses
speaks for itself. The community has a liquor store and
a laundromat in what used to be the Nairobi Shop
ping Center and a handful of grocery stores, gas sta
tions, cafes, and garages near the freeway. "If this
town were capable of expansion and development,"
he says, "we would have seen more than this."
"We don't have the base for a city now and nothing
points to one coming soon." Sanders plans to vote
against incorporation. "I don't believe in buying a pig
in a poke," he says."I believe in what I see."
As president of the East Palo Alto Sanitary district,
Sanders is familiar with the most immediate obstacle
to development. The district is allowing no new sew
age hook-ups because its system is running at 93 per
cent of capacity. The freeze has stopped at least four
businesses and subdivisions from locating in East Palo
Alto.
Incorporation's potential effect on this critical bot
tleneck is another point of contention. EPACCI says
that an autonomous city could negotiate with neigh
boring towns such as Los Altos Hills (which is using 75
percent of its capacity) for extra service. Edward Agh
jayan, who supervises the Palo Alto sewage plants
used by several area communities, says that that kind
of transfer of allotment could easily be accomplished.
But Cenedella sees the point as another exam
ple of ungrounded optimism. He says that East Palo
Alto would have to bid heavily against other expand
ing communities, particularly Mountain View, for any
excess sewage capacity. And he says that capacity at
the central plant is irrelevant if the trunk lines be
neath East Palo Alto are nearly full. Expanding the un
derground delivery system would be an enormous
expense. Cenedella believes that East Palo Alto faces
that expense in the near future, and that it will filter
down to residents in the form of higher user fees.
As another pivotal issue of incorporation, user fees
are, of course, another hot source of conflict. Most
residents are anxious first of all to know what a new
city will cost them in dollars and cents. EPACCI's
Pedersen says that most of the resistance she meets
while canvassing comes from fears that incorporation
would require huge tax increases. EPACCI's promo
tional material battles this notion in bold type. Several
sections of its fact sheet end with almost the same re
minder-. "THERE WOULD BE NO INCREASE IN THE
TAX RATE BASED ON INCORPORATION."
But incorporation's opponents say that even if that
promise can be kept, life in East Palo Alto could get
much more expensive. Cenedella believes that the in
tention of tax limitations can and will be circum
vented by increases in the rates charged for such ser
vices as sewer and water. The McDonald report calls
for an additional $351,000 in userfees — abouts2oper
resident per year — but Cenedella believes actual rate
hikes will be much higher. "And that," he says, "not
expensive subdivisions and condominiums, is the
fastest way to displace poor people."

Editor's note: Yesterday, writer Jeffrey Golden
identified the principal characters in East Palo Alto's
incorporation battle. In the fight the East Palo Alto
Citizens' Committee on Incorporation (EPPACCI) has
met with opposition from the San Mateo County's Lo
cal Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo).
In order to vote on incorporation East Palo Alto first
needed LAFCo's approval. Last September LAFCo
vetoed the proposal. One month later LAFCo re
versed its position.
The reversal incensed realtor Am Cenedella and
other opponents of incorporation. In a bid to thwart
the incorporation movement Cenedella filed a law
suit against LAFCo's second decision.
Today, the controversy continues.
Am Cenedella contends LAFCo's reversal was look
ing after the best interests of San Mateo County and
not of East Palo Alto residents.

Cenedella maintains that the second set of viability
figures in LAFCo's reversal prove the agency's indif
ference to East Palo Alto's fate. The city, according to
the agency's second McDonald report, would oper
ate at a yearly deficit of $250,000. A one-time sever
ance payment from the county of about $1.2 million
would keep the city going for a while, but by 1985-86 it
would plunge into the red.
EPACCI staff member Omowale Satterwhite dis
putes the point. Cenedella saw the second McDonald
report, Satterwhite says,"and that's when he fixated.
He won't recognize the revisions and memos that
have come out since then." Satterwhite says that the
yearly $250,000 shortfall will be counterbalanced by
funds from four sources that have come to light since
the report:
• The 1980-81 property tax figures, released later than
the report, will yield $125,000 more in revenue than

had been estimated.
• Another $30,000 to $40,000 will come from the North
Euclid's property taxes, even though it remains out
side of the boundaries. In return East Palo Alto will
provide some services for this area, which would be
too small and remote to serve efficiently from
Redwood City.
• A recent 2-cent increase in the state gasoline tax will
provide another $40,000.

last hour," he said. "We just got beat. A lot of politics
were involved. It was a close call, one of the poorest
I've ever seen."

The problems of forecasting the future budget tilt
of an incorporated East Palo Alto make the area's
potential for commercial and residential develop
ment a critical issue. Additional businesses and homes
that add to the new city's tax base could make the dif
ference.
EPACCI is quick to stress that the McDonald calcu
lations depend on no revenue from future develop
ment. But prospering new stores, industrial plants,
and housing projects are clearly part of the vision that
incorporation supporters have for their new city.
"There's a lot of vacant land and human energy here
that can make conditions right for all kinds of en
terprises," says Greta Pedersen, who canvasses door
to-docjr for EPACCI.
Barbara Mouton argues that incorporation would
give local officials the authority they need to make
their own arrangements with businessmen interested
in the area. And zoning could be designed with the
same end in mind. "If we can make our own rules
about how the land gets used, we can make it real in
viting for businesses to move in," says Ted Hopgood,
a 30-year resident and a Stanford deputy sheriff. "And
local businesses mean local jobs. The county doesn't
have any incentive to let business settle in here like
that."
In fact, says Mouton, the county's bias works in the
other direction. She blames the Bank of America's de

cision to close its East Palo Alto branch on county poli
cy. Because the area's tax revenues were deposited in
Redwood City, she says, the local bank lacked the as
sets necessary to continue operating.
Arn Cenedella is not impressed by the speculation
about future growth. "If there's been no develop
ment in the past six years, with the economy and real
estate booming," he says, "why should it come during
a recession? Just because the city incorporates? That's
ridiculous!" He predicts that continuing budget defi
cits will lead to a deterioration of city services that will
leave East Palo Alto less and less attractive to investors,
which in turn will starve the tax base, which will cause
a further cut in services, in a continuing downward
cycle.
Joseph Sanders, a 20-year resident, is just as skep
tical. He says the inventory of East Palo Alto businesses
speaks for itself. The community has a liquor store and
a laundromat in what used to be the Nairobi Shop
ping Center and a handful of grocery stores, gas sta
tions, cafes, and garages near the freeway. "If this
town were capable of expansion and development,"
he says, "we would have seen more than this."
"We don't have the base for a city now and nothing
points to one coming soon." Sanders plans to vote
against incorporation. "I don't believe in buying a pig
in a poke," he says."I believe in what I see."
As president of the East Palo Alto Sanitary district,
Sanders is familiar with the most immediate obstacle
to development. The district is allowing no new sew
age hook-ups because its system is running at 93 per
cent of capacity. The freeze has stopped at least four
businesses and subdivisions from locating in East Palo
Alto.
Incorporation's potential effect on this critical bot
tleneck is another point of contention. EPACCI says
that an autonomous city could negotiate with neigh
boring towns such as Los Altos Hills (which is using 75
percent of its capacity) for extra service. Edward Agh
jayan, who supervises the Palo Alto sewage plants
used by several area communities, says that that kind
of transfer of allotment could easily be accomplished.
But Cenedella sees the point as another exam
ple of ungrounded optimism. He says that East Palo
Alto would have to bid heavily against other expand
ing communities, particularly Mountain View, for any
excess sewage capacity. And he says that capacity at
the central plant is irrelevant if the trunk lines be
neath East Palo Alto are nearly full. Expanding the un
derground delivery system would be an enormous
expense. Cenedella believes that East Palo Alto faces
that expense in the near future, and that it will filter
down to residents in the form of higher user fees.
As another pivotal issue of incorporation, user fees
are, of course, another hot source of conflict. Most
residents are anxious first of all to know what a new
city will cost them in dollars and cents. EPACCI's
Pedersen says that most of the resistance she meets
while canvassing comes from fears that incorporation
would require huge tax increases. EPACCI's promo
tional material battles this notion in bold type. Several
sections of its fact sheet end with almost the same re
minder-. "THERE WOULD BE NO INCREASE IN THE
TAX RATE BASED ON INCORPORATION."
But incorporation's opponents say that even if that
promise can be kept, life in East Palo Alto could get
much more expensive. Cenedella believes that the in
tention of tax limitations can and will be circum
vented by increases in the rates charged for such ser
vices as sewer and water. The McDonald report calls
for an additional $351,000 in userfees — abouts2oper
resident per year — but Cenedella believes actual rate
hikes will be much higher. "And that," he says, "not
expensive subdivisions and condominiums, is the
fastest way to displace poor people."

Editor's note: Yesterday, writer Jeffrey Golden
identified the principal characters in East Palo Alto's
incorporation battle. In the fight the East Palo Alto
Citizens' Committee on Incorporation (EPPACCI) has
met with opposition from the San Mateo County's Lo
cal Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo).
In order to vote on incorporation East Palo Alto first
needed LAFCo's approval. Last September LAFCo
vetoed the proposal. One month later LAFCo re
versed its position.
The reversal incensed realtor Am Cenedella and
other opponents of incorporation. In a bid to thwart
the incorporation movement Cenedella filed a law
suit against LAFCo's second decision.
Today, the controversy continues.
Am Cenedella contends LAFCo's reversal was look
ing after the best interests of San Mateo County and
not of East Palo Alto residents.

Cenedella maintains that the second set of viability
figures in LAFCo's reversal prove the agency's indif
ference to East Palo Alto's fate. The city, according to
the agency's second McDonald report, would oper
ate at a yearly deficit of $250,000. A one-time sever
ance payment from the county of about $1.2 million
would keep the city going for a while, but by 1985-86 it
would plunge into the red.
EPACCI staff member Omowale Satterwhite dis
putes the point. Cenedella saw the second McDonald
report, Satterwhite says,"and that's when he fixated.
He won't recognize the revisions and memos that
have come out since then." Satterwhite says that the
yearly $250,000 shortfall will be counterbalanced by
funds from four sources that have come to light since
the report:
• The 1980-81 property tax figures, released later than
the report, will yield $125,000 more in revenue than

had been estimated.
• Another $30,000 to $40,000 will come from the North
Euclid's property taxes, even though it remains out
side of the boundaries. In return East Palo Alto will
provide some services for this area, which would be
too small and remote to serve efficiently from
Redwood City.
• A recent 2-cent increase in the state gasoline tax will
provide another $40,000.
• Every year the city would receive $90 per registered
voter from the state in vehicle in-lieu (excise) tax rev
enue. McDonald estimated a total of 6800 East Palo
Altan voters. Satterwhite says that more than 7500 are
registered now — an incremental boost of $63,000 —
and that 1000 to 3000 more could be registered by the
June 30 deadline. The ongoing EPACCI registration
drive is aimed as much at increasing this allocation as
at passing the incorporation proposal.
These revisions (excluding the prospect of future
registrants) add about $260,000 a year to the
McDonald's figures and give East Palo Alto a theo
retical budget surplus.
EPACCI also has a second opinion behind it. It com
missioned a $100,000 report from SRI International,
whifch corroborated the McDonald figures, the re
visions, and suggested other economies — such as
one-person police patrols — that would further re
duce expenses.
At the end of this extended trail of paper, the ques
tion of East Palo Alto's economic viability remains un
answered. Even the elements of the equation that are
normally predictable, such as federal revenue-shar
ing funds and state excise revenues, for which new
formulas are being devised, are uncertain today. A
senior staff member of LAFCo sounded weary when
asked about the statistical debate between Cenedella
and EPACCI. "The numbers have been done and re
done ad nauseum," he said. "The truth probably lies
somewhere in between."
Because of a pending lawsuit filed by Cenedella's
group, the official declined comment on LAFCo's ap
parent reversal on incorporation. But he described a
major split between the LAFCo staff, which processed
the consulting reports, and the LAFCo board over in
corporation approval. "The staff fought it down to the
last hour," he said. "We just got beat. A lot of politics
were involved. It was a close call, one of the poorest
