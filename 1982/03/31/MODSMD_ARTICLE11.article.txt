## Weinberger refuses to listen 
### 
Though you often have no clue what it will be, you do
learn something every day around this university. Take a
day late in the last quarter, the Friday that Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger came to campus. I drew a price
less lesson from that day: the men who run this country
aren't listening. That's it. As lessons go, it's simple. It
might even be, in the light of the government's unyield
ing embrace of massively unpopular budget and Central
American policies, boringly obvious. And, too, it might
not grab you because it points to no clear course of ac
tion for those who oppose virtually everything this ad
ministration does. But we can't afford to forget or ignore
the fact that the men who run this country aren't listen
ing.
This modest fact overcame me for the first time as I sat
halfway down a conference table from Weinberger. An
other 18 students and assorted Stanford characters filled
the rest of the seats for the informal get-together, a
warm-up of sorts for his Kresge speech that night. Once
at the beginning and again early into the session, we said
we were interested in an open airing of our views rather
than a tight, tidy, Q-and-A format. "Wonderful," said
Weinberger, smiling his awesomely civilized smile.
"That's why I was so delighted to come down here today,
to hear what was on your minds."
What Weinberger heard, in fact, in that short session
was the measured hum of his own words, packaged as
pronouncements that mixed equal parts of Cold War
rhetoric and reprocessed, academicized Reaganisms.
His monologue was not continuous — a few comments
or questions filled the rare pauses — but it may as well
have been.
Weinberger responded to each interruption as if his
brain had been programmed, like modern wire-tapping
devices, to activate at the sound of certain key words. So,
for example, when the man across from Weinberger
asked if our intransigence toward Nicaragua might not
be forcing it into Soviet arms, Weinberger heard mmm
mmmmmNICARAGUA, and out came the Nicaragua
tape: worldwide Communist aggression, the Moscow-
Havana-Managua weapons pipeline, the click-click
click of the Central American dominoes, before you can
say Joe Stalin they're drinking vodka instead of tequila in
Tijuana.
Weinberger's tape played on smoothly, unhurriedly,
until the loop was completed. There was no audible click
when it ended, only a shift in the Secretary's gaze from
his politely folded hands to our politely puzzled faces.
That was our cue to share another Student Concern with
him.
The next question would activate another taped loop,
which was followed after completion by another Con
cern and yet another loop. And so it was that in 40
minutes we piayed sever a\ o( the Secretary's
favorite tapes, sort of a Top Ten on the charts of White
House propaganda. None of our comments/questions,
no matter how thoughtful or carefully phrased, could
slow the Secretary's mechanism. He heard mmmmm
mNUCLEAR WEAPONRY, mmmmmmmmEL
SALVADOR, mmmmmmmmmmmDßAFT REGIS
TRATION, and the appropriate tape would begin to roll.
The content of these live recordings, while less striking
than the rote, lifeless way they were presented, was in
itself remarkable. In an administration run by men who

see the world in simple patterns of black and white,
Weinberger supposedly noticed a few grays. Many
voiced relief when President-elect Reagan gave the top
Pentagon seat to this "moderate" Republican.
This moderate Republican left a memorable collection
of statements with us. Besides his reminder about the
global Communist conspiracy — the "oldie but goodie"
of this Top Ten — the Secretary told us that:
• the elections in El Salvador (completed by the time
these words are read) will be a fair and free reflection of
that country's popular will, as long as international of
ficials are allowed to observe the balloting.
• resistance to draft registration makes little or no sense,
since the Selective Service asks for much less information
than does the IRS or Census Bureau; "All you need to
give is your name and where you can be reached if
needed."
• The Soviet nuclear buildup can be interpreted only as
an offensive, not defensive, course of action, because
"they know with certainty we would never fire the first
shot." It is the Soviets, said the Secretary, and not us,
who insist that limited nuclear war is possible.
These topics, steadily addressed on this and other
pages, need no comment here. Nor is it useful to look
further for Weinberger's true political color; he is, per
haps, a moderate cabinet officer in the Reagan adminis
tration just as a 6-foot-9 basketball player is a small center
in the NBA.
What is most important is that the Secretary's view
point was absolutely unchanged by our little meeting,
because nothing got through that could have changed it.
His Nicaragua, El Salvador, Nuclear Weapons, and Draft
tapes, having run through their loops, are all cued up
and ready to play for the next audience (some wound
around again during that night's Kresge address, or so I
was told by people who heard it).
The Secretary's essential deafness is more than un
fortunate. It is frightening. It exposes a myth that few of
us, no matter how cynical or disillusioned, have wholly
abandoned: that people of good will can narrow the dif
ferences between them by reasoning together.
We could meditate on whether the Secretary is in fact
a man of good will, whether he sat down with us in the
delusion that he might hear something, or to brag casual
ly to some reporter about his ongoing dialogue with
American students. Either way his impenetrability was
the same. Our unspoken hope that one of our remarks
might somehow reach him, might give him a new morsel
to chew on, was doomed to disappointment. I don't be
lieve that there is a phrase or sentence in any human lan
guage that could have given the secretary a moment of
doubt about the righteousness of his position.
This lesson, my priceless lesson for that day, has a prac
tical implication: anyone inclined to actively oppose this
administration should do so without squandering
energy and attention on civilized dialogue with its poli
cymakers. This might mean, according to your tastes,
writing your congressman, working for Democratic can
didates this year and in 1984, organizing new progressive
coalitions, preparing for the armed revolution, or plot
ting to throw a cream pie in Reagan's <ace. We Wave to
guard against the iiiusion that the administration wtii vol
untarily stray one inch from its drive towards plutocracy
and militarism.
Illusion is all it can be. Your case against Reagan poli
cies towards the Third World, nuclear arms, or supply
side economics may approach the limits of per
suasiveness and lucidity. But it all sounds like
mmmmmmmm to those who aren't listening.

because nothing got through that could have changed it.
His Nicaragua, El Salvador, Nuclear Weapons, and Draft
tapes, having run through their loops, are all cued up
and ready to play for the next audience (some wound
around again during that night's Kresge address, or so I
was told by people who heard it).
The Secretary's essential deafness is more than un
fortunate. It is frightening. It exposes a myth that few of
us, no matter how cynical or disillusioned, have wholly
abandoned: that people of good will can narrow the dif
ferences between them by reasoning together.
We could meditate on whether the Secretary is in fact
a man of good will, whether he sat down with us in the
delusion that he might hear something, or to brag casual
ly to some reporter about his ongoing dialogue with
American students. Either way his impenetrability was
the same. Our unspoken hope that one of our remarks
might somehow reach him, might give him a new morsel
to chew on, was doomed to disappointment. I don't be
lieve that there is a phrase or sentence in any human lan
guage that could have given the secretary a moment of
doubt about the righteousness of his position.
This lesson, my priceless lesson for that day, has a prac
tical implication: anyone inclined to actively oppose this
administration should do so without squandering
energy and attention on civilized dialogue with its poli
cymakers. This might mean, according to your tastes,
writing your congressman, working for Democratic can
didates this year and in 1984, organizing new progressive
coalitions, preparing for the armed revolution, or plot
ting to throw a cream pie in Reagan's <ace. We Wave to
guard against the iiiusion that the administration wtii vol
untarily stray one inch from its drive towards plutocracy
and militarism.
Illusion is all it can be. Your case against Reagan poli
cies towards the Third World, nuclear arms, or supply
side economics may approach the limits of per
suasiveness and lucidity. But it all sounds like
mmmmmmmm to those who aren't listening.

Though you often have no clue what it will be, you do
learn something every day around this university. Take a
day late in the last quarter, the Friday that Defense Secre
tary Caspar Weinberger came to campus. I drew a price
less lesson from that day: the men who run this country
aren't listening. That's it. As lessons go, it's simple. It
might even be, in the light of the government's unyield
ing embrace of massively unpopular budget and Central
American policies, boringly obvious. And, too, it might
not grab you because it points to no clear course of ac
tion for those who oppose virtually everything this ad
ministration does. But we can't afford to forget or ignore
the fact that the men who run this country aren't listen
ing.
This modest fact overcame me for the first time as I sat
halfway down a conference table from Weinberger. An
other 18 students and assorted Stanford characters filled
the rest of the seats for the informal get-together, a
warm-up of sorts for his Kresge speech that night. Once
at the beginning and again early into the session, we said
we were interested in an open airing of our views rather
than a tight, tidy, Q-and-A format. "Wonderful," said
Weinberger, smiling his awesomely civilized smile.
"That's why I was so delighted to come down here today,
to hear what was on your minds."
What Weinberger heard, in fact, in that short session
was the measured hum of his own words, packaged as
pronouncements that mixed equal parts of Cold War
rhetoric and reprocessed, academicized Reaganisms.
His monologue was not continuous — a few comments
or questions filled the rare pauses — but it may as well
have been.
Weinberger responded to each interruption as if his
brain had been programmed, like modern wire-tapping
devices, to activate at the sound of certain key words. So,
for example, when the man across from Weinberger
asked if our intransigence toward Nicaragua might not
be forcing it into Soviet arms, Weinberger heard mmm
mmmmmNICARAGUA, and out came the Nicaragua
tape: worldwide Communist aggression, the Moscow-
Havana-Managua weapons pipeline, the click-click
click of the Central American dominoes, before you can
say Joe Stalin they're drinking vodka instead of tequila in
Tijuana.
Weinberger's tape played on smoothly, unhurriedly,
until the loop was completed. There was no audible click
when it ended, only a shift in the Secretary's gaze from
his politely folded hands to our politely puzzled faces.
That was our cue to share another Student Concern with
him.
The next question would activate another taped loop,
which was followed after completion by another Con
cern and yet another loop. And so it was that in 40
minutes we piayed sever a\ o( the Secretary's
favorite tapes, sort of a Top Ten on the charts of White
House propaganda. None of our comments/questions,
no matter how thoughtful or carefully phrased, could
slow the Secretary's mechanism. He heard mmmmm
mNUCLEAR WEAPONRY, mmmmmmmmEL
SALVADOR, mmmmmmmmmmmDßAFT REGIS
TRATION, and the appropriate tape would begin to roll.
The content of these live recordings, while less striking
than the rote, lifeless way they were presented, was in
itself remarkable. In an administration run by men who

see the world in simple patterns of black and white,
Weinberger supposedly noticed a few grays. Many
voiced relief when President-elect Reagan gave the top
Pentagon seat to this "moderate" Republican.
This moderate Republican left a memorable collection
of statements with us. Besides his reminder about the
global Communist conspiracy — the "oldie but goodie"
of this Top Ten — the Secretary told us that:
• the elections in El Salvador (completed by the time
these words are read) will be a fair and free reflection of
that country's popular will, as long as international of
ficials are allowed to observe the balloting.
• resistance to draft registration makes little or no sense,
since the Selective Service asks for much less information
than does the IRS or Census Bureau; "All you need to
give is your name and where you can be reached if
needed."
• The Soviet nuclear buildup can be interpreted only as
an offensive, not defensive, course of action, because
"they know with certainty we would never fire the first
shot." It is the Soviets, said the Secretary, and not us,
who insist that limited nuclear war is possible.
These topics, steadily addressed on this and other
pages, need no comment here. Nor is it useful to look
further for Weinberger's true political color; he is, per
haps, a moderate cabinet officer in the Reagan adminis
tration just as a 6-foot-9 basketball player is a small center
in the NBA.
What is most important is that the Secretary's view
point was absolutely unchanged by our little meeting,
