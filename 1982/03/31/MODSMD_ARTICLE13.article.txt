## Israeli policy undermines Mideast peace effort 
### 
Shortly after the Camp David agreements were
signed in September 1978, most Palestinians and all
but a few Arab leaders rejected them as failing to
deal realistically with the issue of Palestinian self
determination. King Hussein of Jordan pointed
out that the agreements endorsed Israel's con
tinued presence on the West Bank and offered
hope of only token autonomy to the Palestinians.
As if to confirm Arab criticism, Prime Minister
Menachem Begin announced a week after signing
the agreements that Israeli troops would remain
on the West Bank indefinitely. Although he had
agreed at Camp David that the final status of the
occupied territories would be determined by ne
gotiations, Begin declared that "there will never
under any circumstances be a Palestinian state."
Two months later Israel revealed a plan to settle
27,000 more families — roughly 100,000 Israelis —
in new West Bank settlements and to take
possession of 250,000 acres of land that was held in
common by the Palestinian inhabitants. The plan
was avowedly designed to carve up the West Bank
in such a way as to make Palestinian self-govern
ment impossible.
While Israel has engaged in sporadic autonomy
talks with Egypt, there has been no progress in set
tling any of the issues involved. At the same time,
Israeli occupation policies have justified predic
tions that Israel would never permit genuine au
tonomy for the Palestinians. Israel has continued
to rule the West Bank with what Newsweek calls an
"iron fist."
Militant settlers take over Arab land, evicting the
inhabitants, and Arab farmers are forbidden to dig

new wells while Israel takes 30 percent of the water
it uses from the West Bank. Palestinian schools and
universities, now under military control, are
harassed by censorship, arbitrary regulations and
frequent shutdowns. Arab newspapers are period
ically closed. Collective punishment is applied to
entire towns and villages. All political activity is
prohibited. Police brutality and vigilante attacks by
settlers against Arabs go unpunished. More and
more Palestinians face the choice of becoming %
low-paid laborers in Israel or migrating abroad.
As Israeli occupation authorities inflict increas
ingly harsh restrictions, each one is followed by a
predictable protest and then an even harder
crackdown. This cycle was tragically repeated on
March 18 when Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
abruptly dismissed the mayor and city council of El
Bireh. El Bireh's mayor, a moderate who advocated
peaceful co-existence between Israelis and Palesti
nians, had refused to cooperate with a new Israeli
administrative agency designed to dilute the au
thority of elected Palestinian officials on the West
Bank. Since then Israel has disbanded two more
town governments.
During the protests and strikes that followed
Sharon's action, Israeli soldiers shot to death at
least five Palestinians who had been throwing
rocks and wounded more than 20 others. The
scenario neared its appointed conclusion on
March 22, when Sharon announced that if the pro
tests continued Israel would annex the West Bank.
Such a move would only formalize an existing
situation: ever since becoming prime minister, Be

gin has moved steadily toward his goal of making
the West Bank an integral part of Israel. Still, formal
annexation of the occupied territories would have
serious consequences. It would harden the posi
tion of Arab leaders, such as the Saudis, who have
offered to make peace with Israel in exchange for
the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
Since annexation would directly repudiate the
Camp David agreements, Egypt would come un-
der strong pressure to serve its relations with Israel
and rejoin the Arab bloc. With all hope gone for a
Palestinian homeland, there would no longer be
any possibility of a negotiated peace between Is
rael and her Arab neighbors; the danger of war
would be ever present.
Under these circumstances Israel would have to
rely solely on its military strength, turning to pre
emptive strikes whenever a threat arose. With con
tinued U.S. support Israel could remain strong, but
far from secure — a garrison state in an area where
per capita arms expenditures are now five times
greater than in Europe. Meanwhile, more than a
million Palestinians within its borders would nurse
bitter and continuing resentment.
Israel's claim to the West Bank has made it nec
essary for Israeli authorities to use increasing
amounts of force against its inhabitants. Tanks and
guns seldom crush a people's determination to be
free. But it is all too likely that in denying the
Palestinians their rights the Israelis will jeopardize
their own democracy and in the long run bring on
another war in the Middle East.

to rule the West Bank with what Newsweek calls an
"iron fist."
Militant settlers take over Arab land, evicting the
inhabitants, and Arab farmers are forbidden to dig

new wells while Israel takes 30 percent of the water
it uses from the West Bank. Palestinian schools and
universities, now under military control, are
harassed by censorship, arbitrary regulations and
frequent shutdowns. Arab newspapers are period
ically closed. Collective punishment is applied to
entire towns and villages. All political activity is
prohibited. Police brutality and vigilante attacks by
settlers against Arabs go unpunished. More and
more Palestinians face the choice of becoming %
low-paid laborers in Israel or migrating abroad.
As Israeli occupation authorities inflict increas
ingly harsh restrictions, each one is followed by a
predictable protest and then an even harder
crackdown. This cycle was tragically repeated on
March 18 when Defense Minister Ariel Sharon
abruptly dismissed the mayor and city council of El
Bireh. El Bireh's mayor, a moderate who advocated
peaceful co-existence between Israelis and Palesti
nians, had refused to cooperate with a new Israeli
administrative agency designed to dilute the au
thority of elected Palestinian officials on the West
Bank. Since then Israel has disbanded two more
town governments.
During the protests and strikes that followed
Sharon's action, Israeli soldiers shot to death at
least five Palestinians who had been throwing
rocks and wounded more than 20 others. The
scenario neared its appointed conclusion on
March 22, when Sharon announced that if the pro
tests continued Israel would annex the West Bank.
Such a move would only formalize an existing
situation: ever since becoming prime minister, Be

gin has moved steadily toward his goal of making
the West Bank an integral part of Israel. Still, formal
annexation of the occupied territories would have
serious consequences. It would harden the posi
tion of Arab leaders, such as the Saudis, who have
offered to make peace with Israel in exchange for
the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
Since annexation would directly repudiate the
Camp David agreements, Egypt would come un-
der strong pressure to serve its relations with Israel
and rejoin the Arab bloc. With all hope gone for a
Palestinian homeland, there would no longer be
any possibility of a negotiated peace between Is
rael and her Arab neighbors; the danger of war
would be ever present.
Under these circumstances Israel would have to
rely solely on its military strength, turning to pre
emptive strikes whenever a threat arose. With con
tinued U.S. support Israel could remain strong, but
far from secure — a garrison state in an area where
per capita arms expenditures are now five times
greater than in Europe. Meanwhile, more than a
million Palestinians within its borders would nurse
bitter and continuing resentment.
Israel's claim to the West Bank has made it nec
essary for Israeli authorities to use increasing
amounts of force against its inhabitants. Tanks and
guns seldom crush a people's determination to be
free. But it is all too likely that in denying the
Palestinians their rights the Israelis will jeopardize
their own democracy and in the long run bring on
another war in the Middle East.

Shortly after the Camp David agreements were
signed in September 1978, most Palestinians and all
but a few Arab leaders rejected them as failing to
deal realistically with the issue of Palestinian self
determination. King Hussein of Jordan pointed
out that the agreements endorsed Israel's con
tinued presence on the West Bank and offered
hope of only token autonomy to the Palestinians.
As if to confirm Arab criticism, Prime Minister
Menachem Begin announced a week after signing
the agreements that Israeli troops would remain
on the West Bank indefinitely. Although he had
agreed at Camp David that the final status of the
occupied territories would be determined by ne
gotiations, Begin declared that "there will never
under any circumstances be a Palestinian state."
Two months later Israel revealed a plan to settle
27,000 more families — roughly 100,000 Israelis —
in new West Bank settlements and to take
possession of 250,000 acres of land that was held in
common by the Palestinian inhabitants. The plan
was avowedly designed to carve up the West Bank
in such a way as to make Palestinian self-govern
ment impossible.
While Israel has engaged in sporadic autonomy
talks with Egypt, there has been no progress in set
tling any of the issues involved. At the same time,
Israeli occupation policies have justified predic
tions that Israel would never permit genuine au
tonomy for the Palestinians. Israel has continued
to rule the West Bank with what Newsweek calls an
"iron fist."
