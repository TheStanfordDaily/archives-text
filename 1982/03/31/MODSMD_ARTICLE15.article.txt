## Peace advocacy ultimately realistic 
### 
Growing public sentiment against
nuclear weapons exposes the fun
damental flaws in our approach to
national defense and security. Our
bombs and missiles turn out to be no
less threatening to the survival of life
than theirs, and our preoccupation
with "strategic advantage" and "first
strike capacity" is no less paranoid
than the enemy we describe. Think
ing war does not build peace. In the
nuclear age we can neither afford not
to think nor fail to make peace.
In an earlier age it was possible to
relegate peace advocacy to the realm
of idealism, leaving realists to con
front the ugly fact of violence in the
world. Pacifists would be asked about
the morality of killing a Hitler or de
fending a loved one from attack. The
charge of "isolationism" was leveled
against those who saw the fun
damental absurdity of wars to end
wars as well as against those who be
lieved that there was work to be done
in our own house.
Political realists scorned the moral
istic avoidance of power as a central
concept in ethical thinking, and few
pacifists were able to respond.
During the Vietnam War political
realists of the stature of Reinhold
Niebuhr and Hans ivlorgenthau op
posed the war. Recently, Am
bassador George Kennan, author of
the containment policy against com
munism, has spoken out against nu
clear weaponry per se. Peace ad
vocacy today as always, contains a
measure of idealism inherent in our
ability to imagine and conceive of a
world of justice and peace. But it is
also a robust, practical analysis of the
political and biological realities in
herent in life itself which has made
peace advocacy reassert itself in
these desperate hours.
Memorial Church Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelly echoes the con
clusions of many non-Christians as
well when he insists that Christians
may not destroy the world even for
our own survival. There is no social,
political, religious, cultural or per
sonal value which can justify
"pushing the button." To do so
would be self-defeating, ideol
ogically and biologically.
The absurdity of "warring for
peace" is highlighted by the threat
our own missiles pose to us. Still, it is
no less present in the policies which,
produce Vietnams and El Salvadors.
The Cold War is the logical result of
thinking war even when such think
ing is motivated by a desire for peace.

Americans whose disappointment
that World War I had not eliminated
war led to a renewed appreciation of
evil were not ready to relax lest they
be "unprepared" in the future.
World War II caught us with our
guard down, they would argue.
"Never again," they vowed.
Soviets surveyed the devastation
wrought upon them by Germany,
adding to a long history of counter
revolutionary interventionism from
the West. Their iron grip on Eastern
Europe reflects the depth to which
that lesson of history was learned.
"Never again," they vow. The same
woeful story is repeated in Israel and
by the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization as well as in Northern Ire
land, China and South Africa.
History has many lessons to teach
us, not the least of which is the futility
of militarism. But one of the factors in
our current dilemma is that the con
sequences of the current militarism
are unprecedented. War planning,
by its current nature, involves ram
pant speculation. It makes paranoia a
virtue and diverts consideration from
reality and the relationship of justice
to either peace or security. Is it not
strange that we allow this path to be
considered "tough and realistic"-.
while peace becomes an ever more
distant Utopian dream?
Thinking peace, on the other
hand, draws our attention to the
roots of war in institutionalized vio
lence, racism, economic oppression
and cultural chauvinism. It may be
that a serious exploration of peace
making will obviate war.
Global communications and
mobility have brought new political
unity to the world. At present, the
Cold War dominates world politics

while North-South economics domi
nate the interests of nations. There
are possibilities for a politics and eco
nomics of peace on a global scale.
World government may not be what
those who project an international
town meeting or legislature imagine,
but it may be possible to arrive at po
litical arrangements short of war.
One of the great experiences of an
international campus such as Stan
ford is the constant reminder that
what unites us with human beings
around the world is so very much
more profound than what divides us.
It also reminds us that we already live
in a political system which unites
Americans of great diversity. While
being American is important, and the
political system is important, com
munity in the world transcends these
loyalties.
The point of this reflection is sim
ply this: thinking and making peace
is the most realistic and profitable in
vestment we can make with our time
and talents.
The SCIRE Peace Studies Task
Force has produced a list of sug
gested courses for those who would
like to think and make peace. It hard
ly exhausts the possibilities either in
terms of which faculty members a P"
proach teaching with peace on their
minds or what subjects can be ex
plored by students dedicated to
peace study. Its only purpose is to
draw attention to that possibility. The
times call for action in the cause of
peace, and action calls for thought. If
school has become boring, don't
drop out. Drop in, study peace and
find a world of things to do with your
life.

town meeting or legislature imagine,
but it may be possible to arrive at po

One of the great experiences of an
international campus such as Stan
ford is the constant reminder that
what unites us with human beings
around the world is so very much
more profound than what divides us.
It also reminds us that we already live
in a political system which unites
Americans of great diversity. While
being American is important, and the
political system is important, com
munity in the world transcends these
loyalties.
The point of this reflection is sim
ply this: thinking and making peace
is the most realistic and profitable in
vestment we can make with our time
and talents.
The SCIRE Peace Studies Task
Force has produced a list of sug
gested courses for those who would
like to think and make peace. It hard
ly exhausts the possibilities either in
terms of which faculty members a P"
proach teaching with peace on their
minds or what subjects can be ex
plored by students dedicated to
peace study. Its only purpose is to
draw attention to that possibility. The
times call for action in the cause of
peace, and action calls for thought. If
school has become boring, don't
drop out. Drop in, study peace and
find a world of things to do with your
life.

Growing public sentiment against
nuclear weapons exposes the fun
damental flaws in our approach to
national defense and security. Our
bombs and missiles turn out to be no
less threatening to the survival of life
than theirs, and our preoccupation
with "strategic advantage" and "first
strike capacity" is no less paranoid
than the enemy we describe. Think
ing war does not build peace. In the
nuclear age we can neither afford not
to think nor fail to make peace.
In an earlier age it was possible to
relegate peace advocacy to the realm
of idealism, leaving realists to con
front the ugly fact of violence in the
world. Pacifists would be asked about
the morality of killing a Hitler or de
fending a loved one from attack. The
charge of "isolationism" was leveled
against those who saw the fun
damental absurdity of wars to end
wars as well as against those who be
lieved that there was work to be done
in our own house.
Political realists scorned the moral
istic avoidance of power as a central
concept in ethical thinking, and few
pacifists were able to respond.
During the Vietnam War political
realists of the stature of Reinhold
Niebuhr and Hans ivlorgenthau op
posed the war. Recently, Am
bassador George Kennan, author of
the containment policy against com
munism, has spoken out against nu
clear weaponry per se. Peace ad
vocacy today as always, contains a
measure of idealism inherent in our
ability to imagine and conceive of a
world of justice and peace. But it is
also a robust, practical analysis of the
political and biological realities in
herent in life itself which has made
peace advocacy reassert itself in
these desperate hours.
Memorial Church Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelly echoes the con
clusions of many non-Christians as
well when he insists that Christians
may not destroy the world even for
our own survival. There is no social,
political, religious, cultural or per
sonal value which can justify
"pushing the button." To do so
would be self-defeating, ideol
ogically and biologically.
The absurdity of "warring for
peace" is highlighted by the threat
our own missiles pose to us. Still, it is
no less present in the policies which,
produce Vietnams and El Salvadors.
The Cold War is the logical result of
thinking war even when such think
ing is motivated by a desire for peace.

Americans whose disappointment
that World War I had not eliminated
war led to a renewed appreciation of
evil were not ready to relax lest they
be "unprepared" in the future.
World War II caught us with our
guard down, they would argue.
"Never again," they vowed.
Soviets surveyed the devastation
wrought upon them by Germany,
adding to a long history of counter
revolutionary interventionism from
the West. Their iron grip on Eastern
Europe reflects the depth to which
that lesson of history was learned.
"Never again," they vow. The same
woeful story is repeated in Israel and
by the Palestinian Liberation Or
ganization as well as in Northern Ire
land, China and South Africa.
History has many lessons to teach
us, not the least of which is the futility
of militarism. But one of the factors in
our current dilemma is that the con
sequences of the current militarism
are unprecedented. War planning,
by its current nature, involves ram
pant speculation. It makes paranoia a
virtue and diverts consideration from
reality and the relationship of justice
to either peace or security. Is it not
strange that we allow this path to be
considered "tough and realistic"-.
while peace becomes an ever more
distant Utopian dream?
Thinking peace, on the other
hand, draws our attention to the
roots of war in institutionalized vio
lence, racism, economic oppression
and cultural chauvinism. It may be
that a serious exploration of peace
making will obviate war.
Global communications and
mobility have brought new political
unity to the world. At present, the
Cold War dominates world politics

while North-South economics domi
nate the interests of nations. There
are possibilities for a politics and eco
nomics of peace on a global scale.
