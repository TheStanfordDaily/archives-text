Indicators predict lingering recession
Washington — The government's index of leading economic in
dicators moved down in February for the tenth month in a row, signi
fying that the recession will linger into spring, the Department of Com
merce said yesterday.
The index fell by a moderate 0.3 percent, however, well below revised
figures showing a December decline of 0.8 percent and a January drop
of 1.2 percent in the general indicator of economic health.
"We certainly do not have the signs that the recession is over," said
Robert Ortner, chief economist for the department. "I think the econo
my will turn up in the next few months, but a sustainable, strong re
covery cannot occur with the (current) high level of interest rates."
"We're in the trough," agreed Secretary of the Treasury Donald Re
gan. "I think we'll emerge in the second quarter but the more interest
rates stay high, the less the chances of recovery."
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said the February figures
showed a "mixed picture" and did not preclude an early rebound in the
economy.
"The indicators have not turned up yet but when the index has begun
to increase in recent business cycles, the lead time before a general
business recovery has proven to be very short," Baldrige said J
Chairman Murray Weidenbaum of the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, however,
stuck by his contention that the recession al
ready has hit bottom. He said other economic
data were more persuasive, including a survey
of industrial purchasing agents that indicated a
resurgence of activity.
Donald Straszheim, vice president of
Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia, noted
that the February decline in the index was the
smallest since last July's 0.2 percent decrease
and did not change his forecast for a strong
pickup in the second half of the year.
In its announcement, the Department of
Commerce said it had the January index from
the originally reported decline of 0.6 percent to
show a plunge of 1.2 percent on the basis of
more complete information.
Continued strong inventory liquidation — a
bad sign for January but somewhat encouraging
for future months, since inventories eventually
must be restocked — was the major factor in the
revision.
Shuttle delay discourages fans
White Sands Missile Range, N.M. — The
space shuttle Columbia played to a near-empty
house here yesterday, after a windstorm the day
before put off its landing and sent spectators
scrambling for cover, disappointed and caked
with gypsum powder.
Of the 40,000 persons who showed up Mon
day in the public viewing area five miles north
ofthelandingsite,onlya hardy 6500 or so set up
camp again yesterday. Monday's bursts of wind
had crumpled several camper shells and sent a
dozen spectators to Army medics complaining
of sand in their eyes.
And of the 1200 VIPs and guests who barely
made it off the bus in Monday's sand flurries,
only about 800 returned to brave yesterday's
landing.
Those who did had learned from the dress re
hearsal in the gritty fog of sand. They showed up
yesterday looking like a crowd of skiers against
the white drifts, hiding behind goggles and
mufflers to keep the gypsum from their faces.
Most of that regalia, as it turned out, was nec
essary. The Columbia slipped in on its 129 th or
bit, just before another, though less severe, dust
storm whirled onto the site with gusts nearing
30 m.p.h.
Just six hours before landing, Army crews in
29 vehicles had finished up eight hours of mov
ing sand off both runways. They had had to
grade and pack the eroded sand on Runway 17
— at precisely the point where the Columbia s
nose wheel touched down yesterday.
The wind blew away the voices and whipped
the thinning hair of astronauts Jack Lousma and
Gordon Fullerton as they stood on a platform to

speak to the dwindling crowd about 90 minutes
after leaving the shuttle.
U.S. Sen. Harrison Schmitt, a former
astronaut, said both would receive souvenirs
hand-crafted bola ties with a design shaped like
New Mexico.
"It's great to be on the ground here at White
Sands — this is my first time, said Lousma, who
has made hundreds of approaches to the
Northrup Strip runways in shuttle mockups
but had never actually touched down before.
Doubts raised over Salvador
Washington — The Reagan administration,
atter a sobering second look at the results of
Sunday's election in El Salvador, yesterday
sought to prepare congressional and public
opinion tor the possibility that the United States
might have to work with a government domi
nated by the political right.
In response to questions about how such a
situation would affect future United States sup
port, administration officials said that whatever
government emerges should be judged not by
the parties or individuals it contains, but by its
commitment to political and social reform.
That was prompted by realization that the
combined for five rightist parties put them
in position to torm a coalition that could ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party of
Jose Napoleon Duarte, president of the outgo
ing Lnited States-backed, civilian-military jun
ta.
Of particular concern was fear that Roberto
D Aubuisson, a cashiered army officer whose
National Republican Alliance, known as
A, gained the second-highest vote, might
have major direct or behind-the-scenes in
fluence in the new government.
D'Aubuisson, who was described by former
U.S. ambassador Robert White as "a
pathological killer," has long been identified
with coup attempts, paramilitary terrorist ac
tivities and opposition to reform.
China objects to U.S. proposal
Peking — China objected strongly yesterday
to new American legislation aimed at equal

mainland China and Taiwan as creating "two
Chinas," further intensifying its current con

Taiwan.
In a formal diplomatic note to the United
States Embassy here, the Chinese Foreign Min
istry said that the legislation, in effect, not only
refused to reognize Taiwan as a Chinese prov
ince but treated it as a separate state.
The foreign ministry demanded that the Unit
ed States government "take prompt measures
to correct said mistake and guarantee against

the recurrence of similar incidents in the
future, the official New China News Agency
reported
Budget dialog suggested
Washington — Laxalt and Senate Finance
Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) have urged
President Ronald Reagan to at least inform fel
low Republicans which parts of his economic
program might be negotiable and which parts
he considers untouchable. But Reagan has re
mained silent.
One adviser who supports Reagan's silence is
Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Coun
cil of Economic Advisers in the Ford adminis
tration, v\ho said he expected Reagan to offer
no significant change in his budget. Any change
that is offered, he said, would come in last
minute negotiations.
"Compromise with whom or what?" Green
span said in reply to a reporter's question. "This
is not a seminar. It's more like the pulling and
hauling in a labor negotiation. If you start to uni
laterally alter your position, you probably suc
ceed in widening the gap between the parties.
So everyone is dancing around one another."
Some Republicans favor proceeding with the
budget process in Congress.
Since Republicans and Democrats generally
agree the budget as written has relatively little
support in Congress, a vote undoubtedly would
end in a rejection of the budget. But Rep. Jack
Kemp (R- N.Y.) said such a defeat would force
Democrats to propose an alternative budget
that could form a basis for compromise.
Ultimately, according to some administration
officials, Reagan will bow to reality and try to
achieve a compromise, although he will never
budge on his tax program or alter in any signifi
cant way his proposed 9 percent increase in de
fense spending.
Stocks change little
New York — The stock market was little
changed in a sluggish session yesterday as one
index of economic trends pointed downward
for the 10th consecutive month.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, com
ing off a 5.90 gain Monday, edged up .67 to
824.49.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange to
taled 43.90 million shares, up from Monday's
six-week low of 37.10 million.

Indicators predict lingering recession
Washington — The government's index of leading economic in
dicators moved down in February for the tenth month in a row, signi
fying that the recession will linger into spring, the Department of Com
merce said yesterday.
The index fell by a moderate 0.3 percent, however, well below revised
figures showing a December decline of 0.8 percent and a January drop
of 1.2 percent in the general indicator of economic health.
"We certainly do not have the signs that the recession is over," said
Robert Ortner, chief economist for the department. "I think the econo
my will turn up in the next few months, but a sustainable, strong re
covery cannot occur with the (current) high level of interest rates."
"We're in the trough," agreed Secretary of the Treasury Donald Re
gan. "I think we'll emerge in the second quarter but the more interest
rates stay high, the less the chances of recovery."
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said the February figures
showed a "mixed picture" and did not preclude an early rebound in the
economy.
"The indicators have not turned up yet but when the index has begun
to increase in recent business cycles, the lead time before a general
business recovery has proven to be very short," Baldrige said J
Chairman Murray Weidenbaum of the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, however,
stuck by his contention that the recession al
ready has hit bottom. He said other economic
data were more persuasive, including a survey
of industrial purchasing agents that indicated a
resurgence of activity.
Donald Straszheim, vice president of
Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia, noted
that the February decline in the index was the
smallest since last July's 0.2 percent decrease
and did not change his forecast for a strong
pickup in the second half of the year.
In its announcement, the Department of
Commerce said it had the January index from
the originally reported decline of 0.6 percent to
show a plunge of 1.2 percent on the basis of
more complete information.
Continued strong inventory liquidation — a
bad sign for January but somewhat encouraging
for future months, since inventories eventually
must be restocked — was the major factor in the
revision.
Shuttle delay discourages fans
White Sands Missile Range, N.M. — The
space shuttle Columbia played to a near-empty
house here yesterday, after a windstorm the day
before put off its landing and sent spectators
scrambling for cover, disappointed and caked
with gypsum powder.
Of the 40,000 persons who showed up Mon
day in the public viewing area five miles north
ofthelandingsite,onlya hardy 6500 or so set up
camp again yesterday. Monday's bursts of wind
had crumpled several camper shells and sent a
dozen spectators to Army medics complaining
of sand in their eyes.
And of the 1200 VIPs and guests who barely
made it off the bus in Monday's sand flurries,
only about 800 returned to brave yesterday's
landing.
Those who did had learned from the dress re
hearsal in the gritty fog of sand. They showed up
yesterday looking like a crowd of skiers against
the white drifts, hiding behind goggles and
mufflers to keep the gypsum from their faces.
Most of that regalia, as it turned out, was nec
essary. The Columbia slipped in on its 129 th or
bit, just before another, though less severe, dust
storm whirled onto the site with gusts nearing
30 m.p.h.
Just six hours before landing, Army crews in
29 vehicles had finished up eight hours of mov
ing sand off both runways. They had had to
grade and pack the eroded sand on Runway 17
— at precisely the point where the Columbia s
nose wheel touched down yesterday.
The wind blew away the voices and whipped
the thinning hair of astronauts Jack Lousma and
Gordon Fullerton as they stood on a platform to

speak to the dwindling crowd about 90 minutes
after leaving the shuttle.
U.S. Sen. Harrison Schmitt, a former
astronaut, said both would receive souvenirs
hand-crafted bola ties with a design shaped like
New Mexico.
"It's great to be on the ground here at White
Sands — this is my first time, said Lousma, who

Northrup Strip runways in shuttle mockups

Doubts raised over Salvador
Washington — The Reagan administration,
atter a sobering second look at the results of
Sunday's election in El Salvador, yesterday
sought to prepare congressional and public
opinion tor the possibility that the United States
might have to work with a government domi
nated by the political right.
In response to questions about how such a
situation would affect future United States sup
port, administration officials said that whatever
government emerges should be judged not by
the parties or individuals it contains, but by its
commitment to political and social reform.
That was prompted by realization that the
combined for five rightist parties put them
in position to torm a coalition that could ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party of
Jose Napoleon Duarte, president of the outgo
ing Lnited States-backed, civilian-military jun
ta.
Of particular concern was fear that Roberto
D Aubuisson, a cashiered army officer whose
National Republican Alliance, known as
A, gained the second-highest vote, might
have major direct or behind-the-scenes in
fluence in the new government.
D'Aubuisson, who was described by former
U.S. ambassador Robert White as "a
pathological killer," has long been identified
with coup attempts, paramilitary terrorist ac
tivities and opposition to reform.
China objects to U.S. proposal
Peking — China objected strongly yesterday
to new American legislation aimed at equal
izing emigration to the United States from
mainland China and Taiwan as creating "two
Chinas," further intensifying its current con
frontation with Washington over relations with
Taiwan.
In a formal diplomatic note to the United
States Embassy here, the Chinese Foreign Min
istry said that the legislation, in effect, not only
refused to reognize Taiwan as a Chinese prov
ince but treated it as a separate state.
The foreign ministry demanded that the Unit
ed States government "take prompt measures
to correct said mistake and guarantee against

the recurrence of similar incidents in the
future, the official New China News Agency
reported

Doubts raised over Salvador
Washington — The Reagan administration,
atter a sobering second look at the results of
Sunday's election in El Salvador, yesterday
sought to prepare congressional and public
opinion tor the possibility that the United States
might have to work with a government domi
nated by the political right.
In response to questions about how such a
situation would affect future United States sup
port, administration officials said that whatever
government emerges should be judged not by
the parties or individuals it contains, but by its
commitment to political and social reform.
That was prompted by realization that the
combined for five rightist parties put them
in position to torm a coalition that could ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party of
Jose Napoleon Duarte, president of the outgo
ing Lnited States-backed, civilian-military jun
ta.
Of particular concern was fear that Roberto
D Aubuisson, a cashiered army officer whose
National Republican Alliance, known as
A, gained the second-highest vote, might
have major direct or behind-the-scenes in
fluence in the new government.
D'Aubuisson, who was described by former
U.S. ambassador Robert White as "a
pathological killer," has long been identified
with coup attempts, paramilitary terrorist ac
tivities and opposition to reform.
China objects to U.S. proposal
Peking — China objected strongly yesterday
to new American legislation aimed at equal
izing emigration to the United States from
mainland China and Taiwan as creating "two
Chinas," further intensifying its current con
frontation with Washington over relations with
Taiwan.
In a formal diplomatic note to the United
States Embassy here, the Chinese Foreign Min
istry said that the legislation, in effect, not only
refused to reognize Taiwan as a Chinese prov
ince but treated it as a separate state.
The foreign ministry demanded that the Unit
ed States government "take prompt measures
to correct said mistake and guarantee against

the recurrence of similar incidents in the
future, the official New China News Agency
reported
Budget dialog suggested
Washington — Laxalt and Senate Finance
Chairman Robert Dole (R-Kan.) have urged
President Ronald Reagan to at least inform fel
low Republicans which parts of his economic
program might be negotiable and which parts
he considers untouchable. But Reagan has re
mained silent.
One adviser who supports Reagan's silence is
Alan Greenspan, former chairman of the Coun
cil of Economic Advisers in the Ford adminis
tration, v\ho said he expected Reagan to offer
no significant change in his budget. Any change
that is offered, he said, would come in last
minute negotiations.
"Compromise with whom or what?" Green
span said in reply to a reporter's question. "This
is not a seminar. It's more like the pulling and
hauling in a labor negotiation. If you start to uni
laterally alter your position, you probably suc
ceed in widening the gap between the parties.
So everyone is dancing around one another."
Some Republicans favor proceeding with the
budget process in Congress.
Since Republicans and Democrats generally
agree the budget as written has relatively little
support in Congress, a vote undoubtedly would
end in a rejection of the budget. But Rep. Jack
Kemp (R- N.Y.) said such a defeat would force
Democrats to propose an alternative budget
that could form a basis for compromise.
Ultimately, according to some administration
officials, Reagan will bow to reality and try to
achieve a compromise, although he will never
budge on his tax program or alter in any signifi
cant way his proposed 9 percent increase in de
fense spending.

Indicators predict lingering recession
Washington — The government's index of leading economic in
dicators moved down in February for the tenth month in a row, signi
fying that the recession will linger into spring, the Department of Com
merce said yesterday.
The index fell by a moderate 0.3 percent, however, well below revised
figures showing a December decline of 0.8 percent and a January drop
of 1.2 percent in the general indicator of economic health.
"We certainly do not have the signs that the recession is over," said
Robert Ortner, chief economist for the department. "I think the econo
my will turn up in the next few months, but a sustainable, strong re
covery cannot occur with the (current) high level of interest rates."
"We're in the trough," agreed Secretary of the Treasury Donald Re
gan. "I think we'll emerge in the second quarter but the more interest
rates stay high, the less the chances of recovery."
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said the February figures
showed a "mixed picture" and did not preclude an early rebound in the
economy.
"The indicators have not turned up yet but when the index has begun
to increase in recent business cycles, the lead time before a general
business recovery has proven to be very short," Baldrige said J
Chairman Murray Weidenbaum of the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Advisers, however,
stuck by his contention that the recession al
ready has hit bottom. He said other economic
data were more persuasive, including a survey
of industrial purchasing agents that indicated a
resurgence of activity.
Donald Straszheim, vice president of
Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia, noted
that the February decline in the index was the
smallest since last July's 0.2 percent decrease
and did not change his forecast for a strong
pickup in the second half of the year.
In its announcement, the Department of
Commerce said it had the January index from
the originally reported decline of 0.6 percent to
show a plunge of 1.2 percent on the basis of
more complete information.
Continued strong inventory liquidation — a
bad sign for January but somewhat encouraging
for future months, since inventories eventually
must be restocked — was the major factor in the
revision.
Shuttle delay discourages fans
White Sands Missile Range, N.M. — The
space shuttle Columbia played to a near-empty
house here yesterday, after a windstorm the day
before put off its landing and sent spectators
scrambling for cover, disappointed and caked
with gypsum powder.
Of the 40,000 persons who showed up Mon
day in the public viewing area five miles north
ofthelandingsite,onlya hardy 6500 or so set up
camp again yesterday. Monday's bursts of wind
had crumpled several camper shells and sent a
dozen spectators to Army medics complaining
of sand in their eyes.
And of the 1200 VIPs and guests who barely
made it off the bus in Monday's sand flurries,
only about 800 returned to brave yesterday's
landing.
Those who did had learned from the dress re
hearsal in the gritty fog of sand. They showed up
yesterday looking like a crowd of skiers against
the white drifts, hiding behind goggles and
mufflers to keep the gypsum from their faces.
Most of that regalia, as it turned out, was nec
essary. The Columbia slipped in on its 129 th or
bit, just before another, though less severe, dust
storm whirled onto the site with gusts nearing
30 m.p.h.
Just six hours before landing, Army crews in
29 vehicles had finished up eight hours of mov
ing sand off both runways. They had had to
grade and pack the eroded sand on Runway 17
— at precisely the point where the Columbia s
nose wheel touched down yesterday.
The wind blew away the voices and whipped
the thinning hair of astronauts Jack Lousma and
Gordon Fullerton as they stood on a platform to

speak to the dwindling crowd about 90 minutes
after leaving the shuttle.
U.S. Sen. Harrison Schmitt, a former
astronaut, said both would receive souvenirs
hand-crafted bola ties with a design shaped like
New Mexico.
"It's great to be on the ground here at White
Sands — this is my first time, said Lousma, who
has made hundreds of approaches to the
Northrup Strip runways in shuttle mockups
but had never actually touched down before.
