The good life
If your four-digit draw number this
spring dooms you to meals of Monterey
casserole and peanut butter and jelly for
the fourth year in a row, you may want to
consider transferring to Eastern Illinois
University where students will have the
option of living in the Charlston Holiday
Inn. According to the Daily Eastern News,
housing Director Lou Hencken said the
university has made arrangements to
lease a portion of the motel to allow 80
more freshmen and transfer students to
attend the university. Hencken said stu
dents who live there fall semester will be
guaranteed a space in on-campus resi
dences for spring semester or, if the pro
gram is successful, the university has an
option to extend the lease for spring se
mester.
Hencken said that although the ac
comodations will be under the same reg
ulations as the residence halls, including
insurance policies, supervision and social
activities, students opting to live there will
have the added luxuries of private baths
and weekly maid service. He said students
will be charged a semester rate of $450 to
$455, including utilities (current on-cam
pus residence rates are $885 per semes
ter), and will be housed in one-room
doubles 12 feet by 16 feet containing two
double-beds, two dressers, two chairs, a
table and a desk.
Holiday Inn General Manager Steve
French said charges for identical rooms
for motel patrons run $30 per night.
French said the maid service will include
supplying and changing bed linens,
cleaning the bathrooms and vacuuming
the carpets. Other amenities include
private telephones, mail service, and ac
cess to a swimming pool and softball field.
A meeting room which holds 350 will also
be available to students for movies,
dances, committee meetings and other
social activities. The motel is within biking
distance from campus and students have
the option of buying a meal ticket for use
in any of the on-campus residences. The
ratio of men to women at the motel will
be one to one, said Hencken.
Although the arrangement is pending

approval of Eastern's Board of Governors,
Hencken said, "It's 99 percent sure right
now." Bah Humbugl

Senior blues
The Daily Pennsylvanian from the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania defines senioritis
as 1) an affliction peculiar to students in
final year of study; effects visual senses —
inability to focus on classes — and motor
control, i.e. staggering home from bars,
etc. 2) also name for more serious malady
in which depression or anxiety over
future may occur. Feature writer Jim Mc-
Cracken writes, "Despite its omission
from any medical textbook or simple dic
tionary, senioritis has or will hit almost ev
ery member of the Class of 1982 this se
mester." He says that the affliction is a
"dual-edged sword" in its effect because,
"on the one hand, there is the popular
notion of second semester senior year as
being something of a five-month play pe
riod in which importance of academics
wanes and the emphasis shifts to having
one last good time. On the other hand,
there is the uncertainty of what lies
ahead. Concern over what will happen af
ter graduation can put a damper on the
fun and, in fact, may lead to periods of de
pression or anxiety."
According to Samuel Fager, student
health director at the University of Penn
sylvania, "every senior is going»to go
through some transition period." He said
the students who are depressed or anx
ious may fit into a number of categories:
• Students who have had such a good
time in school that they become de
pressed over leaving, believing that the
end of college means the end of fun.
• Students who feel opportunities for
fun have passed them by and that they
have missed out on good times.
• Those who feel that they will lose their
friends when they leave school.

• Those who feel they have majored in
the wrong subject or made another major
academic mistake, and those whose
future plans are uncertain.
Fager said the mildest form of senioritis
is brief periods of uneasiness and that
"the worst that can happen is a lack of
functioning" causing withdrawal from
schoolwork and friends. Fager said, how
ever, that he has "rarely heard of people
who deliberately flunk out or cut off all
relationships with people. Most people
are able to cope," he said. "It's pretty un
common for it to be that drastic."
Senior £llen Gluck, a biology major,
said, "For the last 15 years, I've known
what I would be doing the next year —
going to school. Now I don't." However,
Gluck said she feels that "after four years
of college, it's time to move on. It's not
the end of life. There's a lot more than col
lege." Gluck said she admitted to having
"pangs of fear" when she thinks about
the future, but said that most of the ef
fects of senioritis will fade when she
knows what she is doing next year.
Fager gave some suggestions for coping
with senioritis: "Just realize that everyone
in the senior class will go through periods
of time like this ... you should talk with
your friends about it... just because col
lege is over doesn't mean that every has to
be decided. Your first job doesn't de
termine what you're going to be doing
your whole life. College just gives you
new opportunities." (Who was it who said
there is no heavier burden than a great
opportunity? A billboard in Palm
Springs?)
McCracken reports that according to
experts, as the future becomes somewhat
clear, the depression and anxiety will lift
and seniors will become overwhelmingly
concerned with that one last good time.
Fager said, "That usually happens when
there's about a month and a half left."
Counting backward from June 13, that

Driving it home
If you're planning to have a bonfire to
burn all the parking tickets you've ac
cumulated, you should pay the tickets in
stead and count your blessings you didn't
end up like the owner of a Volkswagen
photographed in The Harvard Crimson.
The "Denver Boot" made its first ap
pearance in Cambridge this month as of
ficials from the city's traffic department
travelled around locking up the wheels of
cars parked illegally with a steel boot. In
addition to paying overdue parking fines,
owners must pay $25 to release their vehi
cles. The "Denver Boot" has made park
ing violations no laughing matter.

Question: What is more disruptive to
the academic process than streaking
through the library during Dead Week?
Answer: Taking books from the library,
thereby preventing access to them for
purposes of research by other students.
The Daily Princetonian reports that po
lice are pressing charges against a former
Princton graduate student at whose home
more than 2000 missing library books
were discovered early this month. Thom
as Freeman, who voluntarily surrendered
the books and who refused to comment,
was charged with theft of property valued
at more than $500. Two Princeton history
professors and a proctor went to Free
man's house because it had been found
that books recently missed by graduate
students from Firestone Library were in
Freeman's field of interest. One of the
professors noted that the missing books
seemed to have been taken system
atically, making it almost impossible for
serious research in medieval history to be
done in Firestone Library. The investiga
tion began when graduate students of the
two professors could not do their as
signed reading in the library. The com
puter lists in the library showed the books
had not been checked out. Approximate

ly 900 of the books found belonged to the
university, freeman, who attended
Princeton last year, has been released
pending a court appearance.

Right to access
Stanford's not the only university deal
ing with the issue of public access to re
search documents. The Michigan Daily
reports that university administrators
there are considering a proposal to pro
tect faculty member's exclusive control of
marketable innovations by restricting
public access to parts of research docu
ments. James Lesch, director of the uni
versity's Division of Research Develop
ment and Administration, said the pro
posal would allow researchers to mark as
confidential sections of research that in
clude "trade secrets, business data, or
technical and scientific data" of a pro
prietary nature. He said the issue was
raised after students obtain copies of pro
posals the Defense Department had ac
cepted after sponsoring projects.
Jon Feiger, Michigan Student Assembly
president said that a restriction policy
could be "open to wide abuse." Lesch
said although the release of Defense De
partment related materials was the im
petus for the new policy, the proposal was
designed to protect patentable material
which could benefit individuals or uni
versities financially. He said that informa
tion pertaining to the purpose and scope
of every project would remain public and
estimated that the policy might be ap
plicable to between five and 10 percent of
research proposals. "You can't mark any
thing willy-nilly. You will have to be able
to provide justification for it." If Feiger
has his way, however, Lesch may be the
one doing to the justifying.

Senior blues
The Daily Pennsylvanian from the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania defines senioritis
as 1) an affliction peculiar to students in
final year of study; effects visual senses —
inability to focus on classes — and motor
control, i.e. staggering home from bars,
etc. 2) also name for more serious malady
in which depression or anxiety over
future may occur. Feature writer Jim Mc-
Cracken writes, "Despite its omission
from any medical textbook or simple dic
tionary, senioritis has or will hit almost ev
ery member of the Class of 1982 this se
mester." He says that the affliction is a
"dual-edged sword" in its effect because,
"on the one hand, there is the popular
notion of second semester senior year as
being something of a five-month play pe
riod in which importance of academics
wanes and the emphasis shifts to having
one last good time. On the other hand,
there is the uncertainty of what lies
ahead. Concern over what will happen af
ter graduation can put a damper on the
fun and, in fact, may lead to periods of de
pression or anxiety."
According to Samuel Fager, student
health director at the University of Penn
sylvania, "every senior is going»to go
through some transition period." He said
the students who are depressed or anx
ious may fit into a number of categories:
• Students who have had such a good
time in school that they become de
pressed over leaving, believing that the
end of college means the end of fun.
• Students who feel opportunities for
fun have passed them by and that they
have missed out on good times.
• Those who feel that they will lose their
friends when they leave school.

• Those who feel they have majored in
the wrong subject or made another major
academic mistake, and those whose
future plans are uncertain.
Fager said the mildest form of senioritis
is brief periods of uneasiness and that
"the worst that can happen is a lack of
functioning" causing withdrawal from
schoolwork and friends. Fager said, how
ever, that he has "rarely heard of people
who deliberately flunk out or cut off all
relationships with people. Most people
are able to cope," he said. "It's pretty un
common for it to be that drastic."
Senior £llen Gluck, a biology major,
said, "For the last 15 years, I've known
what I would be doing the next year —
going to school. Now I don't." However,
Gluck said she feels that "after four years
of college, it's time to move on. It's not
the end of life. There's a lot more than col
lege." Gluck said she admitted to having
"pangs of fear" when she thinks about
the future, but said that most of the ef
fects of senioritis will fade when she
knows what she is doing next year.
Fager gave some suggestions for coping
with senioritis: "Just realize that everyone
in the senior class will go through periods
of time like this ... you should talk with
your friends about it... just because col
lege is over doesn't mean that every has to
be decided. Your first job doesn't de
termine what you're going to be doing
your whole life. College just gives you
new opportunities." (Who was it who said
there is no heavier burden than a great
opportunity? A billboard in Palm
Springs?)
McCracken reports that according to
experts, as the future becomes somewhat
clear, the depression and anxiety will lift
and seniors will become overwhelmingly
concerned with that one last good time.
Fager said, "That usually happens when
there's about a month and a half left."

Question: What is more disruptive to
the academic process than streaking
through the library during Dead Week?
Answer: Taking books from the library,
thereby preventing access to them for
purposes of research by other students.
The Daily Princetonian reports that po
lice are pressing charges against a former
Princton graduate student at whose home
more than 2000 missing library books
were discovered early this month. Thom
as Freeman, who voluntarily surrendered
the books and who refused to comment,
was charged with theft of property valued
at more than $500. Two Princeton history
professors and a proctor went to Free
man's house because it had been found
that books recently missed by graduate
students from Firestone Library were in
Freeman's field of interest. One of the
professors noted that the missing books
seemed to have been taken system
atically, making it almost impossible for
serious research in medieval history to be
done in Firestone Library. The investiga
tion began when graduate students of the
two professors could not do their as
signed reading in the library. The com
puter lists in the library showed the books
had not been checked out. Approximate

ly 900 of the books found belonged to the
university, freeman, who attended
Princeton last year, has been released
pending a court appearance.

Right to access
Stanford's not the only university deal
ing with the issue of public access to re
search documents. The Michigan Daily
reports that university administrators
there are considering a proposal to pro
tect faculty member's exclusive control of
marketable innovations by restricting
public access to parts of research docu
ments. James Lesch, director of the uni
versity's Division of Research Develop
ment and Administration, said the pro
posal would allow researchers to mark as
confidential sections of research that in
clude "trade secrets, business data, or
technical and scientific data" of a pro
prietary nature. He said the issue was
raised after students obtain copies of pro
posals the Defense Department had ac
cepted after sponsoring projects.
Jon Feiger, Michigan Student Assembly
president said that a restriction policy
could be "open to wide abuse." Lesch
said although the release of Defense De
partment related materials was the im
petus for the new policy, the proposal was
designed to protect patentable material
which could benefit individuals or uni
versities financially. He said that informa
tion pertaining to the purpose and scope
of every project would remain public and
estimated that the policy might be ap
plicable to between five and 10 percent of
research proposals. "You can't mark any
thing willy-nilly. You will have to be able
to provide justification for it." If Feiger
has his way, however, Lesch may be the
one doing to the justifying.

The good life
If your four-digit draw number this
spring dooms you to meals of Monterey
casserole and peanut butter and jelly for
the fourth year in a row, you may want to
consider transferring to Eastern Illinois
University where students will have the
option of living in the Charlston Holiday
Inn. According to the Daily Eastern News,
housing Director Lou Hencken said the
university has made arrangements to
lease a portion of the motel to allow 80
more freshmen and transfer students to
attend the university. Hencken said stu
dents who live there fall semester will be
guaranteed a space in on-campus resi
dences for spring semester or, if the pro
gram is successful, the university has an
option to extend the lease for spring se
mester.
Hencken said that although the ac
comodations will be under the same reg
ulations as the residence halls, including
insurance policies, supervision and social
activities, students opting to live there will
have the added luxuries of private baths
and weekly maid service. He said students
will be charged a semester rate of $450 to
$455, including utilities (current on-cam
pus residence rates are $885 per semes
ter), and will be housed in one-room
doubles 12 feet by 16 feet containing two
double-beds, two dressers, two chairs, a
table and a desk.
Holiday Inn General Manager Steve
French said charges for identical rooms
for motel patrons run $30 per night.
French said the maid service will include
supplying and changing bed linens,
cleaning the bathrooms and vacuuming
the carpets. Other amenities include
private telephones, mail service, and ac
cess to a swimming pool and softball field.
A meeting room which holds 350 will also
be available to students for movies,
dances, committee meetings and other
social activities. The motel is within biking

the students who are depressed or anx
ious may fit into a number of categories:
• Students who have had such a good
time in school that they become de
pressed over leaving, believing that the
end of college means the end of fun.
• Students who feel opportunities for
fun have passed them by and that they
have missed out on good times.
• Those who feel that they will lose their
friends when they leave school.

• Those who feel they have majored in
the wrong subject or made another major
academic mistake, and those whose
future plans are uncertain.
Fager said the mildest form of senioritis
is brief periods of uneasiness and that
"the worst that can happen is a lack of
functioning" causing withdrawal from
schoolwork and friends. Fager said, how
ever, that he has "rarely heard of people
who deliberately flunk out or cut off all
relationships with people. Most people
are able to cope," he said. "It's pretty un
common for it to be that drastic."
Senior £llen Gluck, a biology major,
said, "For the last 15 years, I've known
what I would be doing the next year —
going to school. Now I don't." However,
Gluck said she feels that "after four years
of college, it's time to move on. It's not
the end of life. There's a lot more than col
lege." Gluck said she admitted to having
"pangs of fear" when she thinks about
the future, but said that most of the ef
fects of senioritis will fade when she
knows what she is doing next year.
Fager gave some suggestions for coping
with senioritis: "Just realize that everyone
in the senior class will go through periods
of time like this ... you should talk with
your friends about it... just because col
lege is over doesn't mean that every has to
be decided. Your first job doesn't de
termine what you're going to be doing
your whole life. College just gives you
new opportunities." (Who was it who said
there is no heavier burden than a great
opportunity? A billboard in Palm
Springs?)
McCracken reports that according to
experts, as the future becomes somewhat
clear, the depression and anxiety will lift
and seniors will become overwhelmingly
concerned with that one last good time.
Fager said, "That usually happens when
there's about a month and a half left."

If you're planning to have a bonfire to
burn all the parking tickets you've ac
cumulated, you should pay the tickets in
stead and count your blessings you didn't
end up like the owner of a Volkswagen
photographed in The Harvard Crimson.
The "Denver Boot" made its first ap
pearance in Cambridge this month as of
ficials from the city's traffic department
travelled around locking up the wheels of
cars parked illegally with a steel boot. In
addition to paying overdue parking fines,
owners must pay $25 to release their vehi

Question: What is more disruptive to
the academic process than streaking
through the library during Dead Week?
Answer: Taking books from the library,
thereby preventing access to them for
purposes of research by other students.
The Daily Princetonian reports that po
lice are pressing charges against a former
Princton graduate student at whose home
more than 2000 missing library books
were discovered early this month. Thom
as Freeman, who voluntarily surrendered
the books and who refused to comment,
was charged with theft of property valued
at more than $500. Two Princeton history
professors and a proctor went to Free
man's house because it had been found
that books recently missed by graduate
students from Firestone Library were in
Freeman's field of interest. One of the
professors noted that the missing books
seemed to have been taken system
atically, making it almost impossible for
serious research in medieval history to be
done in Firestone Library. The investiga
tion began when graduate students of the
two professors could not do their as
signed reading in the library. The com
puter lists in the library showed the books
had not been checked out. Approximate

ly 900 of the books found belonged to the
university, freeman, who attended
Princeton last year, has been released
pending a court appearance.

Right to access
Stanford's not the only university deal
ing with the issue of public access to re
search documents. The Michigan Daily
reports that university administrators
there are considering a proposal to pro
tect faculty member's exclusive control of
marketable innovations by restricting
public access to parts of research docu
ments. James Lesch, director of the uni
versity's Division of Research Develop
ment and Administration, said the pro
posal would allow researchers to mark as
confidential sections of research that in
clude "trade secrets, business data, or
technical and scientific data" of a pro
prietary nature. He said the issue was
raised after students obtain copies of pro
posals the Defense Department had ac
cepted after sponsoring projects.
Jon Feiger, Michigan Student Assembly
president said that a restriction policy
could be "open to wide abuse." Lesch
said although the release of Defense De
partment related materials was the im
petus for the new policy, the proposal was
designed to protect patentable material
which could benefit individuals or uni
versities financially. He said that informa
tion pertaining to the purpose and scope
of every project would remain public and
estimated that the policy might be ap
plicable to between five and 10 percent of
research proposals. "You can't mark any
thing willy-nilly. You will have to be able
to provide justification for it." If Feiger
has his way, however, Lesch may be the
one doing to the justifying.

The good life
If your four-digit draw number this
spring dooms you to meals of Monterey
casserole and peanut butter and jelly for
the fourth year in a row, you may want to
consider transferring to Eastern Illinois
University where students will have the
option of living in the Charlston Holiday
Inn. According to the Daily Eastern News,
housing Director Lou Hencken said the
university has made arrangements to
lease a portion of the motel to allow 80
more freshmen and transfer students to
attend the university. Hencken said stu
dents who live there fall semester will be
guaranteed a space in on-campus resi
dences for spring semester or, if the pro
gram is successful, the university has an
option to extend the lease for spring se
mester.
Hencken said that although the ac
comodations will be under the same reg
ulations as the residence halls, including
insurance policies, supervision and social
activities, students opting to live there will
have the added luxuries of private baths
and weekly maid service. He said students
will be charged a semester rate of $450 to
$455, including utilities (current on-cam
pus residence rates are $885 per semes
ter), and will be housed in one-room
doubles 12 feet by 16 feet containing two
double-beds, two dressers, two chairs, a
table and a desk.
Holiday Inn General Manager Steve
French said charges for identical rooms
for motel patrons run $30 per night.
French said the maid service will include
supplying and changing bed linens,
cleaning the bathrooms and vacuuming
the carpets. Other amenities include
private telephones, mail service, and ac
cess to a swimming pool and softball field.
A meeting room which holds 350 will also
be available to students for movies,
dances, committee meetings and other
social activities. The motel is within biking
distance from campus and students have
the option of buying a meal ticket for use
in any of the on-campus residences. The
ratio of men to women at the motel will
be one to one, said Hencken.
Although the arrangement is pending

approval of Eastern's Board of Governors,
Hencken said, "It's 99 percent sure right
now." Bah Humbugl

Senior blues
The Daily Pennsylvanian from the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania defines senioritis
as 1) an affliction peculiar to students in
final year of study; effects visual senses —
inability to focus on classes — and motor
control, i.e. staggering home from bars,
etc. 2) also name for more serious malady
in which depression or anxiety over
future may occur. Feature writer Jim Mc-
Cracken writes, "Despite its omission
from any medical textbook or simple dic
tionary, senioritis has or will hit almost ev
ery member of the Class of 1982 this se
mester." He says that the affliction is a
"dual-edged sword" in its effect because,
"on the one hand, there is the popular
notion of second semester senior year as
being something of a five-month play pe
riod in which importance of academics
wanes and the emphasis shifts to having
one last good time. On the other hand,
there is the uncertainty of what lies
ahead. Concern over what will happen af
ter graduation can put a damper on the
fun and, in fact, may lead to periods of de
pression or anxiety."
