## It's official; Davis inks to coach at Stanford 
### Sid Spaeth 
Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger officially an
nounced yesterday that Tom
Davis will become the new
Cardinal head basketball
coach, only two weeks before
the signing deadline for re
cruits.
Davis has until April 14 to
conclude the recruiting proc
ess that was started by former
coach Dick Dißiaso and the
Stanford Athletic Department.
"My first thrust will be to do
something with recruiting,"
Davis said at a 3 p.m. press con
ference yesterday."I will
spend most of tonight and
tomorrow calling the recruits
Stanford has been in contact
with and some from other
sources to see who is avail
able."
Davis, who left Boston Col
lege after taking the Eagles to
the quarterfinals of the NCAA
Tournament this season, said
he will not try to lure any of his
Boston College recruits over to
Stanford. .
Davis said he will concen
trate on finding good assistant
coaches.
"I have to have a good staff,"
he said. "My assistants will be

very important to me. I have an
obligation to my assistants at
Boston College first. If they de
cide to leave Boston College, I
would like them to come here
— not only out of obligation,
but because they are very fine
coaches. If they decide to stay
or some other offer comes up,
the positions are wide open."
Boston College came into
the national spotlight this sea
son when they upset San Fran
cisco and DePaul and beat Kan
sas State in the Midwest Re
gional of the NCAA Tour
nament.
Davis, who was named Big
East Conference Coach of the
Year in 1981, said he left the
successful Boston College pro
gram because of the challenge
and opportunity at Stanford.
Davis will reportedly earn
more than $100,000 a year in
salary, basketball camps and
athletic shoe endorsements at
Stanford. Neither Geiger nor
Davis would comment on the
contract, but Geiger admitted
it is for more than one year.
"I found the whole idea ex
citing," Davis said. "I felt at this
point in my career a change
may be good. I feel it is a
unique challenge to recruit the,

best student-athlete or best
combination of student-ath
letes. There is a greater number
of highly-motivated young
men today who are both out
standing students and outstan
ding athletes. It may bedifficult
to locate all of them, but
they're out there and we in
tend to find them.
Davis, who has a Masters
degree from the University of
Wisconsin and a Phd from the
University of Maryland, said he
liked the academic climate of
Stanford and"the other
climate is not so bad either."
Davis met with Stanford
players early yesterday after
noon and explained his philos
ophy. Davis's teams are known
for their hustle and defense
and he plans to implement a
radically different system at
Stanford.
"First of all, we will run the
fast break," Davis explained. "I
enjoy the fast break and we will
run it regardless of our speed.
The speed of the team will de
termine how succesfully we
run it, but we will use it regard
less of our speed.
"Secondly, we will run a pa
tient offense and, thirdly, we

will provide him with.
will use a pressure defense. In
my system, I use more players
and need to substitute more
often. I would like to add a few
players this recruiting season
because with an aggressive,
fast-breaking style of play you
need a few more players and
not just five or six."
Davis, who attempted to re
cruit center John Revelli while
at Boston College, said he has
"very, very high regard for
John." Davis said he knows lit
tle about the rest of the players,
but prefers to let them show
their ability on the court and
not to make judgments
before-hand.
Davis said he has no time
table for bringing Stanford into
Pacific-10 contention, but will
work on "being as strong as we
possibly can.
"I don't like to set too many
goals for my players," he said.
"I just want them to know what
I'm looking for and we can
work on moving up the Pac-10
ladder."
