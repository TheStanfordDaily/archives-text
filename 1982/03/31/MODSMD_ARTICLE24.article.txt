# Confidently approaches Stanford job
## New basketball coach promises fast break 
### Sid Spaeth 
There was a smile from
ear to Athletic Department
ear yesterday as Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger an
nounced the signing of Bos
ton College coach Tom
Davis to be the new skipper
at Stanford. Davis made a
name for himself in the Big
East Conference by winning
conference coach of the
year honors last year, taking
the Eagles to the NCAA's
two years in a row and
reaching the quarterfinals
of the NCAA Tournament
this season.
• • •
Why did Davis leave Bos
ton College after doing such
a remarkable job?
1) More money perhaps.
Davis made about $45,000 a
year, excluding basketball
camp income, at Boston
College. Here, he will more
than double that.

2) He said a change might
do some good for his pro
fessional career. Stanford
and Wisconsin were his two
biggest bidders. Aren't you
flattered he chose us?
3) He likes culture and
golf. The Boston Pops didn't
quite make the grade, but
the Stanford Golf Course
did.
4)Two Boston schools —
Boston College and North
eastern — made the NCAA's
this year, but the toughest
ticket in collegetown was
still the Boston College
hockey team. Hopefully,
Stanford's new fast-paced
game will boost the anemic
gate at Maples Pavillion.
• • •
It's too bad the Athletic
Department didn't wait un
til next year before unveil
ing their basketball slogan,
"It's a new day on the
Farm." Davis (that's Dr.

Thomas R. Davis) promises
to use the fast break and
pressure defense regardless
of how fast Stanford is next
year.

Sporting Muse

"Speed only determines
how effectively you will run
it,"he said.
Davis said he will also use
a patient offense when the
break doesn't come off and
a pressure defense. Now
that is a new day on the
Farm.

In the NCAA Tournament
Boston College made three
appearances on TV. Davis
led the Eagles to dramatic
upset wins over San Francis
co and DePaul and a big win
over Kansas State.
The Eagles won by hard
work and hustle. They could
claim only one legitimate

star — guard John Bagley.
Bagley's physique was partly
an optical illusion, partly
not. At 5-11, he weighs 205
pounds, but is still the con
summate college guard. His
problems began when he
decided to wear No. 54 in
stead of a low, sleek, guard
type number, and a pair of
godzilla trunks. When
standing, he looked fat —
just plain fat. In action, he
moved like ice.
The rest of the team con
sisted of forward Rich "nev
er shoot" Shrigley, wanted
by the Seattle Seahawks as a
tight end next year, tiny
guard Michael Adams who
had to box for his rights to
his own lunch in junior
high, forward Martin Clark
from Folkstone, England
and back-up center Ron
Crevier — a 7-footer from
Canada. Oh yes, Davis
himself has a PHD in sports

history. Not an intimidating
bunch, but DePaul coach
Ray Meyer knew he was
beat before his 800 Demons
ever hit the floor against
Boston college.
• • •
Up until recently, the
most famous Boston Col
lege basketball player was
Rick Kuhn. Kuhn was con
victed on felony charges a
couple of years back for
shaving points while playing
for Boston College. No
more of that; Davis had the
gutsiest team in the tour
nament. The Eagles worked
the floor from end to end
and their gritty hustle gave
nothing away. Davis's teams
are known for their scrappi
ness on the floor — both lit
erally and figuratively.
Davis instills into his
teams the kind of intensity
that Kimberly Belton
showed on his face and

Doug Marty showed in his
game. He is the kind of
coach a John Revelli and a
Steve Brown can benefit
from and a Doug Marty
missed.
• • •
Revelli is the only
Cardinal that Davis knows
much about. Davis tried to
recruit Revelli to Boston
College two years ago. "I
have very, very high regard
for John Revelli," Davissaid.
Davis does not want to make
judgements on the other
players until they have been
able "to prove themselves
on the court."
So far, Davis has been im
pressed with Stanford. "The
thing that impresses me
most about Stanford is that
people care," Davis said.
"They want academic ex
cellence and fine athletic
teams. I'm hoping I can
make a difference."

moved like ice.
The rest of the team con
sisted of forward Rich "nev
er shoot" Shrigley, wanted
by the Seattle Seahawks as a
tight end next year, tiny
guard Michael Adams who
had to box for his rights to
his own lunch in junior
high, forward Martin Clark
from Folkstone, England
and back-up center Ron
Crevier — a 7-footer from
Canada. Oh yes, Davis
himself has a PHD in sports

history. Not an intimidating
bunch, but DePaul coach
Ray Meyer knew he was
beat before his 800 Demons
ever hit the floor against
Boston college.
• • •
Up until recently, the
most famous Boston Col
lege basketball player was
Rick Kuhn. Kuhn was con
victed on felony charges a
couple of years back for
shaving points while playing
for Boston College. No
more of that; Davis had the
gutsiest team in the tour
nament. The Eagles worked
the floor from end to end
and their gritty hustle gave
nothing away. Davis's teams
are known for their scrappi
ness on the floor — both lit
erally and figuratively.
Davis instills into his
teams the kind of intensity
that Kimberly Belton
showed on his face and

Doug Marty showed in his
game. He is the kind of
coach a John Revelli and a
Steve Brown can benefit
from and a Doug Marty
missed.
• • •
Revelli is the only
Cardinal that Davis knows
much about. Davis tried to
recruit Revelli to Boston
College two years ago. "I
have very, very high regard
for John Revelli," Davissaid.
Davis does not want to make
judgements on the other
players until they have been
able "to prove themselves
on the court."
So far, Davis has been im
pressed with Stanford. "The
thing that impresses me
most about Stanford is that
people care," Davis said.
"They want academic ex
cellence and fine athletic
teams. I'm hoping I can
make a difference."
There was a smile from
ear to Athletic Department
ear yesterday as Athletic Di
rector Andy Geiger an
nounced the signing of Bos
ton College coach Tom
Davis to be the new skipper
at Stanford. Davis made a
name for himself in the Big
East Conference by winning
conference coach of the
year honors last year, taking
the Eagles to the NCAA's
two years in a row and
reaching the quarterfinals
of the NCAA Tournament
this season.
• • •
Why did Davis leave Bos
ton College after doing such
a remarkable job?
1) More money perhaps.
Davis made about $45,000 a
year, excluding basketball
camp income, at Boston
College. Here, he will more
than double that.

2) He said a change might
do some good for his pro
fessional career. Stanford
and Wisconsin were his two
biggest bidders. Aren't you
flattered he chose us?
3) He likes culture and
golf. The Boston Pops didn't
quite make the grade, but
the Stanford Golf Course
did.
4)Two Boston schools —
Boston College and North
eastern — made the NCAA's
this year, but the toughest
ticket in collegetown was
still the Boston College
hockey team. Hopefully,
Stanford's new fast-paced
game will boost the anemic
gate at Maples Pavillion.
• • •
It's too bad the Athletic
Department didn't wait un
til next year before unveil
ing their basketball slogan,
"It's a new day on the
Farm." Davis (that's Dr.

Thomas R. Davis) promises
to use the fast break and
pressure defense regardless
of how fast Stanford is next
year.

Sporting Muse

"Speed only determines
how effectively you will run
it,"he said.
Davis said he will also use
a patient offense when the
break doesn't come off and
a pressure defense. Now
that is a new day on the
Farm.

In the NCAA Tournament
Boston College made three
appearances on TV. Davis
led the Eagles to dramatic
upset wins over San Francis
co and DePaul and a big win
over Kansas State.
The Eagles won by hard
work and hustle. They could
claim only one legitimate

star — guard John Bagley.
Bagley's physique was partly
an optical illusion, partly
not. At 5-11, he weighs 205
pounds, but is still the con
summate college guard. His
problems began when he
decided to wear No. 54 in
stead of a low, sleek, guard
type number, and a pair of
godzilla trunks. When
standing, he looked fat —
just plain fat. In action, he
moved like ice.
