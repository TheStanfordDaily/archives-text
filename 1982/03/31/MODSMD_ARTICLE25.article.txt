varsity sports, many successful,
jnd some not. However, when
nundated with tests, papers,
ind other rigors of academia,
:he average student probably
cannot remember the last Stan

ind would be hard pressed to
ecite the baseball teams na
tional ranking. Yet students
always find time to play in
tramurals.
