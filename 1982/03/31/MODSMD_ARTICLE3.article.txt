# Glass enclosures to cut Meyer noise
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Students returning to Meyer
Memorial Library this quarter will
be greeted by three stories of scaf
folding and new glass panels
around the third and fourth
floors.
In an attempt to reduce the
noise level in the library, the open
"well" is being enclosed with
aluminum frames and glass panels
around the railing on the upper
two floors. The construction was
begun on March 22 and is sched
uled to be completed by the first
week in May.
Elizabeth Salzer, head of Meyer
Library, said, "We've taken as
many steps as we can to keep the
distraction to students at a min
imum." She said drilling will take
place only during the morning,
when students are least likely to
be in the library, and noted that
the scaffolding was put up during
spring break when few students
were around.
On the upper floors, all book
shelves within 10 to 12 feet of the
well are covered with plastic
sheets, but Salzer said "students
can still help themselves to
books."
Salzer explained that over the
years the principal complaint
about Meyer Library has been the
noise, and several studies have
been done to determine ways to
combat the problem.
"We know that the second floor

will always be noisier because it is
a work floor," Salzer said, but
added that enclosing the well
should make the reading areas of
the second floor and the entire
third and fourth floors more
quiet. "We really hope students
will notice a significant dif
ference," she said.
The enclosure project was the
most expensive noise-reduction
option studied. Salzer said the Ac
ademic Council's Committee on
Libraries recommended that con
struction begin now, rather than
waiting until summer, both be
cause the funding is available now
and because the committee
thought the construction may be
more expensive during the sum
mer.
Salzer said the enclosure
project was budgeted to cost be
tween $100,000 and $150,000 and
that the finances were made avail
able by transferring money from
the Meyer Library endowment
into a fund for one-time improve
ments in the building.
Poor ventilation is another
criticism often heard about
Meyer, but Salzer said that a study
done before the project began
concluded that the enclosure
would not worsen the library's
ventilation.
"The biggest disruption," Salzer
added, "has been to our bat popu
lation. They've been very dis
oriented."

Scaffolds rise above the loan desk in Meyer Library as workers
begin placing glass enclosures in the center section of each

the construction, library officials say that when completed the
new barriers will reduce the building's noise problems signifi
