## 
### Douglas Jehl 
The denial of tenure to award-win
ning Asst. History Prof. Estelle Freed
man early this month has been met
with strong opposition by rnany *tu
dents and faculty member* nere and
will likely lead to the history depart
ment submitting new evidence sup
porting Freedman to the University.

News Analysis

The deans of humanities and sci
ences decided early this month to fol
low a unanimous recommendation
by the Committee on Appointments
and Promotions (CAP) that Freed
man not be granted tenure. The CAP
is composed of faculty members
drawn from the humanities, social
science and science divisions of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
According to Prof. Peter Stansky,
history department chairman, a de
partmental committee chaired by
Prof. Carl Degler plans to submit new
material to the CAP. And sources in
the history department, the dean of
humanities and sciences' office and
the provost's office all say that a con
siderable number of letters backing
Freedman have been received from
students and professors both inside
and outside the University.
Stansky said that he and Freedman
were informed of the University's de
cision in a March 3 letter from Wil
liam Chace, associate dean of hu
manities and sciences. Chace told the
Daily that he, Dean of Humanities

and Sciences Norman Wessels and
Associate Dean James Rosse decided
to accept the committee's recom
mendation that Freedman not be
tenure. Chace declined to
comment on the reasons for the
deans' decision.
The third associate dean, History
Prof. David Kennedy, did not take
part in the decision in accord with a
rule preventing deans from acting on
candidates from their own depart
ment, according to Chace.
The CAP makes its recommenda
tions after examining a lengthy file of
papers including letters from ex
ternal references, according to
Chace. In the Freedman case, the
recommendation came after tenured
professors in the history department
voted to recommend tenure for
Freedman. Stansky refused to dis
close the voting figures, but said that
the vote was split. Previously, the de
partmental committee chaired by
Degler voted unanimously in favor of
tenure tor Freedman.
Reliable sources verified the gen
eral content of reports to the Daily
that the CAP downgraded the history
department's recommendations of
Freedman for tenure. There were
several reports that although the his
tory department, in its recommenda
tion of tenure for Freedman, de
scribed her teaching as "excellent"
and her research as "very good," the
CAP revised those recommendations
to "very good" and "adequate," re
spectively.
While Stansky refused to comment

on the contents of his department's
recommendation, he did character
ize Freedman's teaching as "ex
cellent" and her research as "very
good."
The history department, through
submission of new material, would
be the first source of any reversal of
the deans' decision. Prof. Barton
Bernstein, a member of Degler's
committee, confirmed that the com
mittee has started to gather more ma
terial supporting Freedman and will
likely submit it in April. The dean's
office can reverse its decision at any
time, according to Stansky.
"There's no real reason it (a re
versal of the decision) couldn't hap
pen next year rather than this year; I
would hope it would happen this
year rather than next year, but I hope
it would happen next year rather
than never," Stansky said.
"It's pretty much in Professor
Degler's hands at the moment," he
said.
Degler, in Philadelphia for a meet
ing of the Organization of American
Historians, was unavailable for com
ment. The Daily was also unable to
reach Freedman, who was travelling
on the east coast en route to the same
meeting.
Freedman is in her sixth year at
Stanford. According to Chace, rules
set by the American Association of
University Professors prohibit pro
fessors working for more than six
years at the same university without
being granted tenure. If tenure is re
fused, the professor can remain at

the university for a seventh year as a
grace period, but must leave after
that time. If the dean's office does
not reverse its decision not to grant
tenure to freedman, %Y\e
peat the decision. The first level of
appeal would be to the office of
Provost Albert Hastorf.
Freedman was the recipient of the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel award for out
standing service to undergraduate
eduction last June and the Dean's
award for distinguished teaching in
1978. She was one of the founders of
the program in feminist studies here.
Much speculation, most of it off
the record, has been raised about the
reason that the CAP and the deans
decided against tenure for Freed
man. Neither the members of the
CAP nor the deans would comment
on the matter. One said that Univer
sity rules required that information
about their meetings remain con
fidential.
Some students have charged that
the University opposes giving tenure
to women and does not support
feminist studies.
Most other professors and stu
dents contacted by the Daily who
worked closely with Freedman re
fused to comment for publication
about the decision and stressed that
the issue was extremely sensitive.
Almost all, however, expressed sup
port for Freedman and shock, disap
pointment or both at the denial of
tenure for her.

the University opposes giving tenure
to women and does not support
feminist studies.
Most other professors and stu
dents contacted by the Daily who
worked closely with Freedman re
fused to comment for publication
about the decision and stressed that
the issue was extremely sensitive.
Almost all, however, expressed sup
port for Freedman and shock, disap
pointment or both at the denial of
tenure for her.
The denial of tenure to award-win
ning Asst. History Prof. Estelle Freed
man early this month has been met
with strong opposition by rnany *tu
dents and faculty member* nere and
will likely lead to the history depart
ment submitting new evidence sup
porting Freedman to the University.

News Analysis

The deans of humanities and sci
ences decided early this month to fol
low a unanimous recommendation
by the Committee on Appointments
and Promotions (CAP) that Freed
man not be granted tenure. The CAP
is composed of faculty members
drawn from the humanities, social
science and science divisions of the
School of Humanities and Sciences.
According to Prof. Peter Stansky,
history department chairman, a de
partmental committee chaired by
Prof. Carl Degler plans to submit new
material to the CAP. And sources in
the history department, the dean of
humanities and sciences' office and
the provost's office all say that a con
siderable number of letters backing
Freedman have been received from
students and professors both inside
and outside the University.
Stansky said that he and Freedman
were informed of the University's de
cision in a March 3 letter from Wil
liam Chace, associate dean of hu
manities and sciences. Chace told the
Daily that he, Dean of Humanities

and Sciences Norman Wessels and
Associate Dean James Rosse decided
to accept the committee's recom
mendation that Freedman not be
tenure. Chace declined to
comment on the reasons for the
deans' decision.
The third associate dean, History
Prof. David Kennedy, did not take
part in the decision in accord with a
rule preventing deans from acting on
candidates from their own depart
ment, according to Chace.
The CAP makes its recommenda
tions after examining a lengthy file of
papers including letters from ex
ternal references, according to
Chace. In the Freedman case, the
recommendation came after tenured
professors in the history department
voted to recommend tenure for
Freedman. Stansky refused to dis
close the voting figures, but said that
the vote was split. Previously, the de
partmental committee chaired by
Degler voted unanimously in favor of
tenure tor Freedman.
Reliable sources verified the gen
eral content of reports to the Daily
that the CAP downgraded the history
department's recommendations of
Freedman for tenure. There were
several reports that although the his
tory department, in its recommenda
tion of tenure for Freedman, de
scribed her teaching as "excellent"
and her research as "very good," the
CAP revised those recommendations
to "very good" and "adequate," re
spectively.
While Stansky refused to comment

on the contents of his department's
recommendation, he did character
ize Freedman's teaching as "ex
cellent" and her research as "very
good."
The history department, through
submission of new material, would
be the first source of any reversal of
the deans' decision. Prof. Barton
Bernstein, a member of Degler's
committee, confirmed that the com
mittee has started to gather more ma
terial supporting Freedman and will
likely submit it in April. The dean's
office can reverse its decision at any
time, according to Stansky.
"There's no real reason it (a re
versal of the decision) couldn't hap
pen next year rather than this year; I
would hope it would happen this
year rather than next year, but I hope
it would happen next year rather
than never," Stansky said.
"It's pretty much in Professor
Degler's hands at the moment," he
said.
Degler, in Philadelphia for a meet
ing of the Organization of American
Historians, was unavailable for com
ment. The Daily was also unable to
reach Freedman, who was travelling
on the east coast en route to the same
meeting.
Freedman is in her sixth year at
Stanford. According to Chace, rules
set by the American Association of
University Professors prohibit pro
fessors working for more than six
years at the same university without
being granted tenure. If tenure is re
fused, the professor can remain at

the university for a seventh year as a
grace period, but must leave after
that time. If the dean's office does
not reverse its decision not to grant
tenure to freedman, %Y\e
peat the decision. The first level of
appeal would be to the office of
Provost Albert Hastorf.
Freedman was the recipient of the
Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel award for out
standing service to undergraduate
eduction last June and the Dean's
award for distinguished teaching in
1978. She was one of the founders of
the program in feminist studies here.
Much speculation, most of it off
the record, has been raised about the
reason that the CAP and the deans
decided against tenure for Freed
man. Neither the members of the
CAP nor the deans would comment
on the matter. One said that Univer
sity rules required that information
about their meetings remain con
fidential.
