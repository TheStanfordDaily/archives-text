# University energy plan to counter rising costs
##

This is the last in a two part series
The University's energy costs are
projected to jump by 35 percent this
year, and will double to $25 million in
four years, according to the latest
forecast by the Energy Program Of
fice. Faced with these steadily in
creasing expenses, the University has
tried to counter them with a com
prehensive Energy Action Plan, and
buildings responsible for their own
costs have also implemented energy
conservation measures.
The Facilities and Services Energy
Action Plan, prepared last spring,
consists of a series of proposals de
signed to reduce energy consump
tion in the University's central energy
facility, distribution systems and
buildings by 25 percent in three to
four years.
The plan requires approximately
$12 million for one-time capital
costs-mainly building retrofits,
$730,000 per year for recurring capi
tal investments, and $860,000 for in
itial studies. It is estimated that com
pletion of its proposed projects
would save $3.2 million annually in
energy costs, thereby paying back
the investment in about five years.
The plan focuses on improved
energy efficiency in three areas; the
production system, or campus cen

tral energy facility; the distribution
system, which distributes fuel, air and
chilled water for air-conditioning to
University buildings; and the end
use system.
In this last category, the University
will install new equipment in heat
ing, venting and air conditioning sys
tems in large academic buildings.
The Graduate School of Business
(GSB) project, completed last June,
was the first of these retrofits.
The GSB retrofit consisted of revis
ing the building's heating, ventila
tion and air conditioning (HVAC) sys
tem, in order to stop the simultane
ous heating and cooling of the build
ing space. The system is now de
signed so that heating and cooling
will occur only when the tem
perature goes below or above certain
specified levels.
In addition, a building schedular,
or time clock, was installed to regu
late the entire HVAC system from a
central control room. This device
greatly reduces energy comsump
tion, since individual rooms are now
heated or cooled only when in use.
Finally, the GSB has implemented
an innovative preventive main
tenance program, to replace the old
policy of "crisis maintenance only."
A building operator has been as

signed to maintain the retrofitted
work on a daily operator's
salary will be paid for by the cost sav
ings which result from the project.
Energy use studies have been com
pleted for the Law School, Terman
and two of the Hoover Buildings, all
of which would undergo complete
HVAC retrofits. Green Library,
Margaret Jacks Hall and the History
Corner would receive minor mod
ifications.
The Energy Action Plan also in
cludes a public awareness program
which represents an effort to achieve
public cooperation in decreasing
electricity use. This is handled by
both the Energy Program Office,
which is responsible for the academ
ic and service buildings on campus,
and by the Housing Energy Con
servation Center, which conducts
energy conservation projects for
housing and food service.
Under the plan, the Energy Pro
gram Office has continued its efforts
to coordinate all University depart
ments in the interest of reducing
energy-use, according to adminis
trators. One major aspect of these ef
forts is the Building Energy Manager
program in which one person from
each academic and service depart
ment on campus takes resoonsibility

for managing the conservation work
in their building.
The duties of these building
energy managers include distribut
ing "The Energy Exchange," a month
ly newsletter containing tips on how
to conserve energy, and putting up
posters with energy-saving messages.
In addition, these managers make
charts of the increases or decreases in
consumption of energy using reports
complied by the Utilities Depart
ment.
The Housing Energy Conservation
Center, besides distributing flyers
and placing ads in the Daily, handles
such technological projects as mod
ifying and upgrading heating con
trols, doing lighting conversions, in
stalling insulation and retrofitting
houses.
By far the largest single long-term
project proposed in the Energy Ac
tion Plan is a $30 million cogenera
tion plant. The Facilities Project Man
agement Department is currently
studying the feasibility of such a facil
ity, which would produce electricity
and useful steam simultaneously and
would thereby significantly increase
the energy efficiency of the campus
energy production system. The
energy savings are expected to total
$7.5 million per year.

forecast by the Energy Program Of
fice. Faced with these steadily in
creasing expenses, the University has
tried to counter them with a com
prehensive Energy Action Plan, and
buildings responsible for their own
costs have also implemented energy
conservation measures.
The Facilities and Services Energy
Action Plan, prepared last spring,
consists of a series of proposals de
signed to reduce energy consump
tion in the University's central energy
facility, distribution systems and
buildings by 25 percent in three to
four years.
The plan requires approximately
$12 million for one-time capital
costs-mainly building retrofits,
$730,000 per year for recurring capi
tal investments, and $860,000 for in
itial studies. It is estimated that com
pletion of its proposed projects
would save $3.2 million annually in
energy costs, thereby paying back
the investment in about five years.
The plan focuses on improved
energy efficiency in three areas; the
production system, or campus cen

tral energy facility; the distribution
system, which distributes fuel, air and
chilled water for air-conditioning to
University buildings; and the end
use system.
In this last category, the University
will install new equipment in heat
ing, venting and air conditioning sys
tems in large academic buildings.
The Graduate School of Business
(GSB) project, completed last June,
was the first of these retrofits.
The GSB retrofit consisted of revis
ing the building's heating, ventila
tion and air conditioning (HVAC) sys
tem, in order to stop the simultane
ous heating and cooling of the build
ing space. The system is now de
signed so that heating and cooling
will occur only when the tem
perature goes below or above certain
specified levels.
In addition, a building schedular,
or time clock, was installed to regu
late the entire HVAC system from a
central control room. This device
greatly reduces energy comsump
tion, since individual rooms are now
heated or cooled only when in use.
Finally, the GSB has implemented
an innovative preventive main
tenance program, to replace the old
policy of "crisis maintenance only."
A building operator has been as

signed to maintain the retrofitted
work on a daily operator's
salary will be paid for by the cost sav
ings which result from the project.
Energy use studies have been com
pleted for the Law School, Terman
and two of the Hoover Buildings, all
of which would undergo complete
HVAC retrofits. Green Library,
Margaret Jacks Hall and the History
Corner would receive minor mod
ifications.
The Energy Action Plan also in
cludes a public awareness program
which represents an effort to achieve
public cooperation in decreasing
electricity use. This is handled by
both the Energy Program Office,
which is responsible for the academ
ic and service buildings on campus,
and by the Housing Energy Con
servation Center, which conducts
energy conservation projects for
housing and food service.
Under the plan, the Energy Pro
gram Office has continued its efforts
to coordinate all University depart
ments in the interest of reducing
energy-use, according to adminis
trators. One major aspect of these ef
forts is the Building Energy Manager
program in which one person from
each academic and service depart
ment on campus takes resoonsibility

for managing the conservation work
in their building.
The duties of these building
energy managers include distribut
ing "The Energy Exchange," a month
ly newsletter containing tips on how
to conserve energy, and putting up
posters with energy-saving messages.
In addition, these managers make
charts of the increases or decreases in
consumption of energy using reports
complied by the Utilities Depart
ment.
The Housing Energy Conservation
Center, besides distributing flyers
and placing ads in the Daily, handles
such technological projects as mod
ifying and upgrading heating con
trols, doing lighting conversions, in
stalling insulation and retrofitting
houses.
By far the largest single long-term
project proposed in the Energy Ac
tion Plan is a $30 million cogenera
tion plant. The Facilities Project Man
agement Department is currently
studying the feasibility of such a facil
ity, which would produce electricity
and useful steam simultaneously and
would thereby significantly increase
the energy efficiency of the campus
energy production system. The
energy savings are expected to total
$7.5 million per year.
