# Palo Alto council considers local gun control ordinance
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
Palo Alto took a first step toward
banning handguns from the city
last week when the City Council
authorized City Attorney Diane
Lee to determine if a handgun
control ordinance violates state
law.
The council's unanimous vote
seemed to surprise some mem
bers of the audience, which lis
tened to statements and speeches
by both proponents and oppo
nents of the ban that lasted well

over an hour during the meeting
held last Monday.
The handgun ban was first pro
posed about six months ago by
council member Leland Levy. The
issue received renewed attention
recently after a handgun ban was
ruled constitutional in the city of
Morton Grove, Illinois, a suburb
of Chicago. Levy said before the
meeting that the ban will ac
complish little by itself but that he
hopes it will encourage state and
federal efforts to restrict hand
guns.
Council member Ellen Fletcher,
who co-sponsored the ban pro
posal, said the ban is more than
symbolic. She hopes it will spur
neighboring cities to ban hand
guns. Other Bay Area com
munities including San Francisco
and Sunnyvale are considering
similar measures.
Former Mayor Alan Henderson
made a rare return appearance to
the council meeting to encourage
adoption of the ban. He said that
the council has been at the fore

front of change in the past and
should not be deterred from conti
nuing that role, even if faced with the
threat of lawsuits.
Several of those who spoke in favor
of the ban said that handguns were
responsible for more than 11,000
deaths in the United States last year.
One speaker said that during the
Vietnam war era more Americans
were killed by handguns here than
died in the war.
Those opposing the ban said that
handguns were a necessary method
of protection from criminals. They
complained that their constitutional
right to bear arms would be infringed
upon. One speaker said that because
of the city's high rate of burglaries,
citizens of Palo Alto especially
needed handguns to defend them

selves.
Proponents of the ban said that
citizens could better defend them
selves with rifles or shotguns, which
the measure would not prohibit.
If the City Attorney determines
that a handgun ban does not violate
state law, the council's Policy and
Procedures Committee, chaired by
Fletcher, will conduct a public hear
ing on the ban before sending it to
the full council for a final decision.
State legislation already prohibits
local licensing and registration of
handguns. According to Fletcher,
H .L. Richardson, who sponsored that
legislation, said the state law also pro
hibits handgun bans. Fletcher said
that since a handgun ban was not
contemplated when the bill was
drawn up, it does not prohibit one.
The City Attorney is expected to
make her report to the council in a
few weeks.
