# Palo Alto council considers local gun control ordinance
## 
### Tim Lundergan 
Palo Alto took a first step toward
banning handguns from the city
last week when the City Council
authorized City Attorney Diane
Lee to determine if a handgun
control ordinance violates state
law.
The council's unanimous vote
seemed to surprise some mem
bers of the audience, which lis
tened to statements and speeches
by both proponents and oppo
nents of the ban that lasted well

over an hour during the meeting
held last Monday.
The handgun ban was first pro
posed about six months ago by
council member Leland Levy. The
issue received renewed attention
recently after a handgun ban was
ruled constitutional in the city of
Morton Grove, Illinois, a suburb
of Chicago. Levy said before the
meeting that the ban will ac
complish little by itself but that he
hopes it will encourage state and
federal efforts to restrict hand
guns.
Council member Ellen Fletcher,
who co-sponsored the ban pro
posal, said the ban is more than
symbolic. She hopes it will spur
neighboring cities to ban hand
guns. Other Bay Area com
munities including San Francisco
and Sunnyvale are considering
similar measures.
Former Mayor Alan Henderson
made a rare return appearance to
the council meeting to encourage
adoption of the ban. He said that
the council has been at the fore
