# Businessmen drop Reaganomics

by The Washington Post
Washington — Last spring the American
business community was united as never
before in praise of President Ronald Rea
gan's economic program. Typical of the
captains of industry was Theodore Brophy,
chief executive officer of the General Tele
phone & Electronics Corp. and a senior of
ficer of the Business Roundtable.
"Implementation of the (Reagan admin
istration's) proposed spending reductions,
when combined with the other aspects of
the president's economic recovery pro
gram," Brophy testified last May, "will pro
vide us with a healthy, growing economy
on a long-range basis — the best protec
tion for all individuals."
Brophy's view prevailed, and Congress
enacted Reagan's program. Last week,
though, Brophy revised and extended his
remarks:
"Our economy is in the throes of a re
cession," Brophy testified, "accompanied
by inordinately high interest rates, and
now is facing the prospect of large future
budget deficits.... The (Business) Round
table is deeply concerned about the size of
projected deficits and believes that, unless
promptly dealt with, they will encourage
continued high interest rates and slow ec
onomic recovery and growth."
Brophy was testifying for the Round
table, which now favors stern action to re
duce gaping federal deficits. One by one,
the organizations that businessmen form
to advance their interests are jumping off
the bandwagon of Reaganomics. No mat
ter that less than a year ago the same busi
ness groups were pushing that bandwagon

forward like a V-8 in a 1960s gas-guzzler.
"Corporate America didn't have any
idea what was in the tax bill," observed
Sen. Charles Mathias (R-Md.) last week,
trying to explain the business community's
flip-flop on Reaganomics. "They were like
hounds after a fox," he added, referring to
the big corporate tax breaks that made the
Reagan program so attractive to busi
nessmen.
A prominent Republican lobbyist who
works for big business said he thought ex
ecutives were now getting pressure from
their boards of directors and stockholders
to do something about high interest rates
and the recession. 'It just somehow isn't
working," this man said of Reaganomics,
adding that the business community is dig
ging in to save the tax breaks it got from
Congress last year. "I think they're getting
a little greedy," he said, adding, "if you put
my name in the paper, I'll be run out of
town."
In a brief interview in the hallway out
side the Senate Finance Committee,
Brophy was asked why the tune had
changed so quickly. "I don't think any of
us feel we have crystal balls," he replied.
Pressed on the wrong prognosis he and his
colleagues gave Congress last spring,
Brophy asked who had predicted that in
terest rates would still be so high.
One answer to that question is Henry
Kaufman, managing director of Salomon
Bros. Inc., an economist with a wide fol
lowing on Wall Street. Kaufman's was one
of many voices warning last year that if the
Reagan program were adopted, it would
produce an unavoidable collision be

tween an expansionary fiscal policy and a
restrictive monetary policy. Brophy ac
knowledged that Kaufman was "right
about some things, but not everything,"
noting that inflation fell much faster than
Kaufman had said it would.
Another prediction of continued high
interest rates came from the Business
Council, a group of major corporations. At
about the time Brophy was making his op
timistic predictions last May, the council
issued a formal forecast that echoed his
hopefulness about economic growth, but
said interest rates would stay in the 14-
to-16-percent range throughout the year
(as, roughly, they have). And the Business
Council did predict much lower inflation.
But all that was last year, when corporate
America was exhilarated by the defeat of
a president it detested and the election of a
free-enterprise Republican. "Busi
nessmen are fundamentally Republicans,"
observed Irving Shapiro, the recently re
tired chief executive officer of DuPont,
who himself was close to President Carter.
"They persuaded themselves to back a
new Republican administration 100 per
cent. They did that although they had mis
givings."
"Their uneasiness spilled over when
they saw the latest budget proposals" and
the big deficits they contained, Shapiro
said. His analysis seems to be supported by
a recent poll of members of the Wall Street
investment community conducted by the
American Stock Exchange. Where 67 per
cent of those polled "strongly approved"
the Reagan program a year ago, only 41
percent do so now.

business community was united as never
before in praise of President Ronald Rea
gan's economic program. Typical of the
captains of industry was Theodore Brophy,
chief executive officer of the General Tele
phone & Electronics Corp. and a senior of
ficer of the Business Roundtable.
"Implementation of the (Reagan admin
istration's) proposed spending reductions,
when combined with the other aspects of
the president's economic recovery pro
gram," Brophy testified last May, "will pro
vide us with a healthy, growing economy
on a long-range basis — the best protec
tion for all individuals."
Brophy's view prevailed, and Congress
enacted Reagan's program. Last week,
though, Brophy revised and extended his
remarks:
"Our economy is in the throes of a re
cession," Brophy testified, "accompanied
by inordinately high interest rates, and
now is facing the prospect of large future
budget deficits.... The (Business) Round
table is deeply concerned about the size of
projected deficits and believes that, unless
promptly dealt with, they will encourage
continued high interest rates and slow ec
onomic recovery and growth."
Brophy was testifying for the Round
table, which now favors stern action to re
duce gaping federal deficits. One by one,
the organizations that businessmen form
to advance their interests are jumping off
the bandwagon of Reaganomics. No mat
ter that less than a year ago the same busi
ness groups were pushing that bandwagon

forward like a V-8 in a 1960s gas-guzzler.
"Corporate America didn't have any
idea what was in the tax bill," observed
Sen. Charles Mathias (R-Md.) last week,
trying to explain the business community's
flip-flop on Reaganomics. "They were like
hounds after a fox," he added, referring to
the big corporate tax breaks that made the
Reagan program so attractive to busi
nessmen.
A prominent Republican lobbyist who
works for big business said he thought ex
ecutives were now getting pressure from
their boards of directors and stockholders
to do something about high interest rates
and the recession. 'It just somehow isn't
working," this man said of Reaganomics,
adding that the business community is dig
ging in to save the tax breaks it got from
Congress last year. "I think they're getting
a little greedy," he said, adding, "if you put
my name in the paper, I'll be run out of
town."
In a brief interview in the hallway out
side the Senate Finance Committee,
Brophy was asked why the tune had
changed so quickly. "I don't think any of
us feel we have crystal balls," he replied.
Pressed on the wrong prognosis he and his
colleagues gave Congress last spring,
Brophy asked who had predicted that in
terest rates would still be so high.
One answer to that question is Henry
Kaufman, managing director of Salomon
Bros. Inc., an economist with a wide fol
lowing on Wall Street. Kaufman's was one
of many voices warning last year that if the
Reagan program were adopted, it would
produce an unavoidable collision be

tween an expansionary fiscal policy and a
restrictive monetary policy. Brophy ac
knowledged that Kaufman was "right
about some things, but not everything,"
noting that inflation fell much faster than
Kaufman had said it would.
Another prediction of continued high
interest rates came from the Business
Council, a group of major corporations. At
about the time Brophy was making his op
timistic predictions last May, the council
issued a formal forecast that echoed his
hopefulness about economic growth, but
said interest rates would stay in the 14-
to-16-percent range throughout the year
(as, roughly, they have). And the Business
Council did predict much lower inflation.
But all that was last year, when corporate
America was exhilarated by the defeat of
a president it detested and the election of a
free-enterprise Republican. "Busi
nessmen are fundamentally Republicans,"
observed Irving Shapiro, the recently re
tired chief executive officer of DuPont,
who himself was close to President Carter.
"They persuaded themselves to back a
new Republican administration 100 per
cent. They did that although they had mis
givings."
"Their uneasiness spilled over when
they saw the latest budget proposals" and
the big deficits they contained, Shapiro
said. His analysis seems to be supported by
a recent poll of members of the Wall Street
investment community conducted by the
American Stock Exchange. Where 67 per
cent of those polled "strongly approved"
the Reagan program a year ago, only 41
percent do so now.
