# Oak Creek residents organize association

### Katherine Brown 
The cloud of secrecy surrounding
the proposed conversion of the Oak
Creek apartments to condominiums
has prompted resident Al Rooney to
organize the Oak Creek Home
Buyers Association (OCHBA).
About 100 tenants interested in
buying or leading their apartments
showed up on March 10 for the first
meeting. "The room was overflowing
... many were standing," said
Rooney, who was elected president
of the group. Five board officers
were elected and membership dues
of $10 per person were approved.
One objective is to obtain signifi
cant property improvements from
developer Scott Carey in exchange
for releasing him from his original
11.75 percent financing commit
ment.
"In view of the financial losses
we've incurred as a result of defer
ring other investments during the last
two years while depending on
Carey's announced schedules, we
feel our demands are reasonable,"
said Rooney. The group plans to
challenge Carey's contention that
their only two choices are to drop the
conversion or to consent to his "best
possible" financing.
OCHBA also is concerned with the
deferment of 10-year old main
tenance problems. The group wants
a "fair ana reasonable apartment ex
change program that would provide
relief to extraordinarily high rental
rates charged to tenants who moved
into different units in hopes of
buying." What the group seems to be
lacking is "reliable, credible and au
thoritative answers to questions
about the status of the conversion
and financing," according to
Rooney.
Carey first approached the Oak
Creek residents through a series of 34
informal meetings held at the apart

ments during March 1980. "Carey
scheduled them in the morning, af
ternoon and evening... he even had
a tape recorder going," said Rooney.
"People just ate it up," he com
mented.
In July of 1980 a letter was sent to
the tenants informing them about
the "pending conversion." It named
the landlords replacing Gerson Bakar
as Cornish and Carey, the Wilsey-
Bennett Company and "a financial
institution." The letter said, "the
Wilsey-Bennett company has had a
long association with Gerson Bakar."
Carey's approval for conversion
from the city of Palo Alto was cont
ingent on two-thirds consent of the
tenants. Under the new conversion
ordinance, (revised at the time Carey
received his approval in June 1980), it
would take a 3 percent rental vacancy
in Palo Alto to get approval for an
other conversion. This ordinance ef
fectively prohibits any more con
versions in today's housing market.
Rooney said that Carey's big
blunder was his public reneging of
his promises. The sales package he
sent to tenants in September of 1980
presented the alternatives in a
coercive manner, according to
Rooney. George Pontis, vice-presi
dent of the OCHBA said Carey's
message was in effect, "Give us your
consent for the conversion, or you
won't get a lifetime lease."
"People just didn't realize they
didn't have to sign in order to protect
their interests as tenants," said
Rooney.
The package also said that 2Vi per
cent of the resale price would go to
Stanford University, which has the
first right of repurchase. Rooney also
said that these resale controls would
prevent owners from "shooting the
moon" because they wouldn't be
able to sell their condominiums on
the market for less than 90 percent of
the price he offers to Stanford.
"The tenants' suspicion was in
creasing ... at the lack of clear in
formation on the status of the deal
between Stanford and Carey that is
making the tenants uneasy.
seems to want everybody in the
dark."
In addition to meetings and letters,
Carey threw a "Gala Cocktail" party
on Jan. 12,1981 to thank the tenants
for their consent to convert to con
dominiums. "There was booze
and good food," said Rooney. "He
even handed out a letter on carpet
replacements for prospective
buyers."
That same month tenants were of
fered the option of moving to more
"desirable" units that they would-be
able to buy after conversion. Rooney
said they were charged premium
market rates and had only 24 units
from which to choose.
Scott Carey and Stanford are still
negotiating the terms of the original
three-page agreement which would
extend the ground lease (which has
been pre-paid by Gerson Bakar until
2020). Stanford agreed to take own
ership of 200 units and would like for
Carey to come through with his
promise of assumable 11.75 percent
financing. Stanford could then offer
the units to its faculty and staff at low
er prices as the remaining 559 units
came up for resale.
A big stumbling block for Stanford
is the inability to put its people in the
200 units right away. Present con
version law gives current tenants a
lifetime-lease option. Thus, for $19
million paid up front, Stanford would
become the landlord of 200 rental
units.
"Scott Carey says it would take five
years for the units to become avail
able, we think it would be at least 10
since the turnover rate at Oak Creek
has been about 10 percent per year,"
said Frank Morrow, Stanford's Real
Estate Director.

"Scott Carey says it would take five
years for the units to become avail
able, we think it would be at least 10
since the turnover rate at Oak Creek
has been about 10 percent per year,"
said Frank Morrow, Stanford's Real
Estate Director.
The cloud of secrecy surrounding
the proposed conversion of the Oak
Creek apartments to condominiums
has prompted resident Al Rooney to
organize the Oak Creek Home
Buyers Association (OCHBA).
About 100 tenants interested in
buying or leading their apartments
showed up on March 10 for the first
meeting. "The room was overflowing
... many were standing," said
Rooney, who was elected president
of the group. Five board officers
were elected and membership dues
of $10 per person were approved.
One objective is to obtain signifi
cant property improvements from
developer Scott Carey in exchange
for releasing him from his original
11.75 percent financing commit
ment.
"In view of the financial losses
we've incurred as a result of defer
ring other investments during the last
two years while depending on
Carey's announced schedules, we
feel our demands are reasonable,"
said Rooney. The group plans to
challenge Carey's contention that
their only two choices are to drop the
conversion or to consent to his "best
possible" financing.
OCHBA also is concerned with the
deferment of 10-year old main
tenance problems. The group wants
a "fair ana reasonable apartment ex
change program that would provide
relief to extraordinarily high rental
rates charged to tenants who moved
into different units in hopes of
buying." What the group seems to be
lacking is "reliable, credible and au
thoritative answers to questions
about the status of the conversion
and financing," according to
Rooney.
Carey first approached the Oak
Creek residents through a series of 34
informal meetings held at the apart

ments during March 1980. "Carey
scheduled them in the morning, af
ternoon and evening... he even had
a tape recorder going," said Rooney.
"People just ate it up," he com
mented.
In July of 1980 a letter was sent to
the tenants informing them about
the "pending conversion." It named
the landlords replacing Gerson Bakar
as Cornish and Carey, the Wilsey-
Bennett Company and "a financial
institution." The letter said, "the
Wilsey-Bennett company has had a
long association with Gerson Bakar."
Carey's approval for conversion
from the city of Palo Alto was cont
ingent on two-thirds consent of the
tenants. Under the new conversion
ordinance, (revised at the time Carey
received his approval in June 1980), it
would take a 3 percent rental vacancy
in Palo Alto to get approval for an
other conversion. This ordinance ef
fectively prohibits any more con
versions in today's housing market.
Rooney said that Carey's big
blunder was his public reneging of
his promises. The sales package he
sent to tenants in September of 1980
presented the alternatives in a
coercive manner, according to
Rooney. George Pontis, vice-presi
dent of the OCHBA said Carey's
message was in effect, "Give us your
consent for the conversion, or you
won't get a lifetime lease."
"People just didn't realize they
didn't have to sign in order to protect
their interests as tenants," said
Rooney.
The package also said that 2Vi per
cent of the resale price would go to
Stanford University, which has the
first right of repurchase. Rooney also
said that these resale controls would
prevent owners from "shooting the
moon" because they wouldn't be
able to sell their condominiums on
the market for less than 90 percent of
the price he offers to Stanford.
"The tenants' suspicion was in
creasing ... at the lack of clear in
formation on the status of the deal
between Stanford and Carey that is
making the tenants uneasy.
seems to want everybody in the
dark."
In addition to meetings and letters,
Carey threw a "Gala Cocktail" party
on Jan. 12,1981 to thank the tenants
for their consent to convert to con
dominiums. "There was booze
and good food," said Rooney. "He
even handed out a letter on carpet
replacements for prospective
buyers."
That same month tenants were of
fered the option of moving to more
"desirable" units that they would-be
able to buy after conversion. Rooney
said they were charged premium
market rates and had only 24 units
from which to choose.
Scott Carey and Stanford are still
negotiating the terms of the original
three-page agreement which would
extend the ground lease (which has
been pre-paid by Gerson Bakar until
2020). Stanford agreed to take own
ership of 200 units and would like for
Carey to come through with his
promise of assumable 11.75 percent
financing. Stanford could then offer
the units to its faculty and staff at low
er prices as the remaining 559 units
came up for resale.
A big stumbling block for Stanford
is the inability to put its people in the
200 units right away. Present con
version law gives current tenants a
lifetime-lease option. Thus, for $19
million paid up front, Stanford would
become the landlord of 200 rental
units.
