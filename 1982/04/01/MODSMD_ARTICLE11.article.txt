# Oak Creek residents organize association

The cloud of secrecy surrounding
the proposed conversion of the Oak
Creek apartments to condominiums
has prompted resident Al Rooney to
organize the Oak Creek Home
Buyers Association (OCHBA).
About 100 tenants interested in
buying or leading their apartments
showed up on March 10 for the first
meeting. "The room was overflowing
... many were standing," said
Rooney, who was elected president
of the group. Five board officers
were elected and membership dues
of $10 per person were approved.
One objective is to obtain signifi
cant property improvements from
developer Scott Carey in exchange
for releasing him from his original
11.75 percent financing commit
ment.
"In view of the financial losses
we've incurred as a result of defer
ring other investments during the last
two years while depending on
Carey's announced schedules, we
feel our demands are reasonable,"
said Rooney. The group plans to
challenge Carey's contention that
their only two choices are to drop the
conversion or to consent to his "best
possible" financing.
OCHBA also is concerned with the
deferment of 10-year old main
tenance problems. The group wants
a "fair ana reasonable apartment ex
change program that would provide
relief to extraordinarily high rental
rates charged to tenants who moved
into different units in hopes of
buying." What the group seems to be
lacking is "reliable, credible and au
thoritative answers to questions
about the status of the conversion
and financing," according to
Rooney.
Carey first approached the Oak
Creek residents through a series of 34
informal meetings held at the apart

ments during March 1980. "Carey
scheduled them in the morning, af
ternoon and evening... he even had
a tape recorder going," said Rooney.
"People just ate it up," he com
mented.
In July of 1980 a letter was sent to
the tenants informing them about
the "pending conversion." It named
the landlords replacing Gerson Bakar
as Cornish and Carey, the Wilsey-
Bennett Company and "a financial
institution." The letter said, "the
Wilsey-Bennett company has had a
long association with Gerson Bakar."
Carey's approval for conversion
from the city of Palo Alto was cont
ingent on two-thirds consent of the
tenants. Under the new conversion
ordinance, (revised at the time Carey
received his approval in June 1980), it
would take a 3 percent rental vacancy
in Palo Alto to get approval for an
other conversion. This ordinance ef
fectively prohibits any more con
versions in today's housing market.
Rooney said that Carey's big
blunder was his public reneging of
his promises. The sales package he
sent to tenants in September of 1980
presented the alternatives in a
coercive manner, according to
Rooney. George Pontis, vice-presi
dent of the OCHBA said Carey's
message was in effect, "Give us your
consent for the conversion, or you
won't get a lifetime lease."
"People just didn't realize they
didn't have to sign in order to protect
their interests as tenants," said
Rooney.
The package also said that 2Vi per
cent of the resale price would go to
Stanford University, which has the
first right of repurchase. Rooney also
said that these resale controls would
prevent owners from "shooting the
moon" because they wouldn't be
able to sell their condominiums on
