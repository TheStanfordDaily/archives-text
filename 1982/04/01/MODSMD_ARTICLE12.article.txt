# U.C. schools adjusting to budget cuts

A growing general deficit in the California
state budget is forcing University of California
schools to make severe budget cuts for the
1982-83 year.
The UC system is now faced with Governor
Jerry Brown's proposed $33.5 million cutback in
the UC base budget for the 1982-83 academic
year. The reductions will be accommodated
through a number of means including en
rollment and financial reductions in instructional
programs.
Stanford University President Donald Ken
nedy has expressed concern over the cuts in UC
funding. Kennedy said he feels the existence of a
healthy state university system is beneficial to
both private and public universities.
The plan to reduce the budget includes cutting
back on public services, and adding $100 a year to
the student fee. This leaves an additional $9 mil
lion which will have to be absorbed through cuts
in instructional programs, according to a report
from the office of UC President David Saxon.
The cutbacks were planned in August when
Brown made the proposal, which amounts to a
2Vi percent reduction in the university's base
budget. The original proposal suggested a 5 per
cent reduction. The $9 million cut will be spread

over four years in order to allow enrolled stu
dents to complete their degree programs.
Of the instructional programs, the UC system's
health sciences programs will be hit hardest. In
addition to the loss of funds from the state, UC
also faces the loss of some federal funding for
health sciences instruction. Statewide 605 stu
dents and about 70 faculty members will be cut
from health sciences departments, nearly a 5 per
cent reduction in the enrollment of current
health sciences programs. The cuts in the pro
grams will save the university system about $6.5
million.
The general campus program will be reduced
by about 750 students and 43 associated faculty
positions, saving the state about $2.5 million. The
reduction in enrollment will be absorbed by sev
en UC campuses, including reduced enrollments
of 125 students at Berkeley, and 235 students at
UCLA.
Although th*j major cutbacks are planned for
next year, the UC system has already suffered
budget cuts this year. Two percent or $22 million
of the base budget was cut from this year's
â€¢ budget. Reduction in instructional programs
were avoided, however, and the cuts were ac
comodated largely through hiring freezes, ser

vice reductions, and holiday shut-downs.
This year's cuts did not come within the normal
framework of budgetary negotiations, however,
but came in two increments, one in November
mandated by the state legislature, and one in
February ordered by Brown.
These one-time emergency budget cuts were
necessitated by the state's impending general
funds deficit. A sagging economy and unan
ticipated expenditures have cost the general
fund $1.5 billion to date.
A document issued from the State Legislative
Analyst's Office indicates that possible expen
ditures and additional decreases in revenue
threaten to raise the deficit to $400 million. Ana
lysts are calling for an additional $350 million to
be made available before the end of 1981-82
through tax tax increases and further reductions
in state governmental programs.
The state budget deficit this year was caused by
several unanticipated expenditures, including
the Medfly program and Medi-Cal. Analysts also
blame an inflated deficit on the current recession
and loss of funds caused by Proposition 13. "That
the Reagan economy is going down the toilet
means that our income is dropping," said one
consultant to the California State Senate Finance
Committee.
