## Opinions United States in Nicaragua 
### 
To those familiar with the steps
taken by the U.S. government to pro
voke the overthrow of Salvador Al
lende in Chile, the ring of recent re
ports has been oppressively familiar.
Finally, on last Thursday's edition of
the ABC program "Nightline,"
former Washington Post columnist
Carl Bernstein, citing a high adminis
tration official as his source, con
firmed our worst fears. All the pre
viously published reports are true.
The United States is co-ordinating
a package of covert operations
against Nicaragua, based in Hon
duras, which involves the following
elements: (1) a 500-man paramilitary
force made up of personnel from the
security services of several Latin
American nations and directed by
the CIA; (2) a similar but separate
1000-man commando force present
ly being assembled in Argentina; and
(3) special teams of U.S. Green Berets
prepared to engage in especially sen
sitive intelligence gathering and sab
otage operations.
What is the precise objective of
these planned operations? There are
a number of possibilities.
It is conceivable that their aim is
limited to forcing the Sandinistas to
divert all their energy and attention
to defending themselves at home,
thus impeding any military support
for the Salvadoran guerrillas. Accord
ing to Bernstein, this is the story the
Reagan administration told Con
gressional intelligence committees.
Though they profess not to, it is also
conceivable that administration poli
cy-makers believe that Nicaragua can
actually be destabilized a la Chile,
i.e., that the Sandinista government
can be overthrown by a campaign of
internally and externally directed
sabotage.
Finally, it is possible that the U.S.
government wishes to see Nicaragua
become embroiled in a war with
Honduras which would serve as a
pretext for American military strikes
against Nicaragua itself and possibly
against Cuba as well.
None of these alleged or conjec
tured motives seems to me entirely
convincing. Despite what they say
publicly, it is doubtful that adminis
tration policy-makers seriously be
lieve that the flow of arms which they
claim is taking place from Nicaragua
is a decisive element in the success of
the Salvadoran guerrillas; hence

eliminating it will not bring the war in
El Salvador to an end.
Nor, as Bernstein's source in
dicates, are they foolish enough to
imagine that a government which is
in full control of its armed forces can
be overturned by a Chilean-style sab
otage campaign.
The bellicose third alternative is
unpersuasive because the costs and
risks it entails are likely to be judged
by the Reagan administration as un
acceptably high. War in Central
America would unquestionably be
exhausting both economically and
militarily at a moment when the ad
ministration wishes to rebuild Ameri-

can military capabilities shattered by
the war in Vietnam. It also risks the in
troduction of Cuban troops into the
conflict and hence raises the ultimate
specter of a Soviet-American nuclear
confrontation, something which the
administration would want to avoid
in a situation of perceived strategic
weakness.
I would like to suggest that the real
aim of the Reagan administration is a
different one — it is to force the
Sandinista government to make a
sharp iurn to the left which can then
be construed in Washington as fulfill
ment of its own prophecy that leftist
revolutionary movements inevitably
become "totalitarian" and threaten
ing to the United States. The motive
of the administration in taking
such a course is not difficult to grasp.
For over a year now Reagan policy
makers have confronted a rising tide
of public and Congressional re
sistance which has blocked what they
consider to be an effective military
response to the Central American
crisis. Above and beyond the simple
fear among the public of a new Viet

nam-type involvement, the core of
that resistance has been sparked by a
minority of progressive-minded peo
ple who are genuinely sympathetic
to the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua and to other movements
in the region inspired by its example.
In order to discredit such people,
both here in the United States and
abroad, the Reagan administration
needs to "prove" that the Sandinista
government is not what its interna
tional supporters claim — a govern
ment of the tolerant, humane and
pluralist left — but a repressive Com
munist bogeyman. What better way
to do that, in the cynical calculus of
the right, than to provoke the FSLN in
self-defense to adopt a repressive
stance toward its domestic opposi
tion?
If such a result could be achieved,
the administration would have a
much freer hand to fashion its Cen
tral American policy in the aggressive
manner it prefers. In particular,
massive new commitments of mili
tary and economic aid for El Salvador
and Guatemala could be secured
from Congress as the U.S. govern
ment digs in for the long haul.
Although there are reasons to be
lieve such a strategy may backfire,
one must guard against assuming that
the Reagan administration cannot
succeed in its quest. Partly as a result
of the U.S. propaganda campaign
against it, international support for
the coalition government has been
badly weakened in recent months,
and administration policy-makers
undoubtedly believe they now have
the upper hand. If this conspiracy
(and one must not shrink from calling
it such) is to be foiled, it will require a
large new injection of public pres
sure and outrage on the part of the
American people.
Failure to exert that pressure at this
juncture may have the gravest conse
quences, for the covert actions now
underway have a potential for pro
voking a Nicaraguan-Honduran con
flict, a subsequent Cuban response,
and then a superpower confronta
tion whether the administration in
tends it or not.
What can we do to stop this?
We can get behind the bills which
have already been introduced in
both houses of Congress to require
legislative approval of both covert
operations and U.S. troop commit
ments in Central America. The re
spective sponsors are Christopher
Dodd (D-Conn.) and Paul Tsongas
(D-Mass.) in the Senate, Michael
Barnes (D-Md.) in the House.
Beyond demanding a cutoff of ec
onomic and military aid to the
Salvadoran junta, we can lobby for
the elimination of similar aid to Hon
duras, site of the planned operations,
as well as to every other Latin Ameri
can nation — Argentina, Chile, Co
lumbia and Venezuela are those
named thus far — that is suspected of
participating in them.
We can work actively to raise pub
lic awareness of the threatening im
plications of current U.S. policy, and
in particular to counter the adminis
tration's false and distorted
statements about what is happening
in Nicaragua.
