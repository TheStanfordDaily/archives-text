## Low-power TV coming 
### 
Washington — More than 5000
pioneers want to become the first
person on the block to operate their
very own television station.
The fst 1 week in March, the Feder
al Communications Commission de
cided which of these pioneers de
serves a low-power TV license.
Though still obscure, low-power
television is the latest hybrid of high
technology and government de
regulation. Two years ago, video
futurists theorized that the prolifera- 1
tion of stations with an estimated
range of about five square miles
could increase television's diversity
and create new media markets.
"Up to now, it's not been econom
ically feasible to have small television
operations," said Michael Couzens, a
former FCC officta! who now runs a
consulting firm here. "But these low
power stations are tremendously
cheaper, and that's the key to their
success."
Imagine it: by late 1983, hundreds
or community groups could be oper
ating locally-oriented television sta
tions and broadcasting original pro
grams or satellite feeds to an area the
size of a large state university cam
pus. Unlike cable TV, over-the-air
low power doesn't necessitate street
excavation; it also has the potential
of bettering larger metropolitan sta
tions in its attention to community
problems.
But the real promise of low-power
television may be the opportunities
for non-profit groups and minorities,
who have little voice in broadcasting
today. When the FCC first floated the
idea in September 1900, the agency
stipulated that civic groups in rural
and urban areas, as well as churches
and labor unions, receive first priori
ty in the issuance of licenses. Low
power would mean local access.
Low-power experts told our re
porter, Michael Duffy, that between
five and 15 new stations could be
created in such sprawling metropoli
tan areas as Houston and New York
City. While none could offer city
wide service, each could concentrate
on its natural constituency, broad
casting high school basketball games,
local city council meetings and the
like, adding relevance and a touch of
home to often impersonal television
programming.
In rural areas, meanwhile, low
power TV appeals particularly to the
hundreds of communities in the
mountain states which have never
had local programs (such stations
only relay programs from some

where else).
For viewers, the appeal of lower
power should be obvious. Indeed,
current applicants include represen
tation from a myriad of groups, rang
ing from the South Baptist Conven
tion to Alaskan Eskimos.
Said John Reilly, who runs Global
Village, a video promotional firm in
Manhattan: "Low power's only claim
to fame is programming. It will be
able to provide feedback within the
community, keep in touch with is
sues, and do it all with the impact of
television."
Not surprisingly, bigger companies
want a piece of the low-power ac
tion, with the prospect of creating
mini-monopolies. Their interest has
helped overwhelm the FCC's ability
to process applications. Since last
April, the agency has approved only
nine of 5100 low-power license ap
plications.
In January, the ifCC asked Con
gress to lay the ground rules for de
termining winners and losers in the
low-power scramble. Yet Congress
has refused, saying the FCC already
has enough guidelines.
But the real make-or-br point
for low power will come only when
the FCC confronts the contention by
many local broadcasters that low
power will cut into their market. As
FCC Commissioner Anne Jones told
delegates at the first low-power con
vention here last month: "Television
broadcasters are understandably
worried about the protection of their
existing coverage. If they prevail, it is
likely that far fewer low-power sta
tions could be licensed than was ori
ginally thought possible."
It would be a shame to see either
network affiliates or video
speculators undermine low power's
potential. Commercial interest could
effectively, if inadvertantly, create
clones of unimaginative, mass-mar
ket programming in low-power
form. The result would probably
shunt the most creative low-power
stations to rural areas, where fewer
minorities and non-profit organiza
tions are traditionally found.
If low power is to live up to its
potential, Houstonians and New
Yorkers should be given a place in
the low-power bonanza. Only then
would a so-called video revolution
take place.
