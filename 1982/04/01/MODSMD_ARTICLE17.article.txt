## Engineering classes undervalued 
### 
One of the greatest injustices at Stanford is the way
units are assigned to classes. There are almost no engi
neering courses worth more than three units, while it is
impossible to take an English course (beyond the
freshman English level) for fewer than five units.
A number of problems arise from this situation. First of
all, students are discouraged from taking English courses
(or history courses, or political science courses) because
a student who has 14 units is not willing to take a five-unit
course which would bring him up to 19 units. Second,
and more important, is the disproportionate amount of
work required, for a five-unit English or history course
compared with a three-unit engineering course.
A three-unit course is supposed to require nine hours
of work per week — three hours of class and six hours of
homework. By no stretch of the imagination have any of
the engineering or physics courses I have taken adhered
to this principle. The problem sets, plus 30-40 pages of
weekly textbook reading, necessitate that the student
keep up with the class. It is impossible to leave ail of the
reading for the last two weeks of the quarter, as is pos
sible, for example, in many Western Culture classes.
Many people have heard the story that some years ago
the Engineering Department wanted to require more
courses for engineering majors. The University refused
to allow them to require more units of engineering and
cognate subjects (math and science). The engineering
department won in the end by lowering the number of
units that each course was worth, thus enabling them to
require more courses for the same total number of units.
This situation is not fair to engineering students. It is
very difficult to take a quarter consisting of two engi
neering classes, a math class, a physics class and a lab —
14 units. Those four classes and the lab require much
more than 14 units of work — yet this is what many stu
dents must do.

Something should be done to remedy this situation.
Decreasing the number of University distribution re
quirements for engineers, as in exempting them from
the new language requirement (as has been suggested),
is not the answer. Engineers do not need fewer human
ities courses, they need fewer engineering, math, and
science courses. Either decrease the number of courses
required for the major, or increase the unit value of the
courses to bring them back to reality.
As things stand now, a student must begin taking the
courses for an engineering major in his freshman year. If
he does not, the next three years will consist of nothing
but courses required for the major — not an attractive
prospect. There is no room for experimenting with new
subjects (unless one wishes to take 20 units), which
makes it very difficult for students who are not sure what
engineering is what they want to do.
It is a no-win situation — you can't major in engineer
ing (and complete it in four years) unless you start in your
freshman year, and you then have no opportunity to ex
plore other subjects. It is very difficult for a student who
has decided upon engineering to pursue other interests.
The major requirements and distribution requirements
leave time for very few elective courses. This is extremely
discouraging to anyone who is interested in both engi
neering and humanities, and who also wishes to gradu
ate in four years.
This is a complex problem. The first step should be to
re-evaluate the number of units assigned to each class.
Right now, a look through Courses and Degrees reveafs
that Stanford feels that it is almost twice as hard to read a
book as it is to do problem sets. This is an unrealistic view,
and a sad commentary on the state of literacy in our soci
ety.
