## Aphorisms from Karl Kraus return to haunt 
### 
Here are a couple of aphorisms by
Karl Kraus who constantly criticized
the shallow rhetoric of politicans, of
ficial, journalists, etc. from the turn of
the century till the rise of Adolf
Hitler. Most of these pieces were
written during World War I, but un
fortunately they seem more timely
now than then:
How is the world ruled and led to
war? Diplomats lie to journalists and
believe these lies when they see
them in print.
If one speaks of a "war of quan
tities," one seems to acknowledge
the necessity of war as such, because

it may at least solve the problem of
overpopulation. But could this noble
purpose not be attained more pain
lessly by legalizing abortion?
"The prevailing morality," I can
hear this morality say, "would never
approve of this!" I didn't think it
would, because the prevailing moral
ity only approves of women having
children so that these can be torn to
bits by bombs.
War is, at first, the hope that one
will be better off; next, the expecta
tion that the other fellow will be
worse off; then, the satisfaction that
he isn't any better off; and, finally,
the surprise at everyone's being
worse off.
When the word "peace" was ut
tered for the first time, there was pan
ic at the stock exchange. They
screamed in pain: "We've been earn
ing! Leave us the warl We've earned
the warl"
What can be decided by a world
war? No more than that Christianity
was too weak to prevent it.
No, there won't be any scar left on
the soul. The bullet will have gone in
mankind's one ear and out the other.

Deafness often ignored
For a school which supposedly
ranks among the top five in the na
tion academically, Stanford certainly
does not know the full definition of
"handicapped." Surely blind and
crippled people are among the hand

icapped, but what about deaf, and
those who are both deaf and blind?
Unfortunately or fortunately, the
disabilities of the hearing impaired
often go unnoticed; and yet those
very physical limitations have equal
or more serious effects on the per
son's psychological, intellectual and
social states of being than other more
apparent handicaps. Hence, the deaf
tend to be forgotten, as noticed in
the full page titled "The Handi
capped" in March 4th's Daily, and
tucked neatly away in their world of
silence.
I think it is wonderful that Stanford
has provided wheelchair ramps, gym
modifications, and Braille in
elevators. But, what about telephone
amplifiers and flashing fire alarms (as
opposed to a bell which only alerts
the sleeping hearing person), just to
name a couple of aids for the deaf?
I think we deserve some credit. Un
like the blind and the crippled, for
whom profs can modify their
teaching habits or change their place
of instruction to a more convenient
location, no modification in instruc
tion will aid the deaf... it is up to the
hearing impaired to sit up front, to
get his own notes, and to bear with
that mumbler, this foreign prof, or
those softspoken lectures. And be
cause the deaf person seems to func
tion normally in most areas, other
people are reluctant or less inclined
to help in anyway.
I must admit, I have some wonder
ful friends, but even they do not un
derstand the difficulty of being hand
icapped — of being deaf. All I am re
questing is that you credit and ac
knowledge the hearing impaired just
as you do for other handicapped stu
dents at the Farm.
