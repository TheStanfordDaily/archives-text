# Fee assessment refunds secretly filmed for psych study
## Grad student in dept. calls clandestine film 'unethical' 
### loan O'Connell 
A television camera positioned
on a beam above the ASSU office
recorded the entire fee
assessment refund process last
quarter, with the film to be stud
ied in a "social behavior" experi
ment in the Psychology Depart
ment.
A graduate student in that de
partment related the incident to
the Daily, after what he called "re
peated attempts to convince cer
tain professors in the department
that using this tape without the
students' permission is unfair and
unethical."
"The film shows people looking
very sheepish about collecting
money," said Wes L. Bleuar, who
joined the department just last
quarter. "And some people are
doing things they obviously
would be embarassed about like
... well, you know, personal
things." Although he would not
elaborate on just what the in
criminating actions were, he said
his attempts to have the experi
ment cancelled were met with de
rision in the department.
"I think some people over there

view the film for kicks," he said.
The photograph accompanying
this story was on a roll of pictures
which a Daily photographer shot
during the refund period last
quarter. After Bleuar approached
the Daily we took another look at
the proof sheet and he pointed
out where the camera was posi
tioned.
Professors in the psych depart
ment were unwilling to comment
on the odd experiment, although
one said he "wished he had
thought of it."
Bleuar refused to provide
further details on which professor
was conducting the experiment,
only saying that it was someone
who "was interested in shy peo
ple."
One of the department's
highest profile re
searcher/professors, Philip Zim
bardo, who conducted the now
famous "prison experiment" in
1977 in which student volunteers
were "arrested" in their resi
dences and then locked up in the
basement of the psychology de
partment for several days, neither
confirmed nor denied his involve

ment.
Another professor, who also re
quested that his name not be
used, said he thought the idea was
"fascinating — something like
watching someone buy designer
clothing on sale," he said.
Several random students con
tacted said they were annoyed at
the clandestine filming.
"I can see why someone would
find this interesting but it's too

sneaky. What would be more in
teresting, though, would be to
study the effects of the refunds on
organizations' business managers
who wjtch their budgets eaten
away day by day."
ASSU Senate Rules Committee
Chairman jim McGrath said he re
membered workmen on ladders
beneath the area where the cam
era was placed, but was told they
were "just checking to see if a

smoke detector will fit."
Meanwhile Senator Roc
Blumenthal said, laughing, "We
told them not to put an alarm
there — with all the hot air in here
it would be going off all the time.
When they came back two weeks
later, we thought maybe they had
learned their lesson."
ASSU Senate Finance Chairman
Mark Epstein said, however, that
any students who fear that they

may be on the film should contact
him and that he would personally
accompany them to the Om
budsman's office.
Not all the research assistants in
the Psychology Department sup
port Bleaur's actions in releasing
information about the experi
ment, however. Cy Kade, another
graduate student, said "studies of
this nature are not only not new,
they are numerous."
