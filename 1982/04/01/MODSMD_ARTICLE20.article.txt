## Freshman views changing — politics moving right 
### Kathy Christie 
"The times they are a changin',"
sang Bob Dylan in the '60s. According
to a survey of incoming Stanford
freshmen, Dylan's words still hold
true.
The survey shows that not only are
Stanford students becoming more
conservative politically and socially,
but that the rate at which they are be
coming more racially diverse is
greater than that of most schools. In
addition, the survey shows that engi
neering as both a major and a career
is rapidly gaining in popularity.
According to the survey, incoming
freshmen here are becoming much
more politically conservative, al
though they remain slightly more lib
eral than their counterparts at other
schools. Most students talked to
agreed that this shift is not unique to
the college community but that it
"reflects the tide of the country," as
freshman Meri McCoy said.
"The reason that people became
more liberal is that they had to: they
were poor," postulated freshman
Neil Sobol, saying that we are becom
ing more conservative now because,
"There's a lot more middle class peo
ple now percentagewise ... there's
more demand for luxuries, not ne
cessities."

Mark Mitcheii, also a freshman,
proposed that the trend toward con
servatism is due to the fact that "peo
ple have realized the failures of liber
alism, and sense a need for more
practical measures."
Freshman Marissa Quiroz reflect
ed that at the moment, out society is
more future and goa!-oriented.
"People are out for themselves in the
way they vote," she said. As an after
thought, Quiroz expressed rear as to
what people acting ->o!ely out of self
interest will mean in the future.
The survey, which 1260 students
voluntarily participated in,, was con
ducted by the American Council on

Education and UCLA. Its results were
compared to both national averages
of students attending highly selective
private universities and to those of
the same survey conducted at Stan
ford in 1977.
The survey also revealed the fol
lowing concerning the social views of
incoming students:
• During the past five years, the
proportion of students naming rais
ing a family as a priority has risen
from 54 to 69 percent, and the
amount that feel that large families
should be discouraged dropped
from 74 to 53 percent.
• In the same time period, the pro
portion saying that sex is acceptable
if people like each other dropped
from 54 to 44 percent, and the pro
portion that feel that it is all right for
people to live together before mar
riage dropped from 54 to 46 percent.
• Nine out of 10 freshmen expect
to combine a career with marriage.
• Since 1978, the amount that feel
that marijuana laws should be more
liberalized fell from 58 to 34 percent.
Although very few students were
surprised at these findings, some, like
Meri McCoy, felt that what is implied
by them may not always be accurate.
In reference to students desiring
marriage, families, and careers, she

said, "People are more conscious of
what they want to do at an earlier age
— it is not necessarily so that more
people really want to raise a family."
With regard to sexual relationhips,
McCoy echoed Mark Mitchell's view
by saying that "People are more
aware of the problems of moral liber
ality due to the press it's gotten."
David Hayden, a freshman from
Princeton, N.J., said he sees Stanford
students as much more socially con
servative than the college students
back home. He said he feels that a
prime example of this is the fact that
he feels that there are a lot more
"partyers" there than there are here.

The survey also indicates that not
only is Stanford becoming more ra
cially diverse, but four out of five in
coming freshman have close friends
of a different ethnic background.
Approximately the same proportion
said that their friends include some
one from a different economic back
ground.
All of the sudents asked expressed
the belief that racial diversity is good
for the Stanford community, and sev
eral were interested in seeing how
close the percentage of each minor
ity in the population matches up to
the percentage here. McCoy said she
hoped that someday these per
centages will be the same.
As for the fact that four-fifths of the
incoming freshmen have friends of
different backgrounds, many
thought that this figure, although
probably accurate, was disappoint
ingly low.
Freshman John Kenagy said that in
viewing these figures, one must keep

in mind that one seldom chooses his
friends due to their backgrounds, but
that often the environment that one
lives in dictates this. For example, he
said that he was not exposed to many
minorities in his private high school,
so few of his friends were of minority
groups.
Even so, since coming to Stanford
he has gotten to know people of
many different races, and now
counts among his close friends peo
ple of different backgrounds.
None of the students spoken to
was at all surprised that engineering
had doubled in popularity for majors
and careers. Most agreed with David
Hayden's point that because the de
mand for engineers is so high, more
people are lured into the field. He
said he thinks that many people are
swept with the tide of engineering
because "it's the 'in' thing to do."
Linda Walden, also a freshman,
cited high salaries as the main attrac
tion to engineering for many stu-

Hayden said she felt that this
pragmatism concerning career
choices is also what causes as many
people to desire as many masters
degrees as the survey indicates. He
noted that the fact that more stu
dents plan to have more schooling
beyond the undergraduate level may
be why 9 percent fewer students felt
that a Stanford undergraduate
education would prepare them for a
satisfying job after graduation.
Yet not all freshmen are concerned
with the pragmatic aspects of engi
neering. Some, such as Doug Huff

man, "don't look at it for money." He
said what matters to him is that he is
happy, and he can be so if he is in a
field that heenjoys, such asengineer
ing.
John Boli, research coordinator in
undergraduate studies, said that in
terest in engineering has been in
creasing for a long time, and in fact
the rate of increase is actually declin
ing.
He also noted that because the
purpose of the survey is to show stu
dents' attitudes, its results will have
no bearing on any current or future
University policies."

NEW BEGINNINGS — Freshmen come to Stanford from a variety
of backgrounds and possess a wide range of attitudes, opinions,
and expectations. During their four year stay they encounter and
adopt many new ideas.
"The times they are a changin',"
sang Bob Dylan in the '60s. According
to a survey of incoming Stanford
freshmen, Dylan's words still hold
true.
The survey shows that not only are
Stanford students becoming more
conservative politically and socially,
but that the rate at which they are be
coming more racially diverse is
greater than that of most schools. In
addition, the survey shows that engi
neering as both a major and a career
is rapidly gaining in popularity.
According to the survey, incoming
freshmen here are becoming much
more politically conservative, al
though they remain slightly more lib
eral than their counterparts at other
schools. Most students talked to
agreed that this shift is not unique to
the college community but that it
"reflects the tide of the country," as
freshman Meri McCoy said.
"The reason that people became
more liberal is that they had to: they
were poor," postulated freshman
Neil Sobol, saying that we are becom
ing more conservative now because,
"There's a lot more middle class peo
ple now percentagewise ... there's
more demand for luxuries, not ne
cessities."

more future and goa!-oriented.
"People are out for themselves in the

thought, Quiroz expressed rear as to
what people acting ->o!ely out of self

The survey, which 1260 students
voluntarily participated in,, was con
ducted by the American Council on

Education and UCLA. Its results were
compared to both national averages
of students attending highly selective
private universities and to those of
the same survey conducted at Stan
ford in 1977.
The survey also revealed the fol
lowing concerning the social views of
incoming students:
• During the past five years, the
proportion of students naming rais
ing a family as a priority has risen
from 54 to 69 percent, and the
amount that feel that large families
should be discouraged dropped
from 74 to 53 percent.
• In the same time period, the pro
portion saying that sex is acceptable
if people like each other dropped
from 54 to 44 percent, and the pro
portion that feel that it is all right for
people to live together before mar
riage dropped from 54 to 46 percent.
• Nine out of 10 freshmen expect
to combine a career with marriage.
• Since 1978, the amount that feel
that marijuana laws should be more
liberalized fell from 58 to 34 percent.
Although very few students were
surprised at these findings, some, like
Meri McCoy, felt that what is implied

In reference to students desiring
marriage, families, and careers, she

said, "People are more conscious of

With regard to sexual relationhips,

David Hayden, a freshman from

students as much more socially con

back home. He said he feels that a

he feels that there are a lot more

The survey also indicates that not
only is Stanford becoming more ra

of a different ethnic background.
Approximately the same proportion
said that their friends include some
one from a different economic back
ground.
All of the sudents asked expressed
the belief that racial diversity is good
for the Stanford community, and sev
eral were interested in seeing how
close the percentage of each minor
ity in the population matches up to
the percentage here. McCoy said she
hoped that someday these per
centages will be the same.
As for the fact that four-fifths of the
incoming freshmen have friends of
different backgrounds, many
thought that this figure, although
probably accurate, was disappoint
ingly low.
Freshman John Kenagy said that in
viewing these figures, one must keep

in mind that one seldom chooses his
friends due to their backgrounds, but
that often the environment that one
lives in dictates this. For example, he
said that he was not exposed to many
minorities in his private high school,
so few of his friends were of minority
groups.
Even so, since coming to Stanford
he has gotten to know people of
many different races, and now

by saying that "People are more
aware of the problems of moral liber
ality due to the press it's gotten."
David Hayden, a freshman from
Princeton, N.J., said he sees Stanford
students as much more socially con
servative than the college students
back home. He said he feels that a
prime example of this is the fact that
he feels that there are a lot more
"partyers" there than there are here.

•Numbers are percentages

The survey also indicates that not
only is Stanford becoming more ra
cially diverse, but four out of five in
coming freshman have close friends
of a different ethnic background.
Approximately the same proportion
said that their friends include some
one from a different economic back
ground.
All of the sudents asked expressed
the belief that racial diversity is good
for the Stanford community, and sev
eral were interested in seeing how
close the percentage of each minor
ity in the population matches up to
the percentage here. McCoy said she
hoped that someday these per
centages will be the same.
As for the fact that four-fifths of the
incoming freshmen have friends of
different backgrounds, many
thought that this figure, although
probably accurate, was disappoint
ingly low.
Freshman John Kenagy said that in
viewing these figures, one must keep

in mind that one seldom chooses his
friends due to their backgrounds, but
that often the environment that one
lives in dictates this. For example, he
said that he was not exposed to many
minorities in his private high school,
so few of his friends were of minority
groups.
Even so, since coming to Stanford
he has gotten to know people of
many different races, and now
counts among his close friends peo
ple of different backgrounds.
None of the students spoken to
was at all surprised that engineering
had doubled in popularity for majors
and careers. Most agreed with David
Hayden's point that because the de
mand for engineers is so high, more
people are lured into the field. He
said he thinks that many people are
swept with the tide of engineering
because "it's the 'in' thing to do."
Linda Walden, also a freshman,
cited high salaries as the main attrac
tion to engineering for many stu-

dents.
Hayden said she felt that this
pragmatism concerning career
choices is also what causes as many
people to desire as many masters
degrees as the survey indicates. He
noted that the fact that more stu
dents plan to have more schooling
beyond the undergraduate level may
be why 9 percent fewer students felt
that a Stanford undergraduate
education would prepare them for a
satisfying job after graduation.
Yet not all freshmen are concerned
with the pragmatic aspects of engi
neering. Some, such as Doug Huff

man, "don't look at it for money." He
said what matters to him is that he is
happy, and he can be so if he is in a
field that heenjoys, such asengineer
ing.
John Boli, research coordinator in
undergraduate studies, said that in
terest in engineering has been in
creasing for a long time, and in fact
the rate of increase is actually declin
ing.
He also noted that because the
purpose of the survey is to show stu
dents' attitudes, its results will have
no bearing on any current or future
University policies."

NEW BEGINNINGS — Freshmen come to Stanford from a variety
of backgrounds and possess a wide range of attitudes, opinions,
and expectations. During their four year stay they encounter and
adopt many new ideas.
