# Residents' pride, hope spur E.P.A. move to incorporate
## 
### Jeff Golden 
Editor's note: This is the last in a series
examining the issue of incorporating
East Palo Alto. Controversy has long
plagued the move to make the com
munity into a city. Some want East Palo
Alto to continue on neighboring cities'
and county services. Others want
partial annexation with Menlo Park.
Studies have both questioned and sup
ported the effort towards incorpora
tion.
Difficult as they are to answer, ques
tions of viability, feasibility and af
fordability have dominated the public
debate over incorporation. To some ex
tent they camouflage other questions
that are at least as germane to the con
flict but harder to pursue. Information
sources that were helpful become reti
cent. Those that offer opinions general
ly don't want to be associated with them
in print.
There is, first of all, an undeniable
strand of racial conflict beneath the sur
face. It is particularly hard to examine
because it blends inseparably with eco
nomic and geographic differences. In
rough terms — the exact statistics have
not been compiled — the West
Bayshore has a whiter and more af
fluent population than the East
Bayshore.
The difference makes fertile ground
for charges and counter-charges. Some
incorporation supporters think the op
position of some westside property
owners comes from a distaste for
belonging to a "black" city. This, they
charge, is the real reason some west
siders crave annexation to Menlo Park,
which is mostly white. This is where ec-

onomics complicate the equation; ac
cording to two Palo Alio realtors, a giv
en westside property would have
greater value if the name of its city were
Menlo Park rather than East Palo Alto.
Westsider Am Cenedella, who is
white, denies that race considerations
lie behind his advocacy of annexation
to Menlo Park. He points to the
Bayshore "Six lanes of asphalt and
three cyclone fences" — as a natural
barrier between him and the bulk of
East Palo Alto. He also says he'd rather
join a city like Menlo Park with proven
management ability than be part of an
experiment whose leadership he ques
tions.
"Lots of the EPACCI push is from feel
ings of black nationalism, black pride,
black power," he says,"and that's fine.
But if it gets in the way of developing a
viable city, there's a problem."
He believes that it does get in the
way. Barbara Mouton, he claims, has
said that "Silicon Valley types" are not
welcome to settle in East Palo Alto.
(Mouton denies making that statement
or any remotely like it.) Cenedella takes
this to mean that the new city would
discourage the entrance of people who
are skilled, affluent, upwardly mobile,
and probably white. "Some of the Mu
nicipal Council members," he says,
"are counterproductive and unrealistic
in what they expect."
Another underlying theme suggests
that much of the fight against in
corporation comes from real estate in
terests who want a free hand to develop
expensive housing that will displace the
renters of East Palo Alto. Ted Hopgood,
a former Municipal Council member

who favors incorporation, says that the
"lord landlords" oppose a new city that
might prevent them from selling out to
developers.
"Incorporation would give us control
of what goes on here, would let us take
care of our own people," he said. "The
county don't care if people down here
get kicked into the streets."
The prospect of increased regulation
is the exact reason that some Palo Altans
plan to vote against incorporation.
"This thing is sheer folly," said a man
who runs a small business in his garage
east of the Bayshore. "The last thing we
need is another layer of government.
Twelve years ago this area was rural.
Now we're talking about putting anoth
er layer of bureaucracy in here, citifying
the place even more."
He added that the county either
didn't knowordidn't careabout histiny
business, and that a new city "would
probably come upwithall kindsof taxes
I'd have to pay."
He may be right. The regulation he
fears might be one small element of
what incorporation supporters say they
want: control of their own community.
"Regardless of whose house you live
in," said Barbara Mouton, "you don't
make the decisions unless it's your
house."
The appetite for local control takes
many forms. Don Miller, who has spent
nearly all of his 27 years in East Palo Alto,
is angry with police service in the area.
He says that county sheriff's deputies
recently subjected him and his wife to a
rough "harrassing" search as they were
driving home. Some weeks later, he
said, he waited for almost an hour for

deputies to come from Redwood City
after his house had been burglarized.
"And there wasn't nothing I could do
about it,"he said. "Things have got to
change around here. We have to be
come bosses of our own lives, get peo
ple proud of saying 'This is my town.' "
Miller is voting for incorporation.
If the city incorporates, Miller might
still have to deal with the same de
puties. Rather than start its own force, a
city of East Palo Alto would probably
contract with the county sheriff for po
lice services. But those for incorpora
tion believe their control over police
activity would increase. "It makes a big
difference," said Barbara Mouton,
"who signs the check."
Lee Robinson, a cabinetmaker who's
been in the community 30 years, has a
different concern but a similarsolution.
"My pet gripe," he said, "is all these
junk cars on the street. There's nobody
out here to do anything about it. Now,
that's just one of the things a city could
do. It'd do something nobody else
would: take a littje pride in what goes
on in East Palo Alto."
Pride, described in different words by
different people, is the tuel of the in
corporation drive. "The way things are,
nobody cares much about the neigh
borhood or each other," said David
Woods, a 15-year-old student at Foot
hill College. "Why should they? None
of this" — the sweep of his arm takes in
the street around him — "belongs to us.
What this vote could do is bring us all
together for the first time. Then it'd be
up to us to make this a fine place to
live."

CHANCE PENDING — Residents favoring incorporation
hope that a yes vote on April 13, will give citizens a new
pride in their community, (counter-clockwise from top

cars are eyesores that some proponents hope a city govern
ment could alleviate.
