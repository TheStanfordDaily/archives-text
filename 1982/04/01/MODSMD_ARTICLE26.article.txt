## Slam-dancing in the aisles: the B-52's fail to bomb 
### Don Willenburg Tony Kelly The B-52's 
San Francisco Civic Auditorium
13 March 1982
Who else but the B-52's
could write songs about an
cient civilization and science
fiction and sound unpreten
tious about both? Not David
Byrne, that's for sure. Still,
Byrne's influence, from giving
them exposure on his tours
with Talking Heads and pro
ducing their latest EP
Mesopotamia, kept the Geor
gia-cum-New York dance band
from joining the ranks of one
album new wave wonders. But
the en their o.vr, dre
around to simply have a good
time, once and for all. That's
what makes a concert, isn't it?
Some say yes, some say no.
Many of the complex sounds
and syncopations that mark the
EP are lost in concert, some
where between the band's
speakers and the echo off the
back wall. But that never
stopped anyone from dancing,
and it didn't stop the B-52's au
dience from doing a good bit
of bouncing off the walls,
either. The preferred course,
however, was bouncing off
each other. And with the right

music, what's wrong with that?
The B-52s make music to move
to, and if you happen to get a
little bruised, you shouldn't
complain. Ricky Wilson never
said that immersion in an
aesthetic experience was pret
ty. Besides, what's a little —
OK, a lot — of slam dancing
when our generation is staring
WW 111 in the face?
At the same time, no ration
alizations can hide a bad con
cert, and that's what the B-52's
gave the last two times they
landed on this side of the Ma
son-Dixon line. At those
shows, the band seemed too
dependent on the sheer force
of rhythm to excite people and
too shy to join in the fun them
selves. This same lackadaisical
spirit was all over the group's
second LP, Wild Planet, and
caused many observers to write
off the B-52's as a party that
should stay out of sight, not to
mention out of bounds.
Now the folks have dis
covered new toys, though.
Things like instruments — this
is the first time that the B-52's
have really been able to play
the axes they carry onstage.
Compare the bongos on
"Planet Claire" on the first
album (the only one that most

fans seem to know about), to
the percussion on
Mesopotamia — they may be
going backwards in time, but
they're definitely progressing
in musicianship.
Under Byrne's tutelage, the
B-52's have also discovered
that it's OK to write songs that
appeal to a more intelligent au
dience than tend to say, listen
to ZZ Top or read newspapers.
The lyrics are more sophisti
cated than in such efforts as
"Rock Lobster," a great song
but essentially a crustacean
"Monster Mash" as far as con
tent goes. True, "6060-842" is
no "Let's Get Physical," but
Mesopotamia combines the
B-52's ability to get the party
moving with Byrne's penchant
for searching out the sublime
in the mundane. "Cake" — not
quite the song Betty Crocker
would like to hear — and "Nip
it in the Bud" are two examples
that are receiving some Bay
Area airplay. That's what makes
a band worth listening to,
right?
What makes this band worth
watching is not exactly the
same as what makes them
worth listening to. The bouf
fant hairdos which gave the
band its name are legendary,

and watching them sway to
sounds you can't imagine com
ing out of Athens, Georgia is a
delightful contradiction. Cindy
Wilson did her best to squirm
out of a floor-length black se
quined gown without ever
once looking like she was
doing anything but having as
much fun dancing as we did
watching. Again, the incon
gruity fueled the excitement:
there was Cindy Wilson in her
formal gown and done-up hair
dancing on stage, and there
were the assorted punks,
posers, law students and vio
lence-prone fascist youth
sweating and slamming each
other into the ground. That's
what makes a, concert worth
going to, isn't it?
The B-52's have always been
for dancing, first and foremost,
and if there's an axiom in rock
music, it's that you can't
criticize a good beat (or in the
case of David Byrne and the
B-52's, beats). You won't get to
watch Ms. Wilson undulate if
you buy the record, but at least
you can dance this
Mesopotamia around.
And that's what makes
buying records worthwhile,
isn't it?
