# Dance turns to drama in SF
## 
### The Dance Theatre of Harlem Opera House/San Francisco by Mary Walp 
It has been only just recently that Dance
Theatre of Harlem has taken an interest in
dramatic ballets, enhancing their repitoire
which previously has been dominated by
plotess neoclassical works. Happily, they
are proving themselves capable in this new
direction.
The company gave an emotion-packed
performance of A Streetcar Named Desire
on Saturday, a premiere for San Francisco.
Lowell Smith was an outstanding Stanley
Kowalski, the headstrongbrother-in-lawof
the confused and tormented Balnche
Dußois. Smith gave us a Stanley who gets
what he wants in his world, the slum. A
poker game, his wife, antagonizing
Blanche — all is under Stanley's control.
Stanley's resentment of Blanche, which is
the foundation of the ballet, was the un
derlying force of his excellent dancing.
Blanche's suffering and efforts to escape
it were sensitively portrayed by Virginia
Johnson. Her relief when taken in by her
sister and Stanley's subsequent rejection
of her are painfully real. She desperately
flirts with any available man in her efforts

to escape her situation, but Stanley brings
to light her past and her gay dead husband,
eliminating any chance for her to escape.
There is a final pas de deux a confronta
tion between Stanley and Blanche, which
is especially moving. Smith, rough and piti
less, refuses to forgive his struggling sister
in-law.
Not only do these two ensure the suc
cess of Streetcar, but the supporting dan
cers also bring the situation alive. Elena
Carter, as Stanley's wife, who attempts a
reconciliation, brought the subtlety which
the role requires and the jazzy street peo
ple added the necessary guadiness of the
slum. Although the four figures of death
which introduce the scenes from
Blanche's past are a little contrived, this se
quence is full of spirited dancing and ex
cellent characterizations.
The Four Temperaments, an example of
what once dominated DTH's repetoire,
was also on Saturday's program. Although
Balanchine's interesting choreography is
evocative, the dancing on Saturday was a
little shaky and mechanical. DTH seems
to have neglected its neoclassical heritage
in making its move to dramatic works, leav
ing the dancers a little unsure in this ballet.

However, when the dancing did come to*
gether, as it did for several wonderful mo
ments, Temperaments was completely ab
sorbing. Cassandra Phifer provided many
of these moments with her brilliant tech
nique and enticing style.
Saturday's program closed with Troy
Game, an incredibly funny parody of 12
machos showing off their strength and
their bodies. The ballet is filled with
primitive hiprolling, stomping, arid"
clenched fists and caricatures of body
building showoffs.
From the opening, when three pairs of
men run and leap with a shout onstage, to
the very end, right up to the bows, Troy
Game joins with the audience in laughing
at itself. The men show off but Robert
North's choreography tells us that it is all in
fun — even though these men definitely
do have a lot to show off.
Had it not been for the humor, Troy
Game could have held its own merely by
the men's power and technical excellence.
However, North's choreography goes
much farther than a mere gymnastic dem
onstration. The men of DTH brought the
perfect touch of self confidence to the
ballet, ending Saturday's program with
a whimsical note.
