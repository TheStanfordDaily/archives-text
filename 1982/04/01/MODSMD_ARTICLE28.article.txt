The jazz/fusion world,
deathly ill with a disease called
monotony, was recently given
a shot in the arm. The medica
tion cartfe in the form of an in
vasion of quality new groups
onto the scene.
However, their contribution
does not center around the fact
that they are new bands— they
come a dime a dozen. Rather, it
is what these new name no
names bring with them that has
helped rescue fusion from its
musical doldrums.
Leading the way are three
new groups, with debut
albums on three different rec
ord labels, and featuring three
differing sounds. Azmuth
brings a Latin beat and brand of

jazs fusion. Pieces of a Dream
offers funk. And Software plays
more orthodox fusion with
"The Tube Sound" guitar.
Above all, the four have one
thing in common — they play
with the perserverance of old
pros.
To begin, let's talk Software. I
know, the name sounds like a
multi-million dollar corpo
ration in Silicon Valley. How
ever, Software does possess a
few similarities with the latter
assumption— at least from a
precision standpoint. The vari
ous elements of Software's mu
sic fit together like the intricate
parts of a silicon chip.
Software's debut LP, Marbles
is on a label recently estab
lished — Headfirst Records —
which includes the latest Brian
Auger release. Headfirst's
albums feature audiophile
pressing of a digital recording
and are distributed by MCA
corporation.
Software is your basic drums
bass- key boa rds-guitar-sax
ophone barroom band. Bill
Ruppert adds a personal touch
by playing electricand acoustic

guitars with "The Tube
Sound," achieved by filtering
his instrument through a syn
thesizer.
Marbles features a balanced
selection of fast and slow
fusion tunes, all sounding alike
and at the same time different
because of Ruppert's guitar ef
fects, giving Software a dis
tinctive sound.
Marbles consists of eight
tracks, during which Ruppert
and saxophonist Mark Colby
team up to play the melody in a
unique fashion. The best tune
on the LP's first side is "Back
Waters," a medium speed song
in which Ruppert demon
strates the ability to play both
acoustic and electric guitar
with equal brilliance. He uses
the acoustic instrument in an
innovative method that is
closer to funk than rock guitar.
On side two, "No War in
Russell Square' is by far the best
song, as it defines everything
Software is all about. The tune
has an extremely intense
bassline over which Ruppert
and Colby play emotional
solos. Colby, like Ruppert, has

his individual style which is just
as original as "The Tube
Sound" although his requires
no special electric equipment.
Ruppert and keyboardist Pat
Leonard write most of Soft
ware's tunes, but the other
three members each have a
hand in composing at least one
song. This brings up another
important point about Soft
ware — they are a five-person
group, and that's it. Marbles
does not feature appearances
by studio sessionists — the five
play on all eight songs, without
any outside help. Software is
going the make the big time
the hard way — they'll earn it.
Pieces of a Dream, however,
won't have to worry about
"earning" their way to the top.
They have outside help— from
the likes of Ralph Mac Donald,
Dexter Wansel, and producer/
accompanyist Grover Wash

ington.
The main body of this soul
fusion group consists of Curtis
Harmon (drums), James Lloyd
(keyboards), and Cedric
Napolean (bass). Pieces of a
Dream's claim to fame is the in
troduction of funk into fusion
on the soul side. Roughly half
their songs include vocals. But
the trio's obvious jazz back
ground prevails to separate
the band from an average soul
outfit.
Although Lloyd has magnif
icent solos on the untitled LP,
especially when playing a con
cert grand, Napoleon has the
most talent and unlimited
potential. He can switch from
the slapping, popping bass
technique of funk to one of
comptemporary jazz with rela
tive ease. "Steady Glide," as
the title indicates, is a jazzier
tune in which Napolean dem

onstrates the latter ability. He
"funks it up" in the LP's final
song, "Body Magic," one that
is by far the album's best.
Azmuth, a rare foreign band
on an American label, is a
fusion band with a "fusion" of
American and Latin influences.
The popping bass is a recog
nizable American technique,
while the heavy percussion
present in many of their songs
is undoubtedly South Ameri
can. The eight song album con
tains a variety of fast, slow, and
even folk tunes. However, Tel
ecommunication might have
too much variety, as the lis
tener's ear must adjust not only
to different songs, but different
types of songs.
Potential is the key word
here. Azmuth's baselines are
solid and at times even dan
ceable, but the solos they cover
them with require more de

velopment. Keyboardist Jose'
Bertrami needs to avoid
necessary repetition.
Of the four, Software and
Marbles is probably your best
bet, as it is an fine LP from be
ginning to end — worthy of
being an experienced group's
third or fourth release.
But if soul/funk/fusion is
your desire, buy Pieces of a
Dream. On the same token,
purchase Azmuth's Tele
communications if you enjoy
jazz/fusion of the Latin variety.
Still another alternative is to
save your money. However, if
you do that, the Fram oil filter
commercial comes into effect:
You can pay the record store
for the records now, or you can
pay them later. Because in a
few years these groups will no
longer be no names, but prom
inent figures in the jazz/fusion
world.
