# Students' stolen bikes recovered
## 
### 
Police said yesterday that at least 50
percent of all the bicycles which
Stanford students have reported sto
len in the past two years have been
located and that there is a good
chance students can recover their
bikes.
However, according to police de
tective Richard Tracy, who said they
had been investigating the trail of a
bike theft ring which has been at
work in the area for two years, the po
lice are not releasing details about
how they found the bikes, nor will
they release the location where the
more than 2000 bicycles are currently

being stored.
"They're all in one place, but none
of them are locked," said Tracy.
To claim their bikes, students who
have had a bike stolen should write
to the police department, describing
the bike, its serial number, the height
of its front tire and where they last
saw it.
"Because of the high number we
have recovered, we are asking that
no one call us, but drop us a note in
stead. No queries over the phone will
be handled," Tracy said. _
Tracy explained that at least 80per
cent of the bicycles stolen are stolen

through these rings and that "your
occasional 12-year-old who thinks
he's going to make some extra candy
money by ripping off bikes on cam
pus is usually set straight right away
by the professional thieves."
"We'd advise youngsters to get
their kicks somewhere else. They're
likely to get hurt playing with these
big boys/' Tracy said.
The detective added that all bikes
which are not claimed by June 1, will
be auctioned off, with the proceeds
to help defray the cost of the new Po
lice Contraband Warehouse which
was recently built in Redwood City.
