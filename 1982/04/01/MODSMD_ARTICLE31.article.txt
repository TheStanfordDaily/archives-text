It often seems that at Stanford, nothing is ever late. Don't have the
liquid assets to pay your tuition bill? Defer it! Don't have time to finish
that term paper? Turn it in latel Don't feel like studying for that final?
Take an incompletei There are never any penalties: one could almost
believe that at this University, the word "deadline" does not exist.
Almost. But if you represent a group requesting a fee assessment and
plan to seek a Daily endorsement, don't procrastinate. Today is the last
day to turn in a one-page statement and to sign-up for a Friday after
noon interview with the Daily editorial board. Sign-up sheets are lo
cated on the window of the Daily opinions office; give your statements
to Managing Editor Richard Klingler or leave them in his mailbox. No
deferments or incompletes: if you fail to meet the deadline, you lose
your chance to be endorsed. It's that simple.
Candidates for Senate, COP and senior class president have until
Tuesday, April 6 to turn in statements and make appointments. But we
encourage you to sign up and turn in a statement as soon as possible.
Eat, drink, pretend it's spring
Daily happy hour Friday at 5 p.m. Have a chip. A pretzel. A drink. Have
another one. One more and the sun will be out, the lake will be full and
everyone will be tan and beautiful. Rain: What better excuse for a hap
