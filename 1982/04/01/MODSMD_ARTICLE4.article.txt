Reagan turnaround brings education support
Washington — In a major policy reversal, President Ronald Reagan
yesterday affirmed his support for university education by promising to
restore loan and research funding in his proposed budget "to continue
the quality of learning that has made this nation great."
Reagan cited the need for "basic science funding to maintain the mili
tary strength of the nation in this time of peril.
"We cannot afford to strip away the source of leadership and techno
logical prowess as the very time America needs the products of its most
gifted citizens," he said.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) praised Reagan's initiative but, join
ing other Congressional sources, doubted the program's sincerity, in
stead linking it to efforts by Reagan to achieve other economic goals.
Mono-like VD epidemic hits Bay Area
Washington — The nation faces an epidemic of a new, presently in
curable form of venereal disease which has so far resulted in 197 near
deaths on the West Coast.
National Institute of Health officials said the new form, which has ap
peared in its most concentrated form in the San Francisco Bay Area, is
particularly hitting active, well-educated young adults in the 18-25 age
bracket."
Symptoms are similar to those which characterize mononucleosis, in
cluding "listlessness, failure to rise from the pavement, hypersensitivity
and a feeling of continuing weariness."
The disease was discovered when student Joan O'Connell's
"mononucleosis" failed to respond to conventional treatment.
