# Full-time hot water is 'too big a drain'
## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
Hot water will be shut off for all but
four hours each day in every Univer
sity residence except for dorm laun
dry rooms, where the hot water will
be permanently disconnected, as
part of a surprisingly radical program
designed to force students to con
serve energy.
Starting this evening, hot water will
be available only from 6-8 a.m. and
7-9 p.m. in dorm restrooms and
kitchens. Maintenance workers will
begin shutting off hot water connec
tions to laundry rooms at noon.
Row and Cluster Facilities Man
ager Heloisa Edwards, who ordered
the program, predicted that the
shorter shower hours will save the
University almost $1 * million this
year and up to $1.5 million next year.
"So much of the money we . pend
on hot water just goes down the
drain," Edwards told the Daily yester
day. "Those extra minutes in the
shower really add up, and the Uni
versity pays."
The program, ordered by Edwards
after "the failure of more subtle
methods," was tested in Cowell

Cluster houses yesterday. Though
Edwards termed the experiment a
"huge success," the shower lines in
cluster houses snaked down
hallways.
As 8 a.m. neared, residents at the
end of the line in Alpha Sigma house
realized that they weren't going to
get a hot shower and began shouting
at sophomore Diane Johnson and
banging on the bathroom door.
Johnson was taking Alpha Sig's last
hot shower till 7 p.m.
"What do you think this is, a ho
tel?" junior Karen Springen yelled to
Johnson. Springen was next in line
when the hot water quit at 8:04 a.m.
"This is ridiculous," Springen said
when the yelling and banging
stopped. "Diane and I are friends.
Maybe I'll move off campus."
Johnson was apologetic and prom
ised not to shower today so others
could have a chance." feel terrible,"
she told the Daily as she combed her
wet hair. "Something like this could
really divide the house."
Housing Management Director Ed
Scoles agreed with Edwards that the
program would save money, but said

that the amount would be closer to
$950,000. "We may have to com
pensate by turning up the heat a few
degrees," he said, "and that will eat
into the savings a bit."
Edwards made headlines in Febru
ary when she ordered the heat
turned off in most Row and cluster
houses. After one day, cold weather
and a flood of complaints forced Ed
wards to turn the heat back on.
But Edwards said she won't be as
responsive to turning the hot water
on. "There are plenty of showers in
every dormitory hallway and four
hours is plenty of time for every stu
dent to take a shower almost every
day," she said. "No one should take
more than four or five minutes in the
shower. Extras like shaving legs in the
shower and fancy cream rinses will
just have to stop."
University administrators agree
that the plan will save money, but
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
had other concerns. "Sure, we'll save
a lot of money. And we'll save even
more when we close the place down
because no one wants to come to
Stanford anymore. The sale of the

land will probably start a housing
boom and the buildings and office
and lab equipment will bring in mil
lions.
"But seriously," he continued, "I
expect our applicant pool to shrink
significantly next year, probably to
9000-10,000." About 14,000 people
applied for admission to the Univer
sity last year.
Edwards said her decision to shut
off hot water to student laundry
rooms was based on consultations
with detergent manufacturers and
the Web Company, which supplies
the University with coin-cperated
washers and dryers.
"Nothing really has to be washed
in hot water. A good cold water de
tergent and presoak will get out
blood, grease, makeup, grass stains
— anything," she said. '
Local laudromat owners Dick and
Isabel Tyde were jubliant when they
heard that students would have to go
off campus for a hot water wash.
"We're going to order three or four
new machines to handle the extra
customers,"Mrs. Tyde told the Daily .

Johnson. Springen was next in line
when the hot water quit at 8:04 a.m.
"This is ridiculous," Springen said
when the yelling and banging
stopped. "Diane and I are friends.
Maybe I'll move off campus."
Johnson was apologetic and prom
ised not to shower today so others
could have a chance." feel terrible,"
she told the Daily as she combed her
wet hair. "Something like this could
really divide the house."
Housing Management Director Ed
Scoles agreed with Edwards that the
program would save money, but said

that the amount would be closer to
$950,000. "We may have to com
pensate by turning up the heat a few
degrees," he said, "and that will eat
into the savings a bit."
Edwards made headlines in Febru
ary when she ordered the heat
turned off in most Row and cluster
houses. After one day, cold weather
and a flood of complaints forced Ed
wards to turn the heat back on.
But Edwards said she won't be as
responsive to turning the hot water
on. "There are plenty of showers in
every dormitory hallway and four
hours is plenty of time for every stu
dent to take a shower almost every
day," she said. "No one should take
more than four or five minutes in the
shower. Extras like shaving legs in the
shower and fancy cream rinses will
just have to stop."
University administrators agree
that the plan will save money, but
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
had other concerns. "Sure, we'll save
a lot of money. And we'll save even
more when we close the place down
because no one wants to come to
Stanford anymore. The sale of the

land will probably start a housing
boom and the buildings and office
and lab equipment will bring in mil
lions.
"But seriously," he continued, "I
expect our applicant pool to shrink
significantly next year, probably to
9000-10,000." About 14,000 people
applied for admission to the Univer
sity last year.
Edwards said her decision to shut
off hot water to student laundry
rooms was based on consultations
with detergent manufacturers and
the Web Company, which supplies
the University with coin-cperated
washers and dryers.
"Nothing really has to be washed
in hot water. A good cold water de
tergent and presoak will get out
blood, grease, makeup, grass stains
— anything," she said. '
Local laudromat owners Dick and
Isabel Tyde were jubliant when they
heard that students would have to go
off campus for a hot water wash.
"We're going to order three or four
new machines to handle the extra
customers,"Mrs. Tyde told the Daily .
