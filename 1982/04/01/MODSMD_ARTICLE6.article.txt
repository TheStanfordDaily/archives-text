# First vote on animal bill disappoints University
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
The University has lost the first
round in its battle against a bill which
would prohibit the use of stray
animals in research. The bill passed
the California State Senate's Local
Government Committee 4-1 with
one absence and one abstention yes
terday.
University Medical Center officials
and President Donald Kennedy, as
well as a number of prominent uni
versity researchers throughout the
state, have adamantly opposed the
bill which would cost the University
an additional $195,000 a year, accord
ing to John Brown, a representative
of the Association of California Uni

versities. The bill would force re
searchers to buy the animals from
private breeders instead of from
pounds, where they now obtain
them at comparatively low prices.
The bill, introduced by State Sen.
David Roberti (D-L.A.), senate presi
dent pro tern, is supported by several
television celebrities and health ex
perts who maintain that the animals,
many of them strayed from owners,
are being mistreated at research fatil
ities.
The bill would make it illegal for
pounds to sell or give animals to any
research facility. The pounds now
provide these facilities with animals,

Further research involving animals from Humane Societies may soon
be inhibited by a bill that is has been proposed in the Calfornia legis
lature. Stanford researchers have used animals from Humane Socie
ties for many years.
