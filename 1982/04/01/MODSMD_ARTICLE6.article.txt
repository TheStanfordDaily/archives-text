# First vote on animal bill disappoints University
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
The University has lost the first
round in its battle against a bill which
would prohibit the use of stray
animals in research. The bill passed
the California State Senate's Local
Government Committee 4-1 with
one absence and one abstention yes
terday.
University Medical Center officials
and President Donald Kennedy, as
well as a number of prominent uni
versity researchers throughout the
state, have adamantly opposed the
bill which would cost the University
an additional $195,000 a year, accord
ing to John Brown, a representative
of the Association of California Uni

versities. The bill would force re
searchers to buy the animals from
private breeders instead of from
pounds, where they now obtain
them at comparatively low prices.
The bill, introduced by State Sen.
David Roberti (D-L.A.), senate presi
dent pro tern, is supported by several
television celebrities and health ex
perts who maintain that the animals,
many of them strayed from owners,
are being mistreated at research fatil
ities.
The bill would make it illegal for
pounds to sell or give animals to any
research facility. The pounds now
provide these facilities with animals,

lature. Stanford researchers have used animals from Humane Socie
ties for many years.
mostly cats and dogs, for about $10
each instead of killing them.
Having passed the Local Govern
ment Committee, the bill must now
be approved by the Senate Finance
Committee, Senate floor, two com
mittees and the floor of the State As
sembly.
Proponents, such as Lori Hall, a
California health technician, have
supported the bill because of reports
that the researchers are conducting
cruel experiments on the animals.
Actress Loretta Swit of the television
series "M.A.S.H." has publicly sup
ported the bill because she has seen
films which showed dogs allegedly
given cancer and bleeding ulcers,
and cats whose brains and sex organs
had been mutilated in research.
Larry Horton, director of govern

ment relations in the University of
fice of public affairs, denied that
abuses such as these exist at campus
facilities. He added that mistreat
ments elsewhere were rare and not
as severe as the bill's supporters have
suggested.
"These abuses should be punished
if they exist," he said.
University officials have con
tended that the bill, if passed, would
actually be more cruel to the animals
because a larger number of them
would be killed in the animal
shelters.
"The research which is taking
place now benefits both men and
animals," Horton said. He also
pointed out that the animals are
being kept alive longer now than
they would be if left in the shelters.
He said that if the bill passes,
private breeding colonies would be
established to produce the needed
animals. These animals would be

more expensive than those provided
by the pounds and the abundance of
animals would result in more being
killed, Horton said.
Horton and other University of
ficials also maintain that proponents
of the bill do not want to stop the mis
treatment of the animals, but instead
want to eliminate altogether the use
of animals for research.
According to Brown, researchers
have- approached Roberti with
amendments which would require
certain standards to be placed on re
search facilities to protect animals
from mistreatment. Roberti has re
fused to allow any amendments, ac
cording to Brown.
Hoping to compromise with pro
ponents of the bill, Brown and Uni
versity representatives will attempt to
attach a number of amendments to
the bÂ«ll i ( they cannot defeat it.

Three amendments have been
proposed by the University. The first
amendment would exclude pets
from research. University officials
contend that only 10 percent of the
animals taken in by the pounds are
pets.
The second would demand that a
facility meet standards set by the Na
tional Institute of Health before it
uses animals for research.
The third would limit the amount
and kinds of multiple surgeries per
formed on the animals.
Brown said that he thinks the bill
will be defeated eventually but
added that it would be difficult to de
feat because of Roberti's influence as
president pro tern of the Senate.
An identical bill was defeated in
the first committee when it was pro
posed two years ago.
