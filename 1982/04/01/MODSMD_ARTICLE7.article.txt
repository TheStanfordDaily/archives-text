# Faculty retirement plan being revised
## 
### Karen Springen 
The University's faculty retirement program is
in the process of changing. Changes already in
effect include an increase in mandatory retire
ment age from 65 to 70; a 1 percent decrease in
participants' contributions to the retirement
plan (from 6 percent of their annual salary to 5
percent); and a change in the early retirement
plan.
According to Gerald Lieberman, dean of grad
uate studies and research, professors cannot re
ceive retirement benefits until after age 62, rath
er than 58, under the new plan. But under the
new plan, benefits are indexed according to the
cost of living.
Robert Butler of the Med School added that
benefits now continue on to a faculty member's
spouse after his death.
According to Benefits Office Manager Jeannie
Thomas, the University particularly encourages
part-time retirement. "There's a flexibility
there," she said.
Lieberman classified part-time retirement as
"an issue we haven't really faced yet." Plans are
not yet finalized.
Recall status will continue as before. Retired
professors may teach if invited to do so by their
department. When under recall status, pro
fessors may opt to receive both retirement bene
fits and salary, said Thomas.
Retired professors retain access to the libraries
and athletic facilities. In addition, some depart
ments have sufficient space to provide emeriti
with offices. But Humanities and Sciences Dean
Norman Wessells said that lab space can pose a
real problem in physics and biology.
According to Rick Biedenweg of the Office of
Management and Budget, faculty here retire un
der conditions similar to employees at IBM and
other major corporations.
Participating faculty presently contribute 5
percent of their annual salary to the University's
principal retirement program, the Teachers In
surance and Annuities Association and the Col

lege Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF), and
the University provides an amount equivalent to
10 percent of their salary.
TIAA is invested in fixed income while CREF
fluxuates with the stock market. "The speculative
people have CREF," said Biedenweg.
If 7-8 percent inflation continues, the purchas
ing power of the TIAA-CREF pension will be cut
in half within 10 years. Most participants may ex
pect to receive about 40 percent of their final
salary at retirement after 30 years of contribu
tions to the programs, according to an analysis
presented in the final report on the Task Force on
Retirement Policies.
According to Biedenweg, designer of the early
retirement program, "It's not always beneficial
to be enrolled in the program." He said the pro
gram is designed to "protect you from yourself."
Biedenweg said the Faculty Retirement Task
Force is working on an inflation-fighting retire
ment package. He emphasized that inflation is
"not as serious a problem as one might think."
He cited the equity most professors own on high
priced Palo Alto real estate. "They've got signifi
cant assets."
Most participants initially opt for a mixed
TIAA-CREF package. According to Briedenweg,
TIAA has performed better than CREF over 10 of
the past 12 years. He added that he uses neither
TIAA or CREF.
Prof. Kenneth Scott of the Law School said,
"The Stanford program is similar to most univer
sities in that it has one arrangement." The Uni
versity of Rochester, the University of Chicago
and Cal Tech have departed from the TIAA-CREF
program, however.
Thomas stressed the advantage TIAA-CREF of
fers as "a portable plan." A professor who
transfers from Harvard to Stanford retains his
former benefits under the national plan.
Although about 95 percent of the University's
full-time professors participate in TIAA-CREF,
approximately one-half of the assistant pro

fessors and one-fifth of the associate professors
choose not to. Faculty are not required to partici
pate.
According to Thomas, younger professors
often want their full salary now, she said. "Under
age 40 seems far away."
But according to Thomas and Briedenweg, the
retirement program should improve. Thomas
said the University will probably implement
more investive vehicles than the nation-wide
TIAA-CREF. An ad hoc committee on alter
natives in retirement funds has submitted about
10 suggestions.
One proposed alternative is a retirement an
nuity based on money market fund investments,
which would give a lower long-term expected
rate of return than an equity-based fund, but also
would pose less risk while tracking inflation bet
ter than equity funds, said Scott.
Economics Prof. Victor Fuchs said he finds
TIAA-CREF to be a fair system. "Some people
have been unduly critical." But he added that the
University is "moving in the right direction" in
broadening the retirement program.
Faculty members disagree on the issue of man
datory retirement. While Prof. Bernard Roth,
mechanical engineering, and Prof. Ronald
Rebholz, English, criticize the program, other
professors including Herbert Lindenberger, Eng
lish, and Carl Degler, have stressed the im
portance of maintaining a flow of younger facul
ty-
According to Biedenweg, the University antic
ipates a 35 percent reduction in incoming faculty
next year. He indicated a preference for the
mandatory retirement age. "Most faculty mem
bers tend to indicate they want to stick it out."
Fuchs also favored the mandatory retirement
age. Without mandatory retirement, colleagues
would have to review each other.
Biedenweg said, "It's very difficult for faculty
members to judge each other. It's sort of like tak
ing one of your friends and putting him in
ari insane asylum."
