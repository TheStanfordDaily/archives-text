# Activists to speak during Disorientation Week
## 
### David Azrin 
Disorientation Week, a six-day
program of symposia, workshops and
discussion aimed as a response to the
Reagan administration's current pol
icies, will begin at noon today with a
rally in White Plaza.
The program, sponsored by the
Stanford Progressive Alliance,
SWOPSI, the ASSU Speaker's Bureau,
and the Stanford Committee on Polit
ical Education (SCOPE), will address a
variety of issues including military
policy, civil rights, the labor move
ment, the media, Reaganomics, and
violence.
The list of speaker's includes some
of President Ronald Reagan's most
outspoken critics. Those scheduled
to speak are consumer advocate

Ralph Nader, economist John Ken
neth Galbraith, activist Angela Davis,
Mother /ones Editor David Talbott,
Democratic Socialist Organizing
Committee (DSOC) Chairman
Michael Harrington, and Native
American leader Dennis Banks.
The symposia and workshops will
not center on one specific issue, but
will link many issues under a broad
theme. For example, Tuesday's pro
gram entitled "Liberation Struggles"
will Heal with gay rights, U.S. milita
rism, and the labor movement.
Michael Lighty, co-director of
SWOPSI and program organizer, said
he hopes participants in the program
will "begin to formulate alternatives
to Reaganism."
"We want to bring different

groups together and emphasize their
shared interest for social change. The
context has been provided by the
Reagan administration," Lighty said.
Jim Steyer, a second-year law stu
dent and the program's organizer,
hopes the activities will help "show
the different groups that they are
fighting the same struggle."
"We're trying to get everybody to
get out and talk to each other and
have a good time. But there's got to
be a follow-up. The people can't go
home and crawl back into their own
little hole. They've got to realize
there's something they can do."
Lighty said he hopes to see a new
student-community-labor coalition
begin to emerge which may "better
articulate a progressive response to

Reaganism and the New Right."
The week's prominent speakers
were made possible by "connec
tions" certain members of the or
ganizing committee have with many
of the invited guests and the willing
ness of some guests to settle for less
money than they normally request.
Galbraith will be receiving only
travel expenses with no honorarium.
Students' ties with Nader, Her
rington, and Galbraith helped ensure
their appearance.
Regardless of these breaks in ex
penses, Steyer is still afraid the spon
soring organizations may end up
going over their budget. But he
quickly added that the deficit "will
certainly not be one like Reagan's."
