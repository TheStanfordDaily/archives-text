Reagan announces new nukes policy
Washington — Declaring that the Soviet Union has "a definite margin
of superiority/' President Ronald Reagan last night rejected an im
mediate freeze of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles.
Reagan told a nationally televised news conference such a proposal,
now pending in Congress, would be dangerous to the United States and
would remove any incentive for the Soviet Union to negotiate substan
tial cutbacks in superpower nuclear arsenals.
Reagan instead gave his support to another proposal calling for a
freeze only after the United States has closed the gap in weapons areas
where the administration says the Soviets have an edge.
"We cannot afford to repeat past mistakes/' Reagan said in apparent
reference to past agreements with the Soviets that he and other critics
claim forfeited advantages to the Kremlin.
He invited the Soviet Union "to join with us now, to substantially re
duce nuclear weapons and make an important breakthrough for lasting
peace on earth."
At present, he said, the Soviet Union "does have a definite margin of
superiority, enough so that there is risk and there is what I have called
several times a window of vulnerability." 1
The resolution rejected by Reagan is sponsored in the Senate by Mark
Hatfield, a senior Republican from Oregon, and Edward Kennedy (0-
Mass.) It is supported primarily by liberals and has 24 Senate signatures.
The rival resolution that drew his backing already has a majority of the
Senate. It is being pushed mostly by such defense-minded senators as
John Warner (R-Va.) and Henry Jackson (D-Wash.)
