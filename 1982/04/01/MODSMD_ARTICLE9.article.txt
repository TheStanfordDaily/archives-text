Reagan announces new nukes policy
Washington — Declaring that the Soviet Union has "a definite margin
of superiority/' President Ronald Reagan last night rejected an im
mediate freeze of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missiles.
Reagan told a nationally televised news conference such a proposal,
now pending in Congress, would be dangerous to the United States and
would remove any incentive for the Soviet Union to negotiate substan
tial cutbacks in superpower nuclear arsenals.
Reagan instead gave his support to another proposal calling for a
freeze only after the United States has closed the gap in weapons areas
where the administration says the Soviets have an edge.
"We cannot afford to repeat past mistakes/' Reagan said in apparent
reference to past agreements with the Soviets that he and other critics
claim forfeited advantages to the Kremlin.
He invited the Soviet Union "to join with us now, to substantially re
duce nuclear weapons and make an important breakthrough for lasting
peace on earth."
At present, he said, the Soviet Union "does have a definite margin of
superiority, enough so that there is risk and there is what I have called
several times a window of vulnerability." 1
The resolution rejected by Reagan is sponsored in the Senate by Mark
Hatfield, a senior Republican from Oregon, and Edward Kennedy (0-
Mass.) It is supported primarily by liberals and has 24 Senate signatures.
The rival resolution that drew his backing already has a majority of the
Senate. It is being pushed mostly by such defense-minded senators as
John Warner (R-Va.) and Henry Jackson (D-Wash.)
"This is an important move in the right direction," Reagan
said of the Warner-Jackson resolution. He cited its call for
major, verifiable reductions in U.S. and Soviet nuclear weap
ons to equal force levels.
Struggle continues in Salvador
San Salvador, El Salvador — President Jose Duarte and his
Christian Democratic Party yesterday called a mass /ally for
tomorrow to underline their public support as the four right
wing parties that have emerged from elections as' he domi
nant political force continued to maneuver for a govern
ment that would exclude Duarte.
In his first public appearance since the vote, Duarte ar
rived at a "victory dance" at his party headquarters yesterday
afternoon to announce, amid shouting, tearful supporters,
that "the country went out in the streets to vote, the country
decided to back the solution that we, the Christian Demo
crats, have presented." But he warned, "There remain some
who have not understood ...
"They are making errors that can put the stability of the
country in danger," Duarte continued. "We are going to the
public."
As the Christian Democrats sought to preserve a measure
of power and influence, the final, as yet uncertified, vote tal
ly from Sunday's elections gave the conservative parties a
majority of 36 seats in the 60-member constituent assembly
against the 24 of Duarte's party. The percentage breakdown
of the vote remained roughly as it it stood throughout the
count, 40.7 percent for the Christian Democrats — a 10-point
lead over the second-place party of ex-major Roberto
D'Aubuisson and far ahead of the other parties to the right.
D'Aubuisson's party won 19 seats and is contesting two
more unofficially alloted to smaller conservative groups. The
official party that ran the country's politics for the military
and the economic elite from 1961 to 1979, National Concilia
tion, took 14 seats while the more moderate Democratic Ac
tion party got two and the Salvadoran Popular Party got one,
according to the president of the Central Elections Council,
Jorge Bustamante.
Senate votes quick funding
Washington — After a two-day session that one senator
compared to a Marx brothers movie, the Senate approved a
stop-gap measure yesterday that will continue funding for
most of the federal government until Sept. 30.
In a series of maneuverings, senators also avoided another
confrontation over busing while managing to keep a con
troversial tax break.
The funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, was
approved just hours before yesterday's midnight expiration
of approprations for seven major federal departments.
The stop-gap measure, which won House approval March
24, continues funding at the current $410.8 billion level

through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 1982 for the depart
ments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services,
Treasury, Justice, Commerce and State.
" I haven't had that much fun since I saw the Marx Brothers
in 'A Night at the Opera,' " Sen. William Proxmire (D-Wis.)
said after the Senate leadership succeeded in preventing
renegade senators from burdening the bill with con
troversial amendments.
The dispute over whether to repeal the House and Senate
members' new $75-a-day tax deduction for legislative days in
Washington led to an extraordinary late-night debate Tues
day, punctuated with shouting matches, self-admitted em
barrassment and colorful rhetoric.
The tax wrangle was resolved in relative calm yesterday af
ter the Senate leadership devised a series of face-saving par
liamentary votes.
Reagan praises El Salvador
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yesterday praised
the turnout in the El Salvador elections as proof that "the
Salvadoran people have clearly repudiated violence," but
administration officials continued to dodge questions about
what the United States will do if a right-wing government
wins power there.
To underscore its contention that the elections signaled a
"commitment to a democratic future," the administration
released a letter of congratulation from Reagan to the
Salvadoran people and staged a White House news con
ference with members of the U.S. delegation that observed
Sunday's voting.
However, the observers found their attempts to describe
their impressions of the balloting turned aside as reporters
shouted demands for the administration to clarify whether it
will continue U.S. military and economic support to El
Salvador if the new government is controlled by rightist
forces such as the extremist political leader Roberto
D'Aubuisson.
The observers and administration officials replied that
such questions are premature and argued that it would be
wrong to prejudge efforts now underway to form a govern
ment. Everett Briggs, deputy assistant secretary of state for in
ter-American affairs and one of the architects of the'adminis
tration's Central America policy, said:
Civil defense debated
Washington — A senior Pentagon official who in the past
has downplayed the potential consequences of nuclear war,
saying many could survive it, retreated before a hostile Sen
ate committee yesterday and testified that neither super
power could win such a conflict.
T.K. Jones, deputy undersecretary of defense, joined assis
tant secretary of Defense Richard Perle in an effort to per
suade skeptical senators that the Reagan administration

shared their abhorrence of nuclear war and did not consider
one winnable.
In the course of a testy hearing lasting more than three
hours, however, Jones was pushed into reiterating
statements he has made in the past, including the contention
that because of Soviet civil defense preparations, 98 percent
of the Soviet population could survive an all-out attack by
American nuclear forces. Other experts have calculated that
the Soviets would lose 50 to 100 million people in such an at
tack.
Israeli army aids evacuation of Sinai
Yamit, Occupied Sinai — Israeli troops tightened their grip
on the volatile settlements in northern Sinai yesterday, the
last day for civilians to depart before Israel returns the terri
tory to Egypt on April 25.
Soldiers with weapons patrolled the streets of Yamit as
truckloads of household goods, irrigation pipes and farming
gear headed north. The army closed off three other settle
ments as soon as they were empty, and guards were posted
to keep squatters and thieves from entering.
Most, but not all of Yamit's 2000 settlers were leaving
before the midnight deadline.
"The army will have to take me by the ear and drag me
away," said a young bank clerk who the day before had
chased two visiting Egyptian bankers out of his branch. The
clerk said he couldn't bear the thought of Egyptians taking
over his office.
Market slow as quarter ends
The stock market closed out an uninspired first quarter of
1982 with a mixed showing yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 1.72 to
822.77, leaving the average with a net loss of 52.23 points for
the first three months of the year.
Yesterday's gold quote was $320 the troy ounce.
Storm hits West, rain ahead

possibility of hail through tommorrow. Partly cloudy with
chance of more showers tomorrow night and Friday. Lows
mid 30s lo low 40s, highs 40s to mid 50s. Snow level 1000 feet.
Gale warnings posted for northwesterly winds 20 to 40 miles

The death toll of the present storm is at least three. Two
people were killed in an avalanche at the Alpine Meadows
ski resort. A third victim drowned when her car slid off a
street into a rain-swollen creek in Suisan City.
Dozens of residents in San Jose took shelter with neigh
bors after fire officials warned a creek was flooding. Mean
while, hundreds remain snow-bound in their Tahoe Basin
lodgings as road crews struggle to clear mountain passes
where snow continues to fall at up to a foot an hour.
