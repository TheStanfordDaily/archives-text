i RESTAURANT 1
The Stanford Daily says: ,)
1 "La Estrellita features a classic Mexican J
menu which includes everything from 1
exquisite tacos to exotic dishes like chalupas. J
, The restaurant specializes in five different V
kinds of burritos. Tnese are not, however, the J
i average Taco Bell variety which can be eaten \
in four bites. These burritos are well over a 112
i foot long and a meal by themselves. In J
I addition to their famous burritos, the owner 112
i recommends suizas, enchiladas made with 1
chile sauce and covered with guacamole and I
i sour cream; chimichangas, a flour tortilla 1
112 filled with shredded beef and topped with I
1 guacamole and sour cream; and for 1
I vegetarians, one of their many tostadas, all C
1 served on large platters in very generous 1
I portions guaranteed to satisfy even big I
1 appetites. 112
I This restaurant has an informal, relaxed %
# atmosphere. The white-walled interior, J
candlelit tables and handmade Mexican decor \
create the unpretentious ambience found #
( south of the border. We highly recommed \
I Estrellita.'' . J
