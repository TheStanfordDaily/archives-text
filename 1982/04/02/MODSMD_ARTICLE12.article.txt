# New summer policy
## 
### Eric Lim 
Access to the University's
pool and gym facilities will
be opened up to regular
University students not reg
istered for classes who will
be staying in the area this
summer, following a de
, cision by the athletic dept..
In a March memo to the
ASSU Senate, Athletic Dept.
Recreation Coordinator
Shirley Schoof, outlined the
new recreation policy for
this summer. Effective June
21, the first day of summer
quarter, students pres
enting valid spring or sum
mer identification will be al
lowed use of the pools and
gyms.
The DeGuerre squash,
handball and racquetball
courts will, however, be
open only to persons hold
ing summer ID due to the
severe space limitations of
those facilities.
Schoof's memo brings to
a full circle a dialogue in
itiated by the ASSU. In pre
vious years, students who
stayed at Stanford during
the summer to work or to
pursue other non-academic
activities payed $15 for pool
privileges. Acting on stu
dent complaints about the

old policy, the senators sent
a letter to the athletic dept.
last July pointing out that
the policy was inconsistent
with the definition of a reg
istered student given in the
ASSU bylaws. This defini
tion, which, according to
ASSU senator Mark Epstein,
the University tacitly ac
cepts, states that a student
who has registered for three
consecutive quarters and in
tends to register for the fifth
is also considered a regis
tered student during the in
tervening quarter.
In the early fall, Pamela
Straithairn and Alan Cum
mings, both associate direc
tors of the athletic depart
ment, and Schoof met to
discuss the letter. It was de
cided then to fix the in
consistency. Schoof agreed
that the old policy was un
fair, "Our budget runs from
Sept. 1 to Sept. 1. We
shouldn't cut off students'
rights in the summmer,"she
said. The athletic dept. did
not notify the ASSU of its
decision until last month
because summer programs
are worked out during
March, according to
Schoof. .
