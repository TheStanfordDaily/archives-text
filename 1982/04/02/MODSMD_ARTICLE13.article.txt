; "Interaction is the purpose of art." This
message, signaled with handflags in front
pf a wall at Cologne's South Train Station,
conveys the asthetic principle of West Ger
man artist Manfred Ott who brought his
linique participating art to the University
yesterday. Ott and his Stanford co-artists
together created a painting/drawing for
JHaus Mitteleuropa. In an effort to combat
the obtrusiveness presented by today's
public image worlds of photos, TV pictures
and commercial advertisements, Ott offers
the opportunity for active perception. His
method? Using a blue copying pencil, Ott
makes wall-size drawings which he then
joffers up to his public for collaboration.
•This process occurs at an exhibition, where
iwhite-wall paint and paint-brushes are
provided; the rest is up to the individual
observer.
; This process, though it sounds destruc
tive, is not. To the contrary, it is highly
creative and in a most innovating way: The
blue copying pencil has the chemical
property of showing through any amount
of paint, at the same time giving the result
ing drawing/painting a violet glow.
using a paint-brush, observers can
•use their fingers to draw through thick,
Iwet paint.
The end result is a mixed product of ar
■tist stimulus and observer reaction. Ott
considers the reaction of the public to his
jart as important as his own work. In fact, he
records it on his drawing. He does not con

sider his "naked" drawing art until it has
been "worked through" by the public.
Such a concept of art is often considered
"sacriligious," because "painting over de
stroys the original." This accusation, Ott
says, besides being technically untrue, has
little basis with regard to his work. In the
first place, Ott's drawings are not neutral:
his themes are designed to instigate — and
often predict — specific reactions from the
public.
Ott's work does not end with the com
plete drawing/painting. With a Polaroid
camera, he takes pictures of details which
he finds particularly interesting as reac
tions to his initial drawing. These detailed
photos, as well as photos of the co-artists at
work, are put up for display immediately at
the exhibition, so that the cooperative
process is fully executed and acknowl
edged.
Incidentally, co-artist/observers are
asked to sign their names near their con
tribution totheOtt/publicwQrk of art. The
final process of singling out details of the
finished work is what Ott considers the ob
jectivization of the subjective input of the
public.
When one hears about public collabora
tion in the art process, the image that
comes to mind may be that of a large blank
screen set out on the sidewalk of a busy
New York street, at which passers-by are
invited to throw gobs of paint and assorted
objects, a la Jackson Pollock at his most
avant garde. Ott's goal, however, is much

different and much more complex. Ott
considers the entire human perception
process to be included in the circum
ference of his art.
"My drawing is medium. It sends a
message which is processed and reacted
to; what the observer decides to bring into
the painting is nevertheless a compen
dium of his or her own biography."
Ott calls his art a "confrontation" or a
"bringing together" of the artist's and the
observers' perceptions. The result is an ac
tive form of art, which allows the modern
observer to express him/herself in all
his/her individuality.
Earlier media for Ott have been metallic
sculptures with numbered parts that come
apart and can be put together in different
shapes. Ott also developed in this "rear
ranging mode" sets of paintings which, al
though cohesive as a unit, can be rear
ranged in different order in a room to re
ceive different light, different perspective,
or even connote a different meaning in the
new totality achieved by reordering.
Ott said his themes are always ap
propriate to his purpose in a particular
project. For his work here Ott has chosen
the bay area theme of the "San Francisco
Cable Car Preservation Movement;" This
was of course only his part of the deal. In
the Ott tradition, his project only became
"art" after Stanford had had its "paint" in
the matter.

"art" after Stanford had had its "paint" in
the matter.


A HELPING HAND — Everyone was in on the action at Haus Mitteleuropa yesterday
as students, faculty and other aspiring "artists" joined in to create a Manfred Ott wall
painting based on the theme of the "San Francisco Cable Car Preservation Move
ment."


ARTISTS AT WORK — West German artist Manfred Ott and this young child put to
gether their creative talents in order to create another of Ott's famous participatory
art works for Haus Mitteleuropa.
; "Interaction is the purpose of art." This
message, signaled with handflags in front
pf a wall at Cologne's South Train Station,
conveys the asthetic principle of West Ger
man artist Manfred Ott who brought his
linique participating art to the University
yesterday. Ott and his Stanford co-artists
together created a painting/drawing for
JHaus Mitteleuropa. In an effort to combat
the obtrusiveness presented by today's
public image worlds of photos, TV pictures
and commercial advertisements, Ott offers
the opportunity for active perception. His
method? Using a blue copying pencil, Ott
makes wall-size drawings which he then
joffers up to his public for collaboration.
•This process occurs at an exhibition, where
iwhite-wall paint and paint-brushes are
provided; the rest is up to the individual
observer.
; This process, though it sounds destruc
tive, is not. To the contrary, it is highly
creative and in a most innovating way: The
blue copying pencil has the chemical
property of showing through any amount
of paint, at the same time giving the result
ing drawing/painting a violet glow.
using a paint-brush, observers can
•use their fingers to draw through thick,
Iwet paint.
The end result is a mixed product of ar
■tist stimulus and observer reaction. Ott
considers the reaction of the public to his
jart as important as his own work. In fact, he
records it on his drawing. He does not con

sider his "naked" drawing art until it has
been "worked through" by the public.
Such a concept of art is often considered
"sacriligious," because "painting over de
stroys the original." This accusation, Ott
says, besides being technically untrue, has
little basis with regard to his work. In the
first place, Ott's drawings are not neutral:
his themes are designed to instigate — and
often predict — specific reactions from the
public.
Ott's work does not end with the com
plete drawing/painting. With a Polaroid
camera, he takes pictures of details which
he finds particularly interesting as reac
tions to his initial drawing. These detailed
photos, as well as photos of the co-artists at
work, are put up for display immediately at
the exhibition, so that the cooperative
process is fully executed and acknowl
edged.
Incidentally, co-artist/observers are
asked to sign their names near their con
tribution totheOtt/publicwQrk of art. The
final process of singling out details of the
finished work is what Ott considers the ob
jectivization of the subjective input of the
public.
When one hears about public collabora
tion in the art process, the image that
comes to mind may be that of a large blank
screen set out on the sidewalk of a busy
New York street, at which passers-by are
invited to throw gobs of paint and assorted
objects, a la Jackson Pollock at his most
avant garde. Ott's goal, however, is much

different and much more complex. Ott
considers the entire human perception
process to be included in the circum
ference of his art.
"My drawing is medium. It sends a
message which is processed and reacted
to; what the observer decides to bring into
the painting is nevertheless a compen
dium of his or her own biography."
Ott calls his art a "confrontation" or a
"bringing together" of the artist's and the
observers' perceptions. The result is an ac
tive form of art, which allows the modern
observer to express him/herself in all
his/her individuality.
Earlier media for Ott have been metallic
sculptures with numbered parts that come
apart and can be put together in different
shapes. Ott also developed in this "rear
ranging mode" sets of paintings which, al
though cohesive as a unit, can be rear
ranged in different order in a room to re
ceive different light, different perspective,
or even connote a different meaning in the
new totality achieved by reordering.
Ott said his themes are always ap
propriate to his purpose in a particular
project. For his work here Ott has chosen
the bay area theme of the "San Francisco
Cable Car Preservation Movement;" This
was of course only his part of the deal. In
the Ott tradition, his project only became
"art" after Stanford had had its "paint" in
the matter.
