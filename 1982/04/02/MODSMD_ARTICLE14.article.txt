The artist stepped forward and surveyed
the sketch. Hands at his sides and head
held high he still seemed dwarfed by the
mural before him. He hesitated then
turned away.
His mother urged him on and the young
boy no longer shy, grabbed a brush and at
tacked the sketch with fervor.
In any language the message was the
same. "It's very exciting and very beau
tiful," said one viewer of German artist
Manfred Ott's week long excercise in cap
turing the spirit of the Bay area.
Yesterday Ott encouraged students, fac
ulty and onlookers to take part in his artis
tic exercise. Motioning to his sketch of a
San Francisco cable car which covered an
entire wall, Ott stressed, "the audience is
supposed to participate."
Timid at first, the more than 40 persons
present stepped forward one at a time and
gingerly picked up one of three
paintbrushes. The crowd offered words of
encouragement. "Take a brush and get
into it," urged one onlooker.
Soon the closet artists in the crowd lost
their inhibitions and boldly stepped for
ward. Cries of "I want to try this out," and

"I want to paint" passed through the as
sembled crowd.
Paintbrush in hand and with a laugh at
their own attempts to create, the audience
set to work. And each artist brought his or
her own technique to the very special
work unfolding. Swirls, drips and spatters
dotted the canvas.
One gentleman, clad in a gray plaid suit
stepped forward confidently. He grasped
the paint brush and carefully painted two
parallel strokes. At the end of each he
added a small square. Stepping back to
survey his work he nodded his head, bent
down and replaced the brush.
A young woman stepped forward and
with wide, sweeping strokes added her
own design in the shape of an avocado to
the mural. Another skillfully outlined a
cable car wheel. Others experimented
with brush techniques and layers of paint.
One adventurous painter defied con
vention and passed on using a brush. Dip
ping all five fingers into the bucket he then
gently pressed his fingertips to the canvas.
He then made a fist and covered it with
paint. Soon two small footprints adorned
the mural. His actions did not escape the

notice of the young blond artist. Taking a
good idea and adding to it, he too invoked
the finger method to leave his mark on the
mural.
In the background self-appointed art
critics sipped wine and sampled cheese
and bread while discussing the merits of
hands-on art. Snatches of conversations
hung in mid air. "The creative process is so
different." and"I think this is
phenomenal," were just a few opinions
verbalized.
Meanwhile the painting continued.
Once was not enough. Time after time on
lookers returned to the mural to add just
one last touch. With an impish grin one
student said, "I'm going to go for it again."
Slowly but surely the mural took on new
meaning. Just as Ott predicted the mural
seemed to reflect the "perceptions of the
people who interacted with the painting."
Eventually, even the youngest of the ar
tists present seemed satisfied with his
handiwork. Somewhat reluctantly he
turned in his paintbrush and moved to his
mother's side. With a backward glance he
skipped from the room taking with him
more than the paint on his hands.
