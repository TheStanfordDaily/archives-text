# War is a sad legacy for our children
## 
### 
I started out to write this column
on the Social Security system and got
to thinking about a more general
question: does our society eat its
young? That is, do parents hate their
children?
The Social Security system is just
one example, but it is typical. Our
generation decided that it would be
"good" to alleviate the humiliation
of old people who, not having
planned for their retirement, had to
openly throw themselves on the
mercy of their children or other rela
tives. So, this generation erected a
"blind" of government intervention
so that the old people could get the
support covertly, with the mystique
of a pseudoactuarial program. The
children still pay the bills, but now
get few thanks, or any relief if their
parents have some foresight.
Another thousand examples are all
government programs that have re
quired deficit spending. A post
ponement of payments by one gen
eration is an imposition of those
payments on the next generation,
and, as it stands now, on the next and
the next. Back in the '60s, lots of folks
used to advise young people not to
take out loans in order to finish col
lege. They said: "You don't want to
have a big debt to pay off when
you're just starting out in life." They
must, of course, have been speaking
tongue-in-cheek since nowadays ev
ery child born in the United States
has a debt that staggers the imagina
tion. He can expect to pay out a
fourth of everything he earns in his
life in order to pay on that debt he in
herited, (which he must pass on to his
children, since he can't possibly pay
it off in his lifetime.)
One of the most irritating ex
amples, to me, is the agreements en
tered into with foreign countries,
which are of course passed on by
one, from one generation to the
next. Consider our agreement to
provide for military defense of Japan.

The Daily recently ran a news story
that mentioned that the average fam
ily in Japan earns about $16,000 and
pays about $1100 in taxes. The Ameri
can worker of similar income pays at
least twice that much in income taxes
alone — more if other taxes are con
sidered (see Tax tables), and part of
that money goes to provide for the
defense of Japan.
Meanwhile, taxes that the
Japanese do pay are used to subsidize
their industries. So, the American
worker pays taxes so that the
Japanese worker can have a bigger
takehome from his wages — allowing
him to work cheaper and so produce
products at a lower price. Mean
while, Japanese industry is sub
sidized, the better to compete with

Consider the
Vietnam veterans
who put in their
years of mandatory
service, who are
only now getting
their lives together

the American industries that provide
the American worker with his job.
The American worker is forced into a
self-destruction pact.
But the generation gap goes
deeper than this. It is not all a matter
of money, taxes and job security.
One hears more and more often
about a mandatory two or more years
of government service for 18-year
olds as an alternative to selective ser
vice. Now we are not talking about
the two to three months of wages for
feited every year; we are talking
about years of a person's life — every
minute of those years, in mandatory,
oftimes involuntary servitude. Con
sider the Vietnam veterans who put
in their years of mandatory service,
who are only now getting their lives
together and beginning careers and
families. Can you tell me that the
shock of those years was good for
them, or good for the country? Free
young people are remarkably pro
ductive. Young slaves are not. Since

such slavery is thus impractical, I can
only suppose that some barely sup
pressed hatred of the young
motivates their parents to consider
enslaving them.
Then, as always, there is the exam
ple of the draft and militarism. What
is the average age of the con
gressmen, senators, presidents and
government appointees who make
the decisions that bring us to war?
What age are those who die in them?
Wilfred Owen, poet of World War I,
voiced this cry beautifully in his "Par
able of the Old Man and the Young"
in which he used the image of Abram
as the older generations of Europe:
... Then Abram bound the youth
with belts and straps, And builded
parapets and trenches there, And
stretched forth the knife to slay his
son, When lo! an angel called him
out of heaven, Saying, Lay not thy
hand upon the lad, Neither do any
thing to him. Behold, A ram, caught
in a thicket by its horns; Offer the
Ram of Pride instead of him. But the
old man would not so, but slew his
son, And half the seed of Europe, one
by one.
As parents and future parents, per
haps it is time to reevaluate me
legacy we intend to leave.

tongue-in-cheek since nowadays ev
ery child born in the United States
has a debt that staggers the imagina
tion. He can expect to pay out a
fourth of everything he earns in his
life in order to pay on that debt he in
herited, (which he must pass on to his
children, since he can't possibly pay
it off in his lifetime.)
One of the most irritating ex
amples, to me, is the agreements en
tered into with foreign countries,
which are of course passed on by
one, from one generation to the
next. Consider our agreement to
provide for military defense of Japan.

The Daily recently ran a news story
that mentioned that the average fam
ily in Japan earns about $16,000 and
pays about $1100 in taxes. The Ameri
can worker of similar income pays at
least twice that much in income taxes
alone — more if other taxes are con
sidered (see Tax tables), and part of
that money goes to provide for the
defense of Japan.
Meanwhile, taxes that the
Japanese do pay are used to subsidize
their industries. So, the American
worker pays taxes so that the
Japanese worker can have a bigger
takehome from his wages — allowing
him to work cheaper and so produce
products at a lower price. Mean
while, Japanese industry is sub
sidized, the better to compete with

who put in their

their lives together

the American industries that provide
the American worker with his job.
The American worker is forced into a
self-destruction pact.
But the generation gap goes
deeper than this. It is not all a matter
of money, taxes and job security.
One hears more and more often
about a mandatory two or more years
of government service for 18-year

about years of a person's life — every
minute of those years, in mandatory,
oftimes involuntary servitude. Con
sider the Vietnam veterans who put
in their years of mandatory service,
who are only now getting their lives
together and beginning careers and
families. Can you tell me that the
shock of those years was good for
them, or good for the country? Free
young people are remarkably pro

such slavery is thus impractical, I can
only suppose that some barely sup
pressed hatred of the young
motivates their parents to consider
enslaving them.

is the average age of the con
gressmen, senators, presidents and

What age are those who die in them?
Wilfred Owen, poet of World War I,
voiced this cry beautifully in his "Par
able of the Old Man and the Young"
in which he used the image of Abram
as the older generations of Europe:
... Then Abram bound the youth
with belts and straps, And builded
parapets and trenches there, And
stretched forth the knife to slay his
son, When lo! an angel called him
out of heaven, Saying, Lay not thy
hand upon the lad, Neither do any
thing to him. Behold, A ram, caught
in a thicket by its horns; Offer the
Ram of Pride instead of him. But the
old man would not so, but slew his
son, And half the seed of Europe, one
by one.
As parents and future parents, per
haps it is time to reevaluate me
legacy we intend to leave.

I started out to write this column
on the Social Security system and got
to thinking about a more general
question: does our society eat its
young? That is, do parents hate their
children?
The Social Security system is just
one example, but it is typical. Our
generation decided that it would be
"good" to alleviate the humiliation
of old people who, not having
planned for their retirement, had to
openly throw themselves on the
mercy of their children or other rela
tives. So, this generation erected a
"blind" of government intervention
so that the old people could get the
support covertly, with the mystique
of a pseudoactuarial program. The
children still pay the bills, but now
get few thanks, or any relief if their
parents have some foresight.
Another thousand examples are all
government programs that have re
quired deficit spending. A post
ponement of payments by one gen
eration is an imposition of those
payments on the next generation,
and, as it stands now, on the next and
the next. Back in the '60s, lots of folks
used to advise young people not to
take out loans in order to finish col
lege. They said: "You don't want to
have a big debt to pay off when
you're just starting out in life." They
must, of course, have been speaking
tongue-in-cheek since nowadays ev
ery child born in the United States
has a debt that staggers the imagina
tion. He can expect to pay out a
fourth of everything he earns in his
life in order to pay on that debt he in
herited, (which he must pass on to his
children, since he can't possibly pay
it off in his lifetime.)
