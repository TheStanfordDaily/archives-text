## Hegelian Reagan warring up 
### 
Although I doubt President Ronald
Reagan ever read a word of G.W.H.
Hegel, there is something surprising
ly similar in their world views. I my
self recently suffered an intense
though somewhat capricious love af
fair with the philosophy of that ven
erable and once hoary-headed
philosopher.
"What's to love," a friend of mine
once asked. "Look at his life. Hegel
was a bore, not like Nietzche, for ex
ample, who suffered from venereal
disease and went insane, or like
Kierkegaard who betrayed his love
for a beautiful woman and took the
leap of faith in his own ego. Even
Kant was a madman — you could set
your watch by him he was so pre
cise."
But not Hegel. Hegel read a lot as a
child — so whatl Hegel had a wife
and a normal family life. Hegel wasn't
even frowned upon in his homeland.
In fact, they made Hegel the state
philosopher even while he was alive.
Ah, Hegel, sweetness to my soul,
what I loved about his philosophy
was the notion that History em
braced certain individuals and
formed them for her own purpose.
Such an individual Hegel called "a
historical man," someone who
moves history; and if such a person
went about doggedly pursuing his
own ambitions, Destiny would carry
him to his rightful place in the
scheme of things. Hegel had already
developed a trickle-down theory in
the nineteenth century!
Hegel went further in his claims.
He said that God manifests himself in
History and that one nation at any
given age was the God-bearer. In
deed, although Hegel was not so
lacking in subtlety that he was precise
about the matter, one might even say
that for Hegel, History was God.
It suits a politician's purpose to en
list God's support in his own political
career — sort of an infallible en
dorsement — and of course politicos
have been doing it in one form or an
other since mankind began to de
velop into tribal units, I suppose.
Having cast off the yoke of divine
right in Europe's not-to-distant past,
it is easy to understand why the Ger
man officials of Hegel's time were
eager to embrace the Hegeli in phi
losophy of history. Hegel's ideas of
historical individuals of a world stat
ure justified their ambitions and that
any one country at any one time man
ifests God's love exclusively has

enough rhetorical potential to
seduce a whole nation onto the tran
scendental bandwagon.
Still, the officials of Hegel's weren't
the only politicians capable of ration
alizing about their place in the cos
mos. There was Dostoyevsky's Russia,
the Bible's Israel, Hitler's Germany,
and ah yes, pitiable though it may
seem in contrast to those historical
and philosophical heavies, Reagan's
America.
Even before Reagan, witch-burn
ing Puritans established God's king
dom here on earth in our own New
England. Manifest destiny of one sort

It is often a cruel and
providential irony
that those who most
vehemently claim to
be the bearers of
destiny are those who
bring to birth
History's visage.
Those peoples most
ready to accept such
political
counseling are those
most likely to become
tools of History's
barbarity.

or another was used to rationalize
plundering the North American Indi
ans and stealing a third of Mexico's
land mass.
In the face of God's seemingly
sordid and bumbling intervention
into our national history, it is to the
credit of the American people that
they have taken the leap of faith once
again to support this age's phoenix
reborn, Reagan.
As the above litany is meant to sug
gest it is often a cruel and providen
tial 'irony that those who most
vehemently claim to be the bearers
of destiny are those who bring to
birth History's most hideous visage.
Those people most ready to accept
such political counseling are those
most likely to become tools of His
tory's barbarity.
Recently I have had a change of
heart in regards to my love for
Hegel's philosophy. As a somewhat

ancient — certainly before Hegel's
time — Jewish preacher once said:;
where your treasure is, there is where
your heart will be. In this country we
know where our treasure is. It is
buried in the bowels of America's
fertile earth in concrete missile silos
and it is hidden deep in the ocean in
Trident submarines.
When I was younger and lived at
my parent's house, our dining room
faced south. When we ate at night, I
could see the valley below projecting
toward New York City. The webb of
lights strung up over the George
Washington Bridge was just visible,
although a hill blocked out the view
of the skyline. Still, we knew where
the city was and it played in our im
aginations. At night I would dream
that while sitting in the dining room a
squadron of Soviet jets roared over
our house. Then an orange flash;
would rise up from where the city lay
behind the hills.
I imagine that dreaming about the
day when we destroy our cities isn't
that unusual in America. It is partly,
perhaps, the subconscious fear of
such atomic annihilation — or maybe
the desire for it — that has caused
America to abandon her cities.
California has been America's
promised land and lately has become
the land of messiahs — the state
which has produced two of our past
four presidents. But let that not go to
the head of those of us who live in
California. To say that California is
the pre-eminent state for produing
messiahs — Jim Jones, Ronald Rea
gan, Richard Nixon, Charles Manson
and Jerry Brown, all within a dozen
years time span — is not to say much
more than that America herself has
produced such men of history. Hegel
would have been proud of you, Cali
fornia — proud of you, America.
If only we could listen to Camus
and accept that we are not gods, but
men. Indeed if we could put on our
humanity and leave behind our
sweet and deadly Hegelian dreams.
Who knows? Maybe Hegel and
Reagan are right — maybe there is
reason in American history. Someday
soon perhaps, the sweet green hills
of Kansas, the lush forests and fear
ridden cities of the east and the
golden deserts of the west might yet,
in one ecstatic bright orange blaze of
release, become the unredeemable
lamb of god.
