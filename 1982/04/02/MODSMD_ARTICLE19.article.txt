## Alone in the Senate 
### 
Once again, the election for mem
bers of the ASSU Council of Presi
dents and for the Senate approaches.
And once again, the Stanford student
body will be asked to choose from
among a variety of candidates — a va
riety, to be sure, except that most are
white and most are male.
Women and minority groups have
traditionally shrunk from running for
office at Stanford. Many believe that
extra-governmental organizations,
such as the Women's Center, the
Black Students' Union, or the Asian-
American Association, more effec
tively lookafter their interests. At
present, they are right.
However, a student government
which truly represents everyone can
better serve everyone. Once can
further one's interests by working
outside the system, as most minority

groups do now, and by altering the
system from the inside out.
I urge women and minorities to
mobilize, to run for office, to get out
the vote — and to be elected. Apathy
runs rampant at Stanford, but with
some organization and dedication,
you can beat it.
It's not too late to run. Candidates
for the Senate must collect a mere 25
signatures; COP slates must gather
100. All signatures are due in the
ASSU office by 4 p.m. on Monday,
April 5.
The ASSU government suposedly
benefits all the students. Make it your
government, by giving yourself a
voice in it.
