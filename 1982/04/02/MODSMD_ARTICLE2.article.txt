# Protest letters sent to budget committees
## Financial aid changes worry Kennedy 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The future of student financial aid
doesn't look as dire as President Rea
gan's budget proposal paints it, ac
cording to professional staff mem
bers of both the Senate and House
Budget Committees.
In letters to members of the House
and Senate Budget Committees last
rtionth, University President Donald
Kennedy expressed his "concern for
the student aid funding levels and
eligibility restrictions proposed by
the Administration in its FY'B3
Budget package.

Praeger. He claimed that the business
community agrees completely.
The person who does not seem to

Sandy Pianalto, Mineta's associate
staff person to the Budget Commit
