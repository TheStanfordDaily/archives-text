# Protest letters sent to budget committees
## Financial aid changes worry Kennedy 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
The future of student financial aid
doesn't look as dire as President Rea
gan's budget proposal paints it, ac
cording to professional staff mem
bers of both the Senate and House
Budget Committees.
In letters to members of the House
and Senate Budget Committees last
rtionth, University President Donald
Kennedy expressed his "concern for
the student aid funding levels and
eligibility restrictions proposed by
the Administration in its FY'B3
Budget package.
"The Administration's proposals to
reduce student aid funding further
(approximately 50 percent below the
FY'Bl level) can only be regarded as a
clear and intentional retreat from a

national commitment since 1965 to
equal opportunity in higher educa
tion. I am deeply disturbed by this re
treat," Kennedy said.
Kennedy is not alone in his con
cern. Glen Roberts, a legislative assis
tant for Congressman Norman Min
eta (D-Calif.) noted that his office has
received "doyens and dozens and
dozens ofTetters from deans and stu
dents and I think they have a tremen
dous impact."
Lilja called Kennedy "a well-re
spected individual in Washington.
Everyone realizes that he's an ex
tremely competent individual" and
Congressmen are therefore more re
ceptive to his particular plea. But she
Â«aid the most effective influence is
the huge bulk of letters received.
Rick Praeger, professional staff

memberfor the House Budget Com
mittee, said the Committee heard
testimony recently from three col
lege presidents who "painted a re
alistic and reasonable picture of their
situation should Reagan's budget
pass and it was fairly bleak."
The Committee members were
jcgncemed and recognized tha coun
' ter-productivTty of talking aoout in
creasing the nation's productivity
and at the same time cutting out
graduate student loans, according to
Praeger. He claimed that the business
community agrees completely.
The person who does not seem to
agree is President Ronald Reagan.
Sandy Pianalto, Mineta's associate
staff person to the Budget Commit
tee, said that while Reagan hasn't I
particularly addressed student loans,

he has expressend his unwillingness
to compromise on his budget pro
posal.
Lilja said there is a "general
bipartisan sense of reluctance to go

along with the President's
budget, but the President has
been very firm about his reluc
tance to compromise."
Pianalto said talks are being
held between the White House
and Congress with the hope of
reaching a bipartisan com
promise. Democrats are not
the only ones opposed to the
budget proposal. Pianalto said
that in late February the
freshmen Republican repre
sentatives sent a letter to the
President saying they could not
accept his student loan pro
posal.
In addition, all of the sub
committees of the House
Education and Labor Commit
tee have expressed their op
position to any changes in stu
dent financial aid funding from
Fiscal Year (FY) 1982 and will
present these views to the full
budget committee,. *
Pianalto said the immediate
Concern of student loan pro
gram supporters is the pro
posal for a supplemental Guar
anteed Student Loan (GSL) fun
ding of $1.3 bullion for FY1982.
This would assure funding
through September at current
levels, even if Reagan's budget
passes.
In letters to 15 senators this
week, Kennedy said support of
the supplemental appropria

tion is "critical," and noted that
5500 Stanford students (45 per
cent of the entire student
body) depend on the GSL pro
gram for partial financing of
their educational costs.
"Adoption of anything less
than $1.3 billion... and, in par
ticular, adoption of the Presi
dent's GSL proposal which
among other things would dis
qualify graduate students from
GSL participation, could
jeopardize the educational
plans of these students," Ken
nedy warned.
In his FY1983 budget pro
posal, Reagan has reduced dis
cretionary appropriated pro
grams, including the Pell grants
and College Work-Study, by
$1.6 billion which is 50 percent
less than this year.
Senator Pete Domenici (R-
N.M.), Chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, is working
on an alternate proposal which
would leave discretionary pro
grams, targeted at low-income
students at the level of FY1982,
but tighten the GSL program,
according to Lilja.
If left alone, Lilja said the GSL
program will increase 34 per
cent in FY1983 because it is tied
to interest rates. She said
Domenici's plan would modify
GSLs so students would assume
the additional responsibility
for the nine percent interest on
their loan during the time they
are in school.
