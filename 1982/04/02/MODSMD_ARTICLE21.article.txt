## Enrich history class by talking to older people 
### 
Have you ever sat at the kitchen table with your
grandmother and listened to her stories about
being a woman in the 19205? Have you quizzed
your elderly neighbor about who lived in your
house 50 years ago, asked an older friend about the
civil rights movement, or your brother about draft
resistance in the '60s? Have you ever thought of
that as history?
For most of my career as a student, I rejected his
tory as it is traditionally taught. The necessity of
memorizing dates, names and the quantitative ef
fects of decisions made in high places seemed un
palatably dry. I studied literature instead, which by
contrast seemed to me about everything relevant
to human life, including history, through the me
dium of human characters. Years later, studying
urban development and the condition of women, I
was introduced to social history and then oral his
tory. A vital current began to flow, connecting
"facts" to experience.
A traditional history text tells the essential
"facts" of history. It tells us of the ostensible causes
of the stockmarket crash of 1929, the strategic ma
neuvers and negotiations of WWII, the con
troversy surrounding the McCarthy trials of the
'50s and the alleged reasons for U.S. involvement
in and eventual withdrawal from the war in Viet
nam. To learn something about the effects of these
events and circumstances on peoples' lives, you
might read Studs Terkel's Hard Times, Eric Maria
Remark's All Quiet on the Western Front, Lillian
Hellman's Scoundrel Times and see the film
Apocalypse Now. To even better understand his
tory as a human experience, you could ask people
around you about history as they lived it.
What does your mother remember of her child

hood during the great depression? Was someone
you know affected by the actions of Joseph Mc-
Carthy's House Unamerican Activies Committee
or involved in the early civil rights marches? What
do members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War
have to tell now about their experiences 10 years
ago? Oral history is as simple as asking questions
across the kitchen table and as complex as drawing
together strands of personal recollection and rec
orded "fact" to spin an intricate and complete web
of history.
Over the past several years, the techniques,
technology and uses of oral history have been
growing as it has become accepted as a branch of
historical research which fills in important gaps of
knowledge left by written documents. Some of
these gaps are filled by the answers to the ques
tions: "What were the effetts of historical events
on the lives of the people who lived th. ough them?
What did they think and how did they feel about
what was happening?" Hearing the answers first
hand can be an exciting process of discovery, as
history comes alive in the recounting.
There are several exciting oral history projects
currently underway at Stanford and the adjacent
community which welcome student involvement.
Students may join Roxanne Nilan at the University
Archives on a project interviewing members of the
Stanford Community about its history, participate
in a local psychologist's efforts to document peace
movements in this area, or help to organize a Palo
Alto School District project which involves junior
high and high school students in videotaping in
terviews with local writers and artists about their
lives and work.

In addition, two Spring quarter courses will in
corporate oral history interviews into their course.
SWOPSIIO4, "Oral Histories of Women Peace Ac
tivists: The Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom (WILPP), Palo Alto" will in
volve participants in interviewing members of
WILPP about their political activities over the past
60 years, transcribing and editing tapes, document
ing the lives of the women interviewed. Archival
work related to the histories will be an option in
SWOPSII7B: "Two Women Eye to Eye: Lesbian Vi
sions in Literature."
Another option open to those of you who are
excited about the idea of oral history is to design
your own oral historttproject, either for independ
ent credit, or in conjunction with a course you are
already taking (on that lends itself to oral
history research).
Additional resources exist on campus: The
Archives of Recorded Sound has materials useful
to oral historians, including taped portions of the
recent Branner series on the '60s. Several faculty
members in the English, History and Anthropology
Departments share an interest in oral history and
oral traditions and have both expertise and in
formation to share. I urge you to take advantage of
these resources. Just as oral history opens up a new
branch of historical knowledge and rounds out the
perspective of traditional history , participating in a
field work project related to or*l history offers the
opportunity to enrich your education through ex
periential learning.
