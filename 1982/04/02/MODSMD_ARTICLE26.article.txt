## Baseball team to play ASU 
### Adam Berns 
Last week it did not just rain
on the Stanford baseball team,
it poured, as the Cardinal lost
its last four straight games in
the Riverside Tournament. This
weekend, the No. 2 ranked
Cardinal will be looking for
some sunshine in Arizona as
Stanford takes on the top
ranked Arizona State Sun
devils.
The Cardinal currently leads
the Pac-10 Southern Division
with a 10-2 record while the
Sun Devils, the defending
NCAA Champions are a close
second with a 6-2 mark.
Arizona State has been
almost invincible at home this
year boosting a 20-2 record at
Packard Stadium and a 31-7
record overall. Stanford cur
rently has a 29-7-1 record.
T his weekends three game

series will start today at 7 p.m.
and run through Sunday.
The Sun Devils traditionally
have a powerful lineup and this
year is no exception. They are
currently batiing .310 as a team
and have several powerful hit
ters. Among the most danger
ous are right fielder Kevin
Romine (.389, 20 RBI, 25 SB),
first baseman Alvin Davis (.368,
4 HR, 36 RBI), and third
baseman Ronni Salcedo (.326,8
HR, 39 RBI).
Stanford counters with a
strong lineup of its own. First
baseman Mike Aldrete leads
the aeam with a .389 average
and 29 RBIs, followed by left
fielder Mike Dotterer (.368, 3
HR, 11 SB), and designated hit
ter Greg Lorenzetti (.338, 4 HR,
12.RBI).
The Cardinal has a .305 team
batting average, but its produc

tion has been surprisingly poor
in recent contests. In the last
five games, Stanford isonly bat
ting .190. Coach Mark Mar
quess has been concerned
about his team's hitting all year
long, and it could provethedif
ference in this weekend's
series.
Second baseman Steve Bue
chelle, center fielder Darryl
Stephens and right fielder
Mike Toothman, all plagued by
injuries last week in Riverside,
appear healthy for Arizona
State.
Stanford pitching, which has
been solid all season, faces a
big task this weekend. Brian
Mignano (8-1, 1.42 ERA) will
start today's game, followed by
Brian Myers (3-2, 1 57 ERA) on
Saturday, and either freshman

Jeff Ballard (5-3, 4.12 ERA) or
Steve Cottrell (2-1,3.63 F.RA) on
Sunday. Cottrell, who started
the ye£.i On weii, has not
pitched well in his last few out
ings. In the last ten innings he
has pitched, he has given up 13
earned runs and 16 hits.
In the bullpen, the relief ace
is Mike Sullivan, who has been
nothing short of brilliant. He
boasts an ERA of 2.08, a 3-0 rec
ord, and six saves.
The Sun Devils also have a
strong pitching staff with an ov
erall ERA of 3.16, compared
with 2.83 for Stanford. Starting
today's game for Arizona State
will be righthander Mike
Hogan (7-1, 3.40 ERA) followed
by Randy Newman (4-0, 3.07
ERA) on Saturday and Jim
Boudreau (4-0, 1.98 ERA) on
Sunday.

READY TO FIRE — Senior pitching ace Brian Mignano, who has an impressive 8-1 record
and 1.42 ERA, will start today against Arizona State University in one of the most impor
tant series of the year. The Cardinal, currently leading the Pacific-10 Southern Division, is
riding a four game losing streak and would like nothing better than to get back on track
with a win over the Sun Devils, ranked first nationally.
