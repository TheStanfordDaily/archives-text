# Netters play Cal in crucial match
## 
### Sally Jenkins Senior sports writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team, playing a "say it isn't so"
song after a slow start this sea
son has resulted in an 8-4 over
all record, faces its nemesis
UC-Berkeley at the varsity
courts today in must-win
match.
It's a match that will tell the
Cardinal whether to write off
this season as the proverbial
"rebuilding year," or whether
they just might have enough
quirky dark-horse talent to slip
into the Nationals.
Stanford comes off of a dis
asterous trip to Arizona last
week that yielded two narrow
losses to the ASU Sun Devils
(5-3) and the Arizona Wildcats
(5-4). Coupled with two more
knuckle-biter losses to Trinity
(5-4) and the University of Tex
as (5-4) earlier in the season,
the Cardinal record thus far is a
strange and hardly fathomable

figure for the defending NCAA
champions.
"We're so close to being un
defeated," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "The losses
make today's match extremely
important. The next few
matches will determine wheth
er our chances of reaching the
NCAA's are realistic."
The Card will have a chance
to regain some ground and
take a little revenge on their
own turf when the Wildcats
and Sun Devils travel to Stan
ford next week. But in the
meantime, a loss to Cal might
very well leave them crying in
the rain, and with nothing to
do the week of the NCAA
championship tournament.
Stanford defended its Nor-
Cal Intercollegiate title this
year against the Bears, but just
barely. The Card outran the
Bears by only two points in the
thriller of a tournament at San

wU! play against Cal's Rancly Nixon today in what could
prove to be the crucial match in the competition. Davis,
who is 16-1 on the year, lost his only match earlier in the
season to Nixon.
