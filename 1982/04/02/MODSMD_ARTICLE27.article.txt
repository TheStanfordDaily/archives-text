# Netters play Cal in crucial match
## 
### Sally Jenkins Senior sports writer 
The Stanford men's tennis
team, playing a "say it isn't so"
song after a slow start this sea
son has resulted in an 8-4 over
all record, faces its nemesis
UC-Berkeley at the varsity
courts today in must-win
match.
It's a match that will tell the
Cardinal whether to write off
this season as the proverbial
"rebuilding year," or whether
they just might have enough
quirky dark-horse talent to slip
into the Nationals.
Stanford comes off of a dis
asterous trip to Arizona last
week that yielded two narrow
losses to the ASU Sun Devils
(5-3) and the Arizona Wildcats
(5-4). Coupled with two more
knuckle-biter losses to Trinity
(5-4) and the University of Tex
as (5-4) earlier in the season,
the Cardinal record thus far is a
strange and hardly fathomable

figure for the defending NCAA
champions.
"We're so close to being un
defeated," said Stanford head
coach Dick Gould. "The losses
make today's match extremely
important. The next few
matches will determine wheth
er our chances of reaching the
NCAA's are realistic."
The Card will have a chance
to regain some ground and
take a little revenge on their
own turf when the Wildcats
and Sun Devils travel to Stan
ford next week. But in the
meantime, a loss to Cal might
very well leave them crying in
the rain, and with nothing to
do the week of the NCAA
championship tournament.

BACKHAND SMASH — N.j. 1 singles player Scott Davis
wU! play against Cal's Rancly Nixon today in what could
prove to be the crucial match in the competition. Davis,
who is 16-1 on the year, lost his only match earlier in the
season to Nixon.
Jose State last month that came
down to an all-Stanford vs. Cal
doubles semi-finals. Stanford
swept both matches to win the
title, but not without a few
heart palpitations on Gould's
part.
Nos.l and 2 doubles should
prove the key matches once
again in today's confrontation.
Cardinals Scott Davis and Jeff
Arons will take on Mark
Woolridge and Mark McNally
at No.l, and Scott Bondurant
and John Corse of Stanford will
face Doug Stone and John Sev
erly at N0.2 in a replay of the

NorCal tourney.
"The winner of the match
will have to win two of the
three doubles," said Gould.
"We're going to have to play at
Nos. 1 and 2."
In another key match, Stan
ford's No.l Davis will be look
ing to dismantle Randy Nixon
of Cal. Nixon handed Davis a
6-4, 6-2 defeat in the NorCal
singles final, his only loss of the
season so far.
Rumor has it, however, that
Davis was merely sleepwalking
that day. He has an 11-0 record
in dual matches and is 16-1 ov
erall this season, a figure which
surely has not escaped Nixon's
notice.
