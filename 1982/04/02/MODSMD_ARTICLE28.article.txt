### 
The No. 2 ranked Stanford
women's tennis team takes
on UC Irvine tomorrow at 11
a.m.
The Cardinal women
have a 9-0 record and are
scheduled to be ranked first
in the next poll.
Among the many fine
performances has been the
play of sophomore Michelle
Weiss who has a 9-0 record,
freshman Kate Gompert at

5-0 and sophomore All-
America Elise Burgin also at
5-0.
In doubles, Stanford is
paced by Burgin and
freshman Linda Gates who
have teamed for a 7-0 rec
ord, and the Gompert-
Weiss team which boasts a
5-1 mark.
Stanford won its first
women's tennis cham

pionship four years ago in
1978 and if things continue
the way they have, they
could be we!! on their way
to adding another title this
year.
At the start of the season,
women's tennis coach Frank
Brennon knew his team
would be good, and the re
sults thus far this season
have proved him right.
