Congressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), undaunted by his third place standing in the
Field Poll released Wednesday, said his campaign
for the U.S. Senate hinges on Southern California
voters.
"The poll shows that in Northern California I'm
well-known and that I will win here," beating the
other Republican Senate candidates, McCloskey
said in a phone interview from a Los Angeles
County fund-raiser. "If I can convince the voters in
Southern California to vote for me, I'll win."
McCloskey said he was "rot terribly disap
pointed," but rather encouraged by the poll be
cause he believes it was an indication that San Die
go Mayor Pete Wilson's popularity surge was due

to Wilson's recent $200,000 media blitz. Mc-
Closkey said he could achieve a strong showing
too when his media campaign begins the last week
of April.
The current poll shows McCloskey retained the
18 percent he held in the Feb. poll while Rep. Barry
Goldwater Jr. (R-Woodland Hills) dropped five
points to 29 percent and Wilson moved up six
points to second place with 24 percent.
McCloskey hopes to raise $750,000 for a tele
vision campaign which would increase his name
identification and snatch the June 8 nomination
from the seven other Republican Senate can
didates. A spokeswoman from his San Francisco
press office said they hope to tape television spots
on April 15 in San Francisco.

To date, McCloskey has raised $1,045,000 for his
campaign bid. He said he hopes to bring that total
to $2,000,000. His Bay Area campaign staff mem
bers did not know how much money was currently
in the bank as they are awaiting an accountant's to
tal. One commented, however, that McCloskey's
campaign is far from having a deficit.
McCloskey said he believes the Californian Re
publican Assembly's endorsement of U.S. Senate
candidate Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Santa Monica)
shows a loss of voter support for Goldwater. The
CRA, which represents 14,000 conservative voters,
was expected to back Goldwater during last week
end's Fresno convention.
