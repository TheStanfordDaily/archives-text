# McCloskey optimistic about campaign

Congressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), undaunted by his third place standing in the
Field Poll released Wednesday, said his campaign
for the U.S. Senate hinges on Southern California
voters.
"The poll shows that in Northern California I'm
well-known and that I will win here," beating the
other Republican Senate candidates, McCloskey
said in a phone interview from a Los Angeles
County fund-raiser. "If I can convince the voters in
Southern California to vote for me, I'll win."
McCloskey said he was "rot terribly disap
pointed," but rather encouraged by the poll be
cause he believes it was an indication that San Die
go Mayor Pete Wilson's popularity surge was due

to Wilson's recent $200,000 media blitz. Mc-
Closkey said he could achieve a strong showing
too when his media campaign begins the last week
of April.
The current poll shows McCloskey retained the
18 percent he held in the Feb. poll while Rep. Barry
Goldwater Jr. (R-Woodland Hills) dropped five
points to 29 percent and Wilson moved up six
points to second place with 24 percent.
McCloskey hopes to raise $750,000 for a tele
vision campaign which would increase his name
identification and snatch the June 8 nomination
from the seven other Republican Senate can
didates. A spokeswoman from his San Francisco
press office said they hope to tape television spots
on April 15 in San Francisco.

To date, McCloskey has raised $1,045,000 for his
campaign bid. He said he hopes to bring that total
to $2,000,000. His Bay Area campaign staff mem
bers did not know how much money was currently
in the bank as they are awaiting an accountant's to
tal. One commented, however, that McCloskey's
campaign is far from having a deficit.
McCloskey said he believes the Californian Re
publican Assembly's endorsement of U.S. Senate
candidate Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Santa Monica)
shows a loss of voter support for Goldwater. The
CRA, which represents 14,000 conservative voters,
was expected to back Goldwater during last week
end's Fresno convention.
"The Dornan choice is an indicator
that Goldwater can't stand up to
scrutiny," McCloskey said. "It
looked like Republicans were never
going to look at Goldwater, but, I
think, they're beginning to realize he
is not similar to his father (Arizona
Sen. Barry Goldwater). His father is
brilliant and a fighter. He is not."
The Bay Area Congressman, now
in his 18th month of Senate cam
paigning, has come under con
siderable fire for remarks which
critics charge as "anti-Semitic." Mc-
Closkey has said the "Jewish lobby"
is too powerful, arguing that the
United States' and Israel's best in
terests would be better served
through the creation of a Palestinian
homeland.
The most recent criticism came
March 14, when McCloskey ap
peared at a Los Angeles debate with
the Jewish Defense League. Mc-
Closkey reportedly said that some
JDL members were anti-American

for their refusal to support the return
of the Sinai to Egypt.
Last week, at an appearance before
the Palo Alto Lions Club, McCloskey
said his remarks were aimed at Irv
Rubin, with whom McCloskey
shared the podium. "I'm hurt by the
criticism," McCloskey said. "It's ri
diculous. I'm not anti-Semitic. It's
like if I said I was against abortion.
Does that make me anti-Catholic?"
In spite of constant criticism, Mc-
Closkey continues to publicly defend
his Middle Eastern policies. "I regret
the debate," he said. "I hate to ex
asperate the issue but no one speaks
out. You have to bring the issues to
the people. That's what a political
process is all about."
McCloskey compared the criticism
and his constant attempts to vin
dicate his point of view, to the first
time he presented his National Youth
Service proposal which called for
mandatory military or volunteer ser
vice. "I presented that policy for the
first time at Stanford because these
were the people it most involved,"
he said.
McCloskey will be on campus for a
constituent meeting April 10.
