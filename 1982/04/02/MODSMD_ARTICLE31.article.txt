### Associated Press 
Montreal — George Allen,
president and chief operating
officer of the Montreal
Alouettes, left Thursday for
Harrisburg, Pa., sparking
speculation that he had re
signed his position with the Ca
nadian Football League club.
"I've been getting calls from
all over asking if it's true that Al
len left and wouldn't be com
ing back," an Alouettes'
spokesman said. "The fact is
that George's son Bruce, a vice
president of the team, is get
ting married in Harrisburg on
Saturday.
"George said he'll be back
and that by Monday or Tuesday
there'll be an announcement
to clarify the situation here. I
wouldn't be surprised if he
comes back with his banker or
money man."
Allen had expressed surprise
and dismay when Harry Or
nest, a Los Angeles busi

nessman, arrived Wednesday
with a mandate from team
owner Nelson Skalbania to act
as his "stand-in" and governor.
Ornest's arrival followed re
ports that Skalbania had turned
over his controlling interest in
the team to Ornest as payment
of a $1.3-million debt said to
derive from Skalbania's
purchase two years ago of the
Vancouver Canadians' Triple A
baseball team in the Pacific
Coast League.
Allen, who joined the
Alouettes in February, has
signed an option agreement
giving him and California busi
nessman Bill Harris the op
portunity to buy the club from
Skalbania. Allen and Harris
have been reported to have
until the end of the year to buy
51 percent of the club — 20
percent already is being held in
escrow in Allen's name — and
until December, 1983, to
purchase the other 49 percent.
