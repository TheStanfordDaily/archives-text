# Keeping a responsible media

### Mark Zeigler 
Bob Maynard is something
of a trend setter. He is the first
black editor and publisher of a
major metropolitan newspaper
in the United States.
However, hearing him talk,
one gets the impression that
that is beside the point. What is
important is that Maynard, as
much as a trend setter he may
be, works as the publisher and
editor of a major metropolitan
newspaper; there is a job to be
done. And Maynard does it.
But while he sifts through pa
pers on his desk or meets peo
ple in the community he
serves, Maynard looks ahead in
journalism's crystal ball. If what
he sees eventually occurs,
there will be no job to be done
in the press.
"I suggest that we (journal
ists) are not here to stay forev
er, unless we learn to live in a
different world,' he said, dur
ing a talk before 20 com
munications students here
Tuesday.
"There is nothing that guar
antees us a place in America,'
he explained. Maynard said he
does not buy the argument that
the Constitution's First
Amendment ensures print
journalism's survival. "I don't
think thai true for a minute,"
he said.
Maynard contrasted the sta
tus of the print media as
portrayed in the movies, All the
President's Men and the more

recent film, Absence of Malice.
"In the wake of that (All the
President's Men), people
began to look more closely and
found us wanting in ways that
are indefensible. We have be
come pretty much as arrogant
as Absense of Malice depicts.
"There is more than a small
seed of truth in what those
movies say,' he continued.
Maynard has certainly had a
ring-side seat from which to
view the action in the press
during the near decade that
passed between the two mov
ies. He worked on the Wash
ington Post for a number of
years and was the Post's Om
budsman during the Watergate
controversy.
"If you look at All the Pesi
dent's Men, you get a white
hatted view of journalism,' he
said. But Absence of Malice, re
leased in 1981, portrays the
press as the 'bad guys,' " he
said.
Maynard described what he
calls the "Woodstein syn
drome" or sensationalizing in
vestigative reporting on the
movie screen. He expressed his
distaste for the type of report
ing whose only objective is to
unveil scandal at any cost by
scolding All the President's
Men for facetiously offering in
vestigative reporting as a "way
to become famous, while
young, and rich."
Once, a budding journalist

told Maynard that his only oc
cupational goal was to uncover
the corrupt behavior of a gov
ernment official. Maynard told
him that he was in the wrong
profession — that he should
become a district prosecutor if
that was what he wanted to do.
"We're all so fascinated in
winning our next prize by
hanging somebody that we
have forgotten to serve the
public in the time of critical im
portance,' he said.
While Maynard indeed
speculates, he is a doer as well
as a thinker. What he sees
wrong with the American press
as a whole he tries to eradicate
in the Trib. Since he became
editor in August, 1979, May
nard said "the role of the news
paper (in Oakland) has
changed in that I have begun to
give the people a framework in
which to view the immediate
community as well as domestic
and international events.
"We try to be something of a
rallying point in the communi
ty, in helping people think
things through. We are the
citizen's companion."
However,. a Maynard-run
newspaper does not shy away
from local problems like crime,
racism, unemployment and
education.
"We report about the prob
lem not in casual ways, but in
the form of anin-depth study.
Sure, we've got problems, but

let's not shove them under the
rug. Instead, let's get them out
in the open and find ways of
solving them,' he explained.
Maynard, the youngest of six
children, was raised in
Brooklyn, New York. "My
father spent a lot of time at
church and a lot of time around
the dinner table, teaching us
how to think straight,' he said.
The editor and publisher
thinks an upbringing in such a
"rich atmosphere'T'there
were books all over the house
and every kid knew at least one
foreign language") directly in
fluenced his present news

papering ideals.
"I believe in family-oriented
newspapers," he commented.
"I believe in the kind of news
paper you can open and have
your kids view with you.
"I care about what's happen
ing to the modern family."
As an editor, the name of the
game for Maynard is mobility.
He usually drives to work a dif
ferent way each morning so as
to keep his eyes open to all
parts of Oakland.
"I can't tell you how many
story ideas I get a week by just
talking to people," Maynard
said.
