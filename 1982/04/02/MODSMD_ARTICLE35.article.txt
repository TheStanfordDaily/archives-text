## Maxwell's Plum 
### Joan O'Connell 
From that corner of the
Ghiradelli Square pie which
used to house Senor Pico's,
little Warner Leßoy reached
in hisfingerandpulledouta
plum — Maxwell's Plum
that is, one of San Francis
co's newest high-profiled,
high-priced, high-timed
dining experiences.
Leßoy, a New York
restaurateur who owns the
East Coast establishment of
the same name, spent more
than $7 million renovating
the premises for the Plum's
opening last summer. From
the fresh flowers on the
table, to the grand, some say
elaborate, some say gauche
decor, to the orange and
yellow tints streaming
through the windows as the
sun set on the bay, to the
wild boar on the menu,
he was clearly not afraid to
take chances.
A bit of the trendiness has
worn off now — but not it's
popularity. With four dining
:•

rooms under its Tiffany
glass roof, Maxwell's Plum
serves more than 1000 din
ners most nights. On the
night we visted, we were the
first seated for dinner at
5:30; the hosts and hos
tesses, waiters, busboys and
other attendants obviously
outnumbered the patrons,
but as the evening
progressed and the restau
rants filled, the attentive
service did not diminish.
The restaurant has clearly
made a commitment to
good service and neither is
the wine level in one's glass
allowed to dip too deeply
nor are diners rushed
through their meals.
We began with asparagus
with pecan sauce and clam
appetizers; the asparagus
was especially good, with a
generous sprinkling of
pecans over the tender tips.
A spinach salad followed
which was adequate, but

nothing special, likely due
to the standard house dress
ing with which it is served.
Fora main dish I chose the
charcoal grilled duck while
my companion picked the
poached salmon. While the
salmon was cooked per
fectly, the hollandaise sauce
was a surprising disappoint
ment. A bit flat and alto
gether too floury, it nearly
succeeded in masking the
fine quality of the fish.
The duck meanwhile was
indeed succulent, with a de
licious raisin and raspberry
sauce.
Accompanying all meals
is a basket of warm bread
with both sourdough and
raisin varieties, but you
should probably try to stave
off your urge to wolf
through that in order to save
room for the dinner — and
at all costs, dessert. The des
sert menu offers quite a
selection; we chose pecan

pie and chocolate mousse.
Fortunately it doesn't
seem to have fallen the way
of many restaurants in
Ghiradelli and along the
wharf, in that diners are not
rushed and there are few
"It's my last night in the City
and I might as well blow my
wad" types who wander in
carrying shopping bags with
loaves of French bread pok
ing out.
Enjoy the food, the view,
the people, the fresh
flowers, the little Indian
woman who sits on the stairs
outside selling flowers, but
be prepared to pay for it —
the tab is hefty.
But if you're lucky the ad
venture will leave you with
the same far away look in
your eye that my dinner
partner had when he
watched that sunset and
said, "To think that a kid
from the midwest could end
up here — ah, I must be liv
in' right."
