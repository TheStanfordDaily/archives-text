# Au Chambertin
## 
### Howard Sewell 
Though hardly renowned as a center of
fine cuisine, the city of Los Altos can pride
itself on harboring one example of what can
only be described as a truly superlative dining
establishment. Au Chambertin, tucked in
near the corner of Main and State streets, is a
restaurant that offers not only a bill of fare
scarcely dodged by perfection, but a cultural
experience that should not be missed.
Inside, the owners have gone to great
lengths to provide an atmosphere that is both
elegant and very French, but at the same time
intimate and personal. To accomplish this, in
lieu of one large dining area, the restaurant is
divided up into four smaller rooms, each seat
ing about 12 or so, which creates very handily
an impression of one's own private dining
room. Dotted sparsely amongst the rooms are
bookcases, china cabinets, and other items of
furniture. Between them the walls are deco
rated tastefully with an impressive assortment
of French artwork and all is interspersed with
various plants and other greenery. The
candles atop each table together with wall fix
tures made the lighting subdued but not at all
dark. At times it was hard to imagine we were
actually in a restaurant.
We tasted three hors d'oeuvres: the fiist
was the house pate, a marvelous concoction
consisting mainly of duck and livened with
Grand Marnier. It was very light and served as
a delightful introduction. The pate was fol
lowed by "O'Escargots et Ris de Veau Facon
Chamberlain" (the name of which I give in
French because as "Snails and Sweetbreads"
it tends to lose something in the translation).
These were prepared in a light pastry shell
and the sauce was a Bordelaise made with
Cabernet Sauvignon and a light touch of gar
lic. Escargots unto themselves aren't the most
flavorful things, often dependent on sauce
for taste, and since this sauce lacked sub
stance, the entire thing was rather uninspir
ing. We decided that perhaps a heavier touch
of garlic would have helped. After the esca
rgots came what must have been the visual
highlight of the evening: "La Salade Johann
Strauss" or, more simply, Spinach salad

flambe. 3
Au Chambertin sports an extensive wine
list — the choices ranged from a selection of
native California wines to a Chateau Lafitte . V
Rothschild which, least you be tempted, goes,.,,
for over $1000. At our waiter's recommenda
tion we selected a 1980 Mount Eden
Chardonnay, a light semi-dry white wine
which, needless to say, was marvelous.
At the risk of sounding overcome with
praise, the main course was nothing short of
impeccable. My choice was "La Supreme de
Volaille aux Huitres" or Breast of Chicken
(another dish that sounds better in French).
The chicken itself was light and tender, but
the highlight was the sauce, made from a re
duction of chicken stock, oysters and cham
pagne — magnificent. My dining companion
was treated to the Broiled Halibut, one of the
three fresh fish of the day and one tastefully
dressed with shrimp, mushrooms and grapes.
We were hard pressed to find fault with it. . *"
For dessert we settled on the Bananas
Forster and a house specialty aptly named
"Chocolate Velvet." Bananas Forster features
a sauce of butter, brown sugar, ice crearfiV
rum and banana liqueur. This was flambe
also, so we were treated to another
pyrotechnic display a la spinach salad. As for
the taste, I think the ingredients speak for
themselves. Chocolate Velvet is a gateau
made strictly for chocolate addicts compris
ing of, among other things, chocolate mousse
and fresh whipped cream. It was a little rich
for my tastes, but was met with much ap
preciation across the table.
Au Chambertin is not cheap, but for a place
of this quality, it may in fact be quite reason
able. The main dishes are all around $14 to $15
per person (many are made for two), and »•
Hors d'Oeuvres range from $2.50 to Escargots
at $7.50 per person. Wine is priced at $15 and
up and dessert averages about $6 per person. <
Service throughout the evening was timely
and the friendly attitude of the waiters was a
pleasant change of pace. Our host, Fred
Kernbach, was always at hand and was of tre
mendous help in making choices along the
way. It became readily apparent that Au
Chambertin attempts to be something out
of-the-ordinary in French restaurants — I
think it succeeds. It is a very special place and •
deserves the heartiest recommendation.

scarcely dodged by perfection, but a cultural
experience that should not be missed.
Inside, the owners have gone to great
lengths to provide an atmosphere that is both
elegant and very French, but at the same time
intimate and personal. To accomplish this, in
lieu of one large dining area, the restaurant is
divided up into four smaller rooms, each seat
ing about 12 or so, which creates very handily
an impression of one's own private dining
room. Dotted sparsely amongst the rooms are
bookcases, china cabinets, and other items of
furniture. Between them the walls are deco
rated tastefully with an impressive assortment
of French artwork and all is interspersed with
various plants and other greenery. The
candles atop each table together with wall fix
tures made the lighting subdued but not at all
dark. At times it was hard to imagine we were
actually in a restaurant.
We tasted three hors d'oeuvres: the fiist
was the house pate, a marvelous concoction
consisting mainly of duck and livened with
Grand Marnier. It was very light and served as
a delightful introduction. The pate was fol
lowed by "O'Escargots et Ris de Veau Facon
Chamberlain" (the name of which I give in
French because as "Snails and Sweetbreads"
it tends to lose something in the translation).
These were prepared in a light pastry shell
and the sauce was a Bordelaise made with
Cabernet Sauvignon and a light touch of gar
lic. Escargots unto themselves aren't the most
flavorful things, often dependent on sauce
for taste, and since this sauce lacked sub
stance, the entire thing was rather uninspir
ing. We decided that perhaps a heavier touch
of garlic would have helped. After the esca
rgots came what must have been the visual
highlight of the evening: "La Salade Johann
Strauss" or, more simply, Spinach salad

flambe. 3
Au Chambertin sports an extensive wine
list — the choices ranged from a selection of
native California wines to a Chateau Lafitte . V
Rothschild which, least you be tempted, goes,.,,
for over $1000. At our waiter's recommenda
tion we selected a 1980 Mount Eden
Chardonnay, a light semi-dry white wine
which, needless to say, was marvelous.
At the risk of sounding overcome with
praise, the main course was nothing short of
impeccable. My choice was "La Supreme de
Volaille aux Huitres" or Breast of Chicken
(another dish that sounds better in French).
The chicken itself was light and tender, but
the highlight was the sauce, made from a re
duction of chicken stock, oysters and cham
pagne — magnificent. My dining companion
was treated to the Broiled Halibut, one of the
three fresh fish of the day and one tastefully
dressed with shrimp, mushrooms and grapes.
We were hard pressed to find fault with it. . *"
For dessert we settled on the Bananas
Forster and a house specialty aptly named
"Chocolate Velvet." Bananas Forster features
a sauce of butter, brown sugar, ice crearfiV
rum and banana liqueur. This was flambe
also, so we were treated to another
pyrotechnic display a la spinach salad. As for
the taste, I think the ingredients speak for
themselves. Chocolate Velvet is a gateau
made strictly for chocolate addicts compris
ing of, among other things, chocolate mousse
and fresh whipped cream. It was a little rich
for my tastes, but was met with much ap
preciation across the table.
Au Chambertin is not cheap, but for a place
of this quality, it may in fact be quite reason
able. The main dishes are all around $14 to $15
per person (many are made for two), and »•
Hors d'Oeuvres range from $2.50 to Escargots
at $7.50 per person. Wine is priced at $15 and
up and dessert averages about $6 per person. <
Service throughout the evening was timely
and the friendly attitude of the waiters was a
pleasant change of pace. Our host, Fred
Kernbach, was always at hand and was of tre
mendous help in making choices along the
way. It became readily apparent that Au
Chambertin attempts to be something out
of-the-ordinary in French restaurants — I
think it succeeds. It is a very special place and •
deserves the heartiest recommendation.
