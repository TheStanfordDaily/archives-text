## Klugh offers sensible melodies, accessibly packaged 
### Mark Bucko air Klugh 
irde Star Theatre/San Carlos
I March 1982
Earl Klugh, guitar in hand,
rasped a mike with the other
id said in a shy, slightly lisping
lice, "I can't sing, I can't
ance, I just play this thing,"
olding up his acoustic nylon
tring. To the delighted
hoops and hollers of this near
ull Circle Star crowd, Klugh
Bunched into yet anther
lumber featuring his in

credibly melodic plinking and
plunking over a lush jazz/funk
base that has become his musi
cal trademark.
Klugh's music is not
groundbreaking or earthshat
tering, nor is it meant to be.
Anyone who plays a nylon
acoustic, like the one your
mom bought you for your first
set of guitar lessons because a
steel string acoustic was too ex
pensive, is not out to increase
social consciousness and

change the world with his mu
sic. He's out to entertain, doing
what he does best. And Klugh
plays jazz on that riylon
acoustic like no one else.
Klugh's March 14th show
was a well-paced affair, con
centrating on his more recent
music, especially from the new
album "Crazy For You." His
band, made upof a solid group
of well-known studio jazz ar
tists, handled Klugh's music
with deftness and ease, never

intruding on his acoustic work,
but laying dowp the jazz and
funk bases that kept the racially
mixed crowd bouncing in their
seats for 90 minutes.
And here lies the great apeal
of Klugh's music. He has suc
cessfully merged the uncom
monly used acoustic lead with
a pleasant brand of fusion that
creates a refreshing diversion
from the horn, alto sax and
keyboard leads that have be
come a dime a dozen in late
70's early 80's fusion. This was a
show to bounce your feet to â€”
while staring 'awestruck at
Klugh's fingers dancing on the
fretboard.
Klugh by no means entirely
dominated the show. He al
lowed his players to take the
spotlight a number of times, in
cluding on numbers written by
keyboard player Darrl Dybka
and drummer Gene Dunlap.

'I just play this thing'

Klugh even played the piano
on one tune while electric lead
player Parry Hughes blazed
away.
Sound at the Circle Star is top
rate and up to par with Klugh's
fine production work in the
studio. The brass accents he
often uses were notably miss
ing but the lack of a string sec
tion gave the show a bit of a raw
edge all too often taken away
by heavy string tracks.
Klugh's new album, "Crazy
For You," is his most ambitious
work to date. The credits on
the cover look like a who's who
list of all star studio musicians.
The album is typical Klugh
with a little more variation than
usual. "I'm Ready For Your
Love" leads off, a tune with Ray
Parker written all over it. Parker
arranged, played electric
guitar, bass and drums on this
tune, the albums best, a fine
example of Klugh's ability to

cross over to both white and
black audiences. "Broadway
Ramble" changes directions
with a laid back country beat
and a harmonica lead from
Hubie Crawford, Klugh's bass
player on the road.
Klugh takes another tack
with "Calypso Getaway", a ro
mantic slow dance tune if there
ever was one. "Calypso" is fol
lowed by "The Rainmaker," as
close to rock and roll as Klugh
ever gets, featuring some of his
fastest guitar work, a 62 piece
orchestra and a blazing horn
section. Fortunately Klugh uses
great restraint with the 62

piecer, but why he needs that
many players is beyond me.
The record once again does an
about face with "Balladina," a
syrupy ballad with too much
orchestra. I suppose Earl had to
let these people earn their pay
checks somehow.
Thealbum ends with the title
track, a finely crafted song with
a trademark Klugh melody and
gutsy bass playing by Charles
Meek. "Crazy For You" is a
perfect example of Klugh's
ability to combine jazz/funk
roots with his sensitive
melodies into an accessible
package appealing to a wide

audience.
Music of this sort is difficult
to judge objectively; you
either like it or you don't. It's
the right medicine for the
acoustic guitar lover but
doesn't cut loose enough for
the hard core funkster. Klugh
just keeps on doing what he
loves to do and keeps on sell
ing records. This stuff is predic
table but unlike mainstream
pop is not calculated just to
sell, if only because it just
doesn't receive massive F.M.
airplay. Here is an artist who
puts his all into his craft and
produces agreeable results. I
for one can't knock that.
