Nearly everyone has heard
Jobby Short sing, but hardly
inyone knows who he is. If you
cnew that the voice that sings
'There's a fragrance that's here
today..really belonged to
the round-faced little black
man at the piano, and that said
man is one of the world's great
lounge singers (song stylist,
cabaret artist, whatever), then
you've probably been spend
ing too much time on the top
floors of hotels sipping Remy
Martin.
Actually, it is appropriate
that Short's greatest exposure
has come in a perfume com
mercial, because Short works
on an audience the way an ex
pensive scent is supposed to
work on a man. One likes Short
not so much for the way he
sings as for the sense of privi
lege one gets from being in his
presence. When he glides to
the piano in his black dinner
jacket, flashes his teeth in a de
cidedly feline smile, and starts
to play, you know you're in on
something the rest of the world
doesn't know about. You even
start to think about buying a

dinner jacket.
Barn-like nightclubs that seat
hundreds are not Short's
milieu, and his week-long en
gagement at The Boarding
House last month was an un
usual, if not a special, event. At
tendance was poor, despite ads
proclaiming "Bobby Short,
direct from European en
gagements"; there were only
about 40 Short aficionados
huddled near the stage for the
Friday late show I saw. Much of
what Short does on stage in
volves the care and feeding of
atmosphere, and The Boarding
House must have presented
him with special problems —
it's harder to feel privileged in a
big, ugly, mostly empty room
where you're being charged $8
a bottle for Wente Grey Riesl
ing. But Short, as it turned out,
was up to the challenge — he
cast his spell so effectively in
the hollows of The Boarding
House, you would have
thought you were in the Cafe
Carlyle.
Short's repertoire may have
something to do with the nar
rowness of his appeal. It con
sists mainly of old show tunes
— lots of Gershwin and Porter
— with an occasional "Georgia
On My Mind" thrown in for
the romantics in the audience.
His token post-1950 sons this

night was another show tune,
Sondheim's "Good Thing
Going" from Merrily We Roll
Along. There's no swing, noth
ing jazzy, few ballads — Short's
song selection is of a piece with
his dress and his feline manner,
and it enforces an unrelenting
sophistication. Short's goal is to
make you listen to the lyrics.
He's a bit like an evangelist for
the great lyricistsof the '20sand
'30s and '40s — not only does
he resurrect the songs, but he
uses all the vocal and physical
tricks learned in 35 years of
singing to point up every pun,
every clever rhyme, every line
that seems to hold more syl
lables than is humanly possible
to sing. When he intones, "and
oh so, very, very," and then
leads the audience in a sing
along of the chorus, it's just,
well, too marvellous for words.
Early in the show, Short re
marked on the strangeness of
his being "on stage," but said,
"that's how it should be —
you're out there, being quiet
and attentive, and we're up
here doing our best for you."
And then he put his palms to
gether and rolled his eyes and
looked for all the world like he
wanted to purr. Bobby Short
may give a great cat im
pression, but it's the audience
that ends up getting stroked.
