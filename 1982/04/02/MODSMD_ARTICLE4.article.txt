U.S. approaches talks with El Salvador right
Washington — A senior State Department official saic yesterday that
Roberto D'Aubuisson, the right-wing El Salvador political leader who
has been banned from the United States since May, 1980, will be per
mitted "in the future" to come to this country and meet with U.S. poli
cymakers.
Thomas Enders, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, re
vealed this shift of attitude toward D'Aubuisson as speculation con
tinued about whether the Reagan administration will be willing to sup
port a new Salvadoran government in which the cashiered former army
officer has a major role or influence.
In Sunday's Salvadoran elections for a constituent assembly,
D'Aubuisson's National Republican Alliance, known as ARENA, won 19
of the 60 seats. That makes him the potential kingmaker in the efforts of
five rightist parties to form a provisional government that would ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party, unofficially favored by
the United States.
At a nationally televised news conference Wednesday, President
Ronald Reagan refused to answer questions about whether he would
continue military and economic support to a D'Aubuisson-influenced
government. However, U.S. officials have been giving unmistakable sig
nals to Congress and the public that it might be necessary to deal with a
rightist Salvadoran government if it promises to pursue policies of re
form and further democratization.
In an interview yesterday with the National Public Radio program
"Communique," to be broadcast this weekend, Enders said he didn't
"envisage any immediate meetings up here with any of the current
leaders" in El Salvador's political manuevering. But he added that "it
would be quite normal in the future that we would meet here and
elsewhere."
Asked specifically about D'Aubuisson, Enders replied: "In the future,
absolutely, we would expect to see him and the others up here. I don't
want to single him out. I don't think he would receive any different
treatment than the others."
Enders' remarks represented a considerable
shift away from the arms-length posture the
United States had taken toward D'Aubuisson,
who was described by former U.S. ambassador
Robert White as a "pathological killer" and who
has been linked repeatedly to incipient military
coups and paramilitary terrorist activities.
In May, 1980, the Carter administration re
voked his visa to the United States, and when he
turned up here a month later, he was expelled.
In March, 1981, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and other senior Reagan administration
officials vehemently denied D'Aubuisson's
public contention that U.S. officials had led him
to believe they would not oppose a coup in El
Salvador.
The administration, at that time, called
D'Aubuisson's statements "pure fiction,"
stressed that he was not in contact with U.S. of
ficials and made clear that the ban on him
would continue.
Brezhnev taken to hospital
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev's health "deteriorated seriously" dur
ing his recent trip to Uzbekistan and he was
taken on a stretcher from the airport to a hospi
tal upon his return here last week, according to
well-informed Soviet sources.
The sources quoted Brezhnev's doctors as
saying they expected the 75-year-old Soviet
leader to recover but that he would have to re
main in the hospital "for weeks." A meeting of
the Communist Party Central Commmittee that
was to have been held here this week has been
postponed until May 24, the sources said.
The Soviet sources, who aiso disclosed that
Brezhnev suffered a mild heart attack in early
February, suggested that he may have had a
mild stroke aboard the plane carrying him from
Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to Moscow
on March 25.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry would
not comment on the report.
While reporting a "serious worsening" of his
health, the sources did not suggest that the So
viet leader was incapacitated.
The apparent deterioration of his condition,
however, has focused new attention on his
trusted lieutenant, Politburo member Konstan
tin Chernenko, who is understood to be cur
rently in charge of day-to-day affairs.
Chernenko, 70, who has been an associate of
Brezhnev's since 1950, suddenly appeared at
the peak of Kremlin authority last year when he
leapfrogged over several other Soviet politi
cians to fourth ranking at the party congress, af
ter Brezhnev, ideologist Mikhail Suslov and An
drei Kirilenko, a Politburo veteran of more than
20 years. The four were the only ones to be
elected both Politburo members and party sec
retaries.
More dead found at Tahoe
Alpine Meadows, Calif. — A team of 75
rescue workers, racing against heavy snow and

the gathering darkness, found three more bod
ies yesterday, raising the death toll to six in the
massive avalanche that hit here. At least two
others are missing.
The searchers dug out the three bodies near
the main lodge of this ski resort on the north
shore of Lake Tahoe. The victims were not im
mediately identified.
The rescue workers had made their way on
skis over the resort's parking lot, covered by 20
feet of snow, and to the lodge, where three vic
tims had been found dead Wednesday night,
several hours after the avalanche struck.
The searchers carried 10-foot-long aluminum
poles to thrust into the snow and electronic
beacons to signal their location if they should
become buried in another slide. With them
were four specially trained search dogs.
"We don't really know how many victims we
are looking for," said Placer County Sheriff's
Sgt. Steven Reader.
U.S. officials claim nuclear
deterrence is credible
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's as
sertion that the Soviets enjoy a "definite margin
of superiority" in atomic weapons and could
withstand a U.S. retaliatory strike does not
mean that Moscow has nothing to fear from the
U.S. nuclear arsenal, administration officials
said yesterday.
At his news conference Wednesday night,
the president said that if the Soviets should hit
the United States with a nuclear first strike
"their great edge is one in which they could ab
sorb our retaliatory blow and hit us again."
No president ever described U.S., vulner
ability quite so starkly in a statement to the na
tion. As a result, Reagan's remark sparked con
cern in some quarters about whether U.S. nu
clear forces had lost their capacity to deter an
attack by Moscow.
In reply to questions yesterday, State Depart
ment nuclear arms specialist Richard Burt noted
that the president did not say the Russians could
mount a nuclear first strike without fear of U.S.
retaliation.
"I think what the president was referring to
... is that we are concerned that the Soviet
Union with these large new intercontinental
ballistic missiles has the capability to destroy a
large fraction of our systems, and we do not
possess an equivalent capability," Burt said.
Department of State spokesman Dean Fischer
likewise said that Reagan was referring to the
ability of Soviet heavy missiles to destroy many
U.S. land-based missiles, the most accurate
weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Budget opposition emerges
Washington — Despite claims of progress in
White House-congressional budget nego
tiations, major roadblocks emerged yesterday
in the two Senate committees that are taking
the lead in trying to assemble an alternative to
President Ronald Reagan's unpopular budget

for next year.
Bipartisan opposition surfaced in the Senate
Finance Committee to creation of a new corpo
rate minimum tax — a key element of both ad
ministration and congressional revenue-raising
drives. And Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) perhaps
the most skillful tax legislator, declared his
strong support for corporate tax sale provisions,
giving proponents of the controversial section
of the 1981 tax bill a key ally.
In the Senate Budget Committee, several Re
publicans declared that Congress should not
wait for tax and spending concessions from
Reagan, but Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
warned even more bluntly than before that
Reagan has to move first if Democrats are going
to support a compromise. "He's going to have
to lead ... to admit he has a problem," said
Hollings.
Dems attack budget cuts
Washington — Citing statistics from federal
agencies, congressional Democrats yesterday
challenged President Ronald Reagan's re
assurances that budget cuts are not hurting
child immunization and other programs for the
nation's poor.
"Unfortunately, the president's defense of
his program was not only misleading, but in sev
eral cases, completely inaccurate," House
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) charged in a
House speech.
Statistics from the federal Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta show that the Reagan admin
istration's budget "cuts off polio and measles
vaccinations for over 2 million children this year
and even more next year," said Rep. Henry
Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Commerce Subcommittee on Health.
Waxman and Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.)
challenged Reagan's assertion that the federal
supplemental feeding program for women, in
fants and children has not been cut back under
1983 budget proposals.
At his press conference Wednesday, the pres
ident said a newspaper editorial was mistaken in
saying the program had been cut. "I'm sure at
first glance they must have thought something
had happened. It's been merged with another
program and is in there at much greater money
than it has ever had before," Reagan said.
Stock market rallies
New York — Energy issues led a broad rally in
the stock market yesterday that carried the Dow
Jones industrial average to a seven-week high.
Trading picked up from its recent sluggish
pace as the advance gathered momentum.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 10.47 to 833.24, its highest close since it
finished at 833.81 on Feb. 14. '

"envisage any immediate meetings up here with any of the current
leaders" in El Salvador's political manuevering. But he added that "it
would be quite normal in the future that we would meet here and
elsewhere."
Asked specifically about D'Aubuisson, Enders replied: "In the future,
absolutely, we would expect to see him and the others up here. I don't
want to single him out. I don't think he would receive any different
treatment than the others."
Enders' remarks represented a considerable
shift away from the arms-length posture the
United States had taken toward D'Aubuisson,
who was described by former U.S. ambassador
Robert White as a "pathological killer" and who
has been linked repeatedly to incipient military
coups and paramilitary terrorist activities.
In May, 1980, the Carter administration re
voked his visa to the United States, and when he
turned up here a month later, he was expelled.
In March, 1981, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and other senior Reagan administration
officials vehemently denied D'Aubuisson's
public contention that U.S. officials had led him
to believe they would not oppose a coup in El
Salvador.
The administration, at that time, called
D'Aubuisson's statements "pure fiction,"
stressed that he was not in contact with U.S. of
ficials and made clear that the ban on him
would continue.
Brezhnev taken to hospital
Moscow — Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev's health "deteriorated seriously" dur
ing his recent trip to Uzbekistan and he was
taken on a stretcher from the airport to a hospi
tal upon his return here last week, according to
well-informed Soviet sources.
The sources quoted Brezhnev's doctors as
saying they expected the 75-year-old Soviet
leader to recover but that he would have to re
main in the hospital "for weeks." A meeting of
the Communist Party Central Commmittee that
was to have been held here this week has been
postponed until May 24, the sources said.
The Soviet sources, who aiso disclosed that
Brezhnev suffered a mild heart attack in early
February, suggested that he may have had a
mild stroke aboard the plane carrying him from
Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to Moscow
on March 25.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry would
not comment on the report.
While reporting a "serious worsening" of his
health, the sources did not suggest that the So
viet leader was incapacitated.
The apparent deterioration of his condition,
however, has focused new attention on his
trusted lieutenant, Politburo member Konstan
tin Chernenko, who is understood to be cur
rently in charge of day-to-day affairs.
Chernenko, 70, who has been an associate of
Brezhnev's since 1950, suddenly appeared at
the peak of Kremlin authority last year when he
leapfrogged over several other Soviet politi
cians to fourth ranking at the party congress, af
ter Brezhnev, ideologist Mikhail Suslov and An
drei Kirilenko, a Politburo veteran of more than
20 years. The four were the only ones to be
elected both Politburo members and party sec
retaries.
More dead found at Tahoe
Alpine Meadows, Calif. — A team of 75
rescue workers, racing against heavy snow and

the gathering darkness, found three more bod
ies yesterday, raising the death toll to six in the
massive avalanche that hit here. At least two
others are missing.
The searchers dug out the three bodies near
the main lodge of this ski resort on the north
shore of Lake Tahoe. The victims were not im
mediately identified.
The rescue workers had made their way on
skis over the resort's parking lot, covered by 20
feet of snow, and to the lodge, where three vic
tims had been found dead Wednesday night,
several hours after the avalanche struck.
The searchers carried 10-foot-long aluminum
poles to thrust into the snow and electronic
beacons to signal their location if they should
become buried in another slide. With them
were four specially trained search dogs.
"We don't really know how many victims we
are looking for," said Placer County Sheriff's
Sgt. Steven Reader.
U.S. officials claim nuclear
deterrence is credible
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's as
sertion that the Soviets enjoy a "definite margin
of superiority" in atomic weapons and could
withstand a U.S. retaliatory strike does not
mean that Moscow has nothing to fear from the
U.S. nuclear arsenal, administration officials
said yesterday.
At his news conference Wednesday night,
the president said that if the Soviets should hit
the United States with a nuclear first strike
"their great edge is one in which they could ab
sorb our retaliatory blow and hit us again."
No president ever described U.S., vulner
ability quite so starkly in a statement to the na
tion. As a result, Reagan's remark sparked con
cern in some quarters about whether U.S. nu
clear forces had lost their capacity to deter an
attack by Moscow.
In reply to questions yesterday, State Depart
ment nuclear arms specialist Richard Burt noted
that the president did not say the Russians could
mount a nuclear first strike without fear of U.S.
retaliation.
"I think what the president was referring to
... is that we are concerned that the Soviet
Union with these large new intercontinental
ballistic missiles has the capability to destroy a
large fraction of our systems, and we do not
possess an equivalent capability," Burt said.
Department of State spokesman Dean Fischer
likewise said that Reagan was referring to the
ability of Soviet heavy missiles to destroy many
U.S. land-based missiles, the most accurate
weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Budget opposition emerges
Washington — Despite claims of progress in
White House-congressional budget nego
tiations, major roadblocks emerged yesterday
in the two Senate committees that are taking
the lead in trying to assemble an alternative to
President Ronald Reagan's unpopular budget

for next year.
Bipartisan opposition surfaced in the Senate
Finance Committee to creation of a new corpo
rate minimum tax — a key element of both ad
ministration and congressional revenue-raising
drives. And Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) perhaps
the most skillful tax legislator, declared his
strong support for corporate tax sale provisions,
giving proponents of the controversial section
of the 1981 tax bill a key ally.
In the Senate Budget Committee, several Re
publicans declared that Congress should not
wait for tax and spending concessions from
Reagan, but Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
warned even more bluntly than before that
Reagan has to move first if Democrats are going
to support a compromise. "He's going to have
to lead ... to admit he has a problem," said
Hollings.
Dems attack budget cuts
Washington — Citing statistics from federal
agencies, congressional Democrats yesterday
challenged President Ronald Reagan's re
assurances that budget cuts are not hurting
child immunization and other programs for the
nation's poor.
"Unfortunately, the president's defense of
his program was not only misleading, but in sev
eral cases, completely inaccurate," House
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) charged in a
House speech.
Statistics from the federal Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta show that the Reagan admin
istration's budget "cuts off polio and measles
vaccinations for over 2 million children this year
and even more next year," said Rep. Henry
Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Commerce Subcommittee on Health.
Waxman and Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.)
challenged Reagan's assertion that the federal
supplemental feeding program for women, in
fants and children has not been cut back under
1983 budget proposals.
At his press conference Wednesday, the pres
ident said a newspaper editorial was mistaken in
saying the program had been cut. "I'm sure at
first glance they must have thought something
had happened. It's been merged with another
program and is in there at much greater money
than it has ever had before," Reagan said.
Stock market rallies
New York — Energy issues led a broad rally in

U.S. approaches talks with El Salvador right
Washington — A senior State Department official saic yesterday that
Roberto D'Aubuisson, the right-wing El Salvador political leader who
has been banned from the United States since May, 1980, will be per
mitted "in the future" to come to this country and meet with U.S. poli
cymakers.
Thomas Enders, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, re
vealed this shift of attitude toward D'Aubuisson as speculation con
tinued about whether the Reagan administration will be willing to sup
port a new Salvadoran government in which the cashiered former army
officer has a major role or influence.
In Sunday's Salvadoran elections for a constituent assembly,
D'Aubuisson's National Republican Alliance, known as ARENA, won 19
of the 60 seats. That makes him the potential kingmaker in the efforts of
five rightist parties to form a provisional government that would ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party, unofficially favored by
the United States.
At a nationally televised news conference Wednesday, President
Ronald Reagan refused to answer questions about whether he would
continue military and economic support to a D'Aubuisson-influenced
government. However, U.S. officials have been giving unmistakable sig
nals to Congress and the public that it might be necessary to deal with a
rightist Salvadoran government if it promises to pursue policies of re
form and further democratization.
In an interview yesterday with the National Public Radio program
"Communique," to be broadcast this weekend, Enders said he didn't
"envisage any immediate meetings up here with any of the current
leaders" in El Salvador's political manuevering. But he added that "it

ing his recent trip to Uzbekistan and he was
taken on a stretcher from the airport to a hospi
tal upon his return here last week, according to
well-informed Soviet sources.
The sources quoted Brezhnev's doctors as
saying they expected the 75-year-old Soviet
leader to recover but that he would have to re
main in the hospital "for weeks." A meeting of
the Communist Party Central Commmittee that
was to have been held here this week has been
postponed until May 24, the sources said.
The Soviet sources, who aiso disclosed that
Brezhnev suffered a mild heart attack in early
February, suggested that he may have had a
mild stroke aboard the plane carrying him from
Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to Moscow
on March 25.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry would
not comment on the report.
While reporting a "serious worsening" of his
health, the sources did not suggest that the So
viet leader was incapacitated.
The apparent deterioration of his condition,
however, has focused new attention on his
trusted lieutenant, Politburo member Konstan
tin Chernenko, who is understood to be cur
rently in charge of day-to-day affairs.
Chernenko, 70, who has been an associate of
Brezhnev's since 1950, suddenly appeared at
the peak of Kremlin authority last year when he
leapfrogged over several other Soviet politi
cians to fourth ranking at the party congress, af
ter Brezhnev, ideologist Mikhail Suslov and An
drei Kirilenko, a Politburo veteran of more than
20 years. The four were the only ones to be
elected both Politburo members and party sec
retaries.
More dead found at Tahoe
Alpine Meadows, Calif. — A team of 75
rescue workers, racing against heavy snow and

the gathering darkness, found three more bod
ies yesterday, raising the death toll to six in the
massive avalanche that hit here. At least two
others are missing.
The searchers dug out the three bodies near
the main lodge of this ski resort on the north
shore of Lake Tahoe. The victims were not im
mediately identified.
The rescue workers had made their way on
skis over the resort's parking lot, covered by 20
feet of snow, and to the lodge, where three vic
tims had been found dead Wednesday night,
several hours after the avalanche struck.
The searchers carried 10-foot-long aluminum
poles to thrust into the snow and electronic
beacons to signal their location if they should
become buried in another slide. With them
were four specially trained search dogs.
"We don't really know how many victims we
are looking for," said Placer County Sheriff's
Sgt. Steven Reader.
U.S. officials claim nuclear
deterrence is credible
Washington — President Ronald Reagan's as
sertion that the Soviets enjoy a "definite margin
of superiority" in atomic weapons and could
withstand a U.S. retaliatory strike does not
mean that Moscow has nothing to fear from the
U.S. nuclear arsenal, administration officials
said yesterday.
At his news conference Wednesday night,
the president said that if the Soviets should hit
the United States with a nuclear first strike
"their great edge is one in which they could ab
sorb our retaliatory blow and hit us again."
No president ever described U.S., vulner
ability quite so starkly in a statement to the na
tion. As a result, Reagan's remark sparked con
cern in some quarters about whether U.S. nu
clear forces had lost their capacity to deter an
attack by Moscow.
In reply to questions yesterday, State Depart
ment nuclear arms specialist Richard Burt noted
that the president did not say the Russians could
mount a nuclear first strike without fear of U.S.
retaliation.
"I think what the president was referring to
... is that we are concerned that the Soviet
Union with these large new intercontinental
ballistic missiles has the capability to destroy a
large fraction of our systems, and we do not
possess an equivalent capability," Burt said.
Department of State spokesman Dean Fischer
likewise said that Reagan was referring to the
ability of Soviet heavy missiles to destroy many
U.S. land-based missiles, the most accurate
weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal.
Budget opposition emerges
Washington — Despite claims of progress in
White House-congressional budget nego
tiations, major roadblocks emerged yesterday
in the two Senate committees that are taking
the lead in trying to assemble an alternative to
President Ronald Reagan's unpopular budget

for next year.
Bipartisan opposition surfaced in the Senate
Finance Committee to creation of a new corpo
rate minimum tax — a key element of both ad
ministration and congressional revenue-raising
drives. And Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) perhaps
the most skillful tax legislator, declared his
strong support for corporate tax sale provisions,
giving proponents of the controversial section
of the 1981 tax bill a key ally.
In the Senate Budget Committee, several Re
publicans declared that Congress should not
wait for tax and spending concessions from
Reagan, but Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.)
warned even more bluntly than before that
Reagan has to move first if Democrats are going
to support a compromise. "He's going to have
to lead ... to admit he has a problem," said
Hollings.
Dems attack budget cuts
Washington — Citing statistics from federal
agencies, congressional Democrats yesterday
challenged President Ronald Reagan's re
assurances that budget cuts are not hurting
child immunization and other programs for the
nation's poor.
"Unfortunately, the president's defense of
his program was not only misleading, but in sev
eral cases, completely inaccurate," House
Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) charged in a
House speech.
Statistics from the federal Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta show that the Reagan admin
istration's budget "cuts off polio and measles
vaccinations for over 2 million children this year
and even more next year," said Rep. Henry
Waxman (D-Calif.), chairman of the House
Commerce Subcommittee on Health.
Waxman and Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D-Mo.)
challenged Reagan's assertion that the federal
supplemental feeding program for women, in
fants and children has not been cut back under
1983 budget proposals.
At his press conference Wednesday, the pres
ident said a newspaper editorial was mistaken in
saying the program had been cut. "I'm sure at
first glance they must have thought something
had happened. It's been merged with another
program and is in there at much greater money
than it has ever had before," Reagan said.
Stock market rallies
New York — Energy issues led a broad rally in
the stock market yesterday that carried the Dow
Jones industrial average to a seven-week high.
Trading picked up from its recent sluggish
pace as the advance gathered momentum.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials
climbed 10.47 to 833.24, its highest close since it
finished at 833.81 on Feb. 14. '

U.S. approaches talks with El Salvador right
Washington — A senior State Department official saic yesterday that
Roberto D'Aubuisson, the right-wing El Salvador political leader who
has been banned from the United States since May, 1980, will be per
mitted "in the future" to come to this country and meet with U.S. poli
cymakers.
Thomas Enders, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, re
vealed this shift of attitude toward D'Aubuisson as speculation con
tinued about whether the Reagan administration will be willing to sup
port a new Salvadoran government in which the cashiered former army
officer has a major role or influence.
In Sunday's Salvadoran elections for a constituent assembly,
D'Aubuisson's National Republican Alliance, known as ARENA, won 19
of the 60 seats. That makes him the potential kingmaker in the efforts of
five rightist parties to form a provisional government that would ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party, unofficially favored by
the United States.
At a nationally televised news conference Wednesday, President
Ronald Reagan refused to answer questions about whether he would
continue military and economic support to a D'Aubuisson-influenced
government. However, U.S. officials have been giving unmistakable sig
nals to Congress and the public that it might be necessary to deal with a
rightist Salvadoran government if it promises to pursue policies of re
form and further democratization.
In an interview yesterday with the National Public Radio program
"Communique," to be broadcast this weekend, Enders said he didn't
"envisage any immediate meetings up here with any of the current
leaders" in El Salvador's political manuevering. But he added that "it
would be quite normal in the future that we would meet here and
elsewhere."
Asked specifically about D'Aubuisson, Enders replied: "In the future,
absolutely, we would expect to see him and the others up here. I don't
want to single him out. I don't think he would receive any different
treatment than the others."
Enders' remarks represented a considerable
shift away from the arms-length posture the
United States had taken toward D'Aubuisson,
who was described by former U.S. ambassador
Robert White as a "pathological killer" and who
has been linked repeatedly to incipient military
coups and paramilitary terrorist activities.
In May, 1980, the Carter administration re
voked his visa to the United States, and when he
turned up here a month later, he was expelled.
In March, 1981, Secretary of State Alexander
Haig and other senior Reagan administration
officials vehemently denied D'Aubuisson's
public contention that U.S. officials had led him
to believe they would not oppose a coup in El
Salvador.
The administration, at that time, called
D'Aubuisson's statements "pure fiction,"
stressed that he was not in contact with U.S. of
ficials and made clear that the ban on him
would continue.
Brezhnev taken to hospital
