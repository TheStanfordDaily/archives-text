U.S. approaches talks with El Salvador right
Washington — A senior State Department official saic yesterday that
Roberto D'Aubuisson, the right-wing El Salvador political leader who
has been banned from the United States since May, 1980, will be per
mitted "in the future" to come to this country and meet with U.S. poli
cymakers.
Thomas Enders, assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, re
vealed this shift of attitude toward D'Aubuisson as speculation con
tinued about whether the Reagan administration will be willing to sup
port a new Salvadoran government in which the cashiered former army
officer has a major role or influence.
In Sunday's Salvadoran elections for a constituent assembly,
D'Aubuisson's National Republican Alliance, known as ARENA, won 19
of the 60 seats. That makes him the potential kingmaker in the efforts of
five rightist parties to form a provisional government that would ex
clude the centrist Christian Democratic Party, unofficially favored by
the United States.
At a nationally televised news conference Wednesday, President
Ronald Reagan refused to answer questions about whether he would
continue military and economic support to a D'Aubuisson-influenced
government. However, U.S. officials have been giving unmistakable sig
nals to Congress and the public that it might be necessary to deal with a
rightist Salvadoran government if it promises to pursue policies of re
form and further democratization.
In an interview yesterday with the National Public Radio program
"Communique," to be broadcast this weekend, Enders said he didn't
"envisage any immediate meetings up here with any of the current
leaders" in El Salvador's political manuevering. But he added that "it
would be quite normal in the future that we would meet here and
elsewhere."
Asked specifically about D'Aubuisson, Enders replied: "In the future,
absolutely, we would expect to see him and the others up here. I don't
want to single him out. I don't think he would receive any different
treatment than the others."
