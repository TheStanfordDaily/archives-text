# Farce not forced: playwright plays it right at ACT
## 
### Laurence Maslon 
"l wonder how this is all
going to turn out?" sighs a
character in ACT's production
of Cat Among the Pigeons, as
he sinks lower and lower in a
Louis Quatorze chair. Around
him fly a homicidal Mexican
general, a nymphomaniacal
cabaret singer, her nervously
distraught lover, a rotund
songwriter and a very tall man
with very bad breath. A
Feydeau farce is off at full
steam, and, as that character
might have said, "On ne sait ja
mais, do one?"
Georges Feydeau was one of
the most successful playwrights
of the late nineteenth century.
He managed to write comedy
after comedy which delighted
audiences for their own in
imitable qualities, qualities
which forever linked his name

with the term "farce." The
plots of his comedies were
worked out with a
mathematical precision. One
plot line quickly snowballed
into another and another and
another, and somehow, inex
plicably, everything managed
to come together at the end.
No detail is overlooked or un
derused.
Feydeau's main interest, of
course, was the insane, frantic,
illogical and often painfully re
alistic relationship between
man and woman, and Cat
Among the Pigeons is no ex
ception. Bois d'Enghien is the
happy lover of the passionate
cabaret actress Lucette. If there
is the smallest problem to
darken their idyllic existence, it
is that Bois d'Enghien is to be
married that afternoon — to
someone else. In order to soft

en the blow (mainly the blow
to himself as Lucette would
gladly bash his head in if she
knew), Bois d'Enghien intejKfc
to hitch her instead to General
Irriqua, a mad Mexi«w%.'

to invest these characters with

These reservations asid£
(and I think for a professional
company they are important
reservations), it should be
mentioned that few American;
theatres are capable of pulling
together the wit, the grace, the
charm, and above all, the style
that ACT has utilized for their'
production of one of dramatic
literature's most difficult play*
wrights. If you want to see this
master of the comedy per
formed at a pitch rarely cap
tured by non-European actors,
go to the Geary Theatre and
catch Cat Among the Pigeons.
"l wonder how this is all
going to turn out?" sighs a
character in ACT's production
of Cat Among the Pigeons, as
he sinks lower and lower in a
Louis Quatorze chair. Around
him fly a homicidal Mexican
general, a nymphomaniacal
cabaret singer, her nervously
distraught lover, a rotund
songwriter and a very tall man
with very bad breath. A
Feydeau farce is off at full
steam, and, as that character
might have said, "On ne sait ja
mais, do one?"
Georges Feydeau was one of
the most successful playwrights
of the late nineteenth century.
He managed to write comedy
after comedy which delighted
audiences for their own in
imitable qualities, qualities
which forever linked his name

with the term "farce." The
plots of his comedies were
worked out with a
mathematical precision. One
plot line quickly snowballed
into another and another and
another, and somehow, inex
plicably, everything managed
to come together at the end.
No detail is overlooked or un
derused.
Feydeau's main interest, of
course, was the insane, frantic,
illogical and often painfully re
alistic relationship between
man and woman, and Cat
Among the Pigeons is no ex
ception. Bois d'Enghien is the
happy lover of the passionate
cabaret actress Lucette. If there
is the smallest problem to
darken their idyllic existence, it
is that Bois d'Enghien is to be
married that afternoon — to
someone else. In order to soft

en the blow (mainly the blow
to himself as Lucette would
gladly bash his head in if she
knew), Bois d'Enghien intejKfc
to hitch her instead to General
Irriqua, a mad Mexi«w%.'
