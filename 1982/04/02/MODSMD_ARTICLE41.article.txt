Taxi Driver
Saturday, Cubberley Auditorium
( Martin Scorsese directed Rob
ert DeNiro in this disturbing,
' Woody, nightmarishly beautiful
Evocation Of American afien
♦•ation. DeNiro playsthe titular taxlP"
~driver who responds to the vio»
lence he sees all around him by.<&
frying to become even more vi
olent than everyone else. The
' only morally pure character in
-the film Is the twelve-year-old
prostitute playftd by Jody Foster;
~the girl remains untouched by
the horror of her life because she
.believes that she is climbing up
"the ladder toward the American
dream. Success in our society,
Scorsese suggests, comes only
from abandoning everything that
makes one human. 1 Is?
The movie's great bluesy score
is one of the last written by the
man who was probably the
greatest film composer, Bernard
Herrmann. Scorsese makes a"
creepy cameo as a passenger who
plans to kill his wife and her lover

Quest for Fire
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
A lovely surprise. Jean-Jacques
Annaud's movie is an un-cynlcal
account of the struggle of early
homo sapiens to find fire; it is
huge and impressive but Annaud
has concentrated on a very strong
narrative line. Annaud not only
captures his hero Naoh's sense of
wonder at the discovery of new
marvels; in the best tradition of
literature and film, he shares it.
Annaud has used his actors won
derfully (Everett McGill and Rae
Dawn Chong are especially
good}, though perhaps the movie
needs a little more humor.

Shoot the Moon ****
Guild, Menlo Park
Perhaps the most intense ex
pression of domestic pain ever
conceived for American movies.
Diane Keaton and Albert Finney,
as a couple whose marriage is
breaking up, and Dana Hill, as
their sensitive eldest daughter,
give superlative performances;
this is the kind of acting that is
authentic in every detail because
it seems to have been dug from
bowels. 80 Goldman's
screenplay can lay claim to being
among the best film writing ever
done by an American. The direc
tion by Alan Parker is surprisingly
genuine and deeply
moving; it suggests a more
agonized domestic Renoir.

Missing m |af§ !
Palo Alto Square V
Costa-Gavras' political
melodrama take place in Chile
during the 1973 coup, but It
seems to be set in hell. The film,
made with an open leftist bias, isa
stunning demonstration of what
It Is like to be in a country in a
state of seige, and as the wife of
the missing American, Sissy
Sp&cek does her best work in
years. However, there is a second
plot —> the politicization of her
father-in-law, dreadfully played
by Jack Lemmon — that nearly
wrecks the movie.

Clash of the Titans ***
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
The acting is wooden and the
mythology suspect, but the spe
cial effects, and the set pieces in
volving them, are often magical.
They were created t Ray Har
ryhausen, the man who did the
effects for Jason and the
Argonauts. Harryhausen is the
cinema's greatest practitioner of
stop-motion animation, the same
technique that made the eight
een-inch high King Kong threat
en New York. Harryhausen's
puppet characters in Clash of the
Titans include a flying horse and,
most spectacularly, a Medusa
that would do any monster
maker proud. This movie should
be great for kids: it's heroic and
not too violent.

On Golden Pond *
Park, Menlo Park
The two central characters are
a retired professor approaching
his eightieth birthday (Henry
Fonda, who manages to retain his
dignity) and his wife, who is ten
years his junior. He is ornery and
foxy; she is affectionate and sage.
This is the kind of movie In which
loons and sunsets and trout and
Jane Fonda's backflip are used as
emblems of survival and longev
ity and marital bliss and familial „>
reconciliation. To be avoided at
all costs.

Si Reds /,
Mountain View Theater
An intelligent, unconven
tional, craftsmanlike movie, re
mar' ibly coherent and sus
tained. The first part, most of
which Is given over to the
burgeoning relationship be
tween reporter-revolutionary
Jack Reed (Warren Beatty) and
would-be writer Louise Bryant
(Diane Keaton), could stand
restructuring, but in part two, af
ter the experience of the Russian
Revolution, the two characters
are Jerked into adulthood, and
they turn out to be fascinating
people whose interaction truly
holds the screen. Beatty and
Keaton's acting may never have
been better than It is in the last 90
minutes, and they are superbly
supported by Jack Nicholson as
Eugene O'Neill and Maureen
Stapleton as Emma Goldman.

Pennies from Heaven *★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A great movie musical — per
haps the most complex and
astonishing ever made. The set
ting is Depression-era Chicago;
the theme is the need for illusion.
The characters (impeccably acted
by Steve Martin, Jessica Harper,
Vernal Bagneris, John McMartin,
Christopher Walken and espe
cially Bernadette Peters) are so
stunted by poverty and sexual
frustration that they respond to
their misery by turning it into mu
sical comedy. In the numbers,
they mouth popular songs of the
period while the director,
Herbert Ross, and choreo
grapher, Danny Daniels, spin off
in all directions from Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers
and other mainstays of the film
musicals of the '30s, This is a mov
ie of incredible emotional in
tensity, written by Dennis Potter
and shot and designed in the style
of Edward Hopper.
Starts next Thursday with with
loot Suit.

The Sound of Music *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Julie Andrews plays nursemaid
to seven singing lentils and their
crusty old father. She loses her
nuhliness in the process, but ev
erything's okay in the end be
cause she gets to be a singing
mommy instead.
Plays Saturday and Sunday
with Fiddler on the Roof.

Play it Again, Sam ***
Friday, Kresge Auditorium
Herbert Ross directed Woody
Allen and Diane Keaton in this
movie version of the Woody Al
len play. It all seems a littie in
cestuous, and the movie is ap
parently suffering from inbreed
ing — it's slow and sickly just
when you would've thought it'd
be strongest. But Allen and
Keaton are wonderful together.
The scenes with just the two of
them, where you can tell they're
actually having a good time, re
deem the movie.

Personal Best **★*
Bijou, Palo Alto
The producer-director
screenwriter, Robert Towne, has
conceived this story about the
coming of age of a rising pen
tathlete entirely in terms of body
language. His approach to the
material is daringly unconven-.
tional yet so logical that it seems |
the only possible way to achive
his results; we are continually
astonished at how eloquent the
bodies are. It's a film about the
expenditure of physical and emo
tional energy, and about the
search for a delicate balance be
tween friendship and com
petitive drive. Mariel Hemingway
and Scott Glenn, who are pro
fessional actors, and Patrice Don
nelly, Kenny Moore and Jodi An
derson, who are professional ath
letes, give absolutely consistent
' naturalistic performances.

Bringing Up Baby****
Monday, Kresge Auditorium
One of the great American di
rectors — Howard Hawks —
directed two of the great Ameri
can actors — Cary Grant and
(Catherine Hepburn — in one of
the great American comedies.
Grant plays a befuddled paleon
tologist, and the actor's comic gift
is so humane and well-tuned that
he gives even befuddlement a
kind of moral dignity. Hepburn is
very funny and incredibly pretty
as the screwball heiress who
works to put the random element
back into Grant's life. And the
movie's peculiar triangle Is com
pleted by Baby, played entirely
naturalistically by a leopard.

Prince of the City *
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
in short, deliberate takes, the
cast performs as though they'd
spent days in an overheated
steam room we don't g2t any
rest from their bug-eyed, over
heated actorishness. Every scene
begins at its climax, so that we
.never understand what drove
these people to such extreme
states of hysteria, aidney Lumet,
who directed and co-wrote the
script (with Jay Pressor* Allen),
seems to think he has something
so important to say in this movie
about police corruption that they
don't have to bother structuring
it or modulating the tone or es
tablishing motivation for the
characters — but it's almost im
possible to figure out what he is
saying. Treat Williams stars, but
the only good performance is
given by Jerry Orbach.

The Rose *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
What we have here is really just
another version of A Star is Born,
except this one is clothed in a
1969 setting and centered on a
character vaguely based on Janis
Joplin. But the movie makes only
three references to '69, and
without those you'd probably
just assume the movie was set in
the present. The music is more
aptly described as frenetic show
tunes with bass and drums than as
anything resembling Janis
joplin's primal, gut-busting wail
ing. The performances at times
manage to obscure some of the
movie's lack of authenticity, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the
probtem by being less-than-con
vincing in the concert sequences
(can we really believe that she's
playing a rock performer?).
When teamed with either Fredric
Forrest or Alan Bates, Midler
comes off much better, but it's
too little too late.
Plays tonight only with The
Rocky Horror Picture Show.
