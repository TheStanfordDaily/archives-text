The State Department announced
Wednesday that it has cancelled the
visit of Soviet scholar Nikolay Umnov
to the U.S. thi:: spring "in view of the
sensitivity of th e field of robotics and
of possible tech nology transfer prob
lems."
The decision apparently marks the
end of a round of disagreements be
tween the National Academy of Sci
ence (NAS) and the State Depart
ment on one side, and several major
U.S. universities (including Stanford)
over attempts to place federal export
restrictions that would have limited
the scholar's access to certain kinds
of unclassified research.
State Department spokesman Joe
Reap said tnat the decision was made
after the Department took "a second
look" at the government-sponsored
NAS exchange program.
"We reversed our initial decision
and disapproved the visit," he said.
"Over the years," he continued,
"Soviet candidates have frequently
been turned down and the Soviets
have rejected U.S. candidates."
Reap said that he was "not aware of
any particular change" recently in
robotics technology or U.S. — Soviet
relations that had direct impact on
the decision. When asked for further
details on the specific reasons for the
cancellation, Reap declined to com
ment.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth, who was to have been
Umnov's host here, said that the State
Department's argument that Umnov
poses a threat to national security is
unfounded.
"It's obviously a political decision
which has nothing to do with secur

ity," said Roth. "There's nothing spe
cial that we're doing here that he
would become aware of that would
affect national security."
Roth emphasized that the can
cellation is a strategic move by the
State Department against the aca
demic community rather than a fear
for national security, by revealing the
presence of a visiting Soviet scholar
here this year.
Declining to identify the visitor,
Roth said tnat the man currently has
full access to the same information
that Umnov would have been ex
posed to and that the State Depart
ment is completely aware of his pres
ence here.
After an initial dispute, in which
the University refused to bow to the
set of strict State Department restric
tions placed on the visit by Umnov,
the NAS cancelled the Soviet schol
ar's visit here last January. In Febru
ary, the NAS sent a letter to university
officials outlining a revised set of re
strictions governing Umnov's visit
which removed the limits on the
scholar's access to unclassified re
search and University responsibility
for monitoring his activities.
The University agreed to the visit
under the revised conditions and,
until Wednesday, officials were still
planning for and expecting it.
Throughout the discussion the
University has maintained that it is
the responsibility of the state Depart
ment to allow or deny entrance into
the U.S. through the use of visas.
Once a scholar has been admitted,
however, University officials have
argued that heorshe should be given
access to all unclassified academic
materials and research.
