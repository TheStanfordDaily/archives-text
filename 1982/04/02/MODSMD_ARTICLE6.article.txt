# Grad students petition for housing solution
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
The University can presently offer
few and insufficient solutions to
graduate housing problems on-cam
pus, despite circulation of a petition
signed by 641 graduate students urg
ing the University to alleviate the on
campus housing crunch for graduate
students and their rapidly rising
rents, said the Graduate Student As
sociation Housing Committee Chair
person yesterday.
Housing Committee Chair Bill
Smith told the Daily this week that
University proposals to the housing
problem are insufficient to meet the
needs of the University's 6000 gradu
ate students and their families.
Smith told the Daily that the Uni
versity currently plans to increase
graduate student stipends with some
additional funds coming from the
University's general fund. But Smith
said the University has no plans to
build new graduate student housing
complexes on-campus during the
1980s and any "additional housing
will have to come of its own."
The University will give no con
firmation yet as to any specifics of the
plan for increased graduate student
stipends. Plans for an official re

•sponse to the graduate student's
housing petition will be released
next week, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the President
for trustee affairs.
Smith said he and other members
of the GSA circulated their petition in
late January because they were angry
at the insufficient number of on
campus housing spaces for graduate
students and lack of affordable rents
which are slated to rise 14 per cent per
year for four years.
In efforts to try to proportion more
fairly the numbers of graduate stu
dents who can live on-campus, the
University has also recently an
nounced that limits will be imposed
on length of time a graduate student
can stay in on-campus housing.
Single students and married
couples without children will be al
lowed to stay on-campus for one
year. For married couples with chil
dren, that limit will be four years.
There were no previous limits on
length of time a student could stay
on-campus and some students work
ing on longterm projects have been
able to live on-campus for several
years.
The petition was sent to University
University President Donald Kennedy, the
Board of Trustees and all University department
heads.
On March 4 members of the GSA brought
their problems and proposals before the Board
of Trustees and on Mar. 10 GSA members and
University officials met informally at Kennedy's
house.
The meeting was an outgrowth of a petition
signed by 641 graduate students asking the Uni
versity for immediate solutions to the financial
burden for housing for graduate housing prob
lem and outlining three possible alternatives.
The petition states, "The four consecutive
years of 14 per cent or greater rent increases now
being implemented by the Office of Housing
Management will make it increasingly difficult
for all students - particularly married students
with families, single parents and foreign stu
dents - to finance their education."
It further states that financing of new graduate
student housing is "doubtful" if financed prima
rily by student rents and summer conference
fees, the current University policy.
"The University is raising rents to be on par
with local (off-campus) rents. They can't do that
for undergraduates because they must remain
competitive with other institutions such as
Princeton and Harvard," said Smith. "It's not fair
to subsidize on-campus housing (through grad
uate student rent increases) just because you're

lucky enough to get a spot on-campus."
The petition mentions three alternatives to fi
nance new graduate housing: to allow future
building construction to house both graduate
students and University faculty and staff mem
bers, to solicit gift funds from private donors as
was done in previous building efforts,, to divert
money from other University funds to subsidize
housing similar to University subsidies for hous
ing for faculty and staff.
Smith said he has been told by the University
that gifts for constructing additional student
housing are not being offered at this time.
But Smith said his group has come with an al
ternative plan for donor financing that would be
more profitable to the donors. The plan would
solicit loans for erecting the buildings and no in
terest would be paid on the loans for the first
four to five years, but after that time interest and
the capital would be paid back. Smith admits the
plan may not yet be practible because of taxa
tion questions. The land is already owned by the
University and has tax-exempt standing. The le
galities of maintenance of tax-exempt status un
der such a profit system is still questionable, said
Smith.
Smith said the University has no current plans
to add to the supply onf on-campus graduate
student housing, but that spaces will be made
available to graduate students when the under
graduate population is moved in to the new
dormitory complex west of Lagunita Court.
"But," said Smith, "the trailers won't last past
1990. So the added spaces are a questionable gain
for the graduate students."

with local (off-campus) rents. They can't do that
for undergraduates because they must remain
competitive with other institutions such as
Princeton and Harvard," said Smith. "It's not fair
to subsidize on-campus housing (through grad
uate student rent increases) just because you're

lucky enough to get a spot on-campus."
The petition mentions three alternatives to fi
nance new graduate housing: to allow future
building construction to house both graduate
students and University faculty and staff mem
bers, to solicit gift funds from private donors as
was done in previous building efforts,, to divert
money from other University funds to subsidize
housing similar to University subsidies for hous
ing for faculty and staff.
Smith said he has been told by the University
that gifts for constructing additional student
housing are not being offered at this time.
But Smith said his group has come with an al
ternative plan for donor financing that would be
more profitable to the donors. The plan would
solicit loans for erecting the buildings and no in
terest would be paid on the loans for the first
four to five years, but after that time interest and
the capital would be paid back. Smith admits the
plan may not yet be practible because of taxa
tion questions. The land is already owned by the
University and has tax-exempt standing. The le
galities of maintenance of tax-exempt status un
der such a profit system is still questionable, said
Smith.
Smith said the University has no current plans
to add to the supply onf on-campus graduate
student housing, but that spaces will be made
available to graduate students when the under
graduate population is moved in to the new
dormitory complex west of Lagunita Court.
"But," said Smith, "the trailers won't last past
1990. So the added spaces are a questionable gain
for the graduate students."
The University can presently offer
few and insufficient solutions to
graduate housing problems on-cam
pus, despite circulation of a petition
signed by 641 graduate students urg
ing the University to alleviate the on
campus housing crunch for graduate
students and their rapidly rising
rents, said the Graduate Student As
sociation Housing Committee Chair
person yesterday.
Housing Committee Chair Bill
Smith told the Daily this week that
University proposals to the housing
problem are insufficient to meet the
needs of the University's 6000 gradu
ate students and their families.
Smith told the Daily that the Uni
versity currently plans to increase
graduate student stipends with some
additional funds coming from the
University's general fund. But Smith
said the University has no plans to
build new graduate student housing
complexes on-campus during the
1980s and any "additional housing
will have to come of its own."
The University will give no con
firmation yet as to any specifics of the
plan for increased graduate student
stipends. Plans for an official re

•sponse to the graduate student's
housing petition will be released
next week, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the President
for trustee affairs.
Smith said he and other members
of the GSA circulated their petition in
late January because they were angry
at the insufficient number of on
campus housing spaces for graduate
students and lack of affordable rents
which are slated to rise 14 per cent per
year for four years.
In efforts to try to proportion more
fairly the numbers of graduate stu
dents who can live on-campus, the
University has also recently an
nounced that limits will be imposed
on length of time a graduate student
can stay in on-campus housing.
Single students and married
couples without children will be al
lowed to stay on-campus for one
year. For married couples with chil
dren, that limit will be four years.
There were no previous limits on
length of time a student could stay
on-campus and some students work
ing on longterm projects have been
able to live on-campus for several
years.
The petition was sent to University
University President Donald Kennedy, the
Board of Trustees and all University department
heads.
On March 4 members of the GSA brought
their problems and proposals before the Board
of Trustees and on Mar. 10 GSA members and
University officials met informally at Kennedy's
house.
The meeting was an outgrowth of a petition
signed by 641 graduate students asking the Uni
versity for immediate solutions to the financial
burden for housing for graduate housing prob
lem and outlining three possible alternatives.
The petition states, "The four consecutive
years of 14 per cent or greater rent increases now
being implemented by the Office of Housing
Management will make it increasingly difficult
for all students - particularly married students
with families, single parents and foreign stu
dents - to finance their education."
It further states that financing of new graduate
student housing is "doubtful" if financed prima
rily by student rents and summer conference
fees, the current University policy.
"The University is raising rents to be on par
with local (off-campus) rents. They can't do that
for undergraduates because they must remain
competitive with other institutions such as
Princeton and Harvard," said Smith. "It's not fair
