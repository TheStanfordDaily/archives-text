# Grad students petition for housing solution
## 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
The University can presently offer
few and insufficient solutions to
graduate housing problems on-cam
pus, despite circulation of a petition
signed by 641 graduate students urg
ing the University to alleviate the on
campus housing crunch for graduate
students and their rapidly rising
rents, said the Graduate Student As
sociation Housing Committee Chair
person yesterday.
Housing Committee Chair Bill
Smith told the Daily this week that
University proposals to the housing
problem are insufficient to meet the
needs of the University's 6000 gradu
ate students and their families.
Smith told the Daily that the Uni
versity currently plans to increase
graduate student stipends with some
additional funds coming from the
University's general fund. But Smith
said the University has no plans to
build new graduate student housing
complexes on-campus during the
1980s and any "additional housing
will have to come of its own."
The University will give no con
firmation yet as to any specifics of the
plan for increased graduate student
stipends. Plans for an official re

â€¢sponse to the graduate student's
housing petition will be released
next week, according to Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the President
for trustee affairs.
Smith said he and other members
of the GSA circulated their petition in
late January because they were angry
at the insufficient number of on
campus housing spaces for graduate
students and lack of affordable rents
which are slated to rise 14 per cent per
year for four years.
In efforts to try to proportion more
fairly the numbers of graduate stu
dents who can live on-campus, the
University has also recently an
nounced that limits will be imposed
on length of time a graduate student
can stay in on-campus housing.
Single students and married
couples without children will be al
lowed to stay on-campus for one
year. For married couples with chil
dren, that limit will be four years.
There were no previous limits on
length of time a student could stay
on-campus and some students work
ing on longterm projects have been
able to live on-campus for several
years.
The petition was sent to University
