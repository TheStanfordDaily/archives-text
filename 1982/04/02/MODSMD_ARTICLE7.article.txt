# Fac Senate looks at Western Culture program
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Despite a recent survey which
showed that an overwhelming ma
jority of last year's freshmen ap
proved of the University's Western
culture requirement, there are many
problems with the program which
need to be corrected, the faculty sen
ate concurred last night.
An open discussion and question
and-answer session with Chairman of
the Western Culture Department
Charles Lyons elicited concerns and
criticisms of the requirement which
focused primarily on its ability to de
velop writing skills and expose stu
dents to the great works of Western

culture.
The survey, which wa? released at
the meeting, showed that 38 percent
of the students perceived the pro
gram as "very positive," 46 percent
"positive," 12 percent "satisfactory,"
three percent "unsatisfactory" and
one percent "very unsatisfactory."
Three-fourths said that they were
glad they were required to take the
course and 17 percent were not.
Criticism of the program, however,
came from several of the senators
who said they felt that teaching assis
tants and lecturers were overworked
and underpaid and that too few pres
ent faculty members participate in

the program.
"The lecturers in the Great Works
track are miserably over-worked for
the amount of money that they
make," said English Professor Ron
Rebholz.
Section leaders in the Great Works
track are in class 12 hours a week and
must also spend a large amount of
time correcting papers and exams,
according to Rebholz. He said that
they make $18,000 a year.
The situation is further com
plicated, according to other senators,
by the fact that the majority of the
section leaders are still pursuing

PhD's or are graduate students who
have a large work load outside of
their instructing duties.
Several senators said they were
alarmed by examples of poor writing
which they had seen written by stu
dents in the program.
"Papers which would be given F's
in Freshman English courses are giv
en B's or C's in the Western culture
program because they are graded
solely on content," one senator said.
Lyons also suggested more flex
ibility in accepting reading assign
ments which don't follow the re
quired core reading list.
