# Davis: fighting racism
## 
### Michael Weiss 
Angela Davis, a well-known black
activist and professor of women's
and ethnic studies at San Francisco
State University, told about 400 peo
ple in Kresge Auditorium last night
that "a theme of all our struggles
ought to be a struggle against ra
cism."
Her view differed sharply from
those of former Secretary 6f Educa
tion Shirley Hufstealer, Gray
Panthers member Frieda Wolff and
Harry Britt, a San Francisco County
Supervisor, who made up the panel
of a symposium entitled "Alter
natives to Reaganism: Building Effec
tive Campus Community Coali

tions."
The other panelists emphasized
the need to combat such Reagan pol
icies as nuclear armament, military
build-up and lack of commitment to
full employment, while Davis told
the predominantly student audience
that "iust because you know how to
read big words and write composi
tions doesn't mean you have all the
answers."
She pointed to members of the
working class as frequent examples
of "people with wisdom."
"I think a function of this institu
tion is to convince you that you are
better than those who use their
hands to work for a living," she

added.
In contrast to Davis, who focused
on the faults of society, Wolff con
centrated her talk on the faults of
"Reaganism" and the "brutal con
tempt for humanity" which the Rea
gan administration has demon
strated.
"Unless we join together in the
greatest coalition of all time, in order
to freeze the production and de
velopment of nuclear weaponry, we
won t have to develop alternatives to
'Reaganism.' We'll all be dead," she
said.
A member of the Gray Panthers,
which works to eliminate discrimina
tion against senior citizens, Wolff
stressed that young and old must
work together to fight Reagan's poli
cies.
She said that fighting draft regis
tration was one ofner organization's

most important projects.
Hufstedler. currently a professor at
the School of Law and a federal court
judge for 11 years, said, "we have to
do more than talk about programs,
we have to give of ourselves."
She urged students to benefit soci
ety by participating in activities like
tutoring youngsters or even taking
them for walks.
Hufstedler said that Reagan might
have won the Presidency only be
cause of a small voter turn-out and
noted that among the people who
"stayed impassively home" during
the November 1980 elections were
university students. She urged stu
dents to vote in the forthcoming
elections.
Britt explained that he spent yes
terday afternoon with members of
the Honduran Council, trying to lo
cate an American who he believes is
imprisoned in Honduras. "This is 'a
time when madmen run the coun
tries of the world," he said. "If we do
anything else but try to change that,
then we are immoral people."
