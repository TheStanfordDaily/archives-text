## 
### Karen Springen 
A panel featuring Linda Lovelace,
star of the landmark pornographic
film Deep Throat, debated the
pornography industry's effect on
women and the related issues of
censorship and sexual violence
before an overflow crowd in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday night.
The other panelists in the debate
entitled "Porno: the Image and the
Industry — Does it Violate Women?"
were Andrea Dworkin, author, ac
tivist, and radical feminist; Burton
Joseph, chairman of the board of the
Playboy Foundation; and Catharine
MacKinnon, ASSU guest professor at
the law school and co-founder of
Feminists Against Porn.
Lovelace, author of the auto
biography Ordeal, called herself "a
victim of pornography."
According to Lovelace, she was a
prisoner of her husband, Charles
Trainer, from 1970 until her escape in
1972. She claims Trainer beat her and
forced her at gunpoint both to prosti
tute herself and to act in porno
graphic films.
Lovelace said Trainer beat her dur

ing the filming of Deep Throat. "Ev
eryone always seems to remember
the smile on my face, but no one
seems to remember the bruises." She
added that no one involved in the
filming cared that she was not a will
ing participant. "I was a product and
an object," she said. "My body was
physically there, but my mind was
miles away."
Trainer, presently the manager of
pornographic film star Marilyn
Chambers, has received Deep
Throat's proceeds since it was filmed
11 years ago. Lovelace said she is in
capable of taking any legal action
against her ex-husband because of
the two-year statute of limitations for
rape.
She added, "Virtually every time
someone sees that movie, they're
watching me being raped."
According to MacKinnon, the final
speaker. Deep Thromt "legitimized
pornography in this country." She
termed Lovelace's apparent enjoy
ment in the film "a well-done
charade."
MacKinnon stressed that porno
graphy "enforces not speech but si

lence." Pornographic pictures dis
play the woman "as the object to be
acted on."
In the question period, MacKin
non said, "I want to see a society in
which men are no longer turned on
by putting women down."
She said that she is not promoting
censorship per se. "What I'm in
terested in is delegitimizing it
(pornography)."
She concluded, "Work with us to
make what we are saying not true
anymore."
Joseph, the first speaker, was the
only one with a good word to say for
the pornography industry. He
claimed that anti-social sex crimes
often result when exposure to ex
plicit sex is denied in adolescence.
"The rapist is a sick product of a sex
ually ignorant and repressed socie
ty," he said.
loteph also argued that
ment regulation of the pornographic
industry violates First Amendment
freedoms, saying "One person's
pornography is someone else's
poetry," and called efforts at

censorship counterproductive. "You
can suppress the work but you can't
suppress the demand," he said.
He compared censorship to capital
punishment: death sentence ad
vocates feel they are "doing some
thing about murder" just as
censorship lobbyists "feel like
they're doing something about sex
ual harrassment and assault," he said.
Joseph, who shared the stage with
the three self-proclaimed feminists,
was defensive throughout the dis
cussion. "I don't have to justify any
thing," he said at one point during
the question period.
Meanwhile Dworkfn, the second
speaker and author of Pornography:
Men Possessing Women, attacked
what she called pornography's ideals
of sexualized aggression and hostility

to women. "This is the very value sys
tem we must destroy if we are to be
free," she said. "The fantasy is that
women want to be abused."
Dworkin, a lesbian, at one point
defined the penis as "a weapon
against women" which represents
"not their (men's) pleasure but their
conquest." She called the penis "the
primary instrument of conquest and
aggression."
She was pessimistic about the
future of the feminist movement.
"Sometimes being / woman is like
living in a jar of molasses," she said.
"Porno is like the nail in our coffin."
She asked, "Why does one choose
dominance and submission when
one can choose equality?"
Freshman Sharon Dyer of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau produced the panel
discussion. According to Junior
Glynn O'Donnell, head of Speakers
Bureau, the event cost about $5000.

added that no one involved in the
filming cared that she was not a will

an object," she said. "My body was
physically there, but my mind was
miles away."
Trainer, presently the manager of
pornographic film star Marilyn

11 years ago. Lovelace said she is in

against her ex-husband because of

rape.

censorship counterproductive. "You
can suppress the work but you can't
suppress the demand," he said.
He compared censorship to capital
punishment: death sentence ad
vocates feel they are "doing some
thing about murder" just as
censorship lobbyists "feel like
they're doing something about sex
ual harrassment and assault," he said.
Joseph, who shared the stage with
the three self-proclaimed feminists,
was defensive throughout the dis
cussion. "I don't have to justify any
thing," he said at one point during
the question period.
Meanwhile Dworkfn, the second
speaker and author of Pornography:
Men Possessing Women, attacked
what she called pornography's ideals
of sexualized aggression and hostility

to women. "This is the very value sys
tem we must destroy if we are to be
free," she said. "The fantasy is that
women want to be abused."
Dworkin, a lesbian, at one point
defined the penis as "a weapon
against women" which represents
"not their (men's) pleasure but their
conquest." She called the penis "the
primary instrument of conquest and
aggression."
She was pessimistic about the
future of the feminist movement.
"Sometimes being / woman is like
living in a jar of molasses," she said.
"Porno is like the nail in our coffin."
She asked, "Why does one choose
dominance and submission when
one can choose equality?"
Freshman Sharon Dyer of the ASSU
Speakers Bureau produced the panel
discussion. According to Junior
Glynn O'Donnell, head of Speakers
Bureau, the event cost about $5000.
A panel featuring Linda Lovelace,
star of the landmark pornographic
film Deep Throat, debated the
pornography industry's effect on
women and the related issues of
censorship and sexual violence
before an overflow crowd in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium Friday night.
The other panelists in the debate
entitled "Porno: the Image and the
Industry — Does it Violate Women?"
were Andrea Dworkin, author, ac
tivist, and radical feminist; Burton
Joseph, chairman of the board of the
Playboy Foundation; and Catharine
MacKinnon, ASSU guest professor at
the law school and co-founder of
Feminists Against Porn.
Lovelace, author of the auto
biography Ordeal, called herself "a
victim of pornography."
According to Lovelace, she was a
prisoner of her husband, Charles
Trainer, from 1970 until her escape in
1972. She claims Trainer beat her and
forced her at gunpoint both to prosti
tute herself and to act in porno
graphic films.
Lovelace said Trainer beat her dur

ing the filming of Deep Throat. "Ev
eryone always seems to remember
the smile on my face, but no one
seems to remember the bruises." She
added that no one involved in the
filming cared that she was not a will
