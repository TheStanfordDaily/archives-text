# American colonel leads Laotian rebels
## 
### Newsday 
Chiang Khong, Thailand — From his
aerie 4000 feet above the Mekong River,
the commander spreads his map on the
mountainside and checks the hostile ter
rain beneath. Around him a dozen soldiers
clean their rifles and relax awaiting the
day's decisions. Two pack-horses graze
nearby, and in the thatched mess hut, wa
ter is boiling off the morning meal of
noodles.
The place is Laos, the soldiers refugee
hill tribesmen, the guns Chinese — and the
commander an American war hero known
across the northern Laotian hills as "Colo
nel Fred."
New Jersey-born Fred Zabitosky, who
won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam in
1968, is carrying on the anticommunist

struggle from his own forward base just
across the Laotian border from Thailand.
Zabitosky has a wife and grown son in
Pembroke, N.C., but he is "Colonel Fred"
to a polyglot crew of divided mountain
peoples who agree on only two things:
getting the Vietnamese out of their home
land (the communists took over Laos in
1975), and learning from Zabitosky how to
do it. Retired Special Forces Master Ser
geant Zabitosky, 39, may be the last Ameri
can in Indochina still fighting the Vietnam
War.
The Lao United Liberation Front is not a
secret army, but few from outside trouble
themselves to visit the jungle-clad, pre
cipitous mountains that LULF calls home.
From Zabitosky's rear base in Thailand, it is
an 11-mile trek on foot including a 4200-

foot ascent to the mountaintop advance
base.
LULF's ambition is to carve out a "Lao
tian Free State" in the northwest corner of
Laos where rugged terrain should deter
the Vietnamese from attempting reoc
cupation. LULF leaders say China, which
borders the proposed free state, has prom
ised to arm 6,000 hill fighters for the job,
and 500 at a time are in China being
equipped and trained.
The two purposes call for a force of well
coordinated, fully supplied and mountain
hardened guerrillas, and that's how LULF
and Colonel Fred came to adopt each oth
er last summer after Zabitosky's arrival on
assignment from a super-patriotic, ultra
right adventure magazine.
