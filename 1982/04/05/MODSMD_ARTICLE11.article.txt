## Land Use Policy: ironing out rough the spots University and public decide the future of Stanford lands 
### Michael Abramson 
The new housing complex is
scheduled to open in 1983, yet
the need for increased housing
still exists. To date, approx
imately 3000 housing units are
needed for graduate students
and staff, according to Robin
Hamil director of Housing De
velopment for the University.
Plans to further alleviate the
housing shortage will adhere
to elements of the Land Use
Policy which was adopted by
the Board of Trustees in De
cember 1980. The policy's
stated purpose is "To provide
adequate land, on a continual
ly renewing basis, for facilities
and space for the instructional
and research activities of the
University." Such a policy es
tablishes a framework for de
velopment of Stanford's 8180
acres of land.
Three cooperative forces —
Hamil; Phil Williams, land use
planner and University
architect; and Frank Morrow,
director of housing develop
ment — work in a linear proc
ess to help solve the problem.
Also, the Land Use Policy
states, "the concerns of neigh
boring jurisdictions are impor
tant and shall be considered in
a cooperative spirit in the plan
ning process."
Some of the 3000 units will be
filled by the development of
the 46 acres of Stanford West
on Willow Road between the
Oak Creek Apartments and the
Children's Hospital. Stanford
has already submitted its pro

posal for development of 1275
units at this site; an environ
mental impact report prepared
by a consultant to the city of
Palo Alto addressing Stanford
West — proposals, impacts and
alternatives — was submitted
i to the city of Palo Alto in March
and will be submitted to the
public in mid-April. Once the
report's recommendations are
in, the city council will either
approve one of the report's
suggestions or provide another
viable alternative. Such issues
as traffic control, vegetation
impacts and design configura
tions are being considered.

'Nothing is going
to be
simple... .This is
a very complex
and cumbersome
task....'

Stanford's proposed de
velopment of these 46 acres as
well as future lands will be
linked to the Land Use Policy,
which considers "natural char
acteristics of the land such as
hilltops, ridges and foreground
views." The concerns of neigh
bors whose lands bound Stan
ford's lands — Santa Clara and
San Mateo Counties, Palo Alto
and Menlo Park, and Woods
ide and Portola — will also be
weighed.
The maps in the Land Use
Policy indicate what sites are

available for housing. Possible
sites, which Hamil also recom
mended in her report, include
a site on the western end of
Lake Lagunita, next to the new
800-unit complex, the corner
of Bowdoin Street and Campus
Drive, and various sites for in
filling within the campus
bounds like Manzanita Park.
Other areas included in the
maps are Stanford North and
South, Coyote Hill, Powers Lab
and land near the Arboretum.
According to Williams, de
velopment of Stanford North
and South is"not politically ac
ceptable" because it is "en
vironmentally sensitive." The
Palo Alto-based Committee
for Green Foothills (CGF),
would like to see this land, as
well as land near Powers Lab,
"dedicated as open space," ac
cording to Betsy Crowder, CGF
vice-president.
The committee's concerns
revolve around environmental
impacts, transportation prob
lems and availability of ser
vices.
"You can't walk down to the
corner grocery store. It would
only be for the very rich," said
Crowder referring to the pos
sible development of Powers
Lab. "Is that what Stanford
needs?"
The Mayfield School, which
is presently unoccupied, was
declared suitable for housing
units by the city, University and
CGF. The school was leveled in
mid-March.
"We all agree on infilling,"

Williams stated, "because it is
practical and environmental."
Areas up in the faculty housing
area, Escondido Village and
Manzanita Park are most
viable."
Land suitability analysis in
the Land Use Plan "identifies
and evaluates certain features
of Stanford's undeveloped
lands which are useful in un
derstanding the essential char
acteristics of the landscape."
Ten environmental features
have been ranked according to
"current University environ
ment values, influenced in turn
by community and regional in
terests."
Hydrography, the study of
water, has the highest relative
weight of 17.2 of 100. Second is
the Earthquake Intensity/Slope
Stability at 16.5. Other factors
are visual quality, tree cover
and habitat. With the data from
this table, there is an environ
mental sensitivity composite.
What does Stanford need?
Hamil attempted to answer this
quantity demand question. She
is involved in allocation once
the units are built. However,
her main objective is to outline
University housing objectives.
In addition to the housing
needs recommended in her re
port, Hamil also suggested a

below-market-price program
for the University's own sub
sidizing of some of the units at
Stanford West.
For additional financial re
sources, Hamil proposed the
formation of alumni partner
ships as investors in "new ren
tal housing complexes." The
tax benefits may be con
tributed to the University.
As part of the linear process
the three directors perform,
Williams determines what sites
are available for housing. As
University planner, he applies
his architectural skills to the
two basic planning areas de
fined by the Land Use Policy:
academic and University sup
port.
There are two basic academ
ic areas: campus and academic
reserve. The faculty and stu
dents come under academic
and sites for such usage, ac
cording to Williams, "should
be close."
University support areas in
clude sites that are used for in
terim development provided
they are not used for agricul
tural use. The Industrial Park
and Shopping Center are in
terim sites.
Williams is also working with
the Medical Center in updat
ing their master planning and
with SLAC in seeking sites for

new machinery. In addition to
the habitual planning of roads,
lighting and landscaping, Wil
liams also interacts with cities
and countiesatthepublichear
ing level. This year most of his
time is devoted to the housing

'I must explain to

more housing/

projects

"Nothing is going to be
simple," he said. "This is a very
complex and cumbersome task
requiring the mutual efforts of
Robin, Frank and myself."
Morrow designs and de
velops housing projects. He is
responsible for contracting
architects and builders to carry
out his programs. His office ov
ersees faculty and staff housing
needs of the University and
creates a development pro

gram once needs have been
identified.
"We are a reactive force and
creative force," said his As
sociate Director Pam Erskin.
"We respond to the University,
city and county, wherever ju
risdiction lies."
As the developer for the Uni
versity, the Housing Develop
ment Office must also be aware
of financial constraints.
"In trying to satisfy needs
that have been identified,"
commented Erskin, "we are
also looking for alternative
sources of financial as
sistance."
Director of Community Re
lations Awndy Doty must as
suage the concerns of the sides
involved in the housing issues.
"I must explain to our neigh
bors why we need to do what
we're doing. Housing is the is
sue of the '80s locally. All poli
cies are flowing toward more
housing," he noted.
In serving the "interface be
tween the University, cities and
counties," Doty must deal with
groups like the Palo Alto Civic
League wherein a group of
people are wary of future de
velopment.
"Let's have some more,"
Doty said of their position,
"but not too much and let's be
careful."

In serving the "interface be

"Let's have some more,"
Doty said of their position,
"but not too much and let's be

The new housing complex is
scheduled to open in 1983, yet
the need for increased housing
still exists. To date, approx
imately 3000 housing units are
needed for graduate students
and staff, according to Robin
Hamil director of Housing De
velopment for the University.
Plans to further alleviate the
housing shortage will adhere
to elements of the Land Use
Policy which was adopted by
the Board of Trustees in De
cember 1980. The policy's
stated purpose is "To provide
adequate land, on a continual
ly renewing basis, for facilities
and space for the instructional
and research activities of the
University." Such a policy es
tablishes a framework for de
velopment of Stanford's 8180
acres of land.
Three cooperative forces —
Hamil; Phil Williams, land use
planner and University
architect; and Frank Morrow,
director of housing develop
ment — work in a linear proc
ess to help solve the problem.
Also, the Land Use Policy
states, "the concerns of neigh
boring jurisdictions are impor
tant and shall be considered in
a cooperative spirit in the plan
ning process."
Some of the 3000 units will be
filled by the development of
the 46 acres of Stanford West
on Willow Road between the
Oak Creek Apartments and the
Children's Hospital. Stanford
has already submitted its pro

posal for development of 1275
units at this site; an environ
mental impact report prepared
by a consultant to the city of
Palo Alto addressing Stanford
West — proposals, impacts and
alternatives — was submitted
i to the city of Palo Alto in March
and will be submitted to the
public in mid-April. Once the
report's recommendations are
in, the city council will either
approve one of the report's
suggestions or provide another
viable alternative. Such issues
as traffic control, vegetation
impacts and design configura
tions are being considered.

'Nothing is going
to be
simple... .This is
a very complex
and cumbersome
task....'

Stanford's proposed de
velopment of these 46 acres as
well as future lands will be
linked to the Land Use Policy,
which considers "natural char
acteristics of the land such as
hilltops, ridges and foreground
views." The concerns of neigh
bors whose lands bound Stan
ford's lands — Santa Clara and
San Mateo Counties, Palo Alto
and Menlo Park, and Woods
ide and Portola — will also be
weighed.
The maps in the Land Use
Policy indicate what sites are

available for housing. Possible
sites, which Hamil also recom
mended in her report, include
a site on the western end of
Lake Lagunita, next to the new
800-unit complex, the corner
of Bowdoin Street and Campus
Drive, and various sites for in
filling within the campus
bounds like Manzanita Park.
Other areas included in the
maps are Stanford North and
South, Coyote Hill, Powers Lab
and land near the Arboretum.
According to Williams, de
velopment of Stanford North
and South is"not politically ac
ceptable" because it is "en
vironmentally sensitive." The
Palo Alto-based Committee
for Green Foothills (CGF),
would like to see this land, as
well as land near Powers Lab,
"dedicated as open space," ac
cording to Betsy Crowder, CGF
vice-president.
The committee's concerns
revolve around environmental
impacts, transportation prob
lems and availability of ser
vices.
"You can't walk down to the
corner grocery store. It would
only be for the very rich," said
Crowder referring to the pos
sible development of Powers
Lab. "Is that what Stanford
needs?"
The Mayfield School, which
is presently unoccupied, was
declared suitable for housing
units by the city, University and
CGF. The school was leveled in
mid-March.
"We all agree on infilling,"

Williams stated, "because it is
practical and environmental."
Areas up in the faculty housing
area, Escondido Village and
Manzanita Park are most
viable."
Land suitability analysis in
the Land Use Plan "identifies
and evaluates certain features
of Stanford's undeveloped
lands which are useful in un
derstanding the essential char
acteristics of the landscape."
Ten environmental features
have been ranked according to
"current University environ
ment values, influenced in turn
by community and regional in
terests."
Hydrography, the study of
water, has the highest relative
weight of 17.2 of 100. Second is
the Earthquake Intensity/Slope
Stability at 16.5. Other factors
are visual quality, tree cover
and habitat. With the data from
this table, there is an environ
mental sensitivity composite.
What does Stanford need?
Hamil attempted to answer this
quantity demand question. She
is involved in allocation once
the units are built. However,
her main objective is to outline
University housing objectives.
In addition to the housing
needs recommended in her re
port, Hamil also suggested a

below-market-price program
for the University's own sub
sidizing of some of the units at
Stanford West.
For additional financial re
sources, Hamil proposed the
formation of alumni partner
ships as investors in "new ren
tal housing complexes." The
tax benefits may be con
tributed to the University.
As part of the linear process
the three directors perform,
Williams determines what sites
are available for housing. As
University planner, he applies
his architectural skills to the
two basic planning areas de
fined by the Land Use Policy:
academic and University sup
port.
There are two basic academ
ic areas: campus and academic
reserve. The faculty and stu
dents come under academic
and sites for such usage, ac
cording to Williams, "should
be close."
University support areas in
clude sites that are used for in
terim development provided
they are not used for agricul
tural use. The Industrial Park
and Shopping Center are in
terim sites.
Williams is also working with
the Medical Center in updat
ing their master planning and
with SLAC in seeking sites for

new machinery. In addition to
the habitual planning of roads,
lighting and landscaping, Wil
liams also interacts with cities
and countiesatthepublichear

As part of the linear process
the three directors perform,
Williams determines what sites
are available for housing. As
University planner, he applies
his architectural skills to the
two basic planning areas de
fined by the Land Use Policy:
academic and University sup
port.
There are two basic academ
ic areas: campus and academic
reserve. The faculty and stu
dents come under academic
and sites for such usage, ac
cording to Williams, "should
be close."
University support areas in
clude sites that are used for in
terim development provided
they are not used for agricul
tural use. The Industrial Park
and Shopping Center are in
terim sites.
Williams is also working with
the Medical Center in updat
ing their master planning and
with SLAC in seeking sites for

new machinery. In addition to
the habitual planning of roads,
lighting and landscaping, Wil
liams also interacts with cities

"Nothing is going to be
simple," he said. "This is a very
complex and cumbersome task
requiring the mutual efforts of
Robin, Frank and myself."
Morrow designs and de
velops housing projects. He is
responsible for contracting
architects and builders to carry
out his programs. His office ov
ersees faculty and staff housing
needs of the University and
creates a development pro

gram once needs have been
identified.
"We are a reactive force and
creative force," said his As
sociate Director Pam Erskin.
"We respond to the University,
city and county, wherever ju
risdiction lies."
As the developer for the Uni
versity, the Housing Develop
ment Office must also be aware
of financial constraints.
"In trying to satisfy needs
that have been identified,"
commented Erskin, "we are
also looking for alternative
sources of financial as
sistance."
Director of Community Re
lations Awndy Doty must as
suage the concerns of the sides
involved in the housing issues.
"I must explain to our neigh
bors why we need to do what
we're doing. Housing is the is
sue of the '80s locally. All poli
cies are flowing toward more
housing," he noted.
In serving the "interface be
tween the University, cities and
counties," Doty must deal with
groups like the Palo Alto Civic
League wherein a group of
people are wary of future de
velopment.
"Let's have some more,"
Doty said of their position,
"but not too much and let's be
careful."
