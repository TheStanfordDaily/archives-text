# Preamble to Land Use Policy
## 
### 
'The Board of Trustees and University
officers have a right and duty to preserve and
protect Stanford's land endowment for the
use of present and future generations of
students and faculty. While financial
considerations, land suitability and
community concerns are an integral part of
determining land use, the dominant and
prevailing consideration must be the
appropriateness of the use to the furtherance
of the University's academic mission. Board
policies should encourage land uses
consistent with the institutional characteristics
and purposes of Stanford and discourage uses
and claims which do not relate to or support
the academic purpose of the University/
As adopted by the Board of Trustees on Dec. 9,1980
