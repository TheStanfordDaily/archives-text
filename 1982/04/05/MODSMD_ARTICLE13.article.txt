## No aid for Guatemalan junta 
### 
New and as yet unresolved questions about the future
of Guatemala have arisen following the recent coup in
that country.
The March 23 ouster of President Fernando Romeo
Lucas Garcia was initiated by a group of younger, re
form-minded officers who opposed the pervasive cor
ruption and human rights abuses of the Lucas Garcia re
gime. It appears, however, that these moderate elements
within the nvlitary were unable to retain any real control
over the new junta that has been formed.
The leader of the junta, retired Brigadier General Jose
Efrain Rios Montt, was at one time considered a mod
erate; but he now appears to have abandoned many of
his earlier beliefs, not to mention the beliefs of the junior
officers who carried out the coup.
Rios Montt thus far has said nothing about holding
new elections to make up for the fraud-ridden elections
of March 7. Moreover, the junta has disbanded the legis
lature, suspended the constitution and established a
form of rule-by-decree.
U is, of course, too early to make any final judgments
about the new regime in Guatemala. It may even be that
free elections will eventually be held or that a coun
tercoup will be launched. But if, as appears possible, a
repressive military government does indeed emerge vic
torious, nothing much will have changed in Guatemala's
tragic history.
Since 1954, when the democratically-elected govern
ment of jacobo Arbenz Guzman was overthrown in a
military coup, the Guatemalan people have lived under a
series of brutal, violent and corrupt regimes. The nearly
three decades of repression in Guatemala culminated in
the presidency of General Lucas Garcia, who succeeded
in institutionalizing violence as a means of suppressing
political dissent. Relying on both official security forces
and paramilitary "death squads," Lucas Garcia often
times bore direct responsibility for the thousands of as
sassinations, massacres and other acts of violence com
mitted against opposition figures.
The extent of the brutality under Lucas Garcia was viv
idly described by New York Times columnist Flora Lewis
after an October 1981 visit:
... People are killed by the hundreds each week,
sometimes decapitated. Nobody really knows how
many. Often, nobody knows why.
Lawyers, teachers, moderate politicians are be
coming in short supply. Those who remain live in a
numb, almost thoughtless fear. Officials boast
chillingly that there are no political prisoners in
Guatemala. It seems to be too true. When there is
an arrest, a trial, people are sure it's a common
criminal because politicians are simply "disap
peared" without further ado.
Those favoring moderate reforms have come under
the greatest attack, since they are the most visible, most
accessible and least protected targets. Consequently, the
political situation in Guatemala has become dangerously
polarized, as centrist leaders have been almost entirely
eliminated. If there is no change soon, only the extreme

right and the extreme left will remain to vie for political
control.
Against this backdrop, the latest developments in
Guatemala are of more than passing significance — both
for Guatemalans and for the United States. Indeed, as far
as the United States is concerned, some important de
cisions about our overall policy toward Guatemala will
have to be made.
In 1977, President jimmy Carter cut off all military as
sistance to Guatemala, after the Guatemalan govern
ment refused to curb its human rights violations. The
Reagan administration, however, came into office with
an expressed interest in resuming military aid.
This past May, the administration dispatched an en
voy, retired General Vernon Walters, to Guatemala to
discuss U.S. conditions for the restoration of military as
sistance. One result of those discussions was the ap
proval of $3.2 million in sales of military trucks and jeeps.
The administration managed to circumvent a con
gressional ban on these sales by removing the vehicles
from restricted lists and placing them on unrestricted
ones. Sales from the unrestricted lists do not require the
recipient's human rights record to be taken into ac
count.
This first step toward a resumption of military aid
aroused strong opposition in Congress. Faced with
bipartisan resistance, the administration backed off tem
porarily from making any further sales to the regime in
Guatemala.
But with the recent change in Guatemala's govern
ment, there may be renewed pressure on the adminis
tration to seek the resumption of military ties. Indeed,
some observers believe that a number of senior officials
in the Guatemalan armed forces supported the coup in
the explicit hope that the new regime would be suffi
ciently moderate to allow U.S. aid to be restored.
Thus far, the administration has properly taken a
cautious approach to the situation in Guatemala. U.S.
Embassy officials have been ordered not to establish con
tact with the junta until General Rios Montt makes
clearer exactly what his plans for the country are.
How long this cautious attitude will prevail is another
question. Undoubtedly, some in the administration are
anxious to press ahead with military aid, even if the new
government displays little or no movement toward liber
alization.
Such hasty actions would be unfortunate. Several im
portant questions need to be answered before relations
with Guatemala are altered and in particular before mili
tary aid is provided:
• Can the administration now certify that the pattern of
violence has changed?
• Is there any evidence that the resumption of military
aid will convince the government to adopt a more hu
manitarian course toward its population?
• Will the new junta pursue democratic reforms?
• Will resumed military aid help to end the civil war in
Guatemala?
Until these questions can be answered in the af
firmative, it would be best for the United States to refrain
from supplying military aid to Guatemala. Without
greater control of human rights abuses and a renewal of
democratic processes in Guatemala, U.S. aid will be of lit
tle use in the iong run. Officials tniheHeagan adminis

ing with actions they may later regret.

Reagan administration, however, came into office with
an expressed interest in resuming military aid.
This past May, the administration dispatched an en
voy, retired General Vernon Walters, to Guatemala to
discuss U.S. conditions for the restoration of military as
sistance. One result of those discussions was the ap
proval of $3.2 million in sales of military trucks and jeeps.
The administration managed to circumvent a con
gressional ban on these sales by removing the vehicles
from restricted lists and placing them on unrestricted
ones. Sales from the unrestricted lists do not require the
recipient's human rights record to be taken into ac
count.
This first step toward a resumption of military aid
aroused strong opposition in Congress. Faced with
bipartisan resistance, the administration backed off tem
porarily from making any further sales to the regime in
Guatemala.
But with the recent change in Guatemala's govern
ment, there may be renewed pressure on the adminis
tration to seek the resumption of military ties. Indeed,
some observers believe that a number of senior officials
in the Guatemalan armed forces supported the coup in
the explicit hope that the new regime would be suffi
ciently moderate to allow U.S. aid to be restored.
Thus far, the administration has properly taken a
cautious approach to the situation in Guatemala. U.S.
Embassy officials have been ordered not to establish con
tact with the junta until General Rios Montt makes
clearer exactly what his plans for the country are.
How long this cautious attitude will prevail is another
question. Undoubtedly, some in the administration are
anxious to press ahead with military aid, even if the new
government displays little or no movement toward liber
alization.
Such hasty actions would be unfortunate. Several im
portant questions need to be answered before relations
with Guatemala are altered and in particular before mili
tary aid is provided:
• Can the administration now certify that the pattern of
violence has changed?
• Is there any evidence that the resumption of military
aid will convince the government to adopt a more hu
manitarian course toward its population?
• Will the new junta pursue democratic reforms?
• Will resumed military aid help to end the civil war in
Guatemala?
Until these questions can be answered in the af
firmative, it would be best for the United States to refrain
from supplying military aid to Guatemala. Without
greater control of human rights abuses and a renewal of
democratic processes in Guatemala, U.S. aid will be of lit
tle use in the iong run. Officials tniheHeagan adminis
tration should therefore think carefully before proceed
ing with actions they may later regret.

New and as yet unresolved questions about the future
of Guatemala have arisen following the recent coup in
that country.
The March 23 ouster of President Fernando Romeo
Lucas Garcia was initiated by a group of younger, re
form-minded officers who opposed the pervasive cor
ruption and human rights abuses of the Lucas Garcia re
gime. It appears, however, that these moderate elements
within the nvlitary were unable to retain any real control
over the new junta that has been formed.
The leader of the junta, retired Brigadier General Jose
Efrain Rios Montt, was at one time considered a mod
erate; but he now appears to have abandoned many of
his earlier beliefs, not to mention the beliefs of the junior
officers who carried out the coup.
Rios Montt thus far has said nothing about holding
new elections to make up for the fraud-ridden elections
of March 7. Moreover, the junta has disbanded the legis
lature, suspended the constitution and established a
form of rule-by-decree.
U is, of course, too early to make any final judgments
about the new regime in Guatemala. It may even be that
free elections will eventually be held or that a coun
tercoup will be launched. But if, as appears possible, a
repressive military government does indeed emerge vic
torious, nothing much will have changed in Guatemala's
tragic history.
Since 1954, when the democratically-elected govern
ment of jacobo Arbenz Guzman was overthrown in a
military coup, the Guatemalan people have lived under a
series of brutal, violent and corrupt regimes. The nearly
three decades of repression in Guatemala culminated in
the presidency of General Lucas Garcia, who succeeded
in institutionalizing violence as a means of suppressing
political dissent. Relying on both official security forces
and paramilitary "death squads," Lucas Garcia often
times bore direct responsibility for the thousands of as
sassinations, massacres and other acts of violence com
mitted against opposition figures.
The extent of the brutality under Lucas Garcia was viv
idly described by New York Times columnist Flora Lewis
after an October 1981 visit:
... People are killed by the hundreds each week,
sometimes decapitated. Nobody really knows how
many. Often, nobody knows why.
Lawyers, teachers, moderate politicians are be
coming in short supply. Those who remain live in a
numb, almost thoughtless fear. Officials boast
chillingly that there are no political prisoners in
Guatemala. It seems to be too true. When there is
an arrest, a trial, people are sure it's a common
criminal because politicians are simply "disap
peared" without further ado.
Those favoring moderate reforms have come under
the greatest attack, since they are the most visible, most
accessible and least protected targets. Consequently, the
political situation in Guatemala has become dangerously
polarized, as centrist leaders have been almost entirely
eliminated. If there is no change soon, only the extreme

right and the extreme left will remain to vie for political
control.
Against this backdrop, the latest developments in
Guatemala are of more than passing significance — both
for Guatemalans and for the United States. Indeed, as far
as the United States is concerned, some important de
cisions about our overall policy toward Guatemala will
have to be made.
In 1977, President jimmy Carter cut off all military as
sistance to Guatemala, after the Guatemalan govern
ment refused to curb its human rights violations. The
Reagan administration, however, came into office with
