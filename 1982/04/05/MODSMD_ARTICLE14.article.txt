## Conferences provide summer jobs 
### 
After reading the recent Dai/y "ex
pose" heralding alleged key abuse by
the Conference Office, under the
hasty banner of "double standard," I
would, in response, like to dispel any
perceived notions of the Conference
Office as an aggrandizing monolith
that every summer tramples the hap
less residence system underfoot,
leaving behind an inevitable residue
of malpractice.
Last summer the Conference Of
fice, after expenses, contributed ap
proximately $521,000 to the resi
dence! system and close to $67,000 to
the Food Service. Thus, for the
roughly 5300 students who are fed
and bedded by this system, the Con
ference Office effectively con
tributed $110 per student.
Furthermore, in 1981, summer stu
dents occupied but 20 percent of the
available campus beds. Such oc
cupancy, if unsupplemented, would
clearly have rendered 80 percent of
the regular residence and food ser
vice staff unnecessary. These idle
workers would have received un
employment benefits, which would
in turn increase the staff benefits
rate, ultimately affecting all Univer
sity departments, academic in
cluded. Yet last summer, as a direct
function of the conference program,
the Residence Manager's Office em
ployed 36 full-time and 40 part-time
workers; the Food Service main
tained 90 full-time, 150 part-time
jobs. Additionally the Conference
Office itself hired 92 employees,
most of them students, myself in
cluded. Even Tresidder Union stores
and the Bookstore would suffer
markedly without the summer influx
of conferees.
Finally, the conferences them
selves are often government agency
sponsored colloquia held for the dis
persal of the most current academic
knowledge. Such meetings, when
held at Stanford, redound honor
upon the University itself.
It appears to me that the combined
effects of reduced residential costs,
maintained and even augmented
employment levels and enhanced
academic nobility of the entire Uni
versity — all dependent upon the
presence of summer conferences —
collectively render the recent focus
on lost keys ultimately misdirected

and trivial journalistic tunnel vision.

Joke file censorship
I was distressed to read over the
weekend that the Jokes file in the
computer had been taken off limits
as a result of Henry Organ's com
plaint about racial and other jokes.
Henry Organ has decided that we
should not laugh at such things.
First, what happened to freedom
of speech and academic freedom?
Henry Organ's tolerance for free
dom of speech goes only as far as he
agrees with what is being said. As
soon as something possibly offensive
appears, Organ not only does not
want to read it himself, he doesn't
want anyone to read it either. Organ
has put himself in the company of
Bowdler Goebbels, the Kremlin and
the moral majority types who delight
in removing Salinger and Vonnegut
from school library shelves. If Organ
doesn't soon go through <~-een Li
brary's card catalogs and suggest de
leting the publications of Shockley
and Jensen because some say they
are racist, he is inconsistent.
Will Organ stamp out all signs of
racism at Stanford? He didn't picket
last year when "Gone With the
Wind" appeared at the Sunday Flicks.
The movie had — God forbid —
slaves in itl And what's more, the
O'Haras' slaves weren't mistreated.
The movie didn't spend time show
ing how awful slavery was. I'm sur
prised Organ could even stand it.
Aso, Organ didn't like the Natalie
Wood joke. Now he is arguing for de
letion of the files not because of what
he thinks is bad taste. What's going
on here? Who is this person to decide
Stanford's taste in jokes? This is ridic
ulous.
Second, the tail is wagging the dog
here. If the groundswell objecting to
the jokes file numbers more than two
people, that comes as news.
The Polish, Hispanic and Ital
ian protesters are conspicuously
absent. There are jokes in the file
about men as well and they leave me
strangely placid.
The story in the Peninsula Times
Tribune about this episode stated
that the University might have de
layed responding to Organ because

it was worried about censorship. I'm
glad that occurred to somebody, be
cause it's impossible to term the out
come of Organ's complaint on any
thing except censorship. Organ and
his two-person Ministry of Truth are
doing their best to make sure Stan
ford has only an approved sense of
humor and thinks only approved
thoughts.
Stanford, by caving in to Organ,
has ill served the cause of freedom.

Nuclear links to warfare
In Don Busick's recent column, in
which he attempts to question my as
sertion that the nuclear fuel cycle is
harmful and dangerous, he raises two
objections, one misleading, the oth
er nonsensical. Busick's citing of the
Oak Ridge data is necessarily in
complete. As a health physicist, he
must know that it may take 20 to 30
years for cancer to develop following
exposure to ionizing radiation. The
data he quoted may not include
those who, though they show no sign
of cancer at present, may one day suf
fer from it due to their proximity to
the Oak Ridge enrichment plant.
The greatest danger of radio
activity is both its long-lived and its
cumulative character. Busick has
spoken to neither of these issues, nor
has he made any significant points
that bring into question my critical
review of the complete nuclear fuel
cycle and its dangers. Instead, he has
resorted to personal invective and ad
homineum arguments, questioning
my sincerity and intellectual honesty.
He argues in his conclusion that
there is no connection between nu
clear warfare and nuclear power. To
believe this is to be politically naive in
the extreme: the connection be
tween the two is precisely the point
at issue. Contrary to Busick's re
assurances, all nuclear technology, as
presently constituted, is part of a sin
gle, spiralling path of environmental
devastation that must be stopped if
the integrity of the gene pool is to be
preserved.
As to his claim that studies show
energy efficient homes in Sweden
and Norway to have high concentra
tions of radon (made without citing
the studies), this is nonsensical as an
objection to my article. If such homes
in fact have radon, they are danger

ous to their inhabitants (a point I be
lieve he would not dispute). Some
other technique of conservation
must be found. What does that have
to do with the Indians of Red Rock,
dying of lung cancer and pulmonary
fibrosis as a result of their exposure to
radioactive mine tailings? Is he argu
ing that the mine tailings are safe? I
find his (ogic difficult to follow.

Meyer de-socialized
We were disturbed about the glass
enclosures that were installed in
Meyer Library. The Noisy Majority
feels that it is waste of both time and
money. Meyer is more than just a li
brary; it is a social center and gather
ing place. It has long been under
stood that those who want quiet un
interrupted study go to Green Li
brary. The rest of us go to Meyer.
Many of us can only study with back
ground noise and the potential for
meeting people.
It seems incredible to us that over
$100,000 was diverted from funds in
tended for books and education,
simply to be wasted in a project that
in fact detracts from the library and
makes it a less desirable place to
study. When the University has ex
cess funds, as this project would in
dicate, we suggest that Stanford issue
rebate checks to the students. This
would help defray the high cost of
education and social life.
