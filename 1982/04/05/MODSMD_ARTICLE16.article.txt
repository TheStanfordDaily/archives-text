## Green staff still over "supervised" 
### 
I read with great interest Lise
Giraud's viewpoint on the waste
fulness and uselessness of the Library
staff survey, and as a matter of
curiosity, polled my co-workers in
the Catalog Department in order to
see what kind of support she had, Of
62 people in the department, I briefly
interviewed about 40 and the re
sponse was overwhelmingly sup
portive of her criticisms of the survey.
Many of my co-workers are uneasy
with the survey because while os
tensibly purporting to solve the prob
lem, it actually is itself representative
of one of the main problems in the Li
brary. More than half of those in the
largest department in the Library, al
ready overwhelmed with paperwork,
meetings and bureaucracy are un
convinced that more paperwork,
meetings and bureaucracy are going
to alleviate their frustration with the
organization.
Over the years, we have witnessed
the development of an absolutely
crushing hierarchy, reaching far, far
down into the ranks. Practically every
otnerperscSn Ih tKe tibrary is noW a
"supervisor." As one of our support
staff said to me: "Bureaucratic en
trenchment is phenomenal. Ev
eryone here has internalized the

methodology for the way things go,
but it doesn't accomplish anything.
Too many people handle the same
thing; nothing goes from 'a' to 'b' to
'c'; things go from 'a' to 'a' to 'a,' and

The possibility for
self-delusion on the
part of management
is very strong now. • •

survey is their best
attempt... The staff,
however, is receiving

bureaucratic effort

enthusiasm and a

skepticism.

no rUSpohsibility is taken at any level
because management is so diffuse."
One basic problem in the Library is
that management seems to remain
stubbornly unconvinced of the staff's

intelligence and willingness to do
their job in a responsible manner.
There are official mandates for every
conceivable activity, from requiring
new yearly "goals" from employees
of 20 years who know and just want to
do their jobs, to such mundane mat
ters as forbidding food at work ex
cept when there is an officially sanc
tioned party, in which case it's per
fectly O.K. to grind macaroons into
the carpet.
I do not necessarily see man
agement as malicious, but as people
who have bought the myth that it is
they who make the organization run.
A foreign-born staff member com
mented on how self-important the
managers of institutions were in the
United States. In this person's coun
try, the worker is regarded as the
most important member of the in
stitution. A popular saying in that
country is, "The workers are the floor
on which management stands;
without its support, they collapse."
I believe the possibility for self-de
lusion on the part of management is
vefy strong now in that they may be
lieve the survey is their best attempt
at opening communication and that
we should be grateful and eager to
participate. The staff, however, is re
ceiving this latest bureaucratic effort
with only lukewarm enthusiasm and
a healthy dose of skepticism. Man
agement may interpret this staff as
being obdurate and intractable and
the whole survey becomes an ex
ercise in mutual frustration.
I can only hope that management's
response to the findings of the survey
will be truly imaginative and unique
this time; change will not come from
putting old wine in new bottles. But
Giraud's tongue-in-cheek prediction
that what will come of this survey is a
stress consultant, with an attendant
layer of administration and paper
work would be hilarious were it not
for the fact that such an outcome is
logically consistent with current ad
ministrative policy.
