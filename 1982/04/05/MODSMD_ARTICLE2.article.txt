# Former student refuses to register

Junior Matthew Nicodemus said
Friday that he will not cooperate with
registration and the draft — despite a
warning he received recently in a
compliance letter from the govern
ment — even if it means going to
prison.
"If we let registration continue
without resistance," he said a press
conference held in the All Saints
Episcopal Church in Palo Aito, "it will
become ingrained in the national
psychology and it will build up a bu
reaucratic momentum of its own that
will make it much harder to stop the
return of the draft."
Nicomedus said that he received
the letter from the Selective Service
on March 15, in response to a
statement he sent to Washington last
December. The statement, which
was directed to several national lead
ers, including President Ronald Rea
gan and General Thomas Turnage,
director of Selective Service, told of
the moral and philosophical views
behind his decision not to register.
The Selective Servicfe letter
directed Nicodemus to notify the

Selective Service of his registration
within 15 days of its receipt or face
the possibility of criminal prose
cution by the Justice Department.
Conviction for violating the Military
Selective Service Act can result in a
prison sentence of up to five years
and a fine up to $10,000.
However, Nicomedus said that the
letter is the first of two letters sent to
non-registrants before the govern
ment actually begins with criminal
proceedings. He said that a non-reg
istrant has the option to change his

mind and register at any time up to
the point of receiving the second
compliance letter without facing
prosecution.
The Selective Service has an
nounced that the Justice Department
will begin prosecuting the cases of
105 men who have not complied with
both warning letters sometime this
summer. Officials estimate that some
535,000 eligible young men have
failed to register in accordance to the
federal law.
However, Nicodemus said that the
capacities of federal prisons (esti
mated at 25,000 inmates) and courts
(approximately 40,000 cases per year)
are nearly being exceeded under
current use and that the influx of
hundreds of thousands of non-regis
tration cases would immediately
swamp both systems.
The 21-year old philosophy major
said that he has not registered as a
student during the current academic
year so that he can work against the
draft registration on a full-time basis.
A member of Stanford Against Con
scription (SAC), Nicodemus also co
edits a national draft resistance news
paper.
