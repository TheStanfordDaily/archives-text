### Diane Johnson 
Everyone has seen that little
pink pig on campus. It's on t
shirts, posters, walls, buttons —
you name it. But what does it
stand for? "It represents art,
music, all the kinds of things we
do," says Jean Martin. And who
are "we?" Student Arts at Stan
ford, more commonly known
as STARTS.
Currently in its 13th year, the
Tresidder program board, now
called STARTS, aims to provide
entertainment, lectures and
"Culture Down on the Farm"
for the entire Stanford com
munity. "Our program is by
students, for students and at
student prices," said Martin,
the program's director. "The
group is light-hearted but has a
serious purpose."
STARTS has grown from a
board with three members to
one of more than 50 since it
began in 1969. The board is
open to all students and is
selected through an applica
tion and interview process.
Once chosen, board members
are free to remain with STARTS
until they graduate from Stan
ford.
"We try to bring students
into a setting where nobody's
going to give them a grade or
judge them," explained
Martin. "They're free to de
velop ideas, produce events
and learn something from the
experience. Sometimes they
learn as much, even more,
from things that fail," she said.
Members of the board meet
each Tuesday to share ideas
and brief one another on cur
rent projects. Chairperson Ben
Wilson expressed satisfaction
with his participation in
STARTS.
"It's a very family-like feeling
here — everyone's very close,
especially because it's not a
one-year term. What I've
gained most is confidence in
myself. It's so nice to see peo
ple enjoying what you've
worked so hard to ac

complish."
One accomplishment of
which STARTS members are es
pecially proud is the Windham
Hill Acoustic festival, held in
Tresidder Union Lounge this
winter. According to Wilson,
this was the biggest event of
the quarter and was very suc
cessful. For spring, STARTS
members are looking forward
to the Joy Spring Jazz Festival
featuring jazz bands from the
City. This event, scheduled for
May 1, will provide an after
noon of free entertainment on
the Tresidder patio.
STARTS also has in their
spring quarter plans: "Pro
fessors in Performance," an an
nual faculty talent show; a
"Great Directors Film Series"
to be held Wednesday eve
nings and an "MGM Musical
night" scheduled for each
Tuesday in May.
The usual Coffee House
events such as Thursday night
open mike, Friday and Satur
day evening live entertain
ment, Monday noon piano and
Friday happy hours will con
tinue through spring quarter,
with an expanded Happy Hour
into Thursday afternoons.
STARTS is offering yet anoth
er chance for students to dis
play their talents. "Student
Spotlight," a new addition, is
an opportunity for Stanford
students to perform in the up
stairs Tresidder iounge for an
evening. STARTS will accept
applications from those wish
ing to perform and will then
select two or three groups or
individuals to "appear before
the spotlight." STARTS will
handle all publicity planning
and will provide technical help
for this free event.
STARTS is comprised of sev
en committees, each of which
is responsible for various
projects. For example, the Mu
sic and Noon Entertainment
committee handles ali noon
concerts, graduate student
TGIFs, Coffee House activities

and lounge concerts featuring
local talent. The members may
spend their time auditioning
and booking bands, or helping
arrange and organize financial
affairs.
The STARTS Classes commit
tee will offer such Spring
courses as Ballroom Dance,
Calligraphy, Guitar, Exercise,
Juggling, International Cook
ing, Fabric painting, Advanced
Jazz Aerobics and a class on
Dance and Imagination. Ac
cording to committee Chair
Neva Buyco, Ballroom Dancing
consistently received the larg
est turnout with more than 100
enrollees each quarter. All
classes are non-credit and are
financed by a registration fee.
STARTS has recently become
involved with Encina Station's
programming and a new Tues
day wine tasting series. They
are pushing for more Encina
Station funding through the
Tresidder Union Board and
hope to improve the acoustics
and the furniture stock in the
near future, according to
Wilson.
At the moment, STARTS is
focusing its efforts on this
Thursday's Sock Hop in the
Union Crossroads in celebra
tion of Donald Tresidder's
birthday. Those interested are
urged to come dressed for the
occasion and ready to do some
serious boppin' to The Toons.
How can STARTS afford to
provide such extravagant per
formances, classes and ex
hibits? Martin explained that
all teachers/artists set the fee
for their classes and then
STARTS keeps 20 percent of the
profits. "We've become a big
business," Martin said. "Last
year we grossed $190,000 with
$100,000 coming from the
Christmas Faire alone. It's from
this that we're able to support
all free programs such as noon
concerts, Coffee House ac
tivities, etc. We started small
but we've gradually built up a
strong program," she said.
