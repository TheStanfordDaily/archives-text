# Quiz questions no trivial matter

How many dimples are on a golf ball?
(336) Who are the Three Musketeers?
(Arthos, Porthos and Aramis) What was
the name of the bank's secretary on The
Beverly Hillbillies? (Jane Hathaway).
The American Studies/KZSU Second
Annual Triviathon, last Thursday night
featured these and other not-so-well
known facts.
During the contest, KZSU disc
jockeys junior Steve Mitchell and junior
Andy Brandt asked trivia bowl ques
tions every 15 minutes and on the hour.
According to Mitchell, more than 70
teams participated in the triviathon.
Team size was not limited.
The value of correct answers to stan
dard questions varied between one and
seven points. For example, if you
"boned" up on how may bones are in
the human body, you might have re
ceived one point. A "host" of other
questions included naming the emcee
of Soul Train (Don Cornelius) and iden
tifying who introduced Johnny Carson
on his first night on The Tonight Show
(Groucho Marx).
Jerry's Kids, co-captained by senior
Steve Simmonds and junior Chuck
Spolyar, "bowled" over the other trivia
buff teams to win with 186 points. Jerry's
Kids consisted of senior Mark Wilson,

senior Andy Clarke, senior Gwen Rich
ards, junior Mike Phelps and junior Bill
Pulliam. The seven-man team gained
the grand prize: 10 It's Its, six Miller Lite
beer mirrors, free bowling at Tresidder
and several pizzas.
According to Mitchell, Miller beer
donated the mirrors in exchange for the
last bonus question given at midnight.
Teams received one point for each of
the 69 performers in Lite beer com
mercials which they identified.
The second place team, Erin's Baby,
fared best on the beer question, phon
ing in 55 of the 69 stars. (Jerry's Kids
identified only 32). According to team
member sophomore Erin Craig, her
team had predicted the question earlier
in the evening. Last year's bonus ques
tion asked teams to identify American
Express commercial stars; Erin's Baby
deduced that the Miller Lite beer ad
would be a logical successor. Before the
triviathon began, Erin's Baby was able to
identify 40 stars on a Lite beer poster.
Why was the second place team
called Erin's Baby? According to Craig,
shp had convinced her R.A. on April
Fool's Day that she was pregnant. "Ever
since then it's been kind of a joke," she
said.
Erin's Baby, led by junior Tom
Counts, consisted of about 20 mem

bers.
Erin's Baby came away from the con
test with eight It's Its, two pizzas and 10
tickets to Cabaret but without any spe
cific prizes for finishing second.
"We were really surprised," said
Craig.
Mitchell said the triviathon ori
ginated last year as an American Studies
project. "It went over pretty well with
no publicity last year," he said.
Triviathon organizers created the
questions with the help of trivia books
this year, said Mitchell. "Last year we
had about four guys and a keg of beer.
We just sat around and thought up
questions."
Jerry's Kids co-captain Simmonds
said his team is producing the Sixth An
nual Stanford Trivia Bowl at Tresidder
Apr. 14 through 16. The trivia contest is
sponsored by Stanford Lovers of Un
usual Trivia. Entry forms are available at
the Bookstore.
Simmonds said his team had the ad
vantage of two phones. "The hardest
thing was getting through," he said.
Speaking of telephones, question
46 at 11:30 p.m. called for identi
fication of the first President of the
United States to use one. (If you
guessed James Garfield, you get one
pointl)
