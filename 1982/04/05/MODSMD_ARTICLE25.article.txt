## Card nine swept by Arizona State 
### Sid Spaeth 
TEMPE, Arizona — Arizona
State bounced out of a March
hitting slump to score 43 runs
in three games and sweep a
critical conference •baseball
series against Stanford last
weekend.
ASU trounced the Card 16-4
Friday, scoring early and often.
Saturday, the Sun Devils came
back from a 7-2 defecit in a far
cical bottom of the ninth in
ning to edge the Card 8-7, and
Sunday, ASU scored every in
ning to whip a downtrodden
Stanford squad 19-5.
The Cardinal, now 29-10
(10-5 conference) led the six
team Southern Division of the
Pacific-10 going into the series,
but now trails the Sundevils
(34-7, 9-2 conference). Stan
ford heads into a three-game
series against Arizona in
Tucson tonight through
Wednesday.
Arizona State opened Friday

night's game by ripping Stan
ford ace Brian Mignano for 13
hits and 11 runs. ASU's first five
batters scored before Mignano
could shut down the first in
ning barrage.
ASU right fielder Kevin
Romine, who along with Mike
Pagel and Alvin Davis would
prove to be a nemesis for Stan
ford pitchers all week, led off
the bottom of the first inning
by beating out an infield
grounder and stealing second.
Davis lined an RBI single to
right. Mignano hit Ronni
Salcedo to load the bases and
Gib Seibert opened the game
up, ripping a three-run triple
down the right field line.
Arizona State padded their
lead, scoring in every inning
until the seventh.
Mignano (8-1), who led the
nation in wins before the game
and had a paltry 1.42 ERA, saw
his ERA blossom to 3.54 Friday,
but both Stanford coach Mark
Marquess and ASU coach Jim

Broch agreed his statistics did
not reflect his pitching.
"I thought it was more our
doing than his undoing,"
Broch said. "We just had the
hot bats."
"When Brian pitches poor
ly," Marquess echoed, "it's
usually because he has control
problems. His control seemed
okay tonight, but they still hit
him."
There were no bright spots
for Stanford. Mike Hogan went
the distance to pick up the win
for Arizona State.
Stanford ran out to a solid 7-2
lead Saturday behind a brilliant
pitching performance by
sophomore Brian Myers.
Myers scattered eight hits and
the Cardinal picked up two
runs in each of the last three in
nings to hold a comfortable
margin going down to the last
three outs.
Myers got into a mild jam in
the bottom of the ninth which
led to a situation which could
only be described as a farce.
In short, Arizona State
scored six runs on only two hits
to steal the win. Seven walks

were given to the Sun Devils,
including five straight to end
the game. Myers gave up one
walk before Marquess brought
in senior Mike Sullivan, who
walked five of the next eight
batters. Steve Cottrell then
came in to walk in the final run.
A visibly upset Marquess re
sponded to charges that he
should have made a pitching
change sobner.
"My question is why not call
a strike?" Marquess asked
blankly. "From my angle, the
pitchers were doing fine. Why
take him out, it wouldn't have
made any difference. Its pretty
tough to score six runs on two
hits. I'll guarantee one thing,
they (ASU batters) weren't
going to swing the bat. I'm
pretty proud of everybody, but
it is hard to win a game when
the first five or six innings don't
make a difference on the out
come."
Catcher Bob Hausladin, who
was behind the plate for Stan
ford the entire game, said the
home plate umpire changed
his strike zone in the last in
ning.

"He didn't really start to
squeeze it (the strike zone) un
til the last couple of guys when
he* saw they had a chance,"
Hausladin said. "I think he has
to make them swing the bat.
Giving away three balls — all
close — right away, makes it
pretty tough on the pitcher. He
told me he wasn't calling them
different from earlier, but I
know he was."
Sullivan, 3-1, was tagged with
the loss while ASU reliever Bob
Fingers threw one pitch to pick
up the win.
Sunday the disenchanted
Cardinal allowed the Sun Dev
ils to score in every inning and
walk away with a 19-5 victory.
Freshman starter Jeff Ballard,
5-3, picked up the loss. Jim
Boudreau, 5-0, picked up the
win for Arizona State.
Sundevil left fielder Pagel,
who as a quarterback broke
several conference records in
leading ASU to a 62-36 win over
Stanford in football last fall,
tied an ASU record by getting
nine consecutive hits in the
series.

Rono of Kenya (left) in the 5000 meters. Padilla set a new stadium record in the event,

TEMPE, Arizona — Arizona
State bounced out of a March
hitting slump to score 43 runs
in three games and sweep a
critical conference •baseball
series against Stanford last
weekend.
ASU trounced the Card 16-4
Friday, scoring early and often.
Saturday, the Sun Devils came
back from a 7-2 defecit in a far
cical bottom of the ninth in
ning to edge the Card 8-7, and
Sunday, ASU scored every in
ning to whip a downtrodden
Stanford squad 19-5.
The Cardinal, now 29-10
(10-5 conference) led the six
team Southern Division of the
Pacific-10 going into the series,
but now trails the Sundevils
(34-7, 9-2 conference). Stan
ford heads into a three-game
series against Arizona in
Tucson tonight through
Wednesday.
Arizona State opened Friday

night's game by ripping Stan
ford ace Brian Mignano for 13
hits and 11 runs. ASU's first five
batters scored before Mignano
could shut down the first in
ning barrage.
ASU right fielder Kevin
Romine, who along with Mike
Pagel and Alvin Davis would
prove to be a nemesis for Stan
ford pitchers all week, led off
the bottom of the first inning
by beating out an infield
grounder and stealing second.
Davis lined an RBI single to
right. Mignano hit Ronni
Salcedo to load the bases and
Gib Seibert opened the game
up, ripping a three-run triple
down the right field line.
Arizona State padded their
lead, scoring in every inning
until the seventh.
Mignano (8-1), who led the
nation in wins before the game
and had a paltry 1.42 ERA, saw
his ERA blossom to 3.54 Friday,
but both Stanford coach Mark
Marquess and ASU coach Jim

Broch agreed his statistics did
not reflect his pitching.
"I thought it was more our
doing than his undoing,"
Broch said. "We just had the
hot bats."
"When Brian pitches poor
ly," Marquess echoed, "it's
usually because he has control
problems. His control seemed
okay tonight, but they still hit
him."
There were no bright spots
for Stanford. Mike Hogan went
the distance to pick up the win
for Arizona State.
Stanford ran out to a solid 7-2
lead Saturday behind a brilliant
pitching performance by
sophomore Brian Myers.
Myers scattered eight hits and
the Cardinal picked up two
runs in each of the last three in
nings to hold a comfortable
margin going down to the last
three outs.
Myers got into a mild jam in
the bottom of the ninth which
led to a situation which could
only be described as a farce.
In short, Arizona State
scored six runs on only two hits
to steal the win. Seven walks

were given to the Sun Devils,
including five straight to end
the game. Myers gave up one
walk before Marquess brought
in senior Mike Sullivan, who
walked five of the next eight
batters. Steve Cottrell then
came in to walk in the final run.
A visibly upset Marquess re
sponded to charges that he
should have made a pitching
change sobner.
"My question is why not call
a strike?" Marquess asked
blankly. "From my angle, the
pitchers were doing fine. Why
take him out, it wouldn't have
made any difference. Its pretty
tough to score six runs on two
hits. I'll guarantee one thing,
they (ASU batters) weren't
going to swing the bat. I'm
pretty proud of everybody, but
it is hard to win a game when
the first five or six innings don't
make a difference on the out
come."
Catcher Bob Hausladin, who
was behind the plate for Stan
ford the entire game, said the
home plate umpire changed
his strike zone in the last in
ning.

"He didn't really start to
squeeze it (the strike zone) un
til the last couple of guys when
he* saw they had a chance,"
Hausladin said. "I think he has
to make them swing the bat.
Giving away three balls — all
close — right away, makes it
pretty tough on the pitcher. He
told me he wasn't calling them
different from earlier, but I
know he was."
Sullivan, 3-1, was tagged with
the loss while ASU reliever Bob
Fingers threw one pitch to pick
up the win.
Sunday the disenchanted
Cardinal allowed the Sun Dev
ils to score in every inning and
walk away with a 19-5 victory.
Freshman starter Jeff Ballard,
5-3, picked up the loss. Jim
Boudreau, 5-0, picked up the
win for Arizona State.
Sundevil left fielder Pagel,
who as a quarterback broke
several conference records in
leading ASU to a 62-36 win over
Stanford in football last fall,
tied an ASU record by getting
nine consecutive hits in the
series.
