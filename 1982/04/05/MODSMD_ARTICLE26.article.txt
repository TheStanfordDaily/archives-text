Despite a good deal of rain,
Stanford's Martin Luther King
Jr. Track and Field Games, held
Friday and Saturday, were a
huge success. Approximately
3000 top athletes from all over
the country competed in the
games and Stanford track and
field members made an im
pressive showing.
The meet in included several
age groups and levels of com
petition. There were high
school events for the top-rank
ing California schools. The up
per level included categories
for university, open, and junior
college athletes. Finally, for the
best, there were the King
Games events. All track and
field events were included in
each of these categories.
One highlight was the wom
en's distance medly in which
Stanford's team composed of
Regina Jacobs (880-yard dash),
Margaret Demorest (440), Ceci
Hopp (1320), and PattiSue
Plumer (mile) competed. San
Diego State provided stiff com
petition in this event, even
tually winning with a time of
11:13.3, followed by Stanford at
11:20.4. San Diego's time set
both meet and stadium rec
ords.
Approximately an hour later
Regina Jacobs ran again to pro
duce Stanford's most im
pressive perform ance. lacohs
cruised to victory in the King
Games 800-meter run with a
personal and school record of

2:05.7. She ran against Ameri
can Jan Merrill, American rec
ord holder in the 5000-meters,
yet Jacobs was unchallenged at
the finish.
"I felt really loose," re
marked Jacobs. "As long as I re
lax and run my own race, I
don't have to worry too much
about being nervous."
Another stadium was broken
in the 4xloo meter women's re
lay as a team from USC broke a
record that has stood for 20
years.
In the 1500 meters, two Stan
ford distance runners per
fomed well. Sophomore Pat
tiSue Plumer placed second,
while freshman Ceci Hopp
came in seventh.
Another strong performance
came from senior Cardinal
hurdler Garry Shumwayy who
placed third in the 400-meter
hurdles amidst a field of na
tionally ranked hurdlers.
The most exciting race of the
day was Doug Padilla's upset of
world record holder Henry
Rono of Kenya in the 5000
meters. Padilla won the race in
13:35.8 and broke the meet
record by nearly 10 secondss.
Stanford head coach Brooks
Johnson who organized this
years meet, looks to an even
more impressive turnout in
future yedrs. The event has
grown since its first meeting in
1969 and is now considered
one of the foremost track
meets in the country.
