# Women beat Irvine
## 
### Robert Stone 
With a sound 8-1 drubbing of UC-lrvine Saturday, Stan
ford's women's tennis team should bolt to the top spot in
the national rankings, according to head coach Frank Bren
nan.
Last week's poll listed the Cardinal at the the number two
position behind perennial powerhouse UCLA, but Stan
ford's 10-0 record — including a 6-3 win over the Bruins at
the National Indoor Championships in March — should
provide the team with the leverage it needs to cap the rank
ings this week.
Brennan seemed satisfied with his team's performances,
especially in light of damp courts and grey skies threatening
during the match. "We actually played very well consider
ing that we.haven't practiced for a week because of the
weather," he said. Stanford's March 26 match against USC
was cancelled due to rain.
Saturday's match at the soggy Stanford tennis Stadium af
forded no surprises as the Cardinal lineup generally out
hustled the Irvine squad, which dropped to 14-8. Top
seeded Cardinal All-America Alycia Moulton improved her
dual match record to 5-3 by overpowering Irvine's Maria
Meyers 6-0,6-2. The highly-touted senior set the pattern for
all Stanford victories, with all the matches decided in two
sets.
The closest battle of the day was waged between Stan
ford's number five seed Susy Jaeger and Irvine's Leslie El
ledge, which Jaeger dropped 5-7,4-6 for the Cardinal's lone
setback. Hampered by a foot injury for the majority of her
freshman campaign, Jaeger is making a comeback after
seeing almost no action for the past few months.
In singles' play, Stanford kept two perfect records intact
as sophomore All-America Elise Burgin defeated Cindy
Kelling 6-2, 6-1 at the number two spot, and third-seeded
freshman Kate Gompert overtook Karen Nixon 6-1, 6-2.
Burgin, who Brennan cited as playing particularly well in the
match, improved her record to 6-0 on the season, while
Gompert increased her streak to 8-0.
Number-four seed Caryn Copeland beat Melinda
Meyers 6-0, 6-1, to improve to 7-3 on the season, while
Alison Hardey subdued Irvine's Bonnie Serrano 6-1, 6-0 to
round out single's action.
Stanford swept the doubles competition in straighjt sets
although the pairs seemed more evenly matched. Burgin
teamed with freshman Linda Gates to defeat Irvine' pair of
Meyers-Meyers 6-2, 6-4, while the All-America tandem of
Moulton-Copeland thwarted Malory-Kelling 6-4, 6-1. The
closest doubles' match saw Gompert and Michelle
Weiss outlast a stubborn Nixon-Elledge duo 6-3, 6-4.
