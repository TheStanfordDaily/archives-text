## 
### Mark Zeigler 
Coach Tim Schaaf's men's
golf team went from great to
good to god-awful in the
three-day Fresno Invitational
this past weekend at Fort Wash
ington Country Club.
Translated into numbers, the
Cardinal shot an aggregate
tour over par 364 Thursday, a
373 Friday, and a 383 Saturday
on the par-72 course. Their
three-day total of 1119 put
them in sixth place, 29 strokes
behind winner USC.
After the first day of com
petition, Stanford was a mere
stroke off USC's three over par
pace. But the Card fell from
second place Friday and well
into the pack Saturday.
USC finished with a three
day total of 1090, three shots
ahead of UCLA in second. San
Jose State, placed third, fol
lowed by host Fresno State and
BYU. West coast power San Di
ego State concluded the tour

ney a surprising tenth.
Tim Robinson led Stanford
with a five over par total of 221.
Josh Mondry and Lanny
Sawchuck, after shooting a pair
of 70's on Thursday, finished
with 222 and 224, respectively.
Doug Thompson checked in at
226.
The Card heads to Santa
Cruz today for the Western In
tercollegiate at Pasatiempo
Golf Course. The four-day
event should prove to be a big
test for Schaaf and his squad,
with only Arizona's Sun Devil
Intercollegiate standing be
tween them and May's Pac-10
championships in Corvallis,
Oregon.
The women's team is also on
the road this week — in Phoe
nix, Arizona — for the Lady Sun
Devil, which begins today and
finishes Wednesday. The tour
nament is one of the Lady
Card's most important of the
season.
