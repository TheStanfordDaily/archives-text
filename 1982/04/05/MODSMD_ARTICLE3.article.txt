Argentina vows to fight over Falklands
Buenos Aires — Argentina and Great Britain continued in a bellig
erent standoff yesterday over Argentina's occupation of the Falkland Is
lands as Buenos Aires, echoing London's stance, said it was prepared to
use military force. The government here also announced economic
sanctions against Britain and tight security measures on Falklands resi
dents.
Both governments said fighting broke out Saturday between Argen
tine troops and British marines as Argentine forces moved on South
Georgia Island, a dependency of the Falklands 900 miles to the south
east.
A communique issued by the ruling junta here said that three Argen
tine soldiers had been killed in the engagement. No British casualties
were reported.
British Defense Secretary John Nott said in London that 22 Marines in
Grytviken, an Antarctic observation post on South Georgia Island, were
overwhelmed after destroying an Argentine helicopter and damaging a
corvette patrol boat.
Argentine President Leopoldo Galtieri responded to reports of a Brit
ish naval mission to the Falkland Islands — called Malvinas here — early
yesterday morning by saying that If Argentina is attacked, the nation
"will give battle... in arms, with all the means available."
In London, Nott reiterated that Britain will use force "if necessary" to
retake the South Atlantic archipelago.
