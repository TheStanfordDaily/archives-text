Argentina vows to fight over Falklands
Buenos Aires — Argentina and Great Britain continued in a bellig
erent standoff yesterday over Argentina's occupation of the Falkland Is
lands as Buenos Aires, echoing London's stance, said it was prepared to
use military force. The government here also announced economic
sanctions against Britain and tight security measures on Falklands resi
dents.
Both governments said fighting broke out Saturday between Argen
tine troops and British marines as Argentine forces moved on South
Georgia Island, a dependency of the Falklands 900 miles to the south
east.
A communique issued by the ruling junta here said that three Argen
tine soldiers had been killed in the engagement. No British casualties
were reported.
British Defense Secretary John Nott said in London that 22 Marines in
Grytviken, an Antarctic observation post on South Georgia Island, were
overwhelmed after destroying an Argentine helicopter and damaging a
corvette patrol boat.
Argentine President Leopoldo Galtieri responded to reports of a Brit
ish naval mission to the Falkland Islands — called Malvinas here — early
yesterday morning by saying that If Argentina is attacked, the nation
"will give battle... in arms, with all the means available."
In London, Nott reiterated that Britain will use force "if necessary" to
retake the South Atlantic archipelago.
The fighting on South Georgia marked the
second instance of armed British resistance to
Argentina's invasion of the archipelago, which
began early Friday with a well-planned air and
naval move against the Falkland island group
during which one Argentine officer was killed.
Argentina, which has claimed the entire
network of islands beginning about 300 miles
off its southern coast ever since its garrison was
expelled by the British in 1833, ordered the
Falklands' 1800 residents to remain in their
homes until further notice Saturday and im
posed tight restrictions "to consolidate the con
trol gained over the population," the govern
ment news agency reported.
In English and Spanish radio broadcasts and
in notices delivered in the island's town of Port
Stanley — now known as Port Rivero by the Ar
gentines — residents were told that anyone
found outside their home would be arrested,
according to the report.
Those suffering "serious inconvenience" be
cause of the restriction could attach a white
handkerchief to their doors, the bulletin said,
and would be helped by military patrol.
Israel denounces PLO
Jerusalem — The Israeli government yester
day called upon all European nations to close
down Palestine Liberation Organization offices
in their capitals following Saturday's killing of
an Israeli diplomat in Paris.
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, citing what
he termed an "incessant chain of murders and
terrorist actions" against Israeli targets in Eu
rope, charged that many PLO offices in Europe
"serve as bases of these activities."
Several ministers at a Cabinet meeting ex
pressed the opinion that the shooting repre
sented a serious violation of the July 24 cease
fire agreement between Israel and the PLO fol
lowing a three-month cross-border war of attri
tion last summer, Cabinet sources said.
Two Israelis were injured in a hand-grenade
attack in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, which
was also cited as a cease-fire violation by Israeli
officials. Israel has pledged to respect the cease
fire only as long as the Palestinians do not strike
first.
Meanwhile, several hundred protesters re
mained in the Mediterranean resort town of
Yamit in the occupied Sinai with no sign of a for
cible eviction by army troops four days after the
deadline for evacuation of all settlers prior to
the scheduled April 25 return of the area to
Egypt.
In a meeting in Tel Aviv Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon reportedly told the Yamit settlers

that no effort to evict them would begin until
after the week-long Passover holiday, which
begins Wednesday night.
The Cabinet, meeting as a ministerial com
mittee on security and defense, discussed the
murder of Yacov Barsimontov, second secretary
in the Israeli Embassy in Paris, outside his home.
The PLO denied responsibility for the slaying,
but a group identified as the Lebanese Armed
Revolutionary Brigade said it was behind
Barsimantov's murder and a submachine-gun
attack last week on an Israeli arms- purchasing
mission's office in Paris.
Archbishop sees more terror
San Salvador — The leader of El Salvador's
powerful Roman Catholic Church yesterday
warned that last weekend's elections may only
have been a brief aside in the political violence
tearing at this country. Even as he spoke, the
terror of hit-and-run assassinations, apparently
by both the left and right, picked up its pace in
the capital.
In his first homily since the polling on March
28 acting Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas de
scribed the massive turnout as a "vote in favor
of peace, democracy and justice" and called on
leftist guerrillas to "accept the judgement of the
people" and lay down their arms.
But at the same time, in impassioned lan
guage clearly directed at right-wing parties
trying to form a coalition to dominate the new
government, he warned politicians not to "play
with the will of the people" as if "the rivers of
blood that have been spilled counted for noth
ing."
"Despite the parenthesis of election day, the
moment we are living is full of dense, dark
clouds, of uncertainties, as when a storm draws
near," Rivera Damas told a crowd carrying palm
fronds and filling the cavernous interior of the
unfinished metropolitan cathedral on this first
day of Holy Week.
Brezhnev era may be ending
Moscow — The reported hospitalization of
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev has contributed
to a charged atmosphere here of rumors and
speculation that the Brezhnev era may be draw
ing to a close and that the power struggle ul
timately to succeed him has begun.
Brezhnev, 75, has been ill before, each time
setting off speculation about succession, but
each time he has managed to recuperate and to
emerge even more firmly in control of the
Kremlin. There are no visible indications this
time that his power is being challenged directly.
Semi-official Soviet sources who frequently
pass information to Westerners suggested Sat

urday that a picture of Brezhnev was likely to
appear in the Soviet media as soon as he re
covers sufficiently. No photographs of trie Sovi
et leader have been published in the past eight
days and there have been no public suggestions
here that he was incapacitated.
Nonetheless, rumors have mushroomed
about Brezhnev's condition and the jockeying
for position by the Kremlin's senior politicians.
While the hospitalization is the immediate rea
son for this, other crucial questions are pressing
the Kremlin'saging leaders, including the prob
lems of the Soviet Union's stagnating economy
and sensitive foreign policy and security mat
ters.
Kremlin policies these days are a product of
entrenched interests that are more durable
than any single personality. Brezhnev's success
as leader has hinged on his skills as manager of
the ruling Politburo and as a careful broker.
U.S. seeks peace for Falklands
Washington — U.S. officials sought anxiously
Saturday for ways to forestall a military clash
over the obscure Falkland Islands that might
force this country to choose between a sudden?
ly aroused Britain, its closest global ally, and in
flamed neighbors in South and Central Ameri
ca.
Although it struck many as a cross between a
19th-century melodrama and a Peter Sellers
farce, the British-Argentine struggle was no
laughing matter at the White House and State
Department, where policy makers tokk very se
riously what they see as a threat of war which
may have serious implications for the United
States.
Given the steaming time and readiness of the
British fleet, Washington officials estimated that
they have about two weeks to head off a major
military engagement in the South Atlantic. But
as of now, there is no clear plan within the ad
ministration for averting that collision.
"This isa no-win situation for the United
States," said an official, pointing out that its
close and longstanding "special relationship"
and NATO alliance with Britain would be in a
tug of war with U.S. interests in Latin America
and possibly even its commitments to hemi
spheric defense under the Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, or Rio Treaty.

Argentina vows to fight over Falklands
Buenos Aires — Argentina and Great Britain continued in a bellig
erent standoff yesterday over Argentina's occupation of the Falkland Is
lands as Buenos Aires, echoing London's stance, said it was prepared to
use military force. The government here also announced economic
sanctions against Britain and tight security measures on Falklands resi
dents.
Both governments said fighting broke out Saturday between Argen
tine troops and British marines as Argentine forces moved on South
Georgia Island, a dependency of the Falklands 900 miles to the south
east.
A communique issued by the ruling junta here said that three Argen
tine soldiers had been killed in the engagement. No British casualties
were reported.
British Defense Secretary John Nott said in London that 22 Marines in
Grytviken, an Antarctic observation post on South Georgia Island, were
overwhelmed after destroying an Argentine helicopter and damaging a
corvette patrol boat.
Argentine President Leopoldo Galtieri responded to reports of a Brit
ish naval mission to the Falkland Islands — called Malvinas here — early
yesterday morning by saying that If Argentina is attacked, the nation
"will give battle... in arms, with all the means available."
In London, Nott reiterated that Britain will use force "if necessary" to
retake the South Atlantic archipelago.
The fighting on South Georgia marked the
second instance of armed British resistance to
Argentina's invasion of the archipelago, which
began early Friday with a well-planned air and
naval move against the Falkland island group
during which one Argentine officer was killed.
Argentina, which has claimed the entire
network of islands beginning about 300 miles
off its southern coast ever since its garrison was
expelled by the British in 1833, ordered the
Falklands' 1800 residents to remain in their
homes until further notice Saturday and im
posed tight restrictions "to consolidate the con
trol gained over the population," the govern
ment news agency reported.
In English and Spanish radio broadcasts and
in notices delivered in the island's town of Port
Stanley — now known as Port Rivero by the Ar
gentines — residents were told that anyone
found outside their home would be arrested,
according to the report.
Those suffering "serious inconvenience" be
cause of the restriction could attach a white
handkerchief to their doors, the bulletin said,
and would be helped by military patrol.
Israel denounces PLO
Jerusalem — The Israeli government yester
day called upon all European nations to close
down Palestine Liberation Organization offices
in their capitals following Saturday's killing of
an Israeli diplomat in Paris.
Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, citing what
he termed an "incessant chain of murders and
terrorist actions" against Israeli targets in Eu
rope, charged that many PLO offices in Europe
"serve as bases of these activities."
Several ministers at a Cabinet meeting ex
pressed the opinion that the shooting repre
sented a serious violation of the July 24 cease
fire agreement between Israel and the PLO fol
lowing a three-month cross-border war of attri
tion last summer, Cabinet sources said.
Two Israelis were injured in a hand-grenade
attack in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, which
was also cited as a cease-fire violation by Israeli
officials. Israel has pledged to respect the cease
fire only as long as the Palestinians do not strike
first.
Meanwhile, several hundred protesters re
mained in the Mediterranean resort town of
Yamit in the occupied Sinai with no sign of a for
cible eviction by army troops four days after the
deadline for evacuation of all settlers prior to
the scheduled April 25 return of the area to
Egypt.
In a meeting in Tel Aviv Defense Minister
Ariel Sharon reportedly told the Yamit settlers

that no effort to evict them would begin until
after the week-long Passover holiday, which
begins Wednesday night.
The Cabinet, meeting as a ministerial com
mittee on security and defense, discussed the
murder of Yacov Barsimontov, second secretary
in the Israeli Embassy in Paris, outside his home.
The PLO denied responsibility for the slaying,
but a group identified as the Lebanese Armed
Revolutionary Brigade said it was behind
Barsimantov's murder and a submachine-gun
attack last week on an Israeli arms- purchasing
mission's office in Paris.
Archbishop sees more terror
San Salvador — The leader of El Salvador's
powerful Roman Catholic Church yesterday
warned that last weekend's elections may only
have been a brief aside in the political violence
tearing at this country. Even as he spoke, the
terror of hit-and-run assassinations, apparently
by both the left and right, picked up its pace in
the capital.
In his first homily since the polling on March
28 acting Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas de
scribed the massive turnout as a "vote in favor
of peace, democracy and justice" and called on
leftist guerrillas to "accept the judgement of the
people" and lay down their arms.
But at the same time, in impassioned lan
guage clearly directed at right-wing parties
trying to form a coalition to dominate the new
government, he warned politicians not to "play
with the will of the people" as if "the rivers of
blood that have been spilled counted for noth
ing."
"Despite the parenthesis of election day, the
moment we are living is full of dense, dark
clouds, of uncertainties, as when a storm draws
near," Rivera Damas told a crowd carrying palm
fronds and filling the cavernous interior of the
unfinished metropolitan cathedral on this first

Brezhnev era may be ending
Moscow — The reported hospitalization of
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev has contributed
to a charged atmosphere here of rumors and
speculation that the Brezhnev era may be draw
ing to a close and that the power struggle ul
timately to succeed him has begun.
Brezhnev, 75, has been ill before, each time
setting off speculation about succession, but
each time he has managed to recuperate and to
emerge even more firmly in control of the
Kremlin. There are no visible indications this
time that his power is being challenged directly.
Semi-official Soviet sources who frequently
pass information to Westerners suggested Sat

urday that a picture of Brezhnev was likely to
appear in the Soviet media as soon as he re
covers sufficiently. No photographs of trie Sovi
et leader have been published in the past eight
days and there have been no public suggestions
here that he was incapacitated.
Nonetheless, rumors have mushroomed
about Brezhnev's condition and the jockeying
for position by the Kremlin's senior politicians.
While the hospitalization is the immediate rea
son for this, other crucial questions are pressing
the Kremlin'saging leaders, including the prob
lems of the Soviet Union's stagnating economy
and sensitive foreign policy and security mat
ters.
Kremlin policies these days are a product of
entrenched interests that are more durable
than any single personality. Brezhnev's success
as leader has hinged on his skills as manager of
the ruling Politburo and as a careful broker.

son for this, other crucial questions are pressing
the Kremlin'saging leaders, including the prob
lems of the Soviet Union's stagnating economy
and sensitive foreign policy and security mat
ters.
Kremlin policies these days are a product of
entrenched interests that are more durable
than any single personality. Brezhnev's success
as leader has hinged on his skills as manager of
the ruling Politburo and as a careful broker.
U.S. seeks peace for Falklands
Washington — U.S. officials sought anxiously
Saturday for ways to forestall a military clash
over the obscure Falkland Islands that might
force this country to choose between a sudden?
ly aroused Britain, its closest global ally, and in
flamed neighbors in South and Central Ameri
ca.
Although it struck many as a cross between a
19th-century melodrama and a Peter Sellers
farce, the British-Argentine struggle was no
laughing matter at the White House and State
Department, where policy makers tokk very se
riously what they see as a threat of war which
may have serious implications for the United
States.
Given the steaming time and readiness of the
British fleet, Washington officials estimated that
they have about two weeks to head off a major
military engagement in the South Atlantic. But
as of now, there is no clear plan within the ad
ministration for averting that collision.
"This isa no-win situation for the United
States," said an official, pointing out that its
close and longstanding "special relationship"
and NATO alliance with Britain would be in a
tug of war with U.S. interests in Latin America
and possibly even its commitments to hemi
spheric defense under the Inter-American
Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, or Rio Treaty.
