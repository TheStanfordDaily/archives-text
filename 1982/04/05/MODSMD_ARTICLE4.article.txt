# Elections committee suggest changes
## Fee assessment vote to be delayed 
### Bill Ainsworth 
An ASSU Election Commisssion
mistake which may change the date
of the fee assessment elections has
caused concern among several
groups that voter turnout will be
below the 20 percent necessary to le
gitimize the elections.
The fee assessment elections, ori
ginally scheduled to take place on
April 14 and 15, will likely be post
poned to April 28 and 29 because of
the failure of the commission to an
nounce the election 14 days in ad
vance in the Daily, according to elec
tion commissioner Eric Laurence.
The elections would then coincide
with the constitutional amendment
elections and the Council of Presi
dents (COP) and Senior Class Presi
dents run-off elections
Laurence said that an official an
nouncement on the status of the
election will not be made until
tomorrow.
The error was discovered last
Thursday, Laurence said. So far no ef
fort has been made to contact the
groups on the fee assessment ballot
about the switch, he added, because
an official decision has not been
reached.
Eric Berg, president of the Gradu
ate Student Association (GSA), said
that his group was "very disturbed"

by the change because it had already
begun its publicity campaign and be
cause he feared that the later elec
tion would not attract the required
percentage of voters needed to make
the election official.
"If there is a lower turnout I'm
going to feel that the ASSU's mis
handling of this will be the cause,"
Berg said.
"I think the ASSU had damn well
better do everything they can to pub
licize the election,"he added.
The switch in the election, accord
ing to Berg, has created some prob
lems for the publicity campaign
planned by the GSA. Berg said that
over 6000 GSA calenders listing the
incorrect election dates have already
been distributed and that a party
planned to coincide with one of the
originally scheduled election dates
of April 14 had been planned to in
crease voter turnout.
Susan Jones, next year's president
of the Speaker's Bureau, said she was
worried about the possible con
fusion the election change might
cause the voters.
Laurence said there were several
benefits in having the fee assessment
elections on the second election. For
one thing, their appearance on the
same ballot as the run-off and the
consitutional amendments would in
crease the turnout for the latter two

issues, he said.
Another advantage of the switch,
according to Laurence, is that elec
tion costs may be lowered. He said
that if the fee assessment elections
were held as planned April 14 and 15
along with the Senate, Senior Class
Presidents and COP elections, an ex
tra page would have to be added to
the ballot. But if the fee assessment
elections are included with the run
offs and the constitutional amend
ments, as is now likely, Laurence said
an additional page would not be nec
essary. This would result in a $500 sav
ing.
However, Laurence said there is
the possibility that the elections will
take place as originally scheduled if it
is found that an announcement was
placed in the Daily's Once Around
the Quad section on or before March
31, but not before the March 10 issue
(because of a constitutional stipu
lation that they not be announced
more than 21 days before the start of
the quarter).
An unofficial check into the
eligible back issues of the Daily
showed no fee assessment election
announcement in Once Around the
Quad. Council of Presidents member
Fred Buhl told the Daily that to his
knowledge the constitutional re
quirement of "official notification"
had not been met.
