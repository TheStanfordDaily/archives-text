# Economist examines arms race

There has been "something ap
proaching a conspiracy of silence"
regarding the way military expen
ditures have contributed to our in
dustrial decline, said noted econo
mist John Kenneth Galbraith to a
packed house in Memorial
Auditorium Friday.
Speaking with the biting wit which
characterizes his books, Galbraith
Mid that the Reagan administration's
analysts, "loosely described as econ
omists," underline the military's con
tracts with private industry as a
positive force in the economy. But
the former president of the Ameri
can Economic Association cautioned
that these contracts only benefit "a
very narrow band of the industrial
sector," that group of companies that
produces the highly specialized
technology used in building weap
ons.
The strength which economists in
Washington proudly point to as a re
sult of the stimulus of increased mili
tary spending has cost domestic in
dustry dearly, according to Galbraith
"Weakness in oder industry is the
counterpart of the distorted strength
of that narrow band of industry that
serves weaponry ... he said. "A
massive transfer of capital away from
private industry," Galbraith said, has
resulted in a corresponding "massive
weakness that today is for all to see."
Holding that America's standing in
the world hierarchy depends on eco
nomic rather than on military
strength, Galbraith compared Amer
ica's economic woes with the fiscal
successes of Germany and Japan.
During the '70s, according to
Galbraith's figures, the United States
spent five percent of its gross na
tional product (GNP) on defense.
Germany spent one-half of their
GNP, he said, Japan one-tenth. With
respect to private investment,
Galbraith said the situation reverses:
Japan invested almost 40 percent of
its GNP in private industry, Germany

almost 30 percent, while the United
States spent only 20 percent.
"Can anyone doubt that it (de
fense spending) has been a cost to
our industrial strength and the power
and eminence that go therewith?,"
the former analyst of strategic bomb
ing asked the audience.
Answering his own question,
Galbraith continued, "The arms race
as it now proceeds, does not
stret\Rthen 'free enterprise' . . . On
the contrary, if there is a large, or as
some idiots imagine, limited, nuclear
exchange, what we call 'free en
terprise' will not survive." He added

this would also hold true for socialist
and communist systems.
The belief that in building up our
nuclear arsenals we defend a politi
cal, economic, and social system
threatens our security more than any
other belief about nuclear arms,
Galbraith said. "Those who say we
should accept the threat of nuclear
war in order to defend an economic
system, in the strongest possible
terms are saying that we should ac
cept . . . destruction," be said.
The Harvard professor stated again
and again that "in the ashes following

a nuclear holocaust" nothing re
sembling an economic system,
whether capitalist, socialist, or com
munist, would survive.
Galbraith pointed to the "shocking
vulnerablity of our interdependent
system" and sketched the following
post-holocaust scenario: no one
would tÂ»e willing to work for money
in the target areas; the government
might try to draft the Teamsters
Union into the armed services but
"this would be s formidable task
even under the best of conditions";
the transportation system would be
come fragmented, cutting off supply
lines to urban populations. At best,
only a medieval standard of living
would be possible. "Free enterprise"
and"the American way of life"
would have no relevance to the"re

sidual survivors of the holocaust," ac
cording to Galbraith.
Galbraith said that to avert the
doom of "free enterprise," the Unit
ed States must coexist with the Soviet
Union, and he emphasized that
Americans and Soviets share a com
mon interest and a common concern
in promoting arms control. He asked
members of the audience who were
willing to take personal responsibility
for blocking the arms race for a show
of hands. He received an overwhelm
ing response.
Galbraith discounted arguments
such as "the Soviets are ahead of us"
and "there is no way to monitor dis
armament, how could we be sure the
Soviets are holding up their end of
the bargain?" He likened the current
arms impasse to this situation: "Think
of a garage with closed doors (and)
six inches of gasoline on the floor.
One of the boys in that garage has six
matches, the other has twelve
matches... Who is more dangerous
to the other?"
