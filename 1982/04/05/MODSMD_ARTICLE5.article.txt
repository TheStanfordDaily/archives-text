There has been "something ap
proaching a conspiracy of silence"
regarding the way military expen
ditures have contributed to our in
dustrial decline, said noted econo
mist John Kenneth Galbraith to a
packed house in Memorial
Auditorium Friday.
Speaking with the biting wit which
characterizes his books, Galbraith
Mid that the Reagan administration's
analysts, "loosely described as econ
omists," underline the military's con
tracts with private industry as a
positive force in the economy. But
the former president of the Ameri
can Economic Association cautioned
that these contracts only benefit "a
very narrow band of the industrial
sector," that group of companies that
produces the highly specialized
technology used in building weap
ons.
The strength which economists in
Washington proudly point to as a re
sult of the stimulus of increased mili
tary spending has cost domestic in
dustry dearly, according to Galbraith
"Weakness in oder industry is the
counterpart of the distorted strength
of that narrow band of industry that
serves weaponry ... he said. "A
massive transfer of capital away from
private industry," Galbraith said, has
resulted in a corresponding "massive
weakness that today is for all to see."
Holding that America's standing in
the world hierarchy depends on eco
nomic rather than on military
strength, Galbraith compared Amer
ica's economic woes with the fiscal
successes of Germany and Japan.
During the '70s, according to
Galbraith's figures, the United States
spent five percent of its gross na
tional product (GNP) on defense.
Germany spent one-half of their
GNP, he said, Japan one-tenth. With
respect to private investment,
Galbraith said the situation reverses:
Japan invested almost 40 percent of
its GNP in private industry, Germany

almost 30 percent, while the United
States spent only 20 percent.
"Can anyone doubt that it (de
fense spending) has been a cost to
our industrial strength and the power
and eminence that go therewith?,"
the former analyst of strategic bomb
ing asked the audience.
Answering his own question,
Galbraith continued, "The arms race
as it now proceeds, does not
stret\Rthen 'free enterprise' . . . On
the contrary, if there is a large, or as
some idiots imagine, limited, nuclear
exchange, what we call 'free en
terprise' will not survive." He added

this would also hold true for socialist
and communist systems.
The belief that in building up our
nuclear arsenals we defend a politi
cal, economic, and social system
threatens our security more than any
other belief about nuclear arms,
Galbraith said. "Those who say we
should accept the threat of nuclear
war in order to defend an economic
system, in the strongest possible
terms are saying that we should ac
cept . . . destruction," be said.
The Harvard professor stated again
and again that "in the ashes following
