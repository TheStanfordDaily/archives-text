# ASSU task force suggests innovations

### Kithy Olmsted Senior staff writer 
Experimental food coupon sys
tems, more self-operating Row
Houses and student awareness pro
grams to reduce food waste were
among the recommendations made
in the preliminary report of an 22
ASSU task force studying University
Food Service issued March 22.
According to task force Chairman
Rod Beckstrom, the task force has
been researching various ways of im
proving food service in the Univer
sity since fall quarter and hopes to
make some additional recommenda
tions in its final report to be released
in May that will result in concrete
changes.
"We hope that the administration
will take a very serious look at the
current food service program and
possibly make some changes in the
way it operates," he said. "We're
concerned that it's not being run
very efficiently."
Beckstrom said the task force com

pared University Food Service (UFS)
with food services at a random sam
ple of other schools nationwide and
that the statistics gathered indicate
that UFS charges higher prices for
food than other universities without
necessarily delivering higher quality.
Beckstrom pointed out that Stan
ford's board charge of $1673 per year
for a 19-meal plan is much higher
than many other universities. Among
the other schools surveyed, the Uni
versity of Nevada-Reno charges $1060
for 20 meals per week, the University
of Miami charges $990 for 20 meals
per week and the University of Ha
waii charges $946 for 19 meals per
week. All of these universities use
private contracting firms to provide
their board service.
According to Beckstrom, the task
force is investigating the causes of
such "large variations in quality and
price" of food and hopes to offer sev
eral major recommendations for im
provements in its final report.
Beckstrom said a main cause of the

high cost of UFS is the amount of
waste involved in an all-you-can-eat
system. The task force estimated that
food waste accounted for $250,000 to
$500,000 of the UFS food budget of
$2.5 million this year.
Beckstrom said one way to correct
this problem would be to implement
a coupon or credit card system in
which students would only pay for
the food they eat. Task force research
has shown that a!l-you-can-eat sys
tems cost $100 to $200 more per year
than coupon systems.
The preliminary report also sug
gested instituting waste awareness
programs and eliminating disposable
dishes.
Another problem with UFS,
Beckstrom said, is the high cost of
maintaining the eight Row Houses
that are currently run by UFS. A task
force study of the Row by Gordon
Hecker estimated that $140,000 per
year is wasted because of inefficient
UFS servicing of the Row Houses.
Beckstrom said the task force

didn't feel it was fair for the six major
dorms to subsidize the costlier Row
House programs.
"We really question the fairness of
that," he said.
Beckstrom said that allowing all the
Row Houses to become self-operat
ing would actually be beneficial to
the residents. He pointed out that the
quarterly cost for a 10-meal plan with
UFS is $470, whereas the average cost
in a self-operating Row House for a
15-meal plan with open-kitchen priv
ileges is $430.
Beckstrom said that the University
administration should allow and per
haps even encourage any Row
Houses that wish to become self-op
erating to do so.
According to Beckstrom, Univer
sity officials are very impressed with
the task force's progress so far and
are "open-minded" about their rec
ommendations for improvements.
"They seemed extremely open to
the idea of implementing changes,"
he said.
