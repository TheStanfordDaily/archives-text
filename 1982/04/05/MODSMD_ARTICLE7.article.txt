## Argentina hastens to establish authority 
### Washington Post 
Buenos Aires, Argentina —
The Argentine government
moved quickly last weekend to
demonstrate firm political con
trol over the Falkland Islands as
signs emerged here that the
military hold might not yet be
secure.
As joyous endorsements of
the bold invasion mounted in
newspapers and among politi
cal and labor leaders, the mili
tary government of Gen.
Leopoldo Galtieri appeared to
have defused a growing wave
of internal opposition that only
four days ago sparked the big
gest protest demonstrations in
the military's six-year-old rule.

Saturday, political leaders
and radio and television com
mentators continued to pro
claim Friday's invasion of the is
land group as "a glorious re
cuperation of national territo
ry." Government officials said
they planned to dispatch a jun
ta yesterday to govern the is
lands and said the Falklands —
known here as the Malvinas —
had become Argentina's 23rd
official province.
Following Argentina's defeat
in the U.N. Security Council,
which passed a resolution call
ing for withdrawal of the force
from the Falklands, the Or
ganization of American States
in Washington announced that

Argentina had called for an
OAS meeting today to hear its
foreign minister.
In moves seemingly de
signed to demonstrate Argen
tina's determination to keep
the territory, held for the last
149 years by Britain, govern
ment officials also said that the
name of the capital of the is
lands had been changed from
Port Stanley to Puerto Rivero —
after an Argentine who defied
the British in the last century —
and that plans for an Argentine
education system were under
way.
Although largely symbolic,
the measures found a growing
wave of political and apparent

popular support for the gov
ernment's actions inside Ar
gentina, where the 4618-
square-mile region of fjords
and bare grasslands has been a
fervent issue of patriotism for
generations. More recently,
evidence that extensive oil de
posits lie between the
Falklands and the mainland h«is
intensified the interest here
and in Britain.
The armed forces action,
which has been rumored here
since January, sparked specula
tion that the government was
attempting to unify popular
support at a time when opposi
tion to the military has been
growing significantly.
"They are doing this to cover
up the political and economic
problems," said a director of a
human rights group. "They
want to show the country as
united — and they have picked
the perfect maneuver because
in Argentina no one can possi
bly oppose retaking the
Malvinas."
Official announcements and
newspaper reports here in
dicated that violence during
seizure of the islands may have
been greater than first re
ported, and that resistance may
have continued Saturday.
The government said Friday
that one officer was killed and

two members of the marine in
vasion force were injured in
the takeover by the 4,500 Ar
gentine troops. It was also
stated that none of the 80 Royal
Marine defenders was hurt as
all were captured. But an eye
witness account published in
the Buenos Aires newspaper
Conviccion Saturday said that
several of the British marines
posted on the large island of
East Falkland had escaped into
the mountainous interior.
In an article by Salvador
Fernandez, who accompanied
the invading Argentine troops,
the paper also reported that
sniper fire in Port Stanley,
whereabout half of the island's
1800 residents live, had lasted
well into the night.
An Argentine Foreign Min
istry spokesman said Saturday
afternoon that the situation
"continued as normal" and
that "there have been no
changes in activity on the is
land." As reports of British
naval movements toward the
Falklands reached Buenos
Aires, however, two hospitals
in the provincial capital of Mar
del Plata, 250 miles southeast of
Buenos Aires, were prepared
to receive military casualties,
and red crosses were painted
on their roofs, according to re
ports from official sources.
