# Close quarters cramp China

### Los Angeles Times 
Peking — A schoolteacher here says that when
she quarrels with her husband, they trade
charges and countercharges in notes passed
back and forth. Otherwise, her mother-in-law,
who lives with them, would intervene.
"If we want to have a good fight, we go out
side," the teacher said, "and then we amuse the
whole neighborhood."
Their situation is not unique. China has an
acute housing shortage and privacy is almost un
known. And that makes for pressure on almost
everyone.
"With one billion people, maybe more, you
are never alone, and everything is known, noth
ing is private or personal," a physician at Pe
king's Capital Hospital complained. "This lack of
privacy and the search for it warp our lives in so
many ways. Some people become obsessed with
being alone, but others are frightened by it and
want to be with others always.
"Life in China is coping with crowdedness."
Privacy is the privilege of the leaders, whose
houses are secluded behind guarded walls. Even
their cars have curtains at the windows. Their
private lives are mentioned only rarely in the
press and then only with their permission.
The general lack of privacy is not new for a
country whose population was already about
275 million in 1750, and it is one reason for the
elaborate courtesies, rituals and traditions China
has developed over its 5000 years.
But rapid population growth, urbanization
and socialism have made the problem increas
ingly acute, and Chinese researchers now see in
it signs of dangerous social pathology.
"Two-thirds of all the cases we get stem from
tho congested living conditions," said Lu
Chiangdi, head of a Shanghai neighborhood

committee that attempts to mediate serious fam
ily and neighborhood quarrels. "When you have
five persons to a room, two or three families to
an apartment, maybe 15,000 persons on the
street, the conflicts multiply."
In China's cities, where 200 million live, an av
erage family has one or two rooms, depending
on family s : ze and availability, that serve for liv
ing, dining and sleeping, as well as a kitchen and
toilet that are shared with one or two neighbors.
The average amount of space is four square
yards per person, according to government fig
ures, but fully one-third of the urban population
has significantly less.
"Housing is No. 1 on everyone's complaint
list," a senior editor of Shanghai's influential
newspaper Wen Hui Bao said. "Of course, that
means everything that comes with housing, par
ticularly privacy."
Dressing and undressing in private, for in
stance, can often be done only by taking turns.
Children often sleep in the same beds with their
parents until they are nearly teen-agers. Sexual
intimacy between husband and wife has to be
carefully arranged. Strict rules have to be de
vised for use of communal facilities, often with
comic results.
Within a family, there are often conflicts
among adults wanting to watch television, stu
dents doing homework and younger children
wanting to go to bed — all in the same two
rooms.
China's crowded conditions also mean there
is little, if any, of what psychologits call "person
al space" — that sensed but undefined area
around a person into which others do not in
trude without apologizing.
