# New housing completion date set back
## 
### Jeff Biddulph 
Rain-caused construction delays and a possible
trade union strike have led University officials to
formulate contingency housing plans for the 180
students who will draw into the three independent
houses scheduled to open in the fall.
Officials are also worrying about a delayed
opening of the 260-person suite complex, which
they plan to unveil next January, according to Jan
Van Houten, director of the new residences.
Opening of the independent houses, which will
be part of the new complex near Lake Lagunita, is
now estimated to be in mid-October, instead of
the previously scheduled Aug. 2 date, said Van
Houten.
The houses may, however, open in September
— in time for the beginning of fall quarter — if
construction is not detained by further rain and if
workers agree to work overtime and on weekends
on the site.
The mid-October opening date is tenuous be
cause trade union workers "are talking of a strike
sometime this summer," according to Van
Houten. The delay of the opening date will vary ac

cording to the time needed for settlement of such
a strike, said Van Houten.
Van Houten and other University officials an
nounced last week the formulation of a "worst
case" plan which would put students who draw
into the houses in Manzanita Trailer Park and 353
Campus Drive (the former residence of the Zeta Psi
fraternity) until construction is finished on the
houses. Under this plan, the 60 people scheduled
to live in the East Asian Studies Theme (EAST)
house would be transferred to the former Zete
house, and the other 120 people would live in
Manzanita.
Because the 260 people who draw into the suites
were scheduled to live in Manzanita until the Janu
ary opening date, only 73 spaces will be open in the
draw for Manzanita, according to Van Houten.
Present residents in the 353 Campus Drive
house, who had been told that they would have re
turning resident priority there next year if the
house was available, will still be given that priority,
but will have to gamble that the independent
houses open on time, according to Van Houten.
She suggested that these residents not list the Zete

house as a choiyior the draw.
Present Zetenouse residents and people who
planned on listing Manzanita as their first choice
will be hurt the most by the delay if the houses do
not open on time, according to Van Houten.
More than 100 people each year list the trailers
as their first choice, Van Houten said. "Given that
there will only be 73 spaces, some of these people
will be disappointed."
A great deal of what Van Houten calls "student
juggling" will take place inside Manzanita as well.
If the opening of the independent houses is de
layed less than a month, the residents will be
moved into them from Manzanita and 353 Campus
Drive. If the opening is delayed more than a
month, the residents will be given the opportunity
to move into the house®, but Van Houten said she
expects that many students may be settled into
their residences by then and would prefer not to
leave.
If the students do move, however, the spaces
will be available to "walk-in" students who want to
live there.
