# Do you know... what a linear accelerator really is?
## 
### 
Reading about the linear
accelerator here, what have
you imagined — something
like the Bonneville speed
way, or a huge building with
heaven-knows what inside?
The Stanford Linear Cen
ter (SLAC) is indeed a two
mile long building. Inside,
scientists spend their time
demolishing atoms.
To obtain the smaller
pieces in atoms, scientists
once had to go high into the
atmosphere. There, cosmic
beams (pieces of atoms
speeding through space)
enter the atmosphere and

occasionally collide with at
mospheric atoms. The paths
of the resulting debris gave
information about the
smaller parts of atoms. How
ever, scientists grew weary
of days on mountain tops
and sought to bring the ef
fect of cosmic rays down to a
more convenient location.
In the linear accelerator,
electrons, the most readily
available particle, are in
troduced into one end of a
copper pipe four inches
wide and two miles long. Ev
ery 10 feet, a large dose of
electricity is pumped into

the tube.
After two miles, an elec
tron is speeding like a cos
mic particle ray, and it
smashes into and breaks
apart atoms at the end of the
tube.
Do you know? is a new
weekly feature of the Daily's
science page designed to
present simple explahations
of scientific and technolog
ical phenomena. Today's
piece was written by Julie
Kiser, and information was
obtained from Doug Dupin
at SLAC. j
