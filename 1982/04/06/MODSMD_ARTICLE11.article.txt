be slaughtered as such.
Then he asked me if I could
send him a gun when I re
turned to California! I re
sponded affirmatively, hop
ing he wouldn't use the
knife on me. My eyes stud
ied the remains of what was
once the bar and I tried to
cut the conversation. The
atmosphere was quite vi
olent — VIVA ANARCHIAI
NEO-FASCISM, etc, were
painted on the walls. I pan
icked.
The old man continued
his one-sided conservation.
I offered a nod here and
there. While he spoke an
argument took place be
tween a young, very punk
woman and one of the other
male squatters. They both
seemed stoned. I don't ex
actly what they were fight
ing about, and I'm not quite
sure they did either. How
ever, both were determined
to win.
Suddenly the woman
broke a glass on the edge of
the bar and started swiping
the air, barely missing the
man's face. She started

toward others sitting
around the room, also bare
ly missing their bodies. I was
on the edge of the seat,
ready to make a dash for the
door. Luckily the man left,
the woman won the argu
ment, and all was peaceful.
Realizing Macky wasn't
going to return in the near
future, I decided to go
home. As I picked up my
bag and said goodbye to the
old man, he grabbed my
arm and insisted that I sleep
upstairs until Macky came.
Since he still had his
switchblade in hand I wasn't
about to argue with him, I
let him show me to the up
stairs "chambers!" We
climbed a flight of rotten
stairs, passed through some
broken doors, and finally ar
rived at Macky's room.
It seemed that these
squatters hadn't even tried
to fix the place up, which I
thought was the goal of the
whole squatting movement.
The walls were shabby and
the floors a mess. Cobwebs
kept the ceiling company,
roaches kep the occupiers
company, dust kept ev
erything company. When
"toothless" left me alone
and went back downstairs, I

snooped around the other
rooms and found them no
better.
"Disgusting," I thought,
and spread my sleeping bag
out on a mattress and tried
to sleep. (It was hard.
Thoughts of the police,
knives, and broken glass
danced in my head.) '
When I woke up in the
morning I found no Macky,
so I got dressed, stuffed my
sleeping bag, and snuck out
a back door. An interesting
experience, but not one I
would recommend to any
normally intelligent person.
I'm sure there are heroes
out there somewhere, fight
ing for the right cause and
trying to boost the humanity
in this world. In an ex
perience like mine, how
ever, all the heroes turn into
vidians, the fighting seems
useless, and the cause seems
to be forgotten.

be slaughtered as such.
Then he asked me if I could
send him a gun when I re
turned to California! I re
sponded affirmatively, hop
ing he wouldn't use the
knife on me. My eyes stud
ied the remains of what was
once the bar and I tried to
cut the conversation. The
atmosphere was quite vi
olent — VIVA ANARCHIAI
NEO-FASCISM, etc, were
painted on the walls. I pan
icked.
The old man continued
his one-sided conservation.
I offered a nod here and
there. While he spoke an
argument took place be
tween a young, very punk
woman and one of the other
male squatters. They both
seemed stoned. I don't ex
actly what they were fight
ing about, and I'm not quite
sure they did either. How
ever, both were determined
to win.
Suddenly the woman
broke a glass on the edge of
the bar and started swiping
the air, barely missing the
man's face. She started

toward others sitting
around the room, also bare
ly missing their bodies. I was
on the edge of the seat,
ready to make a dash for the
door. Luckily the man left,
the woman won the argu
ment, and all was peaceful.
Realizing Macky wasn't
going to return in the near
future, I decided to go
home. As I picked up my
bag and said goodbye to the
old man, he grabbed my
arm and insisted that I sleep
upstairs until Macky came.
Since he still had his
switchblade in hand I wasn't
about to argue with him, I
let him show me to the up
stairs "chambers!" We
climbed a flight of rotten
stairs, passed through some
broken doors, and finally ar
rived at Macky's room.
It seemed that these
squatters hadn't even tried
to fix the place up, which I
thought was the goal of the
whole squatting movement.
The walls were shabby and
the floors a mess. Cobwebs
kept the ceiling company,
roaches kep the occupiers
company, dust kept ev
erything company. When
"toothless" left me alone
and went back downstairs, I

snooped around the other
rooms and found them no
better.
"Disgusting," I thought,
and spread my sleeping bag
out on a mattress and tried
to sleep. (It was hard.
Thoughts of the police,
knives, and broken glass
danced in my head.) '
When I woke up in the
morning I found no Macky,
so I got dressed, stuffed my
sleeping bag, and snuck out
a back door. An interesting
experience, but not one I
would recommend to any
normally intelligent person.
I'm sure there are heroes
out there somewhere, fight
ing for the right cause and
trying to boost the humanity
in this world. In an ex
perience like mine, how
ever, all the heroes turn into
vidians, the fighting seems
useless, and the cause seems
to be forgotten.
