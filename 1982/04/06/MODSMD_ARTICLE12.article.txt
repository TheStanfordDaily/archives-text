# Booking Overseas!
## impressions of the trip over... 
### William Ellis 
"Italy. Oh my God you're so luckyl I'm
sure you'll have the best time. I'm so ex
cited for you."
Everybody told me that. So, now I feel
obliged to have that good time they've
forced on me. But when you peel your
head off the pillow at 9 a.m. New Year's
Day, just two hours after going to bed, it is
hard to be excited. I am not excited about
the train trip to Baltimore ($32 one way
from New York, a city six times larger and
also my home) or about having to wait 20
minutes for a cab in a city with more cabs
than cockroaches, or about the cold rain
washing my feet through the holes in my
sneakers while my umbrella sleeps sound
ly, deep and snug inside my suitcase.
Once in Baltimore I met up with many of
the other chosen few. Dragging
backpacks, duffles, suitcases and yes, even
disassembled bicycles, we could not not
know that this would be the very easiest
leg of our trip.
For me six hours, for the West Coasters
11 hours, after taking off, we touch down
in cloudy Frankfort (it's cheaper than
flying into Rome). Dirty, tired and severely
jet-lagged (It's now 7:05 a.m. in Franfort,
which is 2:05 a.m. in the east and 11:05 p.m.
in California), we drag ourselves out of the
plane and into the terminal.
And what's when it hit us.
"So this is Frankfort," someone de
clared. The smiles, like a plague, spread
throughout the group. We can feel the
thrill creep into our bodies with each
breath of Frankfurtian air.
Someone said, "I can't believe it," an
other said something else equally pro
found but we all eagerly nod and smile in
agreement like little kids offered candy.
You see, it is not until you actually step
on foreign ground, hear many foreign
voices, breath foreign air and even ask
where your baggage is (Wo ist mienem
gepack?) that you finally realize why ev
eryone else is so excited for you. Before,
the words "Overseas Studies" just meant a
vacation for credit; something for a
change of pace. And even though Frank
fort is filled with U.S. Army and is dirty and
much less nice than most American cities,
it is still so completely different; your
aperture to the world is so immediately
widened that nothing can be taken for
granted.
It is a terrific place to drop down into af
ter experiencing the American magic of

Christmas and New Year's. (What I'm
saying is, don't worry if your charter leaves
you a few train rides from your campus be
cause it will be one of your first of many
"Overseas Learning Experiences" (OLEs)
that you'll hear so much about.)
As for us, we spent the night in Fra.k
fort, just two blocks away from the red
light district and "Dr. Muller's" — a two
story high and one block long — "sex
shop." Fortunately, the owner of the hotel
is from Upstate New York and chaperoned
us away from this neighborhood to the
city's old section (Sachenhausen) where all
the non-sex nightlife is. Some of us hear
John Coltrane jazz played by thin, tall and
smiling aryans while others disco to AC
DC and Genesis.
The next morning, we get up at 6 a.m. (1
a.m. EST, and 10 p.m. PST) to catch the 7:30
train for Milan where we'll then have to
change for the Florence train.
You have to ride a train through the Alps
before you die. It's impossible to be any
thing but awestruck. All the old little cot
tages, each roof draped with knee-deep
snow and the mountains upon mountains
forever sprouting up ahead as jagged as
broken glass, keep your mouth always half
open in wonder.
Next to the train one cross-country
skiier rhythmically shushes towards the
next village pumping out puffs of breath
with each swing of his arms and slide of his
skis.
The Milan train station is hardly pic
turesque but still awfully exciting. Ex
pecially with 10 minutes and a shaky con
trol of the language it is particularly fun to
scurry from one conductor to the other,
desperately trying to find your train.
"Binario sette, ma ... " (track seven,
someone tells us as we rush off like a flock
of wounded ducks trying to flap our lame
baggage. The amused Milanese simply
look on and laugh.
Once on the train we find that it does
not have room for all of us so those that
were fast enough to get on first are kicked
off by a mean faced capotreno (conduc
tor). Many of us are now dragging our suit
cases on the ground while the people in
the train we should have been on wave us
goodbye (Ciao American'!l)
Another Florence-bound train comes
but this time we have a plan. Some go in
side first while the others quickly smuggle
all the luggage in through the windows.
We find a whole slew of empty cars (What

luck!) and just begin to settle in when a
capotreno leaps at us and yells "Us cite per
corteuel" (Get out please!)
It seems we have stumbled upon the re
served sleeper cars to once more slug our
bags through the tiny train corridors
squashing old ladies (Permesso!) and
knocking young children unconscious
(Oh/ Mi displace!). Fortunately we meet
some incredibly nice people in first class
who take pity and let us stay with them.
Caterina is 11-years-old but acts 20. She
falls in love with one of our football players
squealing "Gigante gorilla, gigante
gorilla!," as she stares at him and bats her
eyes. Talking to her is great because she
lets us speak slowly and does not get tired
of telling us what we are trying to say.
And her mother, father and the other
Italians there are also very friendly and pa
tient with our never-ending questions of
where they are from (Dove abitaf), what is
their name (Come si chiamaf) and how old
are they (Quanti anni ha?) Those simple lit
tle questions are the first phrases we
learned back in the good old Quad and we
say them constantly, staying as near to
those words as Linus to his blanket.
By Bologna our entire car is abuzz with
action. Groups of us are chatting with Ital
ians from Rome, Palermo, Calabria and
Florence passing around the spumonti
(sparkling wine) and panettone (fruitcake)
as the capotreno grimly squeezes by one
his way to less lively compartments.
At 11:30 p.m. we pull into Florence. Ev
eryone is exhausted but, again, smiling. A
charter bus (after walking, taxiing, flying,
bussing, training and walking) takes us out
of downtown Florence to the via del
Salviatino. Soon, a breathtaking mansion
rises high upon a hill completely lit upand
shining.
We wind up the driveway passing many
statues of Greeks in long drapery next to
sculpted trees and bushes. We reach the
villa itself and everyone "ooh's" at its huge
stone facade as if a firework had just ex
ploded. Inside, we see a massive stone
stairway climbing up four stories under a
stained glass skylight.
We all sleep easily with the satisfaction
of the truly exhausted.
In the morning, I look out my 15-foot
high window into downtown Florence. At
noon, churchbells sound, covering up the
low rumble of kamikazi Fiats.
Through red tile roofs are everywhere,
visions of Stanford are not in my mind.
