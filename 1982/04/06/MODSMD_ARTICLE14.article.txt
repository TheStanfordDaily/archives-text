# Greetings from Vienna
## 
### Susie Foels 
Bundled up in a warm coat,
scarf and snow boots, the stu
dent stood behind the counter
of a Viennese grocery store.
Silently cursing the clerk who
tried not to smile at his feeble
command of the German lan
guage while requesting his
groceries, he wonders why he
had not gone to Cliveden
where there were no language
barriers.
Another adventure may fol
low as he boards the Strassen
bahn or streetcar. Chances are,
one of Vienna's many elderly
women will hit his bag of gro
ceries as she elbows her way
into the crowded car and then
yells at the unsuspecting stu
dent. For the first time he will
appreciate not being able to
understand the Viennese
dialect.
The language barrier is the
most frustrating as well as the
most challenging factor of life
in Vienna. However, when a
successful conversation has
taken place between onelself
and a Viennese there is a great
feeling of accomplishment.
Most students involved in
the Vienna program have Aus
trian roommates and the lim

ited vocabulary slows down the
progress of a developing
friendship. Yet this struggle
and the shared insecurities of
both students provide a feeling
of closeness and serve as the
best beginning for one to
speak German as often as pos
sible. With a Cuten Morgen
one begins the day in Vienna!
One of the most rewarding
experiences for many students
is visiting their Austrian fami
lies once or twice a week. A
home-cooked meal is often a
part of the evening which is a
blessing for students who sub
sist mainly on bread, cheese,
pastries and coffee. These visits
also give an insight to the
homelife of the Austrians.
After a few hours the relax
ing atmosphere of a home
makes communicating in Ger
man much easier and more
pleasureable. The ride home
on the Strassenbahn and the
walk from the stop to one's
dorm completes an adven
turous day. The streets of Vien
na are safe and women can
walk freely and unescorted.
This is unique to Vienna and
one of its most appreciated
characteristics for Stanford stu
dents.
