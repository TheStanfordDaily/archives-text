# Whiling away afternoon hours in Demel's Cafe
## 
### Stephanie Sandberg 
Demel's Cafe. Try to make the cof
fee last. Gilded mirrors send images
of the wealthy and the exotic bounc
ing away into infinity, while picture
book waitresses bustle by in a prac
ticed air of black and white efficien
cy. Reflections bounce off a stun
ning array of dishes and pastries; the
colorless woman presiding pushes
me mercilessly to a decision.
I clear my throat and change my
mind in mid-sentence: "Diese
Linzer Torte . . . uh, nein,
Milchraumstrudel, bitte." The sur
rounding tables are alive with the
chatter of foreign tongues, tittering
laughter punctuated by a toss of a
head, a flash of gold and diamond.
"American Express," "Visa,"
"Diner's Club," screams the front
door.
But this is not the true Vienna. A
more accurate Vienna is outside the
door and to the right, where the
gates of the Hofburg Palace provide
a tarnished reminder of Habsburg
greatness. Vienna is a city with a past.
And like all old European cities, it
points proudly to its crucial historical
role in Western civilization.
Unlike other European cities, Vi
enna lives on its past, clinging to it
with a fierceness that makes it slow
to admit to its post-World War I sta
tus as the capital of Austria — a small,

charming country of quaint Europe
an beauty.
Vienna is a city, Austria a country,
and ne'er the twain shall meet. The
older set — of which Vienna primari
ly consists — remembers when to
day's "Austria" was just one fraction
of a monarchy that ecompassed
most of eastern Europe as well.
"My family is Czechoslavakian,"
boasted a man from an Eastern wine
growing province who had taken
three weary travellers into his hospi
table kitchen (then into his wine,
then the family albums and the letter
he had written to Henry Ford, com
paring family genes... ). "We/n —
ach, it is too big, too stuffy, the peo
ple unfriendly."
The Viennese are unquestionably
a different set. They sniff at this
Czech's barbaric provinciality and
take a stroll along the Graben to gaze
into beautiful store windows and re
assure themselves of their city's cos
mopolitan superiority. The Opera
house, the Parliament, City Hall and
the university are all remnants of an
energetic and long-lasting emperor
struggling to keep reign on some 12
nationalities from one imperial seat.
But beloved as Franz josef was, in
grizzled mutton-chops and jowels
that make Richard Nixon look like
Sophia Loren, he and his monarchy
fell the inevitable way of such great

ness: without convincing. The inner
city's grandeur echoes with those
Grand Old Ways, and the proud set
jaw of legions of Viennese widows
remain to remind us of the trans
formation the city has undergone.
What is Vienna today? It is not a
"young person's" city. The average
age is 60. There exists no real "hap
pening" place, unless one counts
McDonalds or the U-Bahn (metro),
where punk teenagers glory in safe
ty-pin rebellion. After a group con
sultation on the English, they ven
ture an expected cat-call: "Hellooo
tare!"
This is a rare utterance giving voice
to thousands of silent stares. That
Americans are an oddity, we are nev
er allowed to forget. We have grown
accustomed to being the star attrac
tions of any public situation, as the
Viennese — reserved by nature,
cadaverous in the streetcar —
bounce silently home. Warming to
our roles, we begin to discuss them
as if they were all encased in glass,
and we, spectators.
"Hey Em, Look at that lady sitting
across from you in the navy loden.
Doesn't her fuzzy hat make her
look like a stuffed insect?"
We shouldn't be fooled. The Vien
nese come alive given their ele
ments, which are various. One ob
vious element is music. Where else

but Vienna can students and other
non-spenders buy standing room for
world-renowned state symphony
and opera performances for next to
nothing? And see an usher suddenly
brandish an earmarked score to fol
low eagerly with his flashlight, strains
of Wagner carrying him far from his
uniformed role as Usher Schmidt?
This love for music penetrates to
all levels of Viennese society — even
to the supposed spiritual tranquility
of a century-old church. The Catho
lic word is revealed with an especial
ly penetrating force each Sunday, via
nationally subsidized orchestral
groups sending strains of Mozart,
Haydn, Bach, and Strauss from the
celestial heights of the organ plat
form.
It is a strange feeling to settle into a
pew at St. Augustine's, let my eye
traverse the ribbed vaulting of
Gothic splendor, and hear the vio
lins tune up while the alter boy lights
the candles.
Coffee. Or rather, coffeehouses,
which are the element of themselves
presenting the best spectrum of Vi
ennese society. The most interesting
are the "intellectual" gathering
spots which present the younger set
and the leftover longhairs, who
search for seats and sympathy with
today's non-conformists. Cafe
