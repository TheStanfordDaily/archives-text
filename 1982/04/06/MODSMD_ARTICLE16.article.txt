## Editorial Shifted election hurts all 
### 
Right now, the fee assessment election —
through which campus groups receive a
significant portion of their funding — is
scheduled for April 28 and 29. But the dates of
the election have fluctuated wildly:
• April 14 and 15 (These are the original dates —
the same as ASSU Senate elections — promised
by ASSU officials throughout March).
• "Sometime later, with the constitutional
elections" (According to a COP member on
April 1 — after the deadline).
• May 4 and 5 (According to the ASSU financial
manager at 1 p.m. on April 2).
• April 28 and 29 (According to a leading senator
at 3:15 p.m. on April 2).
• "Probably with the senatorial elections" April
14 and 15 (According to a COP member April 4).
• April 28 and 29 (According to the elections
commissioner yesterday).
The election dates have varied because the
ASSU did not meet its own constitutional
mandate to give the necessary advance notice to
allow the April 14 and 15 fee assessment
election.
The COP, spnatp and financial manager blame

this fiasco on the elections commissioner, who
in turn blames another ASSU officer. Finger
pointing is rampant in the ASSU offices, but the
election date changes have disrupted many
groups' publicity and campaigning plans
designed to gather support for their ballot
measure and to increase election participation.
More important, the change in the election
date makes gathering the votes of 20 percent of
the student body more difficult for each group
seeking a fee assessment.
This is not just a matter of student council
politics. The changes jeopardize several
hundred thousand dollars of funding for at least
14 groups representing students in different
activities throughout campus.
The damage has been done, but we hope the
ASSU will take extraordinary measures to
publicize the second election, to add additional
voting booths and to ensure adequate turnout.
We hope, too, that groups seeking fee
assessments publicize the election and, above
all else, that students vote to support groups
they feel are worthy.
