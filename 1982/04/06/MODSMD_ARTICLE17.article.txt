## Closing minds to conflicting views 
### 
A friend of mine recently told me,
"You can't have discussions at Stan
ford. You can have arguments but no
discussions." I thought she was being
a bit extreme, but I was intrigued so I
asked her why she thought that was.
"Because there is nothing to dis
cuss. Everyone is so smart that they al
ready know everything and if you
disagree with them, you're wrong.
And that's that."
I started to think of my own ex
periences with discussions that had
ended abruptly with, "You're
wrong," and I realized one of the
reasons discussions here are often
unenlightening or nonexistent is be
cause many students believe that
either you agree with them or you
are mentally incompetent and thus
not worth talking to. After all, how
can anyone disagree with the
brightest students in the country?
My friend continued, "Have you
tried to discuss the flaws of the wom
en's movement with a radical
feminist? Good luck. They won't lis
ten â€” their minds are closed."
The issue of closed-minded stu
dents struck me. After all, we attend a
university whose function is to teach
critical analysis, which by definition
must involve critical analysis, which
by definition must involve conflict
and discussion. Yet, many students
are often more interested in rein
forcement than illumination.
Some believe what they want and
protect those beliefs by seeing out of
only one eye while shutting the other
tightly. This vision is reinforced by
reading books and periodicals that
will naturally concur with one's pre
established beliefs. Why should a lib
eral bother to read William Buckley
when all liberals know Buckley is
always wrong? Or similarly, why
should a conservative student waste
time at a lecture on feminism when
conservatives know the movement is
wrong-headed? It is wiser, the argu
ment goes, to spend one's time on
material that expounds truth not
falsity. That catch, however, is that
the determinant of what is "truth" is
one's personal beliefs.
A good example of a closed

minded student body was displayed
at the Catherine MacKinnon-Phyllis
Schlafly debate (or, for that matter
just about any lecture on campus).
Schlafly could have presented
thousands of pages of irrefutable
documentation to support her argu
ments without converting a soul. No
one went to that debate to hear what
either of the women had to say, they
went to heckle Schlafly.
And the same can be said about the
recent lectures by National Security
Advisor Richard Allen and Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger. At
the Allen speech I sat behind a stu
dent who shook his head in disap
proval after every fourth word as if to
indicate the student was better in
formed about U.S. policy than Allen.
But by the student's behavior I would
say that is doubtful.
It seems that students go to lec
tures not to listen, but to hiss or to
clap. And the student goes to the lec
ture already knowing whether he will
hiss or clap. Ironically, this attitude
closely parallels the attitude of the
leaders in Vietnam who blinded
themselves from the truth because
they feared the truth. They, like many
students, selectively relied on in
formation that coincided with their
desires, and conveniently ignored
the conflicting data. It is merely an
other form of self-deception.
The students' attitude is, in part,
further reinforced by professors who
are intent on teaching their opinion
about an issue rather than a true
analysis of the issue. This is easily ac
complished by slanting lectures and
reading to ensure that one's personal
viewpoint is best represented. Many
professors do purport to do justice to
both sides, but it is hardly adequate
when the literature and analysis of
one side is purposefully inferior.
Of course, the desire for others to
agree with you is a natural one. Nev
ertheless, proper attention to con
flicting evidence and other views
must not be sacrificed by the desire
to fit issues to ideologies. In a very
dangerous way, by fastening oneself
to a label, like "liberal" or "conserva
tive," one's ideology mistakenly

comes before the facts, and often be
comes inflexible in spite of the facts.
However, to know only one side is
to know nothing, and it leads to argu
ments in which students pit ig
norance against ignorance. Hardly
time well spent. If one is to have a
true belief, it is important to explore
and to know all sides of the issue.
Without rational discussion, beliefs
rest on passions and doctrines, and in
John Stuart Mill's words, are only
"half-truths." And that, it seems, de
feats the purpose of education which
must be to teach students to think
and to analyze critically.
What is more ironic is that his
torically most great achievements
have been the result of doubt and
disagreement. Where would we all
be today if Christopher Columbus
had not doubted, or if Americans had
not disagreed with the White House
during the Vietnam War? On the oth
er hand, inflexible ideologies have
never led to anything but wars and
senseless arguments.
Thus, the closed-minded student is
acting contrary to what is essential for
our lives. As historian Kenneth Ken
niston confirms, "There is much cur
rent evidence that individuals who
attain high levels of complexity in
thinking and judging do so as a result
of conflict not in its absence."
It is especially important that we as
students, in order to maximize our
educational experience, seek con
flict not agreement. It is always easy
to find someone to agree with you,
but simply because two people, or
100, agree does not mean that is the
truth. The real test of truth is why
people believe what they do. And if
no satisfactory answer can be pro
vided, something is wrong. And cer
tainly any satisfactory answer must
include an awareness of all sides of an
issue.
Thomas Wolfe wrote, "The es
sence of belief is doubt, the essence
of reality is questioning." To know,
we must first doubt, and to under
stand we must question. And then
maybe we can prove rny friend
wrong.
