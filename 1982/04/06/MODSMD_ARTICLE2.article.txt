Claiming that citizens tend to be
more politically active in prosperous
times than when the economy is in
bad shape, consumer advocate Ralph
Nader yesterday urged students here
to look beyond their immediate con

day, rather than the citizens."
He opposed this form of corporate
stranglehold in other areas of daily

and utilities.
Nader also had no kind comments
for the American two-party system,
saying, "I think (it) has got to be re

tweedle-dee." Further, he said,
