### 
Claiming that citizens tend to be
more politically active in prosperous
times than when the economy is in
bad shape, consumer advocate Ralph
Nader yesterday urged students here
to look beyond their immediate con
cerns to regain their political power.
"People who don't participate in a
democracy don't get represented/'
said Nader in an interview, adding
that he believes "citizens are always
more progressive than their leaders"
anyway. He also said there are far
more public-interest positions avail
able "for students to become In
volved with than student interest will
fill." The problem, Nader said, "is
that most students are not willing to
take a cut in their summmer wages."
Nader, probably the country's
best-known "consumer advocate,"
had some particularly harsh words
for the audiovisual media, saying,
"Our television programming right

now is 90 percent entertainment, 10
percent news, and 0 percent
mobilization. The corporations con
trol what goes on the air 24 hours a
day, rather than the citizens."
He opposed this form of corporate
stranglehold in other areas of daily
life as well, maintaining that "Exxon's
biggest weapon against the people is
people believing that they can't beat
Exxon...
"You go to bed at night and wake
up in the morning thinking corpo
rate," said Nader. He called for the
formation of '''citizen's organiza
tions" to control concerns such as
the news media, energy companies
and utilities.
Nader also had no kind comments
for the American two-party system,
saying, "I think (it) has got to be re
placed. It's like tweedla-dum and
tweedle-dee." Further, he said,
"There's nothing structurally oppos
ing (the viability of) a third party."
Nader called the Reagan adminis
tration "the worst" in terms of its re
sponsiveness to consumer issues. The
administration represents a "violent,
extremist brand of Republicanism,"
according to Nader.
Nader called for students to work
for the Californa and local branches
of the Public Interest Research
Groups (PIRGs), which he helped
found. Admitting that PIRG "hasn't
caught on at Stanford," Nader pre

dieted that the group's popularity
would increase as students begin
fully to realize the magnitude of
budget cuts and reallocations pro
posed by the Reagan administration
and to look for alternative solutions.
Nader expressed much ap
prehension about socialist theories
of governmental reform: "In
escapably they're going to crush cor
porate power by building up govern
ment power/' he said.
Finally, Nader urged students to
join together to fight for their com
mon concerns. "There is just not
enough thinking on campus about
students as a community."
