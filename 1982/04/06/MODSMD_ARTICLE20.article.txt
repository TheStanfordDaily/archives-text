# Booby prize for nuclear radiation

### 
It is becoming obvious, with each
passing day, that the American peple
are awakening to the dangers of nu
clear war. People in all walks of life,
from physicians to high school stu
dents, from housewives to health
physicists, are coming to see that, in
the words of Helen Caldicott, nucle
ar war would be not war but annihila
tion. There can be no civil defense
against a thermonuclear weapon that
requires a bomb the size of the one
used on Hiroshima merely to set it
off, to act as a trigger or detonator.
If the multiple warhead missiles
ever fly, both we and the Soviets will
be charcoal-broiled and our lands
will be uninhabitable for many gen
erations. Even to talk of civil defense
against such instruments of mass de
struction is to fall prey to a dangerous
illusion. There will be no cure for nu
clear war: the only cure is preven
tion.
What is not as obvious to many
Americans is that the nuclear tech
nology whose full-scale adoption we
are now debating is similarly an
abomination. To put it simply, this
technology is not safe; it poses a
threat to us, to our children and to
our distant descendents.
There are really four elements to
the problem ofthe nuclear technolo
gy. The first is how much radioactive
poison is produced by the reactors;
there is no disagreement on that. The
second is how toxic the radioactive
poisons are; there is little disagree
ment on that. The third is how much
of the radioactive poisons are going
to get into the environment, and ul
timately into human beings, by es
caping during all phases of the nucle
ar fuel cycle, from mining uranium
ore to handling the used fuel.
The fourth question is how much
of the radioactive poison is going to
get to people by escaping from some
hypothetical "permanent" storage
place before it has decayed to harm
lessness; complete separation from
the biosphere is required for periods
ranging from 600 to more than

250,000 years, depending on which
particular mixture of radionuclides is
used in the reactor core.
These facts about radiation are not
under debate: the decay products of
a nuclear reactor, which include
plutonium, strontium-90, iodine-131
and cesium-137, are deadly
carcinogens. Plutonium has a half life
of 24,400 years. That means it's not
safe for half a million years. And it's
not biodegradable; once you have it
you can't get rid of it.
It is a silent killer; you don't know
you've breathed it into your lungs.
You can't smell it, taste it or see it.
And you feel healthy for 15, 20 or 30
years until one day you develop lung
cancer. It often takes years for cancer
to manifest itself following exposure
to radioactive carcinogens. If this

The key question is:
to what extent can the
nuclear industry
contain these
carcinogens and keep
them completely
separate from the
environment in the
time that it takes for
them to decay to
harmlessness?

frightens you, it is not my desire to do
so, but these are the medical realities
you need to be aware of when think
ing about nuclear power.
The reason you need to be aware
of these realities is because of the
problem of the complete fuel cycle
in nuclear energy producing plants
and of storage and isolation from the
biosphere. The operation of nuclear
reactors generates astronomical
quantities of radioactive garbage.
In one year of operation, a single
1000 megawatt nuclear power plant
generates fission products (like
strontium-90 and cesium-137d) in a
quantity equal to what is produced
by the explosion of 23 megatons of
nuclear fission bombs, or more than
1000 bombs of the Hiroshima size
(Gofman, J.W., "The Fission-Product
Equivalence between Nuclear Reac
tors and Nuclear Weapons," in The

Congressional Record July 8, 1971 ).
If the advocates of nuclear power
prevail, there will be hundreds of nu
clear power plants dotting the Amer
ican landscape in the coming dec
ades.
The key question is: to what extent
can the nuclear industry contain
these carcinogens and keep them
completely separate from the en
vironment in the time that it takes for
them to decay to harmlessnessP This
is fundamental because the ultimate
size of the epidemic of cancers which
nuclear power could cause depends
on the size of the radiation dose
which will be received by the public
from nuclear pollution in the course
of a nuclear energy economy.
Dr. John Gofman, professor emer
itus of medical physics at U.C.
Berkeley, former associate director
of Livermore Lab and author of mor6
than 150 scientific papers dealing
with such topics as the relationship of
human chromosomes to cancer, has
said the following: "The dream
world in which the fraction (of radio
active poisons) released is zero exists
only in the imagination of nuclear
promoters inside and outside the
government. All other people have
to live in the real world. Thus, nuclear
energy represents history's grandest
experiment in containment. The ext
perimental subjects are all the hu
mans on earth. The booby prize for
failure in perfect containment of the
radioactivity, is a public health dis?
aster which will make even current
cancer fatalities appear trivial. And
the grand prize for success is a little
energy which can be better obtained
by other means at lower cost, by
means which are available to us if we
choose to use them."
We have already had fore*
shadowings of what a nuclear dis
aster is like. A woman who lived near
Three Mile Island wrote: "The idea
of us as well as thousands of others
being refugees of the nuclear in
dustry angered, saddened and sick
ened us. We found and still find the
whole incident emotionally devas
tating, and the scars have been in
scribed permanently on our minds."
If I had my way, her words would be
the requiem for nuclear power in
America.
