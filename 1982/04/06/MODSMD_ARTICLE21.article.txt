## Report on NCAA championships shortchanges swim team 
### 
After reading the Daily's report of the
NCAA Swimming Championships
(March 29), I became extremely frus
trated with the negative and in
complete job of covering the meet.
The article began by stating "Both
men's and women's swim teams fell
short against NCAA foes in their re
spective championships ... Coach
Skip Kenney and his men's team suf
fered a defeat much harder to swal
low."
What the Daily failied to write was
that this was the highest finish for
Stanford in more than a decade (and
it was also Stanford's pre-season
ranking.) Stanford went from 16th to
10th to ninth and third in the last four
years. The writer failed to realize
what the rest of the nation realizes:
Stanford's men's swim team has shot
up to the ranks of a national pow
erhouse in a phenominally short
time, and next year will probably be
the favorite to win the NCAA Cham
pionships.
The reporter also failed to note
that Kenney was voted NCAA coach
of the year for leading the Cardinal to
its first Pac-10 Championship. Are
these achievements truly a "defeat"
that is hard to swallow? Certainly notl
Instead of writing that "the
Cardinal came up with too little, too
late," the Daily should have noted
that the Cardinal men's swim team
had one of the highest percetages of
swimmers at NCAA's placing into the
finals of all the teams at the meet. It is
truly amazing that with only 15 swim

mers qualified for the meet, mostly
freshmen and sophomores, the
Cardinal was even a challenger for
the national title. The Cardinal re
turned from the meet with 14 of 15
swimmers ranking as All-Americans.
All of these sucesses were ignored
by the negative remarks about the
meet in the tiny article stuck in the
back of the Sports section. The NCAA
swimming championships were ac
tually the culmination of one of the
greatest seasons for Stanford men's
swimming ever. It seems sad that in
reporting on this meet and others
throughout the year, the Stanford
Daily is the last newspaper to realize
the talent, spirit and excellence in its
own backyard.

bophomore, undeclared
Renoir coffee ad Insults
I am writing to protest the nature
of the General Foods International
Coffees advertisement which ap
peared as an insert in yesterday's
Daily. This is an abuse and an
adulteration of Renoir's masterpiece,
and I feel that it should not go un
noticed.
In my mind's eye, to deface "The
Luncheon of the Boating Party" by
inserting a tin of General Foods
Amaretto Coffee, a coffee pot, and
two cups is to insult the integrity of
the painter's work. I would even say
that those who view this artist's work
seriously might interpret the ad as a

mockery. The fact that the reproduc
tion is of museum poster quality
merely serves to accentuate the
grossness of this exploitation, as well
as to underscore the dollar magni
tude of this advertising campaign.
In addition to yesterday's insert,
other coffee ads run by General
Foods in the Daily have unilaterally
depicted college women as future
elitest housewives, cozily drinking
expensive coffee in sumptuous sur
roundings.
This type of publicity unfairly takes
advantage of the "educated" univer
sity student. By placing the tin on Re
noir's table, General Foods is trying
to associate a European lifestyle with
their product at the expense of a
great master. My first reaction was
one of pleasure at seeing the corner

of a painting which I have long ad
mired. When I opened it up, my reac
tion was one of disgust at the
blemishing of a work of art. (Surely
Renoir would not appreciate this use
of his painting.)
I do not blame the Daily for this. I
am aware that inserts are the bane of
the editor's existence and the joy of
the business manager. General
Foods, however immoral, has staged
an effective campaign. However I
cannot hesitate in questioning the
respect their advertising manager has
for this painter. I also question the
Philip's Collection curator's
judgment for releasing the work for
reprint by General Foods.

tually the culmination of one of the
greatest seasons for Stanford men's
swimming ever. It seems sad that in
reporting on this meet and others
throughout the year, the Stanford
Daily is the last newspaper to realize
the talent, spirit and excellence in its
own backyard.

bophomore, undeclared
Renoir coffee ad Insults
I am writing to protest the nature
of the General Foods International
Coffees advertisement which ap
peared as an insert in yesterday's
Daily. This is an abuse and an
adulteration of Renoir's masterpiece,
and I feel that it should not go un
noticed.
In my mind's eye, to deface "The
Luncheon of the Boating Party" by
inserting a tin of General Foods
Amaretto Coffee, a coffee pot, and
two cups is to insult the integrity of
the painter's work. I would even say
that those who view this artist's work
seriously might interpret the ad as a

mockery. The fact that the reproduc
tion is of museum poster quality
merely serves to accentuate the
grossness of this exploitation, as well
as to underscore the dollar magni
tude of this advertising campaign.
In addition to yesterday's insert,
other coffee ads run by General
Foods in the Daily have unilaterally
depicted college women as future
elitest housewives, cozily drinking
expensive coffee in sumptuous sur
roundings.
This type of publicity unfairly takes
advantage of the "educated" univer
sity student. By placing the tin on Re
noir's table, General Foods is trying
to associate a European lifestyle with
their product at the expense of a
great master. My first reaction was
one of pleasure at seeing the corner

of a painting which I have long ad
mired. When I opened it up, my reac
tion was one of disgust at the
blemishing of a work of art. (Surely
Renoir would not appreciate this use
of his painting.)
I do not blame the Daily for this. I
am aware that inserts are the bane of
the editor's existence and the joy of
the business manager. General
Foods, however immoral, has staged
an effective campaign. However I
cannot hesitate in questioning the
respect their advertising manager has
for this painter. I also question the
Philip's Collection curator's
judgment for releasing the work for
reprint by General Foods.
