# Handgun restrictions â€“ insights of local officials
## 
### Stephen Williams 
Handgun control is a big issue on the Peninsu
la, and at least three San Mateo County police
chiefs favor tighter restrictions on the purchase
of guns.
Palo Alto has already discussed control meas
ures and city councils in the area will debate the
issue of gun control within the next few months.
Last month the Palo Alto City Council unani
mously voted to authorize City Attorney Diane

i don't put a great deal of
value on handguns for self
defense. They are a false sense
of security/

Lee to determine the legality of a handgun con
trol law. Council member Leland Levy had
earlier this year proposed a citywide ban, but
council members are worried that state legisla
tion may prohibit local handgun control laws.
If the handgun ban is found not to violate state
law, the council's policy and procedures com
mittee will conduct a public hearing on the issue
before the entire council would vote on the mat
ter.
Levy has said that the local control effort itself
would most likely have little effect but that he
hopes it will urge state or federal legislation ef
forts.
The Coalition for Safe Streets (CFSS), a Los An
geles-based community organization, is current
ly working on a statewide initiative on gun con
trol for the November ballot.
The initiative, which proposes tighter controls
on the sale and transfer of handguns, has been
publicly endorsed by police chiefs Jerry
McNamara of Menlo Park, Dick Moore of Athe
rton, and Jack Norton of Foster City.
Considered too restrictive by the National Ri
fle Association, and too limited the National
Coalition to Ban Handguns, the CSFF proposal
would not ban the private ownership of hand
guns. Rather, it would require that every time a
gun is sold, both the seller and the buyer will
have to report the exchange to the State At
torney General's office.
The criminal code now requires only that a
person be 21 years old, have a California driver's
license, and state that he is not a convicted felon,
to purchase a handgun. In addition, there is a 15-
day wait between purchasing the weapon and
taking it home from the store.
Subsequent sales of the weapon by private in
dividuals do not have to be reported, and the

new owners do not have to be licensed.
The proposal would "take guns away from the
people who shouldn't have them," said Moore,
who is also president of the San Mateo County
Police Chiefs' Association. The association has
not taken a stand 6n the issue of gun control.
"It would keep track of guns even after they
changed hands several times," said McNamara,
who said he feels that the proposal is well-bal
anced.
The initiative recommends a sentence of six
months in jail for possession of an unregistered
handgun, one year in jail for black market ex
changes of handguns, and civil liability for sell
ing an unregistered gun that is used in a criminal
act.
McNamara said he wants a total ban on the
private ownership of handguns in Menlo Park
similar to the ordinance recently passed in
Morton Grove, 111.
"But any rigid ban like the one in Morton
Grove is going to end up in the courts. This in
itiative is the best way now, a statewide in
itiative," he said.
McNamara and Moore agreed that the pro
posal wouldn't reduce the number of armed
criminals overnight, but they believe that it will
be effective in the long run.
"I think that the primary effect of the limita
tion would be to reduce the number of acciden
tal killings. I don't think it would have impact in

'A handgun in the home is
four times as likely to kill a
family member as it is to kill a
criminal. Those are the facts/

the short run on the removal of weapons from
criminals," said Lt. Bob Harvey of the Palo Alto
police department.
"The proposal would give police the ability to
take some action," McNamara said. "As it is
now, many times there is nothing we can do
when we stop someone who is armed."
Neither McNamara nor Moore could recall
any incidents in the last two years when a hand
gun actually served as an effective defensive
weapon against a burglar or a robber.
"A handgun in the home is four times as likely
to kill a family member as it is to kill a criminal.
Those are the facts," said McNamara.
"I don't put a great deal of value on handguns
for self-defense," Moore said. "They are a false
security. It is a myth that most policemen think
citizens should carry handguns."
