## Pryor turns phoenix, Das Boot goes down 
### Steve Vineberg Richard Pryor live on the Sunset Strip 
Richard Pryor's comedy rou
tines are more intimate re
flections of his private self than
those of any other performer;
his nightclub act is like a
burlesque confessional in
which all the sins turn out to be
real ones. In Richard Pryor Live
in Concert, released three
years ago, he turned his marital
fiascoes into stand-up comedy,

and in one spellbinding pas
sage re-enacted his own heart
attack while audiences held
their breath, wondering if he
could sustain the tone and the
intensity, just as a circus au
dience is held by a high-wire
artist's difficulty in keeping
himself from falling. When you
watch Richard Pryor Live on
the Sunset Strip, you feel a new
tension from the very begin
ning.
Pryor's off-stage activities
I have been so much in the news
i that you ask yourself, "Does he
dare spin a routine around his
accident?" He does, of course

— a 20-minute piece that
evolves from a description of
his own addiction to freebase
into a recollection of the time
he spent in the hospital re
covering from his burns. It rep
resents the farthest leap any
comic has taken since Lenny
Bruce — maybe ever; simulta
neously hilarious and harrow
ing, it plays so many disparate
emotional chords that one
doesn't know exactly how to
respond to it. Perhaps awe is
the only appropriate reaction.

Walking out of the mov
iehouse, a theatrical acquain
tance suggested to me that this
picture should be required
viewing for all aspiring actors as
a lesson on how to deal with
explosive emotional material.
Pryor, like Lily Tomlin, presents
in a comic mode what would
certainly be tragic in any other
framework; her celebrated bit
about the rubber freak might
turn into Carson McCullers if
she changed "rubber freak" to
"alcoholic." Pryor, on the oth
er hand, doesn't disguise his
material, and our awareness of
how personal it is sharpens it in

an unique way. But it remains
funny, even when we are sad
dened or horrified by what he
is telling us. (The few serious
moments come across as sen
timental; they are the only arid
areas in the picture.)
Tomlin has fared better in
the movies than Pryor, because
even in a nightclub she is a
character actress; her gifts are
thus particularly adaptable to a
dramatic medium. But nar
rative movies can't capture
what Pryor does brilliantly;
written roles seem to strait
jacket him, and he really needs
an audience. He struck a few
unusual low notes in Blue Col
lar, and his efforts to teach
Gene Wilder how to walk like a
black man in Silver Streak were
the only reason to sit through
that picture; but only his two
concert films give him the
chance to fly.
In Live on the Sunset Strip,
Pryor works his way through a
variety of subjects — racism, of
course (in a marvellous turn
about on white fear of blacks,
he tells the audience confiden
tially, "It's not that I don't trust
white people, but in the night
— you know"), lawyers, the
Mafia, his trip to Africa, and
sex. He anthropomorphizes
lions, bears, jungle rabbits,
cheetahs and gazelles, as well
as the freebase pipe he claims
was his "appendage" for more
than a year, and he does won
derful imitations — line draw
ings, really — of Billy Dee Wil
liams and Jim Brown. (The free
base routine is partly an act of
homage to Brown, who
emerges as something of a
hero, having struggled to break
Pryor of his addiction and re
mained a faithful compaion
through the post-accident or
deal.)
It may sound fatuous to
speak of liberation in these
post-Lenny Bruce days, but
Pryor's sexual candidness and
freewheeling use of obscenity
do, I think, have a liberating ef
fect on audiences. He may
have done more for the word
"fuck" than anyone since D.H.
Lawrence. And his discussions
of his relationships with wom
en are so firmly grounded in
personal truth, and admit so
openly of his own short
comings, that men don't have
to feel guilty about laughing at
them and women can enjoy
them too. (The best female
equivalent to them is probably
the play For Colored Girls Who

Have Considered Suicide
When the Rainbow Is Enuf.)
Joe Layton, who directed this
film, and Haskell Wexler, who
shot it, are to be commended
for bringing a superlative
nightclub show to the screen
with such simplicity of means,
so that movie audiences can
watch it without the distraction
of razzle-dazzle camera effects
or what is the bane of so much
concert footage — an excess of
cross-cutting from the per
former to the audience. As it is,
the few times Layton shows us
the audience, we experience a
feeling of privation. Having
seen so little of Pryor's talent in
so many awful movies, we
aren't interested in anything
else in Live on Sunset Strip but
the complete Richard Pryor.

Das Boot
Das Boot (The Boat), which
was written and directed by the
German filmmaker Wolfgang
Petersen, possesses no striking
thematic or characterological
differences from any other
World War II submarine ad
venture picture; what dist

inguishes it is its perspective.
Almost the entire film is shot
from within the U-boat alluded
to in the title; we experience
the attacks from British vessels
as the crew of the boat does.
This device not only increases
the tension of the battle
scenes, but also replaces the
traditional focus on naval fire
works with a more human one.
We see how the sailors con
tinue to function in the midst
of confusion; as rivets pop,
chambers are flooded and
their mates sustain various in
juries, they manage to survive
the damage, scream orders and
obey them, and effect what
ever repair is necessary and
possible. Under the circum
stances, these are acts of true
existential heroism.

Inside the boat, the living
quarters are cramped beyond
reason. Two men share each
bunk — because, it is thought,
one of them always has to be
on watch anyway — and the
bunks fit into pockets on either
side of a narrow cylinder that is
the only means of passage.
Most of us would balk at spend

ing a day in such a living situ
ation, but these men survive
months of it, and their good
spirits endure much longer
than one might guess. As the
weeks wend on, of course, they
become bored, listless, and so
close to each other that all
health problems and private
habits are matters for public
mockery. Das Boot is a small,
funny essay on the horrors of
intimate communal living.
When Petersen and his pho
tographer, Jost Vacano, take us
up to the deck for an occasion
al scene, we feel the sailors' im
mense relief at being able to
breathe fresh air — even in the
midst of a storm. We share their
relief, too, when a sea fight
shatters the monotony of three
weeks of inactivity.
Das Boot is a solidly crafted
movie, for the most part (and
much more entertaining than
Petersen's last two films, The
Consequence and Black and
White Like Day and Night), but
it has a structural problem: the
most exciting portion — a
series of three attacks by the
British that nearly decimates
the sub — occurs too early, so
the last 45 minutes are
more wearing than they should
be. The picture is, in fact, over
long, but I have a hunch that
the scenes I would choose to
cut are precisely the ones Pe
tersen cares most about —
those moments when he veers
off into character detail or ob
servations on the conflict be
tween humanitarian and patri
otic ideals. The plain truth is
that Das Boot is just a U-boat

adventure story, and whenever
Petersen tries to turn it into
something else — to deepen it
— he risks losing the audience,
because the characters aren't
especially interestng and aside
from its unusual depiction of a
claustrophobic environment, it
doesn't have anything to say
that we haven't heard a
thousand times before.
We can accept the tough, in
expressive acting of Jurgen
Prochnow (who looks like a
cross between Tommy Lee
Jones and Wesley Lau of the
old Perry Mason TV show) as
the captain as we accept
Charles Bronson in a film like
Hard Times; he does what he
has to. But as soon as Petersen
leads us out of genre into dra
ma, Prochnow and the other
actors begin to seem inade
quate.
I have another major bone to
pick with Das Boot: I found its
downer of an ending to be ter
ribly unfair to the audience.
Terrifying as much of it is, Pe
tersen has made a film about
the ability of men to survive ap
palling hardships, and he has
used the traditions of war mov
ies to encourage us to root for
theirsurvival. To silence that
strain of optimism with a
nihilistic conclusion makes no
dramatic sense; thematically, It
may be a logical extension of a
point of view that is voiced in
the most unsuccessful episodes
— the scenes in which Pe
tersen's attempts at profundity
make the movie appear a little
pretentious.


Richard Pyror faced the destructive side of his personality,
and came out stronger- and funnier- for the experience.


The claustrophobic confines of the U-boat U-96 are portrayed in Wolfgang Petersen's Das Boor.
