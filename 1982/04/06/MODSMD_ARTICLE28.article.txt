# Touring getsrevenge: NRBQ hasa hard day at work
## 
### Daniel Lerner NRBQ Keystone/Palo Alto 28 March 1982 
Ever feel like not going to work in the
morning?
You have no choice. You get up, go to
your job, and then watch the clock slowly
tick on to 5 p.m. Time seems to expand and
your effort reflects your enthusiasm.
Last Sunday night, NRBQ did not want to
go to work. Having just played an exhausting
show the night before, opening and accom
panying Bonnie Rait at the Warfield, they
came to Palo Alto and appeared listless, ap
proaching disinterested at their best.
NRBQ, coloquially tongued Nurb-que by
their most devoted followers, stands for the
New Rhythm and Blues Quartet. Their music
is not mainstream, using the usual Foreigner
and Springsteen criteria for comparison.
They play a sharp, clean and at times ludi
crous mixture of Jazz, Blues and the now re
sugent Rockabilly. Their strong East coast fol
lowing, accumulated from twelve years of
small theatre gigs and six albums, could best
be described as a cult, we aware of the fact
that when the four members of NRBQ and
their accompanying two man Whole Wheat
Herns are hot, they are undoubtedly the
equals of bands like the English Beat and
Blasters for raw, unadulterated danceability.
Unfortunately, Sunday's Keystone ap

pearance found them losing a battle to
fatigue in a struggle for enthusiasm and
hence produced a show almost totally void
of the usually plentiful NRBQ concert high
lights.
The band arrived on stage shortly after 11
p.m. and in what appeared to be a move to
combat their own boredom of playing their
recent hits night after night, opened with
four relatively obscure songs taken off early
albums. Keyboardist Terry Adams, founder
of the group and its unchallenged leader,
seemed to resurect the seldom heard tunes
from somewhere in their much travelled
past, playing the first few notes, smiling,

almost challenging lead guitarist Big Al An
derson and the other members of the band
to quickly reminisce and accompany him on
this journey into the band's past. The super
bly skilled musicians were able to make
these leaps almost effortlessly, and smoothly
followed Adams on his quest. The result
should have been a pleasant treat for the
mostly transplanted Eastern audience, but by
opening with the unfamiliar set instead of in
serting it into the middle of the gig, the au
dience appeared to be caught off guard and
the dance crowd did not assume its usual
density and frenzy until almost 20 minutes
into the show.

The immense (both in skill and size) Al An
derson resuscitated the crowd at this point
with a hopping version of "Ain't It All Right,"
off their most critically acclaimed album
Scraps and bassist joey Spampinato con
tinued the revival with an almost inspired
version of "I Love Her, She Loves Me," off of
their biggest selling LP, NRBQ at Yankee Sta
dium.
The sound quality throughout the concert
was a let down. Besides being far louder than
necessary, the mix was very poor and as a re
sult the usually tightly meshed NRBQ sound
was left in a maze of distortion. Compound
ing the problem, keyboardist Adams
cranked up the amplifier on his electric pi
ano several times during the night, totally
destroying any remnants of a mix that still re
mained.
Twice during the set, the usually gritty,
hard driving band settled down to very slow
tunes, both led by Adams on an upright pi
ano. The first, a slow, almost Waltz
instrumental; the second, a meandering
blues number, also sans lyrics. Nestled be
tween these two songs was a three tune
spree that was as close to hot as the band got
all night. The dance floor came alive and as
sumed the tone of abandonment that usually
abounds at NRBQ shows as bassist Spam
pinato and guitarist Anderson ripped into
"Green Lights, Yes, Yes, Yes," and"It Comes
To Me Naturally." This was as hectic as it was

to get all night. Adams seemed to almost be
practicing crowd control as he slowed the
flow again and 4gain all night, never letting
the all-forgiving audience reach a climax.
The band ended the set with their only
pop-charted single, "Ridin' In My Car" and,
after a mild three song encore concluding
with "That's Neat That's Nice," left the stage.
Several minutes later, as an undeservedly
long round of applause continued, the
house lights went up and that familiar voice
boomed over the P.A. system, "On behalf of
the Keystone and NRBQ, I'd like to thank
you for coming ..." That was all, and now
we were to go dutifully home.
I had seen the band play the Keystone only
three months before and they had whipped
the crowd into a frenzy and held it there for
almost three and a half hours. Last Sunday
the show ran for a little over an hour and a
half and relied on the enthusiasm of NRBQ
fans to try to fill in the gaps in a lackluster
show. It is not fair to the person who waited
three weeks and spends $7.50 to see a band
go through the motions. Somehow, though,
my disappointment with NRBQ failed to
build to anger.
A band like NRBQ tours for a different rea
son than the superstar bands: to pay rent and
eat. Keeping that in mind, you can excuse
them for being tired, and it kind of makes it
easier to excuse a bad day at work and wait
for them to come around again.
