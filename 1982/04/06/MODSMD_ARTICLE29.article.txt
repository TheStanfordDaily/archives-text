AAAARRRGGGHH!
God, do I hate concept
gttftfrms ever since the Beatles
foisted off "Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band" on
an unsuspecting public, record
buying has become unsafe for
'

even the most amiable music
fan. Hundreds of bands, un
able to put together two sides
of listenable music, opt out,
declaring their output to be a
concept album, the mystical
weight of that pronouncement
making the need for sensible
music secondary in importance
to the wonderful "ideas" being
imparted. Such a group is the
Buggies, and such an album is
Adventures in Modern Rec
ording.
Some people may remember
the Buggies as the band, along
with Bruce Woolley and the
Camera Club, that produced a
nice, upbeat new wave/pop
single called "Video Killed the
Radio Star." The band is also
memorable in that it split neat
ly in two a few years back, half
the personnel going to join the
depleted ranks of Yes, that
modest little pop outfit. On the
basis of those accomplish
ments the Buggies now have
the latitude to spew forth their
latest album and indulge them
selves in some 33 minutes of
highly modern tedium.
Before I launch into this pan
egyric, let me just tell you a lit
tle of the horror that faced me
upon contemplation of this
album. I am not unfamiliar with
the tricks a fully-equipped rec
ording studio can do. I am a
man who has listened to sever

al recent David Bowie albums
not merely once, but several
times. I was in attendance at a
party where a young man,
heedless of the warnings of
myself and other of his friends,
ventured too near to a pair of
extremely large stereo speak
ers which were playing at high
volume a Rush album and was
instantly broken down to his
most basic component
molecules. After such ex
periences, the idea of listening
to an album where some bright
young men have given them
selves free reign to experiment
with the studio gives me, in the
words of a friend of mine, fear
and trembling and the sickness
unto death.
Nonetheless, resolute, de
termined to fulfill my duties as
a Daily reviewer, I put the
album on my record player.
Almost instantly, the air was
filled with meaningless clatter,
strange and unwholesome
noises, and eerie wailings and
ululations. I was frightened, es
pecially as I had not, as yet, put
the stylus to the record.
The album starts off to the
sound of cheering, a huge au
dience at a concert. Suddenly,
the audience disappears. You
wonder what's going on. Bruce
Horn, the lead
singer/songwriter, informs you
"They're not playing/ They're
not playing/ They're just hav
ing Adventures in Modern
Recording." Get it? Over the
cheers, the echo chamber ef
fects, and the datta-datta-da
beat, the band is warning us of
what's to come.
The next song, "I was a Beat
nik," starts off with a very Yes
like opening that rapidly turns
to swing. The song has syn
thesizer that sounds like
trumpet, and one of the most
catchily moronic choruses ever
recorded. "I was a beatnik, a

beatnik, a beatnik ..." Quite
catchy, indeed, but also totally
meaningless.
Similarly meaningless is
"Vermilion Sands," another
monstrosity that clocks in at a
bloated 6:46. Sung totally de
void of any discernable emo
tion, the song contains the
clever rhyme "make a
diamond sweat, wanna bet?"
Threatening never to end, the
song plods its way to a close,
where we are treated to anoth
er aspect of our adventure in
modern recording; sounds
that tell a story.
As best as I can understand it,
the song ends as the lead singer
is suddenly taken away by a
choir and thrown in front of a
car, or other large vehicle. The
choir then goes to Shakey's
pizza to celebrate. This, my
friends, is art in action.
After that comes "I am a

Camera," which starts out as a
deeply moving song in the Best
Barry Manilow tradition, and
then, spurred by the drum syn
thesizer (a particular dislike of
mine; some of my best friends
are drummers, and none of the
sounds that machine is able to
produce rise above the be
your-own-band effects they
plug in Wurlitzer organ ads)
explodes into a kind of Phila
delphia soul imitation, a kind
of cross between Roxy Music
and the theme to "Welcome
Back, Kotter."
The lyrics are perversely
meaningless as well. "I am a
camera," it repeats, and then
we get "Lovers they will never
wait.../ Take heart, I will nev
er let you go./ If you wanna let
your feelings show/ Lovers all,
how they never broke your
heart/ You lose them if the
feeling starts." Here lead singer

Horn and his chief collaborator
Geoff Downes have managed
to produce a song that is not
only not sensibly related in
ternally, but isalsothematically
incompatible from line to line.
The most pressing part of this
critique is that this does not
matter.
Having already defined itself
as a concept album, one cen
tered on sounds it is possible to
make in a studio, any storytell
ing or character depiction nor
mal in other songs is super
fluous here. The point of the
album is to show the listener
the range of studio magicks,
not to interest him in a nar
rative. This orientation is often
used to great success in fields
other than rock music; how
ever, this album is not mar
keted as either muzak or sound
effects and therefore, as a rock
album, not worth buying.

The rest of the album is quite
similar, and includes a song to
"Lenny," who was "walking on
glass." It's not Mr. Bruce, for
this Lenny is "scientific, so sci
entific," although the song
does include the social com
mentary "How unstable we
bolt with horse / Setting music
to muscle / All the fallers who
litter the course / As we run to
the castle." It's definitely
poetry (I see an a-b-a-b rhyme
scheme) but I would not claim
it meaningful.
Adventures in Modern Rec
ording is a good record to be
given, as it teaches perspective.
There are a lot of rock bands
who cross the boundary of
mysticism to enter the realm of
nonsense, and the Buggies on
this album set out on such a
lengthy foray that I doubt
much will ever be heard from
them again.

gttftfrms ever since the Beatles
foisted off "Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band" on
an unsuspecting public, record
buying has become unsafe for
'

even the most amiable music
fan. Hundreds of bands, un
able to put together two sides
of listenable music, opt out,
declaring their output to be a
concept album, the mystical
weight of that pronouncement
making the need for sensible
music secondary in importance
to the wonderful "ideas" being
imparted. Such a group is the
Buggies, and such an album is
Adventures in Modern Rec
ording.
Some people may remember
the Buggies as the band, along
with Bruce Woolley and the
Camera Club, that produced a
nice, upbeat new wave/pop
single called "Video Killed the
Radio Star." The band is also
memorable in that it split neat
ly in two a few years back, half
the personnel going to join the
depleted ranks of Yes, that
modest little pop outfit. On the
basis of those accomplish
ments the Buggies now have
the latitude to spew forth their
latest album and indulge them
selves in some 33 minutes of
highly modern tedium.
Before I launch into this pan
egyric, let me just tell you a lit
tle of the horror that faced me
upon contemplation of this
album. I am not unfamiliar with
the tricks a fully-equipped rec
ording studio can do. I am a
man who has listened to sever

al recent David Bowie albums
not merely once, but several
times. I was in attendance at a
party where a young man,
heedless of the warnings of
myself and other of his friends,
ventured too near to a pair of
extremely large stereo speak
ers which were playing at high
volume a Rush album and was
instantly broken down to his
most basic component
molecules. After such ex
periences, the idea of listening
to an album where some bright
young men have given them
selves free reign to experiment
with the studio gives me, in the
words of a friend of mine, fear
and trembling and the sickness
unto death.
Nonetheless, resolute, de
termined to fulfill my duties as
a Daily reviewer, I put the
album on my record player.
Almost instantly, the air was
filled with meaningless clatter,
strange and unwholesome
noises, and eerie wailings and
ululations. I was frightened, es
pecially as I had not, as yet, put
the stylus to the record.
The album starts off to the
sound of cheering, a huge au
dience at a concert. Suddenly,
the audience disappears. You
wonder what's going on. Bruce
Horn, the lead
singer/songwriter, informs you
"They're not playing/ They're
not playing/ They're just hav
ing Adventures in Modern
Recording." Get it? Over the
cheers, the echo chamber ef
fects, and the datta-datta-da
beat, the band is warning us of
what's to come.
The next song, "I was a Beat
nik," starts off with a very Yes
like opening that rapidly turns
to swing. The song has syn
thesizer that sounds like
trumpet, and one of the most
catchily moronic choruses ever
recorded. "I was a beatnik, a

beatnik, a beatnik ..." Quite
catchy, indeed, but also totally
meaningless.
Similarly meaningless is
"Vermilion Sands," another
monstrosity that clocks in at a
bloated 6:46. Sung totally de
void of any discernable emo
tion, the song contains the
clever rhyme "make a
diamond sweat, wanna bet?"
Threatening never to end, the
song plods its way to a close,
where we are treated to anoth
er aspect of our adventure in
modern recording; sounds
that tell a story.
As best as I can understand it,
the song ends as the lead singer
is suddenly taken away by a
choir and thrown in front of a
car, or other large vehicle. The
choir then goes to Shakey's
pizza to celebrate. This, my
friends, is art in action.
After that comes "I am a

Camera," which starts out as a
deeply moving song in the Best
Barry Manilow tradition, and
then, spurred by the drum syn
thesizer (a particular dislike of
mine; some of my best friends
are drummers, and none of the
sounds that machine is able to
produce rise above the be
your-own-band effects they
plug in Wurlitzer organ ads)
explodes into a kind of Phila
delphia soul imitation, a kind
of cross between Roxy Music
and the theme to "Welcome
Back, Kotter."
The lyrics are perversely
meaningless as well. "I am a
camera," it repeats, and then
we get "Lovers they will never
wait.../ Take heart, I will nev
er let you go./ If you wanna let
your feelings show/ Lovers all,
how they never broke your
heart/ You lose them if the
feeling starts." Here lead singer

Horn and his chief collaborator
Geoff Downes have managed
to produce a song that is not
only not sensibly related in
ternally, but isalsothematically
incompatible from line to line.
The most pressing part of this
critique is that this does not
matter.
Having already defined itself
as a concept album, one cen
tered on sounds it is possible to
make in a studio, any storytell
ing or character depiction nor
mal in other songs is super
fluous here. The point of the
album is to show the listener
the range of studio magicks,
not to interest him in a nar
rative. This orientation is often
used to great success in fields
other than rock music; how
ever, this album is not mar
keted as either muzak or sound
effects and therefore, as a rock
album, not worth buying.

The rest of the album is quite
similar, and includes a song to
"Lenny," who was "walking on
glass." It's not Mr. Bruce, for
this Lenny is "scientific, so sci
entific," although the song
does include the social com
mentary "How unstable we
bolt with horse / Setting music
to muscle / All the fallers who
litter the course / As we run to
the castle." It's definitely
poetry (I see an a-b-a-b rhyme
scheme) but I would not claim
it meaningful.
Adventures in Modern Rec
ording is a good record to be
given, as it teaches perspective.
There are a lot of rock bands
who cross the boundary of
mysticism to enter the realm of
nonsense, and the Buggies on
this album set out on such a
lengthy foray that I doubt
much will ever be heard from
them again.
