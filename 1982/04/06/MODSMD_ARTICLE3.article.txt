# Nader proclaims burden on citizens
## 
### Katherine Hutt 
"Are we going to put the burdens
of citizenship on our own backs?,"
citizen activist Ralph Nader asked a
capacity crowd last night in Cub
berley Auditorium.
Nader and three other panelists
were addressing the question, "Are
Reaganomics and the New Federal
ism destroying American cities?/' in
the third symposium of the five-day
"Disorientation Week," sponsored
by the Stanford Progressive Alliance.
Rather than placing the blame for
society's problems on the corpo
rations, Nader said, we should in
stead put "pressure on ourselves to
undertake the burdens of
citizenship." This can be ac
complished, he added, by "instilling
a sense of civic urgency" In the "vlc
irmsr* —**—«
Nader attempted to do just that in
his 45-minute speech, attacking first
President Ronald Reagan, then cor
porations, and, finally, the two-party
political system. He described Rea
gan as "an ignorant man," and a
"corporatist."
Nader gave three reasons for his
assertion of Reagan's ignorance.

First, he said, Reagan "allows the
power brokers to turn him into a
mannequin," and thus lets himself be
manipulated by corporations. Sec
ond, he claimed that Reagan "recoils
at complexity."
Finally, Nader charged that Rea
gan's policies "concentrate more
power in the hands of the few," cit
ing many examples of mismanage
ment of government agencies by the
current administration.
Nader next directed his attack
towards the large corporations which
have often been the subject of his
criticism. Addressing the topic of this
symposium, Nader declared thai
"the big corporations bleed the
money from the cities, then move to
the suburbs and allow the cities to
rot."
GMBH HHI lllßUste, and the result
ing poverty and unempioyent of in
ner-city youth, Nader wondered
aloud why there was an "absence of
downright rebellion" in American
cities.
Nader also found fault with the
two-party political system as it now
exists in the United States. "There's
no civic background to parties to
day," he said, and detailed their lack
of grassroots support. The Re
publican and Democratic parties are
currently no more than "fossils," he
added.
Nader offered several suggestions
for alleviation of the problems which
he had outlined. He focused mainly
on what he termed "citizen utility
boards," or groups of consumers
who, by taking upon themselves "the
burdens of citizenship," would be
able to exercise some control over
what he described as the all-pow
erful corporations. He cited as an ex
ample an organization which has al
ready been formed in Wisconsin.
Nader proposed that all public utili
ties, such as electric and telephone
companies, be required by law to in
sert in their monthly bill an invitation
for their customer to join a fellow
group of consumers.
The "Citizen Utility Board" which
arose in Wisconsin in reponse to high
electricity rates already has 60,000
members, he said, and is now moving

into the policy-making level, with Its
own budget and group of advisers.
Nader's fellow panelists addressed
more directly the question posed by
the symposium. Both Mayor Gus
Newport of Berkeley and Mayor
Mike Rotkin of Santa Cruz attacked
the policies of the Reagan adminis
tration.
Said Newport, "Dig under the sur
face of any major American city, and
you will find Reaganomics casual
ties." Rotkin said that, as is the case
with all cities in California, it is dif
ficult to tell whether the problems
faced by Santa Cruz stem from the
Reagan cutbacks or Proposition 11
However, he concluded his summary
of that city's financial troubles by de
claring that "the Reagan government
... is destroying local government."
The fourth panelist, Prof. William
Muir, chairman of the Political Sci
ence Department at U.C.-Berkeley,
presented a contrasting viewpoint to
the other speakers with his defense
of Reagan's policies. He described
the advantages of "New Federalism,"
and advocated its tenet that power to
execute domestic policy must de
volve back to the states.

into the policy-making level, with Its
own budget and group of advisers.
Nader's fellow panelists addressed
more directly the question posed by
the symposium. Both Mayor Gus
Newport of Berkeley and Mayor
Mike Rotkin of Santa Cruz attacked
the policies of the Reagan adminis
tration.
Said Newport, "Dig under the sur
face of any major American city, and
you will find Reaganomics casual
ties." Rotkin said that, as is the case
with all cities in California, it is dif
ficult to tell whether the problems
faced by Santa Cruz stem from the
Reagan cutbacks or Proposition 11
However, he concluded his summary
of that city's financial troubles by de
claring that "the Reagan government
... is destroying local government."
The fourth panelist, Prof. William
Muir, chairman of the Political Sci
ence Department at U.C.-Berkeley,
presented a contrasting viewpoint to
the other speakers with his defense
of Reagan's policies. He described
the advantages of "New Federalism,"
and advocated its tenet that power to
execute domestic policy must de
volve back to the states.
