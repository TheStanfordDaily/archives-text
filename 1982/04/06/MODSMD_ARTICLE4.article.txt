# Harrington warns of economic crisis
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz Senior staff writer 
Calling for responses as radical as
those of President Ronald Reagan —
"but in the right direction, which is
left" — socialist leader Michael Har
rington said yesterday that the coun
try is "in the midst of the greatest
domestic economic crisis since the
Great Depression."
Granting that the United States is
not ready quite yet for a transition to
socialism, Harrington, chair of the
Democratic Socialists of America,
said yesterday afternoon in Cub
berley Auditorium that the 1980s will
be a decade of radical solution,
"maybe for the worse, maybe for the
better," and that "in 1990 this coun
try will differ from 1980 as much as
1940 differed from 1930."
Addressing the nation's domestic
economic crisis, Harrington began
with a "kind word" for Reagan,

saying he admired the president for
two things. First, "he understands
that the situation requires radical
solutions and he has proposed
some," and secondly, Reagan "is ac
tually legistating into law the pro
grams he campaigned for."
"The problem, of course, is that
the program is terrible and vicious
and unworkable," Harrington said.
The country's structural crisis, Har
rington said, comes in part from the
enormous increase of corporate
power over the American economy.
That power, Harrington said, has un
dermined the traditional liberal wis
dom that said "when faced with infla
tion, have a little unemployment,"
and vice-versa. He said corporations
now respond to a recession "not by
lowering prices but by raising
prices."
"Since 1960 American capitalism
has come into the new multinational

corporate division of world labor,"
Harrington said, "and that means
competition for Detroit." He said this
multinationalization of capital has
meant that entire industries, regions
and areas have become obsolete.
"Now we are in a crisis of the
domestic economy because of a
change in the international econo
my," he said. The result is that we
presently have the worst unemploy
ment since the Depression, accord
ing to Harrington.
Harrington also discussed the Rea
gan administration's foreign policy
stance, asking why the United States
has adopted a policy toward El
Salvador and Nicaragua which is not
only reactionary but "stupid ... That
Moscow and Havana are there (in El
Salvador) I have no doubt, but that
they are the cause (of the conflict) is
absurd."
Harrington said his solution to the
structural problem of the American
economy is to plan jobs, including
some in the private sector.
"I would like to see the U.S. create
a railroad industry — we've de
stroyed the railroad industry in this
country." He said planned public de
velopment of the railroad would
create a new industry and new jobs.
Harrington also proposed creating
a publicly-owned energy corpo
ration to develop alternative re
newable forms of energy. He said if
the United States could develop solar
energy we could solve not only our
own energy problems, but those of
the Third World as well.
Corporations, he said, "are going
to be around for a long time." The
task is therefore not to abolish them
but to make them subordinate them

selves to democratic planning, Har
rington said. The method he ad
vocated is providing subsidies only to
those corporations that create jobs.
Harrington's response to the for
eign policy/defense issue was to ad
vocate a nuclear arms freeze. "The
fact of the matter is that the Soviet
Union does not have superiority over
the United States," he said. If a freeze
were put in place right now, Har
rington said both countries still have
the capability to destroy the world
He said, however, that a freeze
would only be a first step in arms re
duction negotiations.
Harrington said it is important to
look at the structural framework in
which the United States makes it de
cisions. He said the United States
looks at the Third World and says,
with utter sincerity, "The way for you
to get out of your poverty is to do
what we did — be enterprising, save
... go up the ladder we went up."
The problem, he said, is that "we
took the ladder with us when we
climbed up it."
The United States, Harrington said,
tends to view indigenous movements
as conspiracies, a framework it uses
not only in North-South relations but
in East-West relations as well.
An example he cited was the Unit
ed States' decision in the 1960s to put
multiple independently retargetable
re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) on its rock
ets. "The Soviet Union, which is a
'sneaky, communist country/ then
MIRVed its rockets, and we're always
shocked when the Soviets behave as
nastily as we say they always want to
behave."
Harrington said that former Presi
dent Jimmy Carter then priced his
MX missile plan based on (he as
sumption that the Soviets would not
respond.
Prefacing his own solutions, Har
rington criticized Reagan's restruc
turing of the tax system based on sup
ply-side economics — taking money
from the poor and giving it to the rich
so they can invest. He also cautioned
against "neo-liberalism" that ad
vocates investment in sunrise in
dustries based on "authoritarian gov
ernment planning from the top
down."
