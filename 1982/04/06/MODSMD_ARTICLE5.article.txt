Argentina fears war with Britain
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina's military government, while
quickly attempting to consolidate its political and military hold over the
Falkland Islands, has signaled clearly its hopes of heading off the on
coming British war fleet through the diplomatic leverage of Latin Amer
ica and its newly warm friendship with the United States.
While Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Mendez met in Washing
ton with the Organization of American States and high-ranking U.S. of
ficials, officials here appeared to be basing their hope of keeping the
long-disputed islands on U.S. mediation and pressure against British
militancy.
With nearly 150 years of patriotism at stake, there appeared to be little
prospect that Argentina would agree to retreat from the Falklands —
which are called the Malvinas here — even in the face of an imminent
British attack.
Argentine officials have appealed for regional support by arguing
that the seizure of the British-controlled island represented a reversal of
nearly 150 years of colonialism and by frequently invoking the "Rio
Treaty," which commits Latin American nations and the United States to
consult in the event that one of them is attacked.
So far, however, the government clearly has been disappointed by its
failure to obtain the level of international support it expected. In partic
ular, officials were surprised when the Soviet Union failed to veto a Se
curity Council resolution Saturday calling for an Argentine withdrawal
from the island and non-aligned members of the council failed to back
Argentina's position.
Although the governments of Venezuela, Peru and Uruguay have ex
pressed support for Argentina's occupation, other Latin American
powers appear to be hesitating.
As a result, Argentina has increasingly come
to turn its hope for a successful end to the crisis
to the United States, reports and sources here
said. In the past year, both governments have
sought actively to establish close relations, and
Argentina, which has backed U.S. policy in Cen
tral America politically and with offers of arms,
believes that the United States now should re
turn the support, officials here said.
Meanwhile, the government has moved to
consolidate its military hold on the islands., rein
forcing the Falklands' defenses with troops and
armor and reportedly nearly vacating several
mainland military bases, while arguing that the
British could not forcibly retake the island
without inflicting heavy civilian casualties.
Britain sets sail
London — Britain's foreign secretary, Lord
Carrington, and his two top aides resigned yes
terday because of what he called the "humil
iating affront to this country" of the Argen
tinian invasion of the Falkland Islands.
Lord Carrington's dramatic resignation came
shortly after a powerful British task force left the
English Channel base at Portsmouth en route to
the South Atlantic — to the cheers of a crowd of
about 10,000 well-wishers.
The aircraft carriers Invincible, with Prince
Andrew aboard, and Hermes, formed the nu
cleus of what is the largest and most powerful
British fleet that has sallied forth since the
seizure of the Suez Canal in 1956.
The ships passed the Round Tower, where
fleets have been watched by the local citizens
for centuries. One banner read: "Good luck,
Navy — Give 'em Hell." Another said: "Don't
Cry For Me Argentina."
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, expressed
her "supreme confidence in the British Navy."
Asked what might happen should the task force
fail, Thatcher quoted Queen Victoria, as she
said: "The possibility of failure does not exist.
"We must recover the Falklands for Britain."
Thatcher had said earlier that she had ac
cepted her foreign minister's resignation "with
a heavy heart." She had failed to persuade Lord
Carrington to remain in office, she said.
She announced that his successor would be
Francis Pym, leader of the House of Commons
and a former defense minister in the Thatcher
government.
Defense Secretary John Nott also tendered
his resignation after the fleet sailed from
Portsmouth yesterday morning, but Thatcher
turned it down.
She told Nott that he was needed to direct the
military operation launched to regain
possession of the Falkland Islands, taken by Ar
gentine assault troops Friday.
Once transferred to Royal Navy jurisdiction,
the Canberra could be used as a troop carrier or
a hospital ship for the Falkland Islands opera
tion.
Arms freeze discussed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yes
terday said he would appeal for nuclear dis
armament in a speech to the United Nations in
June and called on Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev to meet him there to discuss arms
control.
But at the same time that Reagan was continu
ing the arms-reduction overtures he launched
last week in a prime time news conference, he
again condemned the Soviet Union, which he
said had engaged in "crimes" against innocent
people in Afghanistan.
Reagan also repeated his assertion of last
week that the Soviets have a nuclear arms

margin of superiority over the United States, a
view disputed by many experts.
Reagan plans to address a special U.N. session
on disarmament in mid-June after he returns
from a European trip, where nuclear weapons
are certain to be an important item on the agen
da.
"And I hope, very much, that President
Brezhnev will be on hand to do the same thing
and address the same group," Reagan said. "I
think that this whole idea that I have been talk
ing about since back in the campaign of arms
reduction, arms control, is one of the most im
portant things that is facing us."
At the same time, the president said a nuclear
freeze would be "disadvantageous — in fact
even dangerous" to the United States because
the Soviets have a "definite margin of superior
ity" in nuclear arms.
He also contradicted conventional wisdom
among nuclear arms analysts by asserting that
the Soviets have a second-strike capability that
could absorb a U.S. retaliatory strike.
Reagan stuck to his ground when challenged
yesterday on these assertions. He also re
sponded to charges that he should not have said
what he said, even if it is true, because it con
veyed an impression of U.S. weakness.
"No, I am not sorry I said it because ... we
know for sure the Russians know that," Reagan
said. "I think the American people ought to be
able to know everything they know."
Reagan's intent in such declarations, accord
ing to White House officials, is to win at least the
war of words with the Soviets, who have made
numerous arms-control proposals. The presi
dent believes the Soviets take this stance be
cause they are ahead in the arms race.
Budget cuts supported
Washington — President Ronald Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) yes
terday signaled strongly for the first time that
negotiations aimed at reducing the 1983 budget
deficit may succeed.
The key appeared to be acceptance by the
president of some cuts in the large planned in
creases in defense spending and by con
gressional Democrats of a cap on automatic
cost-of-living increases in various benefit pro
grams including Social Security. Some new rev
enue-raising measures, such as an oil-import
fee, may also be part of the compromise.
"I look forward to progress being made as
soon as they (Congress) come back from the
Easter recess," Reagan told reporters at the
White House. "That's why we are negotiating so
fast."
On Capitol Hill, O'Neill declared, "There's a
possibility, there really is a possibility we could
work something out. I don't think (Reagan's) as
hardened on defense as he was." As far as he
can determine, the speaker added, the presi
dent is "still in cement" only on insisting that
last year's business and personal income tax
cuts not be reduced.
The signs of movement came as adminis
tration officials acknowledged the budget out
look has worsened as the economy has re
mained weak. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige said that because of a weaker than ex
pected economy and other developments, it
will take spending cuts of $20 billion to $30
billion on top of the $56 billion worth Reagan
proposed in February to hold the 1983 deficit to
$100 billion.
In other words, if no cuts are made and no
taxes or other revenue-raising measures
adopted, the 1983 deficit would be $175 billion
to $185 billion.

Reagan again said he believes the economy is
"bottoming out of a recession/' but he said he
expected unemployment — already at a post-
World War II record of 9 percent — to continue
to increase for a while.
Israeli minister threatens PLO
Jerusalem — In an emotional oration at the
graveside of a murdered Israeli diplomat, For
eign Minister ''itzhak Shamir yesterday threat
ened to attack terrorists "wherever we find
them ... with no holds barred, with no sur
cease."
On the surface, Shamir's speech seemed to
be a clear declaration that Israel would soon at
tack bases of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) in Lebanon, perhaps repeating last
summer's bombing strike on PLO headquarters
in Beirut. But, it was not clear whether Shamir's
words were meant to be taken literally.
The state-run Israel Radio said, in reporting
the speech, "The question, of course, is wheth
er this graveside eulogy is a bellwether for Is
raeli military intentions against the terrorists in
Lebanon." It offered no answer to the question.
Israeli officials, including Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon and Shamir, have said that Israel would
react militarily if a single Jew was killed by PLO
action anywhere in the world. However, since
these warnings were first issued, at least three
Israelis — diplomat Yacov Bar-Simantov who
was shot in Paris, and an Army sergeant major
and a police officer who were killed in dis
turbances in Israeli-occupied territories —have
died at the hands of terrorists. So far, there has
been no military retaliation.
In the funeral speech Shamir blamed
"Palestine terror organizations" for the killing
even though no group connected with the PLO
has taken responsibility for the crime, and
French police have no suspects.
"We shall hit them with no holds barred, with
no surcease — for we have decided to live, and
to live in peace."Shamir said.
Israel rhetoric always equates the PLO with
terrorism so it is an easy step to blame the PLO
for any terrorist attack against an Israeli or other
Jewish target whether or not PLO responsibility
can be proved. However, Israel Radio reported
in its late evening newscasts yesterday that Is
raeli officials now believe that Bar-Simantov
might have been killed by a "neo-Fascist or
ganization" and not the PLO.
Nevertheless, Bar-Simantov's killing has ig
nited a fierce debate in Israel about the proper
response.
Gold rises; stocks fall
New York — Stock prices drifted lower in
slackened trading yesterday, giving up a few of
the gains they recorded in the rally of the past
three weeks.
But precious metals issues turned in a strong
showing as gold and silver prices rose sharply.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
more than 40 points from mid-March through
last Friday, slipped 3.24 to 835.33.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled
46.90 million shares, down from 59.80 million in
the previous session.
The price of gold jumped $16.50 an ounce to
$346.70, and silver 29 cents an ounce to $7.46, on
the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Today's weather
Highs today will be in the 50s. Lows will be in
the 40s. There is a 70 percent chance of showers
today.

The state-run Israel Radio said, in reporting
the speech, "The question, of course, is wheth
er this graveside eulogy is a bellwether for Is
raeli military intentions against the terrorists in
Lebanon." It offered no answer to the question.
Israeli officials, including Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon and Shamir, have said that Israel would
react militarily if a single Jew was killed by PLO
action anywhere in the world. However, since
these warnings were first issued, at least three
Israelis — diplomat Yacov Bar-Simantov who
was shot in Paris, and an Army sergeant major
and a police officer who were killed in dis
turbances in Israeli-occupied territories —have
died at the hands of terrorists. So far, there has
been no military retaliation.
In the funeral speech Shamir blamed
"Palestine terror organizations" for the killing
even though no group connected with the PLO
has taken responsibility for the crime, and
French police have no suspects.
"We shall hit them with no holds barred, with
no surcease — for we have decided to live, and
to live in peace."Shamir said.
Israel rhetoric always equates the PLO with
terrorism so it is an easy step to blame the PLO
for any terrorist attack against an Israeli or other
Jewish target whether or not PLO responsibility
can be proved. However, Israel Radio reported
in its late evening newscasts yesterday that Is
raeli officials now believe that Bar-Simantov
might have been killed by a "neo-Fascist or
ganization" and not the PLO.
Nevertheless, Bar-Simantov's killing has ig
nited a fierce debate in Israel about the proper
response.

Argentina fears war with Britain
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina's military government, while
quickly attempting to consolidate its political and military hold over the
Falkland Islands, has signaled clearly its hopes of heading off the on
coming British war fleet through the diplomatic leverage of Latin Amer
ica and its newly warm friendship with the United States.
While Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Mendez met in Washing
ton with the Organization of American States and high-ranking U.S. of
ficials, officials here appeared to be basing their hope of keeping the
long-disputed islands on U.S. mediation and pressure against British
militancy.
With nearly 150 years of patriotism at stake, there appeared to be little
prospect that Argentina would agree to retreat from the Falklands —
which are called the Malvinas here — even in the face of an imminent
British attack.
Argentine officials have appealed for regional support by arguing
that the seizure of the British-controlled island represented a reversal of
nearly 150 years of colonialism and by frequently invoking the "Rio
Treaty," which commits Latin American nations and the United States to
consult in the event that one of them is attacked.
So far, however, the government clearly has been disappointed by its
failure to obtain the level of international support it expected. In partic
ular, officials were surprised when the Soviet Union failed to veto a Se
curity Council resolution Saturday calling for an Argentine withdrawal
from the island and non-aligned members of the council failed to back
Argentina's position.
Although the governments of Venezuela, Peru and Uruguay have ex
pressed support for Argentina's occupation, other Latin American
powers appear to be hesitating.
As a result, Argentina has increasingly come
to turn its hope for a successful end to the crisis
to the United States, reports and sources here
said. In the past year, both governments have
sought actively to establish close relations, and
Argentina, which has backed U.S. policy in Cen
tral America politically and with offers of arms,
believes that the United States now should re
turn the support, officials here said.
Meanwhile, the government has moved to
consolidate its military hold on the islands., rein
forcing the Falklands' defenses with troops and
armor and reportedly nearly vacating several
mainland military bases, while arguing that the
British could not forcibly retake the island
without inflicting heavy civilian casualties.
Britain sets sail
London — Britain's foreign secretary, Lord
Carrington, and his two top aides resigned yes
terday because of what he called the "humil
iating affront to this country" of the Argen
tinian invasion of the Falkland Islands.
Lord Carrington's dramatic resignation came
shortly after a powerful British task force left the
English Channel base at Portsmouth en route to
the South Atlantic — to the cheers of a crowd of
about 10,000 well-wishers.
The aircraft carriers Invincible, with Prince
Andrew aboard, and Hermes, formed the nu
cleus of what is the largest and most powerful
British fleet that has sallied forth since the
seizure of the Suez Canal in 1956.
The ships passed the Round Tower, where
fleets have been watched by the local citizens
for centuries. One banner read: "Good luck,
Navy — Give 'em Hell." Another said: "Don't
Cry For Me Argentina."
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, expressed
her "supreme confidence in the British Navy."
Asked what might happen should the task force
fail, Thatcher quoted Queen Victoria, as she
said: "The possibility of failure does not exist.
"We must recover the Falklands for Britain."
Thatcher had said earlier that she had ac
cepted her foreign minister's resignation "with
a heavy heart." She had failed to persuade Lord
Carrington to remain in office, she said.
She announced that his successor would be
Francis Pym, leader of the House of Commons
and a former defense minister in the Thatcher
government.
Defense Secretary John Nott also tendered
his resignation after the fleet sailed from
Portsmouth yesterday morning, but Thatcher
turned it down.
She told Nott that he was needed to direct the
military operation launched to regain
possession of the Falkland Islands, taken by Ar
gentine assault troops Friday.
Once transferred to Royal Navy jurisdiction,
the Canberra could be used as a troop carrier or
a hospital ship for the Falkland Islands opera
tion.
Arms freeze discussed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yes
terday said he would appeal for nuclear dis
armament in a speech to the United Nations in
June and called on Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev to meet him there to discuss arms
control.
But at the same time that Reagan was continu
ing the arms-reduction overtures he launched
last week in a prime time news conference, he
again condemned the Soviet Union, which he
said had engaged in "crimes" against innocent
people in Afghanistan.
Reagan also repeated his assertion of last
week that the Soviets have a nuclear arms

margin of superiority over the United States, a
view disputed by many experts.
Reagan plans to address a special U.N. session
on disarmament in mid-June after he returns
from a European trip, where nuclear weapons
are certain to be an important item on the agen
da.
"And I hope, very much, that President
Brezhnev will be on hand to do the same thing
and address the same group," Reagan said. "I
think that this whole idea that I have been talk
ing about since back in the campaign of arms
reduction, arms control, is one of the most im
portant things that is facing us."
At the same time, the president said a nuclear
freeze would be "disadvantageous — in fact
even dangerous" to the United States because
the Soviets have a "definite margin of superior
ity" in nuclear arms.
He also contradicted conventional wisdom
among nuclear arms analysts by asserting that
the Soviets have a second-strike capability that
could absorb a U.S. retaliatory strike.
Reagan stuck to his ground when challenged
yesterday on these assertions. He also re
sponded to charges that he should not have said
what he said, even if it is true, because it con
veyed an impression of U.S. weakness.
"No, I am not sorry I said it because ... we
know for sure the Russians know that," Reagan
said. "I think the American people ought to be
able to know everything they know."
Reagan's intent in such declarations, accord
ing to White House officials, is to win at least the
war of words with the Soviets, who have made
numerous arms-control proposals. The presi
dent believes the Soviets take this stance be
cause they are ahead in the arms race.
Budget cuts supported
Washington — President Ronald Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) yes
terday signaled strongly for the first time that
negotiations aimed at reducing the 1983 budget
deficit may succeed.
The key appeared to be acceptance by the
president of some cuts in the large planned in
creases in defense spending and by con
gressional Democrats of a cap on automatic
cost-of-living increases in various benefit pro
grams including Social Security. Some new rev
enue-raising measures, such as an oil-import
fee, may also be part of the compromise.
"I look forward to progress being made as
soon as they (Congress) come back from the
Easter recess," Reagan told reporters at the
White House. "That's why we are negotiating so
fast."
On Capitol Hill, O'Neill declared, "There's a
possibility, there really is a possibility we could
work something out. I don't think (Reagan's) as
hardened on defense as he was." As far as he
can determine, the speaker added, the presi
dent is "still in cement" only on insisting that
last year's business and personal income tax
cuts not be reduced.
The signs of movement came as adminis
tration officials acknowledged the budget out
look has worsened as the economy has re
mained weak. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige said that because of a weaker than ex
pected economy and other developments, it
will take spending cuts of $20 billion to $30
billion on top of the $56 billion worth Reagan
proposed in February to hold the 1983 deficit to
$100 billion.
In other words, if no cuts are made and no
taxes or other revenue-raising measures
adopted, the 1983 deficit would be $175 billion
to $185 billion.

Reagan again said he believes the economy is
"bottoming out of a recession/' but he said he
expected unemployment — already at a post-
World War II record of 9 percent — to continue
to increase for a while.
Israeli minister threatens PLO
Jerusalem — In an emotional oration at the
graveside of a murdered Israeli diplomat, For
eign Minister ''itzhak Shamir yesterday threat
ened to attack terrorists "wherever we find
them ... with no holds barred, with no sur
cease."
On the surface, Shamir's speech seemed to
be a clear declaration that Israel would soon at
tack bases of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) in Lebanon, perhaps repeating last
summer's bombing strike on PLO headquarters
in Beirut. But, it was not clear whether Shamir's
words were meant to be taken literally.
The state-run Israel Radio said, in reporting
the speech, "The question, of course, is wheth

cause they are ahead in the arms race.
Budget cuts supported
Washington — President Ronald Reagan and
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) yes
terday signaled strongly for the first time that
negotiations aimed at reducing the 1983 budget
deficit may succeed.
The key appeared to be acceptance by the
president of some cuts in the large planned in
creases in defense spending and by con
gressional Democrats of a cap on automatic
cost-of-living increases in various benefit pro
grams including Social Security. Some new rev
enue-raising measures, such as an oil-import
fee, may also be part of the compromise.
"I look forward to progress being made as
soon as they (Congress) come back from the
Easter recess," Reagan told reporters at the
White House. "That's why we are negotiating so
fast."
On Capitol Hill, O'Neill declared, "There's a
possibility, there really is a possibility we could
work something out. I don't think (Reagan's) as
hardened on defense as he was." As far as he
can determine, the speaker added, the presi
dent is "still in cement" only on insisting that
last year's business and personal income tax
cuts not be reduced.
The signs of movement came as adminis
tration officials acknowledged the budget out
look has worsened as the economy has re
mained weak. Commerce Secretary Malcolm
Baldrige said that because of a weaker than ex
pected economy and other developments, it
will take spending cuts of $20 billion to $30
billion on top of the $56 billion worth Reagan
proposed in February to hold the 1983 deficit to
$100 billion.
In other words, if no cuts are made and no
taxes or other revenue-raising measures
adopted, the 1983 deficit would be $175 billion
to $185 billion.

Reagan again said he believes the economy is
"bottoming out of a recession/' but he said he
expected unemployment — already at a post-
World War II record of 9 percent — to continue
to increase for a while.
Israeli minister threatens PLO
Jerusalem — In an emotional oration at the
graveside of a murdered Israeli diplomat, For
eign Minister ''itzhak Shamir yesterday threat
ened to attack terrorists "wherever we find
them ... with no holds barred, with no sur
cease."
On the surface, Shamir's speech seemed to
be a clear declaration that Israel would soon at
tack bases of the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) in Lebanon, perhaps repeating last
summer's bombing strike on PLO headquarters
in Beirut. But, it was not clear whether Shamir's
words were meant to be taken literally.
The state-run Israel Radio said, in reporting
the speech, "The question, of course, is wheth
er this graveside eulogy is a bellwether for Is
raeli military intentions against the terrorists in
Lebanon." It offered no answer to the question.
Israeli officials, including Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon and Shamir, have said that Israel would
react militarily if a single Jew was killed by PLO
action anywhere in the world. However, since
these warnings were first issued, at least three
Israelis — diplomat Yacov Bar-Simantov who
was shot in Paris, and an Army sergeant major
and a police officer who were killed in dis
turbances in Israeli-occupied territories —have
died at the hands of terrorists. So far, there has
been no military retaliation.
In the funeral speech Shamir blamed
"Palestine terror organizations" for the killing
even though no group connected with the PLO
has taken responsibility for the crime, and
French police have no suspects.
"We shall hit them with no holds barred, with
no surcease — for we have decided to live, and
to live in peace."Shamir said.
Israel rhetoric always equates the PLO with
terrorism so it is an easy step to blame the PLO
for any terrorist attack against an Israeli or other
Jewish target whether or not PLO responsibility
can be proved. However, Israel Radio reported
in its late evening newscasts yesterday that Is
raeli officials now believe that Bar-Simantov
might have been killed by a "neo-Fascist or
ganization" and not the PLO.
Nevertheless, Bar-Simantov's killing has ig
nited a fierce debate in Israel about the proper
response.

Argentina fears war with Britain
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina's military government, while
quickly attempting to consolidate its political and military hold over the
Falkland Islands, has signaled clearly its hopes of heading off the on
coming British war fleet through the diplomatic leverage of Latin Amer
ica and its newly warm friendship with the United States.
While Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Mendez met in Washing
ton with the Organization of American States and high-ranking U.S. of
ficials, officials here appeared to be basing their hope of keeping the
long-disputed islands on U.S. mediation and pressure against British
militancy.
With nearly 150 years of patriotism at stake, there appeared to be little
prospect that Argentina would agree to retreat from the Falklands —
which are called the Malvinas here — even in the face of an imminent
British attack.
Argentine officials have appealed for regional support by arguing
that the seizure of the British-controlled island represented a reversal of
nearly 150 years of colonialism and by frequently invoking the "Rio
Treaty," which commits Latin American nations and the United States to
consult in the event that one of them is attacked.
So far, however, the government clearly has been disappointed by its
failure to obtain the level of international support it expected. In partic
ular, officials were surprised when the Soviet Union failed to veto a Se
curity Council resolution Saturday calling for an Argentine withdrawal
from the island and non-aligned members of the council failed to back
Argentina's position.
Although the governments of Venezuela, Peru and Uruguay have ex
pressed support for Argentina's occupation, other Latin American
powers appear to be hesitating.
As a result, Argentina has increasingly come
to turn its hope for a successful end to the crisis
to the United States, reports and sources here
said. In the past year, both governments have
sought actively to establish close relations, and
Argentina, which has backed U.S. policy in Cen
tral America politically and with offers of arms,
believes that the United States now should re
turn the support, officials here said.
Meanwhile, the government has moved to
consolidate its military hold on the islands., rein
forcing the Falklands' defenses with troops and
armor and reportedly nearly vacating several
mainland military bases, while arguing that the
British could not forcibly retake the island
without inflicting heavy civilian casualties.
Britain sets sail
London — Britain's foreign secretary, Lord
Carrington, and his two top aides resigned yes
terday because of what he called the "humil
iating affront to this country" of the Argen
tinian invasion of the Falkland Islands.
Lord Carrington's dramatic resignation came
shortly after a powerful British task force left the
English Channel base at Portsmouth en route to
the South Atlantic — to the cheers of a crowd of
about 10,000 well-wishers.
The aircraft carriers Invincible, with Prince
Andrew aboard, and Hermes, formed the nu
cleus of what is the largest and most powerful
British fleet that has sallied forth since the
seizure of the Suez Canal in 1956.
The ships passed the Round Tower, where
fleets have been watched by the local citizens
for centuries. One banner read: "Good luck,
Navy — Give 'em Hell." Another said: "Don't
Cry For Me Argentina."
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, expressed
her "supreme confidence in the British Navy."
Asked what might happen should the task force
fail, Thatcher quoted Queen Victoria, as she
said: "The possibility of failure does not exist.
"We must recover the Falklands for Britain."
Thatcher had said earlier that she had ac
cepted her foreign minister's resignation "with
a heavy heart." She had failed to persuade Lord
Carrington to remain in office, she said.
She announced that his successor would be
Francis Pym, leader of the House of Commons
and a former defense minister in the Thatcher
government.
Defense Secretary John Nott also tendered
his resignation after the fleet sailed from
Portsmouth yesterday morning, but Thatcher
turned it down.
She told Nott that he was needed to direct the
military operation launched to regain
possession of the Falkland Islands, taken by Ar
gentine assault troops Friday.
Once transferred to Royal Navy jurisdiction,
the Canberra could be used as a troop carrier or
a hospital ship for the Falkland Islands opera
tion.
Arms freeze discussed
Washington — President Ronald Reagan yes
terday said he would appeal for nuclear dis
armament in a speech to the United Nations in
June and called on Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev to meet him there to discuss arms
control.
But at the same time that Reagan was continu
ing the arms-reduction overtures he launched
last week in a prime time news conference, he
again condemned the Soviet Union, which he
said had engaged in "crimes" against innocent
people in Afghanistan.
Reagan also repeated his assertion of last
week that the Soviets have a nuclear arms

margin of superiority over the United States, a
view disputed by many experts.
Reagan plans to address a special U.N. session
on disarmament in mid-June after he returns
from a European trip, where nuclear weapons
are certain to be an important item on the agen
da.
"And I hope, very much, that President
Brezhnev will be on hand to do the same thing
and address the same group," Reagan said. "I
think that this whole idea that I have been talk
ing about since back in the campaign of arms
reduction, arms control, is one of the most im
portant things that is facing us."
At the same time, the president said a nuclear
freeze would be "disadvantageous — in fact
even dangerous" to the United States because
the Soviets have a "definite margin of superior
ity" in nuclear arms.
He also contradicted conventional wisdom
among nuclear arms analysts by asserting that
the Soviets have a second-strike capability that
could absorb a U.S. retaliatory strike.
Reagan stuck to his ground when challenged
yesterday on these assertions. He also re
sponded to charges that he should not have said
what he said, even if it is true, because it con
veyed an impression of U.S. weakness.
"No, I am not sorry I said it because ... we
know for sure the Russians know that," Reagan
said. "I think the American people ought to be
able to know everything they know."
Reagan's intent in such declarations, accord
ing to White House officials, is to win at least the
war of words with the Soviets, who have made
numerous arms-control proposals. The presi
dent believes the Soviets take this stance be
cause they are ahead in the arms race.
