Argentina fears war with Britain
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Argentina's military government, while
quickly attempting to consolidate its political and military hold over the
Falkland Islands, has signaled clearly its hopes of heading off the on
coming British war fleet through the diplomatic leverage of Latin Amer
ica and its newly warm friendship with the United States.
While Argentine Foreign Minister Nicanor Mendez met in Washing
ton with the Organization of American States and high-ranking U.S. of
ficials, officials here appeared to be basing their hope of keeping the
long-disputed islands on U.S. mediation and pressure against British
militancy.
With nearly 150 years of patriotism at stake, there appeared to be little
prospect that Argentina would agree to retreat from the Falklands —
which are called the Malvinas here — even in the face of an imminent
British attack.
Argentine officials have appealed for regional support by arguing
that the seizure of the British-controlled island represented a reversal of
nearly 150 years of colonialism and by frequently invoking the "Rio
Treaty," which commits Latin American nations and the United States to
consult in the event that one of them is attacked.
So far, however, the government clearly has been disappointed by its
failure to obtain the level of international support it expected. In partic
ular, officials were surprised when the Soviet Union failed to veto a Se
curity Council resolution Saturday calling for an Argentine withdrawal
from the island and non-aligned members of the council failed to back
Argentina's position.
Although the governments of Venezuela, Peru and Uruguay have ex
pressed support for Argentina's occupation, other Latin American
powers appear to be hesitating.
