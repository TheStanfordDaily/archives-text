# ASSU elections process finalized
## 
### Douglas Jehl 
Thirty undergraduates and nine
graduate students had submitted
petitions and declared their can
didacies for the ASSU senate when
the filing deadline passed at 4 p.m.
yesterday afternoon; they will vie for
10 undergraduate and 10 graduate
student senate seats. In addition, two
slates of candidates will compete for
the ASSU Council of Presidents
(COP) office, while three slates will
run for senior class presidents, ac
cording to ASSU Election Com
missioner Eric Laurence.
Laurence also officially confirmed
yesterday's Daily report that the elec
tion for all but one of the proposed
fee assessments will occur on April 28
and 29, rather than April 14 and 15 as
originally scheduled. The ASSU had
failed to announce the election in
the Daily by March 31,14 days before
the election, as required by the ASSU

constitution.
The program fee will be the only
fee assessment proposal to appear on
the April 14 and 15 ballot. According
to Student Financial Manager Cyn
thia Mathewson, this will occur be
cause of a constitutional require
ment that the program fee be voted
on at the same time as the presiden
tial election.
Thirteen other fee assessment pro
posals will appear on the April 28 and
29 ballot. Laurence said yesterday
that this number of fee assessments
was final and that he would not ac
cept petitions from any other groups,
The fact that only 39 students de
clared their candidacies was a sur
prise to some ASSU officials. Based
on the number of information sheets
and petitions that were picked up by
prospective senate candidates, it had
been expected that the number of
candidates would near 70.
