## Stanford professor's shuttle experiment successful 
### Bill Beyda 
NASA's Space Shuttle, which completed
its third mission Tuesday morning when it
landed in White Sands, N.Mex., carried the
first experiment involving flight crew ac
tivity in space — an experiment coordi
nated by Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. Peter Banks.
"The experiment was a roaring success,"
Banks said. "We were able to carry out all
of our experiments in spite of the shuttle's
communications problems."
The experiment examined "the elec
trical behavior of the orbiter (shuttle) in
the upper atmosphere/' Banks said. "Our
experiment was designed to show how the
electrically charged gases interacted with
the orbiter. This is the first large vehicle
we've had in orbit and by studying it, we
will be better able to design other large
space structures, such as space platforms
and even space stations."
There were three phases of the experi
ment, according to Banks. In the first, an
electron gun sitting in the payload bay of
the shuttle was turned on, and its effect
was observed.
The second involved the PDP — the
Plasma Diagnostic Package — which could
detect the electron beam. The flight crew
moved the PDP with the shuttle's movable
arm until they found the beam, making
their own observations while more precise
readings were being taken by machines.
The third phase involved experiments of

the flight crew's own design while they
were in space to get a better under
standing of the beam.
The flight crew was trained in sim
ulations of the experiment on Earth before
the mission, which involved moving the
Shuttle's arm, and observation with both
their eyes and sensitive video equipment.
"The crew followed the procedure pre
cisely," Banks said. "At one point, NASA's
mission director, sensing the flight crew
was tired, told them to eat and rest. This
was during one of the four times that
measurements for our experiments were
to be taken, so this part of the experiment
was being cancelled. The flight crew ate,
and then insisted on doing our experiment
during the next orbit. We were very
pleased."
Banks arrived at Johnson Space Center
in Houston three days before the mission
started, and remained there throughout
the nine-day mission to observe the
progress of the experiments and help
guide the flight crew through it. The proc
ess was exhausting — Banks had many 20-
hour days during the mission, but "it was
very exciting," he said. "There was a lot of
tension, especially because the shuttle is
out of contact with the ground frequently
during its orbit."
When the mission was extended an extra
day due to the high winds at the landing
site, Banks hoped the experiment could be
extended, but the flight director was con

cerned with the amount of power that
would be needed if the flight crew had to
stay in space a few more days. "They cut
the shuttle's energy use by 50 percent in
the last day, so our experiment couldn't be
extended, but we are very pleased that all
of our planned observations were made."
The electron beam was monitored by
several ground stations, and also several
satellites. This monitoring was coordinated
by Umran Inan, professor of electrical en
gineering here.
"There were ground stations at Stanford
and Antarctica, under the direction of
John Katsufrakis (adjunct professor of
electrical engineering), as well as stations
in Sao Paulo, Brazil and Geneva, Switzer
land recording data," Inan said. "In addi
tion, several satellites were monitoring the
beam." The data is presently on tapes at
monitoring stations all over the world, and
will be sent to Stanford for analysis, Inan
said.
"I am cautiously optimistic," Inan said.
"We simply don't know whether we'll be
able to detect if the electron beam radiates
at these frequencies."
The experiment was so successful that
Banks anticipates doing further work as
early as the fifth space shuttle mission this
November. In addition, similar experi
ments may be on Spacelab 11,
Also involved in the experiment were
several scientists at Utah State, where
Banks was a professor until this year.

cisely," Banks said. "At one point, NASA's
mission director, sensing the flight crew
was tired, told them to eat and rest. This
was during one of the four times that
measurements for our experiments were
to be taken, so this part of the experiment
was being cancelled. The flight crew ate,
and then insisted on doing our experiment
during the next orbit. We were very
pleased."
Banks arrived at Johnson Space Center
in Houston three days before the mission
started, and remained there throughout
the nine-day mission to observe the
progress of the experiments and help
guide the flight crew through it. The proc
ess was exhausting — Banks had many 20-
hour days during the mission, but "it was
very exciting," he said. "There was a lot of
tension, especially because the shuttle is
out of contact with the ground frequently
during its orbit."
When the mission was extended an extra
day due to the high winds at the landing
site, Banks hoped the experiment could be
extended, but the flight director was con

cerned with the amount of power that
would be needed if the flight crew had to
stay in space a few more days. "They cut
the shuttle's energy use by 50 percent in
the last day, so our experiment couldn't be
extended, but we are very pleased that all
of our planned observations were made."
The electron beam was monitored by
several ground stations, and also several
satellites. This monitoring was coordinated
by Umran Inan, professor of electrical en
gineering here.
"There were ground stations at Stanford
and Antarctica, under the direction of
John Katsufrakis (adjunct professor of
electrical engineering), as well as stations
in Sao Paulo, Brazil and Geneva, Switzer
land recording data," Inan said. "In addi
tion, several satellites were monitoring the
beam." The data is presently on tapes at
monitoring stations all over the world, and
will be sent to Stanford for analysis, Inan
said.
"I am cautiously optimistic," Inan said.
"We simply don't know whether we'll be
able to detect if the electron beam radiates
at these frequencies."
The experiment was so successful that
Banks anticipates doing further work as
early as the fifth space shuttle mission this
November. In addition, similar experi
ments may be on Spacelab 11,
Also involved in the experiment were
several scientists at Utah State, where
Banks was a professor until this year.


SPACE STATION? — The large contraption near the space
shuttle is an artist's conception of a proposed
Lockheed/NASA Power Array Module. After more ex-

perimentation in space, the module may be developed as
Eart of a project to place a power station in space,
opefuily eliminating problems for Earth's inhabitants.
