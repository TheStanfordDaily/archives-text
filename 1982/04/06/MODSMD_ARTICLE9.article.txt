# Partnership to make money from outer space announced
## 
### Kristen Christopher 
The formation of a partnership intended for
making profit from outer space was announced
on Friday after a closed five-hour conference
between prospective partners was held in Tres
idder Union.
In a Daily interview, Nancy Kobryn, president
of Amicitia International Institute, the organiza
tion that sponsored the conference, said,
"Transnat is intended to be a partnership be
tween industry and education to make money in
space development." The name Transnat was
chosen, according to Kobryn, because the part
nership plans to be transnational, deriving prof
its for everyone on earth.
Transnat plans to generate these profits by ob
taining services, products, and energy resources
from space, and selling them to the public. "We
anticipate that pure drugs, solar-power satel
lites, pure crystals, and a number of other prod
ucts can be produced in outer space which are
beneficial to people on earth," Kobryn said.
The group wants to bridge a gap between in
dustiy and education in order to successfully de
velop space. "Industry will play a role in the part
nership with respect to research and develop
ment, training programs, manufacturing and ca
reers," Kobryn said. "Industry needs trained
graduates to fill the roles, and education needs
industry to describe what kinds of jobs and ca
reers are upcoming so students can plan in
telligently for their own futures. We feel there is
no future for industry unless it invests in educa
tion."

Transnat, in conjunction with Amicitia, is
working to develop innovative educational pro
grams to prepare students for careers in space.
Dr. Richard Reis, director of science and tech
nology at the Career Planning and Placement
Center here, addressed the topic, "Creating Ca
reers in Space Science and Technology" at the
conference, and Kobryn said that some pro
grams are being developed here, but they can
not be announced yet.
The question of finance was addressed by Dr.
Roger Selnick, vice president of Futures Re
search at Security Pacific National Bank, in a talk
called, "Capitalism Goes into Orbit".
Kobryn said that along with funds from NASA
and private organizations, she hopes that financ
ing will come from large corporation research
and development funds. Transnat plans to try to
convince corporations that "with a collaborative
effort (between industry and education), they
can accomplish more." She said she does not
feel that funding is a problem, however.
The long-term goal of the partnership is to co
lonize space. "We want to make living in space a
reality in our lifetime," Kobryn said. "Science
and technology are changing our lives every
day, and if we make the most of it we have op
portunities no generation has ever had."
Other participants at the conference included
John Black, general manager of Pacific Tele
phone Company's new $200 million laser
network, Dr. Ronald Hawke, director of re
search at University of California's Lawrence Liv
ermore Laboratory, and James Gray, director of
Futurethink at Evergreen Valley College.
