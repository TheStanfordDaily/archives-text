# Lantos attacks cuts, defends student aid

### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
Kep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo)
yesterday pledged his determination
to maintain federal funding of stu
dent grants and loans before 75 peo
ple attending a rally in White Plaza
protesting student aid budget cuts
proposed by the Reagan adminis
tration for next year.
"The House of Representatives are
sick and tired of the Reagan adminis
tration cutting what is meaningful
and worthwhile in American society.
Enough of us in Congress are de
termined that student loans will be
continued," Lantos said between in
termittent showers which almost
forced postponement of the rally
scheduled as part of Disorientation
Week.
Budget cuts proposed by the Rea
gan administration include elimina
tion of new National Direct Student
Loan (NDSL) funds, Supplemental
Grants, Federal Support for Cal
Grants and all Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL) and federal fellowships
for graduate and professional stu
dents.
Under the new budget federally
supported Work Study and Pell
Grants (formerly called Basic Equal
Opportunity Grants) would be re
duced by 50 per cent and GSL ori
gination fees for undergraduates
would be increased from five per
cent to ten per cent.
The budget cuts would represent a

loss of approximately $14.6 million to
Stanford students, based on figures
cited by Vince De Anda, assistant di
rector of financial aids. Forty-five per
cent of Stanford students are current
ly receiving some kind of financial as
sistance.
Such cuts might force lower and
middle income students to choose a
state university education over a
private institution's, said Council of
Presidents (COP) member Fred Buhl.
"A single class university would un
fortunately exacerbate the 'Ivory
Tower' complexities of a school like
Stanford," he said.
And, in sarcastic complaint of the
Reagan administration's lack of
educated leaders, Buhl continued,
"I'm sure there are certain things that
Hollywood simply cannot teach
you."
Buhl also called for a massive letter
writing campaign to important sena
tors and congressmen protesting the
proposed funding cuts. A table was
set up with information and will be
available again today in White Plaza
from ll:30 a.m. to I:I5 p.m. for other
interested students.
Though many students attending
the rally are currently receiving some
financial help and are concerned
about talk of reductions in aid, few
seemed worried about actually los
ing their funding.
"Sure I'm concerned," said one
freshman who receives aid, "but I'm
