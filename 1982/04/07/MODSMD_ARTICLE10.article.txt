# Savage storm sweeps through midwest
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Winter waged a violent battle with
spring across a broad section of mid-Amer
ica Monday as howling wind gusts drifted
snow from lowa to Ohio and gales
whipped Lake Michigan into a frenzy of
12-foot waves that crumbled long
stretches of shoreline from Milwaukee to
the Indiana sand dunes.
It was the fourth straight day of weather
misery for much of the nation as the snow
arid cold swept over an area already hit
with tornadoes, rain and roaring winds
that have claimed at least 60 lives since Fri
day and left destruction in communities
from Texas to Illinois and the Rockies to
Virginia.
The storm, which the National Weather
Service in Chicago called dangerous, was
expected to slam into the East Coast early

yesterday, borne by a 150 mph jet stream
that steered the transcontinental weather
system from coast to coast with uncom
mon speed. At the same time, near-record
low barometric pressures across the heart
land acted as meteorological vacuum
cleaners, sucking cold arctic air from the
north and warm moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico together in violent collisions.
"This is the time of year when we expect
severe weather outbreaks, but this storm is
remarkable for its speed and sudden
changes," said Ed Ferguson, deputy direc
tor of the National Severe Storms Forecast
Center in Kansas City. Cold temperatures
extended farther south than normal, too,
he said, prompting freeze warnings in
southern Kansas and South Carolina.
Earlier Monday the storm swept across
lowa, northern Missouri and southern

Wisconsin. In Des Moines, traffic was re
duced to a frustrating crawl by more than
six inches of snow. Drifts and accidents
forced lowa officials to close some sections
of ice-coated interstate highways.
Temperatures from the Midwest to New
England plunged to record spring lows
ahead of the snows, with Sault Ste. Marie
recording 2 degrees below zero and some
localities in New York suffering through 12
degrees below zero and 55-mph winds.
Up to seven inches of snow was ex
pected in Chicago and a foot or more was
forecast for some suburbs south of the
City. Adding to the paralysis in the Windy
City were two morning wildcat strikes on
commuter rail lines that forced tens of
thousands of commuters to their cars.
