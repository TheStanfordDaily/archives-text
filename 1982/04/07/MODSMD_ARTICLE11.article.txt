## Taking a tour through Storey House 
### Cici Oremland Senior staff writer 
On a little side patio of 544
Lasuen, a new wood bench's
commemorative engraving
reads "Storey House 1905 re
constructed 1982," an aptly
chosen motto for a remodeled
house blending the efficiency
of the new with the charm of
the old.
The new Storey House has
received a completely new
face, inside and out, and its
new residents have moved in
for spring quarter, two years
and almost $2 million after fire
destroyed much of the struc
ture in 1980.
The house has been
enlarged to accommodate 44
residents with ground floor
rooms provided for the wheel
chair-bound. But certainly one
of the house's newest features
is the addition of male resi
dents. Before the fire, the
house had been one of two all
female houses on campus.
"I love it," say many of
Storey's new residents, includ
ing Matt Sharp, a sophomore
who has just moved in.
On a tour of the house last
week, Sharp was quick to point
out many of the house's new
features which will probably
place the house among the
more highly sought after dur
ing the spring housing draw.
The obvious care taken in

selecting color schemes which
reflect some subtlety is most
impressive. New Storey's
tasteful flavor can be found in
few of the University's other
larger dormitory complexes.
Walking up toward the
house's main entrance one is
struck by the house's three
tone facade. The exterior is a
kind of Navajo white (white
with a touch of pink and
brown) trimmed with pink and
white.
The front stairs remain ap
proachable from two sides, as
were "old Storey's" but a new
addition on the front porch has
included a covered area for re
cycling cans that hides the cans
from open view. Sharp joked
that these were "designer gar
bage bins."
The downstairs areas are soft
ly lighted with oriental style fix
tures of wood and paper to re
duce glare.
Similar soft lighting designs
can be seen in the living room
where a dimmer switch il
luminates the alcove above the
fireplace.
The rest of the living room
seemed a little dark, but Diana
Conklin, director of the Row,
said that table lamps and per
haps a few standing lamps will
be bought to alleviate the
problem.
The living room's furniture is
new and tasteful. The sofa and

chairs are a delicate burgundy
print, a little reminiscent of a
Laura Ashley creation. Gone
are the crass and harsh colors
typically found in the furniture
of other on-campus
furnishings, such as a couch
described as "early jungle
stripes" which was recently re
moved from another Row
house by unanimous demand
of its residents.
Off the living room is anoth
er sitting room and a seminar
room with large windows over
looking a back patio and small
gardens at the rear of the
house.
The dining room is most rem
iniscent of the "old Storey."
Small round wooden tables
with matching chairs are
placed about the room and its
small alcove, though atthe mo
ment the dining room view
looks out at "the Braun Music
Center lake," Sharp said.
"So far the food has been
pretty good," he said. Though
the kitchen was locked at the
time of the tour, a glimpse of
the new kitchen, complete
with hanging ferns, and strings
of red chilis and garlic, could
be seen.
To satisfy individual resi
dents' culinary appetites,
kitchenette facilities have also
been installed.
At the back of the house, fac
ing the Tresidder parking lot, a

glass anteroom has been con
structed to provide easy wheel
chair access for the handi
capped.
To go upstairs, the house's
central staircase, lined with
polished wooden railings,
moves up the two flights in a
kind of circular motion and is
lighted from above by a large
skylight.
The house has also been
enlarged to hold an enclosed
staircase and an exterior stair
case providing an alternate exit
route from the house in case of
fire.
But Storey's new residents
say they have little fear of a re
peat fire. "There are sprinklers
everywhere. There are at least
three sprinklers in each
bedroom, not including others
in each of the closets," said
Sharp.
The everpresent sprinklers
line about every four feet of
hall space throughout the en
tire house.
Designed by Sigrid Rupp of
Sigrid Rupp's Architects, the
new house's hallways have
been straightened from the
more jagged, seemingly
haphazard, layout of the old
house. But Storey's new plan
has preserved the charm of the
old house's rooms.
The individual rooms, prima
rily doubles, are of all shapes.
Each room has been furnished

with wooden furniture.
"My only complaint is about
the desks," said Sharp. "They
have a fake front (paper and
pencil) drawer. It seems a little
silly."
It also seemed to me that lit
tle drawer space has been pro
vided because each resident is
given only three dresser
drawers.
But Conklin said, "All in all
there seems to be enough
space. The closets are huge so
you can hang all your clothes."

It is true. The ciosets are
huge and no one is expected to
share a closet as is frequently
the case in many other on
campus residences.
Bathrooms also seem large
and carefully detailed. Each
bathroom is tiled in different
contrasting colors which in
clude an all American red,
white and blue, a yellow and
orange that Sharp said reminds
him a little of McDonald's and
an avocado and orange that
Sharp described as being "Cali

fornia colors."
One small bathroom consists
only of a tub lighted by a small
skylight, perfect for relaxing af
ter long hours of studying.
For additional relaxation, the
house also sports a new
redwood sundeck with white
lawn furniture which one can
guess will become the perfect
springquarteraddition. Forthe
moment the furniture remains
unused, waiting for more op
portune weather.

SAME OLD STOREY? â€” The newly renovated Storey House, which just reopened this
quarter, may have changed greatly from its former state, but its dining room still retains
the "old Storey" atmosphere.
