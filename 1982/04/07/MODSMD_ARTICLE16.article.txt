## The
						District eyes statehood 
### 
Washington — Our nation's capital
wants to become a state. Un
thinkable? Absurd? If the delegates
to the D.C, Statehood Constitutional
Convention here have their way, the
District of Columbia may become the
51st state as early as 1983. Here's how:
Since January, 45 delegates elected
by Washington voters have con
vened regularly to write a state con
stitution. Under local law, the dele
gates must finish this task by the end
of May. If the constitution is subse
quently approved by city voters,
Congress and the president, Wash
ington would become a state with
full voting representation in Con
gress and the power to create a state
government.
The passion shared by convention
delegates for statehood derives from
Washington's unique situation as the
seat of the federal government. A
section in the U.S. Consitution pro
vides for our nation's capital under
exclusive federal control. Since 1800,
when the federal government made
D.C. its home, Congress has presided
over the local government here.
And, since 1874, the District has
had no real legislative assembly. In
stead, Congress has acted as the Dis
trict's legislature with the power to
veto any bill proposed by the local
city council. It is difficult to convince
Washingtonians, 70 percent of whom
are black, that congressmen, 97 per
cent of whom are white and affluent,
truly represent local concerns.
Additionally, even though Wash
ington's population of roughly
650,000 ranks it ahead of Alaska, Del
aware , Vermont and Wyoming, the
District has no voting representation
in Congress. Without voting rights in

Congress, D.C. residents are denied
full participation in the government
meant to represent them.
In spite of the many appealing
arguments for D.C. statehood, were
the question put to them today, most
Americans would probably reject the
idea. Economically and geographi-

Instead, Congress has
acted as the District's
legislature with the
power to veto any bill
proposed by the local
city council. It is
difficult to convince
Washingtonians, 70
percent of whom are
black, that
congressmen, 97
percent of whom are
white and affluent,
truly represent local
concerns.

cally, Washington does not conform
to the popular notion of what a state
should be. After all, Washington is
just a city.
Most people, such as myself, pre
fer to have a special home for the
federal government, outside the ju
risdiction of any one state. Compris
ing about 67 square miles, the District
acts as a symbolic buffer between the
federal government and the sur
rounding states. Loss of that neutral
ground would lead to a perception

that federal decision-making could
become hostage to the new state's
local interest. The founding fathers
were obviously sensitive to the pres
sures that could be brought to bear
on the national government by state
commercial and political interests.
Ironically, the greatest threat to the
statehood movement is not opposi
tion from Congress or groups outside
Washington, but from the lack of
trust among the convention dele
gates. Political infighting between
white and black delegates for control
of leadership has clouded the more
important task — writing a state con
stitution.
Unless the delegates can over
come their racial divisions, fac
tionalism is likely to carry over into
the next phase of the convention's
work — selling statehood to Wash
ingtonians. Without the delegates'
unanimous support during this
critical period, the statehood issue
may make a poor showing when
Washingtonians vote on it in Novem
ber. If people here are hesitant to
support statehood, Congress and the
president will only follow suit.
Yet even if statehood for D.C. is.a
long shot, the efforts of the constitu
tional amendment was introduced in
1978 to give D.C. residents those vot
ing rights. It has, unfortunately,
floundered in the state legislatures
for lack of support. If the statehood
convention succeeds only in kindling
support for that amendment in the
states, it will have made a mark on
history.
