## Soviet menace in European milieu 
### 
In any of life's contests, it is su
preme folly to count on a weakness
or sweet reasonableness on the part
of the adversary. That is often wishful
thinking Cf^e yen a moral defection.
As in the notorious case of Hitler,
who was thought by Chamberlain
and others of his mild ilk to be after
limited pan-German aims, the conse
quences can be historically dis
astrous.
This is the urgent case with the So
viet Union now. There are some who
believe her brutal moves in Czecho
slovakia, Hungary, Afghanistan, Po
land, etc. are merely the prolonga
tion of a traditional Russian defensive
anxiety. These people may well be
claiming the same when the Soviet
force of 65,000 tanks reaches the
Channel, perhaps nourished by the
projected gas line which convenient
ly follows the invasion route, as a
prominent Frenchman noted. It is
not a very consoling thought that we
Westerners gave them roughly the
equivalent of the tanks through
cheap loans which will never be
repaid and now are doing the same
with the pipeline, not to speak of the
technology we made and will make
available.
Some say Russia has never been
adventurous. There were concrete
reasons for that hitherto: her general
backwardness, her loosely hung-to
gether empire and sprawling shape
as compared to Napoleonic France
or Nazi Germany, for example. But
now, as in the case of Prussia under
Bismarck, the European sector of the
Soviet Union has amassed a fearful
might and is faced with immense
temptations.
It i> me oid story of "holier than
thou/' a rising class or group dying to
"show" everybody. George Kennan
used to speak of that as the central
danger in their drive (before he got
ambivalent and mystic), and as their
own nationalities tug at the Soviets or
border states like Poland, the tempta

tion to push their weight around may
rise irrepressibly. Let us not forget
Aristotle's "Man desires spontane
ously infinitely". That may well be
truer of the Russians, as Camus
noted; they are nothing if not roman
tic and sacrificially so. Andrea Lee is
must-reading in this regard. Given
the right situation, they will stop this
time at nothing.
That is why we cannot afford to
give them that opportunity. Nor can
we afford to quibble over whether
they may be weaker than we in this or
that category of armament. As if it
were a question of categoriesl It is
the whole damn shebang we are
going to have to deal with and mostly
their will and ruthless their
clearly announced and dogged aim
— ideological or national — to bring
us down, utilizing all our sentimen
talities and flaccidities.
Since the matter of relative weap
onry is evidently controversial, can
we afford for a minute not to give our
survival as free people the benefit of
the doubt? In the name of what child
ish fecklessness and improvidence or
shallow comfort? Especially since it is
through outproducing them, as we
surely can, that we can immediately
begin to marshal our Western will, to
do most to discourage their ad
venturous temptation concretely,
bring out in time their long-range
hoped for failure, "show" them
back, meet their spiritual challenge
through some sacrifice of our own,
without war.
Between innings of a baseball
game, according to Admiral
Zumwalt, Kissinger told him the West
no longer had the will to meet a
challenge like that one and that he,
Kissinger, was using his diplomatic
powers to make the best of that sad
situation. I believe Zumwalt was
more right than Kissinger, betting on
our capacity to eventually rise to face
a crisis, as in the battle of Bastogne.
But that belief of the staunch is being

sorely tested as we watch the waves
of pacifism wash over us again as they
did before every major war, leaving
us for a while prostrate before a dan
gerous enemy and, indeed, inviting
war.
Spending six months in France, liv
ing that much closer to those tanks,
has sobered me. The vice-president
of a major university exclaimed to
me, with red face, "France is
doomed!" By taking four Com
munists into the cabinet — a move
Raymond Aron termed "indecent"
— for all-too-clever political reasons,
the socialist government has given
them opportunities for desperate
moves. Very strange things are hap
pening underground, and a genuine
fear of creeping totalitarianism is ex
pressed by reliable voices such as
those of Revel and Aron. An ex
ecutive I know is afraid to use his of
fice phone for frank conversation.
Little of this appears on the surface,
of course. Even as the franc plunges,
Paris is still Paris, beautiful as ever. I
hate what is happening. It has hap
pened, alas, before ...
